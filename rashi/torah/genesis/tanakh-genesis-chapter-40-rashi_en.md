<b>After these events.</b> Because that cursed woman made it a habit that this righteous man be a topic of conversation to all, to speak about him and to demean him, God brought about the offenses of these [people] so that their attention be diverted to these [people] and not to him [Yoseif]. Also, to bring about a respite to the righteous man through their doings. 
<b>An offense was committed.</b> Concerning one, a fly was found in his cup of aromatic beverage while a pebble was found in the bread of the other. 
<b>And baker.</b> Of the bread of the king. The term אַפִיָה —baking—applies only to bread. In Old French it is <i>pestor</i> [baker].

<b>Pharaoh’s birthday.</b> [יוֹם הֻלֶּדֶת means] his birthday. It is called <i>Ginusia Day</i> [in Greek]. The הֻלֶּדֶת form [which is הִפְעִיל —passive causative, is used] because the infant is not born unless it is with the aid of others because a midwife helped the woman give birth. It is for this reason that a midwife is called a מְיַלֶּדֶת —one who brings to birth. Similarly, “Your birth—on the day of your birth” or, “After the leprosy is cleansed [הוּכַּבֵּס] away” because it is cleansed by others. 
<b>He lifted the head, etc.</b> [Meaning:] he counted them with his other servants, because he was counting those servants that would wait on him at his feast, he remembered these among them, as in שְׂאוּ אֶת רֹאשׁ , meaning counting.
