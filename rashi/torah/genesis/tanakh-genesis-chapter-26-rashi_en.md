<b>Do not go down to Egypt.</b> Because he [Yitzchok] intended to go down to Egypt as his father had gone down during the days of the famine. He [God] said to him, “Do not go down to Egypt for you are a burnt-offering without blemish and being outside the [Holy] land does not befit you.”

<b>Through your descendants shall be blessed.</b> [Meaning:] a man will say to his son, “May your children be like the children of Yitzchok.” This [phrase] has similar meaning in all Scripture. And the following [verse] is the archetype of all: “Through you shall [the People of] Israel bless, saying: ‘May Elohim make you [as Ephraim and Menasheh].’” We also find this concerning a curse: “And the woman shall be a curse” whereby one who curses his enemy says, “May you be like that particular woman.” Similarly: “May you leave your name as an oath to my chosen,” whereby one who takes an oath says, “May I be as that particular person if I did such and such.”

<b>My decrees.</b> [Referring to] things that the evil inclination and the nations of the world argue against, such as [the prohibitions against] eating pork and wearing garments of wool and linen for which there [apparently] are no reasons, but are the edicts of the King and His decrees upon His subjects. 
<b>And My teachings.</b> To include the Oral Law—laws given by God to Moshe at Sinai.

### passuk 26
<b>Along with a group of his friends.</b> As Onkelos translates it וְסִיעַת מֵרַחֲמוֹהִי meaning: a group [formed] from his friends. There are some who explain מֵרֵעֵהוּ the letter מ' being part of the root of the word as in: שְׁלשִׁים מֵרֵעִים , “thirty friends” of Shimshon, so that the word וַאֲחֻזַּת be in the construct state. However, it would be improper to speak of a king in this manner “his group of friends” because this would imply that he brought along his entire group of friends and that he had only one group of friends. It is therefore preferable to explain it in the first way. You need not wonder about the letter תי"ו of the word אֲחֻזַּת ; though the word is not in the construct state we [nevertheless] find similar cases in Scripture: עֶזְרָת מִצָּר —“Help against the oppressor,” וּשְׁכֻרַת וְלֹא מִיָּיִן —“Drunk, but not from wine.” 
<b>A group.</b> Has the meaning of a gathering or group who are נֶאֻחָזִין יַחַד —held together.

### passuk 34
<b>Forty years old.</b> Eisov is compared to a pig as it is said: “The boar of the forest ravages it.” When the pig lies down it stretches out its hooves as if to say, “See, I am a clean animal.” So, too, these, the descendants of Eisov, rob and extort and make pretensions of being honorable. For [the first] forty years Eisov would kidnap wives from their husbands and take them forcibly; when he turned forty he said, “Father was forty when he married and I will do likewise.” 

### passuk 35
