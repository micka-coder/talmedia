### passuk 1
<b>I have made you a god to Pharaoh.</b> [אלקים means here] a judge and castigator, to castigate him with plagues and sufferings. 
<b>Will be your spokesman.</b> [נְבִיאֶךָ is] as Onkelos translates it: “your interpreter.” Similarly, wherever [you find] the term נְבוּאָה (prophecy) [it refers to] a person who proclaims and lets the nation hear words of admonition, and comes from the same root as נִיב שְׂפָתָיִם [or] יָנוּב חָכְמָה — “It utters wisdom,” [or] וַיְכַל מֵהִתְנַבּוֹת — “He ended proclaiming,” of the Book of Shmuel. In Old French he is called <i>preideor</i> — preacher. 

### passuk 2
<b>You will speak —</b> once, each and every message just as you heard it from Me and your brother Aharon will eloquently express it and make it palatable to the ears of Pharaoh. 

### passuk 3
<b>I will harden.</b> Since he acted wickedly and in opposition towards Me, and it is revealed to Me that the nations take no pleasure in wholeheartedly repenting, it is better for Me that his heart be hardened so that My signs be increased against him and you will thereby recognize My power. This is the way of Hashem: He brings punishment upon the wicked nations so that Israel may hear about it and fear [Him], as it is said: “I have cut off nations making their corners desolate... I said: If only you would fear Me then you (Israel) will accept admonition.” Nevertheless, concerning the first five plagues it does not say: “<i>Hashem</i> strengthened Pharaoh’s heart” but, “Pharaoh’s heart was strengthened.” 

### passuk 4
<b>My hand.</b> [אֶת יָדִי is to be understood] literally, the <i>hand</i> with which to strike them. 

### passuk 5

### passuk 6

### passuk 7

### passuk 8

### passuk 9
<b>A marvel.</b> A sign to make it known that there is power in the One Who sends you.

### passuk 10
<b>A serpent.</b> [לְתַנִּין means] a serpent.

### passuk 11
<b>With their magic art.</b> [Onkelos translates it as] בְּלַחֲשֵׁיהוֹן — “with their magic.” There is no comparable word [to בְּלַהֲטֵיהֶם] in Scripture. However, one may compare to it: “the לַהַט of the rotating sword,” for it appears to rotate [as if] by magic. 

### passuk 12
<b>Aharon’s rod swallowed.</b> After it became a rod again, did it swallow all the rest. 

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
<b>Is heavy.</b> The correct version of Onkelos is יַקִּיר — is <i> hard</i> and not אִתְיַקַּר — <i>hardened,</i> because it is an adjective as in: “the thing is too hard for you.” 

### passuk 15
<b>When he goes out to the water —</b> to relieve himself, for he made claims to be a god and said that he did not need to relieve himself. He would arise early and go out to the Nile and there relieve himself. 

### passuk 16
<b>Thus Far.</b> [The plain meaning of עַד כֹּה is:] thus far. But its midrashic explanation is: “until you will hear [the word כֹּה] from Me at the killing of the first-born, which I will begin with the word כֹה : [viz.] “ כֹּה — Thus did Hashem say at midnight.” 

### passuk 17
<b>It will turn into blood.</b> Since rain does not fall in Egypt and the Nile rises and irrigates the land, and the Egyptians worship the Nile, He therefore struck their god [first] and afterwards struck them. 

### passuk 18
<b>The Egyptians will weary themselves —</b> [attempting] to find a cure so that the waters of their river should be fit to drink.

### passuk 19
<b>Say to Aharon.</b> Since the river protected Moshe when he was thrown into it, therefore it was not struck by him, neither at the plague of blood nor at the plague of frogs, but was struck by Aharon. 
<b>The rivers.</b> [נְהָרוֹת] are the flowing rivers, just like our rivers. 
<b>Their canals.</b> [יְאוֹרִים] are man-made irrigation canals that extend from the river’s edge to the fields. The waters of the Nile rise [periodically] and travel by way of the canals to irrigate the fields.
<b>Their lakes.</b> [אֲגַם is] a gathering of waters that do not spring up or flow but are stationary in one place, and called [in Old French] <i>estanc.</i> 
<b>Throughout all the land of Egypt.</b> Also in their bathhouses and the baths in their homes.
<b>In the wood and stones.</b> [Meaning] the water in the wooden vessels and the stone vessels.

### passuk 20

### passuk 21

### passuk 22
<b>With their magic art.</b> [בְּלָטֵיהֶם refers to a] magical incantation which is said ( בַּלָט ) secretly and in a ( לַחַשׁ ) whisper. Our Sages say: בְּלָטֵיהֶם refers to works of demons, whereas בְּלַהֲטֵיהֶם (v. 11) refers to witchcraft. 
<b>Pharaoh’s heart remained hardened — </b> by claiming, “You are doing this through witchcraft, you are importing straw to Efarayim — a city that is full of straw, you, too, are bringing witchcraft to Egypt which is full of witchcraft.” 

### passuk 23
<b>Even to this.</b> [I.e., neither] to the wonder of the rod that turned into a serpent, neither to this [wonder] of the blood. 

### passuk 24

### passuk 25
<b>[Seven] full [days passed].</b> [וַיִמָּלֵא refers to] <i>the number</i> of seven days that the river did not revert to its original condition. For each plague functioned for a quarter of a month, and for three quarters [of a month] he would caution and warn them. 

### passuk 26

### passuk 27
<b>If you refuse.</b> [וְאִם מָאֵן אַתָּה means:] If you are a refuser מָאֵן meaning the same as מְמָאֵן “one who refuses”) or מְסָרֵב — “one who refuses.” [The difference being] only that it is describing a person based on an ongoing action, similar to שָׁלֵו — “a person at ease,” [or] שָׁקֵט — “a person serene” [or] סַר וְזָעֵף — “a person with anger.” 
<b>I will plague all of your borders.</b> [נֹגֵף means] striking a blow. Similarly, every form of the word מַגֵּפָה does not [necessarily] refer to killing, but, rather, refers to striking. Similarly, “They will strike ( וְנָגְפוּ ) a pregnant woman” does not refer to killing. Similarly, “Before your feet ( יִתְנַגְּפוּ ) strike against something,” [or] “Lest your feet ( תִּגּוֹף ) strike a stone,” [or] “And as a stumbling stone.” 

### passuk 28
<b>They will emerge</b> — from the river.
<b>Into your house</b> — and afterwards in your servants’ houses. [Since] he initiated the plan at the beginning: “He said to his nation” (1, 9), therefore the punishment began with him. 

### passuk 29
<b>Upon you and upon your people.</b> They would enter their intestines and croak.
