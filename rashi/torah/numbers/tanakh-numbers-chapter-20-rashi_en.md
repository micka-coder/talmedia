<b>The entire community.</b> The entire, perfect community. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Those who were to die in the desert had already perished, and these were set apart to live. 
<b>Miriam died there.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Why is the portion concerning Miriam’s death adjacent to the portion of the <i>parah adumah</i>? To teach you that, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>just as the sacrifices bring atonement, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>so do the deaths of the righteous bring atonement. 
<b>Miriam died there.</b> She, too, died <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>by the Divine kiss. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Why, then, is it not said, concerning her, “by the mouth of God”? Because this would be lacking in reverence toward the Supreme Being. Concerning Aharon, however, it is said, “by the mouth of God,” in “these are the journeys.” 

### passuk 2
<b>The community had no water.</b> From here [we derive] that all forty years they had <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the well in Miriam’s merit. 

### passuk 3
<b>Would that we had died.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>We wish that we had died.
<b>By our brothers’ death.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>By our brothers’ death from the plague, as death from thirst is more dreadful. 
<b>By . . . death.</b> This is a noun, like בְּמִיתַת אַחֵינוּ, “by our brother’s death.” But it is incorrect to interpret this as “when our brothers died,” for, if so, the vocalization should have been בִּגְו‍ֹעַ .

<b>And their livestock.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>From here [we derive] that the Holy One, Blessed is He, is solicitous of the Israelites’ property.

<b>Assembled, etc.</b> This is one of the places <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>where a small area held a large multitude. 
<b>Can we extract from this rock?</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because they did not recognize it, as the rock settled itself among the other rocks when the well departed. The Israelites were telling them, “What [difference] is it to you, from which rock you extract water for us”? This is why he addressed them as “rebels “—”insolents,” “fools” in Greek. Those who instruct their instructors. Can we extract water from this rock for which we were not commanded? 

### passuk 11
<b>Twice.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because at first, it only produced drops, since the Omnipresent had not commanded to strike it, but “speak to the rock.” They spoke to a different rock, but it did not produce. They said, “perhaps it must be struck, like the first one,” as it is said, “strike the rock.” Then they happened upon that rock and he struck it. 

### passuk 12
<b>Because you did not believe in Me.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Scripture reveals that <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>if it had not been for this single sin, they would have entered the land, so that it would not be said of them: <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”Like the transgressions of the rest of the generation of the desert, against whom it was decreed not to enter the land— so was the transgression of Moshe and Aharon.” But <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>was not [the transgression implied in the verse] “will sheep and cattle be slaughtered”? worse than this? Still, because it was said in private, Scripture was compassionate with him, but here, where it was in the presence of all of Israel, Scripture was not compassionate with him, because of the sanctification of the Name. 
<b>To sanctify me.</b> For, if you had spoken to the rock and it had brought forth water, I would have been sanctified in the eyes of the community. They would have said: “Now this rock, which can neither speak nor hear, and does not require sustenance, fulfills the word of the Omnipresent. How much more should we do so.” 
<b>Therefore, you will not bring.</b> This was said as an oath, like “Therefore, I swore to the house of Eili.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He swore precipituously, so that they would not engage in lengthy prayer. 

### passuk 13
<b>They are the waters of dispute.</b> They are the ones mentioned elsewhere. Pharaoh’s astrologers saw them, [seeing] that the saviour of Israel would be smitten through water. Therefore, they decreed that “every boy who is born must be thrown into the river.” 
<b>He was sanctified through them.</b> Since Moshe and Aharon died because of them. When the Holy One, Blessed is He, administers judgment against His holy ones, He is feared and sanctified by mankind. Similarly, it says, “You are awesome, God, from Your sanctuaries.” Similarly, it says, “I am sanctified by those close to Me.” 

### passuk 14
<b>Your brother Yisroel.</b> Why did Moshe see fit to mention brotherhood here? But he said to him, “We are brothers, children of Avrohom, to whom it was said, ‘[Know] . . . that your descendants will be strangers [in a land that is not theirs]’, and we were both responsible for fulfilling that obligation.” 
<b>You know of all the hardship.</b> Therefore, your father parted from our father, as it is said, “he went to a land because of his brother Yaakov” — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>because of the bill of debt incumbent upon them, he placed the burden on Yaakov. 

### passuk 15
<b>[The Egyptians] mistreated us.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>We endured much suffering.
<b>And our forefathers.</b> From here we derive <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that the forefathers suffer in the grave when punishment is visited on Israel.

### passuk 16
<b>And He heard our voice.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Through the blessing bestowed by our forefather [Yitzchak], “the voice is the voice of Yaakov.” For, we cry out, and are answered. 
<b>An emissary.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This refers to Moshe. From here we derive that the prophets are called “emissaries” It also says, “they would insult the emissaries of God.” 

### passuk 17
<b>Please let us to pass through your land.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>You should not challenge the inheritance of the land of Israel, as you did not pay the debt. Do, for us, the small favor of passing through your land. 
<b>We will not drink well water.</b> It should have said, “cistern water.” But this is what Moshe said: <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”Although we have in our possession manna to eat and the well [water] to drink, we will not drink from it, but we will buy food and drink from you, for your benefit.” From here [we derive] that, although a guest has provisions in his possession, he should buy from the shopkeeper, in order to benefit his host. 
<b>We will travel by the king’s road.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>We will muzzle our animals, so that they will not turn every which way to eat. 

### passuk 18
<b>Lest I go out against you with the sword.</b> You pride yourselves with the voice you inherited from your forefather, saying, “we cried out to God, and he heard our voice.” Well, I will go out against you <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>with my forefather’s legacy, “you shall live by your sword.” 

### passuk 19
<b>It is just nothing.</b> Nothing at all will harm you.

### passuk 20
<b>And a strong hand.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>With our grandfather’s assurance, “but the hands are the hands of Eisav.” 

### passuk 21

### passuk 22
<b>The entire community.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>All of them, perfect, ready to enter the land. Not one of them was among those included in the decree, for those who were to die in the wilderness, had perished. These were among those of whom Scripture states, “You are all living this day.” 
<b>Mount Hor (lit. the mountain of the mountain).</b> A mountain on top of a mountain, like a small apple on top of a large apple. Although the cloud went before them to flatten the mountains, three mountains remained; Mount Sinai for the Torah, Mount Hor for Aharon’s burial, and Mount Nevo for Moshe’s burial, 

### passuk 23
<b>At the border of the land of Edom.</b> This teaches, that because they joined here in associating with the evil Eisav, a breach was made in their activities, and they lost this righteous man. Similarly, the prophet says to Yehoshafat, “when you joined with Achazyahu, God caused a breach in your activities.” 

### passuk 24

### passuk 25
<b>Take Aharon.</b> With comforting words. Say to him, “How fortunate you are to see your crown handed over to your son— something which I do not merit.” 

### passuk 26
<b>[His] vestments.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>In the vestments of the <i>kehunah Gedolah</i>, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>he dressed him, and then removed them from him, in order to place them on his son in his presence. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He said to him, “Enter the cave.” He entered. He saw a bed made ready and a candle burning. He said, “Go up on the bed.” He went up. “Extend your hands.” He extended them. “Close your mouth.” He closed it. “Shut your eyes.” He shut them. Moshe at once desired to die such a death. This is why it was said to him, “The way your brother Aharon died”— The death which you desired. 

### passuk 27
<b>Moshe did.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Although the matter was difficult for him, he did not hesitate. 

### passuk 28

### passuk 29
<b>The entire community saw.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>When they saw Moshe and Elozor descending, and Aharon did not desend, they said,”Where is Aharon”? He said to them, “He died.” They said, “Can it be that someone who stood up to the angel and stopped the plague is under the dominion of the angel of death”? Moshe immediately begged for mercy, and the ministering angels showed him to them, lying in the bed. They saw, and believed. 
<b>The entire house of Yisroel.</b> Men and women, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>because Aharon pursued peace, and instilled affection between antagonists, and between husband and wife. 
<b>That [Aharon] died.</b> I say that anyone who translates [כִּי גָוַע as] דְּהָא מִית (“because [Aharon] died”), is mistaken, unless he also translates וַיִּרְאוּ as וְאִתְחֲזִיאוּ ([The community] “was exposed”). Since the Rabbis’ comment, that כִּי here is understood as “because,” is valid only according to the Midrashic comment that the clouds of glory departed, as R’ Abohu said, “do not read וַיִּרְאוּ (‘they [the community] saw,’), but וַיֵּרָאוּ, (‘they [the community] were exposed’).” According to this interpretation, דְּהָא (“because”), is the proper usage, since it clarifies what precedes it. Why were they exposed? Because Aharon died. However, according to Targum [Onkelos who translates] “the entire community saw,” “because” is not the proper usage, but “that,” from the אִי meaning, as we find אִם meaning “that.” As in, “that [I ask], why shouldn’t I be distressed”?Sf? and many clear usages in this sense, [like] “that his days are designated.”
