<b>Would we had died.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Would that we had died.

### passuk 3

### passuk 4
<b>Let us appoint (lit. place) a head.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] renders, “Let us appoint a head,” ‘Let us appoint a king over us.’ The Rabbis, of blessed memory, interpret this as referring to idolatry. 

### passuk 5

### passuk 9
<b>Do not rebel.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Consequently, “and you do not be afraid, etc.
<b>For they are [as] our bread.</b> We will consume them <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>like bread. 
<b>Their protection (lit. shade) is removed from them.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Their shield and strength. The righteous among them have died — Iyov, who shielded them with his merit. (Another interpretation: The Omnipresent’s shield has been removed from them.) 

### passuk 10
<b>They should be stoned.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Yehoshua and Caleiv.
<b>When the glory of Adonoy.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The Cloud descended there. 

### passuk 11
<b>Until where.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>To what degree.
<b>Will . . . provoke me.</b> [יְנַאֲצוּנִי means] will they anger me.
<b>Despite all the signs.</b> Because of all the miracles I performed for them, they should have believed that I am capable of fulfilling my promise. 

### passuk 12
<b>And [I will] annihilate them.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>As Targum [Onkelos] renders it, meaning annihilation. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Perhaps you will ask, ‘what will I do about the oath to the patriarchs’? 
<b>I shall make you into a greater nation.</b> As you are descended from them.

### passuk 13
<b>But Egypt will hear.</b> They will hear <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that You killed them.
<b>That You . . . brought up.</b> כִּי is used to denote “that.” And they saw that You brought them up, with Your great power, from among them. When they hear that You killed them, they will not say that they sinned against You. Rather, they will say that, against them, You were able to wage war, but against the inhabitants of the land, You were not able to wage war. This is [the meaning of the following]: 

### passuk 14
<b>They will say, concerning (lit. to) the inhabitants of this land.</b> Like עַל, “concerning” the inhabitants of this land. What will they say about them? What is said at the end of the subject, because of Hashem’s inability. Since they have heard that You, God, dwell in their midst, and You, Hashem, are revealed to them before their eyes, all in a loving way, and they are not aware that Your love for them was removed from them, until now. 

### passuk 15
<b>If You kill this nation like a single man.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Suddenly. As a result, the nations who have heard etc. 

### passuk 16
<b>Because of [Adonoy’s] inability.</b> Because the inhabitants of the land are strong and valorous, and Pharaoh is not the same as thirty-one kings. This is what they will say about the inhabitants of this land. <b>Because of inability.</b> Since He was not able to bring them, He slaughtered them. 
<b>[In]ability.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This is an abstract noun.

### passuk 17
<b>Let my Master’s power be enhanced.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>By fulfilling Your word.
<b>As You spoke, saying:</b> What is the statement? 

### passuk 18
<b>Adonoy, slow to anger.</b> At the righteous and at the wicked. When Moshe ascended on high, he found the Holy One, Blessed is He, sitting and writing, “Hashem is slow to anger.” He (Moshe) said to Him, ‘to the righteous’? The Holy One, Blessed is He, said to him, ‘even to the wicked’! He (Moshe) said to Him, ‘let the wicked perish’! He said to him ‘by your life, you will need this thing.’ When the Israelites sinned with the [golden] calf and the spies, Moshe prayed before Him with “slow to anger.” The Holy One, Blessed is He, said: “But you said to Me ‘to the righteous”’? He (Moshe) said to Him: “But You said to me, ‘Even to the wicked’.” 
<b>Acquit.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Those who repent.
<b>[He] does not acquit.</b> Those who do not repent.

### passuk 19

### passuk 20
<b>As you spoke.</b> Because of your statement, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”lest they say, ‘because of Hashem’s inability’.” 

### passuk 21
<b>However.</b> Like, ‘However, I will do the following to them.
<b>As I Live.</b> This denotes an oath. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Just as I live and My glory will fill all the earth, so shall I fulfill to them, “for, all the people who see, etc. . . . If they will see the land.” 

### passuk 22
<b>Have tested Me.</b> Like its plain meaning.
<b>These ten times.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Twice at the [splitting of the] sea, twice with the manna, twice with the quail, etc., as stated in Maseches Arachin. 

### passuk 23
<b>If they will see.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>They will not see. <b>(If they will see the land.</b> This passage should be rearranged [as follows]: As I live, for all the men, if they will see the land and yet My glory will fill all the earth, so that My Name will not be desecrated through this plague [by those] saying ‘Because of Hashem’s inability to bring them.’ for, I will not kill them suddenly, like a single man, but over forty years, little by little.) 
<b>[They] will not see it.</b> They will not see the land.

### passuk 24
<b>A different spirit.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Two spirits, one verbal, and one in his heart. To the spies he said, ‘I am with you in your plan,’ but in his heart he intended to tell the truth. Because of this, he was able to silence them, as it is said, “Caleiv silenced [the people],” since they thought he would speak as they did. Thus it is said in the book of Yehoshua, “I (Caleiv) brought back word to him (Moshe) <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>according to what was in my heart — but not according to what was in my mouth. 
<b>And followed Me fully.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He followed Me full-heartedly. This is a shortened passage.
<b>To which he came.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Chevron will be given to m.
<b>Will cast out [the inhabitants] from it.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] renders it, “they will cast out from it.” They will cast out the giants and the people who are in it. But it should not be translated “will inherit it,” unless the text reads יִירָשֶׁנָּה . 

### passuk 25
<b>The Amaleki, etc.</b> If you go there <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>they will kill you, since I am not with you. 
<b>Tomorrow, turn.</b> Back and travel, etc. 

### passuk 26

### passuk 27
<b>Wicked congregation, etc.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>These are the spies. From here [we derive] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that a congregation is ten. 
<b>Those who provoke.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The Israelites against me.
<b>The complaints of Bnei Yisroel which they,</b> the spies provoked them into complaining against me, I have heard. 

### passuk 28
<b>As I live.</b> This denotes an oath. ‘If [I do] not, etc., so I shall do, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>if it were possible to say, I do not live. 
<b>As you have spoken.</b> You requested from Me, “Or would that we had died in this desert.” 

### passuk 29
<b>All of you who were counted according to your numbers.</b> All those counted in every census in which you were counted. For example, going and coming with the army, and contributing the <i>shekolim</i>. Everyone counted in all those tallies will die. They are the following: From the age of twenty, etc. This excludes the tribe of Levi, who were not counted from the age of twenty. 

### passuk 30

### passuk 31

### passuk 32
<b>Your corpses — yours.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] renders [(דִי לְכוֹן) “yours”]. Since He discussed <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>bringing the children into the land, and He now wants to say ‘but you will die,’ it is appropriate, here, to say “yours.” 

### passuk 33
<b>Forty years.</b> Not one of them died <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>before the age of sixty. This is why the decree was for forty [years], so that those who were twenty years old would reach the age of sixty. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The first year was included, although it preceded the sending of the spies, because, from the time that they made the golden calf, the plan for this decree was formulated, But He waited until their measure was filled. This is [the meaning of] what is said, “on my day of reckoning — with the spies — I will take their sin into account.” Here, too, it is said, “you must bear your sins,” [plural] two sins, that of the calf, and that of the complaint. In calculating their ages, He considered <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>part of the year as the whole, so that when they entered their sixtieth year, those who had been twenty years old died. 
<b>They will bear [the burden of] your dissoluteness.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] renders, “they will receive [punishment for] your sins.” 

### passuk 34
<b>My displeasure.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>You diverted your hearts from following Me. תְּנוּאָה denotes turning away, like, “for her father restrained her [from her vow].” 

### passuk 35

### passuk 36
<b>Who returned and provoked [the] complaints against him.</b> When they returned from spying on the land, they incited the entire congregation against him by issuing a derogatory report — those men died. הוֹצָאַת דִּבָּה always denotes directed speech, where the tongue is plied to report about someone, like, “causing the lips of sleepers to murmur.” It may be either good or bad. This is why it says here “who spread evil slander against the land,” since דִּבָּה may be good. 
<b>Slander.</b> <i>Parlerie</i> in Old French.

### passuk 37
<b>In a plague, before Adonoy.</b> By the particular death suited to them, measure for measure. They sinned with the tongue, so their tongues were distended until their navel, and maggots came from their tongues and entered their navel. This is why it says, בַּמַּגֵּפָה, and not בְּמַּגֵּפָה . And this is [the meaning of] “before Hashem” — as particularly suited to them, according to the attributes of the Holy One, Blessed is He, Who metes out measure for measure. 

### passuk 38
<b>Yehoshua . . . and Caleiv . . . lived, etc.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>What does the Torah teach by saying, “lived, from among those men”? It teaches that they took the spies’ portion in the land, replacing them in life. 

### passuk 39

### passuk 40
<b>To the peak of the mountain.</b> This was the route going up to Eretz Yisroel.
<b>We are ready to go up to the place.</b> To Eretz Yisroel.
<b>Of which Adonoy spoke.</b> To give to us — let us go up there.
<b>For we have sinned.</b> Since we said, “Is it not better for us to return to Egypt.” 

### passuk 41
<b>It will not succeed.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Your actions will not succeed.

### passuk 42

### passuk 43
<b>For, you turned.</b> As if to say, ‘for this will befall you <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>because you turned, etc.’ 

### passuk 44
<b>They defiantly.</b> The word [וַיַעְפִּלוּ] denotes strength. Similarly, “behold, [the wicked] are towering.” <i>Engres,</i> in Old French, denoting willfulness. Similarly, “the fortress of the daughter of Zion,” “fortress and stronghold.” But Midrash Tanchuma explains it as denoting darkness — they went in darkness, without permission. 

### passuk 45
<b>And crushed them.</b> Like, “I crushed it, grinding it [well].” Blow after blow. 
<b>Until Chormah.</b> The place was named <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to commemorate this incident.
