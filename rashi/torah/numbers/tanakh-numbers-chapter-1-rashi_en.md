<b>However, the tribe of Levi you shall not count.</b> The King’s legion is worthy of being <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>counted separately. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Another interpretation; the Holy One, blessed is He, foresaw that a decree would arise against all those who were counted from the age of twenty and above to die in the desert. He [therefore] said, “Let these [Levites] not be included, for they are mine, since they did not sin with the [golden] calf.”

<b>So that there will not be anger.</b> If you fulfill My commandments there will not be anger, but if not — if strangers will enter into this service of theirs — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>there will be anger, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>as we find in the episode of Korach, “. . . for the anger had emerged . . .” [17:11]
