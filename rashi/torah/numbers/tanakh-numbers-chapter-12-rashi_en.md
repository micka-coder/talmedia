### passuk 1
<b>[Miriam] spoke.</b> דִּבּוּר always connotes harshness, as it says, “The man who rules the land spoke harshly with us.” But אֲמִירָה always connotes pleading, as it says, “He said, please, my brothers, do not be wicked,” “He said, please hear my words.” נָא always connotes a request. 
<b>Miriam and Aharon spoke.</b> She opened the discussion first, so Scripture gives her precedence. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>How did Miriam know that Moshe separated from his wife? R’ Noson says: Miriam was at Tziporah’s side when Moshe was told that Eldad and Meidad were prophesying in the camp. When Tziporah heard, she said, ‘Woe to their wives if they become attached to prophecy, because they will separate from their wives the way my husband separated from me.’ Miriam knew from there, and she told Aharon. Now if Miriam, who did not intend to slander him, was punished this way, certainly someone who relates slander about his fellow. 
<b>The Cushite woman.</b> This teaches that everyone agreed to her beauty, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>just as everyone agrees to the blackness of the Cushite. 
<b>Cushite.</b> [כּוּשִׁית is] numerically equivalent to יְפַת מַרְאֶה, (“beautiful in appearance.”) 
<b>Concerning the woman.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Concerning her divorce.
<b>For, he married a Cushite woman.</b> What does the Torah teach? You find a woman beautiful in appearance but not beautiful in deed; in deed, but not in appearance. But this one was beautiful in everything. 
<b>The Cushite woman.</b> Because of her beauty, she was called “Cushite,” like a man who calls his attractive son “Cushite” to ward off the power of the evil eye over him. 
<b>For, he married a Cushite woman.</b> And now divorced her. 

### passuk 2
<b>Is it only.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>With him alone that God spoke.
<b>Did He not also [speak] with us.</b> Yet we did not abstain from marital relations.

### passuk 3
<b>Humble.</b> Bent low and forbearing.

### passuk 4
<b>Suddenly.</b> He revealed Himself to them <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>suddenly, when they were ritually unclean because of marital relations, and they cried, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”Water! Water!” To inform them that Moshe acted properly in separating from his wife, since the Divine Presence revealed Itself to him constantly, with no designated time for the Word. 
<b>Come out, all three of you.</b> This teaches that all three were summoned with a single word, which is impossible for the mouth to say and the ear to hear. 

### passuk 5
<b>In a pillar of cloud.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He went alone, unlike the custom of mortals. When a mortal king goes to war, he goes out with a large retinue, when he goes in peace, he goes with only a few. But the custom of the Holy One, Blessed is He, is to go to war alone, as it is said, “[God is] a warrior,” and goes in peace with a large retinue, as is said, “God rides with twenty two thousand angels.” 
<b>He called [to] Aharon and Miriam.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>So that they would be drawn away and leave the courtyard towards the Word.
<b>Both of them went out.</b> Why did He draw them away and separate them from Moshe? Because we recite some of a person’s qualities in his presence, and all of them when he is not present. We find this about Noach. When he was not present it is said, “A righteous man, flawless,” but in his presence it is said, “For I have seen that you are righteous before Me.” Another interpretation: So that he should not hear Aharon’s rebuke. 

### passuk 6
<b>Please listen to my words.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i> נָא is interpreted strictly as a request.
<b>If there will be your prophet.</b> If <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>you will have prophets.
<b>[I,] Adonoy will make Myself known to him in a vision.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The Divine Presence of My Name will not be revealed to him in the illuminated reflection, but in a dream and vision. 

### passuk 7

### passuk 8
<b>Mouth to mouth.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I told him to separate from his wife. Where did I tell him? At Sinai, “Go tell them ‘Return to your tents,’ but you remain with Me here.” 
<b>In a vision, and not in riddles.</b> “In a vision” — this is the vision of the word, for I explain My word to him in the clearest form, I do not conceal it in riddles the way it was said to Yechezkel, “Present a riddle, etc.” Perhaps [this refers to] the vision of the Divine Presence? The Torah teaches, “you cannot see My Presence.” 
<b>He gazes at the likeness of Adonoy.</b> This is the vision of the back, according to what is said, “But you may see what is behind Me.” 
<b>About My servant, about Moshe.</b> It does not say, ‘about My servant Moshe,’ but ‘about My servant, about Moshe’ — about My servant, even if he were not Moshe, about Moshe, even if he were not My servant, It would have been appropriate for you to have been in awe of him. Certainly since he is My servant, and the king’s servant is [as] the king. You should have said, ‘The king does not love him gratuitously.’ And if you say that <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I am not aware of his actions, then this (statement) is worse than the first! 

### passuk 9
<b>Adonoy’s anger flared against them and He left.</b> After He informed them of their reprehensible behavior, He decreed excommunication against them. Certainly a mortal, then, should not be angry with his fellow until he informs him of his reprehensible behavior. 

### passuk 10
<b>The cloud departed.</b> Afterward, “Behold, Miriam was leprous, like snow.” This is compared to a king who said to a pedagogue, ‘Punish my son, but do not punish him until I leave, as I pity him.’ 

### passuk 11
<b>We have foolishly done.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] translates, from the word אֱוִיל, “fool.” 

### passuk 12
<b>Please, let her not be,</b> this our sister. 
<b>Like the dead.</b> Since the leper is considered dead. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Just as the dead cause ritual defilement when entering [a room], so does the leper cause ritual defilement when entering. 
<b>That, since he came from his mother’s womb.</b> “<i>Our</i> mother” should have been said, but Scripture euphemises. Similarly, “half his flesh” — “half <i>our</i> flesh” should have been said, but Scripture euphemises. That, since she came from our mother’s womb, [what] she [suffers] is ours, as if half our flesh were eaten away. This is similar to what is said, “for he is our brother, our flesh.” The simple interpretation also appears the same. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>It is unconscionable for a brother to allow his sister to remain as if dead. 
<b>That, since he came.</b> Since he [also] came from the mother’s womb of this one who has the power to help but does not, then half his own flesh is eaten away, as his brother, is his flesh. Another interpretation [of] “Please, let her not be like the dead.” If you do not heal her through prayer, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>who will confine her, and who will purify her? I can not possibly examine her, as I am related, and a relative cannot examine the symptoms of leprosy. And there is no other <i>kohein</i> in the world. This is [what is meant by] “that, since he came from his mother’s womb.” 

### passuk 13
<b>Please, God, please heal her.</b> Scripture comes to teach proper behavior — that one who requests something from his fellow must say two or three words of supplication, then, afterward, make his requests. 
<b>Saying.</b> What does the Torah teach? He (Moshe) said to Him, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>‘Answer me, [as to] whether or not You will cure her’ — until He did answer, “If her father were to spit, etc.” R’ Elazar son of Azariah said, in four places, Moshe asked the Holy One, Blessed is He, that He answer him [as to] whether or not He would grant his requests. Similarly, “Moshe spoke before God, saying, etc.” What does the Torah teach by writing “saying”? ‘Answer me [as to] whether or not You will redeem them’ — until He did answer him, “Now you will see, etc.” Similarly, “Moshe spoke to God, saying, ‘let God, the God of the spirit of all flesh, appoint’.” He answered: “Take for you.” Similarly, “I pleaded with God at that time, saying.” He answered him, “Enough, for you.” 
<b>Please heal her.</b> Why did not Moshe pray at length? So that the Israelites should not say, “His sister is suffering, and he stands and prolongs his prayer.” (Another interpretation: So that the Israelites should not say, For his sister he prays at length, but for us he does not pray at length). 

### passuk 14
<b>If (lit. “and”) her father were to spit in her face.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>If her father were to display, to her, an angry face, would she not be humiliated for seven days? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Certainly, then, in the case of the Divine Presence, [she should be humiliated] for fourteen days. However, it is sufficient that the derivative equal the source of its derivation. Therefore, even with My rebuke, let her be confined for seven days. 
<b>And after that, she may join again.</b> I say that all אֲסִיפוֹת mentioned regarding lepers are related to his expulsion from the camp. When he is cured, he is brought into the camp. Thus, אֲסִיפָה is written concerning him, meaning bringing in. 

### passuk 15
<b>The people did not depart.</b> This honor was accorded her by the Omnipresent for <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the one hour she remained with Moshe when he was cast into the river, as it is said, “his sister stood from afar, etc.
