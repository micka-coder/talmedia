### passuk 1
<b>When a person brings.</b> “A person” [literally, “a soul”] is not mentioned regarding all the voluntary offerings except the meal-offering. Who is accustomed to bring a meal-offering? A poor person. Said God: I consider him as though he had offered his [own] soul. 
<b>His offering shall be of fine flour.</b> Whoever says: <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I am obligated [to bring] a meal-offering without specifying [which one] must bring a fine-flour meal-offering, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>which is the first of the meal-offerings [mentioned], [special in that] its fistful is taken while it is [still] fine flour, as is explained in this section. Since five types of meal-offerings are mentioned here, and all of them are baked before the fistful is taken except for this one, therefore it is called a fine-flour meal-offering. 
<b>Fine flour.</b> Fine flour comes only from wheat, as it is said, “fine wheat flour” and no meal-offering [uses] less than a tenth [of an <i>ephah</i>], as it is said, “a tenth [of an <i>ephah</i>] fine flour . . . per meal-offering” — a tenth for each meal-offering. 
<b>He shall pour oil upon it,</b> on all of it, 
<b>and place frankincense upon it,</b> on part of it. He places a fistful of frankincense on it on one side. Why do you say so? For there is no inclusion after inclusion in the Torah <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>but to exclude. Another interpretation: Oil [is poured] on all of it, because it [= the oil] is mixed with it and its fistful is taken with it, as it is said, “[he takes from there its fistful] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>from its flour and from its oil,” and the frankincense [is placed] on part of it, since it is not mixed with it and its fistful is not taken with it, as it is said, <b>with all its frankincense,</b> for after he takes the fistful he gathers frankincense — all of it — from over it and burns it. 
<b>He shall pour, and he shall place, he shall bring [to the sons of Aharon],</b> this teaches that pouring and mixing <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>are valid when done by a non-<i>kohein</i>. 

### passuk 2
<b>The kohanim, and he takes [his] fistful — </b>from the taking of the fistful onward is a mitzvoh [which must be fulfilled] by the כְּהוּנָה . 
<b>He takes [his] fistful from there — </b>from the place the feet of a non-<i>kohein</i> stand — to teach you that the taking of the fistful is valid throughout the courtyard, even in the eleven <i>amoh</i>s of the place where Israelites may step. 
<b>his full fistful.</b> Perhaps it must be full to overflowing — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>spilling out at every side? The verse says in another place, “he shall separate from <i>it</i>“ — only that which is within the fistful should be valid. If [it is written] “in his fistful,” perhaps it [may be offered] less than full? The verse says: “full.” How is this [done]? He covers the palm of his hand [with] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>three fingers, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and this is the meaning of a “fistful” in the Hebrew language. 
<b>With</b> <b>all its frankincense,</b> the fistful should be full, aside from the frankincense. 
<b>Its frankincense and he shall burn — </b>the frankincense <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>must also be burned.
<b>His fistful from its flour and its oil — </b>thus if he took the fistful, and a grain of salt came into his hand or <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>a particle of frankincense [came into his hand] it is not valid. 
<b>Its memorial portion,</b> the fistful which goes up to [the altar] to the Most High is the memorial of the meal-offering, because with it its owners are remembered for good and [having caused] satisfaction. 

### passuk 3
<b>To Aharon and his sons.</b> The <i>kohein</i> <i>Godol</i> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>takes a portion first, without [having to participate in a] distribution, [while] an ordinary <i>kohein</i> [shares in the] distribution. 
<b>Holy of holies,</b> it is for them which is 
<b>of the fire-offerings of Adonoy.</b> They have no part of it until <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>after the fire-offering [= the fistful] was made.

### passuk 4
<b>And when you bring, etc.</b> For he said: I am obligated to bring a meal-offering <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>baked in an oven. The verse teaches us that he should bring either matzoh-loaves <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>or matzoh wafers, the loaves mixed [with oil] and the wafers smeared [with oil]. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Our Rabbis disagree on their smearing; some say he smears them again and again until all the oil in the לוֹג is used up, because all the meal offerings require a לוֹג of oil, and some say he smears [the oil in the shape] like [that of the Greek letter] “chi” [÷], and the remainder is eaten by the <i>kohanim</i> separately. Why does the verse say: ‘‘in oil . . . in oil’’ twice? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>To permit oil of the second or third [pressing] issuing from the olives. Oil of the first [pressing] is required only for the Menoroh, for [the word] ‘‘pure’’ is said [in connection] with it. We learned in [Maseches] Menochos: All the meal-offerings which are baked before their fistful is taken, and their fistful is taken by breaking [the loaves or wafers into pieces] — all of them come [in groups] of <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>ten loaves, and those of which it is said ‘‘wafers’’ come [in groups] of ten wafers. 

### passuk 5
<b>And if a pan-baked meal-offering,</b> for he said: I am obligated [to bring] a pan-baked meal-offering. [The pan] was a vessel [used] in the Temple, in which they would bake this meal-offering in oil on the fire; the vessel was not deep but flat, and the resulting meal-offering made in it was hard, since it was flat, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the fire burnt the oil. And all of them require three applications of oil: <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>pouring, mixing <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and placing of oil in the vessel before they are prepared. 
<b>Fine flour mixed with oil, </b>[this] teaches that he mixes them while they are still flour. 

### passuk 6
<b>Break it into pieces,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to include all the meal-offerings which are baked before their fistful is taken [to be included] in [the law of] “breaking into pieces.” 
<b>Pour oil on it; it is a meal-offering — </b>to include all the meal-offerings [in the requirement] of “pouring.” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Perhaps even a meal-offering baked in an oven [requires pouring]? The verse says: “on it.” Should I exclude the loaves and not exclude the wafers? The verse says: “It.”

### passuk 7
<b>Pan.</b> This is a vessel which was in the Temple, [which was] deep, and because it was deep, its oil was gathered [at its bottom], and the fire did not burn it. Therefore, the resulting meal-offering within it appeared as though it was creeping everything soft because of the liquid contained in it appears as though [it is] creeping and moving. 

### passuk 8
<b>That will be made in any of these,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in any of these types. 
<b>[And] he</b> — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the owners — <b>shall bring it,</b> to the <i>kohein.</i> 
<b>And he [the kohein] will present it to the altar.</b> He presents it <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to the southwest corner of the altar. 

### passuk 9
<b>Its memorial portion,</b> that is <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the fistful. 

### passuk 10

### passuk 11
<b>And all honey.</b> Any <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>sweet [juice] of a fruit is called “honey.”

### passuk 12
<b>You shall bring them as a first [fruit-]offering.</b> What must you bring from sourdough and from honey? A first [fruit]-offering — two [loaves of] bread of Shavuos which come from sourdough, as it is said, “unleavened shall they be baked” [along with] first-fruits from the honey, such as the first-fruits of figs and dates. 

### passuk 13
<b>Salt, covenant.</b> For a covenant was made for salt from the Six Days of Creation, when the lower waters were promised to be brought onto the altar in the form of salt <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and the water-offering on Sukkos. 
<b>On every offering,</b> on the burnt-offering of [domestic] animal and bird and on the fat-portions of all sacrifices in general. 

### passuk 14
<b>When you bring.</b> Behold, אִם functions <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>as meaning “when,” for this is not voluntary, since the verse deals with the <i>omer</i> meal-offering, which is obligatory. Similarly, “and <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>when there will be a jubilee year, etc.” 
<b>Meal-offering of first grains.</b> The verse deals with an <i>omer</i> meal-offering, which <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>comes fresh, at the time of the ripening of the crops, and it comes from barley: אָבִיב [“fresh, ripe”] it is stated here and “it is stated elsewhere” “the barley was green.” 
<b>Roasted over fire,</b> [It is parched,] since they dry it over fire in a roaster’s [perforated iron] tube, for were it not so, it could not be ground in a mill, for it is moist. 
<b>Ground kernels,</b> broken when yet moist. 
גֶרֶשׂ means “crushing” and “grinding.” He grinds it in a mill of grist-grinders, similar to [the meaning of <i>goras</i> in the verse] “he broke [my teeth] with gravel,” and similarly, “my soul is crushed.” 
<i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i><b>Kernels</b>, while the husk is full, when the grain is moist and full in its stalks. That is why the fresh ears [of corn] are called <i>karmel</i>, and similarly, “fresh ears [of corn] in his sack.”
