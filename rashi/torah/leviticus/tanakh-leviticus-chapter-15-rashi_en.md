<b>Should [discharge] flow.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Perhaps [a discharge] flowing from anywhere should be impure? The verse says, “from <i>his</i> flesh” — and not all his flesh. After the verse distinguished between flesh and flesh, I may argue: <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>[The Torah] declared a male with a discharge unclean and a female with a discharge unclean; just as a female with a discharge [has a flow] from a place from which she becomes unclean with a less severe impurity — נִדָּה, [from that same place] she becomes unclean with a severe impurity — זִיבָה — so [too] regarding a male with a discharge: from the place from which he becomes unclean <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>with a less severe impurity — קֶרִי, he becomes unclean with a severe impurity — זִיבָה . 
<b>His discharge, he is impure.</b> [This] teaches in regard to <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>a drop [of discharge] that it causes impurity. [This] discharge resembles water of dough made of barley, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and dissolved, and similar <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>to the white of an egg which is crushed; semen is thick, like the white of an egg that is not crushed.

<b>[His flesh] drips.</b> An expression [denoting] spittle — which drips from his flesh.
<b>[With] his discharge,</b> like spittle, it issues [in a] clear [form]. <b>Or [his flesh] be stopped up,</b> because [the discharge] issues [in a] thick [form], and closes up the opening of the membrum, and his flesh is closed up by the drop of his discharge — this is its plain meaning. And its midrashic interpretation: The first verse counts two sightings and calls him unclean, as it is said: “discharge [<i>zovo</i>] flows [<i>zov</i>] from the flesh — he is unclean;” and the second verse three sightings and called him unclean as it is said “his uncleanness is in his discharge [בְּזוֹבוֹ], his flesh drips [with] his discharge [זוֹבוֹ], or his flesh is clogged with his discharge [מִזּוֹבוֹ]; it is his uncleanness.” How is this possible? Two [sightings] for uncleanness, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and the third requires him [to bring] a sacrifice. 

### passuk 4
<b>Every bed [= anything that is used specifically for sleeping],</b> that which is fit for laying down on. Perhaps [this applies] even to [something used] specifically for another activity? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The verse says: “upon which he lies” — “which he lay [down on]” is not said, but upon “which he [customarily] lies” — something specifically [and] always [employed] for this. [This] excludes [an object] of which [workmen] say: <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>“Get up so that we can do our work!” 
<b>[On] which he sits.</b> “[On which] he sat” is not said, but “on which he [customarily] sits,” something specifically [and] always [employed] for this. 

### passuk 5
<b>A person who touches his bed.</b> [This] teaches [that] [sitting on] a bed [causes] a more severe [uncleanness] than [that transmitted] by touch, for this becomes a primary source, to cause uncleanness to people [who in turn] cause uncleanness to the clothes [they are wearing]. But touching which [does not involve] a bed is only <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>a secondary source of uncleanness, and only causes uncleanness to food and drink. 

### passuk 6
<b>Whoever sits on a vessel,</b> even if he did not touch [it], <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>even if ten vessels [lie] one on another, all cause impurity by means of “sitting,” <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and so [too] in regard to a bed. 

### passuk 7

### passuk 8
<b>If the zov spits on a ritually clean person,</b> and [the spittle] touches him or he carries it, [he becomes unclean], <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>because spittle causes uncleanness by means of carrying. 

### passuk 9
<b>Anything that is used for riding,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>even if he had not sat on it [when riding], for example the hold on the saddle which is called <i>arcon</i>, becomes impure by means of “riding.” [Likewise,] the saddle, which is called <i>alves</i> is unclean as being something to sit upon. 

### passuk 10
<b>Anyone who touches anything which is beneath him,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>[beneath] the <i>zov</i>. [This] comes to teach [us] regarding a saddle that one who touches it is unclean, [but] does not require washing clothes, and this is a severity of a bed over a saddle. 
<b>Whoever carries them — </b>[who carries] anything mentioned in regard to the matter of a <i>zov</i>, his discharge, his spit, his semen, his urine, his “sitting” and his “riding” — carrying them causes uncleanness to people, [who in turn] cause uncleanness to clothes [they are wearing]. 

### passuk 11
<b>And his hands were not rinsed in water.</b> As long <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>as he did not immerse [to cleanse himself] from his uncleanness, and even if his discharge ceased and he counted seven [clean days] and he is [still] lacking immersion — he causes uncleanness in all his [ways] of uncleanness. And the reason the verse expressed [the idea] of the immersion of the body of the <i>zov</i> with the phrase “washing of the hands” — is to teach you that [a person’s] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>hidden parts do not need to have water touch them, but [only] the exposed parts of the person’s body, such as the hands. 

### passuk 12
<b>And an earthenware vessel that [the zov] will touch.</b> Perhaps [it is unclean] even if he touches it from the outside, etc. as it is stated in Toras Kohanim until [the words]: “what [type] of touch is as though [he touched] all of it? Say: <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>this is [when one] causes it to move.” 

### passuk 13
<b>And when he (a zov) becomes ritually clean — </b><i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>when he stops [seeing a discharge].
<b>Seven days for his purification.</b> Seven days clean of the uncleanness of <i>zivoh</i>, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>that he not see a discharge, and all of them consecutive.

<b>They shall bathe in water.</b> This is a royal decree that a woman should become unclean as a result of marital relations. The reason [for her uncleanness] is not because of the touch of semen, for it is considered <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>contact with one’s inner parts [and is not considered a touch which transmits impurity]. 

### passuk 19
<b>When a woman has a discharge.</b> Perhaps [this refers to a discharge] from one of her organs? The verse says: “And she exposed the source of her blood,” [which implies] that only [that] blood causes uncleanness which comes from the womb. 
<b>The discharge will be blood in her body.</b> Her discharge is called a “discharge” to cause impurity only when it is red.
<b>In her menstrual impurity.</b> As [the verse] “and they shall drive him out of the world.” [This implies] that she is driven out of contact with everyone.
<b>She shall be in her menstrual impurity.</b> Even if she <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>only saw one sighting.

<b>If he is on the bed.</b> One who lies or sits on her bed or on her seat, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>even if he did not touch her, he too, is under the rule of the uncleanness mentioned in the verse above, which requires the washing of clothes. 
<b>On the vessel — </b>to include a saddle.
<b>When he touches it.</b> This speaks only of a saddle, which was included [midrashically] from [by the phrase] “on the vessel.” 
<b>When he touches it, he is unclean.</b> But is not required to wash his clothes, for touching a saddle does not cause a person to make his clothes unclean. 

### passuk 24
<b>Her menstrual impurity shall be on him.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Perhaps he will join her in her state — that [is,] if he has marital relations with her on the fifth day of her menstrual impurity he will only be unclean for [the remaining] three days, as she is? The verse says: “He will be unclean seven days.” Why does the verse say: “Her menstrual impurity will be on him”? Just as she causes impurity to people and earthenware vessels, so [too] he will cause impurity to people and earthenware vessels. 

### passuk 25
<b>Many days,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>three days. 
<b>Outside her menstrual cycle.</b> After the passing of the <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>seven days of her menstrual uncleanness.
<b>Or if [the discharge] flows</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>these three days, 
<b>after her menstrual cycle — </b>one day <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>after her menstrual cycle, she is a <i>zovoh</i>, and her status is determined by this section, not by the regulation of menstruation, for this one is required to count seven clean days and [bring a] sacrifice — while a menstruant woman is not required to count clean days, but will remain in her menstrual impurity for seven days, whether she sees [a discharge] or whether she does not see [a discharge within that time]. The [Rabbis] expounded in this section [the rule that] there are eleven days between the end of the menstrual period and the beginning of the [next] menstrual period, which if she sees [a discharge] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for three consecutive days during these eleven days she will become a <i>zovoh</i>.

<b>You shall separate.</b> [The word] נְזִירָה [means] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>separation, and so [too the words as used in the verse] “they have separated themselves, [moving] backwards [away from God]. So [too] “the one separate from his brothers.” 
<b>And they will not die because of their impurity.</b> Thus the “being cut off” (כָּרֵת) of <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>one who causes impurity to the sanctuary is called “death.”

### passuk 32
<b>This is the law of the zov — </b>one who has had one sighting — and what is his rule?
<b>And of him from whom semen issues — </b>he is like one who has had an involuntary seminal emission (בַּעַל קֶרִי), [and] is unclean [until] evening. 

### passuk 33
<b>And for one who has a discharge,</b> [that is,] <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>one who has had two sightings, and one who has had three sightings, whose rule is explained above.
