<b>Who will slaughter an ox [or] lamb.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This verse speaks of consecrated [animals], as it is said, “so that it may be brought as an offering.” 
<b>Within the encampment,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>outside the [Temple] courts. 

### passuk 4
<b>It shall be considered [for that person] as blood,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>as one who shed the blood of [another] person, who [thereby] forfeits his life. 
<b>He has spilled blood —</b> to include one who sprinkles blood outside [the encampment].

### passuk 5

### passuk 7
<b>To the spirits,</b> to the demons, as [in the verse] “and demons dance there.” 

### passuk 8
<b>Who will bring a burnt-offering —</b> to make guilty one who burns limbs <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>outside [the Temple Courts] as one who slaughters outside [the Temple Courts], that if one slaughters and his fellow [Jew] offers it, both are guilty [of this offense]. 

### passuk 9
<b>Shall be cut off.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>His children will be cut off, and his days will be cut short. 

### passuk 10
<b>Any blood.</b> Since it is said: “[blood] that will achieve atonement for the soul,” perhaps he will be guilty only for the blood of consecrated [animals]? The verse says: <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>“Any blood.” 
<b>I shall direct My anger,</b> My “free time” — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I will turn from all My [other] concerns and concern Myself with him. 

### passuk 11
<b>For [the] soul of the body</b> of every creature — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>depends on the blood, and therefore I have allowed it [on the altar] to atone for the soul of man; let a soul come and atone for a soul! 

### passuk 12
<b>Every soul among you —</b> to warn the adults regarding the young ones.

### passuk 13
<b>Will ensnare.</b> I [know this only] of game, How do I know that this applies to geese and chickens? The verse says: “the catch of” — in any case. (If so, why is it said, “which he will ensnare”? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>That one should not eat meat without this preparation.) 
<b>That is permitted to be eaten,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>except for [ritually] unclean [= unkosher animals]. 

### passuk 14
<b>Its blood is its life.</b> Its blood is for it in the place of the soul, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for the soul depends on it. 
<b>For the life of all flesh is its blood.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The soul is the blood. <i>Dom</i> and <i>bosor</i> are of the masculine [gender]; <i>nefesh</i> [“soul”] is feminine.

### passuk 15
<b>That will eat an improperly slaughtered animal or an animal with a fatal defect.</b> The verse speaks of <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>the carcass of a pure [= kosher] bird, which has no [rule of ritual] impurity except <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>when it is swallowed in the gullet. And [the verse] teaches you here that it causes uncleanness by its being eaten but does not cause uncleanness by touch. [The word] טְרֵפָה mentioned here has been written only for midrashic exposition, and so we have learnt: Perhaps the carcass of a impure [= unkosher] bird causes uncleanness in the gullet? The verse says: טְרֵפָה <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>whatever has within its category [the possibility of being] improperly slaughtered, excluding an impure [= unkosher] bird, which does not have within its category [the possiblity of being] improperly slaughtered. 

### passuk 16
<b>He bears his iniquity,</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>if he eats holy food or enters the Sanctuary, he is liable for this impurity as for other impurities. 
<b>And does not bathe his flesh. . . he bears his iniquity.</b> He is punished with <i>koreis</i> for not washing his body, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>and for not washing his clothes [he is punished] with lashes.
