### passuk 2
<b>Moshe went, etc. I cannot any longer go forth and return.</b> Perhaps his strength waned? The Torah therefore teaches, “His appearance was not dulled, and his freshness did not fade.” Then what is meant by “I cannot”? I am not permitted, for authority was removed from me and conferred on Yehoshua. 
<b>For Adonoy has said to me.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This explains “I cannot any longer go forth and return” — for Adonoy said to me.
<b>I am . . . today.</b> Today my days and years are completed — today is the day I was born, and today is the day I will die. Another interpretation: To go forth and return with respect to words of Torah. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This teaches that he was sealed off from the masoretic teachings and the wellsprings of wisdom.

<b>He will not enfeeble you.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He will not precipitate, in you, the feebleness of being abandoned by Him. 

### passuk 7
<b>For you shall enter with this people.</b> “For you shall enter ‘with’ this people.” Moshe told Yehoshua, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>‘Let the elders of the generation join with you, let everything follow their opinion and counsel.’ But the Holy One, Blessed is He, told Yehoshua, “For you shall ‘take’ B’nei Yisroel into the land which I swore to them.” Take them, by coercion, with everything contingent on you. Get a stick, and beat their skulls — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>one leader for the generation, and not two leaders for the generation.

### passuk 9
<b>Moshe wrote, etc., and gave it.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>When it was completely finished, he gave it to his fellow tribesmen. 

### passuk 10
<b>After seven years have ended.</b> During the first year of [the next] <i>Sh’mittah,</i> meaning the eighth year. Why, then, is it referred to as “the <i>Sh’mittah</i> year”? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Because there are still seventh-year restrictions which apply — with the seventh-year harvest which overlaps after the seventh-year has departed. 

### passuk 11
<b>You shall read this Torah.</b> The king recited, from the beginning of “These are the words,” as stated in tractate Sotah, on a wooden platform which was erected in the Temple courtyard. 

### passuk 12
<b>The men.</b> To learn.
<b>The women.</b> To listen.
<b>And the infants.</b> Why did they come? <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>To bring merit to those who brought them.

### passuk 14
<b>And I shall exhort [lit. command] him.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>I shall enthuse him.

### passuk 15

### passuk 16
<b>The stranger of the land.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>The nations of the land.

### passuk 17
<b>I shall conceal My face.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>As if I do not notice their suffering.

### passuk 18

### passuk 19
<b>This song.</b> “Hearken, O heaven” until “And reconcile his land, His people.” 

### passuk 20
<b>And infuriate Me.</b> And enrage Me, as always with נִיאוּץ, which denotes rage. 

### passuk 21
<b>This song shall serve as testimony before them as witness.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>That I warned them, in it, of all that occurred to them. 
<b>For it shall never be forgotten from the lips of their progeny.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This is a guarantee to Yisroel that the Torah will never be completely forgotten by their progeny.

### passuk 22

### passuk 23
<b>He commanded Yehoshua, the son of Nun.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This reverts to the text above in relation to the Divine Presence, as stated clearly, “to the land that I swore to them.” 

### passuk 24

### passuk 25

### passuk 26
<b>Take.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Like “remember,” “keep,” “going.” 
<b>On the side of the ark of Adonoy’s . . . covenant.</b> There is a difference of opinion here among the sages of Yisroel, in tractate Bava Basra. Some of them say, there was a shelf which extended outside the ark, and it was placed there. Others say, it was placed alongside the tablets, inside the ark. 

### passuk 27

### passuk 28
<b>Assemble to me.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>They did not sound the trumpets, that day, to assemble the community, since it is said, “Make for yourself,” he did not empower Yehoshua to use them. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>And even during his own lifetime they were concealed before the day he died [Another text: on the day he died], in fulfillment of that which is said, “there is no sovereignty on the day of death.” 
<b>And invoke as witnesses against them heaven and earth.</b> But, one might contend, he already invoked them as witnesses above — “I invoke as witnesses against you, today, etc.” There, he spoke to the Israelites, but did not address heaven and earth. Now, however, he wanted to say, “Hearken, O heaven, etc.” 

### passuk 29
<b>After my death, that you will become depraved.</b> Yet, throughout all the days of Yehoshua, they were not depraved, as it is said, “The people worshipped Adonoy all the days of Yehoshua.” [We derive] from here that a man’s disciple is as precious to him as his own person, for, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>so long as Yehoshua was alive, it appeared, to Moshe, as if he was alive himself.
