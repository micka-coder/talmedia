### passuk 1
<b>For he found in her something lecherous.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>He is then commanded to divorce her, and that she should not find favor in his eyes. 

### passuk 2
<b>To another man.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This one is not like the first, as he ousted the evil woman from his home, while this one brought her in. 

### passuk 3
<b>If [lit. and] her last husband hates her.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Scripture informs him that he will ultimately hate her. If not, then she will bury him, as it is said, “Or, if [the last husband] dies.” 

### passuk 4
<b>After having been defiled.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This adds the adulteress who was secluded [with the adulterer].

### passuk 5
<b>A new wife.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>One that is new to him, even if she is a widow. This excludes someone who remarries his divorced wife. 
<b>It shall not impose itself over him.</b> The military command.
<b>In any matter.</b> Which is needed by the army — not to supply water and food, or to repair the roads. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>However, those who return from the combat formations by declaration of the <i>kohein</i> — for example, one who built a home but did not inaugurate it, or betrothed a woman but did not marry her — supply water and food, and repair the roads. 
<b>He shall be . . . for his home.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Even for the sake of his home. If he built a home and inaugurated it, or planted a vineyard and redeemed it, he need not budge from his home for the war effort. 
<b>For his home.</b> This refers to his [inaugurated] home.
<b>He shall be.</b> This adds his [redeemed] vineyard.
<b>He shall bring joy.</b> He shall cause his wife to rejoice. Targum also renders “He shall bring joy to his wife.” But one who translates, “He shall rejoice with his wife” is mistaken, for this is not the translation of וְשִׂמַּח, but of וְשָׂמַח . 

### passuk 6
<b>He may not secure as collateral.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>If he demands security from him for his debt in court, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>he may not secure implements of food preparation.

<b>Or pestle.</b> This refers to the upper [utensil].

### passuk 7
<b>If a man is apprehended.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Through witnesses, and after a warning. Similarly, every “apprehended” in the Torah.

### passuk 8
<b>Take precautions with the leprosy affliction.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>So as not to pluck the symptoms of defilement, or remove the leprous ulcer. 
<b>In accordance with everything that . . . shall instruct you.</b> Whether to place in confinement, condemn, or purify.

<b>Remember what the Adonoy, your God, did to Miriam.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>If you intend to take precautions to avoid suffering <i>tzora’as,</i> do not engage in slander.

<b>At sunset.</b> If it is a night garment. If it is a day garment, return it in the morning. That is already written in “These are the laws” — “Until sunset, return it to him.” Throughout the day, return it to him, at sunset, you may take it. 
<b>And bless you.</b> And even if he does not bless you, still, “It will be to your credit.” 

### passuk 14
<b>Do not steal from the wage earner.</b> But isn’t it already written? Evidently, to violate, against the destitute, two negative commandments: ‘Do not steal the pay of the wage earner who is poor or destitute;’ and, against the wealthy, he has already been warned, “Do not steal from your fellow.” 
<b>Destitute.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>In want of all things.
<b>Your converts.</b> This refers to the righteous proselyte.
<b>In your cities.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This refers to the alien settler, who eats meat which was not ritually slaughtered. 
<b>Who are in your land.</b> This is added to include rental fees for animals and tools.

### passuk 15
<b>And he places his life in jeopardy for it.</b> For these wages, he places himself in mortal danger — <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>he climbs a wall, or suspends himself from a tree. 
<b>And you will have a sin.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Regardless, except that punishment is swiftly dispatched when someone cries out. 

### passuk 16
<b>Fathers shall not be executed through sons.</b> Through the testimony of the sons. Perhaps through the sin of the sons? It has already been said, “A man is executed by his own sin.” However, one who is not a man may die by his father’s sin — minors may die by their father’s sin, by Heavenly decree. 

### passuk 17
<b>Do not be devious in the judgment of the proselyte or orphan.</b> Concerning the wealthy, he has already been warned, “Do not judge deviously.” It is repeated with the poor so that he violates two prohibitions, since it is easier to distort the judgment of the poor than that of the wealthy. Thus, he warns, and repeats the warning. 
<b>You may not secure as collateral.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Not at the time of the loan.

### passuk 18
<b>Remember.</b> On this condition I redeemed you — so that you keep my statutes even when the matter entails monetary loss.

### passuk 19
<b>And you forget a sheaf.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>But not a heap. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>From here we derive that a sheaf containing two <i>seahs</i> that was forgotten is not <i>shikchah.</i>
<b>In the field.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This is added to include forgotten standing grainstalks, some of which he forgot to reap. 
<b>You may not return to take it.</b> From here we derive that what is behind him is <i>shikchah,</i> but what is before him is not <i>shikchah,</i> as it is not included in “you may not return.” 
<b>In order that . . . will bless you.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Although it came into his possession unintentionally — certainly, with someone who acts intentionally. You may thus conclude that if a <i>sela</i>-coin dropped from his hand and was found by a pauper who gained sustenance from it — he is blessed for it. 

### passuk 20
<b>You may not strip it of its glory.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Do not remove its glory from it. From here [we derive] that one must leave unharvested the outer edge of the tree.
<b>Behind you.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This refers to <i>shikchah.</i>

### passuk 21
<b>You may not harvest pygmy vines.</b> If you discover pygmy vines, you may not take them. What are pygmy vines? Anything lacking the shoulder and the droplets. If it has either of them, then it belongs to the owner. I have seen in the Jerusalem Talmud, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>‘What is the shoulder? clusters atop one another. The droplets? Those hanging down from the main stem.’
