<b>The heavens above your head will be like copper.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>These curses Moshe articulated himself, while those at Mount Sinai, by the word of God he (Moshe) pronounced them, as indicated by the text: there, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>it is said, “If you do not heed ‘Me’.” “If you relate to ‘Me’ in a fickle way.” Here, however, it says, “to the voice of ‘Adonoy, your God’,” “‘Adonoy’ shall attach to you” “‘Adonoy’ shall strike you.” Moshe moderated his curses by expressing them in the singular form. He also moderated this curse, for in the first ones, it states, “your heavens like iron and your land like copper.” The heavens will not secrete moisture, just as iron does not secrete moisture, so that the world will subsequently suffer from drought. But the land will secrete moisture, just as copper secretes moisture, so that its produce will rot. Here, however, it says, ‘Your heavens copper and your land iron,’ the heavens will secrete moisture. Although they will not pour rain, still, there won’t be a ruinous drought in the world. And the land will not secrete moisture, just as iron does not secrete moisture, so that the produce will not rot. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Still, this is a curse. Whether it is like copper or like iron, it will not produce fruit. Similarly, the heavens will not pour rain. 

### passuk 24
<b>The rain of your land into dust and soil.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>When the wind follows a rainfall. The rain falls, but insufficiently, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>not enough to settle the dust. The wind follows and lifts the dust, so that it blankets the shoots of the seeds which were moistened by the water. It becomes attached to them and turns to mud, and they wither and rot. 

### passuk 25

<b>Redeem it.</b> During the fourth year, in order to eat its fruit. 

### passuk 31

<b>Be cited as an example.</b> If a terrible blow befalls a person, they will say, ‘This is like that person’s blow.’ 
<b>And become the subject of gossip.</b> This means the same as “You shall discuss them.” They will talk about you. Targum’s translation is the same — “ וּלְשׁוֹעֵי,” meaning to relate, “And he related.”

### passuk 54
<b>The delicate among you, and the fastidious. </b> The delicate is the same as the fastidious, meaning pampered. “Out of fastidiousness and softness” indicates conclusively that both are the same. Although pampered, and revolted by anything disgusting, he will savor, in his starvation, the flesh of his sons and daughters, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>so that he will begrudge his remaining children, and refuse to give any of them the flesh of his children — their siblings — which he has eaten. Another interpretation. The compassionate among you. The merciful and tender hearted, being extremely famished, will become brutal, and refuse to give the flesh of their slaughtered children to their remaining children.

### passuk 62

### passuk 63
<b>So will Adonoy bring joy.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>To your enemies, concerning you, to annihilate, etc. [However, the Holy One, may He be blessed, will not rejoice Himself. From here [we derive that] the Holy One, may He be blessed, does not rejoice at the downfall of the wicked. For, it is not said, “will rejoice,” but, rather, “will bring joy.” He brings joy to others, but does not rejoice. However, with the benefit of the righteous, He rejoices Himself, as it is said, “just as Adonoy rejoiced over you.”] 
<b>You will be uprooted.</b> The word denotes uprooting. Similarly, “The house of the haughty, Adonoy shall uproot.” 

### passuk 64
<b>You shall serve there [those who serve] other gods.</b> As Targum [Onkelos] renders. <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>Not literally idolatry, but, rather, paying income or poll taxes to the priests of idolatry. 

### passuk 65
<b>You will not be tranquil.</b> You will not rest, as in, “This is the tranquility.” 
<b>A fearful heart.</b> A trembling heart, as Targum [Onkelos] renders, “fearful.” Like, “The nether world trembles towards you,” “Peoples heard and trembled,” “The foundations of the firmament tremble.” 
<b>Pining eyes.</b> Yearning for salvation, but it shall not come. 

### passuk 66

<b>You will have no faith in your living.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>This refers to one who depends on the bakeshop.

### passuk 67
<b>In the morning you will say, ‘Would that it were evening.’</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>That it were last evening. 
<b>And in the evening, you will say, ‘Would that it were morning.’</b> This morning, <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>for the tribulations constantly increase, with every minute’s curses exceeding the previous one’s. 

### passuk 68
<b>On ships.</b> <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>By ship, as captives. 
<b>There you will attempt to sell yourselves to your enemies.</b> You will attempt to be sold to them as slaves and maidservants.
<b>But no one will buy.</b> For they will sentence you with death and destruction.
<b>You will attempt to be sold.</b> In Old French, <i>Eporwendrez wos.</i> But it is unfeasible to interpret וְהִתְמַכַּרְתֶּם as <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>”you will be sold,” through other sellers, because of the statement following, “but no one will buy.” 

### passuk 69
