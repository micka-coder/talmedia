<b>Without cessation.</b> The Targum translates וְלֹא יָסָף, — וְלָא פְסַק without interruption, (Because it is the nature of a human being that he is incapable of speaking all his words in one breath [and therefore he must pause between words]; and it is characteristic of the Holy One, blessed is He, that this is not so, [Therefore] He did not pause, and since He did not pause, there was no need to resume,) <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>because His voice is strong and eternal. Another explanation of וְלֹא יָסָף : He never again revealed Himself <i data-commentator="Siftei Chakhamim" data-label="⚬"></i>in such a public demonstration.

Would it not have been better for you to learn [directly] from the Mighty One, and not to learn from me.
