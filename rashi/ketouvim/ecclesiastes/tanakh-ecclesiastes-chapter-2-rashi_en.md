### passuk 1
<b>I said to myself.</b> Since that is so, I will refrain from wisdom, and I will indulge in drinking. 
<b>I will try.</b> אַנַסְּכָה is an expression of mixing wine [=מֶסֶךְ to drink,<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, אנסכה means “I will test [=נסה].” (Metsudas Tzion); or “I will govern [=נסיך].” (Sforno) </i> as in, “she mixed her wine,”<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Mishlei 9:2. </i> the mixing of wine with water to improve it or the mixing of spices with wine for create a spiced wine. 
<b>And enjoy the good life.</b> וּרְאֵה is the same as וּרְאוֹת [=to enjoy].<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., וראה is not a command. (<i>Sifsei Chachomim</i>) </i> 
<b>And behold, this too was vanity.</b> For I saw prophetically that much evil is caused by lighthearted frivolity, [e.g.,] Belshatzar died as a result of a banquet, [and] the people of the generation of the flood were inundated because of the abundant goodness that You bestowed upon them. 

### passuk 2
<b>Of laughter I said it is senseless.</b> Mixed with cries and sighs.<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ‘מהולל’ means praiseworthy [=הלל], referring to the joy and delight awaiting the righteous in the World to Come, which is indeed praiseworthy. See Maseches Shabbos 30b. </i> 
<b>And of joy, what does it [accomplish]? [What] good is it if it ends in grief.</b> 

### passuk 3
<b>I searched in my heart.</b> I repeatedly searched in my heart to grasp them all, partying, wisdom, and folly, and to stimulate and to pamper my body by imbibing in wine. Every luxurious banquet is referred to as wine [=יַיִּן. 
<b>And my heart conducted itself with wisdom.</b> Even if my body is imbibed with wine, my heart conducted itself with wisdom and Torah observance. 
<b>And to grasp foolishness.</b> To things that appear foolish to me, concerning which I said, “Because God is with me, I will be able,”<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Mishlei 30:1. </i> for example, the [prohibition against] wearing sha’atnez and having mingled species in a vineyard, which Satan and the nations of the world are critical of, and so it states, “It is best to take hold of one,”<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Below 7:18. </i> and also, regarding Shaul, in whose eyes it seemed foolish to kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, but it was the commandment of the Omnipresent, and he called it foolishness! 

### passuk 4
<b>I made great works.</b> In the days of my greatness.

### passuk 5
<b>Every kind of fruit tree.</b> For Shlomo with his wisdom recognized the veins of the earth, which vein goes to Cush, and there he planted peppers [which normally does not grow in Eretz Yisroel]; which one goes to a land of carobs, and there he planted carob trees. For all the veins of the lands come to Tzion, from where the world was founded, as it is stated, “Out of Tzion, the perfect beauty.”<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 50:2. </i> Therefore, it is stated, “every kind of fruit tree.” [This is found] in Midrash Tanchuma.<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">The Gemara in Maseches Bava Kamma 82b states that it is forbidden to plant gardens and orchards in Yerusholayim. Apparently that is what prompted the Targum for this verse to describe that the boundaries for these plants and orchards were from “the wall of Yerusholayim until the banks of the water of Shiloach.” (Gishmei Bracha) </i> 

### passuk 6
<b>Pools of water.</b> בְּרֵכוֹת is] similar to ponds for fish, which are dug into the ground. 

### passuk 7

### passuk 8
<b>And treasures of kings.</b> The treasures of the kings, gold, silver and precious stones, which the kings collect in their treasure houses. 
<b>And provinces.</b> The treasure of all merchants.
<b>Singers and musical instruments.</b> Various types of musical instruments.<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Gittin 68a. According to Rashi, שׁרים ושׁרות are various types of musical instruments. Alternatively, שׁרים ושׁרות are male singers and female singers respectively. </i> 
<b>Chests and chests of them.</b> Beautiful coaches, covered wagons, a term used in the Gemara, “a coach שִׁדָּה, a chest and a closet.”<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">Mishnayos Keilim 18:3. </i> <sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, שׁדה ושׁדות refers to a harem, i.e., women taken forcefully [שדד=plunder]. (Ibn Ezra) </i> 

### passuk 9
<b>Also my wisdom.</b> Also,<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, אף means “anger” and the verse is translated as, “only the [Torah] wisdom that I acquired through exertion [אף] is what remained with me.” The Gemara in Maseches Berachos 63b and in Maseches Eiruvin 54a indicates that the study of Torah during trying times is most commendable and will result in great success and will not soon be forgotten. Or, unlike some preachers who do not practice what they preach, I, says Koheles, internalized and conducted my life [עמדה לי] according to what I preached. (Yismach Moshe) </i> I did not forsake my wisdom because of all these affairs, and it remained with me and I did not forget it. Another explanation, it stood by me to aid me against all these. 

### passuk 10
<b>I did not deny.</b> I did not distance myself to separate from them, and similarly, “and He held back some of the spirit [that was upon him] and he gave it unto ... the elders,”<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 11:25. </i> like a candelabrum from which many candles are kindled, and none of its light is diminished. 
<b>And this was my portion [reward].</b> And after doing all these, I have nothing more than this. Rav and Shmuel, one says, his staff, and one says, his cup.<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Sanhedrin 20b. The Gemara in Maseches Eiruvin 21b states that Shlomo established eiruvei chatzeiros [a procedure which allows carrying in courtyards on Shabbos] and netilas yodayim [ritual washing of one’s hands before eating]. Accordingly, מקלו [=his staff] alludes to eiruvei chatzeiros and קידו [=cup] alludes to netilas yodayim. (R’ Eliyahu Greiditzer) </i> מַקֵּידָה is an earthenware cup, from which people drink.<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">See Rashi in Maseches Sanhedrin 20b. </i> Others in the Midrash Aggadah interpret the entire section as referring to study halls, students, and synagogues. 
<b>The forest growing with trees.</b> The ignorant people, for working in fields and vineyards.<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">This Rashi on verse 6 appears to be out of place. Some texts treat the caption as part of Rashi narrative, i.e., that “the Midrash Aggadah interprets the entire section ... and synagogues, and the forest growing with trees [refers to] the ignorant people, etc.” (<i>Sifsei Chachomim</i>) </i> 

### passuk 11
<b>Then I looked.</b> Now at all my deeds, and I see that there is no benefit in them, for from all of them I am lacking.<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., they do not yield the eternal benefit I had expected of them. </i> 

### passuk 12
<b>I [then] turned my attention to behold wisdom.</b> I turn away from all my affairs to delve into Torah, and madness and folly, [i.e.,] the punishment for transgressions. 
<b>For what value is the man who would come after the king.</b> To supplicate him concerning a decree that they decreed upon him, and they already executed the decree and it is already in effect. It is better for him to consider at first his actions, and he would not find it necessary for him to appeal. 

### passuk 13
<b>Over foolishness.</b> That is wickedness.<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">The analogy of wisdom and foolishness to light [אור] and darkness [חשך] can be explained that אור is an all inclusive term which can mean day or night, but חשך refers to night only. See Maseches Pesachim 2a-b. Similarly, a wise person, when the situation calls for it, can act in a foolish manner [as Dovid did when he escaped from Avimelech], whereas a foolish person cannot act as a wise person. (R. Leibish Charif) </i> 

### passuk 14
<b>The wise man, his eyes are in his head.</b> In the beginning [=בְּרֹאשׁוֹ of the matter, he contemplates the end results.<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">Note the similarity to “Who is wise? He who visualizes what the future holds,” in Maseches Tamid 32a. </i> 
<b>But I also understood.</b> Also, I [know], who praise the wise man over the fool, I know that they both will die. 

### passuk 15
<b>And I said to myself, etc.</b> I.e., since they will both die, perhaps I will think in my heart from now on that as it happens to the wicked man, so will it happen to me, so why should I be more righteous? 
<b>Then I said to myself.</b> That if I will think so, that is vanity, for the remembrances of the wise man and the fool are not equal. After their deaths, both of them will not be remembered together, for this one will be remembered for good, and this one will be remembered for evil. 

### passuk 16
<b>Since in the days to come all will be forgotten.</b> Because I see the wicked who already lived, and who were very successful, and in the days that came after them, all their power and their success were forgotten. 
<b>And how can the death of the wise man be [like the death] of the fool.</b> I observe the righteous succeeding in their deaths and availing their children, for example, “And I will remember My covenant with Yaakov, etc.,”<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">Vayikra 26:42. </i> [and] “I remember for you the kindness of your youth.”<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 2:2. </i> 

### passuk 17
<b>And [so] I hated life.</b> He was prophesying about the generation of Rechovam, who were wicked [people].<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">During Rechovam’s reign, ten tribes defected and joined forces with him. </i> 

### passuk 18

### passuk 19
<b>This too is vanity.</b> This too is one of the vanities that were created in the world, that the wise man labors, and the fool inherits him. 

### passuk 20
<b>And [so] I turned my heart to despair.</b> Neither to toil nor to labor.

### passuk 21
<b>For there is a man.</b> Its interpretation is according to its plain meaning. But the Midrash Aggadah in Tanchuma interprets it as an allegorical reference to the Holy One, Blessed Is He, concerning Whom it is stated, “and upon the likeness of the throne there was a likeness like the appearance of a man.”<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkeil 1:26. </i> 
<b>Who labored with wisdom.</b> As it is stated, “Adonoy founded the earth with wisdom ... with His knowledge the depths were split,”<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote">Mishlei 3:19-20. </i> and to the creatures who had not labored in it, He left a share in it.<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">This can be referring to a situation where one publicly shamed his friend, that according to our Sages his friend receives his share in Gan Eiden. (Kehilas Yaakov). Or, as the Gemara Maseches Chagigah 15a states that God created for every person a portion of Gan Eiden and a portion of Gehinnom, and when a wicked person fails to earn his portion in Gan Eiden, it is given to a righteous person in addition to his own portion that he earned. </i> 
<b>This too is vanity and a great evil.</b> And they became a generation of vanity and “the wickedness of man was great upon the earth,”<sup>26</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 6:5. The text in Bereishis which is referring to the generation of the flood, states “כי רבה רעת האדם” which is similar to the wording of this verse “רבה רעה” [and a great evil]. </i> in the generation of the flood. 

### passuk 22
<b>For what has, etc.</b> For what advantage does man gain from all his toil and frustration he endures with [his] labor and worry, which he toils, and ultimately leaving [his possessions] to others. 

### passuk 23
<b>His lot.</b> His custom.
<b>This too.</b> Is one of the vanities that prevail in the world.

### passuk 24
<b>Is it not beneficial for man.</b> This is a question, “that he eat and drink and shows himself content?” i.e., “he guides his heart to perform justice and righteousness with the food and drink, and so it was stated to Yehoyakim, “Did not your father eat and drink and practice justice and righteousness and then it was well with him?”<sup>27</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 22:15. </i> 

### passuk 25
<b>For who should eat, etc.</b> Why should I not rejoice with my portion in food and drink? Who deserves to eat what I toiled for, and who will hurry to swallow it, except me? 
<b>If not I.</b> Except me. This is the trait of the wicked, who hoard [their possessions] for others. 

### passuk 26
<b>For to the man who is good in His sight.</b> Before God, mentioned above, “that it is from the hand of God.”<sup>28</sup><i class="footnote">Above, verse 24. </i> 
<b>He gives wisdom, knowledge and joy.</b> A heart [i.e., intellect] to engage in Torah [study] and in [fulfilling] the commandments and to rejoice in his portion of eating, drinking, and [donning] clean clothing. 
<b>But to the sinner He gives the urge.</b> A habit and concern to hoard and gather, and to give to him who is good before God, as the matter is stated, “and Esther put Mordechai in charge of Haman’s estate.”<sup>29</sup><i class="footnote">Esther 8:2. </i> 
<b>This too.</b> Is one of the vanities that were given to the creatures, that they labor, and someone else takes.
