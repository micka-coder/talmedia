### passuk 11

<b>shuffles with his feet</b> He rubs one on the other.

### passuk 23
<b>For a commandment is a candle, and the Torah is light</b> Just as light always illuminates, so does the merit of the Torah stand for a person forever, but the merit of the commandment is only for a limited time, like the light of a candle. Another explanation: <b>For a commandment is a candle, etc.</b> The command of the father is a candle. Whoever fulfills the command of his father is as though he takes a candle in his hand to light a dark place, and if he loses anything there he finds it by its light; similarly, whoever fulfills his mother’s instruction—it is light to him, and so [Scripture] states (verse 20): “and forsake not the instruction of your mother.” It is certain that this verse speaks of the commands of one’s father and mother, for it is written (20:20): “If one curses his father or mother, his candle will be put out in the blackest darkness.” Now if a person’s candle goes out when he does not fulfill the commandments of his parents, conversely when he fulfills the command, his candle lights up (Rabbi Joseph Kara).
<b>and disciplining rebukes are the way of life</b> Disciplining rebukes incline a person to life. It is found that they are the way of life.

### passuk 24
<b>to guard you from an evil woman</b> The Torah shall guard you from a woman of evil behavior—perforce, Solomon did not speak of an evil woman, but concerning idolatry, [the prohibition of] which is equal in gravity to all [commandments], for if you say that he meant a real harlot, is that all the reward and the praise of the Torah that it guards one only from a harlot? Rather, perforce this is idolatry, [the prohibition of] which is as stringent as all other [commandments].
<b>from the smoothness of the alien tongue</b> From the sealing of the eyes by an alien tongue.

### passuk 28

### passuk 29
<b>to his neighbor’s wife</b> According to its apparent meaning, and it can also be expounded upon as referring to the idolatry of the pagans.

### passuk 30
<b>They will not despise a thief,</b> etc. <b>And if he is found, he will pay sevenfold,</b> etc. <b>One who commits adultery with a woman</b> The three of them are combined in one statement. If a thief commits a theft, he should not be despised as much as the adulterer. Why? Because he steals in order to sate his hunger, and perhaps he has nothing to eat. And, when he is found, he can rectify his sin with payment; at the most, he will pay sevenfold i.e., many times the double payment and even fifty times for one. Some explain “sevenfold” as referring to one who steals an ox and his trappings and slaughters it, who pays five cattle and double payment of the trappings (totalling seven). <b>he must give all he owns</b> lit. he must give all the property of his house. And, even if he must sell all he owns because of this, he can nevertheless rectify it, and from the beginning he did it because of hunger. But...

<b>one who would destroy his soul—he will do it</b> The lewd act.

### passuk 33
<b>He will find wounds and disgrace</b> Lesions are sent for idolatry and immorality.

### passuk 34
<b>for jealousy</b> For the jealousy of the Holy One, blessed be He, Who is the Mighty One over all, will be aroused to mete out retribution upon him, and He will not have pity on the day of vengeance.

### passuk 35
<b>He will not have regard</b> for any money to expiate for his denial of Him and his cleaving to idolatry. And our Rabbis expounded (Tosefta Baba Kamma 7:3): They will not despise a thief—This is one who steals away from his friend and goes to the study hall and engages in Torah. If he is found, he will pay sevenfold. [The intention is that] eventually, he will be appointed as a judge, and he will render legal decisions, for “sevenfold” refers only to the Torah, as it is said (Ps. 12:7): “refined sevenfold.”
