<b>He who is separated seeks lust</b> He who is separated from the Holy One, blessed be He, not keeping His precepts, pursues the lust of his heart and his evil inclination, and finally... <b>in all sound wisdom, he is exposed</b> Among the wise, his disgrace will be revealed.

His end was that his shame was exposed in the synagogues and in the study halls, [when people read] (Deut. 23:4): “Neither an Ammonite nor a Moabite may enter [the congregation of the Lord].”
