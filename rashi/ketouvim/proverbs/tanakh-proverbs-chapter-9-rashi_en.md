<b>Wisdom has built her house</b> With wisdom has the Holy One, blessed be He, built the world.

### passuk 9
<b>Give a wise man, and he will become yet wiser</b> To a worthy pupil, and the Midrash Aggadah (Tanchuma, Vayakhel 6) states: It was said to Noah, “From every clean animal, etc.” (Gen. 7:2), and when he went out, “And he took from all clean animals, etc.” (ibid. 8:20). He said, “What did the Holy One, blessed be He, see to increase the number of these? It is only because He wished that I offer up some of them.”
