<b>for you have abolished the asheroth</b> as above (17:6), “and he removed the high places [and the asherim], etc.”
<b>to seek God</b> as above (17:4): “but he inquired of the God of his father, etc.”

### passuk 4

### passuk 5
<b>And he appointed judges</b> When the seer told him, “good things were found in you, for you abolished the asheroth,” he approached the Sepher Torah [to see] whether he had abolished them properly. He first saw that it was written (Deut. 12:2f.): “You shall utterly destroy...and you shall burn their asherim with fire and cut down the images of their gods,” and he remembered that it is written in כִּי תִשָׂא (Exod. 34:13): “And you shall break down their monuments, etc.” He wondered why he had pleased the Lord by abolishing the asherim, the Jewish asherim, for [the Torah] only warned about their asherim. He went back to [the Torah portion] (Deut. 16:18): “Judges and law enforcing agents,” and found written (verse 21): “You shall not plant an asherah.” Then he rejoiced that he had abolished them. He also saw written there: “Judges and law enforcing agents you shall appoint for yourself,” and immediately “he appointed judges,” strong ones.
<b>in all the fortified cities of Judah, for every city</b> He first appointed strong [judges] in all the fortified cities of Judah to coerce them [the people] and compel them to [accept] judgment. He later appointed judges who were not as strong for the cities that were not fortified, for they [the inhabitants] were more afraid to rebel than those who dwelt in the fortified cities, for they felt secure in their fortified cities.

### passuk 6
<b>for you do not judge for man</b> The meaning is: Do not think in your heart: What difference does it make if we pervert the law to declare our friends innocent and pervert the rights of the poor and favor the rich? Is it not so that the judgment is not for the Lord? Therefore, it says, “for the Lord.” It is for Him. If you convict the innocent, it is as though you take from your Creator’s property and pervert the law of Heaven, by bestowing a distorted verdict. Therefore, “see what you are doing,” and may your heart be in every judgment, as if the Holy One, blessed be He, is standing before you in judgment, and this is the meaning of: “and [He] is with you in the matter of the judgment.” In <i>Sanhedrin</i> (6b) it is stated “What are you doing, for you do not judge for man but for the Lord.” This is explained [as follows]: Perhaps the judge will say, “How does this problem concern me?” Therefore, Scripture states: “and it is with you concerning the matter of the judgment,” i.e., it is incumbent upon you to rule justly. And the judge must deal only with that which he sees with his own eyes.

### passuk 7
<b>for with the Lord your God there is neither injustice, favoritism, nor bribe-taking</b> and He is with you in judgment; therefore, He does not wish you to commit injustice in judgment.

### passuk 8
<b>And also in Jerusalem...set up judges</b> even though he himself was in Jerusalem.
<b>for the judgment of the Lord and for quarrels</b> It is appropriate to use the term “judgment” (לְמִשְׁפַּט) concerning money matters, an example being (Num. 27:11) “and it shall be for the Children of Israel as a legal norm (לְחֻקַּת מִשְׁפָּט).” “And for quarrels” (וְלָרִיב) refers to capital cases and bodily injuries, an example being (Exod. 21:18) “And if men quarrel, etc.” (יְרִיבוּן).

### passuk 9
<b>So shall you do</b> Because of alacrity, caution, and encouragement, he added a “nun,” like (Gen. 32: 5): “So shall you say (תאמְרוּן),” and like (Ruth 2:8f.): “and here you shall stay (תִדְבָּקִין) with my maidens. Your eyes shall be on the field that they reap (יִִִקְצרוּן),” and like (ibid. 3:18): “until you know (תֵּדְעִין) how the matter will be resolved, for the man will not rest, etc.”

### passuk 10
<b>between blood[shed] and blood[shed]</b> between the bloodshed of an unintentional murder and an intentional one.
<b>you shall admonish them</b> your brethren.
<b>and there be wrath upon you and upon your brethren</b> Therefore <b>so shall you do</b> You shall admonish your brethren.
<b>and you will not be guilty</b> In any case, you [will not be guilty], for if you accept the admonition, there will be no wrath upon you, and there will also be no guilt upon you in anything since you performed the duty which was incumbent upon you to perform.

### passuk 11
<b>and may the Lord be with the good</b> with the one who performs that which is good and upright.
