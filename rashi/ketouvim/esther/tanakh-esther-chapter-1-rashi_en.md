<b>It was in the days of Achashveirosh.</b> He was the king of Persia<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">The Persians conquered the Babylonians, and Achashveirosh succeeded Koresh to the Persian throne in the year 3392.</i> who reigned in place of Koresh<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">There were other Persian kings with the name “Achashveirosh,” therefore Rashi identifies which “Achashveirosh” he was. (Mizrachi) </i> at the end of the seventy years of the Babylonian exile. 
<b>He was [the] Achashveirosh.</b> He was equally wicked from beginning to end.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Megillah 11a. He did not allow the resumption of the building of the Bais Hamikdosh after it had been suspended. </i> 
<b>Who reigned.</b> He reigned on his own, and was not of royal seed.<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. He was very wealthy and he acquired the throne by distributing his money. </i>

### passuk 2
<b>When King Achashveirosh had established himself, etc.</b> When the kingdom was firmly established under his control.<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., כשבת should not be interpreted literally as meaning “when he sat [on his throne].” Alternatively, Targum renders the literal translation and relates that Achashveirosh had in his possession the throne of King Shlomo. However, he was injured when he tried to sit on it.He had his craftsmen build for him a replica which had just been completed and that is the meaning of “he sat on his throne.”</i> Our Rabbis, however, explained it differently in Maseches Megillah.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">11b, which interpret it as “when Achashveirosh gained his composure.” Until now Achashveirosh was afraid that the Jewish exile would finish at the end of seventy years as predicted by Yirmiyahu [29:10]. However, Achashveirosh [mistakenly] calculated that the seventy years had already elapsed and concluded that the Jews would never be redeemed but will remain under his dominion. He celebrated at his feast by using the vessels confiscated from the Bais Hamikdosh. </i>

<b>Gold and silver couches.</b> He set [them] up to sit upon for the meal.

She was as lewd as her husband and would have attended had she not broken out with leprosy. Another opinion is that the angel Gavriel caused her to grow a tail. </i> so that she should refuse and be executed. Because she would force Jewish girls to disrobe and make them do work on Shabbos, it was decreed upon her to be stripped naked on Shabbos.<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">This punishment was in the form of מדה כנגד מדה, just as she had done, so it was decreed upon her.

<b>For the king would thus place matters.</b> For such was the king’s custom in every judgment, to present the matter “before all who were versed in procedural and legal concerns.”<sup>27</sup><i class="footnote">The Midrash states that Achashveirosh originally sought the advice of the Sages and asked them to judge Vashti. Realizing that judging Vashti would expose them to great danger, they opted to defer judgment by explaining to Achashveirosh that they were unfit to judge in a capital case.

<b>That Vashti must never again appear.</b> And therefore she was executed.
