<b>We pay to drink our own water.</b> Since we were afraid to draw water from the river because of the enemies, we bought [water] from them with money.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ‘we are accustomed to drink from silver cups, and now we even have to pay to drink from wooden cups. (Yalkut Me’am Lo’ez) </i> 

### passuk 5
<b>We are hounded around our necks.</b> Because of the yoke of hard labor.
<b>We exhaust ourselves.</b> To gather money and property.
<b>But nothing remains for us.</b> [Of] our toil in our hands, because the enemies would collect and seize everything for taxes, head taxes, and property taxes.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ‘and we were given no rest [ולא הונח לנו].’ </i> 

### passuk 6
<b>Toward Egypt we extended a hand [for assistance].</b> It is customary for a person who is falling and wishes to stand up to stretch out a hand to someone nearby to help him. Here too, we stretched out a hand to Egypt that they should help us.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, Egypt gave us their hand[shake], i.e., an expression of making an oath, that they would assist us. (Ibn Ezra) </i> 
<b>[Toward] Ashur.</b> That they sate us with their bread.
<b>We extended [a hand].</b> נָתַנּוּ is] the same as נָתַנְנוּ. The <i>dagesh</i> in the <i>nun</i> takes the place of the second <i>nun</i>, as in, “for all is from You, and from Your hand we have given נָתַנּוּ it to You,”<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">I Divrei Hayomim 29:14. </i> and as in, “and we will give וְנָתַנּוּ our daughters to you.”<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 34:16. </i>

<b>Inflamed.</b> Became heated, as in, “for his mercies were aroused נִכְמְרוּ”;<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 43:30. </i> and in the language of the Gemara there are many instances, “a heating vessel כּוֹמֶר of grapes”;<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Yevamos 97a. </i> “the heating מִכְמָר of the flesh.”<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Pesachim 58a. </i>

<b>Encumbered with millstones.</b> When the enemies led them away in neck irons, they would place on their shoulders millstones and burdens in order to tire them.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ‘youths were forced to grind wheat,’ a task which drains their strength. (Ibn Ezra) </i> And similarly, “[and boys] staggered with beams,” [meaning that] their strength failed. The expression of staggering כִּשְׁלוֹן applies to the weakening of strength, as is stated in Ezra, “And Yehudah said, ‘the strength of the bearer has failed,’”<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Nechemyah 4:4. </i> and similarly, “He has caused my strength to fail.”<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">Eichah 1:14. </i>

<b>For this our hearts ached, etc.</b> Because of that which is delineated in the verse following, “Over Mount Tzion, which was devastated [and] foxes meandered over it.”<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Below, verse 18. Our hearts ache only for the destruction of Mount Tzion, and nothing else. (Palgei Mayim) </i>

<b>Adonoy, You.</b> We know that You will remain forever. And because that is so... 

### passuk 20
<b>Why [then O Eternal] do You forget us.</b> Have You not sworn to us Yourself that just as You exist, so does Your oath exist?

<b>For although You may have considered us contemptible.</b> Although we have sinned, [nonetheless] You should not have been angered as much as You have been. 
<b>Adonoy return us.</b> Because he concludes with words of reproof, he had to repeat the preceding verse again,<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">In order to end on a note of consolation. </i> and so did Yeshayahu, Trei Osor, and Koheles.
