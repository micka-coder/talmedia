### passuk 1
<b>Now at that time, Michael...will be silent</b> He will be silent like a mute person, for he will see the Holy One, blessed be He, judging by Himself and saying, “How will I destroy a great nation like this for the sake of Israel?”
<b>and it will be a time of distress</b> in heaven there will be accusations against Torah scholars, [and there will be] plunderers and plunderers of plunderers, as our Rabbis said in the Aggadah in the last chapter of Kethuboth (112b).
<b>your people will escape</b> The kingdom of Gog will be destroyed and Israel will escape.
<b>everyone who is found inscribed in the book</b> This is a short verse, [meaning] whoever is found inscribed in this Book, through the dreams inscribed in it (7: 11): “until the beast is slain”; (verse 18): “and the high holy ones will receive the kingdom.” All will be fulfilled.

### passuk 2
<b>And many who sleep in the dust of the earth will awaken</b> The dead will come to life.

### passuk 3
<b>And the wise</b> who engaged in the Torah and in the commandments, will shine like the brightness of the sky.

### passuk 7
<b>and when they have ended shattering the strength of the holy people</b> Heb. נַפֵּץ יַד, lit. shattering the hand. When Israel’s strength terminates, [similar to] (Deut. 32:36): “that power has vanished (אָזְלַת יַד) and nothing left to keep or abandon.”

### passuk 8
<b>but I did not understand</b> I did not know what “the time of two times and a half” means.
<b>what is the end of these</b> the end of these calculations.

### passuk 9
<b>until the time of the end</b> until our redemption draws near.

### passuk 10
<b>They will be clarified and whitened</b> [i.e.,] these calculations.
<b>and...will be purified</b> [i.e.,] many [will be purified] by them to understand them.
<b>and the wicked will pervert</b> the calculations by computing them incorrectly, and when they terminate, they will say that there is no more redemption.
<b>will not understand</b> All the wicked [will not understand] them.
<b>but the wise will understand</b> them when the time of the end arrives.

### passuk 11
<b>And from the time the daily sacrifice was removed</b> in order to place a silent abomination in its stead, are days of one thousand two hundred and ninety years since the daily sacrifice was removed until it will be restored in the days of our King Messiah, and this calculation coincides with the calculation of (8:14): “evening and morning, two thousand and three hundred” from the day of their exile to Egypt until the final redemption: Egyptian exile 210; From their Exodus until the First Temple 480; First Temple 410; Babylonian exile 70; Second Temple 20; Totaling 1590. The daily sacrifice was removed six years before the destruction, which equals 1584. Add 1290, and the total sum is 2874; like the numerical value of בֹּקֶר עֶרֶב [574] plus 2300 [2874].

### passuk 12
<b>Fortunate is he who waits etc.</b> Forty five years are added to the above number, for our King Messiah is destined to be hidden after he is revealed and to be revealed again. So we find in Midrash Ruth, and so did Rabbi Eleazar HaKalir establish (in the concluding poem of the morning service of the portion dealing with the month of Nissan): “and he will be concealed from them six weeks of years.”

### passuk 13
<b>go to the end</b> You will depart to your everlasting home.
<b>to your lot</b> to receive your portion with the righteous.
<b>at the end of the days</b> Heb. לְקֵץ הַיָמִין, like בְּאַחֲרִית הַיָמִים. We cannot interpret הַיָמִין as an expression of the right hand, because it is mentioned in the Large Masorah among the six words that are unusual because they have a final “nun” at the end of the word, which serves instead of a “mem,” and there is none like them, e.g. (Job 31:10): “and may others (אֲחֵרִין) kneel upon her;” (ibid. 24:22): “and he is not sure of life (בַּחַיִין)” (Ezek. 4:9): “take yourself wheat (חִטִין)”; (ibid. 26: 18): “Now the isles (הָאִיִן) will tremble;” (Prov. 31:3): “to the pleasures of kings;” (here): “to the end of the days (הַיָמִין).”
