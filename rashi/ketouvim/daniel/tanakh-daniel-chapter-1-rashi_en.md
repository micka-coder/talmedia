<b>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim</b> Now is it possible to say so? Did he [Nebuchadnezzar] not reign in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, as is stated (Jer. 25:1) “in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah that is the first year of Nebuchadnezzar?” So what is the meaning of “In the third year?” In the third year of his rebellion, as is stated (II Kings 24:1): “and Jehoiakim was his vassal for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him”; and in the third year, he overcame him, and that was the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar, for the master said (Seder Olam ch. 24): In his first year he conquered Nineveh, and in his second year he advanced and vanquished Jehoiakim, who served him for three years and rebelled against him for three years. That was the eleventh year of the reign of Jehoiakim: five years before he vanquished him, three years that he served him, and three years that he rebelled against him. And then Jehoiakim died under his hand, and in his stead, Nebuchadnezzar enthroned Jehoiachin, his son.

<b>and he brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god</b> to praise his idols; he brought the entire captivity there, even the people, and the vessels he brought afterwards to the treasury.

<b>and who have strength</b> Our Sages explained (Sanh. 93b) that they should restrain themselves from laughing, speaking and sleeping, out of fear of the throne, and resist the urge when they feel the need to relieve themselves.
<b>and to teach them the script</b> This refers back to “who have strength.”

### passuk 5
<b>allotted</b> Heb. וַיְמַן, an expression of preparation.
<b>of... food</b> Heb. מִפַּת־בַּג. That is the name of the king’s fare in the language of the Chaldeans. Some interpret פַּת־בַּג, [as] bread, but it does not appear correct, for it is written (below verse 16): “The steward would take away פַּת־בָּגָם... and give them pulse.” Now pulse is not a substitute for bread, but a substitute for cooked food.

<b>And Daniel was there</b> in greatness in Babylon until the first year of King Cyrus. According to the one who says that Hathach (Esther; 4:5, 6, 9, 10) is Daniel; and why was he called Hathach? Because he was cut off (חֲתָכוּהוּ) from his greatness; [according to his explanation] we must say that this is Cyrus I, who preceded Ahasuerus. But according to the one who says that all royal affairs were decided (נֶחְתָּכִים) by his orders, we must say that this Cyrus was Darius II, [who came] after Ahasuerus, and in the days of Darius the Mede, when they cast [Daniel] into the lions’ den, he was not demoted from his greatness, as it is said (6:29): “And this Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and during the reign of Cyrus the Persian.” We learn that during the days of Cyrus I he was [still] in his greatness.
