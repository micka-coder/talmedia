### passuk 1
<b>Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign</b> It is impossible to say this, except that [it happened] in the second year after the destruction of the Temple. So it is taught in Seder Olam (ch. 28), and Scripture called it “of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign,” because he demonstrated his insolence by entering the Inner Sanctum of the Sovereign of the Universe.
<b>and his spirit was troubled</b> Heb. וַתִּתְפָּעֶם רוּחוֹ. Concerning Pharaoh it says (Gen. 41:8): וַתִּפָּעֶם רוּחוֹ, for only the interpretation of the dream was hidden from him, but here, since the dream too was hidden from him, the expression is doubled: וַתִּתְפָּעֶם, an expression of pulsating and beating.
<b>was interrupted</b> Heb. נִהְיְתָה, an expression of breaking like (Ezek. 7:25): “Breach upon breach (הוָה עַל הוָה).”

### passuk 5
<b>The matter has escaped me</b> The thing has left me.
<b>If you do not let me know the dream and its meaning</b> [as translated,] if you do not let me know the dream and its meaning.
<b>you shall be torn limb from limb</b> Aram. הַדָמִין תִּתְעַבְּדוּן. You shall be cut to pieces, and there are many such in the Gemara (Gittin 67b): “Arrange the cuts” (הַדוּמֵי הַדְמּוּהָ).
<b>a dungheap</b> Aram. נְוָלִי, a dungheap.
<b>shall be made</b> Aram. יִתְּשָּׂמוּן an expression of וְיָשֵּׂם, and he will make. They shall be made into dungheaps.

<b>a second time</b> [as translated,] a second time.
<b>we shall tell</b> [as translated,] we shall tell.

### passuk 8
<b>in truth, I know</b> [as translated,] in truth, I know.
<b>truth</b> Aram. יַצִיב, a true and permanent thing.
<b>that this time you are doomed</b> Aram. דִּי עִדָּנָא אַנְתוּן זַבְנִין, that this time you are delivered to death.
<b>because you see</b> because you see that the matter escaped me, but you repeatedly ask me to tell you.

### passuk 9
<b>or if you have prepared yourselves...a false and corrupt word</b> Or if you have prepared yourselves to say before me a false and corrupt word.
<b>until the time changes</b> until the time changes, i.e., before the shadows of evening slant, when the time of morning changes.
“Until the time changes” is an expression of rebuke and an exaggeration: so will he be punished, and the punishment was already delineated above. A similar instance is (Gen. 4:15): “Therefore, whoever kills Cain.”
<b>but</b> the dream; tell me what I dreamed, and I shall know that you will surely tell me the interpretation.

### passuk 10
<b>who...the king’s word</b> who will be able to tell the king’s word.
<b>because</b> Aram. כָּל קַבֵל, lit. all opposite; i.e., our reply is true, in view of the fact that there was never a king who asked anything like this.
<b>such a thing</b> Aram. מִלָה כִדְּנָה, a thing like this.
<b>astrologer</b> who presses the constellation.

### passuk 11
<b>difficult</b> Aram. יַקִירָה, heavy, and its burden is heavy.
<b>and there is no other who can tell it</b> and there is no other who will tell it.
<b>but the angels</b> but the angels whose dwelling is not with flesh and blood.
<b>whose dwelling</b> Aram. מְדָרְהוֹן, their dwelling. The Midrash of Rabbi Tanhuma (ad loc.) [says]: וְאַחֲרָן לָא אִיתַי, and Aaron is not here. A priest who wears the Urim and Tummim is not here to tell you. He said to them, “That Temple was so powerful, and you advised me to destroy it?” Immediately, he became angry and commanded to slay them.

### passuk 12
<b>In view of this</b> in view of this reply.
<b>in great wrath and anger</b> Aram. מַלְכָּא בְּנַס וּקְצַף שַּׂגִיא. The king was in great wrath and anger.
(בְּנַס) means in wrath. (Gen. 40:6): “And behold they were angry (זעַפִים), and Onkelos renders: נסִיסִין.
<b>and ordered to destroy</b> Aram. וַאֲמַר לְהוֹבָדָה. About this “vav” of וַאֲמַר, Menahem and Dunash disputed. Menahem (p. 46) forced himself to make the “beth” of בְּנַס, a radical and did not interpret בְּנַס וּקְצַף as nouns, but as an expression of a verb: was greatly wroth and angry and ordered to destroy. The “vav” in וַאֲמַר forced him to interpret it this way. Dunash (p. 9) says that it is impossible for the “beth” to be a radical, but it is a noun, and he interpreted it in this manner: with great wrath and anger he ordered to destroy, and the “vav” there is superfluous, like the “vav” of (Ps. 76:7): “chariot (וְרֶכֶב) and horse.” But I say that the “vav” is not forced to be superfluous, but so is its interpretation: מַלְכָּא בְּנַס וּקְצַף שַּׂגִּיא, the king was in great wrath and anger, and he ordered in his wrath to destroy them. Accordingly, this is an elliptical verse.
