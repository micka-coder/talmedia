<b>And the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel</b> Now if you ask: since he was the firstborn, why did the kingship not emanate from him? He was indeed the firstborn, but when he desecrated his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph. Now if you ask, if so, why did the sons of Joseph not reign? He therefore says, “but not to be reckoned in the genealogy as the first born,” [i.e., the sons of Joseph were not meant] to take the share of the kingship, but only the birthright, because Judah was the most fit to reign even if Reuben had not defiled the birthright and it had not been taken from him.

### passuk 2
<b>Because Judah prevailed over his brothers</b> as it says (Gen. 49:9): “Judah is a lion’s cub.”
<b>and the one appointed as prince was to be from him</b> the kingship emanated from him, and for this reason the king was called נָגִיד, since he is the one who leads [the people] out and brings them in [the Aramaic root נגד means to pull or lead.] And the birthright and the throne were taken from Reuben, and the throne was given to Judah, as it is written: “Because Judah prevailed over his brothers”; but the share of the birthright was given to Joseph, to his two sons.

<b>whom Tillegath Pilneser exiled</b> He preceded Sannecherib, and this was their sequence: Pul was [king] when Menahem the son of Gadi was crowned (II Kings 15:19f.), and (ibid. verse 29): “...in the days of Pekah the son of Remaliah, Tiglath Pileser the king of Assyria came,” and in the days of Hoshea the son of Elah, Shalmaneser the king of Assyria came (ibid. 17:3), and in the days of Hezekiah was Sannecherib (ibid. 18:13), but our Rabbis explained (Sanh. 94a) that Pul and all the rest of them are identical with Sannecherib.
<b>he was the prince of the Reubenites</b> at the time that Tiglath Pileser exiled him.

<b>tracing their genealogy to their generations; the heads were Jeiel and Zechariah</b> The meaning is: I traced only part of the genealogy of Reuben, but the main part of his genealogy is in the chronicles of the kings of Israel. Jeiel and Zechariah were the heads, through whom their genealogy was completed.

<b>and until Nebo and Baal Meon</b> For in the ancient days, before they came into Israel’s hands, they were called Nebo and Baal Meon after their pagan deities, (lit. their abominations), for it was the custom of the heathens to call their pagan deities after their cities until that day. But when they came into Israel’s hands, they changed their names, as it is written (Num. 32:38): “Nebo and Baal Meon their names being changed,” i.e., Israel changed their names, but Sibmah, since it was not named for their pagan deities, they did not change its name. In <i>Megillah</i> (unknown) it is explained that Nebo and Baal Meon are names of pagan deities.

<b>and they strayed after the gods of the peoples of the land whom God had destroyed from before them</b> The meaning is, they went astray after the gods of the peoples of the land. And which people? [Those] whom God had destroyed from before them [Israel], whose god could not help them [the pagans]. And they [Israel] did not ponder the matter, [reasoning] that since He destroyed them [the pagans] from before them [Israel], and it [their god] could not help them, it would certainly not be able to help us.

<b>he is the one who served in the Temple that Solomon built</b> Some explain that Azariah was the first Azariah, and from Azariah to Seraiah, who lived at the time of the destruction of the Temple, were eight priests. Accordingly, they emended in <i>Yoma</i> in the first chapter (9a), and in <i>Leviticus Rabbah</i> (21:9), and in <i>Siphre</i>, <i>parashath Phineas</i> (Num. 25:12), that eight high priests served in the First Temple. Some say that there were eighteen. But neither one is a viable theory because Zadok was the first who ministered in the time of Solomon. Moreover, which Amariah was in the days of Jehoshaphat, about whom it is written (II Chron 19:11): “... and behold, Amariah the head priest”? Now he was Amariah the son of Azariah, who lived in the days of Uzziah and in the days of Hezekiah, who was after Jehoshaphat. If you say [that it was] Azariah the father of Seraiah, then where was Hilkiah the High Priest who lived in the days of Josiah? Rather we must count from Zadok, and there were twelve priests from Zadok until Seraiah, and so we find in an exact version of <i>Leviticus Rabbah</i>. Now that which the Scripture writes: “... he was the one who served in the Temple,” is explained in <i>Sefer Yerushalmi</i> (source unknown. Perhaps <i>Sifre Zuta, Korah</i> 18:7 is meant) as follows: Did he alone serve, and did he serve in the days of Solomon? Did not other priests serve as well? But because he risked his life for the sanctity of the Temple by not allowing Uzziah to burn incense, it is said: “he was the one who served in the Temple that Solomon built,” and he was the Azariah who lived in the days of Uzziah (ibid. 26: 17, 20) and in the days of Hezekiah, and Azariah the son of Ahimaaz was Amariah the priest who served in the days of Jehoshaphat, just as Uzziah is called Azariah, as is written (II Ki. 15:1): “In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam etc, Azariah... became king.” And Azariah the son of Ahimaaz was called Zechariah, as it is written (II Chron. 26:5): “And he was wont to seek God in the days of Zechariah who understood the fear of God, etc.”

<b>And Jehozadak went when the Lord exiled Judah and Jerusalem</b> And the verse in the Book of Haggai (1:1): “Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the [High] Priest,” does not [mean] that Jehozadak ever served in the high priesthood, for he was exiled to Babylon in the days of Jeconiah, as it is written: “And Jehozadak went when... exiled etc.,” but Joshua his son was the High Priest when they ascended from Babylon during the time of the Second Temple. Now why was Azariah the son of Seraiah the scholar not the High Priest, but [instead] his nephew Joshua the son of Jehozadak? This is the reason: because Joshua ascended with Zerubbabel many days and years before Ezra ascended.
