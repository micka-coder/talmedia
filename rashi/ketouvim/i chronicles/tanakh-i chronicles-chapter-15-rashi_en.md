<b>except the Levites, for the Lord chose them</b> i.e., God chose the Levites [to carry the Ark], and not a cart, for because we placed it in a cart, Uzza was punished, and that is what is stated further: “For from the beginning, [when] you were not [the bearers], the Lord our God made a breach in us, for we had not sought Him properly,” for we placed it in a cart.

<b>And with them, their brethren the second in rank</b> second in rank to them as gate sentries.
<b>Zechariah Ben</b> That was his name; and all these singers and gate sentries [served] on the road by bringing the Ark. The singers and the gate sentries that David stationed after they placed the Ark into the tent that David had pitched for it and in the Tabernacle of Shiloh, were gate sentries, but they were not gate sentries while on the road, because not that many gate sentries were required. Therefore, they became singers, with the exception of two, Berechiah and Elkanah (verse 23). All this was on the road, but when the Ark rested, the singers became gate sentries.

<b>And the singers: Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, etc.</b> To make a resounding voice, they were appointed over those musical instruments.

### passuk 20
<b>And Zechariah and Aziel, etc.</b> Those, mentioned in the preceding verse as being gate sentries, were here transferred to become singers.
<b>over alamoth</b> over those instruments with which they played those psalms, entitled: “To the conductor, on alamoth, etc.”

### passuk 21
<b>And Mattithiah and Eliphelehu, etc. with harps on the sheminith to conduct</b> those musical instruments upon which they play the psalms entitled: “For the conductor, on the sheminith.”

<b>And Chenaniah, the leader of the Levites in song</b> In what was he a leader? In בַּמַּשָּׂא, in raising [the voice in]song.
<b>he would chastise in song</b> He would chastise and reprove them concerning raising the voice in the melody of the song, whether to raise the voice or lower [it].
<b>because he was an expert</b> in raising [the voice] in the melody, and the expression of מֵבִין applies to the study of voice. A similar instance is found (below 25:7): “And their number with their brethren, trained in song to the Lord, every expert (מֵבִין) etc.,” and it is written (ibid. verse 8): “and they cast lots, etc.,...expert (מֵבִין) with student.”

<b>And it came to pass when God helped the Levites</b> - Heb. בֶּעְֹזר. The “beth” of בֶּעְֹזר is vowelized with a “segol,” but as a rule, it is vowelized with a “pattah.” The meaning of “when [God] helped,” is that they did not err when they carried the Ark as they had erred in the beginning when Uzza died. And in the Book of Samuel (II 6:13), it says that when they had trodden six paces, they made this sacrifice. Our Rabbis derived from here that the Ark carried itself.

### passuk 27
<b>And David was enwrapped in a linen robe</b> - Heb. מְכֻרְבָּל enwrapped, as in Daniel (3:21): “their robes (וְכַרְבְּלָתְהוֹן).” A similar case is the comb (כַּרְבַּלְתָּא) of a rooster.
<b>and all the Levites</b> were likewise enwrapped in linen robes, and since David was a singer like the Levites, he too wore their raiments, which they wore, and proof of this - to distinguish between the unclean and the clean: It was the custom of the heathen kings and princes, that when they would dine with their priests according to their custom, they would don the garb of their priests.
<b>and on David was a linen ephod</b> like the ephod of Aaron, which was like two felt cloths, one in the front and one in the back, and it reached to his loins, and the girdle was woven from it, and he would gird himself with it.

### passuk 28

### passuk 29
<b>And Michal the daughter of Saul, etc.</b> Since the Book of Chronicles is for David’s honor, it does not write here what Michal said to David, as is written in Samuel (II 6:20): “How esteemed was the king of Israel today, who appeared today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the idlers would appear!” because it was a disgrace for David that a woman said that to him.
