<b>the second, Daniel</b> But in II Sam. (3:3) it says: “And the second (sic), Chileab, of Abigail.” It is explained in <i>Midrash Vayechulu</i> (<i>Ozar Midrashim</i>, p. 156) that David married Abigail after Nabal died, and they suspected that her son was Nabal’s. Therefore, David called him by two names: Chileab and Daniel. Daniel God judged him (sic); Chileab he resembles his father.

<b>the sixth, Ithream, to Eglah his wife</b> [The] Midrash [asks]: Was she his only wife? But she bellowed like a heifer when she bore him, and that she was beloved to him like a heifer [and was affectionately called Eglah, a heifer], like (Judg. 14:18): “If you had not plowed with my heifer,” and because of the endearment of Michal, he calls her “his wife.”

<b>and Eljada and Eliphelet</b> In II Sam. (5:16) Scripture counts Eliphelet only once and counts only seven [sons], but here, he counts nine. The reason is that his son Eliphelet died, and another son was born to him later who was likewise named Eliphelet. He is the one counted there, and also Elishama. Elishama he counts here twice. We can say similarly that he died and another son was born to him, and also one of these died and seven remained. For this reason, he counts there only seven, and the nine that he counts here are for David’s honor, that he had many sons, for indeed the entire Book was written because of the honor of David and his posterity.

<b>Ahaziah his son, Joash</b> From Solomon to Joash were eight generations, and since David foresaw that his seed would perish in the days of Joash through Athaliah, as is written in this Book (II Chron. 22:10): “... she arose and destroyed (וַתְּדַבֵּר),” (from the expression of דֶּבֶר pestilence, through poison), he stood in prayer and uttered a psalm (Ps. 12): “For the conductor on the sheminith,” [alluding to an] eight stringed [instrument] (other editions: in number) “for the eighth generation.” (v. 2): “Save, O Lord, for the pious are gone, etc.” And Joash escaped, and from Joash to Josiah are eight generations, for David foresaw that Josiah and his sons would all go to their doom: this one was slain [i.e., Josiah. Perhaps he means Jehoiakim and Zedekiah’s sons as well] and this one’s eyes were gouged out [Zedekiah]. And he [David] prayed again on the sheminith, for the eighth generation (Ps. 6:1f.): “O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger,” and because of his prayer, the sons of Jehoiakim survived, and throughout the entire Book of Psalms, there are only these two mentions of the sheminith. And from Jeconiah (other editions: Jehoiakim) until (verse 24): “Anani seven,” which is [an allusion to] the King Messiah, as it is written: (Dan. 7:13): “... and behold, with the clouds of (עֲנָנֵי) the heavens,” are thirty eight sons, including both sons and generations of the sons. The Holy One, blessed be He, did this because he [David] recited thirty eight praises to Him, as it is written in the Book of Ezra (sic) (I Chron. 29:10 13). From “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, etc.” until “and to strengthen,” are thirty eight words.

<b>and the sons of Shemaiah: Hattush, and Jigal, and Bariah, and Neariah, and Shaphat six</b> They are, in reality, only five, but there is a reason, as is written below (25:3) concerning the watches of the Levites: “Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Isaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah six,” but they are only five.
