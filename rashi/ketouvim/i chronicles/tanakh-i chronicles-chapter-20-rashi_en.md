<b>Now it came to pass at the time of the return of the year</b> when there are grasses in the field to feed the horses.

<b>and in it was a precious stone</b> in the crown.
<b>and it was set on David’s head</b> Some explain that it was literally on David’s head. It is, however, amazing how his head could endure it. Our Sages, however, explain that there was a magnet in it (<i>A.Z.</i> ad loc.). I heard in Narbonne that it is the prevalent custom in the land of Ishmael to suspend the king’s crown over his head, and he sits opposite it below on a throne, and that which is written: “... and it was on David’s head,” means that it appeared as though it were on his head.

<b>Now it came to pass after this that a war arose in Gezer</b> That which is missing here is written in Samuel (II 21:15): “And the Philistines waged war again with Israel, and David went down with his servants and they fought against the Philistines.” And this too was not written here because of David’s honor, for it is written there: “... and David became faint,” and it is written: (ibid. 16): “And Ishbi, who was one of the sons of Raphah, was in Nob, etc., and he was girded with new armor, and he thought to smite David,” and had it not been for the aid of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, he would have fallen into the hands of Ishbi in Nob and because of that disgrace, [the Chronicler] did not mention these things here.
<b>then Sibbecai the Hushathite smote Sippai of the sons of Rapha</b> But in Samuel (II 21:18), it is written: “Saph, who was one of the sons of Rashah,” who was the brother of Goliath the Philistine and Ishbi in Nob.

<b>And Elhanan the son of Jair smote</b> He was one of David’s mighty men.
<b>Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, and the staff of his spear was as [thick as] a weavers’ beam</b> like the round stick about which they wrap the cloth while weaving. Jonathan translated that verse in Samuel: And David the son of Jesse, the weaver of the dividing curtain of the Temple, slew. He interprets Jair (יָעִיר) as being similar to the Lebanon forest (יַעַר). He was paid in kind: Let David, whose mother wove the dividing curtain for the Temple with a weavers’ beam, slay Goliath, whose spear staff was as thick as a weavers’ beam. Now why does Scripture call him Elhanan? Because God favored him (ה' חֲנָנוֹ). I believe that Goliath the Gittite is not identical with Goliath the Philistine. One reason is that there [I Sam. 17:23] he called him Goliath the Philistine. Another reason is that above it is written: “... then Sibbecai the Hushathite smote Sippai of the sons of Rapha,” and also below it is written: “and he too was born to Raphah.” Since he does not mention that Goliath the Gittite was a son of Rapha, it proves that he [Goliath the Gittite] was not her son

<b>and there was a man of great stature</b>. This is similar to (Num. 13:32): “big in stature,” and since he was so tall that he had to be measured, he calls him a man of measure.
<b>and his fingers were six and six</b> Twelve on his hands and twelve on his feet, and in Samuel (II 21:20) it says: “twenty-four in number,” i.e., one beside the other, so that one can count them, and this also was his strength, for he was able to grasp the sword with the great strength of his hand. And in Tractate <i>Bechoroth</i> (45b) it is explained why it is written: “six and six, totaling twenty-four.” It is necessary, because if it were written, “six and six,” we would say six on one hand and six on one foot. Therefore, it says, “twenty- four.” And if it would say, “twenty-four,” I would say seven on one and five on the other. Therefore, it says, “six and six, totaling twenty-four.”
