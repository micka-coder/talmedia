<b>because his father showed me kindness</b> when David took his father, his mother, his brothers, and his father’s household and settled them in the region of the king of Moab, as it is written (I Sam. 22: 3): “And David went from there to Mizpeh Moab, and he said to the king of Moab: Let my father and mother come out now, etc.” And the children of Moab came and slew them all except Elihu, David’s brother, who fled to the land of the children of Ammon. Nahash, the king of the children of Ammon, accepted him, for they [David’s brothers] were no longer mentioned, except Elihu, as it is written in the grouping of the princes (below 27:18): “Of Judah: Elihu of the brothers of David.” That is the meaning of “for his father showed me kindness.” And it was on the basis of that hatred that David smote Moab and abused them more than his other enemies, as it is written (II Sam. 8:2): “And David smote Moab, etc.”

### passuk 3
<b>Do you think that David honors your father</b> Is it not written in their Torah (Deut. 23:7): “You shall not seek their peace or their prosperity?” Do you think that he is forsaking the commandment of his God and is coming to greet you, and that he sent comforters in honor of your father? Is it not in order to investigate, etc.?

<b>their garments</b> - Heb. מַדְוֵיהֶם, like (Lev. 6:3): “The priest shall put on his linen garment (מִדּוֹ).”
<b>in half up to their groin</b> - Heb. הַמִפְשָׂעָה, up to their private parts, both front and back, and in Samuel (II 10:4): “שְׁתוֹתֵיהֶם, their private parts,” like (Isa. 20:4): “... with their private parts (שֵׁת) bared, the shame of Egypt.”

<b>from Aram Naharaim and from Aram-Maacah</b> There were many Arameans, and that is the meaning of Aram-Maacah - the Arameans dwelling in Maacah. Some Arameans dwelt by the Euphrates River, and [likewise] Aram-Zobah; but Aram, without a surname, is the main part of the nation. Similarly, the Ammonites dwelling in Ammon are called Ammonites, but the main part of the nation was in other places, and so, the children of Esau in the land of Seir, but the main part [of the nation] dwelt in Edom.

<b>were by themselves in the field</b> They divided their armies into two battle arrays: the children of Ammon were in one array at the entrance of the city against all Israel, and the kings who were with them in the second array were by themselves in the field behind Israel.

<b>into the hands of Abshai</b> To Abishai, who is called Abshai throughout the entire Book of Chronicles, both in the written text and in the reading, except for these two cases, which are exceptions to the rule according to the Masorah. The reason that he is called Abshai in this entire Book is because it was written in David’s honor, and it is not honor to call his nephew Abishai, meaning: “I, too, am as esteemed as David because my [grand]father was Jesse [Yishai]” Therefore, in this entire Book, he is called Abshai, and in the entire Book of Samuel he is called Abishai, except once, where he is called Abshai: (II Sam. 10:10): “And the rest of the people he gave over to Abshai his brother.” This is according to the Masorah, because Jesse was the father of his mother, Zeruiah, who was his mother.

<b>and Shophach the general</b> And in Samuel (ad loc.) it is written: “and Shobach the general.” Our Rabbis explained in Sotah (42b): “Shobach, because he was as tall as a dovecote (שׁוֹבָךְ). Shophach, because he would shed (שׁוֹפֵךְ) blood like water.”
