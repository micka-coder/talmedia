### passuk 6
<b>with much power</b> of words and rebukes for His sins [other editions read: my sins] will He contend with me?
<b>not...coercion</b> smiting and coercion. He will not cast His coercion and His awe upon me. (It may also be interpreted:) Nothing but [this] will He cast on me, for He will not cast on me anything but the contest of the rebukes for my sins; [that,] but not false accusations.

### passuk 7
<b>There</b> in the place of our contest.

### passuk 8

<b>east</b> as it is stated (Exod. 27: 13): “on the east side (קדמה), eastward.”

<b>when He made it</b> When He created it, He did not make the place of His throne there, that I should see it there.
<b>see</b> Heb. אחז, the Aramaic translation of אֶרְאֶה, I will see. Proof of this is that the accent is under the “aleph.” Now, if it were an expression of holding (אחיזה), the accent would be at the end of the word, under the “cheth.”
<b>He wraps up the south</b> He covers the face of the south before me in order that I should not see Him.

### passuk 10

<b>to His path</b> Heb. באשרו, to His path, like (below 31:7), “If my foot (אשרי) has turned away from the road”; (Ps. 40:3), “He has established my paths (אשרי).”
<b>and do not turn away</b> I am not accustomed to turn away.

### passuk 12
<b>more than my daily bread I kept the words of His mouth</b> More than my daily food I was eager to keep the words of His mouth. [The expression חקי] is like (Prov. 30:8), “my daily bread (לחם חקי),” my food.

### passuk 13
<b>But He</b> Since He is One in the world and knows the knowledge and the thoughts of the creatures, and what they have to reply to Him, therefore replies are prepared before Him.
<b>and who will answer Him</b> Therefore, what His soul desires, He does.

### passuk 14
<b>For He will complete my sentence</b> I know that He will not draw back His hand until He completes the sentence of His decrees, the retribution that He has decreed against me.
<b>and there are many such things with Him</b> For He did many such things.

### passuk 15
<b>Therefore</b> Since He does not requite man according to his ways.
<b>I am startled by Him</b> and when I ponder His ways, I am frightened of Him.
