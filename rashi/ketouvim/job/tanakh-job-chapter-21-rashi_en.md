<b>Bear with me</b> Heb. שאוני, endure me.

### passuk 4
<b>Am I speaking to man</b> Why should you make an issue of my complaint? Am I complaining to a man like me that he should listen to me? <b>Why then should I not be short of breath</b> to cry out from my straits?

### passuk 8

### passuk 9
<b>peace from fear</b> Demons had no power over them.

### passuk 10
<b>His bull impregnates</b> a female.
<b>and does not fail</b> He does not eject into her inferior sperm, which would be cast out of her body without impregnating her. Every expression of געילה means casting out, and so it is in the language of the Mishnah (Avodah Zarah 75a), One must purge them (מגעילן) with boiling water. Similarly (II Sam. 1:21), “for there the shield of the mighty was rejected (נגעל).” Its anointing was cast out, and it was as though it had not been anointed with oil, for they were accustomed to anointing the leather shields in order that it be smooth and cause the spear or javelin that strikes it to glide off. It is like (Isa. 21:5), “princes, anoint a shield.”
<b>his cow bears young</b> She gives birth to her young at the proper time.
<b>and does not abort</b> before its time.

### passuk 11
<b>They send forth their infants like sheep etc.</b> At the time of his birth, he would go and dance immediately, and if he would meet a demon, he would battle with him, and his mother would say to him, “Bring me a pair of scissors and I will cut your umbilical cord,” in Haggadath Bereishith, “Go and light a candle for me,” in Gen. Rabbah (36:1).

### passuk 12
<b>They raise</b> They would raise their voice in song with the tambourine and the harp. The flute (עוגב) is only an expression of sensual laughter (עגבות) (aboyement in French, barking.) So I heard.

### passuk 13
<b>and in a moment they descend to the grave</b> When his dying day arrived, he would die in a moment, easily, without suffering.
<b>they descend</b> Heb. יחתו, they descend, which is in Targum נחיתוּ.

### passuk 14

### passuk 15
<b>and what will it avail us</b> What benefit do we have if we pray to Him? We do not need Him for the drops of rain, because “a cloud would ascend from the earth” (Gen. 2:6).

### passuk 16
<b>Behold, is not their prosperity in their hand</b> This is a question: Is not all their prosperity in their hand?
<b>The counsel of the wicked has distanced itself from me</b> Job was boasting that he saw them [the wicked] and was not counted among them.

### passuk 17
<b>How long? May the lamp of the wicked be snuffed out</b> This refers back to the above, to (verse 7) “Why do the wicked live on?” How long will You lengthen this time [the lifetime of the wicked]? Then he continues and curses them, “May the lamp of the wicked be snuffed out...”
<b>lots</b> Heb. חבלים, the lot that they deserve.

### passuk 18

### passuk 19
<b>Should God lay away his violence for his sons</b> This is a question. Is this just, that this one should sin all his life and die in peace, and his violence and his wickedness the Holy One, blessed be He, should lay away for his sons, to punish them?
<b>Let Him requite him so that he should know</b> it is a praise to the Holy One, blessed be He, that He Himself requite the wicked man his recompense so that he understand that he dealt wickedly.

### passuk 20
<b>Let his eyes see his ruin</b> Heb. כידו, his ruin, but I cannot find a comparison in the Bible. However, according to the context of the verse, it appears to mean ruin, and so, many did not find a comparison to it. (כידו An expression of אֵידוֹ, his ruin. The “aleph” is substituted by a “chaff.”)

### passuk 21
<b>For what does He care about his house after him since the number of his months has been cut off</b> For what does he care (saklirir in Old French) or desire in his house after his death, to worry in his lifetime about the retribution destined to befall them, since the number of his months has been cut off and they will end before the evil that the Omnipresent promised them, viz. (Gen. 6:3) “therefore his days shall be 120 years.” This is what I said to you (verse 5), “Turn to me and be silent.”

### passuk 22
<b>Can anyone teach knowledge for God</b> Is there anyone among you who is in the place of God, who can teach the knowledge of what this standard is [i.e., the standard of God’s judgment]?
<b>But He judges high-handedly</b> Heb. והוא רמים ישפוט. [He punishes the exalted.] Those like me, and the righteous and the esteemed, He chastises, judges, and requites, like (below 24:18), “and he will not turn in the way of the vineyards,” stated in regard to Noah and Methuselah in the Aggadah of [chapter] Chelek (Sanh. 108a). Another explanation: Can anyone teach God knowledge? That is, do I have to teach Him knowledge to judge fairly? He Himself knows that it is so, but He passes high- handed judgments with His loftiness and His greatness, and He does not care to be exact. I heard this one but not the first one.

### passuk 23
<b>This one</b> The wicked man.
<b>dies</b> (Is punished.) <b>in his full strength</b> in the appearance of his perfection, lacking nothing.
<b>tranquil</b> Heb. שַׁלְאֲנָן, like שַׁאֲנָן.

### passuk 24
<b>His pails are full of milk</b> Heb. עטיניו. This is the language of the Mishnah (Menahoth 86a): “He packs it (עוטנו) in the olive press.” They gather the olives together, and their oil forms globules and gathers in its midst in order to be ready when he presses it in the press, and that vessel in which they gather it in order for its oil to gather within it is called “ma’atan.” Here too, his milk and his moisture and fat are called “atinav.”

### passuk 25
<b>And this one dies with a bitter spirit</b> Those that are exalted and holy to Him—them He requites immediately.

### passuk 26
<b>Together on the earth they lie</b> After their death, it is not recognizable to the people who is good and who is bad, because this one is like that one; they lie on the earth together.

### passuk 27
<b>Lo, I know your thoughts and the devices that you wrongfully think against me</b> You do wrong to think injustice.

### passuk 28
<b>For etc.</b> Because of the evil that has befallen me, you say, “Look, where is the house of this man who was a prince, and where is the tent and the dwellings of the other wicked men?” That is to say that he is like them. Because of his wickedness, his house was lost. (Now why do you rely on your tranquility?)

### passuk 29
<b>Have you not asked etc.</b> All these parables you are composing about me.
<b>and their signs</b> which they made known to you, you shall not make strange to yourselves by not paying attention to them, like (Gen. 42:7), “But he made himself a stranger (ויתנכר) to them.”

### passuk 30
<b>That</b> They told you that... <b>the wicked man is reserved for the day of calamity</b> The wicked man is withheld and spared from evil and reserved for the day that is appointed for his calamity, like (below 38:23), “That I have saved for a time of trouble.” I laid them away and spared them to let them know until the day of battle and war.

### passuk 31
<b>Who will tell His way to His face</b> Who is the great king who will tell His way to His face and will not fear Him? How exalted He is! That is the Holy One, blessed be He, Who did.
<b>and who will requite Him</b> Who will requite Him with the recompense for His wickedness?

### passuk 32
<b>But he will be borne to the grave</b> He will ultimately be borne to the grave.
<b>and he will hasten to be beside the stacks of grain</b> when he is buried in the fields beside the stacks of grain.

### passuk 33
<b>clods</b> balast in French (which the sailors bring into the holds of the ships in order to weigh them down.)
<b>as there were innumerable ones before him</b> Those who draw after the same way. All these devices you think against me.

### passuk 34
<b>Now how do you comfort me with futility</b> Since only betrayal remains of your replies, the replies of wisdom are forgotten and lost from you, and of your replies, [those] left in your hands are only replies of betrayal. <b>betrayal</b> This word (מעל) is a noun, which is why it is voweled with a <i>kamatz</i>, and the accent is on the first syllable.
