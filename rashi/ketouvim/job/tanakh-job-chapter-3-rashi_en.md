### passuk 2
<b>Job’s Address</b><br><b>Now Job raised his voice</b> Heb. ויען, he cried out, for every expression of עניה in the Torah is only an expression of raising the voice, and the “father” of them all is (Deut. 27:14): “The Levites shall raise their voices (וענו) etc. with a loud voice.”

### passuk 3
<b>in which I was to be born</b> This is a future expression, that he was saying, “Would that the day in which I was destined to be born be lost, and then I would not have been born.”
<b>and the night</b> That too should have been lost.
<b>when one said</b> that the reporter, upon whom it was incumbent [to report] would say.
<b>“A man has impregnated.”</b> That my father impregnated my mother. Concerning a female, it is customary to say הרתה, she conceived, and concerning a male, it is customary to say, הורה, he impregnated the female.
<b>and the night when one said</b> This is one of the places where Scripture abbreviates its words because it is unnecessary to explain who [the subject] is, and the expression means, “the sayer said.” [Similar to this is (Amos. 6:12), “Will horses run on the rock, or will one plow with cattle?” He should have said, “Will a man plow with cattle?”] However, our Sages said, “The angel appointed over conception is named Laylah.”

### passuk 4
<b>May that day be dark</b> constantly; every year, when that day arrives.
<b>let God not seek it from above</b> for good.
<b>and let no light shine upon it</b> Heb. נהרה,light, like צהר, which is translated נהור.

### passuk 5
<b>defile it</b> Heb. יגאלהו, like (Malachi 1:7), “defiled (מגאל) bread”; “How have we defiled You (גאלנוך)?” an expression of contamination.
<b>the shadow of death</b> Heb. צלמות, the shadow of death, darkness that never lights up.
<b>like demons of the day</b> Heb. כמרירי, demons who rule at noon, like (Deut. 32: 34), “Ketev Meriri,” who rules at noon; as it is stated (Ps. 91:6): “from Ketev, who rules at noontime.”

### passuk 6
<b>it shall not rejoice among the days</b> Heb. אל יחד, it shall not rejoice, as in (Exod. 18:9), “And Jethro rejoiced (וַיִחַד).” (Another explanation is: It shall not join. This does not appear in certain editions.)

### passuk 7
<b>lonely</b> Alone and lacking any man or creature.

### passuk 8
<b>curse it</b> Heb. יקבהו, curse it, as in (Num. 22:17), “curse (קבה) for me.”
<b>those who curse the day</b> Those who curse their days, since they intend to pronounce a curse because of their anguish.
<b>those destined to be childless in their union</b> Heb. ערר לויתן, to be childless (ערירים) in their union; to join their mate in the union of man and wife, without children. And I saw in the Jerusalem Talmud (Moed Katan 1:5) that עֹרֵר means, to lament their mate when he dies, as in (Moed Katan 1:6): A person may not inspire lamentations (יערער) for his dead relative.

### passuk 9
<b>its evening</b> Heb. נשפו, the darkness of its night.

### passuk 11
<b>Why did I not die from the womb?</b> why was I not ready to die immediately upon my emergence from the womb? He speaks in the future tense, as though he were standing now on the day of his emergence from the womb and saying, “Why will I not die now, and why did I not... <b>emerge from the belly and perish?”</b> Why was my death not imminent?

### passuk 12
<b>Why did knees receive me</b> Why did the knees of my mother receive me before my death?

### passuk 13
<b>I would be lying</b> Heb. ושכבתי, I would be lying in the grave.

### passuk 14
<b>who build ruins for themselves</b> It is customary for those who seek fame to rebuild ruined cities as a memorial for themselves, as in (Isa. 58: 12), “And those coming from you shall be called the repairer of the breaches.” That is to say, with princes and famous people. Or, would that I was unknown, and I would be like a stillborn. What Scripture states: I was not like a hidden stillborn, is because it continues with the language with which it started to speak, viz. in the interrogative, and it refers to “Why did knees receive me...or why was I not like a hidden stillborn child?”

### passuk 15

### passuk 16
<b>like infants</b> Heb. כעוללים, infants. He calls them עוללים because they are all play and dirt, like (below 16:15), “And I sullied (ועללתי) with dust,” and like (Jud. 19:25), “and abused (ויתעללו) her the entire night.”

<b>the toiler light</b> He who grew up with toil and trouble—why did He give him perpetual light and not slay him at birth?

### passuk 21

<b>and they spy after it</b> Heb. ויתפרהו, and they spy after it.
<b>more than after hidden treasures</b> More than people spy after hidden treasures.

<b>and God hedged him in</b> He made a wall in front of him to shut him up in a prison, as in (Hos. 2:8) “Behold I will close off your way.”

### passuk 24
<b>comes</b> Heb. תבא, lit. shall come.
