<b>Who can bring a clean thing</b> from a putrid drop, and semen, which is unclean? Not one of them is clean, that he should not sin.

### passuk 5
<b>If his days are limited</b> If he is requited with this recompense—that his days are limited to a day set for death, and the number of months is set with You, and [that] You set this boundary—and he will no longer exist in the world, [then] this payment is sufficient for You.

### passuk 6
<b>Turn away from him</b> during those few limited days and let him rest from pain until he desires, in his old age and the weakness of his strength, the day of his death like a hireling who desires the completion of his day’s work; for his passing from the world is decided and more definite than all passings.

<b>it washes away</b> i.e., the flood. <b>its aftergrowth</b> of the stone, to be transformed into dust so that something should grow in it. As the aftergrowths of the harvest grow, so will the aftergrowths of this earth be transformed to stone.
