<b>A song of Asaph. Truly God is good to Israel, etc.</b> Since the topic of this psalm deals with the troubles that befall Israel, he commences it in this manner. And this is the meaning: Although I cry out and am dismayed at Israel’s troubles, I knew that the Holy One, blessed be He, is good to them, and that He brings evil upon them for their own good, in order to give them merit in the life of the world to come.

### passuk 2
<b>But as for me</b> before I laid this to my heart.

<b>For I envied the perverse</b> Those who pervert their ways, whose tranquility I would see.

<b>For there are no fetters to their death</b> Heb. חרצבות, an expression of tying, as (Isa. 58:6): “to undo the fetters (חרצבות) of wickedness,” meaning the locks of the fetters with which they bind the poor. Here, too, there are no pains to their death. Those who die among them die healthy, [strong as] a palace, without pains. But our Rabbis explained חַרְצֻבּוֹת as an abbreviation, meaning that they are not (שאין) frightened (חרדין) or saddened (עצבין) by the day of death (Shab. 31b). Another explanation: that the Holy One, blessed be He, does not delay (מאחר) their desire (צביונם).

<b>And when I ponder</b> in my heart.
<b>to know this</b> what the manner of the Holy One, blessed be He, is. <b>So it is iniquity in my eyes</b>. This manner appeared to me as iniquity and not justice.

### passuk 17
<b>Until</b> I came <b>to the sanctuaries of God</b>, which are in Jerusalem, and saw what happened to Sennacherib. Then I understood the end of the wicked, that it is to destruction. Then I said, “All the good that comes to them is only slippery places; for the Holy One, blessed be He, makes their way slippery, that it should be easy and smooth, so that they should not put their heart to return to Him, and they should perish.”

Now that the cantillation sign is on ואחר, this is its interpretation: (and afterwards,) You took me to glory; You drew me to You for glory and beauty.

### passuk 25
