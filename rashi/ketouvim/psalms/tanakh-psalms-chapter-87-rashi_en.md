<b>I will remind Rahab and Babylon of My beloved ones</b> This too He spoke of You: I shall remind Egypt and Babylon of My beloved ones, to bring them as a gift, as the matter that is stated (Isa. 66: 20): “And they will bring all your brethren, etc., a tribute to the Lord.”
<b>Behold Philistia and Tyre with Cush</b> They too, like Egypt and Babylon, will direct their attention to seek out and to remember each one.
<b>“This one was born there”</b> This one was of a family of those born in Zion, as the matter that is stated (Isa. 27:12): “and you will be gathered one by one.”

### passuk 5
<b>And to Zion it will be said, “Man after man was born in her”</b> And when they bring them as a tribute to the Lord, it will be said to Zion concerning each one, “This is [one] of those who were exiled from you,” or “from their generations.” Another explanation: The Psalmist says, “I will mention to my people and to my beloved ones the greatness of Egypt and Babylon, whose greatness they now see. Behold Philistia and Tyre with Cush, because they are near Rahab and Babylon, all the nations exalt them [the Israelites] and say about them, ‘This one was born there,’ in Egypt or Babylon.”
<b>And to Zion it will be said, “Man, etc.”</b> And this praise that is now [directed] to Rahab and Babylon will be turned around to Zion, and concerning it they will say, “So-and-so and so-and-so were born in her.”
<b>and He will establish it on high</b> And the Holy One, blessed be He, will establish it above all the cities.

### passuk 6
<b>The Lord counts in the script of the peoples, “This one, etc.”</b> This is a transposed verse, and סלה, forever, which is said at the end, refers to the beginning: When the Lord counts in the script of the peoples forever. That means that in the future, when the Holy One, blessed be He, inscribes the nations for an abhorrence, He will count the Israelites who are assimilated among them and those who were coerced [to abandon Judaism] among them and extract them from their midst, and [He shall] say, “This one was born of those of Zion,” and He will choose them for Himself. This is what Isaiah says (66:21): “And from them, too, will I take for priests and for Levites.” From the nations bringing them for tribute, I shall take those assimilated among them. And there will be among them priests and Levites who are unrecognizable, but they are revealed to Me, says the Lord. Now where did He say it? (Deut. 29:28) “The secret things belong to the Lord, our God.”
