<b>He shall plague peoples in our stead</b> Heb. ידבר עמים תחתינו, He shall afflict the peoples with a plague (דבר) instead of our soul(s) so that His wrath will subside through them, and we will be saved, as the matter that is stated (Isa. 43:3): “I have given Egypt as your ransom, etc.” Menachem, however, associated it with an expression of leading (p. 61).
