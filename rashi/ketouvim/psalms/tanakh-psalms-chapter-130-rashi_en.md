<b>For forgiveness is with You</b> You did not give permission to an agent to forgive, as it is said (Exod. 23:21): “for he will not forgive your transgression.”
<b>in order that You be feared</b> for this, so that no man will rely on the forgiveness of another. (I found this.)

### passuk 5
<b>I hoped, O Lord; yea, my soul hoped</b> one hope after another hope, similar to (above 27:14): “Hope for the Lord, be strong and He will give your heart courage, and hope,” and similar to “among those who await the morning, those who await the morning.”

### passuk 6
<b>My soul is to the Lord among those who await the morning</b> I am among those who look forward to the redemption.
<b>those who await the morning</b> They look forward and repeatedly look forward for one end after another end. (I found this.)
