<b>Not only have they committed no injustice</b> They are praiseworthy if all this is in them.
<b>they walked in His ways</b> Although they committed no injustice, their reward is incomplete unless they walked in His ways. And so he says (above 43:15): “Shun evil and do good.” Even though you shun evil, everything is not complete unless you do good. Midrash Aggadah.

### passuk 4

### passuk 5
<b>My prayers are that my ways should be established</b> Heb. אחלי. The “aleph” is a radical that is sometimes dropped, like the “aleph” in (Job 13:17): “and my speech (ואחותי) in your ears,” and the “aleph” of (II Kings 4:2): “a jug (אסוך) of oil.” <b>My prayers</b> These prayers of mine are that my ways should be established Likewise (II Kings 5:3): “The supplications (אחלי) for my master should be that he go before the prophet who is in Samaria, etc.” The supplications of those who pray should be that he go before the prophet who is in Samaria, and it is an expression of wishes, souhait in French, as a person says, “If only I were a prophet and a sage.”

<b>is crushed</b> Heb. גרסה. My soul breaks because of longing, as (Lev. 2:14): “crushed kernels (גרשׂ) of the fresh ears.” Menachem (p. 183), however, associated “from longing” (לתאבה) with (Amos 6:8) “I destroy (מתאב) the pride of Jacob,” and both are an expression of breaking.

### passuk 56
<b>This came to me</b> A crown that fits me [was given] to me as a testimony and to my children who are fit to reign, as a reward for my having kept Your precepts. So did the Sages of Israel explain it. I found this:

### passuk 57
<b>to keep Your words</b> the fulfillment of your words, with which You gave me hope, in that You are my portion.

### passuk 58
<b>I entreated You</b> Heb. חליתי, from the expression of (Lam. 3:24): “‘The Lord is my portion,’ says my soul; ‘therefore, I will hope (אוחיל) to Him.’”

### passuk 59

### passuk 60

### passuk 61
<b>Bands of wicked men robbed me</b> Heb. עודני. Bands of wicked men plundered me, like (Gen. 49: 27): “in the morning he will eat plunder (עד).” In this manner, Menachem (p. 131) associated it. It may also be interpreted as an expression of עוֹד, more, i.e., increased and outnumbered me.

### passuk 67
<b>Before I recited</b> to You about Your commandments, before I uttered them in the study halls, I erred in them and sinned. But now that I have recited them, I kept your Torah, for study teaches me to turn away from sin: therefore, I beg of You, “Teach me the best of reason and knowledge.”
<b>I recited</b> Heb. אענה, an expression of studying and reciting in the study hall, like (verse 172): “My tongue will utter (תען) Your word.” Similarly (Mal. 2:12): “From the man who commits it, the Lord shall cut off one of acuity or erudition (ועונה) from the tents of Jacob.” An ingenious one among the sages, and one who can answer among the students.

### passuk 68

### passuk 69
<b>Willful sinners have heaped false accusations upon me</b> Heb. טפלו, they joined upon me, and similarly (Job 14:17): “and You have attached Yourself (ותטפל) to my iniquity.”

### passuk 70

### passuk 71

### passuk 72

### passuk 73

### passuk 74

### passuk 76

### passuk 77

### passuk 78
<b>for they condemned me falsely</b> For no reason they condemned me. (I found:) I say that this deals with the embarrassment [of David] when they would say to him, “If one is intimate with a married woman, with what [method] is his death penalty?” when he [David] had not sinned.

### passuk 79
<b>May those who fear You...return to me</b> For the Sanhedrin separated from him when he became a mezora because of that iniquity [with Bath-sheba]. Even if she was divorced, whoever puts his eyes on her, anyone who touches her, will not be guiltless.

### passuk 80

### passuk 85
<b>Willful sinners have dug pits for me</b> Those who come to disqualify me do not do so according to the Torah.

### passuk 86
<b>All Your commandments are faithful</b> A Moabite and not a Moabitess; but they pursue [me] to prohibit me [from entering the congregation of the Lord].
<b>they pursued me in vain</b> My enemies pursued me in vain.

### passuk 87
<b>They almost destroyed me</b> I was on the earth as nothing, but I stood with my strength. Likewise (verse 95): “Concerning me, the wicked hoped to destroy me” from entering the congregation, and so (above 116:16): “You loosed my thongs.”

<b>Of every finite thing</b> To every conclusion of a thing there is an end and a boundary, but Your commandments have no end or boundary to their conclusion.

### passuk 97

### passuk 98
<b>Each of Your commandments makes me wiser than my enemies</b> Concerning Doeg and Ahithophel they [the Rabbis] said that their final conclusions did not agree with adopted practice. The secret of the Torah is in my hands forever, for I gained understanding from all my teachers; I learned a little from this one and I learned a little from that one (after I learned from my distinguished teacher).

### passuk 99
<b>are my conversation</b> All my conversation was about them.

### passuk 100

### passuk 101

### passuk 106

### passuk 107
<b>I have been... humbled</b> Heb. נעניתי, I have been made poor and humble, like (Exod. 10): “to humble Yourself from before Me”; (Hos. 5:5), “And the pride of Israel shall be humbled before them,” which Jonathan renders: וימאךְ. And a poor man is accounted as dead. Therefore, revive me according to Your words.
<b>I have been...humbled</b> Heb. נעניתי. This is a sickness that deranges the mind, and it is called עֲוִית convulsion, in the language of the Mishnah (Chul. 60b).

### passuk 108
<b>The freewill offering of my mouth</b> Words of appeasement that my mouth offers You. Every נדבה, is an expression of appeasement.

### passuk 109
<b>My soul is constantly in my hand</b> I have very often been in serious danger, close to death, but nonetheless, I have not forgotten Your Torah (following the pattern of “Whoever has a headache should engage in the Torah”).

### passuk 110

### passuk 111

### passuk 112
<b>forever on their paths</b> On their paths and their roads.

### passuk 113
<b>I hate those who harbor iniquitous thoughts</b> Those who think thoughts of iniquity, like (Job 20: 2): “Therefore, my thoughts (סעפי) answer me”; (I Kings 18:21), “between two ideas (הסעפים).” When you read סְעִפִים, it concerns the thought, but when you read סֵעֲפִים, the language refers to those who think it.

### passuk 114

### passuk 115

### passuk 116

### passuk 117
<b>and I shall constantly engage in Your statutes</b> Heb. ואשעה, and I shall engage, like (Exod. 5: 9): “and let them not engage (ישעו) in useless things.” Another explanation: [It is] an expression of telling and reciting, as we translate (Deut. 28:37): “and a recitation (ולשועין).”

### passuk 118
<b>You trampled</b> Heb. סלית, You trampled; You made them a thing trampled on, like (Lam. 1: 15): “The Lord trampled (סלה) all my mighty men.”

### passuk 119

### passuk 120
<b>bristles</b> Heb. סמר, like (Job 4:15): “it made the hair of my flesh stand on end (מסמר),” as a person whose hair stands on end, harizer in Old French, se herisser in modern French, to bristle.
<b>and I dread Your judgments</b> The retribution for Your decrees.

### passuk 121

### passuk 122
<b>Be surety</b> Heb. ערב, garantis in French, to vouch for. Be a guarantor for me against the evil (i.e., be a guarantor that I keep Your precepts).

### passuk 123
<b>and for the word of Your righteousness</b> The promise that You promised me.

### passuk 124

### passuk 125

### passuk 126
<b>A time to do for the Lord, etc.</b> This goes back to the verse preceding it: Enable me to understand, and I shall know Your testimonies, to know a time to do for Your name. What should they do, those who made Your Torah void, to find good will and forgiveness, and that You should be found by them, and I will do so for every transgression that I have committed. Our Rabbis, however, derived from it [from this verse] that we may transgress the words of the Torah in order to make a fence and a wall [a safeguard] for Israel, e.g. Gideon and Elijah on Mount Carmel, who sacrificed on high places (Ber. 63a). I saw [it] further expounded upon in the Aggadah (Yerushalmi Ber. 9:4, Mid. Sam 1:1) as meaning: A person who is idle and leisurely, who devotes [only occasional] times to his Torah, makes void the covenant, for an idle person must toil in the Torah all hours of the day.

### passuk 127
<b>Because I loved</b> Heb. על-כן. Because I loved Your commandments, it is fitting that You teach me a time of good will, and what I should do for You that You should accept me. There are many [instances of] על-כן that are to be interpreted as “because”; e.g., (Gen. 33:10): “because (כי על-כן) I have seen your face”; (Num. 10:33). “because (כי על-כן) you know our encampment”; (Isa. 15: 7), “Because of (כי על-כן) the many things they did.”

### passuk 128
<b>Because I considered all precepts of all things upright</b> All precepts, everything that You commanded in your Torah.
<b>I considered upright</b> Heb. ישרתי. They were upright in my eyes, and I said about them that they are upright. Because of this, I deserve that You forgive me and favor me.

### passuk 129
<b>Your testimonies are hidden</b> They are covered, and your testimonies are hidden from the sons of men. There are easy commandments for which He gave a large reward, such as sending away the nest.
<b>therefore, my soul kept them</b> All of them, because it is not known which is better.

### passuk 130
<b>The commencement of Your words enlightens</b> The beginning of your words enlightened the heart of Israel, that You understated the simple, by Your statement (Exod. 20:2): “I am...Who took you out.” You let them know the favor that You did for them—that You acquired them from the house of bondageto know that You are their Master, and they should accept Your kingdom upon themselves. (Exod. 20:3): “You shall not have another god, etc.” and afterwards You made Your decrees (Cf. Mechilta ad loc.). Another explanation: <b>The commencement of Your words enlightens</b> The beginning of Your words in the Creation was (Gen. 1:3): “Let there be light.”
<b>You make the simple understand</b> From there, everyone will understand and will commence with words of Torah. Tanchuma (Vayakhel 6).

### passuk 131
<b>and panted</b> Heb. ואשאפה, an expression of swallowing, as (Jer. 2:24): “snuffs up (שאפה) the wind.”

### passuk 132

### passuk 133

### passuk 134
<b>Redeem me from the oppression of man</b> From the evil inclination, which oppresses the people (from the good path—Parshandatha). In other commentaries I found: <b>Redeem me from the oppression of man</b> Redeem me so that no man oppress me.

### passuk 135

### passuk 136

### passuk 137

### passuk 138

### passuk 139
<b>My zeal incenses me</b> Heb. קנאתי. The zeal with which I am zealous for Your name against those who forget Your words, cuts me and incenses me against them.

### passuk 140

### passuk 141
<b>I am young and despised</b> As it is stated (I Sam. 17:14): “And David was the youngest.” I am despised to the extent that I humble myself beside those who engage in the Torah, to learn, for I have not forgotten Your precepts; [nor have I refrained] from searching and debating with them about Your righteousness that is within them [the precepts], which is righteousness and truth to eternity; and even though troubles have befallen me, they were my occupation. And forever enable me to understand their righteousness and I shall live by them (Deut. 30:20): “for it [the Torah] is your life and the length of your days.”

### passuk 142

### passuk 143

### passuk 144

### passuk 145

### passuk 146
<b>and I shall keep</b> (The acronym of, עֵדְוֹתֶיךָ is דמה בן פֶרֶץ ; the “vav” is vowelized with a “holam,” but in the other instances, it is עֵדֹתֶיךָ ; the “daleth” is vowelized with a “holam.”)

### passuk 147

### passuk 148
<b>watches</b> Half the night, two watches, and according to one who says that the night consists of three watches, David would rise from bed at the first third of the night and engage in Torah until midnight, as it is said: “to speak of Your word.” From midnight on, he would engage in songs and praises, as it is said (verse 62): “At midnight, I rise to give thanks to You.”

### passuk 149

### passuk 150
<b>Pursuers of lewdness have drawn near</b> a counsel of sins. They follow the counsel of their sins and distance themselves from your Torah to draw near to the counsel of their evil.

### passuk 151
<b>You are near</b> to these faraway people, who distance themselves from Your Torah, if they repent of their way.

### passuk 152
<b>From before, I knew from Your testimonies</b> Before the thing came about, I knew it from Your testimonies. Before they inherited the land, You commanded them about the first fruits, heave offerings, and tithes, and before You gave them rest from their enemies, You commanded them (Deut. 25:19): “And it will be, when the Lord Your God gives you rest, etc.” to appoint a king, to annihilate Amalek, and to build the Temple.
<b>to the world</b> For You established Your testimonies concerning all things destined to be until the end of the world.

### passuk 153

### passuk 155

### passuk 156

### passuk 157

### passuk 158

### passuk 159

### passuk 160
<b>The beginning of Your word is true</b> And the end of Your word is not true? Rather, the end of Your word proves that the beginning of Your word is true. For, when the nations heard, “I am the Lord your God,” and “You shall not have [another god],” and “You shall not take, etc.,” they said, “Everything is for His benefit and for His glory.” As soon as they heard, “Honor, etc.; You shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery,” they admitted [that they had erred] about the beginning of Your word, that it is true.

### passuk 161

### passuk 162
<b>I rejoice over Your word</b> Over Your promise that You promised me. Another explanation: Over one of Your enigmatic statements, when I understand it. Our Rabbis, however, interpreted it as referring to circumcision, for [when] David was in the bathhouse and saw himself without zizith, without tefillin, and without Torah, he said, “Woe is to me, for I am naked of all commandments.” As soon as he thought of the circumcision, he rejoiced and said when he emerged (from the bathhouse), “I rejoice over Your word.” [This refers to] circumcision, which was first given with a saying (אמירה), and not with speaking (דיבור), as it is said (Gen. 17:9): “And God said (ויאמר) to Abraham, ‘And you shall keep My covenant.’”

### passuk 163

### passuk 164
<b>Seven times a day</b> In the morning, twice before the reading of “Shema” and once after it, and in the evening, twice before it and twice after it.
<b>for Your righteous judgments</b> For the reading of the Shema, which consists of words of Torah.

### passuk 165

### passuk 166

### passuk 167

### passuk 168
<b>for all my ways are before You</b> You know all my ways.

### passuk 169
<b>according to Your word, enable me to understand</b> the words of Your Torah; according to their law and in the order in which they stand.

### passuk 170

### passuk 171
<b>will utter</b> will speak.

### passuk 172
<b>My tongue will proclaim</b> Heb. תען. Every [expression of] עַנִיָה is an expression of a loud voice, and the “father” of them all is (Deut. 27:14): “And the Levites shall proclaim (וענו) and say [to all Israel with a loud voice].”
