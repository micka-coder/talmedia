<b>in the city of our God</b> In the future, when He builds His city, He will be great and praised because of it.

### passuk 3
<b>The fairest of branches</b> Heb. יפר נוף, a city that is a fair branch; an expression of the branches (נוף) of a tree. Another explanation: A fair bride, for in the coastal cities they call a bride ninfe (nymphe in Greek) (R. H. 26a). Menachem (p. 124) associated it with (Josh. 17:11) “the three regions (הנפת)” (i. e., there [on Joshua] he explains that it means regions; as Rashi explains there: contree in French, a region. In this manner, Rashi explains in Joshua 11:3,) but Dunash (p. 34) defined it as an expression of a branch of a tree, and Mt. Zion was called “the fairest of branches” because it is (near—Shem Ephraim) the Mount of Olives.
<b>the joy of the entire earth</b> Now what is its joy? The north side, angles in French, angle, corner. Redak (Shorashim) also defines it as corners, and so in Ezekiel (46:21). The northern side of the altar [was] where sin offerings and guilt offerings were slaughtered, and whoever was grieved because of the sins he had committed would bring a sin offering or a guilt offering, and he would be forgiven. He would then emerge happy, and the sacrifices would benefit the entire world.

### passuk 7

### passuk 8
<b>With an east wind</b> That is an expression of retribution, with which the Holy One, blessed be He, recompenses the wicked, as it is stated (Exod. 14:21): “and the Lord led the sea with a strong east wind, etc.” Similarly (Ezek. 16:27, 26): “The east wind has broken you in the heart of the seas”; (Jer. 18:17), “Like an east wind, I will scatter you before the enemy.”
<b>the ships of Tarshish</b> They are the neighbors of Tyre, which is Africa, and it is of Edom.

### passuk 9
<b>As we have heard</b> the consolations from the mouth of the prophets, so have we seen [them].

### passuk 10
<b>We have hoped, O Lord, for Your kindness</b> The prophet repeatedly prays to the Holy One, blessed be He, and says, “We hoped and waited for Your kindness, to see this Your salvation in the midst of Your Temple. Menachem (p. 65) interpreted it as an expression of thought, as (Esther 4: 13): “Do not think (אל תדמי).”

### passuk 11
<b>As is Your name, O God, so is Your praise</b> Just as Your name is great, so is Your praise great in everyone’s mouth.

### passuk 12
<b>the daughters of Judah shall exult</b> All the other cities of Judah are as daughters to Zion, as (Num. 32:42): “and he captured Kenath and its daughters.”

<b>Encompass Zion</b> You who are building it.
<b>count</b> Heb. ספרו, an expression of counting. You should know how many towers it requires.

### passuk 14
<b>to its walls</b> Heb. לחילה, to its walls, as (Lam. 2:8): “rampart (חיל) and wall.”
<b>raise its palaces</b> Heb. פסגו, raise its palaces, as (Deut. 3:17): “beneath the rapids of the elevation,” which is translated רָמָתָא, the high place.
<b>in order that you may tell</b> its height and its beauty to the generation after you.

### passuk 15
<b>as in youth</b> Heb. על-מות, as a man who leads his young son slowly. Menachem (p. 133) interpreted it as an expression of eternity, and so is its interpretation: will lead us to eternity.
