<b>for I am a pious man</b> that I hear my insults and my disgraces, and I am able to wreak vengeance; yet I remain silent. So it is in Aggadath Tehillim (Mid. Ps. 86:1).

<b>Grant me a sign for good</b> so it may be apparent to others that You have forgiven me.
<b>and let my enemies see</b> the sign and be ashamed. But the Holy One, blessed be He, did not listen to him to grant the sign during his lifetime.
