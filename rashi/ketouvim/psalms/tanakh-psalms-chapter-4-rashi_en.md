(resplendir) in Old French, gleam, as (Zech. 9:16), “crown stones gleam (מתנוססות).” But I do not envy them, for joy has been given into my heart from the time that the corn and the wine of the nations have increased. I am confident that if those who anger Him [have] such [tranquility], how much more will those who perform His will have it in the future, which is the day of the reception of their reward!
