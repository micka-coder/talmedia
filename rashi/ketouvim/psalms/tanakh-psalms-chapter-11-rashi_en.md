<b>How do you say to my soul, “Wander from your mountain, etc.</b> This is on the order of (I Sam. 26: 19): “for they have driven me today from cleaving to the Lord’s heritage,” for they drove him out of the [Holy] Land to outside the [Holy] Land, and here he says, “I took refuge in the Lord [hoping] that He would restore me to cleave to His heritage. How do You, who drive away my soul, say to me,...<b>“Wander from your mountain”?</b> Pass over your mountain, you wandering bird. For every wandering person is compared to a bird that wanders from its nest, as it is written (in Prov. 27:8): “As a bird wandering from its nest, so is a man wandering from his place.” For your nest has wandered, because we have driven you from the entire mountain like a wandering bird. The masoretic spelling is נודו [plural] because it is also expounded on in reference to Israel, that the nations say that to them.

### passuk 4
<b>The Lord is in His Holy Temple</b> Who sees and tests their deeds, and although His throne is in Heaven and is lofty, His eyes see you on the earth.

### passuk 5
<b>The Lord tries the righteous</b> And if, because I suffer and am pursued by you, you boast, saying (below 71:11), “God has forsaken him,” it is not so, but so is the custom of the Holy One, blessed be He, to chasten and to test the righteous but not the wicked.

### passuk 6
<b>charcoal</b> Heb. פחים, an expression of charcoal (פחם).
<b>burning</b> Heb. זלעפות, an expression of burning. Menachem (p. 79) interprets it as an expression of (Isa. 28:2) “a storm of destruction (שער קטב).” Likewise, (in Lam. 5:10), “because of the heat of (זלעפות) hunger”; (below 119:53), “burning (זלעפה) seized me.” That is to say, (as in Ezek. 27:35), “became greatly alarmed (שערו שער).” (The quotation from Menachem appears only in several early printed editions, and not in any manuscript.)

### passuk 7
<b>For the Lord is righteous; He loves [workers of] righteousness</b> and has mercy on the righteous and loves those whose faces see the straight [way], in whose sight the straight way is proper.
<b>whose faces approve of the straight</b> This refers to “The Lord is righteous; He loves [workers of] righteousness and those whose faces approve of the straight [way].” Our Sages [Mid. Ps. 11:2, Sanh. 26a, Lev. Rabbah 5:5] interpreted “the wicked tread the bow” as referring to Shebna and his company, and they interpreted “the upright of heart” as referring to Hezekiah and his company.
<b>For the foundations are destroyed</b> If the foundations are destroyed by them, what did the Righteous One of the world accomplish? The sequence of verses, though, does not concur with the Midrash.
