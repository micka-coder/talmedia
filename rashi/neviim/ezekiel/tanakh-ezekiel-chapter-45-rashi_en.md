### passuk 1
<b>And when you divide the land by lot</b> For they are destined to divide the land of Israel into twelve strips, not like the original division, in which the large [tribe] had [land] according to its number and the small [tribe] according to its number, and there were two or three tribes on one strip. Now the portions are equal and they are like rows in a vineyard, from the western side to the eastern side, as delineated at the end of the Book.
<b>an offering to the Lord</b> in which to build this Temple.

### passuk 2
<b>From this shall be</b> From this offering, there shall be for the needs of the Sanctuary: five hundred rods for the Temple Mount and the rest shall be for houses for the priests, as is delineated at the end of the Book.

### passuk 3
<b>And with this measurement</b> [lit. from this measurement.] With the measuring rod by which the 500 by 500 square of the Temple Mount was measured, as is stated above (42:20): “To four sides he measured it; its wall all around, five hundred rods, etc.”
<b>you shall measure the length</b> of 25,000 rods and the width of 10,000 rods. Because he did not explain in the first verse what the 25,000 are, whether rods or cubits, he had to say, concerning the 25,000 measures that they were measured with the measuring rod by which the five hundred by five hundred of the Temple Mount were measured.

### passuk 4
<b>It is the holy portion of the land</b> Rearrange the verse: “The remainder of the holy portion, which is from that land, shall be for the priests, the ministers of the Sanctuary, who come near, etc. The holy portion of the land is this offering.”
<b>for the priests, the ministers of the Sanctuary</b> The remainder over the 500 of the Temple Mount; 12,250 to the east and correspondingly to the westthe Sanctuary [being] in the center 4,750 to the north, and correspondingly to the south.
<b>and it shall be for them a place for houses</b> this remainder, which surrounds the Sanctuary.
<b>and the hallowed part shall be for the Sanctuary</b> And the middle five hundred by five hundred shall be hallowed for the Sanctuary, e sentije al sentuere in O. F., and consecrated for the Sanctuary.

### passuk 5
<b>And twenty-five thousand</b> rods in length, and ten thousand in width, you shall separate as another strip beside this one, south of this one, for the Levites. It is explained at the end of the Book that it is in the south. Twenty chambers shall be for the Levites in the perimeter of the Sanctuary in order to guard the House and to provide beauty, and the remainder of the strip shall be used for their own needs.

### passuk 6
<b>And, [for] the property of the city</b> The environs of the city; its properties meant for ordinary dwelling, in which the Israelites may build houses.
<b>you shall give a width of five thousand</b> in the south of the second one, and a length equal to the measurement of the two strips. It is found that the entire offering is square, twenty-five [thousand] by twenty-five thousand.
<b>corresponding to the offering of the holy portion</b> in the measurement of the length of the strips of the offering of the holy portion.
<b>for the entire House of Israel it shall be</b> That third strip shall be the dwelling place for non priests.

### passuk 7
<b>And for the prince, on either side of the offering of the holy portion and of the possession of the city</b> At the end of the section, he divides the land of Israel from east to west into thirteen strips: twelve as the number of the tribes each one twenty-five thousand rods wide, and its length equaling the length of all the land of Israel and one strip as an offering whose length is from the eastern border to the western border, and whose width is twenty-five thousand rods, just as each of the other portions. And from that strip he separated in its center the three strips stated above, which [all together] are twenty- five thousand by twenty-five thousand. And the remainder to the east until the end of the border of the land, and to the west, as well, shall be for the prince from either side to the east and to the west.
<b>alongside the offering of the holy portion and alongside the possession of the city</b> opposite the entire breadth of the three strips separated for the offering of the holy portionof the strips of the priests, the Levites, and the property of the city.
<b>from the western side, westward</b> from the west of the offering of the holy portion and the city until the west of the boundary.
<b>and from the eastern side, east ward</b> And from the east of the offering to the eastern boundary, opposite one of the portions of the tribes delineated at the end of the Book, which are from the western boundary of the land of Israel, until the eastern boundary.

### passuk 8
<b>In the land he shall have it for a possession</b> [Heb. לָאָרֶץ Jonathan renders: This land shall be for the prince as a possession.
<b>shall no longer defraud</b> [Heb. יוֹנוּ,] an expression for monetary fraud; they take away their inheritance forcibly for they rob their inherited property

### passuk 9
<b>take away your evictions</b> Take away [your practice] of evicting My people from their inherited property.

### passuk 10
<b>ephah</b> of the dry measure.
<b>bath</b> of the liquid measure.

### passuk 11
<b>one volume</b> [Heb. תֹּכן,] a word denoting number, like (Exod. 5:18): “and a quota (וְתֹכֶן) of bricks you must deliver.” One measure is equivalent to one tenth of a “homer” of dry measure, which equals thirty “se’ah,” and which is a tenth of a “homer” of liquid measure. “Ephah” and “bath” are words for [units of] measurement.
<b>the homer</b> [A measure known further as] kor, moy(d) or muy(d) in Old French, a measure.
<b>shall contain</b> [Heb. לָשֵּׂאת,] similar to לָקַחַת, to take, and so too did Jonathan render it: לְמֵיסַב. A tenth part of a “homer” shall be a “bath,” and a tenth part of the dry “homer,” shall be an “ephah.”
<b>according to the homer shall be its volume</b> The total amount of [the volume of] the “bath” and the “ephah” shall be according to the size of the “homer.”

### passuk 12
<b>And the shekel is twenty gerah</b> Twenty “ma’ah.”
<b>twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels</b> totaling sixty shekels.
<b>shall the maneh be to you</b> Le zent in O. F., the 100 (zuz weight). Menahem, however, connected it to the word מִנְיָן, a number (p. 118). We have here 240 “zuz,” [four zuz to a shekel]. From here we derive that the “maneh” of the Sanctuary was double, and they added a sixth to it in Ezekiel’s time, totaling 240 [zuz] (Men. 77a). When Scripture divided it into three parts and did not write simply, “sixty shekels shall the maneh be for you,” it commanded to make from it a weight one third of it, and a weight equaling a fourth of it, and a weight of the ordinary “maneh” as it was originally. So too did Jonathan paraphrase: a third of the “maneh” shall be twenty “selaim” of silver; a “maneh” of silvertwenty-five “selaim”; a fourth of a “maneh”fifteen “selaim”; altogether, sixty “selaim”; and the great “maneh” of the Sanctuary shall be for you.

### passuk 13
<b>a sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat</b> This amounts to one out of sixty. Whoever wishes to give little shall not give less than this, and this is what they said (Ter. 4:3): “A stingy person gives one out of sixty.”
<b>and you shall separate a sixth</b> And you shall separate a sixth of an “ephah” for the “terumah” of a “homer” of barley.

### passuk 14
<b>And the rule of the oil</b> regarding tithes.
<b>the bath, [which is a measure of] oil, etc.</b> The “bath,” which is a measure of oilthis is its tithe: the “bath” will be from a “kor.” I found [the following]: The tenth that the “bath” represents as a tithe shall be from a “kor.” How so? The tithe of a “bath” is from a “kor.” Dix measures in French, ten measures. This word is used for itself and for others, like (Num. 7:9): “the service of the Sanctuary,” (ibid. 4:33): “the service of [the families of] the sons of Merari.”
<b>ten baths</b> shall equal a “homer” for you. Then it will be possible to take from it one “bath” as a tithe.
<b>for ten baths are a homer</b> because the “homer” will consist of ten “baths” for you. So too did Jonathan render it: one out of ten is the “bath” in relation to the “kor” for ten “baths” are a “kor”.

### passuk 15
<b>And one lamb from the flocks</b> A special one of his flocks, and so too said Moses (Deut. 12: 11): “and all the choice of your pledges, le meilleur in Fr., the best.
<b>out of two hundred, from Israel’s banquet</b> Our Rabbis expounded (Pes. 48a) this as regarding libations [coming] from a multiplicity of two hundred [times as much of the original wine] as remained in the pit after the wine of “orlah” or of “mingled species in the vineyard” fell into it. From here it is derived that “orlah” and “mingled species in the vineyard” are nullified in two hundred [times as much].
<b>from Israel’s banquet</b> from what is permissible for Israel. All your sacrifices shall be drink that is fit for Israel. The main part of the feast is called by the name of the drink; i.e., the food and also the drink shall be from that which is permitted for Israel.

### passuk 16
<b>to give this oblation</b> mentioned above; it will be [given] with the knowledge of all the people of the land.

### passuk 17
<b>on the prince</b> I say that this “prince” as well as every [mention of] “the prince” in this section means the High Priest; but I heard in the name of Rabbi Menahem that it means the king.

### passuk 18
<b>So says the Lord God: In the first month, on the first of the month, you shall take a young bull [and] without blemish</b> This is the bull of investiture mentioned at the beginning of this section (43:18 27), and he teaches [us] here that the investiture should be on the first of Nissan.
<b>and you shall purify</b> [as translated,] and you shall purify.

### passuk 19

### passuk 20
<b>And so shall you do on seven [days] in the month</b> It may be said that [this means]: And so shall you do all seven, and so too he says above (43:26): “For seven days they shall effect atonement for the altar.” But our Rabbis explained it in Menahoth (45a) in the following manner: And so shall you make [as a sacrifice] a bull that is not to be eaten in [the event of] “seven” tribes who “interpreted the Torah in a new way (שֶּׁחְדֹּשּׁוּ)” and whose tribunal issued a decision that fat is permissible, and seven tribes, (which are the majority of the nation), who acted on their word. They must bring a bull for communal error.
<b>because of mistaken and simple-minded men</b> This is a transposed verse: And you shall expiate the House from mistaken and simple-minded men. After the seven days of investiture, whenceforth the altar will be dedicated, they shall bring their sin-offerings and their guilt-offerings, and they will attain atonement, for at the time that Israel attains atonement, the House attains atonement.

### passuk 21
<b>seven days</b> [Lit. weeks of days,] because they commence from it to count seven weeks.
<b>unleavened bread shall be eaten</b> and unleavened bread shall be eaten on that festival.

### passuk 22
<b>And the prince shall make on that day, etc.</b> Our Rabbis (Hag. 13a) said that they sought to suppress the Book of Ezekiel for his words contradicted the words of the Torah. Indeed, Hananiah the son of Hezekiah the son of Gurion is remembered for good, for he sat in his attic and expounded on it. But because of our iniquities, what he expounded on these sacrificeswhy a bull is brought on the fourteenth day of Nissanhas been lost to us. I say that perhaps he is dealing with the fourteenth of Nissan of the first Passover in which the fully erected House will be dedicated, and this bull will be brought in lieu of the calf born of cattle that Aaron offered up on the eighth of investiture (Lev. 9:2). [Scripture] tells us that if he will not have offered it up on the eighth day of investiture, he should offer it up on the fourteenth of Nissan in order that he should be initiated for the service before the Festival, for it is incumbent upon him [to bring] the sacrifices and the burnt offering of the appointed time, as is stated above (v. 17): “And the burnt offerings and the meal-offerings and the libations on the festivals...shall devolve on the prince, etc.”

### passuk 23
<b>seven bulls and seven rams without blemish daily</b> But the Torah states (Num. 28:19): “two young bulls, one ram.” We can explain this verse only as meaning seven bulls and seven rams for the seven days, a bull daily and a ram daily, and it comes to teach us that the bulls do not render each other invalid and the rams do not render each other invalid. [I.e., if one bull is missing, the other one may be brought.] So we learned in Menahoth (45a); however, they did not bring proof from this verse but from the verse below (46:6): “But on the New Moon: a young bull from those without blemish, and six lambs and a ram.” But perhaps this too comes to teach the same thing, and this is its meaning: seven bulls and seven rams daily. By adding the sacrifices of each day on its day, they add up to seven bulls for the seven days.
<b>and a sin-offering, a he-goat daily</b> the he-goats of the pilgrimage festivals.

### passuk 24
<b>And a meal-offering...an ephah for a bull</b> the meal-offering of the libations, an “ephah” for a bull. Now I do not know what this means, for the Torah stated (28:20): “three tenths for the bull.” It is possible that it means an “ephah” of flour from which we extract a tenth of fine flour from a “se’ah”, for the “ephah” is three “se’ahs”.
<b>and an ephah for a ram</b> This too is flour from which we extract two tenths of fine flour sifted thoroughly, as we learned (Men. 6:6): The two loaves were two tenths from three “se’ahs”. [The requirement of] an “ephah” for the bull teaches that if he did not find fine sifted flour that yielded that much, he may bring from [flour that yields] a tenth to a “se’ah”.
<b>and for each ephah one hin of oil</b> I do not know why. We may say that it does not mean that he must sacrifice the entire “hin,” but that there were notches in the “hin” and he would sacrifice oil according to the fine flour, according to the sacrificial laws for a bull according to its requirement and for a ram according to its requirement, according to the notches of the “hin”.
