<b>and you hurled</b> [Heb. וַתַּגֵר,] you cast down, as (Micah 1:6): “and I will cast (וְהִגַרְתִּי) its stones down into the valley,” for they would deliver them to their enemies as they fled through their land, and this is what Obadiah (1:14) says: “And you should not have stood by the gap [to cut off their fugitives, nor should you have delivered their survivors on the day of distress].”
<b>on the day of their misfortune</b> when I delivered them into the hands of the enemy.
<b>at the time of the end of their iniquity</b> when the end of their iniquity culminated, and their measure was full.

### passuk 6
<b>I shall make you into blood</b> falling by the sword.
<b>you hated blood</b> You despised the birthright, for its sacrificial service was handed over to them (sic), but “you hated” to filthy yourself with the blood of sacrificial offerings in worship of Me. And the filth of the blood of the slain will pursue you. Others say: You hated the blood of circumcision (Gen. Rabbah 63:13). Others say: You fear murderers just as anyone else, and murderers will pursue you. Others say: “You hated blood,” [meaning that you hated] your brother, who is your flesh and blood.

<b>and your cities will not return</b> [Heb. תָשֹּׁבְנָה,] not as I said about Egypt (above 29:14): “And I will return the captives of Egypt”; (Jer. 49:6): “And afterward, I will return the captivity of the children of Ammon.” And this is what Malachi (1:3) said, “And I hated Esau, and I made his mountains desolate,” for I made them destined for everlasting desolations.

<b>The two nations</b> Israel and Judah. The Midrash Aggadah of Rabbi Tanchuma (source unknown) explains it regarding [the incident in] which Esau went to Ishmael to become his son in law in order to persuade him to contest Isaac concerning the inheritance of Abraham, and [in order that] Ishmael would kill Isaac, and [he thought] “I will be the avenger of blood and kill Ishmael.” This is the meaning of (Gen. 27:41): “Let the days of mourning for my father draw near.” And I will inherit both Isaac and Ishmael.
<b>and the Lord was there</b> He knows your thoughts.

### passuk 11
<b>I shall commit [acts] like your [acts of] wrath</b> like the [acts of] wrath that you exerted against Israel, I will exert against you.
<b>and I shall be known among them when I judge you</b> Then they will recognize My might.

<b>and you have multiplied your words</b> [Heb. וְהַעְתַּרְתֶּם,] you have increased. Similarly (above 8: 11): “and a thick (וַעֲתַר) cloud of incense,” an expression of increase.

### passuk 14
<b>When the whole earth rejoices</b> when I claim My kingdom, for then the whole earth will rejoice, as the idea is stated (Ps. 97:1): “The Lord has reigned; the earth will exult.” Then I will make you a desolation.
