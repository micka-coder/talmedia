<b>Woe to those who sew cushions</b> Heb. לִמְתַפְּרוֹת, coseres(es) in Old French, needle-women; coudre, to sew. They would sew something like small cushions and hang them on the armpits of those consulting them, and they would divine with those cushions with a false divination; and to those whom they wished, they would tell a favorable divination, and to whom they wished, they would tell an unfavorable divination.
<b>armpits</b> Heb. אַצִילֵי, aisselles in French.
<b>armpits</b> Heb. אַצִילֵי יָדַי, like אַצִילֵי יָדַיִם, as in (Hosea 12:12): “the furrows of the fields (שָׂדָי).”
<b>and who make the veils</b> on the heads of people. They, too, are made to divine with, but I do not know what they are. Since it says (verse 21), “And I shall tear them,” I say that they are of cloth, and Jonathan renders: פַּתכּוּמָרִין, embroidered cloths over the heads of idolatrous statues, and so he renders (16:16): “mounds of striped clothing” בָּמוֹתטְלֻאוֹת covered with פַּתכּוּמָרִין “cloths of idolatrous statues.”

<b>for fistfuls of barley</b> Heb. בְּשֳּׁעֲלֵי, like (Isa. 40:12): “Who measured water with his fist (בְּשָּׁעֳלוֹ)?” Jaloynes in Old French, double-handfuls. Another explanation: an expression of a measure.
<b>and for morsels of bread</b> E an piyezes in Old French, and with morsels, that you take as your fee.
<b>to slay souls that will not die</b> i.e., to say about souls that will not die, “These will die,” and to say about souls that will not live, “These will live,” for your divinations are false, and My people accept your false divinations.
