<b>I shall become full from the destroyed [city]</b> I shall become full from the destroyed city of Jerusalem.

### passuk 3

### passuk 4
<b>and I shall remove</b> [Heb. וְסִחֵיתִי,] and I shall uproot, like (Prov. 15:25): “The Lord will uproot (יִסַח) the house of the haughty;” (Deut. 28:63); “and you will be uprooted (וְנִסַחְתֶם) from...”
<b>a smooth rock</b> Since it was built on a rock in the midst of the sea, when it will be demolished and its earth will be uprooted into the sea, the rock will be left bare, and so did Jonathan render: a smooth, bare rock.

<b>And...his catapult</b> [Heb. וּמְחִי קָבָלוֹ.] This is one of the devices of the siege, to throw huge rocks and to strike opposite it, e la hone de sa pereyre in Old French, and the striking of his stone-throwing machine. Others render קָבָלוֹ as desarbalete in Old French, of his war-machines.
<b>with his instruments of destruction</b> [Heb. בְּחַרְבּוֹתָיו,] with tools of destruction that he will bring with him.

### passuk 10
<b>From the abundance of his horses</b> When there are many horses, they raise dust with their feet, which ascends and becomes like a cloud, darkening the earth.

### passuk 16
<b>and they will tremble for [fear of] destruction</b> [Heb. לִרְגָעִים,] for fear of destruction, lest it befall them like your destruction.
לִרְגָעִים as is an expression of breaking, like (Isa. 51:15): “Who splits (ַרוֹגַע) the sea;” (Job 7:5), “my skin split (רָגַע);” (Ps. 35:20), “and against the crushed people of (רִגְעֵי) the earth,” [synonymous with] דִכְּאֵי “the crushed people of the earth.” Menachem, however, explained it (p. 162) in the sense of רֶגַע, a moment, as in (Ps. 30:6): “For His wrath lasts but a moment (רֶגַע).”
<b>and will be appalled</b> [Heb. וְשָּׁמְמוּ,] an expression of bewilderment.

### passuk 17
<b>established from the seas</b> [Heb. מִיָמִּים.] Some vocalize it without a “dagesh” (מִיָמִים) and interpret it to mean “settled from days of yore,” and others punctuate it with a “dagesh” (מִיַמִּים) and interpret it to mean “settled with strength through the seas surrounding her,” and so it is.

<b>by your departure</b> by your departure into exile.

### passuk 19
<b>when [I] bring up the deep upon you</b> “When I bring upon you companies of nations as numerous as the waters of the deep, and many nations will cover you.” Jonathan translated it in this manner, but according to its apparent meaning, first it was given into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, and ultimately, the sea came up and inundated it.

### passuk 20
<b>with those who descend into the Pit</b> with those who descend into Gehinnom.
<b>to a people of old</b> with the other nations who are there from long ago.
<b>like the ruins of old</b> like the cities that were destroyed from times of yore, viz. Sodom and her sister cities.
<b>but I shall bestow beauty upon the land of the living</b> And I shall bestow beauty upon Jerusalem.

### passuk 21
