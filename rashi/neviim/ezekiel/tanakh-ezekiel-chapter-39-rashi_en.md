### passuk 7
<b>and I will no longer cause My Holy Name to be profaned</b> For Israel’s degradation is a profanation of His Name, “inasmuch as it is said of them, ‘these are the people of the Lord’” (above 36:20), and He is unable to save them.

<b>and heat up</b> [Heb. וְהִשִּׂיקוּ,] like (Orlah 3:5): “An oven that they heated up (שֶּׁהִטִיקוּהָ)” in the language of the Mishnah.

### passuk 10

### passuk 11
<b>I will give Gog a place there as a grave</b> A place where there will be a grave for them. Since he is of the seed of Japtheth, who covered his father’s nakedness, he therefore merited burial.
<b>the valley of those who pass along</b> The valley where people pass the Sea of Kinnereth to bring from there Genossar fruits regularly.
<b>the east side of the sea</b> Jonathan renders: on the east of the Sea of Gennasar.
<b>and it will then stop those who pass along</b> [Heb. וְחֹסֶמֶת.] It closes off those who pass, like (Deut. 25: 4): “You shall not muzzle (לֹא תַחְסוֹם).” Because of the many corpses that will fall there, travelers will be prevented from passing through. Therefore, they will pass by them and bury them. Menachem (p. 91) interprets it in his book (Machbereth) to mean that they will close their nose so as not to smell the odor of the corpses.

### passuk 12

### passuk 13
<b>They will bury all the people of the land</b> because they died there.
<b>and they will be renowned</b> All the nations will speak their name as praise and as a sign of kindness: “There are no nations as compassionate as this one; do you find a man who buries his enemy who rose up against him to kill him?”

### passuk 14
<b>Men of continuous employment</b> Men designed to continuously devote themselves to this. Israel will separate out in order to [be able to] pass through the land and gather the scattered [corpses].
<b>burying with those who pass through</b> Burying with (Heb. אֶת) those who pass through; the corpses (אֶתהַנוֹתָרִים) that will block off and hinder the crossing. Those who crossed the ocean will bury them for their own benefit. <b>with those who pass through</b> Heb. אֶת הַעֹבְרִים, with those who pass through. So I heard, and so did Jonathan render.
<b>those who are left on the surface of the land</b> far from the crossing. Those who cross the sea will not occupy themselves with burying them. Those designated to devote themselves to this purpose will bury them.
<b>at the end of seven months</b> the majority of the corpses visible to the eye will have been buried; from then on they will probe through the land in the hidden places, in the briars and among the thorns, and bury whomever find.

### passuk 15
<b>And when they that pass through the land shall pass</b> Wayfarers who see a human bone will construct a marker next to it as a sign that there is a bone of a dead body there, in order that wayfarers and those who prepare ritually pure food should stay away from it.
<b>until</b> the men of continuous employment, designated to search, will come and bury it.

### passuk 16
<b>And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah</b> And also the city whose name is “the city stirring with numerous people,” that is, the wicked city, the masses of its inhabitants will be buried there.
<b>Thus they shall purify the land</b> [i.e.,] Israel will purify their ritually pure foods and their terumoth in the Land.
<b>Hamonah</b> without a “mappiq hey” since the final “hey” serves as an adjective, for הֲמוֹנָה is like הוֹמִיָה, stirring.

### passuk 17

### passuk 18
<b>rams, lambs, he-goats, and bulls</b> kings and dukes, rulers, and princes.
<b>fatlings of Bashan</b> [Heb. מְרִיאִי בָשָּׁן,] An ox given to be fattened is called al meri in Arabic.

### passuk 22

### passuk 23
<b>And the nations will know that for their iniquity they were exiled</b> [i.e.,] the Children of Israel. When they see My might, they will recognize that it was not because of inability that I did not save them but because of their iniquity that I hid My face from them, and they were exiled.

### passuk 24

### passuk 25
<b>and I shall be zealous for My Holy Name</b> And I donned the zeal of salvation and vengeance for the sake of My Holy Name, that it no longer be profaned.
<b>and I shall be zealous for My Holy Name</b> [Heb. לְשֵּׁם,] for the sake of My Holy Name, as in (Num. 11:29): “Are you jealous for my sake (הַמְקַנֵא אַתָּה לִי).”

### passuk 26
<b>And they shall bear their disgrace</b> When I do good to them and I do not recompense them according to their evil, they will bear the disgrace and be ashamed to lift up their faces. Menahem, however, explained וְנָשּׂוּי like (Ps. 32:1): “Praiseworthy is he whose transgression is forgiven (נְשּׂוּי),” an expression of atonement.

### passuk 27

### passuk 28
<b>And I shall no longer leave</b> one of them in exile.
