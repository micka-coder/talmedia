<b>shall be closed</b> Our Rabbis interpreted this verse as referring to the southern wicket, for the gate of the Heichal had a wicket, a small entrance. So we learned in Tractate Middoth (4:2): The Great Gate had two wickets, one in the south and one in the north. No one ever entered the one in the south, of which Ezekiel says, “This gate shall be closed.”
<b>comes through it</b> in the future.

### passuk 3
<b>The prince [I permit]; he is a prince, etc.</b> The prince I give permission. He is a prince, and is esteemed, and it is not fitting for him to sit and eat with the rest of the priests in the chambers.
<b>he shall sit therein</b> in its space.
<b>by way of the hall of the gate he shall come</b> When he enters the Inner Court in order to enter this small gate to eat therein, he shall enter by way of the hall of the Court’s eastern gate and leave the same way. Now since it states below (46:9), concerning: “But when the people of the land come before the Lord on the Festivals, he who enters by way of, etc.” Scripture commanded making the Court a shortcut since that entry was [made] for the sake of appearing [before God]. He must therefore be well seen [i.e., throughout the entire Court]. It was necessary to specify here concerning visits during the rest of the year that he should not make it a shortcut because this visit is not for the sake of appearing, as is that of the Pilgrimage Festivals. This matter is corroborated many more times in this account.
<b>The prince</b> The High Priest is a prince, and because of his importance he will be permitted to eat the meat and bread of hallowed status in that gate, which is opened for him at the time of his eating.
<b>by way of the hall of the gate he shall come</b> By way of the hall of the Eastern Gate he shall enter the Court and come up to that wicket to eat his bread therein.
<b>and by the same way he shall leave</b> For this is not fit for a shortcut, as are the rest of the gates. Throughout the day, when not during the time of the prince’s eating, it shall be closed.

<b>aliens</b> [lit. sons of an alien.] [Sons of] one whose deeds have become alienated from his Father in Heaven; this is an apostate who worships idols. They are the ones “of uncircumcised heart.”
<b>and of uncircumcised flesh</b> [a] priest whose brothers died because of circumcision.

### passuk 8
<b>And you appointed keepers of My watch in My Sanctuary</b> You knowingly appointed in My Sanctuary, people who are not fit to be keepers of My watch.

### passuk 9

### passuk 10
<b>Only the Levites who distanced themselves</b> Only thus shall you do to the Levites who distanced [themselves] from Me and became idolatrous priests and have now repented...
<b>and they shall bear their iniquity</b> from ever approaching My altar again, but they may be appointed to the gates of the House (comandises in Old French, orders). They shall be watchmen and gatekeepers.

### passuk 11
<b>they shall slaughter the burnt offering</b> a service that is valid [if performed] by non priests, slaves, or women.

### passuk 12
<b>as a stumbling block of iniquity</b> priests of idolatry, attracting them to it.

### passuk 15
<b>But the priests, the Levites</b> [i.e., the priests, who are] of the tribe of Levi.
<b>the sons of Zadok</b> Since he was the High Priest who served as the first one in the Sanctuary of Solomon’s days, they are called by his name.
<b>when...went astray</b> [Heb. בִּתְעוֹת,] quand ils erraient, in Fr., when they strayed.

### passuk 16

### passuk 17
<b>when they enter the gates of the Inner Court</b> the Inner Sanctum on the Day of Atonement.
<b>and no wool shall be upon them</b> They shall not wear the blue wool that was in the robe and girdle on the Day of Atonement during the service in the Inner Court.

### passuk 18
<b>they shall not gird themselves in a place that sweats</b> We learned in a baraitha (Zeb. 18b, 19a): They do not gird themselves in a place where they sweat, neither above their elbows nor below their loins, which is a place of sweat, en la suor in O.F., on (whatever causes) sweat. Another explanation: The Torah prohibited the priests from wearing woolen raiment because wool causes the body to sweat (not found in some editions).
<b>hats</b> [Heb. פַאֲרֵי.] c(h)apelas in O.F., hats, head dress.

### passuk 19
<b>into the Outer Court, into the Outer Court</b> Since he was speaking of the Heichal and the Inner Sanctum, and he called them the “Inner Court,” and in relation to them, he should call the Israelites’ Court an “Outer Court,” he therefore had to double it twice to say that he is speaking of the Men’s Court, the area that all Israel enter.
<b>and place them in chambers belonging to the Sanctuary</b> as stated by our master Moses, may he rest in peace (Lev. 16:23): “after that, he shall take off the linen garments which he had put on, etc., and he shall leave them there.”
<b>and they shall not sanctify the people</b> [Heb. וְלֹא יְקַדְשׁוּ אֶתהָעָם, lit. they shall not sanctify the people.] Jonathan renders: and they shall not mingle with the people in their garments, [i.e.,] they shall not touch the people with their holy garments, for ordinary garments are not ritually clean as regards [contaminating] holy garments.

### passuk 20
<b>And [the hair of] their heads they are not to shave</b> to remove all the hair.
<b>but also not to let it grow wild</b> They may not let their hair grow very long.
<b>they must be careful to trim</b> [Heb. כָּסוּם יִכְסְמוּ, (to cut the hair so that it appears)] like spelt (כֻּסֶמֶת), which is arranged on the ear [with] the end of one beside the root of another. So I heard in the name of Rabbi Menahem of blessed memory. It is possible to explain it as an expression for a measure of a medium thing, neither shearing [all the hair of] the head nor letting the hair grow long, but a medium amount, amo(d)ler in O.F., to cut to medium length.

### passuk 21
<b>when they come into the Inner Court</b> to the Heichal.

### passuk 22
<b>but...virgins</b> may the High Priests take. But there are some priests who may take a widow, namely, the ordinary ones, and this is the meaning of “some of the priests may marry”; there are some priests who are permitted to marry a widow.
<b>who is only a widow</b> A real [widow], excluding a divorcee and a woman upon whom the rite of chalitzah was performed; although she is unmarried, she is forbidden even for an ordinary [priest].

<b>And after his purification</b> and after he has separated from the corpse. So was it taught in Moed Katan (15b).

### passuk 27
<b>And on the day that he enters</b> into the Sanctuary for the first time to initiate himself into the service, he shall offer up his sin-offering; this is his one tenth of an ephah [of flour]. In Moed Katan (16a) the following is taught: the regular priest requires one tenth of an ephah on the day of his initiation, as it is stated (Lev. 6:13): “This is the offering of Aaron and his sons, etc.” and as is explained in Tractate Menachoth (51b).

### passuk 28
<b>It shall be to them</b> the priesthood, for an inheritance.

### passuk 29
<b>and everything that is holy</b> [Heb. חֶרֶם,] an expression of sanctity, and so is every expression of חֶרֶם [when used] in the context of hallowed things.

### passuk 30
<b>to bring enduring blessings into your home</b> [Heb. לְהָנִיחַ,] aposer on O.F., (to cause) to rest, settle, as in (Exod. 10:14): “and it rested (וֳיָנָח) throughout all the borders of Egypt.”

### passuk 31
<b>Anything that has died of itself or is fatally wounded, etc.</b> Since nipping the neck of the bird sin- offering was permitted, which is [tantamount to] an animal that died of itself or was fatally wounded [since it is not the normal method of slaughter], he had to warn them concerning [eating] other creatures that died of themselves or were fatally wounded. So our Sages explain.
