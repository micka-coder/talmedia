<b>over the heads of the cherubim</b> Over the heads of the four living beings of the Chariot. In this chapter, he switches over to calling them [all] cherubim because the face of the ox was transformed into the face of a cherub, as it is written in this chapter. Our Rabbis said (Chag. 13b): Ezekiel begged for mercy and transformed it to a cherub. He said before Him, “Master of the world, an accuser cannot become a defender.”

<b>between the wheels</b> Heb. (בֵּינוֹתלַגַלְגַל) [lit. between the wheel.] Wherever it says, “And he said...and he said,” it is meant only to be expounded upon. The Holy One, blessed be He, told Gabriel [to take the coals], but he [Gabriel] asked the cherub to [take them first and then] give them to him so that the coals would cool and the decree would be mitigated. And this is clearly stated in the chapter (verse 7): “and he picked up [the fire] and gave [it] into the hands of the one clothed in linen.”
<b>and cast [them] upon the city</b> He did not cast them immediately, and although the one clothed in linen received them, he did not cast them until six years after he had received them, for the coals were smoldering in his hand for all the six years. And you should know [that this is true] because this prophecy was said in the sixth year, and the city was destroyed in the eleventh year.

<b>until the outer court</b> The Temple Mount. I may think that [it was heard no further] because the sound was low. Therefore, Scripture states: “like the voice of God Almighty when He speaks.” Yet, when it would reach the outer court, it would [suddenly] stop.

<b>and their hubs</b> Heb. וִידֵיהֶם of the wheels. They are the hole in which the [axle of the] chariot turns, called boyol, nave, hub. Jonathan, however, renders: וְאֲשְּׁדַתְהוֹן, and their pourings.
