<b>Shlomo built his [own] house in thirteen years.</b> In work of the Most High he hurried,<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Shlomo built the Beis Hamikdosh in seven years as stated in 6:38 above.</i> but in his own [work] he was slow; the text tells this to praise him.

### passuk 2
<b>The house of the Forest of Lebanon.</b> [Targum] Yonoson translated, “a house for the cooling of kings.”<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, it is called “the house of the forest” because the house was constructed with many wooden pillars which gave it an appearance of a forest; or the house was actually located in the forest of Levanon.—Metzudas Dovid.</i>
<b>And cut beams of cedar.</b> Beams of cedar were along the length of the house. There was a row of columns on the ground and the cut beams from column to column.

### passuk 3
<b>It was covered with cedar.</b> A ceiling over it from above.
<b>On top of the boards.</b> The upper partitions which were on the cut [beams]. Four partitions, one next to the other along the width and extending along the length of the house. Each had openings and windows, because this was a summer home made for air. And on those partitions was the covering of the ceiling. The ceiling was [made] of forty-five boards, three rows of boards (for the three spaces) between the four rows of columns, fifteen boards to each row (i.e., fifteen of them were placed in each space). Their length was along the width of each row and their width was along the length of the house, one next to the other.

### passuk 4
<b>There were three rows of windows.</b> He also made another covering near the three rows of boards and the three rows of lintels,<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi שקפים are lintels. But Radak’s opinion is that שקפים were look-out windows, as in 6:4 above.</i> because the width of fifteen boards did not cover the house in its entire length which was one hundred <i>amohs</i>. And he made near it to cover the house, a covering of small boards placed on small beams which were left (should read “placed”) from one row of [the long] cut beams to the other, three small beams one next to (should read “at the end of”) the other, and lintels on both their sides, similar to a lintel against which the door strikes. And on those lintels the ends of the small boards were placed, the length of the small boards opposite the width of the larger boards which he installed first.
<b>And each window faced the other window.</b> The ends of the boards of this lintel were opposite (the ends of) the boards of this one (lintel).
<b>Window.</b> An expression of “an edge,” and so did Menachem interpret it and he related it to, “to their desired boundary [מחוז],”<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Tehillim 107:30.</i> and every “חזית” in the language of the Mishnah is thus, [as] in the order of arranging the daily sacrifice,<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">See Mishnayos Tamid 2:4.</i> and also “he should made (a ledge) from the outside,” in the chapter of “The Partners” in [Maseches] Bava Basra.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote"> 2a.</i> [Targum] Yonoson also, rendered this, “a projection opposite a projection,” but “שקופים אטומים”<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Above 6:4.</i> and likewise, “רבועים שקף,”<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Below v. 5.</i> he translated them all “beams.”

### passuk 5
<b>And all the entrances and doorposts.</b> Because, generally, a king’s [summer] home is made with many entrances because of the air, and it was therefore called “a forest house” because it was like a forest.
<b>Were square as was the window.</b> [Targum] Yonoson translated, “square and covered the beams,” [i.e.,] the entrances were covered with thin boards, that were square as other entrances of houses, and they were not made with a curved arch similar to the entrances of a great hall.
<b>And each window faced [the other window].</b> And the front of one edge was installed facing the other edge. The top of the board was towards the top of the other board, three times for each beam, but I do not know how.

### passuk 6
<b>An entrance hall of columns.</b> He made an entrance before these columns as an entrance to the house. Its length was fifty <i>amohs</i> along the width of the house, which was fifty <i>amohs</i>, and thirty <i>amohs</i> its width before the extent of the length of the house, only that the longer measurement is always called the length and the shorter one is called the width.<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., “length” and “width” are relative to the structure being described. See Rashi 6:3 above.</i>
<b>There was [another] entrance hall above them.</b> He made a high entrance [around] the entire house.
<b>And columns and support beams upon them.</b> And on the cut beams of cedar which were on the lower columns he erected on (should read “additional”) columns and beams from column to column, the columns to connect boards from one to another, and the beams for the ceiling. “עב” is a beam [=מריש], as we learned, “And the עבים, these are the beams.”<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Bava Kamma 67a.</i>

### passuk 7
<b>And an entrance hall for the throne.</b> [Targum Yonoson rendered,] “And an entrance hall to set the throne of judgment to judge there, he made a vestibule [פרוסדא] for the house of judgment.”<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi who quotes Targum Yonoson, there were two areas set aside, one for the throne of judgment and another for the house of judgment. Alternatively, they are one and the same.—Radak.</i> פרוסדא<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">In Mishnayos Avos 4:21 “פרוזדור” is defined as “vestibule.”</i> is an expression meaning “vestibule.”
<b>He covered the floor with cedar.</b> The earthen floor was covered with cedar.
<b>From one side of the foundation.</b> [Targum] Yonoson rendered “from foundation to foundation,”<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">קרקע generally means “ground” or floor.”</i> from the base of this wall to the base of the other wall.

### passuk 8

<b>According to the dimensions of standard cut stones.</b> According to the measures of cut stone, [i.e.,] theyhad one [standard] size for cut stone [for buildings] in that country,

<b>From the foundation.</b> [ממסד is] an expression [meaning] foundation [=יסוד].
<b>The ceiling.</b> The highest beam, as in, “My right hand had spanned [טפחה] the heavens.”<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">Yehsayahu 48:13.</i>
<b>And from the outside.</b> On the outside, the entire length of the walls until the great court, were of these stones.

<b>Eighteen <i>amohs</i> was the height, etc.</b> And in Divrei Hayomim it states, “[their height was] thirty-five <i>amohs</i>.”<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 3:15. Radak further explains that the 35 <i>amohs</i> that is stated in Divrei Hayomim refers to the <i>length</i> of the column as it lays on the ground; once it is erected it is called <i>height.</i></i> He cast both as one, and the one <i>amoh</i> which was missing,<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, each column was actually 17.5 amohs</i>, and the 18 <i>amohs</i> stated here is an approximation.—Ralbag. Or, the additional <i>amoh</i> was a result of hammering the column. I say, that at the top of each column there was a one half <i>amoh</i> which was not similar to the work of the rest of the column, as it is further stated regarding this subject, “the top of the columns was designed like lilies.”<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote">Below v. 22.</i>
<b>And a line of twelve <i>amohs</i> was the circumference of the second [each] column.</b> This teaches [us] that it was four <i>amohs</i> by four <i>amohs</i> in diameter, because every circumference of three hand-breadths has a diameter of one hand-breadth. And its thickness was four fingers and it was hollow; thus is this explained at the end of the book of Yirmiyahu.<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 52:21.</i> And this is an abbreviated verse, he disclosed the length of one [column] and the length of the second [column] can be learned from it, and he disclosed the circumference of the second [column], and the first [column] can be learned from it. And Targum Yonoson, also, rendered, “and a strung line of twelve <i>amohs</i> did compass it, and so the other column.”

<b>Two crown shapes.</b> <i>Pomels</i>, in O. F.
<b>Cast.</b> <i>Tresjited</i>, in O.F.
<b>One crown was five <i>amohs</i> high.</b> And at the end of the book it states, “three <i>amohs</i>.” We learned in the Mishnah of “Forty-nine Measurements,” that the two lower <i>amohs</i> of the crowns were similar to the column because there were no designs in them, and the three upper [<i>amohs</i>] that extended beyond, were surrounded with designs, as it is stated, “branches designed like net [mesh] work,”<sup>26</sup><i class="footnote">Below v. 17.</i> by the likes of the branches of a palm tree they were surrounded But I say, that the two lower <i>amohs</i> were not counted at the end of the book [of Melachim] because they were similar to the column and the column were inserted into the crown. two <i>amohs</i>

### passuk 17
<b>Branches designed like net [mesh] work.</b> The nets which they had were similar to a type of head covering which is called <i>cofea</i> [in O.F.].
<b>Net [mesh] work.</b> They were encircled by forms of branches of a palm tree, as in, “and he walks upon a snare [שבכה],”<sup>27</sup><i class="footnote">Iyov 18:8.</i> and the branches were [designed] like chain work.
<b>Seven [of these] were for the one crown.</b> There were seven branches in each encircling design for each net [mesh] work.

<b>And two rows.</b> Of pomegranates and of copper; the pomegranates were inserted into the chain [work] which encircled the crowns, thus is this explained in Divrei Hayomim<sup>28</sup><i class="footnote">See II Divrei Hayomim 3:16.</i> and in the Mishnah of “Forty-Nine Measurements.”
<b>To cover the crowns that were on top of the pomegranates.</b> [The text of] this verse is in a disarranged order.<sup>29</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, the verse can be explained according to its literal translation. The crowns were on the columns and the pomegranates were on the crowns. There were also other crowns which were on the pomegranates.—Radak. Or, the pomegranates were located on the lower bowl of the crown and the word על means “near” rather than “on top of.”</i> [It means,] “the pomegranates should cover the crowns which were on the top.” And thus were the crowns made according to the order of the apparent meaning of the verses; each one was in the form of two bowls. The receptacle of the lower bowl was facing upward and it is called גולה [=a bowl], as it is stated about this subject, “וגולת הכותרות,”<sup>30</sup><i class="footnote">Below v. 41.</i> and [Targum] Yonoson rendered this, “and the bowls of the crowns.” The upper [bowl] was inverted on the lower one, its receptacle was [facing] downward, and it was called שבכה [=net or mesh] work, as it is stated regarding this subject, “[also] two net [mesh] works to cover the two bowls of the crowns.”<sup>31</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid.</i> The result being that it is wide in the place where it is connected, and it narrows going upward and it narrows going downward, and this is called “a stomach,” and thus [Targum] Yonoson rendered מעלות הבטן,<sup>32</sup><i class="footnote">Below v. 20.</i> “against the place of attachment.” And the height of these two bowls was four <i>amohs</i>,<sup>33</sup><i class="footnote">See below v. 19.</i> and this is what he stated, “in the entrance hall were made like lilies, four <i>amohs</i>.” These were decorated inside with flowers of lilies, in the same design of the decorations which were on the wall of the entrance halls; four <i>amohs</i> high, and the fifth <i>amoh</i> was a small crown above the big one.

<b>And two hundred pomegranates.</b> Pomegranates made in two rows around, strung together on a chain and encircling the net [mesh] work.
<b>On each crown.</b> This, too, is an abbreviated sentence, meaning, “On the one [crown], and likewise, on the second.”<sup>35</sup><i class="footnote">Each crown had a chain of 200 pomegranates encircling it.</i>

<b>The top of the columns was designed like lilies.</b> A half <i>amoh</i> at the top of each column each one’s wall was as thin as a lily, and for the rest of the column its thickness was four fingers [and it was] hollow.<sup>36</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, the lily work was not part of the pillar, but was attached to it after the pillar had been installed.—Metzudas Dovid.</i> Therefore, this <i>amoh</i> was not counted in [the description] of the pouring [of the copper] for the columns in Divrei Hayomim because it was not similar to the work [of the rest] of the columns.

### passuk 23
<b>Ten <i>amohs</i> from rim to rim.</b> Through the middle, because the diameter of every round object is through the middle.
<b>And a line of thirty <i>amohs</i> [the circumference].</b> This is what was mentioned, “All that have three handbreadth in its circumference have one handbreadth in its diameter.” Its circumference was thirty [<i>amohs</i>] and its diameter ten [<i>amohs</i>],<sup>37</sup><i class="footnote">The diameter of 10 <i>amohs</i> is a rounded off number.

The upper ones were square and the lower ones round, it is impossible to say for it is written, that its rim was “circular all around.”<sup>41</sup><i class="footnote">Above v. 23.</i> He, therefore, says regarding these knobs, “for ten <i>amohs</i> compassing the sea round about,” because in the place that it was square, [a perimeter of] forty <i>amohs</i> has ten <i>amohs</i> on each side, but in the place that it is round it is impossible to say it has ten <i>amohs</i> [on each side] around.

The [upper part of the sea was] two [<i>amohs</i> high and] round [with a diameter of ten <i>amohs</i> and contained sufficient water for] fifty ritual baths, because the square is greater than the circle by one quarter. [And in Divrei Hayomim] it is written, “it capacity was three thousand <i>bas</i>.”<sup>45</sup><i class="footnote">II Divrei Hayomim 4:5.</i> Our Rabbis explained it refers to a dry measure, since the overflow was one third of the capacity of the receptacle.<sup>46</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Eruvin 14b.

<b>And three <i>amohs</i> was its height.</b> The height of the base excluding the height of the wheel (meaning: excluding the base [=כן] itself; יד האופן is the wheel) upon which it rests was an <i>amoh</i> and a half, and the height of the base was an <i>amoh</i> and a half.

Therefore, they are referred to as “מסגרות” which means frames, as in Shemos 25:25, 27.</i>
<b>They had frames.</b> The frames were from the axle of one wheel to the axle of the other wheel. And the “יד אופן” is the wood which is inserted into the wheel, in the hole, and it is called <i>essieu</i>, in O.F. And the four wheels of the base had frames on this side and frames on the other side, on all four sides; between one and the other, was a width of four <i>amohs</i>, and above there were “blocks [=סרנים which means] the same as “boards” [=נסרים], against the frames, and the ledges were from the lower [frames] to the upper ones, and there were other frames between the ledges, like the design of the legs of the bed of villagers which are not round but protrude [in order] to decorate them with lions and cherubim. But I say, that these ledges were like the rungs of a ladder, sort of copper rods standing on the lower frames, there were two or three rods. The frames were set between one rod and the other, connected from one ledge to the other. [Targum] Yonoson, also, rendered “ledges.”

<b>Joined together.</b> לויות is form resembling a male and female embracing.
<b>Thin strips of metal.</b> Hammered, resembling the hammering of a thin metal plate. They did not protrude in its thickness nor were they engraved in a depression. And Yonoson rendered לויות מעשה מורד, “joined by welding,” <i>souldriz,</i> in O.F.

<b>At the side of each were thin metal strips joined together.</b> At the side of each of the shoulders was a joining of a decorated male and female. מעבר איש [=one to another] means the same as “איש אל אחיו [=one to another],”<sup>49</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 25:20.</i> which is stated by the cherubim.

And below this is thus explained regarding this subject, as it is stated, “At the top of the base [was a frame] half an <i>amoh</i> high circular all around,”<sup>50</sup><i class="footnote">Below v. 35.</i> and that is called “פי הכותרות [=the rim of the crown].” And the base rests on that enclosure, and the bottom of the base is inserted into the rim of the enclosure, and it protrudes one <i>amoh</i> above it. This is what is stated here, “And the rim of the vessel was inside the crown and rose above it an <i>amoh</i>.”
<b>The rim was round made like the base.</b> And the rim of the crown was round, a replica of the base which was round.

<b>[The king] cast them.</b> He melted them and poured them according to their form.
<b>In the thick clay.</b> [Targum Yonoson rendered,] “in the thickness of the clay.”<sup>63</sup><i class="footnote">The clay of the Jordan Plain was of very good quality.—Radak.</i>

<b>Shlomo gave up.</b> [He refrained] from determining the weight of these vessels because there were very many, and [therefore] he ceased to determine their weight.<sup>64</sup><i class="footnote">Targum renders וינח as “he hid [=ואצנע],” implying that Shlomo prepared more than was needed and put away the extra vessels for future use. II Divrei Hayomim 4:18 implies that Shlomo made more vessels than needed.</i>

<b>Five on the right and five on the left.</b> It is impossible to say five were on the right side of the entrance and five were on the left of the entrance, if so, we find a candlestick on the north [side] and the Torah states, “on the south side of the Tabernacle.”<sup>65</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 3:29. The verse quoted by Rashi describes the location where the Kehas family encamped. It is not stated in reference to the candlestick. See Shemos 26:35 and 40:24 for the location of the candlestick.</i> Therefore, Moshe’s [candlestick] was in the middle, five [candlesticks] on its right and five on its left.
<b>And the flowers.</b> Of the candlestick.
<b>The lamps.</b> The cups into which the oil and wicks are put.
<b>And the tongs.</b> With which the wick is lifted out of the oil.

<b>The Sippos.</b> A type of musical instrument,<sup>66</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, ספות are pitchers.—Metzudas Tzion. </i> and similarly, “מזמרות.”
<b>The basins.</b> To receive the blood.
<b>The spoons.</b> As vessels for frankincense.
<b>And the fire pans.</b> To remove the ashes and coals, and to carry them from the outer altar to the inner altar to burn incense.
<b>The keys.</b> Keys, I heard, with which to open [מפתחין] with them the locks.
<b>For the doors of the [inner] Beis Hamikdosh.</b> Which is the Holy of Holies.
<b>For the doors of the Beis Hamikdosh.</b> Which is for the Sanctuary, all of their entrances were of gold.

### passuk 51
<b>The sacred of his father Dovid.</b> That which remained of the silver and gold dedicated by his father. But the Midrash explains that Shlomo did not wish to use any of those dedicated materials for the construction of the Beis [Hamikdosh]. And I heard from [Torah] scholars of Yisroel who said, because Dovid knew eventually it would be destroyed; so that the idol worshiping [nations] should not say that their idols are mightier for they took their revenge upon the Beis [Hamikdosh] which was built of the plunder and destruction which Dovid plundered from them. And others say, Shlomo said that there was a famine in the days of his father for three consecutive years, and he should have squandered these dedicated materials to sustain Yisroel’s poor.
