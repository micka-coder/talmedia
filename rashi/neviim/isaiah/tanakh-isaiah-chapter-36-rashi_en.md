### passuk 5
<b>I said</b> (until now), “It is but words of the lips, that he speaks (lit., in his mouth), saying, ‘I will not serve the king of Assyria.’ And when he sees that I will march against him with an army, he will recant. Now I have marched. From now on, either he will serve me, or he will need to seek counsel and might for war.”
<b>Now</b> that the time has come, tell me now on whom you have depended to rebel against me.

### passuk 6
<b>upon which a man will lean</b> On the splintered and broken reed, and the scaly envelopes enter his palm and puncture it, so is Pharaoh to those who trust him. Eventually, their aid will be to their detriment.

<b>is it [with] other than the Lord</b> Without His permission?
<b>The Lord said to me</b> The prophets have already prophesied (supra 8:4): “The wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria shall be carried off before the king of Assyria.” But he erred, saying (supra 10:11), “Indeed, as I did to Samaria..., so will I do to Jerusalem...”

### passuk 11
<b>for we understand it</b> (שֹׁמְעִים, lit. hear.) We understand that language, an expression of hearing (entendenc in O.F.).
<b>do not speak with us in Judean</b> for all the people understand the Judean language, and they are frightened by your words. (Since he said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah,” they thought that he did not come to frighten the people. Since Rabshakeh was an apostate Jew, they thought that even though his master’s orders were incumbent upon Rabshakeh to observe, his heart was attracted to his family and he would take pity upon them.)

### passuk 12
<b>Did...to your master</b> (הַאֶל) This is the interrogative form. It is therefore vowelized with a ‘hataf pattah’ (not so in our editions). Did my master send me to you two alone? Indeed, he sent me to all of them, and for that reason I have come, so that all the people hear and see, and let not Hezekiah persuade them to rebel.
<b>to eat their dung</b> They too (sic) would eat in the hunger of the siege.
<b>their dung</b> The kethib reads חֹרָאֵיהֶם, the dung that is excreted through their orifice. Our Sages instituted to euphemize and read it צוֹאָתָם, i.e., their dung. Thus did our Rabbis teach: Verses written in uncomplimentary words are to be read in a complimentary manner, e.g., (Deut. 28:27) עֲפֹלִים (is read) טְחֹרִים. (Both mean hemorrhoids. The former means ‘that which is in the dark holes,’ being more explicit than the latter. (ibid. v. 30) יִשְׁגָּלֶנָּה (is to be read) יִשְׁכָּבֶנָּה. (Both denoting intimacy, the former related as well to a dog.) חֹרָאֵיהֶם (is to be read) צוֹאָתָם, שִׁינֵיהֶם (is to be read) מֵימֵי רַגְלֵיהֶם.
<b>their urine</b> The kethib is שִׁינֵיהֶם, loose excrement. The teeth of the large intestine. That is the intestine called tabahie in O.F. that stands on three teeth, (i.e. the glands of the rectum, which is held by three glands. They are called שִׁנַּיִּם because they are shaped like teeth).

<b>Make peace with me</b> (בְרָכָה, lit., a blessing.) Come out to me for peace and greet me and bring me a gift of peace.
בְּרָכָה is saloud in O.F., salutation. Comp. (Gen. 47:10) “And Jacob greeted Pharaoh.”
<b>and each man will eat of his vine</b> And I will leave you, and dwell in peace until I find a land as good as your land, and I will exile you there, for so is my wont, to transfer nations from land to land, as it is said (supra 10:13): “And I remove the boundaries of the peoples.”

### passuk 17
<b>to a land like your land</b> Said Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai: Was this one (Sennacherib) a fool? This is an example of a king, etc. in Sifre, parshath Ekev (Deut. 7:12). He should have said, “to a land better than your land,” but he could not denigrate it.
