### passuk 1
<b>shall rejoice over them</b> (יְשֻׂשׂוּם) This is usually the sign of the direct object, inappropriate here in the case of an intransitive verb. (like יָשׂוּשׂוּ מֵהֶם, shall rejoice from them). Comp. (Jer. 10:20) “My sons have gone away from me (יְצָאֻנִי).” Also, (I Kings 19:21) “He cooked the meat for them (בִּשְּׁלָם),” equivalent to בִּשֵּׁל לָהֶם, “He cooked the meat for them.”
<b>Desert and wasteland</b> Jerusalem, called ‘wasteland,’ and Zion, called ‘desert,’ they shall rejoice over the downfall of the mighty of the heathens and Persia ([Manuscripts yield:] of Edom and Bozrah). ([The Warsaw edition reads:] the mighty of Seir (and Bozrah).)
<b>and the plain shall rejoice</b> the plain of Jerusalem.

### passuk 3
<b>Strengthen weak hands</b> (חַזְּקוּ) All the prophets who brought tidings of salvation consoled Israel and strengthened their weak hands. (The word) is in the intensive conjugation, and its meaning is (the causative, i.e.,) strengthen others. If he intended to say, “Be strong, you whose hands are weak,” it would be vowelized like (2 Chron. 32:7) “Be strong (חִזְקוּ) and be firm (וְאִמְצוּ).” Now that he says to them to strengthen others and to make others firm, it is vowelized, חַזְּקוּ, אַמְּצוּ. “Be strong (חִזְקוּ), do not fear” is vowelized חִזְקוּ, a form of the ‘kal’ conjugation, meaning ‘you be strong by yourselves,’ as one says to singular (Jos. 1:6), “Be strong and be firm (חֲזַק ֶמָץ),” and he does not say, חַזֵּק.

### passuk 5
<b>the eyes of the blind shall be opened</b> Those who were blind, not to recognize (lit., from recognizing) their fear (sic) ([Warsaw:] this fear;) ([mss.] My fear) upon them.
<b>and the ears of the deaf</b> Who did not hearken to the voice of the prophets until now, will be opened and unstopped, for I will give them a proper spirit to fear Me. He says this concerning Israel, whom he called blind and deaf, as the matter is stated (infra 42:18) “You deaf ones, hearken, etc.”

### passuk 6
<b>Then the lame shall skip like a hart, etc.</b> Israel, who are now lame and weak. We find that he calls the weak with an expression of ‘lame,’ as the matter is stated (above 33:23): “The lame take the prey.”
<b>shall sing</b> in My salvation.
<b>the tongue of the mute</b> The tongue of Israel, who are among the nations as mutes, for they hear their scorn and do not respond.
<b>for water has broken out in the desert</b> For My salvation shall cheer them up, and they shall blossom like a desert wasteland, which thirsts for water, and springs break out into it; i.e., for salvation shall sprout for the crushed ones.

### passuk 7
<b>And the dry place shall become a pool</b> He who longs for salvation shall be saved. The prophet spoke figuratively.
<b>in the habitat of jackals, a resting place, etc.</b> A place that was a desert wasteland, which is the habitat, the resting place of jackals, shall become moist, a place of grass, made for reeds and rushes, and it is not customary for reeds and rushes to grow except in a watery place, as the matter is stated (Job 8:11): “Can the rush shoot upwards without mire?”
<b>a resting place</b> (רִבְצָה) This is a noun like מַרְבֵּץ, since it has no ‘mappiq hey.’

### passuk 8
<b>And there shall be a highway</b> for the travelers.
<b>no unclean one shall traverse it</b> No unclean one shall traverse that road; i.e., it will no longer belong to the heathens ([mss.:] nations).

<b>a profligate beast</b> The boar out of the forest (80:14). There is none as profligate among the beasts as the boar, and also “the lions from his thicket” (Jer. 4:7), i.e., Nebuchadnezzar, shall not be found there.
<b>nor shall...ascend thereon</b> On that road (הַדֶּרֶךְ). The word דֶּרֶךְ is used both as masculine and feminine gender, as it is written (Ex. 18:20): “The way (הַדֶּרֶךְ) upon which (בָּהּ) they shall walk.” (Lit., on her.) Thus it is feminine. Comp. (Deut. 28:7) “In one road (בַּדֶּרֶךְ אֶחָד) they shall come out to you.” Thus it is masculine.
<b>it shall not be found</b> any wild beast there.

### passuk 10
