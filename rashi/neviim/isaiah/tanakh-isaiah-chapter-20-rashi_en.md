<b>and you shall gird sackcloth over your loins</b> (וּפִתַּחְתָּ) Jonathan renders: “And you shall gird the sackcloth over your loins.” And his interpretation is evidenced by the fact that until now, He had not commanded him to gird himself with sackcloth, that He should tell him to remove it. Moreover, when He tells him, “And you shall remove your shoes from upon your feet,” this is a sign of mourning. (It is, therefore, likely that He commanded him to gird himself with sackcloth, also a sign of mourning.) And the meaning of וּפִתַּחְתָּ is like: (Exodus 39:6) “Engraved like the engravings of a seal (מְפֻתָּחוֹת פִּתּוּחֵי חוֹתָם),” to gird himself with sackcloth tightly on his flesh, so that it appears to be engraved in his flesh.
<b>over your loins</b> above your loins.
<b>naked</b> (עָרוֹם). Jonathan renders: פְּחֵיחַ, with torn and worn out clothing, but not actually naked.

<b>three years</b> shall he go in this manner as a sign and a symbol for Egypt and for Cush, that, at the end of three years the king of Assyria shall lead the captivity of Egypt... We learn that Tartan conquered Ashdod three years prior to the downfall of Sennacherib, for his downfall was when he brought the captives of Egypt and Tirhakah the king of Cush before Jerusalem in chains, when he came to besiege Hezekiah.

<b>with bare buttocks</b> (וַחֲשׂוּפַי), like חֲשׂוּף, and the yud is superfluous, like the yud of חַלּוֹנָי (the window), חוֹרָי, (nets), שָׂדָי (the field).
<b>buttocks</b> Near the anus. Comp. (II Sam. 10:4): “And he cut off their garments in half, up to their buttocks (שְׁתוֹתֵיהֶם).” This retribution was due them because of Ham their ancestor, who saw his father’s nakedness and did not cover it, payment in kind.
