Comp. (I Sam. 18:14) “And David was successful (מַשְׂכִּיל) in all his ways.”

<b>and his generation</b> The years that passed over him.
<b>who shall tell?</b> The tribulations that befell him, for from the beginning, he was cut off and exiled from the land of the living that is the land of Israel for because of the transgression of my people, this plague came to the righteous among them.

<b>to the wicked</b> According to the will of the wicked, he was willing to be buried, and he would not deny the living God.
<b>and to the wealthy with his kinds of death</b> and to the will of the ruler he subjected himself to all kinds of death that he decreed upon him, because he did not wish to agree to (denial) [of the Torah] to commit evil and to rob like all the heathens (nations [mss., K’li Paz]) among whom he lived.

<b>If his soul makes itself restitution, etc.</b> Said the Holy One, blessed be He, “I will see, if his soul will be given and delivered with My holiness to return it to Me as restitution for all that he betrayed Me, I will pay him his recompense, and he will see children, etc.” This word אָשָׁם is an expression of ransom that one gives to the one against when he sinned, amende in O.F., to free from faults, similar to the matter mentioned in the episode of the Philistines (I Sam. 6:3), “Do not send it away empty, but you shall send back with it a guilt offering (אָשָׁם).”
