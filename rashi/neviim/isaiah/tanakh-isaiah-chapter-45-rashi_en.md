### passuk 1
<b>to His anointed one</b> Every title of greatness is called anointing. Comp. (Num. 18:8) “To you I have given them for greatness (לְמָשְׁחָה).” Our Sages, however, said: To the King Messiah, the Holy One, blessed be He, says, “I complain to you about Cyrus,” as it is stated in Tractate Megillah 12a.
<b>to flatten nations before him</b> Heb. לְרַד, to spread out and to flatten nations before him. לְרַד is equivalent to לְרַדֵּד, to spread out.
<b>and the loins of kings I will loosen</b> This is an expression of weakness and breaking strength, for girding the loins constitutes arming with strength. Comp. (Job 38:3) “Gird up your loins like a mighty man”; (Jer. 1:17) “And you gird up your loins”; (Job 12:21) “And the belt of the mighty He loosens”; an expression of breaking strength.
<b>to open...before him</b> the portals of the gates of Babylon. Gates are the space of the opening of the gate; portals are those with which they open and lock the gate.

### passuk 2
<b>and I will straighten out crooked paths</b> Heb. וַהֲדוּרִים אֲיַשֵּׁר. Jonathan renders: I will level the walls. Comp. (Shab. 77b) “the surrounding area (הדר הדרנא),” since the wall surrounds the city. The word may also be explained as: I will straighten out crooked paths before him.

### passuk 3
<b>Who calls [you] by your name</b> You are not yet born, and I call you by the name Cyrus.

### passuk 4
<b>For the sake of My servant Jacob</b> that you take him out of Babylonian exile.
<b>yet you have not known Me</b> You did not do My will, for I said, (infra v. 13) “He shall build My city,” but he when he assumed the throne said, “Whoever among you is from all His people, may ascend.” He gave them permission to go, but he cast off all the trouble from upon his neck.

### passuk 5

### passuk 6

### passuk 7
<b>Who forms light</b> for the righteous.
<b>and creates darkness</b> for Babylon, and the same applies to “Who makes peace and creates evil.”

### passuk 8
<b>Cause the heavens to drip</b> Righteousness, mentioned in the verse, is the object of the dripping and the pouring. Make the heavens drip righteousness and the skies shall pour righteousness, i.e., from Me shall come the righteousness to benefit them from the heavens.
<b>created it</b> I created this thing.

### passuk 9
<b>Woe to him who contends with his Creator</b> Isaiah prophesied concerning Habakkuk, who was destined to stand and complain about the length of Nebuchadnezzar’s success (1:2): “How long, O Lord, have I entreated [You]?...” (v. 14) “And [why] have You made man like the fish of the sea?” And the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Isaiah, Why does this one come to contend with Me? Does he think that I do not give thought to save My people? When the time lapses, “that the land will appease its sabbaths” (Lev. 26:34).
<b>has no place</b> [lit. has no hands,] has no place.

### passuk 10
<b>Woe to him who says to a father, “What do you beget?”</b> He thinks that he has more pity on the son than his father. Another explanation is: Woe is the son who says to his father, “Why have you begotten?” He is analogous to the one who contends with his Creator.

### passuk 11
<b>Ask Me about the signs etc.</b> Heb. הָאוֹתִיוֹת. The ‘heh’ is voweled with a ‘kamatz.’ This indicates that it is not the interrogative, but this is its explanation: If you have come to ask Me, you and the prophets, ask Me about the signs of the heavens and the wonders that you see coming about on the earth; about them you may ask Me, what they are, but about My children and about the work of My hands, Israel, for whose sake I formed everything, shall you come to command Me and to complain before Me?
<b>do you command Me?</b> This is the interrogative. Must you command Me concerning My children? I have already created the salvation for them in the thought that has entered My mind [lit. has come before Me]. How so? I aroused him with righteousness. This is stated regarding Cyrus.

### passuk 12
<b>I made the earth</b> and gave it to whoever pleased Me [lit. was straight in My eyes].

### passuk 13

### passuk 14
<b>The toil of Egypt etc.</b> I have informed how I will save My children from the hand of Babylon, for I have aroused Cyrus for that purpose with My righteousness. I further inform you of the salvation from Sennacherib that will take place in the days of Hezekiah. When he returns (supra 36:36) from marching upon Tirhaka, king of Cush, he will return to Jerusalem with all the valuable treasures of Cush, and Egypt, who will go to aid Cush, in his possession, and he will come with those spoils and fall in Jerusalem, and Hezekiah and his people will plunder everything. So is it delineated in Seder Olam (ch. 23) that it is stated concerning Sennacherib.
<b>men of stature</b> Tall people.
<b>over to you</b> Jerusalem.
<b>they shall come over in chains</b> For Sennacherib brought them there, with neck-irons fastened to them, and after his defeat, Hezekiah stood and released all those captives, who became converted to Judaism and recognized the kingdom of Heaven.
<b>Only in you is God</b> They will acknowledge that there is no God but the Lord alone. ([Mss. and K’li Paz read:] but to Israel.)

### passuk 15
<b>Indeed, You are a God Who conceals Himself</b> And so they shall say to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Indeed, You have given us to understand (we understand [Mss. and K’li Paz]) that to collect the debts of Your people, You conceal yourself from showing Your victory. So to speak, You have not the ability, and when Your mercy is aroused, You are the God of Israel, the Savior.” So it is explained in Mechilta (Ex. 14:4).

### passuk 16
<b>master painters</b> Heb. חָרָשֵׁי צִירִים, the master painters of the idols, from among the pagans.

### passuk 17

### passuk 18
<b>He did not create it for a waste</b> but He formed it to be inhabited.

### passuk 19
<b>Not in secret did I speak</b> When I gave the Torah, and I did not say for naught and in vain to the seed of Jacob, Seek Me, but to receive great reward.
<b>I am the Lord Who speaks righteousness</b> Since I commenced to speak to them concerning My righteousness, to inform them of the giving of their reward, afterwards I told them things that are right, My statutes and My laws, for before the giving of the Torah it was said to them, “And now, if you heed, etc., you shall be for Me a treasure...a kingdom of priests, etc.” (Ex. 19:5f.).

### passuk 20
<b>approach</b> Heb. הִתְנַגְּשׁוּ, an expression of approaching (הַגָּשָׁה) and the ‘nun’ is attached to it, as one says “they were struck (הִתְנַגְּפוּ)”; “they will be struck (יִתְנַגְּפוּ).”
<b>you survivors of the nations</b> who survived the sword of Nebuchadnezzar.
<b>who carry their graven wooden image...do not know</b> to understand knowledge.

### passuk 21
<b>who announced this from before</b> Who of your idols is it that announced from before that your God brought salvation, each one to its worshipers?
<b>Is it not I, the Lord, and there are no other</b> For I announce what I am destined to do for My people, and I fulfill My words.

### passuk 22
<b>Turn to Me</b> and abandon your graven images, all the ends of the earth, and, thereby, you shall be saved.

### passuk 23
<b>By Myself I swore</b> and righteousness emanated from My mouth to accept all those who return to Me. I spoke a word, and it will not be retracted. What is the righteousness that emanated from My mouth? That to Me shall every knee kneel, and I will accept them, as the matter is stated (Zeph. 3: 9): “For then will I change for the people a pure language, to call all of them in the name of the Lord...”

### passuk 24
<b>But to me did He say by the Lord</b> Heb. אַךְ בַה' לִי אָמַר [lit. but by the Lord to me He said]. This verse is inverted, and thus is its interpretation: But to me did He say by the Lord righteousness and strength. Although all the nations shall prostrate themselves before Him [correct reading according to Warsaw edition, K’li Paz, and mss.], but to me alone, the congregation of Israel, has been promised by the Lord righteousness and strength, and other nations shall not be included in my glory.
<b>to Him shall come and be ashamed etc.</b> All who were incensed against the Holy One, blessed be He, shall come to Him to regret what they did in their lifetimes and be ashamed.
<b>all who are incensed</b> Heb. כֹּל הַנֶּחֱרִים בּוֹ, all who are incensed.

### passuk 25
<b>Through the Lord...find righteousness and boast</b> Through the promise of the support of His love they shall find righteousness and boast of His strength.
<b>boast</b> Heb. וְיִתְהַלְלוּ, porvantir in O.F.
