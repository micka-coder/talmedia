<b>And Adonoy provided Yisroel with a savior.</b> Yoash son of Yehoachaz, concerning whom it is stated, “You will strike [and defeat] Arom [only] three times.”<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Below, v. 19.</i>

<b>In the thirty-seventh year, etc.</b> This verse is contradicted from two sides, and I have not found a reconciliation, for it should have said, “thirty-ninth [year],” because his father ascended [to the throne] in the twenty-third year of Yoash[’s reign], and reigned seventeen years, consequently, he died in the thirty-ninth year of Yoash[’s reign]. Also, it is stated below in this section, “In the second year of Yoash son of Y[eh]oachaz, king of Yisroel, Amatzyoh, son of Yoash became king.”<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Below 14:1.</i>—the king of Yehudah—Consequently, Yoash son of Yehoachaz, ascended [to the throne] in the fortieth year of Yoash, which was his last year, and in the second year of Yoash son of Yehoachaz, Amatzyoh became king. And even if you say that Amatzyoh became king in the year of his father’s death, and Scripture calls this the second year of Yoash[’s reign], [nonetheless,] you can deduce that Yoash the king of Yisroel did not become king until the thirty-ninth year of Yoash the king of Yehudah.

<b> And Yorovom sat on his throne.</b> He was his [Yoash’s] son. There is reason to wonder why these two verses were written here, for [Scripture] continues and tells about events of Yoash, and then repeats, “The rest of Yoash’s deeds, etc.,<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Below 14:15.</i> and Yehoash slept with his forefathers, etc.,”<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. v. 16.</i> I therefore say that they [i.e., these two verses] were written [here] for the sole purpose of causing a break, so as not to juxtapose Elisha’s death with a verse [dealing] with idolatry,<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Alternatively, the verses are inserted here to indicate that Yorovom was placed on the throne by his father during his lifetime, and he ruled for two years.—Radak</i> by saying, “He did what was evil, etc.,<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">v. 11.</i> and Elisha became sick.”<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">v. 14.</i>

<b>“Open the window towards the east.”</b> Opposite the land of Arom which is located in the east, as it is stated, “Arom from the east.”<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayahu 9:11.</i>
<b>“Shoot!” And he shot.</b> [Targum Yonoson renders] “Shoot!” And he shot.
<b>And he said, “An arrow of salvation, etc.”</b> Elisha said, “This arrow is a symbol of salvation for Yisroel.”
<b>In Apheik.</b> The name of the city [is Apheik].<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Yisroel had been defeated earlier by Arom. See I Melochim 20:26-30.</i>

<b> And [he] said, “[If only] you had struck [the arrows at the ground] five or six times.</b> [I.e.,] you should have.
<b>Then.</b> Had you done so, you would have struck Arom five or six times, for as a symbol of victory, I placed your hands on the bow.

<b>Would invade the land.</b> It was common for them to come and plunder the land.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">After Elisha’s death.—Radak For as long as he was alive no Aramean dared to invade as indicated in II Melochim 6:23.</i>
<b>At the beginning of each year.</b> [Targum Yonoson renders,] “at the beginning of the year,”<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">I.e., בָּא שָׁנָה means “when the year [= שָׁנָה] enters [=בָּא].” However, שָׁנָה is feminine and בא is masculine. This difficulty can be resolved by substituting בָּא with בָּהּ, meaning “in that very year,” i.e., the year that Elisha died.—Radak. Or, בָּא שָׁנָה means, “when he [Elisha] had come [to his resting place] for a year.—Ralbag </i> [i.e.,] at the return of the year, when the ground is still full of vegetation, and there is food for their animals, it is customary for troops to set out [for war].
