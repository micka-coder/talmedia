<b>By way of the gate between the two walls.</b> A cave went from his house until the Plains of Yericho, and he fled through the cave. The Holy One, Blessed Is He, ordained a deer walking on the roof of the cave. and the Kasdim pursued the deer, and when they reached the cave's entrance in the Plains of Yericho, they saw him and captured him. This is what [Scripture] states, ”And I will spread My net over him, and he shall be caught in My snare.”<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkeil 12:13.</i>

<b>And called him to account.</b> He debated with him concerning the oath.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Tzidkiyohu violated his oath of allegiance to Nevuchadnetzar.—Radak</i> <sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">The Gemara in Maseches Nedarim 65a states that Tzidkiyohu had discovered Nevuchadnetzar eating a live, or according to other opinions, an uncooked rabbit. He had him swear that he would never reveal what he had seen. However, Tzidkiyohu had his oath nullified and revealed Nevuchadnetzar's uncivilized behavior. When Nevuchadnetzar found out that people were making fun of him, he realized that Tzidkiyohu had broken his promise.</i>

<b>The height of the crown was three <i>amohs</i>.</b> And in the beginning of the Book [of Melochim] it states, ”five <i>amohs</i> [high].”<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Melochim 7:16.</i> I reconciled the verses there.<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi reconciled the difference as follows: The crown was actually five <i>amohs</i> high but its two lower <i>amohs</i> are not counted because the column was inserted into the crown two <i>amohs</i> deep and it served as a base for the crown.</i>

<b>Evil Merodach … elevated.</b> For Nevuchadnetzar died, and Evil Merodach reigned in his place.
<b>On the twenty-seventh day of the month.</b> But in Yirmiyohu it states, “On the twenty-fifth.”<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Yirmiyahu 52:31.</i> Rather, on the twenty-fifth Nevuchadnetzar died and he was buried on the twenty-sixth. On the twenty-seventh, Evil Merodach removed him from his grave and dragged him about,<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">Evil Merodach was afraid that his father was not really dead and would return to claim his throne. This happened before when Nevuchadnetzar became insane. He left his throne and lived as a wild beast for seven years. See Daniel 4:29-34. In the interim one of his sons was appointed in his place. When Nevuchadnetzar came back he imprisoned his son. Evil Merodach wanted to make sure that would not happen again, and he therefore had Nevuchadnetzar's body removed from his grave and dragged along the ground, thus fulfilling Yeshayohu's prophecy.—Radak</i> in order to nullify his decrees, as it is stated in Yeshayohu, ”and you have been cast out of your grave like a despised sapling, etc.”<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Yeshayohu 14:19.</i>
