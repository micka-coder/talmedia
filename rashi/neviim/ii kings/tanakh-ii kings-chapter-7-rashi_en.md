<b>Upon whose hand he leaned.</b> On the day before, when he came to Elisha’s house.<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">See above v. 2. Initially he scoffed at Elisha’s prophecy. The king assigned him to stand guard at the gate to prevent looting of the camp. This would have kept the price of grain higher than predicted by the prophet. However, he was trampled by the people at the gate and he died, to fulfill the prophecy of Elisha.—Malbim </i>
