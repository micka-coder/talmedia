<b>And you, Bethlehem Ephrathah</b>—whence David emanated, as it is stated (<a class="refLink" href="/I_Samuel.17.58" data-ref="I Samuel 17:58">I Sam. 17:58</a>): “The son of your bondsman, Jesse the Bethlehemite.” And Bethlehem is called Ephrath, as it is said (<a class="refLink" href="/Genesis.48.7" data-ref="Genesis 48:7">Gen. 48: 7</a>): “On the road to Ephrath, that is Bethlehem.” 
<b>you should have been the lowest of the clans of Judah</b>—You should have been the lowest of the clans of Judah because of the stigma of Ruth the Moabitess in you.

### passuk 2
<b>Therefore, He shall deliver them until the time a woman in confinement gives birth</b>—He shall deliver them into the hands of their enemies until the coming of the time that Zion has felt the pangs of labor and borne her children; Zion, which is now seized by the pangs of labor, is now called a woman in confinement. [I.e., now the labor pains will cease and the redempyion will come about.] But our Sages state that from here we deduce that the son of David will not come until the wicked kingdom spreads over the entire world for nine months (<i>Yoma</i> 10b, <i>Sanh.</i> 98b). But, according to its simple meaning, this is the structure as I explained. 
<b>and the rest of his brothers</b>—The brothers of the King Messiah; i.e., the rest of the tribe [of Judah].

### passuk 5
<b>And they shall break the land of Assyria</b> Heb. יְרָעוּ. And they shall break, similar to (<a class="refLink" href="/Psalms.2.9" data-ref="Psalms 2:9">Ps. 2:9</a>) “You shall break them (תְּרֹעֵם) with an iron rod.”
