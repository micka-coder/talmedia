### passuk 4
<b>like wax</b> Heb. כַּדּוֹנַג. In mishnaic Hebrew, this is שַּׁעֲוָה 
<b>as water poured down a steep place</b> Heb. מֻגָּרִים. <i>Jonathan</i> renders: poured down a steep place. מְגֻרִים is an expression of the running of water. Cf. (<a class="refLink" href="/Lamentations.3.49" data-ref="Lamentations 3:49">Lam. 3:49</a>) “My eye trickles down (נִגְרָה)”; (<a class="refLink" href="/Job.20.28" data-ref="Job 20:28">Job 20:28</a>) “Shall flow away (נִגָרוֹת) on the day of His wrath”; (ibid. 28:4) “He breaks open a water course from the place it flows (גָּר)”; (<a class="refLink" href="/Psalms.75.9" data-ref="Psalms 75:9">Ps. 75:9</a>) “And He pours out (וַיַגֵּר) of this.” 

### passuk 6
<b>into a heap in the field</b> Heb. לְעִי הַשָּׂדֶה. <i>Jonathan</i> renders: לִדְגוֹרִין דְּחַקְלָא, an expression of heaps. Cf. (<a class="refLink" href="/Genesis.31.47" data-ref="Genesis 31:47">Gen. 31:47</a>) “יְגַר שַׂהֲדוּתָא, the heap of the testimony.” 
<b>and I will cast its stones down into the valley</b> Heb. וְהִגַּרְתִּי, and I will drag, similar to (verse 4) “poured down (מֻגָּרִים) a steep place.” 

### passuk 7
<b>for from the hire of a harlot it gathered</b>—all these riches. 
<b>and to the hire of a harlot shall they return</b>—And all its [Samaria’s] gatherings will be used up like other harlots’ hires. <i>Jonathan</i> renders: And to the house of the idol worshippers shall all its gatherings be delivered. 

### passuk 8
<b>I will go mad</b> Heb. שׁוֹלָל, becoming mad like a mentally deranged person, with bewilderment. Cf. (<a class="refLink" href="/Psalms.76.6" data-ref="Psalms 76:6">Ps. 76:6</a>) “The stout-hearted have become mad (אֱשְׁתּוֹלְלוּ)”; (<a class="refLink" href="/Isaiah.59.15" data-ref="Isaiah 59:15">Isa. 59:15</a>) “And he who turns away from evil is considered mad (מִשְׁתּוֹלֵל).” The ‘tav’ comes into the word to serve in the reflexive present and past. This is the normal pattern of a word whose first radical letter is ‘shin’ or ‘sammech’ when a ‘tav’ is added in the reflexive, either present or past, as in מִשְׁתּוֹלֵל. I say that it is an expression of error, as in (<a class="refLink" href="/II_Kings.4.28" data-ref="II Kings 4:28">II Kings 4:28</a>) “Do not mislead (תַשְׁלֶה) me”; (<a class="refLink" href="/II_Samuel.6.7" data-ref="II Samuel 6:7">II Sam. 6:7</a>) “For his error (הַשַּׁל) ;” (<a class="refLink" href="/Daniel.3.29" data-ref="Daniel 3:29">Dan. 3: 29</a>) “who speaks anything amiss (שָׁלוּ).” 

### passuk 9
<b>For she is mortally ill [from] her wounds</b> Heb. אֱנוּשָׁה. For she is ill from her wounds. Cf. (<a class="refLink" href="/II_Samuel.12.15" data-ref="II Samuel 12:15">II Sam. 12:15</a>) “And it became mortally ill (וַיֵּאָנַשׁ.).” 

### passuk 10
<b>Do not declare it in Gath</b>—lest the Philistines rejoice about us. 
<b>in the houses of Aphrah</b>—This is Ophrah of the Abiezrites (<a class="refLink" href="/Judges.6.11" data-ref="Judges 6:11">Jud. 6:11</a>). 
<b>wallow in the dust</b> Heb. הִתְפַּלָּשִׁי, a play on words with the name Philistia (פְּלֶשֶת). Similarly, (verse 11) “You inhabitant of Shafir, with your private parts exposed.” Similarly, (verse 11) “The inhabitant of Zanaan has not gone forth.” In all of these, the language of the lamentation is according to the name of the city. <b>wallow</b> Heb. הִתְפַּלָּשִׁי, roll. According to the context, cover yourself with dust. 

### passuk 11
<b>Pass along your way</b> Heb. עִבְרִי לָכֶם. He commences with an expression in the feminine singular, as used in addressing the people of the city, as it is said: “the inhabitant of Shafir” addressing them all in the name of one people. And then he says, “לָכֶם, along your way” as used in addressing many people, for he was speaking to the public. 
<b>the inhabitant of Shafir</b>—Shafir is the name of the city. 
<b>with your private parts exposed</b>—Private parts would be exposed, appropriate to a city called “Shafir,” the name of the aborted fetus that comes out of the woman’s womb. 
<b>the inhabitants of Zaanan did not go forth</b>—The fugitives of the inhabitants of Zaanan shall not go forth. -[from <i>Jonathan</i>] 
<b>the lamentation caused by drawing the houses one to the other shall take its stand from you</b>—The lamentation you caused those who were robbed, whom you robbed of their inheritance in order to draw one house to the other, one field to the other, will take its stand from you - the stand of the houses that you built and erected on their inheritance. <b>by drawing the houses from one the other</b> ajoustement in Old French [which means, adding or joining]. 

### passuk 12
<b>For the one dwelling in disobedience hoped for good</b>—For the one dwelling in tranquility and disobeying the word of the prophets hoped for good. 
<b>but evil descended</b> Heb. כִּי. This instance of כִּי serves as an expression of “but.” She hoped for good, but, because of her disobedience, evil descended to her. 

### passuk 13
<b>Hitch the chariot to the swift steeds</b> Heb. רְתֹם הַמֶּרְכָּבָה לַרֶכֶשׁ. Hitch the chariot to the רֶכֶשׁ, which is swift to run, and you shall escape. The word רֶכֶשׁ is explained by Dunash (<i>Teshuvoth Dunash</i> p. 69) as an Arabic word. 

### passuk 14
<b>Since you give expulsions to the dynasty that gave you the possession of Gath</b>—Since you give expulsions to the kingdom of David, which gave you the possession of Gath, as the matter is stated (<a class="refLink" href="/I_Chronicles.18.1" data-ref="I Chronicles 18:1">I Chron. 18:1</a>): “And he took Gath and its cities out of the hands of the Philistines.” But you reject it, as it is stated (<a class="refLink" href="/Isaiah.8.6" data-ref="Isaiah 8:6">Isa. 8:6</a>): “Since this people has rejected the waters of the Shiloah that flow gently, etc.” Therefore, “the houses of Achzib” which was of the land of Judah and was drawn after Pekah the son of Remaliah, shall ultimately be a “dried up spring” to the kings of Israel - for Pekah the son of Remaliah will be assassinated, and all those who relied on him will be disappointed. This prophecy was prophesied during Ahaz’s reign. 
<b>since you give expulsions</b> Heb. לָכֵן. The definition of לָכֵן is עַ ל אֲשֶׁר, because of. Cf. (<a class="refLink" href="/Isaiah.17.10" data-ref="Isaiah 17:10">Isa. 17:10</a>) “Because (עַל כֵּן) I planted you with pleasant saplings,” and you turned into a branch of a stranger. 
<b>the houses of Achzib shall be a dried up spring</b> Heb. לְאַכְזָב. This [too] is a play on words לְאַכְזָבת אַכְזִיב. I learned the midrash of this verse from the Aggadah of the chapter “<i>Chelek</i>.” [from <i>Sanh.</i> 102a] 

### passuk 15
<b>I will yet bring the possessor to you</b>—The enemies, who will possess you, you who dwell in Mareshah. The possessor (הַיוֹרֵש) to Mareshah (מָרֵשָה) -another play on words. 
<b>up to Adullam</b>—(which is within the border) will the glory of Israel retreat and come, for the enemies shall conquer from their border up to Adullam. So did <i>Jonathan</i> render: Until Adullam shall they go up and enter the border of the land of Israel. And I heard a Midrash Aggadah in the name of Rabbi Menachem: <b>I will yet bring the heir</b>—The children of Elam were fit to inherit the land of Israel - for he [Elam] was the firstborn of the sons of Shem - but because of love for your forefathers I transferred it to the children of Arphachshad. Now I will bring the Chaldeans and the Elamites upon them. 

### passuk 16
<b>Make bald</b>—Make your head bald. 
<b>and crop</b>—your hair. Cf. (<a class="refLink" href="/Job.1.20" data-ref="Job 1:20">Job 1:20</a>) “And he cropped (וָיָּגָז) his hair.” This is an expression of pulling out the hair. 
<b>like an eagle</b>—As the <i>Targum</i> renders. Like an eagle, whose feathers have fallen out. It is customary for an eagle to lose most of its feathers.
