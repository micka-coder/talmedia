<b>Cut the trees</b> Heb. עצה. This is not a ‘mappiq heh,’ yet it is an expression of a tree (עץ), for the expression of cutting is not appropriate for advice, (עצה), and עצה mentioned here is an expression of many trees, as דגה is an expression of many fish.

<b>thoroughly glean</b> (grappiller in French). After the vineyard has been gathered, and gleanings are left, and the poor come and glean them, so will they spoil and return and spoil.
<b>return your hand</b> You, the enemy, return your hand to spoil a second time, like a vintager who returns his hand for the search, who looks and searches for the gleanings. And so it was when he exiled Jehoiakim and slew him, and crowned Jeconiah, he returned three months later and exiled him. He returned eleven years later and exiled Zedekiah.
<b>the branches</b> Heb. סלסלות (reverchedures in O.F). Comp. (Prov. 4: 8) “Search for it (סלסלה) and it will exalt you.” So did Dunash (Teshuvoth Dunash p. 21) explain it. Menahem (Machbereth p. 126), however, explains it as an expression of a basket (סל) (paniers in O. F. baskets).

<b>And I have stationed lookouts over you</b> That is that they station men on the towers at the time of strife. A man looks and sees. If a troop is approaching the city he sounds a shophar and warns the people to arm and to come on the wall. I too appointed prophets who inform you about the impending retribution to alert yourselves and to mend your ways so that you be saved and that is like the shophar sounded by the lookout. Hearken to the sound of this shophar and arm yourselves.
<b>And I have stationed</b> Heb. והקמותי. This means: I have already stationed for them. And so did Jonathan render: ואקימית, and I stationed. <b>lookouts</b> (Badetes in O.F.).

<b>and roll</b> Heb. והתפלשי.
<b>a mourning [as] for an only child</b> A mourning for an only son; one who has only one son and he dies.

### passuk 27
<b>I have made you the strong one</b> This was said to Jeremiah. I have made you the strong one in their midst, and you shall know and test their way, that he tested them and they will not heed. בחון is an expression of strength. Comp.

### passuk 28
<b>extremely perverse</b> Turning away from the road.
<b>going tale bearing</b> between copper and iron. They introduce hatred between two princes who have the power to provoke one another. That is what I heard. But I say, they are tale bearers, and they are as strong as copper and iron to maintain their falsehood. Jonathan, however, renders this word רכיל as an expression of guile (נוכל). They go with guile as one mixes copper with iron. נוכל is an expression of plot. Comp. (Gen. 37:18) “And they plotted (ויתנכלו) against him to slay him.”

### passuk 29
<b>The bellows is heated</b> This is an allegory. When they refine silver, they blow with a bellows, and they always put lead into the crucible, which helps for the refining. But you—I have come to refine you. The bellows is heated and parched because of the fire, and the lead is completely consumed. נחר is an expression related to (Job 42:7) “My wrath has been kindled (חרה)”; (ibid. 30:30) “And my bones are burned (חרה) with heat,” (esrast in O.F.).
<b>in vain</b> In vain does the founder refine, for it is of no avail
<b>and the wicked ones have not been separated</b> from their evil way. That is to say that the prophets toiled to reprove, but it did not avail them.
<b>Separated</b> Heb. נתקו, (furent de... in O.F.). (Another version:) and the wicked ones. This is like רשעים.

### passuk 30
