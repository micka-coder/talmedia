<b>but I have found no rest</b> Heb. ומנוחה. The Shechinah has not rested upon me to prophesy. Cf. “And the spirit rested (ותנח) upon them” (Num. 12:26). “Why am I different from the disciples of the prophets? Joshua served Moses and the Holy Spirit rested upon him. Elisha served Elijah and the Holy Spirit rested upon him. Why am I different?”

<b>And you seek great things for yourself?</b> [“Great things” means] prophecies. Cf. “Please tell me all the great things etc.” (II Kings 8:4). “Call to me...and I will tell you great, etc,” (above 33:3). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: If there is no vineyard, there is no fence, and if there are no sheep, there is no shepherd. I reveal Myself to the prophets only in the merit of Israel. We learned this in the Mechilta, in the beginning.
