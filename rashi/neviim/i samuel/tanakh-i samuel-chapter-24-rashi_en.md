<b>To relieve himself.</b> To defecate.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Yevamos 103a states that the term ‘<span>לְהָסֵךְ אֶת דַגְלָיו</span>’ is a euphamistic expression. Because of his extreme modesty, Shaul covered himself like a succah [Maseches Berachos 62b], with his clothing. The word <span>לְהָסֵךְ</span> originates from <span>סִכוּדְ</span>, which means covered.—Radak.</i>

<b>He said to his men, "[Adonoy] forbid."</b> These two verses are not written in sequence;<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">According to Radak, these verses are written in chronological sequence, and this conversation took place after Dovid returned to his men with the cut piece of Shaul’s robe.</i> but since he began to speak regarding the cutting of the robe, he finished everything concerning it, and he said that he even regretted cutting the robe. Afterwards, he returns to the first subject, and says that regarding his men's comments, "Behold, concerning this day, etc." He replied to them, 'May Adonoy forbid that, etc.'

<b>Dovid pacified.</b> He separated and held them off with these words.<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">The literal meaning of <span>וַיְשַׁסַּע</span> is ‘he divided or split’ as in Shoftim 14:6. By being tactful in speaking to his men, Dovid divided their unanimous opinion of wanting to attack Shaul.—Metzudos</i>

<b>Why do you listen.</b> Why do you accept Do'eg's slander concerning me?<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi states that Dovid was alluding to Do’eg because Dovid said ‘why do you listen to the man [<span>אָדָם</span>]’, in the singular, referring to one individual person.</i>

### passuk 11
<b>Someone said to kill you, but I had mercy on you.</b> There are two words missing here, "and one who spoke [<span>הָאוֹמֵר</span>] said that I should kill you, but my soul [<span>נַפְשִׁי</span>] had pity on you, similar to "and King Dovid longed to go forth to Avshalom,"<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 13:39.</i> [meaning,] and Dovid's soul [<span>נֶפֶשׁ</span>] longed.

<b>From the wicked comes wickedness.<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">So let it not come from me even if you deserve it.—Radak.</i></b> The Holy One, Blessed is He, destines the wicked to fall into the hand of the wicked like himself. And where did the Torah say this, "And God destined it into his hand,"<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 21:13.</i> as it is stated in Maseches Makos.<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote"></i>
