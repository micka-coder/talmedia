<b>The word of Shmuel went out to all of Yisroel.</b> The word which was said to Shmuel, was fulfilled, and came to all Yisroel. How did this misfortune befall them? "Yisroel went out to war against the Philistines."<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">When Bnei Yisroel deserved punishment, ‘<span>ה</span> sometimes commanded them to go out and battle the Philistines even though it would end in their defeat.—Radak</i>
<b>Even Haezer</b> [Lit. the rock of help]. This was not yet its name,<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote"> Obviously, because they were soundly defeated now.</i> for it was first called this name [later] in Shmuel's time, but here Scripture calls it by its future name.

### passuk 2
<b>And the war spread.</b> And the war spread. Similar to, "and behold they were spread out [<span>נְטוּשִׁים</span>] across the face of the entire land"<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote"> Below 30:16.</i> and to "and they were spread out [<span>וַיִנָּטְשׁוּ</span>] at Lehi."<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Shoftim 15:9.</i>

<b>With every sort of plague in the wilderness.</b> By the Sea of Reeds. Targum Yonoson however, renders, 'and for His people He performed wonders in the wilderness.' In Sifrei we learn that this passage is a combination of statements, whoever made one statement did not make the other. The worthy among them said, "Who will save us from the hand of this mighty God?" while the wicked retorted, "This is the God Who smote the Egyptians with every plague. All the plagues which He had, He brought upon the Egyptians. He has no more plagues [to inflict]."

<b>A Binyaminite man.</b> This was Shaul,<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps the reason for Scripture not revealing that it was Shaul, was to protect the honor of his kingship being that he was responsible in part for Eili’s death.—Da’as Sofrim</i> who grabbed the Tablets from the hands of Golyas and fled.

<b>By the road looking out.</b> By the side of the road, he was anxiously waiting.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">He wanted to be situated in a place where a messenger would have to pass him first, and thus give him the news.</i>

<b>His neck.</b> [Targum renders] <span>אַפַּרְקוּתֵיה</span>, the bone of the neck.<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote"><span>מַפְרֶקֶת</span> is derived from <span>פֶּרֶק</span> [=link], meaning vertebra of which the bones of the neck and spine are made.</i>

### passuk 19
<b>To give birth.</b> Obviously [this word] means 'to give birth.' There is no similar form [in Scriptures]. However, Menachem<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Menachem was an authority on grammar and is often quoted by Rashi.</i> placed this verb in the section dealing with the word <span>יְלָלָה</span> 'wailing,' because her birth pangs came upon her with wailing. The root of '<span>יְלָלָה</span>' is the '<span>ל</span>' alone.
<b>Came suddenly.</b> Differed from what normally occurs, therefore she died.
<b>Her labor pains.</b> [<span>צִרֶיהָ</span>=hinges], i.e., 'the hinges of the doors of her womb';<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote"> See Bechoros 45a.</i><i>chardonel</i> in O. F.

<b>I chavod.</b> There is no glory; similar to, "He will save <span>"<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote"> Iyov 22:30.</i></span><span>אִי נָקִי</span> one who is not innocent, [meaning the same as] <span>אֵין נָקִי</span>.
<b>Because of the capture of.</b> Meaning the same as 'to the capture of', but it is unnecessary to remove the expression of 'to' for one who understands its meaning.
<b>Because of the capture of.</b> <i>Envers etweirs l'estre pris</i> in O. F.
<b>And because of her father-in-law.</b> I.e., because of this misfortune that her father-in-law and husband had perished.
