<b>s God has given him into my hand.</b> Meaning, delivered, and similarly, "And do not look on, on the day of your brother, on the day of his being delivered [<span>נכרו</span>]."<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Ovadyoh 1:12.</i> This is the conjugation of the strong [verbs e.g., Pi'el], as in, "He destroyed and broke her bars."<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Eichah 2:9.</i> If he desired to speak in the conjugation of the weak [verbs e.g., Kal], it would have been punctuated thus: <span>נָכַר</span>.
<b>For he has been shut in by entering a city that has doors and a bolt.</b> He will rely on that, and will not care to flee from it.

<b>Will Keilah's residents hand me over…</b> This teaches us that one who consults regarding two matters, receives a reply concerning only one, and that reply concerns the first one. And here, Dovid asked in an inverted order,<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Perhaps Dovid asked the questions in an inverted order because he was primarily interested whether Ke’ilah’s residents would hand him over to Shaul. He had assumed that Shaul would pursue him.</i> because he should have first asked,<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Yoma 73a. Dovid should have asked first what were Shaul’s intentions and then whether Ke’ilah’s residents would hand him over to Shaul. He was answered on the question that he should have asked first that “he [Shaul] will go down.”</i> "Will Shaul come down? Will [the residents of Keilah] hand me over?" But he was answered according to the [proper] order.

<b>For [someone] told me.</b> The one who told.<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">It can also be understood literally, that “he told me…” refers to Dovid. During the period that Dovid served before Shaul, he would describe to Shaul the cunning ways in which he outsmarted the Philistines.—Radak</i>

<b>The "Rock of Divisions."</b> Shaul's heart was divided by two thoughts,<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Or it may refer to the division among Shaul’s troops as to whether to pursue Dovid or to battle the Philistines.—Radak</i> whether to return to save his country from the Philistines, or to pursue and catch Dovid; thus renders Targum Yonoson.
