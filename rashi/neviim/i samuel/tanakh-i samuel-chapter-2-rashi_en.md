<b>My mouth is enlarged.</b> Against Penina.

### passuk 2
<b>And there is no stronghold like our God.</b> There is no artist<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote"> Rashi disregards the usual rendering of <span>צוֹר</span> [=Rock], which represents the awesome powers of ‘<span>ה</span> Who is able to change the laws of nature. Seen Devarim 32:4.</i> [<span>צַיָר</span>] like our God Who fashions a form within a form.<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Maseches Berachos 10a.</i>

### passuk 3
<b>Do not abound in speaking so very proudly.</b> All those who are haughty when they experience good fortune. About Penina who behaved haughtily toward her, was she speaking, according to the simple explanation. However, according to the <i>drash,</i> we follow Targum Yonoson's rendition [that she is referring to Nevuchadnetzar].
<b>Harshness.</b> Strong speech. Others explain <span>עָתָק</span> as an expression of something which is removed [from the truth], as in "from there he moved [<span>וַיַעְתֵּק</span>] to the mountain."<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">Bereishis 12:8.</i> [The meaning here being "let not] falsehood come out of your mouth."
<b>For a God of knowledge is Adonoy.</b> He knows what is in your hearts.
<b>And by Him all actions are counted.</b> All people's deeds are counted before Him.
<b>Counted.</b> An expression of number, as in, "and the number [<span>וְתֹכֶן</span>] of bricks shall you give."<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 5:18.</i>

### passuk 4
<b>The bows of the mighty are broken…</b> This is the custom of the Holy One, Blessed is He. He weakens the mighty and strengthens the weak, He sates the hungry and starves the sated.

### passuk 5
<b>The sated have hired themselves out for bread.</b> [The sated] who do not need to hire themselves out for any work, He starves them and they must hire themselves out for bread,
<b>And the hungry</b> Who would toil and weary themselves for food.
<b>Have ceased.</b> From their toil.
<b>Until the barren has born seven and she with many children….</b> While the barren woman has born seven,<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote"> Others interpret that the seven children mentioned are not literally seven and with reference to Peninah, but rather it is an expression that means “many children.” See above 1:8.—Radak</i> she that had many children has been bereaved and buries her children. Chana bore seven as it is stated, "For Adonoy remembered Chana and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters." When Chana bore one, Penina buried two.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Below verse 21.</i> Penina had ten children as it is stated, "Am I not better to you than [the] ten sons of Penina?"<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">Above 1:8.</i> When Chana bore four, Penina buried eight. When she [Chana] conceived and bore a fifth child, Penina prostrated herself at her feet and begged for mercy and they lived and were therefore considered as hers. This is R. Nechemya's opinion. R. Yehudah however says that grandchildren are considered as children. Some are of the opinion that the numerical value of <span>שִׁבְעָה</span><span>(</span>377<span>)</span> is equivalent to that of <span>שְׁמוּאֵל</span><span>(</span>377<span>)</span>.

<b>His pious ones.</b> It is spelled <span>חֲסִידוֹ</span> "His pious <i>one"</i> but read <span>חֲסִידָיו</span> "His pious <i>ones,"</i> [meaning] whether a single one or many. Similarly "may His adversaries be broken." [The reading is <span>מְרִיבָיו</span> "His adversaries" but] the spelling is <span>מְרִיבוֹ</span> "His adversary," meaning whether a single adversary or many.

### passuk 10
<b>Let Him thunder against them from heaven.</b> The spelling is <span>עָלוּ</span> "they have ascended" meaning that even if they have ascended to the heavens, He thunders upon them and casts them down.
<b>May Adonoy judge the ends of the earth.</b> He judges and punishes them. <i>Justisier</i> in O. F.

### passuk 11
<b>Served Adonoy in the presence of Eili the kohein.</b> From here [our Sages conclude] that "whoever serves before a Torah scholar is considered as though he had served before the Divine Presence."<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote">Talmud Yerushalmi Eruvin 5:1. The reason being that a Torah scholar cleaves to ‘<span>ה</span> in his thoughts at all times so that even his physical activities are holy.</i>

<b>They had disgraced.</b> Meaning despised.

### passuk 18
<b>A lad girded with a linen robe.</b> [Targum renders] "<span>כַּרְדּוּט</span> of linen," meaning a robe, for Targum Yonoson renders <span>מְעִילִים</span> in the passage <span>כִּי כֵן תִּלְבַּשְׁנָה הַבְּתוּלוֹת מְעִילִים</span> "for such so <span>מְעִילִים</span> were worn by the maidens…",<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">II Shmuel 13:18.</i> as <span>כַּרְדוּטִין</span>.

<b>Eili would then bless them.</b> This is the present tense, i.e., he would bless him every year.

### passuk 21

### passuk 22
<b>That they would lie.</b> The explanation is according to the simple sense. Our Rabbis however said<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">In Maseches Yoma 9a-b.</i> that since they delayed [the sacrifice of] their birds<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote"> See Vayikra 15:29 and 22:6-8.</i> and they would wait until they would see their birds being offered, Scripture charges them as though they had lain with them.<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Shabbos 55b. Metzudas Dovid translates this phrase as “they would cause the women who assembled at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to sleep there,” thereby not allowing them to return to their homes and husbands.</i>

### passuk 25
<b>Tries him.</b><span>וּפִלְלוֹ</span> is an expression of judgment, as in, "and he shall pay by order of the judges <span>]</span><span>פְלִילִים</span><span>[</span>."<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">Shemos 21:22.</i>
<b>Judge.</b> The judge.
<b>For it was Adonoy's will to kill them.</b> For their verdict had already been sealed.<sup>16</sup><i class="footnote">See Maseches Rosh Hashanah 18b.</i> Before the verdict is sealed however, Scripture states, "for I do not desire the death of one who should die."<sup>17</sup><i class="footnote">Yechezkeil 27:32.</i>

### passuk 26

### passuk 27
<b>The man of God came.</b> This was Elkonoh.
<b>Have I not repeatedly revealed Myself to your ancestor's family.</b> From here [our Sages concluded] that Aharon prophesied in Egypt. What was the prophecy? It is stated, "and I said to them, 'Every man, cast away the detestable idols of his eyes, do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt.'"<sup>18</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 20:7.</i>
<b>Have I not repeatėdly revealed Myself.</b> Did you know that this favor and greatness I gave to Aharon.<sup>19</sup><i class="footnote">Ralbag interprets this phrase as an affirmative statement, i.e., “I did indeed reveal myself to the…”</i>

<b>Which I commanded you [to bring in My] Sanctuary.</b> Which I commanded in My dwelling place.
<b>To feed yourselves from the choice parts…</b> This is an inverted sentence [meaning], "you honor your sons more than Me ," <span>]</span><span>לְעַמִּי</span><span>[</span> before My people, i.e., in the eyes of My people, you honor your sons more than Me. And what is the honor? To feed yourselves from the choice parts of all the offerings of Yisroel. Your meal preceded My meal, as it is stated, "even before they would burn the fat…"<sup>20</sup><i class="footnote">Above verse 15.</i>
<b>To feed yourselves.</b> [<span>לְהַבְרִיאֲכֶם</span>] is an expression of having a meal, as in, "Please let my sister Tamar come and serve [<span>וְתַבְרֵנִי</span>] me bread."<sup>21</sup><i class="footnote"> II Shmuel 13:5.</i>
<b>My people.</b> This reverts to, "you honor your sons more than Me." You showed My people that you are more honored than I. And how have you shown this? By feeding yourselves from the choice parts of My offerings.<sup>22</sup><i class="footnote">It may also be interpreted as referring to the part of the sacrifice that belonged to the people who brought the offering, that Eili’s sons took for themselves.</i>

### passuk 30
<b>I had indeed decreed.</b> Twice I assigned greatness to the sons of Isomor: Concerning the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merori, it is stated, "Under the direction of Isomor, the son of Aharon the kohein."<sup>23</sup><i class="footnote"> Bamidbar 4:33.</i> And Eili was one of the descendants of Isomor. This [explanation] I saw in Midrash Shmuel. I have, however, heard a more fitting explanation: "I had indeed decreed that your family and your father's family…" Originally I made Elozor the kohein to serve as kohein gadol, as it is stated, "remove Aharon's vestments, [and dress Elozor his son in them]."<sup>24</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid., 20:26.</i> However, at the time of the concubine,<sup>25</sup><i class="footnote"> See Shoftim Chapters 19-21.</i> Yisroel divested themselves of most mitzvos. And who was to blame [for this]? Pinchas and his associate kohanim, who should have gone around from city to city to reprove them. I therefore took the <i>kehunah gedolah</i> away from them, and gave it to you, for you are of Isomor's descendants, and I said, that they shall walk before Me forever; for when greatness is assigned to a person, it is assigned to him and to his generations forever.
<b>For I honor those who honor Me.</b> Pinchas' descendants who honored Me at Shittim.<sup>26</sup><i class="footnote">Bamidbar 25:7-8.</i> And this happened in the days of Shlomo, that when the Temple was built, Shlomo dismissed Evyosor from being a <i>kohein [gadol]</i> to '<span>ה</span>, fulfilling the word of '<span>ה</span> which He had spoken concerning Eili's family.<sup>27</sup><i class="footnote"> I Melochim 2:27.</i> And Tzadok became the <i>kohein gadol,</i> because he was of Pinchas' descendants; he is so listed in the genealogical records in Divrei Hayomim.<sup>28</sup><i class="footnote">I Divrei Hayomim 6:35-38.</i>
<b>And those who dishonor Me will be cursed.</b> By. themselves, when I will withdraw Myself from them.<sup>29</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to Eili’s sons from whom the <i>kehunah gedolah</i> would be removed in the time of Shlomo Hamelech.</i>

<b>I shall cut off your arm.</b> I.e., the power which you exert in My House, for you say, "or else I will take it by force."

### passuk 32
<b>And you will see a rival [in My] Sanctuary.</b> And you will see your rival at your side in My Sanctuary just as a woman who sees her rival with her in the house.
<b>Throughout all the good that He will bring upon Yisroel.</b> When the Temple will be built in the days of Shlomo, and the goodness promised to Yisroel will be complete, as it is said there, "Not one word has gone unfulfilled from His entire gracious promise.<sup>30</sup><i class="footnote">I Melochim 8:56.</i> Yehudah and Yisroel were numerous, like the sand that is by the sea.<sup>31</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 4:20.</i> And Yehudah and Yisroel dwelt in security, each man under his grapevine and under his fig tree… all the days of Shlomo."<sup>32</sup><i class="footnote">Ibid. 5:5.</i>
<b>But there will be no elder in your family.</b> This is an appropriate punishment. You ate sacrifices before the [permitted] time, before they burnt the fat, so too, you will die before your time.

### passuk 33
<b>And sadden.</b><span>וְלַאֲדִיב</span> is the same as <span><sup>33</sup><i class="footnote">See Devorim 28:65.</i></span><span>וְלַדְאִיב</span> [disillusioned].
<b>Will die as [young] men.</b> Young. There is no comparison between the mourning for a young man and the mourning for a child.<sup>34</sup><i class="footnote">Whose loss though tragic, is less keenly felt than the loss of a young man.</i>

### passuk 34
<b>This is the sign to you.</b> That the prophecy will be fulfilled: In one day your two sons will die, and this will be the sign for you for the fulfillment<sup>35</sup><i class="footnote">He needed a sign in the near future to authenticate the prophecy that all the punishments described will come true.</i> of all the retribution that was said to you, "and you will see a rival in My Sanctuary," "and all those raised in your house will die as [young] men."<sup>36</sup><i class="footnote">Above verses 32-33.</i>
