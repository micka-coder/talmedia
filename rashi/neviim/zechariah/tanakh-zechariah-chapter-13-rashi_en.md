### passuk 1
<b>for purification and for sprinkling</b> and for sprinkling. So did Jonathan paraphrase: I will forgive their sins as they become purified with sprinkling water and with the ashes of the cow of purification; i.e., with the ashes of purification.

### passuk 2
<b>And also the prophets</b> The false prophets.
<b>and the spirit of contamination</b> The evil inclination.

### passuk 3

### passuk 4
<b>a hairy mantle</b> So is the custom of those who entice or draw away [the people], to enwrap themselves with mantles as though they are righteous men in order that their lies be accepted.

### passuk 5
<b>for a man entrusted me with his cattle</b> Menahem (Machbereth p. 156, second definition.) interpreted as an expression of “livestock of flocks and livestock of cattle” (Gen. 26:14). He entrusted me from my youth to watch his livestock.

### passuk 6
<b>And one will say to him, “What are these wounds between your hands?”</b> Between your shoulders. There they flog the sinners.
<b>in the house of my friends</b> who loved me and reproved me to the straight path.

### passuk 7
<b>O sword, awaken against My shepherd</b> Against the one whom I appointed over the flock of My exile.
<b>and against the man who is associated with Me</b> whom I associated with Me to watch My flocks as I do.
<b>Smite the shepherd</b> The king of the border of wickedness.
<b>and the flock shall scatter</b> The flock subjected to his rule; lit. pressed down under his hand.
<b>and I will return My hand</b> And I will repeat My blows a second time.
<b>upon the little ones</b> Upon the rulers who are smaller than the kings. And Jonathan renders: <b>and the flock shall scatter</b> And the rulers shall scatter, and he renders: <b>upon the little ones</b> Their officers, who are second to them. And so did Jonathan render this verse as referring to the nations: O sword, reveal yourself against the king and against the ruler, his colleague who is like him, who resembles him, said the Lord of Hosts. Slay the king, and the rulers shall scatter. This wording of the Targum does not apply to Israel, for we do not find in the Targum or in the Scriptures [any words] but “a king and princes” [when referring to Israel], and the Aramaic translation thereof is רַבְרְבִין, great ones.

### passuk 8
<b>and the third shall remain therein</b> They shall proselytize and live.

### passuk 9
<b>And I will bring the third in fire</b> And I will bring the third in straits in the smelting-pot of fire (Jonathan), so that some of the proselytes should bear the birth pang of the Messiah and the war of Gog and Magog with Israel. From there they shall be tested [as to] whether [or not] they are true proselytes. Then, many of those who previously converted to Judaism shall return to their pre- conversion customs and join Gog. We find [this idea] in the Aggadah (Avodah Zarah 3b; Midrash Psalms 2:5, footnote 29).
<b>and he shall say, “The Lord...”</b> When he prays, he will pray to the Lord and not to his previous deity.
