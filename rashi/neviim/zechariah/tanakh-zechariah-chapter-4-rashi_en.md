<b>with its oil - bowl on top of it</b> as in (Josh. 15:19): “The upper springs”. This is an expression for a spring, [hence] a sort of large round bowl.
<b>and its seven lamps</b> A type of vessel into which oil and wicks are inserted.
<b>seven tubes each</b> Seven small tubes come to every lamp, for the oil flows from the bowl through those tubes into each lamp.

### passuk 3
<b>And [there were] two olive trees near it</b> Beside it were two trees upon which olives were growing.
<b>one on the right of the bowl, one on the its left, etc.</b> Here [the prophet] does not explain about the two golden vats mentioned below in the chapter, which are the sorts of bowls or vats of the oil press. [These vats] stand beside the olive trees. The olives beat themselves into the vats and are heated there as [if] in a vat or pit where olives are generally packed. There they are pressed in the oil press, and the oil falls into the vats, and from the vats into the bowl, and from the bowl into the tubes, and from the tubes into the lamps. The tubes and the lamps number forty-nine, an allusion to the light, for in the future the light of the sun will be sevenfold the light of the seven days forty-nine times the light of a day of Creation.

### passuk 4
<b>“What are these, my Lord?”</b> What is this, that the olive trees are picked by themselves, and the oil comes into the lamps by itself?

<b>“This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel”</b> This is a sign for you to promise Zerubbabel that just as the olives and this oil are finished by themselves in all respects, so will you not build My house with your [own] power or with your [own] strength.
<b>but by My spirit</b> I will place My spirit upon Darius, and he will command you to build and to pay all the building expenses from his [treasury]; and [he will] help you with wheat, wine, oil, and wood, as is explained in Ezra (6, 7): They required no aid from any man.

<b>Who are you, O great mountain?</b> You, the princes of the other side of the river Tattenai, the governor of the other side of the river; Shethar Bozenai, and their companions (Ezra 6:6), who have stopped the work until now - from now on you shall be before Zerubbabel as a plain; you have no more ruling power or superiority over him.
<b>He will bring out the stone of the main architect</b> The main architect will take the plummet in his hand to be the main architect at the head of the builders, and they will build everything according to his words [everything] that he will order concerning a beautiful and glorious building.
<b>with shouts of grace, grace to it</b> To that stone, for everyone will say, “How beautiful is this building that was made with this plummet.” [The expression] “shouts of grace” is as (Job 39:7) “the shouts of a driver,” and (Isa. 66:6) “a sound of stirring” both of which are expressions of making a voice heard.

<b>these, sevenfold</b> Seven times the first foundation in the days of Cyrus. So did <i>Jonathan</i> render: Seven rows of stones like these.
<b>the eyes of the Lord are roving to and fro</b> And it appeals to Him to do so; and He saw this Zerubbabel suited for the matter.

### passuk 11

### passuk 12
