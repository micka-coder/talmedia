What excuse he could seek [in order] to lay with her.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">According to Rashi, the words in our verse, “because she was a virgin” do not tell us why Amnon was desirous of her. The reason for his desire was because she was pretty. Rashi consequently explains that these words are telling us why she was inaccessible to Amnon and are connected to the words that follow, “it was hidden in the eyes of Amnon” to find a way to lay with her.</i> Similar to "When it is concealed from you",<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">Devorim 17:8.</i> [which] Onkelus translates: "When it is hidden from you."
