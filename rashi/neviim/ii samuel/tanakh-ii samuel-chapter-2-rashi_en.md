Because the Holy One, blessed is He told Yakov, "Kings will come forth from you," and [by this time] all of his children had been born except for Binyomin.<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">“Will come forth from you” implies that they were to come from someone yet unborn, and this could only be Binyomin. Avner understood this to mean that two kings will be descendant from Binyomin, Shaul and Ish Boshes (Rashi and Sifsei Chachomin, Breshis 35,11).</i>

<b>Nineteen men and Asoel.</b> But is not Asoel included in [the group called] "the servants of Dovid," so why is he [singled] out? [The reason is] he was worth all of them [together] and so too [a similar case], (Yehoshua 2,1), "Go see [and spy out] the land and Yericho"<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">Yericho was as strong as the entire land combined (see Rashi there).</i> and so too [another similar case] "King Shlomo loved many foreign women and the daughter of Pharaoh."<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">Shlomo cherished Pharaoh’s daughter as much as he did the rest of them put together. (See Rashi ibid).</i> (Kings I, 11, 1 ).
