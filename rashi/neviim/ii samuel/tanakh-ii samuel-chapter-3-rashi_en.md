<b>His second [son] was Kilov.</b> [But] in another place<sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Divrei Hayomim I, 3,1.</i> [Scriptures] calls him, "and his second [son] was Doniel".<sup>2</sup><i class="footnote">i.e., refers to the second son of Dovid not as Kilov but as Doniel, his true name.</i> So why is his called [here] by the name of Kilov? Rebbe Yitzchok said [to answer this question] : Because the generation's cynics were saying that Avigail was pregnant from Novol,<sup>3</sup><i class="footnote">That Doniel was the son of Novol and not Dovid.</i> [consequently Hashem caused] his facial features to change and resemble his father.<sup>4</sup><i class="footnote">His resemblance to Dovid earned him the name of <span>כִלְאָב</span> a play on <span>כּוּלוֹ אָב</span>, “completely his father.”</i> And our Rabbis said<sup>5</sup><i class="footnote">Berochos 4a.</i> that [this name of Kilov was due to the fact that] he embarrassed Mephiboshes through Halacha.<sup>6</sup><i class="footnote">Doniel’s superior knowledge became evident during the course of his halachic debates with Mipiboshes. According to this Derosho, the letters <span>כל</span> of <span>כִלְאָב</span> stand for <span>מַכְלׅים</span>.</i>
"It was on account of the scoffers of the generation, who said, 'Avigayil (Kilav's mom) was pregnant from Naval (her previous husband),' and so [G-d] changed his appearance and he resembled his father (David)." And our Rabbis said, "Because he embarassed Mephiboshet in law study (Berakhot 4a)"

<b>By Egloh</b> This refers to Michal<sup>7</sup><i class="footnote">The daughter of Shaul.</i> who was cherished by him. Similarly it says "If you had not plowed with my calf" (Shoftim 14, 18).<sup>8</sup><i class="footnote"><span>עגלה</span>, “calf” is used in reference to a cherished wife just as a calf is cherished by it’s owner (See Sanhedrin 21a).</i> [But] it is written, "And Michal, the daughter of Shaul had no child until the day of her death" (Below, 6, 23) she didn't have one until the day of her death<sup>9</sup><i class="footnote">At which time she died in childbirth (ibid).</i>?<sup>10</sup><i class="footnote">That verse implies that Michal had no children up to the time of her death, but our verse states that Egloh, i.e. Michal gave birth to Yisrom.</i> From that incident<sup>11</sup><i class="footnote">Dovid rejoiced excessively when the Ark was returned from captivity. Michal rebuked Dovid for what seemed to her to be behavior beneath his dignity. This was not the case and she was punished for the unwarranted shaming of Dovid.

<b>Am I the chief dog [watcher] for [the kingdom of] Yehudah?</b> Am I at least as important as the chief dog watcher for Dovid. However, according to the cantillation which has the accent under [the word] <span>ראׁשׁ</span> and [the word] <span>כֶּלֶב אָנׂכׅי</span> coralled [together],<sup>12</sup><i class="footnote">Rashi’s first explanation is assumming that the words <span>ראש</span> and <span>כלב</span> are connected. However, the cantillation indicates that they are separate. Instead, the words <span>כלב אנכי</span> belong together. This compels Rashi to offer an alternative explanation.</i> then this is the explanation: The chief? Do I want to be a chief in your house? It is better for me to be a dog and an ordinary person in the house of Dovid. This is also Yonasan's translation.
<b>From this day on should I [continue to] be kind.</b> From now on [is it] proper for me to be kind to the house of Shaul and with all those who love him as I have done until now and I have not delivered you into the hand of Dovid?

Another interpretation: "<b>Below him,</b>" [Avner] mentioned his name first in the message letter and afterwords he mentioned Dovid's name and that is why he was punished. [This is what] he wrote: From me, Avner, the general of Yisroel to Dovid, the king of Yisroel, peace salutation.

<b>Following and crying.</b> Over the good deed [about to be] leaving him because all those years he thrust a sword into the bed [separating] between him and her and he did not stumble [into sinful intimacy] with her.<sup>13</sup><i class="footnote">Shaul did not consider her married to Dovid because he considered Dovid’s Kiddushin having been done using a loan which is an invalid Kiddushin. However, in fact, Dovid had used regular material wealth as his means for Kiddushin which made Dovid halachically married to Michal. This meant that Paltiel Ben Loyish was living in the same house with another man’s wife. For all those years Paltiel made sure never to touch her and thus was spiritually elevated by subduing his lustful inclination. Now that she was leaving, he was saddenned to no longer have the opportunity for this type of spiritual greatness. (Sanhedrin, ibid).</i>

<b>From Bor HaSiroh.</b> The name of a place [But] the Rabbis said: A well and a thorn caused Avner to be killed, by not grasping unto the deeds of Dovid, by [ignoring] the jug of water that [Dovid] took from [under] the head of Shaul<sup>14</sup><i class="footnote">This is reference to Shmuel I, 26,12 where Dovid was being pursued by Shaul and Avner. Dovid found them sleeping and hence vulnerable. Not wanting to harm them but wanting to show Shaul he had been there, Dovid took the spear and the jug of water that was underneath Shaul’s head.</i> and also [by ignoring] the corner of Shaul's garment<sup>15</sup><i class="footnote">This is a reference to Shmuel I, 24,5 where Shaul, in pursuit of Dovid, stopped temporarily inside the cave where Dovid was hiding with his men. Dovid did not kill him but surreptitiously caught off the corner of Shaul’s garment.</i> [Avner dismissed this and] he said "Perhaps one of the thorns caught upon [the garment] and tore it.
