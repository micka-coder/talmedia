### passuk 1
In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple.

### passuk 2
Above Him stood the seraphim; each one had six wings: with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.

### passuk 3
And one called unto another, and said: Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts; The whole earth is full of His glory.

### passuk 4
And the posts of the door were moved at the voice of them that called, and the house was filled with smoke.

### passuk 5
Then said I: Woe is me! for I am undone; Because I am a man of unclean lips, And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; For mine eyes have seen the King, The LORD of hosts.

### passuk 6
Then flew unto me one of the seraphim, with a glowing stone in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;

### passuk 7
and he touched my mouth with it, and said: Lo, this hath touched thy lips; And thine iniquity is taken away, And thy sin expiated.

### passuk 8
And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I send, And who will go for us? Then I said: ‘Here am I; send me.’

### passuk 9
And He said: ‘Go, and tell this people: Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.

### passuk 10
Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they, seeing with their eyes, and hearing with their ears, and understanding with their heart, return, and be healed.’

### passuk 11
Then said I: ‘Lord, how long?’ And He answered: ‘Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, And the land become utterly waste,

### passuk 12
And the LORD have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.

### passuk 13
And if there be yet a tenth in it, it shall again be eaten up; as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they cast their leaves, so the holy seed shall be the stock thereof.’
