### passuk 1
Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; And dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; And when thou art weary with dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.

### passuk 2
O LORD, be gracious unto us; We have waited for Thee; be Thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.

### passuk 3
At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of Thyself the nations are scattered.

### passuk 4
And your spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathereth; as locusts leap do they leap upon it.

### passuk 5
The LORD is exalted, for He dwelleth on high; He hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness.

### passuk 6
And the stability of thy times shall be a hoard of salvation—wisdom and knowledge, And the fear of the LORD which is His treasure.

### passuk 7
Behold, their valiant ones cry without; The ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.

### passuk 8
The highways lie waste, The wayfaring man ceaseth; He hath broken the covenant, He hath despised the cities, He regardeth not man.

### passuk 9
The land mourneth and languisheth; Lebanon is ashamed, it withereth; Sharon is like a wilderness; And Bashan and Carmel are clean bare.

### passuk 10
Now will I arise, saith the LORD; Now will I be exalted; now will I lift Myself up.

### passuk 11
Ye conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble; Your breath is a fire that shall devour you.

### passuk 12
And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime; As thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.

### passuk 13
Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; And, ye that are near, acknowledge My might.

### passuk 14
The sinners in Zion are afraid; Trembling hath seized the ungodly: ‘Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?’

### passuk 15
He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; He that despiseth the gain of oppressions, That shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, That stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, And shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil;

### passuk 16
He shall dwell on high; His place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks; His bread shall be given, his waters shall be sure.

### passuk 17
Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty; they shall behold a land stretching afar.

### passuk 18
Thy heart shall muse on the terror: ‘Where is he that counted, where is he that weighed? Where is he that counted the towers?’

### passuk 19
Thou shalt not see the fierce people; A people of a deep speech that thou canst not perceive, Of a stammering tongue that thou canst not understand.

### passuk 20
Look upon Zion, the city of our solemn gatherings; Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a peaceful habitation, A tent that shall not be removed, The stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, Neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.

### passuk 21
But there the LORD will be with us in majesty, In a place of broad rivers and streams; Wherein shall go no galley with oars, Neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.

### passuk 22
For the LORD is our Judge, The LORD is our Lawgiver, The LORD is our King; He will save us.

### passuk 23
Thy tacklings are loosed; They do not hold the stand of their mast, They do not spread the sail; Then is the prey of a great spoil divided; The lame take the prey.

### passuk 24
And the inhabitant shall not say: ‘I am sick’; The people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.
