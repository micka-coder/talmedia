. . . saying: If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man’s, may he return unto her again? Will not that land be greatly polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; and wouldest thou yet return to Me? Saith the LORD.

### passuk 2

### passuk 3
Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there hath been no latter rain; yet thou hadst a harlot’s forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.

### passuk 4
Didst thou not just now cry unto Me: ‘My father, Thou art the friend of my youth.

### passuk 5
Will He bear grudge for ever? Will He keep it to the end?’ Behold, thou hast spoken, but hast done evil things, and hast had thy way.

### passuk 6

### passuk 8
And I saw, when, forasmuch as backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement, that yet treacherous Judah her sister feared not; but she also went and played the harlot;

### passuk 9
and it came to pass through the lightness of her harlotry, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks;

### passuk 10
and yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto Me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD—

### passuk 11
even the LORD said unto me—backsliding Israel hath proved herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.

### passuk 12
Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say: Return, thou backsliding Israel, Saith the LORD; I will not frown upon you; For I am merciful, saith the LORD, I will not bear grudge for ever.

### passuk 13
Only acknowledge thine iniquity, That thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God, And hast scattered thy ways to the strangers Under every leafy tree, And ye have not hearkened to My voice, Saith the LORD.

Return, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am a lord unto you, and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion;

### passuk 15
and I will give you shepherds according to My heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.

### passuk 16
And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more: The ark of the covenant of the LORD; neither shall it come to mind; neither shall they make mention of it; neither shall they miss it; neither shall it be made any more.

### passuk 17

### passuk 20
Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, So have ye dealt treacherously with Me, O house of Israel, Saith the LORD.

### passuk 21
Hark! upon the high hills is heard The suppliant weeping of the children of Israel; For that they have perverted their way, They have forgotten the LORD their God.

### passuk 22
Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings.— ‘Here we are, we are come unto Thee; For Thou art the LORD our God.

### passuk 23
Truly vain have proved the hills, The uproar on the mountains; Truly in the LORD our God Is the salvation of Israel.

### passuk 24

### passuk 25
Let us lie down in our shame, And let our confusion cover us; For we have sinned against the LORD our God, We and our fathers, From our youth even unto this day; And we have not hearkened To the voice of the LORD our God.’
