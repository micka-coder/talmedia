Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying:

### passuk 2
You only have I known of all the families of the earth; Therefore I will visit upon you all your iniquities.

### passuk 3
Will two walk together, Except they have agreed?

### passuk 4
Will a lion roar in the forest, When he hath no prey? Will a young lion give forth his voice out of his den, If he have taken nothing?

### passuk 5
Will a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, Where there is no lure for it? Will a snare spring up from the ground, And have taken nothing at all?

### passuk 6
Shall the horn be blown in a city, And the people not tremble? Shall evil befall a city, And the LORD hath not done it?

### passuk 7
For the Lord GOD will do nothing, But He revealeth His counsel unto His servants the prophets.

### passuk 8
The lion hath roared, Who will not fear? The Lord GOD hath spoken, Who can but prophesy?

### passuk 9
Proclaim it upon the palaces at Ashdod, And upon the palaces in the land of Egypt, And say: ‘Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, And behold the great confusions therein, And the oppressions in the midst thereof.’

### passuk 10
For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, Who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.

### passuk 11
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: An adversary, even round about the land! And he shall bring down thy strength from thee, And thy palaces shall be spoiled.

### passuk 12
Thus saith the LORD: As the shepherd rescueth out of the mouth of the lion Two legs, or a piece of an ear, So shall the children of Israel that dwell in Samaria Escape with the corner of a couch, and the leg of a bed.

### passuk 13
Hear ye, and testify against the house of Jacob, Saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts.

### passuk 14
For in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also punish the altars of Beth-el, And the horns of the altar shall be cut off, And fall to the ground.

### passuk 15
And I will smite the winter-house with the summer-house; And the houses of ivory shall perish, And the great houses shall have an end, Saith the LORD.
