For the Leader. A Psalm of David.

### passuk 2
Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man; Preserve me from the violent man;

### passuk 3
Who devise evil things in their heart; Every day do they stir up wars.

### passuk 4
They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; Vipers' venom is under their lips. Selah

### passuk 5
Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from the violent man; Who have purposed to make my steps slip.

### passuk 6
The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set gins for me. Selah

### passuk 7
I have said unto the LORD: 'Thou art my God'; Give ear, O LORD, unto the voice of my supplications.

### passuk 8
O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, Who hast screened my head in the day of battle,

### passuk 9
Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; Further not his evil device, so that they exalt themselves. Selah

### passuk 10
As for the head of those that compass me about, Let the mischief of their own lips cover them.

### passuk 11
Let burning coals fall upon them; Let them be cast into the fire, Into deep pits, that they rise not up again.

### passuk 12
A slanderer shall not be established in the earth; The violent and evil man shall be hunted with thrust upon thrust.

### passuk 13
I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the poor, And the right of the needy.

### passuk 14
Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto Thy name; The upright shall dwell in Thy presence.
