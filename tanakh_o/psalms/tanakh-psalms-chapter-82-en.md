A Psalm of Asaph. God standeth in the congregation of God; in the midst of the judges He judgeth:

### passuk 2
'How long will ye judge unjustly, and respect the persons of the wicked? Selah

### passuk 3
Judge the poor and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and destitute.

### passuk 4
Rescue the poor and needy; deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.

### passuk 5
They know not, neither do they understand; they go about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are moved.

I said: Ye are godlike beings, and all of you sons of the Most High.

### passuk 7
Nevertheless ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.'

### passuk 8
Arise, O God, judge the earth; for Thou shalt possess all the nations.
