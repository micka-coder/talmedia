### passuk 1
[A Psalm] of David. Maschil. Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is pardoned.

### passuk 2
Happy is the man unto whom the LORD counteth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no guile.

### passuk 3
When I kept silence, my bones wore away Through my groaning all the day long.

### passuk 4
For day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me; My sap was turned as in the droughts of summer. Selah

### passuk 5
I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid; I said: 'I will make confession concerning my transgressions unto the LORD' â€” And Thou, Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah

### passuk 6
For this let every one that is godly pray unto Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found; Surely, when the great waters overflow, they will not reach unto him.

### passuk 7
Thou art my hiding-place; Thou wilt preserve me from the adversary; With songs of deliverance Thou wilt compass me about. Selah

### passuk 8
'I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will give counsel, Mine eye being upon thee.'

### passuk 9
Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding; Whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, That they come not near unto thee.

### passuk 10
Many are the sorrows of the wicked; But he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy compasseth him about.

### passuk 11
Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous; And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
