For the Leader, for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David.

### passuk 2
I said: 'I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue; I will keep a curb upon my mouth, while the wicked is before me.'

### passuk 3
I was dumb with silence; I held my peace, had no comfort; and my pain was held in check.

### passuk 4
My heart waxed hot within me; while I was musing, the fire kindled; Then spoke I with my tongue:

### passuk 5
'LORD, make me to know mine end, And the measure of my days, what it is; Let me know how short-lived I am.

### passuk 6
Behold, Thou hast made my days as hand-breadths; and mine age is as nothing before Thee; surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. Selah

### passuk 7
Surely man walketh as a mere semblance; surely for vanity they are in turmoil; He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.

### passuk 8
And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope, it is in Thee.

### passuk 9
Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of the base.

### passuk 10
I am dumb, I open not my mouth; because Thou hast done it.

### passuk 11
Remove Thy stroke from off me; I am consumed by the blow of Thy hand.

### passuk 12
With rebukes dost Thou chasten man for iniquity, and like a moth Thou makest his beauty to consume away; surely every man is vanity. Selah

### passuk 13
Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; keep not silence at my tears; for I am a stranger with Thee, a sojourner, as all my fathers were.

### passuk 14
Look away from me, that I may take comfort, before I go hence, and be no more.'
