For the Leader. A Psalm of David, a Song.

### passuk 2

### passuk 6
A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, Is God in His holy habitation.

### passuk 17
Why look ye askance, ye mountains of peaks, At the mountain which God hath desired for His abode? Yea, the LORD will dwell therein for ever.

### passuk 18
The chariots of God are myriads, even thousands upon thousands; The Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in holiness.

### passuk 19
Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led captivity captive; Thou hast received gifts among men, Yea, among the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell there.

### passuk 20
Blessed be the Lord, day by day He beareth our burden, Even the God who is our salvation. Selah

To Him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which are of old; Lo, He uttereth His voice, a mighty voice.
