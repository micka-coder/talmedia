### passuk 1
A Song of Ascents; of David. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brethren to dwell together in unity!

### passuk 2
It is like the precious oil upon the head, Coming down upon the beard; Even Aaron's beard, That cometh down upon the collar of his garments;

### passuk 3
Like the dew of Hermon, That cometh down upon the mountains of Zion; For there the LORD commanded the blessing, Even life for ever.
