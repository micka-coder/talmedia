### passuk 1
Michtam of David. Keep me, O God; for I have taken refuge in Thee.

### passuk 2
I have said unto the LORD: 'Thou art my Lord; I have no good but in Thee';

### passuk 3
As for the holy that are in the earth, They are the excellent in whom is all my delight.

### passuk 4
Let the idols of them be multiplied that make suit unto another; Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, Nor take their names upon my lips.

### passuk 5
O LORD, the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup, Thou maintainest my lot.

### passuk 6
The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; Yea, I have a goodly heritage.

### passuk 7
I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel; Yea, in the night seasons my reins instruct me.

### passuk 8
I have set the LORD always before me; Surely He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

### passuk 9
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also dwelleth in safety;

### passuk 10
For Thou wilt not abandon my soul to the nether-world; Neither wilt Thou suffer Thy godly one to see the pit.

### passuk 11
Thou makest me to know the path of life; In Thy presence is fulness of joy, In Thy right hand bliss for evermore.
