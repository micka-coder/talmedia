### passuk 1
Why standest Thou afar off, O LORD? Why hidest Thou Thyself in times of trouble?

### passuk 2
Through the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued, They are taken in the devices that they have imagined.

### passuk 3
For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, And the covetous vaunteth himself, though he contemn the LORD.

### passuk 4
The wicked, in the pride of his countenance [, saith]: 'He will not require'; All his thoughts are: 'There is no God.'

### passuk 5
His ways prosper at all times; Thy judgments are far above out of his sight; As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.

### passuk 6
He saith in his heart: 'I shall not be moved, I who to all generations shall not be in adversity.'

### passuk 7
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression; Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.

### passuk 8
He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; In secret places doth he slay the innocent; His eyes are on the watch for the helpless.

### passuk 9
He lieth in wait in a secret place as a lion in his lair, He lieth in wait to catch the poor; He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him up in his net.

### passuk 10
He croucheth, he boweth down, And the helpless fall into his mighty claws.

### passuk 11
He hath said in his heart: 'God hath forgotten; He hideth His face; He will never see.'

### passuk 12
Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up Thy hand; Forget not the humble.

### passuk 13
Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God, And say in his heart: 'Thou wilt not require'?

### passuk 14
Thou hast seen; for Thou beholdest trouble and vexation, to requite them with Thy hand; Unto Thee the helpless committeth himself; Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.

### passuk 15
Break Thou the arm of the wicked; And as for the evil man, search out his wickedness, till none be found.

### passuk 16
The LORD is King for ever and ever; The nations are perished out of His land.

### passuk 17
LORD, Thou hast heard the desire of the humble: Thou wilt direct their heart, Thou wilt cause Thine ear to attend;

### passuk 18
To right the fatherless and the oppressed, That man who is of the earth may be terrible no more.
