For the Leader; [a Psalm] of the sons of Korah. Maschil.

### passuk 2
O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us; a work Thou didst in their days, in the days of old.

### passuk 3
Thou with Thy hand didst drive out the nations, and didst plant them in; Thou didst break the peoples, and didst spread them abroad.

### passuk 4
For not by their own sword did they get the land in possession, Neither did their own arm save them; but Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the light of Thy countenance, because Thou wast favourable unto them.

### passuk 5
Thou art my King, O God; command the salvation of Jacob.

### passuk 6
Through Thee do we push down our adversaries; through Thy name do we tread them under that rise up against us.

### passuk 7
For I trust not in my bow, neither can my sword save me.

### passuk 8
But Thou hast saved us from our adversaries, and hast put them to shame that hate us.

### passuk 9
In God have we gloried all the day, and we will give thanks unto Thy name for ever. Selah

### passuk 10
Yet Thou hast cast off, and brought us to confusion; and goest not forth with our hosts.

### passuk 11
Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary; and they that hate us spoil at their will.

### passuk 12
Thou hast given us like sheep to be eaten; and hast scattered us among the nations.

### passuk 13
Thou sellest Thy people for small gain, and hast not set their prices high.

### passuk 14
Thou makest us a taunt to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.

### passuk 15
Thou makest us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.

### passuk 16
All the day is my confusion before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,

### passuk 17
For the voice of him that taunteth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and the revengeful.

### passuk 18
All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten Thee, neither have we been false to Thy covenant.

### passuk 19
Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from Thy path;

### passuk 20
Though Thou hast crushed us into a place of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death.

### passuk 21
If we had forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth our hands to a strange god; .

### passuk 22
Would not God search this out? For He knoweth the secrets of the heart.

### passuk 23
Nay, but for Thy sake are we killed all the day; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

### passuk 24
Awake, why sleepest Thou, O Lord? Arouse Thyself, cast not off for ever.

### passuk 25
Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?

### passuk 26
For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly cleaveth unto the earth.

### passuk 27
Arise for our help, and redeem us for Thy mercy's sake.
