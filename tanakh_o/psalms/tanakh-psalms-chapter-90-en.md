### passuk 1
A Prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling-place in all generations.

### passuk 2
Before the mountains were brought forth, Or ever Thou hadst formed the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, Thou art God.

### passuk 3
Thou turnest man to contrition; And sayest: 'Return, ye children of men.'

### passuk 4
For a thousand years in Thy sight Are but as yesterday when it is past, And as a watch in the night.

### passuk 5
Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep; In the morning they are like grass which groweth up.

### passuk 6
In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.

### passuk 7
For we are consumed in Thine anger, And by Thy wrath are we hurried away.

### passuk 8
Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee, Our secret sins in the light of Thy countenance.

### passuk 9
For all our days are passed away in Thy wrath; We bring our years to an end as a tale that is told.

### passuk 10
The days of our years are threescore years and ten, Or even by reason of strength fourscore years; Yet is their pride but travail and vanity; For it is speedily gone, and we fly away.

### passuk 11
Who knoweth the power of Thine anger, And Thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto Thee?

### passuk 12
So teach us to number our days, That we may get us a heart of wisdom.

### passuk 13
Return, O LORD; how long? And let it repent Thee concerning Thy servants.

### passuk 14
O satisfy us in the morning with Thy mercy; That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.

### passuk 15
Make us glad according to the days wherein Thou hast afflicted us, According to the years wherein we have seen evil.

### passuk 16
Let Thy work appear unto Thy servants, And Thy glory upon their children.

### passuk 17
And let the graciousness of the Lord our God be upon us; Establish Thou also upon us the work of our hands; Yea, the work of our hands establish Thou it.
