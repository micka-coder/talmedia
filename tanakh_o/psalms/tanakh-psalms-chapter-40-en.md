For the Leader. A Psalm of David.

### passuk 2
I waited patiently for the LORD; and He inclined unto me, and heard my cry.

### passuk 3
He brought me up also out of the tumultuous pit, out of the miry clay; and He set my feet upon a rock, He established my goings.

### passuk 4
And He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God; many shall see, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.

### passuk 5
Happy is the man that hath made the LORD his trust, and hath not turned unto the arrogant, nor unto such as fall away treacherously.

### passuk 6
Many things hast Thou done, O LORD my God, even Thy wonderful works, and Thy thoughts toward us; there is none to be compared unto Thee! If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be told.

### passuk 7
Sacrifice and meal-offering Thou hast no delight in; mine ears hast Thou opened; burnt-offering and sin-offering hast Thou not required.

### passuk 8
Then said I: 'Lo, I am come with the roll of a book which is prescribed for me;

### passuk 9
I delight to do Thy will, O my God; yea, Thy law is in my inmost parts.'

### passuk 10
I have preached righteousness in the great congregation, Lo, I did not refrain my lips; O LORD, Thou knowest.

### passuk 11
I have not hid Thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared Thy faithfulness and Thy salvation; I have not concealed Thy mercy and Thy truth from the great congregation.

### passuk 12
Thou, O LORD, wilt not withhold Thy compassions from me; let Thy mercy and Thy truth continually preserve me.

### passuk 13
For innumerable evils have compassed me about, mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me.

### passuk 14
Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; O LORD, make haste to help me.

### passuk 15
Let them be ashamed and abashed together that seek after my soul to sweep it away; let them be turned backward and brought to confusion that delight in my hurt.

### passuk 16
Let them be appalled by reason of their shame that say unto me: 'Aha, aha.'

### passuk 17
Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee; let such as love Thy salvation say continually: 'The LORD be magnified.'

### passuk 18
But, as for me, that am poor and needy, the Lord will account it unto me; Thou art my help and my deliverer; O my God, tarry not.
