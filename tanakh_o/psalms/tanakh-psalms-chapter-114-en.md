### passuk 1
When Israel came forth out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language;

### passuk 2
Judah became His sanctuary, Israel His dominion.

### passuk 3
The sea saw it, and fled; The Jordan turned backward.

### passuk 4
The mountains skipped like rams, The hills like young sheep.

### passuk 5
What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? Thou Jordan, that thou turnest backward?

### passuk 6
Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams; Ye hills, like young sheep?

### passuk 7
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob;

### passuk 8
Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of waters.
