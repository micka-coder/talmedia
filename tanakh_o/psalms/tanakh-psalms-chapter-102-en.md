### passuk 1
A Prayer of the afflicted, when he fainteth, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD. 

### passuk 2
O LORD, hear my prayer, and let my cry come unto Thee.

### passuk 3
Hide not Thy face from me in the day of my distress; incline Thine ear unto me; in the day when I call answer me speedily.

### passuk 4
For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as a hearth.

### passuk 5
My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; for I forget to eat my bread.

### passuk 6
By reason of the voice of my sighing My bones cleave to my flesh.

### passuk 7
I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places.

### passuk 8
I watch, and am become like a sparrow that is alone upon the housetop.

### passuk 9
Mine enemies taunt me all the day; they that are mad against me do curse by me.

### passuk 10
For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,

### passuk 11
Because of Thine indignation and Thy wrath; for Thou hast taken me up, and cast me away.

### passuk 12
My days are like a lengthening shadow; and I am withered like grass.

### passuk 13
But Thou, O LORD, sittest enthroned for ever; and Thy name is unto all generations.

### passuk 14
Thou wilt arise, and have compassion upon Zion; for it is time to be gracious unto her, for the appointed time is come.

### passuk 15
For Thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and love her dust.

### passuk 16
So the nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth Thy glory;

### passuk 17
When the LORD hath built up Zion, when He hath appeared in His glory;

### passuk 18
When He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, And hath not despised their prayer.

### passuk 19
This shall be written for the generation to come; And a people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.

### passuk 20
For He hath looked down from the height of His sanctuary; From heaven did the LORD behold the earth;

### passuk 21
To hear the groaning of the prisoner; To loose those that are appointed to death;

### passuk 22
That men may tell of the name of the LORD in Zion, And His praise in Jerusalem; .

### passuk 23
When the peoples are gathered together, And the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.

### passuk 24
He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days.

### passuk 25
I say: 'O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days, Thou whose years endure throughout all generations.

### passuk 26
Of old Thou didst lay the foundation of the earth; And the heavens are the work of Thy hands.

### passuk 27
They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure; Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; As a vesture shalt Thou change them, and they shall pass away;

### passuk 28
But Thou art the selfsame, And Thy years shall have no end.

### passuk 29
The children of Thy servants shall dwell securely, And their seed shall be established before Thee.'
