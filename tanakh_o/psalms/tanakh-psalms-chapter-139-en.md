For the Leader. A Psalm of David. O LORD, Thou hast searched me, and known me. .

### passuk 2
Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, Thou understandest my thought afar off.

### passuk 3
Thou measurest my going about and my lying down, And art acquainted with all my ways.

### passuk 4
For there is not a word in my tongue, But, lo, O LORD, Thou knowest it altogether.

### passuk 5
Thou hast hemmed me in behind and before, And laid Thy hand upon me.

### passuk 6
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; Too high, I cannot attain unto it.

### passuk 7
Whither shall I go from Thy spirit? Or whither shall I flee from Thy presence?

### passuk 8
If I ascend up into heaven, Thou art there; If I make my bed in the nether-world, behold, Thou art there.

### passuk 9
If I take the wings of the morning, And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;

### passuk 10
Even there would Thy hand lead me, And Thy right hand would hold me.

### passuk 11
And if I say: ‘Surely the darkness shall envelop me, And the light about me shall be night';

### passuk 12
Even the darkness is not too dark for Thee, But the night shineth as the day; The darkness is even as the light.

### passuk 13
For Thou hast made my reins; Thou hast knit me together in my mother's womb.

### passuk 14
I will give thanks unto Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Wonderful are Thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.

### passuk 15
My frame was not hidden from Thee, When I was made in secret, And curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.

### passuk 16
Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance, And in Thy book they were all written— Even the days that were fashioned, When as yet there was none of them.

### passuk 17
How weighty also are Thy thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them!

### passuk 18
If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand; Were I to come to the end of them, I would still be with Thee.

### passuk 19
If Thou but wouldest slay the wicked, O God— Depart from me therefore, ye men of blood;

### passuk 20
Who utter Thy name with wicked thought, They take it for falsehood, even Thine enemies— .

### passuk 21
Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate Thee? And do not I strive with those that rise up against Thee?

### passuk 22
I hate them with utmost hatred; I count them mine enemies.

### passuk 23
Search me, O God, and know my heart, Try me, and know my thoughts;

### passuk 24
And see if there be any way in me that is grievous, And lead me in the way everlasting.
