For the Leader; upon Shoshannim. [A Psalm] of David.

### passuk 2
Save me, O God; For the waters are come in even unto the soul.

### passuk 3
I am sunk in deep mire, where there is no standing; I am come into deep waters, and the flood overwhelmeth me.

### passuk 4
I am weary of my crying; my throat is dried; Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.

### passuk 5
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are many; Should I restore that which I took not away?

### passuk 6
O God, Thou knowest my folly; And my trespasses are not hid from Thee.

### passuk 7
Let not them that wait for Thee be ashamed through me, O Lord GOD of hosts; Let not those that seek Thee be brought to confusion through me, O God of Israel.

### passuk 8
Because for Thy sake I have borne reproach; Confusion hath covered my face.

### passuk 9
I am become a stranger unto my brethren, And an alien unto my mother's children.

### passuk 10
Because zeal for Thy house hath eaten me up, And the reproaches of them that reproach Thee are fallen upon me.

### passuk 11
And I wept with my soul with fasting, And that became unto me a reproach.

### passuk 12
I made sackcloth also my garment, And I became a byword unto them.

### passuk 13
They that sit in the gate talk of me; And I am the song of the drunkards. .

### passuk 14
But as for me, let my prayer be unto Thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time; O God, in the abundance of Thy mercy, Answer me with the truth of Thy salvation.

### passuk 15
Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink; Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

### passuk 16
Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, Neither let the deep swallow me up; And let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.

### passuk 17
Answer me, O LORD, for Thy mercy is good; According to the multitude of Thy compassions turn Thou unto me.

### passuk 18
And hide not Thy face from Thy servant; For I am in distress; answer me speedily.

### passuk 19
Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it; Ransom me because of mine enemies.

### passuk 20
Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my confusion; Mine adversaries are all before Thee.

### passuk 21
Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am sore sick; And I looked for some to show compassion, but there was none; And for comforters, but I found none.

### passuk 22
Yea, they put poison into my food; And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

### passuk 23
Let their table before them become a snare; And when they are in peace, let it become a trap.

### passuk 24
Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; And make their loins continually to totter.

### passuk 25
Pour out Thine indignation upon them, And let the fierceness of Thine anger overtake them.

### passuk 26
Let their encampment be desolate; Let none dwell in their tents.

### passuk 27
For they persecute him whom Thou hast smitten; And they tell of the pain of those whom Thou hast wounded.

### passuk 28
Add iniquity unto their iniquity; And let them not come into Thy righteousness.

### passuk 29
Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, And not be written with the righteous.

### passuk 30
But I am afflicted and in pain; Let Thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.

### passuk 31
I will praise the name of God with a song, And will magnify Him with thanksgiving. .

### passuk 32
And it shall please the LORD better than a bullock That hath horns and hoofs.

### passuk 33
The humble shall see it, and be glad; Ye that seek after God, let your heart revive.

### passuk 34
For the LORD hearkeneth unto the needy, And despiseth not His prisoners.

### passuk 35
Let heaven and earth praise Him, The seas, and every thing that moveth therein.

### passuk 36
For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; And they shall abide there, and have it in possession.

### passuk 37
The seed also of His servants shall inherit it; And they that love His name shall dwell therein.
