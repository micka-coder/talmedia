### passuk 1
A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.

### passuk 2
O God, Thou art my God, earnestly will I seek Thee; My soul thirsteth for Thee, my flesh longeth for Thee, In a dry and weary land, where no water is.

### passuk 3
So have I looked for Thee in the sanctuary, To see Thy power and Thy glory. .

### passuk 4
For Thy lovingkindness is better than life; My lips shall praise Thee.

### passuk 5
So will I bless Thee as long as I live; In Thy name will I lift up my hands.

### passuk 6
My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness; And my mouth doth praise Thee with joyful lips;

### passuk 7
When I remember Thee upon my couch, And meditate on Thee in the night-watches.

### passuk 8
For Thou hast been my help, And in the shadow of Thy wings do I rejoice.

### passuk 9
My soul cleaveth unto Thee; Thy right hand holdeth me fast.

### passuk 10
But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, Shall go into the nethermost parts of the earth.

### passuk 11
They shall be hurled to the power of the sword; They shall be a portion for foxes.

### passuk 12
But the king shall rejoice in God; Every one that sweareth by Him shall glory; For the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
