[A Psalm] of David. The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

### passuk 2
When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh, Even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.

### passuk 3
Though a host should encamp against me, My heart shall not fear; Though war should rise up against me, Even then will I be confident.

### passuk 4
One thing have I asked of the LORD, that will I seek after: That I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, To behold the graciousness of the LORD, and to visit early in His temple.

### passuk 5
For He concealeth me in His pavilion in the day of evil; He hideth me in the covert of His tent; He lifteth me up upon a rock. .

### passuk 6
And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; And I will offer in His tabernacle sacrifices with trumpet-sound; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.

### passuk 7
Hear, O LORD, when I call with my voice, And be gracious unto me, and answer me.

### passuk 8
In Thy behalf my heart hath said: ‘Seek ye My face'; Thy face, LORD, will I seek.

### passuk 9
Hide not Thy face far from me; Put not Thy servant away in anger; Thou hast been my help; Cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.

### passuk 10
For though my father and my mother have forsaken me, The LORD will take me up.

### passuk 11
Teach me Thy way, O LORD; And lead me in an even path, Because of them that lie in wait for me.

### passuk 12
Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries; For false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out violence.

### passuk 13
If I had not believed to look upon the goodness of the LORD In the land of the living!—

### passuk 14
Wait on the LORD; Be strong, and let thy heart take courage; Yea, wait thou for the LORD.
