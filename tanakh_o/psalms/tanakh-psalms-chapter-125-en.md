### passuk 1
A Song of Ascents. They that trust in the LORD Are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever.

### passuk 2
As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, So the LORD is round about His people, From this time forth and for ever.

### passuk 3
For the rod of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; That the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity.

### passuk 4
Do good, O LORD, unto the good, And to them that are upright in their hearts.

### passuk 5
But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, The LORD will lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.
