### passuk 1
HAPPY IS the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked, Nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of the scornful.

### passuk 2
But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in His law doth he meditate day and night.

### passuk 3
And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf doth not wither; and in whatsoever he doeth he shall prosper.

### passuk 4
Not so the wicked; but they are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.

### passuk 5
Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

### passuk 6
For the LORD regardeth the way of the righteous; but the way of the wicked shall perish.
