### passuk 1
O give thanks unto the LORD, call upon His name; Make known His doings among the peoples.

### passuk 2
Sing unto Him, sing praises unto Him; Speak ye of all His marvellous works.

### passuk 3
Glory ye in His holy name; Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.

### passuk 4
Seek ye the LORD and His strength; Seek His face continually.

### passuk 5
Remember His marvellous works that He hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth;

### passuk 6
O ye seed of Abraham His servant, Ye children of Jacob, His chosen ones.

### passuk 7
He is the LORD our God; His judgments are in all the earth.

### passuk 8
He hath remembered His covenant for ever, The word which He commanded to a thousand generations;

### passuk 9
[The covenant] which He made with Abraham, And His oath unto Isaac;

### passuk 10
And He established it unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant;

### passuk 11
Saying: 'Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance.'

### passuk 12
When they were but a few men in number. Yea, very few, and sojourners in it,

### passuk 13
And when they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people,

### passuk 14
He suffered no man to do them wrong, Yea, for their sake He reproved kings:

### passuk 15
'Touch not Mine anointed ones, And do My prophets no harm.'

### passuk 16
And He called a famine upon the land; He broke the whole staff of bread.

### passuk 17
He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant;

### passuk 18
His feet they hurt with fetters, His person was laid in iron;

### passuk 19
Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of the LORD tested him.

### passuk 20
The king sent and loosed him; Even the ruler of the peoples, and set him free.

### passuk 21
He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his possessions;

### passuk 22
To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom.

### passuk 23
Israel also came into Egypt; And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

### passuk 24
And He increased His people greatly, And made them too mighty for their adversaries.

### passuk 25
He turned their heart to hate His people, To deal craftily with His servants.

### passuk 26
He sent Moses His servant, And Aaron whom He had chosen.

### passuk 27
They wrought among them His manifold signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.

### passuk 28
He sent darkness, and it was dark; And they rebelled not against His word.

### passuk 29
He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish.

### passuk 30
Their land swarmed with frogs, In the chambers of their kings.

### passuk 31
He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, And gnats in all their borders.

### passuk 32
He gave them hail for rain, And flaming fire in their land.

### passuk 33
He smote their vines also and their fig-trees; And broke the trees of their borders.

### passuk 34
He spoke, and the locust came, And the canker-worm without number,

### passuk 35
And did eat up every herb in their land, And did eat up the fruit of their ground.

### passuk 36
He smote also all the first-born in their land, The first-fruits of all their strength.

### passuk 37
And He brought them forth with silver and gold; And there was none that stumbled among His tribes.

### passuk 38
Egypt was glad when they departed; For the fear of them had fallen upon them.

### passuk 39
He spread a cloud for a screen; And fire to give light in the night.

### passuk 40
They asked, and He brought quails, And gave them in plenty the bread of heaven.

### passuk 41
He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; They ran, a river in the dry places.

### passuk 42
For He remembered His holy word Unto Abraham His servant;

### passuk 43
And He brought forth His people with joy, His chosen ones with singing.

### passuk 44
And He gave them the lands of the nations, And they took the labour of the peoples in possession;

### passuk 45
That they might keep His statutes, And observe His laws. Hallelujah.
