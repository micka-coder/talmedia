### passuk 1
[A Psalm] of David. Strive, O LORD, with them that strive with me; Fight against them that fight against me.

### passuk 2
Take hold of shield and buckler, And rise up to my help.

### passuk 3
Draw out also the spear, and the battle-axe, against them that pursue me; Say unto my soul: 'I am Thy salvation.'

### passuk 4
Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion that seek after my soul; Let them be turned back and be abashed that devise my hurt.

### passuk 5
Let them be as chaff before the wind, The angel of the LORD thrusting them.

### passuk 6
Let their way be dark and slippery, The angel of the LORD pursuing them.

### passuk 7
For without cause have they hid for me the pit, even their net, Without cause have they digged for my soul. .

### passuk 8
Let destruction come upon him unawares; And let his net that he hath hid catch himself; With destruction let him fall therein.

### passuk 9
And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD; It shall rejoice in His salvation.

### passuk 10
All my bones shall say: 'LORD, who is like unto Thee, Who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, Yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?'

### passuk 11
Unrighteous witnesses rise up; They ask me of things that I know not.

### passuk 12
They repay me evil for good; Bereavement is come to my soul.

### passuk 13
But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth, I afflicted my soul with fasting; And my prayer, may it return into mine own bosom.

### passuk 14
I went about as though it had been my friend or my brother; I bowed down mournful, as one that mourneth for his mother.

### passuk 15
But when I halt they rejoice, and gather themselves together; The abjects gather themselves together against me, and those whom I know not; They tear me, and cease not;

### passuk 16
With the profanest mockeries of backbiting They gnash at me with their teeth.

### passuk 17
Lord, how long wilt Thou look on? Rescue my soul from their destructions, Mine only one from the lions.

### passuk 18
I will give Thee thanks in the great congregation; I will praise Thee among a numerous people.

### passuk 19
Let not them that are wrongfully mine enemies rejoice over me; Neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.

### passuk 20
For they speak not peace; But they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.

### passuk 21
Yea, they open their mouth wide against me; They say: 'Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.'

### passuk 22
Thou hast seen, O LORD; keep not silence; O Lord, be not far from me.

### passuk 23
Rouse Thee, and awake to my judgment, Even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.

### passuk 24
Judge me, O LORD my God, according to Thy righteousness; And let them not rejoice over me.

### passuk 25
Let them not say in their heart: 'Aha, we have our desire'; Let them not say: 'We have swallowed him up.'

### passuk 26
Let them be ashamed and abashed together that rejoice at my hurt; Let them be clothed with shame and confusion that magnify themselves against me. .

### passuk 27
Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that delight in my righteousness; Yea, let them say continually: 'Magnified be the LORD, Who delighteth in the peace of His servant.'

### passuk 28
And my tongue shall speak of Thy righteousness, And of Thy praise all the day.
