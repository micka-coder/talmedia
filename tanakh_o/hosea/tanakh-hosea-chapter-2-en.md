### passuk 1
Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass that, instead of that which was said unto them: ‘Ye are not My people’, it shall be said unto them: ‘Ye are the children of the living God.’

### passuk 2
And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall appoint themselves one head, and shall go up out of the land; for great shall be the day of Jezreel.

### passuk 3
Say ye unto your brethren: ‘Ammi’; and to your sisters, ‘Ruhamah.’

### passuk 4
Plead with your mother, plead; For she is not My wife, neither am I her husband; And let her put away her harlotries from her face, And her adulteries from between her breasts;

### passuk 5
Lest I strip her naked, And set her as in the day that she was born, And make her as a wilderness, And set her like a dry land, And slay her with thirst.

### passuk 6
And I will not have compassion upon her children; For they are children of harlotry.

### passuk 7
For their mother hath played the harlot, She that conceived them hath done shamefully; For she said: ‘I will go after my lovers, That give me my bread and my water, My wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.’

### passuk 8
Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, And I will make a wall against her, That she shall not find her paths.

### passuk 9
And she shall run after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them, And she shall seek them, but shall not find them; Then shall she say: ‘I will go and return to my first husband; For then was it better with me than now.’

### passuk 10
For she did not know that it was I that gave her The corn, and the wine, and the oil, And multiplied unto her silver and gold, Which they used for Baal.

### passuk 11
Therefore will I take back My corn in the time thereof, And My wine in the season thereof, And will snatch away My wool and My flax Given to cover her nakedness.

### passuk 12
And now will I uncover her shame in the sight of her lovers, And none shall deliver her out of My hand.

### passuk 13
I will also cause all her mirth to cease, Her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, And all her appointed seasons.

### passuk 14
And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, Whereof she hath said: ‘These are my hire That my lovers have given me’; And I will make them a forest, And the beasts of the field shall eat them.

### passuk 15
And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, Wherein she offered unto them, And decked herself with her ear-rings and her jewels, And went after her lovers, And forgot Me, saith the LORD.

### passuk 16
Therefore, behold, I will allure her, And bring her into the wilderness, And speak tenderly unto her.

### passuk 17
And I will give her her vineyards from thence, And the valley of Achor for a door of hope; And she shall respond there, as in the days of her youth, And as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.

### passuk 18
And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, That thou shalt call Me Ishi, And shalt call Me no more Baali.

### passuk 19
For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, And they shall no more be mentioned by their name.

### passuk 20
And in that day will I make a covenant for them With the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, And with the creeping things of the ground; And I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, And will make them to lie down safely.

### passuk 21
And I will betroth thee unto Me for ever; Yea, I will betroth thee unto Me in righteousness, and in justice, And in lovingkindness, and in compassion.

### passuk 22
And I will betroth thee unto Me in faithfulness; And thou shalt know the LORD.

### passuk 23
And it shall come to pass in that day, I will respond, saith the LORD, I will respond to the heavens, And they shall respond to the earth;

### passuk 24
And the earth shall respond to the corn, and the wine, and the oil; And they shall respond to Jezreel.

### passuk 25
And I will sow her unto Me in the land; And I will have compassion upon her that had not obtained compassion; And I will say to them that were not My people: ‘Thou art My people’; And they shall say: ‘Thou art my God.’
