### passuk 1
And the LORD prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.

### passuk 2
Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish’s belly.

### passuk 3
And he said: I called out of mine affliction Unto the LORD, and He answered me; Out of the belly of the nether-world cried I, And Thou heardest my voice.

### passuk 4
For Thou didst cast me into the depth, In the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me; All Thy waves and Thy billows Passed over me.

### passuk 5
And I said: ‘I am cast out From before Thine eyes’; Yet I will look again Toward Thy holy temple.

### passuk 6
The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; The deep was round about me; The weeds were wrapped about my head.

### passuk 7
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; The earth with her bars closed upon me for ever; Yet hast Thou brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God.

### passuk 8
When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the LORD; And my prayer came in unto Thee, Into Thy holy temple.

### passuk 9
They that regard lying vanities Forsake their own mercy.

### passuk 10
But I will sacrifice unto Thee With the voice of thanksgiving; That which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is of the LORD.

### passuk 11
And the LORD spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
