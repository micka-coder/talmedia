### passuk 1
I am the man that hath seen affliction By the rod of His wrath.

### passuk 2
He hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness and not in light.

### passuk 3
Surely against me He turneth His hand again and again all the day.

### passuk 4
My flesh and my skin hath He worn out; He hath broken my bones.

### passuk 5
He hath builded against me, and compassed me With gall and travail.

### passuk 6
He hath made me to dwell in dark places, As those that have been long dead. .

### passuk 7
He hath hedged me about, that I cannot go forth; He hath made my chain heavy.

### passuk 8
Yea, when I cry and call for help, He shutteth out my prayer.

### passuk 9
He hath enclosed my ways with hewn stone, He hath made my paths crooked.

### passuk 10
He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, As a lion in secret places.

### passuk 11
He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; He hath made me desolate.

### passuk 12
He hath bent His bow, and set me As a mark for the arrow.

### passuk 13
He hath caused the arrows of His quiver To enter into my reins.

### passuk 14
I am become a derision to all my people, And their song all the day.

### passuk 15
He hath filled me with bitterness, He hath sated me with wormwood.

### passuk 16
He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, He hath made me to wallow in ashes.

### passuk 17
And my soul is removed far off from peace, I forgot prosperity.

### passuk 18
And I said: ‘My strength is perished, And mine expectation from the LORD.’

### passuk 19
Remember mine affliction and mine anguish, The wormwood and the gall.

### passuk 20
My soul hath them still in remembrance, And is bowed down within me.

### passuk 21
This I recall to my mind, Therefore have I hope.

### passuk 22
Surely the LORD’S mercies are not consumed, Surely His compassions fail not.

### passuk 23
They are new every morning; Great is Thy faithfulness.

### passuk 24
’The LORD is my portion’, saith my soul; ‘Therefore will I hope in Him.’

### passuk 25
The LORD is good unto them that wait for Him, To the soul that seeketh Him.

### passuk 26
It is good that a man should quietly wait For the salvation of the LORD.

### passuk 27
It is good for a man that he bear The yoke in his youth.

### passuk 28
Let him sit alone and keep silence, Because He hath laid it upon him.

### passuk 29
Let him put his mouth in the dust, If so be there may be hope.

### passuk 30
Let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him Let him be filled full with reproach.

### passuk 31
For the Lord will not cast off For ever.

### passuk 32
For though He cause grief, yet will He have compassion According to the multitude of His mercies.

### passuk 33
For He doth not afflict willingly, Nor grieve the children of men.

### passuk 34
To crush under foot All the prisoners of the earth,

### passuk 35
To turn aside the right of a man Before the face of the Most High,

### passuk 36
To subvert a man in his cause, The Lord approveth not.

### passuk 37
Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, When the Lord commandeth it not?

### passuk 38
Out of the mouth of the Most High proceedeth not Evil and good?

### passuk 39
Wherefore doth a living man complain, A strong man because of his sins?

### passuk 40
Let us search and try our ways, And return to the LORD.

### passuk 41
Let us lift up our heart with our hands Unto God in the heavens.

### passuk 42
We have transgressed and have rebelled; Thou hast not pardoned.

### passuk 43
Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us; Thou hast slain unsparingly.

### passuk 44
Thou hast covered Thyself with a cloud, So that no prayer can pass through.

### passuk 45
Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse In the midst of the peoples.

### passuk 46
All our enemies have opened their mouth Wide against us.

### passuk 47
Terror and the pit are come upon us, Desolation and destruction.

### passuk 48
Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water, For the breach of the daughter of my people.

### passuk 49
Mine eye is poured out, and ceaseth not, Without any intermission,

### passuk 50
Till the LORD look forth, And behold from heaven.

### passuk 51
Mine eye affected my soul, Because of all the daughters of my city.

### passuk 52
They have chased me sore like a bird, That are mine enemies without cause.

### passuk 53
They have cut off my life in the dungeon, And have cast stones upon me.

### passuk 54
Waters flowed over my head; I said: ‘I am cut off.’

### passuk 55
I called upon Thy name, O LORD, Out of the lowest dungeon.

### passuk 56
Thou heardest my voice; hide not Thine ear at my sighing, at my cry.

### passuk 57
Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon Thee; Thou saidst: ‘Fear not.’ .

### passuk 58
O Lord, Thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; Thou hast redeemed my life.

### passuk 59
O LORD, Thou hast seen my wrong; Judge Thou my cause.

### passuk 60
Thou hast seen all their vengeance And all their devices against me.

### passuk 61
Thou hast heard their taunt, O LORD, And all their devices against me;

### passuk 62
The lips of those that rose up against me, And their muttering against me all the day.

### passuk 63
Behold Thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.

### passuk 64
Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O LORD, According to the work of their hands.

### passuk 65
Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, Thy curse unto them.

### passuk 66
Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them From under the heavens of the LORD.
