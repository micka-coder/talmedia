### passuk 1
Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us; Behold, and see our reproach.

### passuk 2
Our inheritance is turned unto strangers, Our houses unto aliens.

### passuk 3
We are become orphans and fatherless, Our mothers are as widows.

### passuk 4
We have drunk our water for money; Our wood cometh to us for price.

### passuk 5
To our very necks we are pursued; We labour, and have no rest.

### passuk 6
We have given the hand to Egypt, And to Assyria, to have bread enough;

### passuk 7
Our fathers have sinned, and are not; And we have borne their iniquities.

### passuk 8
Servants rule over us; There is none to deliver us out of their hand.

### passuk 9
We get our bread with the peril of our lives Because of the sword of the wilderness.

### passuk 10
Our skin is hot like an oven Because of the burning heat of famine.

### passuk 11
They have ravished the women in Zion, The maidens in the cities of Judah.

### passuk 12
Princes are hanged up by their hand; The faces of elders are not honoured.

### passuk 13
The young men have borne the mill, And the children have stumbled under the wood.

### passuk 14
The elders have ceased from the gate, The young men from their music.

### passuk 15
The joy of our heart is ceased; Our dance is turned into mourning.

### passuk 16
The crown is fallen from our head; Woe unto us! for we have sinned.

### passuk 17
For this our heart is faint, For these things our eyes are dim;

### passuk 18
For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, The foxes walk upon it.

### passuk 19
Thou, O LORD, art enthroned for ever, Thy throne is from generation to generation.

### passuk 20
Wherefore dost Thou forget us for ever, And forsake us so long time?

### passuk 21
Turn Thou us unto Thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; Renew our days as of old.

### passuk 22
Thou canst not have utterly rejected us, And be exceeding wroth against us!<br><small>[Turn us unto Thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned; Renew our days as of old.]</small>
