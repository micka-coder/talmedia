### passuk 1
And David spoke unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul;

### passuk 2
and he said: The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;

### passuk 3
The God who is my rock, in Him I take refuge; My shield, and my horn of salvation, my high tower, and my refuge; My saviour, Thou savest me from violence.

### passuk 4
Praised, I cry, is the LORD, and I am saved from mine enemies.

### passuk 5
For the waves of Death compassed me. The floods of Belial assailed me.

### passuk 6
The cords of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of Death confronted me.

### passuk 7
In my distress I called upon the LORD, yea, I called unto my God; and out of His temple He heard my voice, and my cry did enter into His ears.

### passuk 8
Then the earth did shake and quake, the foundations of heaven did tremble; they were shaken, because He was wroth.

### passuk 9
Smoke arose up in His nostrils, and fire out of His mouth did devour; coals flamed forth from Him.

### passuk 10
He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and thick darkness was under His feet.

### passuk 11
And He rode upon a cherub, and did fly; Yea, He was seen upon the wings of the wind.

### passuk 12
And He made darkness pavilions round about Him, gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.

### passuk 13
At the brightness before Him coals of fire flamed forth.

### passuk 14
The LORD thundered from heaven, and the Most High gave forth His voice.

### passuk 15
And He sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.

### passuk 16
And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of His nostrils.

### passuk 17
He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters;

### passuk 18
He delivered me from mine enemy most strong, from them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me.

### passuk 19
They confronted me in the day of my calamity; but the LORD was a stay unto me.

### passuk 20
He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because He delighted in me.

### passuk 21
The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands hath He recompensed me.

### passuk 22
For I have kept the ways of the LORD, And have not wickedly departed from my God.

### passuk 23
For all His ordinances were before me; And as for His statutes, I did not depart from them.

### passuk 24
And I was single-hearted toward Him, And I kept myself from mine iniquity.

### passuk 25
Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in His eyes.

### passuk 26
With the merciful Thou dost show Thyself merciful, With the upright man Thou dost show Thyself upright,

### passuk 27
With the pure Thou dost show Thyself pure; And with the crooked Thou dost show Thyself subtle.

### passuk 28
And the afflicted people Thou dost save; But Thine eyes are upon the haughty, that Thou mayest humble them.

### passuk 29
For Thou art my lamp, O LORD; And the LORD doth lighten my darkness.

### passuk 30
For by Thee I run upon a troop; By my God do I scale a wall.

### passuk 31
As for God, His way is perfect; The word of the LORD is tried; He is a shield unto all them that take refuge in Him.

### passuk 32
For who is God, save the LORD? And who is a Rock, save our God?

### passuk 33
The God who is my strong fortress, And who letteth my way go forth straight;

### passuk 34
Who maketh my feet like hindsâ€™, And setteth me upon my high places;

### passuk 35
Who traineth my hands for war, So that mine arms do bend a bow of brass.

### passuk 36
Thou hast also given me Thy shield of salvation; And Thy condescension hath made me great.

### passuk 37
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, And my feet have not slipped.

### passuk 38
I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; Neither did I turn back till they were consumed.

### passuk 39
And I have consumed them, and smitten them through, that they cannot arise; Yea, they are fallen under my feet.

### passuk 40
For Thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle; Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.

### passuk 41
Thou hast also made mine enemies turn their backs unto me; Yea, them that hate me, that I might cut them off.

### passuk 42
They looked, but there was none to save; Even unto the LORD, but He answered them not.

### passuk 43
Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the streets, and did tread them down.

### passuk 44
Thou also hast delivered me from the contentions of my people; Thou hast kept me to be the head of the nations; A people whom I have not known serve me.

### passuk 45
The sons of the stranger dwindle away before me; As soon as they hear of me, they obey me.

### passuk 46
The sons of the stranger fade away, And come halting out of their close places.

### passuk 47
The LORD liveth, and blessed be my Rock; And exalted be the God, my Rock of salvation; .

### passuk 48
Even the God that executeth vengeance for me, And bringeth down peoples under me,

### passuk 49
And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies; Yea, Thou liftest me up above them that rise up against me; Thou deliverest me from the violent man.

### passuk 50
Therefore I will give thanks unto Thee, O LORD, among the nations, And will sing praises unto Thy name.

### passuk 51
A tower of salvation is He to His king; And showeth mercy to His anointed, To David and to his seed, for evermore.
