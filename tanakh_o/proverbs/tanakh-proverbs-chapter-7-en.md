### passuk 1
My son, keep my words, And lay up my commandments with thee.

### passuk 2
Keep my commandments and live, And my teaching as the apple of thine eye.

### passuk 3
Bind them upon thy fingers, Write them upon the table of thy heart.

### passuk 4
Say unto wisdom: ‘Thou art my sister’, And call understanding thy kinswoman;

### passuk 5
That they may keep thee from the strange woman, From the alien woman that maketh smooth her words.

### passuk 6
For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice;

### passuk 7
And I beheld among the thoughtless ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding,

### passuk 8
Passing through the street near her corner, And he went the way to her house;

### passuk 9
In the twilight, in the evening of the day, In the blackness of night and the darkness.

### passuk 10
And, behold, there met him a woman With the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart.

### passuk 11
She is riotous and rebellious, Her feet abide not in her house;

### passuk 12
Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, And lieth in wait at every corner.

### passuk 13
So she caught him, and kissed him, And with an impudent face she said unto him:

### passuk 14
’Sacrifices of peace-offerings were due from me; This day have I paid my vows.

### passuk 15
Therefore came I forth to meet thee, To seek thy face, and I have found thee.

### passuk 16
I have decked my couch with coverlets, With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.

### passuk 17
I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

### passuk 18
Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; Let us solace ourselves with loves.

### passuk 19
For my husband is not at home, He is gone a long journey;

### passuk 20
He hath taken the bag of money with him; He will come home at the full moon.’

### passuk 21
With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield, With the blandishment of her lips she enticeth him away.

### passuk 22
He goeth after her straightway, As an ox that goeth to the slaughter, Or as one in fetters to the correction of the fool;

### passuk 23
Till an arrow strike through his liver; As a bird hasteneth to the snare— And knoweth not that it is at the cost of his life.

### passuk 24
Now therefore, O ye children, hearken unto me, And attend to the words of my mouth.

### passuk 25
Let not thy heart decline to her ways, Go not astray in her paths.

### passuk 26
For she hath cast down many wounded; Yea, a mighty host are all her slain.

### passuk 27
Her house is the way to the nether-world, Going down to the chambers of death.
