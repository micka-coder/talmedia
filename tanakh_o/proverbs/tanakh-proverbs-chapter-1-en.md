### passuk 1
The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;

### passuk 2
To know wisdom and instruction; To comprehend the words of understanding;

### passuk 3
To receive the discipline of wisdom, Justice, and right, and equity;

### passuk 4
To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion;

### passuk 5
That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning, And the man of understanding may attain unto wise counsels;

### passuk 6
To understand a proverb, and a figure; The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.

### passuk 7
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; But the foolish despise wisdom and discipline.

### passuk 8
Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, And forsake not the teaching of thy mother;

### passuk 9
For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, And chains about thy neck.

### passuk 10
My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not.

### passuk 11
If they say: ‘Come with us, Let us lie in wait for blood, Let us lurk for the innocent without cause;

### passuk 12
Let us swallow them up alive as the grave, and whole, as those that go down into the pit;

### passuk 13
We shall find all precious substance, We shall fill our houses with spoil;

### passuk 14
Cast in thy lot among us; Let us all have one purse’—

### passuk 15
My son, walk not thou in the way with them, restrain thy foot from their path;

### passuk 16
For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.

### passuk 17
For in vain the net is spread in the eyes of any bird;

### passuk 18
And these lie in wait for their own blood, they lurk for their own lives.

### passuk 19
So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; it taketh away the life of the owners thereof.

### passuk 20
Wisdom crieth aloud in the streets, she uttereth her voice in the broad places;

### passuk 21
She calleth at the head of the noisy streets, at the entrances of the gates, in the city, she uttereth her words:

### passuk 22
’How long, ye thoughtless, will ye love thoughtlessness? And how long will scorners delight them in scorning, And fools hate knowledge?

### passuk 23
Turn you at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.

### passuk 24
Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man attended,

### passuk 25
But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof;

### passuk 26
I also, in your calamity, will laugh, I will mock when your dread cometh;

### passuk 27
When your dread cometh as a storm, and your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; When trouble and distress come upon you.

### passuk 28
Then will they call me, but I will not answer, they will seek me earnestly, but they shall not find me.

### passuk 29
For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD;

### passuk 30
They would none of my counsel, they despised all my reproof.

### passuk 31
Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.

### passuk 32
For the waywardness of the thoughtless shall slay them, and the confidence of fools shall destroy them.

### passuk 33
But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, and shall be quiet without fear of evil.’
