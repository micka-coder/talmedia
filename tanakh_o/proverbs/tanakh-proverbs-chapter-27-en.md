### passuk 1
Boast not thyself of to- morrow; For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.

### passuk 2
Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; A stranger, and not thine own lips.

### passuk 3
A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; But a fool’s vexation is heavier than they both.

### passuk 4
Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming; But who is able to stand before jealousy?

### passuk 5
Better is open rebuke Than love that is hidden.

### passuk 6
Faithful are the wounds of a friend; But the kisses of an enemy are importunate.

### passuk 7
The full soul loatheth a honeycomb; But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.

### passuk 8
As a bird that wandereth from her nest, So is a man that wandereth from his place.

### passuk 9
Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart; So doth the sweetness of a man’s friend by hearty counsel.

### passuk 10
Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not; Neither go into thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity; Better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.

### passuk 11
My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, That I may answer him that taunteth me.

### passuk 12
A prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself; But the thoughtless pass on, and are punished.

### passuk 13
Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge that is surety for an alien woman.

### passuk 14
He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, It shall be counted a curse to him.

### passuk 15
A continual dropping in a very rainy day And a contentious woman are alike;

### passuk 16
He that would hide her hideth the wind, And the ointment of his right hand betrayeth itself.

### passuk 17
Iron sharpeneth iron; So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.

### passuk 18
Whoso keepeth the fig-tree shall eat the fruit thereof; And he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.

### passuk 19
As in water face answereth to face, So the heart of man to man.

### passuk 20
The nether-world and Destruction are never satiated; So the eyes of man are never satiated.

### passuk 21
The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold, And a man is tried by his praise.

### passuk 22
Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle among groats, Yet will not his foolishness depart from him.

### passuk 23
Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, And look well to thy herds;

### passuk 24
For riches are not for ever; And doth the crown endure unto all generations?

### passuk 25
When the hay is mown, and the tender grass showeth itself, And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in;

### passuk 26
The lambs will be for thy clothing, And the goats the price for a field. .

### passuk 27
And there will be goats’milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household; And maintenance for thy maidens.
