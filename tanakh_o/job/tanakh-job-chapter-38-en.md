### passuk 1
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:

### passuk 2
Who is this that darkeneth counsel By words without knowledge?

### passuk 3
Gird up now thy loins like a man; For I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto Me.

### passuk 4
Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast the understanding.

### passuk 5
Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who stretched the line upon it?

### passuk 6
Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner-stone thereof,

### passuk 7
When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy?

### passuk 8
Or who shut up the sea with doors, When it broke forth, and issued out of the womb;

### passuk 9
When I made the cloud the garment thereof, And thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,

### passuk 10
And prescribed for it My decree, And set bars and doors,

### passuk 11
And said: ‘Thus far shalt thou come, but no further; And here shall thy proud waves be stayed’?

### passuk 12
Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days began, And caused the dayspring to know its place;

### passuk 13
That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it?

### passuk 14
It is changed as clay under the seal; And they stand as a garment.

### passuk 15
But from the wicked their light is withholden, And the high arm is broken.

### passuk 16
Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? Or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep? .

### passuk 17
Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee? Or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?

### passuk 18
Hast thou surveyed unto the breadths of the earth? Declare, if thou knowest it all.

### passuk 19
Where is the way to the dwelling of light, And as for darkness, where is the place thereof;

### passuk 20
That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, And that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?

### passuk 21
Thou knowest it, for thou wast then born, And the number of thy days is great!

### passuk 22
Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow, Or hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail,

### passuk 23
Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, Against the day of battle and war?

### passuk 24
By what way is the light parted, Or the east wind scattered upon the earth?

### passuk 25
Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood, Or a way for the lightning of the thunder;

### passuk 26
To cause it to rain on a land where no man is, On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;

### passuk 27
To satisfy the desolate and waste ground, And to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?

### passuk 28
Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?

### passuk 29
Out of whose womb came the ice? And the hoar-frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?

### passuk 30
The waters are congealed like stone, And the face of the deep is frozen.

### passuk 31
Canst thou bind the chains of the Pleiades, Or loose the bands of Orion?

### passuk 32
Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? Or canst thou guide the Bear with her sons?

### passuk 33
Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? Canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?

### passuk 34
Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, That abundance of waters may cover thee?

### passuk 35
Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go, And say unto thee: ‘Here we are’?

### passuk 36
Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who hath given understanding to the mind?

### passuk 37
Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,

### passuk 38
When the dust runneth into a mass, And the clods cleave fast together?

### passuk 39
Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lioness? Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,

### passuk 40
When they couch in their dens, And abide in the covert to lie in wait?

### passuk 41
Who provideth for the raven his prey, When his young ones cry unto God, and wander for lack of food?
