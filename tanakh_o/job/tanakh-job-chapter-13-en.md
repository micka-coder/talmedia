### passuk 1
Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, Mine ear hath heard and  understood it.

### passuk 2
What ye know, do I know also; I am not inferior unto you.

### passuk 3
Notwithstanding I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to reason with God.

### passuk 4
But ye are plasterers of lies, Ye are all physicians of no value.

### passuk 5
Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! And it would be your wisdom.

### passuk 6
Hear now my reasoning, And hearken to the pleadings of my lips.

### passuk 7
Will ye speak unrighteously for God, And talk deceitfully for Him?

### passuk 8
Will ye show Him favour? Will ye contend for God?

### passuk 9
Would it be good that He should search you out? Or as one mocketh a man, will ye mock Him?

### passuk 10
He will surely reprove you, If ye do secretly show favour.

### passuk 11
Shall not His majesty terrify you, And His dread fall upon you?

### passuk 12
Your memorials shall be like unto ashes, Your eminences to eminences of clay.

### passuk 13
Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, And let come on me what will.

### passuk 14
Wherefore? I will take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hand.

### passuk 15
Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him; But I will argue my ways before Him.

### passuk 16
This also shall be my salvation, That a hypocrite cannot come before Him.

### passuk 17
Hear diligently my speech, And let my declaration be in your ears.

### passuk 18
Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.

### passuk 19
Who is he that will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and die.

### passuk 20
Only do not two things unto me, Then will I not hide myself from Thee:

### passuk 21
Withdraw Thy hand far from me; And let not Thy terror make me afraid.

### passuk 22
Then call Thou, and I will answer; Or let me speak, and answer Thou me.

### passuk 23
How many are mine iniquities and sins? Make me to know my transgression and my sin.

### passuk 24
Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face, And holdest me for Thine enemy?

### passuk 25
Wilt Thou harass a driven leaf? And wilt Thou pursue the dry stubble?

### passuk 26
That Thou shouldest write bitter things against me, And make me to inherit the iniquities of my youth.

### passuk 27
Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, And lookest narrowly unto all my paths; Thou drawest Thee a line about the soles of my feet;

### passuk 28
Though I am like a wine-skin that consumeth, Like a garment that is moth-eaten.
