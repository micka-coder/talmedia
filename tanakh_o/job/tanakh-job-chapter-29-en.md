### passuk 1
And Job again took up his parable, and said:

### passuk 2
Oh that I were as in the months of old, As in the days when God watched over me;

### passuk 3
When His lamp shined above my head, And by His light I walked through darkness;

### passuk 4
As I was in the days of my youth, When the converse of God was upon my tent;

### passuk 5
When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were about me;

### passuk 6
When my steps were washed with butter, And the rock poured me out rivers of oil!

### passuk 7
When I went forth to the gate unto the city, When I prepared my seat in the broad place,

### passuk 8
The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the aged rose up and stood;

### passuk 9
The princes refrained talking, And laid their hand on their mouth;

### passuk 10
The voice of the nobles was hushed, And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.

### passuk 11
For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me, And when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me;

### passuk 12
Because I delivered the poor that cried, The fatherless also, that had none to help him.

### passuk 13
The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.

### passuk 14
I put on righteousness, and it clothed itself with me; My justice was as a robe and a diadem.

### passuk 15
I was eyes to the blind, And feet was I to the lame.

### passuk 16
I was a father to the needy; And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.

### passuk 17
And I broke the jaws of the unrighteous, And plucked the prey out of his teeth.

### passuk 18
Then I said: ‘I shall die with my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the phoenix;

### passuk 19
My root shall be spread out to the waters, And the dew shall lie all night upon my branch;

### passuk 20
My glory shall be fresh in me, And my bow shall be renewed in my hand.’

### passuk 21
Unto me men gave ear, and waited, And kept silence for my counsel.

### passuk 22
After my words they spoke not again; And my speech dropped upon them.

### passuk 23
And they waited for me as for the rain; And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.

### passuk 24
If I laughed on them, they believed it not; And the light of my countenance they cast not down.

### passuk 25
I chose out their way, and sat as chief, And dwelt as a king in the army, As one that comforteth the mourners.
