### passuk 1
Then Job answered and said:

### passuk 2
Hear diligently my speech; And let this be your consolations.

### passuk 3
Suffer me, that I may speak; And after that I have spoken, mock on.

### passuk 4
As for me, is my complaint to man? Or why should I not be impatient?

### passuk 5
Turn unto me, and be astonished, And lay your hand upon your mouth.

### passuk 6
Even when I remember I am affrighted, And horror hath taketh hold on my flesh.

### passuk 7
Wherefore do the wicked live, Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?

### passuk 8
Their seed is established in their sight with them, And their offspring before their eyes.

### passuk 9
Their houses are safe, without fear, Neither is the rod of God upon them.

### passuk 10
Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.

### passuk 11
They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance.

### passuk 12
They sing to the timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.

### passuk 13
They spend their days in prosperity, And peacefully they go down to the grave.

### passuk 14
Yet they said unto God: ‘Depart from us; For we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways.

### passuk 15
What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto Him?’—

### passuk 16
Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand; The counsel of the wicked is far from me.

### passuk 17
How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity cometh upon them? That He distributeth pains in His anger?

### passuk 18
That they are as stubble before the wind, And as chaff that the storm stealeth away?

### passuk 19
’God layeth up his iniquity for his children! ’— Let Him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it.

### passuk 20
Let his own eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.

### passuk 21
For what pleasure hath he in his house after him? Seeing the number of his months is determined.

### passuk 22
Shall any teach God knowledge? Seeing it is He that judgeth those that are high.

### passuk 23
One dieth in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and quiet;

### passuk 24
His pails are full of milk, And the marrow of his bones is moistened.

### passuk 25
And another dieth in bitterness of soul, And hath never tasted of good.

### passuk 26
They lie down alike in the dust, And the worm covereth them.

### passuk 27
Behold, I know your thoughts, And the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.

### passuk 28
For ye say: ‘Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?’

### passuk 29
Have ye not asked them that go by the way; And will ye misdeem their tokens,

### passuk 30
That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity, That they are led forth to the day of wrath?

### passuk 31
But who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he hath done?

### passuk 32
For he is borne to the grave, And watch is kept over his tomb.

### passuk 33
The clods of the valley are sweet unto him, And all men draw after him, As there were innumerable before him.

### passuk 34
How then comfort ye me in vain? And as for your answers, there remaineth only faithlessness?
