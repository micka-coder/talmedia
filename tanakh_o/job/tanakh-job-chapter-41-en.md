### passuk 1
Behold, the hope of him is in vain; Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?

### passuk 2
None is so fierce that dare stir him up; Who then is able to stand before Me?

### passuk 3
Who hath given Me anything beforehand, that I should repay him? Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is Mine.

### passuk 4
Would I keep silence concerning his boastings, or his proud talk, or his fair array of words?

### passuk 5
Who can uncover the face of his garment? Who shall come within his double bridle?

### passuk 6
Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror.

### passuk 7
His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.

### passuk 8
One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.

### passuk 9
They are joined one to another; They stick together, that they cannot be sundered.

### passuk 10
His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.

### passuk 11
Out of his mouth go burning torches, and sparks of fire leap forth.

### passuk 12
Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot and burning rushes.

### passuk 13
His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.

### passuk 14
In his neck abideth strength, and dismay danceth before him.

### passuk 15
The flakes of his flesh are joined together; they are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.

### passuk 16
His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, firm as the nether millstone.

### passuk 17
When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid; by reason of despair they are beside themselves.

### passuk 18
If one lay at him with the sword, it will not hold; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.

### passuk 19
He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.

### passuk 20
The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones are turned with him into stubble.

### passuk 21
Clubs are accounted as stubble; He laugheth at the rattling of the javelin.

### passuk 22
Sharpest potsherds are under him; He spreadeth a threshing-sledge upon the mire.

### passuk 23
He maketh the deep to boil like a pot; He maketh the sea like a seething mixture.

### passuk 24
He maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be hoary.

### passuk 25
Upon earth there is not his like who is made to be fearless.

### passuk 26
He looketh at all high things; He is king over all the proud beasts.
