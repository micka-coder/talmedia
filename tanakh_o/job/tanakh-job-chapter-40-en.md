### passuk 1
Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said:

### passuk 2
Shall he that reproveth contend with the Almighty? He that argueth with God, let him answer it.

### passuk 3
Then Job answered the LORD, and said:

### passuk 4
Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer Thee? I lay my hand upon my mouth.

### passuk 5
Once have I spoken, but I will not answer again; Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.

### passuk 6
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:

### passuk 7
Gird up thy loins now like a man; I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto Me. .

### passuk 8
Wilt thou even make void My judgment? Wilt thou condemn Me, that thou mayest be justified?

### passuk 9
Or hast thou an arm like God? And canst thou thunder with a voice like Him?

### passuk 10
Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency, And array thyself with glory and beauty.

### passuk 11
Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath; And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him.

### passuk 12
Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; And tread down the wicked in their place.

### passuk 13
Hide them in the dust together; Bind their faces in the hidden place.

### passuk 14
Then will I also confess unto thee That thine own right hand can save thee.

### passuk 15
Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; He eateth grass as an ox.

### passuk 16
Lo now, his strength is in his loins, And his force is in the stays of his body.

### passuk 17
He straineth his tail like a cedar; The sinews of his thighs are knit together.

### passuk 18
His bones are as pipes of brass; His gristles are like bars of iron.

### passuk 19
He is the beginning of the ways of God; He only that made him can make His sword to approach unto him.

### passuk 20
Surely the mountains bring him forth food, And all the beasts of the field play there.

### passuk 21
He lieth under the lotus-trees, In the covert of the reed, and fens.

### passuk 22
The lotus-trees cover him with their shadow; The willows of the brook compass him about.

### passuk 23
Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not; He is confident, though the Jordan rush forth to his mouth.

### passuk 24
Shall any take him by his eyes, Or pierce through his nose with a snare?

### passuk 25
Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fish-hook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?

### passuk 26
Canst thou put a ring into his nose? Or bore his jaw through with a hook?

### passuk 27
Will he make many supplications unto thee? Or will he speak soft words unto thee?

### passuk 28
Will he make a covenant with thee, That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?

### passuk 29
Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? .

### passuk 30
Will the bands of fishermen make a banquet of him? Will they part him among the merchants?

### passuk 31
Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? Or his head with fish-spears?

### passuk 32
Lay thy hand upon him; Think upon the battle, thou wilt do so no more.
