### passuk 1
Blow ye the horn in Zion, And sound an alarm in My holy mountain; Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; For the day of the LORD cometh, For it is at hand;

### passuk 2
A day of darkness and gloominess, A day of clouds and thick darkness, As blackness spread upon the mountains; A great people and a mighty, There hath not been ever the like, Neither shall be any more after them, Even to the years of many generations.

### passuk 3
A fire devoureth before them, And behind them a flame blazeth; The land is as the garden of Eden before them, And behind them a desolate wilderness; Yea, and nothing escapeth them.

### passuk 4
The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; And as horsemen, so do they run.

### passuk 5
Like the noise of chariots, On the tops of the mountains do they leap, Like the noise of a flame of fire That devoureth the stubble, As a mighty people set in battle array.

### passuk 6
At their presence the peoples are in anguish; All faces have gathered blackness.

### passuk 7
They run like mighty men, They climb the wall like men of war; And they move on every one in his ways, And they entangle not their paths.

### passuk 8
Neither doth one thrust another, They march every one in his highway; And they break through the weapons, And suffer no harm.

### passuk 9
They leap upon the city, They run upon the wall, They climb up into the houses; They enter in at the windows like a thief.

### passuk 10
Before them the earth quaketh, The heavens tremble; The sun and the moon are become black, And the stars withdraw their shining.

### passuk 11
And the LORD uttereth His voice before His army; For His camp is very great, For he is mighty that executeth His word; For great is the day of the LORD and very terrible; And who can abide it?

### passuk 12
Yet even now, saith the LORD, Turn ye unto Me with all your heart, And with fasting, and with weeping, and with lamentation;

### passuk 13
And rend your heart, and not your garments, And turn unto the LORD your God; For He is gracious and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy, And repenteth Him of the evil.

### passuk 14
Who knoweth whether He will not turn and repent, And leave a blessing behind Him, Even a meal-offering and a drink-offering Unto the LORD your God?

### passuk 15
Blow the horn in Zion, Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;

### passuk 16
Gather the people, Sanctify the congregation, Assemble the elders, Gather the children, And those that suck the breasts; Let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, And the bride out of her pavilion.

### passuk 17
Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, Weep between the porch and the altar, And let them say: ‘Spare thy people, O LORD, And give not Thy heritage to reproach, That the nations should make them a byword: Wherefore should they say among the peoples: Where is their God?’

### passuk 18
Then was the LORD jealous for His land, And had pity on His people.

### passuk 19
And the LORD answered and said unto His people: ‘Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, And ye shall be satisfied therewith; And I will no more make you a reproach among the nations;

### passuk 20
But I will remove far off from you the northern one, And will drive him into a land barren and desolate, With his face toward the eastern sea, And his hinder part toward the western sea; that his foulness may come up, and his ill savour may come up, because he hath done great things.’

### passuk 21
Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for the LORD hath done great things.

### passuk 22
Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.

### passuk 23
Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God; For He giveth you the former rain in just measure, And He causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, at the first.

### passuk 24
And the floors shall be full of corn, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.

### passuk 25
And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpiller, and the palmer-worm, My great army which I sent among you. .

### passuk 26
And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and My people shall never be ashamed.

### passuk 27
And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and there is none else; and My people shall never be ashamed.
