### passuk 1
And it shall come to pass afterward, That I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh; And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, Your old men shall dream dreams, Your young men shall see visions;

### passuk 2
And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids In those days will I pour out My spirit.

### passuk 3
And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, Blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.

### passuk 4
The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.

### passuk 5
And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered; For in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, As the LORD hath said, And among the remnant those whom the LORD shall call.
