### passuk 1
Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men;

### passuk 2
and they rose up in face of Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty men; they were princes of the congregation, the elect men of the assembly, men of renown;

### passuk 3
and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them: ‘Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them; wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?’

### passuk 4
And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face.

### passuk 5
And he spoke unto Korah and unto all his company, saying: ‘In the morning the LORD will show who are His, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near unto Him; even him whom He may choose will He cause to come near unto Him. .

### passuk 6
This do: take you censers, Korah, and all his company;

### passuk 7
and put fire therein, and put incense upon them before the LORD to-morrow; and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy; ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.’

### passuk 8
And Moses said unto Korah: ‘Hear now, ye sons of Levi:

### passuk 9
is it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them;

### passuk 10
and that He hath brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee? and will ye seek the priesthood also?

### passuk 11
Therefore thou and all thy company that are gathered together against the LORD—; and as to Aaron, what is he that ye murmur against him?’

### passuk 12
And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said: ‘We will not come up;

### passuk 13
is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us?

### passuk 14
Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards; wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.’

### passuk 15
And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD: ‘Respect not thou their offering; I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.’

### passuk 16
And Moses said unto Korah: ‘Be thou and all thy congregation before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow;

### passuk 17
and take ye every man his fire-pan, and put incense upon them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his fire-pan, two hundred and fifty fire-pans; thou also, and Aaron, each his fire-pan.’

### passuk 18
And they took every man his fire-pan, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.

### passuk 19
And Korah assembled all the congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting; and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.

### passuk 20
And the LORD spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying:

### passuk 21
’Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.’

### passuk 22
And they fell upon their faces, and said: ‘O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt Thou be wroth with all the congregation?’

### passuk 23
And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:

### passuk 24
’Speak unto the congregation, saying: Get you up from about the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’

### passuk 25
And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.

### passuk 26
And he spoke unto the congregation, saying: ‘Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be swept away in all their sins.’

### passuk 27
So they got them up from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side; and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, with their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.

### passuk 28
And Moses said: ‘Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works, and that I have not done them of mine own mind.

### passuk 29
If these men die the common death of all men, and be visited after the visitation of all men, then the LORD hath not sent Me.

### passuk 30
But if the LORD make a new thing, and the ground open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down alive into the pit, then ye shall understand that these men have despised the LORD.’

### passuk 31
And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground did cleave asunder that was under them.

### passuk 32
And the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.

### passuk 33
So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit; and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly.

### passuk 34
And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them; for they said: ‘Lest the earth swallow us up.’

### passuk 35
And fire came forth from the LORD, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense.
