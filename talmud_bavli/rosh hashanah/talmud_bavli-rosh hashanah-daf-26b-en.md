### Part 1
<b>So-and-so <i>keva’a</i> from me.</b> Levi <b>did not understand what</b> that man <b>was saying to him,</b> as he did not know the meaning of the word <i>kava</i>. So <b>he went</b> and <b>asked in the study hall. They said to him:</b> That man <b>said to you: He robbed me, as it is written: “Will a man rob [<i>hayikba</i>] God?”</b> (Malachi 3:8). <b>Rava from</b> a place called <b>Barnish said to Rav Ashi: Had I been there</b> in Levi’s place I would have tried to uncover the meaning of the word in a different way, for <b>I would have said to him: How did he <i>keva’a</i> you? With what did he <i>keva’a</i> you? And why did he <i>keva’a</i> you? And</b> from his answers <b>I would have understood on my own</b> what was being said. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> Levi, who did not do this, <b>thought</b> that the man <b>was talking about a matter of prohibition</b> and not a monetary matter, and so asking the man these questions would not have helped, as they are relevant only to monetary matters.

### Part 2
The Gemara continues its discussion of unusual words: <b>The Sages did not know the meaning of</b> the word <b><i>seirugin</i>,</b> which is found in a mishna. One day <b>they heard the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house say to the Sages whom she saw entering</b> the house not all at once, but <b>intermittently: How long shall you enter <i>seirugin seirugin</i>?</b> and from this they understood that the word <i>seirugin</i> means: At intervals.

### Part 3
It is similarly recounted that <b>the Sages did not know the meaning</b> of the word <b><i>ḥaloglogot</i>,</b> which is mentioned in various <i>mishnayot</i> and <i>baraitot</i>. <b>One day they heard the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house say to a certain man whom she saw scattering his purslane</b> plants: <b>How long shall you scatter your <i>ḥaloglogot</i>?</b> So they understood that <i>ḥaloglogot</i> means purslane.

### Part 4
<b>The Sages also did not know the meaning</b> of the word <i>salseleha</i> in the verse: <b>“<i>Salseleha</i> and it will exalt you”</b> (Proverbs 4:8). <b>One day they heard the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house say to a certain man who was curling his hair: How long shall you <i>mesalsel</i> your hair?</b> And from this they understood that the verse means: Turn wisdom about, and it will exalt you.

### Part 5
It is further related that <b>the Sages did not know the meaning</b> of the words in the verse: <b>“And sweep it [<i>vetetetiha</i>] with the broom [<i>matatei</i>] of destruction”</b> (Isaiah 14:23). <b>One day they heard the maidservant in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>house saying to her workmate: Take a broom [<i>tateita</i>] and sweep</b> [<b><i>ta’ati</i></b>] <b>the house,”</b> and they understood the meaning of these words.

### Part 6
<b>The Sages</b> also <b>did not know the meaning</b> of the word <i>yehavkha</i> in the verse: <b>“Cast your load [<i>yehavkha</i>] upon the Lord and He will sustain you”</b> (Psalms 55:23). <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: One day I was traveling with a certain Arab [<i>Tayya’a</i>],</b> and <b>I was carrying a load, and he said to me: Take your <i>yehav</i> and cast it on my camel,</b> and from this I understood that <i>yehav</i> means a load.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The <i>shofar</i></b> that was used <b>on Rosh HaShana</b> in the Temple was made from the <b>straight</b> horn <b>of an ibex, and its mouth,</b> the mouthpiece into which one blows, <b>was plated with gold. And</b> there were <b>two trumpets,</b> one <b>on</b> each of <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> of the person sounding the <i>shofar</i>. <b>The <i>shofar</i> would sound a long</b> blast, <b>whereas the trumpets would sound a short</b> blast, <b>because the mitzva of the day is with the <i>shofar</i>.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And</b> in contrast, the <i>shofarot</i> used <b>on</b> public <b>fast days</b> were made from <b>the curved</b> horns <b>of rams, and their mouths were plated with silver.</b> There were <b>two trumpets in the middle</b> between the <i>shofarot</i>, and <b>the <i>shofar</i> would sound a short blast, whereas the trumpets would sound a long</b> blast, <b>for the mitzva of the day is with the trumpets.</b>

### Part 9
Yom Kippur of <b>the Jubilee Year is the same as Rosh HaShana with regard to</b> both <b>the</b> <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts</b> that are sounded <b>and the</b> additional <b>blessings</b> that are recited in the <i>Amida</i> prayer. <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> There is a difference between the two days: <b>On Rosh HaShana one blows with</b> horns <b>of rams, whereas in Jubilee Years</b> one blows <b>with</b> horns <b>of ibexes.</b>

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Levi said: The mitzva of Rosh HaShana and of Yom Kippur</b> of the Jubilee Year is to blow <b>with curved</b> <i>shofarot</i>, <b>and</b> that <b>of the rest of the year,</b> on fast days, is to blow <b>with straight</b> <i>shofarot</i>. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> differently in the mishna: <b>The <i>shofar</i></b> that was used <b>on Rosh HaShana</b> was made from the <b>straight</b> horn <b>of an ibex?</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Levi <b>said</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: On Rosh HaShana they would blow with the curved</b> horns <b>of rams, and on</b> the Days of Atonement of <b>the Jubilee Years with</b> the horns <b>of ibexes.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let</b> it simply <b>say</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Why was it necessary to quote the <i>baraita</i> in full, as if it provided new information? The Gemara explains: <b>If you had said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, I would have said</b> that <b>he,</b> Rabbi Levi, <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda even with regard to</b> the <i>shofar</i> used <b>in the Jubilee Year,</b> i.e., that one must blow with the horn of ibexes at that time. Therefore, the Gemara <b>teaches us</b> that he agrees with Rabbi Yehuda only with regard to Rosh HaShana, and not with regard to any other matter.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do these <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree? One Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>on Rosh HaShana the more a person bends his mind</b> and humbles himself by bending in prayer, <b>the better.</b> Therefore, a curved <i>shofar</i> is sounded as an allusion to our bent minds and bodies. <b>But on Yom Kippur, the more a person straightens his mind</b> and prays with simplicity, <b>the better.</b> Therefore, a straight <i>shofar</i> is sounded. <b>The other Sage,</b> the anonymous <i>tanna</i> of the mishna, <b>maintains</b> the opposite: <b>On Rosh HaShana, the more a person straightens his mind</b> and avoids any crookedness, <b>the better. On fasts,</b> on the other hand, <b>the more a person bends his mind</b> and humbles himself, <b>the better.</b>
