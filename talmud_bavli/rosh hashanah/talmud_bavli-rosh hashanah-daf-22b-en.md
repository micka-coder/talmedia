### Part 1
<b>but is one</b> witness <b>deemed credible? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident in</b> which one potential witness <b>came</b> to testify, <b>and his witnesses</b> were <b>with him,</b> as they came <b>to testify about him?</b> The use of the plural indicates that two witnesses are required to establish someone as a valid eyewitness. <b>Rav Pappa said: What is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>Another?</b> It means <b>another pair</b> of witnesses.

### Part 2
The Gemara comments: <b>This too stands to reason, for if you do not say so,</b> then the opening statement of the mishna: <b>If</b> the members of the Great Sanhedrin <b>are not familiar with that</b> one, is problematic. <b>What is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>That</b> one? <b>If we say</b> it is referring to <b>that one</b> witness, <b>is one</b> witness <b>deemed credible?</b> The word: <b>Judgment, is written with regard to</b> the establishment of the New Moon and Rosh HaShana: “For it is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the God of Israel” (Psalms 81:5), and judgments require two witnesses. <b>Rather, what is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>That</b> one? <b>That pair</b> of witnesses. <b>So too</b> here, <b>what is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>Another? Another pair</b> of witnesses.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And is one</b> witness <b>not deemed credible</b> to testify about the eyewitness who saw the new moon? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Nehorai, who went with the witness to testify about him on Shabbat in Usha?</b> Apparently, Rabbi Nehorai offered his testimony alone.

### Part 4
The Sages <b>say</b> in explanation of this incident: In fact, two witnesses are necessary, and in the case of <b>Rabbi Nehorai there was another witness with him. And</b> the fact <b>that he was not mentioned is due to the honor of Rabbi Nehorai,</b> so as not to indicate that the other was his equal. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> In the incident involving <b>Rabbi Nehorai, there was</b> already <b>another witness</b> waiting <b>in Usha and Rabbi Nehorai went to join him.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this incident at all? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that in a case of <b>uncertainty one does not desecrate Shabbat,</b> i.e., perhaps the witness in Usha would not be present that day, which would mean that Rabbi Nehorai desecrated Shabbat for no reason. Therefore, the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches us</b> that for the important purpose of the New Moon, Shabbat may be desecrated even in a doubtful case.

### Part 6
§ <b>When Ulla came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: They sanctified the</b> New <b>Moon</b> on a certain date <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael. Although Ulla was the only witness, his testimony was accepted. <b>Rav Kahana said: It is not necessary to say</b> that <b>Ulla, who is a great man, is deemed credible</b> with regard to such testimony. <b>Rather, even an ordinary person is deemed credible</b> in this case, and there is no need for two witnesses. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? With regard to <b>any matter that is likely to be revealed, people do not lie about it.</b>The Gemara comments that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one</b> person <b>comes from the</b> other <b>end of the world and says: The court sanctified the</b> new <b>month, he is deemed credible.</b> There is no need for two witnesses.

### Part 7
The mishna taught: <b>Initially, they would accept testimony</b> to determine the start of the <b>month from any person,</b> and this continued until the Boethusians began to corrupt the process. <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that describes the decisive incident: <b>What</b> was the manner of <b>the corruption</b> in which <b>the Boethusians engaged? Once, the Boethusians tried to mislead the Sages</b> with regard to the day of the new moon. <b>They hired two people for four hundred dinars</b> to testify falsely that they had seen the new moon on the thirtieth day of the month. <b>One</b> of them was <b>from our own,</b> i.e., a member of the Pharisees and the Sages of Israel, <b>and</b> the other was <b>one of theirs.</b>

### Part 8
When they went in to testify, <b>their</b> witness <b>submitted his testimony</b> that he had seen the new moon, <b>and</b> then he <b>left.</b> When <b>our</b> witness came to testify, <b>they said to him,</b> in the customary manner: <b>Say how you saw the moon. He said to them: I was ascending in Ma’ale Adumim and I saw that</b> the new moon <b>was crouched between two rocks. Its head was like</b> that <b>of a calf, its ears were like</b> those <b>of a kid, its horns were like</b> those <b>of a deer, and its tail was lying between its thighs. And I looked at it and was frightened and I fell backward. And if you do not believe me</b> that this is what I saw, there are <b>two hundred dinars wrapped in my cloak</b> that were paid to me to deliver this testimony.

### Part 9
Realizing that the testimony of the first witness was also false, the Sages <b>said to him: Who persuaded you to</b> act in <b>this</b> manner? <b>He said to them: I heard that the Boethusians were seeking to mislead the Sages,</b> and <b>I said</b> to myself: <b>I will go</b> and hire myself out to give false testimony, <b>and I will inform</b> the Sages of the truth, <b>lest unworthy people come and mislead the Sages.</b>

### Part 10
The Sages <b>said to him: The two hundred dinars</b> that you received from the Boethusians <b>are given to you as a gift.</b> Although you did not carry out your mission, the court is authorized to declare the money ownerless and award it to you. <b>And the one who hired you shall be stretched out on the post</b> for flogging. <b>At that time</b> the Sages <b>instituted that they would accept</b> testimony about the new moon <b>only from those</b> men <b>who were familiar</b> to the Great Sanhedrin as qualified witnesses.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Initially,</b> after the court sanctified the new month <b>they would light torches</b> on the mountaintops, from one peak to another, to signal to the community in Babylonia that the month had been sanctified. <b>After the Samaritans [<i>Kutim</i>] corrupted</b> and ruined this method by lighting torches at the wrong times to confuse the Jews, the Sages <b>instituted that messengers should go out</b> to the Diaspora and inform them of the start of the month.

### Part 12
The mishna asks: <b>How would they light</b> the <b>torches</b> during that earlier period? <b>They would bring</b> items that burn well, e.g., <b>long poles of cedar, reeds, pinewood, and beaten flax, and tie</b> them together <b>with a string. And</b> someone would then <b>ascend to the top of the mountain and light</b> the torch <b>on fire with them, and wave it back and forth and up and down, until he would see his colleague doing likewise on the top of the second mountain.</b> In this manner he would know that the next messenger had received the message and passed it on. <b>And similarly,</b> the second torchbearer would wait for a signal from the one <b>on the top of the third mountain,</b> and so on. In this manner the message would reach the Diaspora.

### Part 13
<b>And from which</b> mountains <b>would they light the torches?</b> They would transmit the message <b>from the Mount of Olives</b> in Jerusalem <b>to Sartava, and from Sartava to Gerofina, and from Gerofina to Ḥavran, and from Ḥavran to Beit Baltin. And from Beit Baltin they would not move</b> to light torches in any other predetermined location. <b>Rather,</b> the one who was appointed for this task <b>would wave</b> the torch <b>back and forth and up and down, until he would see the entire Diaspora before him</b> alight <b>like</b> one large <b>bonfire,</b> as they would light torches to continue transmitting the message from place to place all the way to the farthest reaches of the Diaspora.

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that they would light torches [<i>masi’in</i>]. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that</b> the term <b><i>masi’in</i> is an expression of burning? As it is written: “<i>Vayisa’em</i> David and his men”</b> (II Samuel 5:21), <b>and we translate</b> the verse as: <b>And David</b> and his men <b>burned them.</b>

### Part 15
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Torches were lit only for</b> a new <b>month whose</b> moon <b>was seen at its</b> proper <b>time,</b> i.e., on the thirtieth day of the outgoing month, <b>to sanctify</b> the upcoming New Moon on that date and declare the previous month as containing twenty-nine days. In this case, the thirtieth day would be declared the first day of the following month. <b>And when would they light</b> the torches? It was <b>on the eve of its additional day,</b> the one that would have been added had it been a full, thirty-day month, i.e., on the eve of the thirty-first day of the outgoing month.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that for</b> the conclusion of <b>a deficient</b> month of twenty-nine days <b>one performs</b> the sequence of lighting torches, but <b>for a full</b> month <b>one does not perform</b> it? <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> This is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> that was instituted <b>due to</b> the case of <b>a New Moon</b> following <b>a deficient,</b> twenty-nine-day month <b>that occurs on Shabbat eve.</b> In that case, <b>when do they perform</b> the lighting? <b>At the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> as it is prohibited to light a fire on Friday night. The reason for the decree is <b>that if you say that one performs</b> the lighting of torches <b>for a full,</b> thirty-day month <b>as well,</b> people might <b>come</b>
