### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>They are four</b> days in the year that serve as the <b>New Year,</b> each for a different purpose: <b>On the first of Nisan is the New Year for kings;</b> it is from this date that the years of a king’s rule are counted. <b>And</b> the first of Nisan is also the New Year <b>for</b> the order of <b>the Festivals,</b> as it determines which is considered the first Festival of the year and which the last.

### Part 2
<b>On the first of Elul is the New Year for animal tithes;</b> all the animals born prior to that date belong to the previous tithe year and are tithed as a single unit, whereas those born after that date belong to the next tithe year. <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> The New Year for animal tithes is <b>on the first of Tishrei.</b>

### Part 3
<b>On the first of Tishrei is the New Year for</b> counting <b>years,</b> as will be explained in the Gemara; <b>for</b> calculating <b>Sabbatical Years and Jubilee Years,</b> i.e., from the first of Tishrei there is a biblical prohibition to work the land during these years; <b>for planting,</b> for determining the years of <i>orla</i>, the three-year period from when a tree has been planted during which time its fruit is forbidden; <b>and for</b> tithing <b>vegetables,</b> as vegetables picked prior to that date cannot be tithed together with vegetables picked after that date.

### Part 4
<b>On the first of Shevat is the New Year for the tree;</b> the fruit of a tree that was formed prior to that date belong to the previous tithe year and cannot be tithed together with fruit that was formed after that date; this ruling is <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai.</b> But <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> The New Year for trees is <b>on the fifteenth of</b> Shevat.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The New Year <b>for kings; with regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is it mentioned in the mishna? Why is it necessary to set a specific date to count the years of a king’s rule, rather than counting them from the day that he ascends to the throne? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is <b>for</b> determining the validity of <b>documents.</b>

### Part 6
It was the common practice to date documents in accordance with the years of the king’s rule; therefore, it was important that these years begin at a fixed time, so that one knows whether a particular document was antedated or postdated, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Antedated promissory notes,</b> i.e., promissory notes dated prior to the date on which the loan actually took place, <b>are invalid</b> because a loan document creates a lien on the borrower’s property. By dating the document earlier than the loan itself, the lender has a fraudulent mortgage on the property, which can be used against any future purchaser. Therefore, the Sages ordained that an antedated promissory note does not establish a lien, even from the true date of the loan. <b>But postdated</b> promissory notes bearing a date that is later than the date when the loan actually took place <b>are valid,</b> as postdating the note presents no opportunity for defrauding a purchaser.

### Part 7
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a king ascended</b> to the throne <b>on the twenty-ninth of Adar,</b> the month preceding Nisan, <b>once the first of Nisan arrives,</b> although he reigned for only one day, <b>a year is counted toward his</b> reign; his first year of rule is completed from the first of Nisan. <b>But if he ascended</b> to the throne <b>only on the first of Nisan,</b> one <b>counts</b> an additional <b>year toward his</b> reign <b>only</b> when <b>the next Nisan arrives.</b>

### Part 8
<b>The Master said,</b> citing the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a king ascended</b> to the throne <b>on the twenty-ninth of Adar, once the first of Nisan arrives a year is counted toward his</b> reign. The Gemara comments: <b>This</b>
