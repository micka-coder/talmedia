### Part 1
If the <i>shofar</i> <b>was punctured and</b> the puncture <b>was sealed, if it impedes the blowing,</b> the <i>shofar</i> is <b>unfit, but if not,</b> it is <b>fit.</b> If <b>one sounds</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>into a pit, or into a cistern, or into</b> a large <b>jug, if he</b> clearly <b>heard the sound of the <i>shofar</i>, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation; <b>but if he heard the sound of an echo, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation.

### Part 2
<b>And similarly,</b> if <b>one was passing behind a synagogue,or his house was adjacent to the synagogue, and he heard the sound of the <i>shofar</i> or the sound of the Scroll</b> of Esther being read, <b>if he focused his heart,</b> i.e. his intent, to fulfill his obligation, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation; <b>but if not, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. It is therefore possible for two people to hear the <i>shofar</i> blasts, but only one of them fulfills his obligation. <b>Even though this one heard and</b> also <b>the other one heard,</b> nevertheless, <b>this one focused his heart</b> to fulfill his obligation and has therefore indeed fulfilled it, <b>but the other one did not focus his heart,</b> and so he has not fulfilled his obligation.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a <i>shofar</i> was <b>long and it was shortened,</b> it <b>is</b> still <b>fit.</b> If it <b>was scraped</b> out, <b>so that</b> only <b>its outer layer remains,</b> it <b>is</b> also <b>fit.</b> If the <i>shofar</i> <b>was plated with gold at the place where one puts his mouth,</b> it is <b>unfit; if</b> it was plated <b>not at the place where he puts his mouth,</b> it is <b>fit.</b> If it <b>was plated with gold on the inside,</b> it is <b>unfit,</b> as one does not hear the sound of a <i>shofar</i> but the sound of a golden instrument. If, however, it was plated with gold <b>on the outside,</b> the following distinction applies: <b>If its sound changed from what it was</b> before the plating, it is <b>unfit, but if not,</b> the gold plating is mere ornamentation and <b>it is</b> therefore <b>fit.</b>

### Part 4
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If the <i>shofar</i> <b>was punctured and</b> the puncture was <b>sealed, if it impedes the blowing,</b> the <i>shofar</i> is <b>unfit, but if not,</b> it is <b>fit.</b> If <b>one placed</b> one <b><i>shofar</i> inside</b> another <b><i>shofar</i></b> and blew, <b>if he heard the sound of the inner</b> <i>shofar</i>, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, because it is considered one <i>shofar</i>, <b>but if he heard the sound of the outer</b> <i>shofar</i> <b>he has not fulfilled</b> it, as the sound issues from two <i>shofarot</i> at once.

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: If a <i>shofar</i> <b>was scraped</b> down, <b>whether on the inside or on the outside,</b> it is <b>fit.</b> Even if it <b>was scraped</b> out to the point <b>that</b> only <b>its outer layer remains,</b> it <b>is</b> still <b>fit.</b> If <b>one placed</b> one <b><i>shofar</i> inside</b> another <b><i>shofar</i></b> and blew, <b>if he heard the sound of the inner</b> <i>shofar</i>, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>but if he heard the sound of the outer</b> <i>shofar</i>, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. If <b>he inverted</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>and blew it, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Pappa said: Do not say that</b> this means that <b>he</b> softened the <i>shofar</i> and <b>turned it inside out like a tunic. Rather,</b> the meaning is <b>that he widened the narrow</b> end of the <i>shofar</i> <b>and narrowed</b> its <b>wide</b> end. <b>What is the reason</b> that this is unfit? It is <b>according</b> to the opinion <b>of Rav Mattana, as Rav Mattana said</b> that the verse states: <b>“You shall proclaim</b> [<i>veha’avarta</i>] with the <i>shofar</i>” (Leviticus 25:9), where the word <i>veha’avarta</i> literally means carry, thereby teaching that <b>we need</b> the <i>shofar</i> to be sounded <b>the</b> same <b>way that it was carried</b> on the head of the animal, and if a change was made, it is unfit.

### Part 7
§ It was taught in the mishna: If <b>one glued together broken fragments of <i>shofarot</i></b> to form a complete <i>shofar</i>, the <i>shofar</i> is <b>unfit. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>anything was added</b> to a <i>shofar</i>, <b>whether</b> of <b>the same substance,</b> i.e., horn, <b>or of a foreign substance,</b> the <i>shofar</i> is <b>unfit.</b> If the <i>shofar</i> <b>was punctured and sealed, whether with the same substance or with a foreign substance,</b> it is <b>unfit. Rabbi Natan says:</b> If it was sealed <b>with the same substance,</b> it is <b>fit; with a foreign substance,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> stated: If it was sealed <b>with the same substance,</b> it is <b>fit.</b> Concerning this <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This applies</b> only <b>where most of</b> the original <i>shofar</i> <b>is intact</b> and only a small patch was added. The Gemara concludes: <b>By inference,</b> if it was sealed <b>with a foreign substance,</b> then <b>even if most of</b> the original <i>shofar</i> <b>is intact,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Some teach this</b> ruling <b>with regard to the last clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, in which it was taught: If it was sealed <b>with a foreign substance,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> Concerning this <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is</b> only <b>where most of</b> the original <i>shofar</i> <b>was missing,</b> so that the patch constitutes the majority. The Gemara concludes: <b>By inference,</b> if it was sealed <b>with the same substance,</b> then <b>even if most of</b> the original <i>shofar</i> <b>was missing, it is</b> still <b>fit.</b>

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If the <i>shofar</i> <b>was plated with gold on the inside,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> If, however, it was plated <b>on the outside,</b> and <b>if its sound changed from what it was</b> before the plating, it is <b>unfit, but if not,</b> it is <b>fit.</b> If the <i>shofar</i> <b>was cracked lengthwise,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> But if it was cracked <b>along its width,</b> the following distinction applies: <b>If,</b> of the portion above the crack <b>there remains a measure</b> sufficient <b>to</b> sound <b>a blast,</b> it is <b>fit, but if not,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And how much is a measure</b> sufficient <b>to</b> sound <b>a blast? Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel explained: Enough that when he holds it in his hand, it can be seen</b> protruding <b>on one side</b> of his hand <b>and on the other side.</b> If the <b>sound</b> of the <i>shofar</i> <b>is high or deep or dry,</b> it is <b>fit</b> for blowing, <b>as</b> the Torah does not require a particular sound, and <b>all sounds</b> coming <b>from a <i>shofar</i> are fit.</b>

### Part 12
It is related that the following ruling <b>was sent</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>to Shmuel’s father:</b> If <b>one drilled</b> out the inside of a horn <b>and blew it, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious, for all</b> <i>shofarot</i> <b>are drilled,</b> since after the horn is removed from the animal, the bone that fills the horn and connects it to the animal’s head must be removed. What, then, does this ruling teach us?

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> Here we are discussing a case <b>where he drilled the bone</b> that fills the horn instead of removing it in the usual manner. <b>Lest you say</b> that even something made <b>of the same substance interposes,</b> and the sound that is produced is emitted from the bone and not from the <i>shofar</i>, the ruling therefore <b>teaches us</b> that since the bone and the horn are considered to be of the same substance, the <i>shofar</i> is fit and he has fulfilled his obligation.

### Part 14
§ It was taught in the mishna: If <b>one sounds</b> a shofar <b>into a pit or into a cistern,</b> he has not fulfilled his obligation. <b>Rav Huna said: They taught</b> this <b>only with respect to those standing at the edge of the pit,</b> i.e., on the outside, as they can hear only the echo coming from the pit. <b>But those standing in the pit</b> itself <b>have fulfilled their obligation,</b> since they initially hear the sound of the <i>shofar</i>.

### Part 15
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one sounds</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>into a pit or into a cistern, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that in that case <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation? <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from here</b> that the contradiction must be reconciled <b>in accordance with Rav Huna?</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is so.

### Part 16
Some had a different version of the previous passage. <b>There are</b> those <b>who raise the</b> following source <b>as a contradiction: We learned</b> in the mishna that if <b>one sounds</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>into a pit or into a cistern, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that in that case <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation? <b>Rav Huna said: This</b> is <b>not difficult; here,</b> in the mishna, we are dealing <b>with those standing at the edge of the pit,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> we are dealing <b>with those standing in the pit.</b>

### Part 17
