### Part 1
That is to say, God forgives sins only <b>for one who regards himself as a remainder,</b> i.e., of only secondary importance.

### Part 2
§ <b>Rav Huna raised a contradiction</b> between the two halves of a verse. <b>It is written: “The Lord is righteous [<i>tzaddik</i>] in all His ways”</b> (Psalms 145:17), indicating that God acts in accordance with the attribute of strict justice [<i>tzedek</i>], <b>and</b> then <b>it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“And kind [<i>ḥasid</i>] in all His works,”</b> implying that He acts with grace and loving-kindness [<i>ḥesed</i>], going beyond the letter of the law. Rav Huna explained: <b>Initially,</b> at the time of judgment, <b>He is righteous, but in the end,</b> at the time of punishment, <b>He is gracious.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Elazar raised a</b> similar <b>contradiction: It is written: “But to you, O Lord, belongs kindness”</b> (Psalms 62:13), implying that God acts beyond the letter of the law, <b>and</b> then <b>it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“For You render to a man according to his deeds,”</b> implying that He rewards and punishes measure for measure. Rabbi Elazar answered: <b>Initially,</b> at the time of judgment: <b>“For You render to a man according to his deeds”; but in the end,</b> at the time of punishment: <b>“But to You, O Lord, belongs kindness.”</b>

### Part 4
<b>Ilfai, and some say</b> it was the Sage <b>Ilfa,</b> also <b>raised a contradiction: It is written</b> in the list of God’s attributes: <b>“And abundant in kindness”</b> (Exodus 34:6), <b>and it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“And truth,”</b> which implies the attribute of justice. He answered: <b>Initially,</b> at the time of judgment: <b>“And truth,”</b> i.e., God employs strict justice, <b>but in the end,</b> when He sees that the world cannot survive on judgment based only on truth and justice: <b>“And abundant in kindness,”</b> i.e., He is merciful.

### Part 5
§ The verse states: <b>“And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed”</b> (Exodus 34:6). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Were it not</b> explicitly <b>written in the verse, it would be impossible to say this,</b> as it would be insulting to God’s honor. The verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, wrapped Himself</b> in a prayer shawl <b>like a prayer leader and showed Moses</b> the structure of the <b>order of</b> the <b>prayer. He said to him: Whenever the Jewish people sin, let them act before Me in accordance with this order.</b> Let the prayer leader wrap himself in a prayer shawl and publicly recite the thirteen attributes of mercy, <b>and I will forgive them.</b>

### Part 6
The verse continues: <b>“The Lord, the Lord,”</b> and it should be understood as follows: <b>I am He before a person sins, and I am He after a person sins and performs repentance,</b> as God does not recall for him his first sins, since He is always <b>“God, merciful and gracious”</b> (Exodus 34:6).

### Part 7
<b>Rav Yehuda said: A covenant was made with the thirteen attributes that they will not return empty-handed,</b> meaning that if one mentions them, he will certainly be answered, <b>as it is stated</b> in this regard: <b>“Behold, I make a covenant”</b> (Exodus 34:10).

### Part 8
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Great is repentance, for it tears up the sentence</b> issued <b>against a person, as it is stated: “Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and smear over their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and they will return, and be healed”</b> (Isaiah 6:10), implying that if indeed they return and repent, they will be healed from all their sins.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But perhaps</b> this was said <b>before the sentence</b> was issued, but after one’s sentence has been decreed repentance no longer helps. Abaye <b>said to him: It is written</b> here: “And they will return <b>and be healed”</b> (Isaiah 6:10). <b>What requires healing?</b> An illness does. Consequently, <b>you must say</b> that the reference here is to <b>a sentence</b> that has already been issued, and even so, after repentance, they will be healed.

### Part 10
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one repents in the meantime,</b> between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, <b>he is forgiven;</b> if <b>he does not repent in the meantime,</b> then <b>even if he</b> later <b>brings</b> as offerings <b>all the rams of Nebaioth in the world,</b> which are of the best quality, <b>they do not forgive him</b> in the Heavenly court. This implies that once one’s sentence has been decreed, even repentance cannot alter it. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> where repentance is effective only before the sentence on Yom Kippur, the <i>baraita</i> is referring to repentance <b>of an individual; there,</b> where forgiveness is granted even after a sentence is issued, it is referring to <b>communal</b> repentance.

### Part 11
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “A land which the Lord your God cares for; <b>the eyes of the Lord your God are</b> always <b>upon it”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). God’s constant providence over Eretz Yisrael is <b>sometimes for</b> the <b>good</b> and <b>sometimes for</b> the <b>bad. Sometimes for</b> the <b>good; how so? If the Jews were wholly wicked on Rosh HaShana, so that</b> only <b>a meager</b> amount of <b>rain was decreed for them</b> for the year, but <b>in the end they repented,</b> what can be done? <b>To add</b> rain <b>is impossible, as the decree was already issued. Rather, the Holy One, Blessed be He, causes</b> those sparse rains <b>to fall at the</b> appropriate <b>times on land that needs it,</b> e.g., fields, vineyards, and gardens, <b>all according to</b> requirements of <b>the land,</b> and those rains are just as effective as a lot of rain.

### Part 12
<b>Sometimes for bad; how so? If the Jewish people were wholly righteous on Rosh HaShana, so that much rain was decreed for them</b> for that year, but <b>in the end they regressed</b> and sinned, what can be done? <b>To reduce</b> the amount of rain <b>is impossible, as the decree was already issued. Rather, the Holy One, Blessed be He, causes</b> the rain <b>to fall not at the</b> appropriate <b>time,</b> and <b>on land that does not need it,</b> e.g., forests and deserts, and the ample rain is no more beneficial than meager rain.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: When it is <b>for good, however, let Him tear up their sentence and add</b> to the rain that had originally been decreed for them. Since the <i>baraita</i> explains that God does not do so, it implies that an evil sentence cannot be rescinded, even if the entire community fully repents. The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there, because it is possible</b> to achieve the same result <b>in this</b> manner, by causing the rain to fall at the proper time and in the proper place, without rescinding the original sentence.

### Part 14
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a different <i>baraita</i>: The psalm states: <b>“They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; these saw the works of the Lord,</b> and His wonders in the deep” (Psalms 107:23–24). The psalm continues: <b>“For He commanded, and raised the stormy wind, which lifted up the waves thereof…They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,</b> and are at their wits’ end” (Psalms 107:25–27). It continues further: <b>“Then they cry to the Lord in their trouble,</b> and He brings them out of their distresses” (Psalms 107:28). And finally, <b>“Let them give thanks to the Lord for His mercy,</b> and for His wonderful works to the children of men” (Psalms 107:31).

### Part 15
<b>Markers were inserted here</b> before each one of verses 23 through 28. These markers, which are the letter <i>nun</i> inverted, <b>are similar</b> in meaning <b>to the</b> words <b>but and only in the Torah,</b> to tell us that just as the Torah’s words are precise and cannot be changed, so too, these people cannot have their sentence changed. This <b>tells you</b> that if <b>they cried out before the sentence</b> was issued, <b>they are answered,</b> but if <b>they cried out</b> only <b>after the sentence</b> was issued, <b>they are not answered.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: This is not difficult, for <b>those</b> who go down to the sea in ships <b>are also considered like individuals.</b> Even if there are many such people, they do not constitute an entire community but only a small defined group within it.

### Part 17
The Gemara continues: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: Beloreya the convert</b> once <b>asked Rabban Gamliel: It is written in your Torah:</b> “The great, mighty, and awesome God <b>who favors no one”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>and</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “The Lord shall show favor to you</b> and give you peace” (Numbers 6: 26). How can this contradiction be resolved?

### Part 18
<b>Rabbi Yosei the priest joined</b> the conversation with <b>her and said: I will tell you a parable. To what is this matter comparable? To a person who lent his friend one hundred</b> dinars <b>and fixed a time</b> for repayment of the loan <b>before the king, and</b> the borrower <b>took an oath by the life of the king</b> that he would repay the money. <b>The time arrived, and he did not repay</b> the loan. The delinquent borrower <b>came to appease the king</b> for not fulfilling the oath that he had sworn by the life of the king, <b>and</b> the king <b>said to him:</b> For <b>my insult I forgive you,</b> but <b>you must</b> still <b>go and appease your friend. Here also</b> the same is true: <b>Here,</b> the verse that states: “The Lord shall show favor to you,” is referring to <b>sins</b> committed <b>between man and God,</b> which God will forgive; <b>there,</b> the verse that states: “God favors no one,” is referring to <b>sins</b> committed <b>between a person and another,</b> which God will not forgive until the offender appeases the one he hurt.

### Part 19
This is how the contradiction had at first been resolved, <b>until Rabbi Akiva came and taught</b> as follows:
