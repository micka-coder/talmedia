### Part 1
<b>One</b> tithe was <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai</b> that the new year for trees is on the first of Shevat, in which case it was already the third or sixth year, when one must set aside poor man’s tithe; <b>and one</b> tithe was <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel</b> that the new year for trees is on the fifteenth of Shevat, so it was still the second or fifth year, when one must set aside second tithe.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: He did not act</b> as he did in order to conform <b>with the</b> conflicting <b>practices of Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel. Rather, he acted</b> as he did in order to conform <b>with the</b> conflicting <b>practices of Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Eliezer.</b>

### Part 3
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: The <b><i>etrog</i></b> tree <b>is like</b> an ordinary <b>tree in three ways and like a vegetable in one way.</b> How so? <b>It is like</b> an ordinary <b>tree in three ways: With regard to <i>orla</i>,</b> that the fruit of the first three years after the tree is planted is forbidden; <b>with regard to fourth-year produce,</b> that the fruit that grows in the fourth year after the tree is planted must be brought to Jerusalem and eaten there or else it must be redeemed; <b>and with regard to the Sabbatical Year,</b> that the year is determined by the time of the formation of its fruit. <b>And</b> the <i>etrog</i> is like <b>a vegetable in one way,</b> which is <b>that its tithe</b> year follows <b>the time of the picking</b> of its fruit; this is <b>the statement of Rabban Gamliel.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The <i>etrog</i> is like</b> fruit of <b>a tree with regard to all matters,</b> and so its tithe year also follows the time of the formation of its fruit. Since Rabbi Akiva was in doubt whether the <i>halakha</i> is ruled in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Gamliel or Rabbi Eliezer, he set aside two tithes in order to follow both of their opinions.

### Part 5
The Gemara questions Rabbi Akiva’s conduct: <b>But do we adopt the</b> respective <b>stringencies of two</b> authorities who disagree on a series of issues? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b><i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel, but one who wishes to act in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai may do so,</b> and one who wishes to act <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel may do so.</b> If he adopts both <b>the leniencies of Beit Shammai and</b> also <b>the leniencies of Beit Hillel,</b> he is <b>a wicked person.</b> And if he adopts both <b>the stringencies of Beit Shammai and the stringencies of Beit Hillel, with regard to him the verse states: “The fool walks in darkness”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:14). <b>Rather,</b> one should act <b>either in accordance with Beit Shammai,</b> following both <b>their leniencies and their stringencies, or in accordance with Beit Hillel,</b> following both <b>their leniencies and their stringencies.</b> If so, why did Rabbi Akiva follow two contradictory stringencies?

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> wished to act in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel, but he <b>was in doubt about his tradition and did not know whether Beit Hillel said</b> that the new year for trees is <b>on the first of Shevat or</b> whether they <b>said</b> that it is <b>on the fifteenth of Shevat,</b> and so he set aside two tithes in order to conform with both possibilities.

### Part 7
The Gemara further clarifies the <i>baraita</i>, which states: <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: He did not act</b> as he did in order to conform <b>with the</b> conflicting <b>practices of Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel; rather, he acted</b> as he did in order to conform <b>with the</b> conflicting <b>practices of Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Eliezer.</b> The Gemara asks: Seeing that he did this <b>on the first of Shevat,</b> it would seem that <b>he acted in accordance with</b> the practice of <b>Beit Shammai.</b> According to Beit Hillel, both the formation of the fruit and its picking took place in the same year, as the new year does not begin until the fifteenth of Shevat, and so there would have been no need to set aside two tithes.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Ḥananya</b> who said: <b>Here we are dealing with an <i>etrog</i></b> tree <b>whose fruit was formed prior to the fifteenth of the other,</b> previous, <b>Shevat,</b> in the second year, and it was picked on the first of the following Shevat, in the third year. According to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer that the tithe year of an <i>etrog</i> follows the time of the formation of its fruit, the fruit was obligated in second tithe, whereas according to the opinion of Rabban Gamliel that the tithe year of an <i>etrog</i> follows the time of its picking, it was obligated in poor man’s tithe, and so Rabbi Akiva set aside two tithes. <b>And by right it</b> should have taught that <b>even</b> if the fruit had been picked <b>earlier,</b> any time after the fifteenth of the previous Shevat, <b>but the incident that took place, took place in this way,</b> that the fruit was picked on the first of Shevat.

### Part 9
<b>Ravina said: Combine</b> the two statements <b>and teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>It was not on the first of Shevat</b> that Rabbi Akiva picked the fruit, <b>but on the fifteenth of Shevat, and he did not act</b> as he did in order to conform <b>with the</b> conflicting <b>practices</b> of <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, but rather, he acted</b> as he did in order to conform <b>with the</b> conflicting <b>practices</b> of <b>Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Eliezer,</b> both in accordance with the practice of Beit Hillel.

### Part 10
§ <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: Now that Rabban Gamliel has said</b> that <b>the tithe</b> year <b>of an <i>etrog</i></b> follows <b>the time of the picking</b> of its fruit, <b>like a vegetable, its new year</b> for tithing <b>is Tishrei,</b> like other vegetables.

### Part 11
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> If <b>one picked</b> the fruit of <b>an <i>etrog</i></b> tree <b>on the eve of the fifteenth of Shevat before the sun had set, and</b> then <b>he picked more</b> fruit <b>after sunset, one may not set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the one for the other, as one may not set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the new</b> crop <b>for the old or from the old</b> crop <b>for the new.</b> If he did this when it <b>was the third</b> year of the Sabbatical cycle <b>going into the fourth</b> year, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: From what he picked in <b>the third</b> year he must set aside <b>first tithe and poor man’s tithe,</b> and from what he picked in <b>the fourth year</b> he must set aside <b>first tithe and second tithe.</b>
