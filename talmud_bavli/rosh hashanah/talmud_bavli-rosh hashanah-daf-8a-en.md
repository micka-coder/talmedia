### Part 1
The Gemara asks further: <b>But</b> the New Year for <b>the Jubilee</b> depends upon a certain action, i.e., sounding the <i>shofar</i>, and nevertheless the <i>tanna</i> counts it. The Gemara answers: The mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> who said that the Jubilee Year begins on Rosh HaShana, even without the <i>shofar</i> blast.

### Part 2
The Gemara presents an alternative answer as to why the <i>tanna</i> did not include all the other New Years. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> said that <b>there are four New Years that fall on four New Moons.</b> However, there are also other New Years that do not fall on New Moons.

### Part 3
The Gemara raises a question: Does Rav Ashi count the first of Shevat as one of the New Years; but <b>the first of Shevat is</b> a New Year only according to <b>Beit Shammai,</b> and by the time of Rav Ashi, the <i>halakha</i> was known to be in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel? The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> Rav Ashi <b>is saying:</b> There are <b>three</b> New Years that <b>all agree</b> occur on the first of the month, <b>and the first of Shevat is</b> subject to <b>a dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel.</b>

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> The New Year for animal tithes is <b>on the first of Tishrei. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And both of them,</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Elazar, <b>expounded the same verse</b> in different ways. <b>As it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“The flocks are clothed in the meadows, and the valleys are wrapped in grain; they shout for joy, they also sing”</b> (Psalms 65:14). <b>Rabbi Meir holds: When are the flocks clothed in the meadows,</b> i.e., when do the rams impregnate the ewes and thereby clothe them? It is <b>at the time when the valleys are wrapped in grain,</b> i.e., when they are covered in grain. <b>And when are the valleys wrapped in grain?</b> It is <b>in Adar.</b> Therefore, the sheep <b>conceive in Adar and give birth</b> five months later <b>in Av,</b> and so it is fitting that <b>their New Year</b> is on the first of <b>Elul,</b> as most of the year’s lambs have been born by then.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: When are the flocks clothed in the meadows? At the time that</b> the stalks of grain <b>“shout for joy, and also sing.” When do the stalks break out in song,</b> i.e., when are they full, so that they rustle in the wind and create the whispering sounds of song? It is <b>in Nisan.</b> Therefore, the sheep <b>conceive in Nisan and give birth in Elul,</b> and so it is fitting that <b>their New Year</b> is <b>on</b> the first of <b>Tishrei.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Meir, <b>as well, isn’t it written: “They shout for joy, they also sing”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> is referring to <b>late</b> sheep, which were conceived after the usual time, <b>in Nisan.</b> The Gemara asks: According to <b>the other</b> opinion of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon <b>as well, isn’t it written: “And the valleys wrapped in grain,”</b> which is in Adar? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> is referring to <b>early</b> sheep, <b>which were conceived</b> in <b>Adar.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks further: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> the verse can be understood <b>as it is written: “The flocks are clothed in the meadows” at the time when “the valleys are wrapped in grain.” But there are also</b> some that do not conceive until as late as when <b>“they shout for joy, they also sing.” But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon, it should have been</b> written <b>in the reverse</b> order: <b>“The flocks are clothed in the meadows” at the time when “they shout for joy, they also sing,” but there are also</b> some that conceive earlier, <b>when “the valleys are wrapped in grain.”</b> If so, according to them, the words in the verse were not written in their proper order.

### Part 8
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the dispute must be explained as follows: <b>Everyone</b> is of the opinion <b>that “the flocks are clothed in the meadows,”</b> i.e., the sheep conceive, primarily <b>at the time when “the valleys are wrapped in grain,” in</b> the month of <b>Adar. But here they disagree about</b> the meaning of <b>the</b> following <b>verse: “You shall tithe a tithe</b> from all the increase of your seed that the field brings forth year by year. And you shall eat before the Lord your God, in the place which He shall choose to place His name there, the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herds, and of your flocks; that you may learn to fear the Lord your God always” (Deuteronomy 14:22–23). <b>The verse speaks</b> here <b>about two tithes, one</b> being <b>the animal tithe and the other the grain tithe.</b>

### Part 9
They disagree about the following: <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that the verse <b>juxtaposes the animal tithe to the grain tithe. Just as the grain tithe is set aside close to</b> the grain’s <b>completion,</b> after it dries out in the field, <b>so too, the animal tithe is set aside close to its completion,</b> after the animals are born. Just as the grain is completed in Elul and is set aside the following month, which is Tishrei, so too, the animals are born in Av and therefore must be set aside in the following month, which is Elul. On the other hand, <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon hold:</b> The verse <b>juxtaposes the animal tithe to the grain tithe. Just as</b> in the case of <b>the grain tithe, its New Year is in Tishrei, so too,</b> in the case of <b>the animal tithe, its New Year is in Tishrei.</b>

### Part 10
§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>On the first of Tishrei is the New Year for</b> counting <b>years.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to which <i>halakha</i></b> is this stated? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is stated <b>for</b> determining the validity of <b>documents, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Antedated promissory notes,</b> which bear a date that is earlier than the date when the loan actually took place, <b>are invalid. But postdated promissory notes,</b> which bear a date that is later than the date when the loan actually took place, <b>are valid.</b> Therefore, it is essential to know the date on which the new year begins in order to determine whether or not a particular promissory note is valid.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we</b> already <b>learn</b> in the mishna: <b>On the first of Nisan is the New Year for kings; and we say</b> about this: <b>For what <i>halakha</i></b> is this stated? <b>And Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is <b>for</b> determining the validity of <b>documents.</b> Therefore, the new year for documents begins in Nisan and not in Tishrei.

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; here,</b> where the document is dated according to the reign of <b>the Jewish kings,</b> the year begins in Nisan; and <b>there,</b> where the document is dated to the reign of <b>the</b> gentile <b>kings of the nations of the world,</b> the year begins in Tishrei.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>But that which Rav Ḥisda said</b> in explanation of the mishna, that <b>they taught</b> that the New Year for kings is in Nisan <b>only with regard to the Jewish kings, but as for the</b> gentile <b>kings of the nations of the world we count from Tishrei,</b> did <b>Rav Ḥisda come to teach us</b> what was already taught in <b>the mishna</b> itself?

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: <b>No, Rav Ḥisda came to teach us</b> the meaning of certain biblical <b>verses,</b> i.e., that they should not be understood as was suggested at the beginning of this chapter but as teaching that the New Year for gentile kings is in Tishrei.

### Part 15
<b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda teaches</b> the mishna <b>as</b> did <b>Rabbi Zeira,</b> and he maintains that when it says that the first of Tishrei is the New Year for years, it is not referring to documents, <b>as Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The first of Tishrei is the New Year for years <b>with regard to</b> calculating the <b>cycles</b> of the sun and the moon. <b>And this is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said: The world was created in</b> the month of <b>Tishrei,</b> and all the calculations with regard to the sun and the moon are based on when they were created.

### Part 16
§ <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> When the mishna says that the first of Tishrei is the New Year for years, it is <b>with regard to judgment,</b> as on that day God judges the world for the whole year, <b>as it is written:</b> “A land that the Lord your God cares for; the eyes of the Lord your God are always upon it, <b>from the beginning of the year until the end of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12); <b>from the beginning of the year judgment is passed as to what will happen at the end</b> of the year.

### Part 17
The Gemara raises a question: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that</b> the day of judgment is in <b>Tishrei? As it is written: “Blow a <i>shofar</i> at the New Moon, at the covered time for our Festival day”</b> (Psalms 81:4). <b>Which is the Festival day</b>
