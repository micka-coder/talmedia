that the sun <b>is shooting arrows</b> at those who deny its divinity, using the rainbow as its bow. The concave side of the rainbow always faces away from the sun, so that it does not look like a bow held by the sun.

### Part 2
§ The mishna taught that the examination of the witnesses included the following questions: <b>How high was</b> the moon over the horizon, <b>and in which</b> direction <b>did it tilt? It was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: If the witness testifies that he saw the moon <b>to the north</b> of the sun, <b>his statement is valid.</b> However, if he says that he saw it <b>to its south, he has not said anything</b> of significance, as this is impossible. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t the opposite taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: If he testifies that he saw the moon <b>to the south</b> of the sun, <b>his statement is valid.</b> However, if he says he saw it <b>to its north, he has not said anything.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i> mentioned above, it is referring <b>to the summer,</b> when the moon is to the south of the sun; <b>there,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i> mentioned above, it is referring <b>to the rainy season,</b> when the moon is to the north of the sun.

### Part 4
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one</b> witness <b>says</b> that he saw the moon <b>two plow handles high</b> above the horizon, <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> says it was <b>three</b> plow handles high, <b>their testimony is valid,</b> as a small discrepancy of this kind is reasonable. However, if <b>one says</b> that he saw the moon <b>three</b> plow handles above the horizon, <b>and the</b> other <b>one says</b> it was <b>five</b> plow handles high, <b>their testimony is void,</b> as that discrepancy is unacceptable. <b>However,</b> this does not mean that the witnesses themselves are disqualified, as either of them may <b>join with another testimony,</b> i.e., he may combine his account with that of another witness who testifies likewise.

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that if the witnesses say: We did not actually see the moon, but <b>we saw it</b> reflected <b>in the water,</b> or <b>we saw it</b> reflected <b>in</b> a glass <b>lantern,</b> or <b>we saw it through</b> thin <b>clouds, they</b> may <b>not testify about it,</b> as only a direct sighting of the moon is acceptable. If they say: We saw <b>half of</b> the moon’s reflection <b>in the water,</b> or we saw <b>half of it through the clouds,</b> or we saw <b>half of it in a lantern, they</b> still may <b>not testify about it.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Now,</b> if when one sees <b>the entire</b> moon in this manner, <b>you said</b> that this is <b>not</b> valid testimony, <b>is it necessary</b> to teach that one may not testify when he sees only <b>half of it? Rather, this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If the witnesses saw <b>half of</b> the moon’s reflection <b>in water</b> and <b>half of it</b> directly <b>in the sky,</b> or <b>half of it through the clouds</b> and <b>half of it in the sky,</b> or <b>half of it in a lantern</b> and <b>half of it in the sky,</b> although they saw half of the moon directly, <b>they</b> may <b>not testify</b> about it until they see the entire moon in the sky.

### Part 7
<b>The Sages taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that if the witnesses say: One moment <b>we saw</b> the new moon, <b>but we did not see it again, they</b> may <b>not testify about it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Must they go on watching it to such</b> an extent, i.e., why should they have to see it for a long period of time?

### Part 8
<b>Abaye said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If the witnesses say: <b>We saw</b> the moon <b>on our own</b> accord, i.e., by chance, without looking for it, <b>and</b> then <b>we returned to look for it on purpose,</b> to deliver precise testimony about it, <b>but we did not see it</b> again, <b>they</b> may <b>not testify about it. What is the reason?</b> Because one can <b>say</b> that the first time it was <b>merely a small round</b> white <b>cloud that they saw,</b> which they mistook for the moon, and that is why when they looked for it again they could not find it.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> After the witnesses have been examined and their testimony accepted, <b>the head of the court says:</b> It is <b>sanctified. And all the people respond after him:</b> It is <b>sanctified;</b> it is <b>sanctified. Whether</b> the moon <b>was seen at its</b> anticipated <b>time,</b> on the thirtieth day of the previous month, <b>or whether</b> it <b>was not seen at its</b> anticipated <b>time,</b> in which case witnesses are not necessary to establish the following day as the New Moon, the court <b>sanctifies it</b> and formally proclaims the day as the New Moon.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: If</b> the new moon <b>was not seen at its</b> anticipated <b>time,</b> the court <b>does not sanctify</b> the New Moon on the following day, <b>as</b> the celestial court in <b>Heaven has already sanctified it,</b> precluding the need for the additional sanctification by the earthly court.

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that <b>the head of the court</b> says: It is sanctified. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that the court must sanctify the New Moon, derived? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And Moses declared</b> to the children of Israel <b>the appointed seasons of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:44). <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that the head of the court says:</b> It is <b>sanctified,</b> as it is evident from the verse that Moses, whose status was equivalent to that of the head of the Great Sanhedrin, declared the appointed times of the Festivals and New Moons in a formal manner.

### Part 12
§ The mishna further teaches that after the head of the court says: It is sanctified, <b>all the people respond after him:</b> It is <b>sanctified;</b> it is <b>sanctified.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>the verse states: “Which you shall proclaim them [<i>otam</i>]</b> to be sacred convocations” (Leviticus 23:2). Instead of <i>otam</i>, <b>read into</b> the verse: <b>You [<i>atem</i>],</b> as though the verse stated: Which you shall proclaim, you. This superfluous word you teaches that the month must be proclaimed not only by the head of the court, but also by you, the people. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that it is derived from the phrase: <b>“These are [<i>hem</i>] My appointed seasons”</b> (Leviticus 23:2). The term <i>hem</i> can also mean: They, which indicates that <b>they,</b> the people, <b>should</b> likewise <b>say</b> and announce <b>My appointed seasons.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara further asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the people to declare: It is <b>sanctified;</b> it is <b>sanctified, twice?</b> The Gemara answers that the reason is <b>that it is written: “Sacred convocations”</b> (Leviticus 23:2) in the plural, which indicates that they must announce it twice.

### Part 14
§ The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: If</b> the new moon <b>was not seen at its</b> anticipated <b>time,</b> the court <b>does not sanctify</b> the New Moon on the following day. The Gemara cites other opinions in this regard: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Sage <b>Palaimo says:</b> If the new moon was seen <b>at its</b> anticipated <b>time,</b> the court <b>does not sanctify</b> the New Moon, as the new moon appeared as expected and there is no need for any special sanctification. However, if the new moon was seen <b>not at its</b> anticipated <b>time,</b> the court must <b>sanctify</b> the New Moon.

### Part 15
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: In either case,</b> the court <b>does not sanctify</b> the New Moon formally, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall sanctify the fiftieth year”</b> (Leviticus 25:10), from which it is derived: <b>You</b> must formally <b>sanctify years</b> in court, <b>but you do not</b> have to formally <b>sanctify months,</b> as they are sanctified automatically by Heaven. Rather, it is enough merely to announce to the public that a certain day was established as the New Moon. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok,</b> that if the new moon was seen at its anticipated time, the court sanctifies the new month; however, if it was not seen at its anticipated time, they do not sanctify it.

### Part 16
<b>Abaye said: We, too, learn</b> in a mishna: If <b>the court and all of the Jewish people saw</b> the new moon, and <b>the witnesses were interrogated, but</b> the court <b>did not manage to say: Sanctified, before nightfall,</b> the previous month <b>is</b> rendered <b>a full,</b> thirty-day month. This indicates that <b>full, yes;</b> i.e., in this case, it is necessary to extend the previous month. However, <b>sanctified, no;</b> there is no need to formally sanctify the month, as the New Moon does not occur on its anticipated date in this case.

### Part 17
The Gemara rejects this argument: There is no proof from here, as <b>it was necessary for</b> the mishna to mention that the month is rendered <b>a full,</b> thirty-day month. The reason is that it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since the court and the entire Jewish people saw</b> the new moon, <b>it has become public</b> knowledge <b>and</b> therefore there is <b>no</b> need <b>to</b> render the previous month a <b>full,</b> thirty-day month. Consequently, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that even in this case the previous month must be extended. Nevertheless, it is still possible that the New Moon must be formally sanctified on the following day.

### Part 18
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabban Gamliel had</b> a diagram of the different <b>forms of the moon</b> drawn <b>on a tablet</b> that hung <b>on the wall of his attic, which he would show to the laymen</b> who came to testify about the new moon but were unable to describe adequately what they had seen. <b>And he</b> would <b>say</b> to them: <b>Did you see</b> a form <b>like this or like this?</b>

### Part 19
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And is it permitted</b> to create these types of forms? <b>Isn’t it written: “You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver, or gods of gold” (Exodus 20:19), which is interpreted as teaching: <b>You shall not make images of My attendants,</b> i.e., those celestial bodies that were created to serve God, including the sun and the moon?

### Part 20
§ <b>Abaye said: The Torah prohibited only</b> the images of those <b>attendants</b> with regard to <b>which it is possible to reproduce</b> an item in <b>their likeness.</b> Since it is impossible for anyone to reproduce the sun and the moon, the prohibition does not apply to these objects. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person</b> may <b>not construct a house</b> in the exact <b>form of the Sanctuary,</b> nor <b>a portico in</b> the exact <b>form of the Entrance Hall</b> of the Sanctuary, nor <b>a courtyard corresponding to</b> the Temple <b>courtyard,</b> nor <b>a table corresponding to the table</b> in the Temple, nor <b>a candelabrum corresponding to the candelabrum</b> in the Temple. <b>However, one may fashion</b>
