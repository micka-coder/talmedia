### Part 1
The Gemara clarifies this ruling: <b>Whom did you hear that</b> said the tithe year of an <i>etrog</i> <b>follows</b> the time of the <b>picking</b> of its fruit? It was <b>Rabban Gamliel. And</b> yet this <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching</b> that the new year for tithing an <i>etrog</i> is the fifteenth of <b>Shevat,</b> against the opinion of Rabba bar Rav Huna, who says that according to Rabban Gamliel it is the first of Tishrei.

### Part 2
<b>Rather, if this was said, it was said as follows: Rabba bar Rav Huna said: Even though Rabban Gamliel said</b> that the tithe year of <b>an <i>etrog</i> follows</b> the time of the <b>picking</b> of its fruit, <b>like a vegetable, its new year is</b> in <b>Shevat,</b> like a tree.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> with regard to one who picked vegetables on the eve of Rosh HaShana, such <b>that it teaches</b> the case when <b>it was the second</b> year of the Sabbatical cycle <b>going into the third</b> year, <b>and what is different here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> dealing with one who was picking the fruit of an <i>etrog</i> tree on the eve of the fifteenth of Shevat, such <b>that it teaches</b> the case when <b>it was the third</b> year <b>going into the fourth</b> year? Why is the same example not brought in both cases?

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>It teaches us a matter in passing, that it is damaging</b> for an <b><i>etrog</i></b> when the tree <b>is handled, and since everyone handles it in the Sabbatical Year,</b> as all the orchards are declared ownerless and everyone is permitted to enter and pick produce, the tree <b>does not bear fruit</b> that is fit for eating <b>for</b> another <b>three years.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan inquired of Rabbi Yannai:</b> With regard to <b>an <i>etrog</i>, when is its new year?</b> Rabbi Yannai <b>said to him:</b> It is in <b>Shevat.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan asked again: Are you referring to <b>the lunar month of Shevat or</b> to <b>the Shevat</b> of the solar <b>season,</b> which begins thirty days after the winter solstice, but on a different date each year? Rabbi Yannai <b>said to him:</b> I am referring to <b>the lunar month</b> of Shevat.

### Part 6
<b>Rava inquired of Rav Naḥman, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> who inquired <b>of Rabbi Yannai: If it was a leap year, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the new year for trees then move to the First Adar, which is the penultimate month in a leap year? <b>He said to him: Follow the majority of years.</b> Even in a leap year the new year for trees is in Shevat.

### Part 7
<b>Rabba said: An <i>etrog</i> from the sixth</b> year of the Sabbatical cycle <b>that entered into,</b> and was picked in, <b>the Sabbatical Year is exempt from tithes,</b> like the produce of the Sabbatical Year, <b>and is</b> also <b>exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>elimination</b> of Sabbatical Year produce from one’s house after produce of that particular species is no longer found in the field. <b>A Sabbatical Year</b> <i>etrog</i> <b>that entered into,</b> and was picked in, <b>the eighth</b> year <b>is exempt from tithes but is subject to</b> the mitzva of <b>elimination</b> of Sabbatical Year produce from one’s house.

### Part 8
<b>Abaye said to him: Granted,</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> the <i>halakha</i> follows the more <b>stringent</b> approach, as it follows the time of the formation of the fruit, which was in the Sabbatical Year, and therefore the <i>etrog</i> is subject to the mitzva of elimination. But in <b>the first clause,</b> which states that the <i>etrog</i> <b>is exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>elimination, why</b> is this so? It must be <b>that we say</b> to <b>follow</b> the time of <b>the formation</b> of the fruit, which was in the sixth year. But <b>if so, it should be subject to tithes.</b>

### Part 9
Rabba <b>said to him: Everyone’s hand is touching it,</b> as all are permitted to enter the orchards and touch all the fruit, and so the etrog is regarded as ownerless, <b>and</b> yet <b>you</b> wish to <b>say that it should be subject to tithes?</b> Even if it is not exempt as fruit of the Sabbatical Year, it is exempt from tithes because it is now ownerless.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Hamnuna</b> argued and <b>said:</b> An <i>etrog</i> <b>from the sixth</b> year of the Sabbatical cycle <b>that entered into,</b> and was picked in, <b>the Sabbatical Year is always</b> and for all purposes considered <b>sixth-year</b> produce. <b>And</b> an <i>etrog</i> <b>from the Sabbatical Year that entered into,</b> and was picked in, <b>the eighth</b> year <b>is always</b> and for all purposes considered produce of the <b>Sabbatical Year.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Shimon: An <i>etrog</i> from the sixth</b> year <b>that entered into,</b> and was picked in, <b>the Sabbatical Year is exempt from tithes, and it is</b> also <b>exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>elimination</b> of Sabbatical Year produce from one’s house, <b>as there is nothing that is subject to tithes unless it</b> both <b>grew at</b> a time of <b>obligation</b> in tithes <b>and was</b> also <b>picked</b> at a time of <b>obligation.</b> Likewise, an <i>etrog</i> <b>from the Sabbatical Year that entered into,</b> and was picked in, <b>the eighth</b> year <b>is exempt from tithes, and it is</b> also <b>exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>elimination, as nothing is subject to</b> the mitzva of <b>elimination unless it</b> both <b>grew in the Sabbatical Year and was</b> also <b>picked in the Sabbatical Year.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara notes: <b>The first clause</b> of this <i>baraita</i> poses <b>a difficulty</b> with regard <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Hamnuna,</b> who says that a sixth-year <i>etrog</i> that was picked in the Sabbatical Year is subject to tithes. And <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> poses <b>a difficulty</b> with regard <b>to</b> the opinions of <b>both Rabba and Rav Hamnuna,</b> as they both say that a Sabbatical-Year <i>etrog</i> that was picked in the eighth year is subject to the mitzva of elimination.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: The matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: Avtolemos testified in the name of five Elders: An <i>etrog</i> follows</b> the time of <b>its picking in</b> the matter of <b>tithes. But our Sages voted in Usha and said</b> that an <i>etrog</i> <b>follows</b> the time of <b>its picking, both in</b> the matter of <b>tithes and in</b> the matter of <b>the Sabbatical Year.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara raises a question about this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Who mentioned anything about the Sabbatical Year?</b> The subject of the discussion was tithes.
