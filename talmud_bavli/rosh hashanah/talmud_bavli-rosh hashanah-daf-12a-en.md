### Part 1
<b>But because</b> the people <b>changed their actions</b> for the worse, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, changed for them the acts of Creation and He caused the constellation of <i>Kima</i> to rise during the day, and He removed two stars</b> from it <b>and He brought a flood to the world.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who holds that the flood began in the month of Iyyar, <b>this is as it is written:</b> “In the <b>second</b> month,” which is referring to the month of Iyyar, the second month from Nisan. <b>But according to Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who holds that the flood began in the month of Marḥeshvan, <b>what is</b> the meaning of “the <b>second</b> month”? The Gemara answers: It means <b>second to</b> the month that includes the day of <b>judgment,</b> which is the month of Tishrei.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks further: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who holds that the flood began in the month of Iyyar, <b>this is</b> what it means that <b>He changed</b> the acts of Creation with a flood, as rain does not usually fall in Iyyar. <b>But according to Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who holds that the flood began in Marḥeshvan, <b>what did He change?</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: Even according to Rabbi Eliezer a change was made, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda said: They sinned with boiling</b> heat, <b>and they were punished with boiling</b> heat; <b>they sinned with the boiling</b> heat <b>of the sin</b> of forbidden sexual relations, <b>and they were punished with the boiling</b> heat of scalding waters. This is derived from a verbal analogy. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to the flood: <b>“And the waters abated”</b> (Genesis 8:1), <b>and it is written elsewhere,</b> with regard to King Ahasuerus: <b>“And the heated</b> anger <b>of the king abated”</b> (Esther 7:10), which implies that the word “abated” means cooled. This indicates that at first the waters of the flood had been scalding hot.

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Jewish Sages count</b> the years <b>from</b> Creation and <b>the flood in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> from Tishrei, and they calculate <b>the cycles</b> of the sun and the moon <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> from Nisan. <b>The sages of the</b> gentile <b>nations of the world,</b> on the other hand, <b>count both</b> the years <b>from</b> Creation and <b>the flood in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> from Nisan.

### Part 6
§ The mishna taught: <b>And</b> the first of Tishrei is the new year <b>for vegetables.</b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The first of Tishrei is the new year <b>for vegetables, and for tithes, and for vows.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by the term: <b>For vegetables?</b> It means <b>for</b> the <b>vegetable tithe,</b> i.e., one may not take <i>teruma</i> or tithes from vegetables picked before Rosh HaShana in order to fulfill the obligation for vegetables picked after Rosh HaShana.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>this is the same as</b> the meaning of the term <b>for tithes,</b> and yet the <i>baraita</i> distinguishes between them. The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> first about a tithe that is <b>by rabbinic</b> law, i.e., the vegetable tithe, that its new year is the first of Tishrei, <b>and</b> then <b>it teaches</b> about a tithe that is <b>by Torah</b> law, i.e., the tithe of grain, wine, and oil, that its new year is also the first of Tishrei.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> that which is <b>by Torah</b> law <b>in the first clause.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Since</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to vegetable tithes <b>was dear to him, he mentioned it first.</b> He taught first about the tithe that is by rabbinic decree, as it involves a greater novelty, and afterward he taught about the tithe that is by Torah law. The Gemara asks further: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna, who mentioned only vegetables but not tithes, what is his reasoning? The Gemara explains: <b>He taught</b> vegetable tithes, which are <b>by rabbinic decree, and</b> from which one may infer <b>all the more so</b> that the first of Tishrei is the new year for the tithe of grain, wine, and oil, which is by Torah law.

### Part 9
The Gemara raises a question about the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach: Tithe,</b> in the singular. Why teach tithes in the plural? The Gemara answers: He uses this formulation to include <b>both</b> the <b>animal tithe and</b> the <b>grain tithe.</b> The Gemara asks further: <b>But let him teach: Vegetable,</b> in the singular. Why teach: Vegetables, in the plural? The Gemara answers: He means to include <b>two categories of vegetables, as we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>a</b> type of <b>vegetable that is</b> usually <b>made into bundles</b> before being sold, the time of tithing is <b>from when it is bundled; and</b> with regard to a type of vegetable <b>that is not</b> usually <b>made into</b> such <b>bundles,</b> the time of tithing is <b>from when one fills a vessel</b> with it.

### Part 10
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one picked vegetables on the eve of Rosh HaShana before the sun had set,</b> so that they belong to the previous year, <b>and</b> then <b>he returned and he picked</b> more vegetables
