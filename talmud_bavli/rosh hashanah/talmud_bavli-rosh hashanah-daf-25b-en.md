### Part 1
<b>And it says</b> in another verse: <b>“Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who call His name;</b> they called upon the Lord, and He answered them” (Psalms 99:6). This verse equates Samuel to Moses and Aaron. In this manner, <b>the verse weighed three light ones of the world,</b> i.e., it considered the three less distinguished figures of Gideon, Samson, and Jephthah <b>as</b> equal to <b>three significant ones of the world,</b> Moses, Aaron, and Samuel, three of the greatest leaders of the Jewish people.

### Part 2
This comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>Jerubaal in his generation</b> is worthy of being treated <b>like Moses in his generation; Bedan in his generation</b> is <b>like Aaron in his generation;</b> and <b>Jephthah in his generation</b> is <b>like Samuel in his generation.</b> This serves <b>to teach you</b> that <b>even the lightest of the light,</b> i.e., the least distinguished individual, once <b>he has been appointed</b> as <b>a leader over the community, he</b> must be treated <b>like the greatest of the great,</b> and all are required to heed him and obey his rulings.

### Part 3
<b>And it</b> further <b>says: “And you shall come to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:9). <b>But</b> can it <b>enter your mind that a person</b> can <b>go to a judge that is not</b> alive <b>in his days?</b> What, then, is the meaning of the phrase “in those days”? It teaches that <b>you</b> need <b>to go only to the judge in one’s days,</b> i.e., he is authorized to judge and decide matters. <b>And it</b> also <b>says: “Do not say: How was it that the former days were better than these?</b> For it is not out of wisdom that you inquire concerning this” (Ecclesiastes 7:10). Instead, one must accept the rulings of the leaders of his generation.

### Part 4
§ The mishna taught: Rabbi Yehoshua <b>took his staff and his money in his hand,</b> and appeared before Rabban Gamliel on the day on which Yom Kippur occurred according to his calculation, as Rabban Gamliel had ordered him to do. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>saw</b> Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>he rose from his chair and kissed him on his head</b> and <b>said to him: Peace be on you, my teacher and my student. My teacher, as you have taught me Torah in public, and my student, as I issue a decree against you and you fulfill it like a student</b> of mine. <b>Fortunate is the generation in which the greater heed the lesser, and</b> it is <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that the generation in which <b>the lesser</b> heed <b>the greater</b> is certainly fortunate as well.

### Part 5
The Gemara questions this last point: Is this derived by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? This is incorrect, as <b>it is an obligation</b> for the lesser to heed those who are greater than them. <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Gamliel meant the following: <b>Since the greater heed the lesser, the lesser apply an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>to themselves</b> and heed the leaders of the generation.
