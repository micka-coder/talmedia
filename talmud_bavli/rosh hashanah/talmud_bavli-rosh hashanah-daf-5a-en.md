### Part 1
<b>Just as the festival of Passover requires remaining</b> overnight in Jerusalem, and only on the following day may one return home, <b>so too, the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> requires remaining overnight</b> in Jerusalem before returning home.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to Passover, <b>from where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains: <b>As it is written</b> about the Paschal offering: “And you shall roast and eat it in the place which the Lord your God shall choose; <b>and you shall turn in the morning, and go to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:7).

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>and Rabbi Shimon,</b> who learn from the verse: “On the festival of Passover, and on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, and on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” (Deuteronomy 16:16), that one transgresses the prohibition against delaying only after three Festivals have passed, <b>from where do they</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that <b>the <i>Shavuot</i></b> offering <b>has redress</b> for seven days?

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>They derive it from</b> that <b>which Rabba bar Shmuel taught, as Rabba bar Shmuel taught: The Torah states to count</b> the <b>days,</b> as it is stated: “A month of days” (Numbers 11:20), <b>and</b> then <b>sanctify</b> a new <b>month</b> with offerings. <b>And</b> the Torah also said to <b>count</b> the <b>days</b> from Passover, as it is stated: “You shall count fifty days” (Leviticus 23:16), <b>and</b> then <b>sanctify</b> the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> with offerings. <b>Just as the</b> new <b>month is</b> sanctified <b>for</b> the unit of time <b>by which it is counted,</b> i.e., for one day, <b>so too, <i>Shavuot</i> is</b> sanctified <b>for</b> the unit of time <b>by which it is counted,</b> i.e., for one full week, as it is stated: “Seven complete weeks shall there be” (Leviticus 23:15).

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: But if so, <b>say</b> that the <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> offering may be redressed for only <b>one day,</b> as <i>Shavuot</i> is determined by a count of fifty days from Passover. How, then, is it known that the <i>Shavuot</i> offering has seven days for redress? <b>Rava said: Is that to say</b> that <b>we count</b> only <b>days until <i>Shavuot</i>,</b> but <b>we do not</b> also <b>count weeks? But didn’t the Master say:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to count</b> fifty <b>days, and</b> it is also <b>a mitzva to count</b> seven <b>weeks,</b> which teaches that the Festival peace-offering brought on <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> may be sacrificed for an entire week. <b>And further, it is written</b> in the verse: <b>“The festival of weeks [<i>shavuot</i>],”</b> which teaches that it is a Festival that is established through a count of weeks.

### Part 6
§ It was taught in the <i>baraita</i> that one becomes liable for transgressing the prohibition against delaying if he delays bringing the Paschal lamb. The Gemara expresses its astonishment about this ruling: <b>But is the Paschal lamb fit to be sacrificed on the</b> other <b>Festivals? The Paschal lamb has a fixed time</b> to be brought, on the fourteenth of Nisan; <b>if one sacrificed it</b> then, <b>he has sacrificed it, but if he did not sacrifice it</b> then, <b>it is excluded</b> forever from any use.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: The Paschal lamb is cited</b> here <b>for no reason [<i>kedi</i>];</b> that is to say, the prohibition against delaying is not relevant to the Paschal lamb, and the latter was mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> only because firstborn offerings, animal tithes, and the Paschal lamb are often grouped together.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Sheshet said</b> a different explanation: <b>What is</b> meant here by <b>a Paschal lamb?</b> It is <b>the peace-offering</b> that is brought <b>in place of a Paschal lamb.</b> If a lamb that had been set aside to be sacrificed as a Paschal offering was lost, and its owner took another lamb and sacrificed that as his Paschal lamb, and afterward the first animal was found, it must now be brought as a peace-offering. This offering is subject to all the <i>halakhot</i> of the prohibition against delaying.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, this is</b> the same as the <b>peace-offerings</b> listed earlier, and it is still redundant. The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>peace-offerings brought in place of a Paschal lamb, and it</b> also <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>peace-offerings brought independently.</b> The reason for this repetition is that <b>it might enter your mind to say: Since</b> the peace-offerings <b>are brought in place of a Paschal lamb,</b>
