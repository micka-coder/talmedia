### Part 1
the requisite <b>nine</b> <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts at nine</b> different <b>times of the day, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, as the blasts need not be heard in immediate succession.

### Part 2
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>heard nine</b> <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts at nine</b> different <b>times of the day, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. If one heard the blasts <b>from nine</b> different <b>people simultaneously, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. If one heard <b>a <i>tekia</i> from this</b> one <b>and</b> afterward he heard <b>a <i>terua</i> from this</b> other one, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, as one does not have to hear all the blasts from the same individual. <b>And</b> this is true <b>even</b> if one heard the blasts from the different individuals <b>at intervals, and even</b> if it took the course of <b>the entire day.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: During</b> the reading of <b><i>hallel</i> or the Megilla</b> of Esther, <b>if one paused</b> long <b>enough to complete all of it, he must return to the beginning,</b> as it must be read in one session? Why is the <i>halakha</i> different in the case of the <i>shofar</i>? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> ruling with regard to the <i>shofar</i> <b>is his</b> own opinion, <b>and that</b> case of <i>hallel</i> and the Megilla <b>is his teacher’s</b> opinion. It is Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak who holds that one may not pause in the middle of sounding the <i>shofar</i>.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> this <b>not</b> also <b>his</b> own opinion as well? <b>Wasn’t Rabbi Abbahu</b> once <b>walking after Rabbi Yoḥanan, and</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>was reciting <i>Shema</i></b> as he walked? <b>When he reached alleyways</b> that were <b>filthy</b> with human excrement, where it is prohibited to utter words of Torah, <b>he fell silent</b> and stopped reciting <i>Shema</i>. <b>After he passed</b> through, Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to completing</b> <i>Shema</i> from where I left off? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: If you remained</b> in the alleyway for an interval <b>sufficient to complete the entire</b> <i>Shema</i>, <b>return to the beginning</b> and start again. This shows that Rabbi Yoḥanan himself holds that if one takes an extended break, he must start again from the beginning.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: This is no proof, as it is possible that <b>this is what</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said: I myself do not hold</b> that one must start again after a long pause; however, <b>according to you, as you hold</b> that a delay is a problem, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>if you paused</b> for an interval <b>sufficient to complete the entire</b> <i>Shema</i>, you must <b>return to the beginning.</b>

### Part 6
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The various trumpet <b>blasts</b> on a fast day <b>do not invalidate one another,</b> i.e., if one was omitted, this does not invalidate the other blasts. Similarly, the additional <b>blessings</b> that are inserted into the <i>Amida</i> prayer on a fast day <b>do not invalidate one another.</b> However, the <i>shofar</i> <b>blasts and</b> additional <b>blessings of Rosh HaShana and of Yom Kippur do invalidate</b> one another.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that all the blasts and blessings are indispensable on Rosh HaShana? <b>Rabba said</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Recite before Me on Rosh HaShana Kingship, Remembrances, and <i>Shofarot</i>. Kingship, so that you will crown Me as King over you; Remembrances, so that your remembrance will rise before Me for good. And with what? With the <i>shofar</i>.</b> Since these blessings constitute a single unit, one who did not recite them all has not fulfilled his obligation.

### Part 8
§ The mishna taught: In the case of <b>one who recited the blessings</b> of the additional prayer <b>and</b> only <b>afterward a <i>shofar</i> became available to him, he sounds</b> a <i>tekia</i>, <b>sounds</b> a <i>terua</i> <b>and sounds</b> a <i>tekia</i>; this is a set that he repeats three times. The Gemara explains: <b>The reason</b> that he may do this is <b>that he did not have a <i>shofar</i> at the outset.</b> This indicates that if <b>he had a <i>shofar</i> at the outset, when he hears</b> the blasts <b>he must hear them by the order of the blessings,</b> i.e., one set must be sounded after each special blessing.

### Part 9
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Pappa bar Shmuel</b> once <b>rose to pray</b> on Rosh HaShana. <b>He said to his attendant: When I signal to you</b> that I have finished each of the blessings, <b>sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>for me. Rava said to him: They said</b> that the <i>shofar</i> must be sounded after each blessing <b>only where there is a quorum of ten [<i>ḥever ir</i>],</b> not when it is sounded for an individual.

### Part 10
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When one hears</b> the <i>shofar</i> blasts, <b>he</b> must <b>hear them in order,</b> i.e., a <i>tekia</i>-<i>terua</i>-<i>tekia</i> set, <b>and upon the order of the blessings. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? Where</b> there is <b>a quorum of ten [<i>ḥever ir</i>]. However, where</b> there is <b>not a <i>ḥever ir</i>, one</b> must <b>hear them in order, but</b> he need <b>not</b> hear them <b>upon the order of the blessings. And</b> in the case of <b>an individual who has not sounded</b> the <i>shofar</i>, <b>another may sound</b> it <b>for him. But</b> with regard to <b>an individual who has not recited the blessings, another may not recite the blessings for him.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And</b> if one has to choose between hearing the <i>shofar</i> and reciting the blessings, the <b>mitzva</b> to be among <b>those who sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> is <b>more</b> important <b>than</b> the mitzva to be among <b>those who recite the blessings. How so?</b> If there are <b>two towns, in one</b> there are those who know how to <b>sound</b> the <i>shofar</i>, <b>and in the other</b> there are individuals who know how to <b>recite the blessings, one</b> should <b>go to the place where they sound</b> the <i>shofar</i>, <b>and</b> one does <b>not go to the place where they</b> know how to <b>recite the blessings.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: This <i>halakha</i> is <b>obvious.</b> Sounding the <i>shofar</i> <b>is</b> a mitzva <b>by Torah law,</b> whereas the additional prayer applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b> A mitzva that applies by Torah law is clearly more important. The Gemara answers: <b>No;</b> this seemingly superfluous ruling <b>is necessary</b> to teach that <b>although</b> in <b>this</b> town it is <b>certain</b> that the additional prayer will be recited <b>and</b> in <b>this</b> other town it is <b>uncertain</b> whether or not the <i>shofar</i> will be sounded, one should still go to the place where they know how to sound the <i>shofar</i> rather than the location where they know how to recite the blessings.

### Part 13
§ The mishna states: <b>Just as the prayer leader is obligated</b> in the prayers of Rosh HaShana, <b>so too, every individual</b> is obligated in these prayers. Rabban Gamliel says: The prayer leader fulfills the obligation on behalf of the many. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Rabbis <b>said to Rabban Gamliel: According to your statement, why does the congregation recite</b> the silent <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer</b> beforehand? <b>He said to them: In order that the prayer leader</b> should have time to prepare and <b>arrange his prayer.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rabban Gamliel said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>According to your statement,</b> that the prayer leader does not fulfill the obligation on behalf of the many, <b>why does the prayer leader descend before the ark</b> and recite the <i>Amida</i> prayer? <b>They said to him:</b> He does so <b>to fulfill</b> the obligation <b>of one who is not an expert</b> in prayer. Rabban Gamliel <b>said to them: Just as he can fulfill</b> the obligation <b>of one who is not an expert</b> in prayer, <b>so too, he can fulfill</b> the obligation <b>of the expert.</b>

### Part 15
With regard to this <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Ultimately, <b>the Rabbis concede to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel. But Rav said: It is still a dispute</b> that remains unresolved. The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya, son of Rabba bar Naḥmani, heard this and went and stated</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> before Rav Dimi bar Ḥinnana. He said to him</b> that <b>this is what Rav said: It is still a dispute.</b> Rav Dimi bar Ḥinnana <b>said to him: This is what Rabba bar bar Ḥana also said: When Rabbi Yoḥanan said this <i>halakha</i>,</b> that the Rabbis concede to the opinion of Rabban Gamliel, <b>Reish Lakish disagreed with him and said: It is still a dispute.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this? Didn’t Rabbi Ḥana from</b> the city of <b>Tzippori say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel?</b> From the fact that he said: <b>The <i>halakha</i>,</b> one can conclude <b>by inference</b> that the Rabbis still <b>disagree.</b> The very fact that he issued a ruling in favor of Rabban Gamliel shows that Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that the Sages do not accept this opinion.
