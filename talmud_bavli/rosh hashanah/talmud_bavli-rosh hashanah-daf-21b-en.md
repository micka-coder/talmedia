### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Only <b>for</b> the sake of <b>two months may</b> witnesses who saw the new moon <b>desecrate Shabbat,</b> should that be necessary in order for them to offer testimony before the court: <b>For</b> the month of <b>Nisan and for</b> the month of <b>Tishrei, for in these</b> months <b>messengers are sent out to Syria, and by them,</b> i.e., these months, the dates of <b>the</b> major <b>Festivals are set:</b> Yom Kippur, <i>Sukkot</i>, Passover, and <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>And when the Temple was standing,</b> the witnesses <b>desecrated</b> Shabbat <b>for</b> the fixing of the New Moon of <b>all</b> the months, <b>due to</b> the imperative of <b>fixing</b> the proper <b>offering</b> of the New Moon at the correct time.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that messengers were sent out for two months. The Gemara asks: <b>For</b> only <b>two months and no more? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the previous mishna, which teaches: <b>For six months</b> of the year <b>messengers go out,</b> not only for two months.

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said: This is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: For all</b> the other months <b>the messengers go out</b> already <b>in the evening,</b> if the new moon was clearly seen and if it is certain that the court will proclaim the day as the New Moon. But <b>for Nisan and for Tishrei</b> the messengers do not go out <b>until they hear from the court</b> that the day is declared as the New Moon, by saying: It is <b>sanctified,</b> so that they can offer proper testimony. The court convenes only during the daytime.

### Part 4
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For all</b> the other months the messengers <b>go out</b> already <b>in the evening,</b> but <b>for</b> the month of <b>Nisan and for</b> the month of <b>Tishrei</b> they do not go out <b>until they have heard the court</b> formally proclaim the day as the New Moon, by saying: It is <b>sanctified.</b>

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the witnesses who saw the new moon <b>may desecrate Shabbat</b> in order to testify before the court? <b>The verse states: “These are the Festivals of the Lord,</b> sacred gatherings, <b>which you shall declare in their seasons”</b> (Leviticus 23:4), thereby emphasizing that the Festivals must be set at their proper times. To ensure that they occur at the proper times, it is even permitted to desecrate Shabbat.

### Part 6
One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that just as</b> Shabbat <b>may be desecrated</b> by the witnesses <b>so that</b> the months <b>may be sanctified</b> at the proper time, <b>so too,</b> Shabbat <b>may be desecrated</b> by the messengers who go to inform the people in Eretz Yisrael and the Diaspora which day was sanctified as the New Moon, <b>so that</b> the Festivals <b>may be observed</b> at the proper time. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Which you shall declare,”</b> from which is derived that <b>for the declaration</b> of the New Moon <b>you may desecrate</b> Shabbat, <b>but you may not desecrate</b> Shabbat <b>for the observance</b> of the Festivals in their proper time.

### Part 7
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And when the Temple was standing,</b> the witnesses <b>desecrated</b> Shabbat <b>for</b> the fixing of the New Moon of <b>all</b> the months, <b>due to</b> the imperative of <b>fixing</b> the proper <b>offering</b> of the New Moon at the correct time. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>At first, they would desecrate</b> Shabbat <b>for all</b> of the months. <b>When the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to</b> the Sages: <b>Is there</b> now some <b>offering</b> due, for which it is necessary to desecrate Shabbat? Consequently, <b>they instituted that</b> the witnesses <b>may desecrate</b> Shabbat <b>only for</b> the months of <b>Nisan and Tishrei.</b>

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Whether</b> the new moon <b>was seen clearly [<i>ba’alil</i>]</b> by everyone <b>or whether it was not clearly seen, one may desecrate Shabbat</b> in order to testify before the court. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: If</b> the moon <b>was clearly seen, they may not desecrate Shabbat for it,</b> since other witnesses, located nearer to the court, will certainly testify. If these distant witnesses go to court to testify, they will desecrate Shabbat unnecessarily.

### Part 9
There was once <b>an incident where more than forty pairs</b> of witnesses <b>were passing</b> through on their way to Jerusalem to testify about the new moon, <b>and Rabbi Akiva detained them in Lod,</b> telling them that there was no need for them to desecrate Shabbat for this purpose. <b>Rabban Gamliel sent</b> a message <b>to him: If you detain the many</b> people who wish to testify about the new moon, <b>you will cause them to stumble in the future.</b> They will say: Why should we go, seeing that our testimony is unnecessary? At some point they will be needed, and no witnesses will come to the court.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred</b> that the term <b><i>alil</i></b> denotes that the new moon is clearly <b>revealed? Rabbi Abbahu said: The verse states: “The words of the Lord are pure words; silver refined in the clear sight [<i>ba’alil</i>] of the earth, purified seven times”</b> (Psalms 12:7).

### Part 11
The aforementioned verse states: “The words of the Lord are pure words…purified seven times [<i>shivatayim</i>].” <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed about a matter relating to this verse: <b>One</b> of them <b>said: Fifty gates of understanding were created in the world, and all of them were given to Moses, except for one</b> gate, for it is stated: “The words of the Lord are purified <i>shivatayim</i>,” which he understands to mean seven times seven, i.e., forty-nine, and <b>it is stated: “And You have made him a little less than God”</b> (Psalms 8:6). God created fifty gates of understanding, but He made man a little lower than God, giving him only forty-nine of them.

### Part 12
<b>“Kohelet sought to find out words of delight”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:10), which indicates that he sought to find the fiftieth gate but failed to do so. <b>Kohelet,</b> King Solomon, <b>sought to be like Moses,</b> but <b>a Divine Voice issued forth and said to him: “And that which was written uprightly, even words of truth”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:10). This is referring to the words of the Torah; and what is written there? <b>“And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses,</b> whom the Lord knew face-to-face” (Deuteronomy 34:10).

### Part 13
<b>And</b> the other <b>one said: Among the prophets there has not arisen one</b> like Moses, but <b>among the kings, one did arise,</b> Solomon, who was as wise as Moses. <b>How do I uphold</b> the words <b>“Kohelet sought to find words of delight”? Kohelet,</b> King Solomon, <b>sought to issue judgments of the heart,</b> based solely on his intuition, <b>without witnesses and without warning.</b> But <b>a Divine Voice issued forth and said to him: “And that which was written uprightly, even words of truth.”</b> Which words is this referring to? <b>“At the mouth of two witnesses,</b> or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death” (Deuteronomy 17:6). Punishment can be administered only based on the testimony of two witnesses.
