### Part 1
<b>after sunset,</b> so that they belong to the new year, <b>one may not set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithe from the one to the other, as one may not set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithe from the new</b> crop <b>for the old nor from the old</b> crop <b>for the new. If it was the second</b> year of the Sabbatical cycle <b>going into the third</b> year, the <i>halakha</i> is: From what he picked in <b>the second</b> year he must set aside <b>first tithe,</b> which he gives to a Levite, <b>and second tithe,</b> which he eats in Jerusalem; from what he picked in <b>the third</b> year, he must set aside <b>first tithe and poor man’s tithe,</b> which he gives to one who is needy.

### Part 2
<b>From where are these matters</b> derived that during the third year one must set aside poor man’s tithe and not second tithe? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> The verse states: <b>“When you have made an end of tithing all the tithes of your produce in the third year, which is the year of the tithe”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:12). This is referring to <b>a year when there is only one</b> of the two <b>tithes</b> that had been given in the previous years. <b>How so?</b> One sets aside <b>first tithe and poor man’s tithe,</b> which is explicitly mentioned in that section, <b>and second tithe is nullified</b> that year.

### Part 3
<b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it is not</b> like this, <b>but</b> in fact <b>even first tithe is nullified</b> during the third year and only one tithe is set aside, i.e., the poor man’s tithe. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Thus speak to the Levites, and say to them: When you take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance”</b> (Numbers 18:26). <b>The verse juxtaposes</b> the first tithe that is given to the Levites <b>to an inheritance</b> of land: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>an inheritance there is no interruption,</b> as by Torah law a landed inheritance cannot be sold in perpetuity, but rather it passes from one generation to the next without interruption, <b>so too,</b> with regard to the <b>first tithe</b> that is given to the Levites <b>there is no interruption,</b> but rather it is taken every year.

### Part 4
The same <i>halakha</i> <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“When you have made an end of tithing</b> all the tithes of your produce in the third year, which is the year of the tithe.” This is referring to <b>the year when there is only one</b> of the two <b>tithes</b> that had been given in the previous years. <b>How so?</b> One sets aside <b>first tithe and poor man’s tithe, and second tithe is canceled.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that even first tithe is canceled</b> during the third year. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And the Levite,</b> because he has no part or inheritance with you, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates, <b>shall come,</b> and shall eat and be satisfied” (Deuteronomy 14:29). <b>Whenever</b> the Levite <b>comes, give him;</b> every year you must give the Levite his tithe. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: One need not</b> learn this from here but from another source, as <b>it says: “Thus speak to the Levites, and say to them: When you take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance.” The verse juxtaposes</b> the first tithe <b>to an inheritance</b> of land: <b>Just as</b> with regard to a landed <b>inheritance there is no interruption, so too,</b> with regard to <b>first tithe there is no interruption.</b>

### Part 6
§ It was taught in the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>And</b> the first of Tishrei is the new year <b>for vows. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> who is <b>prohibited by a vow</b> from <b>deriving benefit from another for a year counts twelve months from day to day,</b> from the day that the vow was taken. This applies whether one took a vow not to derive any benefit from another for a year, or he was the subject of someone else’s vow prohibiting him from deriving any benefit from that individual’s property for a year. <b>But if,</b> when he took the vow, <b>he said: For this year,</b> then <b>even if he took</b> the vow <b>only on the twenty-ninth of Elul, once the first day of Tishrei,</b> the following month, <b>has arrived, it is counted as a year,</b> and he is permitted to derive benefit from the other.

### Part 7
The Gemara comments: This is true <b>even according to the one who said</b> that <b>one day in a year is not considered a year,</b> since in the case of a vow the person <b>accepted upon himself to suffer affliction, and he has</b> already achieved his goal and <b>suffered affliction,</b> and so he has fulfilled his vow.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But say</b> that a year with regard to vows ends in <b>Nisan.</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> is that <b>with regard to vows, follow the</b> ordinary <b>language of people.</b> The meaning of a vow is understood in accordance with the way that the words are used in common speech, and when people speak of a year, they ordinarily count it from the beginning of Tishrei.

### Part 9
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 1:3): From when is produce obligated in tithes? <b>Fenugreek</b> is obligated <b>from</b> the time <b>when it sprouts. Grain and olives</b> are obligated <b>from</b> the time <b>when they have reached one-third</b> of their growth.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>From</b> the time <b>when it sprouts?</b> Fenugreek begins to sprout almost immediately after it is planted. The Gemara answers: It means <b>from</b> the time <b>when it sprouts for seed,</b> i.e., from the time that its seeds are sufficiently developed to sprout into another crop.

### Part 11
It was taught in the mishna: <b>Grain and olives</b> are obligated in tithes <b>from</b> the time <b>when they have reached one-third</b> of their growth. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that the years of produce follow the first third of their growth? <b>Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said, and</b> some <b>determined</b> that this statement was said <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: The verse states: “At the end of every seven years, in the time of the year of release, in the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:10). <b>What is the purpose of the Sabbatical Year</b> being mentioned <b>with the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>?</b> The festival of <i>Sukkot</i> is already <b>the eighth</b> year.

### Part 12
<b>Rather,</b> it comes <b>to tell you</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of the Sabbatical Year continue to apply on <i>Sukkot</i> of the following year, as <b>you must treat all produce that reached one-third</b> of its growth <b>in the Sabbatical Year before Rosh HaShana with the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year,</b> even if it fully grows and is able to be used only <b>in the eighth</b> year.

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rav Asi:</b>
