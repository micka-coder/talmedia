### Part 1
<b>do not read</b> it as <b>“for three [<i>lishelosh</i>]” but</b> as: <b>For one-third [<i>lishelish</i>].</b> And learn from here that the year for tithes is determined by the date on which the produce reaches one-third of its growth.

### Part 2
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> the phrase <b>is necessary for</b> the meaning of the verse <b>itself,</b> to teach that the sixth year will be blessed so that it yields three years’ worth of produce. The Gemara answers: <b>It is written in another verse: “And you shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old produce until the ninth year”</b> (Leviticus 25:22), so that the latter verse teaches about the three years’ worth of produce, and the first verse is available to derive the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one-third growth.

### Part 3
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there: Rice, millet, poppy, and sesame that took root before Rosh HaShana are tithed in accordance with the outgoing</b> year, meaning that second tithe is set aside in the first, second, fourth, and fifth years of the Sabbatical cycle, and poor man’s tithe is set aside in the third and sixth years, <b>and they are permitted</b> even if the following year is <b>a Sabbatical Year. If</b> they did <b>not</b> take root before Rosh HaShana, <b>they are prohibited</b> if it is <b>the Sabbatical Year, and</b> in ordinary years <b>they are tithed in accordance with the incoming year.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabba said:</b> Say that <b>the Sages said</b> that the tithe year of <b>a tree follows</b> the time of <b>the formation</b> of its fruit, that of <b>grain and olives follows</b> the time that they reach <b>one-third</b> of their growth, and that of <b>vegetables follows</b> the time of their <b>picking.</b> The question may therefore be raised: With regard to <b>these</b> crops, i.e., rice, millet, poppy, and sesame, <b>to what did the Sages equate them?</b> Their tithe year is determined neither by their formation, nor by the time when they reach one-third of their growth, nor by their picking.

### Part 5
<b>Rabba then said:</b> The reason for their uniqueness with regard to tithing is that <b>since</b> these crops do not ripen all at once, but rather, <b>they ripen</b> and are gathered <b>little by little</b> over an extended period of time, if their year were to follow the time of their picking, people might set aside tithes from that which was picked before Rosh HaShana for that which was picked after Rosh HaShana. Therefore, <b>the Sages</b> decreed that their tithe year <b>follows</b> the time of their <b>taking root,</b> which is the same for the entire field.

### Part 6
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> Why should they have made such a decree? There is a better alternative: <b>Let one pile</b> the entire stock onto <b>his threshing floor, into</b> the middle of <b>it,</b> mix the stock together well, and then set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithes, <b>and</b> consequently <b>it will turn out that he has set aside <i>teruma</i></b> and tithes <b>from the new</b> crop <b>in</b> the mixture <b>for the new</b> crop <b>in it,</b> and <b>from the old</b> crop <b>in</b> the mixture <b>for the old</b> crop <b>in it.</b>

### Part 7
Abaye continued: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar said in the name of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri:</b> If the <b>cowpea</b> plant <b>was planted for seed,</b> not to be eaten as a vegetable but for the seeds, the beans themselves, either for eating or planting, and <b>some took</b> root already before Rosh HaShana, while some took root only after Rosh <b>HaShana, one may not set aside <i>teruma</i> or tithes from this for that, as one may not set aside <i>teruma</i> or tithes from the new</b> crop <b>for the old or from the old</b> crop <b>for the new.</b>

### Part 8
<b>How,</b> then, <b>should one act</b> so that he not err and set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithes incorrectly? <b>He should pile</b> the entire stock onto <b>his threshing floor, into</b> the middle of <b>it,</b> mix the stock together well, and then set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithes, <b>and</b> consequently <b>it will turn out that he has set aside <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the new</b> crop <b>in</b> the mixture <b>for the new</b> crop <b>in it, and from the old</b> crop in the mixture <b>for the old</b> crop <b>in it.</b> Why not do the same for rice, millet, poppy, and sesame?

### Part 9
Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>You are speaking of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri?</b> You cannot raise an objection from what he says, as <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri holds</b> that <b>there is mixing.</b> He assumes that the old and new were thoroughly mixed, so that the <i>teruma</i> and tithes set aside from the mixture have the same proportions of old and new crops as did the original crops.

### Part 10
<b>But the Sages hold</b> that <b>there is no mixing;</b> they do not assume that the old and new became thoroughly and evenly mixed. Therefore, piling the entire stock, mixing it together, and then setting aside <i>teruma</i> and tithes will not ensure that they are set aside correctly.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar that he said in the name of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri. Rabbi Zeira strongly objects to this: And did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say this? But didn’t Shmuel say: There is no mixing for anything except for wine, oil,</b> and other liquids? In the case of liquids he holds that everything is entirely mixed together, but not in the case of solids. How, then, could he have ruled in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri?

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Zeira <b>forgot that which Shmuel said: In all</b> cases, the tithe year <b>follows</b> the time of <b>the full ripening of the produce.</b> Therefore, all of the cowpea seeds may be tithed together, whether the plants from which they grew took root before or after Rosh HaShana. This is not due to Rabbi Shimon Shezuri’s rationale that there is mixing, but because all of the beans reach full ripening at the same time, and consequently, they are all considered produce of the incoming year.
