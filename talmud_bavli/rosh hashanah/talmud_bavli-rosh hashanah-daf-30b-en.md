### Part 1
<b>stated</b> his decree <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who said:</b> When the verse states: “And you shall eat neither bread nor parched corn, nor fresh stalks, <b>until this selfsame [<i>etzem</i>] day,</b> until you have brought the offering of your God” (Leviticus 23:14), this does not teach that it is permitted to eat the new grain on the morning of the sixteenth when the eastern horizon is illuminated. Rather, it is prohibited <b>until the essence [<i>atzmo</i>] of the day. And he holds</b> that when the verse says: <b>Until</b> that day, it means <b>until and including</b> this date. If so, by Torah law, eating the new grain is permitted only after the conclusion of the sixteenth, unless the <i>omer</i> offering was sacrificed, in which case it is permitted to eat the new grain immediately afterward.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda? <b>But he disagrees with him, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sukka</i> 41a): <b>After the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that</b> for <b>the entire day of waving</b> the <i>omer</i> offering, eating the grain of the new crop <b>is prohibited. Rabbi Yehuda said: But isn’t it prohibited by Torah law, as it is written: “Until this selfsame day”?</b> This indicates that Rabbi Yehuda disagrees with Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai.

### Part 3
The Gemara rejects this argument. <b>There, it was Rabbi Yehuda who erred</b> in his understanding. <b>He thought</b> that <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai was saying</b> that eating new grain on the sixteenth of Nisan is prohibited <b>by rabbinic law. But that is not so; he was</b> actually <b>saying</b> that it is prohibited <b>by Torah law.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>But it is taught</b> in the mishna: <b>Instituted.</b> This term is referring to a rabbinic ordinance, not a Torah law. The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the term <b>instituted?</b> It means that Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>interpreted</b> the verse, <b>and instituted</b> that this is how one should act from now onward. When the Temple was standing there was no need for this <i>halakha</i>, as it was permitted to eat the new grain after the sacrificing of the <i>omer</i>.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Initially, they would accept testimony</b> to determine the start <b>of the month</b> throughout <b>the entire</b> thirtieth <b>day</b> from the beginning of the month of Elul, before Rosh HaShana, and if witnesses arrived from afar and testified that they had sighted the New Moon the previous night, they would declare that day the Festival.

### Part 6
<b>Once, the witnesses tarried coming</b> until the hour was late, <b>and the Levites erred with regard to the song,</b> i.e., the psalm that they were supposed to recite, as they did not know at the time whether it was a Festival or an ordinary weekday. From that point on, the Sages <b>instituted that they would accept</b> testimony to determine the start of the month <b>only until <i>minḥa</i></b> time. If witnesses had not arrived by that hour, they would declare Elul a thirty-day month and calculate the dates of the Festivals accordingly.

### Part 7
<b>And if witnesses came from <i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>onward,</b> although the calculations for the dates of the Festivals would begin from the following day, the people would nevertheless <b>observe that day,</b> on which the witnesses arrived, as <b>sacred,</b> so that in future years they would not treat the entire day as a weekday and engage in labor from the morning on the assumption that the witnesses will arrive only after <i>minḥa</i> time. <b>And</b> they would also observe <b>the following day</b> as <b>sacred.</b> On the second day, they observed Rosh HaShana in full, both by sacrificing its offerings as well as by calculating the upcoming Festivals from that date.

### Part 8
<b>After the Temple was destroyed</b> and there was no longer any reason for this ordinance, <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that they would</b> once again <b>accept testimony</b> to determine the start <b>of the month the entire day.</b>

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What error did the Levites make with regard to the song</b> they were supposed to recite? The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they interpreted that they did not recite any song at all,</b> as they did not know which psalm should be sung, the one for an ordinary weekday or the special one for the Festival. <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Their mistake was <b>that they recited the song of</b> an ordinary <b>weekday with the daily afternoon offering.</b> After the witnesses testified, it became clear that they should have recited the psalm of the Festival.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to his son Ahava: Go out</b> and <b>teach</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>to</b> the Sages of Babylonia: <b>They instituted that</b> on Rosh HaShana the court <b>would accept testimony</b> to determine the start <b>of the month only if there was</b> enough <b>time left in the day to sacrifice the daily offerings and the additional offerings</b> of the Festival <b>and their libations, and to recite the</b> appropriate <b>song without a mistake. Granted, if you say</b> that <b>they recited the song of</b> an ordinary <b>weekday, this is</b> a case in <b>which there is a mistake. However, if you say</b> that <b>they did not recite</b> any psalm <b>at all, what mistake is there?</b> The term: Mistake, indicates the performance of an incorrect action.

### Part 11
The Gemara explains: <b>Since they did not recite</b> any psalm <b>at all, you do not have a mistake greater than this.</b> The failure to recite the appropriate psalm disrupts the entire sacrificial service.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Huna raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the daily offering on Rosh HaShana,</b> in <b>the morning it is sacrificed in accordance with its</b> regular <b><i>halakhot</i>,</b> i.e., the Levites recite the regular psalm for that day of the week. When it comes <b>to the additional offering</b> of Rosh HaShana, <b>what</b> psalm <b>does one recite?</b> The psalm that includes the verse: <b>“Sing aloud to God our strength; shout to the God of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 81:2). With regard <b>to the</b> daily <b>afternoon</b> offering, <b>what</b> psalm <b>does one recite?</b> The psalm that includes the verse: <b>“The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness”</b> (Psalms 29:8).

### Part 13
<b>And when Rosh HaShana occurs on a Thursday, whose</b> regular <b>psalm</b> even on an ordinary weekday <b>is: “Sing aloud to God our strength,”</b> and the witnesses came before the daily morning offering was sacrificed, <b>one would not recite: “Sing aloud</b> to God our strength; shout to the God of Jacob” <b>with the</b> daily <b>morning</b> offering, <b>because one goes back and repeats that section</b> at the time of the additional offering.

### Part 14
<b>Rather, what does one recite? “I removed his shoulder from the burden”</b> (Psalms 81:7), which is referring to Joseph, who was set free from prison on Rosh HaShana. In other words, the second half of Psalm 81 was recited with the morning offering, while the first half was recited with the additional offering. <b>And if the witnesses came</b> on a Thursday <b>after the daily morning offering</b> had already been sacrificed, <b>one recites: “Sing aloud</b> to God” at the additional offering, <b>even though</b> this means <b>that one goes back and repeats that section</b> again. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 15
The Gemara explains the objection from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>anywhere there is a doubt</b> with regard to what to say, <b>one recites the song of</b> an ordinary <b>weekday, this is</b> the meaning of <b>that which</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>states: One recites</b> the psalm for an ordinary weekday <b>and</b> then <b>repeats it. However, if you say</b> that in a case of doubt <b>no</b> psalm <b>is recited at all, what is</b> the meaning of the clause: <b>One recites it and repeats it?</b>
