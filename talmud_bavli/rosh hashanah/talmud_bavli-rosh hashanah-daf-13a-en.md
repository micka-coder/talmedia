### Part 1
<b>But perhaps</b> the verse is referring to produce that <b>did not grow at all</b> during the seventh year, <b>and</b> nevertheless, <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that all the <i>halakhot</i> of the Sabbatical Year <b>continue to apply until the festival of <i>Sukkot</i></b> of the eighth year.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “And the festival of gathering, which is at the end of the year,</b> when you have gathered in your labors out of the field” (Exodus 23:16). <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“gathering”? If we say</b> that it means: <b>A Festival that comes at the time of gathering</b> the crops, <b>isn’t it</b> already <b>written: “When you have gathered</b> in your labors”? There is no need to repeat this a second time.

### Part 3
<b>Rather, what is</b> meant here by <b>“gathering”?</b> It means <b>harvesting. And the Sages have</b> an accepted <b>tradition that any grain that</b> reaches full growth so that it <b>is harvested on the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>is known</b> to <b>have reached one-third</b> of its growth <b>before Rosh HaShana, and</b> the Torah <b>calls</b> that period of the year until <i>Sukkot</i> <b>“at the end of the year,”</b> thereby indicating that it is still subject to the <i>halakhot</i> governing the previous year.

### Part 4
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira: And are the Sages</b> able to <b>discern</b> precisely <b>between</b> produce that reached <b>one-third</b> of its growth <b>and</b> produce that reached <b>less than one-third</b> of its growth? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Do I not</b> always <b>tell you that you must not take yourself out</b> of the bounds of <b>the <i>halakha</i>? All the measures of the Sages are like this;</b> they are precise and exact.

### Part 5
For example, <b>one who immerses himself in</b> a ritual bath containing <b>forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water is rendered pure, but <b>in forty <i>se’a</i> less</b> the tiny amount of <b>a <i>kortov</i>,</b> he <b>cannot immerse</b> and become pure <b>in them.</b> Similarly, <b>an egg-bulk</b> of impure food <b>can render</b> other <b>food ritually impure,</b> but <b>an egg-bulk less</b> even the tiny amount of <b>a sesame</b> seed <b>does not render food ritually impure.</b>

### Part 6
So too, a piece of cloth <b>three by three</b> handbreadths in size <b>is susceptible to ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading,</b> but a piece of cloth <b>three by three</b> handbreadths <b>less one hair [<i>nima</i>] is not susceptible to ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya then said: What I said is nothing,</b> and my question had no basis, as it can be demonstrated that the Sages know how to determine that produce has reached one-third of its growth. <b>As Rav Kahana was</b> once <b>asked by the</b> other <b>colleagues</b> of the academy as follows: With regard to <b>the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>that the Jewish people brought when they</b> first <b>entered Eretz Yisrael</b> in the days of Joshua, <b>from where did they bring it? If you say</b> that this <i>omer</i> offering was brought from grain <b>that grew in the possession of a gentile,</b> there is a difficulty, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “You shall bring an <i>omer</i> of the first fruits of <b>your harvest</b> to the priest” (Leviticus 23:13), from which it can be derived that it must be your harvest, grown in the possession of a Jew, <b>and not the harvest of a gentile.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara first questions the assumption of Rav Kahana’s colleagues: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that</b> the Jewish people actually <b>brought</b> an <i>omer</i> offering that year? <b>Perhaps they did not offer</b> it at all. The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “And they did eat of the produce of the land on the next day after Passover”</b> (Joshua 5:11), which teaches: Only <b>on the next day after Passover did they eat</b> from the new grain, but <b>initially they did not eat</b> from it. Why? It is <b>because they</b> first <b>brought the <i>omer</i></b> offering on the sixteenth of Nisan as is required, <b>and</b> only <b>afterward did they eat</b> from the new grain. Therefore the question remains: <b>From where did they bring</b> the <i>omer</i> offering?

### Part 9
Rav Kahana <b>said to them: Anything that</b> came into the possession of a Jew and <b>did not reach one-third</b> of its growth <b>in the possession of a gentile</b> is fit to be harvested for the sake of the <i>omer</i> offering.

### Part 10
Rabbi Yirmeya concludes his proof: But there, too, one might ask: <b>Perhaps</b> the grain <b>had</b> in fact already <b>reached</b> one-third of its growth, <b>but they could not discern</b> with certainty between grain that had reached one-third of its growth and grain that had not. <b>Rather,</b> you must say that <b>they were able to discern</b> with certainty. <b>Here, too,</b> you can say that the Sages <b>can discern</b> with certainty between produce that has reached one-third of its growth before Rosh HaShana and produce that has not.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: This is not absolute proof, <b>as perhaps</b> the Jewish people brought the <i>omer</i> offering from grain that <b>did not grow at all</b> before they conquered the land, and the distinction was evident to all. <b>But where</b> produce <b>reached one quarter</b> of its growth, the Sages <b>cannot discern</b> with certainty the difference <b>between one-third and less than one-third.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “And the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the</b> first <b>month”</b> (Joshua 4:19). <b>And if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> to say <b>that</b> the grain <b>had not grown at all</b> before the Jewish people entered the land, <b>could it have reached full growth in</b> just <b>five days?</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Rather, what</b> can one say? <b>That</b> the grain <b>had reached one quarter or one-sixth [<i>danka</i>]</b> of its growth before the Jewish people conquered the land? This too is difficult, as one can <b>still</b> ask: <b>Could</b> the grain <b>have reached full growth in</b> just <b>five days? Rather, what have you to say?</b> One could say that with regard to Eretz Yisrael <b>it is written: “The land of the deer”</b> (Daniel 11:41), implying that the grain of Eretz Yisrael ripens with the swiftness of a deer. <b>Here, too,</b> one can say that <b>“the land of the deer” is written</b> with regard to Eretz Yisrael and applies to the ripening of the grain, so that it can ripen in just a few days.

### Part 14
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥanina strongly objects to</b> the proof brought from the verse in Exodus cited above, which refers to <i>Sukkot</i> as the festival of gathering: <b>How can you say</b> that <b>this “gathering” means harvesting? But isn’t it written:</b> “You shall observe the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> seven days, <b>after you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13), <b>and the Master said</b> about this: <b>The verse speaks</b> here <b>of the waste of the threshing floor and the winepress,</b> which is used to make the roof of the <i>sukka</i>. If so, the gathering mentioned with regard to the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> is referring not to harvesting but to gathering straw from the threshing floor.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> about this: <b>This matter was in our hands,</b> i.e., I thought that we had solid proof that the years for produce follow the first third of its growth, <b>but Rabbi Ḥanina came and cast an axe upon it,</b> cutting it down, as Rabbi Ḥanina’s objection has totally nullified the proof.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, from where do we</b> derive that the years for produce follow the first third of its growth? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And it shall bring forth fruit for the three years”</b> (Leviticus 25:21);
