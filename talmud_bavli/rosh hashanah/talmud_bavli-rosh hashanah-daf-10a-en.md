### Part 1
<b>And</b> if the planting, layering, or grafting took place more than thirty days before Rosh HaShana, <b>the fruit of this planting is prohibited until the fifteenth of Shevat</b>of the fourth year since the tree’s planting, even though the three years were already completed the previous Rosh HaShana. This principle applies <b>both for <i>orla</i> during</b> the year of <b><i>orla</i>,</b> when it is prohibited to eat the fruit, <b>and for fourth-year produce during</b> the year of <b>fourth-year produce,</b> which must be eaten in Jerusalem or redeemed before it is eaten outside Jerusalem.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that the prohibitions of <i>orla</i> and fourth-year produce extend past Tishrei until the fifteenth of Shevat? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said, and</b> some <b>determined</b> that <b>it</b> was stated <b>in the name of Rabbi Yannai: The verse states:</b> “Three years shall it be as prohibited to you; it shall not be eaten. <b>And in the fourth year</b> all its fruit shall be sacred for praise-giving to the Lord. <b>And in the fifth year</b> shall you eat of its fruit, that it may yield to you its increase; I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 19:23–25).

### Part 3
The <i>baraita</i> explains: The repetition of the word “and,” indicated by the conjunctive <i>vav</i> that joins these verses, teaches that <b>there are times that</b> the tree is already <b>in its fourth</b> year <b>and yet</b> the fruit <b>is forbidden as <i>orla</i>,</b> from the verses “three years…and in the fourth year”; <b>and there are times that</b> the tree is already <b>in its fifth</b> year <b>and yet</b> the fruit <b>is forbidden as fourth-year produce,</b> from the verses “in the fourth year…and in the fifth year.”

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as, if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, didn’t Rabbi Meir say</b> that even <b>one day in a year is considered a year? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The term <b>bullock [<i>par</i>] mentioned in the Torah without specification</b> is referring to a bullock that <b>is twenty-four months and one day old,</b> as although it is known by tradition that a bullock is three years old, once it is one day into its third year, it is already considered three years old; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The term bullock is referring to an animal that is <b>twenty-four months and thirty days old. As Rabbi Meir would say: Wherever a calf [<i>egel</i>] is stated in the Torah without specification,</b> the reference is to a calf that is <b>one year old; a young ox [<i>ben bakar</i>]</b> is referring to a cow that is <b>two years old;</b> and <b>a bullock</b> is referring to a cow that is <b>three years old.</b> Since the <i>baraita</i> dealing with planting requires that the tree be planted thirty days before Rosh HaShana, rather than one day, it would seem that it is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir.

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> it can be explained as follows. <b>When Rabbi Meir said</b> that <b>one day in a year is considered</b> a full <b>year,</b> this is only when the day is <b>at the end of the year;</b> since the count of a new year is about to begin, the day is considered like a whole year. <b>But</b> if the day is <b>at the beginning of the year,</b> that one day is <b>not</b> considered like a whole year.

### Part 7
Against this claim <b>Rava said: But</b> can we <b>not</b> invoke an <b><i>a fortiori</i> argument</b> to prove just the opposite? <b>Whereas</b> in the case of <b>a menstruating woman, where the beginning of the day is not counted</b> as a full day <b>at the end</b> of her seven-day period of ritual impurity and instead she must wait until the end of the seventh day and immerse in a ritual bath only in the evening, yet nevertheless <b>the end of the day is counted</b> as a full day <b>at the beginning</b> of her ritually impure period, since if she experienced bleeding shortly before sunset that day is considered as the first day of her seven-day period of impurity; if so, in the case of <b>a year, where one day is counted</b> as a full year <b>at the end</b> of the year,
