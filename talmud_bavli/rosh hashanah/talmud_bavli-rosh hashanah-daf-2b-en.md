### Part 1
<b>teaches us that Nisan is the New Year for kings, and</b> it also teaches us that <b>one day in a year is considered a year;</b> although this king ruled for only one day, a full year is counted toward his reign. The Gemara asks: Consider the next clause of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But if he ascended</b> to the throne <b>only on the first of Nisan, a year is not counted toward his</b> reign <b>until the next</b> first of <b>Nisan arrives.</b> Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for a case <b>where</b> the princes agreed to <b>appoint him</b> as king already <b>in</b> the month of <b>Adar. Lest you say</b> that since the decision to appoint him king was made already in Adar, once the first of Nisan arrives they <b>should count</b> it <b>the second year of his</b> reign, therefore the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the count begins only from when he actually began his rule.

### Part 3
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the king <b>died in</b> the month of <b>Adar and another</b> king <b>succeeded him</b> to the throne <b>in</b> that same <b>Adar, one counts</b> the <b>year to this one,</b> i.e., the previous king, as his final year, <b>and to that one,</b> i.e., the new king who began his reign in Adar. If the first king <b>died in</b> the month of <b>Nisan and another</b> king <b>succeeded him in</b> that same <b>Nisan, one counts</b> the <b>year to this one,</b> the previous king, <b>and to that one,</b> the new king. But if the first king <b>died in Adar and another</b> king <b>succeeded him in Nisan, one counts the first year to the first</b> king as his final year, <b>and the second</b> year <b>to the second</b> king as the first year of his reign.

### Part 4
<b>The Master said:</b> If the king <b>died in Adar and another</b> king <b>succeeded him</b> to the throne <b>in</b> that same <b>Adar, one counts</b> the <b>year to this one,</b> i.e., the previous king, as his final year, <b>and to that one,</b> i.e., the new king, as the first year of his reign. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>one year cannot be counted toward two</b> kings, and so the entire year should be counted only toward the previous king, the <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the years of two kings can overlap and be counted in a single year.

### Part 5
The Gemara cites the next phrase of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> the first king <b>died in Nisan and another</b> king <b>succeeded him in</b> that same <b>Nisan, one counts</b> the <b>year to this one,</b> the previous king, <b>and to that one,</b> the new king. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>when we say</b> that <b>one day in a year is considered</b> a full <b>year,</b> this only applies when the day is <b>at the end of the year,</b> i.e., since his reign will continue in the coming year the day is considered like a whole year, <b>but</b> if the day is <b>at the beginning of the year we should not say</b> that the beginning of Nisan is counted as another year for the previous king; therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> that there is no such a distinction.

### Part 6
It was further taught in the <i>baraita</i>: But if the first king <b>died in Adar and another</b> king <b>succeeded him in Nisan, one counts the first</b> year <b>to the first</b> king as his final year, <b>and the second</b> year <b>to the second king</b> as the first year of his reign. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for a case <b>where</b> the princes decided to <b>appoint him</b> as king <b>in Adar, and he is</b> also <b>a king, son of</b> the previous <b>king,</b> so that his succession to the throne is automatic. <b>Lest you say</b> that by the time the first of Nisan arrives, <b>two years should be counted toward his</b> reign, <b>it</b> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that one counts only from Nisan, when he actually succeeded his father to the throne.

### Part 7
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one counts</b> the years of kings’ reigns <b>only from Nisan? As it is stated: “And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which is the second month,</b> that he began to build the house of the Lord” (I Kings 6:1). This verse <b>juxtaposes the reign of Solomon to the exodus from Egypt: Just as</b> one counts the years since <b>the exodus from Egypt from Nisan,</b> when the Jewish people left Egypt, <b>so too,</b> one counts the years of <b>Solomon’s reign from Nisan.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that we count</b> the years from <b>the exodus from Egypt themselves from Nisan? Perhaps we count</b> them <b>from Tishrei.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written: “And Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the commandment of the Lord, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month”</b> (Numbers 33:38), <b>and it is</b> later <b>written: “And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke</b> to the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 1:3). <b>From the fact that when</b> the Bible <b>speaks of</b> the month of <b>Av,</b> which is the fifth month, <b>it calls</b> that year <b>“the fortieth year,” and when it speaks of</b> the following <b>Shevat, it</b> also <b>calls</b> that year <b>“the fortieth year,” the implication is</b> that the <b>New Year</b> does <b>not</b> begin in <b>Tishrei.</b> Were it the case that the New Year begins in Tishrei, Av and the following Shevat would not be in the same year because the year would have changed in Tishrei.

### Part 10
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Granted,</b> in <b>this</b> case of Aaron’s death it is <b>explicitly stated that</b> the year is counted <b>from the exodus from Egypt,</b> as it states: “In the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt.” <b>But</b> with regard to <b>this</b> other incident of Moses’ oration, <b>from where</b> is it known <b>that</b> the year is counted <b>from the exodus from Egypt? Perhaps</b> it is forty years <b>since the establishment of the Tabernacle</b> in the wilderness.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>In accordance with</b> what <b>Rav Pappa said</b> in a different context, that the meaning of one instance of the expression <b>“the twentieth year”</b> may be inferred from another instance of the expression <b>“the twentieth year” by way of a verbal analogy, here too,</b> the meaning of one instance of the expression <b>“the fortieth year”</b> may be inferred from another instance of the expression <b>“the fortieth year” by way of a verbal analogy: Just as here,</b> with regard to Aaron’s death, the count is <b>from the exodus from Egypt, so too, here,</b> with regard to Moses’ oration, although this is not stated explicitly, the count is <b>from the exodus from Egypt.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara raises another question: Even if this serves as proof that these two events both took place in the fortieth year from the exodus from Egypt, <b>from where</b> is it known <b>that the incident of</b> Aaron’s death in <b>Av</b> took place <b>first? Perhaps the incident of</b> Moses’ oration in <b>Shevat</b> took place <b>first,</b> in which case it is possible that the years from the Exodus are counted not from Nisan, but from Tishrei.

### Part 13
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written</b> that Moses delivered his oration <b>“after he had slain Sihon”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:4), <b>and when Aaron died Sihon was still alive, as it is written:</b>
