### Part 1
in the first clause, the <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with a minor who has reached</b> the age of <b>training</b> in mitzvot. This child is taught to sound the <i>shofar</i>, as one is obligated to teach him the proper way to perform mitzvot. However, <b>here,</b> in the second clause, the <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with a minor who has not</b> yet <b>reached</b> the age of <b>training.</b> Although one need not prevent this child from sounding the <i>shofar</i>, one does not encourage him to do so.

### Part 2
§ The mishna taught: <b>One who acts unawares</b> while sounding the <i>shofar</i>, without any intention to produce a sound, <b>has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara infers: <b>One who sounds</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>for music,</b> even if he has no intention to perform the mitzva, <b>has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that the mishna <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, as Rava said: One who sounds</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>for music has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara rejects this suggestion. There is no clear proof from here, as <b>perhaps one who sounds</b> a <i>shofar</i> <b>for music is also called</b> one who <b>acts unawares.</b> It is possible that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna includes in this category anyone who sounds the <i>shofar</i> without a clear intention to fulfill the mitzva.

### Part 3
§ The mishna continues. <b>And one who hears</b> the <i>shofar</i> blasts <b>from one who acts unawares has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>However, one who hears</b> the <i>shofar</i> blasts <b>from one who is sounding</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>for himself,</b> without intention of sounding it for others, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The mishna apparently indicates that <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>Let us say that this is a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zeira, as Rabbi Zeira said to his attendant: Have the intention</b> to sound the <i>shofar</i> on my behalf <b>and sound</b> it <b>for me.</b> This statement indicates that one must have the intention to enable the one who hears it to fulfill his obligation.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this argument. <b>Perhaps</b> one can explain that <b>since</b> the <b>first clause</b> of the mishna <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>one who acts unawares, the latter clause also taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>one who acts unawares.</b> If so, no inference may be drawn from here to the case of one who sounds the <i>shofar</i> for himself, with no intention of doing so for others.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The order of the blasts</b> is <b>three</b> sets <b>of three</b> blasts <b>each,</b> which are: <i>Tekia</i>, <i>terua</i>, and <i>tekia</i>. <b>The length of a <i>tekia</i></b> is <b>equal to</b> the length of <b>three <i>teruot</i>,</b> and <b>the length of a <i>terua</i></b> is <b>equal to</b> the length of <b>three whimpers.</b> If <b>one sounded the first</b> <i>tekia</i> of the initial series of <i>tekia</i>, <i>terua</i>, <i>tekia</i>, <b>and</b> then <b>extended the second</b> <i>tekia</i> of that series <b>to</b> the length of <b>two</b> <i>tekiot</i>, so that it should count as both the second <i>tekia</i> of the first set and the first <i>tekia</i> of the second set, <b>he has in his hand</b> the fulfillment of <b>only one</b> <i>tekia</i>, and he must begin the second set with a new <i>tekia</i>.

### Part 6
With regard to <b>one who recited the blessings</b> of the additional prayer, <b>and</b> only <b>afterward a <i>shofar</i> became available to him, he sounds</b> a <i>tekia</i>, <b>sounds</b> a <i>terua</i>, <b>and sounds</b> a <i>tekia</i>, an order he repeats <b>three times.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Just as the prayer leader is obligated</b> in the prayer of Rosh HaShana, <b>so too, each and every individual is obligated</b> in these prayers. <b>Rabban Gamliel</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> Individuals are not obligated, as <b>the prayer leader fulfills the obligation on behalf of the many.</b>

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara raises a difficulty. Although the mishna taught that the length of a <i>tekia</i> is equal to the length of three <i>teruot</i>, <b>isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>the length of a</b> single <b><i>tekia</i> is equal to</b> the length of an entire <b><i>terua</i>,</b> which is comprised of several shorter sounds? <b>Abaye said:</b> There is no difficulty. <b>The <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna <b>counts the <i>tekia</i> of all the sets</b> of blasts <b>and the <i>teruot</i> of all the sets.</b> He means that the length of the three <i>tekiot</i> is equal to the length of the three <i>teruot</i>. Conversely, <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>the <i>baraita</i> counts</b> the first <i>tekia</i> of only <b>one set, and no more,</b> and therefore he simply states that the length of one <i>tekia</i> is equal to the length of one <i>terua</i>.

### Part 9
§ The mishna continues. <b>The length of a <i>terua</i></b> is <b>equal to</b> the length of <b>three whimpers.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>the length of a <i>terua</i></b> is equal <b>to</b> the length of <b>three <i>shevarim</i>,</b> i.e., broken blasts, which presumably are longer than whimpers?

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said: In this</b> matter, the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>certainly disagree.</b> Although the first <i>baraita</i> can be reconciled with the mishna, this second <i>baraita</i> clearly reflects a dispute. <b>As it is written: “It is a day of sounding [<i>terua</i>]</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>to you”</b> (Numbers 29:1), <b>and we translate</b> this verse in Aramaic as: <b>It is a day of <i>yevava</i> to you. And</b> to define a <i>yevava</i>, the Gemara quotes a verse that <b>is written about the mother of Sisera: “Through the window she looked forth and wailed [<i>vateyabev</i>], the mother of Sisera”</b> (Judges 5:28). One <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that this means <b>moanings,</b> broken sighs, as in the blasts called <i>shevarim</i>. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna, <b>holds</b> that it means <b>whimpers,</b> as in the short blasts called <i>teruot</i>.

### Part 11
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the soundings of Rosh HaShana must be performed <b>with a <i>shofar</i>? The verse states: “Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the <i>shofar</i></b> on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement you shall make proclamation with the <i>shofar</i> throughout all your land” (Leviticus 25:9).

### Part 12
From this <b>I have</b> derived the <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to Yom Kippur <b>of the Jubilee Year. From where</b> do I derive that the soundings of <b>Rosh HaShana</b> must also be with a <i>shofar</i>? <b>The verse states: “Of the seventh month.” Since</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “Of the seventh month,”</b> as it already states: “On the Day of Atonement,” <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Of the seventh month”?</b> This comes to teach <b>that all</b> the obligatory <b>soundings of the seventh month must be similar to one another.</b>

### Part 13
This verse states: “The blast [<i>terua</i>] of the <i>shofar</i>,” indicating that one must sound a <i>terua</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the <i>terua</i> sound <b>is preceded by a straight blast,</b> i.e., a <i>tekia</i>? <b>The verse states: “Then you shall make proclamation with the blast of the <i>shofar</i> [<i>shofar terua</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 25:9), indicating that the <i>terua</i> must be preceded by the basic sound of a <i>shofar</i>, i.e., by the straight blast of a <i>tekia</i>. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the <i>terua</i> sound <b>is followed by a straight blast? The</b> same <b>verse states</b> again: <b>“You shall make proclamation with the <i>shofar</i>,”</b> which indicates that there must be another <i>tekia</i> after the <i>terua</i>.

### Part 14
The <i>baraita</i> continues. From this <b>I have</b> derived the <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> that these <i>tekia</i> blasts before and after the <i>terua</i> must be sounded on Yom Kippur <b>of the Jubilee Year. From where</b> do I derive that they must be sounded <b>on Rosh HaShana</b> as well? <b>The verse states: “Of the seventh month.”</b>
