### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>When Rabbi Abba returned from</b> his travels <b>at sea, he explained</b> the matter as follows: <b>The Sages concede to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel</b> with regard <b>to the blessings of Rosh HaShana and of Yom Kippur,</b> that in these cases the prayer leader fulfills the obligation on behalf of the many. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with Rabban Gamliel, which, <b>by inference,</b> indicates <b>that</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> still <b>disagree,</b> is referring <b>to the blessings of the entire year.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rabbi Ḥana from</b> the city of <b>Tzippori say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel with</b> regard to <b>the blessings of Rosh HaShana and of Yom Kippur?</b> Apparently, he holds that the <i>tanna’im</i> remain in dispute even with regard to these blessings.

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statements must be attributed to different Sages, as <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Who concedes</b> to the opinion of Rabban Gamliel? <b>Rabbi Meir. And</b> with regard to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with Rabban Gamliel, which, <b>by inference,</b> indicates <b>that</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> still <b>disagree,</b> this is referring to <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Meir.

### Part 4
The Gemara explains: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the blessings of Rosh HaShana and of Yom Kippur, the prayer leader fulfills the obligation on behalf of the many.</b> This is the <b>statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: Just as the prayer leader is obligated</b> in these prayers, <b>so too, every individual is obligated</b> to recite them on his own. Clearly, Rabbi Meir agrees with Rabban Gamliel with regard to the blessings of Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, while the Rabbis dispute this ruling.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>these</b> blessings of Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, that Rabbi Meir concedes to the opinion of Rabban Gamliel only with regard to them, but not about the blessings recited the rest of the year? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>due to the many verses</b> that are included in these blessings, this is difficult. <b>Didn’t Rav Ḥananel say</b> that <b>Rav said: Once one has recited</b> the line of the prayer: <b>And in Your Torah it is written, saying, it is no longer necessary</b> to recite the verses themselves. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>because there are many blessings,</b> and as the blessings are long, not everyone is capable of learning them by heart.

### Part 6
The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav Ḥananel said</b> that <b>Rav said: Once one has recited</b> the line of the prayer: <b>And in Your Torah it is written, saying, it is no longer necessary</b> to recite the verses themselves. The Gemara clarifies the scope of this ruling: Some <b>understood from this</b> that <b>it applies only to an individual; however,</b> with regard <b>to a congregation, no,</b> this is not the case. Nevertheless, <b>it is stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Both</b> with regard to <b>an individual and a congregation, once one has recited: And in Your Torah it is written, saying, it is no longer necessary</b> to recite the verses.

### Part 7
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar said: A person should always arrange his prayer</b> in his mind <b>and</b> only <b>then pray. Rabbi Abba said: Rabbi Elazar’s statement is reasonable</b> with regard <b>to the blessings of Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur and</b> in the case <b>of</b> prayers that are recited only <b>intermittently. However,</b> with regard <b>to</b> blessings recited <b>all year, no,</b> this practice is not necessary.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rav Yehuda</b> first <b>arrange his prayer</b> in his mind <b>and</b> only then <b>pray,</b> even on an ordinary day? The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yehuda was different, since he would pray</b> only once <b>every thirty days.</b> During the rest of the month he would not engage in prayer, as he was busy with Torah study. Therefore, for him even regular weekdays prayers were <b>like</b> prayers recited <b>intermittently.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Avira said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida said: Rabban Gamliel would</b> allow the prayer leader to <b>exempt even the people who were in the fields</b> and away from the synagogue. The Gemara challenges: This statement implies that the prayer leader exempts even the people in the fields, <b>and needless to say,</b> he exempts <b>those who are here</b> in the city but did not attend the prayer service in the synagogue.

### Part 10
The Gemara questions this conclusion: <b>On the contrary,</b> the opposite is more reasonable: <b>Those</b> in the fields did not come to the synagogue <b>due to circumstances beyond their control,</b> and therefore they should be allowed to fulfill their obligation through the prayer leader. By contrast, <b>those</b> in the city were <b>not</b> prevented from coming to the synagogue <b>due to circumstances beyond their control.</b> Consequently, they should not fulfill their obligation through the prayer leader.

### Part 11
<b>As Abba, son of Rav Binyamin bar Ḥiyya, taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Those <b>people</b> standing in the synagogue <b>behind the priests</b> during the Priestly Blessing, who are not positioned in front of them, face-to-face, <b>are not included in the blessing.</b> They are expected to make the minimal effort to stand in front of the priests. However, those in the fields are included in the Priestly Blessing.

### Part 12
<b>Rather,</b> Rabban Gamliel’s statement should be understood differently: <b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he reported that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon bar Ḥasida said: Rabban Gamliel</b> allowed the prayer leader to <b>exempt only the people in the fields. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Because</b> the people in the fields are unable to come to the synagogue <b>due to work circumstances beyond their control,</b> and do not have time to prepare their prayers. <b>However,</b> Rabban Gamliel did not exempt those <b>in the city</b> who do not come to the synagogue, as they are able to prepare their prayers and pray by themselves.
