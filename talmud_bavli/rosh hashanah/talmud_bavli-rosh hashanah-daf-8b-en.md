<b>on which the moon is covered,</b> i.e., hidden? <b>You must say</b> that <b>this is Rosh HaShana,</b> which is the only Festival that occurs at the beginning of a month, when the moon cannot be seen. <b>And it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“For this is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the God of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 81:5), implying that this is the day of judgment.

### Part 2
With regard to this same verse, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“For this is a statute for Israel, a judgment of the God of Jacob”; this teaches that the heavenly court does not assemble for judgment until the earthly court has sanctified the month,</b> once the Sanhedrin has declared that day as Rosh HaShana.

### Part 3
It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“For this is a statute for Israel.”</b> From here <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this is the day of judgment <b>for the Jewish people; from where</b> do I derive that it is also the day of judgment <b>for the</b> gentile <b>nations of the world?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “A judgment for the God of Jacob,”</b> Who rules over the entire world. <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “A statute for Israel”? This teaches that the Jewish people enter for judgment first.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara notes: This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda said:</b> When <b>a king and a community</b> are brought before God for judgment, the <b>king is brought in for judgment first, as it is stated:</b> “And let these my words, with which I have made supplication before the Lord, be near to the Lord our God day and night, that He make <b>the judgment of His servant and the judgment of His people</b> Israel at all times” (I Kings 8:59). This verse is from King Solomon’s prayer at the dedication of the Temple, and he is referring to himself a servant of God.

### Part 5
<b>What is the reason</b> that the king is brought in first? <b>If you wish, say</b> that it is <b>not proper conduct for the king to stand outside</b> and wait for the trial of his subjects to come to an end. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the king is brought in first so that he may be judged <b>before</b> God’s <b>anger intensifies</b> due to the sins of the community, and he may thereby be saved from overly harsh judgment.

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches: The first of Tishrei is also the New Year <b>for</b> calculating <b>Sabbatical Years.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “But in the seventh year shall be a Shabbat of solemn rest for the land”</b> (Leviticus 25:4), <b>and</b> we <b>learn</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> that the year begins for this purpose <b>from Tishrei, as it is written: “From the beginning of the year”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:12). The latter verse is referring to the year that begins at the onset of the rainy season, i.e., Tishrei.

### Part 7
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But let us learn</b> by way of a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“year”</b> and conclude that for this purpose the year begins <b>from Nisan, as it is written: “It shall be the first month of the year to you”</b> (Exodus 12:2), and there the reference is to Nisan. The Gemara answers: The Sages <b>derive</b> the meaning of the word <b>“year”</b> that appears in the verse about the Sabbatical Year, where <b>months are not</b> mentioned <b>with it, from</b> the word <b>“year”</b> that appears in the verse in Deuteronomy above, where <b>months</b> are also <b>not</b> mentioned <b>with it. And</b> they <b>do not derive</b> the meaning of the word <b>“year”</b> where <b>months are not</b> mentioned <b>with it from</b> the word <b>“year”</b> that appears in the verse where <b>months are</b> mentioned <b>with it,</b> i.e., “It shall be the first month of the year for you.”

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches: The first of Tishrei is also the New Year <b>for Jubilee Years.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> the New Year for <b>Jubilee Years on the first of Tishrei?</b> Isn’t the New Year for <b>Jubilee Years on the tenth of Tishrei,</b> Yom Kippur? <b>As it is written:</b> “Then shall you cause the <i>shofar</i> to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, <b>on Yom Kippur shall you sound the <i>shofar</i></b> throughout all your land. And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all its inhabitants; it shall be a Jubilee for you” (Leviticus 25:9–10).

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And you shall hallow the fiftieth year”? Since it is stated</b> that the <i>shofar</i> is blown <b>“on Yom Kippur,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the year <b>is sanctified only from Yom Kippur and onward. Therefore, the verse states: “And you shall hallow the fiftieth year,” which teaches that</b> the year <b>is sanctified from its beginning onward,</b> from the first of Tishrei, when the year begins.

### Part 10
<b>From here, Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, said: From Rosh HaShana until Yom Kippur</b> of the Jubilee Year, Hebrew <b>slaves were not released to their homes</b> because the <i>shofar</i> had not yet been sounded. <b>And they were</b> also <b>not enslaved to their masters,</b> as the Jubilee Year had already begun. <b>Rather, they would eat, drink, and rejoice, and</b> they would wear <b>their crowns on their heads</b> like free people. <b>Once Yom Kippur arrived, the court</b> would <b>sound the <i>shofar</i>, slaves</b> would be <b>released to their houses, and fields</b> that were sold would be <b>returned to their</b> original <b>owners.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, how do they interpret the verse: “And you shall hallow the fiftieth year”? The Gemara answers: They derive from here that <b>you sanctify years, but you do not sanctify months.</b> According to this opinion, the court is commanded to sanctify the Jubilee Year with a proclamation: This year is sanctified; but it is not commanded to sanctify the months with a similar proclamation.

### Part 12
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “It shall be a Jubilee Year”</b> (Leviticus 25:11)? <b>Since it is stated: “And you shall hallow the fiftieth year,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>just as</b> the Jubilee Year <b>is sanctified from its beginning onward, so too, it is sanctified at its end onward,</b> i.e., it remains sanctified until Yom Kippur of the fifty-first year. <b>And do not wonder</b> why one might think this, <b>as don’t we</b> regularly <b>add from the profane to the sacred,</b> extending a sacred time period by adding to it both before and after from a profane time period? <b>Therefore, the verse states: “It shall be a Jubilee Year, the fiftieth year,”</b> to teach that <b>you sanctify the fiftieth year, but you do not sanctify the fifty-first year,</b> even partially.
