### Part 1
§ The mishna stated: <b>One may not cut</b> the <i>shofar</i> if it needs to be prepared, <b>neither with an object that is prohibited due to a rabbinic decree nor with an object</b> that may not be used <b>due to</b> a Torah <b>prohibition.</b> The Gemara explains: An example of an object prohibited <b>due to a rabbinic decree</b> is <b>a sickle,</b> which is not ordinarily used for preparing a <i>shofar</i>; an example of an object that may not be used due to <b>a prohibition</b> by Torah law is <b>a knife.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that <b>you have said</b> that to sound the <i>shofar</i> <b>one may not</b> perform an action that is prohibited <b>due to rabbinic law, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that one may not perform an action that violates <b>a prohibition</b> by Torah law? The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>teaches</b> employing the style: <b>This, and it is unnecessary to say that.</b>

### Part 3
§ The mishna continues. <b>However, if one wishes to place water or wine into</b> the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh HaShana, so that it should emit a clear sound, <b>he may place it.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>Water or wine, yes,</b> one may insert these substances into a <i>shofar</i>. However, <b>urine,</b> whose acidity is good for the <i>shofar</i>, <b>no.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of <b>the mishna?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is Abba Shaul, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abba Shaul says:</b> With regard to <b>water or wine,</b> one is <b>permitted</b> to pour these liquids into a <i>shofar</i> on Rosh HaShana <b>in order to make</b> its sound <b>clear.</b> However, with regard to <b>urine,</b> one is <b>prohibited</b> to do so <b>due to the respect</b> that must be shown to the <i>shofar</i>. Although urine is beneficial, it is disrespectful to place it in a <i>shofar</i>, which serves for a mitzva.

### Part 5
§ The mishna further teaches: <b>One</b> need <b>not prevent children from sounding</b> the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh HaShana. The Gemara infers: If <b>women</b> wish to sound the <i>shofar</i>, <b>one</b> indeed <b>prevents</b> them from doing so. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>one does not prevent women or children from sounding</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>on a Festival?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Abaye said:</b> This is <b>not difficult: This</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> while <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon.</b>

### Part 6
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Speak to the children of Israel…</b>and he shall place his hands upon the head of the burnt-offering” (Leviticus 1:2–4). The phrase “children of Israel” literally means sons of Israel, and this teaches that <b>the sons of Israel place</b> their hands upon offerings, <b>but the daughters of Israel do not place</b> their hands upon offerings; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> It is <b>optional</b> for <b>women</b> to <b>place</b> their hands on the head of an offering before it is slaughtered, although they are not obligated to do so. Apparently, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon, if a woman wishes to perform any mitzva that is not obligatory for her, she is permitted to do so. Here too, one does not prevent a woman from sounding the <i>shofar</i>.

### Part 7
§ The mishna further states: <b>Rather, one occupies</b> himself <b>with them,</b> encouraging and instructing children, <b>until they learn</b> how to sound it properly. <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This applies <b>even</b> when Rosh HaShana occurs <b>on Shabbat. This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One occupies</b> himself <b>with</b> children <b>until they learn</b> to sound the <i>shofar</i> properly, <b>even on Shabbat. And one does not prevent the children from sounding</b> the <i>shofar</i> <b>on Shabbat, and needless to say</b> one does not prevent them <b>on</b> the <b>festival</b> of Rosh HaShana that occurs on a weekday.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>This matter itself is difficult,</b> i.e., there is an internal contradiction in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>You said</b> that <b>one occupies</b> himself <b>with</b> the children <b>until they learn</b> how to sound the <i>shofar</i>, <b>and</b> this applies <b>even on Shabbat. Apparently, we say to them <i>ab initio</i>: Sound</b> the <i>shofar</i>. <b>And then</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught: One does not prevent</b> them from sounding the <i>shofar</i>, which indicates that although <b>one does not prevent them</b> from sounding it, <b>we do not say <i>ab initio</i>: Sound</b> it.

### Part 9
The Gemara explains: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b>
