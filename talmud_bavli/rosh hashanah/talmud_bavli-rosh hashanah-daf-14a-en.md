### Part 1
The Gemara comments: It is <b>necessary</b> to state all three statements of Shmuel in order to clarify his position, <b>as had</b> Shmuel <b>taught us</b> only that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri, I would have said</b> that this is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he holds</b> that <b>there is mixing</b> even with regard to solids. Therefore, <b>he teaches us</b> the second statement, that <b>there is no mixing for anything</b> except wine, oil, and other liquids.

### Part 2
<b>And had</b> Shmuel <b>taught us</b> only that <b>there is no mixing for anything</b> except liquids, <b>I would have said</b> that <b>he holds like the Sages</b> with regard to tithes, that the mixture of cowpeas cannot be tithed together. Therefore, <b>he teaches us</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And had</b> Shmuel <b>taught us</b> only <b>these two</b> statements, <b>I would have said</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Zeira that it is <b>difficult</b> to reconcile one statement <b>of Shmuel with</b> another statement <b>of Shmuel.</b> Therefore, <b>he teaches us</b> that <b>in all</b> cases, the tithe year <b>follows</b> the time of <b>the full ripening of the produce,</b> and it is for this reason that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri.

### Part 4
<b>And had</b> Shmuel <b>taught us</b> only that <b>in all</b> cases the tithe year <b>follows</b> the time of <b>the full ripening of the produce, I would have said</b> that this applies <b>even</b> to <b>grain and olives.</b> Therefore, <b>he teaches us</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri with regard to his dispute</b> with the Sages, i.e., with regard to beans, but with regard to grain and olives the tithe year follows the time that they reach one-third of their growth.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>But let him teach us</b> only <b>these two</b> statements, that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri and that in all cases the tithe year follows the full ripening of the fruit, which would suffice to clarify Shmuel’s position. <b>Why do I</b> need to be told that <b>there is no mixing for anything?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> comes to <b>teach us</b> not that there is no mixing for solids, but <b>that there is mixing for wine, oil,</b> and other liquids.

### Part 6
§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says:</b> The verse states: <b>“After you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13). This teaches that <b>just as</b> the grain that is brought to the <b>threshing floor and</b> the wine that is brought to the <b>winepress are special in that they grow on the outgoing year’s water,</b> i.e., the moisture in the ground from the previous winter’s rain, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>they are tithed in accordance with the outgoing year, so too, anything that grows on the outgoing year’s water is tithed in accordance with the outgoing year.</b> This comes to <b>exclude vegetables, which grow on the incoming year’s water,</b> as their growth cycle is short and they are nurtured by the rain that falls while they are growing. Consequently, <b>they are tithed in accordance with the incoming year.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This is the way the verse should be expounded: <b>“After you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress”;</b> this teaches us that <b>just as</b> the grain that is brought to the <b>threshing floor and</b> the wine that is brought to the <b>winepress are special in that they grow on most water,</b> i.e., rainfall is sufficient and they do not require irrigation, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>they are tithed in accordance with the outgoing year, so too, anything that grows on most water is tithed in accordance with the outgoing year.</b> This comes to <b>exclude vegetables, which grow on all water,</b> i.e., they require irrigation as well. Consequently, they <b>are tithed in accordance with the incoming year.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Akiva? <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to <b>seedless onions and cowpeas, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Seedless onions,</b> which are cultivated for their greens and not for their bulbs or seeds, <b>and</b> the <b>cowpea</b> plant, which was planted to be eaten as a vegetable, <b>from which one withheld water for thirty days before Rosh HaShana,</b> so that their green portions stopped growing and they began to grow for seed, <b>are tithed in accordance with the outgoing year, and they are permitted</b> if the new year is <b>the Sabbatical Year. And if not, they are prohibited</b> if it is <b>the Sabbatical Year, and</b> in ordinary years <b>they are tithed in accordance with the incoming year.</b> Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> depends not on the species of plant but on whether the crop is in fact nurtured by the previous year’s water or the new year’s water, and this mishna is taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.

### Part 9
§ The mishna taught: <b>On the first of Shevat is the new year for trees,</b> according to the statement of Beit Shammai. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the new year for trees was set on this date? <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya said:</b> The reason is <b>since</b> by that time <b>most of the year’s rains have</b> already <b>fallen, and most of the season,</b> i.e., winter, <b>is yet to come,</b> as it continues until the spring equinox, which usually occurs in Nisan.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>What is he saying?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>This is what he said: Even though most of the</b> winter <b>season is yet to come,</b> nevertheless, <b>since most of</b> the <b>year’s rains have</b> already <b>fallen,</b> it is considered the end of the previous year of rain, and anything that grows from then on is considered produce of the next year.

### Part 11
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was once <b>an incident involving Rabbi Akiva, who picked an <i>etrog</i> on the first of Shevat and set aside two tithes.</b> This occurred in the second or the fifth year of the Sabbatical cycle. In the second and fifth years one sets aside second tithe, whereas in the third and sixth years one sets aside poor man’s tithe. Rabbi Akiva set aside both second tithe and poor man’s tithe because he was in doubt about the <i>halakha</i>.
