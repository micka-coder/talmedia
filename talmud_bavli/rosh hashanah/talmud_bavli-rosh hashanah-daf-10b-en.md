### Part 1
<b>is it not right that one day should count</b> as a full year <b>at the beginning</b> of the year?

### Part 2
<b>Rather, what</b> opinion does it follow? If the <i>baraita</i> was not taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, does it follow the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who holds that only thirty days are considered like a year? If so, then <b>thirty</b> days <b>and</b> another <b>thirty days are required:</b> Thirty days for the planting to take root, and another thirty days to count as a year. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One may not plant, layer, or graft</b> trees on the <b>eve of the Sabbatical Year less than thirty days before Rosh HaShana, and if one planted, layered, or grafted, he must be uproot</b> it, as the planting will take root only in the seventh year; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Elazar. Rabbi Yehuda says: Any grafting that does not take root within three days will never take root. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say: Two weeks</b> are needed for the planting to take root.

### Part 3
<b>And</b> on this topic <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: According to the statement of the one who says thirty</b> days, this means that <b>it requires thirty</b> days for the planting to take root <b>and</b> another <b>thirty</b> days to count as a year. <b>And according to the statement of the one who says three days,</b> this means that <b>it requires thirty-three days. And according to the statement of the one who says two weeks,</b> this means that <b>it requires two weeks</b> for the planting to take root <b>and</b> another <b>thirty days</b> to count as a year. And <b>if</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that only three days are needed for the planting to take root, <b>it</b> still <b>requires three</b> days for the planting to take root <b>and thirty</b> days to count as a year. If so, the <i>baraita</i> cannot be understood even in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar.

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> it must be understood as follows: The <i>baraita</i> was <b>actually</b> taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and when it says thirty</b> days, it is referring to the time needed for the planting <b>to take root.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, it requires thirty-one</b> days; thirty days for the planting to take root and one more day to count as a year. The Gemara answers: This is theoretically correct, but <b>he holds</b> that <b>the thirtieth day is counted for here and for there,</b> i.e., it counts as both the thirtieth day for taking root and as a day that is counted as a year.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And both of them,</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Elazar, who disagree about how much time must pass to count as a year, <b>expounded the same verse.</b> As the verse states: <b>“And it came to pass in the one and six hundredth year, in the first month on the first day of the month,</b> that the waters were dried up from off the earth” (Genesis 8:13). <b>Rabbi Meir holds: From the fact that it was</b> only <b>one day into the year,</b> as it was still the first day of the first month, <b>and</b> yet <b>it is called the</b> six hundred and first <b>year, learn from here</b> that <b>one day in a year is</b> already <b>considered a year.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Elazar, expounds the verse as follows. <b>If it had written: In the six hundred and first year,</b> it would be <b>as you said.</b> However, <b>now that it is written: “In the one and six hundredth year,"</b> I can say that the word <b>“year” relates to “six hundredth,”</b> thereby teaching that it is still considered the six hundredth year. And <b>what is</b> meant by <b>“one”?</b> That it is <b>the beginning of one</b> year, but not that the first day counts as a year.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Elazar, what is the rationale</b> for his opinion? From where does he learn that thirty days are counted as a year? <b>As it is written: “In the first month on the first day of the month.” Since it was</b> only <b>one day into the month, and</b> yet <b>it is called a month, learn from here</b> that <b>one day in a month is</b> already <b>considered a month. And since one day in a month is</b> already considered <b>a month,</b> likewise <b>thirty days in a year are</b> already <b>considered a year, as a month</b> is calculated according <b>to its unit, and a year</b> is calculated according <b>to its unit.</b> If one unit by which a month is calculated, i.e., a day, counts as a full month, so too, one unit by which a year is calculated, i.e., a month, counts as a full year.

### Part 9
§ The Gemara comments: <b>By inference, both of them,</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Elazar, <b>hold</b> that <b>the world was created in Nisan</b> and that the years are counted from that month, as, if the world were created in Tishrei and the count started then, the first day of the first month of the six hundred and first year would already have been six months into the year for the purpose of counting years.

### Part 10
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the <i>tanna’im</i> disagreed about this point: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: In Tishrei the world was created; in Tishrei the Patriarchs were born; in Tishrei the Patriarchs died; on Passover Isaac was born; on Rosh HaShana Sarah, Rachel, and Hannah were remembered</b> by God and conceived; <b>on Rosh HaShana Joseph came out from prison;</b>
