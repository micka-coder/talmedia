### Part 1
<b>it</b> follows some <b>other count. Rav Pappa said:</b> The meaning of the first instance of the expression <b>“the twentieth year”</b> may be inferred from the second instance of the expression <b>“the twentieth year” by way of a verbal analogy: Just as there</b> the reference is to the twentieth year <b>of Artaxerxes, so too, here</b> the reference is to the twentieth year <b>of Artaxerxes.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara raises another question: Even though those two events took place in the same year, <b>from where</b> is it known <b>that the incident</b> that occurred <b>in Kislev took place first? Perhaps the incident</b> that occurred <b>in Nisan took place first,</b> in which case it is possible that even the years of gentile kings are counted from Nisan.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The words that Hanani told Nehemiah in</b> the month of <b>Kislev, Nehemiah told the king in</b> the month of <b>Nisan.</b>

### Part 4
The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>The words that Hanani said to</b> Nehemiah <b>in Kislev</b> are <b>as it is stated: “The words of Nehemiah, son of Hachaliah: And it came to pass in the month Kislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the capital, that Hanani, one of my brothers, came out of Judah, he and certain men; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. And they said to me: The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province suffer much hardship and insult; and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire”</b> (Nehemiah 1:1–3).

### Part 5
<b>Nehemiah told these</b> words <b>to the king in Nisan, as it is stated: “And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him, and I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been before sad in his presence. And the king said to me: Why is your face sad, seeing that you are not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of the heart. Then I was very much afraid, and I said to the king: Let the king live forever: Why should not my face be sad, when the city, the place of the tombs of my ancestors, lies waste, and its gates are consumed with fire?”</b> (Nehemiah 2:1–3).

### Part 6
<b>“Then the king said to me: For what do you ask? So I prayed to the God of heaven. And I said to the king: If it please the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you would send me to Judea, to the city of the graves of my ancestors, that I may rebuild it. And the king said to me, the consort also sitting by him: For how long shall your journey be? And when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time”</b> (Nehemiah 2:4–6).

### Part 7
<b>Rav Yosef raised an objection</b> against the rule established by Rav Ḥisda that the years of gentile kings are counted from Tishrei from the verse that states: <b>“On the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king”</b> (Haggai 1:15), <b>and it is written</b> immediately afterward: <b>“In the seventh month, in the second year, on the twenty-first day of the month,</b> the word of the Lord came by the prophet Haggai, saying” (Haggai 2:1). <b>And if it were so</b> that the years of gentile kings are counted from Tishrei, <b>what</b> the verse <b>needed</b> to state is: <b>In the seventh month in the third year,</b> as a new year had already started for him.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> in answer to this objection: <b>Cyrus was a virtuous king,</b> and <b>consequently</b> Haggai <b>counted</b> the years <b>of his</b> reign <b>like</b> those of <b>the kings of Israel,</b> i.e., from Nisan.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Yosef strongly objects to this</b> explanation for two reasons: <b>One</b> objection is <b>that if</b> this is <b>so, the verses contradict each other, as it is written: “And this house was finished on the third of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king”</b> (Ezra 6:15), <b>and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>At that same time in the following year Ezra went up from Babylonia together with his</b> company of <b>exiles. And it is written</b> in the Bible: <b>“And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king”</b> (Ezra 7:8). <b>And if it were so</b> that this king’s years were counted like those of the kings of Israel, <b>what</b> the verse <b>needed</b> to state is: Which was in <b>the eighth year</b> of the king.

### Part 10
<b>And further,</b> a second objection: <b>Are</b> Rav Yosef’s objection and Rabbi Abbahu’s resolution <b>comparable? There,</b> Rabbi Abbahu speaks of <b>Cyrus,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> the verses speak of <b>Darius,</b> and it was never said about Darius that he was a virtuous king. The Gemara explains: This is not difficult, as the Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: All three names are referring to the same person: <b>He is Cyrus; he is Darius;</b> and <b>he is</b> also <b>Artaxerxes.</b> He was called <b>Cyrus [<i>Koresh</i>] because he was a virtuous [<i>kasher</i>] king;</b> he was called <b>Artaxerxes after his kingdom,</b> i.e., this was his royal title; <b>and what was his</b> real <b>name? Darius was his name.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara notes: <b>In any case, it is difficult,</b> as in one place his years are counted from Nisan, whereas in another place they are counted from Tishrei. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as it can be explained as follows: <b>Here,</b> where his years are counted from Nisan like the kings of Israel, it speaks of him <b>before he became corrupt,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> where his years are counted from Tishrei, it speaks of him <b>after he became corrupt.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Kahana strongly objects to this</b> explanation: <b>Did he</b> really <b>become corrupt</b> after Ezra went to Eretz Yisrael? <b>But isn’t it written:</b>
