### Part 1
With regard to <b>the blessing over bread</b> that is recited before eating <b><i>matza</i></b> at the Passover seder <b>and the blessing over wine</b> recited as part <b>of the sanctification of the day</b> of Shabbat or a Festival, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara analyzes the question: Do we say that <b>since there is an obligation</b> to recite these blessings due to the mitzva involved, therefore <b>one can discharge</b> the obligation for others, even if he himself has already fulfilled his obligation? <b>Or perhaps</b> we say that <b>the blessing</b> itself <b>is not an obligation,</b> but rather the obligation lies in the eating and drinking, and the blessing is recited over oneâ€™s physical enjoyment; therefore, if he already fulfilled his own obligation, he cannot recite the blessing for others, as he derives no pleasure at this time.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer to this question from what <b>Rav Ashi said: When we were</b> studying <b>in the school of Rav Pappi, he would recite <i>kiddush</i> for us, and when his tenants would arrive from the field he would recite <i>kiddush</i></b> once again <b>on their behalf.</b> Therefore, it is clear that one may recite <i>kiddush</i> on behalf of others, including the blessing that is recited over the wine, even if he himself has already fulfilled his own obligation.

### Part 3
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One should not break bread</b> and recite a blessing <b>for guests unless he is eating with them,</b> so that he is obligated to recite a blessing for himself. <b>But he may break</b> bread <b>for his children and for</b> the other <b>members of his household</b> and recite the blessing, <b>in order to educate them to</b> perform <b>the mitzvot,</b> so that they know how to recite a blessing. <b>And with regard to <i>hallel</i> and the Scroll</b> of Esther, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>even if he</b> already <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>he can</b> still <b>discharge</b> the obligation of others.
