### Part 1
<b>But if you say</b> that the Adar immediately preceding Nisan is <b>always short, why should they desecrate</b> Shabbat? The court can calculate the time of the New Moon without witnesses. The Gemara answers: <b>Because it is a mitzva to sanctify</b> the New Moon <b>on the basis of</b> the testimony of witnesses who actually <b>saw</b> the new moon and not rely on calculations or established practices.

### Part 2
<b>Some say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said: We, too, learn</b> in a mishna: Witnesses who saw the new moon <b>may desecrate Shabbat</b> to establish the New Moon for <b>two months, for</b> the month of <b>Nisan and for</b> the month of <b>Tishrei. Granted, if you say</b> that the Adar immediately preceding Nisan is <b>always short, due to that</b> reason the witnesses <b>may desecrate</b> Shabbat, <b>because it is a mitzva to sanctify</b> the month <b>on the basis of</b> the testimony of witnesses who actually <b>saw</b> the new moon.

### Part 3
<b>But if you say</b> that the Adar immediately preceding Nisan <b>is sometimes full</b> and <b>sometimes short,</b> and there is no regularity to it, <b>why should</b> the witnesses <b>desecrate</b> Shabbat? Have the court <b>add</b> an extra day to the month <b>now,</b> since it can decide whether the thirtieth day or the thirty-first day is the beginning of the new month, <b>and</b> let the members of the court <b>sanctify the next day</b> as the New Moon.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>If the thirtieth</b> of Adar <b>falls on Shabbat, this</b> is <b>indeed</b> what is done. The witnesses are not permitted to desecrate Shabbat. Rather, the month is made full and the next day is sanctified as the New Moon. <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case where the <b>thirty-first</b> of Adar <b>falls on Shabbat,</b> and so the sanctification of the New Moon cannot be pushed off to the next day, as a month cannot be longer than thirty days. In that case, the witnesses may desecrate Shabbat <b>because it is a mitzva to sanctify</b> the month based <b>on</b> testimony of witnesses who actually <b>saw</b> the new moon.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Kahana raised an objection</b> from the continuation of the mishna, which teaches: <b>When the Temple was standing,</b> the witnesses <b>would desecrate</b> Shabbat <b>for</b> establishing the New Moon <b>even</b> for <b>all</b> the months, <b>in order to rectify the offering</b> of the New Moon, i.e., ensure that it is at the proper time.

### Part 6
<b>From</b> the fact that the reason that the witnesses are permitted to desecrate Shabbat for <b>all</b> the other months is <b>not because it is a mitzva to sanctify</b> the month based <b>on</b> testimony of witnesses who <b>saw</b> the new moon, the implication is that with regard to <b>Nisan and Tishrei as well,</b> the witnesses are permitted to desecrate Shabbat for another reason and <b>not because it is a mitzva to sanctify</b> the month based <b>on</b> the testimony of witnesses who <b>saw</b> the new moon.

### Part 7
<b>Granted, if you say</b> that Adar <b>is sometimes full and sometimes short, due to that</b> reason the witnesses <b>may desecrate</b> Shabbat. <b>But if you say</b> that Adar <b>is always short, why should they desecrate</b> Shabbat? The court knows in advance when will be the New Moon of Nisan. The Gemara concludes: This is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation</b> to the proof brought by Rav Naḥman.

### Part 8
§ It is related that <b>when Ulla came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said:</b> This year <b>they added</b> an extra day to the month of <b>Elul. Ulla</b> continued and <b>said: Do our Babylonian colleagues understand what benefit we did for them?</b> We pushed off Rosh HaShana for a day, so that the Festival would not occur adjacent to Shabbat.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <b>benefit</b> in having a weekday between Shabbat and a Festival? <b>Ulla said: Due to the vegetables</b> that would not be picked for two days and those picked beforehand that would no longer be fresh. <b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina said: Due to the dead</b> who would not be buried for two days and consequently would begin to decompose.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these two concerns? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them</b> is in the case where <b>Yom Kippur occurs</b> directly <b>after Shabbat.</b> According to <b>the one who said</b> that the reason is <b>due to the dead</b> that would go unburied for two days, the court <b>adds</b> an extra day to Elul so that Yom Kippur will not occur on Sunday. <b>But</b> according to <b>the one who said</b> that the reason is <b>due to the vegetables</b> that would not be fresh, there is no need to add an extra day to Elul. <b>When would he require</b> the vegetables? Only <b>in the evening</b> following Yom Kippur; and if Yom Kippur falls on Sunday, he can go out <b>in the evening</b> after the fast <b>and bring</b> fresh vegetables.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to the one who says</b> that the reason is <b>due to vegetables,</b> the court <b>should</b> still <b>make</b> Elul <b>full due to the dead,</b> as this is also an important consideration. <b>Rather,</b> the practical difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to the case where <b>the Festival</b> of Rosh HaShana <b>occurs adjacent to Shabbat, either before it or after it.</b> According to <b>the one who said</b> that the reason is <b>due to the vegetables</b> that would wither, the court <b>adds</b> an extra day to Elul. <b>But</b> according to <b>the one who said</b> that the reason is <b>due to the dead</b> that would go unburied, there is no reason to make Elul full, because on a Festival <b>it is possible</b> to arrange that the dead be buried <b>by gentiles.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to the one who said</b> that the reason is <b>due to the dead,</b> the court <b>should</b> still <b>add</b> an extra day to Elul <b>due to the vegetables.</b> The Gemara answers: According to him this is not an important consideration, <b>because it is possible</b> to soak the withered vegetables <b>in hot water</b> and thereby restore their freshness.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what is different</b> about those who live in Babylonia and those who live in Eretz Yisrael? Why did Ulla specifically say that adding an extra day to Elul was beneficial <b>to us,</b> in Babylonia; it was beneficial <b>to them as well.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>For us</b> in Babylonia the weather <b>is</b> very <b>hot,</b> and so vegetables wither and corpses decompose quickly. But <b>for them</b> in Eretz Yisrael, the weather <b>is not</b> as <b>hot,</b> and vegetables and corpses can be kept for two days.

### Part 14
§ It was taught above that for various reasons a month can have an extra day added, even if the new moon was seen on the night before the thirtieth. The Gemara challenges this assumption: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabba bar Shmuel teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that just as</b> the court <b>adds</b> an extra month to <b>a year for</b> some pressing communal <b>need, so too,</b> the court <b>adds</b> an extra day to <b>a month for</b> some similar <b>need.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This month shall be to you the beginning of months”</b> (Exodus 12:2). This teaches that when there is a moon <b>like this, see</b> it <b>and sanctify</b> the month. When the new moon is seen, the month must be sanctified without delay.

### Part 15
<b>Rava said: This</b> is <b>not difficult: Here</b> it is speaking of <b>adding</b> an extra day to the month, although the new moon was seen on the thirtieth, which is permitted; whereas <b>there</b> it is speaking of <b>sanctifying</b> the month on the thirtieth, although the new moon was not yet seen, which is prohibited. <b>And this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that just</b> the court <b>adds to a year or a month for</b> some pressing communal <b>need, so too, a month can be sanctified</b> early on the thirtieth even without seeing the new moon. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This month shall be to you the beginning of months,”</b> which teaches: Only when the moon appears <b>like this, see</b> it <b>and sanctify</b> the month, but not before.

### Part 16
The Gemara comments that this is <b>like that which Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> The court <b>may intimidate witnesses</b> through rigorous and confusing examination, so that they will give inadmissible testimony <b>about the</b> new <b>moon that was seen at its</b> due <b>time,</b> the thirtieth of the month. This is so that the court <b>can add</b> an extra day to <b>it,</b> and the New Moon will be sanctified on the thirty-first day. <b>But</b> the court <b>may not intimidate witnesses</b> into giving testimony <b>about the new moon that was not seen on its</b> due <b>time, in order that to sanctify</b> the New Moon early, on the thirtieth.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Yehuda Nesia,</b> who was the <i>Nasi</i> of the Sanhedrin, <b>send</b> a message <b>to Rabbi Ami: Be aware that all the days of Rabbi Yoḥanan he would teach us</b> that <b>witnesses may be intimidated</b> into giving testimony <b>about the</b> new <b>moon that was not seen in its</b> due <b>time.</b> This was done <b>in order that</b> the new month <b>may be sanctified</b> early, already on the thirtieth. <b>Although</b> the witnesses <b>did not see</b> the moon, <b>they may say: We saw it.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Abaye said: This</b> is <b>not difficult: This</b> ruling <b>is referring to Nisan and Tishrei,</b> which may be sanctified early in order to set the Festivals that occur in those months; <b>that</b> ruling is referring to <b>the other months,</b> which may not be sanctified early, even for some other pressing need.

### Part 19
<b>Rava said: That which Rabba bar Shmuel taught,</b> that the court may not lengthen or shorten the months for reason of communal need, follows the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say: The</b> difference <b>between</b> the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> of one year and the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> of the following year, <b>and</b> similarly, <b>between Rosh HaShana</b> of one year and <b>Rosh HaShana</b> of the following year, <b>is only four days</b> of the week. There are 354 days in a lunar year, which are divided into twelve alternating months, six months that are thirty days long and six months that are twenty-nine days long. Therefore, every year is fifty weeks and four days long. <b>And if it was a leap year,</b> in which case the year is comprised of 383 days, or fifty-four weeks and five days, there is a difference of <b>five</b> days between them.

### Part 20
<b>Rav Dimi from Neharde’a taught</b> the <i>baraita</i> in <b>the opposite</b> manner: The court <b>may intimidate the witnesses</b> into giving testimony <b>about the new moon that was not seen in its</b> due <b>time in order that</b> the new month <b>may be sanctified</b> early, already on the thirtieth. <b>But</b> the court <b>may not intimidate witnesses</b> so that they do not give acceptable testimony <b>about the</b> new <b>moon that was seen in its</b> due <b>time,</b> in order <b>to add</b> an extra day to the old month, so that the New Moon is sanctified on the thirty-first.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for Rav Dimi’s opinion? Intimidating witnesses into testifying about something that they did not see is worse than intimidating them to withhold testimony about something that they did see.
