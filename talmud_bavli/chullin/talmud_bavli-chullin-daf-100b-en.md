### Part 1
<b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that it is referring to a case where <b>he did not first remove</b> the piece of non-kosher meat or fish. Nevertheless, this <b>is</b> a case of a mixture of one <b>type</b> of food <b>with</b> its <b>own type</b> of food <b>and</b> with <b>something else,</b> i.e., the spices and broth in the pot.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> in <b>any</b> case of <b>a type</b> of forbidden food mixed with <b>its own type</b> of food <b>and</b> with <b>something else, disregard</b> the food that is <b>its own type, as though it is not</b> present in the mixture, <b>and</b> if the amount of permitted food <b>that is not its own type is</b> sixty times <b>greater than</b> the forbidden food, the permitted food <b>nullifies it.</b> Rav’s ruling applies to a case where the forbidden piece of meat or fish imparts flavor to another piece before the spices and broth are added, and there is a total volume sixty times greater than the original non-kosher piece. Consequently, even if the amount of spices and broth is eventually sixty times greater than the original non-kosher piece of meat or fish, the entire mixture is forbidden, as the spices and broth are not sixty times greater than the two pieces of meat or fish which are now non-kosher.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve <b>applies to a kosher</b> animal <b>and does not apply to a non-kosher</b> animal. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It applies <b>even to a non-kosher</b> animal. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> in explanation: <b>Wasn’t the sciatic nerve forbidden for the children of Jacob,</b> as it is written: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve” (Genesis 32:33), <b>yet</b> the meat of <b>a non-kosher animal was still permitted to them?</b> Since the sciatic nerve of non-kosher animals became forbidden at that time, it remains forbidden now. The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: The prohibition <b>was stated in Sinai, but</b> it <b>was written in its place,</b> in the battle of Jacob and the angel despite the fact that the prohibition did not take effect then.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yehuda hold</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the carcass of a non-kosher bird renders</b> the <b>garments</b> of one who swallows it <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat,</b> similar to the carcass of a kosher bird.

### Part 5
Therefore <b>the verse states</b> concerning the impurity of carcasses of birds: <b>“A carcass, or that which is torn of animals, he shall not eat to defile himself with it”</b> (Leviticus 22:8). The verse indicates that only <b>those</b> birds <b>that are forbidden</b> specifically <b>due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat</b> of <b>a carcass,</b> i.e., kosher birds that died without ritual slaughter, cause impurity in this manner. This serves to <b>exclude</b> any bird <b>that is not forbidden due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat</b> of <b>a carcass,</b> but <b>rather due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat a non-kosher</b> bird. This indicates that according to Rabbi Yehuda, the prohibition of eating a carcass does not take effect with regard to a non-kosher bird, because it is already subject to a different prohibition.

### Part 6
The Gemara continues with its question: <b>And if you would say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> that sciatic <b>nerves do not impart flavor,</b> i.e., they do not have flavor and therefore are not classified as food, <b>and even with regard to a non-kosher</b> animal it is prohibited to eat the sciatic nerve because the general <b>prohibition</b> of eating <b>a sciatic nerve applies,</b> whereas the <b>prohibition</b> of eating <b>non-kosher</b> animals <b>does not</b> apply because the sciatic nerve is not considered food, this is untenable.

### Part 7
The Gemara explains: <b>And does Rabbi Yehuda hold</b> that sciatic <b>nerves do not impart flavor? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who eats the sciatic nerve of a non-kosher animal, Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes, one for eating the sciatic nerve and one for eating the meat of a non-kosher animal, <b>and Rabbi Shimon exempts</b> him entirely from lashes. This indicates that Rabbi Yehuda holds that the sciatic nerve does have flavor.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> that sciatic <b>nerves do impart flavor, and he</b> also <b>holds</b> that the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve <b>applies to</b> the sciatic nerve of an animal <b>fetus.</b> Consequently, although Rabbi Yehuda holds that a prohibition does not take effect where another already exists, one who eats the sciatic nerve of a non-kosher animal is flogged twice, <b>because the prohibition of</b> eating a sciatic <b>nerve and the prohibition of</b> eating meat from <b>a non-kosher</b> animal <b>come</b> into effect <b>at the same time.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>And can you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda holds that the prohibition of eating a sciatic nerve <b>applies to</b> the sciatic nerve of <b>a fetus? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (89b): The prohibition <b>applies to</b> a late-term <b>fetus</b> in the womb. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: It does not apply to a fetus, and</b> similarly the <b>fat</b> of a fetus <b>is permitted?</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>This statement,</b> that the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve does not apply to a fetus, is <b>with regard to a kosher</b> species of animal, <b>because the Merciful One stated</b> in the Torah: “And <b>every</b> animal that divides the hoof, and has the hoof wholly cloven in two, and chews the cud, <b>among the animals [<i>babehema</i>],</b> that <b>you may eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:6). The term <i>babehema</i> may also be translated as: Inside the animals, indicating that anything inside a kosher animal when it is slaughtered is permitted for consumption, including all parts of a fetus. <b>But with regard to a non-kosher</b> species of animal the prohibition <b>applies.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges the assertion that the prohibitions of eating the sciatic nerve and of eating non-kosher meat take effect at the same time. <b>And can you say</b> that <b>they both come</b> into effect <b>at the same time? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 49b): <b>A nazirite shaves for</b> having become impure from <b>these</b> following sources of <b>ritual impurity: For</b> having become impure with impurity imparted by <b>a corpse; and for</b> impurity imparted by <b>an olive-bulk of a corpse.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And</b> this poses <b>a difficulty for us:</b> If a nazirite <b>shaves for</b> becoming impure from <b>an olive-bulk of a corpse,</b> is it <b>not</b> obvious that <b>all the more so</b> he must shave <b>for</b> becoming impure from <b>an entire corpse? And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It <b>is necessary only with regard to a miscarried fetus whose limbs have not</b> yet <b>become joined to</b> its <b>sinews.</b> Although the fetus does not yet contain an olive-bulk of flesh, since it is a complete entity, it transmits impurity to anything under the same roof. <b>Evidently,</b> the limbs of the body are formed before the nerves and sinews, and therefore the <b>prohibition of</b> eating <b>non-kosher</b> meat takes effect <b>prior</b> to the prohibition of the sciatic nerve.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>Even though the prohibition</b> of eating <b>non-kosher</b> meat takes effect <b>prior</b> to the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve, the <b>prohibition of</b> the sciatic <b>nerve</b> also <b>comes and takes effect upon</b> a non-kosher animal <b>because</b> this <b>prohibition applies to descendants of Noah,</b> i.e., to gentiles. Since the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve adds an additional stringency that did not exist with regard to non-kosher meat, it takes effect even though there was an already existing prohibition.

### Part 14
According to this answer, the language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches: Rabbi Yehuda said: Wasn’t the sciatic nerve forbidden for the children of Jacob,</b> as it is written: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve” (Genesis 32:33), <b>yet</b> the meat of <b>a non-kosher animal was still permitted to them?</b> This indicates that the basis of Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is the fact that the sciatic nerve was forbidden to the children of Jacob, who had the status of descendants of Noah.

### Part 15
§ The Gemara returns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> cited above. With regard to <b>one who eats the sciatic nerve of a non-kosher animal, Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes: One for eating the sciatic nerve and one for eating the meat of a non-kosher animal;
