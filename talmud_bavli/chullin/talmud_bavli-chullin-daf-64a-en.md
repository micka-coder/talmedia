<b>fish embryos,</b> i.e., fish eggs found in the fish’s innards.

### Part 2
The Gemara continues: <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>about eggs</b> that <b>these are the signs of</b> bird <b>eggs: Any</b> egg <b>that narrows</b> at the top <b>and is rounded,</b> so that <b>one of its ends is rounded and</b> the other <b>one of its ends is pointed, is kosher.</b> If <b>both of its ends are rounded or both of its ends are pointed,</b> they are <b>non-kosher.</b> If the <b>albumen</b> is <b>on the outside and</b> the <b>yolk on the inside,</b> it is <b>kosher.</b> If the <b>yolk</b> is <b>on the outside and</b> the <b>albumen on the inside,</b> it is <b>non-kosher.</b> If the <b>yolk and albumen are mixed with each other, it is certainly the egg of a creeping animal.</b> Therefore, if it is possible to recognize a kosher egg by these signs, there is no need to rely on the gentile.

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> if the eggs have already been <b>cut</b> and one cannot know their original shape. The Gemara challenges: <b>But let him inspect the yolk and the albumen,</b> to see which is inside and which is outside. The Gemara responds: The <i>baraita</i> deals <b>with</b> a case where the eggs are <b>mixed in a bowl,</b> and it is impossible to discern this.

### Part 4
The Gemara counters: <b>But in a case like this,</b> where the eggs are mixed, <b>may we buy</b> eggs <b>from them? Isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may sell the egg of a <i>tereifa</i></b> bird <b>to a gentile only if it is mixed in a bowl; therefore, one may not buy eggs mixed in a bowl from them,</b> because they may be from <i>tereifot</i>? If so, it cannot be that the <i>baraita</i> deals with a case where they are mixed, and one should be able to inspect the yolk and albumen.

### Part 5
<b>Rather, Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The <b>signs</b> of a kosher egg <b>are not</b> valid <b>by Torah law. As, if you do not say so,</b> one encounters difficulty with <b>that which Rav Asi says: There are eight</b> birds whose kosher status is <b>uncertain.</b> Why is there uncertainty? <b>Let one inspect their eggs</b> for the signs listed in the <i>baraita</i> to determine whether they are kosher. <b>Rather, learn from it</b> that the <b>signs are not</b> valid <b>by Torah law</b> and one may not rely on them.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if one may not rely on these signs, <b>with regard to what <i>halakha</i> is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaching</b> them? The Gemara responds: <b>This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If <b>both of its ends are rounded, or both its ends are pointed, or</b> the <b>yolk</b> is <b>on the outside and</b> the <b>albumen</b> is <b>on the inside,</b> it is <b>certainly non-kosher.</b> But if <b>one of its ends is pointed</b> and <b>one of its ends is rounded, and</b> the <b>albumen</b> is <b>on the outside and</b> the <b>yolk on the inside, and</b> the gentile <b>says to you</b> that it is <b>from such and such bird, and</b> that bird <b>is kosher, rely on</b> the signs. But if he offers <b>no specification</b> of the type of bird, or if one simply finds eggs with these signs, <b>do not rely on them, since there are crow’s</b> eggs <b>that resemble those of a pigeon.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said:</b> If the <b>albumen and yolk are mixed with each other, it is certainly the egg of a creeping animal</b> and not of a non-kosher bird. The Gemara asks: <b>For what <i>halakha</i></b> is this information necessary? Either way, the egg is forbidden. <b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> means <b>to say that if tissue</b> of an embryo <b>developed [<i>rikema</i>]</b> inside it <b>and it was perforated,</b> and one touched it, <b>it transmits ritual impurity</b> provided <b>that</b> the embryo is at least the size <b>of a lentil-bulk,</b> because the carcass of a creeping animal of this size is a source of ritual impurity.

### Part 8
<b>Ravina objects to this: But perhaps it is</b> the egg <b>of a snake,</b> whose carcass does not transmit ritual impurity, even though the albumen and yolk of its eggs are mixed together. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> does not teach about ritual impurity, but rather <b>that if tissue</b> of an embryo <b>developed</b> inside the egg <b>and one ate it, he is flogged on its account, due to</b> the prohibition: “And every <b>swarming thing that swarms upon the earth</b> is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41).

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why specifically</b> mention the egg <b>of a non-kosher</b> creeping animal? The same would apply <b>even</b> for one who eats the embryo <b>of a kosher</b> bird <b>as well.</b> In either case, one is flogged, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“Every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth,”</b>
