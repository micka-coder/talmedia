<b>but they do not have</b> the capacity to effect a halakhic status by means of <b>thought.</b>

### Part 2
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ami: With regard to a case of effecting a halakhic status by means of <b>thought alone,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>does not raise a dilemma. When he raises a dilemma,</b> it is with regard to a case where <b>his thought is discernible from his actions.</b>

### Part 3
<b>For example,</b> in a case <b>where</b> an animal that is brought as <b>a burnt offering was standing in the south</b> of the Temple courtyard <b>and</b> a minor <b>took it to the north</b> of the courtyard, the designated place for its slaughter, <b>and slaughtered it</b> there, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Can one conclude <b>from</b> the fact <b>that he took it to the north and slaughtered</b> it there that <b>he had</b> the <b>intent to</b> slaughter the animal for the sake of a burnt offering; <b>or perhaps</b> he moved the animal to the north because <b>a place did not happen</b> to be available <b>for him</b> in the south?

### Part 4
Rabbi Ami asked: But with regard to <b>this</b> matter, <b>too, Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> already <b>said</b> a conclusive resolution <b>one time, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 6:1): In the case of <b>one who takes his produce up to the roof</b> to protect it <b>from insects, and dew fell upon it,</b> the produce <b>is not in</b> the category of the verse: “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed” (Leviticus 11:38), from which it is derived that produce becomes susceptible to ritual impurity only if it is dampened by one of seven liquids and its owner was agreeable to its dampening. <b>And if</b> after taking the produce up to the roof <b>he intended</b> that the produce would be dampened by dew, the produce <b>is in</b> the category of the verse “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed.”

### Part 5
That mishna continues: In a case where <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor took</b> the produce <b>up</b> to the roof, <b>even if they intended</b> that the produce would be dampened by dew, the produce <b>is not in</b> the category of the verse “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed” <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that they have</b> the capacity to perform <b>an action but they do not have</b> the capacity for halakhically effective <b>thought.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the minor <b>did not turn them over. But</b> if <b>he turned them over,</b> indicating that he wants them to be dampened by the dew, the produce <b>is in</b> the category of the verse “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed.” Evidently, Rabbi Yoḥanan rules that when the intention of a minor is apparent from his actions, it is halakhically effective.

### Part 7
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to Rabbi Ami that <b>this</b> is <b>the dilemma</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raises:</b> In a case where the intent of a minor is clear from his actions, is the fact that his thought is effective <b>by Torah law or by rabbinic law?</b> That is one version of the exchange between Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and Rabbi Ami.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak teaches</b> their exchange in <b>this</b> manner. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a minor, does he have</b> the capacity to perform <b>an action</b> that is halakhically effective <b>or does he not have</b> the capacity to perform such <b>an action?</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Ami said to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raise this dilemma</b> with regard to the <b>thought</b> of a minor. <b>What is different</b> about the <b>thought</b> of a minor <b>that</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>does not raise a dilemma?</b> Is it due to the fact <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 17:15): A deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor <b>do not have</b> the capacity for effective <b>thought?</b> With regard to <b>action as well let him not raise this dilemma, as we learned</b> in the same mishna: <b>They have</b> the capacity to perform <b>an action.</b>

### Part 10
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to Rabbi Ami that <b>this</b> is <b>the dilemma</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raises:</b> Is the fact that their actions are effective and their thought is ineffective <b>by Torah law,</b> and a minor’s action would consequently be effective even with regard to the sacrifice of a burnt offering, <b>or</b> is this fact <b>by rabbinic law</b> and it is merely a stringency? <b>And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>resolves</b> the dilemma: <b>They have</b> the capacity to perform <b>an action and</b> it is effective, <b>even by Torah law.</b> But <b>they do not have</b> the capacity for effective <b>thought, even by rabbinic law.</b> Nevertheless, in a case where <b>his thought is apparent from his actions, by Torah law he does not have</b> effective thought, and <b>by rabbinic law he has</b> effective thought.

### Part 11
§ <b>Shmuel asked Rav Huna: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who acts unawares in</b> the slaughter of <b>sacrificial</b> animals, i.e., he slaughtered without intending to perform the act of slaughter at all, <b>that</b> the offering <b>is disqualified?</b> Rav Huna said to him that it is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter the young bull”</b> (Leviticus 1:5), indicating <b>that the slaughter must be for the sake of a young bull,</b> i.e., knowing that he is performing an act of slaughter. Shmuel <b>said to</b> him: <b>we</b> received <b>this</b> as an established <i>halakha</i> already <b>that</b> one must have intent to slaughter the animal <i>ab initio</i>. But <b>from where</b> is it derived that intent to slaughter is <b>indispensable</b> even after the fact? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “You shall slaughter it to your will”</b> (Leviticus 19:5), indicating: <b>Slaughter</b> the animal <b>with your intent,</b> i.e., in the form of a purposeful action.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Slaughter</b> performed by <b>a gentile</b> renders the animal <b>an unslaughtered carcass, and</b> the carcass <b>imparts ritual impurity through carrying.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The slaughter renders the animal <b>an unslaughtered carcass, yes; an item from which</b> deriving <b>benefit is prohibited, no. Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the mishna? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya, son of Rabbi Abba, said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as, if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, doesn’t he say: The unspecified thought of a gentile is for idol worship.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching: Slaughter</b> performed by <b>a gentile</b> renders the animal <b>an unslaughtered carcass, but</b> slaughter performed <b>by a heretic</b> is <b>for</b> the sake of <b>idol worship.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>We learn</b> from an inference in the mishna <b>that which the Sages taught</b> explictly in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Slaughter</b> performed by <b>a heretic</b> is <b>for</b> the sake of <b>idol worship</b> and deriving benefit from it is prohibited, the halakhic status of <b>his bread</b> is that of <b>the bread of a Samaritan,</b> the status of <b>his wine</b> is that of <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation</b> in idol worship, <b>his</b> sacred <b>scrolls</b> that he writes <b>are the scrolls of sorcerers</b> and it is a mitzva to burn them, <b>his produce is untithed produce</b> even if he separated <i>teruma</i> and tithes, <b>and some say: Even</b>
