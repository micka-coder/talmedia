### Part 1
It is <b>in</b> a case <b>where</b> the <i>temed</i> <b>fermented</b> that there is <b>a dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis. It is only then that Rabbi Yehuda deems him obligated to tithe the <i>temed</i> if it tastes like wine, <b>and the mishna</b> that treats fermented <i>temed</i> like wine is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. And likewise, Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> It is <b>in</b> a case <b>where</b> the <i>temed</i> <b>fermented</b> that there is <b>a dispute.</b>

### Part 2
§ <b>And Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> In a case of unfermented <b><i>temed</i> that one purchased with</b> second-<b>tithe money and</b> that <b>ultimately fermented,</b> the <i>temed</i> <b>he purchased</b> assumes the sanctity of second-<b>tithe</b> produce, and the money is desacralized. <b>What is the reason</b> that the <i>temed</i> assumes the sanctity of second-tithe produce? The reason is that <b>the matter was revealed retroactively,</b> such <b>that</b> when the <i>temed</i> was purchased it <b>was produce</b> fit to be purchased with second-tithe money and was not merely water.

### Part 3
<b>But</b> in that case, <b>the mishna that teaches</b> that if the <i>temed</i> <b>fermented, yes,</b> one may purchase it with second-tithe money, but if it <b>did not ferment,</b> it may <b>not,</b> and the money remains sacred, why does the mishna state it unequivocally? <b>Perhaps, if he</b> would have <b>left</b> the <i>temed</i> long enough, it would <b>have fermented. Rabba said</b> in explanation: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where one left</b> some <b>of</b> the <i>temed</i> <b>in a cup</b> to monitor its status <b>and it did not ferment.</b> Therefore, one may be certain that it was not produce when he purchased it with second-tithe money, and the money remains sacred.

### Part 4
<b>Rava said:</b> It is not necessary to understand the mishna specifically in that manner; rather, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 7:5): In a case where there are <b>three <i>log</i></b> of drawn <b>water less one sixty-fourth of a <i>log</i> [<i>kortov</i>],</b> or any small measure of water, <b>into which a <i>kortov</i> of wine fell,</b> increasing the measure of liquid to a total of three <i>log</i>, <b>and the appearance of</b> those three <i>log</i> is <b>like the appearance of wine, and</b> then those three <i>log</i> <b>fell into a ritual bath,</b> completing its requisite forty <i>se’a</i>, <b>it has not invalidated</b> the ritual bath. The reason is that three <i>log</i> of drawn water invalidate the ritual bath, and less than that measure of water fell into the ritual bath.

### Part 5
Furthermore, in a case where there are <b>three <i>log</i></b> of drawn <b>water less one <i>kortov</i>, into which a <i>kortov</i> of milk fell, and the appearance of</b> those three <i>log</i> is <b>like the appearance of water, and</b> those three <i>log</i> <b>fell into a ritual bath, it has not invalidated</b> the ritual bath, because in this case too, less than three <i>log</i> of drawn water fell into the ritual bath.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: Everything follows the appearance</b> of those three <i>log</i>. Therefore, in the case of a <i>kortov</i> of milk completing the three <i>log</i>, the ritual bath is invalidated because the mixture still has the appearance of water.

### Part 7
Rava reasoned: <b>Doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> ben Nuri <b>say</b> that <b>we follow the appearance</b> in determining the halakhic status of the liquid? <b>Here too,</b> in the mishna, <b>follow the appearance</b> in determining the halakhic status of the liquid, <b>and</b> in the case of the <i>temed</i>, as long as it has not yet fermented, <b>the taste and the appearance of that</b> liquid <b>is</b> that of <b>water.</b> By contrast, Rav Naḥman holds in accordance with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> in the mishna in tractate <i>Mikvaot</i> that the status of the liquid is not determined by its appearance. Rather, since it ultimately fermented, it became clear retroactively that when the <i>temed</i> was purchased it was produce fit to be purchased with second-tithe money, and was not merely water.

### Part 8
The Gemara resumes its discussion of the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis with regard to which Rav Naḥman said: It is in a case where the <i>temed</i> fermented that there is a dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, and it is only then that Rabbi Yehuda deems one obligated to tithe the <i>temed</i> if it tastes like wine. If it did not yet ferment, even Rabbi Yehuda concedes that one is not obligated to tithe it. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> Rav Naḥman <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar says: Everyone,</b> even Rabbi Yehuda, <b>agrees that one may not separate</b> tithes <b>for</b> this <i>temed</i> <b>from</b> <i>temed</i> in <b>another place, unless it fermented.</b>

### Part 9
Apparently, Rabbi Elazar <b>holds</b> that it is <b>in</b> a case where the <i>temed</i> <b>did not ferment</b> that there is <b>a dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, <b>and Rabbi Yehuda obligates</b> one to tithe the <i>temed</i> that did not ferment <b>only from</b> that <i>temed</i> <b>itself,</b> because if it ferments it is tithe and if not, he has done nothing. <b>But</b> concerning <i>temed</i> that comes <b>from elsewhere,</b> one may <b>not</b> separate it for this <i>temed</i>, as <b>perhaps</b> he will <b>come to separate</b> tithe <b>from the</b> produce of <b>obligation,</b> i.e., fermented <i>temed</i>, <b>for the</b> produce of <b>exemption,</b> i.e., <i>temed</i> that will not ferment, <b>and from the</b> produce of <b>exemption for the</b> produce of <b>obligation.</b>

### Part 10
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b><i>temed</i></b> that became ritually impure, <b>until it ferments,</b>
