### Part 1
<b>exclusions are written</b> in these two cases, which indicate that this <i>halakha</i> applies to them alone. <b>Here,</b> with regard to the removal of ashes, <b>it is written: “And he shall put it”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies to “it,” and nothing else. <b>There,</b> with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken, <b>it is written: “Whose neck was broken”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6). This superfluous description teaches that the <i>halakha</i> that the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property is in effect even after the performance of a mitzva applies solely to this case and should not be extended to others.

### Part 2
The Gemara returns to the three phrases from Leviticus 17:11 cited above as teaching that the blood of offerings is not subject to the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property: <b>And why do I</b> need all <b>three verses</b> stated <b>with regard to blood?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> term serves <b>to exclude</b> blood <b>from</b> the prohibition of <b><i>notar</i>.</b> If one consumed the blood of such an offering, he is not liable for consuming <i>notar</i> as one who consumed the flesh would be. Rather, he is liable for violating only the prohibition against consuming blood. <b>And one</b> term serves <b>to exclude</b> blood <b>from</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>and one</b> other term serves <b>to exclude</b> it <b>from</b> the prohibition of consumption of offerings in a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b> If one consumed this blood in a state of ritual impurity, he is liable only for consuming blood, but not for consuming consecrated food while ritually impure.

### Part 4
<b>But no verse is required</b> to exclude this blood <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> an offering sacrificed with intention to consume it beyond its designated time, consumption of which is punishable by <i>karet</i>, as this exception is already derived from another source. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 43a): Concerning <b>any</b> item <b>that has permitting factors, either with regard to</b> consumption by <b>a person or with regard to</b> burning on <b>the altar, one is liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>. But</b> the permitting factor itself is not subject to <i>piggul</i>, and the <b>blood</b> of an offering <b>is itself a permitting factor,</b> as consumption of the offering by a person or by the altar is only permitted after the blood has been sprinkled on the altar. Therefore, the blood is not subject to the prohibition of <i>piggul</i>.
