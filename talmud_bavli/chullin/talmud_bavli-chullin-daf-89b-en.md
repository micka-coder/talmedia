### Part 1
<b>we require</b> a minimum <b>measure</b> in order to fulfill these mitzvot. A shofar must be large enough that, when grasped, part of it protrudes from both sides of one’s hand, and a <i>lulav</i> must be at least four handbreadths long. <b>And</b> since an object of <b>idol worship</b> and its effects must be burned, <b>its size</b> as required for the mitzva <b>is seen</b> by <i>halakha</i> <b>as crushed</b> into powder. Since a <i>shofar</i> or <i>lulav</i> of idol worship is destined for burning, it is considered as if it is already burned, and it therefore lacks the requisite measurement for fulfilling the mitzva. By contrast, <b>here,</b> with regard to the ashes used to perform the mitzva of covering the blood, no minimum measure is required to fulfill the mitzva; in fact, <b>the more</b> the ash <b>is crushed, the better it is for</b> the mitzva of <b>covering</b> the blood.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The prohibition of eating <b>the sciatic nerve applies</b> both <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>in the presence of,</b> i.e., the time of, <b>the Temple and not in the presence of the Temple,</b> and <b>with regard to non-sacred</b> animals <b>and with regard to sacrificial</b> animals. <b>And it applies to domesticated animals and to undomesticated animals, to</b> the <b>thigh of the right</b> leg <b>and to</b> the <b>thigh of the left</b> leg. <b>But it does not apply to a bird, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the verse makes reference to the sciatic nerve as being “upon the spoon of the thigh” (Genesis 32:33), and a bird <b>has no spoon</b> of the thigh.

### Part 4
And the prohibition <b>applies to</b> a late-term animal <b>fetus [<i>shalil</i>]</b> in the womb. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: It does not apply to a fetus; and</b> similarly, <b>its fat is permitted.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And butchers are not deemed credible</b> to say that <b>the sciatic nerve</b> was removed; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: They are deemed credible about</b> the sciatic nerve <b>and about the</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve applies to both non-sacred animals and sacrificial animals. The Gemara asks: Is it not <b>obvious</b> that the prohibition applies to <b>sacrificial</b> animals? Would it be reasonable to suggest that <b>because one consecrated it, he has abrogated the prohibition of</b> eating the sciatic <b>nerve from it?</b>

### Part 7
<b>And if you would say</b> that sciatic <b>nerves have</b> the ability to <b>impart flavor,</b> i.e., they possess flavor, <b>and</b> the mishna is teaching that <b>the prohibition of</b> eating meat of <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>comes and takes effect upon</b> the sciatic nerve despite the fact that it is already subject to the <b>prohibition of</b> eating the sciatic <b>nerve,</b> the mishna <b>should have</b> stated: The prohibition of eating meat of <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>applies to the</b> sciatic <b>nerve.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>holds</b> that the sciatic <b>nerve does not have</b> the ability to <b>impart flavor, and</b> the mishna is teaching that <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> animals <b>there is a prohibition</b> of eating the sciatic <b>nerve</b> but <b>there is no</b> additional <b>prohibition</b> of eating the meat of <b>a sacrificial</b> animal.

### Part 8
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>And</b> does <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>hold</b> that the sciatic <b>nerve does not have</b> the ability to <b>impart flavor? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (96b): In the case of <b>a thigh that was cooked</b> with <b>the sciatic nerve in it, if there is</b> enough of the sciatic nerve <b>in</b> the thigh to <b>impart</b> its <b>flavor</b> to the meat, the entire thigh <b>is forbidden?</b> Consequently, it is clear that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna holds that the sciatic nerve does possess flavor.

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> in the mishna <b>here we are dealing with offspring of sacrificial</b> animals. <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve <b>applies with regard to a fetus, and</b> he also <b>holds</b> that the <b>offspring of sacrificial</b> animals <b>are consecrated</b> even while they are <b>in the womb of their mother.</b> Consequently, the <b>prohibition of</b> eating the sciatic <b>nerve and the prohibition of</b> eating <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>come</b> into effect <b>at the same time,</b> and therefore both prohibitions apply and one does not say that a prohibition does not take effect where another prohibition already exists.

### Part 10
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>Can you interpret</b> this clause of the mishna as referring <b>to a fetus? From</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches: It applies to</b> a late-term <b>fetus,</b> and Rabbi Yehuda holds that it does not apply to a late-term fetus, <b>it may be inferred that</b> in <b>the first</b> clause <b>we are not dealing with a fetus.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>is saying: This matter</b> that was taught in the first clause <b>is</b> a matter of <b>dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara again challenges the explanation that the first clause of the mishna is referring to a fetus: <b>And how can you say that both</b> prohibitions <b>come</b> into effect <b>at the same time? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 49b): <b>A nazirite shaves for</b> having become impure from <b>these</b> sources of <b>ritual impurity: For</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse and for</b> impurity imparted by <b>an olive-bulk of a corpse.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And</b> the clause: For impurity imparted by a corpse, is <b>difficult for us,</b> as it seems unnecessary; if a nazirite <b>must shave for</b> impurity imparted by <b>an olive-bulk of a corpse,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> true that he must shave <b>for</b> impurity imparted by <b>an entire</b> corpse? <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>necessary only for a miscarried</b> human <b>fetus whose limbs had not</b> yet <b>become joined to</b> its <b>sinews.</b> Since the spine is complete the fetus is considered a full corpse, but as the limbs have not yet joined to the sinews it does not contain an olive-bulk of flesh.
