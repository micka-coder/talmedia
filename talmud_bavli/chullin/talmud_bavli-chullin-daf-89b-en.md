### Part 1
<b>we require</b> a minimum <b>measure</b> in order to fulfill these mitzvot. A shofar must be large enough that, when grasped, part of it protrudes from both sides of oneâ€™s hand, and a <i>lulav</i> must be at least four handbreadths long. <b>And</b> since an object of <b>idol worship</b> and its effects must be burned, <b>its size</b> as required for the mitzva <b>is seen</b> by <i>halakha</i> <b>as crushed</b> into powder. Since a <i>shofar</i> or <i>lulav</i> of idol worship is destined for burning, it is considered as if it is already burned, and it therefore lacks the requisite measurement for fulfilling the mitzva. By contrast, <b>here,</b> with regard to the ashes used to perform the mitzva of covering the blood, no minimum measure is required to fulfill the mitzva; in fact, <b>the more</b> the ash <b>is crushed, the better it is for</b> the mitzva of <b>covering</b> the blood.
