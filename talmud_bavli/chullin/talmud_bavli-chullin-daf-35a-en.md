### Part 1
<b>as there is not an olive-bulk</b> of <i>teruma</i> in the amount of stew that he eats <b>in</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread. Therefore, one need not treat the mixture with the level of purity required of <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yonatan says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> For <b>one who partakes of actual <i>teruma</i> that</b> is impure with <b>third-degree</b> impurity, it is <b>prohibited to partake</b> of other <i>teruma</i>, <b>but</b> it is <b>permitted to come into contact</b> with <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 3
The Gemara notes that the statement <b>of Ulla was necessary and</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yonatan was necessary. As, if</b> the <i>halakha</i> were learned exclusively <b>from</b> the statement <b>of Ulla, I would say: This statement</b> applies <b>with regard to non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of <i>teruma</i>, but</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i></b> itself perhaps <b>contact is also prohibited.</b> Therefore, the statement <b>of Rabbi Yonatan was necessary. And if</b> the <i>halakha</i> were learned exclusively <b>from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yonatan, I would say: This statement</b> applies with regard to <b><i>teruma</i>, but</b> with regard to <b>non-sacred</b> food that was prepared with purity of <i>teruma</i>, perhaps <b>eating</b> it is <b>also permitted.</b> Therefore, both statements <b>are necessary.</b>

### Part 4
§ <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta was sitting before Rav Naḥman, and he was sitting and saying:</b> With regard to <b>one who eats non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food, and these items had become impure with <b>third-degree</b> impurity, he <b>is ritually pure</b> in terms of the right <b>to partake of sacrificial</b> food, <b>as you have nothing that confers fourth-degree</b> impurity <b>in sacrificial</b> food <b>other than consecrated sacrificial</b> food <b>alone,</b> but non-sacred food prepared with the purity of sacrificial food does not.

### Part 5
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raises an objection</b> from the mishna cited earlier (33b): One who eats food with <b>third-degree</b> impurity assumes <b>second</b>-<b>degree</b> impurity <b>vis-à-vis sacrificial</b> food, <b>and</b> he does <b>not</b> assume <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>vis-à-vis <i>teruma</i>.</b> Eating an item with third-degree impurity is feasible only in the case of non-sacred items, as partaking of impure <i>teruma</i> is prohibited. It is only possible <b>in</b> the case of <b>non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared</b> as if their level of purity were <b>on the</b> level of the <b>purity of <i>teruma</i>.</b> According to the statement of Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta, <b>why</b> does this food assume second-degree impurity? <b>It is not sacrificial</b> food, which is <b>sanctified.</b>

### Part 6
Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta <b>said to him: Leave <i>teruma</i></b> alone; <b>its</b> state of <b>purity is impurity vis-à-vis sacrificial</b> food. Therefore, non-sacred food that was prepared with the purity of <i>teruma</i> renders sacrificial food impure.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do you say</b> that the purity of <i>teruma</i> is impurity vis-à-vis sacrificial food? It is from a mishna (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 18b), <b>as we learned:</b> The halakhic status of <b>the garments of an <i>am ha’aretz</i>,</b> who does not scrupulously observe the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity, is like that of items rendered impure by <b>treading,</b> e.g., items designated for sitting or lying upon which a <i>zav</i> or a menstruating woman sits or lies, which are rendered a primary source of ritual impurity <b>for individuals who scrupulously observe</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>ritual purity [<i>perushin</i>]</b> and eat their non-sacred food in a state of purity. In other words, it is considered a primary level of impurity for them. The halakhic status of <b>the garments of <i>perushin</i></b> is like that of items rendered impure by <b>treading for</b> priests <b>who partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b> In addition, the halakhic status of <b>the garments of</b> priests <b>who partake of <i>teruma</i></b> is like that of items rendered impure by <b>treading for</b> those who eat <b>sacrificial</b> food.

### Part 8
<b>Rava said: Are you saying</b> that one can cite proof from the <i>halakha</i> of items rendered impure by <b>treading</b> that the state of purity of <i>teruma</i> is impurity vis-à-vis sacrificial food? No proof may be cited from there, as the decree that the halakhic status of the garments of priests who partake of <i>teruma</i> is like that of items rendered impure by <b>treading</b> for those who eat sacrificial food <b>is different,</b>
