### Part 1
<b>and</b> the <i>tanna</i> then <b>saw</b> that the case <b>of Rav Mattana,</b> where the end of the thigh is dislocated, ostensibly <b>comes</b> under the heading of: <b>This is the principle,</b> and one might assume that it renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> as well. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>because</b> a dislocated thigh is <b>similar to</b> the cases of <b>removed</b> organs that render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. Therefore, <b>he taught</b> the phrase: <b>These are <i>tereifot</i>,</b> at the beginning of the mishna, to emphasize that <b>it is</b> only <b>these that</b> render an animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, but</b> in the case <b>of Rav Mattana,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> who <b>says</b> that the phrase: <b>These are kosher,</b> is meant <b>specifically,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> the list of <b><i>tereifot</i>, and taught</b> afterward that <b>this is the principle. And</b> the <i>tanna</i> then <b>saw</b> that the case <b>of Rav Mattana</b> ostensibly <b>does not come</b> under the heading of: <b>This is the principle,</b> and one might assume that it does not render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is because a dislocated thigh <b>is not similar to</b> cases of <b>perforated</b> organs, <b>and it is not similar to</b> cases of <b>cut</b> organs, such as the windpipe, <b>and</b> it <b>is not similar to</b> cases of <b>removed</b> organs. Therefore, <b>he taught</b> the phrase: <b>These are kosher,</b> to emphasize that <b>it is</b> only <b>these that are kosher, but</b> in the case <b>of Rav Mattana,</b> the animal <b>is a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara addresses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Mattana says: This head of the femur that was</b> completely <b>dislocated</b> renders the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And Rava said:</b> The animal is <b>kosher, but if its sinew</b> holding the bone in place <b>is cut,</b> it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: Even if the sinew is <b>cut,</b> the animal is <b>still kosher, unless</b> the sinew <b>decomposed,</b> in which case the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 4
§ The mishna states: <b>How much can</b> the windpipe <b>be missing</b> and still be kosher? Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Until the perforation is the same size as an Italian <i>issar</i>. <b>Ze’eiri,</b> who came from Eretz Yisrael, <b>said</b> with regard to this: <b>You, who are not familiar with the measure</b> of an Italian <i>issar</i>, because it is not used in Babylonia, should estimate <b>its measure as a Kurdish dinar. And it is like a small <i>peruta</i></b> coin <b>and can be found among the <i>perutot</i> of Pumbedita.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Ḥana the money changer said: Bar Nappaḥa,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>was standing over me, and he requested of me a Kurdish dinar with</b> which <b>to measure <i>tereifot</i>,</b> in accordance with the statement of Ze’eiri. <b>And I wanted to rise before him</b> out of respect, <b>but he did not let me.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to me: Sit, my son, sit. Tradesmen are not permitted to stand before Torah scholars when they are engaged in their work.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> are tradesmen <b>not</b> permitted to stand before Torah scholars? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:3): When the pilgrims bring their first fruits to Jerusalem, <b>all the tradesmen stand before them, and greet them, and say to them: Our brothers from such and such place, welcome?</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Yes, <b>they stand before</b> those bringing first fruits, but <b>they do not stand before Torah scholars. Rabbi Yosei bar Avin says: Come and see how beloved is a mitzva</b> performed <b>in its</b> proper <b>time, as</b> the tradesmen <b>stand before those</b> who brought first fruits, while <b>they do not stand before Torah scholars.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects the statement of Rabbi Yosei bar Avin: <b>From where</b> does one know that they rise out of respect? <b>Perhaps</b> the tradesmen stand only <b>in order not to cause</b> those bringing first fruits to <b>fail</b> and sin <b>in the future.</b> That is, if the tradesmen do not treat those bringing the first fruits with great respect, they may not make the effort to travel to Jerusalem in a subsequent year.

### Part 9
§ The mishna states: How much can the windpipe be missing and still be kosher? Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Until the perforation is the same size as an Italian <i>issar</i>. With regard to this, <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> Whenever the Sages specify the measure <b>as</b> that of <b>a <i>sela</i>,</b> e.g., with regard to a damaged skull for purposes of <i>tereifot</i>, they mean that even an area exactly the size of a <i>sela</i> is treated <b>as more than a <i>sela</i>.</b> Likewise, when they specify the measure <b>as</b> that of <b>an <i>issar</i>,</b> they mean that an area exactly the size of an <i>issar</i> is treated <b>as</b> though it were <b>more than an <i>issar</i>.</b>

### Part 10
Since Rav Naḥman holds that a perforation exactly the size of an <i>issar</i> is treated as though it were larger than an <i>issar</i>, he must hold that such a perforation in the windpipe renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara therefore infers: <b>Apparently, Rav Naḥman holds</b> that whenever the Sages use the word: Until, it means <b>until and not including the measure,</b> as the mishna states that an animal with a perforated windpipe is kosher until the perforation reaches the size of an <i>issar</i>.

### Part 11
<b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> from a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 19:2): The end of <b>a rope that extends from</b> a rope <b>bed is not susceptible to ritual impurity until</b> it is <b>five handbreadths</b> long. If the bed becomes impure, the rope remains pure, because it has no use and is therefore not considered part of the bed. <b>What, is it not</b> teaching that a rope exactly <b>five</b> handbreadths long is treated <b>as</b> though its length were <b>below</b> that amount? If so, the word: Until, means until and including the exact measure. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> a rope exactly <b>five</b> handbreadths long is <b>like</b> a rope whose length is <b>above</b> that amount.

### Part 12
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the continuation of the mishna: If the end of the rope was of any length <b>from five</b> handbreadths <b>until ten, it is susceptible to impurity. What, is it not</b> teaching that a rope exactly <b>ten</b> handbreadths long is treated <b>as</b> though its length were <b>below</b> that? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> a rope exactly <b>ten</b> handbreadths long is treated <b>like</b> a rope whose length is <b>above</b> that, and it is not susceptible to impurity.

### Part 13
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from another mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 2:2): With regard to <b>the smallest of earthenware vessels,</b> if <b>they, or</b> even <b>their</b> broken-off <b>bases or sides,</b> can <b>sit,</b> i.e., remain upright, <b>without being supported,</b>
