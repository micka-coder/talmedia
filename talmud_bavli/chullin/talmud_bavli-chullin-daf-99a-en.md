### Part 1
The Gemara objects: <b>Let</b> us <b>learn from</b> the case of the nazirite’s ram that the flavor of sacrificial food can be nullified. The Gemara explains: <b>The Merciful One revealed</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to the sin offering: “Whatever shall touch its flesh shall be holy”</b> (Leviticus 6:20). This teaches that the halakhic status of any food that touches and absorbs flavor from a sin offering <b>becomes like it, so</b> that <b>if</b> the sin offering <b>is disqualified,</b> this food <b>shall</b> also <b>be disqualified, and if</b> the sin offering is <b>valid,</b> this food may be <b>eaten in accordance with the stringencies</b> that apply to a sin offering.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> to indicate <b>that we learn</b> the principle of nullification concerning sacrificial food <b>from that</b> verse of the sin offering? <b>Derive it</b> instead <b>from this</b> verse concerning the foreleg of the nazirite’s ram. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> case of the nazirite’s ram <b>is a novelty, and we do not learn</b> principles <b>from a novelty.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> if the case of the nazirite’s ram is not a viable precedent for general halakhic principles, then <b>one should also not learn</b> from that case that when forbidden food is mixed with permitted food of a different type, it is nullified in either <b>one hundred or sixty</b> times its own volume. As discussed above, the two opinions in this regard are both based on the case of the nazirite’s ram. The Gemara responds: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>we learn</b> that forbidden food is nullified in sixty or one hundred times its volume of permitted food as <b>a leniency? We learn it</b> only as <b>a stringency, as</b> if it were not for this derivation, one would say that <b>by Torah law</b> forbidden food <b>is nullified in</b> a mixture in which there is a simple <b>majority</b> of permitted food.

### Part 4
<b>Ravina said</b> an alternative explanation of the term: This is, that appears in the <i>baraita</i> with regard to the nazirite’s ram. This limitation <b>is necessary only for the place</b> where the foreleg is <b>cut</b> from the body of the ram, <b>as</b> it was <b>said</b> that in a case where permitted and forbidden foods were attached and one cut the forbidden section from the permitted section, <b>the place of the cut</b> on the permitted part <b>is generally forbidden. But here,</b> in the case of the nazirite’s ram, <b>it is permitted.</b>

### Part 5
§ The Gemara returns to discussing the statement of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak (98a) that forbidden food is nullified in a mixture only if there is one hundred times its volume of permitted food. <b>Rav Dimi sat and said this <i>halakha</i>.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Abaye said to him: And</b> is it true that <b>all the forbidden</b> foods <b>in the Torah</b> that are mixed with permitted foods are nullified only <b>in</b> a mixture containing <b>one hundred</b> times their volume of permitted food? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 2:6): <b>Why did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that with regard to <b>anyone who leavens</b> non-sacred food with a leavening agent that is <i>teruma</i> <b>or flavors</b> it with spices of <i>teruma</i> <b>or mixes</b> <i>teruma</i> into non-sacred food, thereby making the food forbidden for non-priests, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to be stringent</b> if he mixed one <b>type</b> of food that is <i>teruma</i> with non-sacred food of the same <b>type.</b> But the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to be lenient and to be stringent</b> if he mixed one <b>type</b> of <i>teruma</i> with non-sacred food of <b>a different type.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And it is taught in the latter clause,</b> i.e., in the following mishna (<i>Orla</i> 2:7): When it is stated that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to be lenient and to be stringent</b> if he mixed one <b>type</b> of <i>teruma</i> with non-sacred food <b>not</b> of <b>its type, how</b> is this accomplished? For example, in a case of <b>split beans</b> of <i>teruma</i> that were cooked <b>with</b> non-sacred <b>lentils, if there are</b> enough split beans relative to the lentils to <b>impart flavor</b> to the lentils, then regardless of <b>whether there are</b> enough lentils <b>to neutralize</b> the split beans <b>in one hundred and one</b> times their volume, i.e., the volume of the lentils is one hundred and one times the volume of the split beans, or <b>whether there are not</b> enough lentils <b>to neutralize</b> the split beans <b>in one hundred and one</b> times their volume, the entire mixture is <b>forbidden</b> to a non-priest.

### Part 8
Conversely, if <b>there are not</b> enough split beans of <i>teruma</i> to <b>impart flavor</b> to the lentils, then regardless of <b>whether there are</b> enough lentils <b>to neutralize</b> the split beans <b>in one hundred and one</b> times their volume, or <b>whether there are not</b> enough lentils <b>to neutralize</b> the split beans <b>in one hundred and one</b> times their volume, the mixture is <b>permitted</b> even to a non-priest.

### Part 9
Abaye commented: When the mishna says that <b>there are not</b> enough lentils <b>to neutralize</b> the split beans <b>in one hundred and one</b> times their volume, and nevertheless if the split beans did not impart flavor to the lentils, the mixture is permitted, <b>in what</b> amount of lentils are the split beans nullified? Is it <b>not</b> that the split beans are permitted because they are mixed <b>with sixty</b> times their volume of non-sacred lentils? This contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak.
