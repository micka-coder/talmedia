### Part 1
The Gemara answers that it is the <b><i>ofanim</i> who say</b> the verse: <b>“Blessed be</b> the glory of the Lord from His place,” as the next verse mentions “the noise of the <i>ofanim</i>” (Ezekiel 3:13), and Rav Ḥanina’s statement citing Rav was referring not to <i>ofanim</i> but to ministering angels. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>once permission has been given</b> to them to mention the name of God after three words when they say: “Holy, holy, holy,” permission is also <b>given</b> to them to mention the name of God again while praising Him even after fewer than three words.

### Part 2
The Gemara continues to discuss Jacob wrestling with the angel. The prophet states: <b>“So he strove [<i>vayyasar</i>] with an angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication to him;</b> at Beth El he would find him, and there he would speak with us” (Hosea 12:5). From this verse <b>I do not know who became master [<i>sar</i>],</b> i.e., was victorious, <b>over whom. When</b> another verse <b>states:</b> “And he said: Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; <b>for you have striven with angels</b> and with men, and have prevailed” (Genesis 32:29), <b>you must say</b> that <b>Jacob became master over the angel.</b>

### Part 3
The verse in Hosea states: <b>“He wept, and made supplication to him.”</b> From this verse <b>I do not know who cried to whom. When</b> another verse <b>states: “And he said: Let me go,</b> for the dawn has risen” (Genesis 32:27), <b>you must say</b> that <b>the angel cried to Jacob.</b>

### Part 4
The verse states: “And he said: Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; <b>for you have striven with angels [<i>elohim</i>] and with men,</b> and have prevailed” (Genesis 32:29). <b>Rabba says:</b> The angel <b>intimated to</b> Jacob <b>that in the future two princes would emerge from him:</b> They are the <b>Exilarch who is in Babylonia and the <i>Nasi</i> who is in Eretz Yisrael.</b> And <b>from here he</b> also <b>intimated to</b> Jacob that there would be <b>an exile.</b>

### Part 5
Similarly, with regard to the dream of Pharaoh’s butler, the verse states: <b>“And in the vine were three branches [<i>sarigim</i>];</b> and as it was budding, its blossoms shot forth, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes” (Genesis 40:10). <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav says: These</b> three branches refer to the <b>three proud princes [<i>sarei ge’im</i>] who emerge from the Jewish people in each and every generation.</b> There are <b>times</b> when <b>two are here</b> in Babylonia <b>and one is in Eretz Yisrael,</b> and there are <b>times</b> when <b>two are in Eretz Yisrael and one is here</b> in Babylonia. When this was stated in the study hall, <b>the Sages</b> present <b>turned their eyes toward Rabbana Ukva and Rabbana Neḥemya, the sons of the daughter of Rav,</b> who were from the family of the Exilarch and were two leaders of the generation who resided in Babylonia.

### Part 6
<b>Rava says</b> a different explanation of the verse: <b>These</b> three branches [<i>sarigim</i>] <b>are the three ministering</b> angels appointed to oversee <b>the gentiles [<i>sarei goyim</i>], who plead in favor of the Jewish people in each and every generation.</b>

### Part 7
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> an alternate interpretation of the verse. <b>“Vine”; this</b> is a reference to <b>the world. “Three branches”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. “And as it was budding, its blossoms shot forth”; these are the matriarchs. “And its clusters brought forth ripe grapes”; these are the</b> twelve <b>tribes,</b> i.e., the twelve sons of Jacob.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: But is a person shown</b> in a dream <b>what was</b> in the past? <b>Isn’t</b> it true that <b>one is shown only what will be in the future?</b> Since the patriarchs, matriarchs, and sons of Jacob were all born prior to this dream, the dream was not alluding to them. <b>Rather,</b> the verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>“Vine”; this</b> is a reference to <b>the Torah. “Three branches”; these are Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. “And as it was budding, its blossoms shot forth”; these are the</b> members of the <b>Sanhedrin. “And its clusters brought forth ripe grapes”; these are the righteous</b> people <b>who</b> live <b>in each and every generation.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabban Gamliel said:</b> In order to understand this verse (Genesis 40:10) <b>we still need</b> the explanation <b>of</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>HaModa’i, who</b> is an expert in matters of <i>aggada</i>, as he <b>interprets all of</b> the phrases in the verse as referring to <b>one location. Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i says: “Vine”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Jerusalem. “Three branches”; this</b> is a reference to the <b>Temple,</b> the <b>king and</b> the <b>High Priest. “And as it was budding [<i>poraḥat</i>], its blossoms shot forth”; these are the young priests [<i>pirḥei khehunna</i>]. “And its clusters brought forth ripe grapes”; these are the</b> wine <b>libations.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi interprets it with</b> reference to the <b>gifts</b> that God gave the Jewish people, <b>as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: “Vine”; this</b> is a reference to the <b>Torah. “Three branches”; this</b> is a reference to the miraculous items that accompanied the Jewish people in the wilderness and sustained and protected them: The <b>well, the pillar of cloud, and the manna. “And as it was budding, its blossoms shot forth”; these are the first fruits</b> that are brought to the Temple. <b>“And its clusters brought forth ripe grapes”; these are</b> the wine <b>libations.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says: “Vine”; this</b> is a reference to <b>the Jewish people, and similarly</b> another verse <b>states: “You plucked up a vine out of Egypt;</b> You drove out the nations and planted it” (Psalms 80:9). <b>“Three branches”; these are the three</b> pilgrimage <b>Festivals, on which the Jewish people ascend</b> to Jerusalem <b>every year. “And as it was budding, its blossoms shot forth,”</b> means that <b>the time has arrived for the Jewish people to be fruitful and multiply, and similarly</b> another verse <b>states: “And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly,</b> and multiplied, and became exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them” (Exodus 1:7).

### Part 12
<b>“Its blossoms [<i>nitzah</i>] shot forth”</b> means that <b>the time has arrived for the Jewish people to be redeemed. And similarly</b> another verse <b>states: “And their eternity [<i>nitzḥam</i>] is dashed against My garments, and I have redeemed all My raiment”</b> (Isaiah 63:3). <b>“And its clusters brought forth ripe grapes”</b> means that <b>the time has arrived for Egypt to drink the cup of fury,</b> i.e., to receive its punishment.

### Part 13
<b>And this is as Rava said: Why</b> are there <b>three cups stated with regard to Egypt</b> in the dream of Pharaoh’s butler (see Genesis 40:11)? They are an allusion to three cups of misfortune that would later befall Egypt: <b>One that</b> Egypt <b>drank in the days of Moses</b> during the ten plagues and the Exodus; <b>one that</b> Egypt <b>drank in the days of Pharaoh Nekho,</b> the king of Egypt defeated by Nebuchadnezzar; <b>and one that</b> Egypt <b>will drink in the future with all the</b> other <b>nations,</b> when they are punished in the time of the Messiah.

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Abba said to Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba: When Rav interpreted these verses homiletically he interpreted them according to</b> the way in which <b>you</b> have interpreted them, and not according to any of the other opinions cited above.

### Part 15
Similar to Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba’s interpretation of the word vine as an allusion to the Jewish people, <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: This nation is likened to a vine. The branches of</b> the vine support the clusters of grapes, the leaves, and the tendrils; <b>these are</b> represented among the Jewish people by <b>the homeowners,</b> who provide financial support for the entire nation. <b>The clusters</b> of grapes <b>on</b> the vine, <b>these are the Torah scholars. The leaves on</b> the vine, which protect the grapes, <b>these are the ignoramuses,</b> who protect the Torah scholars. <b>The tendrils of</b> the vine, which do not directly serve the grapes themselves, <b>these are the empty</b> ones <b>of the Jewish people.</b>

### Part 16
<b>And this is</b> the meaning of the instruction <b>that they sent from there,</b> i.e., from Eretz Yisrael: <b>Let the clusters</b> of grapes <b>pray for the leaves, as were it not for the leaves, the clusters</b> of grapes <b>would not survive.</b>

### Part 17
§ The Gemara cites homiletical interpretations of other verses that pertain to the leaders of the Jewish people in Eretz Yisrael and Babylonia. The verse states: <b>“So I bought her [<i>va’ekkereha</i>] to me for fifteen pieces of silver,</b> and a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley, and a half-<i>ḥomer</i> of barley” (Hosea 3:2). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak:</b> The term <b><i>kira</i>,</b> which forms the basis of the verb <i>va’ekkereha</i>, <b>is nothing other than language</b> referring to <b>a sale [<i>mekhira</i>], as it is stated</b> that Joseph said: “My father made me swear, saying: Lo, I die; <b>in my grave that I have acquired [<i>kariti</i>] for me</b> in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me” (Genesis 50:5).

### Part 18
Rabbi Yoḥanan continues: <b>“For fifteen</b> pieces of silver”; <b>this</b> is a reference to <b>the fifteenth of Nisan,</b> the date <b>on which the Jewish people were redeemed from Egypt. “Silver”; these are the righteous</b> people. <b>And similarly,</b> another verse <b>states: “He has taken the bag of silver with him”</b> (Proverbs 7:20), a reference to God taking the righteous away prior to the destruction of the First Temple (see <i>Sanhedrin</i> 96b).

### Part 19
The verse states: <b>“A <i>ḥomer</i> of barley, and a half-<i>ḥomer</i> of barley.”</b> A <i>ḥomer</i> equals thirty <i>se’a</i>, and a half-<i>ḥomer</i> equals fifteen <i>se’a</i>, totaling forty-five <i>se’a</i>; <b>these are the forty-five righteous</b> individuals <b>in whose</b> merit <b>the world</b> continues to <b>exist. And</b> although the verse alludes to the fact that thirty of these righteous individuals are in one place and fifteen are elsewhere, <b>I do not know if thirty are here</b> in Babylonia <b>and fifteen are in Eretz Yisrael, or if thirty are in Eretz Yisrael and fifteen are here</b> in Babylonia. <b>When it says</b> in a different verse: <b>“And I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them into the treasury, in the house of the Lord”</b> (Zechariah 11:13), <b>you must say</b> that <b>thirty</b> of the righteous individuals are <b>in Eretz Yisrael and fifteen are here</b> in Babylonia.

### Part 20
<b>Abaye said: And most of the</b> fifteen righteous individuals in Babylonia <b>are found in the synagogue under the upper room. And this is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And I said to them: If it is good in your eyes, give me my hire; and if not, refrain. And they weighed for my hire thirty pieces of silver”</b> (Zechariah 11:12).

### Part 21
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: These are the thirty righteous</b> individuals among the <b>nations of the world, in whose</b> merit <b>the nations of the world</b> continue to <b>exist. Ulla says: These are the thirty mitzvot that the descendants of Noah</b> initially <b>accepted upon themselves; but they fulfill only three</b> of them. <b>One</b> of these three mitzvot is
