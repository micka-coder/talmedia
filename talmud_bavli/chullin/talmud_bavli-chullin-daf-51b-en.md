### Part 1
<b>becomes</b> ritually <b>impure</b> if he experiences a gonorrhea-like <b>discharge [<i>ziva</i>]. And if it should enter your mind</b> that a newborn <b>is subject to</b> concern about possible <b>shattered limbs, read here</b> the ruling stated with regard to <i>ziva</i>, that one’s discharge renders one impure only when it issues <b>“out of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 15:2), <b>but not</b> when it issues <b>due to circumstances beyond his control,</b> e.g., due to illness. Therefore, if one must be concerned that a newborn’s limbs may have shattered during birth, his discharge would not render him impure.

### Part 2
The Gemara responds: One cannot bring a proof from this <i>baraita</i>, since <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the infant <b>left</b> the womb <b>by caesarean section</b> and did not exit through the narrow birth canal. By contrast, after normal births, a newborn’s discharge does not render it impure, since one is concerned about the possibility of shattered limbs.

### Part 3
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a calf was born on a Festival, one may slaughter it</b> and eat it <b>on</b> the <b>Festival.</b> One need not wait twenty-four hours before deeming the animal kosher, as one does for an animal that fell from a roof. Apparently, one need not be concerned that its limbs were shattered during the birth. The Gemara responds: <b>Here, too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the calf <b>left</b> the womb <b>by caesarean section.</b> But after normal births, one must wait twenty-four hours before slaughtering the calf.

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from another <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> all <b>agree that if</b> a firstborn animal <b>was born</b> on a Festival <b>and its blemish</b> was born <b>with it,</b> i.e., if it was born with a blemish that removes its sanctity and renders it permitted for consumption, <b>it is</b> considered to be <b>prepared</b> for the Festival and may be eaten. Evidently, one need not wait twenty-four hours before deeming it kosher. <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>here too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> deals with a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>left</b> the womb <b>by caesarean section,</b> one might respond: <b>Is</b> a firstborn animal born <b>by caesarean section sanctified? But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Rabbi Shimon would concede with regard to sacrificial</b> animals, e.g., a firstborn, <b>that</b> an animal born by caesarean section <b>is not sanctified?</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> must be referring to an animal born naturally.

### Part 5
The Gemara responds: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a firstborn <b>that spread out</b> its legs <b>on the ground</b> and stood up immediately after birth. In such a case the animal is certainly not a <i>tereifa</i> on account of shattered limbs.

### Part 6
§ <b>And Rav Naḥman says:</b> If an animal was thrown to the ground in <b>the slaughterhouse</b> in preparation for slaughter, it <b>is not subject to</b> concern for <b>shattered limbs.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara relates: <b>A certain bull fell</b> in the slaughterhouse, <b>and its bellowing was audible</b> due to the blow. Still, <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta entered</b> and <b>took from the very best</b> portions of the bull and was not concerned that it may have been a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>The Sages said to him: From where</b> did you learn <b>this?</b> Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta <b>said to them: This is what Rav said:</b> When falling, the bull <b>digs in its hooves until it reaches the earth.</b> Therefore, one need not be concerned that it fell roughly.

### Part 8
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If an animal fell and <b>stood</b> up again, <b>it does not require</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> mentioned in the mishna (56b) to determine if it may be slaughtered. Nevertheless, <b>it certainly requires inspection</b> after slaughter to determine whether it was injured by the fall and rendered a <i>tereifa</i>. But if it both stood up and <b>walked</b> after the fall, <b>it does not</b> even <b>require inspection</b> after slaughter. <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi says: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, i.e., even if it walked after the fall, <b>it requires inspection.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Yirmeya bar Aḥa says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If the animal <b>stretched out its foreleg to stand, even if it did not</b> actually <b>stand,</b> it is considered to have stood and does not require a twenty-four-hour waiting period. If <b>it raised its leg to walk, even if it did not</b> actually <b>walk,</b> it is considered to have walked and does not require inspection according to Rav. <b>And Rav Ḥisda says:</b> Even if it did not stretch out its foreleg, but simply <b>struggled to stand, even if it did not stand,</b> it is considered to have stood and may be slaughtered that day.

### Part 10
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: In any case <b>where</b> an animal <b>fell from the roof unawares,</b> i.e., unintentionally, <b>and stood but did not walk,</b> it <b>requires inspection</b> after slaughter <b>but does not require</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> before slaughter. <b>And if it walked, it does not even require an inspection.</b>

### Part 11
§ <b>Ameimar said in the name of Rav Dimi of Neharde’a: A fallen</b> animal <b>that</b> the Sages <b>said requires inspection</b> must be inspected <b>around the intestines</b> to see whether the organs there have been perforated or torn, rendering the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Mar Zutra said to him: This</b> is what <b>we say in the name of Rav Pappa:</b> Such an animal <b>requires inspection around the entire</b> space of the body <b>cavity,</b> in case the ribs or spine have been damaged.

### Part 12
<b>Huna Mar, grandson of Rav Neḥemya, said to Rav Ashi: What</b> about the <b>two organs that must be severed in ritual slaughter [<i>simanim</i>],</b> i.e., the windpipe and the gullet? Do they require inspection as well? Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> The <b><i>simanim</i> are hard</b> and resistant to damage <b>in falling.</b> Therefore, one need not inspect them.

### Part 13
§ With regard to birds that have fallen, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: If a bird</b> fell and <b>hit the surface of the water, once it swims the full length of its</b> body, this <b>is sufficient</b> to indicate that its limbs have not been shattered, similar to an animal that walks after falling. <b>And we said</b> this <b>only</b> in cases where it swam <b>from below to above,</b> i.e., upstream. <b>But</b> if it swam <b>from above to below,</b> i.e., downstream, <b>it is</b> only <b>the water that carried it down,</b> and it must be inspected. <b>And if the water is standing,</b> e.g., in a pond, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> as it is clear that the bird is swimming on its own strength, and it need not be inspected. <b>And</b> even if the bird swims downstream, <b>if straw was scattered</b> in front of it <b>and</b> the bird <b>overtook it</b> with its swimming, <b>then</b> the bird <b>overtook it</b> on its own strength and need not be inspected.

### Part 14
If the bird fell on <b>a garment</b> spread out <b>taut</b> over poles, <b>we must be concerned</b> that its limbs may have been shattered from the impact. If it fell on a garment <b>that was not taut, we</b> need <b>not be concerned.</b> In any event, if the garment was <b>folded, we</b> need <b>not be concerned,</b> since it presumably was not taut enough to injure the bird. If the bird fell on <b>a net whose knots were</b> woven <b>closely</b> together, <b>we must be concerned</b> that its limbs may have been shattered from the impact. If the <b>knots were not close</b> together, <b>we</b> need <b>not be concerned.</b>

### Part 15
If the bird fell directly on to <b>flax arranged into bundles, we must be concerned</b> that its limbs may have been shattered from the impact, because the bundles are hard. If it fell on <b>this side or that side</b> of the bundles, <b>we</b> need <b>not be concerned,</b> because it did not fall directly onto the bundles and the impact was dampened. If it fell on <b>bundles of reeds, we must be concerned.</b> If it fell on <b>beaten and combed flax,</b> with the impurities removed, <b>we</b> need <b>not be concerned,</b> since it is soft. If it fell on flax that was <b>beaten but not combed, we must be concerned</b> due to the residue of flax stalks in the bundles. If it fell on flax <b>that was bundled</b> after it was beaten and combed, <b>since it has knots</b> in it <b>we must be concerned.</b> If the bird fell on flax <b>tow,</b> a coarse bundle of unspun fiber, <b>we must be concerned.</b> If it fell on <b>fine tow, we</b> need <b>not be concerned,</b> because it is soft.

### Part 16
If the bird fell on <b><i>nevara</i>,</b> the fibers that grow around a palm tree, <b>we must be concerned</b> that its limbs may have been shattered. If it fell on <b><i>timaḥta</i>,</b> palm bark cut into strips, <b>we</b> need <b>not be concerned.</b> If it fell on <b>sifted ashes, we must be concerned,</b> because the ashes harden. If it fell on <b>unsifted</b> ashes, <b>we</b> need <b>not be concerned,</b> because they are soft and scatter on impact.
