### Part 1
<b>And</b> the other food is not forbidden due to the liver’s blood, <b>but</b> rather <b>due to the fat</b> of the liver it absorbed. But if permitted liver is cooked with another piece of meat, and the concern is only that the meat might be prohibited <b>due to</b> the meat absorbing excess <b>blood</b> from the liver, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Perhaps blood is absorbed less easily than fat.

### Part 2
<b>When</b> Rav Safra <b>again ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rabbi Zerika</b> once more and asked him about liver cooked with another piece of meat. Rabbi Zerika <b>said to him: You</b> need <b>not ask this</b> question <b>either, as I and Yannai, son of Rabbi Ami, arrived at the house of Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, and they brought before us the windpipe</b> of an animal <b>with</b> all the parts <b>attached to it,</b> i.e., the lungs, heart, and liver, all of which had been cooked together, <b>and we ate</b> it. This proves that the blood emitted from the liver does not render prohibited other pieces of meat cooked with it.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Ashi, and some say Rabbi Shmuel from Zerokinya, objects to this</b> conclusion: <b>But perhaps</b> in that incident <b>the mouth of the windpipe was</b> positioned <b>outside of the pot,</b> allowing the liver’s excess blood to run out of the pot rather than being absorbed by the other pieces of meat. <b>Alternatively,</b> perhaps they <b>poured boiling liquid on</b> the liver <b>at the outset,</b> before it was cooked with the lung and heart, <b>like that</b> custom <b>of Rav Huna,</b> for whom <b>they would pour boiling vinegar on</b> liver, <b>and</b> that of <b>Rav Naḥman,</b> for whom <b>they would pour boiling water on</b> liver. This would cook the excess blood into the liver and prevent it from diffusing into the other pieces. Abaye’s question remains unresolved.

### Part 4
<b>And</b> with regard to the pouring of boiling vinegar on the liver, <b>Rav Pappa,</b> when he was a student <b>before Rava, thought to say</b> that the <b>vinegar</b> becomes <b>prohibited</b> for consumption in the process, since it absorbs blood from the liver. Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: <b>If</b> you claim that the <b>vinegar is prohibited,</b> then the liver <b>itself</b> should <b>also</b> be <b>prohibited,</b> since <b>just as</b> the liver <b>expels</b> blood and prohibits the vinegar, so too <b>it then absorbs</b> the blood back from the forbidden vinegar. Rather, one must say that no blood is expelled from the liver during this process at all, which is why the liver is permitted afterward.

### Part 5
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav bar Shabba visited the house of Rav Naḥman. They brought him cooked liver, but</b> Rava bar Shabba <b>did not partake</b> of it. The members of the household <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: There is <b>a student</b> of Torah <b>inside</b> who <b>is not eating. And who is he? Rav bar Shabba. Rav Naḥman said to them: Feed Shabba</b> against his will.

### Part 6
The Gemara notes: Abaye’s question above with regard to liver cooked with other meat is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The liver</b> that was cooked with other pieces of meat <b>prohibits</b> them, <b>but</b> it itself <b>is not prohibited, because it expels</b> blood as it cooks <b>but does not absorb</b> it again. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> If the liver was <b>spiced</b> when cooking, it <b>prohibits</b> the other meat <b>and</b> it becomes <b>prohibited</b> as well, as the spices cause the liver to reabsorb the blood that was expelled. Likewise, if the liver was <b>stewed,</b> i.e., heavily cooked, it <b>renders</b> the other pieces <b>prohibited and</b> is itself <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna visited the house of Rabba bar Rav Naḥman</b> and dined with him on Shabbat. <b>They brought before him three <i>se’a</i></b> of fine bread that had been <b>kneaded</b> in oil and honey. Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>said to</b> the members of Rabba bar Rav Naḥman’s household: <b>Did you know that I was coming,</b> that you prepared such superior food? <b>They said to him: Are you more distinguished than</b> Shabbat, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to Shabbat: <b>“If you proclaim Shabbat a delight,</b> the sacred day of God honored” (Isaiah 58:13).

### Part 8
<b>Meanwhile,</b> Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>found</b> among the dishes before him <b>a certain liver that contained an artery suffused with blood. He said to</b> the members of the household: <b>Why do you do this?</b> Although the blood absorbed in the liver is permitted, that which is collected in the blood vessels is prohibited. The members of the household <b>said to him: Rather, what should we do</b> in order to prepare the liver? Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>said to them:</b> First <b>tear</b> the liver <b>lengthwise and widthwise, and</b> position the side with <b>the tear downward,</b> so that the blood will flow out when you place it on the fire.

### Part 9
The Gemara comments: <b>And this statement</b> applies only to <b>liver,</b> due to the blood that collects in its blood vessels; <b>but</b> there is no need to tear the <b>spleen</b> in this manner, as it <b>merely</b> contains <b>fat.</b> And this ruling <b>accords with that</b> which is reported <b>about Shmuel,</b> that his attendants <b>would prepare a dish of spleens for him on the day that he performed the practice</b> of bloodletting.

### Part 10
§ <b>It was stated:</b> If liver and other meat are roasted on spits in an oven such that <b>the liver</b> is positioned <b>on top of the meat,</b> the meat is <b>permitted</b> even though blood from the liver flows onto it. This is because <b>the blood</b> that flows from an item roasting in the oven <b>slides</b> over meat located underneath it and is not absorbed. But if <b>an udder</b> is positioned <b>on top of the meat</b> when roasted in the oven, the meat is <b>prohibited. What is the reason?</b> It is that the <b>milk</b> expelled by the roasting udder <b>adheres to</b> and is absorbed by the meat.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Dimi from Neharde’a</b> would <b>teach the opposite:</b> Whenever <b>an udder</b> is positioned <b>on top of the meat,</b> the meat is <b>permitted. What is the reason?</b> The prohibition of meat cooked in <b>milk of a slaughtered</b> animal applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and is treated less stringently. But if <b>liver</b> is positioned <b>on top of the meat,</b> the meat is <b>prohibited,</b> as the prohibition of <b>blood</b> applies <b>by Torah law,</b> and one must be concerned that perhaps the meat will absorb blood from the liver.

### Part 12
<b>Mareimar taught</b> in public: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is: <b>Whether</b> in the case of <b>liver or</b> in the case of <b>an udder,</b> if it is <b>underneath the meat,</b> the meat is <b>permitted,</b> but if it is <b>on top of the meat,</b> then <b>after the fact, yes,</b> the meat is permitted, but <b><i>ab initio</i>, no,</b> one may not situate them in this manner.

### Part 13
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ashi arrived at the house of his father-in-law Rami bar Abba,</b> and <b>he saw that the son of Rami bar Abba was</b>
