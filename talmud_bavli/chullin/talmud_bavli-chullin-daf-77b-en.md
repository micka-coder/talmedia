and <b>if</b> you say it was <b>with regard to the ritual impurity of animal carcasses, we</b> already <b>learn</b> that <i>halakha</i> as well in another <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 2
The Gemara elaborates: With regard to the <b>ritual impurity of food,</b> it is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The hide and the placenta</b> of an animal, which people do not typically eat, <b>cannot become impure</b> with the <b>ritual impurity of foods.</b> But <b>a hide that one cooked</b> until it became edible <b>and a placenta that one intended</b> to eat <b>can become impure</b> with the <b>impurity of foods.</b>

### Part 3
With regard to <b>the ritual impurity of animal carcasses also, we</b> already <b>learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And when a domesticated animal dies, of those that you eat, one who touches <b>its carcass</b> shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The verse indicates that one is rendered impure if he touches its carcass, <b>but not</b> if he touches its <b>hide, and not its bones, and not</b> its <b>sinews, and not</b> its <b>horns, and not</b> its <b>hooves.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And Rabba bar Rav Ḥana said</b> with regard to this <i>baraita</i>: This derivation <b>is necessary only</b> for a case in <b>which one prepared</b> these parts of the animal as a meat <b>pudding [<i>tzikei kedera</i>],</b> in which they are cooked for an extended period and spices are added. One might have thought they would be considered edible flesh and therefore impart the impurity of a carcass. The <i>baraita</i> therefore teaches that this is not so.

### Part 5
Given these two <i>baraitot</i>, why did Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa inquire about the status of the cooked hide of a donkey? The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa was inquiring about <b>the impurity of foods, and</b> although the <i>halakha</i> was already taught in the first <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa thought it is possible that <b>the hide of a donkey is different, as it is repulsive</b> and perhaps even when cooked it is not regarded as food.

### Part 6
§ The mishna states: With regard to <b>a placenta,</b> part of <b>which emerged</b> from the womb before the mother was slaughtered, its consumption is prohibited, as there is a concern that the head of the fetus might have emerged in that part of the placenta. Commenting on this mishna, <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where there was no fetus</b> found <b>in</b> the mother’s womb. <b>But if there was a fetus</b> with its head and the majority of its body <b>in</b> the womb, <b>one</b> need <b>not be concerned for</b> the existence of <b>another fetus</b> that might have been in the placenta. Therefore, the consumption of the placenta is permitted. <b>But Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Whether there was no fetus</b> found <b>in</b> the womb, or <b>whether there was a fetus, one</b> needs to <b>be concerned for</b> the existence of <b>another fetus</b> in the placenta, and therefore its consumption is prohibited.

### Part 7
According to the way the Gemara records the dispute, Rabbi Yoḥanan rules stringently and Rabbi Elazar rules leniently. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rabbi Yirmeya say</b> concerning this dispute: <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> an explanation of the mishna that presents <b>a stringency?</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rather, if it was stated, it was stated like this: Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The ruling of the mishna is that the placenta is prohibited even if a fetus is found inside the womb. But the Sages <b>taught</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the placenta <b>is not attached to</b> the <b>fetus</b> found inside. Consequently, one must be concerned with the possibility that the placenta came from another fetus that already left the womb, and it is therefore prohibited. <b>But if it is attached to</b> the <b>fetus</b> found inside, <b>there is no concern for</b> the possibility that the placenta came from <b>another fetus,</b> and therefore it is permitted.

### Part 9
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In my understanding of the mishna, <b>we have</b> the ruling that the placenta is prohibited <b>only</b> in a case where there is <b>a placenta without</b> any <b>fetus</b> being found. <b>But if a fetus was</b> found <b>with it,</b> then <b>whether it is attached to the fetus</b> or <b>whether it is not attached to the fetus, there is no concern for</b> the existence of <b>another fetus.</b> The Gemara confirms: <b>And this</b> understanding of the two opinions <b>is</b> in line with that which <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says: Rabbi Elazar said</b> an explanation of the mishna that presents <b>a stringency.</b>

### Part 10
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar:</b> The periods of purity and impurity observed by a woman after giving birth apply only after delivering a fetus with a human form. With regard to a woman <b>who expels</b> a fetus that has the form of <b>a type of domesticated animal, undomesticated animal, or bird, and</b> there is <b>a placenta with them,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: <b>When</b> the placenta is <b>attached to them, there is no concern for</b> the existence of <b>another fetus</b> that may have had a human form. But if the placenta is <b>not attached to them,</b> it is possible there was another fetus that had a human form and so <b>I</b> must <b>impose upon</b> the woman <b>the severity of two</b> types of <b>births,</b> i.e., both the longer period of impurity observed after delivering a female, and the shorter period of purity observed after delivering a male.

### Part 11
The reason is <b>that I</b> can <b>say:</b> Perhaps the placenta that was found did not come from the fetus that was found, but from a fetus with a human form. To say this one must be concerned with the possibility that <b>perhaps</b> the <b>fetus of</b> the <b>placenta</b> that was found had a human form, and that fetus <b>dissolved,</b> and <b>perhaps</b> the <b>placenta of</b> the <b>fetus</b> that was found <b>dissolved.</b>

### Part 12
§ The mishna states: If <b>an animal that was giving birth to its firstborn expelled</b> a placenta, one may cast it to the dogs. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this ruling? <b>Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, said: The majority of domesticated animals give birth to something that</b> can be <b>consecrated</b> with <b>firstborn status,</b> i.e., an animal with the same form as its mother, <b>but a minority of animals</b> give birth to <b>something that cannot</b> be consecrated with <b>firstborn status, and what is this?</b> It is an animal that <b>resembles</b> a species other than that of its mother.

### Part 13
<b>And</b> furthermore, with regard to <b>all gestating</b> animals, when they <b>give birth, half</b> of their offspring are <b>male and half</b> are <b>female.</b> Therefore, one can <b>combine the minority</b> of animals that <b>resemble</b> another species <b>with the half</b> that are <b>females, and</b> arrive at the conclusion that <b>male</b> offspring that resemble their species, which are the only offspring that can be consecrated with firstborn status, <b>are the minority.</b> Accordingly, one does not need to be concerned that the placenta found was from an animal consecrated with the status of a firstborn.

### Part 14
§ The continuation of the mishna states: <b>But in</b> the case of <b>sacrificial</b> animals the placenta <b>must be buried,</b> because it came from a fetus that is assumed to have been sacred. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> to assume this? The Gemara answers: It is because the <b>majority</b> of the offspring of sacrificial animals <b>are fit to be sacred,</b> as, in contrast to firstborn status, both female and male offspring of sacrificial animals can be sacred. Therefore, one must be concerned that the offspring, and its placenta, were sacred.

### Part 15
§ The mishna adds: <b>But one may neither bury it</b> at an intersection, nor may one hang it on a tree, due to the prohibition against following the ways of the Amorite. The Gemara cites <b>Abaye and Rava, who both said: Anything that has</b> an apparently effective <b>medicinal</b> purpose or any other logical reason behind it <b>is not subject to</b> the prohibition against following <b>the ways of the Amorite.</b> But if <b>it does not have</b> an apparently effective <b>medicinal</b> purpose <b>it is subject to</b> the prohibition against following <b>the ways of the Amorite.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there is <b>a tree that sheds its fruit</b> prematurely, <b>one may paint it with red paint and load it with stones,</b> even though this is the practice of the Amorites? The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>Granted,</b> it is permitted <b>to load it with stones,</b> as one does so for a logical reason, <b>in order</b>
