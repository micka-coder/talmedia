### Part 1
<b>from above too there is a membrane</b> that should prevent the forbidden fat from flowing onto the piece of meat even if the forbidden fat is placed directly upon it. The Gemara explains: <b>Since the hand of the slaughterer touches</b> the upper membrane, that membrane <b>disintegrates</b> and the forbidden fat flows onto the meat.

### Part 2
§ <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: A Torah scholar is required to learn</b> the requisite skills to perform <b>three matters: Writing,</b> so that he will be able to write texts on various occasions, <b>ritual slaughter, and circumcision. And Rav Ḥananya bar Shelamya says in the name of Rav:</b> He must <b>also</b> learn to tie <b>the knot of the phylacteries, and</b> to recite <b>the blessing of the grooms</b> by heart and with the traditional intonation, <b>and</b> to tie <b>ritual fringes</b> to the corners of a garment. The Gemara notes: <b>And the other</b> <i>amora</i>, Rav Yehuda, holds that <b>those</b> skills <b>are commonplace</b> and do not require special training.

### Part 3
§ <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>any slaughterer who does not know the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual slaughter,</b> it is <b>prohibited to eat from his slaughter. And these are the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual slaughter: Interrupting</b> the slaughter, <b>pressing</b> the knife, <b>concealing</b> the knife under the windpipe or the gullet in the course of an inverted slaughter, <b>diverting</b> the knife from the place of slaughter, <b>and ripping</b> the <i>simanim</i> from their place before cutting them.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the novelty in what Rav is <b>teaching us? We learned all of them</b> in the <i>mishnayot</i> in the second chapter of this tractate, and therefore it is obvious that a slaughterer who does not know these <i>halakhot</i> is not qualified. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> the slaughterer <b>slaughtered before us twice or three times and slaughtered well. Lest you say: From</b> the fact <b>that he slaughtered the other</b> animals <b>well, this</b> animal <b>he also slaughtered well;</b> therefore, Rav <b>teaches us: Since he did not learn</b> the <i>halakhot</i>, <b>sometimes</b> it happens <b>that he interrupts</b> the slaughter <b>or presses</b> the knife, <b>and he does not know</b> that he invalidated the slaughter.

### Part 5
§ <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: The slaughterer must examine the <i>simanim</i>,</b> the windpipe and the gullet, <b>after</b> completing the <b>slaughter. Rav Yosef said: We learn</b> in a mishna (32a) <b>as well: Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The slaughter is not valid <b>if he interrupted</b> the slaughter for an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of <b>an examination. What, is it not</b> an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of <b>an examination of the <i>simanim</i>?</b> Apparently, one is obligated to examine the <i>simanim</i>.

### Part 6
<b>Abaye said to him: No, this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of <b>an examination</b> of the knife, as the Sages instituted that one must take the knife to be examined by a Torah <b>scholar</b> prior to slaughtering the animal. Rav Yosef said to him: <b>If so, you have rendered your statement</b> subject <b>to circumstances,</b> as sometimes the Torah scholar is near and sometimes the Torah scholar is far, and the time required for examination varies accordingly. <b>Rather,</b> it is an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of <b>an examination</b> performed by <b>a slaughterer</b> who is a Torah <b>scholar.</b> In that case, the travel time is not factored, just the time of the examination, which does not vary.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: If the slaughterer <b>did not examine</b> the <i>simanim</i> after completing slaughter of the animal, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Antigonus says in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yannai:</b> The halakhic status of the slaughtered animal is that of <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, and it is forbidden for consumption,</b> but it does not impart impurity. <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> Its halakhic status is that of <b>an unslaughtered carcass, and it imparts impurity by means of carrying</b> it.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the application of the <i>halakha</i> stated by <b>Rav Huna, who says: An animal during its lifetime exists with the presumptive status of prohibition,</b> as it is prohibited to eat a living animal, and it continues to have this status even after its death <b>until it will become known to you in what</b> manner <b>it was slaughtered,</b> i.e., whether it was properly slaughtered. Once the animal <b>was slaughtered,</b> it exists <b>with the presumptive status of permissibility until it will become known to you in what</b> manner <b>it was rendered a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 9
It is with regard to the application of this <i>halakha</i> that Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yannai, and the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> disagree in a case where the slaughterer did not examine the <i>simanim</i> after completing the slaughter. One <b>Sage holds:</b> Since it has not been verified that the animal was slaughtered properly, the animal <b>exists with the presumptive status of prohibition, and</b> since <b>now it is dead,</b> it assumes the status of an unslaughtered carcass and imparts impurity. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage holds: With</b> regard to <b>the presumptive status of prohibition, we say</b> that the animal is forbidden until it is verified that it was slaughtered properly; <b>with regard to the presumptive status of ritual impurity we do not say</b> that the animal is impure, as a living animal is not ritually impure.

### Part 10
§ The Gemara proceeds to analyze <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav Huna says: An animal during its lifetime exists with the presumptive status of prohibition until it will become known to you in what</b> manner <b>it was slaughtered.</b> Once the animal <b>was slaughtered, it exists with the presumptive status of permissibility until it will become known to you in what</b> manner <b>it was rendered a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> The Gemara challenges this: <b>And let us say</b> that once the animal <b>was slaughtered, it became permitted,</b> instead of saying that it exists with the presumptive status of permissibility. The Gemara explains: <b>This teaches us that even if a flaw developed in</b> the animal that raises uncertainty with regard to its permitted status, it retains its presumptive status of permissibility.

### Part 11
<b>As Rabbi Abba raised a dilemma before Rav Huna:</b> If <b>a wolf came and took</b> the <b>innards</b> of a slaughtered animal, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>Took?</b> In that case the innards <b>are not</b> there, and therefore there is no way of seeing an indication of a flaw. <b>Rather,</b> the dilemma is: In a case where a wolf <b>perforated the innards</b> of a slaughtered animal, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara challenges: <b>Perforated? We see that</b> the wolf <b>perforated them</b> and in that case too there is no indication of a flaw. <b>Rather,</b> the dilemma is: In a case where a wolf <b>took</b> the innards <b>and returned them when they are perforated, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Are we concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the wolf <b>perforated</b> the innards <b>in the place of</b> a preexisting <b>perforation</b> and the animal was a <i>tereifa</i> from the outset, <b>or</b> is that possibility <b>not</b> a concern?

### Part 13
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abba: <b>One is not concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the wolf <b>perforated</b> the innards <b>in the place of</b> a preexisting <b>perforation,</b> because one relies on the presumptive status of permissibility.

### Part 14
Rabbi Abba <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rav Huna: If <b>one saw a bird pecking at a fig or a mouse gnawing at melons,</b>
