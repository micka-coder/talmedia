### Part 1
<b>one is concerned that perhaps</b> the bird or the mouse <b>perforated</b> it <b>in the place of</b> the preexisting <b>perforation</b> caused by a snake, and it is prohibited to eat the fig or the melon, due to the danger that the snake might have left its venom.

### Part 2
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abba: <b>Are you comparing danger to prohibition? Danger is different,</b> and one rules stringently in cases involving danger. <b>Rava said to him: What is different</b> about the fact that the ruling in cases of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>danger</b> is <b>stringent,</b> given that in cases of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>prohibition</b> the ruling is <b>also stringent?</b>

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>And is there no difference between prohibition and danger? But isnâ€™t</b> it the <i>halakha</i> that in a case of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>ritual impurity in the public domain, its uncertain</b> impurity leaves it <b>pure, while</b> in a case of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>water</b> that is <b>exposed</b> and therefore susceptible to a snake leaving venom in it, the water is <b>forbidden.</b>

### Part 4
Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>There,</b> in the case of ritual impurity in the public domain, the Sages <b>learned this <i>halakha</i> through tradition from</b> the case of <b>a <i>sota</i>,</b> a woman who enters into seclusion with a particular man after her husband warns her not to. She is forbidden to her husband even though there is uncertainty whether or not she committed adultery. <b>Just as a <i>sota</i> is</b> forbidden only in a case of uncertainty <b>in the private domain,</b> as there is no seclusion in the public domain; <b>so too</b> with regard to <b>ritual impurity,</b> one becomes ritually impure in a case of uncertainty only <b>in the private domain.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Shimi raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rava from a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 4:2): If the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> was <b>in the mouth of a weasel, and</b> that <b>weasel</b> was <b>walking on loaves of <i>teruma</i>,</b> and there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether the creeping animal <b>touched</b> the loaves and <b>uncertainty</b> whether it <b>did not touch</b> the loaves, <b>its uncertain</b> impurity leaves it <b>pure, while</b> in a case of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>water</b> that is <b>exposed</b> and therefore susceptible to a snake leaving venom in it, the water is <b>forbidden.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>There too, the <i>halakha</i> is derived from</b> the case of <b>a <i>sota</i>. Just as</b> the uncertainty in the case of <b><i>sota</i></b> involves <b>an entity that has consciousness</b> in order for her <b>to be asked</b> whether she was unfaithful and is forbidden to her husband, <b>so too here,</b> only uncertainty involving <b>an entity that has consciousness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked</b> whether the loaves were rendered impure would become impure. The weasel does not have that consciousness.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ashi said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> additional proof that danger is more severe than prohibition (see mishna <i>Para</i> 11:1): In the case of <b>a flask</b> of purification water <b>that one left exposed and he came</b> back <b>and found it covered,</b> it is <b>ritually impure, as I say: An impure man entered into there and covered</b> it, and in the course of doing so he rendered the vessel and its contents impure.

### Part 8
In a case where <b>one left</b> the vessel <b>covered and came</b> back <b>and found it exposed, if</b> it is in a place where <b>a weasel could drink from it, or a snake according to the statement of Rabban Gamliel, or</b> if there is concern <b>that dew fell into it at night,</b> the purification waters are <b>disqualified</b> for sprinkling in the process of purification of a person impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, due to the concern that the saliva of the weasel or the dew, which are unfit for sprinkling, intermingled with it. Nevertheless, the water is not impure.

### Part 9
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: What is the reason</b> that there is no concern that a ritually impure person exposed the waters and rendered them impure?
