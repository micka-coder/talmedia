### Part 1
The signs are given <b>to permit its</b> forbidden <b>fat,</b> i.e., to deem the animal undomesticated. Fat that is forbidden for consumption in domesticated animals is permitted in undomesticated animals. <b>And this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: These are the signs of a</b> kosher <b>undomesticated animal,</b> so that one will know <b>that its fat is permitted: Any</b> animal <b>that has horns and</b> cloven <b>hooves</b> is an undomesticated animal.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Dosa says:</b> If <b>it has horns,</b> it is certainly a kosher undomesticated animal, and <b>you need not search for</b> cloven <b>hooves.</b> But if <b>it has</b> cloven <b>hooves, you must</b> still <b>search for horns. And</b> with regard to the animal called <b>a <i>keresh</i>, even though it has only one horn,</b> its fat <b>is permitted</b> for consumption.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> this an established <b>principle? But</b> isn’t there <b>a goat, which has horns and</b> cloven <b>hooves, and</b> still <b>its fat is forbidden,</b> as it is a domesticated animal? The Gemara responds: <b>We require</b> horns that are <b>layered</b> to designate a kosher animal as undomesticated; a goat’s horns are not layered. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t there <b>a bull, which</b> has <b>layered</b> horns, <b>and</b> still <b>its fat is forbidden</b> since it is domesticated? The Gemara responds: <b>We require horns</b> that are <b>grooved;</b> a bull’s horns are not grooved.

### Part 4
The Gemara persists: <b>But</b> isn’t there <b>a goat, which</b> has <b>grooved</b> horns, <b>and</b> still <b>its fat is forbidden?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>We require</b> horns that are <b>branched;</b> a goat’s horns are not branched. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t there <b>a gazelle [<i>tzevi</i>],</b> whose horns <b>are not branched, and</b> still <b>its fat is permitted?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>We require</b> horns that are <b>rounded</b> and not broad like those of a sheep.

### Part 5
The Gemara concludes: <b>Therefore, where</b> an animal’s horns are <b>branched, there is neither judgment nor judge,</b> and the animal is without a doubt undomesticated. <b>Where</b> they are <b>not branched, we require</b> that they be <b>layered, rounded, and grooved. And it</b> must be grooved in a pattern such <b>that its grooves are absorbed</b> into one another.

### Part 6
<b>And this is the uncertainty</b> that arose concerning the <b><i>karkoz</i> goat,</b> i.e., whether it is considered a domesticated animal. As there was <b>a certain <i>karkoz</i> goat that was in the house of the Exilarch, from which</b> they <b>removed a full basket of fat</b> after slaughtering it. <b>Rav Aḥai deemed</b> the fat <b>forbidden,</b> because he considered it a domesticated animal. But <b>Rav Shmuel, son of Rabbi Abbahu, ate of it. He read</b> the verse <b>about himself: “A man’s belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth”</b> (Proverbs 18:20). In other words, due to his learning, he knew it was permitted to eat the fat of the <i>karkoz</i> goat.

### Part 7
The Sages <b>sent</b> a message <b>from there,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of</b> Rav <b>Shmuel, son of Rabbi Abbahu,</b> that a <i>karkoz</i> goat is an undomesticated animal and its fat is permitted; <b>but</b> nevertheless, <b>be mindful of</b> the honor of <b>our teacher Aḥai</b> who deems it forbidden, and do not partake of the fat in his presence, <b>as he enlightens the eyes of the exile.</b>

### Part 8
§ The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And</b> with regard to the animal called <b>a <i>keresh</i>, even though it has only one horn,</b> its fat <b>is permitted</b> for consumption. <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> The <b><i>keresh</i></b> is the <b>gazelle</b> that is native to the area <b>of Bei Ila’ei.</b> The <b><i>tagras</i></b> mentioned by the Sages is the <b>lion of Bei Ila’ei. Rav Kahana says: There are nine cubits between the ears of the lion of Bei Ila’ei. Rav Yosef says: The length of the gazelle of Bei Ila’ei is sixteen cubits.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara recounts: The Roman <b>emperor said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: Your God is compared to a lion, as it is written: “The lion has roared, who will not fear”</b> (Amos 3:8). But if so, <b>what is His greatness? A cavalryman</b> can <b>kill a lion.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him:</b> God <b>is not compared to that lion</b> which a cavalryman can kill. Rather, God is <b>compared to the lion of Bei Ila’ei.</b> The emperor <b>said to him: I ask that you show it to me.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: You cannot see it.</b> The emperor <b>said to him: Truly, I</b> wish to <b>see it.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>prayed for mercy,</b> and the lion of Bei Ila’ei <b>set off from its place</b> of origin toward Rome.

### Part 10
<b>When it was four hundred parasangs away</b> from Rome, <b>it roared once,</b> and <b>all the pregnant women miscarried, and the wall of Rome fell. When it was three hundred parasangs away, it roared another</b> time, and all <b>the men’s front and back teeth fell out</b> from fear. <b>And even he,</b> the emperor, <b>fell from his throne to the ground.</b> The emperor <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>I beg you, pray for mercy with regard to it, that it should go back to the place</b> from which <b>it</b> came. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>prayed for mercy with regard to it, and it returned to the place</b> from which <b>it</b> came.

### Part 11
§ The Gemara recounts: <b>The emperor said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: I wish to see your God.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: You cannot see Him.</b> The emperor <b>said to him: Truly,</b>
