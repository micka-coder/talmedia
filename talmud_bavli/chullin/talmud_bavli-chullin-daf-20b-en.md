### Part 1
<b>But according to the one who says: There is</b> a source for the <b>slaughter of a bird in the Torah, there is</b> disqualification for <b>ripping</b> <i>simanim</i> in a bird as well.

### Part 2
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: On the contrary, the opposite is reasonable. According to the one who says: There is</b> a source for the <b>slaughter of a bird in the Torah,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter are not explicit and were transmitted to Moses orally, and <b>it can be said that this is what</b> God <b>taught him, that there is no</b> disqualification for <b>ripping</b> <i>simanim</i>. <b>And even according to the one who says</b> that the halakhic status of a bird is <b>like</b> that of <b>an animal,</b> as the <i>halakhot</i> of the slaughter of a bird are derived from the <i>halakhot</i> of the slaughter of an animal, perhaps God taught Moses that with regard <b>to the matter of ripping</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>it will not be like an animal.</b>

### Part 3
<b>But according to the one who says: There is no</b> source for the <b>slaughter of a bird in the Torah,</b> but <b>rather</b> it is <b>by rabbinic law, from where are</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the slaughter of a bird <b>learned?</b> They are learned <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the slaughter of <b>an animal;</b> consequently, <b>the entire matter</b> of the slaughter of a bird is <b>like</b> that of <b>an animal.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Ravina said: Ravin bar Kisi said to me:</b> With regard to <b>that which Rami bar Yeḥezkel teaches,</b> i.e., that <b>there is no</b> disqualification for <b>ripping <i>simanim</i> in a bird, we say</b> it <b>only with regard to pinching, but with regard to slaughter, there is</b> disqualification for <b>ripping</b> <i>simanim</i>. The Gemara objects: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yirmeya say</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Any</b> place <b>that is valid for slaughter</b> on the throat <b>is correspondingly valid for pinching on the nape, but</b> that which is <b>not valid</b> for slaughter is <b>not valid</b> for pinching. The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>disagrees</b> with this statement of Shmuel.

### Part 5
§ <b>Ze’eiri says:</b> If <b>the neck bone</b> of an animal or a bird <b>was broken and most of the</b> surrounding <b>flesh</b> was cut <b>with it,</b> the status of the animal or the bird is that of <b>an unslaughtered carcass.</b> It is dead and can no longer be rendered fit by slaughter.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>we learn</b> this in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 68a) as well: If <b>one pinched</b> a bird offering <b>with a knife</b> and not with his thumbnail, the bird <b>renders the garments</b> of one who swallows it <b>impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat,</b> which is the <i>halakha</i> in the case of an unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird. <b>And if you would say</b> that if the neck bone of an animal or a bird was broken and most of the surrounding flesh was cut with it, the bird is not an unslaughtered carcass but <b>it is a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> then since with regard to a bird offering <b>its pinching is its slaughter, let</b> pinching with <b>a knife be effective to purify</b> the bird <b>from</b> the impurity of <b>an unslaughtered carcass,</b> as a <i>tereifa</i> does not transmit impurity when slaughtered properly. From the <i>halakha</i> that pinching with a knife does not render the bird pure it is evident that when its neck bone is broken the bird is rendered an unslaughtered carcass.

### Part 7
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>There,</b> pinching with a knife is ineffective in rendering it pure not because the breaking of the neck bone renders the bird an unslaughtered carcass. Rather, it is <b>because it is not slaughter at all.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? Rav Huna says:</b> It is <b>because he conceals</b> the knife and performs an inverted slaughter, which invalidates the slaughter. <b>Rava says:</b> It is <b>because he presses</b> the knife.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>the one who says: Because he conceals</b> the knife and performs an inverted slaughter, <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>he does not say: Because he presses</b> the knife? The Gemara answers: It is because <b>he holds</b> that <b>drawing back and forth in pinching is valid.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And the one who says: Because he presses</b> the knife, <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>he does not say: Because he conceals [<i>maḥlid</i>]</b> the knife? The Gemara answers that <b>he</b> could have <b>said to you: What are the circumstances of concealing</b> the knife? It is <b>like a rat [<i>ḥulda</i>] that resides in the foundations of houses that are concealed. Here,</b> when he begins cutting from the nape of the neck, <b>that</b> knife <b>is exposed.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rava said: If</b> that which Ze’eiri said: If the neck bone of an animal or a bird was broken and most of the surrounding flesh was cut with it, the status of the animal or the bird is that of an unslaughtered carcass, is <b>difficult for me, this</b> is <b>difficult for me:</b> How does pinching a bird offering prepare it for sacrifice? Since pinching involves breaking the neck bone and cutting most of the surrounding flesh with it before cutting the <i>simanim</i>, what significance is there to pinching the <i>simanim</i>? <b>And does he stand and pinch a dead</b> bird? If it is dead, of what use is the pinching?

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said to him: And</b> even without the statement of Ze’eiri, <b>let</b> the case of <b>a bird burnt offering be difficult for you, as</b> it <b>requires</b> cutting of <b>two <i>simanim</i>.</b> Since slaughter of a non-sacred bird requires cutting of one <i>siman</i>, once one <i>siman</i> is cut the bird is considered dead for all intents and purposes, <b>and does he stand and pinch a dead</b> bird? Rava <b>said to him: There,</b> he continues pinching <b>in order to fulfill through it the mitzva of separation</b> between the head and the body in the bird burnt offering.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> there should be an obligation to cut the <b>skin</b> of the bird <b>as well</b> in order to fulfill the mitzva of separation. Abaye answers: <b>Any</b> element <b>that invalidates slaughter invalidates separation, and any</b> element <b>that does not invalidate slaughter does not invalidate separation.</b> Failure to cut the skin does not invalidate slaughter.

### Part 12
The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t</b> there <b>the minority of the <i>simanim</i> according to the Rabbis, which do not invalidate slaughter,</b> as, if one slaughtered a majority of the <i>simanim</i> and a minority remained uncut, the slaughter is valid, <b>and</b> they hold that <b>they invalidate separation?</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>Rather, say: Any</b> element <b>that is</b> in effect <b>with regard to slaughter is</b> in effect <b>with regard to separation, and any</b> element <b>that is not</b> in effect <b>with regard to slaughter is not</b> in effect <b>with regard to separation.</b> The two <i>simanim</i>, although they do not invalidate slaughter, are part of the mitzva of slaughter, while the skin is not part of the mitzva of slaughter.
