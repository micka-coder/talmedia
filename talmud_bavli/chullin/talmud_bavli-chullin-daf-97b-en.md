<b>and the Sages said</b> that there are cases where the mixture is permitted if there is <b>sixty</b> times as much permitted food as forbidden food. <b>Therefore,</b> in a case where the mixture is <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food <b>not</b> of <b>its</b> own <b>type,</b> so that there is a difference in taste between the two components, <b>when</b> there are Jews for whom the mixture is <b>permitted,</b> one relies <b>on</b> a Jew <b>tasting</b> the mixture. This is the <i>halakha</i> when <i>teruma</i> is cooked with non-sacred food. <b>When</b> the mixture is potentially <b>forbidden,</b> e.g., in the case of meat cooked with milk, one relies <b>on</b> a gentile <b>cook</b> to taste it.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> if the mixture is composed of <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food of <b>its</b> own <b>type, where one cannot ascertain</b> whether the forbidden component has imparted <b>flavor; or</b> if it is composed of <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food <b>not</b> of <b>its</b> own <b>type when</b> the mixture may be <b>forbidden</b> and it is a case <b>where there is no</b> gentile <b>cook</b> available to taste it, the mixture is permitted if there is <b>sixty</b> times as much permitted food as forbidden food.

### Part 3
§ The Gemara (96b) cited Shmuel’s opinion with regard to the thigh of an animal that was roasted or cooked with the sciatic nerve still inside. The Gemara relates the following incident: There were <b>those</b> animal <b>thighs that were salted in the home of the Exilarch with the sciatic nerve</b> still inside; <b>Ravina</b> ruled that they were <b>forbidden,</b> whereas <b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Ashi</b> ruled that they were <b>permitted. They came and asked Mar bar Rav Ashi</b> to render a decision. <b>He said to them:</b> My <b>father permitted</b> the meat in such circumstances.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav said to Ravina: What is your reasoning</b> in prohibiting the meat? Is it because of <b>what Shmuel said: A salted</b> food item <b>is</b> considered <b>like a boiling hot</b> food item, and a food item <b>marinated</b> in vinegar, brine, or the like <b>is</b> considered <b>like a cooked</b> food item? Perhaps based on this statement of Shmuel you consider the salted thighs as though they have been cooked with their sciatic nerves, in which case they are forbidden.

### Part 5
<b>But didn’t Shmuel</b> also <b>say</b> (96b): <b>They taught</b> that the thigh is entirely forbidden <b>only when it was cooked</b> with the sciatic nerve <b>inside it. But</b> if the sciatic nerve was <b>roasted inside</b> the thigh, one may <b>peel</b> away the meat <b>and eat</b> it <b>until he reaches the</b> sciatic <b>nerve,</b> and then he removes the nerve.

### Part 6
<b>And if you would say: What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>Like a boiling hot</b> food item, <b>that</b> Shmuel <b>said?</b> It is <b>like boiling hot</b> food <b>that was cooked</b> rather than hot food that was roasted, and therefore if the thigh was salted with its sciatic nerve the entire thigh becomes forbidden. This is not a convincing claim, because <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> Shmuel <b>said:</b> A food item <b>marinated</b> in vinegar, brine, or the like <b>is</b> considered <b>like a cooked</b> food item, it may be understood <b>by inference</b> that <b>when he said</b> that salted food is like <b>boiling hot</b> food he <b>was saying</b> that it is <b>like boiling hot</b> food <b>that is roasted.</b> The Gemara concludes: This poses <b>a difficulty</b> to the opinion of Ravina.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara elaborates on the statement that if permitted and forbidden foods are cooked together and there is sixty times as much permitted food as forbidden food, the mixture is permitted. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: When they assess</b> whether or not there is sixty times as much permitted food, <b>they assess</b> the volume of <b>the broth, the deposits [<i>kifa</i>], the pieces</b> of permitted food cooked in the pot, <b>and the pot</b> itself. The Gemara explains this last point: <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> this means that one includes the volume of the material of <b>the pot itself, and there are</b> those <b>who say</b> it means that one includes the volume of <b>that which the pot has absorbed</b> from the permitted food. When meat cooks its volume decreases, and some of the meat that constitutes that discrepancy is absorbed into the sides of the pot.

### Part 8
The Gemara continues its discussion of nullification. <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>all forbidden</b> foods <b>that are</b> prohibited <b>in the Torah,</b> if they are cooked with permitted food and one cannot tell whether they have imparted flavor to the permitted food, <b>we assess</b> the mixture <b>as though</b> the forbidden food were <b>onion or leek [<i>kaflot</i>].</b> If that amount of onions or leeks would impart flavor to the permitted food, one must assume that the mixture is forbidden.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Abba said to Abaye: But let one assess</b> the mixture as though the forbidden food were <b>pepper or</b> other <b>spices, which</b> are even more pungent, in which case <b>they</b> would <b>not be nullified even</b> if they were mixed <b>with a thousand</b> times as much permitted food. Abaye <b>said to him: The Sages ascertained that with regard to forbidden</b> foods, <b>there is nothing that imparts more flavor</b> to a mixture <b>than onion and leek.</b>

### Part 10
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the nullification of forbidden foods. <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> A sciatic <b>nerve</b> that was cooked with kosher food is nullified if the mixture contains permitted food that is <b>sixty</b> times the nerve’s volume, <b>and the</b> sciatic <b>nerve</b> itself <b>is not counted</b> in that number, because it cannot nullify itself. If <b>an udder,</b> which is meat but also contains milk, is cooked with other meat, the milk is nullified if the meat is <b>sixty</b> times its volume, <b>and</b> the <b>udder</b> itself <b>is counted</b> with the rest of the meat. If the <b>egg</b> of a non-kosher bird is cooked with kosher food, it is nullified if the permitted food is <b>sixty</b> times its volume, <b>and the egg</b> itself <b>is not counted</b> in that number, as it cannot nullify itself.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rav Mesharshiyya, says:</b> In the case of an udder cooked with meat, even if the meat is sixty times the volume of the milk, so that the meat is permitted, the <b>udder itself is forbidden,</b> because the meat imparts flavor to the milk contained within the udder, which then renders the udder forbidden. <b>And if</b> the udder subsequently <b>falls into another pot,</b> it also <b>renders</b> the contents of that pot <b>forbidden</b> unless they are sixty times the volume of the udder.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Ashi said: When we were in the study hall of Rav Kahana, a dilemma was raised before us: When we assess</b> whether the contents of the pot are sufficient to nullify the udder, <b>do we assess</b> whether the pot contains sixty times as much permitted food as the entire volume of the meat of the udder <b>itself, or do we assess</b> only <b>that</b> milk <b>which came out from</b> the udder, since the udder itself has been removed from the mixture?

### Part 13
The Gemara responds: It is <b>obvious that we assess</b> the entire volume of the meat of the udder <b>itself, as if</b> we were to attempt to assess only <b>that which came out of it, how would we know</b> how much came out? The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then if the udder <b>falls into another pot, it should not render</b> the food in that second pot <b>forbidden,</b> because it has been assumed that all the milk in the udder has been released into the first pot.

### Part 14
The Gemara explains: <b>Since Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Mesharshiyya, says</b> that even if there is sixty times as much meat in the pot as there is milk in the udder, <b>the udder itself is forbidden,</b> clearly <b>the Sages equated</b> the udder <b>with a piece of non-kosher</b> meat. Consequently, the reason the udder renders the contents of the second pot forbidden is that the udder is intrinsically forbidden, not because of the milk that is released into the pot while it is being cooked.

### Part 15
§ The Gemara addresses Rav Naḥman’s statement that if the <b>egg</b> of a non-kosher bird is cooked with kosher food, it is nullified if the permitted food is <b>sixty</b> times its volume, <b>and the egg</b> itself <b>is not counted</b> in that number, as it cannot nullify itself. <b>Rav Idi bar Avin said to Abaye:</b> Is this <b>to say that</b> the forbidden egg <b>imparts flavor</b> to the food with which it is cooked? <b>But isn’t</b> it true that when <b>people</b> want to indicate that food is tasteless, they <b>say:</b> This is <b>like mere egg-water?</b> This indicates that an egg does not impart flavor.

### Part 16
Abaye <b>said to him: Here we are dealing with</b>
