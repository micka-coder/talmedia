### Part 1
<b>If pigeons, which were not deemed fit when older, were deemed fit when younger,</b> as the term “young pigeons” indicates that they are young, then with regard to <b>doves, which were deemed fit when older, isn’t it logical that they were deemed fit when younger?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Doves,”</b> meaning <b>older and not younger.</b>

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Young pigeons</b> must be <b>younger and not older, as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>And couldn’t this</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference: If doves, which were not deemed fit when younger, were deemed fit when older,</b> then with regard to <b>pigeons, which were deemed fit when younger, isn’t it logical that they were deemed fit when older?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Young pigeons,”</b> meaning <b>younger and not older.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation</b> of these matters? <b>Rava said:</b> It is derived from the fact that it is <b>not</b> found that <b>the verse</b> would <b>deviate</b> from the norm <b>and write: Of young doves, or of pigeons;</b> rather, the wording in the Torah is always “of doves” or “of young pigeons.” Evidently, doves must be older and pigeons must be younger.

### Part 4
The Gemara objects: <b>Say</b> instead that with regard to <b>pigeons, since the Merciful One writes: “Young,”</b> this means <b>younger</b> birds, <b>yes, older</b> birds, <b>no;</b> but with regard to <b>doves, if one wishes, let him bring older</b> birds, and <b>if he wishes, let him bring younger</b> birds. The Gemara responds: Since doves and pigeons are always juxtaposed to one another in the Torah, it is derived that the <i>halakha</i> of doves is <b>similar to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>pigeons: Just as</b> with regard to <b>pigeons</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>younger</b> birds, <b>yes, older</b> birds, <b>no, so too</b> with regard to <b>doves,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>older</b> birds, <b>yes, younger</b> birds, <b>no.</b>

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that all the</b> older <b>doves or all the</b> younger <b>pigeons would be fit</b> for sacrifice; therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of doves,” and not all doves; “of young pigeons,” and not all young pigeons.</b> This serves to <b>exclude</b> birds at <b>the beginning of the yellowing</b> of their neck plumage, <b>which are unfit as this,</b> doves, <b>and as that,</b> pigeons. They are unfit as doves because they are not sufficiently old and as pigeons because they are no longer young. The <i>tanna</i> elaborates: <b>From when are the doves fit?</b> It is <b>from when</b> the color of their feathers <b>turns a glistening gold. From when are the pigeons unfit?</b> It is <b>from when</b> their feathers <b>turn yellow.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Ya’akov Korḥa taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From when are pigeons fit?</b> It is <b>from when <i>ye’alu</i>. He teaches</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>and he states its</b> explanation: The reference is to that which is stated: <b>“Its fledglings will suck up [<i>ye’alu</i>] blood”</b> (Job 39:30). <b>When</b> is that? <b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>from</b> the stage <b>when one plucks a feather from it and blood emerges.</b>

### Part 7
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering of doves or of pigeons, and he brought</b> birds at <b>the beginning of the yellowing</b> of their neck plumage <b>of this,</b> doves, <b>and of that,</b> pigeons, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Is</b> it a case of <b>uncertainty</b> whether it is considered older or younger, <b>and</b> therefore when he brings both <b>he fulfills</b> his obligation, as one of the birds was fit for sacrifice; <b>or perhaps</b> a bird at the beginning of the yellowing <b>is an entity</b> in and of itself and is neither older nor younger, <b>and he does not fulfill</b> his obligation?

### Part 8
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the <i>baraita</i> where it is taught that the verse: “Of doves or of young pigeons,” serves to <b>exclude</b> birds at <b>the beginning of the yellowing</b> of their neck plumage <b>that are unfit as this,</b> doves, <b>and as that,</b> pigeons. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that a bird at that stage <b>is an entity</b> in and of itself, that works out <b>well,</b> as the verse serves to ensure that a bird at that stage of development will never be sacrificed. <b>But if you say</b> that it <b>is</b> a case of <b>uncertainty, was</b> it <b>necessary</b> for <b>the verse to exclude</b> a case of <b>uncertainty?</b>
