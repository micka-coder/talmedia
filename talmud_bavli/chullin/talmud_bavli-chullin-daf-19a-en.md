### Part 1
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: If one slaughters <b>from the incline of the thyroid cartilage and below</b> in the direction of the windpipe, the slaughter is <b>valid, and that is in</b> accordance with the opinion <b>that one who left</b> part <b>of the arytenoid cartilage</b> has still performed a valid slaughter, as the arytenoids cartilage extends beyond this point.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Naḥman deemed</b> the slaughter <b>valid</b> in a case where one slaughtered <b>from the incline of the thyroid cartilage and below. Rav Ḥanan bar Rav Ketina said to Rav Naḥman: In accordance with whose</b> opinion is that ruling? It is <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis nor in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who both hold that if one cuts the windpipe above the large upper ring, the cricoid cartilage, the slaughter is not valid.

### Part 3
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Neither do I know Ḥillek nor do I know Billek,</b> i.e., I know the reason neither for this one’s opinion nor for that one’s opinion. <b>I know the <i>halakha</i>, as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Abba bar Zavda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: From the incline of the thyroid cartilage and below,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 4
§ The Gemara returns to analyzing the <i>baraita</i> (18b): In a case where the knife is diverted from the place of slaughter above the ring, the slaughter is not valid. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus testified about a case where the knife is diverted from the place of slaughter above the ring that the slaughter is valid. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> With regard to a case where the knife was <b>diverted</b> according to the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> cited in the mishna, the slaughter is <b>valid</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who ruled that the slaughter is valid when the majority of the windpipe was cut within the large, upper ring.

### Part 5
<b>And</b> with regard to a case where the knife was <b>diverted</b> according to the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> it is <b>valid</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus,</b> who ruled that even if a majority of the windpipe was cut outside the large upper ring, the slaughter is valid.

### Part 6
The Gemara objects: That is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that the statement of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus,</b> who ruled that in a case where the knife is diverted from the place of slaughter above the ring it is valid, <b>addresses</b> the statement <b>of the Rabbis</b> and he agrees with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, that the slaughter is not valid when the majority of the windpipe was cut above the large upper ring, therefore, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.

### Part 7
The Gemara objects: <b>And say it is indeed so</b> that Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus agrees with Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda. The Gemara responds: <b>If so,</b> the formulation of the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> been: Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus <b>testified about it.</b> Since the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus was introduced merely with the term: Testified, apparently he disagrees with all of the other opinions. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus, as Rav Naḥman holds in accordance with his</b> opinion.

### Part 8
§ The mishna cited a dispute between the Rabbis, who hold that in a case where one slaughtered within the large upper ring and did not leave a thread breadth over the entire surface of the ring, the slaughter is not valid, and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who hold that even if one left a thread breadth over a majority of the surface of the ring, the slaughter is valid. Apropos to that, <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav Asi says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> is only <b>in</b> a case <b>where one cut two-thirds</b> of the windpipe within the ring <b>and</b> then <b>diverted</b> the knife upward toward the head of the animal and cut the remaining <b>one-third, as the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>we require the entire slaughter</b> to be performed <b>within the large ring, and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds:</b> The halakhic status of <b>its majority is like</b> that of <b>its entirety.</b>

### Part 9
<b>But</b> if <b>one diverted</b> the knife upward toward the head of the animal, cut <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe, <b>and</b> then <b>cut two-thirds</b> within the ring, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the slaughter is <b>not valid, as when the life left</b> the animal, i.e., when the majority of the windpipe was cut, <b>we require</b> that the entire <b>majority</b> be cut <b>by means of slaughter, and that is not</b> so in this case.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>On the contrary, let the Master say the opposite.</b> The <b>dispute</b> is only <b>in</b> a case <b>when one diverted</b> the knife upward toward the head of the animal, cut <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe, <b>and</b> then <b>cut two-thirds</b> within the ring, <b>as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds</b> that the slaughter is valid <b>just as it is</b> in the case <b>where half the windpipe is deficient.</b> In that case, once the slaughterer cuts any additional part of the windpipe, the slaughter is valid because the cut that rendered a majority of the windpipe slaughtered was performed properly. So too in this case, since the cut of the second third was performed properly, the slaughter is valid.

### Part 11
<b>And the Rabbis</b> hold that <b>there,</b> in the case of the deficient windpipe, the deficiency was in <b>the place of</b> proper <b>slaughter,</b> and therefore most of the life of the animal left in the proper place. <b>Here,</b> the first third was cut while the knife was diverted, and therefore most of the life of the animal did <b>not</b> leave in <b>the place of</b> proper <b>slaughter.</b>

### Part 12
<b>But</b> in a case where <b>one cut two-thirds</b> of the windpipe within the ring <b>and</b> then <b>diverted</b> the knife and cut the remaining <b>one-third, everyone agrees</b> that the slaughter is <b>valid, as didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (27a): The halakhic status of the slaughter of the <b>majority of one</b> <i>siman</i>, the windpipe or the gullet, <b>is like</b> that of the slaughter of the entire <i>siman</i> <b>itself?</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav Yosef said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>Who will say to us that</b> with regard to the mishna <b>there</b> concerning <b>the majority of</b> one <i>siman</i>, <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, did not teach it? Perhaps Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, taught it,</b> and the Rabbis disagree.

### Part 14
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Is that to say</b> that with regard to <b>all</b> principles that address <b>majorities in general, Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, taught them?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: I am speaking of the</b> principle of <b>majority with regard to slaughter, as we heard that</b> the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> with him.

### Part 15
<b>Some say</b> that there is <b>an alternative version</b> of this discussion: <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav Asi says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> is only in a case <b>where one diverted</b> the knife upward toward the head of the animal, cut <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe, <b>and</b> then <b>cut two-thirds</b> within the ring, <b>as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds</b> that the slaughter is valid <b>just as it is</b> in the case <b>where half the windpipe is deficient, and the Rabbis</b> hold that <b>there,</b> in the case of the deficient windpipe, the deficiency was in <b>the place of</b> proper <b>slaughter,</b> but <b>here,</b> most of the life of the animal did <b>not</b> leave in <b>the place of</b> proper <b>slaughter.</b>

### Part 16
<b>But</b> in a case where <b>one cut two-thirds</b> of the windpipe within the ring <b>and</b> then <b>diverted</b> the knife and cut the remaining <b>one-third, everyone agrees</b> that the slaughter is <b>valid, as didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (27a): The halakhic status of the slaughter of the <b>majority of one</b> <i>siman</i>, the windpipe or the gullet, <b>is like</b> that of the slaughter of the entire <i>siman</i> <b>itself?</b>

### Part 17
<b>Rav Ḥisda objects to this: Who will say to us that</b> with regard to the mishna <b>there</b> concerning <b>the majority of</b> one <i>siman</i>, <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, did not teach it? Perhaps Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, taught it,</b> and the Rabbis disagree. <b>Rav Yosef said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>Is that to say</b> that with regard to <b>all</b> principles that address <b>majorities in general, Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, taught them?</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: I am speaking of the</b> principle of <b>majority with regard to slaughter, as we heard that</b> the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> with him.

### Part 18
§ If <b>one diverted</b> the knife and cut <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe, <b>and</b> then <b>cut one-third</b> properly, <b>and</b> then <b>diverted</b> and cut the final <b>one-third, Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav says:</b> The slaughter is <b>valid. Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Rav says:</b> The animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> i.e., forbidden. <b>Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav says:</b> The slaughter is <b>valid,</b> as <b>when the life left</b> the animal, it was <b>in</b> the course of a valid <b>slaughter</b> that <b>it left. Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Rav says:</b> The animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, as we require a majority</b> of the windpipe to be cut <b>with</b> valid <b>slaughter,and</b> that <b>is not</b> the case.

### Part 19
If <b>one cut one-third</b> of the windpipe properly, <b>and</b> then <b>diverted</b> the knife and cut <b>one-third, and</b> then <b>cut</b> the final <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe properly, <b>Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Rav said:</b> The slaughter is <b>valid.</b> When the Sages <b>came and asked Rav Huna, he said to them:</b> It is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. Rav Yehuda heard</b> the ruling of Rav Huna, and <b>he was angry. He said: I deem</b> it <b>a <i>tereifa</i> and he deems</b> the slaughter <b>valid, and I deem</b> the slaughter <b>valid</b> and <b>he deems</b> it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. Rav Huna said:</b> It is <b>proper</b> that <b>he was angry. One</b> reason is that <b>he heard</b> it <b>from Rav and I did not hear</b> it from Rav; <b>and furthermore, isn’t there the majority</b> of the <i>siman</i> that was cut <b>with</b> valid <b>slaughter?</b>

### Part 20
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>Do not retract</b> your statement,
