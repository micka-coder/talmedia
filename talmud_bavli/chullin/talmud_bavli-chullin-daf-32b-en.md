### Part 1
An animal that has <b>a perforated gullet,</b> where the perforation goes through the wall of the gullet, <b>or</b> one with <b>a severed windpipe.</b> According to this mishna, the severed windpipe renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> and not an unslaughtered carcass. If Rabbi Akiva reconsidered his opinion and conceded to Rabbi Yeshevav, in accordance with the opinion of which <i>tanna</i> is that mishna?

### Part 2
<b>Rava said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where one cut</b> the gullet <b>and ultimately severed</b> the windpipe not in the standard manner. <b>There,</b> the mishna in the next chapter is referring to a case <b>where he severed</b> the windpipe not in the standard manner, <b>and ultimately cut</b> the gullet. If he <b>cut</b> the gullet <b>and ultimately severed</b> the windpipe, the animal <b>was rendered unfit during its slaughter;</b> therefore, it assumes the status of an unslaughtered carcass, according to the principle of Rabbi Yeshevav. But if <b>he severed</b> the windpipe <b>and ultimately cut</b> the gullet, it is <b>as</b> though <b>another matter caused</b> the animal <b>to become unfit;</b> therefore, it assumes the status of a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Huna raised an objection to Rava</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>cut the gullet and</b> then <b>severed the windpipe,</b> or if one <b>severed the windpipe and cut the gullet thereafter,</b> the animal is <b>an unslaughtered carcass.</b> Apparently, contrary to Rava’s statement, the order is irrelevant, and even if the windpipe is severed first, the animal assumes the status of an unslaughtered carcass.

### Part 4
Rava said: <b>Say</b> that the latter case in the <i>baraita</i> means not that he cut the gullet thereafter; rather, it is a case where one severed the windpipe <b>and had already cut the gullet at the outset.</b>

### Part 5
Rav Aḥa bar Huna <b>said to him:</b> There are <b>two refutations of the statement,</b> i.e., of your attempt to answer the difficulty from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> is that if the second case in the <i>baraita</i> is one where he initially cut the gullet, then <b>that is</b> identical to <b>the first</b> case in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>And furthermore, didn’t we learn</b> explicitly in the <i>baraita</i>: Or if one severed the windpipe and cut the gullet <b>thereafter,</b> the animal is an unslaughtered carcass?

### Part 6
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The use of the term: <i>Tereifot</i>, in the mishna in the next chapter is not to the exclusion of unslaughtered carcasses; rather, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that term in a general sense, meaning: <b>These</b> wounds serve to render an animal <b>forbidden; and there are</b> some <b>of them</b> that are <b>unslaughtered carcasses,</b> e.g., an animal with a severed windpipe, <b>and there are</b> some <b>of them</b> that are <b><i>tereifot</i>.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara objects to that interpretation: If the mishna is listing those circumstances that render the animal an unslaughtered carcass, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>consider</b> the circumstance <b>of Ḥizkiyya as well, as Ḥizkiyya says:</b> If <b>one rendered</b> the animal like <b>a shard</b> by cutting it into two widthwise, its halakhic status is that of <b>an unslaughtered carcass</b> even while it is convulsing before its death. <b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>consider</b> the circumstance <b>of Rabbi Elazar as well, as Rabbi Elazar said:</b> If <b>the thigh,</b> the hind leg of the animal, <b>was removed and its recess</b> is obvious (see 21a), it is <b>an unslaughtered carcass.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara explains: <b>When</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the case of <b>an unslaughtered carcass,</b> it is a case where the animal <b>does not</b> assume that status and <b>impart impurity while alive. But</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> the case of <b>an unslaughtered carcass</b> where the animal assumes that status and <b>imparts impurity while alive,</b> e.g., the cases of Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Elazar.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> resolved the apparent contradiction between the mishna here and the mishna on 42a, and <b>said: Here,</b> the <i>tanna</i> is referring to a case <b>where one cut</b> the gullet <b>in</b> the same <b>place</b> as the initial <b>cut</b> in the windpipe. <b>There,</b> on 42a, the <i>tanna</i> is referring to a case <b>where he cut</b> the gullet <b>not in</b> the same <b>place</b> as the initial <b>cut</b> in the windpipe. The reason for the distinction is that if <b>one cut</b> the gullet <b>in</b> the same <b>place</b> as the initial <b>cut</b> in the windpipe, it is an animal that <b>was rendered unfit during its slaughter</b> and it assumes the status of an unslaughtered carcass. By contrast, if he cut the gullet <b>not in</b> the same <b>place</b> as the initial <b>cut</b> in the windpipe it is <b>like</b> a case where <b>another matter caused</b> the animal <b>to become unfit.</b> Therefore, cutting the gullet renders it a <i>tereifa</i> and prevents it from imparting ritual impurity.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish say this,</b> that slaughter can be effective to prevent impurity after the windpipe was severed? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish say:</b> If one <b>cut the windpipe and the lung was perforated thereafter</b> before he cut the gullet, the animal is <b>fit</b> for consumption? <b>Apparently,</b> after cutting the windpipe, the status of the lungs, whose existence is dependent upon the windpipe, <b>is like</b> that of an item <b>that is placed in a basket;</b> they are irrelevant to the determination of the animal’s status. <b>Here too,</b> when the windpipe is severed at the beginning of the slaughter the windpipe should be considered <b>like</b> an item <b>that is placed in a basket</b> in the sense that the animal is considered to have only one <i>siman</i>, the gullet, and cutting of one <i>siman</i> does not affect the animal’s status.

### Part 11
<b>Rather, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The apparent contradiction is <b>not difficult. There</b> (42a), where it is stated that an animal with a severed windpipe is a <i>tereifa</i>, the mishna presents the opinion of Rabbi Akiva <b>before retraction</b> of his opinion. <b>Here,</b> the mishna presents the opinion of Rabbi Akiva <b>after retraction</b> of his opinion. <b>And</b> even though Rabbi Akiva retracted his opinion, <b>a mishna does not move from its place.</b> Once this version of the mishna was learned in the study hall, it remained valuable, even though it is no longer current.

### Part 12
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> that was cited previously. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> If one <b>cut the windpipe and the lung was perforated thereafter</b> before he cut the gullet, the animal is <b>fit</b> for consumption. <b>Rava said: Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish states</b> this principle <b>only with regard to a lung, since the function of the lung is dependent upon the windpipe.</b> Once the windpipe is severed it is as though the lungs were removed from the animal. <b>But with regard to innards</b> that were perforated after the windpipe was cut but before the slaughter was completed, <b>no,</b> the animal becomes a <i>tereifa</i>, because the function of the innards is not dependent on the windpipe.

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Zeira objects to</b> Rava’s distinction. <b>Since</b> when <b>signs of being a <i>tereifa</i> developed</b> in the animal after the slaughter began, <b>you permitted</b> the animal and deemed the slaughter valid, <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if the perforation was <b>in</b> the <b>lung,</b> and <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if the perforation was <b>in</b> the <b>innards?</b> In either case, the animal should not be deemed a <i>tereifa</i> if the signs developed once the slaughter began.

### Part 14
<b>But Rabbi Zeira retracted</b> his objection, <b>as Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> If the <b>innards were perforated between</b> the cutting of the first <b><i>siman</i> and</b> the second <b><i>siman</i> what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Does the first <i>siman</i> join</b> together <b>with the second <i>siman</i> to purify</b> the animal <b>from</b> the impurity of <b>an unslaughtered carcass or not?</b>

### Part 15
<b>And we say: Isn’t this</b> the <b>dilemma that Ilfa raises: If a fetus extended its foreleg</b> outside the womb while the mother was being slaughtered, <b>between</b> the cutting of the first <b><i>siman</i>,</b> the windpipe, and the second <b><i>siman</i>,</b> the gullet, thereby causing the foreleg to have the status of a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
