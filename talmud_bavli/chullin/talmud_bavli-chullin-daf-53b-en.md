### Part 1
<b>each other,</b> and one need not be concerned. <b>They disagree when</b> the lion <b>is quiet and</b> the birds <b>are clucking.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Shmuel, <b>holds:</b> They are clucking because <b>it is acting upon them,</b> i.e., clawing them, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> that <b>they are doing this out of fear of</b> the predator, but it is not necessarily clawing them.

### Part 2
<b>Ameimar said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one must be concerned</b> in a case of <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether an animal was <b>clawed. Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: What</b> about <b>this</b> statement <b>of Rav</b> that one need not be concerned? Ameimar <b>said to him: I did not hear</b> that statement; <b>that is to say, I do not hold</b> in accordance with it.

### Part 3
<b>Or if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>Rav retracted</b> his statement and conceded <b>to Shmuel</b> that one must be concerned in a case of uncertainty. <b>As</b> there was <b>a certain basket of</b> birds concerning which there was <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether they had been <b>clawed</b> by a hawk that entered among them, <b>which came before Rav.</b> Rav <b>sent them before Shmuel</b> to issue a ruling, and Shmuel <b>strangled them and threw them in the river. And if it enters your mind that</b> Rav <b>did not retract</b> his statement, then <b>let him permit them</b> for consumption. Why did he send them to Shmuel?

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Rather, what</b> will you say, that Rav really did <b>retract?</b> If so, <b>let him prohibit them</b> for consumption without sending them to Shmuel. <b>Rather,</b> he sent the birds to Shmuel because <b>it was Shmuel’s place,</b> and although Rav disagreed with Shmuel, it would be improper to issue a contradictory ruling.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need Shmuel <b>to strangle</b> the birds? <b>Let him</b> simply <b>throw them into the river as is.</b> The Gemara responds: Shmuel was concerned lest <b>they fly and leave</b> the river and eventually end up in the possession of an unwitting Jew.

### Part 6
The Gemara objects: <b>But let him delay</b> killing <b>them</b> for <b>twelve months.</b> If they survive it will prove that they are not <i>tereifot</i>, and they will be permitted. The Gemara responds: Shmuel was concerned lest people <b>encounter a stumbling block,</b> as they might forget that these birds are prohibited and eat them before twelve months have passed. The Gemara asks: <b>But let him sell them to gentiles</b> so that they will not be a stumbling block. The Gemara responds: Shmuel was concerned that perhaps the gentiles <b>will come to sell them</b> back <b>to Jews.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara objects: <b>But let him strangle them and throw them into the garbage.</b> Why did Shmuel throw them into the river? The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning, we should throw them to the dogs,</b> as at least then they will come to some use. <b>Rather,</b> Shmuel threw them into the river, a public place, in order <b>to publicize the matter of the prohibition.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain duck that was in the house of Rav Ashi.</b> The duck <b>entered between the reeds,</b> and it <b>came out with its throat stained with blood. Rav Ashi said: Do we not say:</b> If it is <b>uncertain</b> whether the predator was <b>a dog</b> and <b>uncertain</b> whether it was <b>a cat, I will say</b> that it was <b>a dog,</b> which cannot claw an animal effectively? <b>Here, too,</b> since it is <b>uncertain</b> whether the duck was injured by <b>a reed</b> and <b>uncertain</b> whether it was injured by <b>a cat, I will say</b> that <b>a reed struck it,</b> and the duck is not a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 9
§ <b>The sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> Yehuda and Ḥizkiyya, <b>said: A clawed</b> animal, about <b>which</b> the Sages <b>said</b> one must be concerned, <b>requires inspection</b> of the flesh <b>adjacent to the intestines.</b> If the flesh surrounding the intestines reddened, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, because the venom will eventually penetrate the body cavity and perforate the intestines themselves.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Yosef said: This</b> statement <b>of the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> was <b>already explained</b> by <b>Shmuel, as Shmuel says in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus: A clawed animal,</b> about <b>which they said</b> one must be concerned, <b>requires inspection adjacent to the intestines.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Ilfa raises a dilemma: Is there clawing with regard to the <i>simanim</i>, or is there no clawing with regard to the <i>simanim</i>?</b> Does the venom penetrate the <i>simanim</i> as it does the intestines? <b>Rabbi Zeira said: This dilemma that Ilfa raises</b> was <b>already explained</b> by <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava, as Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says</b> that <b>Rav says: A clawed animal,</b> about <b>which they said</b> one must be concerned, <b>requires inspection</b> of the flesh <b>adjacent to the entire</b> body <b>cavity, and even in</b> the area of <b>the <i>simanim</i>.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Ilfa raises</b> another <b>dilemma:</b> With regard to <b><i>simanim</i> that were detached, how much</b> detachment renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>Rabbi Zeira said: This dilemma that Ilfa raises</b> was <b>already explained</b> by <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana, as Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b><i>simanim</i> that were detached,</b> if they were detached <b>in their majority</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ami raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an animal that was clawed in an area not surrounding the body cavity, such as the legs, and <b>rot</b> was found in the flesh of that area? <b>Rabbi Zeira said: This dilemma that Rav Ami raises</b> was <b>already explained</b> by <b>Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: With regard to a clawed</b> animal, the injury does not render it a <i>tereifa</i> <b>unless the flesh adjacent to the intestine reddens;</b> but if <b>the flesh rotted, one views</b> the rotten area <b>as if it does not exist.</b> If the animal would be a <i>tereifa</i> when missing this flesh, it is also a <i>tereifa</i> if the flesh rotted.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>What is considered rotten</b> flesh? <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> It is <b>any</b> flesh in such a state that <b>the doctor scrapes it off and leaves</b> the animal <b>with</b> its <b>raw flesh</b> exposed so that it will heal. <b>Rav Ashi said: When we were in the study hall of Rav Kahana they brought before us a certain lung that, when they would set it down, would sit well, but when they would pick it up it would disintegrate and fall into pieces. And we deemed it a <i>tereifa</i> based on</b> the statement <b>of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> that one views rotten flesh as if it does not exist. Since the animal would be a <i>tereifa</i> if missing the lung (see 42a), it is also a <i>tereifa</i> if the lung is rotten.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> If an animal was pierced <b>by a thorn,</b> it is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>until it is perforated to the cavity</b> of the body. But <b>in</b> the case of <b>a clawed</b> animal, <b>once the flesh adjacent to</b> the <b>intestines reddens,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rav Zevid</b> would <b>teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> in <b>this</b> manner: <b>In</b> the case of <b>a clawed</b> animal, <b>once the flesh adjacent to</b> the <b>intestines reddens</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i>; but if it was clawed <b>in the <i>simanim</i>,</b> it is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>unless the <i>simanim</i> themselves redden.</b> If only the flesh around them reddens, the animal is kosher, since the venom may not penetrate to the <i>simanim</i> themselves.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Pappi said: Rav Beivai bar Abaye raises a dilemma:</b>
