### Part 1
When Shmuel says that the animal is certainly a <i>tereifa</i> if the spinal cord is cut anywhere <b>until</b> the first gap, does he mean <b>until and including</b> the first gap, in which case if it is cut within the first gap the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>Or perhaps</b> he means <b>until and not including</b> the length of the gap itself?

### Part 2
<b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma: If you say</b> that Shmuel means <b>until and not including</b> the length of the first gap, and if the spinal cord is cut in the first gap the <i>halakha</i> is unknown, then if the spinal cord was cut in <b>the mouth of</b> the first <b>branch,</b> exactly where it branches off, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered to be within the first gap, in which case the <i>halakha</i> is unknown? Or is it considered before the gap, in which case a tear in the mouth renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>?

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma: If you say</b> that Shmuel means <b>until and including the measure</b> of the first gap, and if the spinal cord is cut in the first gap the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, then if the first <b>branch itself,</b> i.e., the first pair of branching nerves, was cut from the spinal cord, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The branch</b> of the spine that was cut <b>shall be considered as</b> normal <b>flesh,</b> not as the spine. Therefore, it does not render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, unlike the spinal cord itself. <b>What, is it not</b> referring even to the <b>first or second branch?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring only to the <b>third</b> branch. But if either of the first two pairs of nerves that branch off from the spinal cord are cut, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 5
<b>With regard to a bird,</b> the Sages disagreed as to the lower boundary of the spinal cord, above which if it is cut, the bird will be rendered a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> The spinal cord extends until <b>below the</b> level of the <b>wings. And Reish Lakish says: Until</b> the point <b>between the wings,</b> not below them.

### Part 6
<b>Ulla says: I was standing before</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>ben Pazi, and they brought before him a bird</b> whose spine had been injured, <b>and he checked until</b> the point <b>between the wings. And</b> at that point a messenger <b>of the house of the <i>Nasi</i> sent for him, and he got up and went, and I do not know if</b> he left <b>because one does not need to check beyond</b> that point, <b>or</b> if <b>due to the honor of the <i>Nasi</i></b> he left without completing the inspection.

### Part 7
§ The mishna states: If <b>the liver was removed</b> and nothing remained of it, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara asks: It follows, <b>therefore,</b> that if <b>anything remained of it,</b> the animal is <b>kosher, even if</b> the remaining piece <b>does not constitute an olive-bulk. But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna on 54a: If <b>the liver was removed and an olive-bulk of it remained,</b> it is <b>kosher?</b> One can infer that if less remained, it is a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> while <b>that</b> mishna later in the chapter is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. This is <b>like that</b> incident in which an amount smaller than an olive-bulk remained of the liver, and <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya discarded it,</b> as he holds that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>but Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>dipped it</b> in a seasoning and ate it. <b>And your mnemonic</b> to remember which Sage maintained which opinion is: <b>The rich are stingy.</b> Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, was wealthy, but he nevertheless did not allow the meat to go to waste.

### Part 9
The Gemara relates that <b>a certain</b> royal <b>army came to Pumbedita,</b> and <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef fled</b> the city, whereupon <b>Rabbi Zeira met them.</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to them: Refugees,</b> hear this <i>halakha</i>: The <b>olive-bulk that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> must remain of the liver so the animal will remain kosher must be <b>in the place</b> where the liver connects to the <b>gallbladder. Rav Adda bar Ahava says:</b> The olive-bulk must be <b>in the place that</b> the liver <b>lives,</b> i.e., is connected to the other organs, under the right kidney. <b>Rav Pappa said: Therefore,</b> in order to satisfy both opinions, <b>we require an olive-bulk in the place of the gallbladder, and we</b> also <b>require an olive-bulk in the place that it lives.</b> Otherwise, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If the olive-bulk that remained was not all in one piece, but rather small pieces that could be <b>gathered</b> together to form the requisite measure, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Alternatively, if it was long and thin <b>like a strip, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> If the <b>olive-bulk</b> was <b>flat,</b> broad but thinner than an olive, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? To all these questions the Gemara responds: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Zerika asked Rabbi Ami:</b> If the <b>liver was detached</b> from the other organs in numerous places <b>and</b> was <b>attached</b> only <b>to its membranes [<i>betarpasheha</i>],</b> but the liver itself remained intact, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Ami <b>said to him:</b> With regard to the <i>halakha</i>, <b>I do not know what</b> the significance is of <b>this detachment</b> that you mentioned. <b>If</b> you rule <b>according to the one who says</b> that an olive-bulk must remain <b>in the place of the gallbladder, that is</b> the case here. And <b>if</b> you rule <b>according to the one who says</b> that it must be <b>in the place that it lives, that is</b> the case here as well. Consequently, there is no doubt that the animal is kosher.

### Part 12
§ The mishna states: <b>The lung that was perforated</b> renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara quotes <b>Rav and Shmuel and Rav Asi, who</b> all <b>say:</b> The mishna is referring specifically to the <b>outer membrane. And some say</b> that they said that the mishna is referring specifically to the <b>inner membrane. Rav Yosef bar Minyumi said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said: And your mnemonic</b> should be: The <b>red robe in which the lung rests.</b> The inner membrane is red, while the outer membrane is white, and according to Rav Naḥman, the mishna is referring to the inner membrane.

### Part 13
The Gemara comments: It is <b>obvious</b> that <b>if the outer</b> membrane <b>is perforated but the inner</b> membrane <b>is not perforated, the inner</b> membrane <b>protects</b> the lung, and the animal is kosher. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabba, as Rabba says: This</b> animal with <b>a lung whose</b> outer membrane <b>was removed,</b>
