### Part 1
Parts of a corpse that impart impurity include an olive-bulk of flesh, a complete limb, the majority of a corpse’s bones, and the majority of the essential bones of its skeleton, namely, its legs, spine, and ribs. All of these impart impurity via contact, carrying, and in a tent. There are also <b>three</b> sources of <b>impurity</b> that <b>derive from a corpse, each one</b> of which imparts impurity in <b>two</b> ways <b>but</b> does <b>not</b> impart impurity in a <b>third</b> way. <b>And they are the following: A full ladle of dust</b> from a corpse, <b>and a bone</b> the size of <b>a barley grain, and a grave cover [<i>golel</i>] and a grave wall [<i>dofek</i>]</b> upon which the cover rests.

### Part 2
<b>A full ladle of dust imparts impurity via carrying and in a tent, but it does not impart impurity via contact,</b> as it is impossible for one to touch all of the particles of dust simultaneously. <b>And where</b> among these sources of impurity is the imparting of impurity via <b>contact</b> applicable? It is applicable <b>with one of those</b> other two sources of impurity, i.e., a bone the size of a barley grain and the cover or wall of a grave.

### Part 3
<b>A bone</b> the size of <b>a barley grain imparts impurity via carrying and contact, but it does not impart impurity in a tent.</b> This <i>halakha</i> was transmitted to Moses from Sinai. <b>And where</b> among these sources of impurity is impurity imparted in <b>a tent?</b> It is <b>with one of those</b> other two sources of impurity.

### Part 4
<b>A grave cover and a grave wall impart impurity via contact and in a tent, but they do not impart impurity via carrying.</b> This <i>halakha</i> too was transmitted to Moses from Sinai. <b>And where</b> among these sources of impurity is impurity transmitted via <b>carrying?</b> It is <b>with one of those</b> other two sources of impurity. It may be inferred from Rabbi Shimon’s statement that a full ladle of dust imparts impurity in a tent but not via contact that he disagrees with Rabbi Yosei and holds that overlying is not the same category as touching.

### Part 5
§The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the thigh bone of an unslaughtered carcass and the thigh bone of a creeping animal,</b> one who touches them when they are sealed remains ritually pure, because the bone itself does not impart impurity. With regard to this topic, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “One who touches the carcass thereof shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The word <b>“carcass”</b> indicates that one who touches the carcass is impure, <b>but</b> one who touches <b>a sealed thigh bone is not.</b>

### Part 6
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> one who touches <b>a perforated</b> thigh bone remains pure. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “One who touches</b> the carcass thereof [<i>benivlatah</i>] <b>shall be impure,”</b> indicating that one who touches a part of the animal through <b>which it is possible to touch</b> the flesh, which has the halakhic status of an unslaughtered carcass [<i>neveila</i>], is <b>impure, but</b> one who touches a part of the animal through <b>which it is impossible to touch</b> the flesh remains <b>pure.</b> Therefore, one who touches a protective layer such as the outside of a sealed thigh bone does not become impure, as it is impossible to touch the marrow.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to Abaye: If that is so,</b> that one who touches the protective layer of a carcass via which it is impossible to touch the flesh of the carcass itself does not become impure, <b>an animal</b> still <b>in its hide should not impart impurity,</b> as one can touch the hide, which constitutes a protective layer, but not the flesh. Abaye answered: <b>Go out</b> and <b>see how many orifices there are in</b> the body of an animal via which one can touch the flesh, e.g., the eyes, the nostrils, and the mouth.

### Part 8
Similarly, <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: If that is so,</b> that one who touches the protective layer of a carcass via which it is impossible to touch the flesh of the carcass itself does not become impure, <b>the kidney</b> of a carcass that is completely covered <b>in its fat should not impart impurity</b> via contact. Rava answered: <b>Come</b> and <b>see how many sinews emerge from</b> the kidney that one is able to touch.

### Part 9
§The mishna taught that the <i>halakha</i> distinguishes between a sealed and a perforated thigh bone of a carcass or a creeping animal. With regard to this topic, <b>Rav Oshaya raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>one intended to perforate</b> the thigh bone <b>but did not</b> yet <b>perforate it?</b> This is the dilemma: Is a thigh bone <b>lacking perforation considered to be lacking</b> the necessary <b>action</b> for it to impart impurity, and it therefore retains its status as a sealed thigh bone, <b>or not?</b>

### Part 10
Rabbi Oshaya <b>then resolves</b> the dilemma: A thigh bone <b>lacking perforation is not considered to be lacking</b> the necessary <b>action</b> for it to impart impurity. If one intends to perforate it, it imparts impurity immediately.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The egg of a creeping animal in which tissue</b> of an embryo <b>developed</b> and one who comes into contact with the egg are <b>ritually pure,</b> as the impure creeping animal is hermetically sealed. But if <b>one perforated</b> the egg with a hole of <b>any size,</b> one who comes in contact with the egg is <b>ritually impure.</b> In the case of <b>a mouse that</b> grows from the ground and <b>is half-flesh half-earth, one who touches the</b> half that is <b>flesh is impure;</b> one who touches <b>the</b> half that is <b>earth is pure. Rabbi Yehuda says: Even one who touches the</b> half that is <b>earth where it is adjacent to the flesh is ritually impure.</b>

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that in the case of an egg of a creeping animal in which tissue of an embryo developed, if it is perforated then one who touches it is ritually impure. With regard to this matter <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “These are the impure ones to you among all that creep; whoever touches them when they are dead shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:31). The term <b>“the impure ones”</b> is interpreted as <b>including the egg of a creeping animal and the thigh bone of a creeping animal</b> in the category of sources of impurity.

### Part 13
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> an egg <b>in which tissue</b> of an embryo <b>has not developed</b> imparts impurity. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “That creep,”</b> indicating that <b>just as a creeping animal has developed tissue, so too</b> only <b>the egg of a creeping animal in which tissue</b> of an embryo <b>has developed</b> imparts impurity.

### Part 14
One <b>might</b> have thought that in the case of an egg in which tissue of an embryo has developed, it imparts impurity <b>even</b> if it <b>was not perforated.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Whoever touches</b> them when they are dead <b>shall be impure,”</b> indicating that <b>when it is possible to touch</b> the flesh, contact renders one <b>impure; but when it is impossible to touch</b> the flesh, one remains <b>pure.</b>

### Part 15
<b>And how</b> large must <b>its perforation</b> be to render one touching the egg or thigh bone impure? Its width must be the size of <b>a strand of hair, as it is possible</b> for one <b>to touch</b> the inside of an egg or thigh bone <b>with a strand of</b> his <b>hair.</b>

### Part 16
§The mishna teaches: In the case of <b>a mouse that</b> grows from the ground and <b>is half-</b>flesh half-earth, one who touches the half that is flesh is impure. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says</b> in this regard: One becomes impure in such a case <b>only</b> if the flesh of the mouse has <b>developed along the entire</b> length of the mouse, from head to foot. <b>Some teach</b> the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even one who touches</b> the half that is <b>earth where it is adjacent to the flesh is ritually impure. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> One becomes impure in such a case <b>only</b> if the flesh of the mouse has <b>developed along the entire</b> length of the mouse.

### Part 17
<b>The one who teaches</b> the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>with regard to the first clause</b> of the mishna, <b>all the more so</b> he teaches this same <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna. <b>But the one who teaches</b> the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna holds that it applies only to that clause, with regard to one who touches the half that is earth where it is adjacent to the flesh according to Rabbi Yehuda. <b>But</b> according to the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>, stated in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, <b>even if</b> the flesh of the mouse <b>has not developed</b> along the entire length of the mouse, one who touches the half of the mouse that is flesh is impure.

### Part 18
§<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the following verse: “And these are they which are impure to you among the creeping animals that creep upon the earth: The weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kinds” (Leviticus 11:29). <b>Since “mouse” is stated</b> among the creeping animals that impart impurity, <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that <b>even a sea mouse,</b> i.e., a sea creature that has an appearance similar to a mouse, imparts impurity <b>because its name is</b> also <b>mouse. But</b> ostensibly, the opposite conclusion could be derived through <b>logical inference:</b> The verse <b>deems a weasel impure and deems a mouse impure.</b> Therefore, <b>just as a weasel is a species that grows on land, so too</b> the <b>mouse</b> to which the verse is referring is <b>a species that grows on land;</b> a sea mouse does not impart impurity.

### Part 19
<b>Or,</b> perhaps <b>go this way:</b> The verse <b>deems a weasel impure and deems a mouse impure;</b> accordingly, <b>just as “weasel”</b> is referring to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose name is weasel, so too, “mouse”</b> is referring to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose name is mouse, even a sea mouse, as its name is</b> also <b>mouse.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Upon the earth,”</b> indicating that a land mouse imparts impurity, but a sea mouse does not.

### Part 20
<b>If</b> this <i>halakha</i> is derived only from the phrase <b>“upon the earth,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the verse means that any mouse, whether a land mouse or a sea mouse, <b>imparts impurity</b> when it is <b>upon the earth,</b> but if <b>it descended to the sea it does not impart impurity.</b>
