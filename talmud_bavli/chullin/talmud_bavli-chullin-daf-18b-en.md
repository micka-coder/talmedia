### Part 1
With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> from <b>within the rest of the rings, even though they do not encircle the entire windpipe, since they encircle the majority of the windpipe his slaughter is valid.</b> The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And</b> in a case where the knife <b>is diverted</b> from the place of slaughter above the ring, the slaughter is <b>not valid. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus testified about</b> a case where the knife <b>is diverted</b> from the area of slaughter above the ring <b>that</b> in such a case the slaughter is <b>valid.</b> Contrary to that which Rav and Shmuel said with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, he holds that slaughter from within the other rings is valid.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yosef said: Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda is saying two</b> statements; <b>Rav and Shmuel hold in accordance with his</b> opinion <b>with regard to one</b> matter, that if one cuts a majority of the windpipe within the large ring the slaughter is valid, <b>and disagree with him with regard to one</b> matter, as in their opinion if one cuts the windpipe within the other rings, the slaughter is not valid.

### Part 3
The Gemara objects: <b>But didn’t</b> Rav and Shmuel <b>say:</b> And even Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>said</b> his statement <b>only</b> with regard to the large upper ring and not with regard to the other rings, indicating that in their opinion, this is the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda? The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what Rav and Shmuel are <b>saying:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>with regard to</b> cutting the majority of the windpipe within <b>the large ring, and</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with his</b> opinion <b>with regard to</b> the <b>other rings</b> that since they encircle a majority of the windpipe, one may slaughter within them as well.

### Part 4
<b>When Rabbi Zeira ascended</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he ate</b> meat from an animal during whose slaughter the knife was <b>diverted</b> from the place of slaughter, with regard to <b>which Rav and Shmuel</b> ruled that the slaughter is not valid, and in Eretz Yisrael the ruling was that the slaughter is valid. The Torah scholars in Eretz Yisrael <b>said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: <b>Aren’t you from</b> Babylonia, <b>the place where Rav and Shmuel</b> are the halakhic authorities? You should follow their ruling. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to them: Who said</b> this <i>halakha</i> citing Rav and Shmuel? It was <b>Yosef bar Ḥiyya,</b> referring to Rav Yosef. <b>Yosef bar Ḥiyya learns from everyone,</b> even from students of Rav and Shmuel who misquote their statements.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yosef heard</b> the comment of Rabbi Zeira and <b>was angry. He said:</b> Do <b>I learn from everyone? I learn from Rav Yehuda,</b> who is so meticulous in citing the statements of Rav and Shmuel <b>that he cites even uncertainties</b> with regard to attribution of statements <b>to the men</b> who said them. <b>As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says,</b> and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it is <b>in the name of Rav</b> and <b>uncertain</b> whether it is <b>in the name of Shmuel:</b> A tribunal of <b>three permits</b> slaughter of a blemished <b>firstborn</b> animal outside of the Temple <b>in a place where there is no expert</b> Sage to consult.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Zeira not accept</b> the principle that when a person travels from place to place, the Sages <b>impose upon him the stringencies of the place from which he emerged and the stringencies of the place to which he went?</b>

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said: That statement</b> applies when one travels <b>from</b> one place in <b>Babylonia to</b> another place in <b>Babylonia, or from</b> one place in <b>Eretz Yisrael to</b> another place in <b>Eretz Yisrael,</b> or <b>alternatively,</b> when one descends <b>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia. But</b> when one ascends <b>from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael,</b> this principle does not apply. <b>Since we,</b> the residents of Babylonia, <b>are subordinate to them</b> in terms of <i>halakha</i>, <b>we act in accordance with their</b> custom.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Ashi said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that when one travels <b>from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael,</b> he is required to act stringently in accordance with the custom of the place from which he emerged, <b>that statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where his intent is to return. Rabbi Zeira was not</b> one <b>whose intent was to return.</b> Therefore, he was not obligated to observe the Babylonian stringencies.

### Part 9
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: But didn’t the Sages who came from Meḥoza say</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira says in the name of Rav Naḥman:</b> In a case where the knife <b>is diverted</b> from the place of slaughter above the ring, the slaughter is <b>valid?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Each river and its</b> unique <b>course,</b> i.e., each place follows its custom, and in Meḥoza the custom was not in accordance with the opinion of Rav and Shmuel.

### Part 10
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish deemed</b> the slaughter <b>valid</b> in a case where one cut the windpipe <b>at the tip of the thyroid cartilage</b> that is above the large ring. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan proclaimed about</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: He <b>greatly exaggerated</b> the limits of valid slaughter. <b>Rav Pappi said in the name of Rava:</b> If one cut the windpipe and <b>encountered the arytenoid cartilage</b> that is adjacent to the upper ring in the direction of the jaw and covered by the tip of the thyroid cartilage, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> i.e., forbidden. Since the arytenoid cartilage is outside the area of slaughter, the slaughter is invalid.

### Part 11
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does encountered mean <b>encountered and touched it, as it is written: “And he encountered him and he died”</b> (I Kings 2:25); <b>or perhaps</b> it means <b>encountered but did not touch, like that which is written: “And the angels of God encountered him”</b> (Genesis 32:2)?

### Part 12
<b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rav Pappa said in the name of Rava:</b> If <b>one left</b> part <b>of the arytenoid cartilage,</b> i.e., if he cut it in the middle, the slaughter is <b>valid. Rav Ameimar bar Mar Yenuka said: I was standing before Rabbi Ḥiyya, son of Rav Avya, and he said to me:</b> If <b>one left</b> part <b>of the arytenoid cartilage,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid. Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Rav Shemen of Suvara said to me</b> that <b>Mar Zutra happened</b> to come <b>to our place and taught:</b> If <b>one left</b> part <b>of the arytenoid cartilage,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid. Mar bar Rav Ashi said:</b> If <b>one encountered the arytenoid cartilage,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid.</b> If <b>one left</b> part <b>of the arytenoid cartilage,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
