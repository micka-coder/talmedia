### Part 1
<b>and vessels</b> are <b>similar to a person: Just as</b> for <b>a person, we require</b> his <b>intent</b> for purification, <b>so too</b> for <b>vessels,</b> they are purified only in a case <b>where a person intends for them</b> to be purified.

### Part 2
<b>And if you would say:</b> If the mishna is referring <b>to</b> the case of one who <b>sits and waits</b> to determine when the wave will be detached, <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i>? It is obvious and introduces no novel element.

### Part 3
The Gemara responds that there is a novel element in this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Lest you say: Let us issue a decree</b> that a detached wave does not effect purification <b>due to</b> the concern that otherwise, one would receive the mistaken impression that one is purified in <b>a cascade [<i>ḥardalit</i>] of rainwater</b> containing forty <i>se’a</i>. The <i>halakha</i> is that rainwater purifies only when pooled in one place. <b>Alternatively, let us issue a decree</b> that <b>the edges</b> of the waves, which are in contact with the ground, are ineffective in purifying people and vessels standing on the ground <b>due to</b> the concern that otherwise one would receive the mistaken impression that vessels are purified even if one pushes them upward into the <b>arc</b> of the waves while the water remains airborne. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us that we do not issue</b> either of those <b>decrees.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And from where do you say that we do not immerse in the arcs</b> of waves? <b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may immerse in the edges</b> of waves, <b>but one may not immerse in</b> their <b>arcs, as one may not immerse in air.</b> Immersion may be performed only on the ground.

### Part 5
The Gemara again asks: <b>But in any event, from where do we</b> derive <b>that non-sacred</b> items <b>do not require intent?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 4:7): Produce becomes susceptible to ritual impurity only if it is dampened by one of seven liquids and its owner was amenable to its dampening. This is derived from the verse: “But when water is placed on the seed, and some of their carcass shall fall on it, it is impure to you” (Leviticus 11:38). If <b>produce fell into a stream, and one whose hands were ritually impure extended</b> his hands <b>and took</b> the produce from the water channel, <b>his hands are ritually pure</b> through immersion in the stream, <b>and</b> this <b>produce is not in</b> the category of: “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed.”</b> The produce is not susceptible to ritual impurity because the owner did not intend that his hands become wet.

### Part 6
<b>But if</b> he placed his hands into the stream <b>so that</b> his hands <b>would be rinsed</b> and purified, <b>his hands are ritually pure, and the produce is in</b> the category of: “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed.”</b> Since he was amenable to the dampening of his hands, the water on his hands renders the produce susceptible to ritual impurity. From the first case in the mishna it is clear that his hands are purified even though his intent was not to immerse them in the water.

### Part 7
<b>Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from a mishna (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 18b): If <b>one immersed for</b> the purpose of eating <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>and assumed the presumptive status</b> of ritual purity <b>for non-sacred</b> food, it <b>is prohibited</b> for him to partake of second-<b>tithe</b> produce. The Gemara infers: If <b>one assumed the presumptive status</b> of ritual purity with regard to non-sacred food, <b>yes,</b> it is permitted for him to eat non-sacred food; <b>if he did not assume the presumptive status,</b> he may <b>not</b> eat non-sacred food. This indicates that even when immersing in order to partake of non-sacred food, one must intend to assume the presumptive status of ritual purity.

### Part 8
Rav Naḥman rejects the proof from the mishna and says that no intent is required to assume the presumptive status of ritual purity in order to eat non-sacred food. Rather, <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: Although he assumes the presumptive status</b> of ritual purity <b>for non-sacred</b> food, it <b>is prohibited</b> for him to partake of second-<b>tithe</b> produce.

### Part 9
Rava <b>raised an objection to</b> Rav Naḥman from that same mishna: If <b>one immersed without</b> intent to <b>assume the presumptive status</b> of ritual purity, it is <b>as though he did not immerse. What, is</b> the meaning of the mishna <b>not</b> that it is <b>as though he did not immerse at all?</b>

### Part 10
Rav Naḥman rejects that proof as well. <b>No,</b> it means that if he immersed without intent it is <b>as though he did not immerse to</b> partake of second-<b>tithe</b> produce, <b>but</b> in that case, <b>he immersed for non-sacred</b> food, for which no intent is necessary. The Gemara comments: Rava <b>believed</b> that Rav Naḥman <b>was</b> merely <b>putting him off</b> with his claim that the formulation of the mishna does not conclusively support his objection; he believed that Rav Naḥman was not stating the real meaning of the mishna. Rava then <b>went out, examined</b> the sources, <b>and discovered that it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> explicitly in accordance with the opinion of Rav Naḥman: If one <b>immersed and</b> had <b>no</b> intent to <b>assume the presumptive status</b> of ritual purity, it <b>is permitted</b> for him <b>to</b> eat <b>non-sacred</b> food, <b>but</b> it <b>is prohibited</b> for him <b>to</b> partake of second-<b>tithe</b> produce.

### Part 11
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Let us say that</b> there <b>will be a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan from this</b> <i>baraita</i>. This <i>baraita</i> states that immersion without intent is effective for non-sacred items, while Rabbi Yoḥanan said (31a) that if a woman who is impure due to menstruation immerses without intent she is forbidden to her husband, who is non-sacred.

### Part 12
Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> Indeed, the <i>baraita</i> is contrary to his opinion, but <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan is saying</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef.</b>

### Part 13
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse dealing with the purification of a leprous garment, which must be laundered, quarantined for a week, and then immersed in a ritual bath: “And the garment…that you shall wash and the leprosy departed from them, and it shall be washed a second time and shall be pure” (Leviticus 13:58). <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef says:</b> It would have been sufficient for the verse to simply state: <b>And it shall be washed</b> and shall be pure. For <b>what</b> purpose does <b>the verse state: “A second time”?</b> The Torah <b>juxtaposes the second washing,</b> the immersion, <b>with the first washing,</b> the laundering. <b>Just as the first washing is</b> performed <b>with intent,</b> as it is written: “And the priest shall command that they wash the garment that has the leprous mark, and he shall quarantine it seven days more” (Leviticus 13:54), <b>so too, the second washing,</b> the immersion in a ritual bath, must be performed <b>with intent.</b>

### Part 14
<b>If</b> so, based on the same juxtaposition, perhaps derive: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the first washing, <b>we require the intent of a priest,</b> who commands to wash the garment, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the second washing, <b>we require the intent of a priest.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 13:58), indicating that there is purity <b>in any case</b> where there is intent, even without a command from a priest. In the opinion of Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef, even the immersion of the non-sacred garment must be performed with intent. Rav Yosef states that Rabbi Yoḥanan bases his statement on Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef’s opinion.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi objects to</b> the association of the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan with the opinion of Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef: <b>Did Rabbi Yoḥanan say that</b> immersion of a non-sacred garment requires intent? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with an unattributed mishna?</b>

### Part 16
<b>And we learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>a knife fell and slaughtered</b> an animal, <b>although</b> the knife <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>in the standard manner,</b> the slaughter is <b>not valid. And we discussed it: The reason</b> the slaughter is not valid is <b>that</b> the knife <b>fell. But</b> by inference, if <b>one dropped</b> the knife the slaughter is <b>valid, and</b> that is the ruling <b>even though</b> when dropping the knife he <b>did not intend</b> to slaughter the animal. <b>And we say: Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who holds <b>that we do not require intent for slaughter? Rava said:</b> It <b>is Rabbi Natan.</b> Based on his principle that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with an unattributed mishna, Rabbi Yoḥanan should rule in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Natan cited in the unattributed mishna, and not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef.

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to slaughter, even Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef</b> concedes that intent is not necessary. He learns this <b>from the fact that the Merciful One revealed</b> that if <b>one acts unawares</b> in performing the slaughter <b>of sacrificial</b> animals, with no intent to slaughter, the offering <b>is disqualified.</b> This is derived (13a) from the verse: “You shall slaughter it to your will” (Leviticus 19:5). <b>By inference,</b> conclude that with regard to the slaughter <b>of non-sacred</b> animals <b>we do not require intent.</b>

### Part 18
While on this subject the Gemara clarifies: <b>And the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Natan and hold that slaughter of non-sacred animals requires intent would say: <b>Although we do not require intent to slaughter</b> non-sacred animals, <b>we require</b> intent <b>to cut</b> the neck of the animal. Throwing the knife down is not sufficient.

### Part 19
<b>Rava said</b> that it was <b>with this</b> contention that <b>Rabbi Natan overcame the Rabbis:</b> He said: <b>Is it written</b> with regard to the slaughter of non-sacred animals: <b>And you shall cut?</b> It <b>is written: “And you shall slaughter”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:21). The Torah does not distinguish between cutting and slaughtering; <b>if we require intent for cutting, we</b> should <b>require</b> intent <b>even for slaughtering.</b> Conversely, <b>if we do not require intent for slaughtering, we should also not require</b> intent <b>for cutting.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara revisits the matter of immersion without intent. <b>What are the circumstances of a menstruating woman who,</b> after the menstrual flow ended, <b>was compelled</b> against her will <b>and immersed</b> in a ritual bath? <b>If we say that another</b> woman <b>compelled her and immersed her</b> in a ritual bath, the immersion should be valid even according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as <b>the intent of another</b> woman <b>is full-fledged intent.</b>

### Part 21
<b>And furthermore,</b> in that case the immersion enables her to <b>partake of <i>teruma</i> as well, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 13b): In the case of a woman who is <b>a deaf-mute, or an imbecile, or blind, or who went insane,</b> and is therefore unable to examine herself reliably, <b>if</b> one of these women <b>has a competent</b> friend, that friend <b>prepares her</b> by examining her and immersing them in a ritual bath. And on that basis the incompetent woman <b>may partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b>

### Part 22
<b>Rav Pappa said: According to Rabbi Natan,</b> who does not require intent for the slaughter of non-sacred animals, immersion against her will that renders it permitted for a woman to engage in intercourse with her husband is in a case <b>where she fell from a bridge</b> into a river, with no intent at all. <b>According to the Rabbis,</b> who require intent to cut for slaughter to be valid and intent to enter the water for immersion to be valid, it is referring to a case <b>where she descended</b> into the water <b>to cool</b> herself, with no thought of purification.

### Part 23
The Gemara continues its discussion of the dispute between Rabbi Natan and the Rabbis. <b>Rava said:</b> If one <b>slaughtered</b> a red <b>heifer and</b> in the same action <b>slaughtered another animal</b> together <b>with it, everyone agrees</b> that the red heifer is <b>disqualified.</b>
