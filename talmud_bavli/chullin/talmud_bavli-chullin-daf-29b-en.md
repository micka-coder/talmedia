### Part 1
How could that possibility enter one’s mind? <b>If</b> that is <b>so,</b> the completion of that slaughter <b>is</b> a Temple <b>service</b> performed <b>by another</b> on Yom Kippur. <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The entire Yom Kippur</b> Temple <b>service is valid only</b> if performed <b>by</b> the High Priest.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>is saying:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that if the slaughter was not completed by the other priest it <b>would be not valid by rabbinic law, as it</b> might <b>enter your mind to say that there is an invalidation by rabbinic law. Therefore, we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>The majority of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>in a bird or the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>in an animal.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And since there is not even an invalidation by rabbinic law, why do I</b> need the other priest <b>to complete</b> the cutting of the <i>simanim</i>? The Gemara answers: There is a <b>mitzva to complete</b> the slaughter <i>ab initio</i> to facilitate the free flow of the blood.

### Part 3
§ <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says in the name of Levi the Elder:</b> Halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>only at</b> its <b>conclusion. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>from the beginning to the end</b> of the act.

### Part 4
<b>Rava said</b> in establishing the parameters of the dispute between Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Everyone concedes</b> in a case <b>where a gentile slaughtered,</b> i.e., cut, <b>one <i>siman</i> and a Jew</b> slaughtered <b>one <i>siman</i>, that</b> the slaughter <b>is not valid</b> even if slaughter is accomplished only at its conclusion, as <b>an action</b> rendering the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i> was performed at the hand of a gentile.</b> Since slaughter by a gentile is not valid, the gentile renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 5
<b>In</b> the case <b>of a bird burnt offering as well, where one <i>siman</i> was pinched</b> by a priest <b>below</b> the red line marking half the height of the altar, in accordance with the procedure of the sin offering, <b>and one <i>siman</i></b> was pinched <b>above</b> the red line, in accordance with the procedure of the burnt offering, the pinching is <b>not valid, as</b> the priest <b>performed an action</b> appropriate for <b>a bird sin offering below</b> the red line, disqualifying it from being sacrificed as a burnt offering.

### Part 6
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>disagree only</b> in a case <b>where</b> an individual <b>cut one <i>siman</i> outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>and one <i>siman</i> inside</b> the Temple courtyard. <b>According to the one who says:</b> Halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>from the beginning to the end</b> of the act, i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan, one who begins the slaughter outside the Temple courtyard <b>is liable</b> for slaughter of a sacrificial animal outside the courtyard. <b>According to the one who says:</b> Halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>only at</b> its <b>conclusion,</b> i.e., Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, one who does so <b>is not liable,</b> as the conclusion of the slaughter, which is the determining factor, is performed inside the Temple courtyard.

### Part 7
<b>Rabba bar Shimi said to</b> Rava: <b>The Master did not say</b> that <b>this</b> was the crux of the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish. <b>And who is</b> the Master? It is <b>Rav Yosef,</b> who says that in a case <b>where one cut one <i>siman</i> outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>and one <i>siman</i> inside</b> the Temple courtyard, all agree that the slaughter is <b>not valid</b> and the priest is liable to receive punishment, <b>because</b> he <b>performed an action</b> appropriate for <b>a bird sin offering outside</b> the Temple courtyard.

### Part 8
<b>They disagree only</b> in a case <b>where one slaughtered the minority</b> of each <b>of the <i>simanim</i> outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>and completed</b> the slaughter <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard. <b>According to the one who says:</b> Halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>from the beginning to the end</b> of the act, i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan, one who begins the slaughter outside the Temple courtyard <b>is liable</b> for slaughter of a sacrificial animal outside the courtyard. <b>According to the one who says:</b> Halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>only at</b> its <b>conclusion,</b> i.e., Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, one who does so <b>is not liable,</b> as he concludes the slaughter in an appropriate place.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Para</i> 4:4): <b>Anyone who is engaged in</b> any part of the rite of the red <b>heifer</b> continuously <b>from beginning to end transmits</b> ritual <b>impurity to</b> the <b>garments</b> that he is wearing. <b>And they disqualify</b> the red heifer for use in the rite if they perform any <b>other labor</b> while engaged in any part of the rite of the red heifer.

### Part 10
If <b>a disqualification befell</b> the heifer <b>during its slaughter,</b> with regard to all those engaged in the rite of the red heifer, <b>whether</b> they engaged in the rite <b>before</b> the heifer <b>was disqualified or after</b> the heifer <b>was disqualified,</b> the heifer <b>does not render garments</b> that they are wearing <b>impure.</b> Since its slaughter was not valid it is disqualified from being used as a red heifer and therefore does not impart impurity. If it became disqualified at the time <b>of sprinkling</b> the blood of the heifer toward the opening of the Temple, with regard to those who engaged in the rite of the red heifer <b>before it was disqualified,</b> the heifer <b>renders the garments</b> that they are wearing <b>impure.</b> By contrast, with regard to those who handled the animal <b>after it was disqualified,</b> the heifer <b>does not render</b> the <b>garments</b> that they are wearing <b>impure.</b>

### Part 11
Rabbi Zeira elaborates: <b>And if you say</b> that halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>from the beginning to the end</b> of the act, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>also distinguish</b> between disqualification at the beginning and at the end <b>of the slaughter:</b> If it <b>became disqualified during slaughter,</b> with regard to one who engaged in any part of the rite <b>before it became disqualified,</b> the heifer <b>renders garments</b> that he is wearing <b>impure,</b> and with regard to one who engaged in any part of the rite <b>after it became disqualified,</b> the heifer <b>does not render</b> the <b>garments</b> that he is wearing <b>impure.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rava said: Are you saying</b> that the discussion concerns a case where the <b>slaughter was invalidated? There it is different, because the matter was revealed retroactively,</b> i.e., it was revealed <b>that it was not</b> a valid <b>slaughter at all.</b> Since at no stage of the slaughter was it valid, the heifer does not render the garments impure at all.

### Part 13
<b>Rava said: If</b> any aspect of that mishna is <b>difficult for me</b> it is <b>this</b> that is <b>difficult for me: According to the one who says:</b> Halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>only at</b> its <b>conclusion, let</b> the mishna <b>distinguish</b> between two individuals <b>in</b> the preparation <b>of a fit</b> red <b>heifer,</b> even when the heifer was not disqualified. Let the mishna teach a case <b>where they slaughtered it with two men, as the</b> heifer <b>does not render the first man</b> who slaughters <b>impure,</b> as the slaughter did not yet begin, <b>and the</b> heifer <b>renders the latter man impure.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rav Yosef said: Are you saying</b> that the discussion concerns a case of <b>two men</b> slaughtering <b>one offering?</b> Raise difficulties <b>except for that, as we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And when you sacrifice a peace offering to the Lord, you shall sacrifice it [<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>] that you may be accepted” (Leviticus 19:5), that the term “<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>” can be divided into two terms: You shall sacrifice [<i>tizbaḥ</i>] and it [<i>hu</i>]. From the term <b>“You shall sacrifice [<i>tizbaḥ</i>],”</b> it is derived <b>that there will not be two</b> people <b>slaughtering one offering.</b> From the full term <b>“You shall offer it [<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>],”</b> it is derived <b>that one</b> person <b>may not slaughter two offerings</b> simultaneously.

### Part 15
<b>And Rav Kahana said,</b> to explain the derivation of the first <i>halakha</i> in the <i>baraita</i>: Although the term “<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>” is vocalized in the plural, leading to the conclusion that two people may slaughter an animal together, nevertheless, because the word is written without a <i>vav</i>, it emerges that the phrase <b>“You shall sacrifice it [<i>tizbaḥehu</i>],”</b> in the singular, <b>is written,</b> indicating that two individuals may not slaughter the offering.

### Part 16
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to this</b> <i>halakha</i> that <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is the statement of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b>
