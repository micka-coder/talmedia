### Part 1
<b>eventually</b> the carcass of the bird <b>will impart</b> a more <b>severe impurity</b> when it is in the throat of the person who consumes it. Therefore, it is not necessary for the carcass of a kosher bird to come in contact with liquid in order for it to be susceptible to impurity.

### Part 2
<b>Ḥizkiyya says</b> in response: The reason for the opinion of the Sages stated by Rabbi Asi is <b>since</b> the slaughterer <b>is able to chop</b> the animal into small pieces <b>and</b> thereby <b>establish</b> the volume of every piece of the animal <b>as less than an olive-bulk.</b> In such a scenario, the animal would not be susceptible to impurity. Therefore, it is not certain that the animal will eventually become impure with a more severe impurity.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira: And did Ḥizkiyya</b> actually <b>say such</b> a statement? <b>But wasn’t it stated:</b> If one <b>slaughtered</b> a non-kosher animal in a valid manner by cutting the <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i>, i.e., the windpipe and the gullet, <b>or the majority of</b> the <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i>, <b>and</b> the animal <b>is still twitching, Ḥizkiyya says: There is no</b> prohibition against eating the <b>limbs</b> from such a twitching animal. Therefore, a gentile, who is prohibited from consuming a limb from a living animal, may consume this animal. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: There is</b> a prohibition against eating the <b>limbs</b> of such an animal.

### Part 4
The Gemara explains the opinions: <b>Ḥizkiyya says</b> that <b>there is no</b> prohibition against eating the <b>limbs</b> of such an animal, as since it was slaughtered in a valid manner <b>it is</b> considered <b>dead. Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>there is</b> a prohibition against eating the <b>limbs</b> of such an animal, as since it is twitching <b>it is not</b> yet <b>dead.</b> Therefore, since Ḥizkiyya maintains that a twitching animal is considered dead, it should have the impurity of a carcass, contrary to the opinion of the Sages cited by Rabbi Asi, as well as the mishna.

### Part 5
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya in response: Ḥizkiyya maintains that such an animal has <b>left the category of a living</b> animal, <b>but has not entered the category of a dead</b> animal. Therefore, it is not prohibited for a gentile to consume such an animal, but the animal does not have the impurity of a carcass.

### Part 6
§The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> of the dispute between Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan: If one <b>slaughtered</b> a non-kosher animal by cutting the <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i>, <b>or the majority of</b> the <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i>, <b>and</b> the animal <b>is still twitching, Ḥizkiyya says: There is no</b> prohibition against eating its <b>limbs. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: There is</b> a prohibition against eating its <b>limbs. Rabbi Elazar said: Take that</b> opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan in your hand</b> and accept it, <b>as Rav Oshaya teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion.

### Part 7
<b>As Rav Oshaya teaches</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Oholot</i> 2:1): In the case of <b>a Jew who slaughtered a non-kosher animal for</b> the consumption of <b>a gentile,</b> if <b>he slaughtered</b> it by cutting <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>or the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>, <b>and</b> the animal is still <b>twitching,</b> the animal <b>imparts impurity of food; but</b> so long as it is twitching it does <b>not</b> impart <b>the impurity of</b> animal <b>carcasses.</b>

### Part 8
<b>A limb that separates from</b> this twitching animal is considered <b>like</b> a limb that <b>separates from a living</b> animal, and as such it imparts the impurity of a carcass. <b>And flesh that separates from</b> this twitching animal is considered <b>like flesh that separates from a living</b> animal, and as such it does not impart impurity. <b>And it is prohibited for the descendants of Noah</b> to consume the flesh that separates from this twitching animal, <b>and</b> this prohibition applies <b>even after its soul departs.</b> This ruling of Rav Oshaya is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan.

### Part 9
The Gemara cites the continuation of the <i>Tosefta</i>: In the case where a Jew slaughtered a non-kosher animal for a gentile’s consumption, if <b>he slaughtered</b> it by cutting only <b>one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>or the majority of one</b> <i>siman</i>, and the animal is still twitching, the animal <b>does not impart the impurity of food</b> because the slaughter was invalid. Similarly, if he did not perform a valid slaughter but rather <b>stabbed</b> the animal, the animal <b>has no impurity whatsoever</b> while it is still twitching.

### Part 10
<b>And</b> similarly, in the case of <b>a gentile who slaughtered a kosher animal for</b> the consumption of <b>a Jew, and</b> the animal <b>is</b> still <b>twitching,</b> the animal <b>imparts the impurity of food</b> because it is considered to be food, <b>but</b> so long as it is twitching it does <b>not</b> impart <b>the impurity of an animal carcass.</b>

### Part 11
<b>A limb that separates from</b> this twitching animal is considered <b>like</b> a limb that <b>separates from a living</b> animal, and as such it imparts the impurity of a carcass. <b>And flesh that separates from</b> this twitching animal is considered <b>like</b> flesh that <b>separates from a living</b> animal, and as such it does not impart the impurity of food. <b>And it is prohibited for the descendants of Noah</b> to consume the flesh that separates from this twitching animal, <b>and</b> this prohibition applies <b>even after its soul departs.</b>

### Part 12
If the gentile <b>slaughtered</b> the kosher animal by cutting only <b>one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>or the majority of one</b> <i>siman</i>, and the animal is still twitching, the animal <b>does not impart impurity of food</b> because the slaughter was not valid. Similarly, if he <b>stabbed</b> the animal rather than slaughtering it properly, <b>it has no impurity whatsoever.</b>

### Part 13
If <b>a gentile</b> partially <b>slaughtered</b> a kosher animal <b>in a place that does not render</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> i.e., unfit for consumption due to a mortal wound, e.g., he cut half of the windpipe, <b>and</b> then <b>a Jew came and completed</b> the slaughter, the animal is <b>fit</b> for consumption.

### Part 14
But if <b>a Jew slaughtered</b> the animal, <b>either in a place that renders</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> e.g., he cut the majority of the windpipe, <b>or in a place that does not render</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> e.g., he only partially cut the windpipe, <b>and</b> then <b>a gentile came and completed</b> the slaughter, <b>his slaughter is not valid.</b>

### Part 15
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>One who wishes to eat from</b> the meat of a slaughtered <b>animal before its soul departs may cut an olive-bulk of meat from the area of its slaughter,</b> the neck, <b>and salt it very well,</b> i.e., more than is normally required, <b>and rinse it very well</b> in water to remove the salt and blood, <b>and</b> then <b>wait until</b> the animal’s <b>soul departs, and</b> then <b>eat it. Both a gentile and a Jew are permitted to</b> eat <b>it</b> because the prohibition against eating a limb from a living animal is not applicable in such a case.

### Part 16
The Gemara notes: This <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Idi bar Avin, as Rav Idi bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashyan said: One who wants to be healthy should cut an olive-bulk of meat from the area of the slaughter, and salt it very well and rinse it very well, and</b> then <b>wait until</b> the animal’s <b>soul departs,</b> and then <b>both a gentile and a Jew are permitted to</b> eat <b>it.</b>

### Part 17
§It was previously taught in the <i>baraita</i> that if a Jew slaughtered a non-kosher animal for a gentile’s consumption, or a gentile slaughtered a kosher animal for a Jew’s consumption, that animal imparts impurity of food when it is twitching after the slaughter. With regard to that <i>halakha</i>, <b>Rabbi Elazar raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in such a case if <b>one interrupted</b> the slaughter or <b>pressed</b> on the knife during the slaughter? Do these acts, which normally invalidate slaughter, also invalidate this slaughter, or does the slaughter in this case not have to fulfill all of the halakhic requirements of valid slaughter in order to render the slaughtered animal as food with regard to imparting the impurity of food?

### Part 18
<b>A certain elder</b> resolved this dilemma and <b>said to him: Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows:</b> This case <b>requires a valid slaughter</b> in every detail, <b>just like</b> a Jew slaughtering <b>a kosher animal.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>To what</b> requirement does <b>valid</b> slaughter just like a kosher animal refer? <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It is referring to the requirement of <b>examining the knife</b> before the slaughter.

### Part 19
<b>Rabbi Zeira asked Rav Sheshet:</b> If a non-kosher animal slaughtered by a Jew is twitching under the same roof as a corpse, and the animal swallowed items before being slaughtered, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> those swallowed items that are inside the animal? Is the animal considered to be living and therefore <b>it should save</b> these items <b>that are swallowed inside it</b> from the impurity transmitted by the corpse to all items under the same roof? Or is the animal considered to be dead and therefore the items become impure?

### Part 20
<b>Rav Sheshet said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: Since it is established that such an animal is considered to be dead and <b>imparts impurity of food,</b> is it possible that it <b>saves</b> those items inside it from impurity? Certainly it does not. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him</b> in response: It is also established that such an animal <b>does not impart impurity of carcasses and</b> is considered to be a living animal in that regard. How is it possible that the animal <b>does not save</b> those items inside it from impurity?

### Part 21
<b>Abaye</b> resolved the dilemma and <b>said:</b> It is proper to treat this case stringently. Therefore, such an animal <b>does not save</b> the items <b>that are swallowed inside it because it imparts impurity of food. But one who engages in bestiality with</b> such an animal <b>is liable because</b> the animal <b>does not impart impurity of a carcass</b> and is considered to be living in that regard.

### Part 22
§The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>the meat residue</b> attached to the hide after flaying that was collected, if there is an olive-bulk of it in one place it imparts impurity of an animal carcass, and one who contracts impurity from it and eats consecrated foods or enters the Temple is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for it. <b>Rav Huna says</b> in explanation: This <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> applicable only when a halakhically competent person <b>collected</b> the meat residue in one place, but not if the meat residue was collected by a child or without human intervention. By collecting it in one place, the person indicates that he considers it to be food.

### Part 23
<b>And Rav Huna says:</b> In a case of <b>two</b> pieces of flesh of an animal carcass, each measuring <b>half an olive-</b>bulk, <b>that are</b> attached <b>to the hide, the hide nullifies them,</b> as the hide does not impart the impurity of a carcass. Consequently, these pieces do not impart impurity either.
