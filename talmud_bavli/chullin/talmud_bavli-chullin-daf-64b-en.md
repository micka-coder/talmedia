### Part 1
serves <b>to include chicks</b> of pigeons <b>whose eyes have not</b> yet <b>opened</b> in the prohibition against consuming swarming things. The Gemara responds: This prohibition is <b>by rabbinic</b> law, <b>and the verse</b> cited is <b>a mere support</b> for it. One who eats the embryo of a kosher bird is not liable to receive lashes.

### Part 2
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Kosher <b>eggs</b> that have been <b>boiled</b> with non-kosher eggs are <b>permitted. Unfertilized eggs</b> are permitted, and one of <b>strong constitution may eat them,</b> even if the hen has sat on them for a long period of time. If <b>a drop [<i>koret</i>] of blood is found on it,</b> one <b>discards the blood,</b> which is the first stage of an embryo’s development, <b>and eats the rest.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: And this</b> applies <b>when</b> the blood <b>is found on its knot,</b> i.e., the place in the albumen where the embryo begins to develop, since this proves that tissue has not developed elsewhere in the egg. And so <b>taught Dostai, father of Rabbi Aptoriki:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that one may eat the rest of the egg <b>only when</b> the blood <b>is found on its albumen,</b> i.e., the knot; <b>but</b> if <b>it is found on its yolk, even</b> the rest of <b>the egg is forbidden. What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>that the decay has spread through all of it. Rav Geviha from Bei Ketil said to Rav Ashi: A <i>tanna</i> taught the opposite before Abaye,</b> that one may eat the rest of the egg only when the blood is found on its yolk, <b>and it is Abaye that corrected it</b> in <b>this</b> manner.

### Part 4
§ <b>Ḥizkiyya says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the egg of a non-kosher</b> bird <b>is prohibited by Torah</b> law? <b>As it is stated: “And the daughter [<i>bat</i>] of the <i>ya’ana</i>”</b> (Leviticus 11:16). <b>But does the <i>ya’ana</i> have a daughter</b> whose forbidden status would be different from that of its mother? Both daughter and mother should be included in the same prohibition. <b>Rather, which</b> is this? <b>This is a non-kosher egg.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps this is their name,</b> i.e., the bird is called <i>bat ya’ana</i>. The Gemara responds: This <b>should not enter your mind, as it is written: “The daughter of my people has become cruel, like the <i>ye’enim</i> in the wilderness”</b> (Lamentations 4:3).

### Part 5
The Gemara persists: <b>And</b> is <i>bat ya’ana</i> <b>not</b> its name? <b>But isn’t it written: “I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a mourning like the daughters [<i>benot</i>] of the <i>ya’ana</i>”</b> (Micah 1:8)? The Gemara responds: The verse means: I will make mourning <b>like this <i>ya’ana</i> that mourns for its children.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And <i>benot ya’ana</i> shall dwell there”</b> (Isaiah 13:21)? The Gemara responds: Here too, the verse means: And they shall dwell there <b>like this <i>ya’ana</i> that dwells with its children.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “The animals of the field shall honor Me, the jackals and the <i>benot ya’ana</i>”</b> (Isaiah 43:20)? <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that the term <i>bat ya’ana</i> is referring to <b>an egg, can an egg sing a song</b> of praise to God? <b>Rather,</b> one must say: <b>The <i>ya’ana</i> is written, and the <i>bat ya’ana</i> is</b> also <b>written,</b> and both are acceptable names for this bird.

### Part 7
<b>And</b> still, the name <b>here is different</b> from those of other animals, in <b>that the scribe splits</b> it <b>into two words:</b> <i>Bat ya’ana</i>, even though it is one species. <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that the scribe splits it</b>
