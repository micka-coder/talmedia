### Part 1
<b>And how much</b> is <b>the deficiency</b> that renders <b>the altar</b> unfit? It is a deficiency that is <b>sufficient for a fingernail to be impeded on it.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How much</b> is <b>the deficiency</b> that renders <b>the altar</b> unfit? <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says:</b> One <b>handbreadth. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> One <b>olive-bulk.</b> The Gemara answers: This apparent contradiction is <b>not difficult. This</b> measure of one handbreadth or one olive-bulk is referring to a deficiency <b>in the limestone</b> coating of the altar; <b>that</b> smaller measure of a fingernail being caught is referring to a deficiency <b>in the stone</b> of the altar.

### Part 3
§ Apropos the obligation to show the knife to a Torah scholar, <b>Rav Huna says: This slaughterer who did not present [<i>sar</i>] the knife before</b> a Torah <b>scholar, we ostracize him. And Rava says: We remove him</b> from his position <b>and we proclaim about meat</b> from an animal <b>that he</b> slaughtered <b>that it is <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara notes: <b>And they do not disagree. Here,</b> where Rav Huna says that he is ostracized, it is <b>in</b> a case <b>where his knife was discovered intact,</b> and he is ostracized for treating the scholar with contempt. <b>There,</b> where Rava says that his slaughter is proclaimed <i>tereifa</i>, it is <b>in</b> a case <b>where his knife was discovered not intact,</b> as in that case the meat from all animals that he slaughtered is suspect. <b>Ravina said:</b> In a case <b>where his knife was discovered not</b> to be <b>intact, one spreads excrement on</b> the flesh so <b>that even to a gentile it</b> will <b>not be sold.</b>

### Part 5
There was <b>a certain slaughterer who did not present his knife before Rava bar Ḥinnana.</b> Rava bar Ḥinnana <b>ostracized him, and removed him</b> from his position, <b>and proclaimed about meat</b> from an animal <b>that he</b> slaughtered <b>that it is <i>tereifa</i>. Mar Zutra and Rav Ashi happened before</b> Rava bar Ḥinnana in his place of residence. Rava bar Ḥinnana <b>said to them: Let the Sages examine the matter of</b> the slaughterer, <b>as small children are dependent upon him.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ashi examined his knife and it was discovered intact, and he deemed</b> his meat <b>fit</b> for consumption. <b>Mar Zutra said to</b> Rav Ashi: <b>And shouldn’t the Master be concerned for</b> the honor of <b>the elder,</b> Rava bar Ḥinnana, who removed him from his position and you restored him? Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Mar Zutra: <b>We are carrying out his agency,</b> as he requested that we examine the matter of the slaughterer.

### Part 7
§ <b>Rabba bar Huna says: With a detached tooth and a detached fingernail, it is permitted to slaughter <i>ab initio</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (15b): <b>Except for the harvest sickle, and the saw, and the teeth, and the fingernail, because they strangle?</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara answers that the contradiction between this statement with regard to <b>a tooth and</b> that statement with regard to <b>a tooth</b> is <b>not difficult: This</b> statement of Rava bar Huna that one may slaughter with a tooth is referring to slaughter <b>with one</b> tooth. <b>That</b> mishna that prohibits slaughter with teeth is referring to slaughter <b>with two</b> teeth, as due to the gap between them they rip the <i>simanim</i>. The contradiction between the statement with regard to <b>a fingernail and</b> the statement with regard to <b>a fingernail</b> is <b>not difficult: This</b> statement of Rava bar Huna that one may slaughter with a fingernail is referring to slaughter <b>with a detached</b> fingernail. <b>That</b> mishna that prohibits slaughter with a fingernail is referring to slaughter <b>with an attached</b> fingernail, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi (15b), who invalidates slaughter performed with an item attached to the ground or a living animal.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>with a harvest sickle,</b> which is serrated with its teeth inclined considerably in one direction, <b>in a forward direction,</b> where the serrations do not tear the flesh, <b>Beit Shammai deem</b> the slaughter <b>not valid and Beit Hillel deem</b> it <b>valid. And</b> they both agree that <b>if they smoothed its serrations</b> so that they do not tear the flesh, its halakhic status <b>is like</b> that of <b>a knife</b> and one may slaughter with it.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even when Beit Hillel deemed</b> the slaughter <b>valid, they deemed</b> it <b>valid only to purify it from</b> the ritual impurity of <b>an unslaughtered carcass; but its consumption is prohibited. Rav Ashi said:</b> The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: Beit Shammai deem</b> the slaughter <b>not valid and Beit Hillel deem</b> it <b>valid, and he does not teach: Beit Shammai prohibit and Beit Hillel permit</b> its consumption. The Gemara objects: <b>But according to your reasoning, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach: Beit Shammai deem</b> the carcass <b>ritually impure and Beit Hillel deem</b> it <b>ritually pure. Rather,</b> the terms <b>deem</b> it <b>not valid and deem</b> it <b>valid and</b> the terms <b>prohibit and permit are</b> all <b>one matter,</b> and no inferences may be drawn from that phrasing.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>from within the</b> cricoid cartilage that forms a complete <b>ring</b> at the top of the windpipe <b>and left a thread breadth over the surface of</b> the ring in <b>its entirety</b> intact, as the knife did not go beyond the ring toward the head of the animal, <b>his slaughter is valid. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> It is valid even if he left <b>a thread breadth over the majority of the surface of</b> the ring.

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is <b>Rav and Shmuel who both say:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda. And even Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says</b> his statement <b>only with regard to the large</b> upper <b>ring, since it encircles the entire windpipe, but with regard to the rest of the rings,</b> which are incomplete and where a strip of flesh connects their edges, he did <b>not</b> state his <i>halakha</i>. Therefore, his slaughter is not valid, as he is required to slaughter in the space between those rings and not in the rings themselves.

### Part 13
The Gemara objects: <b>And with regard to the rest of the rings,</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, did <b>not</b> state his <i>halakha</i>; <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b>
