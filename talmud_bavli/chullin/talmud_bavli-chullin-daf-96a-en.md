<b>but we do not return</b> a lost item to one who claims to be its owner based solely <b>on visual recognition.</b> But <b>now that I have heard these statements</b> pertaining to meat or sky-blue wool that were obscured from sight and then permitted based upon visual recognition, <b>I say</b> that <b>visual recognition is preferable</b> to a distinguishing mark.

### Part 2
Furthermore, one must hold that sensory recognition is reliable even without identifying marks, <b>for if you do not say so, how is</b> it that <b>a blind</b> man <b>permitted to</b> engage in sexual intercourse with <b>his wife</b> despite the fact that he cannot identify her by means of her identifying marks? <b>And</b> similarly, <b>how are</b> any <b>men permitted to</b> engage in intercourse with <b>their wives at night,</b> when it is dark and they cannot see their wives’ identifying marks? <b>Rather,</b> one must say that they identify their wives <b>based on voice recognition. Here too,</b> in these cases of lost meat and sky-blue wool, they remain permitted <b>based on visual recognition.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Mesharshiyya, said:</b> You can <b>know</b> that visual recognition is preferable to a distinguishing mark, <b>because if two</b> witnesses <b>come</b> to court <b>and say: So-and-so, who has this distinguishing mark and that distinguishing mark, killed a person, we</b> would <b>not kill him</b> based on this testimony. <b>But if</b> the two witnesses <b>say: We have visual recognition of him,</b> and they confirm that the accused individual committed murder, <b>we kill him</b> based on their testimony.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> You can <b>know</b> that visual recognition is preferable to a distinguishing mark, <b>because if a man says to his agent: Call so-and-so, who</b> has <b>this distinguishing mark and that distinguishing mark, it is uncertain</b> whether the agent will recognize him and <b>know</b> whom to call or whether he will <b>not know him. But if he has visual recognition of</b> him, <b>when he sees him he will know</b> it is <b>him.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who removes the sciatic nerve must</b> scrape away the flesh in the area surrounding the nerve to ensure <b>that he will remove all of it. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Scraping is not required; it is sufficient to excise it from the area above the rounded protrusion <b>in order to</b> thereby <b>fulfill the mitzva of removal</b> of the sciatic nerve.

### Part 6
<b>One who eats an olive-bulk of the sciatic nerve incurs forty</b> lashes. If <b>one eats</b> an entire sciatic nerve <b>and it does not</b> constitute <b>an olive-bulk,</b> he is nevertheless <b>liable</b> to receive lashes, because a complete sciatic nerve is a complete entity. If <b>one ate an olive-bulk from this</b> sciatic nerve in the right leg, <b>and an olive-bulk from that</b> sciatic nerve in the left leg, <b>he incurs [<i>sofeg</i>] eighty</b> lashes. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He incurs only forty</b> lashes, for eating the olive-bulk from the right leg, and he is exempt for eating the olive-bulk from the left leg.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A man known as <b>bar Peyoli was standing before Shmuel and was removing</b> the sciatic nerve from the <b>leg</b> of an animal. <b>He was cutting</b> out the nerve without scraping away the surrounding flesh, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. Shmuel <b>said to him: Go down further</b> and scrape away the flesh in order to remove the entire nerve. <b>Now,</b> if I would <b>not have seen you</b> and instructed you in the process of removing the sciatic nerve, <b>you would have fed me forbidden</b> meat.

### Part 8
Bar Peyoli became <b>afraid</b> due to Shmuel’s rebuke and <b>the knife fell from his hand.</b> Shmuel <b>said to him: Do not be afraid.</b> I do not think that you are an ignoramus or a wicked person. You are removing the sciatic nerve as you were taught; the person <b>who taught you</b> must hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and this is how <b>he taught you</b> to remove the sciatic nerve. But I hold that the entire sciatic nerve must be removed, in accordance with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Sheshet said</b> in explanation of this incident: <b>That which bar Peyoli removed was</b> the section of the sciatic nerve one is required to remove <b>by Torah law according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The Gemara asks: Based upon this statement, one can derive <b>by inference that he left</b> behind the section of the sciatic nerve one is required to remove <b>by rabbinic law according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. But</b> if so, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion did the person <b>who taught him</b> how to remove the sciatic nerve <b>teach him?</b> Even according to Rabbi Yehuda he would have transgressed a rabbinic prohibition.

### Part 10
<b>Rather, Rav Sheshet said: That which bar Peyoli removed</b> was the section of the sciatic nerve that is forbidden <b>by Torah law. And that which he left</b> over is forbidden <b>by rabbinic law according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> as explained above (92b) in a <i>baraita</i>; <b>as if</b> one were to follow the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> the section that bar Peyoli left over <b>is permitted even by rabbinic law.</b>

### Part 11
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One who eats</b> an olive-bulk <b>of the sciatic nerve</b> incurs forty lashes. <b>Shmuel says: The Torah prohibits only</b> the part of the sciatic nerve <b>that is on the</b> rounded protrusion of flesh shaped like <b>a spoon</b> that is near the end of the femur. This is <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve that is <b>upon the spoon of the thigh”</b> (Genesis 32:33).

### Part 12
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> This statement of Shmuel is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one ate</b> the entire sciatic nerve and <b>it did not contain an olive-bulk, he is</b> nevertheless <b>liable</b> to be flogged. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He is not liable <b>unless it has</b> a volume of at least <b>an olive-bulk.</b>

### Part 13
Rav Pappa explains how this relates to Shmuel’s statement. <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda? They hold that the sciatic nerve <b>is a distinct entity.</b> Therefore, even if one eats less than an olive-bulk it is a significant act of eating, and one is liable.
