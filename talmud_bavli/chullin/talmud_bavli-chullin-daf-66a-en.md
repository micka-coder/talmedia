### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do the <i>tanna</i> of the study hall,</b> who taught the first <i>baraita</i> above, <b>and the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael disagree? They disagree with regard to</b> a grasshopper <b>whose head is long.</b> According to the <i>tanna</i> of the study hall it is prohibited, and according to the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael it is permitted.

### Part 2
The Gemara elaborates: <b>The <i>tanna</i> of the study hall holds</b> that the previous verse, permitting all species <b>“which have jointed legs”</b> (Leviticus 11:21), is <b>a generalization.</b> The species <b><i>arbeh</i>, <i>solam</i>, <i>ḥargol</i>,</b> and <b><i>ḥagav</i>,</b> and the phrase <b>“after its kinds,”</b> that appears after each, are <b>a detail.</b> As a rule, in any instance of <b>a generalization and a detail, the generalization includes only that which is</b> spelled out <b>in the detail.</b> Therefore, only grasshoppers <b>of the</b> same <b>species as</b> those detailed in the verse <b>are</b> kosher. Grasshoppers <b>that are not of the</b> same <b>species as</b> them are <b>not</b> kosher. <b>And</b> the phrase “after its kinds” <b>amplifies</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include grasshoppers <b>that are similar to</b> the named species <b>in two aspects,</b> i.e., that are very similar to them. Since all the named species have short heads, grasshoppers with long heads are forbidden.

### Part 3
By contrast, <b>the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael holds</b> that the phrase <b>“which have jointed legs”</b> is <b>a generalization.</b> The species <b><i>arbeh</i>, <i>solam</i>, <i>ḥargol</i>,</b> and <b><i>ḥagav</i></b> are a <b>detail.</b> And by the phrase <b>“after its kinds”</b> after each species, <b>it then generalized</b> again. In any instance of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail. And</b> the verse therefore <b>amplifies</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include <b>any</b> grasshopper <b>that is similar to</b> the named species <b>in</b> even <b>one aspect,</b> i.e., that has the four signs listed in the mishna, even if its head is long.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> how can this be considered a generalization, a detail, and a generalization? <b>The first generalization is not similar to the latter generalization.</b> In <b>the first generalization, the Merciful One states: “Which have jointed legs,”</b> indicating that you may <b>eat</b> a grasshopper <b>that has</b> jointed legs, but <b>you may not eat</b> one <b>that does not have</b> jointed legs, irrespective of any other sign. However, <b>the latter generalization:</b> “After its kinds,” indicates that no grasshopper is kosher <b>unless it shares</b> all <b>four signs</b> with the named species.

### Part 5
The Gemara responds: <b>The <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael deduces</b> from <b>generalizations and details like this case,</b> even if the generalizations are not similar to one another. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> that <b>which we also say generally, that the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael deduces</b> from <b>generalizations and details like this case,</b> is derived <b>from here.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael: <b>The Master said: If its name</b> must be <b><i>ḥagav</i>,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that any <i>ḥagav</i> is kosher, even if <b>it does not have all these</b> four <b>signs.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “After its kinds,”</b> indicating that it is not kosher <b>unless it has all these signs.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where would this be derived,</b> that a grasshopper is kosher even if <b>it does not have all these signs?</b> How could one entertain this possibility? <b><i>Arbeh</i> and <i>ḥargol</i> are written</b> beforehand, indicating that all kosher grasshoppers must share the signs they both possess.

### Part 7
The Gemara responds: <b>If <i>solam</i> had not been written</b> as well, it would be <b>as you said.</b> But <b>now that it is written: “<i>Solam</i>,” to include long-headed</b> grasshoppers even though none of the named species have long heads, <b>I will say: Let us also include any</b> grasshopper that is called <i>ḥagav</i>. Therefore, the phrase “after its kinds” <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> of the study hall, <b>that you say</b> that the <b><i>solam</i> is</b> the <b><i>rashon</i>,</b> and the <b><i>ḥargol</i> is</b> the <b><i>nippul</i>, and what is different here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael, <b>that you say:</b> The <b><i>solam</i> is</b> the <b><i>nippul</i>,</b> and the <b><i>ḥargol</i> is</b> the <b><i>rashon</i>?</b> The Gemara responds: This <b>Sage</b> refers to them <b>in accordance with</b> the custom of <b>his locale and</b> that <b>Sage</b> refers to them <b>in accordance with</b> the custom of <b>his locale.</b>

### Part 9
§ The mishna states: <b>And with regard to fish, any</b> fish <b>that has a fin and a scale</b> is kosher. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a fish <b>does not have</b> scales <b>now but will grow</b> them <b>after</b> a period of <b>time, such as the <i>sultanit</i> and <i>afyan</i></b> fish, <b>it is permitted.</b> Likewise, if <b>it has</b> scales <b>now but will shed them when it</b> is caught and <b>rises from the water, such as</b>
