### Part 1
The Gemara objects: <b>But let</b> Rava <b>say to</b> him the same ruling by instead citing the seemingly more relevant statement <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel said: A salted</b> food imparts its flavor <b>like a boiling</b> food, <b>and a marinated</b> food <b>is</b> as absorbent <b>as a cooked</b> food. Clearly, the kosher meat absorbed flavor from the meat of the <i>tereifa</i> as it would have had they been cooked together.

### Part 2
The Gemara explains: <b>Had</b> Rava based his ruling only <b>on Shmuel’s</b> statement, <b>I would say</b> in response: <b>This statement</b> applies only to the absorption of <b>the blood of</b> the meat, <b>but</b> kosher meat is <b>not</b> prohibited if it absorbs only <b>the juices and gravy of</b> the meat of the <i>tereifa</i>. Since in this case the meat is salted in a perforated vessel, the blood from each piece runs out and is not absorbed by the other, and one might think that the kosher meat remains permitted. Rava’s interpretation of the verse in Leviticus <b>teaches us</b> that the juices and gravy of the meat of the <i>tereifa</i> must also be taken into account.

### Part 3
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A kosher fish that one salted</b> together <b>with a non-kosher fish is permitted. What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where they were both salted</b> and expel juices? This indicates that the kosher fish is not prohibited by the juices of the non-kosher fish, contrary to Rava’s statement. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> this is referring to a case <b>where</b> the <b>kosher</b> fish was <b>salted and</b> the <b>non-kosher</b> fish was <b>unsalted.</b> Since an unsalted fish does not emit juices, the kosher fish does not absorb the flavor of the non-kosher fish.

### Part 4
The Gemara challenges: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches: But if</b> the <b>kosher</b> fish <b>was salted and</b> the <b>non-kosher</b> fish was <b>unsalted</b> the kosher fish remains permitted, <b>it may be inferred that</b> in <b>the first clause we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where they are both salted.</b> The Gemara responds: The latter clause <b>is explaining</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the first clause. The <i>baraita</i> should be read as follows: <b>A kosher</b> fish <b>that one salted</b> together <b>with a non-kosher fish is permitted. How so?</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>if</b> the <b>kosher</b> fish <b>was salted and</b> the <b>non-kosher</b> fish was <b>unsalted.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara notes: <b>So, too, it is reasonable</b> that this is the meaning of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>as if it enters your mind</b> that <b>the first clause</b> is referring to a case where <b>both of them are salted,</b> one can claim: <b>Now</b> that the <i>baraita</i> has stated that even if <b>both of them are salted</b> the kosher fish is <b>permitted, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that the same applies in the less problematic case where the <b>kosher</b> fish was <b>salted and</b> the <b>non-kosher</b> fish was <b>unsalted?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects this: <b>If it is due to that</b> reason, <b>there is no</b> conclusive <b>argument.</b> It is possible that the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> is indeed referring to a case where both fish are salted, and the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> nevertheless <b>taught the latter clause to shed light on the first clause,</b> so <b>that you</b> should <b>not say: The first clause</b> is referring only to a case where the <b>kosher</b> fish was <b>salted and</b> the <b>non-kosher</b> fish was <b>unsalted, but</b> if they were <b>both salted,</b> then the kosher fish is <b>prohibited.</b> To rule this out, he <b>taught the latter clause,</b> which explicitly makes reference to a case where the <b>kosher</b> fish was <b>salted and</b> the <b>non-kosher</b> fish <b>unsalted,</b> which <b>by inference</b> indicates <b>that the first clause</b> is referring to a case where they are <b>both salted, and</b> teaches that <b>even so</b> the kosher fish is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof against Rava’s ruling <b>from the latter clause of the latter clause,</b> i.e., the third clause of that <i>baraita</i>: <b>But if</b> the <b>non-kosher</b> fish <b>was salted and</b> the <b>kosher</b> fish was <b>unsalted,</b> the kosher fish is <b>prohibited.</b> One can infer from here that <b>it is</b> only if the <b>non-kosher</b> fish is <b>salted and</b> the <b>kosher</b> fish is <b>unsalted that</b> the kosher fish is <b>prohibited. But</b> if they were <b>both salted,</b> then the kosher fish is <b>permitted,</b> contrary to Rava’s ruling.

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects this: Perhaps the last section of the <i>baraita</i> uses this language only <b>since</b> it <b>teaches</b> in <b>the former clause,</b> i.e., the second clause: If the <b>kosher</b> fish was <b>salted and</b> the <b>non-kosher</b> fish <b>unsalted,</b> etc. The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>taught the last clause as well</b> using parallel language: If the <b>non-kosher</b> fish was <b>salted and</b> the <b>kosher</b> fish <b>unsalted,</b> etc. But nothing can be derived from here with regard to a case where both fish were salted.

### Part 9
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for remembering the three <i>halakhot</i> stated by Shmuel below: The manner in which blood is expelled from <b>meat;</b> salted meat <b>that is placed</b> on a vessel; an animal whose neck is broken before its soul <b>departs.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Shmuel says: Meat cannot be rid of its blood unless one salts it thoroughly and rinses it thoroughly</b> in water. <b>It was stated: Rav Huna says:</b> One must <b>salt and rinse</b> the meat in water. And it <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> One must <b>rinse</b> the meat, <b>and salt</b> it, <b>and</b> then <b>rinse</b> it again. The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> these two rulings <b>do not disagree. This</b> ruling of Rav Huna is referring to a case <b>where one</b> already <b>washed</b> the meat <b>in the slaughterhouse</b> before salting, whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where one did not wash</b> the meat <b>in the slaughterhouse.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Dimi of Neharde’a would salt</b> meat <b>with coarse salt and</b> then <b>shake</b> the salt off the meat.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya says: One does not presume</b> that there is <b>blood in the intestines,</b> and therefore they are not prohibited if they have not been salted. The Gemara comments: The Sages <b>interpreted</b> this statement as referring <b>to the rectum, the intestines, and the spiral colon.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Shmuel says: One may place salted meat only on a perforated vessel,</b> so that the expelled blood can run out. But if the vessel is not perforated then the blood will pool and be reabsorbed by the meat.

### Part 13
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Sheshet would salt</b> meat <b>one bone,</b> i.e., one piece, <b>at a time.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that he would <b>not</b> salt <b>two</b> together? Could it be <b>because</b> the blood <b>leaves this</b> piece <b>and that</b> piece <b>absorbs</b> it? If so, with regard to <b>one</b> piece <b>as well,</b> one could claim that the blood <b>leaves this side</b> of the piece <b>and that side absorbs</b> it. <b>Rather,</b> there <b>is no difference</b> between one piece and two pieces, and one may salt even several pieces together.

### Part 14
<b>Shmuel says in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya: One who breaks the neck of an animal</b> after it is slaughtered but <b>before its soul departs thereby makes the meat heavy.</b> The meat expels blood at the time of slaughter, but if one breaks the animal’s neck, excess blood is trapped inside and weighs down the meat. <b>And</b> by this action <b>he robs people,</b> as <b>he causes blood to be absorbed in the</b> animal’s <b>limbs,</b> and since he sells the meat by weight, people will pay extra to acquire the same amount of edible meat.

### Part 15
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>what</b> case <b>is he speaking?</b> Does Shmuel mean that there is only one problem with this practice, namely, that it <b>renders the meat heavy and robs people since he causes blood to be absorbed in the</b> animal’s <b>limbs?</b> If so, it may be inferred that if one wishes to keep the meat <b>for himself,</b> one may <b>well</b> do so, since he is robbing no one. <b>Or perhaps</b> Shmuel is referring to two prohibitions, first, that the blood trapped in the meat renders it prohibited for consumption, and second, that of robbery. If so, then even if one wants to keep the meat <b>for himself,</b> it is <b>also prohibited.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 16
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who places</b> the meat of <b>birds with cheese on the table</b> upon which he eats <b>does not</b> thereby <b>violate</b> a Torah <b>prohibition.</b>

### Part 17
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: Since the mishna mentions only that placing meat of birds and milk on one table does not violate a Torah prohibition, one may <b>consequently</b> infer that if one <b>eats</b> them together he does <b>violate</b> a Torah <b>prohibition.</b> If so, <b>learn from</b> the mishna that <b>meat of birds in milk</b> is prohibited <b>by Torah law,</b> contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, who maintains that it applies by rabbinic law. The Gemara responds: <b>Say</b> that the mishna should be understood as follows: <b>One who places bird meat with cheese on the table will not</b> thereby <b>come to</b> violate a Torah <b>prohibition,</b> since eating the two together is a rabbinic prohibition, as Rabbi Akiva maintains.

### Part 18
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> It is <b>prohibited to cook the meat of a kosher animal in the milk of</b> any <b>kosher animal,</b> not merely the milk of its mother, <b>and</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from that mixture is <b>prohibited.</b> It is <b>permitted to cook the meat of a kosher animal in the milk of a non-kosher animal,</b> or <b>the meat of a non-kosher animal in the milk of a kosher animal, and</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from that mixture is <b>permitted. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Cooking the meat of <b>an undomesticated animal or bird</b> in milk is <b>not</b> prohibited <b>by Torah law, as it is stated: “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Exodus 23:19, 34:26; Deuteronomy 14:21) <b>three times.</b> The repetition of the word “kid” three times <b>excludes an undomesticated animal, a bird, and a non-kosher animal.</b>

### Part 19
<b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says</b> that <b>it is stated: “You shall not eat of any animal carcass”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21), <b>and</b> in the same verse <b>it is stated: “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk.”</b> This indicates that meat of an animal <b>that</b> is subject to be <b>prohibited due to</b> the prohibition of eating <b>an unslaughtered carcass</b> is <b>prohibited</b> for one <b>to cook in milk.</b> Consequently, with regard to meat of <b>birds, which</b> is subject to be <b>prohibited due to</b> the prohibition of eating <b>an unslaughtered carcass,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that it <b>would be prohibited to cook</b> it <b>in milk.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In its mother’s milk,” excluding a bird, which has no mother’s milk.</b>

### Part 20
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Elazar said: The verse states: “And Judah sent the kid of the goats”</b> (Genesis 38:20).
