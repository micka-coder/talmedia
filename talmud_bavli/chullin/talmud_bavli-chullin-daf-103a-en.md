### Part 1
With regard to one who <b>ate a limb from a living</b> animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes, <b>and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: He is liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes.

### Part 2
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> this <b>works out well</b> because the prohibitions of eating a limb from a living animal and of eating flesh severed from a <i>tereifa</i> are derived from two different verses. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> it is <b>difficult;</b> why does he hold that the individual receives only one set of lashes?

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here</b> it is referring <b>to one animal,</b> but <b>there</b> it is referring <b>to two animals.</b> Rav Yosef clarifies: <b>In</b> a case of <b>two animals,</b> e.g., where one ate a limb from a living animal and flesh severed from a different animal that was a <i>tereifa</i>, everyone agrees that <b>he is liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes. But <b>in</b> a case where he ate from <b>one animal,</b> e.g., he ate a limb severed from a live <i>tereifa</i> animal, Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>disagree.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to</b> the case of <b>one animal, in what</b> case <b>do they disagree? Abaye said:</b> They disagree, <b>for example,</b> in a case where the animal <b>became a <i>tereifa</i> as the majority of it emerged</b> from its mother’s womb. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that <b>an animal,</b> even <b>during its life, stands to</b> be divided into <b>limbs,</b> and therefore each of its limbs is considered a separate entity; <b>and</b> here <b>the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i> and the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a limb</b> from a living animal <b>come</b> into effect <b>at the same time.</b> Consequently, both prohibitions apply.

### Part 5
<b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, <b>holds</b> that <b>during its life an animal does not stand</b> to be divided into <b>limbs.</b> Consequently, although the prohibition of eating a <i>tereifa</i> comes into effect when it is born, the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal does not take effect until the limb is actually severed from the animal, <b>and</b> at that point <b>the prohibition of a limb</b> from a living animal <b>does not come and take effect upon the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>during its life an animal does not stand</b> to be divided into <b>limbs, and they disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>the prohibition of a limb</b> from a living animal <b>comes and takes effect upon the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that <b>the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a limb</b> from a living animal, which applies to gentiles as well as to Jews, <b>comes and takes effect upon the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, <b>holds</b> that <b>the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a limb</b> from a living animal <b>does not come and take effect upon the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 7
And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>an animal,</b> even <b>during its life, stands to</b> be divided into <b>limbs, and</b> the dispute is about a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>became a <i>tereifa</i> afterward,</b> i.e., after it was born, <b>and they disagree</b> with regard to whether <b>the prohibition of a <i>tereifa</i> comes and takes effect upon the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of a limb</b> from a living animal.

### Part 8
One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that the prohibition of eating a <i>tereifa</i> <b>comes and takes effect</b> in addition to the already existing prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, <b>holds</b> that the prohibition of eating a <i>tereifa</i> <b>does not come and take effect</b> in addition to the already existing prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal.

### Part 9
<b>Rava says</b> an alternative explanation: This is referring to a case <b>where he severed a limb from</b> the animal <b>and</b> thereby <b>rendered</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that <b>during its life, an animal does not stand to</b> be divided into <b>limbs.</b> Consequently, <b>the prohibition of a limb</b> from a living animal <b>and the prohibition of a <i>tereifa</i> come</b> into effect <b>at the same time.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, <b>holds</b> that even <b>during its life, an animal stands to</b> be divided into <b>limbs,</b> and therefore the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal takes effect when the animal is born. Consequently, <b>the prohibition of a <i>tereifa</i> does not come and take effect upon the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of a limb</b> from a living animal.

### Part 11
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>ate</b> forbidden <b>fat from a living</b> animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> he is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes. <b>Rabbi Ami said to him: But let the Master say</b> that he is liable to <b>three</b> sets of lashes, <b>because I say</b> that the correct version of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is that he is liable to <b>three</b> sets of lashes. It <b>was also stated: Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>ate</b> forbidden <b>fat from a living</b> animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> he is <b>liable</b> to <b>three</b> sets of lashes.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and Rabbi Ami <b>disagree?</b> They disagree in a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>became a <i>tereifa</i> as the majority of it emerged</b> from its mother’s womb; <b>the one who said</b> that he is liable to <b>three</b> sets of lashes <b>holds</b> that even <b>during its life an animal stands to</b> be divided into <b>limbs,</b> and each of its limbs is considered as a separate entity, <b>so that the prohibition of</b> eating forbidden <b>fat, the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a limb</b> from a living animal, <b>and the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i> come</b> into effect <b>at the same time.</b>

### Part 13
<b>And the one who said</b> that he is liable to <b>two</b> sets of lashes <b>holds</b> that <b>during its life, an animal does not stand to</b> be divided into <b>limbs,</b> i.e., its limbs are not considered separate entities while the animal is alive. Consequently, <b>the prohibition of</b> eating forbidden <b>fat and the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> animal <b>apply,</b> as they came into effect at the same time, when the animal was born. By contrast, <b>the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a limb</b> from a living animal <b>does not come and take effect,</b> due to the fact that other prohibitions already apply.

### Part 14
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>during its life an animal does not stand to</b> be divided into <b>limbs,</b> and each of its limbs is not considered as a separate entity. <b>But they disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a limb</b> from a living animal <b>comes and takes effect upon the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of eating</b> forbidden <b>fat and the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ami, <b>holds</b> that it does <b>come and take effect, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, <b>holds</b> that <b>it does not come and take effect.</b>

### Part 15
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>during its life an animal stands to</b> be divided into <b>limbs, and</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>became a <i>tereifa</i> afterward,</b> i.e., after it was born; <b>and they disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i> comes and takes effect upon the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of</b> eating <b>a limb</b> from a living animal.

### Part 16
One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ami, <b>holds</b> that it does <b>come and take effect, just as is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with</b> forbidden <b>fat. As the Master said</b> that in the verse: “And the fat of a carcass, and the fat of a <i>tereifa</i> may be used for any other service; but you shall in no way eat of it” (Leviticus 7:24), <b>the Torah said: Let the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a carcass come and take effect upon the prohibition of</b> eating forbidden <b>fat,</b> despite the fact that the prohibition of forbidden fat came into effect first. <b>And</b> similarly, the word “<i>tereifa</i>” teaches: <b>Let the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i> come and take effect upon the prohibition of</b> eating forbidden <b>fat.</b> Consequently, one who eats forbidden fat from a <i>tereifa</i> is liable to receive two sets of lashes. Rabbi Ami holds that just as the prohibition of eating a <i>tereifa</i> takes effect in addition to the prohibition of eating forbidden fat, it also takes effect in addition to the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal.

### Part 17
<b>And the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, holds <b>that it is</b> only the prohibition of eating forbidden <b>fat for which he is liable</b> in addition to being liable for the prohibition of eating a <i>tereifa</i>. The prohibition of eating a <i>tereifa</i> takes effect in addition to the prohibition of eating forbidden fat <b>because</b> with regard to the latter, there are <b>permitted</b> circumstances that serve as exceptions
