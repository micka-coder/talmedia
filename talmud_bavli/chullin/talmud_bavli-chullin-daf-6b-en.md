### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>And in general,</b> in a case not involving one’s mother-in-law, <b>are we not concerned</b> about the possibility of replacement? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 3:5): <b>One who gives</b> dough or a pot of food <b>to his innkeeper [<i>pundakit</i>]</b> who is an <i>am ha’aretz</i> to bake or cook, <b>tithes what he gives her and</b> tithes <b>what he takes</b> back <b>from her, due to</b> the fact <b>that she is suspected</b> of <b>replacing</b> the ingredients? The Gemara answers: <b>There too,</b> her intentions are good, as the innkeeper <b>rationalizes</b> her deception <b>and says:</b> Let the <b>student</b> of Torah <b>eat</b> my <b>hot</b> food <b>and I will eat</b> his <b>cold</b> food.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And are we not concerned about replacement</b> of the ingredients? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The wife of a <i>ḥaver</i>,</b> one devoted to the meticulous observance of mitzvot, especially the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity, <i>teruma</i>, and tithes,<b>grinds</b> grain <b>with the wife of an <i>am ha’aretz</i> when</b> the wife of the <i>ḥaver</i> <b>is ritually impure</b> with the impurity of a menstruating woman. In that case, there is no concern that she will eat her counterpart’s untithed produce, as, since she is impure she will refrain from touching the grain so that she will not render it impure. <b>But</b> she may <b>not</b> do so <b>when she is ritually pure,</b> due to the concern that she will eat the untithed produce.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Even when she is impure,</b> the wife of the <i>ḥaver</i> <b>may not grind</b> grain together with the wife of the <i>am ha’aretz</i>, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that her counterpart gives her</b> grain <b>and she eats</b> it without touching the rest of the grain.

### Part 4
The Gemara infers: <b>Now</b> that there is suspicion that the wife of the <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>steals</b> from her husband’s grain and gives it to her counterparts, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that she is suspect with regard to <b>replacing</b> ingredients? <b>Rav Yosef said: There too</b> there are special circumstances, as the wife of the <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>rationalizes</b> her behavior <b>and says</b> metaphorically: <b>The ox eats from its threshing,</b> and believes that the wife of the <i>ḥaver</i> is entitled to some of the grain that she is grinding.

### Part 5
§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the statement that the righteous would not experience mishaps. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Zeruz, son of the father-in-law of Rabbi Meir, testified before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>about Rabbi Meir that he ate the leaf of a vegetable in Beit She’an</b> without tithing or separating <i>teruma</i>, as he holds that Beit She’an is not part of Eretz Yisrael and therefore is not sacred with its sanctity. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permitted all</b> the produce of <b>Beit She’an on</b> the basis of <b>his</b> testimony.

### Part 6
<b>His brothers and his father’s household united against him</b> and <b>said to him:</b> In <b>a place where your fathers and the fathers of your fathers treated</b> untithed produce as <b>forbidden, will you treat</b> it as <b>permitted?</b>

### Part 7
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>interpreted this verse to them: “And he broke in pieces the copper serpent that Moses had made; for until those days the children of Israel burned incense to it; and it was called Nehushtan”</b> (II Kings 18:4). Is it <b>possible</b> that they burned incense to it and <b>Asa,</b> a righteous king, <b>came and did not eradicate it,</b> and <b>Jehoshaphat,</b> a righteous king, <b>came and did not eradicate it,</b> and it remained until the time of Hezekiah? <b>But didn’t Asa and Jehoshaphat eradicate all</b> objects of <b>idol worship in the world?</b>
