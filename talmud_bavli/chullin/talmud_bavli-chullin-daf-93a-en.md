### Part 1
The <b>fat that is covered by the flesh</b> is <b>permitted. Apparently,</b> when <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that the fat <b>that is upon the loins</b> is prohibited (see Leviticus 3:4), it is referring only to the fat above the loins <b>but not</b> the fat <b>that is inside the loins. Here also, the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that the fat <b>that is upon the kidneys</b> is prohibited (see Leviticus 3:4), <b>but</b> this does <b>not</b> include the fat <b>that is inside the kidneys.</b>

### Part 2
§ The Gemara addresses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> cited in the discussion above: <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The fat that is covered by the flesh</b> is <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Abba say</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: This fat that is under the loins is forbidden,</b> even though it is covered by flesh?

### Part 3
The Gemara answers that <b>Abaye said: When an animal is alive</b> its limbs <b>separate</b> at the joints as it walks, so that the fat under the loins is not covered by flesh. Therefore, even after it has been slaughtered this fat is forbidden and does not have the status of fat that is covered by flesh. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I am not a butcher and I am not the son of a butcher,</b> i.e., I am not expert in the anatomy of animals, <b>but I remember that this is what they would say</b> in <b>the study hall: When an animal is alive</b> its limbs <b>separate</b> at the joints as it walks, so that the fat under the loins is exposed.

### Part 4
§ <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The fat that is on the omasum and the reticulum is forbidden, and</b> its consumption is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>. And this is the fat that is</b> referred to in the Torah as being <b>upon the innards</b> (see Leviticus 3:3). <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: This fat of the coccygeal</b> bone <b>is forbidden, and</b> its consumption <b>is punishable by <i>karet</i>. And this is the fat that is</b> referred to in the Torah as being <b>upon the loins</b> (see Leviticus 3:4).

### Part 5
<b>And Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The veins that are in the foreleg</b> of an animal <b>are forbidden. Rav Safra said</b> to Rabbi Abba: <b>Moses! Did the Merciful One say</b> in the Torah: <b>Do not eat meat?</b> The veins of the foreleg are part of the meat and are not forbidden. <b>Rava said: Moses! Did the Merciful One say</b> in the Torah: <b>Eat blood?</b> The reason that these veins are forbidden is that they are filled with blood. Therefore, if one <b>cuts</b> the foreleg open <b>and salts it</b> to remove the blood, it is <b>permitted even</b> to cook it <b>in a pot;</b> and it is certainly permitted to roast it over a fire, which also draws out the blood.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The fat on the <b>top cubit of the</b> small <b>intestine requires scraping,</b> i.e., it is forbidden and must be removed. <b>And this is</b> the fat referred to by the Sages (see 49b) as <b>the fat that is on the small intestine.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And Rav Yehuda says: The sinews that are in the tailbone are forbidden</b> for consumption, because they contain forbidden fat. <b>There are five sinews in the tail: Three on the right and two on the left.</b> The <b>three</b> on the right <b>each split into two,</b> and the <b>two</b> on the left <b>each split into three.</b> The practical <b>difference,</b> i.e., the reason the Gemara describes this in detail, is <b>that if</b> one <b>draws them out</b> while they are <b>still warm</b> soon after slaughter <b>they are drawn out</b> easily, <b>but if not,</b> he <b>is required to scrape around them,</b> i.e., dig into the flesh to remove them. It is important to know how many there are to ensure that one removes them all.

### Part 8
<b>Abaye said, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda</b> said: <b>There are five strands</b> that are forbidden for consumption; <b>three</b> of them are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>forbidden fat, and two</b> are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>blood.</b> The ligaments <b>of the spleen and of the tail and of the kidneys</b> are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>forbidden fat.</b> And the veins <b>of the foreleg and of the pharynx,</b> i.e., the carotid artery, are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>blood.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is</b> there whether they are forbidden due to fat or due to blood? The Gemara answers: With regard to <b>these</b> veins and arteries <b>that</b> are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>blood, if one cuts them</b> open <b>and</b> then <b>salts them</b> to remove the blood they are <b>permitted.</b> But <b>those</b> strands that contain forbidden fat <b>have no rectification</b> and can never be eaten.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Kahana said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Yehuda</b> who said: <b>There are five membranes</b> that are forbidden for consumption; <b>three</b> of them are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>forbidden fat, and two</b> are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>blood.</b> The membranes <b>of the spleen and of the tail and of the kidneys</b> are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>forbidden fat.</b> And the membranes <b>of the testicles and of the brain</b> are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>blood.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Yehuda bar Oshaya was peeling</b> the membranes from <b>a spleen for Levi, son of Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya. He was cutting them</b> only <b>from the upper</b> surface of the spleen. Levi <b>said to</b> Rav Yehuda: <b>Go down further,</b> i.e., remove the fat that is lower down as well. Levi’s <b>father,</b> Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya, <b>came and found him</b> as Levi was saying this to Rav Yehuda. Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya <b>said to him: This is what your mother’s father said in the name of Rav; and who</b> was Levi’s mother’s father? It was <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba.</b> He said: <b>The Torah prohibits only</b> the membranes <b>that are on the thick,</b> upper surface of the spleen.

### Part 12
Levi asked: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Hamnuna say</b> that it was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the <b>membrane that is on the spleen is forbidden, but one is not liable</b> to receive the punishment of <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> eating <b>it?</b> Levi clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> referred to in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring to the membranes <b>that are on the thick,</b> upper surface of the spleen, <b>why is one not liable</b> to the punishment of <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> eating <b>it? Rather,</b> it must be referring to the membranes <b>on all</b> sides <b>of</b> the spleen, even the underside. Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya <b>said to</b> his son, Levi: <b>If this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught, it is taught,</b> and I cannot take issue with it.

### Part 13
§ The Gemara returns to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> mentioned above: <b>Rav Hamnuna said</b> that it was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>membrane that is on the spleen is forbidden, but one is not liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> eating <b>it.</b> The <b>membrane that is on</b> the <b>kidney is forbidden, but one is not liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> eating <b>it.</b> The Gemara challenges this statement: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>one is liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> eating the membrane on the spleen or the kidney?

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: The apparent contradiction between the <i>baraita</i> that states that one is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for eating the membrane on the <b>spleen</b> and the <i>baraita</i> that states that one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for eating the membrane on the <b>spleen</b> is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>baraita</i> that states that one is liable is referring to the membrane <b>on the thick,</b> upper part of the spleen, whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> that states that one is not liable is referring to the membrane <b>that is not on the thick</b> part of the spleen.

### Part 15
Likewise, the apparent contradiction between the <i>baraita</i> that states that one is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for eating the membrane on the <b>kidney</b> and the <i>baraita</i> that states that one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for eating the membrane on the <b>kidney</b> is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>baraita</i> that states that one is liable is referring to the membrane <b>on the upper</b> part of the kidney, whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> that states that one is not liable is referring to the membrane <b>on the lower</b> part of the kidney.

### Part 16
§ With regard to <b>testicles</b> that were <b>crushed</b> while the animal was alive but were still attached to their cords in the scrotum, there is a dispute between <b>Rav Ami and Rav Asi. One</b> of them <b>prohibits</b> eating the testicles after the animal is slaughtered <b>and one</b> of them <b>permits</b> eating them. The Gemara clarifies: <b>The one who prohibits</b> them holds that
