<b>skewering liver on top of meat</b> for roasting. Rav Ashi <b>said: How haughty is this Sage!</b> Even if you <b>say that the Sages stated</b> that one may eat meat roasted under liver <b>after the fact, did they say</b> that one may roast them in this manner <b><i>ab initio</i>?</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara adds: <b>And if there is a receptacle</b> under the spit <b>for the drippings</b> of fat, then even if the <b>meat</b> is <b>on top of</b> the <b>liver</b> it is <b>also prohibited</b> to roast the meat, as the blood from the liver will fall into the fat in the vessel, and one might come to eat the mixture.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> roasting a piece of meat by itself over such a vessel, which is permitted? Here too the <b>blood of the meat</b> drips into the fat in the vessel. The Gemara answers: <b>Blood of</b> most <b>meat sinks</b> to the bottom of the vessel, while the fat floats on top. Since the fat can be separated from the blood, it is permitted. By contrast, the <b>blood of the liver floats</b> above the fat and cannot be removed from it, and therefore the entire mixture is prohibited.

### Part 4
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b>knife with which one slaughtered</b> an animal absorbs blood due to its heat, and it is therefore <b>prohibited to cut</b> any <b>boiling</b> food <b>with it,</b> since that food will in turn absorb the blood from the knife. If one cut <b>cold</b> food with this knife, <b>some say</b> that the piece he cut <b>requires rinsing</b> before one may eat it, <b>and some say</b> that it <b>does not require rinsing.</b>

### Part 5
§ The Gemara cites other statements of Shmuel. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>a bowl in which meat was salted</b> to remove its blood before cooking, it is <b>prohibited to eat</b> any <b>boiling</b> food placed <b>in it,</b> as that food absorbs blood of the meat from the bowl. <b>And</b> in this <b>Shmuel</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Shmuel said: A salted</b> food imparts its flavor <b>like a boiling</b> food, <b>and</b> a food item <b>marinated</b> in vinegar, brine, or the like absorbs flavor from the liquid or vessel <b>as</b> would <b>a cooked</b> food.

### Part 6
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A salted</b> food <b>is not</b> considered <b>like a boiling</b> food, <b>and a marinated</b> food <b>is not</b> considered <b>like a cooked</b> food. <b>Abaye said:</b> I can prove that <b>this</b> ruling <b>that Ravin</b> cited <b>is not</b> correct, <b>as there was a certain bowl</b> [<b><i>pinka</i></b>] <b>in Rabbi Ami’s house in which meat was salted, and</b> Rabbi Ami <b>broke it</b> so that it would no longer be used. <b>Now Rabbi Ami was a student of Rabbi Yoḥanan. What is the reason he broke</b> that bowl? Is it <b>not because he heard that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A salted</b> food <b>is</b> considered <b>like a boiling</b> food? Ravin’s citation was evidently in error.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Kahana, the brother of Rav Yehuda, sat before Rav Huna, and he sat and said:</b> With regard to <b>a bowl in which meat was salted, it is prohibited to eat</b> any <b>boiling</b> food placed <b>in it. And</b> he added: With regard to <b>a radish that one cut with a knife</b> used for cutting meat, it is <b>permitted to eat it with <i>kutaḥ</i>,</b> a food that contains milk, even though the sharpness of the radish causes it to absorb the fat of the meat from the knife.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> to distinguish between blood absorbed in a bowl and fat absorbed by the radish? <b>Abaye said: This</b> radish <b>absorbed a permitted</b> substance, as the fat on the knife is permitted for consumption by itself, <b>but that</b> bowl in which meat was salted <b>absorbed a prohibited</b> substance, i.e., blood.

### Part 9
<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: And <b>if</b> the radish <b>absorbed a permitted</b> substance, <b>what of it? Ultimately,</b> if one desires to eat the radish with <i>kutaḥ</i>, <b>it is a permitted</b> substance <b>that leads to a prohibition, as he</b> will <b>eat a prohibited</b> substance. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The distinction is that with regard to <b>this</b> radish, it is <b>possible</b> for a Jew <b>to taste it</b> before eating it with milk to see if it has acquired the flavor of meat. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that</b> bowl, it is <b>not possible</b> for a Jew <b>to taste its</b> contents to see whether they have absorbed blood.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: But let a gentile cook taste</b> the contents of the bowl to see whether they have the taste of blood. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Terumot</i> 8:12): With regard to <b>a pot in which one cooked meat, one may not cook milk in it, and if he cooked</b> milk in it, the meat absorbed in the pot renders the milk forbidden if it <b>imparts flavor</b> to the milk. Likewise, if one <b>cooked <i>teruma</i> in</b> the pot, <b>he may not cook non-sacred</b> food <b>in it, and if he cooked</b> non-sacred food in it, the non-sacred food is prohibited if there is sufficient <i>teruma</i> absorbed in the pot <b>to impart flavor</b> to the non-sacred food.

### Part 11
<b>And we said</b> with regard to this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted,</b> one can know whether the non-sacred food has acquired the flavor of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> as <b>a priest can taste it. But</b> with regard to the prohibition of <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, who can taste it? And</b> you, Rava, <b>said to us: Let</b> a gentile <b>cook taste it. So too</b> here, with regard to the food in the bowl, <b>let</b> a gentile <b>cook taste it.</b> Rava responded: <b>Indeed,</b> a gentile cook can discover whether the food in the bowl has absorbed the taste of blood. <b>When I said</b> my statement I was referring to a case <b>where there is no</b> gentile <b>cook</b> available.

### Part 12
§ <b>It was stated:</b> If <b>a fish was removed</b> from the fire and placed, still hot, <b>in a bowl</b> in which meat had been eaten, <b>Rav says: It is prohibited to eat</b> the fish <b>with</b> the milk dish <b><i>kutaḥ</i>,</b> since the fish has absorbed meat from the bowl. <b>And Shmuel says: It is permitted to eat</b> the fish <b>with <i>kutaḥ</i>.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav says</b> that it is <b>prohibited</b> to eat the fish with <i>kutaḥ</i> because this <b>is</b> a case of <b>imparted flavor,</b> i.e., from the meat to the fish. <b>And Shmuel says</b> that it is <b>permitted</b> because the flavor is first imparted to the bowl, and only then from the bowl to the fish. This <b>is</b> therefore a case of <b>imparted flavor derived from imparted flavor.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara notes: <b>And this</b> opinion <b>of Rav was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference. As Rav arrived at the house of Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya, the son of his son. He felt</b> pain <b>in his eyes, and they prepared for him an ointment in an earthenware bowl</b> as a remedy. <b>Later they placed a dish for him in</b> that same bowl. Rav <b>tasted</b> in that dish <b>the flavor of the ointment</b> and <b>said: It imparts so much flavor!</b> Those present inferred that according to Rav, imparted flavor derived from imparted flavor is strong enough itself to impart flavor. The Gemara rejects this: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so,</b> and one cannot reach any general conclusions from this story. <b>It is different there, as</b> the ointment was <b>very bitter.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Elazar was standing before Mar Shmuel,</b> and <b>they brought before</b> Shmuel <b>a fish that had been removed</b> directly from the fire and placed <b>into a bowl</b> used previously for meat, <b>and he ate</b> it together <b>with <i>kutaḥ</i>.</b> Shmuel <b>gave</b> Rabbi Elazar some of this dish, <b>but</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>did not eat</b> it, as he was a student of Rav, who prohibited such mixtures. Shmuel <b>said to him: To your teacher,</b> Rav, <b>I gave</b> this dish <b>and he ate</b> from it, <b>yet you</b> will <b>not eat?</b> Later Rabbi Elazar <b>came before Rav,</b> and <b>said to him: Did</b> the <b>Master retract this <i>halakha</i>?</b> Do you permit this? Rav <b>said to him: God forbid that the progeny of Abba bar Abba,</b> i.e., Shmuel, <b>would feed me something that I do not hold</b> to be permitted. Shmuel never fed me such a dish.

### Part 16
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna and Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi were sitting</b> down to eat. <b>One</b> of them was sitting <b>on this side of the ford of</b> the <b>Sura</b> River, <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> was sitting <b>on that side of the ford. They brought</b> one <b>Sage a fish that had been removed</b> from the fire and placed <b>into a bowl</b> previously used for meat, <b>and he ate</b> it together <b>with <i>kutaḥ</i>. They</b> also <b>brought</b> the other <b>Sage figs and grapes during the meal, and he ate</b> them <b>but did not recite</b> a separate <b>blessing</b> over them, even though these foods were usually consumed following the main portion of the meal before reciting Grace after Meals, and a separate blessing was made on them.

### Part 17
One <b>Sage said to his colleague: Orphan!</b> Student without a teacher! <b>Would your teacher do this,</b> i.e., eat such fish with <i>kutaḥ</i>? <b>And</b> the other <b>Sage said to his colleague: Orphan! Would your teacher do this,</b> i.e., eat these fruits during a meal without reciting a blessing over them? One <b>Sage said to his colleague: I hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> who permits eating such fish with <i>kutaḥ</i>. <b>And</b> the other <b>Sage said to his colleague: I hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya, as Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches:</b> The blessing over the <b>bread exempts all</b> the other <b>types of food</b> eaten during a meal, including those usually eaten separately following bread, <b>and</b> likewise the blessing over <b>wine exempts all types of drinks.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Ḥizkiyya says in the name of Abaye:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is: If <b>a fish was removed</b> from the fire and placed <b>into a bowl</b> used for meat, <b>it is permitted to eat</b> it together <b>with <i>kutaḥ</i>.</b> But with regard to <b>a radish that one cut with a knife with which he had cut meat, it is prohibited to eat</b> that radish <b>with <i>kutaḥ</i>,</b> contrary to Rav Kahana’s statement above.

### Part 19
The Gemara notes: <b>And this statement</b> applies only to <b>a radish,</b>
