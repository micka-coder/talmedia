### Part 1
so too, with regard to <b>a bird burnt offering according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that one is required to pinch merely a majority of two <i>simanim</i> in the nape of the neck in order to prepare it for sacrifice, <b>let him decree</b> against pinching the majority of two <i>simanim</i> <b>lest one come to not perform</b> the pinching on <b>the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>, but rather on merely half of them.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yosef</b> responded to Rabba’s two refutations and <b>said to him:</b> With regard to <b>that which you said,</b> that a rabbinic <b>decree</b> is necessary even with regard to a garment that was immersed that day <b>lest</b> onlookers <b>say</b> that <b>immersion</b> of a garment <b>on that</b> same <b>day is sufficient,</b> there is no reason for such a concern. This is because <b>its tear proves</b> that the garment is pure due to the tear, and not because one is allowed to wear an immersed garment while eating pure food before sunset.

### Part 3
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which you said,</b> that with regard to <b>a bird burnt offering according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, let him decree</b> against pinching the majority of the <i>simanim</i> lest one fail to pinch the majority, in fact there is no reason for such a concern. Rav Yosef explains: The reason there is no concern is that pinching is performed by <b>the priests,</b> who <b>are vigilant</b> with regard to mitzvot.

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a refutation to Rabba bar Avuh’s explanation of the mishna in tractate <i>Kelim</i> from the mishna here: In the case of <b>one who flays a domesticated animal or an undomesticated animal, a ritually impure</b> animal <b>or a ritually pure</b> animal, <b>a small</b> animal <b>or a large</b> animal, if he is flaying the animal <b>for</b> the purpose of using the hide as <b>a carpet,</b> the halakhic status of the hide remains that of flesh until he has flayed <b>the measure of grasping</b> the hide.

### Part 5
The Gemara infers: <b>But</b> after one has flayed <b>more than a measure of grasping</b> the hide, the hide is <b>pure. Why</b> is this so? <b>Let</b> the Sages <b>decree</b> that even a hide that was flayed more than the measure of grasping is susceptible to impurity <b>lest</b> one who intends to flay more than a measure of grasping <b>come to complete only a measure of grasping, and he is</b> thereby <b>touching</b> a source of <b>impurity, and we</b> might mistakenly <b>deem him pure.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the mishna were discussing <b>impurity by Torah law, indeed</b> the Sages would issue such a decree. But <b>here we are dealing with impurity by rabbinic law,</b> and therefore the Sages did not issue such a decree.

### Part 7
The Gemara objects: According to this answer, the case in the mishna of <b>an impure</b> person who flays <b>a pure</b> animal <b>works out well.</b> That could be referring to a case of impurity by rabbinic law. But in every case of <b>a pure</b> person who flays <b>an impure</b> animal, i.e., an unslaughtered animal carcass, the <b>impurity</b> of the animal <b>is by Torah law.</b> Therefore, in such a case the Sages should have issued a decree. The Gemara explains: The case taught in the mishna of a person who flays an impure animal is referring <b>to</b> a pure animal that was properly slaughtered, but after the slaughter the animal was found to have a wound that would have caused it to die within twelve months, thereby rendering it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> Such an animal imparts impurity by rabbinic law.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> a pure animal that is found to be <b>a <i>tereifa</i> capable of imparting impurity?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel’s father, as Shmuel’s father said: A <i>tereifa</i> that one slaughtered imparts impurity</b> by rabbinic law <b>if</b> it is <b>a sacrificial</b> animal. Accordingly, the mishna is referring to the case of a sacrificial animal that was found to be a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 9
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a refutation of Rabba bar Avuh’s explanation of the mishna in tractate <i>Kelim</i> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:19): <b>Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> With regard to <b>one who flays creeping animals,</b> its hide is considered to have <b>a connection</b> with the flesh, and it imparts impurity of a creeping animal <b>until he flays</b> the animal in <b>its entirety.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara infers: This <i>halakha</i> applies only with regard to creeping animals, <b>but with regard to a camel</b> or other non-kosher animals, when the hide is flayed more than a measure of grasping it <b>is not</b> considered to have <b>a connection</b> with the flesh and is pure, even though when the measure of grasping is flayed it is impure. Apparently, there is no rabbinic decree that even a hide that was flayed more than the measure of grasping imparts impurity lest one who intends to flay more than a measure of grasping come to flay only a measure of grasping, contrary to the opinion of Rabba bar Avuh.

### Part 11
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Do not say</b> that <b>this</b> statement indicates that <b>with regard to a camel,</b> when the hide is flayed more than a measure of grasping it <b>is not</b> considered to have <b>a connection</b> with the flesh. <b>Rather, say</b> that this statement indicates that only with regard to a creeping animal is the hide considered to have a connection with the flesh until one flays the animal in its entirety. But <b>with regard to</b> a camel carcass and other non-kosher animals, in a case where one seeks to fashion a jug and begins flaying from the legs, if he removed the entire hide except for <b>the hide over the neck, it is not</b> considered to have <b>a connection</b> to the flesh, <b>and</b> this statement <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri</b> stated in the mishna.

### Part 12
§The Gemara returns to discuss, and limit the scope of, the previously cited mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 28:8): In the case of a ritually impure garment that one began to tear, once the majority of the garment is torn, the two sections are no longer considered to have a connection, and the garment is pure. <b>Rav Huna says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> that an impure garment, most of which has been torn, is no longer impure <b>only when one did not leave</b> untorn a part of the garment that is <b>the measure of a scarf. But</b> if <b>he left</b> an untorn piece that is <b>the measure of a scarf, it is</b> considered to have <b>a connection,</b> and the garment remains ritually impure.

### Part 13
<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> The mishna <b>taught only</b> with regard to an impure <b>garment,</b> most of which has been torn, that it is no longer impure, <b>but</b> an impure <b>hide</b> that was torn in such a manner remains impure because it is <b>repairable. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even a hide</b> that was torn in such a manner is no longer impure because it <b>is not repairable.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> from a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 26:9): In the case of <b>a hide</b> that is <b>impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>treading,</b> if the owner <b>intended with regard to</b> the hide to make it <b>into straps and sandals, when he applies a scalpel [<i>izmel</i>] to</b> the hide, the hide becomes <b>pure;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say:</b> The hide does not become pure <b>until he reduces</b> the size of the hide to a measure of less <b>than five handbreadths. In any event, when he reduces</b> the hide to a measure of less than five handbreadths, everyone agrees that it becomes <b>pure. Why</b> is this so? <b>Let us say</b> according the opinion of Reish Lakish that the hide should not become pure, as it is <b>repairable.</b>

### Part 15
Reish Lakish responded to Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>When I said that</b> a torn hide is <b>repairable,</b> I was referring to a case <b>where one cut</b> the hide in a <b>straight</b> line. By contrast, <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where one cut</b> the hide <b>in a circular manner.</b> In such a case, the hide is not repairable.

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Reish Lakish from the mishna: In the case of <b>one who flays</b> either <b>a domesticated animal or an undomesticated animal, a ritually pure</b> animal <b>or a ritually impure</b> animal, <b>a small</b> animal <b>or a large</b> animal, if he is flaying the animal <b>for</b> the purpose of using the hide as <b>a carpet,</b> the halakhic status of the hide remains that of flesh until he has flayed <b>the measure of grasping.</b> Rabbi Yirmeya infers: <b>But</b> once one has flayed <b>more than the measure of grasping,</b> the hide is <b>pure. But</b> according to Reish Lakish, <b>why</b> is this so? <b>Let us say</b> that the hide is <b>repairable,</b> i.e., it can be sewn back on. <b>Rabbi Avin interpreted</b> the mishna and explained that <b>one</b> piece after <b>one</b> piece, i.e., each piece that is flayed is <b>rendered fallen</b> and disconnected from the flesh, as it will never be reattached to the flesh, unlike the case of a torn hide, which may be sewn back together.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Yosef raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Reish Lakish from another ruling in the mishna: With regard to <b>the hide over the neck, Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: It is not</b> considered to have <b>a connection</b> to the flesh, as the hide is merely loosely connected to the neck itself, and it is pure. According to Reish Lakish, <b>why</b> is this so? <b>Doesn’t</b> the hide <b>exist</b> in its <b>repaired</b> state, i.e., isn’t it still connected to the neck itself? If an impure hide that was torn and can be repaired remains impure, this should certainly be the <i>halakha</i> with regard to hide that was never moved from its initial state.

### Part 18
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: Instead of objecting to the opinion of Reish Lakish due to the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The hide covering the neck is considered to have <b>a connection</b> to the flesh, a statement that supports the opinion of Reish Lakish according to your reasoning.

### Part 19
<b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> The dispute between Reish Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan is irrelevant to the dispute in the mishna between Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri and the Rabbis. In the mishna, <b>they disagree with regard to</b> whether an appendage, such as the hide of the neck, that <b>protects</b> the flesh but is <b>prone to become detached by itself</b> is considered to be protection. One <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is</b> considered to be <b>protection, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is not</b> considered to be <b>protection.</b>

### Part 20
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Reish Lakish from a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 5:7): With regard to <b>an oven that has become impure, how does one purify it? One divides</b> the oven <b>into three</b> parts <b>and scrapes off the</b> layer of <b>plaster</b> that surrounds the oven
