### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an animal whose fetus died in its womb and the shepherd reached his hand</b> into the womb <b>and touched</b> the fetus, <b>both in</b> the case of <b>a non-kosher animal and in</b> the case of <b>a kosher animal</b> the fetus does not have the status of an animal carcass that imparts ritual impurity, and the shepherd remains <b>ritually pure. Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: In</b> the case of <b>a non-kosher</b> animal it is <b>impure, and in</b> the case of <b>a kosher</b> animal it is <b>pure.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of the first <i>tanna</i>? Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is apparent through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> being inside <b>its mother is effective to permit it for consumption</b> through the slaughter of its mother even if the fetus was found dead inside the womb, then <b>should</b> being inside its mother <b>not</b> also <b>be effective to render it pure from</b> the impurity of <b>an animal carcass?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a rationale for this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a kosher animal; from where do we</b> derive that the same applies to <b>a non-kosher animal?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states:</b> “And when a domesticated animal dies, of those that you eat, one who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The Gemara interprets the verse as follows: <b>“And when a domesticated animal dies,” this</b> is referring to <b>a non-kosher animal; “of those that you eat,” this</b> is referring to <b>a kosher animal.</b> The verse thereby <b>juxtaposes a non-kosher animal to a kosher animal</b> with regard to imparting impurity of a carcass, and teaches that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>a kosher animal, its fetus</b> that died in its womb is <b>pure,</b> as derived above through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>a non-kosher animal, its</b> dead <b>fetus</b> is <b>pure.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, what is the reason</b> for his ruling? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said that the verse states</b> with regard to non-kosher animals that do not have cloven hooves: <b>“And whatever walks on its paws, among any [<i>bekhol</i>] undomesticated animal [<i>ḥayya</i>] that walks</b> on all fours, they are impure for you; whoever touches their carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:27). Rabbi Yosei HaGelili expounds this verse as follows: Those animals <b>that walk on</b> their <b>paws,</b> i.e., that do not have cloven hooves, which are <b>inside</b> the body of <b>an animal, I rendered impure for you.</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak interprets the term <i>bekhol</i> as meaning: Inside the body of, and the word <i>ḥayya</i> as meaning: A live animal. Accordingly, he understands the verse to be referring to a dead fetus found inside a living animal.

### Part 5
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then a dead fetus with <b>non-cloven</b> hooves found <b>inside a cow should be impure,</b> despite the fact that it is from a kosher species, <b>as it is</b> an animal that <b>walks on</b> its <b>paws</b> that is <b>inside</b> the body of a kosher <b>animal.</b> The Gemara explains: The verse renders impure an animal that <b>walks upon</b> its four <b>paws</b> that is <b>inside</b> an animal <b>that walks</b> on <b>four</b> paws. <b>But this is</b> a case of an animal that <b>walks</b> on <b>four inside</b> an animal that <b>walks on eight.</b> Since the mother cow’s hooves are entirely split into two parts, it actually walks on eight parts and is not the animal referred to by the verse.

### Part 6
The Gemara raises another objection: If that is so, then a dead fetus in the form of <b>a cow,</b> which has eight parts to its legs, <b>inside the womb of a camel,</b> a non-kosher animal with non-cloven hooves, <b>should not be impure, as it is</b> an animal that <b>walks on eight inside</b> an animal that <b>walks on four,</b> and the verse is not referring to it. The Gemara responds that the verse could have stated: <b>Walks upon,</b> but instead states: <b>“And whatever walks upon,”</b> i.e., the addition of the word “whatever” serves <b>to include</b> a dead <b>cow</b> fetus <b>in the womb of a camel,</b> teaching that it is impure.

### Part 7
The Gemara objects: If that is so, then a dead fetus with <b>non-cloven</b> hooves <b>inside the womb of</b> a cow with <b>non-cloven</b> hooves should <b>be impure, as it is</b> an animal that <b>walks on four inside</b> an animal that <b>walks on four,</b> but the <i>halakha</i> is that since the mother is a kosher species, it is pure. The Gemara explains: It is <b>to that</b> end that the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference of <b>Rav Ḥisda is effective,</b> as it renders pure the fetuses of all kosher animals, even if their hooves are not fully cloven.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami objects to this</b> explanation that the verse renders impure only animals that walk on four inside animals that walk on four: If that is so, a dead <b>pig</b> fetus <b>inside the womb of a female pig should not be impure, as</b> a pig has cloven hooves, and so <b>it is</b> an animal that <b>walks on eight inside</b> an animal that <b>walks on eight,</b> and so the verse is not referring to it.

### Part 9
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s opinion is derived <b>from here:</b> The verse states with regard to the sliding-scale offering brought by one who was unaware that he was impure when he ate consecrated food or entered the Temple: <b>“A person who touched anything impure, or the carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal, or the carcass of an impure creeping animal,</b> and is guilty, it having being hidden from him that he is impure” (Leviticus 5:2).

### Part 10
The verse presents a difficulty: <b>Does</b> only <b>a carcass of a non-kosher animal impart impurity, and</b> that <b>of a kosher</b> animal <b>not impart impurity?</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that both do. <b>Rather, what is this</b> animal to which the verse is referring? <b>This is a fetus, which</b> if <b>inside a non-kosher</b> animal is <b>impure, and</b> if <b>inside a kosher</b> animal is <b>pure.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And since</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> the statement of <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, why do I</b> need the proof <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> from the verse: “And whatever walks on its paws, among any undomesticated animal that walks on all fours” (Leviticus 11:27)? The Gemara explains: <b>Were it not</b> for the derivation of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, I would say</b> that <b>the entire</b> verse expounded by Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>comes to</b> teach only <b>that which Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi derived from it, as cited by the Gemara later on. Rabbi Yitzḥak’s statement <b>teaches us</b> that the verse is also to be expounded as Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak explained.

### Part 12
§ It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan,</b> a student of Rabbi Yishmael, <b>says: I said [<i>namti</i>] to ben Azzai: We learned that a carcass of a kosher domesticated animal imparts impurity</b> from the verse: “And when a domesticated animal dies, of those that you eat, one who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). <b>And</b> we learned that <b>a carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal imparts impurity,</b> and <b>that a carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal imparts impurity,</b> from the verse: “A person who touched anything impure, or the carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal” (Leviticus 5:2).

### Part 13
But <b>we did not</b> yet <b>learn</b> about <b>a carcass of a kosher undomesticated animal. From where</b> is it derived that it imparts impurity? Ben Azzai <b>said to me</b> that this is derived from the verse: “And <b>whatever walks on its paws, among any undomesticated animal that walks</b> on all fours” (Leviticus 11:27). The inclusive term “among any” serves to include even a carcass of a kosher undomesticated animal among those that impart impurity.

### Part 14
Rabbi Yonatan continues. <b>I said to</b> ben Azzai: <b>But does it state: And any undomesticated animal? Isn’t it stated only: “Among any undomesticated animal”?</b> And as explained earlier, this <b>comes to</b> teach <b>that</b> a dead fetus in the form of any of the animals that <b>walk on</b> their <b>paws inside an undomesticated animal imparts impurity. He said to me: And what does</b> Rabbi <b>Yishmael,</b> your teacher, <b>say about this matter?</b>

### Part 15
<b>I said to him</b> that Rabbi Yishmael derives all these <i>halakhot</i> from the verse: “And when a domesticated animal dies, of those that you eat, one who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39), as follows: <b>“And when a domesticated animal [<i>habehema</i>] dies,” this</b> is referring to <b>a non-kosher animal; “of those that you eat,” this</b> is referring to <b>a kosher animal.</b> And <b>we learned</b> that <b>a <i>ḥayya</i> is included</b> in the category of <b>a <i>behema</i>,</b> i.e., the term <i>behema</i> can also refer collectively to both domesticated and undomesticated animals. <b>And</b> likewise, <b>a <i>behema</i> is included</b> in the category of <b>a <i>ḥayya</i>.</b>

### Part 16
Furthermore, <b>a kosher <i>ḥayya</i> is included</b> when the Torah makes reference to <b>a kosher <i>behema</i>,</b> and <b>a non-kosher <i>ḥayya</i> is included</b> when the Torah makes reference to <b>a non-kosher <i>behema</i>.</b>
