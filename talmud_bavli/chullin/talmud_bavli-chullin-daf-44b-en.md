### Part 1
<b>The majority of its width,</b> counting the width of the wall of the windpipe itself, the thickness of which is uneven. <b>And some say</b> that Rav says: The <b>majority of its space,</b> the inner area of the cross section of the windpipe, not counting the width of the windpipe wall.

### Part 2
The Gemara recounts: There was <b>a certain</b> animal with <b>a cut windpipe that came before Rav,</b> i.e., it was brought for inspection to decide whether it was kosher. Rav <b>was sitting and checking it</b> to see if the windpipe had been cut <b>in the majority of its width. Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav:</b> Didn’t <b>you teach us, our teacher,</b> that a cut windpipe is measured by the <b>majority of its space?</b> Rav <b>sent</b> the animal <b>before Rabba bar bar Ḥana,</b> who <b>checked it in the majority of its space and deemed it kosher, and purchased meat from it</b> at the price of <b>thirteen plain <i>istera</i> coins.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And how</b> could Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>do this,</b> i.e., deem permitted an animal that Rav was going to deem prohibited? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a halakhic authority deemed</b> an item <b>impure, another</b> halakhic authority <b>is not allowed to deem</b> it <b>pure;</b> likewise, if he <b>prohibited</b> it, <b>another</b> authority <b>is not allowed to permit</b> it? The Gemara responds: It <b>is different here, since Rav did not</b> actually <b>prohibit</b> the animal. He merely considered doing so, but he sent it to Rabba bar bar Ḥana before issuing a formal ruling.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And once a halakhic authority has ruled with regard to</b> the animal, even to permit it, <b>how</b> could Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>eat from it? But isn’t it written: “Then I said: Alas, Lord God, my soul has not become impure; and from my youth until now I have not eaten an unslaughtered carcass, or a <i>tereifa</i>; and no <i>piggul</i> flesh came into my mouth”</b> (Ezekiel 4:14).

### Part 5
The Sages interpreted the verse as follows: <b>“My soul has not been become impure”</b> means <b>that I did not think</b> of sexual thoughts <b>during the day</b> so as <b>to come to</b> the <b>impurity</b> of a seminal emission <b>at night. “I have not eaten an unslaughtered carcass, or a <i>tereifa</i>”</b> means <b>that I never ate</b> the <b>flesh of</b> an animal that was in danger of imminent death, leading one to say: <b>Slaughter</b> it, <b>slaughter</b> it quickly, before it dies. <b>“And no <i>piggul</i> flesh came into my mouth,”</b> means <b>that I never ate from an animal</b> with regard to <b>which</b> there was uncertainty whether it is prohibited and <b>a Sage issued a ruling</b> to permit it. The Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Natan:</b> The phrase means <b>that I never ate from an animal</b> from <b>which the gifts</b> of the priesthood, the foreleg, jaw, and abomasum, <b>were not separated.</b> The above acts are technically permitted but unseemly. How, then, could Rabba bar bar Ḥana consume the meat of this animal?

### Part 6
The Gemara responds: <b>This statement,</b> that it is unseemly for a halakhic authority to rely on his own ruling to permit the meat, applies only to <b>a matter that depends on reasoning. Rabba bar bar Ḥana relied on his learning,</b> i.e., a received tradition. There is nothing unseemly about relying upon a received tradition.

### Part 7
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> let one <b>derive</b> that Rabba bar bar Ḥana should not have purchased the meat <b>due to suspicion, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>issued a judgment, acquitted or convicted, deemed impure or pure, prohibited or permitted; or</b> if <b>witnesses testified</b> with regard to a case, in <b>all of</b> these instances the judges or witnesses <b>are allowed to purchase</b> the item that they deemed permitted. <b>But the Sages said: Distance</b> yourself <b>from unseemliness and from</b> things <b>similar to it.</b> If so, Rabba bar bar Ḥana should not have purchased the meat that he himself permitted.

### Part 8
The Gemara responds: <b>This statement</b> applies only to <b>an item that is sold</b> based on <b>an appraisal</b> of its value and not by standard measure. In such cases onlookers might suspect that the judge is receiving a favorable price in return for his judgment. But <b>here, the weight</b> of the meat <b>proves</b> that the judge is not receiving a discount, but is paying the standard price. This is <b>like that</b> incident <b>where Rabba permitted</b> a possible <b><i>tereifa</i></b> for consumption <b>and bought meat from it.</b> His wife, <b>the daughter of Rav Ḥisda, said to him: Father permitted a firstborn</b> animal, declaring that it possessed a blemish that renders it permitted for consumption, <b>but did not buy meat from it.</b> Why are you acting differently?

### Part 9
Rabba <b>said to her: That matter</b> applies to <b>a firstborn, which is sold</b> based <b>on appraisal</b> of its value. <b>Here, the weight</b> of the meat <b>proves</b> that I am paying the standard price and not unfairly deriving benefit from my judgment. <b>What</b> suspicion <b>is there</b> in this case? Will people suspect me <b>because</b> I received <b>a superior piece of meat? Every day they sell me a superior piece of meat.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara cites an aphorism: <b>Rav Ḥisda says: Who is a Torah scholar? This is one who sees his own <i>tereifa</i>.</b> In other words, when the status of his own animal is uncertain, he deems it prohibited without concern for his own monetary loss. <b>And Rav Ḥisda says: Who is</b> referred to by the verse: <b>“He that hates gifts shall live”</b> (Proverbs 15:27)? <b>This is one who sees his own <i>tereifa</i>.</b> He is careful to avoid deriving benefit from that which is not his own, and even from items that are his concerning which it is questionable whether or not they are permitted.

### Part 11
<b>Mar Zutra taught in the name of Rav Ḥisda: Anyone who reads</b> the Torah <b>and studies</b> the Mishna, <b>and sees his own <i>tereifa</i>, and has served Torah scholars</b> to learn the ways of halakhic judgment, <b>about him the verse states: “When you eat the labor of your hands, happy shall you be, and it shall be well with you”</b> (Psalms 128:2). <b>Rav Zevid says:</b> Such a person <b>merits inheriting two worlds, this world and the World-to-Come.</b> When the verse states: <b>“Happy shall you be,”</b> it means <b>in this world,</b> and when it states: <b>“And it shall be well with you,”</b> it is referring <b>to the World-to-Come.</b>

### Part 12
With regard to the verse: “He that hates gifts shall live,” the Gemara relates that <b>when they would send Rabbi Elazar some</b> gift <b>from the house of the <i>Nasi</i>, he would not take</b> it. <b>And when they would invite him, he would not go</b> there. When declining these offers, <b>he said</b> to them: <b>Does Master not desire that I live? As it is written: “He that hates gifts shall live.”</b> By contrast, <b>when they would send</b> a gift <b>to Rabbi Zeira, he would not take</b> it, but <b>when they would invite him he would go. He said</b> in explanation:
