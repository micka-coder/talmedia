### Part 1
<b>beans lie at the opening of the skull,</b> where the spinal cord exits. <b>From the beans inward,</b> the nerve tissue is considered <b>like the inside,</b> i.e., the brain. Therefore, if its membrane is perforated, even minimally, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>From the beans outward,</b> the nerve tissue is considered <b>like the outside,</b> i.e., the spinal cord. A perforation of the membrane in this area renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> only if the spinal cord is mostly cut. <b>And</b> with regard to the area of <b>the beans themselves, I do not know</b> what the <i>halakha</i> is; <b>but it stands to reason</b> that it is considered <b>like the inside.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya inspected a bird and found</b> protrusions <b>similar</b> to <b>two beans lying on the opening of the skull.</b>

### Part 3
§ The mishna states: If <b>the heart was perforated to its chamber,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> Is the mishna referring <b>to</b> the <b>small chamber</b> within the heart <b>or to</b> the <b>large chamber? Abaye said to him: What is your dilemma? Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna with regard to the lung: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> It is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>unless it is perforated</b> through <b>to the bronchi? And Rabba bar Taḥlifa says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> Rabbi Shimon means that it is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>unless it is perforated</b> through <b>to the large bronchus.</b> If so, it may be presumed that the mishna is referring to the large chamber of the heart as well.

### Part 4
The Gemara responds: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> the mishna <b>teaches: To the bronchi [<i>simponot</i>],</b> in the plural form, i.e., the one bronchus <b>into which all the bronchi [<i>simponot</i>] empty</b> out. <b>But here,</b> with regard to the heart, it <b>teaches: To the chamber. What</b> is it <b>to me</b> if this is <b>a large chamber</b> and <b>what</b> is it <b>to me</b> if it is <b>a small chamber?</b> The language does not indicate one or the other.

### Part 5
§ With regard to the <b>aorta,</b> the chief artery exiting the heart, <b>Rav says:</b> Like the heart itself, if it is perforated <b>in any amount</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> The animal is a <i>tereifa</i> only if the aorta is perforated <b>in its majority.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> blood vessel <b>is the aorta? Rabba bar Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> This is the artery found in the <b>fat on the sides.</b> The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> to say that this is referring to the <b>sides</b> of the animal, i.e., the ribs, which are not adjacent to the heart? <b>Rather,</b> this is referring to the artery covered in fat <b>that</b> exits the heart and passes <b>on the sides of the lung.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Ameimar says in the name of Rav Naḥman: There are three ducts</b> adjacent to one another in an animal’s chest. <b>One separates to the heart, and one separates to the lung, and one separates to the liver.</b> The duct <b>of the lung</b> is treated <b>like the lung,</b> and renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> if perforated in any amount. The duct <b>of the liver</b> is treated <b>like the liver,</b> and only if it is completely missing does it render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, in accordance with the mishna. As for the duct <b>of the heart,</b> the aorta, Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree</b> as to the measure of its perforation, as mentioned above.

### Part 8
<b>Mar bar Ḥiyya teaches the opposite:</b> The duct <b>of the lung</b> is treated <b>like the liver</b> and renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> only if it is completely missing. The duct <b>of the liver</b> is treated <b>like the lung,</b> and a perforation of any amount renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. And with regard to the duct <b>of the heart,</b> Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef went and stated the <i>halakha</i> of Rav,</b> that an aorta perforated in any amount renders an animal a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>before Shmuel.</b> Shmuel <b>said to him: If Abba,</b> i.e., Rav, actually <b>said so, he knows nothing at all about <i>tereifot</i>.</b>

### Part 10
§ The mishna states: If <b>the spinal</b> column <b>was broken</b> and its cord was cut, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. With regard to this <b>the Sages taught:</b> If <b>the spinal cord was cut in its majority,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says:</b> It is a <i>tereifa</i> <b>even</b> if the spinal cord was only <b>perforated.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara notes: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>ruled in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov</b> that even a small perforation of the spinal cord renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And how much is</b> considered <b>a majority of</b> the spinal cord to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>Rav says: A majority of</b> the circumference of <b>its</b> surrounding membranes, the <b>meninges. And some say a majority of the nerve tissue of</b> the spinal cord itself. In other words, even if the meninges are intact, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if a majority of the nerve tissue is cut.

### Part 13
The Gemara notes: According to <b>the one who says</b> that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if <b>a majority of the nerve tissue</b> is severed, <b>all the more so</b> if <b>a majority of the meninges</b> is cut, since if the meninges, the protective membranes, are damaged, the nerve tissue itself will certainly be damaged soon thereafter. But <b>according to the one who says</b> that a tear in <b>a majority of the meninges</b> renders it a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in a case where only <b>a majority of the nerve tissue</b> was cut? Perhaps the intact membranes will keep the damage from spreading.

### Part 14
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof: <b>As Nayyoli says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says: The majority of</b> the spinal cord, <b>which they said</b> renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> if cut, is <b>the majority of</b> the <b>meninges.</b> But <b>this nerve tissue makes no difference.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Natan bar Avin was sitting before Rav.</b> Rav Natan first <b>checked</b> the spinal cord to make sure that <b>a majority of</b> the <b>meninges</b> was intact, <b>and</b> then <b>was checking</b> to see that <b>a majority of its nerve tissue</b> was intact. Rav <b>said to him: If a majority of</b> the <b>meninges is intact, this nerve tissue makes no difference.</b>

### Part 16
§ <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> If the spinal cord <b>was liquefied [<i>nitmareikh</i>],</b> the animal is <b>unfit</b> for consumption. Even if it <b>softened [<i>nitmasmeis</i>],</b> the animal is <b>unfit,</b> i.e., a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>What is liquefaction, and what is softening? Liquefaction</b> is <b>any</b> case in <b>which</b> the nerve tissue becomes liquid, and if the membrane is punctured it can be <b>poured</b> out <b>like</b> water from <b>a jug. Softening</b> is <b>any</b> case in <b>which</b> the nerve tissue <b>cannot stand</b> upright on its own and sags when it is not being supported.

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> In a case where the spinal cord became unusually heavy such that it <b>cannot stand</b> upright <b>due to its weight,</b> but not due to softening or melting, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. <b>In the study hall they say:</b> If the spinal cord <b>softened</b> due to disease, the animal is <b>unfit</b> for consumption. But if some of its tissue softened and <b>was emptied</b> from the spinal cord, the animal remains <b>kosher.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: An animal whose nerve tissue was emptied [<i>nitmazmez</i>]</b> from the spinal cord <b>is a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> version of the <i>baraita</i> is incorrect. In fact, the word <b>softened [<i>nitmasmes</i>] was stated,</b> not the word emptied.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so,</b> that an animal whose nerve tissue has dissolved is kosher? <b>But didn’t</b> it happen that <b>Levi was sitting in the bathhouse,</b> where <b>he saw a certain man who banged his head</b> severely, whereupon <b>he said: This</b> man’s <b>nerve tissue has</b> softened and <b>been emptied?</b> Is it <b>not</b> that Levi meant <b>that</b> the man <b>cannot live?</b> If so, the softening and emptying of the nerve tissue should render an animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Abaye said: No,</b> he intended <b>to say that</b> the man <b>cannot reproduce,</b> since head trauma might lead to infertility.

### Part 19
§ The Gemara asks: <b>Until where</b> does the <b>spinal cord</b> extend downward, such that if it is cut above that point the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Until</b> the point <b>between the branches</b> of the spinal cord that split off behind the thighs.

### Part 20
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rav Dimi bar Yitzḥak wanted to go to Bei Ḥozai. He came before Rabbi Yehuda</b> and <b>said to him: Master, show me, where</b> is the area <b>between the branches</b> to which Shmuel referred? Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to him: Go bring me a kid and I will show you.</b> Rav Dimi bar Yitzḥak <b>brought him</b> a choice <b>kid</b> with much <b>fat.</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to him:</b> The location <b>is buried very</b> deep in the fat <b>and</b> is <b>not recognizable. He brought</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>a lean</b> kid. Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to him:</b> The bones <b>jut out very</b> far, <b>and</b> the location is <b>not recognizable.</b>

### Part 21
Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to him: Come, I will teach you a tradition</b> without showing you: <b>This</b> is what <b>Shmuel said:</b> There are three successive points around the same bone behind the pelvis at which branches diverge from the spinal cord. If the spinal cord is cut anywhere <b>until the first</b> gap between these branches, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> If it is severed anywhere after <b>the third</b> gap, i.e., after the third branch, the animal is <b>kosher.</b> If it was severed within the <b>second</b> gap, i.e., between these areas, <b>I do not know</b> the <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 22
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, raises a dilemma:</b>
