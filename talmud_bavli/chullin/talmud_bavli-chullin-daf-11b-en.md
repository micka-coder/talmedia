### Part 1
that <b>perhaps one of</b> the animals, the scapegoat, <b>is a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> Since it is not slaughtered, but is rather cast from a cliff while alive, there is no way to ascertain that it is not a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of animals, which are not <i>tereifot</i>?

### Part 2
<b>And if you would</b> seek to reject that proof and <b>say</b> that there is no need for an examination, as <b>what</b> practical <b>difference is there to us</b> whether it is a <i>tereifa</i>, since it is neither eaten nor sacrificed, and the two goats are fit after the fact even if they are not equal (see <i>Yoma</i> 62a); <b>doesn’t the lot determine</b> the goat <b>for Azazel only with regard to an item,</b> a goat, <b>that is fit</b> for sacrifice <b>to the Lord? And if you would say that we examine</b> the goat after it is cast from the cliff and do not rely on a majority, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 67a): The goat <b>did not reach halfway</b> down <b>the mountain until it was</b> torn <b>limb</b> from <b>limb.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Mari said:</b> The fact that one follows a non-quantifiable majority is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one who strikes his father or his mother,</b> with regard to <b>whom the Merciful One states: Kill him</b> (see Exodus 21:15). Rav Mari clarifies: <b>But let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the man that he struck <b>is not</b> actually <b>his father. Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority, and the majority of</b> acts of <b>intercourse</b> performed by a married woman <b>are attributable to the husband.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is that conclusion drawn? <b>Perhaps</b> the reference is to a case <b>where</b> at the time he was conceived <b>his mother and father were incarcerated</b> together <b>in prison.</b> Therefore, the fact that it was his father that he struck is based on certainty, not a majority. The Gemara answers: <b>Even so, there is no steward [<i>apotropos</i>] for</b> restraining <b>sexual immorality,</b> and the identity of his father is not based on certainty.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Kahana said:</b> It is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one who kills</b> another <b>person,</b> with regard to <b>whom the Merciful One states: Kill him</b> (see Exodus 21:12). Rav Kahana clarifies: <b>And let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the person that he killed <b>was a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> one who has a wound or condition that will lead to his death within twelve months. One who kills a <i>tereifa</i> is exempt from capital punishment because in that sense, the halakhic status of a <i>tereifa</i> is that of a dead person. <b>Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of people, who are not <i>tereifot</i>?

### Part 6
<b>And if you would</b> seek to reject that proof and <b>say that we examine</b> the corpse to determine whether he was a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>wouldn’t</b> the corpse be <b>mutilated</b> through that examination? <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>due to</b> concern for the possibility of an unjustified <b>loss of life of that</b> murderer, <b>we will mutilate</b> the corpse to determine whether the victim was a <i>tereifa</i>, it would remain necessary to rely on the majority, as <b>let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps there was a perforation in the place</b> that he stabbed the victim with the <b>sword.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Ravina said:</b> It is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>conspiring witnesses,</b> with regard to <b>whom the Merciful One states: “And you shall do unto him as he had conspired</b> to do unto his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19). If the witnesses testified falsely that a person is guilty of a capital offense, they are liable to receive the death penalty. <b>And let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps that</b> person <b>against whom they testified was a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> and they should not be executed for conspiring to have a <i>tereifa</i> executed. <b>Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of people, who are not <i>tereifot</i>?

### Part 8
<b>And if you would say</b> in rejection of that proof <b>that we examine</b> the corpse of the executed defendant to determine whether he was a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>a distinguished Sage [<i>beribbi</i>] says</b> with regard to witnesses who conspired to have a person killed based on their testimony: If the conspiring witnesses have <b>not</b> yet <b>killed</b> the accused with their testimony, <b>they are executed;</b> but if <b>they killed</b> the accused with their testimony, <b>they are not executed.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The principle of following a non-quantifiable majority is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>slaughter itself,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states: Slaughter</b> the animal <b>and eat</b> it. <b>And let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he is slaughtering</b> the animal <b>in the place of</b> a preexisting <b>perforation. Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of animals that are not <i>tereifot</i>?

### Part 10
<b>Rav Ashi said: I stated</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> before Rav Kahana, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Kahana</b> stated this <i>halakha</i> <b>before Rav Shimi, and</b> the Sage before whom the <i>halakha</i> was stated <b>said to</b> the one who stated it: <b>And perhaps where</b> it is <b>possible</b> to examine the situation it is <b>possible,</b> and the majority is not followed; but <b>where</b> it is <b>not possible</b> to examine the situation it is <b>not possible,</b> and the majority is followed.

### Part 11
<b>As if you do not say so,</b> then according <b>to Rabbi Meir, who</b> despite the existence of a majority <b>takes the minority into consideration</b> and does not follow the majority, is it <b>indeed</b> true <b>that one does not eat meat</b> due to the concern that there was a perforation in the place that he slaughtered the animal? <b>And if you would say, indeed,</b> according to Rabbi Meir it is prohibited to eat meat,
