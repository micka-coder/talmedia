### Part 1
<b>the valley of Aravot [<i>pakta da’aravot</i>],</b> where there was a shortage of water: People <b>such as you, for whom water is scarce,</b> should <b>wash your hands in the morning and stipulate with regard to them for the entire day. Some say</b> that Rabbi Avina maintains that <b>in exigent circumstances, yes,</b> one should act in this manner, but when one is <b>not in exigent circumstances,</b> he should <b>not</b> do so. <b>And</b> according to this explanation, Rabbi Avina <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> who permitted this practice to all. <b>And some say</b> that Rabbi Avina ruled that one may do so <b>even</b> when <b>not in exigent circumstances, and</b> Rabbi Avina’s opinion <b>is</b> identical to that <b>of Rav.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> With regard to <b>this irrigation channel [<i>arita dedalla’ei</i>],</b> into which water is poured from a river using buckets, and which then transports the water to the fields, <b>one may not wash</b> his <b>hands in</b> it. The reason is that this water <b>does not come from a person’s force,</b> i.e., it is not poured on the hands by a direct act, as it moves by force of the current in the channel. <b>But if one draws his hands near the bucket</b> itself, in such a manner <b>that</b> the water poured on his hands <b>comes from a person’s force</b> before it begins to flow in the channel, then <b>one may wash</b> his <b>hands with it.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And if the bucket</b> in which the water is drawn from the river <b>is perforated</b> with a hole large enough <b>to enable liquid to enter</b> the vessel when it is placed in the river, the presence of this hole <b>connects</b> the water in the channel to the water in the river, as they touch through that hole. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>one may immerse</b> his <b>hands in</b> that channel as he would in the river itself. Yet the perforated bucket is invalid for the washing of the hands by pouring, since it is no longer considered a vessel. As <b>Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a vessel that is perforated</b> with a hole large enough <b>to enable liquid to enter, one may not wash</b> his <b>hands with it.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a vessel that does not have a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> of water <b>in it, one may not wash</b> his <b>hands with it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rava say:</b> With regard to <b>a vessel that cannot contain a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> of water, <b>one may not wash</b> his <b>hands with it.</b> It may be <b>consequently</b> inferred that as long as the vessel <b>can contain</b> a quarter-<i>log</i>, one may use it <b>even if it does not</b> currently <b>have</b> a quarter-<i>log</i> <b>in it.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; this</b> former statement, requiring a quarter-<i>log</i> of actual water, is referring to washing <b>for one</b> person, whereas <b>that</b> latter statement, requiring only that the vessel have a capacity of a quarter-<i>log</i>, is referring to washing <b>for two</b> people. If a vessel originally contained a quarter-<i>log</i> of water, then even if less than that amount remains after one person has washed his hands, a second individual may use the remainder, which is considered fit based on the water’s original volume. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of water, one may wash the hands of one</b> individual, <b>and even</b> those <b>of two.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Sheshet said to Ameimar: Are you particular about the vessel</b> used for washing hands, that it be wholly intact? Ameimar <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rav Sheshet further inquired: Are you also particular <b>about the appearance</b> of the water, that it be normal? Ameimar again <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rav Sheshet further asked: Are you particular <b>about the measure</b> of water, that it be no less than one quarter-<i>log</i>? Ameimar <b>said to him: Yes.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Some say</b> that <b>this</b> is what Ameimar <b>said to him: We are particular about</b> the wholeness of <b>the vessel and about</b> the water’s <b>appearance,</b> but <b>we are not particular about</b> the water’s <b>measure, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of water one may wash the hands of one</b> individual, <b>and even</b> those <b>of two.</b> The <i>baraita</i> indicates that there is no need for a quarter-<i>log</i> for each individual.

### Part 8
The Gemara notes: <b>And it is not so,</b> i.e., one cannot derive from the <i>baraita</i> that the measure of water is immaterial. <b>It is different there because</b> there the water <b>comes from the remainder of</b> a measure initially sufficient for <b>purity.</b> If there was not initially a quarter-<i>log</i>, the water is unfit for even one person.

### Part 9
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ya’akov from Nehar Pekod prepared a glass vessel that could contain a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> of water for washing his hands. <b>Rav Ashi in Huzal</b> likewise <b>prepared an earthenware vessel that could contain a quarter</b>-<i>log</i>.

### Part 10
<b>And Rava says:</b> If <b>one prepared the stopper of a barrel</b> for use as a vessel by hollowing it out until it contained a quarter-<i>log</i>, <b>one may wash</b> his <b>hands with it,</b> even though it was not originally designated for this function. <b>This</b> ruling <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one prepared the stopper of a barrel</b> for this purpose, <b>one may wash</b> his <b>hands with it.</b> Likewise, with regard to <b>a <i>ḥemet</i> and a <i>kefisha</i>,</b> types of leather wineskins, <b>that one prepared</b> for this purpose, <b>one may wash</b> his <b>hands with them,</b> as they were initially designed to hold liquids. But with regard to <b>a sack and a basket, even if they can contain</b> water, <b>one may not wash</b> his <b>hands with them,</b> as no sack or basket is designed to hold water, and most cannot.

### Part 11
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to eating with a cloth [<i>mappa</i>]</b> on one’s hands, rather than washing them to purify them? <b>Are we concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> he will <b>touch</b> the food with his hands, <b>or not?</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a mishna (<i>Sukka</i> 26b): <b>And when they gave Rabbi Tzadok</b> on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>less than an egg-bulk of food, he took</b> the food <b>in a cloth, and he ate it outside the <i>sukka</i>,</b> as he held one is not obligated to eat food of this amount in a <i>sukka</i>. <b>And he did not recite a blessing after</b> eating <b>it,</b> since less than an egg-bulk does not satisfy the verse: “And you shall eat and be satisfied and bless the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 8:10). <b>What, is it not</b> to be inferred that <b>consequently,</b> if one eats <b>an egg-bulk,</b> it <b>requires washing of the hands,</b> even if one uses a cloth?

### Part 13
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Perhaps</b> one can conclude from that mishna only that <b>consequently,</b> if one eats <b>an egg-bulk</b> he <b>needs</b> to do so in <b>a <i>sukka</i> and needs</b> to recite <b>a blessing</b> after eating; but he can still use a cloth instead of washing his hands.

### Part 14
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from an incident <b>where Shmuel found Rav eating with a cloth</b> rather than washing his hands, and Shmuel <b>said to him:</b>
