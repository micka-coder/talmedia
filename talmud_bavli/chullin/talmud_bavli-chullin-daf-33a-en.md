### Part 1
The Gemara clarifies this dilemma: <b>Does the first <i>siman</i> join</b> together <b>with the second <i>siman</i> to purify the animal from</b> the impurity of <b>an unslaughtered carcass or not?</b> In both cases the dilemma is: Does the cutting of the first <i>siman</i>, which serves the dual purpose of being a component of permitting consumption and preventing impurity of the animal, join together with the cutting of the second <i>siman</i>, which serves only the purpose of preventing impurity, in order to constitute a single act of slaughter and thereby prevent the animal from assuming the impurity of an unslaughtered carcass? Or perhaps because the cutting of each <i>siman</i> is performed for a different purpose they do not join together?

### Part 2
In any event, <b>we raise the dilemma only</b> in order <b>to purify</b> the foreleg <b>from</b> the impurity of <b>an unslaughtered carcass. But with regard to eating</b> the slaughtered animal, all agree that it is <b>forbidden,</b> as even Rabbi Zeira concedes that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> and retracts his objection to the distinction that Rava proposed between the lungs and the innards.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav said to Ravina: Perhaps</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>actually did not retract</b> his opinion, as even initially he held that there is no distinction between lungs and innards. If either is perforated after one <i>siman</i> was cut, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And Rabbi Zeira stated</b> his objection to the distinction of Rava <b>in accordance with the statement of Rava, but</b> he <b>himself does not hold accordingly.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara continues its analysis of the statement of Reish Lakish, who said that after the windpipe is cut, the lung is considered as though it was placed in a basket, and if it is perforated before the slaughter is completed, the animal does not become a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov said: Learn from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> that <b>one may invite Jews</b> to eat the <b>innards</b> of an animal that was slaughtered, <b>but one may not invite gentiles</b> to eat the <b>innards</b> of an animal that was slaughtered, because they are forbidden to gentiles.

### Part 5
<b>What is the reason?</b> For <b>Jews the matter</b> of rendering the meat of the animal fit for consumption <b>is dependent upon</b> the performance of a valid act of <b>slaughter. Once there is full-fledged slaughter</b> and both <i>simanim</i> are cut, the innards <b>are permitted to them</b> even if the animal is convulsing. But with regard to <b>gentiles, for whom stabbing is sufficient</b> and slaughter is not required, the innards are permitted only after the animal is completely dead, since <b>the matter</b> of rendering the meat of the animal fit for consumption <b>is dependent upon</b> its <b>death.</b> Therefore, if the animal is still convulsing, <b>these</b> innards, which are considered to be outside the body after the cutting of the two <i>simanim</i>, are <b>considered like a limb from a living</b> animal and it is forbidden for gentiles to eat them.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Pappa said: I was sitting before Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov and I sought to say to him</b> that his statement is difficult: <b>Is there anything that is permitted for a Jew but prohibited for a gentile? But I did not say</b> that <b>to him, as I said</b> to myself: <b>Didn’t he say a reason</b> for his ruling? Therefore, there is no reason to ask the question.

### Part 7
The Gemara notes: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov: One who seeks to eat from</b> the meat of <b>an animal before its soul departs may cut an olive-bulk of meat from the area of the slaughter,</b> the neck, <b>and salt it very well,</b> i.e., more than is normally required, <b>and rinse it very well</b> in water to remove the salt and the blood, <b>and wait until the</b> animal’s <b>soul departs, and eat it.</b> It is <b>permitted</b> for <b>both a gentile and a Jew to</b> eat <b>it.</b> Contrary to the statement of Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov, there is no distinction between Jew and gentile.

### Part 8
This <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the statement of <b>Rav Idi bar Avin, as Rav Idi bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashyan says: One who seeks to recuperate</b> from an illness should <b>cut an olive-bulk of meat from the area of slaughter,</b> i.e., the neck, <b>of an animal, and salt it very well, and rinse it very well, and wait until the</b> animal’s <b>soul departs,</b> and eat it. It is <b>permitted</b> for <b>both a gentile and a Jew to</b> eat <b>it.</b>

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughters a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or a bird, and blood did not emerge from them</b> during the slaughter, all of these are <b>permitted</b> for consumption <b>and</b> do not require the ritual washing of the hands as <b>they may be eaten with ritually impure [<i>mesoavot</i>] hands, because they were not rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity through contact <b>with blood,</b> which is one of the seven liquids that render food susceptible to impurity. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: They were rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>by means of</b> the <b>slaughter</b> itself.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The <b>reason</b> that they may be eaten with ritually impure hands is <b>that blood did not emerge from</b> the animals or birds during the slaughter; <b>but</b> if <b>blood emerged from them</b> during slaughter, <b>they</b> may <b>not be eaten with ritually impure hands.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> not? Ordinary <b>hands are</b> impure with <b>second-degree</b> ritual impurity <b>and</b> an item of <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>cannot impart third-degree</b> impurity to <b>non-sacred</b> items with which it comes into contact.

### Part 11
The Gemara clarifies: <b>From where</b> is it ascertained <b>that we are dealing</b> in the mishna <b>with non-sacred</b> food, and not with the slaughter of an offering? That is clear, <b>as</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> in the list of those slaughtered: <b>An undomesticated animal. As, if</b> the <i>tanna</i> is referring to the slaughter of <b>sacrificial</b> animals and birds, <b>is there</b> any <b>undomesticated animal</b> included <b>in</b> the framework of <b>sacrificial</b> animals? <b>And furthermore, if</b> the <i>tanna</i> is referring <b>to sacrificial</b> animals, <b>when no blood emerges from them are</b> the offerings <b>valid?</b> The offering <b>itself requires blood,</b> as it is only through the presenting of the blood upon the altar that the offering is accepted.

### Part 12
<b>And furthermore, if</b> the <i>tanna</i> is referring to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>when blood emerges from them, does it render</b> them <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the blood of sacrificial</b> animals <b>does not render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated:</b> “You shall not eat it; <b>you shall pour it upon the earth like water”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:24). <b>Blood</b> of a non-sacred animal, <b>which is poured like water</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>renders</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. By contrast, blood of a sacrificial animal, <b>which is not poured like water</b> but is presented on the altar, <b>does not render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity.

### Part 13
<b>And furthermore, if</b> the <i>tanna</i> is referring to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>when blood does not emerge from them</b> are they <b>not</b> nevertheless rendered <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? <b>Let them be</b> rendered <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>by means of regard for sanctity, as we maintain</b> that <b>regard for sanctity renders</b> food <b>suceptible</b> to ritual impurity even in the absence of contact with any of the seven liquids.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: Here we are dealing with non-sacred</b> food <b>that one purchased</b> in Jerusalem <b>with</b> second-<b>tithe money,</b> which assumes the status of the second-tithe produce. This produce, in turn, assumes third-degree impurity through contact with hands that have second-degree impurity. <b>And</b> this mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 11:5):
