### Part 1
With regard to <b>a borrowed robe,</b> during <b>all</b> of the first <b>thirty days</b> that one borrows it, one is <b>exempt from</b> performing the mitzva of <b>ritual fringes</b> with it.

### Part 2
<b>Meanwhile,</b> as Rav Ḥisda and Rami bar Tamrei were talking, the attendants <b>brought</b> in <b>a certain man</b> to Rav Ḥisda’s court <b>who would not honor his father and mother,</b> and <b>they tied him</b> to a pillar in order to flog him.

### Part 3
Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to them: Leave him</b> alone, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>any positive mitzva whose reward</b> is stated <b>alongside it</b> in the Torah, <b>the</b> earthly <b>court below is not warned to</b> enforce <b>it</b> through punishments such as flogging. And it is stated after the mitzva of honoring one’s father and mother: “That your days may be long, and that it go well with you” (Deuteronomy 5:16). Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Rami bar Tamrei: <b>I see that you are very sharp.</b> Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>If you were in the place where Rav Yehuda</b> resides, <b>I would</b> be able to <b>show you my sharpness</b> of mind far better than here.

### Part 4
§ Pursuant to the discussion of different local customs, <b>Abaye said to Rav Safra: When you ascend there,</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>ask</b> the Sages there: With regard to <b>liver, how do you</b> treat <b>it? When</b> Rav Safra <b>ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>he found Rav Zerika</b> and asked him this question. Rav Zerika <b>said to him: I cooked</b> liver <b>for Rabbi Ami and he ate</b> it.

### Part 5
<b>When</b> Rav Safra returned to Babylonia and <b>came before</b> Abaye and reported what Rav Zerika had said, Abaye <b>said to him: I do not raise the dilemma</b> as <b>to</b> whether liver <b>renders itself prohibited</b> if cooked alone. It is clear to me that the blood that diffuses out of the liver is not absorbed again while it cooks. <b>When I raise the dilemma,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> whether liver <b>renders prohibited another</b> piece of meat cooked with it. Rav Zerika’s statement therefore has no bearing on my question.

### Part 6
Rav Safra asked Abaye: <b>What is different</b> about the issue of the liver <b>rendering itself prohibited, that you did not raise the dilemma</b> with regard to this case? It is presumably because the answer is obvious to you, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 10:11) that liver <b>is not rendered prohibited</b> by its own cooking. But if so, <b>you should not raise the dilemma with regard to</b> whether it <b>renders the other</b> piece of meat <b>prohibited either, as we learned</b> in that same mishna: <b>Liver renders</b> food cooked with it in the same pot <b>prohibited but is not prohibited</b> itself, <b>because</b> while it does <b>expel</b> blood as it cooks, it <b>does not absorb</b> this blood again, since the blood diffuses only outward. Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Safra: That mishna does not answer my question, as <b>perhaps there</b> it is referring specifically <b>to forbidden liver,</b> e.g., the liver of a non-kosher animal.
