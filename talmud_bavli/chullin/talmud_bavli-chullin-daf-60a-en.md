### Part 1
<b>I</b> wish to <b>see Him.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>went and stood</b> the emperor <b>facing the sun in the season of Tammuz,</b> i.e., summer. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: Look at it.</b> The emperor <b>said to him: I cannot.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him:</b> Now, if with regard to <b>the sun, which is</b> only <b>one of the servants that stand before the Holy One, Blessed be He, you say: I cannot look at it,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> with regard to <b>the Divine Presence?</b>

### Part 2
§ The Gemara recounts: <b>The</b> Roman <b>emperor said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: I desire to arrange bread,</b> i.e., a meal, <b>for your God.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: You cannot.</b> The emperor asked him: <b>Why?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: <b>His hosts are too great.</b> The emperor <b>said to him: Truly,</b> I wish to do it. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: Go out and arrange</b> a meal <b>on the shore of the great</b> sea <b>[<i>dirvita</i>], where there is a wide</b> open <b>space.</b> The emperor <b>worked</b> all <b>the six months of summer</b> to accomplish this. <b>A wind came and swept it</b> all <b>into the sea.</b>

### Part 3
The emperor <b>worked</b> to arrange another meal all <b>the six months of winter. Rain came and sank it</b> all <b>in the sea.</b> The emperor <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>What is this?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: These are</b> only the <b>sweepers</b> and floor <b>washers that wait on Him,</b> and they alone have eaten everything. The emperor <b>said to him: If so, I cannot</b> arrange a meal before Him.

### Part 4
§ The Gemara recounts: <b>The daughter of the</b> Roman <b>emperor said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: Your God is a carpenter, as it is written: “Who lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters”</b> (Psalms 104:3). <b>Tell Him to make for me a distaff,</b> a simple tool used in spinning. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya <b>said: Very well. He prayed for mercy for her and she was stricken</b> with leprosy. <b>She sat in the Roman market, and they gave her a distaff, since it was their custom</b> to <b>give a distaff to anyone stricken</b> with leprosy <b>in Rome, and</b> the leper would <b>sit in the market and untangle bunches</b> of wool, <b>so that people would see and pray for mercy on him.</b>

### Part 5
<b>One day</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya <b>was passing there,</b> and he saw that <b>she was sitting and untangling bunches</b> of wool <b>in the Roman market.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya <b>said to her: Is the distaff my God gave you pleasing? She said to him: Tell your God to take</b> back <b>what He has given me.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya <b>said to her: Our God gives,</b> but <b>does not take.</b>

### Part 6
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says: A bull</b> has a large <b>paunch and</b> large <b>hooves. Its head is large, and its tail is large. And the opposite</b> is true <b>for a donkey.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> that results from such a statement? It is relevant <b>for</b> purposes of <b>buying and selling.</b> One who agrees to sell a bull must provide the buyer with one that fits this description, and the opposite for a donkey.

### Part 7
<b>And Rav Yehuda says:</b> The <b>bull that Adam, the first</b> man, <b>sacrificed</b> as a thanks offering for his life being spared <b>had a single horn on its forehead, as it is stated: “And it shall please the Lord better than a bullock that has horns [<i>makrin</i>] and hoofs”</b> (Psalms 69:32). The Gemara comments: On the contrary, the word <b><i>makrin</i> indicates two</b> horns. <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> Although it is vocalized in the plural, <b><i>makran</i> is written</b> in the verse, without the letter <i>yod</i>, to indicate that it had only a single horn.

### Part 8
<b>And Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>the bull that Adam, the first</b> man, <b>sacrificed, its horns preceded its hooves.</b> It was not born of a cow, but rose fully formed out of the earth such that its head emerged first, <b>as it is stated: “And it shall please the Lord better than a bullock that has horns and hoofs.”</b> The phrase <b>“has horns”</b> comes <b>first, and</b> only <b>afterward</b> the word <b>“hoofs.”</b>

### Part 9
And this <b>supports</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: All</b> items created during the <b>acts of Creation were created with their</b> full <b>stature,</b> immediately fit to bear fruit; <b>they were created with their</b> full mental <b>capacities; they were created with their</b> full <b>form. As it is stated: “And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them”</b> (Genesis 2:1). <b>Do not read</b> it as: <b>“The host of them [<i>tzeva’am</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>Their form [<i>tzivyonam</i>].</b>

### Part 10
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa taught: “May the glory of the Lord endure forever; let the Lord rejoice in His works”</b> (Psalms 104:31). <b>This verse was stated by the minister of the world,</b> i.e., the angel charged with overseeing the world. <b>When the Holy One, Blessed be He, said:</b> “Let the earth put forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit tree bearing fruit <b>after its kind”</b> (Genesis 1:11), <b>the grasses drew an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>with regard to themselves.</b>

### Part 11
They reasoned: <b>If the Holy One, Blessed be He, wishes</b> the <b>mixing</b> of species, <b>why did he say: After its kind, with regard to the trees? And furthermore,</b> let us draw <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> with regard to <b>trees, which do not naturally grow mixed,</b> as they are large and distinct from one another, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: “After its kind,” all the more so</b> with regard to <b>us,</b> since grass naturally grows mixed.

### Part 12
<b>Immediately, every</b> kind of grass <b>emerged after its kind,</b> as it is stated: “And the earth brought forth grass, herb yielding seed after its kind” (Genesis 1:12). <b>The minister of the world began</b> to speak <b>and said: “May the glory of the Lord endure forever; let the Lord rejoice in His works,”</b> who do His will even when not explicitly instructed.

### Part 13
With regard to the above description, <b>Ravina raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>grafted two</b> species of <b>grass onto one another,</b> as is done with trees,
