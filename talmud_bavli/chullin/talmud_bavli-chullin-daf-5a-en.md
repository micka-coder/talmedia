### Part 1
The Gemara rejects that suggestion: Jehoshaphat <b>would not have separated himself from</b> Ahab to eat and drink by himself, as he relied on him completely. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>If we say</b> that it is derived <b>from</b> that <b>which is written</b> that Jehoshaphat said to Ahab: <b>“I am as you are, my people as your people”</b> (I Kings 22:4), i.e., I am equally reliable, this is difficult, as, <b>if that is so,</b> then when Jehoshaphat said at the conclusion of that verse: <b>“My horses as your horses,”</b> can this <b>also</b> be referring to reliability? <b>Rather,</b> Jehoshaphat’s intention was: <b>That which will befall your horses will befall my horses; so too, that which will befall you and your people will befall me and my people.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rather,</b> it is derived that Jehoshaphat relied upon Ahab <b>from here: “And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, king of Judea, sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in a threshing floor, at the entrance of the gate of Samaria”</b> (I Kings 22:10). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term <b>threshing floor</b> in this context? <b>If we say</b> that it was <b>an actual threshing floor; is that to say</b> that <b>the gate of Samaria was a threshing floor?</b> Typically, the gate of a city was the place of assembly for the city’s judges and elders, not a threshing floor. <b>Rather,</b> they were sitting in a configuration <b>like</b> that of a circular <b>threshing floor,</b> i.e., facing each other in a display of amity, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 36b): <b>A Sanhedrin was</b> arranged in the same layout <b>as half of a circular threshing floor, so that</b> the judges <b>would see each other.</b> This verse demonstrates that Jehoshaphat deliberated with Ahab and relied on his judgment.

### Part 3
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the verse written with regard to Elijah <b>supports</b> the opinion of Rav Anan. The verse states: <b>“And the ravens [<i>orevim</i>] brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening”</b> (I Kings 17:6); <b>and Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> They would bring the meat <b>from the slaughterhouse of Ahab.</b> Clearly, Elijah would not have eaten the meat if Ahab’s slaughter was not valid. The Gemara responds: Since he ate the meat <b>according to the word</b> of God, the case of Elijah <b>is different,</b> and no proof may be cited from there.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>orevim</i></b> in this context? <b>Ravina said:</b> They were <b>actual ravens. Rav Adda bar Minyumi said to him: And perhaps</b> they were <b>two men whose names were Oreb? Isn’t it written: “And they slew Oreb at the Rock of Oreb, and Zeeb</b> they slew at the winepress of Zeeb” (Judges 7:25), indicating that Oreb is a person’s name? Ravina <b>said to him:</b> Did <b>the matter</b> just so <b>happen that the names of both of</b> the people supplying Elijah with food <b>were Oreb?</b> The improbability of this occurrence indicates that they were actual ravens.

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>And perhaps</b> they are called <i>orevim</i> <b>after the name of their place</b> of origin. <b>Isn’t it written: “And the Arameans had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a minor young woman [<i>na’ara ketana</i>]”</b> (II Kings 5:2)? <b>And</b> it is <b>difficult for us</b> to understand why the verse <b>calls her a young woman and</b> also <b>calls her a minor,</b> which are two different stages in a girl’s development. <b>And Rabbi Pedat said:</b> She was <b>a minor girl who was from</b> a place called <b>Naaran.</b> Perhaps in the case of Elijah they were two people from a place called Oreb. The Gemara rejects that suggestion: <b>If so, Orebites [<i>oreviyyim</i>] should have</b> been written in the verse.

### Part 6
§ <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of Rav Anan, who says that it is permitted to eat from the slaughter of a Jew who is a transgressor with regard to idol worship: <b>Everyone slaughters, and even a Samaritan, and even an uncircumcised</b> man, <b>and even a Jewish transgressor.</b> The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This uncircumcised</b> man, <b>what are the circumstances? If we say</b> that he is an uncircumcised man <b>whose brothers died due to circumcision</b> and the concern is that he might suffer a similar fate, clearly one may eat from what he slaughters, as <b>he is a full-fledged Jew</b> and not a transgressor at all. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that he is <b>a transgressor with regard to</b> remaining <b>uncircumcised,</b> as he refuses to be circumcised.

### Part 7
<b>Say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And even a Jewish transgressor. What are the circumstances? If he is a transgressor with regard to one matter, that is</b> identical to the case of <b>a transgressor with regard to</b> remaining <b>uncircumcised. Rather, is it not</b> that he is <b>a transgressor with regard to idol worship, and</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Anan?</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>No, actually I will say to you</b> that <b>a transgressor with regard to idol worship</b> may <b>not</b> slaughter, <b>as the Master said: Idol worship is a severe</b> transgression, <b>as</b> with regard to <b>anyone who denies it,</b> it is <b>as</b> though <b>he acknowledges</b> his acceptance of <b>the entire Torah.</b> Conversely, with regard to one who accepts idolatry, it is as though he denies the entire Torah. Therefore, his halakhic status is that of a transgressor with regard to the entire Torah, and his slaughter is not valid.

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> the transgressor in the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>a transgressor concerning the same matter</b> of eating unslaughtered carcasses, <b>and</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava,</b> who said that one may rely on the slaughter of a transgressor with regard to eating unslaughtered animal carcasses to satisfy his appetite even <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 10
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Anan from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “When any man of you brings an offering unto the Lord, from the animal” (Leviticus 1:2). The <i>tanna</i> infers: <b>“Of you,”</b> indicating: <b>But not all of you.</b> This serves <b>to exclude the transgressor,</b> from whom an offering is not accepted. The <i>tanna</i> continues: The term <b>“of you”</b> is also interpreted to mean that <b>I distinguished among you and not among the nations.</b> Therefore, a gentile may bring an offering even if he is an idol worshipper. The expression <b>“from the animal”</b> serves <b>to include people who are similar to an animal</b> in that they do not recognize God. <b>From here,</b> the Sages <b>stated: One accepts offerings from Jewish transgressors so that they will consequently repent, except for the transgressor, one who pours wine as a libation</b> to idolatry, <b>and one who desecrates Shabbat in public [<i>befarhesya</i>].</b>

### Part 11
<b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult.</b> Initially, <b>you said: “Of you,”</b> indicating: <b>But not all of you.</b> This serves <b>to exclude the transgressor,</b> from whom an offering is not accepted. <b>And then</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: One accepts offerings from Jewish transgressors.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult. The first clause</b> states that an offering is not accepted from <b>a transgressor with regard to the entire Torah. The middle clause</b> states that one accepts an offering from <b>a transgressor with regard to one matter.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara challenges: <b>Say the last clause: Except for the transgressor, and one who pours wine as a libation</b> to idolatry, <b>and one who desecrates Shabbat in public.</b> With regard to <b>this transgressor</b> in the last clause, <b>what are the circumstances? If</b> the reference is to <b>a transgressor with regard to the entire Torah, that is</b> identical to <b>the first clause:</b> Of you, and not all of you, to exclude the transgressor. <b>And if</b> the reference is to <b>a transgressor with regard to one matter, the middle clause</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as it is stated there that one accepts an offering from a transgressor with regard to one matter.

### Part 14
<b>Rather, is it not</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying</b> in the last clause: <b>Except for the transgressor to pour wine as a libation</b> to idolatry <b>or to desecrate Shabbat in public? Apparently, a transgressor with regard to idol worship is a transgressor with regard to the entire Torah, and</b> this <i>baraita</i> is <b>a refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Anan.</b> The Gemara concludes: It is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And is this</b> <i>halakha</i> that one does not accept an offering from a transgressor <b>derived from</b> the verse cited <b>here? It is derived from</b> the verse written <b>there</b> with regard to a sin offering:
