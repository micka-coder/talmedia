### Part 1
<b>In any case,</b> the statement of Ze’eiri remains <b>difficult.</b> What is the significance of pinching a dead bird? <b>Rava said: Say</b> in explanation: <b>And likewise he does</b> when he pinches, <b>he cuts</b> the spinal <b>column and</b> the <b>neck bone without a majority of</b> the surrounding <b>flesh</b> and then he pinches the <i>simanim</i>.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabbi Zeira ascended</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rabbi Ami sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i></b> that Ze’eiri said, and Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: And does one stand and pinch a dead</b> bird? Rabbi Ami <b>was astonished [<i>eshtomam</i>] for a moment</b> (see Daniel 4:16), and thought about it and <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ami: <b>Say</b> that <b>this is what he does: He cuts</b> the spinal <b>column and</b> the <b>neck bone without a majority of</b> the surrounding <b>flesh.</b>

### Part 3
<b>That is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How does one pinch</b> the nape of <b>a bird sin offering? He cuts</b> the spinal <b>column and</b> the <b>neck bone without a majority of</b> the surrounding <b>flesh until he reaches the gullet or the windpipe.</b> Once <b>he has reached the gullet or the windpipe, he cuts one <i>siman</i> or its majority and a majority of</b> the surrounding <b>flesh with it; and in a burnt offering</b> he cuts <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>or the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> whose opinion is cited in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If</b> you say it is <b>the Rabbis, don’t they say</b> that one must cut <b>specifically two</b> <i>simanim</i> and not their majority? <b>If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, doesn’t he say</b> that one must cut only <b>a majority of</b> the <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i> and no more, in which case why does the <i>baraita</i> specify two <i>simanim</i> or the majority of two <i>simanim</i>?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that when the <i>baraita</i> says <b>two,</b> it is according <b>to the Rabbis;</b> when it says <b>a majority of two,</b> it is according <b>to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon. And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Both this,</b> two, <b>and that,</b> a majority of two, are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, and what</b> is the meaning of <b>two?</b> It does not mean two <i>simanim</i> in their entirety; rather, it means that one must cut a significant majority of the <i>simanim</i> <b>that is similar to two</b> entire <i>simanim</i>.

### Part 6
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If the <b>neck bone</b> of a person <b>was broken and a majority of</b> the surrounding <b>flesh with it</b> was cut, that person <b>imparts impurity in a tent,</b> i.e., if one is beneath the same roof with him he becomes impure, as his halakhic status is that of a corpse even though he is still twitching.

### Part 7
<b>And if you say that</b> the <b>incident</b> of the death <b>of Eli,</b> the High Priest, whose death is described: “And his neck bone broke, and he died” (I Samuel 4:18), <b>was</b> one where the <b>neck bone</b> broke <b>without the majority of</b> the surrounding <b>flesh</b> being cut, and nevertheless he died immediately, the Gemara responds: <b>Old age is different, as it is written: “And it came to pass, when he made mention of the Ark of God, that he fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died; for he was an old man, and heavy;</b> and he had judged Israel forty years” (I Samuel 4:18).

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If <b>one ripped</b> a person <b>like</b> one cuts <b>a fish,</b> lengthwise, the halakhic status of the ripped person is that of a corpse even though he is still convulsing, and he <b>imparts impurity in a tent. Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak says: And</b> that is specifically if he was ripped <b>from his back.</b>

### Part 9
§ The Gemara resumes discussions of the <i>halakhot</i> of an animal. <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>one rendered</b> the animal like <b>a shard [<i>gistera</i>]</b> by cutting it in two widthwise, its halakhic status is that of <b>an unslaughtered carcass</b> even though it is still convulsing. <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> If <b>the thigh,</b> the hind leg of the animal, <b>was removed and its recess is obvious,</b> it is <b>an unslaughtered carcass</b> and it imparts impurity even if it remains alive. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances of its recess</b> being <b>obvious? Rava said:</b> It is <b>any</b> situation <b>where</b> the animal <b>is collapsed and</b> even so its hind leg <b>is visibly lacking.</b>

### Part 10
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Oholot</i> 1:6) with regard to creeping animals whose carcasses are ritually impure: <b>If their heads were removed, even if they are convulsing, they are impure like the tail of a lizard</b> that was severed <b>that convulses</b> even though it is not alive.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>Were removed? Reish Lakish said:</b> They were <b>actually removed. Rabbi Asi</b> said that <b>Rabbi Mani said:</b> It is <b>like the separation of</b> the head of <b>the bird burnt offering.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Asi:</b> Do you mean <b>like the separation of</b> the head of <b>the bird burnt offering</b> according <b>to the Rabbis,</b> who hold that in addition to the neck bone and the surrounding flesh, one also completely severs the <i>simanim</i>, <b>and</b> then <b>you</b> and Reish Lakish <b>do not disagree,</b> as it is just like breaking the neck of the animal, since nothing remains other than the skin? <b>Or perhaps</b> you mean <b>like the separation of</b> the head of <b>the bird burnt offering</b> according <b>to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who says that one cuts the majority of two <i>simanim</i>, <b>and you</b> and Reish Lakish <b>disagree,</b> as Reish Lakish holds that the animal imparts impurity only when it is completely beheaded.

### Part 13
Rabbi Asi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: I mean <b>like the separation of</b> the head of <b>the bird burnt offering</b> according <b>to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who says that one cuts the majority of two <i>simanim</i>, <b>and we disagree.</b>

### Part 14
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> They were <b>actually removed. Rabbi Asi</b> said that <b>Rabbi Mani said:</b> It is <b>like the separation of</b> the head of <b>the bird burnt offering</b> according <b>to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that one suffices <b>with</b> cutting <b>a majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>.

### Part 15
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and what</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The dispute is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a sliding-scale offering, in which a poor person who cannot afford an animal sin offering brings two doves or two pigeons, one as a sin offering and one as a burnt offering, it is written: <b>“And he shall prepare the second as a burnt offering, according to the ordinance”</b> (Leviticus 5:10), which means <b>according to the ordinance of an animal sin offering</b> in whose stead the offering was brought.

### Part 16
<b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>according to the ordinance of an animal sin offering, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only according to the ordinance of a bird sin offering?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When it says</b> with regard to the bird burnt offering brought as a gift offering: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall bring it</b> to the altar” (Leviticus 1:15), meaning that it shall be sacrificed in a unique manner, <b>the verse distinguished between a bird sin offering and a bird burnt offering. And</b> if so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the term <b>“according to the ordinance”?</b> It means <b>according to the ordinance of an animal sin offering; just as an animal sin offering comes only</b>
