<b>deceptively,</b> i.e., he only pretended to kill the son. The father <b>fainted and went limp.</b> By this movement, <b>his intestines entered</b> his stomach, and the Roman <b>sewed up his stomach,</b> and he recovered.

### Part 2
§ The mishna states: If <b>its legs were broken,</b> the bird remains kosher. The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain basket of birds</b> with broken legs <b>that came before Rava. Rava inspected</b> each bird <b>at the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh, <b>and</b> when he found that all its sinews were intact, <b>he deemed it kosher.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: A dislocated foreleg in an animal is kosher. A dislocated femur in an animal</b> renders it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. A dislocated femur in a bird</b> renders it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. A dislocated wing in a bird</b> renders it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> because <b>we</b> must be <b>concerned</b> that <b>perhaps the lung was perforated.</b> The lung is located near the wing’s attachment to the body, and part of the lung may have been torn out with the wing. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> The lung <b>should be inspected,</b> and if no damage is found, the bird is kosher. <b>And so says Rabbi Yoḥanan: It should be inspected.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Ḥizkiyya,</b> son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, <b>says: A bird has no lungs. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> A bird <b>does have</b> lungs, <b>and they are like a rose petal</b> in appearance, thin and red, <b>between the wings.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does Ḥizkiyya mean when he says that <b>a bird has no lungs? If we say that it has no</b> lungs <b>at all,</b> that is problematic, as <b>don’t we see that it does have</b> lungs? <b>Rather,</b> say that he means <b>that</b> the bird <b>is not rendered a <i>tereifa</i> by them</b> if they are perforated. But this, too, is problematic, as <b>doesn’t Levi teach:</b> Those <b><i>tereifot</i> that the Sages enumerated in an animal</b> hold <b>likewise in a bird,</b> and <b>in addition to those, a bird</b> is a <i>tereifa</i> if <b>the bone</b> of the skull <b>was broken, even if the membrane of the brain was not perforated?</b> If so, a perforated lung in a bird, as in an animal, renders it a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 5
<b>Rather,</b> say that Ḥizkiyya means that a bird’s lung <b>has no</b> <i>halakha</i> of <b>falling and no</b> <i>halakha</i> of <b>singeing.</b> If a bird falls, one need not inspect the lungs for damage as he must other organs (see 51b), and if it falls in a fire, one need not inspect the lungs for a change in color as he must other organs (see 56b). <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rav Ḥana said: Since a majority of</b> the bird’s <b>ribs protect</b> the lungs, one need not be concerned that the lung was damaged.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> in response: A bird <b>does have</b> lungs, <b>and they are like a rose petal between the wings, by inference</b> one must conclude <b>that Ḥizkiyya maintains that it has no</b> lungs at all. <b>Rather,</b> one must say as <b>they say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina: From the statement of the Distinguished,</b> i.e., Ḥizkiyya, <b>it is apparent that he is unfamiliar with chickens.</b>

### Part 7
§ <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: A dislocated femur in a bird is kosher. Rabba bar Rav Huna said to Rav Huna: But the Rabbis that came from Pumbedita said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says in the name of Rav: A dislocated femur in a bird</b> renders it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: My son, each river and its course,</b> i.e., different communities observe different customs. Although Rav himself held that such a bird is kosher, he ruled for those living in Pumbedita that such a bird is a <i>tereifa</i>, in accordance with their own custom.

### Part 8
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rabbi Abba went</b> and <b>found Rav Yirmeya bar Abba inspecting</b> birds <b>at the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh. Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: Why</b> must <b>Master</b> do <b>all this? But doesn’t Rav Huna say</b> that <b>Rav</b> says: <b>A dislocated femur in a bird is kosher?</b> If a bird is kosher even when the whole thigh has been removed, all the more so it should be kosher when only the convergence of sinews has been removed. Rav Yirmeya bar Abba <b>said to him: I know the mishna</b> (76a): With regard to <b>an animal whose hind legs were severed,</b> if they were severed <b>from the leg joint and below,</b> it is <b>kosher; from the leg joint and above,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i> and <b>unfit</b> for consumption. <b>And likewise</b> an animal whose <b>convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh <b>was removed</b> is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And Rav said about this: And likewise with regard to a bird.</b>

### Part 9
Rabbi Abba responded: <b>If so,</b> this statement <b>of Rav,</b> that a bird whose convergence of sinews was removed is a <i>tereifa</i>, poses <b>a difficulty for</b> that statement <b>of Rav,</b> that a bird with a dislocated femur is kosher. Rav Yirmeya bar Abba <b>was silent</b> and did not respond. Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: Perhaps there is a difference for</b> Rav <b>between a dislocated</b> femur <b>and a severed</b> femur, and while the former does not render a bird a <i>tereifa</i>, the latter does. Rav Yirmeya bar Abba <b>said to him: And are you interpreting Rav’s <i>halakhot</i></b> based on your own reasoning? <b>Rav said explicitly: A dislocated</b> femur <b>is kosher,</b> while <b>a severed</b> femur renders the animal <b>unfit</b> for consumption. <b>And do not be confounded</b> by this distinction, <b>as</b> one <b>cuts</b> an animal <b>from here,</b> in one place, <b>and it dies,</b> but one <b>cuts it from there,</b> in another place, <b>and it lives.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara recounts: <b>When Rabbi Abba went up</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rabbi Zeira sitting and saying: Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said</b> that <b>a dislocated femur in a bird</b> renders it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> Rabbi Abba <b>said to him:</b> By <b>Master’s life, since the day that Master came up to here,</b> Eretz Yisrael,
