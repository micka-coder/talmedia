### Part 1
But the bird called the <b>little wine pourer is permitted. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the idiom of the Sages: <b>The power of the son is greater than the power of the father,</b> i.e., the larger is forbidden while the smaller is permitted.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> There are several types of <b><i>shekitena</i>.</b> The <b>long-shanked red</b> ones are <b>permitted. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the <b><i>murzema</i></b> bird, which is similar in appearance and known to be kosher. The <b>little red</b> ones are <b>forbidden, and your mnemonic</b> for this is the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a dwarf</b> priest is <b>unfit</b> for Temple service. The <b>long-shanked green,</b> i.e., yellow, ones are <b>forbidden, and your mnemonic</b> for this is the mishna (56a): Innards that have turned <b>green</b> render an animal a <i>tereifa</i> and <b>unfit</b> for consumption.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> As for the <b><i>shalakh</i>,</b> listed as a non-kosher bird (see Leviticus 11:17), <b>this is</b> the bird <b>that scoops [<i>sholeh</i>] fish out of the sea.</b> The <b><i>dukhifat</i></b> (see Leviticus 11:19) is the bird <b>whose comb</b> seems <b>bent [<i>hodo kafut</i>]</b> due to its thickness. The Gemara notes: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b><i>dukhifat</i></b> is the bird <b>whose comb</b> seems <b>bent, and this is</b> the bird <b>that brought the <i>shamir</i> to the Temple.</b> As recounted in tractate <i>Gittin</i> (68b), King Solomon required a unique worm called the <i>shamir</i> to carve stones of the Temple, as the verse states: “There was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building” (I Kings 6:7).

### Part 4
The Gemara recounts: <b>When Rabbi Yoḥanan would see a <i>shalakh</i>, he</b> would <b>say: “Your judgments are like the great deep”</b> (Psalms 36:7), as God exacts retribution even upon the fish in the sea. <b>When he would see an ant, he</b> would <b>say</b> the first half of the same verse: <b>“Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains,”</b> as God provides sustenance for the tiny ant just as He does for the largest creatures.

### Part 5
<b>Ameimar says:</b> The <b><i>laknei</i> and <i>batnei</i></b> birds are <b>permitted.</b> As for the <b><i>sakna’ei</i> and <i>batna’ei</i></b> birds, in any <b>place that it is customary to eat</b> them, <b>one may eat</b> them; in any <b>place that it is customary not to eat</b> them, <b>one may not eat</b> them. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that the matter</b> of whether it is permitted <b>depends on custom?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Yes, but</b> it is <b>not difficult: This</b> place where they are forbidden is <b>a place where the <i>peres</i> and <i>ozniyya</i> are found.</b> Since they are similar to these birds, one must be concerned that people will confuse them, even though the <i>sakna’ei</i> and <i>batna’ei</i> are themselves kosher. <b>That</b> place where they are permitted is <b>a place where the <i>peres</i> and <i>ozniyya</i> are not found.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Abaye says:</b> The birds called <b><i>kevai</i> and <i>kakvai</i> are forbidden,</b> but the <b><i>kakvata</i> is permitted.</b> Still, <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they flog</b> one who eats it <b>on its</b> account, <b>and they call it <i>taḥveta</i>.</b>

### Part 7
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b><i>tinshemet</i>,</b> listed in the Torah as non-kosher (see Leviticus 11:18), is the <b><i>ba’ut</i> among birds.</b> One might ask: <b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>the <i>ba’ut</i> among birds, or is it only the <i>ba’ut</i> among creeping animals?</b> The <i>tinshemet</i> is also listed among the creeping animals (see Leviticus 11:30). <b>Say: Go out and learn from the thirteen hermeneutical principles,</b> of which one is: <b>A matter derived from its context. What are the</b> adjacent <b>verses speaking about?</b> They are speaking <b>about birds. So too here,</b> the word <i>tinshemet</i> is referring <b>to birds.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara notes: <b>It is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in this way with regard to</b> the <i>tinshemet</i> listed among the <b>creeping animals:</b> The <b><i>tinshemet</i></b> here is the <b><i>ba’ut</i> among creeping animals.</b> One might ask: <b>Do you say</b> that it is the <b><i>ba’ut</i> among creeping animals, or it is only</b> the <b><i>ba’ut</i> among birds? Say: Go out and learn from the thirteen hermeneutical principles,</b> of which one is: <b>A matter derived from its context. What are the</b> adjacent <b>verses speaking about?</b> They are speaking <b>about creeping animals. So too here,</b> the word <i>tinshemet</i> is referring <b>to creeping animals.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Abaye says:</b> The <b><i>ba’ut</i> among birds</b> is commonly called the <b><i>kifof</i>.</b> The <b><i>ba’ut</i> among creeping animals</b> is commonly called the <b><i>kurpedai</i>. Rav Yehuda says:</b> As for the <b><i>ka’at</i></b> listed in the Torah as non-kosher (see Leviticus 11:18), <b>this is the</b> bird called <b>a <i>kuk</i>.</b> As for the <b><i>raḥam</i>, this is</b> the <b><i>sherakrak</i>.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Why is it called the <i>raḥam</i>?</b> Because <b>when the <i>raḥam</i> comes</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>mercy [<i>raḥamim</i>] comes to the world,</b> as it appears at the beginning of the rainy season. <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye said: And it is</b> a sign of rain only <b>when it sits on something and makes a <i>sherakrak</i></b> sound. And it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that if it sits on the ground and hisses [<i>veshareik</i>],</b> this is a sign that <b>the Messiah is coming, as it is stated: “I will hiss [<i>eshreka</i>] for them, and gather them”</b> (Zechariah 10:8).

### Part 11
<b>Rav Adda bar Shimi said to Mar bar Rav Idai: But</b> wasn’t there <b>a certain</b> <i>raḥam</i> <b>that sat on a plowed field and hissed, and a stone came and broke its head?</b> Mar bar Rav Idai <b>said to him: That</b> <i>raḥam</i> <b>was a liar</b> and was punished for prophesying falsely.

### Part 12
With regard to the verse: “Every <i>orev</i> after its kinds” (Leviticus 11:15), <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: As for the <b><i>orev</i>, this is the crow.</b> When the verse states: <b>“Every <i>orev</i>,”</b> this serves <b>to include the valley crow</b> as non-kosher. And the verse states: <b>“After its kinds,” to include the crow that comes at the heads of pigeons.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara explains: <b>The Master said:</b> As for the <b><i>orev</i>, this is the crow. Is that to say</b> that the particular crow <b>stands before us,</b> such that one immediately knows which one it is? <b>Rather, say:</b> As for the <b><i>orev</i>, this is the black crow, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “His locks are curled, and black as a crow”</b> (Song of Songs 5:11). The Gemara continues to explain the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The valley</b> crow <b>[<i>ha’amaki</i>]</b> is the <b>white</b> crow. <b>And so</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to leprosy: <b>“If the appearance thereof be deeper [<i>amok</i>] than the skin”</b> (Leviticus 13:30), and the Sages explained: <b>As the appearance of</b> an area lit by the <b>sun, which</b> seems <b>deeper than the shade,</b> which appears to cover it. There is therefore an association between a valley and the color white.

### Part 14
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>the crow that comes at the heads of pigeons, Rav Pappa said: Do not say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means <b>that it comes at the head of pigeons,</b> i.e., it dwells with them; <b>rather,</b> it means that this crow’s <b>head resembles that of a pigeon.</b>

### Part 15
With regard to the verse: “And the <i>netz</i> after its kinds” (Leviticus 11:16), <b>the Sages taught:</b> As for <b>the <i>netz</i>, this is the hawk.</b> The verse states: <b>“After its kinds,” to include</b> the bird called <b><i>bar ḥireya</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the <i>bar ḥireya</i>? Abaye said:</b> It is the bird commonly called the <b><i>shurineka</i>.</b>

### Part 16
With regard to the verse: “And the <i>ḥasida</i>, and the <i>anafa</i> after its kinds” (Leviticus 11:19), <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> As for <b>the <i>ḥasida</i>, this is the white <i>dayya</i>. And why is it called <i>ḥasida</i>? Since it performs charity [<i>ḥasidut</i>] for its fellows,</b> giving them from its own food. As for <b>the <i>anafa</i>, this is the irritable <i>dayya</i>. And why is it called <i>anafa</i>? Since it quarrels [<i>mena’efet</i>] with its fellows.</b>

### Part 17
§ <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥanan, son of Rava, says</b> that <b>Rav says: There are twenty-four non-kosher birds. Rav Ḥanan bar Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Ḥisda,</b> his father: <b>From where</b> in the Torah is this number obtained? <b>If</b> you are referring to the list <b>of Leviticus</b> (11:13–19), <b>there are</b> only <b>twenty</b> birds listed there. <b>If</b> you are referring to the list <b>of Deuteronomy</b> (14:12–18), <b>there are</b> only <b>twenty-one</b> there. <b>And if you would say: Add</b> the <b><i>da’a</i>, which is written in Leviticus but is not written in Deuteronomy, to</b> the others in Deuteronomy, <b>still there are</b> only <b>twenty-two.</b>

### Part 18
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: This</b> is what <b>your mother’s father,</b> Rav Ḥanan, son of Rava, <b>said in the name of Rav:</b> The phrases <b>“after its kinds,” “after its kinds,” “after its kinds,”</b> and <b>“after its kinds,”</b> that appear in each list indicate additional cases. <b>Here,</b> then, <b>are four</b> more. The Gemara objects: <b>If so, there are twenty-six,</b> not twenty-four. <b>Abaye said:</b> The <b><i>da’a</i></b> mentioned in Leviticus <b>and</b> the <b><i>ra’a</i></b> mentioned in Deuteronomy <b>are one</b> bird. <b>As, if it enters your mind that they are two</b> different birds,
