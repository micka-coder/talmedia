### Part 1
The Gemara responds: <b>Rather,</b> if one counts this way, one must say that <b>these two</b> cases that <b>you removed,</b> i.e., an animal whose hind legs were severed and one whose hide was removed, <b>do not remove.</b> The count will then remain eighteen.

### Part 2
§ <b>Ulla says: Eight types of <i>tereifot</i> were stated to Moses at Sinai,</b> and all the cases mentioned in the Mishna and elsewhere fall into these categories: An animal whose organ was <b>perforated or severed, removed or missing</b> a piece, one that was <b>torn or clawed</b> by wild animals, or that <b>fell or</b> was <b>broken.</b> The Gemara notes: This list is compiled <b>to the exclusion of a diseased</b> organ, <b>which Rakhish bar Pappa</b> mentioned with regard to a kidney. Ulla does not deem this a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 3
<b>Ḥiyya bar Rava says: There are eight <i>tereifot</i> in</b> the category of <b>a perforated</b> organ: A perforated gullet, brain membrane, heart, lung, abomasum, intestine, inner rumen, and reticulum or omasum that was perforated to the outside. <b>If you say</b> that there are <b>nine,</b> because a perforated gallbladder is also mentioned in the mishna, one can say that with regard to the <b>gallbladder,</b> only <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, teaches it,</b> and it is the opinion of an individual. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>the abomasum was perforated,</b> or <b>the intestines were perforated,</b> it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: Even</b> if <b>the gallbladder was perforated</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 4
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the following statements of Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Yosef: <b><i>Halakhot</i>, friend, olive-bulk, gallbladder, and gizzard.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Yosef, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> disagrees with the statement of Ḥiyya bar Rava and <b>says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> that a perforated gallbladder renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 6
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Yosef, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What did the friends of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, respond to him?</b> They responded that Job said: <b>“He pours out my gall upon the ground”</b> (Job 16:13), <b>and</b> yet <b>Job</b> was <b>still alive.</b> Evidently, one with a perforated gallbladder can live. Rabbi Yosei <b>said to them:</b> Job was kept alive by a miracle, and <b>one does not mention miraculous acts</b> as proof for a general ruling. <b>As, if you do not say so,</b> then the other phrase in the verse: <b>“He cleaves my kidneys asunder, and does not spare,”</b> is problematic. <b>Does</b> one with cleaved kidneys <b>live? Rather, a miracle is different, as it is written</b> that God said to Satan with regard to Job: <b>“Only spare his life”</b> (Job 2:6). Under natural circumstances, Job should have died from his injuries, but in this case he was kept alive by a miracle. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to the gallbladder, one must say that <b>a miracle is different,</b> and one cannot bring proof from it.

### Part 7
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Yosef, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of the one who says</b> that if the liver of an animal was removed but one <b>olive-bulk</b> of it remains, it is kosher.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> really <b>say this? But doesn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is always <b>in accordance with an unattributed mishna; and we learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>the liver was removed and nothing remained of it,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>? One can infer that if any of it <b>remained,</b> the animal is <b>kosher even if</b> what remains <b>does not</b> constitute <b>an olive-bulk.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>They are <i>amora’im</i>, and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> as to whether he holds that the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with an unattributed mishna.

### Part 9
The Gemara brings another statement <b>that Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Yosef, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If the <b>gallbladder was perforated</b> in a place where it was adjacent to the liver, <b>and the liver seals</b> the hole, the animal is <b>kosher,</b> even though a perforated gallbladder normally renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> according to Rabbi Yoḥanan.

### Part 10
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Yosef, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Even though the mishna on 56a teaches that if a bird’s gizzard was perforated it is a <i>tereifa</i>, if <b>the gizzard was perforated but its</b> inner <b>lining is intact,</b> the bird is <b>kosher.</b>

### Part 11
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>the</b> inner <b>lining</b> of the gizzard <b>was perforated, but</b> the flesh of <b>the gizzard is intact, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from that <b>which Rav Naḥman said</b> with regard to a perforated gullet: If both its outer and inner lining were perforated, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, but if <b>this</b> lining <b>was perforated without that</b> lining being perforated, it is <b>kosher.</b> Similarly, <b>Rava says: The gullet has two linings,</b> the <b>outer red, and</b> the <b>inner white.</b> If <b>this</b> lining <b>was perforated without that</b> lining being perforated, the animal is <b>kosher.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need for Rava <b>to state</b> that the <b>outer</b> one is <b>red and</b> the <b>inner</b> one is <b>white?</b> Isn’t this self-evident? The Gemara responds: This teaches <b>that if</b> the two were <b>switched,</b> i.e., the outer lining turned white and the inner red, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 12
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>both</b> linings <b>were perforated,</b> but <b>not adjacent to one another, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Mar Zutra says in the name of Rav Pappa:</b> If this occurred <b>in the gullet,</b> the animal is <b>kosher;</b> but if it occurred <b>in the gizzard,</b> it is <b>unfit</b> for consumption. <b>Rav Ashi objects to this: On the contrary, the gullet, with which</b> the animal <b>eats and calls, is spacious</b> and flexible, and the animal <b>constricts it and stretches it.</b> Since the two linings are not connected to each other, <b>there are times</b> in the course of their movement <b>that</b> the two holes <b>align [<i>demihandezin</i>] with one another,</b> creating a fully aligned perforation. But the <b>gizzard, which is</b> always <b>at rest</b> in place, <b>stands as it</b> always <b>stands.</b> Accordingly, two such perforations will never align. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Yosef, said to Rav Ashi: So we say in the name of Mar Zutra, that</b> he in fact <b>said in the name of Rav Pappa in accordance with your</b> objection.

### Part 13
§ <b>And Rabba says: A membrane that appeared due to a wound in the gullet,</b> i.e., a scab that covered a perforation, <b>is not</b> considered <b>a membrane</b> that prevents the animal from being rendered a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And Rabba says:</b> The <b>gullet cannot be inspected from outside</b> to determine whether the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, since the outer lining itself is red, and therefore reddening due to injury cannot be discerned in it. <b>Rather,</b> it must be inspected <b>from inside,</b> where the lining is white. The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is</b> there as a result of this statement, i.e., in what case must the gullet be checked from the inside?
