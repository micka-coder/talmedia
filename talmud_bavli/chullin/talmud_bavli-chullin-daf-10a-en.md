### Part 1
It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is</b> the typical <b>manner of creeping animals to expose</b> the contents of a vessel so that they may drink. Therefore, the exposure of the water is attributed to a creeping animal or to a ritually pure person. By contrast, in a case where he left the vessel exposed and found it covered, the concern is that it was an impure man who covered it, since <b>it is not</b> the typical <b>manner of</b> creeping animals <b>to cover</b> exposed vessels. Evidently, with regard to prohibition or ritual impurity, there are circumstances of uncertainty when the ruling is lenient.

### Part 2
<b>Alternatively,</b> it can be inferred from the <i>baraita</i> that <b>the reason</b> the contents of the vessel are impure or disqualified, respectively, is <b>that he left it exposed and came</b> back <b>and found it covered</b> or that he left it <b>covered and came</b> back <b>and found it exposed. But</b> if <b>he found</b> the vessel just <b>as he left it, there is neither impurity nor disqualification.</b>

### Part 3
<b>But</b> in a situation of <b>uncertainty</b> where he left <b>exposed water</b> and then came and found the vessel exposed, the water is <b>forbidden</b> under all circumstances. <b>Learn from it</b> that <b>danger is more severe than prohibition.</b> The Gemara affirms: Indeed, <b>learn from it.</b>

### Part 4
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Terumot</i> 8:4): <b>Three liquids are forbidden due to exposure: Water, wine, and milk. How long shall they remain</b> exposed <b>and</b> their contents <b>will be forbidden?</b> It is a period <b>equivalent</b> to the time necessary so <b>that a snake could emerge from a proximate place and drink. And how</b> far away is considered <b>a proximate place? Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, said:</b> Even a period <b>equivalent</b> to the time necessary <b>so that</b> a snake <b>could emerge from beneath the handle of the vessel and drink.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: If it is only the time necessary for the snake to emerge and <b>drink, doesn’t one see</b> the snake drink, in which case there is no uncertainty? <b>Rather,</b> it is a period equivalent to the time necessary for a snake to emerge from a proximate place, <b>drink, and return to its hole.</b> If one left exposed liquid unattended for that interval, it is possible that the snake drank the liquid unseen by the owner of the liquid.

### Part 6
§ <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>with a knife that was</b> afterward <b>found</b> to be <b>notched, Rav Huna says: Even</b> if, after the slaughter and before the knife was examined, <b>he broke bones with</b> the knife <b>all day,</b> the slaughter is <b>not valid,</b> as <b>we are concerned that perhaps</b> the knife <b>became notched on the hide</b> of the neck. <b>And Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The slaughter is <b>valid,</b> as <b>perhaps</b> it was <b>on the bone</b> that he broke with the knife after the slaughter that <b>it became notched.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, Rav Huna</b> stated his opinion <b>in accordance with his <i>halakha</i></b> cited earlier (9a): An animal during its lifetime exists with the presumptive status of prohibition until it becomes known in what manner it was slaughtered. <b>But</b> as for <b>Rav Ḥisda, what is the reason</b> for his ruling that the slaughter is valid? The Gemara answers that Rav Ḥisda could have <b>said to you: A bone certainly notches</b> the knife, but with regard to <b>hide,</b> it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it <b>notches</b> the knife and <b>uncertain</b> whether it <b>does not notch</b> it. This <b>is</b> a case of <b>certainty and uncertainty, and</b> the principle is that <b>an uncertainty does not override a certainty.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rava raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda <b>to support</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna,</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one immersed and emerged</b> from the ritual bath <b>and an interposing item was</b> later <b>found on him,</b> then <b>even if he had been engaged in</b> handling <b>that same type</b> of item for <b>the entire day</b> after his immersion, <b>the immersion does not fulfill his</b> obligation. This is so <b>until he will say:</b> It is <b>clear to me that</b> this interposition <b>was not on me beforehand. And here</b> it is a case <b>where he certainly immersed,</b> and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether the interposition <b>was on him</b> at that time and <b>uncertain</b> whether it <b>was not on him, and</b> nevertheless, contrary to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda, the <b>uncertainty overrides</b> the <b>certainty.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara rejects that proof: It <b>is different there, as it can be said: Establish</b> the status of <b>the impure</b> person <b>on</b> the basis of <b>his presumptive status</b> of impurity, <b>and say</b> that <b>he did not immerse</b> properly.

### Part 10
The Gemara challenges: <b>Here too, establish</b> the status of <b>the animal on</b> the basis of <b>its presumptive status</b> of prohibition <b>and say</b> that <b>it was not slaughtered</b> properly. Why does Rav Ḥisda rule that it is permitted? The Gemara explains: That status has been undermined, as the <b>slaughtered</b> animal <b>is before you.</b> There is no indication that the slaughter was not valid, and most slaughtered animals are slaughtered properly.

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges: <b>Here too,</b> in the case of immersion, the status of impurity is undermined, as the person who <b>has immersed</b> is <b>before you.</b> The Gemara explains: The case of immersion is different, as <b>a flaw developed in</b> the presumptive validity of the immersion, since there is an interposition.

### Part 12
The Gemara challenges: <b>Here too, a flaw developed in</b> the presumptive validity of slaughter, as the knife is notched. The Gemara explains: In the case of slaughter, <b>the knife became flawed,</b> but <b>the animal did not become flawed.</b> Therefore, the animal assumes the presumptive status of permissibility. By contrast, in the case of immersion, the interposition was found on the person, thereby nullifying his presumptive status of purity.

### Part 13
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda from a <i>baraita</i>: The slaughter of a bird is valid with the cutting of one <i>siman</i>, the windpipe or the gullet. Therefore, if <b>one cut the gullet, and the windpipe was displaced thereafter,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid.</b> If <b>the windpipe was displaced and one cut the gullet thereafter,</b> the slaughter is <b>not valid.</b>

### Part 14
If <b>one cut the gullet, and the windpipe was found displaced, and he does not know whether</b> the windpipe <b>was displaced before the slaughter</b> or <b>whether</b> it <b>was displaced after the slaughter; that was</b> the <b>incident</b> that came before the Sages, <b>and they said:</b> In <b>any</b> case of <b>uncertainty with regard to slaughter,</b> the slaughter is <b>not valid.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: With regard to the expansive formulation: With regard to <b>any</b> case of <b>uncertainty with regard to slaughter, what</b> does it serve <b>to add?</b> Does it <b>not</b> serve <b>to add a case like this</b> one where there is uncertainty whether the knife was notched before or after the slaughter? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it serves <b>to add</b> a case of <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>he interrupted</b> the slaughter in the middle, or <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>he pressed</b> the knife on the <i>simanim</i>. If he did either, it invalidates the slaughter.
