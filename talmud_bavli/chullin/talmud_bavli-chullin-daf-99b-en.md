### Part 1
Rav Dimi answered Abaye: <b>No,</b> the mishna means that although there is not one hundred and one times as much non-sacred food as <i>teruma</i>, the <i>teruma</i> is nullified because there is <b>one hundred</b> times its volume of non-sacred food.

### Part 2
Abaye responded: <b>But since the first clause</b> states that it is nullified <b>in one hundred</b> times its volume, it must <b>be</b> that <b>the latter clause</b> is referring to a case where there is <b>sixty</b> times its volume. <b>As</b> the mishna (<i>Orla</i> 2:6) <b>teaches in the first clause:</b> When it is stated that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to be stringent</b> if one <b>type</b> of <i>teruma</i> is mixed with non-sacred food of <b>its type, how</b> is this accomplished? For example, in a case of <b>leaven of</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>wheat that fell into dough</b> made of non-sacred <b>wheat, and there is enough</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>to cause</b> the non-sacred wheat <b>to become leavened, whether there is</b> enough non-sacred wheat <b>to neutralize</b> the <i>teruma</i> <b>in one hundred and one</b> times its volume, or <b>whether there is not</b> enough non-sacred wheat <b>to neutralize</b> the <i>teruma</i> <b>in one hundred and one</b> times its volume, the entire dough <b>is forbidden</b> to a non-priest.

### Part 3
But if <b>there is not</b> enough non-sacred wheat <b>to neutralize</b> the <i>teruma</i> <b>in one hundred and one</b> times its volume, then <b>whether there is</b> enough <i>teruma</i> <b>to cause</b> the non-sacred wheat <b>to become leavened</b> or <b>whether there is not</b> enough <i>teruma</i> <b>to cause</b> the non-sacred wheat <b>to become leavened,</b> the entire dough <b>is forbidden</b> to a non-priest. Would you suggest that both <b>the first clause and the latter clause</b> are stating that the <i>teruma</i> is nullified <b>in one hundred</b> times its volume?

### Part 4
Rav Dimi answered: <b>No. The first clause</b> is referring to a case where the <i>teruma</i> is mixed <b>with one hundred and one</b> times its volume of non-sacred food, <b>and the latter clause</b> is referring to a case where the <i>teruma</i> is mixed <b>with one hundred</b> times its volume of non-sacred food.

### Part 5
Abaye asked Rav Dimi: If so, <b>when</b> the mishna states that if <b>there is</b> enough <i>teruma</i> <b>to cause</b> the non-sacred wheat <b>to become leavened</b> the entire mixture is forbidden to non-priests, why is that the case? If leaven is mixed <b>with one hundred and one</b> times its volume of non-sacred wheat it will have no leavening effect, so <b>why is it not nullified?</b> Rav Dimi did not have an answer and <b>was silent.</b>

### Part 6
Abaye <b>said to him: Perhaps leaven is different, because its leavening</b> properties are <b>potent,</b> and there are some forms of leaven that can have an effect on such a large quantity of dough. Rav Dimi <b>said to him: You reminded me</b> of <b>a matter that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Not all the measures are equal, because the measure</b> required in order to nullify non-kosher fish <b>brine</b> is <b>close to two hundred</b> times its volume. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 10:8): <b>The brine</b> of <b>a non-kosher fish is forbidden. Rabbi Yehuda says: A quarter-</b><i>log</i> of non-kosher fish brine renders kosher food forbidden even if it is mixed <b>with two <i>se’a</i></b> of permitted food, which is one hundred ninety-two times as much as a quarter-<i>log</i>.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: How can Rabbi Yehuda say that fish brine is nullified at all? <b>Doesn’t Rabbi Yehuda say</b> that <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food of <b>its</b> own <b>type is not nullified?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Brine is different because it is merely sweat,</b> i.e., it does not have the halakhic status of the fish itself.

### Part 8
§ The mishna (96b) teaches: <b>How does one measure</b> whether there is enough sciatic nerve to impart flavor to the meat of the entire thigh? One relates to it as though the sciatic nerve were meat and the thigh were a turnip. If the meat would impart flavor to the turnip when they were cooked together, then the entire thigh is forbidden. The Gemara states that <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The mishna means that it is measured <b>like meat</b> cooked in a pot <b>with turnip heads.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> Sciatic <b>nerves do not impart flavor</b> at all.

### Part 9
There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who came before Rabbi Ḥanina</b> to ask about the status of a thigh of an animal that was cooked with its sciatic nerve, and <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Zevina was sitting at the gate. When</b> the man <b>left,</b> Rabbi Yehuda bar Zevina <b>said to him: What did</b> Rabbi Ḥanina <b>say to you?</b> The man <b>said to him: He permitted me</b> to eat the thigh.

### Part 10
Rabbi Yehuda bar Zevina <b>said to him: Bring</b> the animal <b>before him again;</b> perhaps he did not fully understand the question. When the man returned to Rabbi Ḥanina, Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said: Who is this</b> person <b>who is bothering me? Go and say to the</b> individual <b>who is sitting at the gate,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda bar Zevina: Sciatic <b>nerves do not impart flavor.</b> Consequently, he can remove the sciatic nerve and the rest of the meat is permitted.

### Part 11
<b>When</b> people <b>would come before Rabbi Ami</b> to ask about the <i>halakha</i> of a thigh that was cooked with the sciatic nerve inside, he would <b>send them before Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Ḥalov, who</b> would <b>rule</b> leniently <b>about</b> this issue and say that is was <b>permitted, in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi.</b> Rabbi Ami <b>himself did not hold accordingly,</b> but he did not wish to rule stringently for others. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that sciatic <b>nerves do not impart flavor</b> at all.

### Part 12
§ The mishna states (96b): With regard to <b>a sciatic nerve that was cooked</b> with other sinews, when one identifies the sciatic nerve and removes it, the other sinews are forbidden if the sciatic nerve was large enough to impart flavor. And if he does not identify it, all the sinews are forbidden because each one could be the sciatic nerve. The Gemara challenges: <b>Let</b> the sciatic nerve <b>be nullified by</b> a simple <b>majority.</b>
