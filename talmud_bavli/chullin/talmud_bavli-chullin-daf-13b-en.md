### Part 1
<b>his sons are <i>mamzerim</i>,</b> as he is indifferent to his wife’s engaging in adultery.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> why did he not include the ruling that the sons of a heretic are <i>mamzerim</i>? The Gemara answers: In his opinion, a heretic <b>does not release his wife</b> and allow her to engage in adultery.

### Part 3
<b>The Master said</b> in the mishna: <b>Slaughter</b> performed by <b>a gentile</b> renders the animal <b>an unslaughtered carcass.</b> The Gemara challenges this: <b>And let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he is a heretic</b> who is a devout idolater and deriving benefit from his slaughter is prohibited. <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: There are no</b> such <b>heretics among the nations</b> of the world.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But don’t we see that there are?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Say the majority of</b> the people of <b>the nations</b> of the world <b>are not heretics,</b> and with regard to slaughter one follows the majority. The Gemara notes: Rabba bar Avuh <b>holds in accordance with that which Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The status of <b>gentiles outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael is <b>not</b> that of <b>idol worshippers,</b> as their worship is not motivated by faith and devotion. <b>Rather, it is</b> a traditional <b>custom of their ancestors</b> that was transmitted <b>to them.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: There are no heretics among the nations</b> of the world, i.e., gentile heretics do not have the halakhic status of actual heretics. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> matter did Rav Naḥman state the <i>halakha</i>? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>with regard to slaughter, now</b> that <b>you said the slaughter of a Jewish heretic is forbidden,</b> is it <b>necessary</b> to say the slaughter <b>of a gentile</b> heretic is forbidden? <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>one lowers</b> them into a pit, i.e., one may kill a heretic, and Rav Naḥman holds that one may not kill them. But this too is difficult, as <b>now</b> if <b>one lowers a Jewish</b> heretic into a pit, is it <b>necessary</b> to say <b>that</b> one lowers <b>a gentile</b> heretic?

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said:</b> It is stated <b>with regard to accepting an offering from them, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “When any person of you shall bring an offering” (Leviticus 1:2): The verse states: <b>“Of you,” and not:</b> Of <b>all of you, to exclude the</b> Jewish <b>transgressor</b> who regularly violates a prohibition. Furthermore, God states: <b>“Of you,”</b> to mean that <b>among you,</b> the Jews, <b>I distinguished</b> between a transgressor and other Jews, <b>but not among the nations.</b> One accepts an offering from all gentiles, even a heretic.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> do you draw that conclusion? <b>Perhaps this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying:</b> With regard to offerings <b>from Jews, from righteous</b> Jews <b>accept</b> the offering and <b>from wicked</b> Jews <b>do not accept</b> the offering; <b>but with regard to the nations of the world, do not</b> accept their offerings <b>at all.</b> The Gemara rejects that possibility: That <b>should not enter your mind, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>] from the house of Israel…who shall sacrifice his offering” (Leviticus 22:18): Since it would have been sufficient to write: <b>A man [<i>ish</i>], what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]”?</b> It serves <b>to include the gentiles, who</b> may <b>vow</b> to bring <b>vow offerings and gift offerings like a Jew.</b>

### Part 8
§ The mishna states with regard to an animal slaughtered by a gentile: <b>And</b> the carcass <b>imparts ritual impurity through carrying.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious? Since it is</b> considered <b>an unslaughtered carcass it imparts ritual impurity through carrying. Rava said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is teaching: This</b> slaughtered animal <b>imparts ritual impurity through carrying, and you have another</b> animal <b>that imparts impurity even in a tent,</b> i.e., if one is beneath the same roof with this animal he becomes impure even though he neither touched it nor carried it. <b>And which</b> animal is that? <b>That</b> animal <b>is an idolatrous offering, and</b> this statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira</b> cited below.

### Part 9
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> an alternative version of Rava’s statement: <b>Rava said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is teaching: This</b> slaughtered animal <b>imparts ritual impurity through carrying, and you have another</b> animal <b>that is like this</b> one in <b>that</b> it <b>imparts ritual impurity through carrying and does not impart impurity in a tent. And which</b> animal is this? <b>This</b> animal <b>is an idolatrous offering, and</b> this statement is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira.</b>

### Part 10
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to an idolatrous offering that it imparts impurity in a tent?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “They adhered to Ba’al-Peor and ate the offerings to the dead”</b> (Psalms 106:28). <b>Just as a corpse imparts impurity in a tent, so too an idolatrous offering imparts impurity in a tent.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>at night, and likewise</b> in the case of <b>the blind</b> person <b>who slaughters</b> an animal, <b>his slaughter is valid.</b>

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the formulation of the mishna: <b>One who slaughters,</b> and not: One may slaughter, that with regard to the slaughter of one who slaughters at night, <b>after the fact, yes,</b> it is valid, but <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> one may <b>not</b> do so. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:4): <b>One may always slaughter, both during the day and at night, both on the rooftop and atop a ship,</b> indicating that slaughter at night is permitted <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> there is <b>a torch opposite</b> the slaughterer; therefore, it is permitted <i>ab initio</i>. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise, as</b> slaughter at night <b>is taught there</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>similar to</b> slaughter <b>during the day,</b> based on the juxtaposition: Both during the day and at night. <b>And here</b> slaughter at night is taught <b>similar to</b> the slaughter performed <b>by a blind</b> person, with no light, based on the juxtaposition: One who slaughters at night, and likewise the blind person who slaughters. Therefore, the slaughter is valid only after the fact. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from it.</b>
