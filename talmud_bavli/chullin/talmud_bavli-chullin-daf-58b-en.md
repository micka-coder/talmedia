### Part 1
<b>These dates</b> stored in <b>a jar are permitted after</b> remaining there for <b>twelve months</b> of <b>the year.</b> Since worms have no bones, they cannot last twelve months. Consequently, any worms found in the dates must have hatched after they were picked and are therefore permitted.

### Part 2
<b>Rav says: There is no one-day-old mosquito,</b> since all mosquitoes die before they have lived a day. <b>And there is no one-year-old fly.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But isn’t</b> there the adage that <b>people say</b> that <b>the female mosquito revolted against the male mosquito seven years, since she said to him: I saw a townsman swimming in the water, and he came out and wrapped himself in sheets, and you sat on him and sucked</b> blood <b>from him, and you did not inform me?</b> Apparently, some boneless creatures can survive at least seven years. Abaye <b>said to him: And according to your reasoning,</b> what about <b>that</b> adage <b>that people say: Six thousand iron dinars hang in a mosquito’s mallet,</b> i.e., its bite is powerful? <b>Is there</b> really such a thing? <b>How much does</b> the mosquito <b>itself</b> weigh? <b>Rather,</b> the saying must be referring <b>to hundreds of their own dinars,</b> i.e., the mosquitoes’ coins. <b>Here, too,</b> the adage is referring <b>to their own years,</b> not human years.

### Part 4
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Bekhorot</i> 40a): <b>With regard to an animal with five legs, or</b> one <b>that has only three, this is a blemish,</b> and the animal may not be brought as an offering. <b>Rav Huna said: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>was missing or had an additional foreleg. But</b> if it <b>was missing or had an additional hind leg, it is also a <i>tereifa</i>. What is the reason?</b> It is that <b>any extra</b> limb <b>is considered like a removed</b> limb. An animal whose foreleg was removed is kosher, but if its hind leg was removed it is a <i>tereifa</i>; the same applies if it had an extra leg.

### Part 5
The Gemara recounts the case of <b>a certain animal that had two ceca. They brought it to Ravina, and he deemed it a <i>tereifa</i> based on</b> the statement <b>of Rav Huna</b> that an extra limb is like a missing limb. Since an animal missing a cecum is a <i>tereifa</i>, an animal with an extra cecum is likewise a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara adds: <b>But if they empty into each other,</b> such that food can move freely between them, the animal is <b>kosher,</b> because they are considered one organ.

### Part 6
The Gemara recounts the case of <b>a certain tube that exited from the reticulum into the omasum. Rav Ashi thought to deem</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. Rav Huna Mar bar Ḥiyya said to Rav Ashi: All animals</b> that dwell <b>outside have</b> tubes like <b>this,</b> and one need not be concerned.

### Part 7
The Gemara recounts the case of <b>a certain tube that passed from the reticulum to the rumen. Mar bar Rav Ashi thought to deem</b> the animal <b>kosher,</b> as in the above case. <b>Rav Oshaya said to him: Is that to say all</b> such cases <b>are woven in one weave? Where it was stated</b> that such an organ is normal, <b>it was stated; where it was not stated, it was not stated.</b> This animal is a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 8
<b>Natan bar Sheila, head of the butchers of Tzippori, testified before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>about two intestines that exit</b> the abomasum of <b>the animal as one, that this</b> renders the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. But</b> if this phenomenon occurs <b>likewise in a bird,</b> it is <b>kosher,</b> because it is common in birds. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> i.e., that two intestines render an animal a <i>tereifa</i>? It is said in a case <b>where they exit at two different points. But</b> if <b>they exit at one point,</b> adjacent to each other, <b>and they end,</b> i.e., they merge into one intestine, <b>within a fingerbreadth,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Ami and Rav Asi disagree with regard to</b> this <i>halakha</i>. <b>One says: It</b> is kosher when the two intestines exit at one point only in a case <b>where they subsequently merge</b> into one intestine; <b>and one says:</b> It is kosher <b>even if they do not subsequently merge.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <b>it</b> is kosher only in a case <b>where they subsequently merge, this</b> explanation is consistent with <b>that which</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: Within a fingerbreadth.</b> That is, the two intestines must merge within a fingerbreadth for the animal to be kosher. <b>But according to the one who says:</b> It is kosher <b>even if they do not subsequently merge, what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: And they end <b>within a fingerbreadth?</b> The Gemara responds: It means <b>within a fingerbreadth below.</b> As long as the intestines merge before the final fingerbreadth near the anus, the animal is kosher.

### Part 11
§ The mishna states: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If the down</b> covering its body <b>was removed,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i> and <b>unfit</b> for consumption, like an animal whose hide was removed. With regard to this, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yishmael said the same thing. Rabbi Yehuda</b> said <b>that which we said</b> here, that the removal of the feathers is like removal of the hide. <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> agrees, <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: The down joins</b> the flesh to constitute an olive-bulk for purposes of <i>piggul</i>. If a priest pinches the nape of the neck of a bird with intent to consume a combined olive-bulk of its meat and its down beyond the permitted time, the offering is rendered <i>piggul</i>. Evidently, both Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yishmael agree that the down of a bird is considered like the hide of an animal.

### Part 12
<b>Rava said: Perhaps it is not so,</b> and they disagree. Perhaps <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the down is like the hide of an animal <b>here only with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, since</b> when the down is removed, <b>there is nothing that protects</b> the bird, and its life is in danger; <b>but with regard to <i>piggul</i>, he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> that the down is not treated like the hide of an animal, because <i>piggul</i> applies only if one had intent to consume an item that is normally consumed. <b>And</b> perhaps <b>Rabbi Yishmael says</b> so <b>there only with regard to <i>piggul</i>,</b> since he holds that the down is in fact fit for consumption; <b>but with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> he holds that the down <b>does not protect</b> the bird, and its removal does not endanger it.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to an animal that is <b>congested with</b> excess <b>blood, or that</b> was <b>smoked,</b> i.e., that suffered from smoke inhalation, <b>or that</b> was <b>chilled</b> and subsequently became sick, <b>or that ate oleander,</b> which is poisonous, <b>or that ate the excrement of chickens, or that drank foul water,</b> although in all these cases the animal is in danger, it is <b>kosher.</b> By contrast, if the animal <b>ate deadly poison, or</b> if <b>a snake bit</b> the animal, <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b><i>tereifa</i>,</b> consumption of the animal would be <b>permitted, but</b> it is <b>prohibited due to the threat to</b> one’s <b>life</b> if he eats it.

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Shmuel says:</b> If one <b>fed</b> an animal <b>asafoetida,</b> a very sharp plant, it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. What is the reason? Since it perforates its intestines.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rav Sheizvi raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: An animal that is <b>congested with</b> excess <b>blood, or that</b> suffered from <b>smoke</b> inhalation, <b>or that ate</b> poisonous <b>oleander, or that ate the excrement of roosters, or that drank foul water,</b> or if <b>one fed it <i>tia</i>, asafoetida, or peppers,</b> or if it <b>ate deadly poison,</b> it is <b>kosher.</b> But if <b>a snake bit</b> the animal, <b>or if a mad dog bit it, with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b><i>tereifa</i></b> its consumption is <b>permitted, but</b> it is nevertheless <b>prohibited due to the threat to</b> one’s <b>life.</b> The statement of the <i>baraita</i> concerning an animal that was fed <b>asafoetida</b> poses <b>a difficulty to</b> Shmuel’s statement that <b>asafoetida</b> renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, and the statement concerning <b>deadly poison</b> poses <b>a difficulty to</b> the mishna’s statement that <b>deadly poison</b> renders the animal prohibited due to the threat to one’s life.

### Part 16
The Gemara responds: The apparent contradiction between one statement about <b>asafoetida</b> and the other statement about <b>asafoetida</b> is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a case where the animal ate asafoetida <b>leaves,</b> which are less dangerous. <b>There,</b> Shmuel is referring <b>to</b> a case where the animal ate <b>slivers</b> of asafoetida, which are very sharp. Likewise, the apparent contradiction between one statement about <b>deadly poison</b> and the other statement about <b>deadly poison</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement of the <i>baraita</i> that it is permitted is referring to a case where the animal consumed poison that is deadly only <b>to itself. That</b> statement of the mishna that it is prohibited is referring to a case where it consumed poison deadly <b>to a person.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Poison deadly to an animal is</b> the same as <b>oleander;</b> why should the <i>baraita</i> mention both? The Gemara responds: The <i>tanna</i> is referring to <b>two types of deadly poison.</b>

### Part 17
The above <i>baraita</i> teaches that if an animal was fed <i>tia</i>, it is kosher. The Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>tia</i>? Rav Yehuda said:</b>
