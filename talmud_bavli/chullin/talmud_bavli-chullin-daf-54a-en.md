### Part 1
If the <b>gullet</b> is <b>perforated in any amount,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, as taught in the mishna (42a). Therefore, if the gullet is <b>clawed</b> and <b>any amount</b> of its flesh reddens, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> as well. But <b>a perforation</b> of the <b>windpipe</b> renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> only <b>where</b> it is the size of <b>an <i>issar</i>.</b> If <b>clawed, what amount</b> of its flesh must redden in order to render it a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>After he raised the dilemma he then resolved it: Both this and that</b> render the animal a <i>tereifa</i> if <b>any amount</b> of its flesh reddened. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is because <b>its venom burns continuously</b> around the circumference of the hole and widens it.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta sat before Rav Naḥman, and he was sitting and saying: A clawed animal,</b> about <b>which</b> the Sages <b>said</b> one must be concerned, <b>requires inspection adjacent to the intestines</b> to see that the flesh has not reddened. <b>Rav Naḥman said to him: By God! Rav would teach</b> that <b>it</b> must be inspected over its entire body, <b>from</b> the flesh around <b>the hollow to</b> that of <b>the thigh.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the hollow? If we say</b> that it is <b>the hollow of the foreleg,</b> i.e., its shoulder, then the area between it and the thigh <b>is</b> the same as the area <b>adjacent to the intestines,</b> and Rav Naḥman has said nothing new. <b>Rather,</b> Rav Naḥman referred to the area <b>from the hollow of the brain,</b> i.e., the skull, <b>to the thigh.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef went up</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found that Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish were sitting and saying: A clawed animal,</b> about <b>which they said</b> one must be concerned, <b>requires inspection adjacent to the intestines.</b> Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef <b>said to them: By God! Rav would teach</b> that <b>it</b> must be inspected <b>from</b> the flesh around <b>the hollow to</b> that of <b>the thigh. Reish Lakish said to him: Who is</b> this <b>Rav, and who is</b> this <b>Rav? I do not know</b> who <b>he</b> is.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> to him: <b>But don’t</b> you <b>remember that student who served the great Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> and studied under them? <b>But by God! All those years that this student served in the yeshiva,</b> he was held to be one of the most important students and was allowed to sit during study, while <b>I</b> held a lower status and <b>served while standing up. And who was greater? He was greater in all</b> things, in Torah and piety.

### Part 6
<b>Immediately, Reish Lakish began</b> to speak <b>and said: Indeed [<i>beram</i>], that man,</b> Rav, <b>is remembered for the good, as they said this <i>halakha</i> in his name:</b> If an animal’s windpipe is <b>dislocated</b> from the throat, <b>and</b> it has already been <b>slaughtered,</b> and it is uncertain whether it was dislocated before or after slaughter, the animal is <b>kosher, as it is impossible for</b> an animal with <b>a dislocated windpipe to be slaughtered.</b> A dislocated windpipe would have slipped away from the knife, and therefore the animal must have been slaughtered while it was still attached.

### Part 7
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This is not certain; rather, one <b>should bring</b> the windpipe, make a new slit in it, <b>and compare</b> the two slits. If they are similar, then the first slit by the slaughtering knife was also made after the windpipe was dislocated, and the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. If they are different, then the slaughter preceded the dislocation of the windpipe and the animal is kosher.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that it is impossible to slaughter a dislocated windpipe <b>only</b> in cases <b>where he did not grip the <i>simanim</i></b> during slaughter. <b>But</b> if <b>he gripped the <i>simanim</i> and slaughtered</b> the animal, then it is <b>possible for</b> an animal with <b>a dislocated windpipe to be slaughtered,</b> since it will not slip away from the knife.

### Part 9
§ The mishna states: <b>This is the principle:</b> Any animal that was injured such that an animal in a similar condition could not live for an extended period is a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> case does this principle <b>add</b> that was not previously mentioned? The Gemara responds: It was stated <b>to add seven <i>halakhot</i></b> of <i>tereifot</i> taught by <i>amora’im</i> and not listed in the mishna. These cases are enumerated on 42b.

### Part 10
The Gemara recounts: The men <b>of the house of Yosef the hunter</b> would <b>strike the sciatic nerve</b> of an animal with an arrow <b>and kill</b> it that way. In other words, the animal would die from that wound. <b>They came before Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira</b> to ask if an animal with an injured sciatic nerve is a <i>tereifa</i>, which is relevant if the animal was slaughtered before it died. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira <b>said to them: And is</b> it possible <b>to add to the</b> list of <b><i>tereifot</i>? You have only what the Sages counted,</b> and the Sages mentioned no such <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 11
Likewise, the men of <b>Rav Pappa bar Abba the hunter</b> would <b>strike</b> an animal <b>in the kidney</b> with an arrow <b>and kill</b> it that way. <b>They came before Rabbi Abba</b> to ask if such an animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. Rabbi Abba <b>said to them: And is</b> it possible <b>to add to the</b> list of <b><i>tereifot</i>? You have only what the Sages counted.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara objects: <b>But we see that they die.</b> Isn’t this an indication that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>? The Gemara responds: It <b>is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that</b> in all these cases, <b>if one</b> were to <b>scatter medicine</b> on the wound, the animal would <b>live.</b> An animal is not considered a <i>tereifa</i> unless it cannot be healed.

### Part 13
mishna <b>And these,</b> despite their condition, <b>are kosher in an animal:</b> If its <b>windpipe was perforated or cracked</b> lengthwise. <b>How much can</b> the windpipe <b>be missing</b> and still be kosher? <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Until</b> the perforation is the same size <b>as the Italian <i>issar</i>.</b> If <b>the skull was fractured but the membrane of the brain was not perforated,</b> it is kosher. If <b>the heart was perforated and</b> the perforation <b>did not</b> reach <b>its chamber,</b> or if <b>the spinal</b> column <b>was broken but its cord was not cut,</b> or if <b>the liver was removed and an olive-bulk of it remained,</b> it is kosher.

### Part 14
Additionally, it is kosher if the <b>omasum or the reticulum was perforated one into the other.</b> If <b>the spleen was removed,</b> or <b>the kidneys were removed,</b> or if <b>its lower jaw was removed,</b> or if <b>its womb was removed, or</b> if its lung <b>shriveled by the hand of Heaven,</b> the animal is kosher. In the case of an animal <b>whose hide was removed, Rabbi Meir deems it kosher, and the Rabbis deem it</b> a <i>tereifa</i> and <b>unfit</b> for consumption.

### Part 15
gemara The mishna begins: And these are kosher, while the previous mishna begins: These are <i>tereifot</i>. With regard to this, it <b>was stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <i>tanna</i> intended the phrase: <b>These are <i>tereifot</i>, specifically,</b> teaching that an animal is kosher in another case. The list of kosher cases here is therefore not exhaustive. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says</b> that the <i>tanna</i> intended the phrase: <b>These are kosher, specifically,</b> teaching that an animal is a <i>tereifa</i> in another case. The list of <i>tereifot</i> at the beginning of the chapter is therefore not exhaustive.

### Part 16
The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to what</b> case <b>do they disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the statement <b>of Rav Mattana, as Rav Mattana says: This head of the femur that was</b> completely <b>dislocated</b> renders the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> According to <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who <b>says</b> that the phrase: <b>These are <i>tereifot</i>,</b> is meant <b>specifically,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> the list of <b><i>tereifot</i> and taught</b> afterward: <b>This is the principle,</b> to add cases that were not stated explicitly;
