### Part 1
<b>from non-sacred</b> animals and not from an animal purchased with second-tithe money, <b>and</b> it is sacrificed only <b>during the day, and with the right hand of</b> the priest, <b>so too, a bird burnt offering comes only from non-sacred</b> animals, <b>and</b> it is sacrificed only <b>during the day, and with the right hand of</b> the priest.

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>If</b> so, perhaps <b>just as there,</b> with regard to an animal sin offering, slaughter is valid <b>with</b> the cutting of <b>the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>, the windpipe and the gullet, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to a bird burnt offering, the pinching is valid <b>with</b> the cutting of <b>the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And pinched off</b> its head…<b>and burned</b> it on the altar” (Leviticus 1:15). This indicates that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>burning, the head</b> is burned <b>by itself and the body</b> is burned <b>by itself, so too</b> with regard to <b>pinching, the head</b> remains <b>by itself and the body</b> remains <b>by itself.</b>

### Part 4
<b>If</b> so, perhaps <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the bird sin offering, <b>he pinches and does not separate</b> between the head and the body and leaves <b>one <i>siman</i></b> uncut, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the burnt offering, <b>he pinches and does not separate</b> between the head and the body and leaves <b>one <i>siman</i></b> uncut. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And</b> the priest <b>shall bring it,”</b> meaning that a bird burnt offering shall be sacrificed in a unique manner, not like the sin offering.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: “According to the ordinance”</b> means <b>according to the ordinance</b> that is written with regard to <b>a bird sin offering. Just as there,</b>
