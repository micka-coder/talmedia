### Part 1
The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is what Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>is saying: The statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears</b> correct <b>to Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> in a case where one found them <b>in a scrap heap that</b> is <b>in a marketplace, as Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, disagrees with</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>only</b> in a case where one found them <b>in a scrap heap that</b> is <b>in the house. But</b> in a case where he found them <b>in a scrap heap that</b> is <b>in a marketplace he concedes to</b> Rabbi Yehuda. <b>And</b> the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, <b>appears</b> correct to Rabbi Yehuda in a case where he found them in the house, as he concedes to Rabbi Ḥanina in that case.

### Part 2
§ The mishna stated: Everyone slaughters an animal, i.e., can perform halakhically valid slaughter, and their slaughter is valid, <b>except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, lest they ruin their slaughter.</b> The Gemara infers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach:</b> Due to the concern <b>that they ruined</b> their slaughter, in the past tense; <b>rather,</b> he teaches: <b>Lest they ruin</b> their slaughter, in the future. <b>Rava says: That is to say</b> that <b>one does not give them non-sacred</b> animals for slaughter <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> even with the supervision of others.

### Part 3
The mishna continues: <b>And</b> for <b>all of them, when they slaughtered</b> an animal <b>and others see</b> and supervise <b>them, their slaughter is valid,</b> including even a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, who lack competence and whose intent is not halakhically effective. The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that we do not require intent for slaughter?</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rava said:</b> It <b>is Rabbi Natan, as Oshaya, the youngest of the company</b> of Sages, <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>, stating: If <b>one threw a knife to embed it in the wall, and</b> in the course of its flight the knife <b>went and slaughtered</b> an animal <b>in its</b> proper <b>manner, Rabbi Natan deems</b> the slaughter <b>valid, and the Rabbis deem</b> the slaughter <b>not valid.</b> Oshaya <b>teaches</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>and he states about it: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan</b> that there is no need for intent to perform a valid act of slaughter.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: How could the slaughter in the <i>baraita</i> be valid? <b>But don’t we require</b> that the slaughterer <b>move</b> the knife <b>back and forth</b> on the throat of the animal? When one throws a knife, it goes in one direction and does not return. The Gemara answers: The case in the <i>baraita</i> is one <b>where the knife went</b> and cut the animal’s throat, caromed off the wall <b>and came</b> back to cut the throat again <b>in its</b> proper <b>manner.</b>

### Part 6
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a dilemma:</b> In matters that require thought and intent, <b>does a minor have</b> halakhically effective <b>thought, or does he not have</b> halakhically effective <b>thought?</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Ami said to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raise this dilemma</b> with regard to the <b>action</b> of a minor, whether the action of a minor that indicates intent is effective. <b>What is different</b> about the <b>action</b> of a minor <b>that</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>does not raise a dilemma?</b> Is it due to the fact <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 17:15): A deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor <b>have</b> the capacity to perform <b>an action</b> that is halakhically effective? With regard to <b>thought as well let him not raise this dilemma, as we learned</b> in the same mishna: <b>They do not have</b> the capacity for halakhically effective <b>thought.</b>

### Part 8
<b>As we learned</b> in that mishna: With regard to <b>an acorn, a pomegranate, or a nut, which minors hollowed</b> in order <b>to measure dirt with them or that they affixed to a scale,</b> the halakhic status of those shells is that of vessels, and they are <b>susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> By contrast, if the minors merely thought to use the shells for measuring or weighing, unlike adults, they do not thereby render those shells into vessels. The reason for this distinction is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that they have</b> the capacity to perform <b>an action,</b>
