### Part 1
<b>Do we act in this manner?</b> Rav <b>said to</b> Shmuel: I did wash my hands, but as <b>I am delicate</b> I do not wish to hold food in my bare hands; therefore I covered them with a cloth.

### Part 2
The Gemara further relates: <b>When Rabbi Zeira left</b> Babylonia for Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi eating</b> bread while covering their hands <b>with worn</b> pieces of <b>wineskins,</b> rather than washing them. Rabbi Zeira <b>said</b> to them: Could <b>two great men such as yourselves err with regard to</b> the incident of <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> related above? After all, Rav <b>said</b> to Shmuel: I am using a cloth because <b>I am delicate;</b> he did wash his hands beforehand.

### Part 3
The Gemara notes: <b>It escaped</b> Rabbi Zeira’s <b>mind that Rav Taḥlifa bar Avimi said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The Sages <b>permitted</b> the consumption of bread while the hands are wrapped with <b>a cloth</b> rather than washed, specifically <b>to</b> priests <b>who partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as they are careful not to touch the bread with their hands. <b>But they did not permit</b> the use of <b>a cloth</b> in this manner <b>to</b> non-priests, even those <b>who</b> are particular to <b>eat</b> non-sacred food in a state of <b>ritual purity,</b> as they do not maintain the same level of diligence as priests. <b>And</b> since <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi were priests,</b> it was permitted for them to eat with a cloth.

### Part 4
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one <b>eats by means of</b> another <b>feeding</b> him, without himself touching the food, does he <b>need to wash hands</b> before eating <b>or not?</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the following incident <b>where Rav Huna bar Seḥora was standing before Rav Hamnuna</b> and serving him. Rav Huna bar Seḥora <b>cut a slice of meat for</b> Rav Hamnuna and placed it in his mouth, <b>and he ate</b> it. Rav Huna bar Seḥora <b>said to</b> Rav Hamnuna: <b>Were you not Rav Hamnuna, I would not feed you</b> in this fashion.

### Part 5
The Gemara infers from this episode: <b>What is the reason</b> that it was permitted for Rav Hamnuna to eat in such a manner? Is it <b>not because he was careful not to touch</b> the food with his hands? This indicates that someone may be fed even without washing his hands. The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> one can say <b>that he was vigilant</b> and <b>went ahead and washed his hands at the outset.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from that <b>which Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav said: A person may not place a slice</b> of bread <b>into the mouth of</b> the <b>attendant</b> serving at a meal <b>unless he knows that he has washed his hands. And</b> it was also stated that <b>the attendant recites a blessing over each and every cup</b> of wine presented to him at a meal. This is because he never knows if he will receive another cup, and he cannot intend that his initial blessing apply to a cup he does not know he will receive. <b>But</b> he <b>does not recite a blessing over each and every slice</b> of bread given to him. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that he must <b>recite a blessing over each and every slice</b> he receives.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Pappa said: Granted,</b> the apparent contradiction between the opinions <b>of Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is <b>not difficult;</b> one can resolve it by saying that <b>this</b> statement of Rav, that the attendant need not recite a blessing for every slice of bread, is referring to a case <b>where there is an important person</b> at the meal. Since the attendant is confident that the important person will ensure the attendant receives enough to eat, his initial blessing applies to each slice he receives. And <b>that</b> statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring to a meal <b>where there is no important person.</b> Since the attendant is not confident that he will receive another slice, he must recite a new blessing whenever he does receive one.

### Part 8
<b>In any case,</b> Rav first <b>says</b> that one should not place a slice into the attendant’s mouth <b>unless he knows that he has washed his hands.</b> This indicates that one who is fed by another must wash his hands. The Gemara responds: The case of <b>an attendant is different, as</b> he <b>is occupied</b> with his duties and may touch the food inadvertently. Therefore, he specifically may not eat without washing his hands.

### Part 9
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person</b> who is a guest <b>may not give a slice</b> of bread from the meal in front of him <b>to the attendant</b> serving, <b>whether a cup is in</b> the attendant’s <b>hand or a cup is in the host’s hand, lest a mishap occur at the meal.</b> The host might become angry or distracted by the concern that there will not remain enough food for his guests, and the cup will fall from his hand. If the cup is in the attendant’s hand, he might drop it while accepting food from the guest. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>an attendant who has not washed his hands,</b> it <b>is prohibited to place a slice</b> of bread <b>into his mouth.</b>

### Part 10
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Does one who feeds</b> another <b>need to wash</b> his <b>hands,</b> since his hands are touching the food? <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>he does not need</b> to wash his hands, as he himself is not eating.

### Part 11
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from <b>that</b> which <b>the school of Menashe taught</b> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A woman may rinse one hand in water</b> on Yom Kippur, so that she does not touch food before she has washed her hands in the morning, <b>and give bread to her minor son,</b> without concern about violating the prohibition against bathing on Yom Kippur. <b>They said about Shammai the Elder that he did not want to feed</b> his children <b>with</b> even <b>one hand</b> on Yom Kippur, to avoid having to wash it. <b>But</b> due to concerns about the health and well-being of his children, <b>they decreed that he must feed</b> them <b>with two hands,</b> forcing him to wash both. Apparently one who feeds another must wash his hands, even though he himself is not eating.

### Part 12
<b>Abaye said:</b> The reason for the washing <b>there</b> is not on account of the food specifically. Rather, it is <b>due to</b> an evil spirit named <b>Shivta,</b> who contaminates hands that have not been washed in the morning. As long as one washes his hands in the morning, perhaps he need not wash them again to feed another.

### Part 13
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from the following incident, <b>as Shmuel’s father found</b> the young <b>Shmuel crying,</b> and <b>said to him: Why are you crying?</b> Shmuel replied: <b>Because my teacher struck me.</b> His father asked: <b>Why</b> did he strike you? Shmuel responded: My teacher <b>said to me: You are feeding my son, but you did not wash your hands.</b> His father asked: <b>And why did you not wash</b> your hands? Shmuel <b>said to him:</b> Only <b>he,</b> the teacher’s son, <b>is eating, and I</b> must <b>wash my hands?</b>

### Part 14
Shmuel’s father <b>said to him: Is it not enough that</b> your teacher <b>did not learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> properly, <b>that he even strikes you</b> on account of his error? One who feeds another need not wash his hands if he himself is not eating. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that one who <b>eats by means of</b> another <b>feeding</b> him <b>needs to wash</b> his <b>hands,</b> even though he does not touch the food. But <b>one who feeds</b> another <b>does not need to wash</b> his <b>hands.</b>

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person may bind meat and cheese in one cloth, provided that they do not come into contact with each other. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Two</b> unacquainted <b>guests [<i>akhsena’in</i>] may eat</b> together <b>on one table, this</b> one eating <b>meat and that</b> one eating <b>cheese, and they</b> need <b>not be concerned</b> lest they come to violate the prohibition of eating meat and milk by partaking of the food of the other.

### Part 16
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one may bind meat and cheese together in one cloth, provided that they do not come into contact with each other. The Gemara asks: <b>And if they come into contact with each other, what of it? It is</b> a case of one <b>cold</b> food <b>in</b> contact with another <b>cold</b> food, and they would not absorb substances from one another. <b>Abaye said: Granted that</b> cold foods <b>do not require</b> the <b>peeling</b> of the place where they came into contact, as they do not absorb substances from one another. Nevertheless, <b>don’t they require rinsing</b> in water? The Sages therefore decreed against the contact of even cold meat and cheese, lest one come to eat them without rinsing them first.

### Part 17
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Two guests may eat</b> together <b>on</b> one <b>table,</b> this one eating meat and that one eating cheese. <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Ami says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the guests <b>do not know each other,</b> as they will not eat of each other’s food. <b>But</b> in a situation where <b>they know each other,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> for them to eat together at the same table.

### Part 18
<b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If <b>two guests roomed in one inn, this one coming from the north and that one coming from the south, this one coming with his piece</b> of meat <b>and that one coming with his cheese, they may eat</b> together <b>on one table, this one</b> eating <b>meat and that one cheese, and they</b> need <b>not be concerned.</b>

### Part 19
The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And</b> the Sages <b>prohibited</b> this practice <b>only</b> if they both eat <b>from one parcel.</b> The Gemara adds: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is actually referring to a case where they eat from <b>one parcel?</b> This is obviously prohibited. <b>Rather,</b> it prohibits eating even in a manner <b>as though</b> they were eating from <b>one parcel,</b> i.e., when the diners are somewhat acquainted with each other, since neither would mind if the other ate from his food.

### Part 20
§ It was stated above that if two diners are acquainted with each other they may not eat meat and cheese on the same table. <b>Rav Yeimar bar Shelemya said to Abaye:</b> If these diners are <b>two brothers, but they are</b> each <b>particular</b> not to let <b>one another</b> eat of his food, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? May they eat separate dishes of meat and cheese at a single table?

### Part 21
Abaye <b>said to him:</b> Your question evokes that of Baitos ben Zunin. The Sages prohibited the baking of elaborately decorated Syrian cakes for Passover, lest people tarry in their preparation and the cakes become leavened. Baitos wished to prepare the cakes in a way that would not lead to a violation of any prohibition, and yet the Sages prohibited it, because people <b>will say: All the</b> decorated <b>Syrian cakes are forbidden, but the Syrian cakes of Baitos are permitted?</b> Here too, to avoid confusion, we will not allow exceptions to the rule.

### Part 22
Rav Yeimar responded: <b>But according to your reasoning,</b> one may refute <b>that which Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Although the Sages prohibited laundering on the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>one who has only one shirt is permitted to launder it on the intermediate days of a Festival.</b> Here too, one can claim: People <b>will say</b> metaphorically:
