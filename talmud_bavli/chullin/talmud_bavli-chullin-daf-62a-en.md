### Part 1
If <b>one is familiar with</b> the non-kosher birds <b>and their names,</b> any <b>bird that comes</b> before him <b>with</b> only <b>one sign is kosher,</b> since he can be sure that it is not the <i>peres</i> or <i>ozniyya</i>, which have only one sign. If <b>he is not familiar with them and their names,</b> any bird that he finds <b>with one sign is non-kosher,</b> since it may be the <i>peres</i> or <i>ozniyya</i>. But if he finds a bird <b>with</b> exactly <b>two signs,</b> it is <b>kosher, provided that he</b> can <b>recognize a crow,</b> since the crow is the only non-kosher bird with exactly two signs.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: Must he recognize only the <b>crow and nothing more? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Every <i>orev</i> after its kinds” (Leviticus 11:15). With regard to the <b><i>orev</i>, this is the</b> well-known <b>crow;</b> as for the phrase <b>“after its kinds,” Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> It is written <b>to include the <i>zarzir</i>,</b> another type of crow, to teach that it is non-kosher. The Sages <b>said to Rabbi Eliezer: But wouldn’t the people of Kefar Temarta in Judea eat</b> the <i>zarzir</i>, <b>because it has a crop?</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: They too will be judged in the future</b> for their transgression.

### Part 3
<b>Alternatively,</b> the phrase <b>“after its kinds”</b> is written <b>to include</b> the <b>white <i>senunit</i></b> and teach that it is non-kosher; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him: But don’t the people of the upper Galilee eat it, because its gizzard can be peeled?</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: They too will be judged in the future</b> for their transgression. In any event, the <i>baraita</i> indicates that other non-kosher birds exist that have two signs, like the crow. The Gemara responds: <b>Rather,</b> Rav Naḥman must have meant that one must be able to recognize the well-known <b>crow and all</b> other <b>species of crow.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Ameimar said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is: Any <b>bird that comes</b> before a person <b>with one sign is kosher, provided that it does not claw</b> its food. <b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: What</b> about <b>that which Rav Naḥman</b> said, that if one finds a bird with exactly one sign, he may eat it only if he can identify all the non-kosher birds in the Torah, to be sure that it is not one of them? Ameimar <b>said to him: I did not hear</b> this statement; <b>that is to say: I do not hold</b> accordingly. <b>What</b> concern <b>is there?</b> Is one concerned <b>because</b> of <b>the <i>peres</i> and <i>ozniyya</i>,</b> which have only one sign? <b>They are not</b> found <b>in settled areas,</b> and one need not be concerned about them.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> The bird known as <b>the scratching bird is fit for</b> use in <b>the purification of a leper,</b> i.e., it is kosher. Only kosher birds are fit for this rite, as the verse states: “Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be purified two living pure birds” (Leviticus 14:4). <b>And this is the white <i>senunit</i> about which Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis disagreed</b> in the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 6
<b>Ameimar said:</b> There are two kinds of white <i>senunit</i>. <b>With regard to</b> the <i>senunit</i> <b>with a white belly, everyone agrees that it is permitted</b> for consumption. <b>They disagree when</b> discussing the kind <b>with a yellow belly. Rabbi Eliezer prohibits it, and the Rabbis permit it. And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Mar Zutra teaches</b> the statement of Ameimar in <b>this</b> manner: <b>With regard to</b> the <i>senunit</i> <b>with a yellow belly, everyone agrees that it is prohibited. They disagree when</b> discussing the kind <b>with a white belly. Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> it <b>prohibited, and the Rabbis deem</b> it <b>permitted. And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who deem</b> it <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the kind <b>with a white belly, this</b> explanation is consistent with <b>that which</b> Rav Yehuda <b>teaches: This is the white <i>senunit</i></b> about which Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis disagreed. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the kind <b>with a yellow</b> belly, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>This is the white <i>senunit</i>?</b> The Gemara responds: The phrase: White <i>senunit</i>, is used only <b>to exclude</b> the <b>house</b> <i>senunit</i>, <b>which is black.</b>

### Part 9
§ <b>Raḥava says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> A young <b><i>tasil</i>,</b> which is similar to a dove, is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice <b>as a dove,</b> which is fit only when mature, <b>but</b> it is <b>fit</b> for sacrifice <b>as a pigeon,</b> which is fit only when immature. In other words, the <i>tasil</i> is considered a type of pigeon, not a dove. A mature <b><i>datzifi</i></b> bird, <b>and</b> mature <b>doves of Reḥava, are fit as doves, but are unfit as pigeons,</b> since they are types of doves. <b>Rav Daniel bar Rav Ketina raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Para</i> 9:3): <b>All birds</b>
