### Part 1
<b>One</b> factor is <b>because of the oppressors,</b> i.e., the concern that perhaps the gentile will keep the money for himself and force the merchant to give him the meat without payment. <b>And another</b> factor is <b>lest</b> the merchant <b>sell him</b> meat from unslaughtered <b>carcasses or <i>tereifot</i></b> without realizing that the gentile is purchasing the meat on behalf of a Jew.

### Part 2
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And in</b> the case of one who sends a thigh to <b>a gentile,</b> regardless of <b>whether it is cut or whole he is not required to remove the sciatic nerve from it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are we dealing with? If we say</b> that it is referring <b>to a place</b> where all the butchers are Jewish and <b>they announce</b> every time they sell non-kosher meat to a gentile, then in the case of a thigh that has been <b>cut, why</b> is one <b>not required to remove the sciatic nerve? Since it was not announced</b> that they sold non-kosher meat, a Jew might <b>come to purchase it from</b> a gentile without realizing that it still contains the sciatic nerve.

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that it is referring <b>to a place where they do not announce</b> every time they sell non-kosher meat, and in such a place a Jew would not purchase meat from a gentile. But <b>say the middle clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: And it was <b>due to two factors</b> that the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one may not sell</b> meat from unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses or <i>tereifot</i> to a gentile: One</b> is <b>because it misleads him; and another</b> is the concern <b>lest</b> the gentile <b>then sell</b> the meat <b>to another Jew,</b> who will think it is kosher since it originally was sold by a Jew.

### Part 4
<b>But if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a place where they do not announce</b> every time they sell non-kosher meat to a gentile, a Jew <b>will not come to purchase</b> the meat <b>from</b> the gentile. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a place where they announce</b> every time they sell non-kosher meat.

### Part 5
But <b>say the latter clause:</b> And similarly, <b>a person may not say to a gentile: Purchase meat for me with this dinar, due to two factors. One</b> factor is <b>because of the oppressors, and another</b> factor is <b>lest</b> the merchant <b>sell him</b> meat from unslaughtered <b>carcasses or <i>tereifot</i></b> without realizing that the gentile is purchasing the meat on behalf of a Jew. <b>But if</b> it is referring <b>to a place where they announce</b> every time non-kosher meat is sold, <b>if</b> it would happen <b>that it was a <i>tereifa</i></b> the butchers <b>would have announced</b> the fact, and the Jew would know not to eat that meat.

### Part 6
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a place where they do not announce</b> every time non-kosher meat is sold. But is it possible that <b>the first clause and the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> are referring <b>to a place where they do not announce</b> every time non-kosher meat is sold but <b>the middle clause</b> is referring <b>to a place where they</b> do <b>announce</b> every time non-kosher meat is sold?

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said: Yes, the first clause and the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> are referring <b>to a place where they do not announce</b> every time non-kosher meat is sold, and <b>the middle clause</b> is referring <b>to a place where they</b> do <b>announce</b> every time non-kosher meat is sold.

### Part 8
<b>Rava said:</b> The <b>entire</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a place where they announce</b> every time non-kosher meat is sold. <b>The first clause and the latter clause</b> are referring to days <b>when they announced</b> that non-kosher meat had been sold, and <b>the middle clause</b> is referring to a day <b>when they did not announce</b> that non-kosher meat had been sold.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The <b>entire</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a place where they do not announce</b> every time non-kosher meat is sold. <b>And</b> the reason that <b>the middle clause</b> teaches that it is prohibited to sell meat from unslaughtered carcasses or <i>tereifot</i> to a gentile is due to <b>a</b> rabbinic <b>decree lest</b> the Jew <b>sell it</b> to the gentile <b>in the presence of</b> another <b>Jew,</b> who will think that this particular piece of meat is kosher.

### Part 10
§ The Gemara noted that there were places where they would announce whenever non-kosher meat was sold to a gentile. The Gemara asks: <b>How do we announce</b> that non-kosher meat has been sold? The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef said: Meat has fallen</b> into our possession <b>for the soldiers,</b> i.e., the gentiles.

### Part 11
The Gemara objects: <b>But let</b> them <b>say: A <i>tereifa</i> has fallen</b> into our possession <b>for the soldiers.</b> The Gemara answers that if a butcher would publicize the fact that it is a <i>tereifa</i>, the gentiles would <b>not purchase</b> it from him because they would not want an animal rejected by the Jews.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the announcement is made in a way that obscures from the gentiles the fact that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>doesn’t</b> this <b>deceive them?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is they who deceive themselves,</b> because the seller does not specify which kind of meat he is selling.

### Part 13
The Gemara cites proof that it is permitted to allow others to mislead themselves. It is <b>like this</b> incident <b>when Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, was going from</b> the city of <b>Sikhra to</b> the city of <b>Bei Meḥoza, and</b> at the same time <b>Rava and Rav Safra were going to Sikhra. They met each other,</b> and Mar Zutra <b>thought they were coming</b> out to greet <b>him. He said to them: Why did the Rabbis exert</b> themselves <b>and come all this</b> way to greet me? <b>Rav Safra said to him: We did not know that the Master was coming; if we would have known we would have exerted</b> ourselves <b>more.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Safra: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you said this</b> to Mar Zutra? <b>By</b> telling him that we were not coming to greet him you <b>upset him.</b> Rav Safra <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>But</b> if I would not have said so <b>we</b> would have <b>misled him.</b> Rava responded: Mar Zutra <b>misled himself,</b> since we never said we were coming to greet him.

### Part 15
§ The Gemara returns to the topic of selling non-kosher meat to a gentile. There was <b>a certain</b> Jewish <b>butcher who said to another</b> individual:
