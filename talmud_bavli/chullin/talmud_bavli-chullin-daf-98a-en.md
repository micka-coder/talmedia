### Part 1
<b>an egg</b> that contains <b>a chick,</b> as the chick imparts flavor to the food in which the egg is cooked. <b>But</b> with regard to an egg that does not contain a chick but is from <b>a non-kosher</b> bird, it does <b>not</b> impart flavor to the food with which it is cooked.

### Part 2
Rav Idi bar Avin <b>raised an objection to</b> this answer based on a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 9:5): With regard to <b>kosher eggs that one boiled with non-kosher eggs, if they have</b> a ratio that allows the non-kosher eggs to <b>impart flavor</b> to the kosher eggs, <b>they are all forbidden.</b> This indicates that eggs from non-kosher birds do have flavor. Abaye answered: <b>Here, too</b> it is referring <b>to an egg</b> from a kosher bird that contains <b>a chick. And why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> <b>call this a non-kosher</b> egg, indicating that it is an egg from a non-kosher species? <b>Since it has a chick inside,</b> which causes the egg to be forbidden, the <i>baraita</i> <b>calls it non-kosher.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara objects: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches:</b> With regard to <b>eggs that one boiled and a chick was found in one of them, if they have</b> a ratio that allows the chick to <b>impart flavor to them, they are all forbidden, it may be inferred that</b> in <b>the first clause we are dealing with</b> an egg <b>that does not have a chick inside.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara explains that this is an incorrect inference, as the latter clause <b>is explaining</b> the first clause, so that the <i>baraita</i> should be read as follows: With regard to <b>kosher eggs that one boiled with non-kosher eggs, if they have</b> a ratio that allows the non-kosher eggs to <b>impart flavor</b> to the kosher eggs, <b>they are all forbidden. How</b> so? It can be referring to a case <b>where one boiled them and a chick was found in one of them.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara adds: <b>So too it is reasonable</b> to explain the <i>baraita</i> in this manner, <b>as if</b> it would <b>enter your mind</b> to say that <b>the first clause</b> is referring to a case <b>where there is no chick in</b> the egg, the latter clause is redundant: <b>Now</b> that the <i>tanna</i> has taught that in a case <b>where there is no chick inside,</b> the non-kosher egg imparts flavor to the kosher eggs and renders them <b>forbidden, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> for the <i>tanna</i> to teach that an egg <b>that has a chick inside</b> imparts flavor to the kosher eggs?

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>If it is due to that</b> reason, <b>there is no</b> conclusive <b>argument,</b> i.e., the proof of the argument is inconclusive. The reason is that one can say that the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught the latter clause to reveal</b> the meaning of <b>the first clause.</b> The latter clause was stated so <b>that you would not</b> mistakenly <b>say</b> that <b>the first clause</b> is referring only to a case <b>where</b> the egg <b>has a chick inside, but</b> if <b>there is no chick inside</b> the kosher eggs would be <b>permitted.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches the latter clause</b> and specifies <b>that</b> it is referring to an egg <b>that has a chick inside. By inference the first clause</b> is referring to a case of an egg <b>that does not have a chick inside, and even so it</b> renders all of the other eggs <b>forbidden.</b>

### Part 7
§ The Gemara continues discussing the nullification of forbidden foods. There was once <b>a certain olive-bulk</b> of forbidden <b>fat that fell into a pot of</b> kosher <b>meat. Rav Asi thought to measure</b> the volume of the kosher meat together <b>with that which the pot had absorbed. The Rabbis said to Rav Ashi: Is that to say that</b> the pot <b>absorbed</b> the <b>permitted</b> meat but <b>did not absorb</b> the <b>forbidden</b> fat?

### Part 8
The Gemara relates a similar incident: There was once <b>a certain half-olive-bulk of</b> forbidden <b>fat that fell into a pot of</b> kosher <b>meat. Mar bar Rav Ashi thought to measure</b> the amount of kosher meat needed to nullify the forbidden fat as <b>thirty half-olive-bulks,</b> rather than sixty. <b>His father,</b> Rav Ashi, <b>said to him: Have I not told you: Do not</b> treat <b>measures lightly</b> even with regard to <b>rabbinic</b> prohibitions? <b>And furthermore, didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: A half-measure</b> is <b>prohibited by Torah</b> law? Consequently, the half-olive-bulk of forbidden fat is nullified only in sixty times its volume of permitted meat.

### Part 9
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of nullifying forbidden foods. <b>Rav Shemen bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav Idi bar Idi bar Gershom says</b> that <b>Levi bar Perata says</b> that <b>Rabbi Naḥum says</b> that <b>Rabbi Biryam says in the name of a certain elder, and his name was Rabbi Ya’akov,</b> that the Sages <b>in the house of the <i>Nasi</i> said:</b> If a non-kosher <b>egg</b> is mixed <b>with</b> kosher eggs, if there are <b>sixty</b> eggs they are all <b>forbidden,</b> but if there are <b>sixty-one</b> eggs they <b>are</b> all <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rav Shemen bar Abba: See,</b> one can infer from your words <b>that you fix a limit</b> to <b>permit</b> the eggs if there is a total of sixty-one eggs, including the non-kosher egg. This is a revelation, <b>because the two</b> most <b>eminent</b> Sages <b>of the generation did not clarify this matter.</b> These two eminent Sages were <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani,</b> and <b>both of them said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi:</b> In a case where a non-kosher <b>egg</b> is mixed <b>with</b> kosher eggs, if there are <b>sixty</b> eggs they are all <b>forbidden,</b> but if there are <b>sixty-one</b> eggs they <b>are</b> all <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And a dilemma was raised before</b> these Sages: When Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said they are permitted if there are <b>sixty-one</b> eggs, does that mean there are <b>sixty-one</b> eggs altogether, <b>with the</b> non-kosher egg, <b>or</b> does it <b>perhaps</b> mean that there must be sixty-one kosher eggs <b>aside from</b> the non-kosher egg? <b>And</b> they <b>did not resolve</b> this dilemma. <b>And</b> yet, it appears as though <b>the Master,</b> Rav Shemen, has <b>resolved</b> the dilemma, because you implied that the mixture is kosher if there are a total of sixty-one eggs including the non-kosher egg.

### Part 12
The Gemara continues: It <b>was stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If a non-kosher <b>egg</b> becomes mixed <b>with</b> kosher eggs, if there are <b>sixty</b> kosher eggs in addition to <b>that</b> non-kosher egg, the entire mixture is <b>forbidden.</b> But if there are <b>sixty-one</b> kosher eggs in addition to <b>that</b> one non-kosher egg, the mixture is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 13
§ There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who came before Rabban Gamliel bar Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi with a half-olive-bulk of non-kosher food that had been mixed with a larger amount of kosher food. Rabban Gamliel <b>said to him:</b> A similar case came before my <b>father,</b> and even though he <b>did not measure</b> the kosher food as being sixty times the volume of the non-kosher food, he nevertheless permitted the mixture due to the fact that there was <b>forty-seven</b> times as much kosher food as non-kosher food. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>I will</b> permit the mixture because I <b>measure</b> that the kosher food is <b>forty-five</b> times the volume of the non-kosher food.

### Part 14
Similarly there was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who came before Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi with a mixture of kosher and non-kosher food. Rabbi Shimon <b>said to him:</b> A similar case came before my <b>father,</b> and even though he <b>did not measure</b> the kosher food as being sixty times the volume of the non-kosher food, he nevertheless permitted the mixture due to the fact that there was <b>forty-five</b> times as much kosher food as non-kosher food. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>I will</b> permit the mixture because I <b>measure</b> that the kosher food is <b>forty-three</b> times the volume of the non-kosher food.

### Part 15
There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who came before Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> with a mixture of kosher and non-kosher food. Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: Is there</b> even <b>thirty</b> times the volume of permitted food as forbidden food? Clearly, the mixture is forbidden.

### Part 16
The Gemara seeks to clarify: This indicates that <b>the reason</b> that he prohibited the mixture is <b>that there was not thirty</b> times as much kosher food as non-kosher food. <b>But</b> it may then be inferred that if <b>there is thirty</b> times as much kosher food as non-kosher food, one may <b>assess,</b> i.e., permit, the mixture. And this contradicts the <i>halakha</i> that non-kosher food is nullified only in a mixture containing sixty times as much kosher food as non-kosher food. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya did not make this statement to set a halakhic principle, but merely as <b>an exaggeration.</b> There was not even thirty times the volume of kosher food, so it was obvious that the mixture was forbidden.

### Part 17
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says in the name of bar Kappara: All</b> the <b>forbidden</b> foods <b>in the Torah</b> are nullified when they are mixed <b>with</b> kosher food that is <b>sixty</b> times their volume. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said before</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: <b>My teacher, you say this</b> citing Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, who said that bar Kappara said it. But <b>this is what Rav Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says in the name of bar Kappara: All</b> the <b>forbidden</b> foods <b>in the Torah</b> are nullified when they are mixed <b>with</b> kosher food that is <b>one hundred</b> times their volume.

### Part 18
The Gemara adds: <b>And both of them learned</b> their principles of nullification <b>only from</b> the term: <b>“Cooked foreleg,” as it is written</b> with regard to the nazirite’s ram: <b>“And the priest shall take the cooked foreleg</b> of the ram” (Numbers 6:19). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Cooked,”</b>
