embedded <b>in the thickness of</b> the wall of <b>the reticulum,</b> where the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If the needle protrudes <b>from one side,</b> i.e., the inner side of the stomach wall, the animal is <b>kosher,</b> but if it protrudes <b>from both sides,</b> it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>; and</b> if it protrudes only on the inside <b>we do not say: See if the eye</b> of the needle is facing <b>outward or if the eye</b> of the needle is facing <b>inward?</b> Rather, the animal is deemed kosher even if the eye is facing outward, and that is not considered evidence that the needle perforated through the gullet into the chest cavity and then perforated the thickness of the reticulum.

### Part 2
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>There,</b> in the case of the reticulum, <b>since there are food and liquid</b> present, one may <b>say that the food and liquid pushed</b> the eye of the needle through the stomach wall. Therefore, even if the eye points outward, one may still presume that the needle came from the inside, and the animal is kosher.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain needle that was found in the large duct of a liver. Huna Mar, son of Rav Idi, deemed</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> while <b>Rav Adda bar Minyumi deemed it kosher. They came</b> and <b>asked Ravina</b> about the issue, and <b>he said to them: Take the robe of those who deemed it a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> They must pay restitution to the owner of the animal, who was wrongfully forced to discard his kosher meat.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain</b> date <b>pit that was found in a gallbladder. Rav Ashi said: When we were in the house of Rav Kahana</b> as students, <b>he would say</b> with regard to such a case: <b>This</b> date pit <b>certainly took</b> the route <b>of</b> the <b>duct</b> connecting the liver and gallbladder <b>and came</b> through it to the gallbladder, as it is not sharp enough to have perforated the gallbladder from without. <b>Even though it</b> is large enough that it <b>does not exit</b> the gallbladder if one tries to squeeze it into the duct, one may still assume that the movements of the animal’s body gradually <b>cause it to slip</b> through the duct. The Gemara adds: <b>And this statement</b> applies only to the pit <b>of a palm,</b> i.e., of a date, <b>but</b> the pit <b>of an olive</b> is pointed. Therefore, one must be concerned that it <b>has pierced</b> the wall of the gallbladder, rendering the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 5
§ The Gemara returns to its discussion of the lung: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Why is</b> the lung <b>called <i>rei’a</i></b> in Hebrew? <b>Because it lights up [<i>me’ira</i>] the eyes</b> of one who eats it. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is Rabbi Yoḥanan referring <b>to</b> a lung <b>eaten</b> as is, <b>or</b> is he referring to a lung eaten only <b>through</b> its treatment with certain <b>substances?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from that <b>which Rav Huna bar Yehuda says: A goose</b> may be purchased <b>for a dinar, but its lung</b> may be purchased <b>for four</b> dinars. <b>And if</b> it should <b>enter your mind</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring <b>to eating</b> the lung without treating it, one has no incentive to buy a lung separately for more money. <b>Let him buy</b> the whole goose <b>for a dinar and eat</b> the lung that comes included. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that the lung gains special properties only <b>through</b> treatment with certain <b>substances,</b> and this treatment is the reason for the higher price.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara asks: If <b>the lung is perforated where the hand of the butcher handles</b> it after slaughter, <b>do we attribute</b> the perforation to the butcher’s handling, <b>or do we not attribute</b> the perforation to the handling, in which case the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>Rav Adda bar Natan says: We attribute</b> it to the butcher’s handling, while <b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, says: We do not attribute</b> it to the handling. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>we attribute</b> it to the handling.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Shmuel, son of Rabbi Abbahu, said:</b> My <b>father was</b> one <b>of the heads of the <i>kalla</i></b> lectures of <b>Rafram, and he said: We attribute</b> it to the handling. <b>They said this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>of Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari,</b> who held the opposite, <b>before</b> Rav Shmuel, <b>and he did not accept it.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya said: It stands to reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Grandfather,</b> i.e., Rav Adda bar Natan, <b>as we attribute</b> perforations <b>to a wolf.</b> If slaughtered meat is recovered from a wolf and found to have a perforation that would have rendered the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, one may attribute the perforation to the wolf and presume that it did not exist beforehand.

### Part 10
Furthermore, if a perforation was caused by <b>a worm [<i>murana</i>], Rav Yosef bar Dosai and the Rabbis disagree. One says</b> that the worm <b>emerged</b> from the lung and perforated it <b>before</b> the <b>slaughter,</b> and the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>and one says</b> that <b>it emerged after</b> the <b>slaughter,</b> and the animal is kosher. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that one presumes that <b>it emerged after</b> the <b>slaughter.</b>

### Part 11
§ The mishna states: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> An animal with a perforated lung is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>until it is perforated</b> through to the bronchi. With regard to this, <b>Rabba bar Taḥlifa says</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says:</b> Rabbi Shimon meant specifically that it is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>unless it is perforated</b> through <b>to the large bronchus,</b> from which the smaller bronchi branch out.

### Part 12
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Aḥa bar Abba sat before Rav Huna, and he was sitting and saying: Rabbi Malokh says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: Are you saying</b> this in the name of <b>Malokh the Arab? He says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with Rabbi Shimon.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara continues: <b>When Rabbi Zeira went up</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rav Beivai, who was sitting and saying: Rabbi Malokh says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him:</b> On the <b>Master’s life, I and Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and Rav Asi visited the place</b> of residence <b>of Rabbi Malokh, and we said to him: Did</b> the <b>Master say that</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon? And he said to us: I said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> Rav Beivai asked Rabbi Zeira: <b>And you, what</b> more do you have <b>in your possession</b> on this matter? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: This</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Ami says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara rules: <b>And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> Any perforation of the membranes of the lung renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 15
§ The mishna states: If <b>the abomasum was perforated,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. Concerning this, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> With regard to <b>fat that is on the abomasum,</b> the <b>priests accustomed</b> themselves to consider <b>it permitted,</b> and they would eat it along with the rest of the abomasum, which was given to them from non-sacred animals as one of the gifts of the priesthood. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael that he says in the name of his forefathers. And</b> since there is a disagreement between the Sages with regard to this issue, <b>your mnemonic</b> to remember the lenient opinion is the idiom: <b>Yishmael the priest</b> generally <b>helps the priests.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> this, i.e., where does Rabbi Yishmael help the priests? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the priestly benediction: <b>“So you shall bless the children of Israel”</b> (Numbers 6:23). <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: We learn</b> from this verse about <b>a blessing for Israel from the mouth of the priests,</b> but <b>we have not learned</b> about a blessing <b>for the priests themselves. When it says</b> afterward with regard to the priests: “And they shall put My name upon the children of Israel, <b>and I will bless them”</b> (Numbers 6:27), <b>you must say:</b> The <b>priests bless Israel, and the Holy One, Blessed be He, blesses the priests.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> a different interpretation: <b>We learned</b> from the verse about <b>a blessing for Israel from the mouth of the priests,</b> but <b>we have not learned</b> about a blessing for Israel <b>from the mouth of the Almighty. When it says</b> afterward: “And they shall put My name upon the children of Israel, <b>and I will bless them,” you must say: The priests bless Israel, and the Holy One, Blessed be He, affirms their</b> blessing. The word “them” is referring to Israel.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then <b>from where does Rabbi Akiva</b> learn about <b>a blessing for the priests? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> He learns it <b>from</b> God’s promise to Abraham: <b>“And I will bless them that bless you”</b> (Genesis 12:3). All who bless the Jewish people are blessed themselves.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> sense does only Rabbi Yishmael <b>help the priests,</b> given that Rabbi Akiva concedes that the priests are also blessed? The Gemara responds: He helps the priests in the sense <b>that he establishes the blessing for the priests in the</b> same <b>place,</b> the same verse, that one finds <b>the blessing of Israel,</b> indicating that they receive the same blessing.

### Part 20
It was stated that the priests accustomed themselves to permit the fat on the abomasum, in accordance with the statement of <b>Rabbi Yishmael that he says in the name of his forefathers.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> this statement? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when the verse states with regard to forbidden fats mentioned in the Torah: <b>“All the fat that is upon the innards”</b> (Leviticus 3:3),
