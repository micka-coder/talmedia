### Part 1
so that it looks <b>like a red date,</b> is <b>kosher;</b> all the more so is that the case if it was only perforated. But if <b>the inner</b> membrane <b>was perforated but the outer</b> membrane <b>was not perforated,</b> does the outer membrane <b>protect</b> the lung? <b>Or</b> does it <b>not protect</b> it, in which case the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>?

### Part 2
<b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree with regard to</b> this question. <b>One says:</b> It <b>does not protect</b> the lung; <b>and one says:</b> It <b>protects</b> the lung. <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that it <b>protects</b> the lung, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Yosef. As Rav Yosef says:</b> With regard to <b>this lung that emits a sound</b> when inflated, <b>if we know</b> from <b>where it emits a sound, we set a feather, or saliva, or straw on</b> that point. <b>If</b> the saliva <b>bubbles</b> when the lung is inflated, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> since this proves that the lung is perforated through both membranes. <b>And if not,</b> the animal is <b>kosher. And if we do not know</b> from <b>where it emits a sound, we bring a basin of tepid water and set</b> the lung <b>inside it.</b>

### Part 3
One <b>cannot</b> place it <b>in hot water, as it causes</b> the lung <b>to contract,</b> closing the perforation. And one <b>cannot</b> place it <b>in cold water, as it hardens</b> the lung and may cause it to crack. <b>Rather, we set it in tepid water and inflate it. If</b> the water <b>bubbles,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And if not,</b> the animal is <b>kosher,</b> since it is apparent that only <b>the inner</b> membrane <b>is perforated</b> and <b>the outer</b> membrane <b>is not perforated, and the</b> fact <b>that it emits a sound is</b> due to <b>the air</b> moving in the space <b>between</b> the two membranes. Evidently, Rav Yosef holds that if only the inner membrane is perforated, the animal is kosher.

### Part 4
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> to remember the following statements of Rava with regard to the lung: <b>Dates, red, that dried, scabbed.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara turns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> mentioned above: <b>Rava says: This</b> animal with <b>a lung whose</b> outer <b>membrane was removed</b> so that it looks <b>like a red date</b> is <b>kosher. And Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a lung</b> whose outer membrane <b>reddened</b> due to bleeding of the lung, if only <b>part of it</b> turned red, then the animal is <b>kosher,</b> but if <b>all of it</b> turned red, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Ravina said to Rava: What is the reason</b> that the animal is kosher if only <b>part of</b> the outer membrane reddened? Presumably, it is <b>because</b> the animal eventually <b>recovers</b> from the wound. But even if <b>all of it</b> turned red <b>as well,</b> the animal <b>recovers. Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one injures one of the eight impure creeping creatures mentioned in the Torah, one is liable for desecrating Shabbat; <b>but</b> if one injures <b>other repugnant creatures and creeping animals,</b> one is not liable <b>until blood leaves their</b> body as a result of the injury, even if their skin reddens as a result of internal bleeding?

### Part 7
<b>And if you would say: We compare</b> the lung <b>to</b> one of the <b>eight creeping creatures, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>the blood collected</b> under the skin of one of the eight creeping creatures, <b>even if it did not leave</b> the body, one is liable for desecrating Shabbat, because the blood will not be reabsorbed into the body and the wound is permanent; that is difficult: <b>If so,</b> then there is still no reason to distinguish between part of the lung and all of it, and <b>even</b> if only <b>part of</b> the lung turned red, the animal should be rendered a <i>tereifa</i> <b>as well,</b> because the blood will not be reabsorbed into the body. <b>Rather, there is no difference</b> between the reddening of part or all of the lung.

### Part 8
<b>And Rava says:</b> If <b>part of the lung was dried,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And how much</b> must the lung be dried so as to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>Rav Pappi says in the name of Rava:</b> It must be <b>so</b> dry <b>that it can be crumbled with a fingernail.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this statement? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam? As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 37a): If a kosher firstborn animal has a blemish, such as a dried ear, it may be slaughtered outside the Temple. <b>What is a dried</b> ear? It is any ear <b>that if perforated does not bleed a drop. Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam says:</b> It must be <b>so dry that it can be crumbled with a fingernail.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara responds: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the statement is in accordance with the opinion of the <b>Rabbis. With regard to the ear of a firstborn, which is exposed to the wind,</b> the Rabbis hold that the animal <b>would not recover</b> if it is so dry that it does not bleed. <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>lung, which is not exposed to the wind,</b> the animal <b>would recover</b> unless it is so dry that it can be crumbled with a fingernail. <b>And Rava says: This lung that stands</b> before us <b>covered</b> in <b>scabs,</b> or covered in <b>black</b> marks, or covered in sores with different <b>appearances,</b> is nevertheless <b>kosher.</b>

### Part 11
§ <b>Ameimar says in the name of Rava: One may not compare cysts</b> of the lungs. If one finds a perforated cyst on the lung, but does not know whether it was perforated before or after slaughter, he may not perform a test by perforating another cyst in order to compare their appearances.

### Part 12
<b>And Rava says: These two lobes</b> of the lung <b>that adhere to one another</b> by thin strands <b>have no</b> need for <b>inspection,</b> since it is certain that these adhesions arose due to a perforation of the lung, rendering the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara adds: <b>And we said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to adhesions <b>that are out of order,</b> where a lobe adhered to a non-adjacent lobe. <b>But</b> with regard to adhesions that are <b>in order, that is their</b> normal manner of <b>growth,</b> and the animal is kosher.
