<b>into two words, conclude from it</b> that <b>they are two names,</b> prohibiting the egg as well.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> what about the name: <b>“Chedorlaomer”</b> (Genesis 14:4), <b>which the scribe splits in two</b> so that it appears as: Chedor Laomer? Is it <b>also</b> true there <b>that they are two names?</b> The verse is clearly referring to only one person. <b>They say</b> in response: <b>There,</b> with regard to Chedor Laomer, the scribe <b>splits</b> the name <b>into two words,</b> but he <b>may not split it into two lines</b> if the first half nears the end of one line. <b>But here, he may split</b> the name <i>bat ya’ana</i> <b>even into two lines,</b> indicating that they are completely separate.

### Part 3
§ The mishna states: <b>But the Sages stated</b> that <b>any bird</b> that claws its prey and eats it is non-kosher. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Gamliel says:</b> A bird that <b>claws</b> its prey <b>and eats</b> it <b>is certainly non-kosher.</b> If <b>it has an extra digit and a crop, and its gizzard can be peeled, it is certainly kosher. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: One stretches a line,</b> and the bird perches on it. <b>If it splits its feet</b> on the line, with <b>two</b> digits <b>here and two there,</b> it is <b>non-kosher.</b> If it places <b>three</b> digits <b>here and one there,</b> it is possibly <b>kosher. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Any bird that catches</b> food <b>out of the air is non-kosher.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara interjects: But the <b><i>tziparta</i> also catches</b> food out of the air, and it is kosher. <b>Abaye said: We say</b> this only for a bird that both <b>catches and eats</b> its food in the air. The <i>tziparta</i> lands before eating what it has caught.

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>Others say:</b> If a bird <b>dwells with non-kosher</b> birds, it is <b>non-kosher;</b> if it dwells <b>with kosher</b> birds, it is <b>kosher.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this last statement? Perhaps it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> It was <b>not for naught</b> that the <b><i>zarzir</i> went</b> to dwell <b>with the crow, but because it is</b> of the same <b>species.</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the opinion introduced with the words: Others say, is like that of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Eliezer and deem the <i>zarzir</i> kosher. The statement introduced with the words: Others say, is understood as follows: <b>We say</b> that a bird is non-kosher whenever it both <b>dwells</b> with a non-kosher bird <b>and resembles</b> it. The <i>zarzir</i>, though, does not resemble the crow.

### Part 7
§ The mishna states: <b>And with regard to grasshoppers, any</b> grasshopper <b>that has</b> four legs, and four wings, and two additional jumping legs, and whose wings cover most of its body, is kosher. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is considered <b>most of its</b> body? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Most of its length. And some say</b> that he said: <b>Most of its circumference. Rav Pappa said: Therefore,</b> one must satisfy both versions of the statement. <b>We require</b> that the wings cover <b>most of its length, and we</b> also <b>require</b> that they cover <b>most of its circumference.</b>

### Part 8
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A grasshopper that <b>has no</b> wings <b>now but will grow</b> them <b>after a time, e.g., the <i>zaḥal</i>, is permitted. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, says:</b> The verse states: “Yet these may you eat of all winged swarming things that go upon all fours, <b>which have [<i>lo</i>] jointed legs</b> above their feet, wherewith to leap upon the earth” (Leviticus 11:21). The word <i>lo</i> is written with the letter <i>alef</i>, meaning not, so that it can be understood as: Do not have jointed legs. This teaches that <b>even though it has no</b> jointed legs <b>now but will grow</b> them <b>after a time,</b> it is still kosher. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <b><i>zaḥal</i>? Abaye said:</b> It is called <b><i>askarin</i></b> in Aramaic.

### Part 9
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“These of them you may eat: The <i>arbeh</i></b> after its kinds, and the <i>solam</i> after its kinds, and the <i>ḥargol</i> after its kinds, and the <i>ḥagav</i> after its kinds” (Leviticus 11:22). The <b><i>arbeh</i> is</b> the insect known as the <b><i>govai</i>.</b> The <b><i>solam</i> is</b> the <b><i>rashon</i>.</b> The <b><i>ḥargol</i> is</b> the <b><i>nippul</i>.</b> The <b><i>ḥagav</i> is</b> the <b><i>gadyan</i>. Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “After its kinds,” “after its kinds,” “after its kinds,”</b> and <b>“after its kinds,” four times? It is to include</b> four similar species: The <b>vineyard bird, and</b> the <b>Jerusalem <i>yoḥana</i>, and the <i>artzuveya</i>, and the <i>razbanit</i>,</b> which are also kosher.

### Part 10
<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: These</b> appearances of the phrase “after its kinds” in the verse <b>are generalizations, and these</b> species mentioned explicitly <b>are details.</b> The verse must be understood in light of the previous verse, which offers general signs of a kosher grasshopper. The two verses together are a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, in the following manner: The first verse is a generalization, <b><i>arbeh</i> is</b> a detail referring to the species <b><i>govai</i>,</b> and the phrase <b>“after its kinds”</b> is another generalization. According to Rabbi Yishmael’s hermeneutical principles, the second generalization serves to include a case similar to the detail. In this case, the phrase “after its kinds” serves <b>to include</b>
