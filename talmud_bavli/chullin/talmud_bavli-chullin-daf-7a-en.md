### Part 1
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that in not eradicating the serpent, <b>his ancestors left</b> Hezekiah <b>room through which to achieve prominence [<i>lehitgader</i>]. I too</b> can say that <b>my ancestors left me room through which to achieve prominence</b> by permitting untithed produce from Beit She’an.

### Part 2
The Gemara adds: <b>From here</b> one learns with regard to <b>a Torah scholar who states</b> a new <b>matter of <i>halakha</i> that one does not move [<i>meziḥin</i>] him</b> from his position; <b>and some say: One does not disregard [<i>mazniḥin</i>] him; and some say: One does not attribute</b> his innovative statement <b>to his conceit [<i>mazḥiḥin</i>].</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>the one who says <i>meziḥin</i>,</b> it is <b>as that which is written: “And the breastplate shall not be loosed [<i>yizaḥ</i>] from the ephod”</b> (Exodus 28:28). <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the one who says: One does not disregard [<i>mazniḥin</i>],</b> it is <b>as it is written: “For the Lord will not abandon [<i>yizaḥ</i>] forever”</b> (Lamentations 3:31). <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the one who says <i>mazḥiḥin</i>,</b> it is <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sota</i> 14:9): <b>From</b> the time <b>that those with conceited [<i>zeḥuḥei</i>] hearts proliferated, dispute proliferated among the Jewish people.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, objects to</b> the basic <i>halakha</i>: <b>And is there anyone who says that Beit She’an is not</b> part <b>of Eretz Yisrael? But isn’t it written: “And Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth She’an and its towns, nor of Taanach and its towns”</b> (Judges 1:27).

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>That which Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim says in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat, who says in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua, escaped</b> the attention of Yehuda: <b>Many cities were conquered by those who ascended from Egypt</b> to Eretz Yisrael, led by Joshua, son of Nun, <b>and were not conquered by those who ascended from Babylonia</b> to Eretz Yisrael in the return to Zion led by Ezra. Among those cities was Beit She’an.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds: The initial consecration</b> with which Eretz Yisrael was sanctified during the era of Joshua, son of Nun, in terms of the obligation to fulfill land-based mitzvot, <b>sanctified</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>for its time but did not sanctify</b> it <b>forever.</b> Rather, the obligation lapsed with the exile to Babylonia. When those who ascended from Babylonia returned to Eretz Yisrael <b>and</b> sanctified the land, <b>they left</b> certain places unsanctified, <b>so that the poor would rely upon them</b> for sustenance <b>during the Sabbatical</b> Year, when produce is not plentiful. Since these areas were not sanctified, it is permitted to sow crops there during the Sabbatical Year, and the poor will not go hungry. Once Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi discovered that Beit She’an was one of those cities, he exempted it from land-based mitzvot.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira:</b> How did Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi rely on the testimony of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Zeruz to exempt from <i>terumot</i> and tithes produce that grows in Beit She’an? <b>But wasn’t it merely a leaf that Rabbi Meir ate?</b> It is permitted to eat untithed produce incidentally, not in the framework of a meal. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: He ate</b> the leaf <b>from a bundle, and we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 1:5): With regard to <b>a vegetable that is</b> typically <b>bound</b> in a bundle, one is obligated to separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes <b>from</b> the moment <b>that it is bound.</b> From that point, one may not eat from it even incidentally before tithing.

### Part 8
Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira: <b>And perhaps</b> it was <b>not on</b> Rabbi Meir’s <b>mind,</b> and his attention was diverted when he ate the leaf. Rabbi Zeira answered: <b>Now,</b> since even with regard to <b>the animals of the righteous, the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not generate mishaps through them,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> true that <b>the righteous themselves</b> would not experience mishaps?

### Part 9
Rabbi Yirmeya asked: <b>And perhaps</b> Rabbi Meir <b>tithed those</b> leaves <b>from</b> produce in <b>another place.</b> Rabbi Zeira answered: <b><i>Ḥaverim</i> are not suspected of separating <i>teruma</i> from</b> produce <b>that is not proximate</b> to the produce for which it is being separated. Rabbi Yirmeya asked: <b>And perhaps</b> Rabbi Meir <b>set his sight on this side</b> of the vegetable with the intent of separating <i>teruma</i> and tithes, <b>and ate</b> a leaf <b>on the other side.</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: See who the great man</b> is <b>who is testifying about</b> Rabbi Meir. Certainly a man of the stature of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Zeruz accurately observed and reported Rabbi Meir’s actions.

### Part 10
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the reference to <b>animals of the righteous,</b> about whom it is stated that God does not generate mishaps through them? It is based on the incident <b>where Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir was going to</b> engage in <b>the redemption of captives,</b> and <b>he encountered the Ginai River.</b>

### Part 11
<b>He said to</b> the river: <b>Ginai, part your water for me and I will pass through you.</b> The river <b>said to him: You are going to perform the will of your Maker and I am going to perform the will of my Maker,</b> to flow in my path. With regard to <b>you,</b> it is <b>uncertain</b> whether you will <b>perform</b> His will successfully, <b>and</b> it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>you</b> will <b>not perform</b> His will successfully. <b>I</b> will <b>certainly perform</b> His will successfully. Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said to</b> the river: <b>If you do not part, I</b> will <b>decree upon you that water will never flow through you.</b> The river <b>parted for him.</b>

### Part 12
There <b>was a certain man who was carrying wheat</b> for the preparation of <i>matza</i> <b>for Passover.</b> Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said to</b> the river: <b>Part</b> your waters <b>for that</b> person <b>too, as he is engaged in</b> the performance of <b>a mitzva.</b> The river <b>parted for him.</b> There <b>was a certain Arab [<i>taya’a</i>] who was accompanying them.</b> Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said to</b> the river: <b>Part</b> your waters <b>for that</b> person <b>too, so that he will not say: Is that</b> what <b>one does to a person who accompanies</b> him? The river <b>parted for him.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav Yosef said: How great is this man,</b> Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir, greater <b>than Moses and</b> the <b>six hundred thousand</b> who left Egypt, <b>as there,</b> at the Red Sea, the waters parted <b>one time, and here</b> the waters parted <b>three times.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And perhaps here too,</b> the waters parted <b>one time,</b> and the river began to flow again only after all three of them passed. <b>Rather,</b> this man was as great <b>as Moses and</b> the <b>six hundred thousand</b> children of Israel.

### Part 14
After crossing the river, Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>happened</b> to come <b>to a certain inn [<i>ushpiza</i>].</b> His hosts <b>cast barley before his donkey</b> for him to eat. The donkey <b>did not eat</b> it.
