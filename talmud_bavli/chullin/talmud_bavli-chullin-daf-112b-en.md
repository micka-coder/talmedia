### Part 1
Doing this will allow the blood dripping from the meat to stick to the salt on the sides of the vessel, while the fat will float to the top. <b>And</b> when emptying the receptacle, he should <b>tilt it</b> gently to pour the fat into another vessel without it mixing with the blood.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said to Rav Ashi: And did Shmuel</b> really <b>say this,</b> that once the meat’s ruddiness has dissipated it is permitted to place a receptacle underneath it? <b>But didn’t Shmuel say: It is prohibited to eat a loaf</b> of bread <b>upon which one cut</b> roasted <b>meat?</b> Apparently he holds that meat contains blood even after it has finished roasting. Rav Ashi replied: Shmuel holds that the meat no longer emits blood after its ruddiness has dissipated. And as for his ruling with regard to a loaf of bread, it <b>is different there, as due to the pressure of the knife</b> the meat <b>expels</b> more blood.

### Part 3
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> If <b>one salted fish and birds together,</b> the fish <b>are prohibited</b> for consumption due to the blood they absorb from the birds. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this ruling? <b>If</b> they were placed <b>in an unperforated vessel,</b> in which the blood emitted by the birds will pool, then <b>even</b> if one salted <b>a bird and</b> another <b>bird</b> together they should be <b>prohibited,</b> as the blood expelled from one bird will be absorbed by the other. And <b>if</b> the case involves <b>a perforated vessel,</b> out of which the blood can flow, then <b>even</b> if <b>fish</b> are salted with <b>birds</b> the fish should be <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the ruling is referring <b>to a perforated vessel. And</b> the <b>fish</b> are prohibited <b>because their skin is soft,</b> and therefore when they are salted <b>they expel</b> their blood <b>first, whereas</b> the skin of <b>birds</b> is <b>hard. After</b> the <b>fish finish</b> expelling their blood, the <b>birds</b> continue to <b>expel</b> their blood, <b>and then</b> the fish <b>absorb</b> blood <b>from them.</b> If one salts two birds together, they expel their blood simultaneously, and neither will absorb blood from outside while expelling its own.

### Part 5
The Gemara relates: <b>Meat of a slaughtered</b> animal <b>was salted for Rav Mari bar Raḥel together with</b> prohibited <b>meat of an animal that had a wound that would have caused it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> in a perforated vessel, as meat is generally salted. <b>He came before Rava</b> to ask whether the kosher meat was prohibited, as perhaps it would not have absorbed flavor from the non-kosher meat while itself expelling blood.

### Part 6
Rava <b>said to him:</b> When the verse states, with regard to forbidden foods: “These are <b>the unclean</b> to you” (Leviticus 11:31), the added definite article serves <b>to prohibit</b> not only their flesh but also <b>their juice</b> emitted by salting, <b>and their gravy, and their spices</b> with which they are cooked. Even while the kosher meat is emitting its blood, it still absorbs the juices of the non-kosher meat, which are absorbed more easily than blood.
