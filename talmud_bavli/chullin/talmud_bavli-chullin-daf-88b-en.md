<b>fine sawdust of carpenters, lime,</b> crushed <b>potsherd,</b> and <b>a brick</b> or the <b>lid</b> of an earthenware barrel <b>that one crushed? The verse states: “And cover it,”</b> i.e., with any substance. One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> will <b>include even thick manure, and thick sand, filings of metal vessels, a brick</b> or <b>a lid that one did not crush, flour, bran, and coarse bran.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And cover it <b>with earth,”</b> indicating that not all substances may be used to cover the blood.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you <b>to include these</b> substances <b>and to exclude those?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>After</b> noting <b>that the verse included</b> certain substances with the term: “And cover it,” <b>and excluded</b> others with the term: “With earth,” <b>I include these</b> substances, e.g., fine sand, <b>which are a type of earth</b> in which plants grow, <b>and I exclude those</b> substances, e.g., thick sand, <b>which are not a type of earth,</b> as plants do not grow in them.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: Why must the verse be interpreted in this manner? <b>Say</b> that the term: <b>“And cover it,”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> and the term: <b>“With earth,”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> Consequently, the verse constitutes <b>a generalization and a detail,</b> and according to the corresponding hermeneutical principle, <b>the generalization includes only what</b> is mentioned explicitly <b>in the detail.</b> Therefore, only <b>earth may</b> be used to cover the blood, while <b>any other</b> substance, even substances in which plants grow, may <b>not</b> be used.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Mari said</b> in response: One should not suggest such an interpretation <b>because</b> the term “and cover it” <b>is a generalization that requires a detail</b> to clarify its nature, <b>and any generalization that requires a detail</b> to clarify its nature <b>is not interpreted by</b> the hermeneutical principle of <b>a generalization and a detail.</b> It is necessary for the verse to state that the blood must be covered with earth in order to clarify that the mitzva of covering the blood is such that the blood must be covered with a substance that will absorb the blood, and that it does not suffice to place a vessel over it.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda taught: One may not cover</b> the blood of an undomesticated animal or a bird <b>except with a substance in which</b> seed is <b>sown and sprouts. Rava said: This</b> is <b>an absurdity [<i>burkha</i>],</b> as the mishna and <i>baraita</i> both teach that one may use substances in which seeds do not sprout.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: What is the absurdity</b> of <b>his</b> statement? <b>I said this</b> statement to Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda <b>and I said it to him from this <i>baraita</i>:</b> If one <b>is traveling in the desert,</b> where the earth is not arable, and wishes to slaughter an undomesticated animal or a bird, <b>but he does not have dirt</b> with which <b>to cover</b> the blood, <b>he may grind a gold dinar</b> into powder <b>and cover</b> the blood with it. If one <b>is traveling on a ship</b> and wants to slaughter an undomesticated animal or a bird <b>but he does not have earth</b> with which <b>to cover</b> the blood, <b>he may burn his garment and cover</b> the blood with the ashes. It is evident from the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> that desert sand, which does not allow for the sprouting of seeds, may not be used to cover the blood of an undomesticated animal or a bird.

### Part 7
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted,</b> it is understood that <b>one may burn his garment and cover</b> the blood with the ashes, since <b>we found</b> a source for the fact that <b>ashes are called earth [<i>afar</i>],</b> as the Gemara will soon prove; accordingly, the use of ashes is in accordance with the verse: “And cover it with earth.” <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a gold dinar, from where do we</b> derive that one may grind it into powder and use it to cover the blood? <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The verse states: <b>“And it has dust of [<i>afrot</i>] gold”</b> (Job 28:6), indicating that gold is referred to as dust.

### Part 8
The Gemara cites a related <i>baraita</i> in which <b>the Sages taught: One may not cover</b> the blood of an undomesticated animal or a bird <b>except with earth;</b> this is <b>the statement of Beit Shammai. And Beit Hillel say: We find that ashes are called dust [<i>afar</i>], as it is stated</b> with regard to the red heifer: <b>“And for the impure they shall take from the ashes [<i>me’afar</i>] of the burning of the purification from sin”</b> (Numbers 19:17). <b>And Beit Shammai</b> respond: Ashes are <b>called dust of the burning [<i>afar sereifa</i>],</b> but <b>they are not called ordinary dust [<i>afar</i>].</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara notes: It is <b>taught</b> that the Sages <b>added</b> the following <b>to the</b> list of substances in the mishna with which one may cover the blood: <b>Coal dust, stibium [<i>keḥol</i>], and shavings from chiseling. And some say</b> they included <b>even arsenic [<i>zarnikh</i>].</b>

### Part 10
§ The Gemara cites aggadic accounts relating to the mitzva of covering the blood: <b>Rava says: As reward</b> for that <b>which our Patriarch Abraham said: “And I am but dust [<i>afar</i>] and ashes”</b> (Genesis 18:27), <b>his children merited two mitzvot: The ashes of the</b> red <b>heifer</b> (see Numbers, chapter 19) <b>and the dust of the <i>sota</i>,</b> i.e., dirt taken from the ground of the Tabernacle that is mixed into the water that examines whether or not a woman committed adultery (see Numbers 5:17).

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges: <b>But let</b> Rava <b>also consider the earth</b> used in the mitzva of <b>covering the blood.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> the earth <b>does</b> serve as an <b>accessory to the mitzva</b> of covering the blood, but <b>there is no benefit</b> imparted by it. It occurs after the animal has been slaughtered and does not itself render the meat fit for consumption. By contrast, the ashes of the red heifer and the dust of the <i>sota</i> provide benefit, as the former purifies one who became ritually impure and the latter leads to peace between husband and wife when drinking the water proves that she did not commit adultery.

### Part 12
<b>And Rava says: As reward</b> for that <b>which our Patriarch Abraham said</b> to the king of Sodom:
