### Part 1
<b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya,</b> the reason for his ruling is that <b>it is written “it,” which indicates a male, and it is written “its offspring,”</b> teaching that the prohibition applies to <b>that</b> parent <b>whose offspring clings to it, which indicates a female. Therefore,</b> this prohibition <b>applies to both males and females.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya. And Shmuel follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 8:4): <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to two animals <b>that are born from</b> a female <b>horse, even if the father</b> of one is <b>a donkey</b> and the father of the other is a horse, <b>they are permitted</b> to mate <b>with one another.</b> Since the mothers of both are horses, the offspring are all considered of the same species. <b>But</b> to mate animals <b>that are born from</b> a female <b>donkey with</b> animals <b>that are born from</b> a female <b>horse,</b> even if one animal was born from a male horse and a female donkey and the other was born from a male donkey and a female horse, is <b>prohibited,</b> due to the prohibition of diverse kinds.

### Part 3
<b>And,</b> commenting on that mishna, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: This is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, who says: One</b> need <b>not be concerned with its paternity</b> in determining the species of an animal, as the species is determined solely by the mother. <b>But the Rabbis say:</b> The species of an animal is determined according to both its mother and its father. Therefore, <b>all types of mules,</b> regardless of which parent is a horse and which is a donkey, <b>are</b> considered <b>a single</b> species and may mate with each other.

### Part 4
Now, <b>whose</b> opinion is referred to as that of <b>the Rabbis</b> here? <b>It is</b> that of <b>Ḥananya, who says: One</b> needs <b>to be concerned with paternity,</b> as, in his opinion, the prohibition against slaughtering an animal and its offspring applies to a male and its offspring as well. <b>And</b> therefore, with regard to the prohibition of diverse kinds as well, <b>this</b> mule that is <b>the offspring of</b> a female <b>horse and</b> a male <b>donkey, and that</b> mule that is the <b>offspring of</b> a female <b>donkey and</b> a male <b>horse are all a single species.</b>

### Part 5
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Is Rabbi Yehuda certain that one</b> need <b>not be concerned with its paternity</b> in determining the species of the offspring, <b>or perhaps he is uncertain</b> whether or not one need be concerned with its paternity? The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: The practical difference is <b>with regard to permitting</b> the mating of <b>the offspring with</b> the species of <b>the mother,</b> e.g., the mating of the offspring of a female horse and a male donkey together with a horse. <b>If you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda is <b>certain</b> that one need not be concerned with its paternity, then the mating of <b>the offspring with</b> the species of <b>the mother is permitted,</b> as, in this case, they are both considered horses. <b>But if you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda is <b>uncertain,</b> then the mating of <b>the offspring with</b> the species of <b>the mother is prohibited,</b> as one must be concerned about the species of the father.

### Part 7
<b>What,</b> then, is the answer to the question? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a possible resolution from the mishna cited earlier: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: All that are born from</b> a female <b>horse, even if the father</b> of one <b>of them</b> is <b>a donkey, are permitted</b> to mate <b>with each other. What are the circumstances</b> here? <b>If we say that the father of this</b> male animal is <b>a donkey, and the father of that</b> female animal, with which the male is to be mated, is <b>a donkey,</b> does it <b>need to be said?</b> Since the mothers of both animals are horses, they are both of exactly the same species and may certainly mate with each other. <b>Rather, is it not that the father of this</b> one is <b>a horse, and the father of that</b> other one is <b>a donkey?</b>

### Part 8
<b>And</b> yet <b>it is taught</b> that <b>they are permitted</b> to mate <b>with each other. Evidently,</b> Rabbi Yehuda is <b>certain</b> that one need not be concerned with its paternity in determining the species of the offspring. If he were uncertain, he would deem their mating prohibited, as the father of one is a horse while the father of the other is a donkey.

### Part 9
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> one cannot cite proof from this, as it can be said <b>that actually, the father of this</b> male animal is <b>a donkey, and the father of that</b> female animal is also <b>a donkey. And</b> with regard to <b>that which you say:</b> Does it <b>need to be said</b> that these two may mate? It does need to be said, <b>lest you say: The horse component</b> of the male mule <b>comes</b> and <b>copulates with the donkey component</b> of the female mule, <b>and the donkey component</b> of the male mule <b>copulates</b> specifically <b>with the horse component</b> of the female mule, which would violate the prohibition of diverse kinds. Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda <b>teaches us</b> that they are both of the same species and may mate.

### Part 10
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a possible resolution from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>a female mule in heat, one may not mate a horse or a donkey with her,</b> due to the prohibition against crossbreeding diverse kinds of livestock. <b>Rather,</b> one mates her with <b>one of her kind,</b> another mule. <b>And if you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda is <b>certain</b> that one need not be concerned with its paternity in determining the species of the offspring, then why not <b>mate her with the species of her mother?</b> Evidently, Rabbi Yehuda is uncertain and therefore deems it prohibited to mate her with either a horse or a donkey. The Gemara responds: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where we do not know what the mother’s species is.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: Rather,</b> one mates her with <b>one of her kind,</b> indicating that her species is known. The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: One may not mate the species of a horse or the species of a donkey with her, because one does not</b> usually <b>know the species of</b> the mother of a mule that one encounters. The Gemara suggests: <b>But let one check</b> her species <b>by</b> her <b>distinguishing characteristics, as Abaye says:</b> If <b>its voice is deep,</b> it is <b>the offspring of a female donkey;</b> if <b>its voice is shrill,</b> it is <b>the offspring of a female horse. And Rav Pappa says:</b> If <b>its ears are large and its tail is small,</b> it is <b>the offspring of a female donkey;</b> if <b>its ears are small and its tail is large,</b> it is <b>the offspring of a female horse.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a mule who is <b>mute, and</b> whose ears and tail are <b>lopped off,</b> and whose species cannot be determined. Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion cannot be proven from this case.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about it? Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says: All,</b> including Rabbi Yehuda, <b>agree with regard to</b> mating <b>the offspring with</b> the species of <b>its mother that it is prohibited. Conclude from it</b> that Rabbi Yehuda is <b>uncertain.</b> If he were certain that one need not be concerned with its paternity, he would deem mating the offspring with the species of its mother permitted, since the father’s species would not matter. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that this is so.

### Part 13
The Gemara relates with regard to this issue that <b>Rabbi Abba said to his servant: If you bring me mules</b> attached <b>to a wagon [<i>rispak</i>], look for those that are similar to each other</b> in their voices and the sizes of their ears and tails, <b>and bring</b> those <b>for me,</b> in order not to violate the prohibition of diverse kinds. <b>Evidently,</b> Rabbi Abba <b>holds</b> that with regard to the offspring of diverse kinds, <b>one</b> need <b>not be concerned with its paternity,</b> since, as explained earlier, these distinguishing characteristics indicate only the species of the mother.
