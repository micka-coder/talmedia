### Part 1
<b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> hold? He holds that since the term: <b>Eating, is written with regard to</b> the sciatic nerve, and a significant act of eating is generally defined as eating an olive-bulk, one is liable only if he eats an olive-bulk. <b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive from this term? <b>That</b> usage of the term <b>eating</b> indicates <b>that</b> in a case where the sciatic nerve <b>contains four or five olive-bulks and</b> one <b>ate</b> only <b>one olive-bulk, he is liable.</b> Nevertheless, if one eats the entire sciatic nerve, he is liable even if it contains less than an olive-bulk.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> from where is it derived that one is liable for eating one olive-bulk of a larger sciatic nerve? He holds that it <b>is derived from</b> the phrase <b>“that is upon the spoon of the thigh,”</b> which indicates that even if one eats only the part of the sciatic nerve that is upon the spoon of the thigh, rather than the entire sciatic nerve, he is liable.

### Part 3
<b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> interpret that phrase? <b>That</b> phrase <b>is necessary to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> stated by <b>Shmuel, as Shmuel said: The Torah prohibits only</b> the part of the sciatic nerve <b>that is on the</b> rounded protrusion of flesh shaped like a <b>spoon. And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> hold with regard to the <i>halakha</i> stated by Shmuel? He derives from the fact that it <b>is written:</b> “The spoon of <b>the thigh,”</b> that the sciatic nerve <b>of the entire thigh</b> is forbidden, not just the part that is on the rounded protrusion of flesh shaped like a spoon.

### Part 4
<b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> interpret “the spoon of the thigh”? According to the Rabbis, <b>this</b> expression indicates that <b>the prohibition of</b> the sciatic nerve applies to the nerve <b>that extends</b> throughout <b>the entire thigh,</b> i.e., the inner nerve, which serves <b>to exclude the outer</b> nerve, <b>which is not</b> forbidden by Torah law; <b>but in fact,</b> only the part of the inner nerve <b>that is on the</b> protrusion of flesh shaped like <b>a spoon</b> is forbidden, not the entire inner nerve.

### Part 5
The Gemara objects: <b>But this</b> term <b>“spoon” is required to exclude</b> the sciatic nerve of <b>a bird, which does not have</b> a rounded protrusion on its thigh bone that can be described as the <b>spoon of the thigh,</b> as taught in the mishna (89b). The Gemara explains: There are <b>two</b> usages of the term <b>“spoon”</b> written in the verse, and therefore two separate <i>halakhot</i> can be derived from this term.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a thigh that was cooked</b> with <b>the sciatic nerve in it, if there is</b> enough of the sciatic nerve <b>in it</b> to <b>impart</b> its <b>flavor</b> to the thigh, the entire thigh <b>is forbidden</b> for consumption. <b>How does one measure</b> whether there is enough sciatic nerve to impart flavor to the meat of the entire thigh? One relates to it <b>as though</b> the sciatic nerve were <b>meat</b> imparting flavor <b>to a turnip.</b> If meat the volume of the sciatic nerve would impart flavor to a turnip the volume of the thigh when they were cooked together, then the entire thigh is forbidden.

### Part 7
With regard to <b>a sciatic nerve that was cooked with</b> other <b>sinews, when one identifies</b> the sciatic nerve and removes it, the other sinews are forbidden if the sciatic nerve was large enough to <b>impart flavor. And if</b> he does <b>not</b> identify it, <b>all</b> the sinews are <b>forbidden</b> because each one could be the sciatic nerve; <b>but the broth</b> is forbidden only if the sciatic nerve <b>imparts flavor</b> to the broth.

### Part 8
<b>And similarly,</b> in the case of <b>a piece of an animal carcass or a piece of non-kosher fish that was cooked with</b> similar <b>pieces</b> of kosher meat or fish, <b>when one identifies</b> the forbidden piece and removes it, the rest of the meat or fish is forbidden only if the forbidden piece was large enough to <b>impart flavor</b> to the entire mixture. <b>And if</b> he does <b>not</b> identify and remove the forbidden piece, <b>all</b> the pieces <b>are forbidden,</b> due to the possibility that each piece one selects might be the forbidden piece; <b>but the broth</b> is forbidden only if the forbidden piece <b>imparts flavor</b> to the broth.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that a thigh that was cooked with the sciatic nerve is forbidden if the nerve imparts flavor to the thigh. <b>Shmuel says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the thigh is entirely forbidden <b>only when it was cooked</b> with the sciatic nerve <b>inside it. But</b> if the sciatic nerve was <b>roasted inside</b> the thigh, one may <b>peel</b> away the meat <b>and eat</b> it <b>until he reaches the</b> sciatic <b>nerve,</b> and then he removes the nerve.

### Part 10
The Gemara challenges: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rav Huna say:</b> With regard to <b>a kid that was roasted with its</b> forbidden <b>fat, it is prohibited to eat</b> any part of the animal, <b>even from the top of its ear?</b> This proves that roasting, like cooking, spreads the flavor of the forbidden fat throughout the entire animal.
