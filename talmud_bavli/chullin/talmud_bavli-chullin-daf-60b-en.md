### Part 1
<b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa?</b> Shall one say that <b>since</b> the phrase <b>“after its kind” is not written</b> as a mitzva <b>with regard to them,</b> one is <b>not liable</b> for transgressing the prohibition against mixing diverse kinds? <b>Or perhaps, since</b> God <b>agreed with them</b> after the fact, as the verse states: “Let the Lord rejoice in His works,” <b>it is as if</b> the mitzva <b>“after its kind” is written with regard to them.</b> The Gemara responds: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 2
§ <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi raises a contradiction</b> between two verses. It <b>is written: “And God made the two great lights”</b> (Genesis 1:16), <b>and</b> it <b>is</b> also <b>written</b> in the same verse: <b>“The greater light</b> to rule the day, <b>and the lesser light</b> to rule the night,” indicating that only one was great. Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi explains: When God first created the sun and the moon, they were equally bright. Then, <b>the moon said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> is it <b>possible for two kings to serve with one crown?</b> One of us must be subservient to the other. God therefore <b>said to her,</b> i.e., the moon: If so, <b>go and diminish yourself.</b>

### Part 3
<b>She said before Him: Master of the Universe, since I said a correct</b> observation <b>before You,</b> must <b>I diminish myself?</b> God <b>said to her:</b> As compensation, <b>go and rule</b> both <b>during the day</b> along with the sun <b>and during the night. She said to Him: What is the greatness of</b> shining alongside the sun? <b>What use is a candle in the middle of the day?</b> God <b>said to her: Go; let the Jewish people count the days and years with you,</b> and this will be your greatness. <b>She said to Him: But</b> the Jewish people will count with <b>the sun as well,</b> as <b>it is impossible that they will not count seasons with it, as it is written: “And let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years”</b> (Genesis 1:14). God said to her: <b>Go; let righteous men be named after you.</b> Just as you are called the lesser [<i>hakatan</i>] light, there will be <b>Ya’akov HaKatan,</b> i.e., Jacob our forefather (see Amos 7:2), <b>Shmuel HaKatan</b> the <i>tanna</i>, and <b>David HaKatan,</b> i.e., King David (see I Samuel 17:14).

### Part 4
God <b>saw that</b> the moon <b>was not comforted. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Bring atonement for me, since I diminished the moon.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>And this is what Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: What is different</b> about the <b>goat</b> offering <b>of</b> the <b>New Moon, that</b> it <b>is stated with regard to it: “For the Lord”</b> (Numbers 28:15)? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: This goat shall be an atonement</b> for Me <b>for having diminished</b> the size of <b>the moon.</b>

### Part 5
§ <b>Rav Asi raises a contradiction</b> between two verses. It <b>is written: “And the earth brought forth grass”</b> (Genesis 1:12), <b>on the third day of the week</b> of Creation. <b>And</b> it <b>is</b> also <b>written: “No shrub of the field was yet in the earth”</b> (Genesis 2:5), <b>on Shabbat eve,</b> the sixth day of Creation, immediately before Adam was created. Rav Asi explains: This <b>teaches that the grasses emerged</b> on the third day <b>and stood at the opening of the ground,</b> but they did not grow <b>until Adam, the first</b> man, <b>came and prayed for mercy upon them, and rain came, and they sprouted.</b> And this is meant <b>to teach you that the Holy One, Blessed be He, desires the prayers of the righteous.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rav Naḥman bar Pappa had a certain garden. He planted seeds but they did not sprout. He prayed for mercy,</b> and <b>rain came, and</b> they <b>sprouted. He said: This is</b> what is meant by the statement <b>of Rav Asi,</b> that the Holy One, Blessed be He, desires the prayers of the righteous.

### Part 7
§ In one of the passages discussing kosher and non-kosher animals, the Torah states: “Nevertheless, these you shall not eat of them that only chew the cud, or of them that have split hooves that are cloven [<i>hashesua</i>]: The camel, and the hare, and the hyrax” (Deuteronomy 14:7). <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said: “<i>Hashesua</i>”</b> is not a redundant description of the split hooves but <b>a distinct creature, which has two backs and two spines</b> and therefore looks like an entirely cloven animal. One might ask: <b>But was Moses our teacher a hunter, or was he an archer,</b> who was familiar with the most exotic animals? Rather, <b>from here</b> there is <b>a refutation to those who say that the Torah is not from Heaven,</b> since Moses could not have known of the existence of such an animal save by divine revelation.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Taḥlifa bar Avina: Go write</b> this statement about the <b>hunter [<i>kinnigi</i>] and</b> the <b>archer [<i>ballisteri</i>] in your</b> book of <b><i>aggada</i>, and explain</b> those two words, since some are unfamiliar with them.

### Part 9
The Gemara relates another statement. The verse states: <b>“The five lords of the Philistines: The Gazite, and the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, and the Ekronite; also the Avvim”</b> (Joshua 13:3). The verse is difficult, since it first <b>said</b> there are <b>five</b> lords of the Philistines, <b>but it</b> then <b>lists six. Rabbi Yonatan said:</b> There were in fact six lords, but <b>the greatest of them</b> were only <b>five. Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Taḥlifa bar Avina: Write</b> this statement about <b>the greatest [<i>arunekei</i>] in your</b> book of <b><i>aggada</i>, and explain</b> that word. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this statement <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion <b>of Rav, as Rav says:</b> The <b>Avvim</b> were not Philistines; rather, they <b>came from Teiman.</b>

### Part 10
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>Avvim came from Teiman. And why were they called Avvim</b> and not Teimanim? <b>Because they corrupted [<i>ivvetu</i>]</b> and destroyed <b>their place</b> of origin when they left. <b>Alternatively,</b> they were called <b>Avvim since they desired [<i>ivvu</i>] many deities. Alternatively,</b> they were called <b>Avvim since</b> they were so fearsome that <b>all who saw them were seized by convulsions [<i>avit</i>]. Rav Yosef said: And each one of them has sixteen rows of teeth.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara cites another statement related to the Avvim: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> There are <b>many verses that</b> are seemingly <b>fit to be burned as books of the heretics,</b> since they appear redundant or frivolous, <b>and</b> yet <b>they are themselves the essence of Torah.</b> For example, the verse states: <b>“And the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza,</b> the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead” (Deuteronomy 2:23). <b>What</b> practical <b>difference</b> does this make <b>for us?</b>

### Part 12
The verse teaches the following: <b>Since Abimelech,</b> king of the Philistines, <b>administered an oath to Abraham: “That you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my grandson”</b> (Genesis 21:23), the Jewish people were prohibited from conquering the land of the Philistines until four generations had passed. Therefore, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Let</b> the <b>Caphtorim come</b> and <b>remove</b> the land <b>from</b> the <b>Avvim, who are</b> the same as the <b>Philistines, and let Israel come</b> and <b>remove</b> it <b>from the Caphtorim,</b> circumventing the prohibition.

### Part 13
<b>Similarly, you say</b> with regard to another apparently unnecessary verse, describing a city that the Israelites conquered: <b>“For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the</b> former <b>king of Moab,</b> and taken all his land out of his hand” (Numbers 21:26). <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> in knowing this information? It teaches <b>that</b> since <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Israel: “Be not at enmity with Moab”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:9), the Jewish people were prohibited from conquering the land of Moab. Therefore, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Let Sihon come</b> and <b>remove</b> the land <b>from Moab, and let Israel come</b> and <b>remove</b> it <b>from Sihon.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>And this is what Rav Pappa says:</b> The lands of <b>Ammon and Moab were purified by Sihon,</b> i.e., rendered permitted for conquest.

### Part 14
The Gemara cites another seemingly superfluous verse, describing Mount Hermon: <b>“Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion,</b> and the Amorites call it Senir” (Deuteronomy 3:9). A Sage <b>taught: Senir and Sirion are mountains of Eretz Yisrael.</b> The verse <b>teaches that every one of the nations of the world went and built itself a great city</b> on Mount Hermon, <b>and named it after</b> one of <b>the mountains of Eretz Yisrael, teaching you that even the mountains of Eretz Yisrael are beloved by the nations of the world.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Similarly,</b> a difficult verse describes Joseph’s treatment of the Egyptians: <b>“And as for the people, he removed them city by city”</b> (Genesis 47:21). <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> of this information? It teaches Joseph’s love for his brothers, as he transferred the entire Egyptian population <b>so that they would not call his brothers exiles.</b>

### Part 16
§ The mishna states: <b>The signs of the</b> kosher <b>bird were not</b> explicitly <b>stated</b> in the Torah. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it true that they were <b>not</b> stated in the Torah? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“The <i>nesher</i>”</b> (Leviticus 11:13) is a non-kosher bird.
