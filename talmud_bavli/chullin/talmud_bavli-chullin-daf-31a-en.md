### Part 1
<b>that the feathers</b> at the front of the neck were <b>unraveled</b> by the arrow, a clear indication that slaughter was performed from the front of the neck.

### Part 2
The Gemara notes another difficulty encountered in the slaughter of a flying bird with an arrow. <b>But doesn’t</b> the bird’s blood <b>require covering</b> with earth? <b>And if you would say that</b> Rabbi Yona bar Taḥlifa <b>covers</b> the blood, <b>but doesn’t Rabbi Zeira say</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In fulfilling the mitzva of covering the blood, <b>one who slaughters</b> an undomesticated animal or bird <b>must place earth beneath</b> the blood <b>and earth above</b> it, <b>as it is stated:</b> “He shall spill its blood, <b>and cover it in earth”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). <b>It is not stated:</b> Cover it with <b>earth, but rather “in earth</b>.” This <b>teaches that one who slaughters must place earth beneath</b> the blood <b>and earth above</b> the blood, so that the blood will be within the earth.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers <b>that</b> Rabbi Yona bar Taḥlifa would <b>designate for himself</b> the <b>earth of the entire valley [<i>patka</i>]</b> before shooting the arrow. That earth would serve as the layer of earth beneath the blood and he would proceed to cover the blood with another layer of earth.

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches: In a case where <b>one was</b> in the process of <b>slaughtering</b> the animal in the standard manner <b>and he decapitated</b> the animal in one motion, if the length of the knife is equivalent to the breadth of the animal’s entire neck, the slaughter is valid. <b>Rabbi Zeira says:</b> The knife must be equivalent to <b>the</b> breadth of the animal’s <b>entire neck and</b> extend <b>beyond the neck.</b>

### Part 5
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Did Rabbi Zeira mean: Equivalent to the breadth of the animal’s <b>entire neck and</b> extend <b>beyond the neck</b> by an amount equivalent to the breadth of the <b>entire neck,</b> in which case the length of the knife <b>would</b> equal the breadth of <b>two necks? Or perhaps</b> he meant: Equivalent to the breadth of the <b>entire neck and beyond the neck</b> by <b>any amount?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof to resolve the dilemma from the continuation of the mishna: If <b>one was</b> in the process of <b>slaughtering</b> two animals simultaneously, <b>and he decapitated two heads in one</b> motion, <b>if</b> the length <b>of the knife</b> is equivalent to the breadth of <b>an entire neck</b> of <b>one</b> of the animals the slaughter is <b>valid.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: The breadth of <b>an entire neck</b> of <b>one</b> of the animals? <b>If we say</b> that it means the breadth of <b>one entire neck and nothing more,</b> that is difficult. <b>Now,</b> for the slaughter <b>of one animal, we require</b> that the knife be equivalent to the breadth of the animal’s <b>entire neck and</b> extend <b>beyond the neck;</b> for the slaughter <b>of two animals,</b> is it possible that a knife whose length is equivalent to the breadth of <b>one</b> animal’s <b>entire neck would be sufficient? Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that it means that the length of the knife must be equivalent to the breadth of <b>one entire neck beyond the</b> breadth of <b>two necks.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests: <b>Learn from</b> the mishna that Rabbi Zeira means that the length of the knife must be equivalent to the breadth of the animal’s entire neck and extend <b>beyond the neck</b> by the breadth of the <b>entire neck.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that this was Rabbi Zeira’s intent.

### Part 8
§ The mishna continues: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is <b>when one drew</b> the knife <b>back and did not draw</b> it <b>forth,</b> or drew it forth and did not draw it back. But if he drew it back and forth, even if the knife was of any length, even if he slaughtered with a scalpel, the slaughter is valid. <b>Rav Menashe said:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>in</b> the case of <b>a scalpel that does not have protrusions</b> from the sides. If there are protrusions, since the scalpel is short, there is concern that the corners may perforate the <i>simanim</i> or enter between the <i>simanim</i> and invalidate the slaughter.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Menashe: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to slaughter with <b>a needle?</b> Rav Menashe <b>said to him: A needle pierces</b> the <i>simanim</i>, as it perforates the neck instead of cutting it.

### Part 10
Rav Aḥa then asked Rav Menashe: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to slaughtering with <b>a cobbler’s needle,</b> which is flat and has sharp sides? Rav Menashe <b>said to him: We</b> already <b>learn</b> in the mishna: <b>Even</b> if the knife was of <b>any length,</b> the slaughter is valid. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to slaughter with <b>a cobbler’s needle?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>No.</b> The reference is to slaughtering with <b>a scalpel,</b> which is larger than a cobbler’s needle. The Gemara objects: The <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the case of <b>a scalpel explicitly</b> in the mishna. Therefore, the phrase in the mishna: A knife of any length, must be referring to an item smaller than a scalpel. The Gemara explains: The subsequent mention of the scalpel <b>is explaining</b> the phrase: Even if the knife was of any length. <b>What is</b> the knife of <b>any length</b> with which slaughter is valid? It is <b>a scalpel.</b>

### Part 11
<b>This too stands to reason, as, if it enters your mind</b> that the phrase: A knife of any length, is referring to <b>a cobbler’s needle, now</b> that it is <b>permitted</b> to slaughter with <b>a cobbler’s needle, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> for the <i>tanna</i> to teach that it is permitted to slaughter with <b>a scalpel,</b> which is larger than a cobbler’s needle? The Gemara rejects that reasoning: It <b>is necessary</b> for the mishna to teach both the case of a cobbler’s needle and the case of <b>a scalpel,</b> as it could <b>enter your mind to say</b> that it is prohibited to slaughter with a scalpel even though it is permitted to slaughter with a cobbler’s needle. The reasoning for this distinction would be: <b>Let</b> the Sages <b>issue a decree</b> prohibiting the use of <b>a scalpel with no protrusions due to</b> the prohibition against using <b>a scalpel with protrusions.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that there is no decree and it is permitted to slaughter with a scalpel that has no protrusions.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>a knife fell and slaughtered</b> an animal, <b>although</b> the knife <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>in the standard manner,</b> the slaughter is <b>not valid, as it is stated: “And you shall slaughter…and you shall eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:7), from which it is derived: <b>That which you slaughter you may eat,</b> and that which was slaughtered on its own, you may not eat.

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if a knife fell and slaughtered an animal the slaughter is not valid. The Gemara notes: <b>The reason</b> the slaughter is not valid is <b>that</b> the knife <b>fell. But</b> by inference, if <b>one dropped</b> the knife the slaughter is <b>valid, and</b> that is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though</b> when dropping the knife he <b>did not intend</b> to slaughter the animal.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who holds <b>that we do not require intent for slaughter? Rava said:</b> It <b>is Rabbi Natan, as Oshaya, the youngest of the company</b> of Sages, <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one threw a knife to embed it in the wall and</b> in the course of its flight the knife <b>went and slaughtered</b> an animal <b>in its</b> proper <b>manner, Rabbi Natan deems</b> the slaughter <b>valid and the Rabbis deem</b> the slaughter <b>not valid.</b> Oshaya <b>teaches</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>and he says</b> about <b>it:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan</b> that there is no need for intent to perform a valid act of slaughter.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rava</b> already <b>say it one time</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Natan? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (2a): <b>And</b> with regard to <b>any of them,</b> a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, <b>who slaughtered</b> an animal <b>and others see</b> and supervise <b>them, their slaughter is valid</b> even though they are incapable of intent. <b>And we said: Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who holds <b>that we do not require intent for slaughter? And Rava said:</b> It <b>is Rabbi Natan.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: Both statements <b>are necessary. As had</b> Rava <b>taught us</b> his statement <b>there</b> with regard to a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, one would have thought that the slaughter is valid <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> although the individual lacks intent to slaughter the animal, <b>he intends</b> his action <b>for the sake of cutting in general. But here,</b> with regard to throwing a knife at the wall, <b>where he does not intend</b> to cut at all, <b>say no,</b> the slaughter is not valid.

### Part 17
<b>And had</b> Rava <b>taught us</b> his statement <b>here</b> with regard to throwing the knife, one would have thought that the slaughter is valid is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> it <b>comes due to</b> the action <b>of a mentally competent person. But there,</b> with regard to slaughter by a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, <b>where</b> the slaughter <b>does not come due to</b> the action <b>of a mentally competent person, say</b> that the slaughter is <b>not</b> valid. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for Rava to teach both cases.

### Part 18
§ The mishna is now cited as proof in an amoraic dispute. <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>a menstruating woman who,</b> after the menstrual flow ended, <b>was compelled</b> against her will <b>and immersed</b> in a ritual bath, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: She is ritually pure vis-à-vis her house,</b> i.e., it is permitted for her to engage in intercourse with her husband, <b>but it is prohibited for her to partake of <i>teruma</i></b> because the immersion is not considered valid for that purpose. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: She was not purified even vis-à-vis her house.</b>

### Part 19
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who says</b> that <b>she is ritually pure vis-à-vis her house but it is prohibited for her to partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> it is difficult. With regard to <b>a transgression</b> punishable <b>by <i>karet</i>,</b> i.e., intercourse with a menstruating woman, <b>she was rendered permitted</b> by immersion against her will; with regard to partaking of <i>teruma</i>, <b>a prohibition</b> punishable by <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, which is a lesser punishment, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that it is permitted for her through immersion against her will? Why then does Rav deem it prohibited for her to partake of <i>teruma</i>?

### Part 20
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> The halakhic status of <b>her husband is non-sacred, and non-sacred</b> items <b>do not require intent</b> for purification. <b>And from where do you say</b> so? It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 5:6): In the case of <b>a wave that was detached</b> from the sea, <b>and in it</b> were <b>forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water, <b>and</b> that wave <b>fell on</b> an impure <b>person or on</b> impure <b>vessels, they are ritually pure. What, is it not</b> that <b>a person</b> is <b>similar to vessels? Just as vessels do not intend</b> to be purified and they are purified by the wave, <b>so too, a person does not require intent</b> in order to be purified.

### Part 21
The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>From where</b> is there proof that this is the meaning of the mishna? <b>Perhaps we are dealing with</b> the case of one who <b>sits</b> near the water <b>and waits</b> to determine <b>when the wave will be detached,</b> which is tantamount to having intent to immerse,
