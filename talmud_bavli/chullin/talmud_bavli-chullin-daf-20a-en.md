### Part 1
<b>And if it enters your mind that</b> the mitzva is <b>specifically</b> to <b>move</b> the <i>simanim</i> behind the nape and pinch them, <b>why</b> did the <i>tanna</i> say <b>specifically</b> that if one <b>pinches</b> in this manner it is valid? <b>Even</b> if <b>one slaughters</b> from the nape in this manner the slaughter would be valid. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from it</b> that the proper understanding is: One may <b>even move</b> the <i>simanim</i> behind the nape and pinch, <b>and the mishna is</b> referring to a case <b>where one did not move</b> the <i>simanim</i> behind the nape.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yannai says: The young ones [<i>rovin</i>],</b> the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya, <b>shall receive their response</b> that rejects their statement from <b>that</b> which <b>is taught</b> in the mishna: <b>It is found that</b> that which is <b>valid for slaughter</b> is <b>not valid for pinching and</b> that which is <b>valid for pinching</b> is <b>not valid for slaughter. What</b> does this statement serve <b>to exclude?</b> Does it <b>not</b> serve <b>to exclude</b> the case where <b>one moves the <i>simanim</i> behind the nape,</b> teaching <b>that</b> it is valid only for slaughter and <b>not</b> for pinching?

### Part 3
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: No,</b> perhaps it serves <b>to exclude</b> one who uses <b>a tooth or a fingernail</b> that is not detached, which are valid for pinching and not valid for slaughter. The Gemara objects: That could not be, as the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches explicitly</b> the case of <b>a tooth and a fingernail</b> in a mishna (15b), and there was no need to repeat it.

### Part 4
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> The statement of the mishna: That which is valid for slaughter is not valid for pinching, serves <b>to exclude drawing back and forth.</b> One who pinches may not cut the <i>simanim</i> by drawing his fingernail back and forth. Rather, he must press and cut them in one motion. The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says: Drawing back and forth for pinching is not valid, but according to the one who says:</b> It is <b>valid, what is there to say?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya hold in accordance with the one who says: Drawing back and forth for pinching is not valid.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Kahana says: The mitzva of pinching</b> is that <b>one cuts</b> with his fingernail from the nape <b>and continues downward, and that is its mitzva. Rabbi Avin thought to say: Cuts and continues downward, yes; draws back and forth, no. Rabbi Yirmeya said to him: All the more so that drawing back and forth for pinching is valid.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>That is its mitzva,</b> which indicates that it is specifically in that manner? The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that it means: <b>That too is its mitzva.</b>

### Part 6
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Any</b> place <b>that is valid for slaughter</b> on the throat <b>is correspondingly valid for pinching</b> on the nape. By inference, any place on the throat that <b>is not valid for slaughter is not valid for pinching.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does this statement serve <b>to exclude? If we say</b> that it serves <b>to exclude ripping</b> the <b><i>simanim</i></b> from their place before cutting them, which is invalid with regard to pinching just as with regard to slaughter, <b>but didn’t Rami bar Yeḥezkel teach:</b> There is <b>no</b> disqualification of <b>ripping</b> the <b><i>simanim</i> in</b> the case of <b>a bird?</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It serves <b>to exclude</b> pinching the occipital bone at the back of <b>its head;</b> just as it is not the place of slaughter, it is not the place of pinching. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that pinching at the back of <b>its head</b> is not valid? <b>The Merciful One states: “Adjacent to its nape,” and not at its head.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is <b>its head</b> that is not the place for pinching? It is <b>the incline of its head,</b> e.g., in a case <b>where one began at the incline of its head and diverted and continued until he reached below</b> to the place of the <i>simanim</i>, where he completed the pinching. Since he began the process in the incorrect location, it is invalid, similar to slaughter. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>that Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav Asi says, as Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says:</b> If <b>one diverted</b> the knife upward and cut <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe <b>and</b> then <b>cut two-thirds</b> within the ring, the slaughter is <b>not valid.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> With regard to <b>that which Rami bar Yeḥezkel teaches:</b> There is <b>no</b> disqualification for <b>ripping <i>simanim</i> in a bird, we say</b> it <b>only according to the one who says: There is no</b> source for the <b>slaughter of a bird in the Torah.</b>
