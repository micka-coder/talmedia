### Part 1
If one <b>ate a kosher bird alive,</b> one is punished with lashes <b>for any amount,</b> i.e., even if he ate less than an olive-bulk. If the bird <b>was dead</b> and was not ritually slaughtered, one is punished with lashes only if he ate <b>an olive-bulk. And</b> if one ate a whole bird of <b>a non-kosher</b> species, <b>whether</b> he ate it <b>when it was alive or dead,</b> he is punished with lashes <b>for any amount,</b> i.e., even if the bird contained less than an olive-bulk of meat. The Gemara answers: <b>Here also</b> explain that Rav’s statement is referring to a case <b>of</b> eating <b>a small amount of meat</b> along with <b>sinews and bones,</b> and the total volume is an olive-bulk.

### Part 2
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another challenge based upon a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who <b>took</b> a live <b>bird</b> of a kosher species <b>that did not have</b> a volume of <b>an olive-bulk and ate it, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>exempts</b> him from lashes <b>and Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon deems</b> him <b>liable</b> for lashes. <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, said:</b> He should be liable based upon <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: If one <b>is liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for</b> eating <b>a limb of</b> a living animal, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that one is liable to receive lashes <b>for</b> eating <b>all of it?</b> The <i>baraita</i> concludes: With regard to one who <b>strangled</b> the bird <b>and ate it, everyone agrees</b> that he is liable to receive lashes only if it had the volume <b>of an olive-bulk.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>disagree only with regard to</b> one who ate an entire live bird, <b>as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that even <b>during its life</b> all creatures <b>stand</b> to be divided <b>into limbs,</b> i.e., they will ultimately be cut into pieces. Consequently, each of its limbs is considered a separate entity, and even if one eats a limb without first separating it from the rest of the body, one violates the prohibition of eating a limb from a living being. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that <b>during its life</b> it <b>does not stand</b> to be divided <b>into limbs.</b> Therefore, one does not violate the prohibition of eating a limb from a living being unless he severs a limb from the body.

### Part 4
But <b>in any event, everyone</b> agrees that <b>we do not require</b> one to eat <b>an olive-bulk</b> of meat in order to be liable for lashes for eating a limb from a living being, which is the basis of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon. <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> in response: Explain that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> one ate <b>a small amount of meat</b> together with <b>sinews and bones,</b> making a total of an olive-bulk.

### Part 5
The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>But is there any</b> bird <b>that does not have an olive-bulk of meat in its whole</b> body, <b>but in one limb it has an olive-bulk</b> of the combination of <b>a small amount of meat</b> together with <b>sinews and bones? Rav Sherevya said: Yes,</b> this is the case <b>with regard to</b> the <b><i>kelanita</i>,</b> a bird that is very small and scrawny.

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges this answer that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a <i>kelanita</i>. <b>Say the latter clause:</b> With regard to one who <b>strangled</b> the bird <b>and ate it, everyone agrees</b> that he is liable to receive lashes only if it had the volume of <b>an olive-bulk. But a <i>kelanita</i> is a non-kosher bird, and Rav says:</b> If one eats a whole <b>non-kosher</b> bird, <b>whether</b> he eats it <b>when it is alive or dead,</b> he is punished with lashes <b>for</b> eating <b>any amount.</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is not referring to an actual <i>kelanita</i>, but <b>rather</b> to a kosher species of bird <b>similar</b> to <b>a <i>kelanita</i></b> in that it is small and scrawny.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara above cited a dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, with regard to one who eats an entire live kosher bird that is less than an olive-bulk. With regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that an entire bird is not considered to be a limb and is therefore not included in the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal, <b>Rava said: If you say</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that <b>thought</b> with regard to <b>food is considered thought,</b> i.e., one’s thoughts have halakhic significance in determining a food’s status, then in a case where one <b>thought to eat</b> the bird <b>limb</b> by <b>limb, and</b> instead <b>ate it all</b> at once, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would hold that he is <b>liable</b> for transgressing the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal.

### Part 8
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>But is there anything</b> with regard to which <b>if another</b> person <b>ate it he would not be liable, but</b> if <b>this</b> person <b>ate it he is liable?</b> Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: There can be different outcomes for different people who perform the same act, as <b>this</b> individual’s action is judged <b>according to his thought and that</b> individual’s action is judged <b>according to his thought.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And Rava</b> also <b>said: If you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that <b>thought</b> with regard to <b>food is considered thought,</b> then in a case where one at first <b>intended to eat</b> the entire bird after it had <b>died, but</b> ultimately he <b>ate it alive,</b> Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon would hold that he is <b>exempt</b> from lashes, as according to his thought it does not stand to be divided into limbs while alive.

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>But is there anything that if another</b> person <b>ate it he would be liable, but if</b> this person <b>ate it he is exempt?</b> Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>This</b> individual’s action is judged <b>according to his thought and that</b> individual’s action is judged <b>according to his thought.</b>

### Part 11
§ The Gemara discusses the source of the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: “You shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23); <b>this</b> is the source for the prohibition of eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal. And the verse: <b>“And you shall not eat any flesh that is torn in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30); <b>this</b> is the source for the prohibition of eating <b>flesh</b> severed <b>from the living and flesh</b> severed <b>from a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> even if it is not an entire limb.

### Part 12
<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: “You shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23); <b>this</b> is the source for the prohibitions of eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal <b>and</b> of eating <b>flesh</b> severed <b>from the living.</b> And the verse: <b>“And you shall not eat any flesh that is torn in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30); <b>this</b> is the source for the prohibition of eating <b>flesh</b> severed <b>from a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara clarifies the difference between these two opinions. If one <b>ate a limb from a living</b> animal <b>and flesh</b> severed <b>from the living,</b> then <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan he is liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes but <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish he is liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes. Conversely, if one <b>ate flesh</b> severed <b>from the living and flesh</b> severed <b>from a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> then <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish he is liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes but <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan he is liable to</b> receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes. If one <b>ate a limb from a living</b> animal <b>and flesh</b> severed <b>from a <i>tereifa</i>, everyone agrees</b> that he is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes.

### Part 14
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to the claim that everyone agrees that one who eats both a limb from a living animal and flesh severed from a <i>tereifa</i> is liable to receive two sets of lashes, based upon the following statement:
