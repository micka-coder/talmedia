<b>recoil [<i>soledet</i>] from</b> the water’s heat. <b>But</b> if <b>the hand recoils from it, one may not wash with it.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And there are those who teach</b> a version of <b>this</b> statement <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: For <b>final</b> waters, <b>one may wash only with cold</b> water, <b>but</b> one may <b>not</b> wash <b>with hot</b> water. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai says: They taught</b> that one may not use hot water <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the water is so hot that <b>the hand recoils from it, but if the hand does not recoil from it, one may wash</b> with it. The Gemara comments: One can learn <b>by inference</b> from this version of the statement <b>that</b> in the case of <b>first</b> waters, <b>even if</b> the water is so hot that <b>the hand recoils from it,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to use it for washing.

### Part 3
§ The <i>baraita</i> states that <b>middle</b> waters are <b>optional. Rav Naḥman says: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> with regard to washing the hands <b>between</b> one <b>cooked dish and</b> another <b>cooked dish</b> served at a meal. <b>But between a cooked dish and cheese</b> there is <b>an obligation</b> to wash one’s hands.

### Part 4
§ The <i>baraita</i> further teaches that final waters are an obligation. <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: For what</b> reason did the Sages <b>say that final waters are an obligation?</b> It is <b>because Sodomite salt is</b> sometimes <b>present,</b> a small amount of <b>which blinds the eyes.</b> Since Sodomite salt could remain on one’s hands, one must wash them after eating. <b>Abaye said: And</b> this type of dangerous salt <b>is present</b> in the proportion of <b>a pinch</b> [<b><i>korta</i></b>] <b>in</b> an entire <b><i>kor</i></b>  of regular salt. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> If one <b>measured salt</b> between meals, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Must he wash his hands afterward? <b>He said to him: It is not necessary</b> to say this; he is certainly obligated to do so.

### Part 5
§ <b>Abaye said: At first I would say</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that one may not wash</b> his hands with <b>final waters over the ground</b> is <b>due to messiness.</b> But the <b>Master,</b> Rabba, <b>said to me</b> that it is <b>because an evil spirit rests upon</b> the water and passersby are liable to be afflicted.

### Part 6
<b>And Abaye</b> also <b>said: At first I would say</b> that the reason for <b>this</b> statement of the Sages <b>that one should not take anything from the table when a person is holding a cup to drink,</b> is <b>lest a mishap occur at the meal,</b> i.e., the one holding the cup might have wanted the item that was taken, and since he is unable to speak he will choke in his anger. But <b>the Master</b> subsequently <b>said to me</b> that it is <b>because it is bad for</b> one’s health, causing <b>a spirit of</b> pain in <b>half</b> his head, i.e., a migraine.

### Part 7
<b>And we said</b> that this practice is prohibited <b>only if one takes</b> an item from the table <b>and does not put</b> it <b>back. But</b> as for <b>taking and putting back, we have no</b> problem <b>with it. And</b> likewise, <b>we said</b> it is prohibited <b>only</b> if one takes the item <b>beyond four cubits</b> of the table. <b>But</b> if one leaves it <b>within four cubits, we have no</b> problem <b>with it. And</b> furthermore, <b>we said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to <b>an item that is necessary for the meal. But</b> in the case of <b>an item that is not necessary for the meal, we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara relates that <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi was particular</b> not to remove any object from the table when someone was holding his cup in hand, <b>even with regard to a mortar [<i>asita</i>] and pestle [<i>bukhna</i>] for spices,</b> like all <b>items that are necessary for the meal.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And Abaye</b> further <b>said: At first I would say</b> that <b>this</b> practice <b>that</b> people <b>collect the crumbs</b> of bread after a meal is <b>due to cleanliness.</b> But <b>the Master</b> subsequently <b>said to me</b> that it is <b>because</b> leaving them <b>is bad for,</b> i.e., it can increase, a person’s vulnerability to <b>poverty.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who was pursued by the ministering angel of poverty, but</b> the angel <b>was unable to</b> impoverish <b>him, as he was exceptionally careful with regard to crumbs. One day</b> that man <b>broke</b> his <b>bread over grass,</b> and some crumbs fell among the blades of grass. The angel <b>said: Now he will certainly fall into my hands,</b> as he cannot collect all the crumbs. <b>After</b> the man <b>ate, he brought a hoe, uprooted the grass,</b> and <b>threw it into the river.</b> He subsequently <b>heard</b> the ministering angel of poverty <b>say: Woe</b> is me, <b>as that man has removed me from my house,</b> i.e., my position of comfort.

### Part 11
<b>And Abaye said: At first I would say</b> that <b>this</b> practice <b>that</b> people <b>do not drink the foam</b> from the top of a beverage is followed <b>because</b> it is <b>repulsive.</b> But <b>the Master said to me</b> that it is followed <b>because it is bad for</b> one’s vulnerability to <b>catarrh.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Drinking it is bad for catarrh,</b> while <b>blowing</b> off the foam from the drink <b>is bad for head</b> pains, and <b>removing it</b> with one’s hand <b>is bad for poverty.</b> If so, <b>what is its remedy?</b> How may one drink? He <b>should sink</b> the foam inside the beverage and then drink it.

### Part 12
The Gemara notes: The treatment <b>for catarrh</b> caused by the foam <b>of wine</b> is <b>beer;</b> the treatment for catarrh caused by the foam <b>of beer</b> is <b>water;</b> and for catarrh caused by the foam <b>of water there is no remedy. And this</b> is in accordance with the adage <b>that people say: Poverty follows the poor.</b> Not only does a pauper have nothing to drink other than water, but there also is no treatment for the disease caused by his beverage.

### Part 13
<b>And Abaye said: At first I would say</b> that the reason for <b>this</b> practice <b>that</b> people <b>do not eat vegetables from a bundle tied by the gardener</b> is <b>because it has the appearance of gluttony,</b> as he does not wait to untie the bundle to eat. But <b>the Master said to me</b> that it is <b>because</b> it <b>is bad for</b> one’s vulnerability to <b>witchcraft.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna were traveling on a boat. A certain matron said to them: Seat me together with you</b> on the boat, but <b>they did not seat her</b> alongside them. <b>She said something,</b> an incantation, and thereby <b>tied the boat</b> to its spot so that it could not move. <b>They</b> too <b>said something and</b> thereby <b>released it.</b> That matron <b>said to them: What can I do to you?</b> Witchcraft has no power over you, <b>as</b> after attending to your bodily functions, <b>you do not wipe yourselves with an earthenware shard, and you do not kill a louse</b> that you find <b>on your garments, and you do not eat vegetables from a bundle tied by the gardener.</b>

### Part 15
<b>And Abaye said: At first I would say</b> as follows: The reason for <b>this</b> practice <b>that</b> people <b>do not eat vegetables that fell on the table</b> is <b>because</b> it is <b>replusive.</b> But <b>the Master said to me</b> that it is <b>because it is bad for halitosis. And Abaye said: At first I would say</b> that the reason for <b>this</b> practice <b>that</b> people <b>do not sit under a gutter</b> is <b>because</b> of the <b>waste water</b> that pours out of it. But <b>the Master said to me</b> that it is <b>because demons are</b> commonly <b>found</b> there.

### Part 16
The Gemara relates: There were <b>certain porters who were carrying a barrel of wine.</b> When <b>they wanted to rest, they placed it under a gutter</b> and the barrel <b>burst. They came before Mar bar Rav Ashi,</b> who <b>brought out horns and</b> had them blown as he <b>excommunicated</b> the demon of that place. The demon <b>came before</b> Mar bar Rav Ashi, and the Sage <b>said to it: Why did you do this?</b> The demon <b>said to him: How</b> else <b>should I act, when</b> these men <b>place</b> a barrel <b>on my ear?</b>

### Part 17
Mar bar Rav Ashi <b>said to it: What are you doing in a place where many</b> people <b>are found? You are the one who deviated</b> from the norm; <b>go</b> and <b>pay</b> them the value of the barrel of wine. The demon <b>said to him: Let the Master now set a time for me,</b> so that I can find the money, <b>and I will pay.</b> Mar bar Rav Ashi <b>set a time for</b> his payment. <b>When</b> that <b>time arrived,</b> the demon <b>delayed</b> in coming to pay. <b>When</b> the demon eventually <b>came,</b> Mar bar Rav Ashi <b>said to it: Why did you not come at</b> the <b>time</b> set for <b>you?</b> The demon <b>said to him:</b> With regard to <b>any item that is tied up, or sealed, or measured, or counted, we have no authority to take it.</b> We are unable to obtain money <b>until we find an ownerless item.</b> For this reason, it took him a long time to find enough money to pay for the barrel.

### Part 18
<b>And Abaye said: At first I would say</b> that <b>this</b> practice <b>that</b> people <b>pour out</b> a little <b>water from the mouth of a pitcher</b> before drinking from it is followed <b>because of twigs</b> it might contain. But <b>the Master said to me</b> that it is followed <b>because there are foul waters</b> in the pitcher.

### Part 19
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain son of a demon that was in Rav Pappa’s house</b> as a servant. It <b>went to bring water from the river,</b> and <b>it delayed</b> in returning. <b>When it came,</b> the members of Rav Pappa’s household <b>said to it: Why did you delay? It said to them:</b> I waited <b>until the foul waters passed. In the meantime,</b>
