### Part 1
<b>“That</b> I will not take <b>a thread nor a shoe strap</b> nor anything that is yours” (Genesis 14:23), distancing himself from anything not rightfully his, <b>his children merited two mitzvot: The thread of sky-blue wool</b> worn on ritual fringes <b>and the strap of phylacteries.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, the strap of</b> the <b>phylacteries</b> imparts benefit, <b>as it is written: “And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon you;</b> and they shall be afraid of you” (Deuteronomy 28:10). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: This is</b> a reference to <b>the phylacteries of the head,</b> upon which the name of God is written. Phylacteries therefore impart the splendor and grandeur of God and are a fit reward. <b>But what is</b> the benefit imparted by <b>the thread of sky-blue wool?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: What is different about sky-blue from all other colors</b> such that it was specified for the mitzva of ritual fringes? It is <b>because sky-blue</b> dye <b>is similar</b> in its color <b>to the sea, and the sea is similar to the sky, and the sky is similar to the sapphire stone, and the sapphire stone is similar to the Throne of Glory, as it is stated: “And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under His feet</b> the like of a paved work of sapphire stone, and the like of the very heaven for clearness” (Exodus 24:10). This verse shows that the heavens are similar to sapphire, <b>and it is written:</b> “And above the firmament that was over their heads was <b>the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone”</b> (Ezekiel 1:26). Therefore, the throne is similar to the heavens. The color of sky blue dye acts as an indication of the bond between the Jewish people and the Divine Presence.

### Part 4
The Gemara above mentioned that Abraham refused to accept property that did not belong to him. With regard to this, <b>Rabbi Abba says: Difficult</b> is the return of <b>theft that has been consumed, as even</b> the <b>perfectly righteous are unable to return it, as it is stated:</b> “That I will not take a thread nor a shoe strap nor anything that is yours…<b>except only that which the young men have eaten with me”</b> (Genesis 14:23–24). Even the righteous Abraham was unable to return that which the young men had already consumed.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: Any place where you find the statements of Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, in</b> reference to <b>aggada, make your ears like a funnel [<i>ka’afarkeset</i>],</b> i.e., be receptive to his words. As Rabbi Eliezer interpreted the verse: <b>“Not because you are more in number than any people did the Lord desire you</b> and choose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples” (Deuteronomy 7:7), as follows: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the Jewish people: I desire you, since even at a time that I bestow greatness</b> upon <b>you, you diminish,</b> i.e., humble, <b>yourselves before Me.</b>

### Part 6
<b>I granted greatness to Abraham,</b> yet <b>he said before Me: “And I am but dust and ashes”</b> (Genesis 18:27). I granted greatness <b>to Moses and Aaron,</b> yet Moses <b>said</b> of the two of them: <b>“And what are we”</b> (Exodus 16:7). I granted greatness <b>to David,</b> yet <b>he said: “But I am a worm, and no man”</b> (Psalms 22:7).

### Part 7
<b>But the</b> gentile <b>nations of the world are not so. I granted greatness to Nimrod,</b> yet <b>he said: “Come, let us build a city</b> and a tower, with its top in heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name” (Genesis 11:4). I granted greatness <b>to Pharaoh,</b> yet <b>he said: “Who is the Lord”</b> (Exodus 5:2). I granted greatness <b>to Sennacherib,</b> yet he said: <b>“Who are they among all the gods of the countries</b> that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand” (II Kings 18:35). I granted greatness <b>to Nebuchadnezzar,</b> yet <b>he said: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds”</b> (Isaiah 14:14). I granted greatness <b>to Ḥiram, king of Tyre,</b> yet <b>he said: “I sit in the seat of God, in the heart of the seas”</b> (Ezekiel 28:2).

### Part 8
The Gemara relates: <b>Rava says, and some say Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says: <b>Greater</b> is <b>that</b> which <b>is stated with regard to Moses and Aaron than that</b> which <b>is stated with regard to Abraham. As with regard to Abraham it is written: “And I am but dust and ashes,” while with regard to Moses and Aaron it is written: “And what are we,”</b> i.e., we are not even dust and ashes. <b>And Rava says, and some say Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says: <b>The world endures only in the merit of Moses and Aaron. It is written here: “And what are we,” and it written elsewhere: “He hangs the earth upon nothing”</b> (Job 26:7). That is, the earth endures in the merit of those who said of themselves that they are nothing, i.e., Moses and Aaron.

### Part 9
With regard to that verse, <b>Rabbi Ile’a says: The world endures only in the merit of one who restrains [<i>shebolem</i>] himself during a quarrel, as it is stated: “He hangs the earth upon nothing [<i>belima</i>]. Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> The world endures only in the merit of <b>one who renders himself as if he were non-existent, as it is stated: “And underneath are the everlasting arms”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:27), i.e., one who considers himself to be underneath everything else is the everlasting arm that upholds the world.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Do you indeed [<i>ha’umnam</i>] speak as a righteous company [<i>elem</i>]? Do you judge with equity [<i>meisharim</i>] the sons of men”</b> (Psalms 58:2)? The verse is interpreted as follows: <b>What</b> should be <b>a person’s occupation [<i>umanut</i>] in this world? He should render himself</b> silent <b>as a mute [<i>ilem</i>].</b> If so, one <b>might</b> have thought that he should render himself as a mute <b>even with regard to words of Torah.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Speak as a righteous</b> company,” indicating that one should speak the righteous words of Torah. If so, he <b>might</b> have thought that one who speaks words of Torah has the right to <b>become arrogant.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Judge with equity [<i>meisharim</i>] the sons of men.”</b> Even a learned judge must take extra care to judge with equity, and not assume that he will immediately arrive at the correct understanding.

### Part 11
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the mitzva of covering the blood: <b>Rabbi Zeira says, and some say Rabba bar Yirmeya</b> says: <b>One may cover</b> the blood of an undomesticated animal or a bird <b>with the dust of an idolatrous city.</b> The Torah states that the city and anything contained therein must be burned (see Deuteronomy 13:17). The Gemara, assuming the statement of Rabbi Zeira refers to the ashes of a burned idolatrous city, asks: <b>But why</b> may one use these ashes to cover the blood? <b>These</b> ashes <b>are items from which</b> deriving <b>benefit is prohibited,</b> as the verse states: “And there shall cleave none of the banned property to your hand” (Deuteronomy 13:18).

### Part 12
<b>Ze’eiri said:</b> Rabbi Zeira is not referring to the ashes of the burned city, which may not be used. Rather, his statement is <b>necessary only concerning the dust of its dust,</b> i.e., the dust of the ground of the idolatrous city, from which deriving benefit is not prohibited, <b>as it is written: “And you shall gather all its spoil into the midst of the broad place thereof, and shall burn</b> with fire the city” (Deuteronomy 13:17). Accordingly, items <b>lacking only</b> the acts of <b>gathering and burning</b> must be burned. This serves to exclude <b>this</b> dust of the ground, <b>which lacks</b> the acts of <b>removal</b> from the ground, <b>gathering, and burning.</b> The dust must also be removed from the ground before it can be gathered and burned.

### Part 13
<b>And Rava says:</b> One can even use the ashes from the idolatrous city to cover the blood, despite the fact that it is prohibited to derive any benefit from them. This is because <b>mitzvot were not given for benefit,</b> that is, the fulfillment of a mitzva is not considered deriving benefit, but the fulfillment of a divine decree.

### Part 14
The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina was sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i>,</b> that one may use the ashes of an idolatrous city to cover the blood. <b>Rav Reḥumi raised an objection to Ravina</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a shofar of idol worship,</b> from which it is prohibited to derive benefit, <b>one may not blow with it. What, is it not</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means to say that <b>if one blew</b> with it <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that one should not use such a shofar <i>ab initio</i>, but <b>if one blew</b> with it <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation.

### Part 15
Rav Reḥumi persists: It is taught in another <i>baraita</i> that with regard to <b>a <i>lulav</i> of idol worship, one may not take</b> it to perform the mitzva. <b>What, is it not</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means to say that <b>if one took</b> such a <i>lulav</i> he has <b>not fulfilled</b> his obligation? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that one should not use such a <i>lulav ab initio</i>, but <b>if one took</b> it <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if <b>one blew</b> a shofar of idolatry <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation? And isn’t it taught in another <i>baraita</i> that if <b>one took</b> a <i>lulav</i> of idolatry to perform the mitzva <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation?

### Part 16
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> in response: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared</b> to the case of covering the blood? <b>There,</b> with regard to a shofar and <i>lulav</i> of idol worship, although the use of such items for a mitzva does not constitute benefit, one cannot fulfill his obligation with them, because
