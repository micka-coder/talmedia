### Part 1
in the case of <b>one who touches half an olive-bulk</b> of flesh from a corpse <b>and</b> simultaneously <b>another item overlies</b> both <b>him and half an olive-bulk</b> of flesh from a corpse, he remains <b>pure.</b>

### Part 2
<b>But if</b> impurity via contact and via a tent are considered <b>one concept, why</b> does he remain <b>pure? Rather,</b> based on the latter clause of the mishna, <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna is <b>difficult,</b> because it indicates that these two categories of impurity are considered one concept and join together to constitute the requisite measure for impurity.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> In the first clause of the mishna <b>we are dealing with</b> a case where the source of <b>impurity is pressed between two</b> wooden <b>chests and there is no opening of</b> one <b>handbreadth in between</b> the chests. When the hand of a person overlies the chests, the impurity of the pressed item rises beyond the chests and it transmits impurity to the person. Therefore, his interaction with <b>all</b> the sources <b>of</b> impurity is considered <b>as</b> though he <b>is touching</b> them simultaneously. Consequently, there is no proof in the mishna for the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan that imparting impurity via contact and via a tent are considered the same concept.

### Part 4
Therefore, the Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i> who refers to</b> impurity imparted in <b>a tent</b> as one who <b>touches [<i>noge’a</i>]?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is Rabbi Yosei, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Oholot</i> 4:1): <b>Rabbi Yosei says: A full ladle [<i>tarvad</i>] of dust</b> from a corpse <b>imparts impurity</b> like the corpse itself in three ways: <b>By contact [<i>bemagga</i>], and by carrying, and in a tent.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Granted,</b> the dust of a corpse imparts impurity <b>via carrying and in a tent; this</b> one who carries it <b>carries the entire</b> amount of dust <b>and that</b> one who overlies the dust <b>overlies all of it. But</b> with regard to one who <b>touches</b> it, <b>one does not touch all of</b> the dust, and it should therefore be impossible for one to become impure via contact. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> this <i>baraita</i>: To <b>what</b> is the term <b><i>noge’a</i></b> referring? It is referring to one who <b>overlies</b> the dust.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: How is it possible to explain the <i>baraita</i> in such a manner? <b>But doesn’t</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>teach</b> the case of one who <b>touches</b> separately, <b>and doesn’t he teach</b> the case of one who <b>overlies</b> separately? Therefore, the term <i>noge’a</i> cannot be referring to overlying. <b>Abaye said:</b> That is not difficult because there are two types of overlying. With regard to a tent that overlies impurity at a height of <b>below</b> one <b>handbreadth,</b> that <b>tent</b> is referred to as <b>touching.</b> But a tent that overlies impurity at a height of <b>above</b> one <b>handbreadth</b> is referred to as <b>merely a tent.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rava said:</b> According to Rabbi Yosei, <b>even a tent</b> that overlies impurity at a height <b>above</b> one <b>handbreadth is</b> referred to as <b>touching. And what are the circumstances of</b> a tent that is referred to as <b>merely a tent</b> and not as touching? The term tent is referring to the case of a structure that overlies both a person and a source of impurity, thereby <b>spreading</b> the impurity from its source to the person.

### Part 8
<b>Rava said: From where do I say</b> my opinion? It is <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Oholot</i> 9:4) that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> With regard to <b>bundles</b> that serve as <b>a bed and grilles</b> taken from <b>windows,</b> if one placed them between the ground floor and the upper floor of the house such that they serve as a ceiling, since they have become part of the building they are not susceptible to impurity. Therefore, even if there are holes in the bundles and the grilles, <b>they serve as a barrier between the house and the upper floor such that the impurity</b> of a corpse present in the area of the house <b>cannot enter the other side,</b> i.e., the upper floor.

### Part 9
And if <b>one spread out</b> the bundles and grilles outside the house in an impermanent manner by hanging them <b>over a corpse in the air</b> like a net, <b>one who touches,</b> i.e., overlies the corpse, <b>opposite a hole</b> in the netting becomes <b>impure.</b> By contrast, one who overlies it <b>not opposite a hole</b> remains <b>pure.</b>

### Part 10
Rava explains his proof: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say</b> that he spread out the netting <b>below</b> the height of one <b>handbreadth</b> above the corpse, <b>why</b> does one who overlies the corpse <b>not opposite a hole</b> in the netting remain <b>pure?</b> In such a case, the netting is close enough to the corpse to be considered part of the clothing of the corpse. Therefore, the case is tantamount to one where the <b>corpse is</b> dressed <b>in its clothing, and a corpse</b> dressed <b>in its clothing imparts impurity</b> to one who overlies it because the clothing does not act as a barrier.

### Part 11
<b>Rather, is it not</b> the case that he spread out the netting more than one <b>handbreadth above</b> the corpse? <b>And</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>refers to</b> overlying the corpse <b>as touching.</b> Apparently, contrary to the opinion of Abaye, Rabbi Yosei refers to overlying as touching even when the overlying item is more than one handbreadth above the source of impurity.

### Part 12
<b>Abaye</b> rejected Rava’s proof and <b>said: Actually,</b> the case is one where one spread the netting out <b>below</b> the height of one <b>handbreadth</b> above the corpse. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which you say:</b> If so, one who overlies the corpse not opposite a hole in the netting should also become impure as it <b>is</b> tantamount to a case of <b>a corpse</b> dressed <b>in its clothing,</b> this case is not similar to the case of a corpse dressed in its clothing. In the case of <b>a corpse</b> dressed <b>in its clothing</b> the clothing does not act as a barrier to the impurity because the one who dressed the corpse <b>nullified</b> the clothing by rendering its status as though it is a part of the corpse. But in <b>this</b> case in the <i>baraita</i>, the one who spread out the netting over the corpse intended to remove the bundles and grilles afterward and <b>he did not nullify</b> them.

### Part 13
The Gemara objects with regard to Abaye’s explanation: <b>But</b> if the case is one where he spread out the netting less than one handbreadth above the corpse, even if it is not considered the clothing of the corpse, <b>let it be</b> considered <b>like</b> a source of <b>impurity hidden</b> underneath an overlying structure at a distance of less than one handbreadth. In such a case, the impurity <b>breaks through and ascends,</b> and therefore it should transmit impurity even to one who overlies it not opposite a hole in the netting. The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b>hidden impurity does not break through</b> and ascend.

### Part 14
<b>And from where do you say</b> that this is the opinion of Rabbi Yosei? It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 4:2): In the case of <b>a compartment</b> in <b>a chest</b> that is inside a house, in which the <b>open space</b> of the compartment itself <b>has</b> at least one cubic <b>handbreadth</b> in volume, <b>but</b> the <b>opening</b> of the compartment to the house does <b>not have</b> the area of one square <b>handbreadth,</b> and the volume of the entire chest is forty <i>se’a</i>, in that case, if there is a source of <b>impurity inside</b> the compartment, the compartment does not act as a barrier and <b>the house is impure.</b> If the source of <b>impurity is inside the house</b> but outside the chest, <b>whatever is inside</b> the compartment remains <b>pure,</b> because the opening of the compartment is less than one handbreadth.

### Part 15
This differentiation exists <b>because it is typical for</b> a source of <b>impurity to exit</b> from its location, and therefore impurity can be transmitted out of the compartment and into the house. <b>But it is not typical for</b> a source of <b>impurity to enter</b> a location, and therefore an impure item that lies in the house does not transmit impurity into the compartment. Since the volume of the chest is forty <i>se’a</i> it constitutes a separate tent, and the compartment that is part of the chest is also considered part of this tent.

### Part 16
<b>And Rabbi Yosei deems</b> the house <b>pure</b> when the impure item is in the compartment. The item will not necessarily impart impurity outside of the compartment <b>because one can remove</b> the source of impurity from the compartment <b>in halves,</b> i.e., in pieces that each measure less than the requisite amount to impart impurity. <b>Or,</b> alternatively, one can <b>burn</b> the source of impurity while it still remains <b>in its place</b> inside the compartment.

### Part 17
<b>And the latter clause</b> of that mishna <b>teaches:</b> If one <b>placed</b> the chest <b>in the entrance</b> to the house <b>and the opening of</b> the compartment is facing <b>out</b> of the house, if there is a source of <b>impurity inside</b> the chest, <b>the house</b> remains <b>pure</b> because the impure item will typically exit the house. If there is a source of <b>impurity in the house, whatever is inside</b> the chest remains <b>pure,</b> because the source of impurity will not enter the chest.
