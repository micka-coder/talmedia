### Part 1
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>one heated a knife until</b> it became <b>white hot [<i>libben</i>] and slaughtered</b> an animal <b>with it, his slaughter is valid,</b> as cutting the relevant <i>simanim</i> with the knife’s <b>sharp</b> blade <b>preceded</b> the effect of <b>its white heat.</b> Had the effect of the heat preceded the cutting, the animal would have been rendered a <i>tereifa</i>, an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months, before the slaughter was completed, by searing the windpipe and the gullet. The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t there the sides</b> of the knife, which burn the throat and render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>The area of the slaughter</b> in the throat <b>parts</b> immediately after the incision, and the tissue on either side of the incision is not seared by the white-hot blade.

### Part 2
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>one heated a skewer [<i>shappud</i>] until</b> it became <b>white hot and struck</b> a person <b>with it,</b> and after the wound healed a leprous mark developed, is that mark <b>adjudged as</b> a leprous <b>boil or is it adjudged as</b> a leprous <b>burn?</b>

### Part 3
<b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> whether it is adjudged a boil or a burn? The difference is <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Both a leprous <b>boil and</b> a leprous <b>burn become impure during one week</b> of quarantine <b>with two symptoms: With white hair</b> that grows in the leprous mark <b>and with spreading</b> of the leprous mark. <b>And why did the verse divide them</b> into two separate passages even though their halakhic status is the same? The verse divided them <b>to say that they do not join together</b> to constitute the requisite measure of impure leprous marks. Rather, there is impurity only if the boil or the burn constitutes that measure individually.

### Part 4
<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which</b> wound <b>is a boil and which is a burn?</b> If <b>one was struck with wood, with a stone, with pomace, with the hot springs of Tiberias, or with any item that is not heated by fire,</b> a phrase that serves <b>to include lead</b> that was mined <b>from its source</b> in the ground, which is occasionally hot enough to burn a person, <b>this</b> impression left on the skin <b>is a boil. And which</b> wound <b>is a burn?</b> If <b>one was burned with a coal, with hot ashes, with boiling limestone, with boiling gypsum [<i>begippesit</i>], or with any item that is heated by fire,</b> a phrase that serves <b>to include</b> water <b>heated by fire, this</b> impression left on the skin <b>is a burn.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there is <b>a boil and a burn</b> on the same place on the skin and a leprous mark developed, the later wound determines the nature of the leprosy. Therefore, <b>if the boil preceded the burn, the burn nullifies the boil</b> and the mark is a leprous burn. <b>And if the burn preceded the boil, the boil nullifies the burn</b> and the mark is a leprous boil.

### Part 6
<b>And here,</b> where the dilemma was raised whether the mark that develops from being struck with a hot skewer is a boil or a burn, <b>what are the circumstances?</b> It is a case <b>where initially there was a boil half</b> the size of <b>a split bean on</b> the person’s skin, <b>and one heated a skewer until</b> it became <b>white hot and struck</b> him <b>with it, and another</b> mark <b>half</b> the size of <b>a split bean emerged</b> on the skin there.

### Part 7
The Gemara clarifies the dilemma: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Does</b> the effect of <b>the blow come first and</b> then the effect of <b>the heat comes and nullifies</b> the effect of <b>the blow, and it is</b> a half-measure <b>boil and</b> a half-measure <b>burn and they do not join together</b> to constitute a full measure? <b>Or perhaps</b> the effect of <b>the heat comes first and</b> then the effect of <b>the blow comes and nullifies</b> the effect of <b>the heat, and it is</b> a half-measure <b>boil and</b> a half-measure <b>boil and they join together.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from that <b>which Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>one heated a knife until</b> it became <b>white hot and slaughtered</b> an animal <b>with it, his slaughter is valid,</b> as cutting the relevant <i>simanim</i> with the knife’s <b>sharp</b> blade <b>preceded</b> the effect of <b>its white heat. Apparently,</b> the effect of <b>the blow comes first.</b> The Gemara rejects that proof: Cutting with <b>a sharp</b> blade <b>is different</b> from striking with a blunt object, and only in the case of a blade does the cut precede the effect of the heat.

### Part 9
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one heated a skewer until</b> it became <b>white hot and struck</b> a person <b>with it</b> and after the wound healed a leprous mark developed, that mark <b>is adjudged as</b> a leprous <b>burn</b> caused <b>by fire. Apparently,</b> the effect of <b>the blow precedes</b> the effect of the burn. The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>There too,</b> the reference is to a case <b>where he stabbed</b> the skin with the skewer, <b>which is</b> the same as cutting with <b>a sharp</b> blade.

### Part 10
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says that Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> With regard to <b>a knife</b> used <b>for idol worship,</b> it is <b>permitted to slaughter</b> an animal <b>with it, but</b> it is <b>prohibited to cut meat with it.</b> It is <b>permitted to slaughter</b> an animal <b>with it</b> because slaughtering it <b>is a destructive</b> action vis-à-vis the animal, which is worth more when it is alive. <b>But</b> it is <b>prohibited to cut meat with it,</b> because once the animal is slaughtered, cutting it <b>is a constructive</b> action that renders the meat manageable.

### Part 11
<b>Rava said:</b> There are <b>times when</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> for <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal to use a knife used for idol worship, e.g., <b>in</b> the case of an animal that is in <b>danger,</b> meaning that it is about to die. If he does not slaughter the animal it would become an unslaughtered carcass and depreciate in value. <b>And</b> there are times when it is <b>permitted</b> for <b>one who cuts</b> meat to use a knife of idol worship, e.g., <b>in</b> the case of an animal whose <b>thighs are intended to</b> be sent as <b>a gift</b> to a person of stature. Cutting it into pieces would render it unfit for this purpose, thereby diminishing its value.

### Part 12
The Gemara challenges: <b>And derive</b> that <b>it</b> is prohibited to use a knife used for idol worship, not because benefit from it is prohibited, but <b>due to</b> the residue of <b>fat of forbidden</b> carcasses on the knife.
