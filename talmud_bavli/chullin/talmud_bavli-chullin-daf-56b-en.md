<b>by</b> dragging <b>a wheat straw</b> over the membrane to see if it would catch on a perforation.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Sheizvi said: Our geese are considered like water birds.</b> If the skull of a goose is broken, even if the membrane is not perforated, it is a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 3
§ The mishna states: In a case where a bird <b>fell into the fire</b> and its innards were singed, if they turned green the bird is a <i>tereifa</i>; if they are red the bird is kosher. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Yehoshua: The measure of their</b> turning <b>green is like the measure of their perforation. Just as their perforation in any amount</b> renders them a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>so too their turning green in any amount</b> renders them a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yosef, son of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: If a liver turned green</b> on the side <b>facing the intestines, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said to him:</b> The bird is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: But</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>should be no more</b> stringent than that of a case where the liver was <b>removed</b> and an olive-bulk remained (see 54a), in which case the bird is kosher. Therefore, as long as an olive-bulk remains red, the bird should be kosher. <b>Rava said: Since the liver turned green facing the intestines, it is certain that</b> the bird <b>fell into the fire and the intestines</b> themselves <b>were singed, and</b> this is why the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> not because of the liver per se.

### Part 5
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi had a certain hen</b> that fell into the fire. After it was slaughtered, <b>he sent it before the distinguished Rabbi Elazar HaKappar and said to him:</b> Its innards <b>were green, and</b> Rabbi Elazar HaKappar <b>deemed it kosher.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi asked: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: If they turned <b>green</b> they are <b>unfit?</b> Rabbi Elazar HaKappar said to him: The Sages <b>said</b> that if they turned <b>green</b> they are <b>unfit only with regard to the gizzard, the heart, and the liver,</b> which are naturally red. Other innards of a hen, such as the intestines, are naturally green, and a green appearance in them does not render the hen a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara notes: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Concerning which innards did they say</b> that a green appearance renders the bird a <i>tereifa</i>? Only <b>concerning the gizzard, the heart, and the liver.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Yosef had a certain hen</b> that fell into the fire. After it was slaughtered, <b>he sent it before Rabbi Abbahu and said to him:</b> Its innards <b>were red, and</b> Rabbi Elazar HaKappar <b>deemed it a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Yosef asked: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: If they are <b>red,</b> the bird is <b>kosher?</b> Rabbi Elazar HaKappar <b>said to him: Red</b> innards <b>that turned green and green</b> innards <b>that turned red</b> render the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> The Sages <b>said</b> in the mishna that <b>red</b> innards <b>are kosher only with regard to the heart, the gizzard, and the liver,</b> because these organs are naturally red. Organs that are naturally green, however, render the bird a <i>tereifa</i> if they have turned red.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Ḥiyya says</b> that <b>Rabbi Mani says:</b> If <b>red</b> organs <b>turned green, and one boiled them and they turned red again, they are kosher. What is the reason?</b> This proves that they were not burned; rather, <b>smoke entered them</b> and changed their color temporarily. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: We, too, will say:</b> If <b>red</b> organs <b>did not turn green, and one boiled them and they</b> then <b>turned green,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. What is the reason? Their shame was revealed,</b> i.e., it is evident that they were in fact burned. <b>Rav Ashi said: Therefore,</b> even if a bird’s innards remain red after it fell in a fire, <b>a person may eat it only</b> if it is <b>boiled,</b> to be certain that the innards will not turn green. The Gemara rejects this: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so,</b> since <b>we do not presume</b> the existence of <b>a flaw</b> without evidence.

### Part 8
§ The mishna states: If a person <b>trampled</b> the bird, <b>or slammed it against a wall,</b> or if an animal crushed it, and it lasted twenty-four hours, and then one slaughtered it, it is kosher. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Antigonus says in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yannai: Both this and that,</b> i.e., all of the above cases, <b>require inspection</b> after slaughter, to ascertain that there is no injury that would itself render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And these are kosher among birds:</b> If a bird’s <b>windpipe was perforated or cracked</b> lengthwise; or if <b>a weasel struck</b> the bird <b>on its head</b> in <b>a place that does not render it a <i>tereifa</i>;</b> or if <b>the crop was perforated. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It is kosher <b>even</b> if the crop <b>was removed.</b> If the bird’s <b>intestines emerged</b> from the abdominal wall <b>but were not perforated,</b> or if <b>its wings were broken,</b> or if <b>its legs were broken,</b> or if the feathers on <b>its wings were plucked,</b> the bird is kosher. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If the down</b> covering its body <b>was removed,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i> and <b>unfit</b> for consumption.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Simai and Rabbi Tzadok, who went to intercalate the year in Lod, and they spent Shabbat in</b> the town of <b>Ono. And they ruled with regard to</b> an animal whose <b>womb</b> was removed, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi in the mishna <b>with regard to the crop.</b>

### Part 11
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: What is the meaning of the <i>baraita</i>? Is it referring to two different rulings, i.e., that <b>they ruled with regard to the womb to prohibit</b> it, and they also ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>with regard to the crop to permit</b> it? <b>Or perhaps</b> it is referring to only one ruling, and it means that <b>they ruled with regard to the womb to permit</b> it, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>with regard to the crop, but they do not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>with regard to the crop</b> itself. The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 12
<b>Rabba says, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> who says: <b>The roof the crop is treated like the gullet,</b> i.e., it renders the bird a <i>tereifa</i> if perforated in any amount. The Gemara asks: <b>Where</b> is the roof of the crop? <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye said:</b> It is <b>any</b> part of the crop <b>that stretches with</b> the gullet.

### Part 13
§ The mishna states: If the bird’s <b>intestines emerged</b> from the stomach wall but were not perforated, the bird is kosher. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one did not jumble them,</b> but returned them to the stomach in their proper order. <b>But</b> if <b>he jumbled them,</b> the bird is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, as it is written: “Has He not made you, and established you?”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:6). The verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created established</b> locations for each organ <b>in a person,</b> so <b>that if one of them is switched he cannot live.</b> The same applies to other creatures.

### Part 14
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir would say</b> that the verse: <b>“Has He not made you, and established you?”</b> teaches that the Jewish people is <b>a city with everything in it. Out of it</b> come <b>its priests, out of it</b> come <b>its prophets, out of it</b> come <b>its chiefs, out of it</b> come <b>its kings, as it is stated: “Out of them shall come forth the cornerstone, out of them the stake,</b> out of them the battle bow, out of them every master together” (Zechariah 10:4).

### Part 15
The Gemara recounts an incident involving <b>a certain Roman who saw a certain man fall from the roof to the ground,</b> and <b>his stomach ruptured and his intestines emerged.</b> The Roman <b>brought</b> the man’s <b>son and slaughtered him before</b> his father’s eyes
