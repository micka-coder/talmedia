### Part 1
<b>may be eaten with a non-priest</b> present <b>at the</b> same <b>table.</b> The Sages did not issue a decree prohibiting this lest the non-priest partake of the <i>ḥalla</i>, as the separation of <i>ḥalla</i> outside of Eretz Yisrael is itself a rabbinic decree. This proves that the Sages do not issue one decree to prevent violation of another decree. <b>And</b> similarly, <i>ḥalla</i> from outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>may be given to any priest that</b> one <b>wishes,</b> even an uneducated priest who would not guard its state of ritual purity. This is in contrast to <i>ḥalla</i> from Eretz Yisrael, which may be given only to priests who observe the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity.

### Part 2
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Granted,</b> your inference would be valid <b>if</b> the mishna in tractate <i>Ḥalla</i> had <b>taught us</b> this with regard to <b><i>ḥalla</i> from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael that had been brought <b>into Eretz</b> Yisrael. <b>As</b> in that case, <b>there</b> could be reason <b>to decree</b> against eating it while a non-priest is at the same table, despite the fact that the non-priest eating it is prohibited only by rabbinic law, <b>due to</b> the concern that one might come to eat <b><i>ḥalla</i> from Eretz</b> Yisrael, which is prohibited to the non-priest <b>by Torah law,</b> at the same table as a non-priest; <b>and</b> yet <b>we do not decree</b> against this practice. If so, <b>there</b> would be grounds <b>to learn from</b> this mishna that the Sages do not issue one decree to prevent violation of another decree.

### Part 3
<b>But</b> the mishna actually teaches this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <i>ḥalla</i> from <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael that remains there. It therefore proves nothing about compound decrees, as it can be claimed that the practice <b>is</b> permitted only <b>because there is no</b> reason <b>to decree.</b> Since by Torah law the obligation of <i>ḥalla</i> does not apply outside of Eretz Yisrael, there is no chance that such behavior will lead to transgression of Torah law. <b>But here, if you permit one to place</b> the meat of <b>birds and cheese</b> on the same table, some might <b>come to place</b> the <b>meat</b> of domesticated animals <b>and cheese</b> on a single table <b>and</b> to <b>eat</b> this <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk,</b> thereby transgressing a prohibition <b>by Torah law.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Sheshet objects to</b> the premise of Rav Yosef’s inference: Even if one were to posit that the meat of birds in milk is prohibited by Torah law, <b>ultimately</b> this is still a decree issued due to another decree, as <b>it is</b> a case of <b>cold</b> food <b>in</b> another <b>cold</b> food, consumption of which is itself prohibited by rabbinic law. <b>Abaye said:</b> It is a rabbinic <b>decree, lest one place</b> the meat with cheese <b>in a boiling stewpot,</b> which is a manner of cooking and therefore prohibited by Torah law.

### Part 5
The Gemara counters: <b>Ultimately,</b> even a stewpot is only <b>a secondary vessel,</b> i.e., not the vessel that was on the fire, <b>and</b> as a rule, <b>a secondary vessel does not cook. Rather,</b> one must say that it is a rabbinic <b>decree, lest one place</b> the meat with cheese <b>in a stewpot</b> that is <b>a primary</b> vessel, i.e., that was on the fire. This is certainly cooking meat in milk, and it is prohibited by Torah law.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The</b> meat of <b>birds may be placed with cheese on</b> one <b>table but</b> may <b>not be eaten</b> together with it; this is <b>the statement of Beit Shammai. And Beit Hillel say:</b> It may <b>neither be placed</b> on one table <b>nor be eaten</b> with cheese. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: This is</b> one <b>of the</b> disputes involving <b>leniencies of Beit Shammai and stringencies of Beit Hillel.</b>

### Part 7
The mishna elaborates: <b>With regard to which table</b> are these <i>halakhot</i> <b>stated?</b> It is <b>with regard to a table upon which one eats. But on a table upon which one prepares the cooked food, one</b> may <b>place this</b> meat <b>alongside that</b> cheese or vice versa, <b>and</b> need <b>not be concerned</b> that perhaps they will be mixed and one will come to eat them together.

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara challenges: The opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei is</b> identical to that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>. And if you would say</b> that there <b>is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to the permissibility of <b>eating itself, as the first <i>tanna</i> says</b> that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>disagree with regard to placing</b> meat of birds with cheese on one table, which indicates that <b>with regard to eating they do not disagree, and Rabbi Yosei said</b> in response <b>to</b> this that they also disagree with regard to the permissibility of <b>eating</b> meat of birds in milk, and this is <b>itself</b> one <b>of the</b> disputes involving <b>leniencies of Beit Shammai and stringencies of Beit Hillel,</b> one can refute this claim.

### Part 9
The refutation is as follows: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that <b>six matters</b> are included <b>as the</b> disputes involving <b>leniencies of Beit Shammai and stringencies of Beit Hillel, and this is one of them:</b> The meat of <b>birds is placed with cheese on</b> one <b>table, but</b> it may <b>not be eaten</b> together with it; this is <b>the statement of Beit Shammai. And Beit Hillel say:</b> It may <b>neither be placed</b> on one table <b>nor be eaten</b> with cheese. Evidently, Rabbi Yosei agrees that even according to Beit Shammai the meat of birds may not be eaten with cheese.

### Part 10
<b>Rather, this</b> is what the mishna <b>teaches us: Who is the first <i>tanna</i>?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> The identification is important, since <b>whoever reports a statement in the name of the one who said it brings redemption to the world. As it is stated</b> with respect to the incident of Bigthan and Teresh: <b>“And Esther reported it to the king in the name of Mordecai”</b> (Esther 2:22), and Mordecai was later rewarded for saving the king’s life, paving the way for the miraculous salvation.

### Part 11
§ The Gemara continues discussing the consumption of poultry cooked in milk. The Sage <b>Agra, the father-in-law of Rabbi Abba, taught:</b> The meat of <b>birds and cheese may be eaten freely</b> [<b><i>apikoren</i></b>], i.e., there is no need to be strict in this matter. The Gemara notes: <b>He,</b> Agra, <b>teaches it and he says it,</b> i.e., explains his statement: The meat of birds and cheese may be eaten <b>without washing</b> one’s <b>hands and without wiping the mouth</b> between the consumption of each.

### Part 12
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Mesharshiyya, happened</b> to come <b>to the house of Rav Ashi. They brought him cheese,</b> and <b>he ate</b> it. Next <b>they brought him meat,</b> and <b>he ate</b> it <b>without</b> first <b>washing his hands.</b> The members of Rav Ashi’s household <b>said to him: But didn’t Agra, the father-in-law of Rabbi Abba, teach</b> only that the meat of <b>birds and cheese may be eaten freely?</b> One can infer that with regard to the meat of <b>birds and cheese, yes,</b> one may eat them without washing one’s hands in between, but with regard to the <b>meat</b> of domesticated animals <b>and cheese, no,</b> one may not.

### Part 13
Rav Yitzḥak <b>said to them: This statement</b> of Agra applies only if one eats them <b>at night,</b> as one cannot see whether some of the food of the previous dish still remains on his hands, and he must therefore wash them. <b>But</b> if one eats <b>by day, I</b> can <b>see</b> that no food remains on his hands, and consequently there is no need to wash them.

### Part 14
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Between the consumption of meat and milk one must <b>wipe</b> out his mouth, <b>and Beit Hillel say</b> that he must <b>rinse</b> his mouth. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the word: <b>Wipe [<i>mekane’aḥ</i>], and what</b> is the meaning of the word: <b>Rinse [<i>mediaḥ</i>]?</b>
