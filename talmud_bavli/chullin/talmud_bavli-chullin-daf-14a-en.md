### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>on Shabbat or on Yom Kippur, although he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty, <b>his slaughter is valid.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav taught in the name of Rav:</b> If one slaughtered an animal on Shabbat and Yom Kippur, although the slaughter is valid, <b>consumption</b> of the animal is <b>prohibited for</b> that <b>day, and</b> the members of <b>the company</b> of Sages, i.e., those in the academy, <b>tended to say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? Rabbi Abba said:</b> It <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to preparation</b> for Shabbat, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 156b): <b>One may cut the gourds before an animal</b> on Shabbat, provided that they were picked prior to Shabbat. <b>And</b> likewise, one may cut an animal <b>carcass</b> to place <b>before the dogs</b> on Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If it was not</b> already <b>a carcass prior to Shabbat,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to cut it or even move it on Shabbat <b>because it is not prepared</b> for use on Shabbat. <b>Apparently, since it was not prepared from yesterday,</b> it is <b>prohibited. Here too,</b> in the mishna where an animal was slaughtered on Shabbat or Yom Kippur, <b>since it was not prepared from yesterday,</b> it is <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabbi Abba: <b>Are</b> the cases <b>comparable? There,</b> in the mishna in tractate <i>Shabbat</i>, <b>initially</b> the animal is <b>prepared for</b> use by <b>a person,</b> as it was prepared for slaughter, <b>and now</b> that it died without slaughter on Shabbat it is <b>prepared for dogs.</b> But in the mishna <b>here, initially</b> the animal is <b>prepared for</b> use by <b>a person and now</b> after it was slaughtered it remains <b>prepared for</b> use by <b>a person.</b> Rabbi Abba rejects that distinction: <b>Do you hold</b> that <b>an animal during its lifetime is designated for consumption</b> and therefore is prepared for use by a person? On the contrary, <b>an animal during its lifetime is designated for breeding.</b>

### Part 5
Abaye asked: <b>If that is so</b> that an animal is not designated for consumption, according <b>to Rabbi Yehuda, how do we slaughter an animal on a Festival?</b> Rabbi Abba <b>said to</b> Abaye: During its lifetime, the animal <b>is designated for consumption and designated for breeding.</b> If it <b>was slaughtered,</b> it is retroactively <b>clarified that it was designated for consumption;</b> if it <b>was not slaughtered,</b> it is retroactively <b>clarified that it was designated for breeding.</b>

### Part 6
<b>But isn’t</b> it so that <b>Rabbi Yehuda does not accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>designation? From where do we</b> derive that this is Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion? <b>If we say</b> that we learn it <b>from that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>, there is no proof.

### Part 7
It is taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Demai</i> 8:7): In the case of <b>one who purchases wine from among the Samaritans</b> just before Shabbat, and presumably <i>teruma</i> and tithes were not separated, he acts as follows: If there are one hundred <i>log</i> of wine in the barrels, <b>he says: Two <i>log</i> that I will separate in the future are <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the mandated average measure of <i>teruma</i> is one-fiftieth; <b>ten</b> <i>log</i> are <b>first tithe;</b> and a tenth of the remainder, which is <b>nine</b> <i>log</i>, are <b>second tithe. And he deconsecrates</b> the second tithe that he will separate in the future, transferring its sanctity to money, <b>and</b> he may <b>drink</b> the wine <b>immediately,</b> relying on the separation that he will perform later, which will clarify retroactively which <i>log</i> he designated for the tithes and for <i>teruma</i>. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</b> this practice. Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda does not accept the principle of retroactive designation.
