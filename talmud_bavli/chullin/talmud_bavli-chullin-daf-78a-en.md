<b>that</b> the tree’s <b>strength will lessen.</b> It is possible that the tree shed its fruits prematurely due to excessive blossoming. It taxes the tree to sustain these blossoms, and this may render the tree incapable of sustaining the fruits that subsequently grow from the blossoms. Stones were used to weaken the tree during blossoming, thereby reducing the number of blossoms that it needed to nourish. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>painting it with red paint, for what</b> benefit is it performed that makes it permitted despite the fact that this was the practice of the Amorites? The Gemara explains: One does so <b>in order that people will see</b> the tree <b>and pray for it.</b>

### Part 2
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse: <b>“And he will cry: Impure, impure”</b> (Leviticus 13:45), that a leper must publicize the fact that he is ritually impure. <b>He must announce</b> his pain <b>to the masses, and the masses will pray for mercy on his behalf. And likewise, one to whom</b> any unfortunate <b>matter happens must announce</b> it <b>to the masses, and</b> then <b>the masses will pray for mercy on his behalf.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Ravina said: In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do we hang bunches of</b> unripe <b>dates on a palm tree</b> that casts off its dates, despite the fact that this is the practice of the Amorites? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> just cited, who states that one must announce such occurrences to the masses so that they will pray for mercy.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, both <b>in the presence,</b> i.e., the time, <b>of the Temple and not in the presence of the Temple,</b> and it applies <b>with regard to non-sacred</b> animals <b>and with regard to sacrificial</b> animals.

### Part 6
<b>How so?</b> In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>itself and its offspring,</b> both of which are <b>non-sacred,</b> and slaughters them <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>both of</b> the animals <b>are fit</b> for consumption, <b>but</b> for slaughtering <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs [<i>sofeg</i>] the forty</b> lashes for violating the prohibition: “You shall not slaughter it and its offspring both in one day” (Leviticus 22:28).

### Part 7
If both animals were <b>sacrificial</b> animals slaughtered <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>then</b> for slaughtering <b>the first</b> animal, <b>one is liable</b> to receive <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>].</b> For slaughtering the second animal one is not liable to receive <i>karet</i>. The second animal was not fit for sacrifice, since one may not slaughter an animal and its offspring on the same day. <b>And both</b> animals <b>are disqualified</b> for use as offerings, <b>and</b> for the slaughter of <b>both of them, one incurs forty</b> lashes apiece: The first being a sacrificial animal slaughtered outside the courtyard and the second being the offspring of an animal slaughtered that day.

### Part 8
If both animals were <b>non-sacred and</b> slaughtered <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>both of them are unfit</b> to be sacrificed, being non-sacred animals slaughtered in the courtyard. <b>And</b> for slaughter of <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs the forty</b> lashes for slaughtering an animal and its offspring on a single day. If both animals were <b>sacrificial</b> animals slaughtered <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>the first is fit</b> for sacrifice, <b>and</b> one who slaughters it is <b>exempt</b> from any punishment. <b>But</b> for slaughter of <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs the forty</b> lashes for slaughtering an animal and its offspring on a single day, <b>and</b> it is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice, because one was not allowed to slaughter it on that day.

### Part 9
If the first animal was <b>non-sacred and</b> the second <b>a sacrificial</b> animal, and both were slaughtered <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>the first is fit</b> for consumption <b>and</b> one who slaughters it is <b>exempt</b> from any punishment. <b>But</b> for slaughtering <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs the forty</b> lashes for slaughtering an animal and its offspring on a single day, <b>and</b> the animal is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice.

### Part 10
If the first animal was <b>a sacrificial</b> animal <b>and</b> the second was <b>non-sacred</b> and both were slaughtered <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, for <b>the first</b> animal, <b>one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> for slaughtering a sacrificial animal outside the courtyard, <b>and</b> the animal is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice. <b>And the second is fit</b> for consumption; <b>and</b> for the slaughter of <b>both of them</b> one <b>incurs forty</b> lashes apiece: The first being a sacrificial animal slaughtered outside the courtyard and the second being the offspring of an animal slaughtered that day.

### Part 11
If the first animal was <b>non-sacred and</b> the second was <b>a sacrificial</b> animal and both were slaughtered <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>both of them are unfit</b> for sacrifice. <b>And</b> for slaughtering <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs the forty</b> lashes. If the first animal was <b>a sacrificial</b> animal <b>and</b> the second was <b>non-sacred</b> and both were slaughtered <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>the first is fit</b> for sacrifice <b>and</b> one who slaughters it is <b>exempt</b> from any punishment. <b>And</b> for slaughtering <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs the forty</b> lashes, <b>and</b> the animal is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice, as it is non-sacred.

### Part 12
If both animals were <b>non-sacred,</b> and one slaughters them, the first <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>and</b> the second <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>the first is fit</b> for consumption <b>and</b> one who slaughters it is <b>exempt</b> from any punishment. <b>And</b> for slaughtering <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs the forty</b> lashes for slaughtering an animal and its offspring on a single day, <b>and</b> the animal is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice as it is non-sacred.

### Part 13
If both animals were <b>sacrificial</b> animals, and one slaughters them, the first <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>and</b> the second <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, for slaughtering <b>the first</b> animal <b>one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>, and</b> for slaughtering <b>both of them one incurs forty</b> lashes apiece. One set of lashes is given because the first was a sacrificial animal slaughtered outside the courtyard, and the second set of lashes is given because the second animal is the offspring of an animal slaughtered that day. <b>And both of them are unfit</b> for sacrifice.

### Part 14
If both animals were <b>non-sacred,</b> and one slaughters them, the first <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>and</b> the second <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>the first is unfit</b> for sacrifice, as it is non-sacred, <b>and</b> the one who slaughters it is <b>exempt. And</b> for <b>the second, one incurs the forty</b> lashes <b>and</b> the animal is <b>fit</b> for consumption. If both animals were <b>sacrificial</b> animals, and one slaughters them, the first <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>and</b> the second <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>the first is fit</b> for sacrifice <b>and</b> one who slaughters it is <b>exempt. And</b> for <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs the forty</b> lashes, <b>and</b> the animal is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice because its requisite time has not yet arrived.

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring</b> in a single day <b>applies to sacrificial</b> animals? It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat, is born</b>…but from the eighth day and forward it may be accepted for an offering…to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:27), <b>and it is written</b> in the <b>following</b> verse: <b>“And whether it be a bull or a sheep, you shall not slaughter it and its offspring both in one day.”</b> The juxtaposition of the verses <b>teaches with regard to</b> the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring that it applies to sacrificial</b> animals as well.

### Part 16
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> since this prohibition is taught in the context of other <i>halakhot</i> of consecrated animals, perhaps <b>I will say: Yes,</b> it applies <b>to sacrificial</b> animals, but it does <b>not</b> apply <b>to non-sacred</b> animals. The Gemara explains: The repetitive phrase “and whether it be <b>a bull</b> or a sheep” in the second verse, when those types of animals, i.e., bulls and sheep, were already mentioned in the first verse, <b>interrupted the topic,</b> clarifying that the second verse is not referring to sacrificial animals.

### Part 17
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> if so, <b>I will say: Yes,</b> the prohibition applies <b>to non-sacred</b> animals, but it does <b>not</b> apply <b>to sacrificial</b> animals. The Gemara explains: Since in that verse <b>it is written: “And whether it be a bull</b>…you shall not slaughter it and its offspring,” the conjunction <b>“and” adds</b> the prohibition stated in the second verse <b>to the first matter,</b> including sacrificial animals as well.

### Part 18
The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b> this prohibition also applies to sacrificial animals, perhaps <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, the offspring of <b>diverse kinds</b> is <b>not</b> included, e.g., the offspring of a ewe and a goat is unfit to be an offering, <b>so too</b> with regard to the prohibition of: <b>A mother and its offspring,</b> the offspring of <b>diverse kinds</b> should <b>not</b> be included, so that in the case of the offspring of a ewe and a goat, it would be permitted to slaughter the mother and offspring on the same day. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>is</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (see <i>Tosefta</i> 5:1): The prohibition of: <b>A mother and its offspring, applies to</b> the offspring of <b>diverse kinds and to a <i>koy</i>,</b> a kosher animal with characteristics of both domesticated and undomesticated animals?

### Part 19
<b>And additionally,</b> why should the prohibition of: A mother and its offspring, apply to the offspring of diverse kinds? <b>“A sheep,” is written</b> in the verse with regard to that prohibition, <b>and Rava said</b>
