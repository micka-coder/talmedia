### Part 1
The Gemara answers: Forbidden <b>fat is different</b> from the sciatic nerve, <b>because</b> its flavor <b>permeates</b> throughout the animal, unlike that of the sciatic nerve.

### Part 2
The Gemara challenges Rav Huna’s statement: <b>And</b> in the case of a kid roasted <b>with</b> its forbidden <b>fat,</b> is the meat <b>forbidden? But didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say: There was an incident</b> that came <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan in the synagogue of</b> the town of <b>Maon, where a young goat was roasted with its fat, and</b> the people <b>came and asked Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> about the status of the meat, <b>and he said: Peel</b> away the meat <b>and eat</b> it <b>until</b> you <b>reach the</b> forbidden <b>fat?</b> This indicates that the flavor of the fat does not permeate the entire animal in which it is roasted. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> kid <b>was lean</b> and had so little fat that its flavor did not permeate throughout the animal.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda said:</b> That <b>was</b> a case of <b>a kidney</b> of a young goat roasted <b>with its</b> forbidden <b>fat, and</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>permitted it</b> to be eaten because there is a membrane that separates the fat from the kidney and prevents the fat from penetrating the kidney. <b>Ravin bar Rav Adda said:</b> That <b>was</b> a case of a small, non-kosher fish known as <b><i>kilkhit</i>,</b> which fell <b>into a stewpot [<i>ilpas</i>], and they came</b> to <b>ask Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> about its status. <b>And he said to them: Let a gentile cook [<i>kapeila</i>] taste it</b> in order to determine whether the flavor of the non-kosher fish has permeated the entire mixture.

### Part 4
<b>Rava said: Initially that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i> posed <b>a difficulty for me:</b> With regard to <b>a pot in which one cooked meat, one may not cook milk in it; and if he did cook</b> milk in it, the meat absorbed by the pot renders the milk forbidden if it <b>imparts flavor</b> to the milk. Similarly, if one cooked <b><i>teruma</i></b> in a pot, one <b>may not cook non-sacred</b> food <b>in it; and if one did cook</b> non-sacred food in it, the absorbed <i>teruma</i> renders the food in the pot sacred if it <b>imparts flavor</b> to it.

### Part 5
Rava explains: <b>Granted,</b> in the case of a pot used for <b><i>teruma</i>, a priest,</b> who is permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>, <b>can taste</b> the non-sacred food subsequently cooked in the pot in order to determine whether the <i>teruma</i> imparted flavor to the non-sacred food. <b>But</b> in a case where it is not known whether <b>meat</b> imparted flavor <b>into milk, who can taste it?</b> If the meat did impart flavor to the milk, it would be forbidden for any Jew to consume the milk. But <b>now that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: We rely on a gentile cook</b> in the case of the <i>kilkhit</i>, <b>here also we rely on a gentile cook</b> to taste it and say whether the meat has imparted flavor to the milk.

### Part 6
The Gemara summarizes the guidelines that determine when an item cooked with another item affects the status of the mixture. <b>Rava said: The Sages said</b> that there are cases where one relies <b>on</b> a Jew <b>tasting</b> the food, <b>and the Sages said</b> that there are some cases where one relies <b>on</b> a gentile <b>cook</b> to taste the food,
