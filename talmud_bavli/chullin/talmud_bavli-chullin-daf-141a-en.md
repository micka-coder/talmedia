### Part 1
<b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> that one is exempt in a case where the bird is sitting between two <b>tree branches,</b> which resembles a case where the bird is resting upon the nest itself in that the bird is sitting in both cases, <b>and</b> it would be clear <b>all the more so</b> that one is exempt if the mother <b>is hovering.</b> The Gemara responds: It <b>was necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to teach the case of <b>a hovering</b> bird in order to teach <b>that even</b> if <b>its wings are touching the nest,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother bird. Had the <i>baraita</i> taught the exemption in a case of a bird resting between two tree branches, one might have thought that this is because the bird’s wings are not touching the nest.

### Part 2
The Gemara now questions the <i>baraita</i> itself: How can the <i>baraita</i> state that even if the hovering bird’s wings are touching the nest, one is exempt from sending the bird? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>When its wings are touching the nest,</b> one is <b>obligated to send</b> away the mother? <b>Rav Yehuda said: When</b> the case of the hovering mother bird <b>is taught</b> in <b>the <i>baraita</i>,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a bird <b>touching</b> the nest <b>from the side.</b> In such a case, one is exempt because its wings are not touching the nest from above. By contrast, the mishna is referring to a case where the bird is hovering directly above the nest and touching the nest with its wings from above.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches: Even if <b>there is</b> only one <b>fledgling</b> or one egg, one is obligated to send away the mother, as it is stated: “If a bird’s nest happens before you” (Deuteronomy 22:6), indicating that one is obligated to send the mother bird away from the nest in any case. Additionally, if there were fledglings capable of flying or unfertilized eggs, one is exempt from sending away the mother bird, as it is stated in the same verse: “And the mother is resting upon the fledglings or upon the eggs.” From the juxtaposition of the fledglings and the eggs, one derives that the eggs or fledglings must be capable of living and they must require their mothers. With regard to this, <b>one of the Sages said to Rava: Say the opposite,</b> that if <b>there is only one fledgling or one egg,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother, <b>since we require</b> that the mother be “resting upon the <b>fledglings or</b> upon the <b>eggs,” and</b> this condition is <b>not</b> fulfilled with fewer than two.

### Part 4
Additionally, if <b>there were fledglings</b> capable of <b>flying or unfertilized eggs</b> in the nest, say that one is <b>obligated to send</b> the mother bird away, <b>as it is stated</b> in that verse: <b>“Nest,”</b> indicating that one is obligated to send the mother bird away from the <b>nest in any case.</b> Rava responds: <b>If so, let the verse write: And the mother is resting upon them.</b> For <b>what</b> reason does the verse state: <b>“And the mother is resting upon the fledglings or upon the eggs”?</b> It is <b>to compare the fledglings to the eggs and the eggs to the fledglings,</b> i.e., to indicate that the eggs or fledglings must be capable of living and must require their mothers. Fledglings that can fly and unfertilized eggs are therefore not included in the mitzva. Consequently, the word “nest” serves to indicate that one is obligated to send away the mother bird even if there is only one egg or fledgling in the nest.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one sent</b> away the mother bird <b>and it returned</b> to rest on the eggs, <b>even</b> if it returned <b>four or five times,</b> one is <b>obligated</b> to send it away again, <b>as it is stated: “You shall send [<i>shalle’aḥ teshallaḥ</i>] the mother”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7). The doubled verb indicates that one must send away the mother bird multiple times if needed. If one <b>said: I am hereby taking the mother and sending</b> away <b>the offspring,</b> he is still <b>obligated</b> to send away the mother even if he sent away the offspring, <b>as it is stated: “You shall send the mother.”</b> If one sent away the mother and <b>took the offspring and</b> then <b>returned them</b> to the mother’s nest, <b>and thereafter the mother returned</b> and rested <b>upon them,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother bird.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if the mother bird returned to rest on the eggs, even if it returned four or five times, one is obligated to send it away again, as it is stated: “You shall send [<i>shalle’aḥ teshallaḥ</i>].” With regard to this, <b>one of the Sages said to Rava: But say</b> instead that the word <b>“<i>shalle’aḥ</i>”</b> indicates that one must send away the mother <b>once,</b> and the word <b>“<i>teshallaḥ</i>”</b> indicates that one must do so <b>twice,</b> and beyond that there is no obligation.

### Part 7
Rava <b>said to him:</b> Actually, the <i>halakha</i> that one must send away the mother multiple times is not derived from the phrase “<i>shalle’aḥ teshallaḥ</i>.” Rather, the word <b>“<i>shalle’aḥ</i>”</b> indicates that one must send away the mother bird <b>even one hundred times,</b> and the word <b>“<i>teshallaḥ</i>”</b> teaches another matter: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the obligation to send away the mother bird in a case where one takes the eggs or the fledglings and wants to take the mother bird <b>for a discretionary purpose,</b> e.g., to eat it. In a case where one takes the eggs or the fledglings and needs the mother bird <b>for a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva,</b> e.g., the purification of a leper, <b>from where</b> is the <i>halakha</i> that he must send away the mother derived? <b>The verse states: “<i>Teshallaḥ</i>,”</b> to teach that <b>in any case</b> one must send away the mother bird.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Abba, son of Rav Yosef bar Rava, said to Rav Kahana: But</b> according to this explanation, the only <b>reason</b> that one must send away the mother bird even when needed for a matter involving a mitzva is <b>that the Merciful One wrote: “<i>Teshallaḥ</i>”; but</b> if <b>not</b> for <b>this, I would say</b> that when the mother is needed <b>for a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva,</b> one is <b>not</b> obligated to send her away. But this is difficult, as the sending of the mother bird <b>is</b> both <b>a positive mitzva and a prohibition,</b> as the verse states: “You shall not take the mother with the young; you shall send the mother” (Deuteronomy 22:6–7), <b>and</b> there is a principle that <b>a positive mitzva cannot override</b> both <b>a prohibition and a positive mitzva.</b>

### Part 9
Rav Kahana replied: <b>No,</b> the word “<i>teshallaḥ</i>” is <b>necessary</b> for a case <b>where one transgressed and took the mother</b> with the fledglings. In such a case, <b>he has</b> already <b>transgressed the prohibition,</b> and <b>there is</b> now only <b>a positive mitzva</b> to send away the mother. Perhaps one might say: <b>Let the positive mitzva</b> performed with the mother, e.g., the purification of the leper, <b>come and override the positive mitzva</b> of sending away the mother. Therefore, the word “<i>teshallaḥ</i>” <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so, and one is obligated to send away the mother.

### Part 10
The Gemara notes: <b>This works out well according to the one who teaches</b> that the criterion for determining whether one is flogged for violating a prohibition that entails fulfillment of a positive mitzva is whether he <b>fulfilled</b> the mitzva immediately afterward <b>or did not fulfill it.</b> If he does not fulfill the mitzva immediately, he is flogged when he fails to do so. Consequently, if one does not send away the mother bird immediately after taking her with the fledglings, he has immediately violated the prohibition, and only the requirement to fulfill the positive mitzva remains.

### Part 11
The Gemara continues: <b>But according to the one who teaches</b> that the criterion for determining whether one is flogged in that case is whether he <b>negated</b> the possibility of fulfilling the positive mitzva <b>or did not negate it,</b> and one is flogged only if he performed an action that renders it impossible to fulfill the mitzva, this explanation does not work out well. After all, <b>as long as one has not slaughtered</b> the mother bird, he <b>has not transgressed the prohibition,</b> since he may still send her away. Consequently, even if one takes the mother, as long as he has not slaughtered her, the prohibition remains in addition to the positive mitzva. If so, there is no need for the Torah to teach that the obligation to send away the mother bird applies in the case of a mitzva.

### Part 12
<b>And furthermore,</b> one may ask: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> that the word <b>“<i>shalle’aḥ</i>” indicates</b> that the mitzva to send away the mother bird applies only <b>at the outset,</b> i.e., before taking the fledglings, one who takes the mother together with the fledglings violates both the prohibition and the positive mitzva associated with it, such that <b>even a positive mitzva does not</b> remain.

### Part 13
<b>Rather, Mar bar Rav Ashi said:</b> The word “<i>teshallaḥ</i>” is necessary to indicate that the mitzva to send away the mother bird applies in a case <b>where one took her in order to send</b> her away immediately. In such a case, <b>there is no prohibition,</b> as one intends to send her away, but <b>there is</b> still <b>a positive</b> mitzva to send her away. <b>And</b> therefore, one might have said: <b>Let</b> another <b>positive mitzva,</b> e.g., taking the mother for the purification of a leper, <b>come and override the positive mitzva</b> of sending the mother. Therefore, the word “<i>teshallaḥ</i>” indicates that the mitzva of sending the mother bird applies even in such a case.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the strength of that</b> other <b>positive mitzva over this positive mitzva</b> of sending away the mother bird? Why might the former override the latter? The Gemara responds: It might <b>enter your mind</b> to say that <b>since the Master said: Great</b> is <b>peace between a man and his wife, as the Torah said</b> that <b>the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, which is written in sanctity, shall be erased on the waters</b> as part of the ritual of a woman suspected by her husband of adultery (see Numbers 5:23) in order to clear her from suspicion and restore peace between her and her husband, therefore, perhaps the <i>halakha</i> should be more lenient with regard to the leper.

### Part 15
The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this leper, since as long as he is not purified he is prohibited from</b> engaging in <b>marital relations, as it is written: “But he shall dwell outside his tent seven days”</b> (Leviticus 14:8), and when the verse states: <b>“His tent,” this</b> is referring to <b>his wife,</b> such that one may derive <b>from here that</b> a leper <b>is prohibited from</b> engaging in <b>marital relations,</b> perhaps his purification ceremony should take precedence. This is because <b>perhaps you</b> will <b>say: Since he is prohibited from</b> engaging in <b>marital relations, let his positive mitzva</b> of purification <b>come and override the positive mitzva of the sending</b> away <b>of</b> the mother bird from <b>the nest.</b> Therefore, the word “<i>teshallaḥ</i>” <b>teaches us</b> that even so, one may not take the mother bird.

### Part 16
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who takes the mother</b> bird <b>with</b> its <b>fledglings, Rabbi Yehuda says: He is flogged</b> for taking the mother bird, <b>and</b> he <b>does not send</b> away the mother. <b>And the Rabbis say: He sends</b> away the mother <b>and is not flogged,</b> as <b>this is the principle:</b> With regard to <b>any prohibition that entails</b> a command to <b>arise</b> and <b>perform</b> a mitzva, <b>one is not flogged for its</b> violation.

### Part 17
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that according to Rabbi Yehuda, one who takes the mother with the offspring is flogged. With regard to this, <b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel raises a dilemma:</b> Is <b>the reasoning</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yehuda that he holds</b> that <b>one is flogged for</b> violation of <b>a prohibition that entails</b> fulfillment <b>of a positive mitzva?</b> Accordingly, one is flogged for transgressing the prohibition: “You shall not take the mother with the young,” which entails the fulfillment of: “You shall send the mother.”

### Part 18
The second possibility is now presented: <b>Or perhaps in general</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> that <b>one is not flogged for</b> violation of <b>a prohibition that entails</b> fulfillment <b>of a positive mitzva; and here, this is the reason</b> one is flogged for taking the mother: It is <b>because he holds</b> that when the verse states: “You shall send the mother [<i>shalle’aḥ teshallaḥ</i>]” (Deuteronomy 22:7), the word <b>“<i>shalle’aḥ</i>” indicates</b> that the mitzva to sending the mother bird applies only <b>at the outset,</b> i.e., when encountering the nest. Accordingly, this is not a case of a prohibition that entails the performance of a positive mitzva, but an independent prohibition, for which one is liable to receive lashes.

### Part 19
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from that which is taught: <b>A thief and a robber are included among</b> those who are liable to receive <b>lashes</b> by Torah law. A thief violates the prohibition of: “You shall not steal” (Leviticus 19:11), and a robber violates the prohibition of: “You shall not rob” (Leviticus 19:13); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The Gemara continues: <b>But here,</b> the prohibition against robbing <b>is a prohibition that entails</b> fulfillment <b>of a positive mitzva, as the Merciful One states: “You shall not rob”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), and: <b>“And he shall restore the robbed item”</b> (Leviticus 5:23). And nevertheless, Rabbi Yehuda deems one liable to receive lashes for transgressing the prohibition against robbing. Therefore, <b>conclude from it</b> that <b>the reasoning</b> of the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the mishna is <b>that he holds</b> that <b>one is flogged for</b> violation of <b>a prohibition that entails</b> fulfillment <b>of a positive mitzva.</b>

### Part 20
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to him: Didn’t I</b> already <b>tell you</b> that <b>any <i>baraita</i> that is not taught</b> in the study <b>hall</b>
