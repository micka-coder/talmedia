### Part 1
<b>One may move all metal lamps</b> on Shabbat, even old ones, because they do not become repugnant like earthenware lamps, <b>except for</b> a metal <b>lamp that one kindled on that same Shabbat</b> and that was burning when Shabbat began, which it is prohibited to move for the entire Shabbat due to the prohibition against extinguishing.

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects that analogy. <b>And perhaps</b> it <b>is different there,</b> in the case of the burning lamp, <b>as he set it aside by</b> direct <b>action</b> when he kindled the lamp. By contrast, in the case of an animal, he did not set it aside, and therefore, perhaps once it is slaughtered it is permitted.

### Part 3
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said:</b> When Rav said that the <i>halakha</i> that consumption of the animal is prohibited for that day is the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, the reference <b>is</b> to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to one who cooks, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who cooks on Shabbat,</b> if he did so <b>unwittingly, he may eat</b> what he cooked. If he acted <b>intentionally, he may not eat</b> what he cooked. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he cooked the food <b>unwittingly, he may eat</b> it <b>at the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> as the Sages penalized even one who sinned unwittingly by prohibiting him from deriving immediate benefit from the dish that he cooked. If he cooked it <b>intentionally, he may never eat</b> from it.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar says:</b> If he acted <b>unwittingly,</b> the food <b>may be eaten at the conclusion of Shabbat by others, but not by him.</b> If he cooked the food <b>intentionally, it may never be eaten, neither by him nor by others.</b> According to Rav, the mishna is referring to a case where one slaughtered the animal unwittingly. According to Rabbi Yehuda, the slaughter is valid but it is prohibited to eat the animal on Shabbat.

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges this: <b>And let us interpret</b> the mishna as referring <b>to</b> a case where he slaughtered the animal <b>intentionally, and</b> explain that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who rules that eating the animal in such a case is permitted only after the conclusion of Shabbat.

### Part 7
The Gemara responds: That possibility should <b>not enter your mind, as</b> the case of slaughter on Shabbat is juxtaposed to and <b>taught</b> in a manner <b>similar to</b> the case of slaughter on <b>Yom Kippur. Just as</b> with regard to slaughter on <b>Yom Kippur,</b> it <b>is no different</b> whether one slaughtered it <b>unwittingly and</b> it <b>is no different</b> whether he slaughtered it <b>intentionally, he may not eat</b> it that day due to the fast, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to slaughter on Shabbat, it <b>is no different</b> whether he slaughtered it <b>unwittingly and</b> it <b>is no different</b> whether he slaughtered it <b>intentionally, he may not eat</b> it that day. Rabbi Meir, though, deems it permitted for one who cooked unwittingly to eat the cooked food on Shabbat.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And can you interpret</b> the mishna as referring <b>to</b> a case of <b>unwitting</b> slaughter <b>and</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? But isn’t it taught</b> in the mishna: <b>Although he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty? One is liable to be executed only if he intentionally performs labor on Shabbat. The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: Although</b> if he slaughtered it <b>intentionally he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty, <b>here,</b> in a case <b>where</b> he slaughtered the animal <b>unwittingly, his slaughter is valid.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara challenges: <b>And let us interpret</b> the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar, who says:</b> It <b>is no different</b> whether he cooked <b>unwittingly and</b> it <b>is no different</b> whether he cooked <b>intentionally; he may not eat it</b> on Shabbat. The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar draws a distinction with regard to the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> in that he permits eating food cooked on Shabbat <b>for others and not for him,</b> while <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>teaches: His slaughter is valid,</b> without qualification, indicating that with regard to his ruling it <b>is no different for him and</b> it <b>is no different for others.</b>

### Part 10
§ <b>The <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav: One who cooks on Shabbat unwittingly may eat</b> the food that he cooked; if he did so <b>intentionally, he may not eat</b> the food that he cooked, <b>and Rav silenced him.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>Rav silenced him? If we say</b> it is <b>because</b> Rav <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and the <i>tanna</i> taught</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> can it be that merely <b>because he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda he silences one who teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir?</b>

### Part 12
<b>And furthermore, does</b> Rav <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? But doesn’t Rav Ḥanan bar Ami say: When Rav issues a ruling to his students, he issues a ruling in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and when he teaches in</b> his <b>public lecture</b> delivered on the Festival, <b>he teaches in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, due to</b> his concern that <b>the ignoramuses</b> would treat the prohibition of labor on Shabbat with disdain?

### Part 13
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>the <i>tanna</i> taught</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>before</b> Rav <b>during the public lecture</b> and Rav silenced him so that the ignoramuses would not learn from him, <b>is that to say</b> that <b>everyone</b> attending the public lecture <b>listens to the <i>tanna</i></b> who is citing the <i>baraita</i>? There is no need to silence the <i>tanna</i>, because <b>they listen to the disseminator [<i>amora</i>],</b> the Sage who repeats what he hears from Rav loudly for the benefit of those attending the lecture, and the <i>amora</i> quoted Rav’s ruling in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The <i>tanna</i> taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one who <b>slaughters before Rav: One who slaughters</b> an animal <b>on Shabbat unwittingly may eat</b> from the slaughtered animal; if he slaughtered it <b>intentionally, he may not eat</b> from the slaughtered animal. Rav <b>said to</b> the <i>tanna</i>: <b>What do you think,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir? Rabbi Meir deems</b> eating <b>permitted only in</b> the case of <b>one who cooks</b> unwittingly on Shabbat, <b>as</b> even before he cooks the food <b>it is fit to be chewed [<i>lakhos</i>],</b> i.e., to be eaten uncooked, in a permitted manner, and therefore it was not set aside from use when Shabbat began. <b>But</b> in the case of one who <b>slaughters</b> an animal, <b>where</b> the meat was <b>not fit to chew,</b> Rabbi Meir does <b>not</b> permit eating it on Shabbat, because it was set aside from use on Shabbat.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t the mishna</b> addressing the case <b>of one who slaughters</b> an animal, <b>and Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav taught in the name of Rav: Consumption</b> of the animal is <b>prohibited for</b> that <b>day, and</b> the members of <b>the company</b> of Sages, i.e., those in the academy, <b>tended to say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> from which it may be inferred: <b>But Rabbi Meir permits</b> consumption of the slaughtered animal even on Shabbat, and he is not concerned that the animal was set aside from use when Shabbat began?

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: <b>When Rabbi Meir permits</b> consumption of the slaughtered animal even on Shabbat,
