<b>and Rabbi Shimon exempts</b> him entirely.

### Part 2
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> according to <b>Rabbi Shimon, whichever way you</b> look at it, it is difficult. <b>If a prohibition takes effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, <b>let</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>deem</b> one <b>liable</b> for eating non-kosher meat and <b>also due to</b> the prohibition of eating the sciatic <b>nerve.</b> Conversely, <b>if a prohibition does not take effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, <b>let</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>deem</b> one <b>liable due to the</b> prohibition of eating meat from <b>a non-kosher</b> species, <b>which preceded</b> the prohibition of the sciatic nerve. <b>And if</b> Rabbi Shimon holds that sciatic <b>nerves do not impart flavor,</b> and therefore the prohibition of eating non-kosher meat does not apply, <b>let</b> him <b>deem</b> one <b>liable due to</b> the prohibition of eating the sciatic <b>nerve.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rava said</b> in response: <b>Actually</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>holds</b> that sciatic <b>nerves do not impart flavor,</b> and therefore they are not subject to the prohibition of eating non-kosher meat. <b>And</b> the reason the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerves does not apply to non-kosher animals is that <b>it is different there, because the verse states: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve”</b> (Genesis 32:33). This teaches that the prohibition applies only to a species <b>whose</b> sciatic <b>nerve is forbidden but whose meat is permitted,</b> and <b>excludes this</b> case of a non-kosher animal, <b>whose</b> sciatic <b>nerve</b> would be <b>forbidden and whose meat</b> would also be <b>forbidden.</b>

### Part 4
§ Having discussed the status of the sciatic nerve of a non-kosher animal, the Gemara addresses the status of the sciatic nerve of a kosher animal that did not undergo a proper ritual slaughter. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>one who eats the sciatic nerve of an unslaughtered carcass, Rabbi Meir deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes, <b>and the Rabbis say: He is liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes.

### Part 5
<b>And the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Meir</b> in a case <b>where one eats the sciatic nerve of a burnt offering or of an ox that is stoned that he is liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes. The prohibitions concerning a burnt offering and an ox that is stoned are more severe than that of the sciatic nerve, in that it is forbidden to derive any benefit from them, whereas the sciatic nerve is merely forbidden for consumption. Consequently, these prohibitions take effect even with regard to the sciatic nerve, despite the fact that the sciatic nerve was already forbidden before the animal was consecrated or before it gored a person and became liable to be stoned.

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges: <b>And who is this <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>does not hold that in</b> the case of a more <b>inclusive prohibition,</b> the <b>prohibition takes effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, and consequently, according to his opinion the prohibition of eating an unslaughtered animal, which applies to the entire animal, does not take effect with regard to the sciatic nerve. Yet, <b>he</b> does <b>hold</b> that where the second prohibition is both a more <b>inclusive prohibition</b> and a more <b>stringent prohibition,</b> it does take effect, and therefore the prohibition of eating a burnt offering or an ox that is stoned does take effect with regard to the sciatic nerve.

### Part 7
<b>Rava said: It is Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> who holds that a more inclusive prohibition does not take effect where there is an already existing prohibition. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 106a): One who is <b>ritually impure who ate sacrificial</b> food, <b>whether it was ritually impure sacrificial</b> food <b>or ritually pure sacrificial</b> food, is <b>liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> if he did so intentionally and to bring a sliding-scale offering if he did so unwittingly.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: An impure</b> individual <b>who ate pure</b> sacrificial food is <b>liable.</b> But <b>an impure</b> individual <b>who ate impure</b> sacrificial food is <b>exempt, as he merely ate an impure item,</b> and the prohibition of eating sacrificial food while one is impure does not apply to impure sacrificial food.

### Part 9
The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> According to your logic, this <i>halakha</i> would apply <b>even</b> in a case of <b>an impure</b> individual <b>who ate</b> what had been <b>pure</b> sacrificial food, because <b>once he has touched it, he has</b> thereby <b>rendered it impure.</b> Yet, in such a case, he is certainly liable for eating it. So too, an impure individual who ate impure sacrificial food is liable.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>The Rabbis are saying well to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili;</b> why does Rabbi Yosei HaGelili disagree? <b>And Rava said</b> in elaboration of the dispute: <b>In</b> a case where the person’s <b>body became impure and</b> then <b>afterward</b> the sacrificial <b>meat became impure, everyone agrees that</b> he is <b>liable</b> if he eats the meat, <b>as the prohibition</b> of eating sacrificial meat while impure, which carries the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>, preceded</b> the prohibition of eating impure sacrificial meat.

### Part 11
<b>They disagree when</b> the <b>meat became impure and</b> then <b>afterward the</b> person’s <b>body became impure. The Rabbis hold</b> that a more <b>inclusive prohibition</b> takes effect even where there is an already existing prohibition. Consequently, <b>since</b> the prohibition for an impure person to eat sacrificial meat is more inclusive than the prohibition for a pure person to eat impure sacrificial meat, <b>as</b> an impure person <b>is liable</b> for eating even <b>pure pieces</b> of sacrificial meat that are permitted to the rest <b>of the world, he is also liable</b> for this prohibition when he eats <b>an impure piece</b> of sacrificial meat.

### Part 12
<b>And Rabbi Yosei HaGelili does not</b> accept the principle that a more <b>inclusive prohibition</b> takes effect even where there is an already existing prohibition, <b>as</b> he holds that <b>we do not say that since</b> it applies to cases that were not yet prohibited it applies to all cases.

### Part 13
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> even according to <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> HaGelili, <b>granted that he does not</b> hold that a more <b>inclusive prohibition</b> always takes effect where there is an already existing prohibition. But <b>in</b> the case of an already existing <b>lenient prohibition,</b> a more <b>stringent prohibition should come</b> and <b>take effect on</b> the more <b>lenient prohibition. And what is</b> the more stringent prohibition? The prohibition due to the <b>impurity of</b> a person’s <b>body, as</b> one who eats sacrificial food when he has <b>impurity of the body</b> is liable <b>to <i>karet</i>,</b> whereas a pure person who eats impure sacrificial food is merely liable to be flogged. Consequently, the prohibition of eating sacrificial food while impure should apply even though the meat became impure before the person became impure.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Ashi said: Who</b> can <b>say to us that</b> the prohibition due to the <b>impurity of</b> a person’s <b>body is</b> more <b>stringent? Perhaps</b> the prohibition due to the <b>impurity of the meat is</b> more <b>stringent, as</b> impure meat <b>does not have</b> the possibility of restoring its state of <b>purity</b> via immersion <b>in a ritual bath,</b> whereas a ritually impure person can become pure in this manner.
