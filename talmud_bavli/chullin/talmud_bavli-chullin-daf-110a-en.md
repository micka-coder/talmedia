### Part 1
of a suckling lamb or calf <b>that one cooked</b> together <b>with</b> the <b>milk</b> it contains <b>is prohibited.</b> There, <b>even</b> if one roasted it he may <b>not</b> eat it <b>after the fact.</b> To preserve symmetry, the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> in <b>the first clause</b> in this manner <b>as well,</b> stating: An udder <b>that one cooked</b> in its milk is permitted.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara above cited a second version of Rav’s opinion, according to which an udder that was roasted without being torn is prohibited for consumption. The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabbi Elazar ascended</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael <b>he found Ze’eiri</b> and <b>said to him: Is there a <i>tanna</i> who taught Rav</b> that <b>an udder</b> roasted without first being torn is prohibited? Ze’eiri <b>showed him Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi.</b> Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>I did not teach</b> Rav that <b>an udder</b> is prohibited <b>at all;</b> rather, <b>Rav found</b> an unguarded <b>valley and fenced it in.</b> Rav taught this stringent ruling as an additional safeguard in Babylonia, where Jews were not careful about the prohibition of meat cooked in milk.

### Part 3
The Gemara elaborates: <b>As</b> when <b>Rav arrived in Tatlefush, he heard a certain woman saying to another: How much milk does it require to cook a quarter</b> weight <b>of meat?</b> Rav <b>said:</b> Evidently, these people <b>are not learned</b> enough in <i>halakha</i> to know <b>that meat</b> cooked <b>in milk is prohibited.</b> Rav <b>tarried</b> in that place, <b>and prohibited</b> even <b>udders to them,</b> so that they would not come to violate the prohibition of meat cooked in milk.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Kahana teaches</b> that Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi replied to Rabbi Elazar in <b>that</b> manner described above. By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Abba teaches</b> that Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi said: <b>I taught</b> Rav only that <b>the udder of</b> an animal <b>nursing</b> offspring is prohibited, as its udder contains much milk. <b>And due to the sharp</b> mind <b>of Rav Ḥiyya,</b> Rav’s teacher, he assumed that Rav too would understand this without his saying so explicitly. Therefore, he <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> to Rav with regard to <b>an unspecified udder.</b> Rav mistakenly thought that the ruling applies to all animals.

### Part 5
The Gemara relates that <b>Ravin and Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef arrived at the house of Rav Pappi.</b> The servants <b>brought before them a dish</b> made <b>of udder. Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef ate</b> of it, but <b>Ravin did not eat. Abaye said: Bereaved Ravin, why do you not eat? After all, Rav Pappi’s wife is the daughter of Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa, and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa was a master of</b> good <b>deeds,</b> who was meticulous in his performance of mitzvot. <b>Had</b> Rav Pappi’s wife <b>not heard in her father’s house</b> that such a dish is permitted, <b>she would not have made</b> it.

### Part 6
The Gemara relates: <b>In Sura they would not eat udders</b> at all, even torn and roasted. But <b>in Pumbedita they would eat udders. Rami bar Tamrei, who is</b> also called <b>Rami bar Dikulei, from Pumbedita, arrived in Sura on the eve of Yom Kippur.</b> Since it is a mitzva to eat and drink then, large quantities of meat were cooked, and <b>everyone brought out their udders</b> from the animals they had slaughtered and <b>threw them</b> away. Rami bar Tamrei <b>went</b> and <b>gathered</b> the udders, roasted them, and <b>ate them,</b> in accordance with his custom.

### Part 7
The residents of Sura <b>brought</b> Rami bar Tamrei <b>before Rav Ḥisda,</b> who <b>said to him: Why did you do this?</b> Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>I am from the place of Rav Yehuda, who eats</b> udders, and this is the accepted custom in Pumbedita. Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: And do you not hold</b> by the principle that the Sages <b>impose upon</b> a traveler <b>the stringencies of the place that he left and</b> also <b>the stringencies of the place to which he went?</b> You should have accepted the stringency of Sura and not eaten the udders. Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: That principle applies only to one who remains in the place he is visiting, but <b>I ate</b> the udders <b>outside the boundaries</b> of Sura.

### Part 8
Rav Ḥisda further asked Rami bar Tamrei: <b>And with what did you roast</b> the udders? Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to him:</b> I roasted them <b>with grape seeds</b> [<b><i>purtzenei</i></b>] I found in the vines there. Rav Ḥisda objected: <b>But</b> how could you roast the udders with grape seeds, as <b>perhaps they were from wine</b> used for <b>a libation</b> to idolatry, from which it is prohibited to derive benefit. Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to him:</b> These <b>were</b> old seeds that still lay there <b>after twelve months</b> had passed since the grapes were used, and any prohibition had expired, as by that point they are assumed to have lost any prohibited liquid that previously remained inside (see <i>Avoda Zara</i> 34a).

### Part 9
Rav Ḥisda further objected: <b>But perhaps</b> these seeds <b>were from stolen</b> property, i.e., they belonged to someone and it was prohibited for you to take them. Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to him:</b> Even so, in this case <b>there was</b> certainly <b>despair of the owners</b> of recovering them, <b>as grass was growing among them.</b> Since the owners had allowed them to lie there for so long, they had clearly given up all hope of retrieving them.

### Part 10
Rav Ḥisda <b>saw that</b> Rami bar Tamrei <b>had not donned phylacteries,</b> and <b>said to him: What is the reason that you have not donned phylacteries?</b> Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to him: He,</b> i.e., I, am suffering from <b>intestinal illness, and Rav Yehuda said</b> that one who has <b>intestinal illness is exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b>phylacteries,</b> which require a clean body, because he would have to remove them constantly to defecate.

### Part 11
Rav Ḥisda further <b>saw that</b> Rami bar Tamrei <b>had not placed</b> the <b>threads</b> of ritual fringes on his garment and <b>said to him: What is the reason that you do not have</b> the <b>threads</b> of ritual fringes? Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to him: It is a borrowed robe, and Rav Yehuda said:</b>
