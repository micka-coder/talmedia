### Part 1
<b>or with blood of the undomesticated animal</b> that did not flow from the neck and does not require covering, <b>one views</b> the blood <b>as though it is water. Rabbi Yehuda says: Blood does not nullify blood.</b> Therefore, even if the undomesticated animal’s blood, which one must cover, is not recognizable in this mixture, he is obligated to cover the mixture nevertheless.

### Part 2
With regard to <b>blood that spurts</b> outside the pit over which the animal was slaughtered, or onto a wall, <b>and</b> blood <b>that</b> remained <b>on the</b> slaughtering <b>knife,</b> one is <b>obligated to cover</b> it. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> is this the <i>halakha</i>? <b>When no blood</b> remains <b>there</b> from the slaughter <b>except that</b> blood. <b>But</b> if <b>blood</b> remains <b>there</b> from the slaughter <b>that is not that</b> blood, he is <b>exempt from covering</b> it.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 77b): In the case of <b>blood</b> of an offering fit for sacrifice <b>that was mixed with water, if</b> the mixture <b>has the appearance of blood</b> it is <b>fit</b> for sprinkling on the altar, even though the majority of the mixture is water. If the blood <b>was mixed with</b> red <b>wine, one views</b> the wine <b>as though it is water.</b> If that amount of water would leave the mixture with the appearance of blood it is fit for presentation. And likewise, if the blood <b>was mixed with the blood of</b> a non-sacred <b>domesticated animal or the blood of</b> a non-sacred <b>undomesticated animal, one considers</b> the non-sacred blood <b>as though it is water. Rabbi Yehuda says: Blood does not nullify blood.</b> Therefore, the priest presents the blood of the mixture on the altar.

### Part 4
The mishna teaches that in a case where water became mixed with the blood of an offering, if the mixture has the appearance of blood it is fit, despite the fact that there is more water than blood. Concerning this <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the <b>water fell into</b> the <b>blood. But</b> in a case where the <b>blood fell into</b> the <b>water,</b> the <b>first</b> drop of blood, and then the next <b>first</b> drop of blood, are <b>nullified</b> in the water, i.e., each drop is nullified in turn. Consequently, the mixture is unfit for presentation, regardless of whether it has the appearance of blood.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Pappa says: But with regard to</b> the mitzva of <b>covering</b> the blood of birds or undomesticated animals that are slaughtered, <b>it is not so.</b> In this case, even if the blood fell into water the mitzva of covering applies to it, provided the mixture has the appearance of blood. The blood is not nullified by the water <b>because there is no</b> permanent <b>rejection with regard to mitzvot</b> other than those that relate to sacrificial rites. Therefore, its nullification was merely temporary, but once there is enough blood in the water it reassumes its status of blood.

### Part 6
§ With regard to mixtures of blood and water, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: All</b> mixtures of blood and water that maintain <b>a reddish hue</b> are considered blood and <b>effect atonement</b> by being presented on the altar, <b>and render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to contracting ritual impurity, <b>and are</b> included in the <b>obligation of covering</b> the blood provided that the blood is from the slaughter of an undomesticated animal or bird. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is Rav Yehuda <b>teaching us?</b> If he is teaching us that such mixtures <b>effect atonement, we</b> already <b>learn</b> this from the mishna in tractate <i>Zevaḥim</i>. And if he is teaching us that such mixtures are included in the <b>obligation of covering</b> the blood, <b>we</b> already <b>learn</b> this in the mishna here.

### Part 7
Rather, it <b>was necessary for</b> Rav Yehuda to teach that such mixtures <b>render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to contracting ritual impurity, as this was not taught in a mishna. The Gemara challenges: It is <b>also</b> unnecessary to teach that such mixtures <b>render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to contracting ritual impurity. <b>If</b> the mixture has the status of <b>blood it renders</b> food <b>susceptible,</b> as does blood, <b>and if</b> the mixture has the status of <b>water it renders</b> food susceptible, as does water. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> this statement is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> the blood <b>was mixed with rainwater,</b> which does not render food susceptible without the intent or desire of the owner of the food. If the mixture is considered blood it renders food susceptible.

### Part 8
The Gemara challenges: With regard to <b>rainwater as well, since one took</b> it <b>and placed</b> it into a vessel containing blood, <b>he has ascribed significance</b> to the rainwater and it should be capable of rendering food susceptible. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> this statement is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> the rainwater <b>was mixed</b> with the blood <b>by itself,</b> i.e., it was not gathered and poured purposefully.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Asi of Neharbil says:</b> The statement of Rav Yehuda is referring <b>to blood plasma,</b> i.e., if the plasma has a reddish hue due to the blood, it has the status of blood and can render food susceptible to contracting ritual impurity. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti said:</b> Consumption of this plasma is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who consumes blood (see Leviticus 17:14), <b>provided that there is</b> at least one <b>olive-bulk</b> of actual blood. <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> Blood plasma that issues from a corpse that has a reddish hue <b>imparts ritual impurity in a tent, provided that there is</b> at least <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> of actual blood, which is the amount of a corpse’s blood that imparts ritual impurity.

### Part 10
<b>We learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Oholot</i> 4:5): <b>All liquids</b> that issue <b>from a corpse,</b> e.g., teardrops or breastmilk, <b>are ritually pure, except for its blood. And all</b> liquids that issue <b>from</b> a corpse that contain <b>a reddish hue</b> of blood <b>impart ritual impurity in a tent.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But are liquids</b> that issue from <b>a corpse ritually pure? And raise a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Tevul Yom</i> 2:1): With regard to <b>liquids</b> that issue <b>from one who immersed that day, liquids that issue from him</b> have the same status <b>as liquids that he touches.</b>
