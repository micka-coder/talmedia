and <b>you shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23). <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar hold</b> that with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose blood you are commanded</b> not to eat, <b>you are commanded with regard to its limbs,</b> i.e., you are prohibited from eating its limbs that were severed while it was still alive. Consequently, with regard to <b>these non-kosher</b> species <b>also, since you are commanded</b> not to eat <b>their blood, you are commanded with regard to their limbs.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that the verse indicates: <b>“And you shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23), but <b>rather</b> you shall eat <b>the flesh alone,</b> i.e., when the animal is no longer alive. Consequently, with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose flesh is permitted</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>you are commanded with regard to its limbs,</b> i.e., you are prohibited from eating its limbs that were severed while it was still alive. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose flesh is not permitted</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>you are not commanded with regard to its limbs,</b> i.e., the prohibition of eating limbs that were severed while it was still alive does not apply.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that a prohibition takes effect upon an already existing, less stringent prohibition, <b>why does he</b> need to derive this from <b>a verse? Let the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a limb</b> from a living animal <b>come and take effect on the prohibition</b> of eating meat from <b>a non-kosher</b> animal, as it is more stringent <b>since its prohibition applies</b> also <b>to descendants of Noah,</b> i.e., gentiles.

### Part 4
The Gemara responds: <b>Yes,</b> that <b>is indeed so.</b> Rabbi Yehuda does not need to derive this <i>halakha</i> from a verse, <b>and the verse was necessary</b> only <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who holds that a prohibition does not take effect where there is an already existing prohibition, even if the second prohibition is more stringent.

### Part 5
<b>This</b> fact that it is Rabbi Elazar who derives this <i>halakha</i> from the verse, as opposed to Rabbi Yehuda, <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The prohibition of eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal <b>applies with regard to</b> a limb from <b>a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or a bird,</b> and <b>whether</b> it is from <b>a non-kosher</b> species <b>or a kosher</b> species, <b>as it is stated: “Only be steadfast in not eating the blood,</b> for the blood is the life; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh” (Deuteronomy 12:23).

### Part 6
This verse indicates that with regard to <b>any</b> species <b>whose blood you are commanded</b> not to eat, <b>you are commanded with regard to its limbs,</b> i.e., you are prohibited from eating its limbs that were severed while it was still alive. <b>And any</b> species <b>about whose blood you are not commanded,</b> i.e., with regard to which the prohibition of eating blood does not apply, <b>you are not commanded with regard to their limbs.</b> Since the prohibition of eating blood applies even with regard to non-kosher species, the prohibition of eating limbs severed from a living animal also applies; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Elazar.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal <b>applies only to kosher</b> species, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And you shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23), but <b>rather</b> you shall eat <b>the flesh alone,</b> i.e., when the animal is no longer alive. Consequently, with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose flesh is permitted</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>you are commanded with regard to its limbs,</b> i.e., you are prohibited from eating its limbs that were severed while it was still alive. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose flesh is not permitted</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>you are not commanded with regard to its limbs,</b> i.e., the prohibition of eating limbs that were severed while it was still alive does not apply.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal <b>applies only with regard to a kosher</b> species <b>of domesticated animal,</b> but not with regard to undomesticated animals or fowl, even if they are kosher.

### Part 9
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the different opinions with regard to the name of one of the Sages cited in the upcoming discussion: <b>Shmuel, Sheila, Shimi.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabba bar Shmuel said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Yosef</b> who said the following statement. <b>And some say</b> the attributions as follows: <b>Rabba bar Sheila said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Yosef</b> who said; <b>and some say</b> the attributions as follows: <b>Rabba bar Shimi said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Yosef</b> who said: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir</b> that the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal applies only with regard to a kosher species of domesticated animal?

### Part 11
It is that the <b>verse states:</b> “Then <b>you shall slaughter of your cattle and of your sheep”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:21). This verse is closely followed by the verse that serves as the source of the prohibition to eat a limb severed from a living animal (Deuteronomy 12:23), indicating that the prohibition applies only to kosher domesticated animals.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Eliezer about whether the prohibition of eating a limb severed from a living animal applies with regard to non-kosher species is only <b>with regard to Jews. But with regard to descendants of Noah,</b> i.e., gentiles, <b>everyone agrees</b> that they are <b>prohibited from</b> eating a limb from a living <b>non-kosher</b> species of animal just <b>like</b> they are prohibited from eating a limb from a living <b>kosher</b> species.

### Part 13
The Gemara comments that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A descendant of Noah is prohibited</b> from eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal from <b>non-kosher</b> species just <b>as</b> from <b>kosher</b> species. <b>But a Jew is prohibited</b> from eating a limb from a living animal of <b>kosher</b> species <b>only.</b>

### Part 14
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the correct wording of the <i>baraita</i> is that a Jew is prohibited from eating a limb from a living <b>kosher</b> species, in singular, <b>and</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who holds that the prohibition is limited to kosher domestic animals. And <b>there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the correct wording of the <i>baraita</i> is that a Jew is prohibited from eating a limb from living <b>kosher</b> species, in plural, <b>and</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that the prohibition also applies to a limb from a living bird or a living undomesticated animal of kosher species.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Sheizvi said: We learn</b> in the mishna <b>as well</b> that a gentile is prohibited from eating a limb from a living being even with regard to non-kosher species (<i>Teharot</i> 1:3): If one <b>ate a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> non-kosher bird, <b>he does not incur forty</b> lashes, <b>and slaughter does not purify it,</b> i.e., cause it to become permitted for consumption.

### Part 16
Rav Sheizvi clarifies: <b>With regard to what</b> case does the mishna issue this ruling? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring <b>to a Jew</b> who ate the limb, it is <b>obvious that slaughter does not purify it,</b> because it is a non-kosher species and cannot be made kosher. <b>Rather</b> is it <b>not</b> referring <b>to descendants of Noah</b> and teaching that even after the bird is slaughtered the limb severed while it was alive remains forbidden? <b>By inference,</b> it is clear from the mishna <b>that it is prohibited</b> for a gentile to eat a limb severed from a living being even from a non-kosher species.

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Mani bar Pattish raises a contradiction</b> between <b>the first clause</b> of that mishna, which states that one does not receive lashes for eating a limb severed from a living non-kosher bird, <b>and the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which states that a limb severed from a living non-kosher bird remains forbidden after the bird is slaughtered. The first clause indicates that the prohibition of eating a limb severed from a living creature applies only to kosher species, while the latter clause indicates that it applies also to non-kosher species. <b>And he answers</b> this contradiction by explaining that <b>the first clause</b> is referring <b>to a Jew and the latter clause</b> is referring <b>to a descendant of Noah.</b>

### Part 18
§ The Gemara continues discussing the prohibition of eating a limb severed from a living creature. <b>Rav says: A limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> animal <b>requires an olive-bulk</b> in order to render one who eats it liable to receive lashes. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is because the term: <b>Eating, is written with regard to</b> the prohibition of a limb severed from a living animal, and the definition of eating is the consumption of at least one olive-bulk.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Amram raises an objection</b> from the mishna cited above (<i>Teharot</i> 1:3): If one <b>ate a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> non-kosher bird, <b>he does not incur the forty</b> lashes, <b>and slaughter does not purify it,</b> i.e., cause it to become permitted. <b>But if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we require an olive-bulk</b> in order for one to receive lashes for eating a limb severed from a living creature, that mishna must be referring to such a case; therefore, it should <b>emerge</b> that he is liable to receive lashes <b>because he ate an olive-bulk</b> of a non-kosher bird.

### Part 20
The Gemara answers: This can be explained <b>as Rav Naḥman said</b> with regard to another issue, that it is referring to a case <b>of</b> eating <b>a small amount of meat</b> together with <b>sinews and bones</b> and the total volume is an olive-bulk. <b>Here also,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>of</b> eating <b>a small amount of meat</b> together with <b>sinews and bones.</b>

### Part 21
The Gemara raises another challenge to Rav’s statement that one receives lashes for eating a limb severed from a living animal only if he eats an olive-bulk: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof in this regard, <b>as Rav said:</b>
