### Part 1
The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>When</b> the phrase in <b>the verse</b> “of doves or of young pigeons” <b>was necessary,</b> it was <b>to exclude</b> a bird <b>that was the object of bestiality or</b> a bird that <b>was worshipped</b> as a deity.

### Part 2
As it could <b>enter your mind to say: Since it is written</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of disqualified offerings: <b>“Because their corruption [<i>moshḥatam</i>] is in them, there is a blemish in them”</b> (Leviticus 22:25), referring to two types of disqualifications: Corruption and blemish, <b>and the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Anywhere that</b> the term <b>corruption [<i>hashḥata</i>] is stated, it is</b> referring to <b>nothing other than a matter of licentiousness and idol worship.</b> The Gemara cites proofs for this claim: Corruption is referring to <b>matters of licentiousness, as it is written: “For all flesh had corrupted [<i>hishḥit</i>] their way upon the earth”</b> (Genesis 6:12); the word “way” alludes to sexual intercourse.

### Part 3
Corruption is also referring to <b>idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly [<i>tashḥitun</i>], and make you a graven image”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:16); one might have thought: <b>Any</b> type of offering <b>that a blemish disqualifies, matters of licentiousness and idol worship disqualify it, and any</b> type of offering <b>that a blemish does not disqualify, matters of licentiousness and idol worship do not disqualify it. And</b> with regard to <b>these birds, since blemishes do not disqualify them, as the Master says:</b> There is a requirement of <b>an unblemished state and male gender in</b> a sacrificial <b>animal and there is no</b> requirement of <b>an unblemished state and male gender in</b> sacrificial <b>birds, say</b> that <b>matters of licentiousness and idol worship</b> should <b>also not disqualify</b> the birds. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> from the phrase in the verse “of doves or of young pigeons” that a bird that was the object of bestiality and a bird that was worshipped as a deity are disqualified.

### Part 4
§ Apropos the discussion of the beginning of the yellowing of the neck plumage, the Gemara cites another matter where there is uncertainty as to whether an animal of a particular age is of uncertain status or an entity in and of itself. <b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>an animal burnt offering of a ram,</b> which is a sheep that is at least thirteen months old, <b>or of a lamb,</b> which is up to one year old, <b>and he brought a <i>palges</i>,</b> which is between one year and thirteen months old, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 5
The Gemara elaborates: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, do not raise a dilemma, as he says</b> that a <i>palges</i> <b>is an entity in and of itself, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 1:3): If one was obligated to bring a ram or lamb as an offering, and he <b>sacrificed</b> a <i>palges</i>, <b>he brings with it</b> the meal offering and <b>the libations of a ram</b> offering, namely, a meal offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mingled with four <i>log</i> of oil, and a libation of four <i>log</i> of wine, <b>but it does not fulfill his</b> obligation to bring <b>his offering.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the requirement to bring the meal offering and libations of a ram offering is derived from the verse in the portion of the libations: <b>“Or for a ram,</b> you shall prepare for a meal offering two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-third of a <i>hin</i> of oil” (Numbers 15:6); that serves <b>to include the <i>palges</i>,</b> whose meal offering and libations are like that of a ram. Based on that derivation, there is no uncertainty with regard to the status of the <i>palges</i>.

### Part 7
<b>When you raise a dilemma,</b> it is <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of bar Padda,</b> who holds that it is a case of uncertainty,
