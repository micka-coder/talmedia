### Part 1
<b>since</b> these testicles <b>do not heal, they are</b> considered <b>a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> animal even though they are still attached to the animal. Consequently, they are forbidden even after the animal is slaughtered. And <b>the one who permits</b> eating crushed testicles holds that <b>since they do not rot, there is vitality in them,</b> and they are not considered to have been detached from the animal.

### Part 2
<b>And the other</b> opinion, which holds that crushed testicles are forbidden, holds that <b>the</b> reason the testicles <b>do not rot</b> is not because they have vitality but rather <b>because air does not penetrate</b> the scrotum, and it is contact with air that would cause them to rot. <b>And the other</b> opinion, which holds that crushed testicles are permitted, holds <b>that the</b> fact <b>that they do not heal</b> is because <b>they have been struck with weakness,</b> but not because they are entirely devoid of vitality. Consequently, they should not be considered detached from the body.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Rav Shemen bar Abba: These crushed testicles are permitted</b> for consumption, <b>but you should not eat them due to</b> the dictum: <b>“And do not forsake the Torah of your mother”</b> (Proverbs 1:8). Since Rav Shemen bar Abba was from Babylonia, where it was customary to be stringent, it was prohibited for him to eat crushed testicles even when he was in Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 4
§ The Gemara cites other <i>halakhot</i> related to testicles. <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said:</b> With regard to <b>these testicles of goats,</b> from the time the goat is born <b>until</b> the goat is <b>thirty days</b> old, its testicles <b>are permitted without peeling</b> off the membrane that encloses them, because they are presumed not to contain blood. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward, if they contain semen they are forbidden, but if they do not contain semen they are permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How can we know</b> whether or not they contain semen? The Gemara answers: <b>If they have red streaks in them they are forbidden.</b> If they <b>do not have red streaks in them they are permitted.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara quotes a related discussion pertaining to three cases: With regard to <b>raw meat</b> that is eaten without being salted, <b>testicles</b> of an animal, <b>and</b> the large <b>veins</b> of the neck, <b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree about</b> the <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara points out: <b>In all</b> of their disputes with regard to other realms of <b>the Torah</b> where it is not clear which of them holds which opinion, the opinion of <b>Ravina is lenient, and</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa is stringent, and the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ravina to be lenient.</b> This applies to all their disputes <b>except for these three,</b> in <b>which Rav Aḥa is lenient and Ravina is stringent, and the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa to be lenient.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>raw meat that became red</b> from the blood inside it, if <b>one cut it and salted it,</b> it is <b>permitted even to</b> cook it in <b>a pot,</b> because the salt removes blood from meat. It is <b>also</b> permitted if one <b>hung it on a spit</b> in order to roast it, because <b>the blood is drawn out</b> by the heat of the fire. With regard to a case where one placed it <b>on coals, Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree about</b> the <i>halakha</i>: <b>One says</b> that the coals <b>draw out</b> the blood from the meat, <b>and one says</b> that the coals cause the meat to <b>shrivel</b> and harden, trapping the blood inside. <b>And similarly</b> Ravina and Rav Aḥa disagree with regard to <b>testicles</b> placed on coals, <b>and similarly</b> with regard to the large <b>veins</b> of the neck that were placed on coals.

### Part 7
§ Apropos raw meat placed on coals, the Gemara discusses a related topic. In a case where one wants to remove the hair from <b>the head</b> of an animal by placing it <b>in hot ashes,</b> if <b>one placed it</b> with the neck down so that <b>the location of the slaughter</b> is in the ashes, <b>the blood is drawn out</b> by the heat <b>and</b> the meat <b>is permitted.</b> But if one placed the head in the ashes <b>on</b> one of its <b>sides,</b> the blood <b>congeals</b> inside the head and cannot flow out, <b>and</b> therefore the head is <b>forbidden</b> for consumption. In a case where one <b>placed</b> the head down <b>on its nostrils,</b> if <b>he inserted something into</b> the nostrils to keep them open and allow the blood to flow out, the meat is <b>permitted, but</b> if he did <b>not</b> do so it is <b>forbidden.</b>

### Part 8
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say:</b> If the head was placed <b>on its nostrils or on the location of the slaughter,</b> the blood is <b>drawn out</b> and the meat is permitted. If he placed it <b>on</b> one of its <b>sides,</b> then <b>if</b> he <b>inserted something into</b> it in order to allow the blood to flow out, it is <b>permitted, and if not it is forbidden.</b>

### Part 9
§ The Gemara returns to the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: There are two nerves</b> included in the prohibition of the sciatic nerve. The <b>inner</b> nerve, which is <b>next to the bone, is forbidden</b> by Torah law, <b>and one is liable</b> to be flogged <b>for</b> eating <b>it.</b> The <b>outer</b> nerve, which is <b>next to the flesh, is forbidden</b> by rabbinic law, <b>and</b> therefore <b>one is not liable</b> to be flogged <b>for</b> eating <b>it.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the <b>inner</b> nerve, which is forbidden by Torah law, is <b>next to the flesh?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Aḥa said</b> that <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> The inner nerve is next to the bone, but it <b>bores</b> into the flesh as well.

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The outer</b> nerve <b>is next to the bone?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> This is referring to the spot <b>where the butchers</b> cut the leg open and <b>reveal</b> the nerve, and at that point in the leg the outer nerve is closest to the bone.

### Part 12
§ It <b>was stated:</b> With regard to <b>a butcher who</b> removed the forbidden fats of the animal, and yet <b>forbidden fat was found after</b> he completed his work, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that the butcher is held liable if there is forbidden fat remaining that is the size of <b>a barley grain. Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the butcher is held liable only if there is forbidden fat remaining that is the size <b>of an olive-bulk.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Rav Yehuda and Rabbi Yoḥanan are referring to two different levels of liability, <b>and they do not disagree. Here,</b> when Rabbi Yoḥanan said he is liable only if there is an olive-bulk of forbidden fat remaining, he was referring <b>to flogging him. There,</b> when Rav Yehuda said he is liable even he leaves forbidden fat the size of a barley grain, he was referring <b>to removing him</b> from his position as a butcher.

### Part 14
<b>Mar Zutra said</b> an alternative explanation: If the butcher left forbidden fat the size of <b>a barley grain in one place</b> he is liable, and if he left forbidden fat the size of <b>an olive-bulk,</b> he is liable <b>even</b> if it is spread out <b>in two or three places.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that with regard to <b>flogging him,</b> the butcher is liable only if he left forbidden fat the size of <b>an olive-bulk.</b> With regard <b>to removing him,</b> the butcher is liable even if he left forbidden fat the size of <b>a barley grain.</b>

### Part 15
§ The mishna stated (89b): <b>Butchers are not deemed credible</b> to say that the sciatic nerve was removed; this is the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: They are deemed credible about the sciatic nerve. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The Rabbis initially held that butchers are not deemed credible about the sciatic nerve, and subsequently <b>they retracted</b> and <b>said</b> that butchers are <b>deemed credible</b> in this regard.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> to him: Have the later <b>generations improved</b> such that butchers are more reliable than they were in earlier generations? The Gemara answers: <b>Initially, when</b> the Rabbis <b>held in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> that one must scrape around the flesh in order to remove the roots of the sciatic nerve, butchers <b>were not deemed credible,</b> due to the exertion involved in this process. <b>But later</b> the Rabbis <b>held in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that it is unnecessary to scrape around the flesh. Consequently, removing the sciatic nerve is not especially arduous, and butchers are deemed credible to say that they removed it.

### Part 17
<b>There are those who teach</b> this discussion <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, as follows: <b>And the Rabbis say: They are deemed credible about</b> the sciatic nerve <b>and about the</b> forbidden <b>fat. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They</b> subsequently <b>retracted</b> this opinion and <b>said</b> that butchers <b>are not deemed credible. Rav Naḥman says: Today</b> the butchers <b>are deemed credible.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: Have the later <b>generations improved</b> such that butchers are more reliable than they were in earlier generations? The Gemara answers: <b>Initially they held</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that one is not required to scrape around the flesh to remove the roots of the sciatic nerve, and therefore butchers were deemed credible to say that they removed it. The Rabbis <b>then</b> reversed their opinion and <b>held</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> that one is required to scrape around the flesh.

### Part 19
As <b>long as</b> the butchers <b>remembered</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> and did not scrape around the flesh to remove the roots of the sciatic nerve, <b>they were not deemed credible</b> to say that they removed it; <b>but now that they have forgotten</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> and have grown accustomed to scraping around the flesh to remove the roots of the sciatic nerve, <b>they are deemed credible.</b>

### Part 20
§ The mishna teaches that the Rabbis maintain that butchers are deemed credible about the sciatic nerve <b>and about the</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who mentioned anything about</b> forbidden <b>fat?</b> The topic of discussion in the mishna until this point is the sciatic nerve, not forbidden fat; why do the Rabbis mention forbidden fat? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> The butchers <b>are not deemed credible about</b> the sciatic nerve <b>or about the</b> forbidden <b>fat;</b> this is the statement of Rabbi Meir. <b>But the Rabbis say:</b> The butchers <b>are deemed credible about</b> the sciatic nerve <b>and about the</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b>

### Part 21
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Although it is prohibited for Jews to eat the sciatic nerve, <b>a</b> Jewish <b>person</b> may <b>send</b> the <b>thigh</b> of an animal <b>to a gentile with the sciatic nerve in it,</b> without concern that the gentile will then sell the thigh to a Jew and the Jew will eat the sciatic nerve. This leniency is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the place</b> of the sciatic nerve <b>is conspicuous</b> in the thigh.

### Part 22
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna’s statement that a Jew may send a thigh to a gentile indicates that if it is <b>whole, yes,</b> a Jew may send it to a gentile, but if the thigh has been <b>cut,</b> a Jew may <b>not</b> send it to a gentile. The Gemara asks: <b>What are we dealing with? If we say</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to a place where</b> all the butchers are Jewish but <b>they do not announce</b> publicly when they have sold to a gentile an animal that turns out to have a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>], then it is prohibited for Jews to purchase any meat from gentiles, due to the possibility that it was from an animal that was a <i>tereifa</i>.
