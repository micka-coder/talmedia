### Part 1
that it renders impure everything within it, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if it is <b>full of mustard</b> seeds, in which case most of the seeds do not come in contact with the sides of the vessel, and nevertheless all the mustard seeds become impure.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said to Rava: And let</b> it be derived that <b>an earthenware vessel becomes impure from</b> contact of an impure item with <b>its outer side by means of an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If all the</b> other types of <b>vessels, which do not become impure from</b> the presence of an impure item in <b>their airspace, become impure from</b> contact of an impure item with <b>their outer side,</b> then with regard to <b>an earthenware vessel, which becomes impure from</b> the presence of an impure item in <b>its airspace, isn’t it logical that it will become ritually impure from</b> contact of an impure item with <b>its outer side?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And every open vessel that has no sealed cover upon it</b> is impure” (Numbers 19:15), indicating that its impurity is dependent upon the mouth of the vessel. <b>Which is the vessel whose impurity hastily</b> takes effect just after the impure item enters <b>into its mouth? You must say</b> that is <b>an earthenware vessel. And</b> it is <b>when there is no sealed cover on it that</b> the vessel becomes <b>impure. But</b> when <b>there is a sealed cover on it,</b> the vessel is <b>pure,</b> as the earthenware vessel does not become impure from contact of an impure item with its outer side.

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> it be derived that <b>all the</b> other <b>vessels become impure from</b> the presence of an impure item in <b>their airspace by means of an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If an earthenware vessel, which does not become impure from</b> contact of an impure item with <b>its outer side, becomes impure from</b> the presence of an impure item in <b>its airspace,</b> then with regard to <b>all the</b> other <b>vessels, which become impure from</b> contact of an impure item with <b>their outer side, isn’t it logical that they will become ritually impure from</b> the presence of an impure item in <b>their airspace?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the carcasses of creeping animals: “And every earthenware vessel <b>into which [<i>tokho</i>]</b> any of them falls” (Leviticus 11:33), from which it is inferred: <b><i>Tokho</i>,</b> i.e., the airspace, <b>of this</b> earthenware vessel renders the vessel impure, <b>and not <i>tokho</i>,</b> the airspace, <b>of</b> any <b>other</b> kind of vessel.

### Part 6
The Gemara objects: How can the <i>halakha</i> be derived from the term <i>tokho</i> in that verse? <b>But didn’t</b> the Sages <b>interpret these</b> instances of <b><i>tokho</i></b> that appear in that verse and derive: Just as in the case of <i>tokho</i> that is stated with regard to transmitting impurity, the food is impure even though it did not come into contact with the vessel, so too, in the case of <i>tokho</i> that is stated with regard to the vessel becoming impure, the vessel is impure even though the impure item did not come into contact with it.

### Part 7
The Gemara explains: <b>Four</b> instances of the term <b><i>tokho</i></b> from which <i>halakhot</i> can be derived <b>are written: “<i>Tokho</i>”</b> is written, and <b><i>tokh</i></b> could have been written; those are two instances. Then, later in that verse, once again <b>“<i>tokho</i>”</b> is written, and <b><i>tokh</i></b> could have been written.

### Part 8
<b>One</b> instance is <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>itself,</b> that the vessel renders the food in its airspace ritually impure, <b>and one</b> instance is <b>to</b> teach the <b>verbal analogy</b> from which it is derived that the vessel becomes impure without contact with the impure item; <b>and one</b> source is to teach that <b><i>tokho</i>,</b> the airspace, <b>of this</b> earthenware vessel renders the vessel impure, <b>and not <i>tokho</i> of</b> any <b>other</b> kind of vessel; <b>and one</b> source is to teach <b><i>tokho</i>,</b> food in the airspace of an impure earthenware vessel becomes impure, <b>but not <i>tokh tokho</i>,</b> not food that is in the airspace of a vessel that is within an earthenware vessel, <b>and even</b> if that inner vessel is one of the other types of <b>vessel</b> purified through <b>rinsing</b> in the water of a ritual bath.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> it be derived that <b>all the</b> other <b>vessels</b> do <b>not become impure from</b> contact of an impure item with <b>their outer sides, but</b> rather <b>from</b> the presence of an impure item <b>inside them and with contact</b> with their inner sides <b>by means of an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If an earthenware vessel, which becomes impure from</b> the presence of an impure item in <b>its airspace, does not become impure from</b> contact of an impure item with <b>its outer side,</b> then with regard to <b>all the</b> other <b>vessels, which do not become impure from</b> the presence of an impure item in <b>their airspace, isn’t it logical that they do not become impure from</b> contact of an impure item with <b>their outer side?</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And every open vessel that has no sealed cover upon it is impure”</b> (Numbers 19:15), from which it is derived: <b>This</b> earthenware vessel (see Leviticus 11:33) <b>is</b> the one <b>that when there is not a sealed cover upon it,</b> it is <b>impure, but</b> when <b>there is a sealed cover upon it,</b> it is <b>pure. But</b> with regard to <b>all the</b> other <b>vessels, whether there is a sealed cover upon them or whether there is not a sealed cover upon them, they become impure.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> That which is <b>ritually pure in wooden vessels</b> is <b>ritually impure in metal vessels;</b> that which is <b>ritually pure in metal vessels</b> is <b>ritually impure in wooden vessels.</b>

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in explanation of the mishna: <b>Unfinished [<i>golmei</i>] wooden vessels</b> that are receptacles and are fit for use but work remains to complete their crafting are susceptible to becoming <b>impure. Flat</b> wooden utensils are <b>not susceptible to impurity. Unfinished metal vessels</b> are <b>not susceptible to impurity. Flat</b> metal utensils are susceptible to becoming <b>impure. It is found</b> that that which is <b>ritually pure in wooden vessels</b> is <b>ritually impure in metal vessels;</b> that which is <b>ritually pure in metal vessels</b> is <b>ritually impure in wooden vessels.</b>

### Part 13
<b>And these are</b> the <b>unfinished wooden vessels: Any</b> vessel <b>that</b> one plans in the <b>future to smooth, to set</b> gems or ornaments in it, <b>to plane</b> it, <b>to adorn</b> it with grooves and protuberances, <b>to rub</b> it and smooth it <b>with</b> the skin of <b>a tuna [<i>tunas</i>],</b> or if it is <b>lacking a base or a rim or a handle,</b> the vessel is susceptible to becoming <b>impure.</b> If the vessel is <b>lacking</b> the <b>hollowing</b> necessary to render it a receptacle, it is <b>not susceptible to impurity.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that if the vessel is <b>lacking hollowing,</b> it is not susceptible to becoming impure, as it is clearly not a vessel? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> only in a case <b>where one hollowed three <i>log</i> [<i>kefiza</i>] in</b> a receptacle that he intends to hold <b>one <i>kav</i>,</b> which contains six <i>log</i>. Even though it is a receptacle, since the receptacle is incomplete it is not susceptible to impurity.

### Part 15
<b>And these are</b> the <b>unfinished metal vessels: Any</b> vessel <b>that</b> one plans in the <b>future</b>
