that <b>perhaps each will</b> cause <b>the other</b> to <b>press</b> the knife.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Avin raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one slaughtered,</b> i.e., cut, <b>the gullet below</b> on the neck <b>and the windpipe above</b> on the neck, <b>or</b> cut <b>the gullet above</b> on the neck <b>and the windpipe below</b> on the neck, <b>his slaughter is valid.</b> Based on this, Rabbi Avin asks: <b>Why</b> is the slaughter valid? <b>But</b> in that case <b>there is no clear</b> and obvious <b>slaughter.</b>

### Part 3
<b>He raises the objection and he resolves it.</b> This <i>baraita</i> is not referring to cuts on two places on the neck; rather, it is referring <b>to slaughter performed</b> on a diagonal, <b>like</b> the point <b>of a reed [<i>kekulmos</i>]</b> fashioned into a writing utensil. The slaughterer begins cutting from the top of one <i>siman</i> and cuts diagonally downward so that when he reaches the second <i>siman</i>, the knife is lower down.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain bull that was slaughtered</b> with cuts <b>in two or three places</b> in the <i>simanim</i> on its neck. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta entered</b> the store <b>and took</b> a cut of meat <b>from the highest quality</b> parts of the animal, thereby demonstrating that the slaughter was valid. <b>Rabbi Zeira said to him: Our rabbi, you have taught us</b> through your actions that <b>the mishna:</b> If two people are grasping a knife and slaughtering one animal, even one above and one below, is referring even to a case <b>of two knives and two people</b> who are each cutting the <i>simanim</i> at a different part of the neck with their knives.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If <b>one concealed the knife</b> in the neck <b>between</b> one <b><i>siman</i> and</b> the other <b><i>siman</i>,</b> i.e., he inserted the knife between the windpipe and the gullet, <b>and he severed</b> the gullet first and then removed the knife and cut the windpipe, the slaughter is <b>not valid.</b> If one concealed the knife <b>beneath the hide</b> of the neck and then he cut both <i>simanim</i>, the slaughter is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav <b>teaching us? We</b> already <b>learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> explicitly in a mishna (32a): <b>Or</b> if one cut one <i>siman</i> and <b>concealed the knife beneath the second</b> <i>siman</i> <b>and severed it, Rabbi Yeshevav says:</b> The animal is <b>an unslaughtered carcass</b> and imparts ritual impurity through contact with it and carrying it. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> and although eating it is prohibited, it does not transmit ritual impurity. Both agree that the slaughter is not valid in the sense that it does not permit the consumption of the meat of the animal.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> this <i>halakha</i> is learned <b>from the mishna</b> alone, <b>I would say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies only in a case where one conceals the knife beneath the gullet and cuts it <b>from below to above,</b> i.e., from the nape to the front of the neck, <b>because he did not perform</b> the slaughter <b>in the</b> standard <b>manner of slaughter. But</b> if he cut the gullet <b>from above to below,</b> i.e., from the front of the neck to the nape, <b>since he performed</b> the slaughter <b>in the</b> standard <b>manner of slaughter, say</b> that the slaughter is <b>valid.</b> Therefore, Rav <b>teaches us</b> that with regard to any case where one conceals the knife during slaughter, his slaughter is not valid.

### Part 8
The Gemara proceeds to analyze the second part of that which Rav Yehuda says that Rav says: If one concealed the knife <b>beneath the hide</b> of the neck and then he cut both <i>simanim</i> in the standard manner the slaughter is <b>valid. The school of Rav say</b> that Rav says that in a case where one conceals the knife <b>beneath the hide</b> and cuts the <i>simanim</i> of the animal, <b>I do not know</b> whether the slaughter is valid, or whether it is not valid because he concealed the knife during the slaughter.

### Part 9
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>the school of Rav, who say: Beneath the hide, I do not know,</b> if one concealed the knife <b>beneath a cloth</b> that is around the animal’s neck, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If one concealed the knife <b>beneath tangled wool</b> on the neck of a sheep, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara concludes: These dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>concealed</b> the knife <b>in</b> cutting <b>the minority of the <i>simanim</i></b> and cut the majority of the <i>simanim</i> in the standard manner, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> by cutting <b>two</b> animals’ <b>heads simultaneously, his slaughter is valid.</b> If <b>two</b> people <b>are grasping a knife and slaughtering</b> one animal, <b>even</b> if each is holding a knife and slaughtering <b>one above and one below,</b> with each one slaughtering at a different point in the neck, their <b>slaughter is valid.</b> If <b>one decapitated</b> the animal <b>in one</b> motion and did not slaughter the animal in the standard manner of drawing the knife back and forth, the slaughter is <b>not valid.</b> In a case where <b>one was</b> in the process of <b>slaughtering</b> the animal in the standard manner <b>and he decapitated</b> the animal <b>in one</b> motion, <b>if</b> the length <b>of the knife</b> is equivalent to <b>the</b> breadth of the animal’s <b>entire neck,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 12
If <b>one was</b> in the process of <b>slaughtering</b> two animals simultaneously, <b>and he decapitated two heads in one</b> motion, <b>if</b> the length <b>of the knife</b> is equivalent to <b>the breadth of an entire neck</b> of <b>one</b> of the animals, the slaughter is <b>valid. In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that one must be concerned about the length of the knife, <b>said?</b> It is <b>when one drew</b> the knife <b>back and did not draw</b> it <b>forth, or drew it forth and did not draw it back; but</b> if <b>he drew it back and forth, even</b> if the knife was of <b>any length, even</b> if he slaughtered <b>with a scalpel [<i>be’izemel</i>],</b> the slaughter is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna stated: If one decapitated the animal in one motion, the slaughter is not valid. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Shmuel said:</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “Their tongue is a sharpened [<i>shaḥut</i>] arrow, it speaks deceit”</b> (Jeremiah 9:7). Just as an arrow is propelled by drawing back the bowstring, so too, slaughter [<i>sheḥita</i>] must be performed by drawing the knife across the animal’s neck and not by pressing the knife or striking the neck with the knife.

### Part 14
Likewise, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And he shall slaughter [<i>veshaḥat</i>]</b> the young bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:5). The term <b>“<i>veshaḥat</i>”</b> means <b>nothing other than: And he shall draw</b> the knife across the neck of the animal. <b>And similarly,</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “And King Solomon made two hundred targets <b>of drawn [<i>shaḥut</i>] gold”</b> (I Kings 10:16), meaning gold that is smoothed in the manner of goldsmiths. <b>And</b> the verse <b>states: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow, it speaks deceit”</b> (Jeremiah 9:7).

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the purpose of citing the additional verse introduced with the term: <b>And</b> the verse <b>states?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>And if you would say</b> that the term <b>“drawn [<i>shaḥut</i>] gold”</b> means that the gold <b>was spun like</b> soft <b>thread [<i>keḥut</i>], come</b> and <b>hear: “Their tongue is a sharpened [<i>shaḥut</i>] arrow.”</b> In this verse, <i>shaḥut</i> means drawn like the bowstring that propels an arrow, and is not a reference to thread.

### Part 16
The Gemara relates: <b>Rava would examine the arrow for Rabbi Yona bar Taḥlifa</b> to ensure that there were no notches in it. <b>And</b> Rava shot the arrow and <b>slaughtered a bird with it as it was flying.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>And perhaps</b> when the arrow cut the bird’s neck <b>it performed</b> an inverted slaughter, with the arrow <b>concealed</b> in the neck, and cut the <i>simanim</i> from back to front. The Gemara responds: <b>We see</b>
