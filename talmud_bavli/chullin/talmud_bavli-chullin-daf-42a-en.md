### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say: If it is so that</b> his wife <b>gave birth, it would have</b> generated <b>publicity</b> and been common knowledge; therefore, one might conclude that the slaughter is valid even if he declared that the slaughter is for the sake of the burnt offering of his wife after childbirth, as in fact she did not give birth. To counter this, Rabbi Elazar <b>teaches us</b> that the slaughter is not valid. <b>Say</b> that his wife <b>miscarried</b> and is liable to bring an offering, but it is not common knowledge, because the baby was not born alive.<br/>
