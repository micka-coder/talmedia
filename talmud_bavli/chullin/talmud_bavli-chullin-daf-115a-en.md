### Part 1
then <b>let</b> the product of <b>an action</b> that desecrates <b>Shabbat,</b> e.g., food cooked on Shabbat, <b>be prohibited</b> for consumption, <b>as</b> desecration of Shabbat <b>is</b> a practice of which God states: <b>I have made</b> it <b>abominable to you,</b> in that it is prohibited to cook on Shabbat. How can this food be prohibited only to the one who cooked it as a penalty by rabbinic law, but be permitted to others (see 15a)?

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: A product of the desecration of Shabbat is an exception to the rule, as <b>the verse states</b> with regard to Shabbat: <b>“For it is sacred to you”</b> (Exodus 31:14). One may infer: <b>It,</b> Shabbat itself, <b>is sacred, but</b> the products of <b>actions</b> that desecrate <b>it are not sacred,</b> i.e., not prohibited.

### Part 3
The Gemara raises another difficulty: If <b>one plows with an ox and with a donkey</b> together, thereby violating the prohibition in Deuteronomy 22:10, <b>or</b> if <b>one muzzles the mouth of a cow and threshes with it,</b> thereby violating the prohibition in Deuteronomy 25:4, the seeds or threshed grain <b>should be prohibited</b> for consumption according to the above principle, <b>as</b> these are both practices <b>I have made abominable to you.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara responds: <b>Now</b> that it has been established that products of desecration of Shabbat are permitted, one can derive the following using an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat, which is</b> treated more <b>stringently,</b> the products of prohibited <b>actions are permitted;</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> with regard to <b>these</b> prohibitions of plowing with an ox and a donkey and threshing with a muzzled animal, which are treated less stringently, that the products of prohibited actions should be permitted?

### Part 5
The Gemara challenges: <b>Diverse kinds of seeds</b> sown together <b>should be prohibited</b> for consumption, <b>as</b> this <b>is</b> a matter whose practice <b>I have made abominable to you.</b> The Gemara explains: One learns otherwise <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One revealed with regard to diverse kinds in a vineyard:</b> “You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed; <b>lest</b> the growth of the seed that you will sow <b>be forfeited [<i>pen tikdash</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:9). The Sages read the phrase “be forfeited [<i>pen tikdash</i>]” as though it states: <b>Lest it be burned [<i>pen tukad esh</i>],</b> indicating that diverse kinds in a vineyard must be destroyed so that no benefit is derived from them. Since this is stated specifically with regard to a vineyard, one can conclude <b>by inference that</b> other <b>diverse kinds of seeds are permitted.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara objects: <b>But say</b> instead that the uniqueness of <b>diverse kinds in a vineyard</b> is that they <b>are prohibited both for consumption and for benefit,</b> whereas <b>diverse kinds of seeds are prohibited for consumption</b> but <b>are permitted for benefit.</b> The Gemara responds: One cannot say that diverse kinds of seeds are prohibited for consumption, as <b>they are juxtaposed</b> in the Torah <b>to diverse kinds of animals,</b> whose offspring are permitted. <b>As it is written: “You shall not let your cattle mate with a diverse kind; you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed”</b> (Leviticus 19:19). The juxtaposition teaches that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>your cattle,</b> the animal <b>that comes from</b> diverse species <b>is permitted, so too,</b> with regard to <b>your field, that</b> produce <b>that comes from</b> diverse seeds <b>is permitted.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>diverse kinds of animals themselves, from where do we</b> derive that their offspring is permitted? The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One prohibits</b> the offspring of <b>diverse kinds</b> of animals for sacrifice <b>to the Most High</b> upon the altar (see 38b), learn <b>by inference that they are permitted to ordinary</b> people for consumption.

### Part 8
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>A mother and its offspring</b> slaughtered on the same day <b>should be prohibited</b> for consumption, as this too is a practice made abominable. The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One prohibits</b> an animal <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, i.e., that is less than eight days old, as an offering <b>to the Most High</b> (Leviticus 22:27), learn <b>by inference that</b> such animals are <b>permitted to ordinary</b> people for consumption. The offspring of a mother slaughtered that day is also considered an animal whose time has not yet arrived, since the prohibition against slaughtering it is limited to that day.

### Part 9
The Gemara raises a final difficulty: If one violated the mitzva that mandates <b>sending</b> away the mother bird from <b>the nest,</b> as it is stated: “You shall not take the mother with the young. You shall in any way let the mother go” (Deuteronomy 22:6–7), and the court instructed him to set the mother bird free, that mother bird <b>should be prohibited</b> to all, as this practice is also abominable. The Gemara responds: <b>The Torah did not say: Send</b> it away, if doing so could lead <b>to a mishap.</b> If the bird were prohibited, the Torah would not have commanded one to send it away, as others might eat it unwittingly.

### Part 10
§ <b>Reish Lakish says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that meat</b> cooked <b>in milk is prohibited</b> for consumption? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“You shall not eat it partially roasted, nor boiled in any way”</b> (Exodus 12:9). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state:</b> “Boiled <b>in any way,”</b> since it could simply have stated: “Boiled.” <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “Boiled <b>in any way?”</b> It is included <b>to tell you</b> that <b>there is another</b> manner of <b>cooking,</b> the product of <b>which is</b> prohibited <b>like this one. And which</b> cooking <b>is this? This is meat</b> cooked <b>in milk.</b>

### Part 11
