### Part 1
<b>But</b> if it is <b>on the back</b> of the lung, <b>even</b> if it is as small <b>as a myrtle leaf,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 2
§ <b>Rafram says: This lung that is similar to a chip</b> of wood renders the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the similarity lies <b>in</b> its <b>appearance,</b> i.e., if it is pale like wood. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that it lies <b>in</b> its <b>feeling,</b> i.e., if it is hard like wood. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say that it is swollen. And there are</b> those <b>who say that it is light. And there are</b> those <b>who say that it is</b> completely <b>smooth, that it has no sectioning of lobes.</b>

### Part 3
§ <b>Rava says:</b> If the lung assumed a dark color <b>like eye shadow,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b> If its color is black <b>like ink,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. As Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> Menstrual blood that appears <b>black is</b> actually <b>red, except that it decayed.</b> Black color is therefore a sign of decay, and the lung is assumed to be defective.

### Part 4
The Gemara continues: If the lung was <b>green,</b> the animal is <b>kosher,</b> as can be derived <b>from</b> the episode <b>of Rabbi Natan.</b> And if it was <b>red,</b> it is <b>kosher,</b> as can be derived <b>from</b> the episode <b>of Rabbi Natan. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan says: Once I went to the cities overseas,</b> where <b>one woman came before me who circumcised her first son and he died,</b> and she circumcised her <b>second</b> son <b>and he died,</b> and out of concern that circumcising her <b>third</b> son might cause him to die as well, <b>she brought him before me. I saw that he was red,</b> so <b>I said to her: My daughter, wait for him until his blood is absorbed into him. She waited for him until</b> his blood was absorbed into him <b>and</b> then <b>circumcised him, and he survived. And they would call him Natan the Babylonian after my name.</b> This incident indicates that a red lung can heal.

### Part 5
Rabbi Natan further related: <b>And on another occasion I went to the state of Cappadocia,</b> and <b>a woman came before me who circumcised her first son and he died,</b> and she circumcised her <b>second</b> son <b>and he died.</b> Out of concern that circumcising her <b>third</b> son might cause him to die as well, <b>she brought him before me. I saw that he was green,</b> i.e., pale. <b>I looked at him and</b> saw that <b>he did not have the blood of circumcision in him,</b> i.e., he had a deficiency of blood such that no blood would emerge from the circumcision. <b>I said to her: My daughter, wait until his blood enters him. She waited for his</b> blood to increase <b>and</b> then <b>circumcised him, and he survived. And they would call his name Natan the Babylonian after my name.</b> This incident indicates that a green lung can heal as well.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Kahana says:</b> If the lung has an appearance <b>like the liver,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b> If it has an appearance <b>like flesh,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And your mnemonic</b> to remember that the latter is a <i>tereifa</i> is the verse: “You shall not eat any <b>flesh that is torn of animals [<i>tereifa</i>] in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30).

### Part 7
<b>Rav Sama, son of Rava, says: This lung</b> whose appearance <b>resembles dodder, or saffron, or</b> has a yellow color <b>such as</b> that of <b>an egg</b> yolk, renders the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> Since all of these appearances are various shades of green, the Gemara asks: <b>But the green</b> lung <b>that is kosher, what is it like?</b> The Gemara responds: It is <b>like a leek.</b>

### Part 8
§ <b>Ravina says:</b> If there was <b>a sealed</b> area <b>in the lung</b> that does not inflate, <b>we bring a knife and tear it open. If there is pus in</b> the sealed area, then <b>it</b> was <b>definitely</b> sealed <b>due to the pus, and</b> the animal is <b>kosher. But if</b> we do <b>not</b> find pus there, <b>we lay a feather or saliva on</b> the opening and inflate the lung. <b>If</b> the saliva <b>bubbles</b> or the feather moves, the animal is <b>kosher,</b> since some air does reach the area, <b>and if not,</b> there is some defect in the lung, and the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Yosef says: A membrane that appeared due to a wound in the lung,</b> i.e., a scab that covered a perforation through the lung, <b>is not</b> considered a true <b>membrane,</b> since it does not last. <b>And Rav Yosef says:</b> With regard to <b>this lung that emits a sound</b> when inflated, <b>if we know</b> from <b>where it emits a sound, we set a feather, or straw, or saliva on</b> that point. <b>If</b> the saliva <b>bubbles</b> when the lung is inflated, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> since this proves that the lung is perforated through both membranes. <b>And if not,</b> the animal is <b>kosher. And if we do not know</b> from where <b>it</b> emits a sound, <b>we bring a basin of tepid water and set</b> the lung <b>inside it.</b>

### Part 10
One <b>cannot</b> place it <b>in hot water, as it</b> causes the lung to <b>contract,</b> closing the perforation. And one <b>cannot</b> place it <b>in cold water, as it hardens</b> the lung and may cause it to crack. <b>Rather, we check it in tepid water. If</b> the water <b>bubbles,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And if not,</b> the animal is <b>kosher,</b> since it is apparent that only <b>the inner</b> membrane <b>is perforated</b> and <b>the outer</b> membrane <b>is not perforated, and the</b> fact <b>that it emits a sound is</b> due to <b>the air</b> moving in the space <b>between</b> the two membranes.

### Part 11
§ <b>Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> An animal with <b>a lung that</b> liquefied and can be <b>poured</b> out <b>like</b> water from <b>a jug</b> is <b>kosher.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>Evidently,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>holds</b> that <b>a deficiency on the inside</b> of an organ <b>is not considered a deficiency.</b> Only a deficiency in the wall or membrane of an organ renders an animal a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Abba raised an objection to Ulla</b> from the mishna, which states: <b>The lung that was perforated or that was missing</b> a piece renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>What</b> is the case of a lung that was <b>missing</b> a piece? <b>If we say</b> that it was missing a piece <b>on the outside, this is</b> the same as if it <b>was perforated,</b> since any missing piece of the lung wall would constitute a perforation. <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a missing piece <b>on the inside?</b> If so, <b>learn from</b> the mishna that <b>a deficiency on the inside</b> of an organ <b>is considered a deficiency</b> to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 13
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the mishna <b>actually</b> is referring to a missing piece <b>on the outside. And</b> with regard to <b>that which you said: This is</b> the same as if it <b>was perforated,</b> one may respond that <b>no,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to mention both cases to account <b>for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> in the mishna, <b>who says:</b> It is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>until</b> the lung <b>is perforated</b> through <b>to the bronchi.</b> By mentioning both cases, the mishna teaches that <b>this statement</b> of Rabbi Shimon applies only to a small <b>perforation that does not constitute a deficiency. But</b> in the case of <b>a perforation</b> so large <b>that</b> it <b>constitutes a deficiency, even Rabbi Shimon concedes</b> that it renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> even if the perforation does not reach the bronchi.

### Part 14
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥananya became sick. Rabbi Natan and all the eminent</b> scholars <b>of the generation entered before him</b> to visit. <b>They brought before him a lung that</b> could be <b>poured</b> out <b>like</b> water from <b>a jug, and he deemed</b> the animal <b>kosher.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rava said: This</b> is the <i>halakha</i> only if the <b>bronchi</b> still <b>exist</b> and only the flesh of the lung has liquefied. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: From where do we know</b> whether the bronchi still exist? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: We bring</b> a glazed <b>earthenware vessel</b> with no cracks, so the contents can be observed, <b>and we pour</b> the lung <b>into it. If there are white streaks in it,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> as the white streaks are remains of the liquefied bronchi. <b>And if not,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rav Naḥman says: If the lung</b> was partially <b>atrophied</b> and only part of the flesh remains, <b>but its membrane</b> still <b>exists,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If the lung was atrophied, but its membrane</b> still <b>exists, even</b> if the space vacated by the atrophied lung can <b>hold a quarter-</b><i>log</i> of fluid, the animal is <b>kosher.</b>
