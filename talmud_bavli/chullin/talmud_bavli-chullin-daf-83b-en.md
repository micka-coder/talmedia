### Part 1
§ <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The verse: “You shall not slaughter it and its offspring both in <b>one day”</b> (Leviticus 22:28), is referring to a special day, and it indicates that <b>a special day requires a proclamation</b> to prevent buyers from slaughtering an animal together with its offspring on that day. <b>From here</b> is derived that which is <b>stated</b> in the mishna: <b>On four occasions during the year,</b> which are special days, <b>one who sells an animal to another must inform him:</b> I sold its mother for slaughter, or: I sold its offspring for slaughter.
