### Part 1
<b>the first clutch [<i>shiḥala</i>]</b> of eggs that were in its body at the time it was rendered a <i>tereifa</i> <b>is prohibited</b> for consumption, because these eggs are considered part of the bird and were therefore rendered <i>tereifa</i> along with it. But as for any egg fertilized <b>from this</b> point <b>forward, it is</b> a case where both <b>this and that cause</b> it, i.e., a <i>tereifa</i> female and a kosher male, <b>and</b> as a rule, when permitted and prohibited causes operate together, the joint result is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Ashi raised an objection to Ameimar</b> from a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 5:1): <b>And</b> all <b>agree with regard to the egg of a <i>tereifa</i></b> bird <b>that it is prohibited</b> for consumption, <b>because it grew in</b> a state of <b>prohibition.</b> Evidently, even eggs created after the bird was rendered a <i>tereifa</i> are prohibited. Ameimar said to him: <b>There,</b> the mishna is dealing <b>with</b> a bird <b>that is heated by the earth,</b> i.e., that was not fertilized by a male, and the female <i>tereifa</i> is therefore the sole source of the egg.

### Part 3
The Gemara objects: <b>And let</b> Ameimar <b>answer</b> differently, that the mishna is dealing <b>with the first clutch</b> of eggs, which were part of the mother’s body when it became a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara responds: <b>If</b> this was <b>so,</b> why does the mishna state: Because <b>it grew</b> in a state of prohibition? The mishna <b>should have</b> stated: Because it <b>was finished</b> in a state of prohibition.

### Part 4
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> if the offspring in the womb of an animal becomes a <i>tereifa</i> along with it, then <b>that which we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> is difficult: With regard to the <b>offspring of a <i>tereifa</i>, Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>it shall not be sacrificed on the altar, and Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> that <b>it may be sacrificed. With regard to what</b> case do they <b>disagree?</b> It must be <b>with regard to</b> a case <b>where</b> the mother animal <b>was rendered a <i>tereifa</i> and afterward became pregnant</b> from a kosher male, and <b>Rabbi Eliezer holds:</b> In a case where <b>this and that cause</b> it, it is <b>prohibited, and Rabbi Yehoshua holds:</b> In a case where <b>this and that cause</b> it, it is <b>permitted.</b> But <b>if so, rather than disputing</b> whether it is permitted to sacrifice such offspring <b>to the Most High, let them disagree</b> concerning the more basic issue of whether the offspring is permitted <b>to an ordinary</b> person for consumption.

### Part 5
The Gemara responds: The dispute addresses the question of whether it is permitted to sacrifice the animal as an offering in order <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature of</b> the lenient opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua, that</b> such an animal is <b>permitted even</b> as an offering <b>to the Most High.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges: <b>But let them disagree</b> concerning whether the animal is permitted <b>to an ordinary</b> person in order <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature</b> of the stringent opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer, that</b> such an animal <b>is prohibited even to an ordinary</b> person. The Gemara responds: It is <b>preferable for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to emphasize <b>the power of leniency.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara concludes: Since Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua disagree with regard to an offspring brought about by two causes, it follows that when the mishna states: <b>And</b> they <b>concede with regard to the egg of a <i>tereifa</i></b> bird <b>that it is prohibited</b> for consumption, this is <b>referring to</b> a bird <b>that is heated by the earth</b> and was not fertilized by a male, so <b>that there is</b> only <b>one cause,</b> the <i>tereifa</i> mother bird.

### Part 8
The Gemara notes: <b>Rav Aḥa holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov,</b> who said at the end of the previous <i>amud</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> animal can be capable of giving birth, and similarly a <i>tereifa</i> bird can be capable of laying eggs as well, <b>and he</b> therefore <b>teaches</b> the statement <b>of Ameimar as we have said,</b> that any egg fertilized after the bird became a <i>tereifa</i> is permitted.

### Part 9
But <b>Ravina does not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov.</b> Rather, he holds that a <i>tereifa</i> cannot produce eggs or give birth. <b>And he</b> therefore <b>teaches</b> the statement <b>of Ameimar in this formulation: Ameimar said</b> that with regard to <b>these eggs of</b> a bird concerning which it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: <b>We leave</b> aside <b>the first clutch</b> of eggs. <b>If</b> the bird <b>produces</b> eggs <b>again,</b> the first eggs <b>are permitted</b> for consumption, because the bird is certainly not a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And if not, they are prohibited,</b> because they were considered part of the bird when it was rendered a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Ashi raised an objection to Ameimar</b> from a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 5:1): <b>And they concede with regard to the egg of a <i>tereifa</i></b> bird <b>that it is prohibited</b> for consumption, <b>because it grew in</b> a state of <b>prohibition.</b> Evidently, a <i>tereifa</i> bird can produce eggs. Ameimar <b>said to him:</b> The mishna <b>there</b> deals <b>with the first clutch</b> of eggs, which existed before the bird became a <i>tereifa</i>. Rav Ashi asks: <b>If so,</b> why does the mishna state: Because <b>it grew</b> in a state of prohibition? The mishna <b>should have</b> stated: Because it <b>was finished</b> in a state of prohibition. Ameimar responded: <b>Teach</b> an emended version of the mishna: Because it <b>was finished</b> in a state of prohibition.

### Part 11
Rav Ashi asks: <b>But</b> if a <i>tereifa</i> cannot become pregnant, <b>that which we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> is difficult: With regard to <b>the offspring of a <i>tereifa</i>, Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>it shall not be sacrificed on the altar,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> that <b>it may be sacrificed. With regard to what</b> case do they <b>disagree?</b> It must be <b>with regard to</b> a case <b>where</b> the mother animal <b>became pregnant and</b> only <b>afterward was rendered a <i>tereifa</i>. Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that <b>a fetus is</b> considered like <b>the thigh of its mother</b> and is rendered a <i>tereifa</i> as part of its body, <b>and Rabbi Yehoshua holds</b> that <b>a fetus is not</b> considered like <b>the thigh of its mother.</b> The Gemara objects: But <b>if so, rather than disputing</b> whether it is permitted to sacrifice such offspring <b>to the Most High, let them dispute</b> the more basic issue of whether the offspring is permitted <b>to an ordinary</b> person for consumption.

### Part 12
The Gemara responds: The mishna discusses the question of whether it is permitted to sacrifice the animal as an offering in order <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature</b> of the lenient opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua</b> that such an animal is permitted even as an offering to the Most High. The Gemara suggests: <b>But let them dispute</b> whether the animal is permitted <b>to an ordinary</b> person, in order <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature</b> of the stringent opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer</b> that such an animal is prohibited even to an ordinary person. The Gemara responds: It is <b>preferable for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to emphasize <b>the power of leniency.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara concludes: According to this explanation, when the mishna states: <b>And they certainly concede with regard to the egg of a <i>tereifa</i></b> bird <b>that it is prohibited</b> for consumption, it is dealing <b>with the first clutch</b> of eggs in the bird’s oviduct at the time it becomes a <i>tereifa</i>. Even Rabbi Yehoshua, who holds that the fetus of an animal is not considered like the thigh of its mother, concedes that a bird’s egg is rendered a <i>tereifa</i> along with it. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Rabbi Yehoshua holds that an egg <b>is</b> a true part of <b>its body.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara rules: <b>And</b> with regard to an animal concerning which it is uncertain whether it is a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is: <b>In</b> the case of <b>a male,</b> it is prohibited for <b>an entire twelve-month</b> period. After that point, the animal is certainly kosher. <b>In</b> the case of <b>a female, any</b> animal <b>that does not give birth</b> is prohibited. Once it has, it is certainly kosher.

### Part 15
§ <b>Rav Huna says: Any creature that has no bones cannot last twelve months. Rav Pappa said:</b> One may <b>learn from Rav Huna’s</b> statement about <b>that which Shmuel says: If a serpent melon became infested by worms while attached to the ground</b> [<b><i>be’ibbeha</i></b>], the worm <b>is prohibited</b> for consumption, in accordance with the verse: “And every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41).
