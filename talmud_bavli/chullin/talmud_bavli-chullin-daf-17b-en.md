### Part 1
The status of <b>a knife in which there are several notches is considered like</b> that of <b>a saw; and</b> with regard to a knife <b>in which there is only one notch,</b> if it <b>catches,</b> the slaughter is <b>unfit,</b> but if it <b>entangles [<i>mesukhsekhet</i>],</b> the slaughter is <b>fit. What are the circumstances</b> of a notch that <b>catches,</b> and <b>what are the circumstances</b> of a notch that <b>entangles? Rabbi Eliezer said:</b> A notch that <b>catches</b> is one that has a sharp edge <b>on two sides,</b> while a notch that <b>entangles</b> is one that has a sharp edge <b>on one side.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>What is different</b> about a notch with a sharp edge <b>on two sides, where the first edge [<i>moresha</i>] compromises</b> the neck by removing the hide and the flesh, <b>and the latter edge rips</b> the <i>simanim</i>; in the case of a notch with a sharp edge <b>on one side too, the sharp</b> tip <b>of the knife compromises</b> the neck and <b>the edge</b> of the notch <b>rips</b> the <i>simanim</i>. The Gemara explains: The reference is to a notch <b>that stands at the top of the knife,</b> which begins the slaughter. The Gemara objects: <b>Ultimately, when</b> the knife <b>goes</b> in one direction <b>it compromises</b> the neck and <b>when it comes</b> back in the other direction <b>it rips</b> the <i>simanim</i>. The Gemara explains: The reference is to a case <b>where he drew the knife backward and did not draw it forward.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rava says:</b> There are <b>three types</b> of notches <b>in a knife.</b> If the notch <b>catches, one may not slaughter</b> with it, <b>and if he slaughtered, his slaughter is not valid.</b> If the notch <b>entangles, one may not slaughter with it <i>ab initio</i>; and if he slaughtered</b> with it, <b>his slaughter is valid</b> after the fact. If the notch <b>rises and falls in</b> the <b>knife</b> and has no sharp edges, <b>one may slaughter with it <i>ab initio</i>.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Neḥemya, said to Rav Ashi: You said to us in the name of Rava</b> that if the notch <b>entangles,</b> the slaughter is <b>not valid. But doesn’t Rava say:</b> If the notch <b>entangles,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid?</b> Rav Ashi answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where Rava says that the slaughter is not valid, is in a case <b>where he drew the knife back and forth. There,</b> where Rava says that the slaughter is valid, is in a case <b>where he drew the knife backward and did not draw it forward.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi:</b> If the knife was <b>similar to an awn</b> of grain <b>[<i>sasa</i>],</b> which is not perfectly smooth but does not have actual notches, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Who will give us from the meat of</b> an animal slaughtered with that knife, <b>and we will eat</b> it.

### Part 6
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that examination of a knife</b> is an obligation <b>by Torah law?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Saul’s instructions to the people: <b>“And slaughter with this and eat”</b> (I Samuel 14:34), indicating that Saul gave them the knife only after ensuring that it was fit to slaughter their animals.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that a knife must be examined before slaughter? <b>Since were one to create a perforation</b> in the gullet, the animal would be a <b><i>tereifa</i>,</b> therefore the knife <b>requires examination</b> to prevent that situation. The Gemara answers: <b>We are saying</b> that a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one must show the knife <b>to</b> a Torah <b>scholar</b> for examination is needed. The Gemara asks: Is that an obligation by Torah law? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that the Sages <b>said to show</b> the <b>knife to</b> a Torah <b>scholar only due to</b> the requirement to show <b>deference to</b> the Torah <b>scholar?</b> The Gemara answers: Indeed, it is a requirement <b>by rabbinic law, and the verse is</b> cited as <b>a mere support</b> for that practice, not as a source.

### Part 8
The Gemara notes: <b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they examine</b> the knife <b>in the sun</b> to determine whether there is a notch. <b>In Neharde’a they examine</b> the knife <b>with water.</b> They would place the blade on the surface of the water, and if there was a notch, it would noticeably alter the surface of the water. <b>Rav Sheshet would examine it with the tip of his tongue. Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov would examine it with a strand of hair.</b> He would pass the strand over the blade of the knife and if there was a notch, it would be caught in that notch.

### Part 9
<b>In Sura they say:</b> The knife <b>consumes the flesh; let the flesh examine</b> the knife. Since the concern is that the knife will rip the flesh during the slaughter, it should be examined by passing it on the tongue or the fingertip. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The knife <b>requires examination on the flesh, and on the fingernail, and on the three sides</b> of the knife, i.e., the blade and the two sides of the knife.

### Part 10
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Rav Sama, son of Rav Mesharshiyya, said to us in your name that</b> which <b>you said to him in the name of Rava:</b> The knife <b>requires examination on the flesh, and on the fingernail, and on the three sides.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Ravina: <b>On the flesh and on the fingernail I said, and on the three sides I did not say. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rav Ashi said to him: <b>On the flesh and on the fingernail and on the three sides I said,</b> and <b>in the name of Rava I did not say.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Ravina and Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, were sitting before Rav Ashi.</b> People <b>brought a knife before Rav Ashi to examine it.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to Rav Aḥa, son of Rava: Examine it. He examined it on the fingernail, and on the flesh, and on the three sides.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Well done, and Rav Kahana likewise said</b> that this is the way to examine a knife.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Yeimar said:</b> Examination <b>on the fingernail and on the flesh is necessary,</b> and examination <b>on the three sides is not necessary. Doesn’t Rabbi Zeira say</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>one heated a knife until</b> it became <b>white hot and slaughtered</b> an animal <b>with it, his slaughter is valid, as its sharp</b> blade <b>preceded</b> the effect of <b>its white heat; and</b> it is <b>difficult for us: But aren’t there</b> the <b>sides</b> of the knife, which burn the throat and render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>And we say: The area of the slaughter</b> in the throat <b>separates</b> quickly after the incision, and the tissue on either side of the incision is not seared by the white hot blade. <b>Here too, the area of slaughter separates</b> quickly, and notches on the side of the knife do not come in contact with the <i>simanim</i>.

### Part 13
§ <b>Rav Huna bar Rav Ketina says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says</b> that <b>there are three deficiencies</b> with the same measure, as follows: <b>The deficiency of a bone in the Paschal offering,</b> with regard to which it is written: “Neither shall you break a bone therein” (Exodus 12:46); <b>the deficiency of an ear in a firstborn</b> animal that renders it blemished and unfit for sacrifice, in which case a priest may slaughter it anywhere and eat it; and <b>the deficiency</b> that constitutes <b>a blemish in</b> other forms of <b>sacrificial</b> animals.

### Part 14
<b>And Rav Ḥisda says:</b> There is <b>the deficiency of a knife as well.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>amora</i>, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, why does he not include the knife? The Gemara answers: He does not include it because <b>he is not speaking with regard to non-sacred</b> animals.

### Part 15
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish continues: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of</b> these deficiencies, <b>the measure of their deficiency</b> is <b>equivalent to</b> the measure of <b>deficiency</b> that renders <b>the altar</b> unfit.
