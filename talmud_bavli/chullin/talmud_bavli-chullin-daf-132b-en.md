### Part 1
<b>Rav Oshaya says</b> in response: In general, a priest may issue such a claim. But the mishna is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the firstborn <b>came into the possession of</b> the <b>priest</b> when it was unblemished and thereafter it developed a permanent blemish, <b>and</b> the priest <b>sold it to an Israelite in its blemished</b> state. In such a case, the priest may not demand that the owner give him the entire animal with the claim that it is a firstborn, as he already received it once as a firstborn.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches that <b>one who slaughters</b> the animal of a priest <b>for the priest or</b> the animal of a gentile <b>for the gentile is exempt from</b> the obligation to give <b>the gifts</b> of the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw. The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> simply <b>teach</b> that <b>a priest and a gentile are exempt from</b> the obligation to give <b>the gifts. Rava says</b> in explanation: <b>That is to say,</b> i.e., the wording of the mishna indicates, that <b>the demand</b> of a priest who seeks to claim gifts of the priesthood is <b>with the butcher,</b> not with the owner of the animal. Even if the butcher is himself a priest, if he slaughters an animal on behalf of an Israelite he is obligated to give the gifts.

### Part 3
The Gemara adds: <b>Rava</b> also <b>interpreted</b> the verse in such a manner. The verse states: “This shall be the priests’ due from the people, from them that perform a slaughter, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). The verse specifies that the gifts are taken <b>“from the people,” and not from the priests. When</b> the verse <b>states: “From them that perform a slaughter,”</b> indicating that the gifts are given by anyone who slaughters an animal, <b>you must say</b> that this teaches that <b>even a butcher</b> who is <b>a priest is included</b> in the obligation to give the gifts.

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches that the obligation to give the gifts of the priesthood does not apply to an animal jointly owned by an Israelite and a priest. The Gemara relates that the <b>host [<i>ushpizikhnei</i>] of Rabbi Tavla was a priest and he was hard-pressed</b> for money. <b>He came before Rabbi Tavla</b> to ask for advice. Rabbi Tavla <b>said to him: Go</b> and <b>enter into a partnership with those Israelite butchers,</b> to obtain part ownership of their animals, <b>as since they</b> will be <b>exempt from</b> the obligation to give the <b>gifts</b> on account of this partnership, they will agree to <b>enter into</b> a business <b>partnership with you</b> free of charge.

### Part 5
The priest heeded the advice of Rabbi Tavla and entered into a partnership with an Israelite butcher. Nevertheless, <b>Rav Naḥman obligated</b> the butcher to give the gifts of the priesthood from the animals he slaughtered. The priest <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>But Rabbi Tavla exempted us</b> from this obligation. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Go remove</b> the gifts of the priesthood that are in your possession and give them to a priest, <b>and if</b> you will <b>not</b> do so, <b>I will remove Rabbi Tavla from your ear [<i>me’unakh</i>],</b> i.e., I will refute his basis for deeming you exempt.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Tavla came before Rav Naḥman</b> and <b>said to him: What is the reason</b> that the <b>Master has done this</b> and ruled in contradiction to the mishna? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> I ruled in this manner, <b>as when Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina of the south came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> and all <b>the elders of the south said:</b> With regard to <b>a priest</b> who becomes <b>a butcher,</b> for the first <b>two or three weeks</b> he is <b>exempt from</b> the obligation to give <b>the gifts,</b> as he has not yet established himself in the community as a butcher. But <b>from this</b> point <b>forward</b> he is <b>obligated to</b> give the <b>gifts,</b> as he is now known as a butcher.

### Part 7
Rabbi Tavla <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>And let the Master at least do for</b> the priest <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina</b> and exempt him from giving the gifts for the first three weeks of his partnership. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: This statement</b> of Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina applies only when the priest <b>did not</b> immediately <b>establish a butcher shop.</b> In such a case, the priest is exempt until he becomes known as a recognized butcher. <b>But here, he has</b> already <b>established a butcher shop</b> and is therefore obligated to give the gifts without delay.

### Part 8
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> With regard to <b>a priest who</b> slaughters an animal and <b>does not separate gifts</b> of the priesthood from them for another priest, <b>let him be</b> under the <b>excommunication of the God of Israel. Rabba bar Rav Sheila said: These butchers of</b> the city of <b>Huzal</b> have <b>remained</b> under the <b>excommunication of Rav Ḥisda these</b> last <b>twenty-two years,</b> as they have continuously refused to separate gifts of the priesthood for this period.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> did Rabba bar Rav Sheila state that the butchers of Huzal have been under excommunication for twenty-two years? <b>If we say that we do not excommunicate them</b> for a period <b>any longer</b> than twenty-two years, <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that one is not excommunicated for committing a transgression, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to a prohibition,</b> for which one is liable to receive a relatively severe punishment, e.g., death or <i>karet</i>. <b>But with regard to</b> one who refuses to perform <b>a positive mitzva, e.g.,</b> the court <b>says to him: Perform</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>, and he does not do</b> so, or: Perform the mitzva of taking the <b><i>lulav</i>, and he does not do</b> so, or: <b>Prepare ritual fringes</b> for your garments, <b>and he does not do</b> so, the court <b>strikes him</b> an unlimited number of times, even <b>until his soul departs.</b> Accordingly, the butchers of Huzal should remain under excommunication indefinitely until they separate the gifts.

### Part 10
<b>Rather,</b> Rabba bar Rav Sheila means <b>that</b> because the butchers of Huzal have refused to give the gifts for so many years, <b>we fine them</b> even <b>without forewarning.</b> There was a case <b>like this</b> of a person who refused to give the gifts of the priesthood to a priest, <b>where Rava fined</b> him by taking the entire <b>thigh</b> of his animal and giving it to a priest. Similarly, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak fined</b> an individual who refused to give the gifts of the priesthood to a priest by taking his <b>cloak</b> and giving it to a priest.

### Part 11
§ <b>And Rav Ḥisda</b> also <b>says</b> with regard to gifts of the priesthood: The <b>foreleg</b> is given <b>to one</b> priest <b>and</b> the <b>maw</b> is given <b>to one</b> priest, while the <b>jaw</b> is given <b>to two</b> priests. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But when Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef came</b> to Babylonia from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said: In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>we divide</b> the gifts <b>bone by bone,</b> each of which is given to two priests.

### Part 12
The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> in the case dealt with in Eretz Yisrael, the gifts were <b>of a</b> large <b>bull.</b> The Torah states: “That they shall give to the priest” (Deuteronomy 18:3). The use of the term “give” indicates that the gift given should be a substantial one. Even when one limb of the large bull was divided between two priests, each received a substantial portion. This is not the case with regard to the gifts of smaller animals, where each limb is not large enough to provide two substantial portions.

### Part 13
§ <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>prohibited to partake of</b> a slaughtered <b>animal whose gifts have not</b> yet <b>been separated.</b> Furthermore, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who partakes of an animal whose gifts have not</b> yet <b>been separated</b> is considered <b>as though he consumes untithed produce. But</b> the Gemara states: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Ḥisda says: Gifts of the priesthood may be consumed only</b> when they are <b>roasted, and they may be consumed only with mustard</b> seasoning. <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? The <b>verse states:</b> “And the Lord spoke to Aaron: And I, behold, I have given you the charge of My gifts; of all the consecrated items of the children of Israel to you have I given them for prominence, and to your sons, as an eternal portion” (Numbers 18:8). The term <b>“for prominence”</b> means that the portions were given to the priests as a mark <b>of greatness.</b> Accordingly, they should be eaten <b>in a manner that kings eat,</b> i.e., roasted and with mustard.

### Part 15
<b>And Rav Ḥisda says: One may not give a gift to any priest who is not an expert in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to all <b>twenty-four gifts of the priesthood.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>But</b> this <b>is not correct, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Any priest who does not believe in</b> the validity of the Temple <b>service has no portion in</b> any of the gifts given to the <b>priesthood, as it is stated: “He among the sons of Aaron, who offers [<i>hamakriv</i>] the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion”</b> (Leviticus 7:33). The word “<i>hamakriv</i>,” which literally means: Who brings it close, indicates that only one who believes in the validity of conveying the blood to the altar is entitled to receive the right thigh of the offering, as only one who believes in the rite would perform it.

### Part 16
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a priest does not have a share in the priestly gifts if he does not believe in <b>this</b> rite of conveying of the blood <b>alone. From where</b> do I derive <b>to include fifteen</b> additional sacrificial <b>rites, such as</b> the rites of a meal offering, i.e., <b>the pouring</b> of the oil <b>and the mixing</b> of the oil and the subsequent pouring of the oil; <b>and the crumbling</b> of meal offerings prepared in a shallow or deep pan or in an oven, whose handfuls are removed after they are baked and subsequently crumbled; <b>and the salting</b> of meal offerings (see Leviticus 2:13); and the <b>waving</b> of certain meal offerings; <b>and the bringing</b> of certain meal offerings to the southwestern corner of the altar before a handful is removed; <b>and the removal of the handful;</b> and <b>the burning</b> of offerings on the altar; <b>and the squeezing</b> of a bird offering to extract its blood; <b>and the pinching</b> of the nape of the neck of a bird offering;
