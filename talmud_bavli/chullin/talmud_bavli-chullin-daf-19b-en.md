### Part 1
<b>as, if</b> you retract your statement, <b>you repudiate the first</b> ruling that you stated with regard to a case where one diverted the knife and cut one-third of the windpipe, and then cut one-third properly, and then diverted and cut the final one-third. <b>There, what is the reason</b> that <b>you deemed</b> the slaughter <b>valid?</b> The reason is <b>that when life left</b> the animal with the cutting of the second third of the windpipe, <b>it left</b> the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>valid</b> slaughter. Based on that reasoning, <b>here too, when life left</b> the animal with the cutting of the second third of the windpipe, <b>it left</b> the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>diverting</b> the knife, and the slaughter is invalid.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Naḥman happened</b> to come <b>to Sura,</b> where <b>they asked him:</b> If <b>one cut one-third</b> of the windpipe properly, <b>and</b> then <b>diverted</b> the knife and cut <b>one-third, and</b> then <b>cut</b> the final <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe properly, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>He said to them: Isn’t that</b> the <i>halakha</i> stated by <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Minyumi, as Rabbi Elazar bar Minyumi says: Slaughter that is performed like</b> the teeth of <b>a comb,</b> which are jagged, is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara objects: <b>And perhaps</b> Rabbi Elazar bar Minyumi stated his <i>halakha</i> only when the slaughter goes up and down <b>within</b> the proper <b>place of slaughter.</b> The Gemara asks in response: <b>Within</b> the proper <b>place of slaughter, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> it? Clearly the slaughter is valid in that case. The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>we require slaughter</b> that is <b>clear</b> and straight, <b>and</b> slaughter that is jagged <b>is not</b> straight, therefore, Rabbi Elazar bar Minyumi <b>teaches us</b> that nevertheless, the slaughter is valid.

### Part 4
The Gemara cites <b>a mnemonic</b> for the order of the Sages in the following discussion: <b><i>Beit</i></b> for Rabbi Abba; <b><i>kaf</i></b> for Rav Kahana; <b><i>dalet</i></b> for Rav Yehuda.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Abba sat behind Rav Kahana and Rav Kahana sat before Rav Yehuda, and he sat and said</b> to Rav Yehuda: If <b>one cut one-third</b> of the windpipe properly, <b>and</b> then <b>diverted</b> the knife and cut <b>one-third, and</b> then <b>cut</b> the final <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe properly, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>His slaughter is valid.</b>

### Part 6
Rav Kahana then asked: If <b>one diverted</b> the knife and cut <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe, <b>and</b> then <b>cut one-third</b> properly, <b>and</b> then <b>diverted</b> and cut the final <b>one-third, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> him: <b>His slaughter is not valid.</b>

### Part 7
Rav Kahana then asked: If <b>one cut in a place</b> where there was <b>a perforation</b> in the front of the windpipe and continued cutting, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> him: <b>His slaughter is valid.</b>

### Part 8
Rav Kahana further asked: If <b>one cut</b> the windpipe <b>and</b> after cutting half the windpipe <b>encountered a perforation,</b> after which point a majority of the windpipe had been cut, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> him: <b>His slaughter is not valid.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Abba went</b> to Eretz Yisrael and <b>stated</b> these <i>halakhot</i> <b>in the presence of Rabbi Elazar,</b> and <b>Rabbi Elazar went</b> and <b>stated</b> these <i>halakhot</i> <b>in the presence of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: What is different</b> about a case where one cut in a place where there was a perforation relative to a case where he encountered a perforation in the middle of the slaughter?

### Part 10
Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him:</b> In a case where <b>one cut in a place</b> where there was <b>a perforation, it becomes like</b> an animal <b>that a gentile</b> began to <b>slaughter and a Jew completed</b> its slaughter, in which case the slaughter is valid. In a case where <b>one cut</b> the windpipe <b>and encountered a perforation, it becomes like</b> an animal <b>that a Jew</b> began to <b>slaughter and a gentile completed</b> its slaughter, in which case the slaughter is not valid. Rabbi Yoḥanan mockingly <b>proclaimed about him: Gentile, gentile,</b> i.e., you merely repeat something about gentiles. Rabbi Yoḥanan did not accept the distinction.

### Part 11
<b>Rava said:</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan did <b>well</b> when he <b>proclaimed about him: Gentile, gentile. Granted, there,</b> in the case where the gentile completed the slaughter, <b>since a Jew was</b> supposed <b>to cut a majority</b> of the windpipe <b>and he did not cut</b> it, <b>when life left</b> the animal <b>it left by the hand of a gentile. But here, after all, he</b> was the one who <b>slaughtered</b> the entire animal, and the animal was not a <i>tereifa</i> until this point, and so <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if one began to cut <b>in a place</b> where there was <b>a perforation</b> and <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if he <b>encountered a perforation?</b>

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who slaughters from the sides</b> of the throat, <b>his slaughter is valid. One who pinches</b> the neck of a bird offering <b>from the sides, his pinching is not valid.One who slaughters from the nape [<i>oref</i>]</b> of the neck, <b>his slaughter is not valid. One who pinches</b> a bird offering <b>from the nape</b> of the neck, <b>his pinching is valid. One who slaughters from the throat, his slaughter is valid. One who pinches</b> a bird offering <b>from the throat, his pinching is not valid, as the entire nape is valid for pinching and the entire throat is valid for slaughter. It is found that</b> that which is <b>valid for slaughter</b> is <b>not valid for pinching</b> and that which is <b>valid for pinching</b> is <b>not valid for slaughter.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the statement in the mishna: One who slaughters an animal from the <i>oref</i>, its slaughter is not valid, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>oref</i>? If we say</b> that the reference is to the <b>actual occipital bone</b> at the rear of the skull, <b>why</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply <b>specifically</b> to one who <b>slaughters</b> from the <i>oref</i>? <b>Even</b> if one <b>pinches</b> a bird offering from the <i>oref</i> it would <b>also</b> not be valid, as <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “Pinch off its head <b>adjacent to its <i>oref</i>”</b> (Leviticus 5:8), at the nape beneath the occipital bone, <b>and not its <i>oref</i>. Rather, what</b> is the <b><i>oref</i></b> mentioned in the mishna? It is <b>adjacent to the <i>oref</i>,</b> the back of the neck below the occipital bone, <b>as it is taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>The entire nape is valid for pinching.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? They are derived <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the phrase <b>“adjacent to [<i>mimmul</i>] its <i>oref</i>,” adjacent</b> means a place <b>that sees the <i>oref</i></b>  and not the <i>oref</i> itself. <b>And likewise,</b> the verse <b>states: “And they reside adjacent to me [<i>mimmuli</i>]”</b> (Numbers 22:5); <b>and</b> the verse <b>states: “For they have turned their <i>oref</i> unto Me, and not their face”</b> (Jeremiah 2:27). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is added by the latter proof, introduced with the term: <b>And</b> the verse <b>states?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>And if you would say, we do not know where the <i>oref</i> itself</b> is, so <b>that we will know where adjacent to it is, come</b> and <b>hear: “For they have turned their <i>oref</i> unto Me, and not their face,”</b> from which it may be ascertained <b>by inference that the <i>oref</i> is opposite the face,</b> at the rear of the head.

### Part 15
§ <b>The sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya say:</b> How is <b>the mitzva of pinching</b> of a bird offering performed? <b>One moves</b> the two <b><i>simanim</i></b> that must be severed in ritual slaughter, i.e., the windpipe and the gullet, <b>behind the nape and pinches.</b> There is a dispute among the Sages with regard to the meaning of the statement. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say:</b> The mitzva <i>ab initio</i> is to pinch through the spinal column first and then pinch the windpipe and the gullet, and one may <b>even move</b> the <i>simanim</i> to behind the nape and pinch. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say:</b> The mitzva is <b>specifically</b> to <b>move</b> the <i>simanim</i> behind the nape and pinch.

### Part 16
The Gemara notes: <b>And it is reasonable according to the one who says: One may even move</b> the <i>simanim</i> behind the nape. <b>From where</b> does one draw that conclusion? It is <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches: One who slaughters from the nape</b> of the neck, <b>his slaughter is not valid. One who pinches from the nape</b> of the neck, <b>his pinching is valid.</b>
