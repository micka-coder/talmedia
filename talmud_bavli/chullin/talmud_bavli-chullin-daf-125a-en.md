<b>and the thigh bone of a sacrificial</b> animal that was rendered unfit as <i>piggul</i>, i.e., an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its designated time, or <i>notar</i>, i.e., part of an offering left over after the time allotted for its consumption, <b>whether</b> these thigh bones were <b>sealed</b> and there was no access to the marrow, or <b>whether</b> they were <b>perforated</b> and there was access to the marrow, <b>one who touches them is ritually impure.</b> The reason is that a piece of bone of a corpse the size of a barley grain imparts impurity, and the bone of a sacrificial animal that was disqualified in this manner imparts impurity by rabbinic decree via contact.

### Part 2
With regard to <b>the thigh bone of an unslaughtered carcass and the thigh bone of a creeping animal, one who touches them</b> when they are <b>sealed</b> remains <b>ritually pure.</b> If one of these thigh bones was <b>perforated at all, it imparts impurity via contact,</b> as in that case contact with the bone is tantamount to contact with the marrow. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that even with regard to</b> impurity transmitted via <b>carrying</b> there is a distinction between sealed and perforated thigh bones? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “One who touches</b> the carcass thereof shall be impure until the evening; <b>and one who carries</b> the carcass thereof shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39–40), indicating: <b>That which enters the category of</b> impurity via <b>contact, enters the category of</b> impurity via <b>carrying; that which does not enter the category of</b> impurity via <b>contact, does not enter the category of</b> impurity via <b>carrying.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who touches the thigh bone of a human corpse is ritually impure, whether or not it was sealed. The Gemara infers that with regard to one who <b>touches</b> the bone, <b>yes,</b> he is impure, <b>but</b> one who <b>overlies</b> the thigh bone is <b>not</b> impure, as it does not transmit impurity to that which is above it or under the same roof.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If there is an olive-bulk of flesh</b> attached to the bone then <b>it should transmit impurity in a tent,</b> i.e., to that which is under the same roof, <b>as well.</b> The Gemara answers: The mishna is discussing a case <b>where there is not an olive-bulk of flesh</b> attached to the bone.

### Part 5
The Gemara objects: <b>But if there is an olive-bulk of marrow inside</b> the bone, <b>the impurity breaks through</b> the bone, so to speak, <b>and ascends</b> beyond it. Therefore, <b>it should transmit impurity in a tent as well.</b> The Gemara explains: The mishna is discussing a case <b>where there is not an olive-bulk of marrow inside</b> the bone.

### Part 6
The Gemara objects: <b>But if</b> the mishna maintains that <b>marrow inside</b> the bone of a living person <b>heals</b> the flesh <b>outside</b> the bone, then since the marrow could replenish itself and catalyze the growth of flesh on the bone <b>it is a proper limb.</b> Therefore, as is the case with any piece of a proper limb, even one less than the size of an olive-bulk, <b>it should transmit impurity in a tent as well. Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: That is to say</b> that the mishna maintains that <b>marrow inside</b> the bone <b>does not heal</b> the flesh <b>outside</b> the bone.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>To what</b> case <b>did you interpret</b> the mishna to be referring? It is a case <b>where there is not an olive-bulk</b> of marrow. <b>If so, in</b> the case of <b>a sacrificial animal, why does</b> the thigh bone <b>impart impurity?</b> The Sages issued a decree that the bones of a sacrificial animal that are attached to flesh or contain marrow that became <i>piggul</i> or <i>notar</i> render those who touch them impure, as they serve as handles or protection for the flesh or marrow. By contrast, in this case there can be no <i>piggul</i> or <i>notar</i> because there is less than an olive-bulk of flesh or marrow.

### Part 8
<b>And furthermore,</b> if the mishna is discussing a case where there is not an olive-bulk of marrow, <b>why do the thigh bone of an unslaughtered carcass and the thigh bone of a creeping animal impart impurity</b> in a case <b>when they were perforated?</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> is <b>not difficult. The first clause</b> of the mishna, which discusses the thigh bone of a corpse, is referring to a case <b>where there is not an olive-bulk</b> of marrow. <b>The latter clause</b> of the mishna, which discusses the thigh bones of a sacrificial animal, an unslaughtered carcass, and a creeping animal, is referring to a case <b>where there is an olive-bulk</b> of marrow. <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>what is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaching us? He is teaching us several</b> distinct <b>matters</b> separately, as follows.

### Part 10
In <b>the first clause he is teaching us that the marrow inside</b> the bone <b>does not heal</b> the flesh <b>outside</b> the bone. With regard to the thigh bone of <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>what is he teaching us?</b> He is teaching us that a bone that <b>serves</b> as a handle or protection for flesh or marrow that became <b><i>notar</i> is significant</b> and imparts impurity, <b>as Mari bar Avuh said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Bones of sacrificial</b> animals <b>that served</b> as a handle for <b><i>notar</i>,</b> meaning that they have leftover meat on them or inside them after the allotted time for its consumption, <b>transmit impurity to the hands</b> of those who handle them, just as the leftover sacrificial meat itself transmits impurity to the hands. <b>Since</b> the bones <b>have become a base for</b> an intrinsically <b>forbidden object,</b> they are treated in the same manner as the forbidden object itself.

### Part 11
Next, the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna teaches that with regard to the thigh bone of <b>an unslaughtered carcass, even if there is an olive-bulk</b> of marrow inside, if it <b>was perforated</b> it <b>does</b> impart impurity, but if it <b>was not perforated,</b> it does <b>not</b> impart impurity.

### Part 12
<b>Abaye said: Actually,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna maintains that <b>marrow inside</b> the bone <b>heals</b> the flesh <b>outside</b> the bone. <b>And</b> with regard to the consequent assertion: If so, the thigh bone should impart impurity in a tent as well, the explanation is that <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where one scraped</b> the bone. Therefore, the flesh and the marrow can no longer heal, and the bone is not considered a proper limb that imparts impurity in a tent.

### Part 13
<b>And</b> this mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar said: A thigh bone that one scraped lengthwise is impure</b> like a limb. Even if it is not attached to flesh or marrow, a bone scraped in such a manner still has the ability to heal. But if one scraped it <b>widthwise</b> it will not heal and is therefore <b>pure. And your mnemonic</b> to remember which can heal and which cannot is <b>a palm tree,</b> because if one sawed a strip off of a palm tree lengthwise it can heal, but if one did so widthwise, i.e., one sawed a strip off of the circumference of the tree, the flow of sap is disrupted and the tree cannot heal.

### Part 14
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Actually,</b> the mishna is discussing a case <b>where there is an olive-bulk</b> of marrow in the bone. <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna also holds that <b>marrow inside</b> the bone <b>heals</b> the flesh <b>outside</b> the bone. And as for the consequent assertion: If so, the bone should transmit impurity in a tent, in fact the bone does impart impurity in a tent. <b>And</b> to <b>what</b> is the mishna referring <b>when it teaches</b> that one who <b>touches</b> the bone is ritually impure? It is also referring to one who <b>overlies</b> the bone.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>But if the marrow inside</b> the bone <b>heals</b> the flesh <b>outside</b> the bone, <b>why</b> does the mishna teach that <b>the thigh bone of a carcass and the thigh bone of a creeping animal are pure when they were not perforated?</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Giddel said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where there is an olive-bulk of marrow that</b> has become detached and <b>is rattling</b> inside the bone. <b>With regard to</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse, the impurity breaks through</b> the bone <b>and ascends,</b> and it therefore transmits impurity in a tent. But with regard to the impurity of <b>a carcass, since</b> the marrow <b>is</b> loose and <b>rattling,</b> it will not heal. Therefore, if the bone <b>was perforated</b> and it is possible to touch the marrow, the bone <b>does</b> impart impurity. But if the bone <b>was not perforated</b> it does <b>not</b> impart impurity.

### Part 17
According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, overlying is referred to as touching in the mishna. <b>Rabbi Avin said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin</b> who said: <b>We learn</b> in a mishna <b>as well</b> (<i>Oholot</i> 3:1): In the case of <b>one who touches</b> with one hand <b>half an olive-bulk</b> of a corpse <b>and</b> simultaneously his other hand <b>overlies half an olive-bulk or half an olive-bulk</b> of flesh from a corpse <b>overlies him, he is impure.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Granted, if you say</b> that impurity via contact and impurity transmitted in a tent or to one overlying a part of the corpse are <b>one concept,</b> it <b>is due to that</b> reason that the half olive-bulk of impurity that he touched and the half olive-bulk of impurity that he overlaid <b>join together</b> to constitute the requisite measure of an olive-bulk.

### Part 19
<b>But if you say</b> that <b>they are two concepts,</b> how <b>can they join together? But didn’t we learn</b> in that mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:1): <b>This is the principle: Any</b> impure items lacking the requisite volume to have impure status on their own <b>that are of one concept join together and are impure;</b> if they are <b>of two concepts,</b> they do not join together and remain <b>pure?</b>Apparently, touching and overlying a corpse create the same type of impurity, and therefore overlying is referred to as touching in the mishna here.

### Part 20
The Gemara challenges: <b>Rather, what</b> is the alternative? <b>Is it one concept</b> that comprises both touching and overlying? <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna in tractate <i>Oholot</i>: <b>But</b>
