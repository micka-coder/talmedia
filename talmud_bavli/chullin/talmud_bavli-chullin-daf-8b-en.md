### Part 1
The Gemara rejects that possibility: Rav Naḥman is referring <b>to</b> the case of <b>a new</b> knife on which there is no residue.

### Part 2
The Gemara challenges: If it is <b>a new</b> knife, <b>both</b> according <b>to Rabbi Yishmael and</b> according <b>to Rabbi Akiva,</b> who disagreed about whether an idol is forbidden from the moment that one crafts it or from the moment that one worships it, a knife is merely in the category of <b>accessories of idol worship, and accessories of idol worship are forbidden only after they are</b> used for idol <b>worship.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the reference is to a case <b>where he cut a branch [<i>gevaza</i>] for idol worship with</b> the knife, which leaves no residue. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that Rav Naḥman is referring <b>to</b> the case of <b>an old</b> knife <b>that he burned until</b> it became <b>white hot in the fire,</b> and therefore, there is no residue on the knife.

### Part 3
§ <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>with the knife of gentiles, Rav says: He peels</b> off a layer of the flesh from the place on the animal where the knife touched the flesh and the forbidden residue on the knife was absorbed. <b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana says: He rinses</b> the place where the knife touched the flesh. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>they disagree about this, that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana, <b>holds: The area of the slaughter</b> on the throat <b>is cold</b> and does not absorb the forbidden residue, and therefore rinsing is sufficient. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds: The area of the slaughter</b> on the throat <b>is hot</b> and therefore it absorbs the forbidden residue.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects that suggestion: <b>No,</b> it is possible <b>that everyone</b> holds that <b>the area of the slaughter</b> on the throat <b>is hot.</b> For <b>the one who says</b> that <b>he peels</b> off a layer, it works out <b>well, and the one who says</b> that <b>he rinses</b> the place where the knife touched the flesh holds that <b>since the two organs that must be severed in ritual slaughter [<i>simanim</i>],</b> i.e., the windpipe and the gullet, <b>are occupied</b> with <b>discharging blood, they do not absorb</b> the residue.

### Part 5
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say that everyone</b> holds that <b>the area of the slaughter</b> on the throat <b>is cold.</b> For <b>the one who says</b> that <b>he rinses</b> the place where the knife touched the flesh, it works out <b>well, and the one who says</b> that <b>he peels</b> off a layer holds that although that area is cold, <b>due to the pressure of the knife</b> on the throat, the flesh <b>absorbs</b> the residue.

### Part 6
§ <b>With regard to a knife</b> with which an animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> was slaughtered, <b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree. One says:</b> One purges it <b>in hot</b> water to remove the absorptions from the <i>tereifa</i>, <b>and one says:</b> One rinses it <b>in cold</b> water, and that is sufficient. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: One may rinse it <b>even in cold</b> water. <b>And if there is a tattered</b> piece <b>of a curtain</b> with which <b>to wipe</b> the knife, <b>one need not</b> rinse it.

### Part 7
<b>And according to the one who says</b> that one purges it <b>in hot</b> water, <b>what is the reason</b> that he must do so; is it <b>due to</b> the premise <b>that</b> the knife <b>absorbed forbidden</b> residue? That reasoning should not be limited to a case where he slaughtered a <i>tereifa</i>. A knife with <b>which</b> he slaughtered an animal that is <b>permitted</b> should <b>also</b> require purging, because <b>it absorbed</b> residue from <b>the limb from a living</b> animal before the slaughter was completed. The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> is there concern that the knife <b>absorbed</b> the residue? It is <b>when</b> the throat <b>grows warm. When does it grow warm?</b> It is <b>at</b> the point <b>when the slaughter is complete.</b> At <b>that moment, it is</b> already <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 8
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: The slaughterer requires three knives, one with which he slaughters</b> the animal, <b>and one with which he cuts meat, and one with which he cuts</b> forbidden <b>fats.</b> One may not use the same knife for cutting the meat and the forbidden fats due to the residue on the knife after cutting the forbidden fats.

### Part 9
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let him designate one</b> knife for cutting both the meat and forbidden fats <b>and cut meat with it and then cut</b> forbidden <b>fats with it.</b> In this manner the forbidden residue on the knife will not affect the meat. The Gemara explains: The Sages issued a rabbinic <b>decree</b> prohibiting the use of one knife to cut meat and then forbidden fats <b>lest he</b> also <b>cut</b> forbidden <b>fats and cut meat thereafter.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>Now too,</b> after the decree mandating separate knives there is a concern that <b>they will be confused for him</b> and he will use the knife that cut the forbidden fats to cut the meat. The Gemara explains: <b>Since</b> the Sages <b>required him</b> to have <b>two</b> knives, <b>he has a conspicuous marker</b> on one of the knives that will prevent confusion.

### Part 10
<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: The slaughterer requires two vessels of water, one with which he rinses meat and one with which he rinses</b> forbidden <b>fats.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>And let him designate one</b> vessel <b>and rinse meat with</b> the water in the vessel <b>and then rinse</b> forbidden <b>fats with</b> the water in the same vessel. The Gemara explains: The Sages issued a rabbinic <b>decree</b> to prohibit doing so <b>lest he rinse</b> fats <b>and rinse meat thereafter.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>Now too,</b> after the decree mandating separate vessels there is a concern that <b>they will be confused for him</b> and he will rinse meat in the vessel in which he rinsed fats. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the Sages <b>required him</b> to have <b>two</b> vessels, <b>he has a conspicuous marker</b> on one of the vessels that will prevent confusion.

### Part 11
§ <b>Ameimar says in the name of Rav Pappa: A person should not place [<i>lisḥof</i>] the flanks</b> of an animal <b>atop</b> other <b>meat</b> so that the forbidden fats that are attached to the flanks are in contact with the other meat, due to the fact <b>that the</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> liquefies and <b>flows and the meat absorbs</b> it.

### Part 12
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>If so,</b> and that is a concern, <b>when</b> the flanks are <b>placed</b> in their <b>typical</b> manner <b>[<i>teritzi</i>] as well,</b> with the forbidden fat above the meat of the flanks, <b>the</b> forbidden <b>fat flows and the meat</b> of the flanks <b>absorbs</b> it. The Gemara explains: <b>The membrane</b> between the forbidden fat and the meat of the flanks <b>interposes from below</b> and prevents absorption of the forbidden fat. The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b>
