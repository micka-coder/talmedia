### Part 1
In the case of a blade that was <b>detached and ultimately one attached it, with regard to slaughter, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 2
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If there <b>was a flint emerging from a wall or a reed arising</b> from the ground <b>on its own and he slaughtered with it, his slaughter is not valid.</b> Since the wall itself was made from stones that were detached and subsequently reattached, the slaughter is not valid.

### Part 3
The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>What are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing <b>with</b> the case of <b>the wall of a cave</b> that was always attached. The language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise</b> in support of that explanation, <b>as</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the case of the flint emerging from a wall juxtaposed to, and therefore <b>similar to,</b> the case of <b>a reed arising</b> from the ground <b>on its own,</b> which was also always attached. The Gemara affirms: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that this is the case.

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one embedded a knife in a wall and slaughtered with it, his slaughter is valid.</b> The knife was detached and then reattached, and the slaughter is valid. The Gemara rejects the proof: The reason that the slaughter is valid is that <b>a knife is different, as he does not subsume it</b> to the wall.

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from an earlier point in that <i>baraita</i>: If one slaughtered <b>with</b> an item that is <b>attached to the ground, his slaughter is valid.</b> This is a case where it was detached and then attached, as later in the <i>baraita</i> a case is cited when the blade was always attached and the slaughter is not valid. The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>Perhaps</b> the phrase that follows in the <i>baraita</i>: If one embedded a knife in a wall, <b>is explaining</b> the previous case. And accordingly, <b>what</b> is the meaning of <b>attached to the ground?</b> It is in the case of <b>a knife, as he does not subsume it</b> to the wall. But if he embedded a flint in a wall and slaughtered with it, his slaughter would be valid. Therefore, there is no proof from this <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 6
§ <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one embedded a knife in a wall and slaughtered with it, his slaughter is valid. Rav Anan says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case where <b>the knife is above and</b> the <b>animal’s neck is below,</b> and he raises the animal’s head and draws it back and forth on the blade. But in a case where the <b>knife is below and</b> the <b>animal’s neck is above,</b> the slaughter is not valid because <b>we are concerned lest he press</b> the knife, due to the weight of the animal, thereby cutting the <i>simanim</i> without drawing the knife back and forth, which invalidates the slaughter.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> explicitly in the <i>baraita</i>: With any item that cuts, one may slaughter, whether with a blade that is attached to the ground or with a blade that is detached from the ground; <b>whether the knife is below and</b> the <b>neck of the animal is above or the knife is above and</b> the <b>neck of the animal is below?</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Zevid said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught disjunctively:</b> In the case where the <b>knife is below and</b> the <b>neck of the animal is above,</b> the slaughter is valid <b>when</b> the blade is <b>detached.</b> In the case where the <b>knife is above and</b> the <b>neck of the animal is below,</b> the slaughter is valid even <b>when</b> the blade is <b>attached. Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> that teaches that one may slaughter even when the attached knife is below is referring <b>to</b> slaughter of <b>a bird, which is light,</b> and there is no concern that the weight of the bird will cause the slaughterer to press the bird’s neck onto the knife.

### Part 9
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: Five matters were said with regard to the stalk of a reed,</b> which is used for cutting due to its sharpness. <b>One may neither slaughter with it,</b> due to the concern that splinters will be separated and become embedded in the <i>simanim</i>, invalidating the slaughter; <b>nor circumcise with it</b> for the same reason, due to the potential danger; <b>nor cut meat with it,</b> lest splinters become embedded in the meat and endanger one who eats it; <b>nor pick</b> one’s <b>teeth with it,</b> lest he wound himself; <b>nor wipe with it</b> after relieving oneself.

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: One may neither slaughter with it. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>With any</b> sharp object <b>one may slaughter</b> an animal, <b>whether with a flint, or with glass</b> shards, <b>or with the stalk of a reed? Rav Pappa said:</b> There, the reference is <b>to</b> a specific type of <b>reed</b> that grows <b>in a marsh,</b> which becomes a smooth, hard surface when it dries.

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>Nor cut meat with it. Rav Pappa cuts with</b> the stalk of a reed <b>the innards of fish, which are transparent,</b> such that any splinters would be obvious. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna cuts with it</b> the meat of <b>a bird, which is soft</b> and will not cause the stalk of the reed to splinter.

### Part 12
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>Nor wipe with it</b> after relieving oneself. The Gemara objects: <b>Derive</b> that one may not wipe with it <b>because the Master said: One who wipes with an object that is flammable, his</b> lower <b>teeth,</b> i.e., the rectum that holds the intestines in place, <b>fall out. Rav Pappa said</b> in explanation: The reference in the <i>baraita</i> is not to wiping after relieving oneself. Rather, <b>we are speaking</b> with regard to <b>wiping</b> the blood or dirt from <b>the opening of a wound.</b>

### Part 13
§ The mishna teaches: <b>All slaughter [<i>hakkol shoḥatin</i>] and one may always slaughter.</b> The Gemara interprets the phrase: <b>All slaughter [<i>hakkol shoḥatin</i>],</b> to mean <b>all</b> animals are included in the mitzva <b>of slaughter, and even a bird.</b>

### Part 14
With regard to the statement: <b>One may always slaughter, who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabba said:</b> It <b>is Rabbi Yishmael, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“When the Lord your God shall expand your border, as He has promised you, and you shall say: I will eat flesh…</b>you may eat flesh with all the desire of your soul” (Deuteronomy 12:20), <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: The verse comes only to permit</b> consumption of the non-sacrificial <b>meat of desire to</b> the Jewish people.

### Part 15
<b>As, at the outset,</b> the <b>meat of desire was forbidden to them,</b> and anyone who wanted to eat meat would sacrifice the animal as an offering. After the priest sprinkled the blood, it was permitted for one to eat the meat. <b>When they entered into Eretz</b> Yisrael, the <b>meat of desire was permitted for them,</b> and they could slaughter and eat meat wherever they chose.

### Part 16
Rabba added: <b>And now that</b> the Jewish people <b>were exiled, might</b> one have thought that <b>they return to their initial prohibition? Therefore, we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One may always slaughter</b> non-sacrificial meat.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Yosef objects to this.</b> If so, <b>this</b> phrase: <b>One may always slaughter,</b> is inappropriate; the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> taught: <b>One may always slaughter and eat,</b> as the matter of permission primarily relates to eating the meat, not to slaughtering the animal. <b>And furthermore, initially, what is the reason</b> that the meat of desire <b>was forbidden?</b> It was <b>because</b> in the wilderness, <b>they were proximate to the Tabernacle</b> and could partake of sacrificial meat from the table of God. <b>And ultimately, what is the reason</b> that the meat of desire <b>was permitted?</b> The reason was <b>that</b> in Eretz Yisrael <b>they were distant from the Tabernacle.</b>
