### Part 1
<b>disqualify</b> the <b>water of purification,</b> i.e., water in which ashes of the red heifer have been placed, by drinking from it. The water that entered the bird’s mouth is disqualified, and some of it drips back into the container, disqualifying the rest. This applies to all birds <b>except for the pigeon, because it sips</b> the water from the container and none falls back in from its mouth. <b>But if it is so</b> that the <i>tasil</i> is a type of pigeon, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach: Except for</b> the <b>pigeon and</b> the <b><i>tasil</i>. Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Although the <i>tasil</i> is a type of pigeon and sips the water as well, <b>this,</b> the <i>tasil</i>, <b>sips</b> the water <b>and spits</b> part of it back, and therefore disqualifies the water of purification, <b>and that,</b> the pigeon, <b>sips but does not spit.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yehuda says: The <i>tzutzeyanei</i> doves are fit for</b> sacrifice <b>on the altar, and they are the doves of Reḥava</b> mentioned earlier. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 14:6): The Torah requires hyssop for the purification of a leper. It must be standard <b>hyssop, and neither a hyssop of Greece, nor stibium hyssop, nor Roman hyssop, nor desert</b> hyssop, <b>nor any</b> other kind of <b>hyssop whose</b> name is accompanied by <b>a modifier.</b> Likewise, <i>tzutzeyanei</i> doves should be unfit for sacrifice, because they have a modifier in their name.

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said: Any</b> item <b>whose name was modified before the giving of the Torah, and</b> concerning which <b>the Torah was particular</b> when naming <b>it, is unfit</b> if <b>its</b> name is accompanied by <b>a modifier,</b> since the language of the Torah was formulated to exclude it. <b>But the name of these</b> <i>tzutzeyanei</i> doves <b>was not modified,</b> i.e., the modifier <i>tzutzeyanei</i> was not applied to them, <b>before the giving of the Torah.</b> Even though it was applied to them later, they are still fit for sacrifice. Alternatively, <b>Rava said: The <i>tzutzeyanei</i> doves are called simply</b> doves <b>in their place</b> of habitation.

### Part 4
Similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda says: These grasshoppers</b> found <b>among the shrubs</b> are kosher and <b>permitted</b> for consumption. <b>And</b> those found <b>among the cabbages are forbidden. Ravina said: And we flog</b> those who eat them <b>on their account, due to</b> the prohibition: “And all <b>winged swarming things</b> are impure unto you” (Deuteronomy 14:19). <b>And Rav Yehuda says:</b> The bird called <b><i>tzarda</i> is permitted</b> for consumption, <b>and</b> the <b><i>barda</i> is prohibited. And your mnemonic</b> to remember which is which is this: Eat any bird <b>except [<i>bar</i>] for it.</b> As for <b>the <i>marda</i>, it is uncertain</b> whether it is kosher.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Asi says: There are eight uncertain</b> cases: The <b><i>ḥuva</i>, <i>ḥuga</i>, <i>suga</i>, and <i>harnuga</i>, <i>tushelemi</i>, and <i>marda</i>, <i>kuḥilna</i>, and <i>bar nappaḥa</i>.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is their uncertainty? The gizzard of kosher birds can be peeled,</b> as mentioned in the mishna, <b>and the gizzard of non-kosher</b> birds <b>cannot be peeled, but the gizzard of these</b> birds <b>can be peeled</b> only <b>with a knife.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why should these not be kosher? Wasn’t there <b>a certain duck in the house of Mar Shmuel whose gizzard could not be peeled, and they set</b> the gizzard <b>in the sun, and once it softened it could be peeled?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>There, when it softened it could be peeled by hand. Here,</b> in these eight cases, <b>even when it softened it could be peeled only with a knife.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Abaye says: The swamp rooster is one of the eight uncertain</b> cases, <b>and this is</b> the <b><i>mardu</i>,</b> i.e., the <i>marda</i> mentioned earlier. <b>Rav Pappa says: The swamp rooster is forbidden, but the swamphen is permitted. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the statement of the Sages with regard to the verse: “An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:4), that <b>an Ammonite man</b> is unfit to enter the assembly, <b>but not an Ammonite woman. Mareimar taught: The swamphen is forbidden,</b> because the Sages <b>saw that it claws</b> its prey <b>and eats</b> it. <b>And this is</b> the <b><i>giruta</i>,</b> a non-kosher bird (see 109b).

### Part 8
<b>Rav says:</b> The bird called the <b><i>shavor anderafta</i> is permitted,</b> but the <b><i>piruz anderafta</i> is forbidden. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the known personality <b>Piruz the Evil. Rav Huna says:</b> The bird called the <b><i>bunya</i> is permitted.</b> The <b><i>parva</i> is forbidden. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the known personality <b>Parva’a the Sorcerer.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The bird known as the <b>reclining and eating <i>mardu</i> is permitted,</b> while the <b>bowing and eating</b> <i>mardu</i> <b>is forbidden. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the verse: <b>“You shall bow down to no other god”</b> (Exodus 34:14). <b>Shmuel says:</b> The bird called the <b>wine drinker is forbidden. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the <i>halakha</i>: <b>Those who drank wine are unfit for service</b> in the Temple. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> The bird called the <b>wine pourer is forbidden.</b>
