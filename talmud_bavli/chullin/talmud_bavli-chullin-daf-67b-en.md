### Part 1
<b>while attached to the ground is prohibited, due to</b> the prohibition of: “Every <b>swarming thing that swarms upon the earth,”</b> because the cucumber was considered part of the earth when the worms infested it.

### Part 2
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that a comparison of the following two <i>baraitot</i> <b>supports</b> Shmuel’s opinion. <b>As it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: “Every swarming thing that swarms <b>upon the earth”</b> serves <b>to exclude <i>zizin</i>,</b> a type of insect <b>that</b> is found <b>in lentils, and mosquitoes that are in <i>kelisim</i>,</b> a type of bean, <b>and worms that are in dates and in dried figs.</b> All of these are permitted for consumption because they do not swarm on the earth itself. <b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that when the verse states: <b>“Every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth,”</b> the word “every” serves <b>to include</b> as non-kosher <b>worms that are in the roots of olive trees and that are in the roots of vines.</b>

### Part 3
<b>What, is it not</b> that both <b>this and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are referring to insects that are found <b>in the fruit, and this,</b> the latter <i>baraita</i>, deems forbidden fruit that is <b>attached to the ground, and that,</b> the former <i>baraita</i>, deems permitted fruit <b>that is not attached to the ground?</b> This would support Shmuel’s statement that worms in a cucumber attached to the ground are forbidden.

### Part 4
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is possible that both <b>this and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are referring to insects found in vegetation <b>attached to the ground; and</b> the apparent contradiction between the two is <b>not difficult. This,</b> the former <i>baraita</i>, deems permitted insects found <b>in the fruit,</b> and <b>that,</b> the latter <i>baraita</i>, deems forbidden insects found <b>in the tree itself.</b> This interpretation contradicts Shmuel’s statement.

### Part 5
The Gemara notes: The language of the latter <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise, as it teaches: Worms that are in the roots of olive trees and in the roots of vines,</b> clearly referring to the tree itself rather than the fruit. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from it</b> that the second interpretation is correct.

### Part 6
§ From the above discussion, it is clear that worms that grow in produce not attached to the ground, and have never emerged from the produce, do not fall under the prohibition of: “Every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth,” because they have never swarmed on the earth. <b>Rav Yosef raises a dilemma:</b> If a worm <b>emerged</b> from the produce <b>but died</b> before it reached the earth, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered to have swarmed on the earth simply by having emerged? If only <b>part of it</b> emerged, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If it emerged <b>into the air of the world</b> and flew away without landing, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds to all of the above: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> If a worm was spawned in a date, and it emerges and climbs <b>onto the roof of</b> the <b>date,</b> i.e., its upper part, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this considered the normal manner of growth for the worm, in which case this does not render it forbidden, or is the roof of the date considered a separate entity such that crawling there constitutes swarming on the earth? And if it is considered a separate entity, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if the worm climbed <b>onto the roof of</b> the date’s <b>pit?</b> Is this considered the normal manner of growth for the worm? If the worm emerged <b>from a date</b> and entered <b>a date</b> that was attached to it, without being exposed to the air, <b>what</b> then <b>is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds to all of the above: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 8
§ <b>Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, says: <i>Kukeyanei</i>,</b> worms found in the internal organs of animals, e.g., in the lung and liver, are <b>forbidden. What is the reason</b> for this? It is that <b>they came from</b> the outside <b>world,</b> i.e., the animal must have swallowed them along with vegetation, in which case these worms were already included in the prohibition: “Every swarming thing that swarms on the earth is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten.”

### Part 9
<b>Rav Ashi objects to this: If they came from</b> the outside <b>world, they should be found in the digestive tract</b> as well. Since they are found only in non-digestive organs, they must have originated in the animal and should not be considered creeping animals that swarm on the earth.

### Part 10
<b>Some state</b> the exchange differently: <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, says: <i>Kukeyanei</i> are permitted. What is the reason</b> for this? It is that <b>they originate from</b> inside the animal. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> This is <b>obvious, as if they came from</b> the outside <b>world, they should be found in the digestive tract.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: <b><i>Kukeyanei</i> are forbidden. What is the reason</b> for this? It is that the animal <b>sleeps, and worms enter it through its snout.</b> From there they travel to the internal organs without passing through the digestive tract. <b>Worms</b> found in <b>meat</b> between the skin and the flesh <b>are forbidden;</b> those found in <b>fish are permitted.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara recounts: <b>Ravina said to his mother: Conceal</b> the fish’s worms inside it so I cannot see them, <b>and I will eat</b> the fish. <b>Rav Mesharshiyya, son of Rav Aḥa, said to Ravina: What is different</b> in this case <b>from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that the verse: <b>“Their carcasses you shall have in detestation”</b> (Leviticus 11:11), serves <b>to include worms that are in animals</b> as forbidden? Why are worms in fish permitted?

### Part 13
Ravina <b>said to him: How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? An animal is rendered permitted</b> for consumption only <b>by slaughter.</b> Before it is slaughtered, it and all its contents are considered part of a living animal and prohibited by the Torah. <b>And since</b> the animal’s <b>slaughter is not effective for these</b> worms, <b>they retain their forbidden</b> status. <b>But fish are rendered permitted by merely gathering</b> them; they are not included in the prohibition against eating a limb from a living animal. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>when these</b> worms <b>originate</b> inside the fish, <b>they originate in a permitted</b> state.

### Part 14
§ The verse states: “Whatever goes upon the belly, and whatever goes upon all fours, or whatever has many feet, even all swarming things that swarm upon the earth, them you shall not eat” (Leviticus 11:42). <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the phrase <b>“goes upon the belly”</b> is referring to the <b>snake.</b> The preceding word <b>“whatever”</b> serves <b>to include</b> the <b>earthworm and</b> animals <b>similar to an earthworm.</b> The phrase <b>“upon all fours”</b> is referring to the <b>scorpion.</b> The preceding phrase <b>“whatever goes”</b> serves <b>to include the beetle and</b> animals <b>similar to a beetle.</b> The phrase <b>“has many feet”</b> is referring to the <b>centipede.</b> The preceding phrase <b>“or whatever”</b> serves <b>to include</b> animals <b>similar</b> to a centipede <b>and</b> animals <b>similar to those similar to</b> it.

### Part 15
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Durmaskit says:</b> The <b>leviathan</b> mentioned in the Bible <b>is a kosher fish, as it is stated: “His armor is his pride”</b> (Job 41:7), and: <b>“Sharpest potsherds are under him”</b> (Job 41:22). The phrase <b>“his armor”</b> is referring to <b>his scales,</b> which protect him like armor. The phrase <b>“sharpest potsherds are under him”</b> is referring to <b>fins with which he swims,</b> which are sharp and project from his underside.
