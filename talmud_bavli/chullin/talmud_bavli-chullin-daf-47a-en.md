### Part 1
<b>And Rava says: These two cysts that are adjacent to one another</b> on the lung <b>have no</b> need for <b>inspection.</b> The animal is definitely a <i>tereifa</i>, since it is presumed that the cysts formed around a perforation in the lung. But if there is only <b>one</b> cyst that <b>looks like two,</b> due to a depression in the middle, <b>we bring a thorn and pierce it</b> to remove the fluid inside. <b>If</b> the fluids from either side <b>empty into one another,</b> this indicates that <b>it is one</b> cyst, <b>and</b> the animal is <b>kosher. And if not, they are two</b> separate cysts, <b>and</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 2
§ <b>And Rava says: The lung has five lobes [<i>unnei</i>].</b> When the animal hangs by its legs with <b>its face toward the person</b> checking it, he sees <b>three</b> lobes <b>on</b> his <b>right and two on</b> his <b>left.</b> If the animal is <b>missing</b> a lobe <b>or</b> has <b>an extra</b> lobe, <b>or</b> if the lobes were <b>switched,</b> with two on the right and three on the left, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara relates that <b>a certain</b> lung that <b>had an extra</b> lobe <b>was brought before Mareimar. Rav Aḥa was sitting at the door</b> of Mareimar’s house. When the animal’s owner was leaving, Rav Aḥa <b>said to him: What did</b> Mareimar <b>say to you?</b> The man <b>said to him:</b> Mareimar <b>deemed it kosher.</b> Rav Aḥa was surprised by this, because it contradicts Rava’s statement, so <b>he said to him: Turn around</b> and <b>bring</b> the animal <b>before him.</b> The owner did so. Mareimar realized why he was being asked twice, and <b>said to him: Go tell whomever is sitting at the door: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava in</b> the case of an animal that has <b>an extra</b> lobe.

### Part 4
The Gemara adds: <b>And this statement</b> applies only <b>when</b> the extra lobe <b>stands in line with the</b> other <b>lobes,</b> on the left or right. <b>But</b> if it is <b>in between</b> the two sides, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara relates that <b>a certain</b> animal with an extra lobe <b>in between</b> the two sides <b>was brought before Rav Ashi. Rav Ashi thought to deem it a <i>tereifa</i>. Rav Huna Mar bar Avya said to him: All those animals</b> that graze <b>outside</b> in the fields <b>have</b> extra lobes like <b>this, and butchers call it the little rose lobe.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>And this statement</b> applies only when the extra lobe is on the <b>inside</b> face of the lung, facing the heart.
