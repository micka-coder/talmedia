### Part 1
<b>and to us,</b> the residents of Babylonia, not only is it forbidden but <b>it also does not seal</b> a perforation? It cannot be that this fat is forbidden by Torah law if they permit it for consumption. Even though we are stringent with regard to its consumption, we may still maintain that it effectively seals a perforation.

### Part 2
The Gemara explains: The abomasum is shaped like a bow. The side facing outward is curved like the bow itself, while the side facing inward is flat and straight like the bowstring. With regard to the fat <b>that is on the bow, everyone agrees,</b> even the residents of Eretz Yisrael, <b>that it is forbidden</b> for consumption. This fat, then, is the <i>ḥimtza</i>, which does not seal a perforation according to Rav Naḥman. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is with regard to the fat <b>that is on the bowstring.</b> The residents of Eretz Yisrael permit it for consumption, while those of Babylonia prohibit it. According to Rav Naḥman, the residents of Babylonia should concede that it is nevertheless an effective seal. This, then, is the <i>bar ḥimtza</i>.

### Part 3
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that with regard to the fat <b>that is on the bowstring, everyone agrees that it is permitted.</b> This, then, is the <i>bar ḥimtza</i>. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is with regard to the fat <b>that is on the bow.</b> The residents of Eretz Yisrael permit it, but the residents of Babylonia prohibit it. This, then, is the <i>ḥimtza</i>.

### Part 4
The Gemara adds: When it was stated that only the residents of Eretz Yisrael permit the fat on the bowstring for consumption, this means that they would eat it in a manner <b>like that which Rav Avya says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> One <b>takes a handful</b> of the fat that lies above the fat on the bowstring, since this is the fat prohibited by the verse: “And all the fat that is upon the innards” (Leviticus 3:3), and the rest is permitted for consumption. <b>And so says Rabbi Yannai,</b> also a resident of Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of a certain elder:</b> One <b>takes a handful. Rav Avya said: I was standing before Rabbi Ami.</b> The people there <b>took a handful</b> of the fat on the bowstring <b>and gave him</b> the remaining fat, <b>and he ate</b> from it.

### Part 5
The Gemara relates: <b>The attendant of Rabbi Ḥanina was standing before Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> a resident of Eretz Yisrael. Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to him: Take</b> off <b>a handful</b> from that fat on the bowstring and <b>give me</b> the rest so <b>that I will eat</b> from it. Rabbi Ḥanina <b>saw that</b> the attendant <b>was hesitating,</b> so <b>he said to him: You are a Babylonian</b> and usually consider all of this fat forbidden. If so, <b>cut</b> off all the fat and <b>throw it</b> away.

### Part 6
§ The mishna states that if the small intestines are perforated, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. With regard to this, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If the <b>intestines were perforated but mucus seals</b> the perforated intestines, the animal is <b>kosher.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this <b>mucus? Rav Kahana said:</b> It is the <b>mucus of the intestines that comes out under pressure,</b> when one scrapes with a knife.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates: <b>The colleagues of Rabbi Abba learned</b> a tradition <b>from Rabbi Abba. And who are they?</b> The phrase: Colleagues of Rabbi Abba, is referring to <b>Rabbi Zeira. And some say the colleagues of Rabbi Zeira</b> learned it <b>from Rabbi Zeira. And who are they? Rabbi Abba.</b> This is the tradition: <b>Rabbi Abba, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, said</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, and</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>mourning.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara elaborates: The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>; this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>that we stated</b> above, that mucus forms an effective seal in the intestines. The <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to mourning; what is</b> this <i>halakha</i>? <b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one learns of the death of an immediate relative after other relatives have already begun their period of mourning, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: During <b>the entire first three days</b> of mourning, if a mourner <b>comes</b> to the house of mourning <b>from a nearby place, he counts</b> his days of mourning <b>with</b> the other mourners and completes his mourning with them.

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If he came <b>from a distant place, he counts</b> seven days <b>on his own</b> from the time that he was informed of the death. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> i.e., after the first three days, <b>even if he comes from a nearby place, he counts</b> seven days <b>on his own. Rabbi Shimon says: Even on the seventh day,</b> if <b>he comes from a nearby place, he counts</b> and completes his mourning <b>with</b> the other mourners.

### Part 10
<b>Someone</b> whose name was not given <b>said: May I merit to go up</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>and learn this <i>halakha</i> from the mouth of its Master. When he went up</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rabbi Abba, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba,</b> and <b>said to him:</b> Is it true that <b>the Master said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>?</b> Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: This</b> is not true. Rather, <b>I said</b> just the opposite, that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not</b> in accordance with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and even if mucus seals the perforation of the intestine, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 11
The anonymous man asked Rabbi Abba again: <b>What</b> about the other ruling reported in your name, that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to mourning;</b> is this accurate? Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: There are conflicting</b> opinions with regard to this matter, <b>as it was stated</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, <b>and so says Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> That is the <b><i>halakha</i>. But Rav Naḥman says:</b> That is <b>not</b> the <b><i>halakha</i>.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara concludes: <b>And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, and</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to mourning, in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Shmuel,</b> who <b>says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of the</b> more <b>lenient</b> authority <b>in</b> matters relating to <b>mourning.</b>

### Part 13
§ <b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya says: One may compare</b> perforations <b>in the intestines.</b> If one is unsure whether a perforation occurred before or after slaughter, one may make an additional perforation and compare the two. If their appearance is similar, one may conclude that the perforation occurred after slaughter, and the animal is kosher.

### Part 14
The Gemara relates: There were <b>certain</b> perforated <b>intestines that came before Rava.</b> Rava made other perforations and <b>compared them, but they were not similar. Rav Mesharshiyya, his son, came</b> and <b>rubbed</b> the new perforations, <b>and they were similar.</b> Rav Mesharshiyya therefore deemed the animal kosher. Rava <b>said to him: From where</b> did <b>you</b> know to do <b>this?</b> Rav Mesharshiyya <b>said to him:</b> I reasoned: <b>How many hands rubbed these</b> earlier perforations <b>before they came before</b> the <b>Master?</b> Therefore, I thought that if I handled the new ones, perhaps they would look similar. Rava <b>said to him: My son is as wise in</b> matters of <b><i>tereifot</i> as Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>

### Part 15
Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both say: One may compare</b> perforations <b>in the lung</b> to determine whether they occurred after slaughter. <b>Rava said: We said</b> this <b>only</b> when the two perforations are <b>on the same side</b> of the lungs. <b>But</b> one may <b>not</b> compare perforations <b>from</b> one <b>side to the</b> other <b>side.</b> The Gemara rules: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: One may compare <b>even from</b> one <b>side to the</b> other <b>side,</b> and even <b>from a small</b> animal <b>to</b> another <b>small</b> animal, <b>or from a large</b> animal <b>to</b> another <b>large</b> animal, <b>but not from a large</b> animal <b>to a small</b> animal, <b>and not from a small</b> animal <b>to a large</b> animal.

### Part 16
Similarly, <b>Abaye and Rava both say: One may compare</b> severed or perforated areas <b>in the windpipe. Rav Pappa said: We said</b> this <b>only</b> when the two areas are <b>in the same segment</b> of the windpipe. <b>But</b> one may <b>not</b> compare <b>from</b> one <b>segment to</b> another <b>segment.</b> The Gemara rules: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: One may <b>even</b> compare <b>from</b> one <b>segment to</b> another <b>segment, and from</b> one <b>subsegment,</b> i.e., a thin segment between the main segments, <b>to</b> another <b>subsegment, but not from a segment to a subsegment, and not from a subsegment to a segment.</b>

### Part 17
§ <b>Ze’eiri says:</b> If <b>the rectum was perforated,</b> the animal is <b>kosher, since the hips hold it up</b> and seal the perforation. <b>And</b> to <b>how much</b> of the rectum does this apply? <b>Rabbi Ilai says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If the rectum was perforated in <b>the place where</b> it <b>is attached</b> to the hips, even if it was perforated <b>in its majority,</b> the animal is kosher. If the perforation was <b>not in the place where</b> it <b>is attached</b> to the hips, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if it was perforated <b>in any amount.</b>

### Part 18
<b>The Sages said this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>before Rava in the name of Rav Naḥman.</b> Rava <b>said</b> to them: <b>Have I not told you not to hang on</b> Rav Naḥman
