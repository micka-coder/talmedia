### Part 1
<b>And</b> both <b>these and those,</b> i.e., both liquids that issue from one who immersed himself that day and liquids he touches, <b>do not impart ritual impurity. And</b> with regard to <b>all other</b> sources of <b>impurity, whether minor</b> sources <b>or major</b> sources, <b>liquids that issue from them</b> have the same status <b>as liquids that touch them, and</b> both <b>these and those have</b> first-degree ritual impurity, since they touched a primary source of ritual impurity upon exiting the source. This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>except for a liquid that is</b> itself <b>a primary source of</b> ritual <b>impurity.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>minor</b> sources <b>and what</b> is the meaning of <b>major</b> sources? <b>What, is it not</b> that the term: <b>Minor</b> sources, is referring to <b>a creeping animal or a <i>zav</i>, and</b> that the term: <b>Major</b> sources, is referring to <b>a corpse?</b> If so, the mishna teaches that all liquids that issue from a corpse are ritually impure, in contradiction to the <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the term: <b>Minor</b> sources, is referring to <b>a creeping animal,</b> e.g., urine found inside its body, which is not considered ritually impure, <b>and</b> the term: <b>Major</b> sources, is referring to <b>a <i>zav</i>,</b> concerning whom all liquids that issue from him are ritually impure. By contrast, liquids that issue from a corpse are ritually pure with the exception of blood.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> with regard to <b>a <i>zav</i>, concerning whom the Sages decreed</b> that liquids that issue from him are ritually impure, <b>and what is different</b> with regard to <b>a corpse, concerning which the Sages did not decree</b> that liquids that issue from it are ritually impure? The Gemara responds: In the case of <b>a <i>zav</i>, since people do not</b> naturally <b>separate from him, the Sages decreed</b> additional restrictions <b>with regard to him</b> in order to prevent others from contracting impurity from liquids that issue from a <i>zav</i> that are impure by Torah law. In the case of <b>a corpse, since people</b> naturally <b>separate from it, the Sages did not decree</b> additional restrictions <b>with regard to it.</b>

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches that one is obligated to cover <b>blood that spurts</b> outside the pit over which the animal was slaughtered, or onto the wall, <b>and</b> blood <b>that</b> remained <b>on the</b> slaughtering <b>knife.</b> With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall cover it”</b> (Leviticus 17:13), which <b>teaches that</b> one is <b>obligated to cover blood that spurted and</b> blood <b>that</b> remained <b>on the</b> slaughtering <b>knife. Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> is this the <i>halakha</i>? <b>When there is no blood except that</b> blood. <b>But</b> if <b>there is</b> other <b>blood that is not that</b> blood, one is <b>exempt from covering</b> it.

### Part 5
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The term: <b>“And he shall cover it,” teaches that</b> one is <b>obligated to cover all</b> of the <b>blood. From here</b> the Sages <b>stated:</b> With regard to <b>blood that spurts out and</b> blood <b>that</b> remains <b>on the sides</b> of the animal’s throat where it was slaughtered, one is <b>obligated to cover</b> it. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where</b> one <b>did not</b> already <b>cover the blood of the soul,</b> i.e., the blood that flows from the place of slaughter as the animal dies. <b>But if</b> one already <b>covered the blood of the soul,</b> he is <b>exempt from</b> the obligation <b>to cover</b> the blood that spurted out or the blood remaining on the sides of the animal’s neck in the area of slaughter.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> matter <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that the expression: <b>“Its blood”</b> (Leviticus 17:13), indicates an obligation to cover <b>all of its blood,</b> even the blood that spurts out. <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>“its blood”</b> indicates that one may fulfill the mitzva with any part of the blood, <b>even</b> with <b>a small amount of its blood. And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds</b> that <b>“its blood”</b> refers to the <b>special</b> blood, i.e., the blood of the soul.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>With what</b> substances <b>may one cover</b> the blood <b>and with what</b> substances <b>may one not cover</b> the blood? <b>One</b> may <b>cover</b> the blood <b>with fine</b> granulated <b>manure, with fine sand, with lime, with</b> crushed <b>potsherd, and with a brick or</b> the <b>lid</b> of an earthenware barrel <b>that one crushed. But one may not cover</b> the blood <b>with thick manure, nor with thick,</b> clumped <b>sand, nor with a brick or the lid</b> of an earthenware barrel <b>that one did not crush. Neither may one</b> merely <b>turn a vessel over</b> the blood. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel stated a principle:</b> With regard to <b>a substance in which plants grow, one may cover</b> blood <b>with it; and</b> with regard to a substance in <b>which plants do not grow, one may not cover</b> blood <b>with it.</b>

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one may cover the blood with fine sand. The Gemara asks: <b>What is considered fine sand? Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>any</b> sand <b>that the</b> pottery <b>producer does not need to crush</b> in order to use it. The Gemara notes: <b>And some teach this</b> statement <b>in reference to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which states: <b>But one may not cover</b> the blood <b>with thick manure, nor with thick sand.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is considered thick sand? Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>any</b> sand <b>that the</b> pottery <b>producer must crush</b> in order to use it.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these two versions? The Gemara responds: <b>There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to sand <b>that requires</b> some crushing <b>and</b> sand that <b>does not require</b> full crushing, i.e., <b>that crumbles</b> in one’s hand and does not require a tool. According to the first version, as long as the sand does not require crushing it may be used to cover the blood. Therefore, sand that requires crumbling may be used since it is not considered sand that requires crushing. According to the second version, any sand that requires some crushing may not be used. Therefore, sand that requires crumbling may not be used to cover the blood.

### Part 10
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the mitzva of covering the blood: <b>“And cover it”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he may cover</b> the blood <b>with stones or</b> merely <b>turn a vessel over it.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “With earth.”</b> Based on this expression <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>earth</b> may be used. <b>From where</b> does one derive <b>to include fine manure, fine sand, crushed stones, crushed potsherd, fine chaff of flax,</b>
