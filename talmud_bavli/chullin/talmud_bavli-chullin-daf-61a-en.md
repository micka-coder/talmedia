### Part 1
<b>Just as a <i>nesher</i></b> is <b>unique</b> in <b>that it has no extra digit or crop, and its gizzard cannot be peeled, and it claws</b> its prey <b>and eats</b> it, and it is <b>non-kosher, so too, all like</b> birds with these four signs are <b>non-kosher.</b> And just as <b>doves</b> and pigeons, <b>which have an extra digit and a crop, and whose gizzard can be peeled, and do not claw</b> their food <b>and eat</b> it, are <b>kosher,</b> as they are fit for sacrifice on the altar (see Leviticus 1:14), <b>so too, all like</b> birds with these four signs are <b>kosher.</b> If so, why does the mishna state that the signs were not stated in the Torah? <b>Abaye said:</b> The mishna means that <b>the explanation of</b> the signs of a kosher bird <b>was not stated in the Torah. Rather,</b> one learns it <b>from the statements of the Sages,</b> i.e., the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi á¸¤iyya teaches: A bird that comes</b> before a person <b>with one sign</b> of a kosher bird, and which is not listed in the Torah as non-kosher, <b>is kosher, since it is unlike a <i>nesher</i>.</b> The verse did not need to state that the <i>nesher</i> is non-kosher, since one could have inferred this from the list of other non-kosher birds. Rather, the verse mentions the <i>nesher</i> specifically to indicate that <b>it is</b> only a bird like <b>a <i>nesher</i>, which has none</b> of the signs of a kosher bird, <b>that you shall not eat. But</b> if <b>there is</b> a bird <b>that has</b> even <b>one</b> of the signs, <b>you may eat</b> it.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why learn specifically from the case of a <i>nesher</i>? <b>Let one derive</b> the opposite <b>from</b> the case of <b>doves: Just as doves, which</b> the Torah mentions explicitly as kosher, <b>have all four</b> signs, <b>so too here,</b> no other bird is kosher <b>unless it has all four</b> signs.

### Part 4
The Gemara responds: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that one learns from the case of a dove, <b>why do I</b> need <b>the rest of the non-kosher birds that the Merciful One wrote?</b> Since none of them has all four signs of a kosher bird, their non-kosher status could simply be inferred from the case of a dove. Rather, since the Torah states explicitly that they are non-kosher, it follows that one does not learn from the case of a dove.

### Part 5
The Gemara objects: <b>But let us derive</b> instead <b>from them,</b> i.e., the rest of the non-kosher birds, which each have only three signs, the following: <b>Just as there,</b> those birds have <b>three</b> of the signs of a kosher bird mentioned in the mishna, <b>and we</b> still <b>do not eat</b> them, <b>so too, all</b> other birds that have <b>three signs</b> should have the same halakhic status, <b>and we will not eat</b> them. <b>And all the more so</b> should this apply to a bird that has only <b>two</b> signs <b>or one.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara responds: <b>If so, why do I</b> need <b>the crow that the Merciful One wrote</b> among the non-kosher birds? <b>Now</b> that it is established <b>that we do not eat</b> any bird <b>that has three</b> signs, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to mention the crow, <b>which has</b> only <b>two?</b> Rather, those birds explicitly listed as non-kosher are prohibited, and all other birds with any number of signs are kosher.
