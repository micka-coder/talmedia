### Part 1
And <b>one who takes a vow</b> that <b>meat</b> is prohibited to him is <b>permitted to</b> eat <b>the meat of fish and grasshoppers.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Since the mishna does not distinguish between the meat of animals and that of birds, it may <b>consequently</b> be inferred that the meat of <b>birds</b> cooked in milk is <b>prohibited by Torah law,</b> just like the meat of animals. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this ruling? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, as, if</b> you say it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, didn’t he say</b> that the prohibition of the meat of <b>undomesticated animals and birds</b> cooked in milk <b>is not by Torah law?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara continues: But <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>One who takes a vow</b> that <b>meat</b> is forbidden to him is <b>permitted to</b> eat <b>the meat of fish and grasshoppers.</b> It may <b>consequently</b> be inferred that it is <b>prohibited</b> for him to eat <b>birds.</b> If so, here <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who said: Anything about which an agent</b> sent to purchase a given item <b>would inquire,</b> being unsure whether it qualifies as that type of item, <b>is</b> considered <b>its type.</b>

### Part 4
<b>As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 54a): <b>One who takes a vow</b> that <b>vegetables</b> are forbidden to him <b>is permitted to</b> eat <b>gourds,</b> as people do not typically consider gourds a type of vegetable, <b>but Rabbi Akiva deems</b> it <b>prohibited</b> for him to eat gourds. The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Akiva: But</b> it is a common occurrence that <b>a person says to his agent: Purchase vegetables for us, and</b> the agent, after failing to find vegetables, returns and <b>says: I found only gourds.</b> This indicates that gourds are not considered vegetables.

### Part 5
Rabbi Akiva <b>said to them: The matter is so,</b> and that proves that my opinion is correct. <b>Does</b> the agent return and <b>say: I found only legumes? Rather,</b> it is evident <b>that gourds are included in</b> the category of <b>vegetables,</b> although they differ from other vegetables, and therefore, the agent explains that he found only gourds, and asks whether he should purchase them. <b>But legumes are not included in</b> the category of <b>vegetables,</b> and that is why an agent would not even ask about them. Therefore, Rabbi Akiva should also hold that one who takes a vow that meat is forbidden to him is prohibited from eating birds. And if so, <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Akiva, <b>and the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> That is not difficult. The entire mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and he formulates</b> the mishna <b>according to</b> the opinions of different <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> In the latter clause, <b>with regard to vows, he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> whereas in the first clause, <b>with regard to meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> a different explanation: <b>The entire</b> mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> as indicated by the latter clause, concerning vows. <b>And</b> as for the first part of the mishna, <b>this</b> is what it <b>is saying:</b> It is <b>prohibited to cook any meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, some</b> types <b>of</b> meat <b>by Torah law,</b> i.e., that of domesticated animals, <b>and some</b> types <b>of</b> meat <b>by rabbinic law,</b> i.e., that of undomesticated animals and birds. This prohibition applies to all types of meat <b>except for the meat of fish and grasshoppers, which are</b> not prohibited, <b>neither by Torah law nor by rabbinic law.</b>

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches further: <b>And</b> it is <b>prohibited to place</b> any meat with cheese on one table. <b>Rav Yosef said: Conclude from</b> this clause that eating the <b>meat of birds</b> cooked <b>in milk</b> is prohibited <b>by Torah law. As, if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> that the prohibition against eating it applies merely <b>by rabbinic law,</b> this would be because the <b>consumption</b> of the meat of birds cooked in milk is <b>itself</b> a rabbinic <b>decree,</b> lest one come to eat the meat of an animal in milk. <b>And</b> would <b>we decree</b> against <b>placing</b> birds together with cheese on one table <b>due to</b> the possibility of <b>consumption,</b> which is itself a decree? The Sages do not enact one decree to prevent the violation of another decree.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do you say that we do not issue</b> one rabbinic <b>decree to</b> prevent violation of another rabbinic <b>decree?</b> The source is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥalla</i> 4:8): <b><i>Ḥalla</i> from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, which must be eaten by a priest,
