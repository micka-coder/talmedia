### Part 1
If the bird fell on <b>fine sand, we</b> need <b>not be concerned,</b> because the sand slides on impact, cushioning the fall. If it fell on <b>coarse sand, we must be concerned,</b> because there are large stones mixed into it. If it fell on <b>dust of the road, we must be concerned,</b> because the dust is compact and hard. If the bird fell on <b>bundled straw, we must be concerned,</b> because it is compact and hard. If the straw <b>was not bundled, we</b> need <b>not be concerned.</b>

### Part 2
If the bird fell on <b>wheat and all</b> similar <b>types of</b> grain, such as spelt or rye, whose kernels are hard, <b>we must be concerned.</b> If it fell on <b>barley and all</b> similar <b>types of</b> grain, such as oats, <b>we must be concerned.</b> With regard to <b>all types of beans, there is no</b> concern <b>due to</b> possible <b>shattered limbs</b> if a bird fell <b>on them,</b> since their round shape causes the bird to slide when it hits them, <b>except for fenugreek.</b> With regard to <b>peas, there is no</b> concern <b>due to</b> possible <b>shattered limbs,</b> but <b>with regard to chickpeas, there is</b> a concern <b>due to</b> possible <b>shattered limbs. The principle of the matter</b> is: <b>With regard to anything that slips</b> to the sides on impact, <b>there is no</b> concern <b>due to</b> possible <b>shattered limbs.</b> And with regard to anything that <b>does not slip, there is</b> a concern <b>due to</b> possible <b>shattered limbs.</b>

### Part 3
If the bird’s wings became stuck to <b>a <i>davuk</i>,</b> a board covered with glue set as a trap, and in trying to escape it fell to the ground while stuck to the board, <b>Rav Ashi deemed</b> the bird <b>permitted,</b> while <b>Ameimar deemed</b> it <b>prohibited.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>In</b> a case where only <b>one wing</b> was stuck to the board, <b>everyone agrees that it is permitted,</b> because the bird flaps with the other wing, lessening the impact of the fall. <b>They disagree when both wings</b> are stuck to the board. The one <b>who deemed</b> it <b>prohibited</b> could have <b>said to you: How will it stand</b> itself up so that it might dampen the impact? <b>And</b> the one <b>who deemed</b> it <b>permitted</b> could have <b>said to you: It is possible for</b> it to <b>stand</b> itself up <b>by</b> using <b>the tips of</b> its <b>wings.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say: In</b> a case where <b>two wings</b> were stuck to the board, <b>everyone agrees that it is prohibited,</b> because it cannot dampen the impact. <b>They disagree when</b> only <b>one wing</b> is stuck to the board. <b>The one who deemed</b> it <b>permitted</b> could have <b>said to you: It is possible for</b> it to <b>fly with one wing</b> and dampen the fall. <b>And the one who deemed</b> it <b>prohibited</b> could say: <b>Since it cannot fly with this</b> wing that is stuck to the <i>davuk</i>, <b>it also cannot fly with that</b> untrapped wing. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: <b>In</b> a case where <b>two wings</b> were stuck, it is <b>prohibited. In</b> a case where only <b>one wing</b> was stuck, it is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 5
§ The mishna states that if <b>most of</b> an animal’s <b>ribs were fractured,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>The Sages taught: These are most of the ribs: Six from here and six from there,</b> i.e., six on each side, <b>or eleven from here and one from there.</b> Twenty-two ribs are significant for matters of <i>tereifot</i>, eleven on each side. Twelve fractured ribs constitutes a majority.

### Part 6
<b>Ze’eiri says: And</b> this applies only when the ribs were fractured <b>from the half of</b> the rib <b>toward the spine,</b> but not if they were fractured on the other half. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And</b> this applies only to fractures occurring <b>in large ribs that contain marrow;</b> fractures in small ribs do not render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 7
§ <b>Ulla said</b> that <b>ben Zakkai says:</b> If the ribs were <b>dislocated</b> from the spine, even <b>a majority of one side,</b> i.e., six dislocated ribs, is enough to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. Only if the ribs were <b>broken</b> is <b>a majority of both sides</b> necessary. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Whether they were dislocated or broken,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> only <b>with a majority of both sides.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav says:</b> If <b>a rib was dislocated and</b> the attached <b>vertebra</b> was torn out <b>with it,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> even if the spinal cord remains intact. <b>Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav:</b> If <b>a rib was dislocated from here and</b> another <b>rib from there,</b> i.e., both ribs connected to a single vertebra were dislocated, <b>but</b> the <b>vertebra</b> itself remains <b>intact, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav <b>said to them: Are you saying</b> that an animal that was <b>sliced</b> in half is a <i>tereifa</i>? This animal is considered to have been sliced and already has the status of a carcass, as it is already considered dead (see 21a).

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rav also say</b> that <b>a sliced</b> animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, since he said that if a rib was dislocated along with the attached vertebra, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>? In such a case, the opposite rib is inevitably detached. If so, the animal should be considered a carcass. The Gemara responds: <b>When Rav said</b> that such an animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, he was referring to a case where the <b>rib</b> was dislocated <b>without the vertebra.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t</b> Rav explicitly <b>say</b> his statement with regard to <b>a rib and vertebra</b> that were dislocated? The Gemara responds: Rav meant that if <b>a rib and half</b> its attached <b>vertebra</b> were dislocated, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. The opposite rib, however, is intact and connected to the remainder of the vertebra.

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges: <b>By inference,</b> one may conclude <b>that Rav Kahana and Rav Asi stated</b> their question with regard to a less serious case, i.e., where <b>a rib</b> from each side was torn out <b>without</b> the <b>vertebra</b> being damaged at all. <b>And</b> yet, Rav <b>said to them: Are you saying</b> that an animal that was <b>sliced</b> in half is a <i>tereifa</i>? Rather, this animal is a carcass and is certainly prohibited. <b>And</b> how could Rav say this? <b>But didn’t Ulla say</b> that <b>ben Zakkai says:</b> If the ribs were <b>dislocated,</b> even <b>a majority of one side</b> is enough to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, while if the ribs were <b>broken, a majority of both sides</b> is necessary? If so, any animal with fewer than six dislocated ribs should be kosher, as long as the spine is undamaged.

### Part 12
The Gemara responds: Rav could have <b>said to you: There,</b> where ben Zakkai says that six dislocated ribs on one side render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, this is referring only to ribs <b>not</b> dislocated <b>one opposite the other. Here,</b> where Rav says that two dislocated ribs render the animal a carcass, this is referring to ribs dislocated <b>one opposite the other.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> only if <b>a majority of both sides</b> was dislocated, <b>and in a majority of both sides, it is impossible that one of them is not situated opposite another?</b> Still, Rabbi Yoḥanan says that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> and not a carcass.

### Part 14
The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring to a case where <b>the pestle,</b> i.e., the end of the rib, was torn out <b>without the mortar,</b> the socket of the vertebra in which it sits, leaving the spine completely intact. In such a case, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> only if twelve ribs were dislocated, even though this necessarily includes one rib opposite another. <b>Here,</b> where Rav says that two dislocated ribs opposite one another render the animal a carcass, that is referring to a case where the <b>pestle and mortar</b> were torn out together, damaging the spine.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why did Rav Kahana and Rav Asi ask anything of Rav? Their case in question <b>is</b> identical to the statement of <b>Rav.</b> If Rav says that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if a rib and part of its vertebra were dislocated, that should be the <i>halakha</i> all the more so if ribs opposite one another were dislocated in addition to part of the attached vertebra. The Gemara responds: Rav Kahana and Rav Asi <b>did not hear</b> that statement <b>of Rav.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara persists: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let them ask</b> about the simpler case of one dislocated rib, <b>like that</b> which <b>Rav</b> himself discussed. Why ask specifically about two ribs opposite one another? The Gemara responds: <b>They reasoned: Let us ask him one</b> question through <b>which he</b> will <b>explain to us two</b> different cases. <b>As, if we ask him</b> about only <b>one</b> dislocated rib, <b>this works out well if he says to us</b> that the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> because we can infer that <b>all the more so</b> if <b>two</b> ribs opposite one another are dislocated, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. But <b>if he says to us</b> that it is <b>kosher, we</b> must <b>still ask</b> with regard to a case of <b>two</b> dislocated ribs.

### Part 17
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>now, too, when they ask him</b> about <b>two</b> ribs, they may not receive an answer with regard to both cases. Granted, <b>this works out well if he says to them</b> that an animal with two dislocated ribs opposite one another is <b>kosher,</b> since they can infer that <b>all the more so</b> it is kosher if only <b>one</b> rib is dislocated. <b>But if he says to them</b> that it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, they</b> must <b>still ask</b> with regard to a case of only <b>one</b> dislocated rib.

### Part 18
The Gemara responds: <b>They reasoned</b> that it is better to ask about a case where two ribs opposite one another were dislocated, because <b>if</b> it is <b>so</b> that Rav holds that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if even one rib is dislocated, then <b>he would become angry</b> and respond: If an animal with even <b>one</b> dislocated rib is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to ask about an animal with <b>two</b> dislocated ribs?

### Part 19
The Gemara objects: <b>But they did say</b> this question <b>to him and he did not become angry,</b> despite the fact that he holds that even one dislocated rib renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara responds: <b>When he said to them: Are you saying</b> that an animal that was <b>sliced</b> in half is a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>this is his anger.</b> Rav Kahana and Rav Asi understood from this response that an animal with two dislocated ribs opposite one another is a carcass, but an animal with one dislocated rib is a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 20
§ <b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila says</b> that <b>Rav Mattana says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>a rib was ripped from its root, or</b> if the <b>skull was crushed in its majority, or</b> if <b>the flesh that envelops the majority of the rumen</b> was damaged <b>in its majority,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: Did Shmuel really say that if <b>a rib was ripped from its root,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>? But raise a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:3):
