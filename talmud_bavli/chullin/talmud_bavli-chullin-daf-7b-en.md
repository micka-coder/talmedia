### Part 1
The hosts <b>sifted</b> the barley with a utensil, but the donkey <b>did not eat</b> it. <b>They separated</b> the chaff from the barley by hand, but the donkey <b>did not eat</b> it. They wondered why the donkey would not eat the barley. Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said to</b> his hosts: <b>Perhaps</b> the barley <b>is not tithed.</b> They <b>tithed it and</b> the donkey <b>ate</b> it. Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said: This poor</b> animal <b>is going to perform the will of its Maker, and you are feeding it untithed produce?</b> Rabbi Zeira was referring to this donkey when it spoke of God preventing mishaps from occurring through animals of the righteous.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And is one</b> who purchases grain that is <i>demai</i> in order to feed his animal <b>obligated</b> to tithe it? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 1:3): <b>One who purchases</b> grain in the market <b>for sowing or for</b> feeding <b>an animal, or flour to</b> process animal <b>hides, or oil to</b> kindle <b>a lamp, or oil to smear on vessels is exempt from the</b> obligation of tithing <b><i>demai</i>?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>There, it was stated</b> with regard to that mishna that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one purchased</b> those items <b>initially for the animal</b> or for the other purposes enumerated in the mishna, <b>but</b> if <b>he purchased them initially for a person and reconsidered</b> his plans <b>for them</b> and decided to use them <b>for an animal, he is obligated to tithe</b> the <i>demai</i>. <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in support of that understanding: In the case of <b>one who purchases produce from the market for</b> human <b>consumption, and</b> he <b>reconsidered</b> his plans <b>for it</b> and decided to use it <b>for an animal, that</b> person <b>may neither place</b> it <b>before his animal nor before the animal of another unless he tithed</b> the produce.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>heard</b> that Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir arrived, and he <b>emerged to greet him.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him:</b> Is it <b>your desire</b> to <b>dine with me?</b> Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said to him: Yes. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>face beamed [<i>tzahavu</i>],</b> as it was well known that Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir did not accept invitations to dine with others.

### Part 5
Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Are you under the impression that deriving benefit from the Jewish people is forbidden to me by vow?</b> On the contrary, <b>the Jewish people are holy.</b> I avoid accepting invitations, as <b>there is one who wants</b> to invite guests to dine with him <b>but he does not have</b> the means, and I do not want to enjoy a meal that my host cannot afford. <b>And there is one who has</b> the means <b>but does not want</b> to host guests, <b>and</b> with regard to those people <b>it is written: “Eat not the bread of him that has an evil eye, neither desire his delicacies. For as one that has reckoned within himself, so is he: Eat and drink, says he to you; but his heart is not with you”</b> (Proverbs 23:6–7). <b>But you want</b> to invite guests to dine with you, <b>and you have</b> the means.

### Part 6
<b>But now I am rushing [<i>mesarheivna</i>], as I am engaged in</b> the performance of <b>a matter involving a mitzva. When I come back I will enter to</b> dine with <b>you.</b>

### Part 7
<b>When</b> Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>came</b> back, <b>he happened to enter through that entrance in which white mules were standing. He said: The Angel of Death</b> is <b>in this</b> person’s <b>house, and I will eat with him?</b> White mules were known to be dangerous animals.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>heard</b> the comment of Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir and <b>emerged to greet him. He said to him: I will sell</b> the mules. Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said to him:</b> You will thereby violate the prohibition: <b>“Nor place a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), as it is prohibited for any Jew to keep a destructive animal in his possession.

### Part 9
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to him: <b>I will declare</b> the mules <b>ownerless.</b> Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir said to him: <b>You</b> will thereby <b>increase the damage,</b> as there will be no owner to restrain it. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to him: <b>I</b> will <b>remove their</b> hooves so that they will be unable to kick and cause damage. Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir said to him: <b>There is</b> the requirement to prevent <b>suffering to animals,</b> and you will be violating it. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to him: <b>I</b> will <b>kill them.</b> Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir said to him: <b>There is</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not destroy</b> items of value.

### Part 10
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>was greatly imploring him</b> to enter his home until <b>a mountain rose between them</b> and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi could no longer speak with him. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>wept and said: If during their lifetimes</b> it is <b>so</b> that the righteous are great, <b>after their death</b> it is <b>all the more so</b> true. The Gemara comments: This is <b>as Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina says: The righteous are greater after their death, more so than during their lifetimes, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that they spied a raiding party; and they cast the man into the tomb of Elisha; and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet”</b> (II Kings 13:21).

### Part 11
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> This proof from the case of Elisha that the righteous are greater after death is not valid. <b>And perhaps</b> this transpired <b>to fulfill with regard to</b> Elisha <b>the blessing of Elijah, as it is written: “Please, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me”</b> (II Kings 2:9). Elijah revived one dead person and this one is the second revived by Elisha. Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: <b>If so, is this</b> consistent with that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The dead person <b>arose on his feet but he did not go to his home,</b> indicating that he had not truly been revived?

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is the case, <b>in what</b> manner <b>was</b> Elijah’s blessing <b>fulfilled?</b> It is <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The blessing was fulfilled <b>when he cured the leprosy of Naaman, since</b> a leper <b>is equivalent to a dead person, as it is stated</b> with regard to Miriam when she was afflicted with leprosy: <b>“Please, let her not be as one dead”</b> (Numbers 12:12).

### Part 13
Apropos white mules, which were likened to the Angel of Death, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Why are</b> the mules <b>called <i>yemim</i></b> (see Genesis 36:24)? It is <b>because their terror [<i>eimatam</i>] is cast over</b> all <b>creatures, as Rabbi Ḥanina says: In</b> all <b>my days, no man has asked me about a wound</b> caused him <b>by a white mule and survived,</b> indicating that they are extremely dangerous. The Gemara asks: <b>But haven’t we seen that</b> some people <b>survive</b> after being wounded by a white mule? The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> instead, no man has asked me about a wound caused him by a mule <b>and</b> the wound <b>healed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But haven’t we seen that</b> such wounds <b>heal?</b> The Gemara answers: The wound that <b>we say</b> does not heal is one caused by a mule <b>the top of whose legs are white.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara relates other statements of Rabbi Ḥanina: With regard to the verse: <b>“There is none else beside Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:35), <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: And even sorcery</b> is ineffective against the will of God. The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain woman who would try to take dust from beneath the feet of Rabbi Ḥanina</b> in order to perform sorcery on him and harm him. Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to her: Take</b> the dust, but <b>the matter will be ineffective for you,</b> as it <b>is written: “There is none other beside Him.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Why</b> is sorcery <b>called <i>keshafim</i>?</b> It is an acronym for <b><i>makhḥishin pamalya shel mala</i>,</b> meaning: <b>That they diminish the heavenly entourage [<i>pamalya</i>],</b> indicating that they function contrary to the will of God. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina is different, as,</b> because <b>his merit is great,</b> sorcery has no effect on him.

### Part 15
<b>And Rabbi Ḥanina says: A person injures his finger below,</b> on earth, <b>only if they declare about him on high</b> that he should be injured, <b>as it is stated: It is of the Lord that a man’s goings are established; and a man, what does he understand of his way</b> (see Psalms 37:23 and Proverbs 20:24). <b>Rabbi Elazar says: The blood of a wound effects atonement like the blood of a burnt offering. Rava said:</b> This is stated <b>with regard to</b> a wound on his <b>right thumb,</b> as one applies force with that thumb and the wound is consequently more severe; <b>and</b> it is also stated <b>with regard to a second wound</b> in the same place before the first has healed, <b>and it is</b> provided <b>that</b> he is wounded while <b>going to</b> perform <b>a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva.</b>

### Part 16
Apropos Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir, the Gemara notes that <b>they said about Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir: In</b> all <b>his days he never broke</b> bread and recited a blessing <b>on a piece of bread that was not his, and from the day that he achieved cognition he did not benefit</b> even <b>from the meal of his father,</b> because he eschewed benefit from everyone.
