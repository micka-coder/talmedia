<b>to its general prohibition,</b> as the fat of an undomesticated animal is permitted. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a limb</b> from a living animal, <b>where</b> there are <b>no permitted</b> circumstances to <b>its general prohibition,</b> the prohibition of consuming a <i>tereifa</i> does <b>not</b> take effect.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the prohibition against eating a limb from a living animal. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish inquired of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If one took from a living animal a limb that was an olive-bulk and <b>divided it</b> into two pieces <b>when it was outside</b> his mouth and ate each piece separately, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> He is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 3
Reish Lakish then asked Rabbi Yoḥanan: If he placed an olive-bulk of a limb from a living animal <b>inside</b> his mouth and then divided it and swallowed the two parts separately, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes.

### Part 4
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he <b>said</b> an alternative version of this discussion. If one took from a living animal a limb that was an olive-bulk and <b>divided it</b> into two pieces <b>when it was outside</b> his mouth, and he then ate each piece separately, he is <b>exempt.</b> If he divided the limb into two parts <b>inside</b> his mouth, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that he is <b>liable, and Reish Lakish says</b> that he is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> he is <b>liable</b> because his <b>throat derives pleasure from an olive-bulk</b> of a limb from a living animal. <b>And Reish Lakish says</b> that he is <b>exempt</b> because in order to be liable <b>we require</b> an act of <b>eating</b> that contains the requisite amount, i.e., an olive-bulk, when it enters <b>his stomach, and</b> in this case <b>there is not</b> a full olive-bulk that enters his stomach at one time.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: According to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan it is clear how one can be liable for eating an olive-bulk of a limb from a living animal. <b>But according to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, how can you find</b> a case <b>where</b> one will <b>be liable</b> for eating a limb from a living animal, since the food is generally broken up before he swallows it? <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> One would be liable <b>in</b> a case where he eats <b>a small bone</b> that contains an olive-bulk of meat, bone and sinew all together, and that he can swallow whole.

### Part 7
As quoted above, Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish agree that if one divides a limb from a living animal before placing it in his mouth, he is not liable for eating it. The Gemara adds: <b>But Rabbi Elazar says: Even</b> if one <b>divided</b> the limb <b>outside</b> his mouth he is <b>liable.</b> This is because the fact that the two pieces are <b>lacking</b> in <b>proximity</b> to each other as they are placed in one’s mouth is <b>not comparable to lacking an action,</b> i.e., it is not comparable to a case where he ate only half an olive-bulk. Since he ate an entire olive-bulk, he is liable.

### Part 8
§ The Gemara cites another dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish pertaining to the measure of an olive-bulk with regard to prohibitions involving eating. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> The <b>olive-bulk</b> of <b>which</b> the Sages <b>spoke</b> with regard to prohibitions involving eating is measured by the food one actually swallows, <b>aside from</b> the food that remains stuck <b>between the teeth. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it includes <b>even</b> the food that remains stuck <b>between the teeth.</b>

### Part 9
In explanation of this dispute, <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> With regard to food <b>that</b> remains stuck <b>between</b> the <b>teeth, everyone agrees</b> that it is not included in measuring an olive-bulk that would render one liable to receive lashes. <b>When they disagree</b> it is with regard to food that remains <b>on the palate,</b> which one tastes but does not swallow. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that since <b>his throat derives pleasure from an olive-bulk,</b> i.e., he tastes the full olive-bulk, he is liable. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Reish Lakish, <b>holds</b> that in order to be liable, <b>we require</b> an act of <b>eating</b> that contains the requisite amount, i.e., an olive-bulk, when it enters <b>his stomach.</b>

### Part 10
§ The Gemara quotes another related ruling of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>ate half an olive-bulk</b> of a forbidden food <b>and vomited it, and then ate another half an olive-bulk,</b> he is <b>liable. What is the reason?</b> It is <b>because his throat derives pleasure from an olive-bulk</b> of the forbidden food, even though the full olive-bulk did not actually enter his stomach.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Elazar raised a dilemma before Rabbi Asi:</b> If one <b>ate half an olive-bulk</b> of forbidden food <b>and vomited it, and then ate it</b> again, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is the dilemma he is raising? If</b> it is about whether the half-olive-bulk that he ate and vomited up <b>is</b> considered to have been <b>digested,</b> in which case it is no longer considered food, <b>or whether it is not</b> considered to have been <b>digested, let him raise the dilemma</b> with regard to an entire <b>olive-bulk.</b> If one eats an entire olive-bulk and vomits it and then eats it again, if the food is considered not to have been digested the first time, he is liable to be flogged twice.

### Part 12
<b>Rather,</b> his dilemma must be about <b>whether we follow the throat or whether we follow the stomach</b> in measuring how much forbidden food one has swallowed. That being the case, <b>let him resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from</b> that <b>which Rabbi Asi</b> said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said, which indicates that we follow the throat.

### Part 13
The Gemara explains that Rabbi Elazar knew the answer to his question, but <b>Rabbi Asi forgot the statement</b> that he had learned from Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>and Rabbi Elazar came to remind him</b> of what he had known previously. <b>And this is what</b> Rabbi Elazar was <b>saying to him: Why do I</b> need the case where he swallows <b>another half an olive-bulk? Let the Master</b> teach this ruling <b>in</b> a case where he swallows <b>the same</b> half-olive-bulk he had swallowed previously and vomited, <b>as two</b> principles <b>can be derived from</b> the ruling in <b>that</b> case: <b>We</b> can <b>learn from it that</b> the food <b>was not</b> considered to have been <b>digested</b> the first time he swallowed it, <b>and we</b> can <b>learn from it that</b> since <b>his throat derives pleasure from</b> a full <b>olive-bulk,</b> he is liable.

### Part 14
Rabbi Asi <b>was silent and did not say anything.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: Wonder of the generation, did you not say</b> this case <b>many times before Rabbi Yoḥanan, and he said to you:</b> This person is liable <b>because his throat derives pleasure from</b> a full <b>olive-bulk?</b>
