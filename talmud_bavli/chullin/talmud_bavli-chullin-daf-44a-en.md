### Part 1
And one who wishes to adopt both <b>the stringencies of Beit Shammai and the stringencies of Beit Hillel, with regard to him the verse states: “The fool walks in darkness”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:14). <b>Rather,</b> one should act <b>either in accordance with Beit Shammai,</b> following both <b>their leniencies and their stringencies, or in accordance with Beit Hillel,</b> following both <b>their leniencies and their stringencies.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara objects to the wording of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult.</b> First <b>you say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>always in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel, and then</b> you <b>teach</b> that <b>one who wishes to act in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai may do so.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the statement that a person may act as he wishes was made <b>before the Divine Voice</b> emerged and announced that the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with Beit Hillel. <b>There,</b> the statement that the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with Beit Hillel was made <b>after the Divine Voice</b> issued this ruling.

### Part 4
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>even</b> the statement that a person may act as he wishes was made <b>after the Divine Voice</b> announced that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Beit Hillel, <b>and</b> this statement <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, who says: One disregards a Divine Voice</b> that attempts to intervene in matters of <i>halakha</i>. According to him, the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel has not yet been decided.

### Part 5
The Gemara notes: <b>In any case,</b> Rava’s ruling is <b>difficult.</b> How could he rule in accordance with two contradictory stringencies in order to deem the animal a <i>tereifa</i>?

### Part 6
<b>Rav Tavut said:</b> Rava <b>acted entirely in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav. As when Rami bar Yeḥezkel came, he said: Do not listen to those principles that</b> Rav <b>Yehuda, my brother, formulated in the name of Rav.</b> Although Rav holds that a perforation of any part of the entrance of the gullet renders an animal a <i>tereifa</i>, this is not because it is a location fit for slaughter. Rather, <b>this</b> is what <b>Rav said: The Sages gave a measure</b> defining the portion of the <b>gullet</b> that is valid for slaughter. <b>By inference,</b> one learns that <b>the entrance of the gullet is not a location</b> fit for <b>slaughter. And</b> nevertheless, <b>he says</b> that a perforation <b>in any amount</b> renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 7
Since it was mentioned that the Sages gave a measure defining the portion of the gullet that is valid for slaughter, the Gemara asks: <b>How far up</b> the gullet is the upper boundary for valid slaughter? <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> It is <b>until</b> the point that there remains only <b>sufficient</b> space for <b>a hand</b> to <b>grip</b> the gullet. The Gemara asks: <b>How far down</b> is the lower boundary? <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: Until</b> the gullet <b>becomes hairy,</b> i.e., until the opening of the rumen, whose lining is hairy.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Ravina say</b> that <b>Geneiva says in the name of Rav:</b> The lowermost <b>handbreadth in the gullet, adjacent to the rumen, this is the inner rumen?</b> If so, <b>why</b> does Rav Naḥman permit slaughter until the opening of the rumen? <b>When one slaughters</b> within the bottom handbreadth, <b>he is slaughtering in the rumen,</b> and his slaughter should be invalid.

### Part 9
Rather, <b>say</b> that Rav’s statement should be amended, as follows: The uppermost <b>handbreadth in the rumen, adjacent to the gullet, this is the inner rumen,</b> which is not a valid location for slaughter. By contrast, the lowermost handbreadth of the gullet is a valid location for slaughter. And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>when Rav says</b> that the lowermost handbreadth of the gullet is considered the rumen, he is referring specifically <b>to a bull, which is especially hairy,</b> and hairs appear even within the lowermost handbreadth of the gullet itself. By contrast, in other animals, the entire lower gullet is a valid location for slaughter.

### Part 10
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>the entrance of the gullet was completely detached from the jaw,</b> the animal is <b>kosher. And the <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna also <b>taught</b> this later (54a): If <b>the lower jaw was detached</b> entirely, it is <b>kosher.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this:</b> How can Shmuel say that if the entrance of the gullet is detached the animal is kosher? <b>But isn’t there ripping of the <i>simanim</i>,</b> the gullet and the windpipe, from their place? This should render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 12
The Gemara interjects: <b>But according to Rav Pappa, the mishna</b> is <b>difficult</b> as well, since it states: If <b>the lower jaw was detached,</b> it is <b>kosher.</b> If the lower jaw is detached, the windpipe and gullet will necessarily be detached as well, since they are attached to it.

### Part 13
The Gemara responds: <b>Granted, the mishna</b> is <b>not difficult for Rav Pappa. This</b> <i>halakha</i>, that the ripping of the <i>simanim</i> renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, applies only <b>when</b> the <i>simanim</i> are <b>completely ripped</b> from the jaw. <b>That</b> statement of the mishna, that an animal whose jaw is detached is kosher, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the lower jaw <b>is severed above</b> its connection to the <b><i>simanim</i>,</b> which themselves remain connected to the remaining flesh of the jaw. <b>But</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the ripping of the <i>simanim</i> renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> is <b>difficult for Shmuel.</b> How can an animal remain kosher when the entrance of its gullet is removed, if this entails the ripping of the <i>simanim</i>?

### Part 14
The Gemara responds: <b>Do not say</b> that Shmuel deems the animal kosher if the entrance of the gullet was <b>completely</b> detached. <b>Rather, say</b> that he deems it kosher only if it was <b>mostly</b> detached.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Shmuel says: <i>Simanim</i> that were detached in their majority</b> render the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>? Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said: This</b> statement of Shmuel, that the animal is kosher even if the <i>simanim</i> are mostly detached, applies only to a case in <b>which</b> the entrance of the gullet <b>was peeled off</b> from the flesh of the jaw, such that the connected tissue is concentrated in one area. In such a case, the animal might recover. <b>There,</b> where Shmuel deems the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, he is referring to a case in <b>which</b> the <i>simanim</i> <b>were</b> forcibly <b>separated [<i>de’ippruk ipprukei</i>]</b> from the jaw and are connected only by a few discontinuous pieces of flesh. In such a case the animal cannot recover.

### Part 16
§ The mishna states: <b>Or</b> an animal with <b>a cut windpipe,</b> cut across its width, is a <i>tereifa</i>. With regard to this the Sages <b>taught: How much</b> must <b>the windpipe</b> be <b>cut</b> to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>In its majority. And how much is its majority? Rav says:</b>
