### Part 1
<b>as due to its sharpness it absorbs</b> the fat on the knife. <b>But</b> if one cut <b>a cucumber</b> with the same knife, it does not absorb the fat to the same extent. One may therefore simply <b>scrape the place of the cut</b> to remove any fat residue, <b>and</b> then one may <b>eat</b> the cucumber with <i>kutaḥ</i>.

### Part 2
Likewise, <b>turnip stalks</b> cut with such a knife are <b>permitted</b> for consumption with <i>kutaḥ</i>. But <b>chard</b> cut with such a knife is <b>prohibited</b> for consumption with <i>kutaḥ</i>, as it absorbs flavor from the knife. <b>And if one alternated between</b> cutting chard <b>and turnip</b> stalks it is <b>permitted,</b> as the turnip stalks nullify the taste of the meat in the knife.

### Part 3
§ <b>Rav Dimi inquired of Rav Naḥman: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to placing a jug of salt,</b> used to salt meat, <b>alongside a jug of <i>kamka</i>,</b> i.e., <i>kutaḥ</i>, a milk dish? Need one be concerned lest some of the <i>kutaḥ</i> fall on the salt without his knowledge and ultimately contaminate his meat? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: It is prohibited</b> to place the two jugs next to each other. Rav Dimi further inquired: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a similar case involving a jug <b>of vinegar</b> used to season meat? Need one be concerned lest the <i>kutaḥ</i> fall into the vinegar? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: It is permitted</b> to place these two jugs next to each other.

### Part 4
Rav Dimi asked: <b>And what is different</b> about the vinegar? Rav Naḥman responded: <b>When you</b> have thought <b>about it</b> long enough to <b>eat a <i>kor</i> of salt,</b> you will know the reason. The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is the reason</b> then? In <b>this</b> case of the salt, <b>the prohibited</b> substance <b>is substantive,</b> as the traces of <i>kutaḥ</i> are discernible and not nullified by the salt. <b>But</b> in <b>that</b> case of the vinegar, <b>the prohibited</b> substance <b>is not substantive,</b> since the <i>kutaḥ</i> melts away in the vinegar and will no longer impart flavor.

### Part 5
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain young bird that fell into a jug of <i>kamka</i>,</b> i.e., <i>kutaḥ</i>. <b>Rav Ḥinnana, son of Rava of</b> the city of <b>Pashronya, permitted</b> the bird. <b>Rava said</b> about this: <b>Who is wise</b> enough <b>to</b> discern reasons to <b>permit</b> the food in difficult <b>cases like this, if not Rav Ḥinnana, son of Rava of Pashronya? He maintains</b> that <b>when Shmuel said</b> that <b>a salted</b> food imparts flavor <b>like a boiling</b> food, <b>that statement</b> applies only to a food so salty <b>that it is not eaten due to its salt, but this <i>kutaḥ</i></b> can still be <b>eaten due to,</b> i.e., despite, <b>its salt.</b> Therefore, it is as if both foods are cold and unsalted, and they do not impart flavor to one another, provided one rinses the area of contact.

### Part 6
The Gemara adds: <b>And this statement</b> applies only if the bird is <b>raw, but</b> if it is <b>roasted, it requires peeling</b> to remove the outer layer, since roasting softens the meat and causes it to absorb more flavor. <b>And if it has cracks [<i>pilei</i>], it is entirely forbidden,</b> because the milk is absorbed into the cracks. <b>And if it has been flavored with spices it is</b> likewise <b>entirely forbidden,</b> because the spices soften the meat and render it absorbent.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel says: It is prohibited to eat a loaf</b> of bread <b>upon which one cut</b> unsalted roasted <b>meat,</b> since the blood expelled from the roasted meat is absorbed in the loaf. The Gemara adds: <b>And this statement</b> applies only <b>if</b> the meat <b>is ruddy</b> from the blood it contains. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>if</b> so much blood was absorbed in the loaf that <b>it passed through</b> from one side of the loaf to the other and was visible from both sides. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>if</b> the liquid emitted by the roasted meat <b>is viscous. But</b> if it is <b>runny, we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> i.e., the loaf is permitted.

### Part 8
The Gemara relates: <b>Shmuel would throw to his dog</b> such a loaf of bread that he held was prohibited. <b>Rav Huna</b> would not eat the loaf himself but <b>would</b> rather <b>give it to his attendant.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, Rav Huna’s behavior is problematic: <b>If</b> the loaf <b>is permitted, it is permitted for everyone,</b> including Rav Huna himself. And <b>if it is prohibited, then it is prohibited for everyone,</b> and he should not give it to his attendant. The Gemara explains: In fact, the loaf is permitted for consumption, and <b>Rav Huna is different, as he is of delicate constitution</b> and did not want to eat the loaf himself. The Gemara further relates: <b>Rava would eat</b> a loaf of this type, <b>and he would call</b> the red liquid <b>meat wine.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: One may not place a vessel under</b> roasting <b>meat</b> to catch the drippings of fat <b>until all the ruddiness of</b> the meat’s <b>appearance has dissipated.</b> Beforehand, though, one must be concerned that blood will fall with the drippings into the vessel, rendering the mixture and the vessel prohibited. The Gemara asks: <b>How do we know</b> when all the meat’s redness has disappeared? <b>Mar Zutra said in the name of Rav Pappa: As soon as its smoke rises,</b> one can be sure that all the blood has been expelled from the meat.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Ashi objects to this: But perhaps the underside</b> of the meat, which is closest to the coals, has been fully <b>roasted,</b> but its <b>upper</b> part is still <b>not roasted</b> and still expels blood at this stage. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said:</b> One who wishes to collect the drippings <b>has no remedy except</b> to <b>place two lumps of salt in it,</b> i.e., one in the receptacle under the meat and one on top, in the meat itself.
