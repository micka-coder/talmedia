### Part 1
<b>the location of the crevice. And where is the location of the crevice?</b> This is a reference <b>to the white</b> matter <b>under the loins. Rav Neḥunya said: I asked all the authorities on <i>tereifot</i> of the West, and they said to me: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rakhish bar Pappa</b> in the name of Rav that a diseased kidney renders an animal a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>but the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Avira</b> that a perforated spleen renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 2
The Gemara adds: And <b>even</b> with regard to the opinion <b>of Rav Avira, we said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with his opinion <b>only</b> if the spleen was perforated <b>in its narrow,</b> lower <b>end, but</b> if it was perforated <b>in its thick,</b> upper <b>end,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And</b> even if it was perforated in its thick end, <b>if</b> it was not perforated completely and a layer of the spleen <b>as thick as a gold dinar remains</b> intact, the animal is <b>kosher.</b>

### Part 3
§ <b>They say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>Any</b> injury <b>that renders</b> an animal <b>unfit</b> for consumption when occurring <b>in the lung is kosher</b> when occurring <b>in the kidney.</b> For example, <b>a perforation</b> renders an animal <b>unfit</b> when occurring <b>in the lung</b> (see 42a), <b>but</b> the animal <b>is kosher</b> if it occurs <b>in the kidney. And</b> it follows that <b>all the more so, where</b> an animal <b>is kosher</b> despite an injury <b>in the lung,</b> it will remain <b>kosher</b> despite a similar injury <b>in the kidney.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Tanḥuma objects to this: And is this</b> an established <b>principle? But</b> what about a case of <b>pus, where</b> the animal is <b>kosher</b> if it occurs <b>in the lung and unfit</b> for consumption if it occurs <b>in the kidney? And</b> what about <b>clear fluid, which is kosher</b> both <b>here and there,</b> i.e., whether occurring in the lungs or the kidney? <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: Are</b> you <b>comparing <i>tereifot</i> to one another? One cannot say with regard to <i>tereifot</i>: This is similar to that, as one cuts</b> an animal <b>from here,</b> in one place, <b>and it dies,</b> while <b>one cuts it from there,</b> in another place, <b>and it lives.</b> Certain injuries may compromise the kidney but not the lung, or vice versa.

### Part 5
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>clear fluid</b> found in the lungs or kidney, which is <b>kosher, we said</b> so <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the fluid was <b>unclouded, but</b> if it was <b>clouded,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And even when</b> the fluid was <b>unclouded, we said</b> the animal is kosher <b>only</b> if the fluid <b>is not fetid, but if it is fetid,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara continues to discuss cases of <i>tereifot</i> due to the kidneys: With regard to <b>a kidney that shrank, in small</b> animals, such as sheep, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if it shrank <b>until</b> the size <b>of a bean; in large</b> animals, such as cattle, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if it shrank <b>until</b> the size <b>of an intermediate-</b>sized <b>grape.</b>

### Part 7
§ The mishna states: If the animal’s <b>lower jaw was removed,</b> it remains kosher. With regard to this, <b>Rabbi Zeira says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <b>only when</b> the animal <b>is able to live by placing</b> food in its mouth <b>or stuffing</b> it down its throat. <b>But</b> if <b>it cannot live by placing or stuffing</b> food into it, it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 8
§ The mishna states: If <b>its womb [<i>em</i>] was removed,</b> the animal remains kosher. A Sage <b>taught: The <i>em</i> is</b> synonymous with the <b><i>tarpaḥat</i>, and it is</b> synonymous with the <b><i>shalpuḥit</i>.</b>

### Part 9
§ The mishna states: <b>Or</b> if its lung <b>shriveled [<i>ḥaruta</i>] by the hand of Heaven,</b> the animal is <b>kosher. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which is a <i>ḥaruta</i>?</b> It is <b>any</b> animal <b>whose lung shriveled.</b> If this occurred <b>by the hand of Heaven,</b> e.g., if the lung shriveled from fright of thunder and lightning, the animal is <b>kosher.</b> But if it happened <b>by the hands of a person</b> who frightened it, e.g., if it witnessed another animal being slaughtered, it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Even</b> if the lung shriveled <b>by the hands of any creature,</b> e.g., if it was frightened by a lion’s roar.

### Part 10
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Is</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar referring to the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, in which case the statement is <b>a leniency,</b> and even the roar of a lion is considered by the hand of Heaven? <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it is referring to the latter clause, and</b> the statement is <b>a stringency,</b> and a lung shriveled by the hand of any creature renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>?

### Part 11
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as it is taught</b> in the above <i>baraita</i>: A lung that was <b>shriveled by the hands of a person</b> renders the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Even by the hands of any creature.</b> Evidently, Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar is referring to the latter clause.

### Part 12
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana was walking in the desert,</b> and <b>he found certain rams whose lungs were shriveled. He came and asked</b> in <b>the study hall</b> how one can determine the cause of the shriveling. The Sages <b>said to him: In the summer, bring white vessels and fill them with cold water and set</b> the lungs in them <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period. If they go back</b> to appearing <b>healthy,</b> i.e., if they expand, one knows that <b>it was by the hand of Heaven and</b> the animals are <b>kosher; but if</b> they do <b>not</b> expand, the animals are <b><i>tereifa</i>. In the winter, bring dark vessels and fill them with tepid water, and set</b> the lungs in them <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period. If</b> they <b>go back</b> to appearing <b>healthy,</b> they are <b>kosher; but if not,</b> they are <b><i>tereifa</i>.</b>

### Part 13
§ The mishna states: In the case of an animal <b>whose hide was removed,</b> Rabbi Meir deems it kosher, and the Rabbis deem it a <i>tereifa</i>. With regard to this, <b>the Sages taught:</b> In the case of an animal <b>whose hide was removed, Rabbi Meir deems it kosher, and the Rabbis deem it</b> a <i>tereifa</i> and <b>unfit</b> for consumption. <b>And Elazar the scribe and Yoḥanan ben Gudgeda already testified</b> before the Sages <b>with regard to</b> an animal <b>whose hide was removed that</b> it is <b>unfit</b> for consumption. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Rabbi Meir retracted</b> his statement.

### Part 14
The Gemara objects: <b>By inference,</b> one may conclude that <b>according to Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, Rabbi Meir</b> initially <b>disagreed with regard to</b> an animal <b>whose hide was removed. But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Rabbi Meir and the Sages did not disagree with regard to</b> an animal <b>whose hide was removed,</b> and all agree <b>that it is unfit</b> for consumption. <b>And Rabbi Oshaya, son of Rabbi Yehuda the spice merchant, already testified before Rabbi Akiva in the name of Rabbi Tarfon with regard to</b> an animal <b>whose hide was removed that it is unfit</b> for consumption. <b>And if</b> a piece of hide the same size <b>as a <i>sela</i> remained</b> intact, the animal is <b>kosher.</b> The Gemara explains the objection: The phrase: Did not disagree, indicates that Rabbi Meir never disagreed with the Sages. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>Did not disagree?</b> It means that <b>Rabbi Meir did not stand</b> firm <b>in his disagreement</b> and retracted.

### Part 15
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said: If</b> a piece of hide the same size <b>as a <i>sela</i> remained</b> intact <b>in</b> the animal, it is <b>kosher.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Where</b> must this piece of hide be? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The piece of hide must be <b>along the entire spine.</b>

### Part 16
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does Shmuel mean <b>that</b> it is kosher if <b>a long and thin</b> strip of hide remains along the spine, such <b>that when</b> one <b>combines its</b> area, it will <b>constitute</b> the same size <b>as a <i>sela</i>? Or perhaps</b> it is kosher only if the remaining hide is <b>the width of a <i>sela</i> along the entire spine?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from that <b>which Rabbi Nehorai explained in the name of Shmuel:</b> It must be <b>the width of a <i>sela</i> along the entire spine.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says:</b> There must be a piece of hide the size of a <i>sela</i> on <b>the tips of</b> all <b>segments</b> of the spine and on the tips of the femur and tibia. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Antigonus says in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yannai:</b> The piece of hide must be the width of a <i>sela</i> at <b>the place of its navel.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Rabbi Yannai, son of Rabbi Yishmael, raises a dilemma:</b> If all the hide covering <b>the place of the spine was removed, but all of</b> the remaining hide <b>was intact,</b> or if the hide covering <b>the place of its navel was removed but all of</b> the remaining hide <b>was intact,</b> or if the hide covering all the <b>tips of the segments were removed but all of</b> the remaining hide <b>was intact, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 19
<b>Rav says: Any</b> portion of <b>the hide</b> that is the size of a <i>sela</i> <b>saves</b> an animal <b>whose hide was removed</b> from becoming a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>except for the hide of the hooves,</b> which is not considered hide. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even the hide of the hooves saves</b> it.

### Part 20
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rabbi Asi asked Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> With regard to the <b>hide of the hooves, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does it <b>save</b> an animal <b>whose hide was removed</b> if a piece of it the size of a <i>sela</i> remains? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: It saves</b> the animal. Rabbi Asi <b>said to him:</b> But didn’t <b>you teach us, our teacher,</b> the following mishna (122a): <b>These</b> are the entities <b>whose hide is like their flesh</b> in terms of halakhic status, in that it transmits ritual impurity…the skin of a head of a young calf, and <b>the hide of the hooves?</b> Evidently, the hide of the hooves is considered like flesh and not true skin. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Do not trouble me</b> by invoking that mishna, <b>as I teach it in the singular.</b> Only according to one Sage, Rabbi Shimon, is the hide of the hooves not true skin; according to the Rabbis, it is considered true skin.

### Part 21
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who slaughters a burnt offering</b> with intent <b>to burn an olive-bulk of the hide beneath the tail outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> i.e., outside the Temple courtyard, renders the offering <b>unfit, but there is no</b> liability for <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>]</b> for one who partakes of the offering. If he had intent to burn it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> then it is rendered <b><i>piggul</i>, and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> partaking of <b>it.</b> This <i>halakha</i> usually applies to an offering’s flesh but not its hide. Since the hide beneath the tail is soft, it is treated like part of the flesh. This is the opinion of the Rabbis.

### Part 22
<b>Eliezer ben Yehuda of Evlayim said in the name of Rabbi Ya’akov, and so says Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda of Ikos in the name of Rabbi Shimon: Whether the hide of the hooves, or the hide of the head of a young calf, or the hide beneath the tail, or any</b> hide <b>that the Sages listed with regard to ritual impurity</b> under the heading: <b>These</b> are the entities <b>whose hide is like their flesh</b> in terms of halakhic status,
