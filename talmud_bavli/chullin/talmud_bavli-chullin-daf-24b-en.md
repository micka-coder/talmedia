### Part 1
<b>“It came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard”</b> (II Chronicles 5:13). This indicates that the Levites must be capable of singing in one voice, and one who is unable to do so is unfit for service.

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the priest is eligible for service <b>until he ages.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Until when,</b> i.e., what is the definition of aging in this context? <b>Rabbi Ela says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: Until</b> his hands and feet begin to <b>tremble.</b>

### Part 3
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Mikvaot</i> 8:4): With regard to <b>one who experienced a seminal emission who</b> then <b>immersed</b> in a ritual bath <b>and did not urinate</b> before immersing, <b>when he urinates he is ritually impure,</b> because residue of the semen remain in his body and was discharged with the urine, rendering him impure. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: In</b> the case of <b>an ill</b> person <b>and an elderly</b> person, he is <b>ritually impure; in</b> the case of <b>a young</b> person <b>and a healthy</b> person, he is <b>ritually pure,</b> as the semen was presumably discharged in its entirety at the outset.

### Part 4
<b>Until when</b> is one considered <b>a young</b> person? <b>Rabbi Ela says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: Anyone who</b> is able to <b>stand on one of his legs and remove his shoe or put on his shoe</b> is considered young. <b>They said about Rabbi Ḥanina that he was eighty years old and would stand on one of his legs and remove his shoe or put on his shoe. Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The <b>hot water and oil that my mother smeared on me in my youth benefited me in my old age.</b>

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If <b>one’s beard</b> is <b>fully</b> grown, <b>he is fit to be appointed an emissary of the community</b> for various matters, <b>and to descend before the ark</b> as a prayer leader, <b>and to lift his hands</b> for the Priestly Benediction. <b>From when</b> is a priest <b>fit for</b> Temple <b>service?</b> It is <b>from</b> the time he reaches puberty and <b>grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that he is not fit for Temple service <b>until he is twenty</b> years of <b>age.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? The reason is <b>as it is written: “And appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to oversee of the work of the House of the Lord”</b> (Ezra 3:8). <b>And</b> what does <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i> hold? He holds that <b>to oversee is different</b> and requires an older priest.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what proof can be cited from this verse with regard to priests; <b>isn’t that verse written with regard to Levites?</b> The Gemara answers: It is understood <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: In twenty-four places</b> in the Bible the <b>priests are called Levites. And this is one of those</b> verses: <b>“And the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok”</b> (Ezekiel 44:15). The verse in Ezra is another one of the verses.

### Part 8
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Any man of your descendants throughout their generations</b> that has a blemish shall not approach to offer the bread of his God” (Leviticus 21:17); <b>from here Rabbi Elazar says: A minor</b> priest is <b>unfit for</b> Temple <b>service, even</b> if he is <b>unblemished,</b> as he is not a man. <b>From when</b> is <b>he fit for service? From</b> the time he reaches puberty and <b>grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs. But his brethren the priests do not allow him to perform the service until he is twenty</b> years of <b>age.</b>

### Part 9
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say: This is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and he is</b> of the opinion that there is <b>no disqualification</b> for one between puberty and twenty years of age <b>even by rabbinic law.</b> The other priests simply do not allow priests of that age to perform the Temple service <i>ab initio</i>. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>is of</b> the opinion that there is <b>disqualification by rabbinic law</b> in that case, <b>and this</b> statement in the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and</b> they hold that <b>it is <i>ab initio</i> that</b> one may <b>not</b> perform the service, <b>but after the fact, his service is valid.</b>

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> That which is <b>ritually pure in an earthenware vessel</b> is <b>ritually impure in all the</b> other types of <b>vessels;</b> that which is <b>ritually pure in all the</b> other types of <b>vessels</b> is <b>ritually impure in an earthenware vessel.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> explaining the mishna: If a primary source of ritual impurity fell into the <b>airspace of an earthenware vessel</b> the vessel is <b>ritually impure, and</b> if it fell on <b>its outer side,</b> the vessel is <b>ritually pure.</b> If a primary source of ritual impurity fell into the <b>airspace of all the</b> other types of <b>vessels,</b> the vessels are <b>ritually pure, and</b> if it fell on <b>their outer side,</b> they are <b>ritually impure. It is found</b> that that which is <b>ritually pure in an earthenware vessel</b> is <b>ritually impure in all the</b> other <b>vessels,</b> and that which is <b>ritually pure in all the</b> other <b>vessels</b> is <b>ritually impure in an earthenware vessel.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> based on the verse: “And every earthenware vessel into which [<i>tokho</i>] any of them falls, whatever is in it [<i>tokho</i>] shall be impure, and it you shall break” (Leviticus 11:33); if an impure item fell <b>“in it [<i>tokho</i>],” and even</b> in a case <b>where</b> the impure item <b>did not come into contact</b> with the vessel, the vessel becomes impure.

### Part 13
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Do you say</b> that it is impure <b>even if</b> the impure item <b>did not come into contact</b> with the vessel, <b>or</b> perhaps <b>it is</b> impure <b>only if it did come into contact</b> with the vessel? <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Avtolemos says: <i>Tokho</i> is stated</b> with regard <b>to transmitting impurity</b> to food in its airspace, as it is stated: “Whatever is in it [<i>tokho</i>] shall be impure,” <b>and <i>tokho</i> is stated</b> with regard <b>to becoming impure,</b> as it is stated: “Into which [<i>tokho</i>] any of them falls”; <b>just as</b> in the case of <b><i>tokho</i> that is stated</b> with regard <b>to transmitting impurity</b> to food in its airspace, the food is impure <b>even if</b> the impure item <b>did not come into contact</b> with the vessel, <b>so too,</b> in the case of <b><i>tokho</i> that is stated</b> with regard <b>to</b> the vessel <b>becoming impure,</b> the vessel is impure <b>even if</b> the impure item <b>did not come into contact</b> with it.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to rendering food impure in its airspace, <b>from where do we</b> derive that the food becomes impure even if it did not come into contact with the impure vessel? <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: The Torah testified about an earthenware vessel</b>
