### Part 1
<b>And the details</b> of the mitzvot, e.g., the particulars of the sacrificial process, were said to Moses at a later time <b>in the Tent of Meeting. And Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Both <b>general statements and the details</b> of mitzvot <b>were said at Sinai and</b> later <b>repeated in the Tent of Meeting, and</b> reiterated <b>a third time</b> by Moses to the Jewish people <b>in the plains of Moab,</b> as recorded in the book of Deuteronomy. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that Rabbi Yishmael holds that <b>the burnt</b>-offering <b>that the Jewish people sacrificed in the desert</b> at Mount Sinai <b>was the daily burnt</b>-offering, rather than the burnt-offering of an individual, the following question arises:

### Part 2
<b>Is there any</b> offering <b>that initially did not require skinning and cutting</b> into pieces, as these details of the daily burnt-offering were transmitted later in the Tent of Meeting, <b>and ultimately,</b> when these details were added, the offering <b>required skinning and cutting?</b> It is not plausible that the details of a mitzva would change over time. Therefore, it is clear that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael the Jews did not sacrifice the daily burnt-offering before the giving of the Torah, which means that the burnt-offering sacrificed at Mount Sinai must have been a burnt-offering of appearance.

### Part 3
The Gemara cites the source for the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“It is a daily burnt-</b>offering, <b>which was performed on Mount Sinai”</b> (Numbers 28:6). <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The details of <b>its performance were said at Sinai, but it itself was not sacrificed</b> until the Tabernacle was erected. This indicates that the offering brought on Mount Sinai was a burnt-offering of appearance.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Akiva says: It was sacrificed</b> when they stood at Mount Sinai <b>and</b> its sacrifice <b>never ceased.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>how do I uphold,</b> i.e., how does Rabbi Akiva explain the following verse: <b>“Did you bring to Me sacrifices and offerings for forty years in the wilderness, house of Israel?”</b> (Amos 5:25). This verse indicates that they did not sacrifice these offerings.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>The tribe of Levi, which did not commit</b> the sin of <b>idol worship, sacrificed it</b> from their own funds. Since the rest of the Jewish people did not contribute the funds for the daily burnt-offering, it is as though they did not sacrifice this offering. This concludes the list of sources of the opinions of those Sages who hold that the daily burnt-offering was not sacrificed at Mount Sinai, and the offering that was sacrificed there was a burnt-offering of appearance.

### Part 6
The Gemara cites the sources for the opinions that the daily burnt-offering was sacrificed at Mount Sinai. <b>Beit Hillel: That which we said. Rabbi Akiva: Also that which we said,</b> in the aforementioned dispute with Rabbi Elazar. <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: The Jewish people were commanded</b> to perform <b>three mitzvot when they ascended</b> to the Temple <b>for</b> the pilgrimage <b>Festivals:</b> The burnt-offering of <b>appearance, and the Festival peace</b>-offering, <b>and the</b> peace-offering of <b>rejoicing.</b>

### Part 7
Rabbi Yosei HaGelili continues. <b>There is</b> an element <b>of the</b> burnt-offering of <b>appearance that is not</b> present <b>in</b> the other <b>two; there is</b> an element <b>of the Festival peace</b>-offering <b>that is not</b> present <b>in</b> the other <b>two;</b> and <b>there is</b> an element <b>of the</b> peace-offering of <b>rejoicing that is not</b> present <b>in</b> the other <b>two.</b> He elaborates: <b>There is</b> an element <b>of the</b> burnt-offering of <b>appearance that is not</b> present <b>in</b> the other <b>two, as the</b> burnt-offering of <b>appearance</b> goes <b>up entirely to God, which is not so with regard to</b> the other <b>two,</b> as the majority portion of the other two offerings is eaten.

### Part 8
<b>There is</b> an element <b>of the Festival peace</b>-offering <b>that is not</b> present <b>in</b> the other <b>two, as the Festival peace</b>-offering <b>existed before the speech</b> of God at Mount Sinai, <b>which is not so with regard to</b> the other <b>two.</b> Finally, <b>there is</b> an element <b>of the</b> peace-offering of <b>rejoicing that is not</b> present <b>in</b> the other <b>two, as the</b> peace-offering of <b>rejoicing is performed by</b> both <b>men and by women, which is not so with regard to</b> the other <b>two.</b> This shows that Rabbi Yosei HaGelili holds that the burnt-offering of appearance was not sacrificed at Mount Sinai, which means that the burnt-offering mentioned in that context must have been the daily burnt-offering.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Abaye’s explanation. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Yishmael, what is the reason</b> that <b>you established</b> his ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai</b> that the burnt-offering sacrificed at Mount Sinai was a burnt-offering of appearance? The explanation for his opinion was: <b>If it enters your mind</b> that the <b>burnt</b>-offering <b>the Jewish people sacrificed in the desert was a daily burnt</b>-offering, <b>is there any</b> offering <b>that initially did not require skinning and cutting</b> into pieces <b>and ultimately required skinning and cutting</b> into pieces?

### Part 10
<b>But wasn’t</b> it <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili who said: The burnt</b>-offering <b>that the Jewish people sacrificed in the desert</b> at Mount Sinai <b>was the daily burnt</b>-offering? Nevertheless, he holds that <b>initially</b> it <b>did not require skinning and cutting</b> into pieces, <b>and ultimately</b> it <b>required skinning and cutting</b> into pieces.

### Part 11
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: The burnt-</b>offering <b>that the Jewish people sacrificed in the desert did not require skinning and cutting</b> into pieces, <b>because</b> the requirement of <b>skinning and cutting</b> offerings applied <b>only from</b> the time God commanded this mitzva in <b>the Tent of Meeting and onward.</b> The Gemara concludes: There is no clear evidence as to what Rabbi Yishmael actually maintains in this regard, and therefore one should <b>delete Rabbi Yishmael from</b> this list <b>here,</b> i.e., the list of those who hold that the burnt-offering sacrificed in the desert was a burnt-offering of appearance.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Ḥisda raises a dilemma: This verse, how is it written,</b> i.e., how should it be understood? Should the following verse be read as two separate halves, with the first part consisting of: <b>“And he sent the young men of the children of Israel, and they sacrificed burnt-</b>offerings<b>”</b> (Exodus 24:5), which were <b>sheep;</b> and the second part consisting of the rest of the verse: <b>“And they sacrificed peace-</b>offerings <b>of bulls to the Lord,”</b> i.e., these peace-offerings alone were bulls? <b>Or perhaps both of these</b> were <b>bulls,</b> as the term: “Bulls,” refers both to the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the practical difference</b> between the two readings? <b>Mar Zutra said:</b> The practical difference is with regard <b>to the punctuation of</b> the cantillation <b>notes,</b> whether there should be a break in the verse after: “And they sacrificed burnt-offerings,” indicating that these offerings consisted of sheep; or whether it should read: “And they sacrificed burnt-offerings and sacrificed peace-offerings of bulls,” as one clause.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said</b> that the difference between these two readings of the verse is <b>for one who says</b> in the form of a vow: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt</b>-offering <b>like the burnt</b>-offering <b>that the Jewish people sacrificed in the desert</b> at Mount Sinai. <b>What</b> is he required to bring? <b>Were they bulls</b> or <b>were they sheep?</b> The Gemara does not provide an answer and states that the question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 15
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Pe’a</i> 1:1): <b>These are</b> the mitzvot <b>that have no measure:</b>
