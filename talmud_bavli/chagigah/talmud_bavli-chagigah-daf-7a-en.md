### Part 1
<b>Produce in the corner of the field</b> that must be left unharvested, <b>which is given to the poor</b> [<b><i>pe’a</i></b>]; <b>and the first fruits,</b> which are brought to the Temple; <b>and the appearance</b> in the Temple on the pilgrim Festivals; <b>and acts of loving-kindness; and Torah study.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: We thought to say that the</b> mitzva of <b>appearance</b> in the Temple <b>does not have a maximum measure, but it does have a minimum measure; until Rabbi Oshaya the Distinguished came and taught: The</b> mitzva of <b>appearance has neither a maximum nor a minimum measure. However, the Rabbis say:</b> The burnt-offering of <b>appearance</b> must be worth one <b>silver <i>ma’a</i> and the Festival peace</b>-offering <b>two silver</b> coins.

### Part 3
§ <b>What is the</b> mitzva of <b>appearance</b> to which this mishna is referring? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is the mitzva of <b>the appearance of</b> one’s <b>face in</b> the Temple <b>courtyard.</b> One may appear in the Temple as often as he likes over the course of a Festival. <b>And Reish Lakish said:</b> It is <b>the appearance of</b> one’s <b>face</b> in the Temple <b>with an offering.</b> There is no measure in this regard, as every time one appears in the Temple during a Festival he must bring an offering.

### Part 4
The Gemara explains: <b>On the main</b> i.e., on the first, day of <b>the pilgrimage Festival, everyone agrees that the appearance of</b> one’s <b>face</b> must be accompanied <b>by an offering. When they disagree,</b> it is with regard <b>to the rest of the days of the pilgrimage Festival,</b> i.e., whether or not one who appears must sacrifice an offering. Furthermore, <b>anywhere,</b> i.e., in any case <b>that one comes and brings</b> an offering, <b>everyone agrees that we accept it from him. When they disagree,</b> it is <b>when he comes and does not bring</b> an offering. Is this man obligated to bring an offering or not?

### Part 5
The Gemara explains <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds</b> that the mitzva is merely <b>the appearance of</b> one’s <b>face in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b> Therefore, one <b>doesn’t need to bring</b> an offering <b>whenever he comes</b> to the Temple. <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that the mitzva is <b>the appearance of</b> one’s <b>face with an offering,</b> which means that <b>whenever one comes he must bring</b> an offering with him.

### Part 6
<b>Reish Lakish raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> The verse states: “Three times you shall keep a feast for Me in the year…<b>and none shall appear before Me empty-handed”</b> (Exodus 23:14–15). This verse indicates that one must bring an offering whenever he appears in the Temple. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> That obligation applies only <b>on the main</b> day of <b>the pilgrimage Festival,</b> but not on the rest of the Festival days.

### Part 7
Reish Lakish <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And none shall appear before Me empty-handed.”</b> This teaches that Festival pilgrims must appear <b>with animal offerings.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that they must appear <b>with animal offerings, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only with bird</b>-offerings <b>or meal</b>-offerings? <b>And it is</b> possible to determine the answer <b>by logical derivation:</b> It <b>is stated</b> that one must bring <b>a Festival peace</b>-offering <b>for a commoner</b> to eat, <b>and</b> it <b>is stated</b> that one must bring a burnt-offering of <b>appearance,</b> which is <b>for God. Just as the Festival peace</b>-offering <b>that is stated for a commoner</b> is referring to <b>animal offerings, so too,</b> the burnt-offering of <b>appearance that is stated</b> to be sacrificed wholly <b>for God</b> is referring to <b>animal offerings.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And what are</b> these <b>animal offerings</b> that the Festival pilgrims sacrifice to God? <b>Burnt</b>-offerings. Do <b>you say</b> that they are <b>burnt</b>-offerings, <b>or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> that they are <b>peace</b>-offerings? <b>And it is</b> possible to determine the answer <b>by logical derivation:</b> It <b>is stated</b> that one must bring a <b>Festival peace</b>-offering <b>for a commoner, and</b> it <b>is stated</b> that one must bring a burnt-offering of <b>appearance,</b> which is solely <b>for God. Just as the Festival peace</b>-offering <b>that is stated for a commoner</b> is referring to an offering that is <b>fitting for him</b> to eat, i.e., a peace-offering, <b>so too,</b> the burnt-offering of <b>appearance that is stated</b> to be <b>for God</b> is referring to an offering that is <b>fitting for Him,</b> i.e., a burnt-offering, which is entirely consumed on the altar.

### Part 9
<b>And similarly,</b> one can learn <b>by logical derivation that your table should not be full</b> of meat <b>while your Master’s table,</b> i.e., the altar, <b>is empty.</b> This indicates that one must sacrifice a burnt-offering whenever one appears in the Temple, which contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan. Rabbi Yoḥanan again <b>said to him:</b> This obligation applies only <b>on the main</b> day of <b>the pilgrimage Festival.</b>

### Part 10
Reish Lakish <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: Three times a year the Jewish people were commanded to ascend on the pilgrimage Festival: On Passover, on <i>Shavuot</i>, and on <i>Sukkot</i>. They may not appear partially,</b> i.e., only some of the people, <b>because it is stated: “All your males”</b> (Exodus 23:17). <b>And they may not appear empty-handed, because it is stated: “And none shall appear before Me empty-handed”</b> (Exodus 23:15). Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> That too is referring to <b>the main</b> day of <b>the pilgrimage Festival.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “All your males shall appear.” Although the verse as written can be read: <b>“Will see [<i>yireh</i>],”</b> it is actually read: <b>“Shall be seen [<i>yera’e</i>].”</b> The <i>baraita</i> derives that <b>just as I,</b> God, come to see you <b>for free,</b> as He has no obligation to bring an offering when He comes to see us in the Temple, <b>so too, you</b> may come to see Me in the Temple <b>for free,</b> i.e., there is no requirement to bring an offering. The Gemara accepts this objection and therefore proceeds to explain the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish in a different manner.

### Part 12
<b>Rather,</b> with regard to <b>anywhere that one comes</b> to the Temple courtyard after the initial time on the first day of the Festival <b>and he does not bring</b> an offering, <b>everyone agrees that one enters, appears, and exits</b> without having to bring an offering. <b>When they disagree</b> it is in a case <b>where one comes and brings</b> an offering.

### Part 13
The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says</b> that the appearance mentioned in the mishna is referring to <b>the appearance of</b> one’s <b>face in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> maintains that <b>it is</b> this <b>appearance</b> itself <b>that has no</b> maximum <b>measure,</b> i.e., one may appear as often as he wishes without an offering. However, <b>there is</b> a maximum <b>measure,</b> i.e., a limited number <b>of offerings,</b> that one may bring; only one burnt-offering of appearance per Festival. <b>And Reish Lakish said: The appearance of</b> one’s <b>face</b> means <b>with an offering, as even offerings have no</b> maximum <b>measure.</b> One may bring as many offerings during the Festival as he wishes.

### Part 14
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Reish Lakish: <b>“Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,</b> lest he be sated with you, and hate you” (Proverbs 25:17). It can be inferred from this verse that one should not bring extra gifts, i.e., offerings, to God. The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> the verse is referring <b>to sin</b>-offerings <b>and guilt</b>-offerings, i.e., it is better not to sin in the first place.

### Part 15
This explanation is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Levi, as Rabbi Levi raised a contradiction</b> between two verses. <b>It is written: “Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,” and it is written: “I will come into Your house with burnt</b>-offerings, I will perform for You my vows” (Psalms 66:13). Rabbi Levi explained: This is <b>not difficult; here,</b> the verse is referring <b>to sin-</b>offerings <b>and guilt</b>-offerings, <b>and there,</b> it is referring <b>to burnt</b>-offerings <b>and peace</b>-offerings, concerning which one may bring as many as he likes.

### Part 16
<b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house.” The verse is speaking of sin</b>-offerings <b>and guilt</b>-offerings. Do <b>you say</b> it is referring <b>to sin</b>-offerings <b>and guilt</b>-offerings, <b>or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> referring <b>to burnt</b>-offerings <b>and peace</b>-offerings? <b>When it says: “I will come into Your house with burnt</b>-offerings, <b>I will perform for You my vows,” burnt</b>-offerings <b>and peace</b>-offerings <b>are mentioned,</b> as these are more pleasant to sacrifice to God. <b>How</b> then <b>do I uphold</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house”? The verse is speaking of sin</b>-offerings <b>and guilt</b>-offerings.

### Part 17
§ Earlier the <i>baraita</i> taught: The people <b>may not appear partially,</b> as the verse states: “All your males” (Exodus 23:17). <b>Rav Yosef thought to say: One who has ten sons</b> should <b>not let five ascend now and</b> the other <b>five tomorrow.</b> Rather, they must all ascend to the Temple together.
