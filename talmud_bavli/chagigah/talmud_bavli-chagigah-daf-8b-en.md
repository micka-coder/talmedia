### Part 1
This teaches that eating <b>those</b> animals <b>from which the Festival peace-</b>offering <b>may come,</b> i.e., sheep and cattle, is a fulfillment of the mitzva of rejoicing. This <b>excludes these,</b> i.e., bird-offerings and meal-offerings, <b>from which the Festival peace-</b>offering <b>may not come.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> There is no need to derive this <i>halakha</i> from “And you shall rejoice in your feast” by explaining that the word feast is referring to the Festival peace-offering. Rather, this <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived</b> simply <b>from</b> the phrase <b>“And you shall rejoice.”</b> This <b>excludes those</b> bird-offerings and meal-offerings <b>that do not have</b> an element of <b>rejoicing,</b> as the joy of eating is provided only by animal meat.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rav Ashi do with</b> the phrase: <b>“In your feast”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> phrase comes to teach <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Daniel bar Ketina. As Rav Daniel bar Ketina said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not marry a woman on</b> the <b>intermediate days of the Festival? As it is stated: “And you shall rejoice in your feast,”</b> indicating that one should rejoice only in your feast <b>and not with your wife.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who has many eaters,</b> i.e., members of his household, <b>and a small</b> amount of <b>property, may bring many peace-</b>offerings <b>and few burnt-</b>offerings, so he can feed the members of his household with the peace-offerings. If one has <b>much property and few eaters, he</b> should <b>bring many burnt-</b>offerings <b>and few peace-</b>offerings.

### Part 5
<b>If</b> both <b>these and those,</b> his property and the members of his household, <b>are few, with regard to this</b> individual <b>it is stated</b> in the mishna (2a) that the Sages established the smallest amount of one <b>silver <i>ma’a</i></b> for the burnt-offering of appearance in the Temple and <b>two silver</b> coins for the Festival peace-offerings. <b>If both</b> his eaters and his property <b>are many, with regard to this</b> individual <b>it is stated: “Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the Lord your God, which He has given you”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:17).

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement that one who has many eaters and a small amount of property may bring many peace-offerings, the Gemara asks: <b>From where can he bring many peace-</b>offerings? <b>He does not have</b> much property. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: He combines</b> his property with the second-tithe money <b>and brings a large bull.</b> In this way he will have a lot of meat from the peace-offering. <b>Rav Sheshet said to him:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one may combine an animal with</b> another <b>animal.</b>

### Part 7
Since Rav Sheshet’s objection is unclear, the Gemara asks: <b>What is he saying to</b> Rav Ḥisda? <b>If we say</b> that <b>he was saying to him as follows: They said</b> that <b>one may</b> only <b>combine an animal with</b> another <b>animal, but one</b> may <b>not</b> combine <b>money with</b> other <b>money</b> to purchase one large bull, then <b>let him</b> simply <b>say: One may not combine money with</b> other <b>money. Rather, this is what he said to him:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one may even combine an animal with</b> another <b>animal.</b> Why did you, Rav Ḥisda, limit him to the purchase of one large animal? Why not also suggest that this individual may bring other animals from second-tithe money?

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Rav Sheshet say this? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥizkiya,</b> who said that one may combine only one animal with another animal, <b>and not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who said that one may combine only money with other money.

### Part 9
<b>And if you would say: It is the <i>amora’im</i> who disagree,</b> whereas <b>the <i>baraitot</i></b> that were cited in support of their opinions <b>do not disagree and</b> therefore Rav Sheshet may present his own opinion on the matter, this cannot be the case, as the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: The first eating</b> must come <b>from non-sacred</b> property. In other words, the first animal one eats must come entirely from non-sacred property, and combining is permitted only for the second animal. This indicates that although one may combine an additional animal with that first one, one may not combine money with other money to purchase even one animal.

### Part 10
The Gemara explains. <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>The first eating?</b> This means that when one combines non-sacred money with second-tithe money, <b>the monetary</b> value <b>of</b> the required <b>measure</b> of the <b>first eating</b> from the offering must come <b>from non-sacred</b> funds. However, the remaining value of that animal may come from second-tithe funds. Therefore, according to the opinion of Rav Sheshet, one may combine an animal with another animal, i.e., by purchasing two separate animals, one from non-sacred funds and one from second-tithe money. Another option is to purchase one animal with combined funds, provided that the first eating is from non-sacred funds.

### Part 11
§ <b>Ulla said</b> that <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> If one <b>separated ten animals for</b> the purpose of <b>his Festival peace-</b>offering, and <b>he sacrificed five</b> of them <b>on the first</b> day of <b>the Festival, he may return and sacrifice</b> the remaining <b>five on the second day of the Festival,</b> or on any of the other days. There is no concern for the prohibition of: “You shall not add” (Deuteronomy 13:1), as though he were celebrating the first day twice, because the remaining offerings merely complete the first day’s offerings. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Since he stopped</b> after the first five offerings on the day on which he first brought the Festival peace-offerings, <b>he may no longer sacrifice</b> the remaining animals on the other days, as that would be considered celebrating an extra day.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Abba said: And</b> these <i>amora’im</i> <b>do not disagree,</b> as they are referring to different circumstances. <b>Here,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan is speaking of a case <b>where one did not specify</b> when he intended to sacrifice these offerings, and therefore it is assumed that he meant to sacrifice them all on the first day. <b>There,</b> Reish Lakish is referring to a case <b>where one explicitly</b> said at the outset that he intended to bring them on all the days of the Festival (Rabbeinu Ḥananel).

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>this</b> case where he <b>did not specify, what are the circumstances? If we say that there was no time</b> left <b>in the day to sacrifice,</b> i.e., he brought all his animals on the first day and realized that there was not enough time to sacrifice all of them, one can assume that the reason <b>that he did not bring them is that there was no time</b> left <b>in the day.</b> If so, his offering on another day is certainly considered merely the completion of the obligations of the first day. In this case his bringing of the additional offerings is not prohibited.

### Part 14
<b>But rather,</b> you must say that this is referring to a case <b>where he does not have</b> enough <b>eaters</b> in his household, and as one may not have leftovers, he did not sacrifice the remaining offerings. Here too, the fact <b>that he did not sacrifice them is because he does not have</b> enough <b>eaters.</b> Again, this cannot be the case in which it is prohibited to sacrifice the extra offerings.

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this ruling <b>only</b> in a case <b>where there is time</b> left <b>in the day and he has eaters</b> in his household. <b>From</b> the fact <b>that he did not sacrifice them on the first</b> day of the Festival, one can <b>conclude from</b> it that <b>he left them</b> intentionally. Therefore, he is no longer permitted to sacrifice them on the other days of the Festival.

### Part 16
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan agrees that if one specifies his intentions he may sacrifice the offerings on the remaining days, <b>as when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If <b>one separated ten animals for his Festival peace-</b>offering, and <b>he sacrificed five on the first day</b> of <b>the Festival, he may return and sacrifice</b> the other <b>five on the second</b> day of the <b>Festival.</b> These two statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan, cited by Ulla and Ravin respectively, apparently <b>contradict each other.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> this contradiction that this statement <b>here</b> is dealing with a case <b>where</b> one <b>did not specify,</b> whereas <b>there</b> it is referring to a situation <b>where</b> one stated his intentions <b>explicitly?</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Indeed, conclude from</b> here that it is so.

### Part 18
It <b>was also stated</b> that <b>Rav Shemen bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b>
