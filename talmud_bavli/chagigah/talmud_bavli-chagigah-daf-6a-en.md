### Part 1
<b>Who brought him to here,</b> all the way to Jerusalem? If the father could bring his child to Jerusalem, why can’t he bring him to the Temple Mount?

### Part 2
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> With regard to the way <b>to here, as his mother is</b> also <b>obligated in rejoicing</b> on the Festival, <b>his mother brought him</b> when she herself ascended to the capital. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward, if he is able to ascend and hold his father’s hand from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount, he is obligated, and if not, he is exempt.</b>

### Part 3
It is taught in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>responded in place of Beit Hillel,</b> that <b>according to the statement of Beit Shammai</b> that a child who is unable to ride on his father’s shoulders is not obligated in the mitzva of appearance, they must explain a verse that deals with Hanna, Samuel’s mother: <b>“But Hanna did not ascend, for she said to her husband: Until the child is weaned, when I will bring him”</b> (I Samuel 1:22). <b>But Samuel was able to ride on his father’s shoulders.</b> The age of weaning is twenty-four months, before which Samuel was already old enough to ride on his father’s shoulders, and yet he was not ready to ascend to the Tabernacle. This shows that only a child who is able to walk on his own is obligated in the mitzva of appearance.

### Part 4
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>father said to him: According to your reasoning, ask about Hanna herself: Wasn’t she obligated in rejoicing?</b> Why didn’t she travel to the Tabernacle to fulfill a mitzva in which she herself was obligated? <b>Rather, Hanna saw in Samuel</b> the need for <b>extra pampering, and she was concerned about Samuel</b> lest he experience <b>weakness from the journey.</b> Since she was unable to bring him, she herself did not come.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Shimon raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a minor</b> who is <b>lame</b> and yet he is able to ascend on his father’s shoulders, <b>according to the statement of Beit Shammai, and</b> likewise a minor who is <b>blind</b> but is able to hold his father’s hand and ascend, <b>according to the statements of both</b> Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Are these children obligated in the mitzva of appearance?

### Part 6
The Gemara inquires: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring <b>to a lame</b> minor <b>who cannot be healed, and a blind</b> child <b>who cannot develop</b> sight, what is the dilemma? <b>Now,</b> if <b>an adult</b> in this state <b>is exempt, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to ask about <b>a minor?</b> Since this minor will never be obligated in the mitzva, even when he is an adult, there is no need to train him in its performance. The Gemara explains: <b>No;</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to ask with regard <b>to a lame</b> minor <b>who can be healed and a blind</b> minor <b>who can develop</b> sight. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Since the minor might eventually be obligated, is it necessary to train him at this point?

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said: Anywhere that an adult is obligated by Torah law, one</b> must <b>also train a minor</b> in that state of health <b>by rabbinic law. Anywhere that an adult is exempt by Torah law, a minor</b> in that same state <b>is also exempt by rabbinic law.</b> Since in this current condition an adult would be exempt, there is no obligation to train this minor either, despite the fact that he might become obligated in the future.

### Part 8
§ The mishna taught that <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The burnt-offering of <b>appearance,</b> brought by a pilgrim when he appears at the Temple on a Festival, must be worth at least <b>two silver</b> coins, and the Festival peace-offering must be worth at least one silver <i>ma’a</i> coin. And Beit Hillel say: The burnt-offering of appearance must be worth at least one silver <i>ma’a</i> and the Festival peace-offering at least two silver coins.

### Part 9
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The burnt-offering of <b>appearance</b> must be worth <b>two silver</b> coins, <b>and the Festival peace</b>-offering need be worth only one <b>silver <i>ma’a</i>.</b> The reason the burnt-offering must be worth more is <b>that</b> the burnt-offering of <b>appearance</b> goes <b>up entirely to God, which is not so with regard to the Festival peace</b>-offering, as parts of <b>a peace</b>-offering are eaten by its owner while other portions are consumed by the priests. <b>And furthermore,</b> another reason for this difference is that <b>we find with regard to</b> the festival of <b>Assembly,</b> i.e., <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>that the verse includes more burnt</b>-offerings <b>than peace</b>-offerings. The sacrificial requirement consists of one bull, two rams, and seven sheep as burnt-offerings, but only two sheep for peace-offerings.

### Part 10
<b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The burnt-offering of <b>appearance</b> must be worth <b>one silver <i>ma’a</i> and the Festival peace</b>-offering must be worth <b>two silver</b> coins. The reason for this difference is <b>that the Festival peace</b>-offering <b>existed before the speech</b> of God, i.e., before the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai, <b>which is not so with regard to</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance. And furthermore,</b> another reason is that <b>we find with regard to</b> the offerings of the princes during the dedication of the Tabernacle <b>that the verse includes more peace</b>-offerings <b>than burnt</b>-offerings. Each prince brought one cow, a ram, and a sheep as burnt-offerings, but two cows, two rams, five goats, and five sheep as peace-offerings.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And Beit Hillel, what is the reason</b> that <b>they do not say in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai?</b> Beit Hillel would respond to both claims of Beit Shammai. With regard to <b>that which you said,</b> that the burnt-offering of <b>appearance is superior because it</b> goes <b>up entirely to God, on the contrary, the Festival peace</b>-offering <b>is superior, as it has two consumptions,</b> by God on the altar and by people. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which you said</b> that <b>we derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the festival of <b>Assembly,</b> i.e., <i>Shavuot</i>, one could argue instead that <b>one</b> should <b>derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the offering of an individual from</b> another <b>offering of an individual,</b> i.e., the princes; <b>and one does not derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of the offering of an individual from the communal offering</b> of <i>Shavuot</i>.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks the reverse question: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Beit Shammai do not say in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel?</b> Beit Shammai would respond to the arguments of Beit Hillel: <b>With regard to that which you said,</b> that <b>the Festival peace</b>-offering <b>is superior, as it existed before the speech</b> of God, the burnt-offering of <b>appearance also existed before the speech.</b> According to the opinion of Beit Shammai, the Jewish people sacrificed burnt-offerings at Mount Sinai before the giving of the Torah.

### Part 13
<b>And with regard to that which you said,</b> that <b>one derives</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of these offerings <b>from</b> the offerings of <b>the princes,</b> one could argue that <b>one derives</b> the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of a matter that is performed in</b> all <b>generations,</b> i.e., the value of the different Festival offerings, <b>from</b> another <b>matter that is performed in</b> all <b>generations,</b> i.e., the offerings brought on <i>Shavuot</i>. However, <b>one does not derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of a matter that is performed in</b> all <b>generations from a matter that is not performed in</b> all <b>generations,</b> as the offerings of the princes was a specific mitzva for the Tabernacle in the wilderness.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, what is different</b> about <b>the Festival peace</b>-offering, <b>that it existed before the speech</b> of God, <b>as it is written: “And they sacrificed peace-offerings</b> of bulls to the Lord” (Exodus 24:5)? The burnt-offering of <b>appearance</b> is <b>also</b> mentioned, as <b>isn’t it written</b> in the same verse: <b>“And they sacrificed burnt</b>-offerings”?

### Part 15
The Gemara responds: <b>Beit Hillel hold</b> that <b>the burnt</b>-offering <b>that the Jewish people sacrificed in the desert</b> at Mount Sinai <b>was the daily burnt</b>-offering, which is a communal offering, as there were no individual burnt-offerings before the giving of the Torah. <b>And Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>the burnt</b>-offering <b>that the Jewish people sacrificed in the desert</b> at Mount Sinai <b>was a burnt</b>-offering <b>of appearance,</b> which is an individual offering.

### Part 16
<b>Abaye said: Beit Shammai, Rabbi Elazar, and Rabbi Yishmael all hold</b> that <b>the burnt</b>-offering <b>that the Jewish people sacrificed in the desert</b> at Mount Sinai <b>was a burnt</b>-offering <b>of appearance. And Beit Hillel, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Yosei HaGelili all hold</b> that <b>the burnt</b>-offering <b>that the Jewish people sacrificed in the desert</b> at Mount Sinai <b>was a daily burnt</b>-offering, not an individual offering.

### Part 17
The Gemara explains the source for each opinion. <b>Beit Shammai</b> is <b>that which we said. Rabbi Yishmael, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: General statements were said at Sinai,</b> i.e., Moses received general mitzvot at Sinai, including the Ten Commandments.
