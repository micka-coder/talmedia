### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All are obligated</b> on the three pilgrim Festivals <b>in the</b> mitzva of <b>appearance,</b> i.e., to appear in the Temple as well as to sacrifice an offering, <b>except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor; and a <i>tumtum</i>, and a hermaphrodite, and women, and slaves who are not emancipated; and the lame, and the blind, and the sick, and the old, and one who is unable to ascend</b> to Jerusalem <b>on his</b> own <b>legs.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Who</b> has the status of <b>a minor</b> with regard to this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Any</b> child <b>who is unable to ride on his father’s shoulders and ascend from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount;</b> this is <b>the statement of Beit Shammai. And Beit Hillel say: Any</b> child <b>who is unable to hold his father’s hand and ascend</b> on foot <b>from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount, as it is stated: “Three times [<i>regalim</i>]”</b> (Exodus 23:14). Since the term for feet is <i>raglayim</i>, Beit Hillel infer from here that the obligation to ascend involves the use of one’s legs.

### Part 3
<b>Beit Shammai say: The</b> burnt-offering of <b>appearance</b> brought on a pilgrim Festival must be worth at least <b>two silver</b> coins, <b>and the Festival peace</b>-offering must be worth at least one <b>silver <i>ma’a</i></b> coin. <b>And Beit Hillel say: The</b> burnt-offering of <b>appearance</b> must be worth at least one <b>silver <i>ma’a</i> and the Festival peace</b>-offering at least <b>two silver</b> coins.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: When the mishna states that all are obligated in the mitzva of appearance in the Temple, the term: All, comes <b>to add what</b> in the mishna’s ruling? The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to add one who is half-slave half-freeman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Ravina, who said: One who is half-slave half-freeman is exempt from the appearance</b> in the Temple, the term: <b>All,</b> comes <b>to add what?</b> The Gemara answers: It comes <b>to add</b> one who was <b>lame on</b> the <b>first day</b> of the Festival and was unable to travel, <b>and was healed on</b> the <b>second day</b> of the Festival. This man is obligated to appear before the end of the Festival.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>all</b> seven days of the Festival <b>redress one another,</b> i.e., the obligation to appear applies equally on all days of the Festival. Consequently, one who was unable to travel on the first day may do so on the second day. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that the main obligation is on the first day and <b>all</b> the remaining days merely <b>redress the first</b> day, and therefore one who was exempt from appearing on the first day of the Festival remains exempt throughout the rest of the Festival, the term: <b>All,</b> comes <b>to add what?</b> The Gemara answers: It comes <b>to add</b> one who is <b>blind in one of his eyes.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Yoḥanan ben Dehavai says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda:</b> One who is <b>blind in one of his eyes is exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b>appearance, as it is stated:</b> “Three occasions in the year all your males <b>will appear [<i>yera’e</i>]</b> before the Lord God” (Exodus 23:17). Since there are no vowels in the text, this can be read as: All your males <b>will see [<i>yireh</i>]</b> the Lord God. This teaches that <b>in the</b> same <b>manner that one comes to see, so he comes to be seen: Just as</b> the usual way <b>to see</b> is <b>with both one’s eyes, so too</b> the obligation <b>to be seen</b> applies only to one who comes <b>with</b> the sight of <b>both his eyes.</b> Therefore, one who is blind in one eye is not obligated in the mitzva of appearance in the Temple.

### Part 7
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> it is <b>as we said initially,</b> that it comes to include one who is half-slave and half-freeman. <b>And</b> as for that <b>which</b> poses <b>a difficulty to</b> the opinion <b>of Ravina,</b> it is <b>not difficult: Here</b> it is in accordance with <b>the initial</b> version of the <b>mishna,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> Ravina’s statement, is <b>in accordance with the ultimate</b> version of the <b>mishna. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 88a): <b>One who is half-slave half-freeman serves his master one day</b> and works for <b>himself one day.</b> This is <b>the statement of Beit Hillel.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Beit Shammai said to them:</b>
