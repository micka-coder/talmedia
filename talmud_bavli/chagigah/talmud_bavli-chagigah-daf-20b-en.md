### Part 1
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one whose donkey drivers and workers,</b> who were <i>amei ha’aretz</i>, <b>were bearing pure</b> food, without touching the pure food itself but only the earthenware vessels containing them, even if <b>he distanced himself from them</b> as they walked by <b>more than a <i>mil</i>, his pure</b> foods <b>are pure.</b> Since the workers are unaware of his departure, he is still considered to be guarding the food in their possession and need not be concerned that they may have touched the pure foods. <b>But if he said to them: Go, and I will follow behind you,</b> then <b>once they are no longer within his eyesight, his pure</b> foods <b>are impure.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, where the food remains pure, <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> where the food is impure? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said: The first clause</b> is referring <b>to one who purifies his donkey drivers and workers for this</b> purpose, meaning that he ensured that they immersed and purified themselves beforehand, so that concern for impurity was removed.

### Part 3
The Gemara questions this: <b>If so,</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> they should <b>also</b> be pure. The Gemara responds: <b>An <i>am ha’aretz</i> is not particular about the contact of his colleague,</b> and therefore there is concern that they might have encountered another <i>am ha’aretz</i> on the way, who touched the produce and thereby rendered it impure.

### Part 4
The Gemara counters: <b>If so,</b> in <b>the first</b> clause of the <i>baraita</i> there should <b>also</b> be concern that they might have met an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, and despite the employer’s warning to his workers to stay ritually pure, they are not careful with regard to the impurity of another <i>am ha’aretz</i>. The Gemara answers: The first clause is referring to a situation <b>when he comes across them</b> via <b>a circuitous path.</b> Since he is not walking directly behind them but can appear from the sides, they cannot always see him. Consequently, they are concerned that he may return at any moment. Therefore, they are careful not to render themselves ritually impure, and they are also wary of the contact of other <i>amei ha’aretz</i>, although they are not usually particular about the contact of their colleagues.

### Part 5
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> in <b>the latter clause, too,</b> since he can arrive from around a corner at any given moment, they should certainly be cautious. The Gemara responds: <b>Since he said to them: Go and I will follow behind you, they rely</b> on this, and they do not consider themselves to be under observation. Consequently, they are not particular about the contact of another <i>am ha’aretz</i>.
