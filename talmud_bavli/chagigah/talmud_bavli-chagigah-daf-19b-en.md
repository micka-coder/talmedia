### Part 1
Rabbi <b>Meir would say:</b> One may <b>immerse in the upper one, and I say: In the lower one but not in the upper one.</b> This demonstrates that Rabbi Yehuda does not accept the principle of raising the partition. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: If this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught, it is taught,</b> and I cannot take issue with it. Therefore, it is clear that the matter is held in dispute between <i>tanna’im</i> and that Rabbi Yehuda does not accept the principle of raising the partition.

### Part 2
§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>One who immersed for</b> the purpose of eating <b>non-sacred</b> food with the intention of <b>assuming a presumptive status</b> of ritual purity <b>for non-sacred</b> food <b>it is prohibited for him</b> to eat <b>tithes.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna? It is</b> that of <b>the Rabbis, who differentiate between non-sacred</b> produce <b>and tithes,</b> since they maintain the following: If one who is required by rabbinic law to immerse touches non-sacred food, it remains pure, but if he comes into contact with tithes they are rendered ritually impure.

### Part 3
However, in that case, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which states that <b>the garments of an <i>am ha’aretz</i>,</b> who is not careful with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity, <b>are</b> considered to be rendered ritually impure by the impurity imparted by the <b>treading</b> of a <i>zav</i>, which is considered a primary source of ritual impurity, <b>for <i>perushin</i>,</b> individuals who are careful to eat even non-sacred food in a state of purity. <b>The garments of <i>perushin</i>,</b> although they are careful to remain ritually pure, are nevertheless considered to be rendered impure by the <b>treading</b> of a <i>zav</i> <b>for</b> priests who partake of <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> Consequently, the latter clause differs from the opinion of the Rabbis in the earlier clause.

### Part 4
Therefore, <b>we have arrived at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said: Non-sacred</b> produce <b>and tithes are similar to one another,</b> as this clause of the mishna does not distinguish between those eating non-sacred food and those eating tithes. Is <b>the earlier clause</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and the latter clause</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes;</b> although it is unusual, in this instance we must explain that <b>the earlier clause</b> was said by <b>the Rabbis and the latter clause</b> by <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 5
However, <b>Rav Aḥa bar Adda would teach</b> that <b>five levels</b> of ritual purity are listed <b>in the latter clause</b> of the mishna, by counting the clause that states that the clothes of those who eat non-sacred produce in a state of purity are ritually impure for tithes, <b>and</b> in this way <b>he establishes</b> the <b>entire</b> mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 6
§ <b>Rav Mari said:</b> They <b>learn from</b> the mishna that <b>non-sacred</b> produce <b>that was prepared according to</b> the level of <b>ritual purity</b> required <b>for sacrificial</b> food, i.e., with the same stringencies as required for sacrificial food, is <b>like sacrificial</b> food. <b>From where</b> is this deduced?
