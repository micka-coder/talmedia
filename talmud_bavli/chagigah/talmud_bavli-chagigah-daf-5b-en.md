### Part 1
<b>is not from</b> among <b>them. The Sages said to Rava: Master, you are not subject to</b> His <b>hiding</b> of the <b>face,</b> as your prayers are heard, <b>and you are not subject to: “And they shall be devoured,”</b> as the authorities take nothing from you. <b>He said to them: Do you know how many</b> gifts <b>I send in private to the house of King Shapur?</b> Although it might seem that the monarchy does not take anything from me, in actuality I am forced to give many bribes. <b>Even so, the Sages looked upon</b> Rava with suspicion. <b>In the meantime,</b> messengers <b>from the house of King Shapur sent</b> for him <b>and imprisoned him</b> to extort more money from him. Rava <b>said: This is as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: Wherever the Sages looked upon</b> someone, it resulted in <b>either death or poverty.</b>

### Part 2
With regard to the verse: <b>“And I will hide my face in that day”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:18), <b>Rava said</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Even though I hid my face from them</b> and My Divine Presence is not revealed, nevertheless: <b>“I speak with him in a dream”</b> (Numbers 12:6). <b>Rav Yosef said: His hand is outstretched,</b> guarding <b>over us, as it is stated: “And I have covered you in the shadow of my hand”</b> (Isaiah 51:16).

### Part 3
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya was standing in</b> the <b>house of the Caesar. A certain heretic,</b> who was also present, <b>gestured to him,</b> indicating that his was <b>the nation whose Master,</b> God, <b>turned His face</b> away <b>from it.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>gestured to him</b> that <b>His hand is outstretched over us</b> in protection. <b>The Caesar said to Rabbi Yehoshua: What did he gesture to you,</b> and how did you respond? He replied: He indicated that mine is <b>the nation whose Master turned His face from it, and I gestured to him</b> that <b>His hand is outstretched over us.</b>

### Part 4
The members of the Caesar’s household <b>said to that heretic: What did you gesture to him?</b> He said to them: I gestured that his is <b>the nation whose Master has turned</b> His face <b>from it.</b> They asked: <b>And what did he gesture to you?</b> He said to them: <b>I don’t know;</b> I did not understand. <b>They said:</b> How can <b>a man who does not know what</b> others <b>gesture to him</b> dare to <b>gesture in the presence of the king? They took him out and killed him.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya was dying, the Sages said to him: What will become of us, from</b> the threat of <b>the heretics,</b> when there is no scholar like you who can refute them? <b>He said to them</b> that the verse states: “Is wisdom no more in Teiman? <b>Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom vanished?”</b> (Jeremiah 49:7). He explained: <b>Since counsel has perished from the prudent,</b> from the Jewish people, the <b>wisdom of the nations of the world has vanished</b> as well, and there will be no superior scholars among them.

### Part 6
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the same idea can be derived <b>from here: “And he said: Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go corresponding to you”</b> (Genesis 33:12). Just as the Jewish people rise and fall, so too, the nations of the world simultaneously rise and fall, and they will never have an advantage.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ila was ascending the stairs in the house of Rabba bar Sheila,</b> a children’s teacher. <b>He heard a child who was reading</b> a verse out loud: <b>“For, lo, He Who forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares to man what is his speech”</b> (Amos 4:13). Rabbi Ila <b>said:</b> With regard to <b>a servant whose master declares to him what is his</b> proper <b>speech, is there a remedy for him?</b> The Gemara asks. <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“What is his speech”? Rav said: Even frivolous speech that is between a man and his wife</b> before engaging in relations <b>is declared to a person at the time of death,</b> and he will have to account for it.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so?</b> Is it prohibited for a man to speak in this manner with his wife? <b>Wasn’t Rav Kahana lying beneath Rav’s bed, and he heard</b> Rav <b>chatting and laughing</b> with his wife, <b>and performing his needs,</b> i.e., having relations with her. Rav Kahana <b>said</b> out loud: <b>The mouth of Rav is like</b> one who <b>has never eaten a cooked dish,</b> i.e., his behavior is lustful. Rav <b>said to him: Kahana, leave, as</b> this is <b>not proper conduct.</b> This shows that Rav himself engaged in frivolous talk before relations.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where this type of speech is permitted, it is referring to a situation <b>where he must appease</b> his wife before relations, and therefore this speech is appropriate. However, <b>this</b> statement, that it is prohibited, is referring to a situation <b>where he doesn’t need to appease her.</b> In these circumstances, it is prohibited to engage in excessively lighthearted chatter with one’s wife.

### Part 10
The verse states: <b>“But if you will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret [<i>bemistarim</i>] for your pride”</b> (Jeremiah 13:17). <b>Rav Shmuel bar Inya said in the name of Rav: The Holy One, Blessed be He, has a place</b> where He cries, <b>and its name is Mistarim. What</b> is the meaning of <b>“for your pride”? Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said:</b> God cries <b>due to the pride of the Jewish people, which was taken from them and given to</b> the gentile <b>nations. Rav Shmuel bar Naḥmani said:</b> He cries <b>due to the pride of the kingdom of Heaven,</b> which was removed from the world.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>But is there crying before the Holy One, Blessed be He? Didn’t Rav Pappa say: There is no sadness before the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Honor and majesty are before Him; strength and gladness are in His place”</b> (I Chronicles 16:27)? The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement, that God cries, is referring to <b>the innermost chambers,</b> where He can cry in secret, whereas <b>this</b> statement, that He does not cry, is referring to <b>the outer chambers.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And doesn’t</b> God cry <b>in the outer chambers? Isn’t it written: “And on that day the Lord, the God of hosts, called to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth”</b> (Isaiah 22:12)? The Gemara responds: <b>The destruction of the Temple is different, as even the angels of peace cried, as it is stated: “Behold, their valiant ones cry without; the angels of peace weep bitterly”</b> (Isaiah 33:7).

### Part 13
The verse continues: <b>“And my eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because the Lord’s flock is carried away captive”</b> (Jeremiah 13:17). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Why these three</b> references to <b>tears</b> in the verse? <b>One</b> is <b>for the First Temple; one</b> is <b>for the Second Temple; and one</b> is <b>for the Jewish people who were exiled from their place. And there are</b> those <b>who say:</b> The last <b>one</b> is <b>for</b> the unavoidable <b>dereliction</b> of the study of <b>Torah</b> in the wake of the exile.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that the last tear is <b>for the Jewish people who were exiled, this is as it is written: “Because the Lord’s flock is carried away captive.” However, according to the one who said</b> that this tear is <b>for the dereliction</b> of the study of <b>Torah, what</b> is the meaning of: <b>“Because the Lord’s flock is carried away captive”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since the Jewish people were exiled from their place, there is no greater</b> involuntary <b>dereliction</b> of the study of <b>Torah than</b> that which was caused by <b>this.</b>

### Part 15
<b>The Sages taught</b> that there are <b>three</b> types of people <b>for whom the Holy One, Blessed be He, cries every day: For</b> one <b>who is able to engage in Torah</b> study <b>and does not engage</b> in it; <b>and for</b> one <b>who is unable to engage in Torah</b> study and nevertheless he endeavors and <b>engages</b> in it; <b>and for a leader who lords over the community.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>was holding</b> the <b>book of Lamentations and was reading from it. When he reached the verse: “He has cast down from heaven to earth</b> the beauty of Israel” (Lamentations 2:1), in his distress the book <b>fell from his hand. He said: From a high roof to a deep pit,</b> i.e., it is terrible to tumble from the sky to the ground.

### Part 17
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabbi Ḥiyya were walking along the road. When they arrived at a certain city, they said: Is there a Torah scholar here whom we</b> can <b>go and greet?</b> The people of the city <b>said: There is a Torah scholar here but he is blind. Rabbi Ḥiyya said to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>You sit</b> here; <b>do not demean your</b> dignified status as <b><i>Nasi</i></b> to visit someone beneath your stature. <b>I will go and greet him.</b>

### Part 18
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>grabbed him and went with him</b> anyway, and together they greeted the blind scholar. <b>When they were leaving him, he said to them: You greeted</b> one who is <b>seen and does not see; may you be worthy to greet</b> the One Who <b>sees and is not seen.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>Now, if</b> I had listened to you and not gone to greet him, <b>you would have prevented me from receiving this blessing.</b>

### Part 19
<b>They said to</b> the blind scholar: <b>From whom did you hear</b> that we are worthy of this blessing? He said to them: <b>I heard</b> it <b>from the instruction of Rabbi Ya’akov, as Rabbi Ya’akov of the village of Ḥitiyya would greet his teacher every day. When</b> Rabbi Ya’akov <b>grew elderly,</b> his teacher <b>said to him: Do not despair, my Master, that my Master is unable</b> to make the effort to greet me. It is better that you should not visit me.

### Part 20
Rabbi Ya’akov <b>said to him: Is it</b> a <b>minor</b> matter, <b>that which is written about the Sages: “That he should still live always, that he should not see the pit. For he sees that wise men die”</b> (Psalms 49:10–11)? In this regard an <i>a fortiori</i> reference applies: <b>Just as one who sees Sages in their death will live, all the more so</b> one who sees them <b>in their lifetime.</b> From here the blind scholar learned the importance of greeting Torah scholars, which is why he blessed the Sages who came to greet him.

### Part 21
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Idi, father of Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi, would regularly travel three months on the road</b> to reach the study hall <b>and</b> as he would immediately travel back again to arrive home for the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, he spent only <b>one day in the school of Rav. And the Sages would</b> disparagingly <b>call him: A student</b> of Torah <b>for one day. He was offended</b> and <b>read</b> the following verse <b>about himself: “I am as one that is a laughingstock to his neighbor,</b> a man who calls upon God, and He answers him” (Job 12:4). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: Please do not punish the Sages,</b> i.e., do not take offense and be harsh with them, as this will cause them to be punished by God.

### Part 22
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan left</b> Rav Idi and went <b>to the study hall and taught: “Yet they seek Me daily, and delight to know My ways”</b> (Isaiah 58:2). <b>But is</b> it possible that only <b>during the day they seek Him and at night they do not seek Him?</b> What is the meaning of daily? <b>Rather,</b> this verse comes <b>to say to you</b> that with regard to <b>anyone who engages in Torah</b> study <b>even one day a year, the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as though he engaged</b> in Torah study <b>the entire year.</b>

### Part 23
<b>And the same</b> applies <b>to the attribute of punishment, as it is written: “After the number of the days in which you spied out the land,</b> even forty days, for every day a year, shall you bear your iniquities” (Numbers 14:34). <b>But did they sin</b> for <b>forty years? Didn’t they sin</b> for only <b>forty days? Rather,</b> this comes <b>to say to you</b> that <b>anyone who transgresses a sin even one day a year, the verse ascribes him</b> liability <b>as though he transgressed the entire year.</b>

### Part 24
§ The mishna taught: <b>Who is a minor</b> who is exempt from the mitzva of appearance in the Temple? <b>Any</b> child <b>who is unable to ride on his father’s shoulders</b> and ascend from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount. <b>Rabbi Zeira strongly objects to this:</b>
