### Part 1
<b>Apparently, he holds</b> that <b>the Festival peace-</b>offering <b>of the fourteenth</b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>by Torah law,</b> and therefore one may bring it even from second-tithe funds.

### Part 2
§ <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> Festival peace-offerings may be brought even <b>from the</b> second <b>tithe.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why? It is an obligatory matter, and any obligatory matter may come only from non-sacred</b> property. <b>Ulla said:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>combines,</b> i.e., the offering is purchased with a combination of second-tithe funds and non-sacred money. The Gemara adds that <i>amora’im</i> dispute the details of this <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 3
<b>Ḥizkiya said: One may combine</b> one <b>animal with</b> another <b>animal.</b> If one has a large household for which one animal will not suffice, he brings one animal for the Festival offering from non-sacred money and he may combine funds of second tithe to purchase a second animal. Since he has fulfilled his obligation of the Festival offering by bringing one animal from non-sacred money, he may bring the others from second tithe or animal tithes. <b>But one may not combine money with</b> other <b>money,</b> i.e., one may not combine second-tithe funds with non-sacred money toward the purchase of one animal for the Festival offering. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One</b> may <b>combine money with</b> other <b>money, but one may not combine</b> one <b>animal with</b> another <b>animal.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥizkiya,</b> and <b>it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> “<b>After the measure</b> of the gift offering of your hand” (Deuteronomy 16:10). This <b>teaches that a person brings his obligatory</b> offering <b>from non-sacred</b> property. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if one wishes to mix he</b> may <b>mix? The verse states: “As the Lord your God blesses you”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:10), i.e., one may use any money with which God has blessed him, even second tithe. The term: Mix, means combining money from different sources.

### Part 5
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥizkiya: “After the measure”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:10). This <b>teaches that a person brings his obligatory</b> offering <b>from non-sacred</b> property. Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree with regard to this issue, as <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> On <b>the first day</b> one may bring only <b>from non-sacred</b> property. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward</b> one may buy the animal <b>from the</b> second-<b>tithe</b> money. <b>And Beit Hillel say: The first eating</b> must be <b>from non-sacred</b> property. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward</b> one may bring <b>from the</b> second-<b>tithe</b> money. The phrase: The first eating, means the first animal that one eats, which is in accordance with Ḥizkiya’s opinion.

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: All this applies on the first day of the Festival. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>all the other days of Passover,</b> on which one is obligated to bring peace-offerings of rejoicing, <b>a person fulfills his obligation</b> even <b>with animal tithes,</b> and certainly with funds of second tithe. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason that one does not</b> fulfill his obligation with animal tithes <b>on the Festival?</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> There is a concern that if one requires additional animals, <b>perhaps he may come to separate tithes on the Festival</b> itself, <b>and one may not separate tithes on the Festival due to the red dye [<i>sikrata</i>].</b> Every tenth animal is marked with red dye, and as it is prohibited to dye on a Festival due to the labor of writing, one may not separate tithes on a Festival.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>From where may it be inferred that this: “After the measure [<i>missat</i>],”</b> mentioned in the verse, <b>is a term for non-sacred</b> property? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute [<i>mas</i>] upon the land”</b> (Esther 10:1), which is clearly referring to a tribute of non-sacred property.

### Part 9
§ The mishna stated that <b>Israelites fulfill their obligation</b> to eat peace-offerings of rejoicing <b>with</b> their <b>vow</b> offerings <b>and gift</b> offerings. <b>The Sages taught</b> that the verse: <b>“And you shall rejoice in your feast”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:14) comes <b>to include all types of rejoicing as</b> constituting a fulfillment of the mitzva of <b>rejoicing. From here the Sages stated: Israelites fulfill their obligation</b> to eat peace-offerings of rejoicing <b>with</b> their <b>vow</b> offerings <b>and gift</b> offerings <b>and</b> likewise <b>with animal tithes.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And the priests</b> fulfill their obligation of rejoicing <b>with</b> the meat of <b>sin-</b>offerings <b>and guilt-</b>offerings, <b>and with firstborn</b> offerings, <b>and with the breast and thigh</b> of peace-offerings. One <b>might</b> have thought that they can fulfill their obligation <b>even by</b> eating <b>bird-</b>offerings <b>and meal-</b>offerings. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall rejoice in your feast.”</b>
