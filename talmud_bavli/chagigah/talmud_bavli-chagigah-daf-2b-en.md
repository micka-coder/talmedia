### Part 1
<b>You have remedied</b> the situation of <b>his master,</b> who benefits fully from all his rights to the slave, <b>but his own</b> situation <b>you have not remedied.</b> How so? <b>He is unable to marry a maidservant,</b> as half of him is already free, and a free Jew may not marry a Canaanite maidservant. <b>He</b> is likewise <b>unable</b> to marry <b>a free woman,</b> as half of him is still a slave.

### Part 2
And if you say <b>he should be idle</b> and not marry, <b>but isn’t it</b> true that <b>the world was created only for procreation, as it is stated: “He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited”</b> (Isaiah 45:18)? <b>Rather, for the betterment of the world we force his master to make him a freeman, and</b> the slave <b>writes a bill to</b> his master accepting his responsibility to pay <b>half his value</b> to him. <b>And Beit Hillel</b> ultimately <b>retracted</b> their opinion, <b>to rule in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai</b> that a half-slave must be set free.

### Part 3
§ The mishna taught: <b>Except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor.</b> The Gemara notes: By listing these three cases together the mishna <b>is teaching</b> that <b>a deaf-mute is similar to an imbecile and a minor: Just as an imbecile and a minor</b> are among those <b>who are not of sound mind, so too the deaf-mute [<i>ḥeresh</i>]</b> mentioned here is one <b>who is not of sound mind. And</b> this <b>teaches us as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 1:2): <b>The <i>ḥeresh</i>, whom the Sages discussed everywhere,</b> is one <b>who does not hear and does not speak,</b> and therefore his mind is not lucid. It can be inferred from this that <b>one who speaks but does not hear</b> and <b>one who hears but does not speak are obligated</b> in mitzvot like any other person.

### Part 4
The Gemara notes: <b>We</b> already <b>learned this, as the Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Terumot</i> 1:2): <b>One who speaks but does not hear, this is a deaf</b> person. One who <b>hears but does not speak, this is a mute.</b> Both <b>this</b> one <b>and that</b> one <b>are</b> in the same legal category <b>as those who can see and hear</b> with regard <b>to all matters.</b> This shows that the <i>ḥeresh</i> exempted by the Sages is one who neither hears nor speaks.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that one who speaks but does not hear is a deaf</b> person, and one who <b>hears but does not speak is a mute? As it is written: “But I am as a deaf man, I hear not; and I am as a dumb man [<i>illem</i>] who does not open his mouth”</b> (Psalms 38:14). <b>If you wish, say</b> instead that this is <b>as people say: His speech has been taken [<i>Ishtakeil Milulei</i>];</b> the term <i>illem</i> is an acronym for this phrase.

### Part 6
The <i>Tosefta</i> taught that <b>one who speaks but does not hear</b> and <b>one who hears but does not speak</b> are <b>obligated</b> in mitzvot. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>one who speaks but does not hear</b> and <b>one who hears but does not speak</b> are <b>exempt?</b>

### Part 7
<b>Ravina said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rava</b> who said: The mishna <b>is incomplete and is teaching the following: All are obligated in</b> the mitzvot of <b>appearance</b> in the Temple <b>and rejoicing</b> during the pilgrim Festival by eating the sacrificial meat, <b>except for a deaf</b> person <b>who speaks but does not hear</b> and mute person <b>who hears but does not speak,</b> each of whom <b>is exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance. And even though he is exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance, he is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>rejoicing. But one who does not hear and does not speak, and an imbecile and a minor,</b> each of these is <b>exempt even from rejoicing, since they are exempt from all the mitzvot mentioned in the Torah,</b> as they are not of sound mind.

### Part 8
<b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All are obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance and in rejoicing, except for a deaf</b> person <b>who speaks but does not hear</b> and <b>one who hears but does not speak, as they are exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance. And even though they are exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>appearance,</b>
