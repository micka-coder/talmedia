as <b>they treated</b> the tube with severity <b>as</b> though it had been <b>rendered impure</b> by contact with a dead <b>creeping animal.</b> Therefore, in not requiring the setting of the sun they made it noticeable that they were opposed to the Sadducees.

### Part 2
The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> that the tube is treated as if defiled by a creeping animal, <b>it should not render a person impure,</b> as something defiled by a creeping animal is impure to the first degree of ritual impurity, which cannot impart ritual impurity to people. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The one who <b>cuts and immerses</b> the tube for the red heifer ashes <b>requires immersion</b> himself, which shows that the tube does defile people? <b>But rather,</b> say that <b>they treated it as</b> something <b>made impure by</b> contact with <b>a corpse,</b> for such objects do defile people as well. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> the tube <b>should</b> also <b>require the sprinkling</b> of the water of purification on the <b>third and seventh</b> days of its purification, like all things defiled by a corpse.

### Part 3
<b>Why,</b> then, <b>is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The one who <b>cuts and immerses it requires immersion,</b> which indicates that <b>immersion</b> for the tube, <b>yes,</b> this is required, but <b>sprinkling of the third and the seventh</b> day, <b>no. Rather,</b> you must say that <b>they treated it as</b> something <b>made impure by</b> contact with <b>a corpse</b> that is already <b>in its seventh</b> day, after its sprinklings, when it is still impure and imparts impurity to those who touch it, but requires only immersion and no further sprinkling.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Sages <b>never made any innovations</b> in the <i>halakhot</i> of impurity <b>with regard to the</b> red <b>heifer</b> procedure. In other words, although the Sages added stringencies to the red heifer procedure, they never created new <i>halakhot</i> for it that do not exist elsewhere in other areas of <i>halakha</i>. We have said that the tube is treated as if it had had contact with a corpse even though it did not; this is an innovation that is not found anywhere else.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye said:</b> When they said that the Sages did not make innovations, they were not referring to something of this nature, but meant that <b>they did not say</b> that <b>a spade</b> upon which a <i>zav</i> sits <b>can become impure as a seat.</b> They thereby preserved the basic <i>halakhot</i> of impurity, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It states with regard to a <i>zav</i>: <b>“And he who sits on any object</b> whereon the <i>zav</i> sits shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening” (Leviticus 15:6). One <b>might</b> have thought that if a <i>zav</i> <b>turned over</b> a vessel used to measure <b>a <i>se’a</i> and sat on it,</b> or if he turned over a vessel used to measure <b>a <i>tarkav</i>,</b> i.e., a half-<i>se’a</i>, <b>and sat on it,</b> that the vessel <b>should be</b> rendered <b>impure</b> as a seat upon which a <i>zav</i> sat.

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he who sits on any object whereon</b> the <i>zav</i> <b>sits…and be unclean</b> until the evening” (Leviticus 15:6). The wording of the verse indicates that it is speaking of an object <b>that is designated for sitting,</b> i.e., upon which people generally sit, <b>excluding such</b> a vessel for <b>which we would say to</b> someone sitting on it: <b>Stand up, so we can do our work.</b> A spade and a measuring bowl, then, are not subject to the impurity of the seat of a <i>zav</i>, even if a <i>zav</i> sat on them. Rather, they are considered to be on the lower level of impurity transmitted through simple contact with a <i>zav</i>. The same <i>halakha</i> was applied to the vessels used in preparation of the red heifer; the Sages did not add stringency and decree that a vessel not generally used for sitting should be considered as the seat of a <i>zav</i>.

### Part 7
§ The mishna states: <b>A vessel combines</b> all the food that is in it with regard <b>to sacrificial</b> food <b>but not</b> with regard <b>to <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? What is the source for this stringency? <b>Rabbi Ḥanin said: The verse states</b> with regard to the sacrificial donations of the tribal princes: <b>“One golden pan of ten shekels, full of incense”</b> (Numbers 7:14), which teaches us that <b>the verse treats everything inside the pan</b> as <b>one</b> unit, even if the items are not attached to each other.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Kahana raised an objection</b> against this based on the mishna that teaches (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:1): <b>Rabbi Akiva added</b> to the list of it items that are considered combined when in the same vessel <b>fine flour, incense, frankincense, and coals,</b> saying <b>that if one who immersed himself that day</b> but has not waited until sunset <b>touched</b> a <b>part</b> of the contents of a vessel containing these substances, <b>all of</b> the vessel’s contents <b>are disqualified,</b> as the vessel combines them.

### Part 9
<b>Isn’t this</b> <i>halakha</i> that these substances are considered combined <b>by rabbinic law? From where</b> do we know that this is so? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it teaches</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of that mishna: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Beteira testified with regard to ashes of purification</b> in a vessel <b>that</b> if <b>an impure</b> person or object <b>touched part of it, it renders all of it impure.</b> The purification ashes of the red heifer are neither food nor a sacrificial item, so Rabbi Ḥanin’s verse does not apply to the ashes, and the vessel certainly does not combine the ashes together by Torah law, but by rabbinic law. <b>And it is taught</b> immediately following this: <b>Rabbi Akiva added,</b> which shows that Rabbi Akiva’s <i>halakha</i>, like the previous <i>halakha</i>, deals with an additional level of impurity instituted by the Sages rather than a Torah law.
