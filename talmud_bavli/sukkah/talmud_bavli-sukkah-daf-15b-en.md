### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it possible to be precise?</b> The mishna need not be understood in that manner, since it is possible to calibrate the width of the spaces to equal the width of the unfit roofing, as the mishna required no more than that. <b>Rabbi Ami said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where one extends</b> the width of the spaces beyond the width of the unfit roofing. The mishna deems the <i>sukka</i> fit only if the width of the spaces is greater than the width of the unfit roofing.

### Part 2
<b>Rava said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where one does not extend</b> the width of the spaces, and nevertheless, the fit roofing is greater than the unfit roofing, <b>if</b> the skewers <b>were placed lengthwise</b> across the <i>sukka</i>, <b>one places</b> the fit roofing <b>widthwise,</b> and if the skewers were placed <b>widthwise, one places the</b> fit roofing <b>lengthwise.</b> By doing so, the fit roofing overlaps the skewers at least somewhat; otherwise it would fall between the unfit roofing. Consequently, even if the space equals the unfit roofing, the fit roofing is greater than the unfit roofing.

### Part 3
§ The mishna continues: <b>Or with the long boards of the bed,</b> which compose its frame, the <i>sukka</i> is unfit. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the mishna <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ami bar Tavyomei, as Rabbi Ami bar Tavyomei said:</b> If <b>one roofed</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>with worn,</b> incomplete, <b>vessels,</b> the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit.</b> Although these incomplete vessels are no longer susceptible to ritual impurity, they remain unfit because they were initially unfit for roofing. Proof can be adduced from the mishna: The long boards of the bed are no longer vessels but rather pieces from broken vessels; still, they may not be used for roofing the <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this: The mishna is referring to a case <b>similar to</b> that <b>which Rabbi Ḥanan said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> in another context: It is not referring to the long boards alone. Rather, it is referring to a case <b>with the long board</b> of the bed <b>and two</b> of the <b>legs</b> attached to it <b>or</b> to a case <b>with the short board</b> of the bed <b>with two legs</b> attached to it. In this case, the structure could be propped up against a wall and used as a bed. <b>Here too,</b> the mishna is referring to roofing <b>with the long board and two legs or with the short board and two legs,</b> which are still considered complete vessels.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>Where is it stated</b> that <b>which Rabbi Ḥanan</b> said that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna:
