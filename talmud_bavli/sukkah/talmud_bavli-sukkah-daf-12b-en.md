### Part 1
<b>that one</b> may <b>not roof, due to the decree of the storehouse</b> issued by the Sages; <b>but by Torah</b> law, it <b>seems well</b> to do so. <b>There,</b> in the mishna pertaining to the stack of grain, <b>where it teaches: It is not a <i>sukka</i>,</b> it means that not only by rabbinic decree, but <b>even after the fact, by Torah</b> law <b>as well, it is not a <i>sukka</i>.</b>

### Part 2
§ <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If <b>one roofed</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>with convex arrow</b> shafts, which are made of wood with a protrusion on the end that is fitted into the socket of the metal arrowhead, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>fit.</b> These shafts are flat wooden utensils, which are not susceptible to ritual impurity. Therefore, they are fit roofing for a <i>sukka</i>. If, however, one roofed his <i>sukka</i> <b>with concave</b> arrow shafts, which have a socket into which a protrusion from the metal arrowhead is inserted, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit.</b> Since these shafts are wooden utensils with a receptacle, they are susceptible to ritual impurity. Therefore, they are unfit roofing for a <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: The fact that if one roofed a <i>sukka</i> with <b>convex</b> arrow shafts, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>fit</b> is <b>obvious.</b> It is no different from roofing with straight, smooth reeds. The Gemara answers: Stating this <i>halakha</i> is necessary. <b>Lest you say: Let us issue a decree</b> and prohibit roofing with <b>convex</b> shafts <b>due to</b> the prohibition against roofing with <b>concave</b> shafts, therefore Rav <b>teaches us</b> that no decree is issued, and convex shafts are fit roofing.

### Part 4
<b>The Master said:</b> If one roofed a <i>sukka</i> with <b>concave</b> arrows, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit.</b> The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious.</b> All wooden receptacles are susceptible to ritual impurity. The Gemara answers: Stating this <i>halakha</i> is necessary. <b>Lest you say: A receptacle that is designated to be</b> permanently <b>filled, its status</b> is <b>not</b> that of <b>a receptacle,</b> as a receptacle is typically filled and emptied; in this case, once the arrowhead fills the receptacle, it remains there, therefore Rav <b>teaches us</b> that it is deemed a receptacle and is not fit roofing.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If <b>one roofed</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>with bundles of combed flax,</b> the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit,</b> as flax at that stage of processing is the raw material from which threads are spun, and it is susceptible to ritual impurity. If one roofed a <i>sukka</i> <b>with stalks of flax,</b> the <i>sukka</i> is <b>fit.</b> Since they remain in their natural state and have not been processed in any way, their legal status is that of any tree, and they are not susceptible to ritual impurity. <b>And</b> if one roofed with <b>the <i>hoshen</i> of flax,</b> stalks at an intermediate stage of processing, <b>I do not know what</b> their status is, i.e., whether or not they are fit for roofing.

### Part 6
Rabba bar bar Ḥana added: <b>And</b> when Rabbi Yoḥanan used the term <b><i>hoshen</i> of</b> flax <b>itself, I do not know</b> to what stage of processing the flax he was referring. <b>Which way</b> do <b>you</b> look at it? Is it that <b>if one crushed</b> the flax <b>and did not comb</b> it, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>calls it <i>hoshen</i>, but if he soaked</b> it <b>and did not crush</b> it, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>calls it <i>hotzen</i>,</b> because he has not actually begun processing the flax itself? <b>Or, perhaps if he soaked</b> it <b>and did not crush</b> it, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>calls it <i>hoshen</i>,</b> while <i>hotzen</i> is reserved for flax that was not processed at all.

### Part 7
§ <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> With regard to <b>these</b> wide <b>licorice and wormwood</b> leaves, <b>one</b> may <b>roof his <i>sukka</i> with them,</b> since these are not consumed by people. Their legal status is that of any other plant; they are not susceptible to ritual impurity. <b>Abaye said: With licorice</b> leaves, <b>one</b> may <b>roof</b> his <i>sukka</i>; <b>with wormwood</b> leaves, <b>one</b> may <b>not roof</b> his <i>sukka</i>. <b>What is the reason</b> for this distinction? <b>Since</b>
