### Part 1
<b>As</b> in <b>that</b> situation involving Rava and Rami <b>bar Ḥama, when they would stand before Rav Ḥisda,</b> after he taught them a <i>halakha</i> <b>they</b> would <b>quickly</b> review <b>the tradition</b> that they heard from him <b>together and</b> only <b>then analyze the rationale</b> of the tradition that they had received. Apparently, in the study of Mishna and the amoraic commentary on the Mishna there is a distinction between extensive and intensive study.

### Part 2
With regard to residence in the <i>sukka</i>, <b>Rava said: Drinking vessels</b> such as cups, which are usually clean, remain <b>in the <i>sukka</i>. Eating vessels</b> are taken <b>out of the <i>sukka</i></b> after use. <b>An earthenware jug and a wicker basket [<i>shaḥil</i> ]</b> that are used for drawing water are taken <b>outside the <i>sukka</i>. And a lamp</b> remains <b>inside the <i>sukka</i>, and some say</b> it is taken <b>outside the <i>sukka</i>.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And they do not disagree.</b> Rather, <b>this</b> opinion, that a lamp remains inside the <i>sukka</i>, is referring <b>to a large <i>sukka</i>,</b> where the lamp and its odor do not disturb those residing in the <i>sukka</i>. And <b>that</b> opinion, that the lamp is taken outside the <i>sukka</i>, is referring <b>to a small <i>sukka</i>,</b> where the lamp’s odor is offensive.

### Part 3
§ The mishna stated: If <b>rain fell,</b> it is permitted to leave the <i>sukka</i> from the point that it is raining so hard that the congealed dish will spoil. <b>It was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: The measure is <b>from when a congealed dish of pounded grain,</b> a dish ruined by even slight rainfall, <b>will spoil.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Abaye was sitting before Rav Yosef in the <i>sukka</i>. The wind blew and brought</b> with it <b>splinters</b> from the roofing, and they fell onto the food. <b>Rav Yosef said to him: Vacate my vessels from here,</b> and I will eat in the house. <b>Abaye said to him: Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that one remains in the <i>sukka</i> <b>until the congealed dish will spoil?</b> That is not yet the case. <b>He said to him: For me, since I am delicate,</b> this situation <b>is as if the congealed dish will spoil.</b>

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If <b>one was eating in the <i>sukka</i>, and rain fell,</b> and <b>he descended</b> from the <i>sukka</i> on the roof to eat in his house, <b>one does not burden him to ascend</b> back to the <i>sukka</i> once the rain ceases <b>until</b> after <b>he finishes his meal.</b> Similarly, if <b>one was sleeping under</b> the roofing of <b>the <i>sukka</i>, and rain fell, and he descended</b> to sleep in the house, <b>one does not burden him to ascend</b> back to the <i>sukka</i> once the rain ceases; rather, he may sleep in the house <b>until it becomes light.</b>

### Part 6
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is the correct reading of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Until one awakens [<i>sheyeor</i>],</b> spelled with an <i>ayin</i>, and once he awakens he returns to the <i>sukka</i> even in the middle of the night? Or is the correct reading: <b>Until it becomes light [<i>sheyeor</i>],</b> spelled with an <i>alef</i>, and he need not return to the <i>sukka</i> until morning? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that will resolve the matter from a related <i>baraita</i>: One need not return to the <i>sukka</i> <b>until it becomes light [<i>sheyeor</i>],</b> spelled with an <i>alef</i>, <b>and dawn</b> arrives. The Gemara asks: Why did the <i>baraita</i> repeat the arrival of light <b>two</b> times (Ritva)? <b>Rather, say</b> instead: <b>Until he awakens [<i>sheyeor</i>],</b> spelled with an <i>ayin</i>, <b>and the dawn</b> arrives. Both of the readings are accurate, as until one awakens and it becomes light he may remain in the house.

### Part 7
§ The mishna continues: The Sages <b>told a parable: To what is this matter comparable?</b> It is comparable to a servant who comes to pour wine for his master, and he pours a jug of water in his face. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Who poured</b> the water <b>in whose</b> face? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as it is taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>His master poured a jug</b> of water <b>on his face and said to him: I do not want your service.</b>

### Part 8
Apropos the fact that rain on <i>Sukkot</i> is an indication of divine rebuke, the Gemara cites several related topics. <b>The Sages taught: When the sun is eclipsed it is a bad omen for the entire world.</b> The Gemara tells <b>a parable. To what is this matter comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to a king of flesh and blood who prepared a feast for his servants and placed a lantern [<i>panas</i>] before them</b> to illuminate the hall. <b>He became angry at them and said to his servant: Take the lantern from before them and seat them in darkness.</b>

### Part 9
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says: When the</b> heavenly <b>lights,</b> i.e., the sun and the moon, <b>are eclipsed, it is a bad omen for the enemies of the Jewish people,</b> which is a euphemism for the Jewish people, <b>because they are experienced in their beatings.</b> Based on past experience, they assume that any calamity that afflicts the world is directed at them. The Gemara suggests <b>a parable:</b> This is similar <b>to a teacher who comes to the school with a strap in his hand. Who worries?</b> The child <b>who is accustomed to be beaten each and every day is</b> the one who <b>worries.</b>

### Part 10
<b>The Sages taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>When the sun is eclipsed, it is a bad omen for the</b> other <b>nations.</b> When <b>the moon is eclipsed, it is a bad omen for the enemies of the Jewish people.</b> This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the Jewish people calculate</b> their calendar primarily based <b>on the moon, and the</b> other <b>nations</b> calculate based <b>on the sun.</b> When the sun is <b>eclipsed in the east, it is a bad omen for the residents</b> of the lands of <b>the east.</b> When it is eclipsed <b>in the west, it is a bad omen for the residents</b> of the lands of <b>the west.</b> When it is eclipsed <b>in the middle of the sky, it is a bad omen for the entire world.</b>

### Part 11
If, during an eclipse, <b>the visage</b> of the sun <b>is</b> red <b>like blood,</b> it is an omen that <b>sword,</b> i.e., war, <b>is coming to the world.</b> If the sun <b>is</b> black <b>like sackcloth</b> made of dark goat hair, it is an omen that <b>arrows of hunger are coming to the world,</b> because hunger darkens people’s faces. When it is similar both <b>to this,</b> to blood, <b>and to that,</b> to sackcloth, it is a sign that both <b>sword and arrows of hunger are coming to the world.</b> If it was <b>eclipsed upon its entry,</b> soon after rising, it is an omen that <b>calamity is tarrying to come.</b> If the sun is eclipsed <b>upon its departure</b> at the end of the day, it is an omen that <b>calamity is hastening to come. And some say the matters are reversed:</b> An eclipse in the early morning is an omen that calamity is hastening, while an eclipse in the late afternoon is an omen that calamity is tarrying.

### Part 12
The Sages said: <b>There is no nation that is afflicted whose god is not afflicted with it, as it is stated: “And against all the gods of Egypt I will mete out judgment; I am God”</b> (Exodus 12:12). The Gemara adds: <b>When the Jewish people perform God’s will, they</b> need <b>not fear any of these</b> omens, <b>as it is stated: “Thus says the Lord: Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of Heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them”</b> (Jeremiah 10:2). <b>The nations will be dismayed, but the Jewish people will not be dismayed,</b> provided they do not follow the ways of the nations.

### Part 13
<b>The Sages taught</b> that <b>on account of four matters the sun is eclipsed: On</b> account of <b>a president of the court who dies and is not eulogized appropriately,</b> and the eclipse is a type of eulogy by Heaven; <b>on</b> account of <b>a betrothed young woman who screamed in the city</b> that she was being raped <b>and there was no one to rescue her; on</b> account of <b>homosexuality; and on</b> account of <b>two brothers whose blood was spilled as one.</b>

### Part 14
<b>And on account of four matters the</b> heavenly <b>lights</b> are <b>eclipsed: On</b> account of <b>forgers of a fraudulent document [<i>pelaster</i>]</b> that is intended to discredit others; <b>on</b> account of <b>testifiers of false testimony; on</b> account of <b>raisers of small domesticated animals in Eretz Yisrael</b> in a settled area; <b>and on</b> account of <b>choppers of good,</b> fruit-producing <b>trees.</b>

### Part 15
<b>And on account of four matters the property of homeowners is delivered to the monarchy</b> as punishment: <b>On</b> account of those <b>keepers of paid</b> promissory <b>notes,</b> who keep these documents instead of tearing them or returning them to the borrowers, as that would allow the lender to collect money with the note a second time; <b>and on</b> account of <b>lenders with interest;</b>
