### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who establishes his <i>sukka</i> beneath a tree,</b> it is <b>as though he established it inside the house</b> and it is unfit. If one established <b>a <i>sukka</i> atop</b> another <b><i>sukka</i>, the upper</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit and the lower</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is unfit. Rabbi Yehuda says: If there are no residents in the upper</b> <i>sukka</i>, <b>the lower</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rava said: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> that a <i>sukka</i> beneath a tree is unfit <b>only with regard to a tree whose shade is greater than its sunlight,</b> as the source of the shade in the <i>sukka</i> is the tree and not the roofing. <b>However, if its sunlight is greater than its shade,</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit,</b> as in that case the roofing provides the shade.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> does Rava reach this conclusion? The Gemara answers: He learns this <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> It is <b>as though he established it inside the house. Why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to teach:</b> It is <b>as though he established it inside the house? Let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> simply: It is <b>unfit. Rather, this is teaching us that</b> in the context of this <i>halakha</i>, <b>a tree is similar to a house; just as</b> with regard to <b>a house, its shade is greater than its sunlight, so too,</b> with regard to <b>a tree,</b> it invalidates the <i>sukka</i> only if <b>its shade is greater than its sunlight.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> even <b>if the sunlight is greater than the shade</b> of the tree, <b>what of it?</b> Why does Rava deem the <i>sukka</i> beneath the tree fit in that case? <b>Isn’t</b> there <b>unfit roofing,</b> the uncut branches of the tree, <b>joining together with</b> the <b>fit roofing</b> on the <i>sukka</i>, rendering even the fit roofing on the <i>sukka</i> unfit? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where one lowered</b> the uncut branches and combined them with the fit roofing so that the branches still attached to the tree are inconspicuous. Given that the majority of the roofing is fit, the roofing in its entirety is fit.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where he lowered them, what is</b> the purpose of <b>stating</b> this <i>halakha</i>? Isn’t it self-evident? The Gemara answers that it is necessary <b>lest you say: Let us issue a decree</b> and deem the roofing unfit in a case <b>where one lowered them due to</b> a case <b>where one did not lower them.</b> Therefore, <b>it teaches us that we do not issue</b> such <b>a decree.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>too, we</b> already <b>learned</b> in a mishna: <b>If one trellised the grapevine, the gourd, or the ivy,</b> climbing plants, over a <i>sukka</i> while they are still attached to the ground, <b>and</b> he then added <b>roofing atop them,</b> the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit,</b> as roofing attached to the ground is unfit. <b>If</b> the amount of fit <b>roofing was greater than</b> the plants attached to the ground, <b>or if he cut</b> the climbing plants so that they were no longer attached to the ground, <b>it is fit.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara clarifies the details of the mishna: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say</b> that it is referring to a case where <b>he did not lower</b> the climbing plants and combine them with the fit roofing, <b>doesn’t</b> the <b>unfit roofing join together with</b> the <b>fit roofing</b> on the <i>sukka</i>, rendering even the fit roofing on the <i>sukka</i> unfit? <b>Rather, isn’t</b> the mishna referring to a case <b>where he lowered them, and conclude from this</b> mishna <b>that we do not issue a decree</b> in a case where he lowered the branches due to a case where he did not lower the branches. Rava’s statement is therefore unnecessary. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say that this applies</b> only <b>after the fact,</b> i.e., that if one already lowered the uncut branches or plants it is not unfit, <b>but</b> one may <b>not</b> do so <b><i>ab initio</i>;</b> therefore, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that one may place roofing in this manner even <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 8
§ The mishna continues: If one established <b>a <i>sukka</i> atop</b> another <b><i>sukka</i>,</b> the upper <i>sukka</i> is fit and the lower <i>sukka</i> is unfit. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“In <i>sukkot</i> shall you reside”</b> (Leviticus 23:42), <b>and not in a <i>sukka</i> that is beneath</b> another <b><i>sukka</i>, and not in <i>sukka</i> that is beneath a tree, and not in a <i>sukka</i> that is inside a house.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara questions that derivation. <b>On the contrary,</b> the term <b>“in <i>sukkot</i>,”</b> which is written in the plural, <b>indicates two.</b> The conclusion should be that one sitting inside a <i>sukka</i> beneath a <i>sukka</i> fulfills the mitzva. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Although the term is vocalized in the plural, <b><i>basukkot</i> is written</b> without the <i>vav</i>, indicating a single <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> There are <b>times when both of</b> the <i>sukkot</i> one atop the other <b>are fit;</b> there are <b>times when both of</b> the <i>sukkot</i> <b>are unfit;</b> there are <b>times when the lower</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit and the upper</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is unfit;</b> and there are <b>times when the lower</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is unfit and the upper</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara elaborates: There are <b>times when both of</b> the <i>sukkot</i> one atop the other <b>are fit. What are the circumstances?</b> It is in a case <b>where</b> in the <b>lower <i>sukka</i> its sunlight is greater than its shade,</b> rendering the <i>sukka</i> unfit, <b>and</b> in <b>the upper <i>sukka</i> its shade is greater than its sunlight,</b> rendering the <i>sukka</i> fit. <b>And</b> the roofing of <b>the upper</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is within twenty</b> cubits of the ground. In that case, the roofing of the upper <i>sukka</i> is effective for both the upper <i>sukka</i> and the lower one.

### Part 12
There are <b>times when both of</b> the <i>sukkot</i> <b>are unfit. What are the circumstances?</b> It is in a case <b>where</b> in <b>both</b> <i>sukkot</i>, <b>their shade is greater than their sunlight, but the upper one is</b> more than <b>twenty cubits above</b> the roofing of the lower <i>sukka</i>, rendering it unfit. Since the roofing of the upper <i>sukka</i> is unfit, and it casts shade over the lower <i>sukka</i>, the lower <i>sukka</i> is also unfit.

### Part 13
There are <b>times when the lower</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit and the upper</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is unfit.</b>
