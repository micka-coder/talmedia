### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a roof</b> made of boards that are four handbreadths wide <b>upon which there is no</b> coat of <b>plaster, Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree with regard to the manner in which to render it fit. <b>Beit Shammai say: One moves</b> each board, and then it is considered as though he placed the board there for the sake of the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, <b>and one</b> then <b>removes one</b> board <b>from among</b> the boards and replaces it with fit roofing. <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> One need not perform both actions; rather, <b>one</b> must either <b>move</b> the boards <b>or remove one from among</b> them. <b>Rabbi Meir says: One</b> only <b>removes one from among</b> them <b>and does not move</b> the others.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> according to <b>Beit Hillel, their reason</b> for initially prohibiting this roof is <b>due to</b> the principle: <b>Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from that which has already been prepared. If one moves</b> the boards, <b>he performs an action.</b> Likewise, <b>if he removes one</b> of the boards <b>from among</b> them, <b>he</b> also <b>performs an action.</b> Therefore, in both cases, he prepared the roofing and the <i>sukka</i> is fit. <b>However,</b> with regard to the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, what is the rationale</b> for <b>their</b> prohibition against using the original ceiling for a <i>sukka</i>? <b>If</b> the rationale is also <b>due to</b> the principle: <b>Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from that which has already been prepared, one</b> action <b>should suffice.</b> Or <b>if</b> the rationale is <b>due to the decree of the roof,</b> lest one come to reside beneath a regular plastered ceiling inside a house, <b>removing one</b> board <b>from among</b> them should <b>suffice.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the rationale is <b>due to the decree of the roof, and this is</b> what <b>they are saying: Although one moves</b> the boards, <b>if he removes one</b> board <b>from among</b> them, <b>yes,</b> it is fit; <b>if not, no,</b> it is unfit. Moving the boards is inconsequential. Removing one board from among them is all that is necessary.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Meir says: One removes one from among</b> them <b>but does not move</b> the others. This indicates that the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir is</b> identical to the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> as according to the above explanation, Beit Shammai also hold that removing one of the boards and replacing it with fit roofing can render the <i>sukka</i> fit. It is unreasonable to say that Rabbi Meir would hold in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai, which is rejected.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> Rabbi Meir <b>is saying: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel do not disagree on this matter.</b> They agree that the boards are prohibited due to the decree of the roof and that only by removing one of the boards is the <i>sukka</i> rendered fit. Rabbi Meir disagrees with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda that there is a dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaching us?</b> Is it <b>that Rabbi Meir is of</b> the opinion that the Sages issued <b>the decree of the roof and Rabbi Yehuda is of</b> the opinion that the Sages did not issue <b>the decree of the roof? But didn’t they disagree about this once, as we learned</b> in the mishna above: <b>One</b> may <b>roof</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>with boards;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir prohibits</b> their use. The Gemara explained that the dispute is whether or not the Sages issued the decree of the roof.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> That is not the dispute, as <b>in the first clause,</b> i.e., in the earlier mishna, <b>we are dealing with</b> the case of <b>planed boards.</b> The rationale for their disagreement is not due to the decree of the roof; <b>but it is due to the decree of the vessels</b> that they <b>touched upon it.</b> The dispute is whether or not the Sages issued a decree prohibiting the use of planed beams in roofing the <i>sukka</i>, although as flat wooden vessels they are not susceptible to ritual impurity, lest one come to roof the <i>sukka</i> with vessels that are susceptible to ritual impurity.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according <b>to Rav Yehuda, who said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If <b>one roofed</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>with convex arrow</b> shafts, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>fit,</b> but if he roofed his <i>sukka</i> <b>with concave</b> arrow shafts, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit; and he did not issue a decree</b> and prohibit roofing with <b>convex</b> shafts <b>due to</b> the prohibition against roofing with <b>concave</b> shafts, <b>here too, let us not issue a decree</b> and prohibit roofing with <b>planed boards, due to</b> the prohibition against roofing with actual <b>vessels.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> according to Rav, <b>perforce you</b> must <b>say</b> that in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna <b>they disagree with regard to the decree of the roof, and in the latter clause,</b> i.e., this mishna as well, <b>they disagree with regard to the decree of the roof.</b> Once again, the question arises: <b>Why do I</b> need them to <b>disagree</b> about the same issue <b>twice?</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: Rather, <b>the latter clause</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who is saying to Rabbi Meir: Why do you prohibit</b> roofing <b>with boards?</b> Is it <b>due to the decree of the roof? That</b> is the <b>reason according to Beit Shammai, who are of</b> the opinion that the Sages issued the decree. <b>But,</b> contrary to your opinion, <b>Beit Hillel do not issue the decree. And Rabbi Meir said</b> to Rabbi Yehuda: <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to this matter</b> at all. These are not two separate disputes; rather, it is one extended dispute.

### Part 11
The Gemara continues to ask: <b>This</b> works out <b>well according to Rav, who said</b> that <b>the dispute is</b> specifically <b>in</b> a case where the boards <b>have four</b> handbreadths <b>in their</b> width. He says <b>that Rabbi Meir is of</b> the opinion that the Sages issued <b>the decree of the roof, and Rabbi Yehuda is not of</b> the opinion that the Sages issued <b>the decree of the roof. However, according to Shmuel, who said</b> that <b>the dispute is</b> specifically <b>in</b> a case where the boards <b>do not have four</b> handbreadths <b>in their</b> width, <b>but where they have four</b> handbreadths <b>in their</b> width, <b>everyone agrees that</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>is unfit,</b> and both Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda agree that the Sages issued the decree of the roof; if so, <b>in the latter clause</b> of the mishna, <b>with regard to what</b> matter <b>do they disagree?</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: One may not use boards of this sort for roofing his <i>sukka</i>. Even according to Rabbi Yehuda, a <i>sukka</i> roofed in that manner is unfit, due to the decree of the roof. However, here, in the latter clause, it is <b>with regard to negating</b> an existing <b>roof</b> that consists of boards of this sort, in order to render the <i>sukka</i> fit that <b>they disagree.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds:</b> The ceiling <b>is thereby negated,</b> by moving the boards, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that the ceiling <b>is not thereby negated</b> unless he also removes one beam from among them.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who roofs his <i>sukka</i> with</b> metal <b>skewers or with the long boards of the bed,</b> which compose its frame, <b>if there is space between</b> each one of <b>them equal to</b> the width of the skewers or the boards, and if he places fit roofing in those spaces, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>fit.</b> In the case of <b>one who hollows out</b> and creates a space inside <b>a stack of grain to establish a sukka for him,</b> it is <b>not a <i>sukka</i>.</b>

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Let us say,</b> based on the mishna, <b>that this will be a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, as it is stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed concerning the following matter: With regard to the domains of Shabbat, if <b>the breached</b> segment <b>is equal to the standing</b> segment, is it deemed a partition or not? <b>Rav Pappa said: It is permitted</b> to carry within the partition; as long as the breached segment is not greater, it is considered a solid partition. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: It is prohibited</b> to carry within the partition, unless the standing portion is greater. Apparently, from the mishna, even if the fit roofing is equal to the unfit skewers and boards, the <i>sukka</i> is fit, contrary to the opinion of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua.

### Part 15
The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> could have <b>said to you: What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Like</b> the skewers and the boards? It does not mean that the space between the skewers and boards equals the width of the skewers and boards themselves. It is referring to a case <b>where</b> the space is large enough so that the fit roofing can <b>enter and emerge</b> easily, i.e., it is wider than the unfit roofing. According to this interpretation, the mishna can be explained according to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, as well. The mishna agrees that even if the standing and breached areas are equal, the <i>sukka</i> is unfit.
