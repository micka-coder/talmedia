<b>and does not grip the box</b> of the phylacteries, which he may not touch while impure. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Ya’akov. And the Rabbis say: A person</b> may <b>take a brief nap with his phylacteries, but substantial sleep</b> is <b>not</b> permitted, and he will thereby avoid a seminal emission while donning phylacteries. <b>And how long is</b> the duration of <b>a brief nap?</b> It is <b>equivalent</b> to the time required for <b>walking one hundred cubits.</b>

### Part 2
Apropos the duration of a brief nap, the Gemara cites that <b>Rav said: It is prohibited for a person to sleep during the day longer than</b> the duration of <b>the sleep of a horse.</b> One who sleeps for longer is derelict in the study of Torah. <b>And how long is</b> the duration of <b>the sleep of a horse?</b> It is <b>sixty breaths</b> long.

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said: The sleep of</b> the <b>Master,</b> Rabba, is <b>like that of Rav, and that of Rav</b> is <b>like</b> the sleep <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And that of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi is <b>like that of</b> King <b>David, and that of</b> King <b>David</b> is <b>like that of a horse. And that of a horse is sixty breaths.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara relates: <b>Abaye would sleep</b> during the day <b>for</b> a period <b>equivalent</b> to the time it takes to <b>enter from Pumbedita to Bei Kuvei. Rav Yosef read</b> the following verse as <b>pertaining to</b> Abaye: <b>“How long will you sleep, sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?”</b> (Proverbs 6:9). Rav Yosef considered this dereliction in the study of Torah.

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who enters</b> his bed <b>to sleep during the day, if he wishes, he</b> may <b>remove</b> his phylacteries, and <b>if he wishes, he</b> may <b>leave</b> them in place. One who enters to sleep <b>at night removes</b> his phylacteries <b>and</b> may <b>not leave</b> them in place. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Natan. Rabbi Yosei says: The young</b> men must <b>always remove</b> them <b>and not leave</b> them in place while sleeping <b>because they are accustomed to impurity,</b> as they are more likely to experience a seminal emission.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say that Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b>it is prohibited</b> for <b>one who experienced a seminal emission to don phylacteries. Abaye said:</b> This is not so; rather, <b>we are dealing with young</b> men whose <b>wives are with them,</b> and the concern is <b>lest they</b> overlook the fact that they are donning phylacteries and inadvertently <b>come to engage in matters</b> to which they are <b>accustomed,</b> i.e., relations with their wives, which is certainly demeaning to the phylacteries.

### Part 7
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one forgot</b> that he was donning phylacteries <b>and engaged in relations with his phylacteries</b> in place, <b>he</b> may <b>grip neither the strap nor the box until he washes his hands, and</b> only then may he <b>remove</b> the phylacteries. This is <b>because the hands are active</b> and tend to inadvertently touch parts of the body that are unclean.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Apropos eating in the <i>sukka</i>, which is discussed in the previous mishna, this mishna relates: <b>An incident</b> occurred where <b>they brought a cooked dish to Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai</b> for him <b>to taste, and to Rabban Gamliel</b> they brought <b>two dates and a bucket of water. And they</b> each <b>said: Take them up to the <i>sukka</i></b> and we will eat them there.

### Part 9
In contrast, the mishna relates: <b>And when they gave Rabbi Tzadok less than an egg-bulk of food, he took</b> the food <b>in a cloth</b> for cleanliness; he did not wash his hands because in his opinion, one is not required to wash his hands before eating less than an egg-bulk. <b>And he ate it outside the <i>sukka</i> and did not recite a blessing after</b> eating <b>it.</b> He holds that one is not required to recite a blessing after eating less than an egg-bulk, as it is not satisfying, and it is written: “And you shall eat and be satisfied and bless the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 8:10). The Gemara will explain the halakhic rationale for each of these actions described.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara wonders: Is the mishna citing <b>an incident to contradict</b> the <i>halakha</i> cited in the previous mishna that one may eat or drink in the context of a casual meal outside the <i>sukka</i>? The incident involving Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai and Rabban Gamliel indicates that one may eat nothing outside the <i>sukka</i>. The Gemara answers: The mishna is <b>incomplete,</b> as it is lacking a significant element, <b>and it teaches the following: If one seeks to impose a stringency upon himself</b> and eat nothing outside the <i>sukka</i>, <b>he</b> may <b>be stringent, and there is no</b> element of <b>presumptuousness</b> in adopting that stringency. <b>And</b> there was <b>also an incident</b> supporting that ruling: <b>They brought a cooked dish to Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai</b> for him <b>to taste, and to Rabban Gamliel</b> they brought <b>two dates and a bucket of water,</b>
