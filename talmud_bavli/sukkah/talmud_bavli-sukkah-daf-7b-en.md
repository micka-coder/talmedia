### Part 1
If <b>one placed roofing over an alleyway that has a side post, it is fit</b> for use as a <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rava said: If one placed roofing over</b> upright <b>boards</b> surrounding <b>wells, it is fit</b> for use as a <i>sukka</i>. A well is usually at least four handbreadths wide and ten handbreadths deep. Therefore, it is considered a private domain, and it is prohibited to draw water from it on Shabbat, as that would constitute a violation of the prohibition to carry from a private domain into a public one. In order to permit drawing water from the well, the surrounding area must be partitioned off and rendered a private domain. For the benefit of Festival pilgrims, the Sages instituted a special leniency that full-fledged partitions need not be constructed around the well for this purpose. Rather, it is sufficient if there are four double posts at the four corners of the area surrounding the well. Since these symbolic barriers are considered partitions for the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, they are considered partitions for the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>sukka</i> on Shabbat as well.

### Part 3
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for Rava to state the <i>halakha</i> in each of the two similar cases, <b>as if he</b> had <b>taught us</b> only that the <i>sukka</i> is fit in the case of the <b>alleyway,</b> one could say that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that there are two full-fledged walls; however,</b> in the case of upright <b>boards</b> surrounding <b>wells, where there are not two full-fledged walls</b> and most of the area is breached, <b>say no,</b> it is not considered a fit <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 4
<b>And if he</b> had <b>taught us</b> only the case of upright <b>boards</b> surrounding <b>wells,</b> one could say that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> in that case <b>it is</b> in the <b>category of</b> a <i>sukka</i> with <b>four,</b> albeit virtual, <b>walls; however,</b> in the case where <b>one placed roofing over an alleyway, where it is not</b> in the <b>category of</b> a <i>sukka</i> with <b>four walls, say no,</b> it is not considered a fit <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 5
<b>And if he</b> had <b>taught us</b> only <b>these two</b> cases, to teach that a partition with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat is a partition with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>sukka</i>, one could say that it is due to the fact that one can derive a <i>halakha</i> <b>from a stringency,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, <b>to a leniency,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>sukka</i>; <b>however,</b> to derive a <i>halakha</i> <b>from a leniency to a stringency, say no.</b> Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach the third <i>halakha</i> with regard to a <i>sukka</i> consisting of two walls in the standard sense and a third wall measuring a handbreadth: Since the third wall is considered a wall with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>sukka</i>, a leniency, it is considered a wall with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, a stringency.

### Part 6
§ The mishna continues: <b>And</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>whose sunlight,</b> i.e., the sunlight that passes through the roofing, <b>is greater than its shade, is unfit.</b>

### Part 7
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that in the statement: <b>Whose sunlight</b> is greater than its shade,the reference is to sunlight that passes through <b>due to</b> sparse <b>roofing, and not</b> to the sunlight entering <b>due to</b> gaps in the <b>walls.</b> It is possible for a <i>sukka</i> to have more sunlight than shade due to sunlight passing through the sides and not the roofing, in which case the <i>sukka</i> is fit. <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says:</b> If the sunlight exceeds the shade the <i>sukka</i> is unfit, <b>even</b> if the sunlight is <b>due to</b> gaps in the <b>walls.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Yeimar bar Shelemya said in the name of Abaye: What is the rationale for</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “And you shall screen [<i>vesakkota</i>] the Ark with the curtain”</b> (Exodus 40:3). <b>The curtain is a partition</b> and not a covering over the Ark, <b>and</b> nevertheless, <b>the Merciful One calls it roofing [<i>sekhakha</i>]. Apparently, we require</b> the purpose of <b>a partition</b> to be <b>similar</b> to the purpose of <b>roofing;</b> just as the roofing must be mostly impermeable by sunlight, so must the partition.

### Part 9
<b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yoshiya, interpret the term: And you shall screen [<i>vesakkota</i>]? <b>That</b> term teaches <b>that we</b> should <b>bend</b> the top of the curtain <b>a bit so that it appears as roofing</b> over the Ark.

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and Rabbi Yoshiya, and Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Shimon, and Rabban Gamliel, and Beit Shammai, and Rabbi Eliezer, and <i>Aḥerim</i> all hold</b> that <b>we require</b> the <b><i>sukka</i></b> to be sturdy and fit for dwelling like <b>a permanent residence.</b>

### Part 11
Abaye cites the relevant statements of the <i>tanna’im</i> listed above. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi states this opinion, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Any <i>sukka</i> that does not have</b> an area of <b>four cubits by four cubits is unfit.</b> These are the dimensions of a permanent residence.

### Part 12
The fact that <b>Rabbi Yoshiya</b> holds that a <i>sukka</i> must be a permanent residence can be seen from <b>that which we stated,</b> that the walls must also be impermeable by sunlight like the walls of a permanent residence.

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> also holds that a <i>sukka</i> must be a permanent residence, <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>A <i>sukka</i> that is more than twenty cubits high is unfit; Rabbi Yehuda deems it fit.</b> As explained above, in constructing a <i>sukka</i> more than twenty cubits high, one cannot render his residence a temporary residence; rather, he must construct a sturdy permanent residence.

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Shimon</b> agrees, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The dimensions of a <i>sukka</i> are <b>two</b> walls <b>in the standard sense,</b> and <b>a third</b> wall that measures <b>even a handbreadth; Rabbi Shimon says: Three</b> of the walls must be walls <b>in the standard sense, and a fourth</b> wall is required that measures <b>even a handbreadth.</b> Apparently, a <i>sukka</i> must be surrounded on four sides like a permanent residence.

### Part 15
<b>Rabban Gamliel</b> holds that a <i>sukka</i> must be a permanent residence, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who establishes his <i>sukka</i> atop a wagon or atop a boat, Rabban Gamliel deems it unfit;</b> a mobile structure is not a permanent residence. <b>Rabbi Akiva deems it fit.</b> Apparently, Rabban Gamliel requires that a <i>sukka</i> be a permanent residence.

### Part 16
<b>Beit Shammai</b> agree, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: In the case of <b>one whose head and most of his</b> body <b>were in the <i>sukka</i> and his table was in the house, Beit Shammai deem</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>unfit,</b> since a small <i>sukka</i> is unfit for use and one cannot fulfill the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> with it. <b>And Beit Hillel deem it fit.</b> Apparently, Beit Shammai require that the <i>sukka</i> be similar to a permanent structure.

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> holds that a <i>sukka</i> must be a permanent residence, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: In the case of <b>one who establishes his <i>sukka</i> like a type of circular hut</b> whose walls slope down from the center and has no roof, <b>or</b> one <b>who rested</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>against the wall,</b> taking long branches and placing one end on the ground and leaning the other end against the wall, establishing a structure with no roof, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems it unfit because it does not have a roof, and the Rabbis deem it fit.</b> A permanent residence has a roof.

### Part 18
<b><i>Aḥerim</i></b> agree, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say: A <i>sukka</i> built</b> in a circular shape <b>like a dovecote is unfit, because it does not have corners,</b> and a permanent residence is one with corners.

### Part 19
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>a <i>sukka</i></b> that is <b>shaped like a furnace</b> and is completely round, <b>if its circumference has sufficient space for twenty-four people to sit in it, it is fit, and if not, it is unfit.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Rabbi Yoḥanan rule that the <i>sukka</i> must be so expansive? The Gemara answers: It is undoubtedly <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said: Any <i>sukka</i> that does not have</b> an area of <b>four cubits by four cubits is unfit.</b> Since he requires the <i>sukka</i> with the largest minimum dimensions, Rabbi Yoḥanan must hold in accordance with his opinion.

### Part 21
However, even if he holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the question arises: <b>Now, since</b> when <b>a person sits,</b> he occupies one <b>cubit</b> of space, the circumference required by Rabbi Yoḥanan for the <i>sukka</i> is twenty-four cubits. However, mathematically, for <b>every three handbreadths circumference</b> in a circle, <b>there is a diameter of</b> approximately one <b>handbreadth.</b> Consequently, rather than requiring a <i>sukka</i> that holds twenty-four people, a <i>sukka</i> that holds merely <b>twelve people</b> should <b>suffice,</b> since a <i>sukka</i> with a circumference of twelve cubits has a diameter of approximately four. In that case, why does Rabbi Yoḥanan require the <i>sukka</i> to have double the necessary circumference?
