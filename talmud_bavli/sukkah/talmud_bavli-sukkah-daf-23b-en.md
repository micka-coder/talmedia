### Part 1
<b>And once it dies, it contracts</b> to be more than three handbreadths from the roofing, and <b>it</b> does <b>not</b> enter <b>his mind</b> to fix it because it is not noticeable. In that case, the principle of <i>lavud</i> would not apply, and the result would be a wall that is less than the minimum requisite height.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Abaye</b> actually <b>say</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir is concerned about</b> potential <b>death</b> with regard to the <i>sukka</i> walls <b>and</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda is not concerned? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: With regard to the <b>daughter of an Israelite who married a priest and her husband went to a country overseas,</b> she may continue to <b>partake of <i>teruma</i></b> as the wife of a priest, as <b>the presumptive status</b> of her husband is <b>that he is alive?</b> Apparently, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the presumption is that one who is alive remains alive.

### Part 3
<b>And we raised a contradiction</b> from a different mishna: If one is leaving his place of residence, and in order to preclude a situation where his wife would have the status of a deserted wife he gives her a conditional bill of divorce and stipulates: <b>This is your bill of divorce</b> that will take effect <b>one hour prior to my death, it is prohibited for her to partake of <i>teruma</i> immediately</b> due to the concern lest he die in the next hour. Apparently, there is concern lest one die at any point.

### Part 4
<b>And Abaye said</b> in resolving the contradiction: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> mishna, where the presumption is that one who is alive remains alive, <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who is not concerned about</b> potential <b>death. That</b> mishna, where there is concern lest one die at any point, <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who is concerned about</b> potential <b>death.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara cites proof that these are the opinions of those <i>tanna’im</i>. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who purchases wine from among the Samaritans</b> and there is reason to suspect that <i>teruma</i> and tithes were not taken, and he is not in a position to separate <i>teruma</i>, he acts as follows. If there are one hundred <i>log</i> of wine in the barrels, <b>he says: Two <i>log</i> that I will separate in the future are <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the mandated average measure of <i>teruma</i> is one-fiftieth; <b>ten</b> <i>log</i> are <b>first tithe;</b> and a tenth of the remainder, which is <b>nine</b> <i>log</i>, are <b>second tithe. And he deconsecrates</b> the second tithe that he will separate in the future, transferring its sanctity to money, <b>and</b> he may <b>drink</b> the wine <b>immediately,</b> relying on the separation that he will perform later. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
