### Part 1
If he is one <b>who knows</b> how <b>to slaughter</b> an animal, <b>one may eat from</b> animals <b>that he slaughtered. Rav Huna said:</b> That is the <i>halakha</i> <b>provided that an adult is standing over him</b> overseeing the slaughter.

### Part 2
If he is one who <b>is able to eat an olive-bulk of grain, one distances</b> himself <b>four cubits from his feces and from his urine</b> before praying or reciting <i>Shema</i>, as the feces and urine of a child at that stage of development produce offensive odors like those of an adult. <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> That is the <i>halakha</i> <b>provided that</b> the minor <b>can eat</b> the olive-bulk of grain <b>in</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread. However, if it takes him longer, one need not distance himself before praying. <b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Yeiva, said: And with regard to an adult, even if he is unable to eat</b> an olive-bulk of grain <b>in</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread, one must distance himself from his feces before praying, <b>as it is written: “And he that increases knowledge, increases sorrow”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:18), meaning that as one grows older he becomes more flawed.

### Part 3
If he is one who <b>is able to eat an olive-bulk of roasted</b> meat, <b>one slaughters the Paschal lamb on his</b> behalf, and he is included in the group assembled to eat the Paschal lamb, <b>as it is stated: “According to every man’s eating</b> you shall make your count for the lamb” (Exodus 12:4). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Ability to consume an olive-bulk is insufficient to include him in the group; rather, he is not included <b>until he is able to discern</b> what he is <b>eating. How</b> is that determined? If <b>one gives him a pebble and he throws it</b> away, and if one gives him <b>a nut and he takes it,</b> he may be included in the group for eating the Paschal lamb.
