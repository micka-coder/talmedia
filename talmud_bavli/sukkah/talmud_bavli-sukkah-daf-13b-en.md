### Part 1
<b>Rather,</b> emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>say:</b> It is unfit <b>only when its origins, like its remnants,</b> are <b>one.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Mareimar taught:</b> With regard to <b>these bundles</b> of reeds <b>from Sura</b> that are bound for sale, <b>one</b> may <b>roof</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>with them. Although</b> the seller <b>bound them, he bound them merely to</b> ascertain <b>the number</b> more readily, and they will not remain bound.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Abba said:</b> With regard to <b>these huts</b> made <b>of willow branches, once their upper ties</b> holding them together <b>are undone,</b> they are <b>fit</b> roofing. The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t they</b> still <b>tied from below? Rav Pappa said:</b> Rabbi Abba is referring to a case <b>where he unties them</b> from below as well.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that Rabbi Abba is referring to a case <b>where one does not untie them</b> from below, they are fit for <i>sukka</i> roofing, as <b>any binding</b> that is <b>not destined to be moved is not considered a binding.</b> Since these huts are untied from above, were one to attempt to move them, they would fall apart.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>vegetables</b> about <b>which the Sages said: One fulfills his obligation</b> to eat bitter herbs <b>on Passover,</b> if they are spread over a source of ritual impurity imparted by a corpse, they <b>transmit ritual impurity,</b> and the impurity spreads to objects beneath them. <b>And,</b> nevertheless, the Sages decreed that <b>they do not serve as a barrier before the spread of ritual impurity.</b> The impurity breaches roofing made of these vegetables and rises upward, as if there were no covering over it. If one roofs a <i>sukka</i> with these vegetables, it is as if they were not there at all, <b>and they render a <i>sukka</i> unfit due to</b> the unfitness of <b>airspace.</b> Just as three handbreadths of airspace in the roofing renders a <i>sukka</i> unfit, so too, three handbreadths of these vegetables in the roofing renders a <i>sukka</i> unfit. <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Since when they dry they crumble and fall,</b> even while fresh, they are <b>as one that is not there.</b>

### Part 6
Apropos the statements of Rabbi Abba, the Gemara cites another. <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said:</b> In the case of <b>one who harvests</b> bunches of grapes <b>for the winepress,</b> these bunches <b>do not have handles.</b> The stems, which connect the grapes to the clusters, are not required for the production of wine. Therefore, their legal status is not that of a handle in terms of ritual impurity; they are merely waste. Consequently, if these stems come into contact with a source of ritual impurity, they do not become impure and they do not transmit impurity to the attached grapes.

### Part 7
<b>And Rav Menashya bar Gadda said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said:</b> In the case of <b>one who harvests</b> grain <b>for roofing</b> a <i>sukka</i>, the grain <b>has no handles.</b> The legal status of the straw is not that of a handle for the grain. Since his interest is roofing his <i>sukka</i>, he wants only the straw, which is fit roofing, and not the grain, which is unfit. Therefore, in this context, the straw does not facilitate moving the grain.

### Part 8
The Gemara notes: <b>The one who said</b> that in the case of one who <b>harvests</b> grain, the straw is not a handle, <b>all the more so</b> would he say so in the case of one who <b>harvests</b> grapes, <b>since</b> the stems <b>are not suitable for his</b> needs. Stems are not wanted in the winepress, <b>so that they will not absorb wine.</b> By contrast, <b>the one who said</b> in the case of one who <b>harvests</b> grapes <b>that it has no handles,</b> he said so only in that case; <b>however,</b> in the case of <b>one who harvests</b> grain, he would say that <b>it has handles, since</b> the grain attached to the straw <b>is suitable for his</b> needs. He can <b>roof</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>with them</b> and weigh down the straw, <b>so that it does not scatter</b> in the wind.

### Part 9
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that</b> the statement of <b>Rav Menashya bar Gadda is</b> subject to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Fig branches, and</b> there are <b>figs on them; vines, and</b> there are <b>grapes on them; straw, and</b> there are <b>stalks of grain on them; palm branches, and</b> there are <b>dates on them,</b> with regard to <b>them all, if the</b> amount of <b>waste is greater than</b> the amount of <b>the food,</b> a <i>sukka</i> roofed with them is <b>fit. And if not,</b> the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit. <i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> The <i>sukka</i> is unfit <b>until the</b> amount of <b>straw is greater than</b> the combined amount of the handbreadth of <b>the handles</b> attached to the food that is susceptible to ritual impurity <b>and the food.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara continues: <b>What, is it not</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to this: That</b> one <b>Sage,</b> <i>Aḥerim</i>, who said that the straw must be greater than the handles as well, <b>holds</b> that the produce designated for roofing <b>have handles; and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, who disagrees, <b>holds that they do not have handles?</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara notes: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abba,</b> who says that grape clusters harvested for the winepress do not have handles, but grain harvested for roofing does, <b>it is certainly</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> Clearly, he holds in accordance with the opinion of <i>Aḥerim</i>, who hold that grain harvested for roofing has handles. However, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Menashya bar Gadda,</b> who says that grain harvested for roofing does not have handles, <b>shall we say</b> that <b>it is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> and that he holds in accordance with the first <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>? <b>Rav Menashya</b> could have <b>said to you that everyone agrees:</b> With regard to <b>one who harvests</b> grain for <b>roofing,</b> the grain <b>does not have handles. And here</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>with what are we dealing?</b> It is a case <b>where one</b> initially <b>cut</b> the stalks <b>for food, and reconsidered</b> his plan <b>for them,</b> and decided to use them <b>for roofing.</b> Since initially, as food, the grain had handles, its status does not change despite his change of intent.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>If he cut them for food, what is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> that the grain has no handles? As a rule, grain has handles. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>once he reconsidered</b> his plan <b>for them</b> and decided to use them <b>for roofing, his</b> initial <b>intent was negated</b> and their legal status is like any other inedible roofing, and they consequently have no handles, the Gemara asks: <b>And was his</b> initial <b>intent negated in that</b> manner? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>All vessels</b>
