### Part 1
The Sages <b>taught</b> that he is exempt <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he did not</b> yet <b>fulfill</b> his obligation. <b>However,</b> if <b>he</b> already <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation and he carries the <i>lulav</i> out, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering. The Gemara asks: Is it possible to carry the <i>lulav</i> without fulfilling one’s obligation? <b>Didn’t he, from</b> the moment <b>that he lifted it, fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with it? Abaye said:</b> It is referring to a case <b>where he overturned it</b> and lifted it. One fulfills his obligation only when lifting it in the manner in which it grows.

### Part 2
<b>Rava said: Even if you say that</b> it is referring to a case where <b>he did not invert it, with what are we dealing here?</b> It is with a case <b>where he took</b> the <i>lulav</i> <b>out in a vessel</b> and did not fulfill his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t Rava the one who said</b> that <b>taking by means of another object is considered taking?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This applies only</b> when the addition is in <b>a deferential manner,</b> for wrapping or ornamentation. <b>But</b> if the addition is in <b>a degrading manner,</b> as in this case, where one places the <i>lulav</i> into a vessel and carries it that way, <b>no,</b> it is not considered taking.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei would say:</b> In the case of <b>a bird</b> sacrificed as <b>a burnt-offering that is found among</b> other <b>birds</b> in one of the corners of the altar, <b>and</b> the priest <b>thought that it was a bird</b> sacrificed as <b>a sin-offering and he ate it,</b> as sin-offerings are eaten by priests, <b>he is exempt</b> from liability to bring a guilt-offering for misuse of consecrated items. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Huna <b>teaching us?</b> Is it <b>that</b> if <b>one erred in the matter of a mitzva, he is exempt? This is</b> identical to <b>that</b> statement of Rabbi Yosei; what novel element is introduced by Rav Huna?

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: It is <b>lest you say</b> that <b>it is</b> only <b>there,</b> in the case of carrying the <i>lulav</i>, <b>that one who erred in a matter of a mitzva is exempt</b> and <b>that is</b> because <b>he performed a mitzva; however, here,</b> with regard to mistakenly identifying the bird-offerings, <b>where he erred in the matter of a mitzva but did not perform a mitzva</b> at all, <b>say no,</b> in that case he would not be exempt from liability to bring a guilt-offering. Therefore, Rav Huna <b>teaches us</b> that he is in fact exempt.

### Part 5
The Gemara <b>raises an objection. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> With regard to <b>one who slaughters the daily offering on Shabbat that is not properly inspected,</b> and a blemish is discovered that disqualifies the sacrifice, he unwittingly performed the prohibited labor of slaughtering on Shabbat. <b>He is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering, and he needs</b> to bring <b>a different daily offering.</b> Even though he erred in a matter of a mitzva, he is liable.

### Part 6
Rav Huna <b>said</b> in response to the objection: Proof may be cited, <b>except</b> not <b>from that</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>as it was stated concerning</b> that <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rav Shmuel bar Ḥatai said</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna Sava said</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashian said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> It is referring to <b>a case where they brought</b> the sheep for the daily offering <b>from a chamber</b> in which there were sheep <b>that are not inspected.</b> Since under no circumstances should one take a sheep for the daily offering from uninspected sheep, his error cannot be attributed to preoccupation with the mitzva. Therefore, although he was engaged in performance of a mitzva, he is not exempt from liability to bring a sin-offering.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A woman</b> may <b>receive</b> a <i>lulav</i> <b>from her son or from her husband and return it on Shabbat to the water</b> in which it had been placed. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: On Shabbat one may return</b> the <i>lulav</i> to the water; <b>and on the Festival one may</b> even <b>add</b> fresh water to the vessel so the <i>lulav</i> will not wilt; and <b>during</b> the intermediate days of <b>the Festival, one may</b> even <b>change</b> the water.

### Part 8
<b>A minor who knows</b> how <b>to wave</b> the <i>lulav</i> <b>is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>lulav</i></b> due to the requirement to train him in the performance of mitzvot.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna that a woman may receive the <i>lulav</i>, the Gemara asks: That is <b>obvious.</b> Why would it be prohibited? The Gemara answers that it is necessary to state this <b>lest you say: Since a woman is not subject to the obligation</b> of the four species, as it is a time-bound, positive mitzva, <b>say</b> that <b>she should not receive</b> the <i>lulav</i>, as for her, moving the <i>lulav</i> is tantamount to moving set-aside objects and would therefore be prohibited. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that it is permitted.

### Part 10
§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>A minor who knows</b> how <b>to wave</b> the <i>lulav</i> is obligated in the mitzva of <i>lulav</i>. <b>The Sages taught: A minor who knows how to wave</b> the <i>lulav</i> <b>is obligated</b> in the mitzva of <b><i>lulav</i>;</b> one who knows how <b>to wrap himself</b> in a garment, <b>is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>ritual fringes;</b> if he knows <b>to preserve</b> the sanctity of <b>phylacteries</b> in a state of cleanliness, <b>his father buys him phylacteries;</b> if he <b>knows</b> how <b>to speak, his father</b> immediately <b>teaches him Torah and <i>Shema</i>.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in this context, <b>what is</b> the <b>Torah</b> taught to a child who has just learned to speak? <b>Rav Hamnuna said:</b> It is referring to the verse: <b>“Moses commanded us Torah, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:4), underscoring the relationship between the Jewish people and the Torah. The Gemara asks further: <b>And what is <i>Shema</i></b> taught to a child who has just learned to speak? The Gemara answers: It is referring to the <b>first verse</b> of <i>Shema</i>.

### Part 12
The Sages continued: If the minor is one <b>who knows to protect his body</b> from ritual impurity, it is permitted to <b>eat ritually pure</b> food that came into contact <b>with his body.</b> If he is one who knows <b>to protect his hands</b> from ritual impurity, it is permitted to <b>eat ritually pure</b> food that came into contact <b>with his hands.</b> If he is one <b>who knows to be asked</b> and accurately clarify which objects he touched, his status is like that of an adult based on the following distinction: If the question was with regard to ritual impurity <b>in the private domain</b> and it is a case of <b>uncertainty,</b> the item in question is deemed <b>impure.</b> However, if the question was with regard to ritual impurity <b>in the public domain</b> and it is a case of <b>uncertainty,</b> the item in question is deemed <b>pure.</b> If the minor is a priest <b>who knows</b> how <b>to spread his hands</b> and recite the priestly benediction, <b>one distributes <i>teruma</i> to him in the granary</b> as one would to any other priest.
