### Part 1
<b>until the conclusion of the last day of the Festival. And if</b> before he hung the decorations <b>he stipulated with regard to them</b> that he will be permitted to use them even during the Festival, <b>everything is according to his stipulation,</b> and he is permitted to use them. Apparently, sheets may indeed be spread in the <i>sukka</i> for decorative purposes. The Gemara rejects this: There is no proof from the <i>Tosefta</i>, as <b>perhaps</b> the reference is to sheets spread <b>on the side</b> of the <i>sukka</i>. However, if they are spread beneath the roofing, it renders the <i>sukka</i> unfit.

### Part 2
§ Apropos decorations, <b>it was stated: <i>Sukka</i> decorations do not diminish the</b> height of the <b><i>sukka</i>.</b> Decorations hanging from the roofing are not considered part of the structure and therefore do not diminish the height of the <i>sukka</i>. If the roofing is more than twenty cubits above the ground, the decorations hanging within twenty cubits of the ground do not render the <i>sukka</i> fit. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> However, if the decorations are spread <b>on the side</b> of the roof, they are considered part of the structure and <b>diminish</b> the area. If the decorations render the interior of the <i>sukka</i> less than seven by seven handbreadths, the <i>sukka</i> is unfit.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates with regard to <b>Minyamin, the servant of Rav Ashi,</b> that <b>his shirt became wet [<i>itamisha</i>], and he spread it over the <i>sukka</i></b> to dry it. <b>Rav Ashi said to him: Take it down so that</b> people <b>will not say</b> that <b>they are roofing</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>with an item susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> The servant said to him: <b>But don’t they see that it is wet</b> and understand that I placed it there to dry? Rav Ashi replied: Take it down <b>once it is dry</b> is what <b>I am saying to you,</b> as then people are apt to think that it is part of the roofing.

### Part 4
<b>It was stated</b> with regard to <b><i>sukka</i> decorations,</b> e.g., sheets spread beneath the roofing to decorate the <i>sukka</i>, <b>that are removed from</b> the roofing <b>four</b> handbreadths, the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed whether they interpose between the roofing and the <i>sukka</i>. <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> The <i>sukka</i> remains <b>fit. Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna said:</b> It is <b>unfit.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna happened</b> to come <b>to the house of the Exilarch. Rav Naḥman,</b> who was the official in charge of the Exilarch’s household, <b>lodged them in a <i>sukka</i> whose decorations were removed from</b> the roofing <b>four handbreadths. They were silent and did not say anything to him,</b> even though in their opinion the <i>sukka</i> was unfit. Rav Naḥman <b>said to them: Did the Sages retract their halakhic</b> ruling? Does your silence indicate that you concede to my ruling? <b>They said to him: We are on the path to perform a mitzva and,</b> therefore, <b>we are exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>.</b> Therefore, it is permitted for us to sleep in this <i>sukka</i>. In terms of the <i>halakha</i>, our ruling is unchanged.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: It is permitted to sleep in</b> a bed with <b>netting inside the <i>sukka</i>, even though</b> the bed <b>has a roof, provided that</b> the netting <b>is not more than ten</b> handbreadths <b>higher</b> than the bed. In that case, the netting is not considered a tent in and of itself.

### Part 7
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear: One who sleeps in</b> a bed with <b>netting inside the <i>sukka</i> did not fulfill his obligation,</b> contrary to the statement that Rav Yehuda cited in the name of Shmuel. The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is a case <b>where</b> the netting <b>is more than ten</b> handbreadths <b>higher</b> than the bed and is considered a tent in and of itself.

### Part 8
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna: <b>One who sleeps beneath the bed in the <i>sukka</i> did not fulfill his obligation.</b> As the height of a typical bed is less than ten handbreadths, apparently, even if the covering beneath which one is sleeping in less than ten handbreadths high, it is a tent in and of itself and he does not fulfill his obligation. The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t Shmuel interpret</b> the mishna as referring <b>to</b> the case of <b>a bed ten</b> handbreadths <b>high?</b> Therefore, one who sleeps beneath the bed did not fulfill his obligation.

### Part 9
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is taught in the mishna: <b>Or</b> if <b>one spread</b> a sheet as a canopy <b>over the</b> frame of a <b>four-post</b> bed, the area in the <i>sukka</i> beneath the sheet is <b>unfit.</b> Apparently, a bed with certain types of netting is unfit. The Gemara answers: <b>There, too,</b> it is a case where the posts <b>are ten</b> handbreadths <b>high.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>But that is not</b> the way <b>it is taught, as it is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Naklitin</i> are two</b> posts <b>and <i>kinofot</i> are four</b> posts. If <b>one spread</b> a sheet <b>over four posts,</b> the area in the <i>sukka</i> beneath the sheet is <b>unfit;</b> if one did so <b>over two posts</b> the entire <i>sukka</i> is <b>fit, provided the two posts are not ten</b> handbreadths <b>higher than the bed.</b> This proves <b>by inference that</b> a sheet spread over <b>four posts</b> renders the area in the <i>sukka</i> beneath the sheet unfit <b>even if it is not ten</b> handbreadths <b>high.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>Four posts are different because they are fixed</b> in the bed and constitute a significant space even without the requisite height. The Gemara asks: <b>But a <i>sukka</i> atop</b> another <b><i>sukka</i> is fixed, and</b> yet <b>Shmuel said: As</b> the criterion for <b>its fitness, so too</b> is the criterion for <b>its unfitness.</b> The upper <i>sukka</i> renders the lower <i>sukka</i> unfit only if it is ten handbreadths high. The Sages <b>say</b> in distinguishing between the cases: <b>There,</b> in the case of a <i>sukka</i> atop another <i>sukka</i>, where the measurement is <b>in order to disqualify</b> the lower <b><i>sukka</i>, ten</b> handbreadths are required to render the upper <i>sukka</i> a separate entity. However, <b>here,</b> in the case of the four-post bed, <b>in order to consider</b> the covering <b>a tent, less than ten</b> handbreadths <b>is also</b> considered to be <b>a tent,</b> as it is fixed.

### Part 12
§ <b>Rav Taḥalifa bar Avimi said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: One who sleeps naked in</b> a bed with <b>netting</b> and is required to recite <i>Shema</i> <b>moves his head out from</b> beneath <b>the netting and recites <i>Shema</i>.</b> Although he is naked, the netting is considered like a garment; therefore, it is permitted to recite <i>Shema</i>.

### Part 13
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who sleeps naked in a bed with netting</b> may <b>not move his head out from</b> beneath <b>the netting and recite <i>Shema</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is a case <b>where</b> the netting <b>is ten</b> handbreadths <b>high.</b> In that case, it is considered a tent and not a garment.

### Part 14
The Gemara notes: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to understand the <i>baraita</i> in that manner <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>: <b>To what is this comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to one standing naked in</b> his <b>house, that he</b> may <b>not move his head out the window and recite <i>Shema</i>.</b> That is certainly ineffective. The fact that the <i>baraita</i> likens the bed with netting to a house indicates that it is netting at least ten handbreadths high. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that this is the correct understanding.
