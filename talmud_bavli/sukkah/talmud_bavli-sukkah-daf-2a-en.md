### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A <i>sukka</i>,</b> i.e., its roofing, which is the main and most crucial element of the mitzva, <b>that is more than twenty cubits high is unfit. Rabbi Yehuda deems it fit.</b>

### Part 2
Similarly, a <i>sukka</i> <b>that is not</b> even <b>ten handbreadths high, and</b> one <b>that does not have three walls, and</b> one <b>whose sunlight</b> that passes through its roofing <b>is greater than its shade are unfit.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> a similar <i>halakha</i> in a mishna <b>there,</b> in tractate <i>Eiruvin</i> (2a): In the case of <b>an alleyway that is higher than twenty cubits,</b> i.e., the beam that was placed across the end of an alleyway that opens into a public domain in order to permit carrying within the alleyway on Shabbat is higher than twenty cubits, <b>one</b> must <b>diminish</b> the height of the beam in order to permit carrying within the alleyway. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says he need not</b> do so, and although the beam lies higher than twenty cubits, the alleyway is qualified to permit carrying within.

### Part 4
Given the seeming similarity between the two cases, that of the <i>sukka</i> and that of the alleyway, the Gemara asks: <b>What is different with regard to a <i>sukka</i> where</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that it is <b>unfit, and what is different with regard to an alleyway where</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the method of <b>rectification,</b> that one must diminish the height of the cross beam? Why was a solution not suggested in the case of a <i>sukka</i>?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: With regard to <b><i>sukka</i>,</b> since it is a mitzva <b>by Torah law,</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that it is <b>unfit,</b> as, if it is not constructed in the proper manner, no mitzva is fulfilled. However, with regard to <b>an alleyway,</b> where the entire prohibition of carrying is only <b>by rabbinic law,</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the method of <b>rectification,</b> as the cross beam comes only to rectify a rabbinic prohibition but does not involve a mitzva by Torah law.

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests an alternative explanation: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>even</b> with regard to matters prohibited <b>by Torah law,</b> it would have been appropriate for the mishna to teach a method of <b>rectification. However,</b> with regard to <b><i>sukka</i>, whose matters are numerous, it categorically teaches</b> that it is <b>unfit.</b> Merely diminishing the height of a <i>sukka</i> is insufficient to render it fit; the <i>sukka</i> must also satisfy requirements governing its size, its walls, and its roofing. Teaching the remedy for each disqualification would have required lengthy elaboration. With regard to <b>an alleyway,</b> however, <b>whose matters are not numerous,</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the method of <b>rectification.</b> Once the height is diminished, it is permitted to carry in the alleyway.

### Part 7
§ After clarifying its formulation, the Gemara addresses the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna and asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> i.e., the <i>halakha</i> that a <i>sukka</i> may not exceed a height of twenty cubits, derived?

### Part 8
<b>Rabba said</b> that it is derived <b>as the verse states: “So that your future generations will know that I caused the children of Israel to reside in <i>sukkot</i></b> when I took them out of the land of Egypt” (Leviticus 23:43). In a <i>sukka</i> <b>up to twenty cubits</b> high, even without a concerted effort, <b>a person is aware that he is residing in a <i>sukka</i>.</b> His eye catches sight of the roofing, evoking the <i>sukka</i> and its associated mitzvot. However, in a <i>sukka</i> that is <b>more than twenty cubits high, a person is not aware that he is residing in a <i>sukka</i> because his eye does not</b> involuntarily <b>catch sight</b> of the roof, as at that height, without a concerted effort one would not notice the roofing.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that it is derived <b>from here:</b> The verse states: <b>“And there shall be a <i>sukka</i> for shade in the daytime from the heat,</b> and for refuge and cover from storm and from rain” (Isaiah 4:6). In a <i>sukka</i> <b>up to twenty cubits</b> high, <b>a person is sitting in the shade of the <i>sukka</i>,</b> i.e., the shade of the roofing; in a <i>sukka</i> that is <b>more than twenty cubits high, a person is not sitting in the shade of</b> the roofing of <b>the <i>sukka</i> but rather in the shade of the walls</b> of the <i>sukka</i>, as their considerable height provides constant shade, rendering the shade of the roofing irrelevant.

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said to him: But if</b> it is <b>so</b> that one is required to sit in the shade of the roofing of the <i>sukka</i>, then in the case of <b>one who makes his <i>sukka</i> in Ashterot Karnayim,</b> which is located between two mountains that prevent sunlight from reaching there, <b>so too,</b> it <b>is not a</b> fit <b><i>sukka</i>,</b> since he is not sitting in the shade of the roofing.

### Part 11
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him:</b> The two cases are not comparable; <b>there,</b> if one theoretically <b>removes</b> the <b>Ashterot Karnayim</b> mountains that obstruct the sunlight, <b>there is</b> still the <b>shade of the</b> roofing of the <b><i>sukka</i>.</b> In that case, the <i>sukka</i> is properly constructed and there are only external factors that affect the sunlight. However, <b>here,</b> in the case of a <i>sukka</i> that is more than twenty cubits high, if one theoretically <b>removes the walls</b> of the <i>sukka</i>, <b>there is no shade</b> provided <b>by the</b> roofing of the <b><i>sukka</i>,</b> since throughout the day sunlight will enter the <i>sukka</i> beneath the roofing from where the walls used to be.

### Part 12
<b>Rava said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from here: “In <i>sukkot</i> shall you reside seven days”</b> (Leviticus 23:42). <b>The Torah said:</b> For <b>the entire seven days, emerge from the permanent residence</b> in which you reside year round <b>and reside in a temporary residence,</b> the <i>sukka</i>. In constructing a <i>sukka</i> <b>up to twenty cubits</b> high, <b>a person</b> can <b>render his residence a temporary residence,</b> as up to that height one can construct a structure that is not sturdy; however, in constructing a <i>sukka</i> <b>above twenty cubits high, one cannot render his residence a temporary residence; rather,</b> he must construct a sturdy <b>permanent residence,</b> which is unfit for use as a <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 13
<b>Abaye said to him: But if</b> that is <b>so,</b> then if <b>he constructed</b> a <i>sukka</i> with <b>steel partitions and placed roofing over them, so too,</b> there, say that <b>it would not be a</b> fit <b><i>sukka</i>,</b> as any <i>sukka</i> constructed as a permanent residence would be unfit. However, there is no opinion that deems a <i>sukka</i> of that sort unfit.

### Part 14
Rava <b>said to him</b> in response that <b>this is what I am saying to you:</b> In a case where one constructs a <i>sukka</i> <b>up to twenty cubits</b> high, a height <b>that a person</b> typically constructs <b>a temporary residence, when he constructs</b> a structure of that height that is sturdy like <b>a permanent residence, he also fulfills</b> his obligation. However, in a case where one constructs a <i>sukka</i> <b>more than twenty cubits high,</b> a height <b>that a person</b> typically constructs <b>a permanent residence,</b> even <b>when he constructs it</b> in a less sturdy fashion <b>like a temporary residence, he does not fulfill his obligation.</b>
