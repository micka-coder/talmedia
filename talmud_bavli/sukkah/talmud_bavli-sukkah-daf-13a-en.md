### Part 1
<b>their odor grows offensive</b> over time, <b>one abandons</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>and exits.</b> It is inappropriate to establish a <i>sukka</i> in which it is impossible to remain.

### Part 2
Similarly, <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>these thorns and shrubs, one</b> may <b>roof</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>with them. Abaye said: With thorns, one</b> may <b>roof</b> his <i>sukka</i>; <b>with shrubs, one</b> may <b>not roof</b> his <i>sukka</i>. <b>What is the reason</b> for this distinction? <b>Since their leaves fall</b> over time and they are apt to fall into the food and disturb those in the <i>sukka</i>, <b>one abandons</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>and exits.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>this offshoot of the</b> trunk of the <b>palm tree,</b> from which several branches emerge; <b>one</b> may <b>roof the <i>sukka</i> with it. Although</b> the branches <b>are</b> naturally <b>bound, a binding at the hand of Heaven is not considered a binding.</b> Furthermore, <b>although one then binds</b> the branches together at the end removed from the trunk, where they grow apart into separate branches, and roofs with them, the <i>sukka</i> is fit, since if <b>one binds</b> a bundle that is already bound <b>into one</b> unit <b>it is not considered a binding.</b>

### Part 4
Likewise, <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Ravina bar Sheila said:</b> With regard to <b>these offshoots of reeds, one</b> may <b>roof the <i>sukka</i> with them. Although</b> the branches <b>are</b> naturally <b>bound, a binding at the hand of Heaven is not considered a binding.</b> Furthermore, <b>although one then binds</b> the reeds together at the other end, the <i>sukka</i> is fit, since if <b>one binds</b> a bundle that is already bound <b>into one</b> unit <b>it is not considered a binding.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara notes that <b>this</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>reeds and spades, one</b> may <b>roof</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>with them.</b> The Gemara asks: The fact that one may roof his <i>sukka</i> with <b>reeds</b> is <b>obvious.</b> After all, they meet all the criteria of fit roofing. Rather, <b>say:</b> With regard to <b>these offshoots of reeds, one</b> may <b>roof the <i>sukka</i> with them.</b>

### Part 6
§ Apropos the above <i>halakha</i>, the Gemara cites another statement that <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Ravina bar Sheila said: With these bitter herbs of a marsh, a person fulfills his obligation on Passover.</b>

### Part 7
<b>The Gemara raises an objection to his</b> opinion. With regard to every mitzva that requires use of hyssop, one takes standard <b>hyssop and neither a hyssop</b> that grows in <b>Greece, nor stibium hyssop, nor desert hyssop, nor Roman hyssop, nor</b> any other kind of <b>hyssop whose</b> name is accompanied by <b>a modifier.</b> The same should hold true for the mitzva of bitter herbs; bitter herbs of the marsh, whose name is accompanied by a modifier, are not the bitter herbs mentioned in the Torah.

### Part 8
<b>Abaye said</b> in response: There is a distinction between the cases. <b>Every</b> species <b>whose name was differentiated prior to the giving of the Torah,</b> i.e., the distinction between its different subspecies predated the Revelation at Sinai, <b>and the Torah</b> then <b>came and was particular about</b> one specific subspecies, <b>it is known that</b> the species <b>has</b> other subspecies identified with <b>a modifier</b> that are unfit for use in fulfilling the mitzva. <b>And these</b> bitter herbs, <b>their names were not differentiated prior to the giving of the Torah at all;</b> all the subspecies were known simply as bitter herbs. Therefore, when the Torah requires bitter herbs, one may fulfill the mitzva with all subspecies of bitter herbs.

### Part 9
<b>Rava said</b> a different explanation. Actually, the <b>name</b> of this plant <b>is merely bitter herbs</b> without a modifier. <b>And</b> the fact <b>that one calls them bitter herbs of the marsh is because they are</b> typically <b>found in the marsh.</b> Therefore, there is no reason that they may not be used to fulfill the mitzva on Passover.

### Part 10
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda said: If one bound one</b> item, even if he did so with a knot, <b>it is not considered a binding.</b> If one bound <b>three</b> items together, everyone agrees that <b>it is considered a binding.</b> If one bound <b>two</b> items, it is the subject of <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis, as we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to all matters that involve <b>the mitzva of hyssop,</b> the requirement is to have <b>three stalks</b> with their roots, <b>and on them three stems,</b> one on each stalk. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The <b>mitzva of hyssop</b> fundamentally requires <b>three stems.</b> If the bundle of hyssop was rendered incomplete, <b>its remnants</b> are fit for use with <b>two</b> stems. If all the stems broke, the hyssop is fit for use, as long as the <b>stumps of its</b> central stem remain <b>any size.</b>

### Part 11
<b>It enters our minds</b> to say: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> Rabbi Yosei said that for the bundle of hyssop to be fit for the mitzva after the fact <b>its remnants are two,</b> apparently <b>its origins</b> were <b>also two</b> stalks. <b>And</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the binding includes <b>three</b> plants, that is the requirement <b>for</b> the <b>mitzva</b> to be performed <i>ab initio</i>. <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Yosei</b> requires <b>three</b> plants only <b>for</b> the <b>mitzva</b> to be performed <i>ab initio</i>, conclude that <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with him, hold that failure to include <b>three</b> stalks in the bundle <b>renders it unfit</b> for the mitzva. Apparently, the Rabbis and Rabbi Yosei dispute whether it is two or three items that are necessary to be considered a binding.

### Part 12
The Gemara questions that understanding of the dispute. <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> With regard to the <b>hyssop</b> bundle, if <b>its origins</b> were <b>two</b> stalks <b>and its remnants are one,</b> it is <b>unfit. And it is fit only when its origins</b> were <b>three and its remnants are two.</b> Rather, <b>reverse</b> the opinions in the mishna: According <b>to Rabbi Yosei,</b> failure to include <b>three</b> stalks in the bundle <b>renders it unfit</b> for the mitzva; according <b>to the Rabbis, three</b> is the requirement <b>for</b> the <b>mitzva</b> to be performed <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 13
The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> supporting this understanding. <b>And this was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the <b>hyssop</b> bundle, if <b>its origins</b> were <b>two</b> stalks <b>and its remnants</b> are <b>one,</b> it is <b>fit. And it is unfit only when its origins and its remnants</b> are <b>one.</b> Clearly, this is the opinion of the Rabbis.

### Part 14
The Gemara questions the end of the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>its remnants</b> are <b>one,</b> it is <b>unfit? Didn’t you say</b> in the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> that if <b>its remnants</b> are <b>one</b> it is <b>fit?</b>
