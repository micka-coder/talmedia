### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one distanced the roofing from the walls</b> of the <i>sukka</i> at <b>a distance of three handbreadths</b> the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit,</b> because three handbreadths of open space, even adjacent to the walls, render the <i>sukka</i> unfit.

### Part 2
In the case of <b>a house that was breached,</b> creating a hole in the middle of the roof, <b>and one roofed over</b> the breach, <b>if from the wall to the roofing there are four</b> or more <b>cubits</b> of the remaining original roof, <b>it is an unfit</b> <i>sukka</i>. If the roofing is less than four cubits from the wall, the <i>sukka</i> is fit, based on the principle of curved wall; the remaining intact ceiling is considered an extension of the vertical wall.

### Part 3
<b>And likewise,</b> in the case of <b>a courtyard that is surrounded</b> on three sides <b>by a portico,</b> which has a roof but no walls, if one placed roofing over the courtyard between the different sides of the portico and the roof of the portico is four cubits wide, the <i>sukka</i> is unfit. Similarly, <b>a large <i>sukka</i> that was surrounded</b> at the edge of its roofing <b>with material with which one</b> may <b>not roof</b> a <i>sukka</i>, e.g., vessels susceptible to ritual impurity, <b>if there are four cubits beneath</b> the unfit roofing, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit.</b> The principle of curved wall does not apply to unfit roofing that measures four cubits or more.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I need all these</b> cases based on the identical principle of curved wall? The Gemara explains: It is <b>necessary</b> to cite all the cases, <b>as, if</b> the mishna had <b>taught us</b> only the case of <b>the house that was breached,</b> I would have said that the principle of curved wall applies there <b>because those walls were established for the house.</b> Therefore, when the house is transformed into a <i>sukka</i>, the walls continue to serve their original function as walls of the <i>sukka</i>. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a courtyard surrounded</b> on each of the three sides <b>by a portico,</b> where its <b>walls were established not for the portico</b> but for the house that opens into the portico, and they happen to serve as the interior walls of the portico, I could <b>say no,</b> they are not considered as connected to the roofing at all. Consequently, it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to cite that case as well.

### Part 5
<b>And if</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only <b>these two</b> cases, one would have said that the principle of curved wall can apply <b>because</b> all of <b>their roofing is fit roofing,</b> and the preexisting roof of the house and the portico is unfit only due to the principle: Prepare it, and not from that which has already been prepared. <b>However,</b> here, in the case of <b>a large <i>sukka</i> that was surrounded</b> at the edge of its roofing <b>with material with which one</b> may <b>not roof</b> a <i>sukka</i>, where some its <b>roofing is unfit</b> and the fit roofing does not actually reach the wall, one could <b>say no,</b> the roofing is unfit. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to state that case as well.

### Part 6
§ <b>Rabba said: I found the Sages of the school of Rav, who were sitting and saying</b> in the name of Rav: <b>Space</b> without roofing <b>renders</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>unfit with</b> a measure of <b>three</b> handbreadths of space. However, <b>unfit roofing renders</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>unfit with</b> a measure of <b>four</b> handbreadths.

### Part 7
<b>And I said to them: From where</b> do <b>you</b> derive that <b>space renders</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>unfit</b> when it amount to <b>three</b> handbreadths? It is <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>one distanced the roofing from the walls</b> of the <i>sukka</i> <b>at a distance of three handbreadths,</b> the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit.</b> If, indeed, this mishna is the source of the <i>halakha</i>, <b>also</b> in the case of <b>unfit roofing, let it render</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>unfit only</b> if the roofing measures <b>four cubits, as we learned</b> in the same mishna: With regard to <b>a house that was breached and one roofed over</b> the breach, <b>if from the wall to the roofing there is four</b> or more <b>cubits</b> of the remaining original roof, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And they said to me:</b> Cite proof from the mishna, <b>apart from this</b> case, <b>as both Rav and Shmuel said that</b> in this case, the Sages in the mishna <b>touched upon</b> the principle of curved wall. In other words, the fact that this house is a fit <i>sukka</i> is unrelated to the minimum measure of unfit roofing. It is fit due to the principle of curved wall.

### Part 9
<b>And I said to them: What if</b> there <b>is</b> a <i>sukka</i> with <b>less than four</b> handbreadths of <b>unfit roofing and</b> an adjacent <b>space</b> of <b>less than three</b> handbreadths; <b>what</b> would be the status of the <i>sukka</i>? The <i>sukka</i> would be <b>fit,</b> since it lacks the minimum measure of both space and unfit roofing that renders a <i>sukka</i> unfit. If one then <b>filled</b> the space <b>with skewers, what</b> would be the status of the <i>sukka</i>? It would be <b>unfit,</b> as there would be more than four handbreadths of unfit roofing. <b>But shouldn’t space, which</b> is more stringent, as it <b>renders</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>unfit with</b> only <b>three</b> handbreadths, <b>be as</b> stringent as <b>unfit roofing, which renders</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>unfit</b> only <b>with four</b> handbreadths of unfit roofing?

### Part 10
<b>And they said to me: If so, according to you, who said</b> that <b>unfit roofing renders</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>unfit</b> only <b>with four cubits</b> of unfit roofing, the same question arises. <b>Just as, if there were</b> a <i>sukka</i> with <b>less than four cubits of unfit roofing and</b> an adjacent <b>space</b> measuring <b>less than three</b> handbreadths, <b>what</b> would be its status? It would be <b>fit.</b> If one then <b>filled</b> the space <b>with skewers,</b> what would be its status? It would be <b>unfit.</b> Here too, the question arises: <b>Shouldn’t space, which</b> is more stringent, as it <b>renders</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>unfit with</b> only <b>three</b> handbreadths of space, <b>be as</b> stringent as <b>unfit roofing, which renders</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>unfit with</b> only <b>four cubits</b> of unfit roofing?

### Part 11
<b>And I said to them: What is this</b> comparison? <b>Granted, according to</b> my opinion, <b>that I say</b> that the measure of unfit roofing that renders a <i>sukka</i> unfit is <b>four cubits,</b>
