### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda and Rav Eina</b> disagreed: <b>One</b> of them <b>teaches</b> that the celebration was called the Celebration of <b>Drawing [<i>sho’eva</i>] and one</b> of them <b>teaches</b> that it was called the <b>significant [<i>ḥashuva</i>]</b> celebration. <b>Mar Zutra said: The one who taught <i>sho’eva</i> is not mistaken, and the one who taught <i>ḥashuva</i> is not mistaken. The one who taught <i>sho’eva</i> is not mistaken, as it is written: “And you shall draw [<i>ushavtem</i>] water with joy</b> from the wells of salvation” (Isaiah 12:3), and its name reflects the fact that it is a celebration of the water libation. <b>And the one who taught <i>ḥashuva</i> is not mistaken, as Rav Naḥman said: It is a significant mitzva and</b> it originated <b>from the six days of Creation.</b>

### Part 2
§ <b>The Sages taught: The flute overrides Shabbat;</b> this is the <b>statement of Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda. And the Rabbis say: It does not override even a Festival. Rav Yosef said: The dispute is with regard to the song that</b> the Levites sang accompanying <b>the</b> daily <b>offering. As Rabbi Yosei</b> bar Yehuda <b>holds</b> that the <b>primary</b> essence of <b>song</b> is the accompaniment <b>by</b> musical <b>instruments,</b> and consequently these instruments <b>are</b> a component of the Temple <b>service and override Shabbat. The Rabbis hold</b> that the <b>primary</b> essence of <b>song</b> is singing <b>with the mouth, and</b> consequently the instruments <b>are not</b> a component of the <b>service;</b> they merely accompany the singing on occasion <b>and</b> therefore they <b>do not override Shabbat. However,</b> with regard to <b>the song of</b> the <b>Drawing</b> of the Water, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is rejoicing and</b> not a component of the Temple service; therefore <b>it does not override Shabbat.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yosef said: From where do I say that they disagree about this</b> matter? It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to Temple <b>service vessels that one crafted of wood, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> them <b>unfit and Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda deems</b> them <b>fit. What, is it not that they disagree with regard to this</b> matter? <b>The one who deems</b> the wooden vessel <b>fit holds</b> that the <b>primary</b> essence of <b>song is</b> accompaniment <b>by</b> musical <b>instruments, and we derive</b> that sacred vessels may be crafted of wood <b>from the</b> wooden <b>flute of Moses,</b> which according to this opinion was a service vessel. <b>And the one who deems</b> the wooden vessel <b>unfit holds</b> that the <b>primary</b> essence of <b>song</b> is singing <b>with the mouth, and</b> therefore <b>we do not derive</b> any <i>halakha</i> relevant to service vessels <b>from the</b> wooden <b>flute of Moses,</b> as according to this opinion it was not a service vessel. The Gemara rejects this explanation of the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 4
<b>No,</b> that is not necessarily the matter that they dispute, as one could say <b>that everyone agrees:</b> The <b>primary</b> essence of <b>song</b> is singing accompanied <b>by</b> musical <b>instruments. And here,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> whether <b>one derives</b> the <b>possible from</b> the <b>impossible</b> that <b>they disagree.</b> Can one establish a principle that applies in all cases based on a case with a unique aspect? <b>The one who deems</b> wooden service vessels <b>fit holds that one derives</b> the <b>possible,</b> i.e., Temple service vessels, <b>from</b> the <b>impossible,</b> i.e., the flute of Moses. Although there was no alternative to crafting the flute of Moses from wood, one may derive from this that sacred service vessels, even when the alternative to craft them from metal exists, may be crafted from wood. <b>And the one who deems</b> wooden service vessels <b>unfit holds that one does not derive the possible from the impossible.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead in rejection of Rav Yosef’s proof <b>that everyone agrees that</b> the <b>primary</b> essence of <b>song</b> is singing <b>with the mouth, and one does not derive the possible from the impossible. And here,</b> it is <b>with regard to deriving</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the Temple <b>candelabrum by means of</b> the hermeneutic principle of <b>generalizations and details or by means of</b> the principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions that they disagree. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>interprets</b> verses by means of the principle of <b>generalizations and details,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda interprets</b> verses by means of the principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>interprets</b> the verse “And you shall make a candelabrum of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candelabrum be made” (Exodus 25:31), by means of the principle of <b>generalizations and details. “And you shall make a candelabrum of,”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> as the material of the candelabrum is not specified; <b>“pure gold,”</b> that is <b>a detail,</b> limiting the material exclusively to gold; <b>“of beaten work shall the candelabrum be made,”</b> the verse <b>then generalized</b> again. The result is <b>a generalization and a detail and a generalization,</b> from which <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>that are similar to the detail; just as the detail is explicit</b> that the candelabrum is crafted <b>from</b> gold, which is <b>a metal, so too all</b> other materials used in crafting the candelabrum must be <b>of metal.</b> The candelabrum is a prototype for all other Temple service vessels.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda,</b> however, who deems wooden Temple service vessels fit, <b>interprets</b> verses by means of the principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions. “And you shall make a candelabrum of,”</b> is an <b>amplification,</b> as the material of the candelabrum is not specified; <b>“pure gold,”</b> is a <b>restriction,</b> limiting the material exclusively to gold; <b>“of beaten work shall the candelabrum be made,”</b> the verse <b>repeated and amplified.</b> The result is <b>amplification and restriction and amplification,</b> from which one derives <b>to amplify all</b> items except for those items most dissimilar to the restriction. <b>What did</b> the verse <b>amplify? It amplified all materials,</b> even wood. And <b>what did</b> the verse <b>exclude</b> with this restriction? <b>It excluded</b> a candelabrum crafted <b>of earthenware.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Rav Yosef stated that the dispute between Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda and the Rabbis concerning whether or not the flute overrides Shabbat and Festivals is based on the significance and the role of song in the sacrifice of offerings.
