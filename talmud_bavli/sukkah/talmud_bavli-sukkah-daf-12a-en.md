### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> that juxtaposition is the source of the <i>halakha</i>, say: <b>Just as the Festival peace-offering</b> is brought from <b>animals, so too</b> the <b><i>sukka</i></b> roofing should consist of <b>animals.</b> As that is clearly not the case, that verse cannot be the source for the roofing of the <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 2
The Gemara cites a different source: <b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “You shall prepare for you the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> for seven days <b>as you gather from your threshing floor and from your winepress”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13), and the Sages interpreted that it is <b>with regard to the waste of the threshing floor and of the winepress</b> that <b>the verse is speaking.</b> One uses grain stalks and vines for roofing the <i>sukka</i>, materials that are not susceptible to ritual impurity and grow from the ground.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that the verse teaches that one uses the items placed on the <b>threshing floor itself,</b> i.e., stalks with the grain still attached to them, <b>and the</b> items placed in the <b>winepress itself,</b> i.e., vines with the grapes still attached, as roofing. Grain and grapes, like all foods, are susceptible to ritual impurity. If the verse is interpreted in this manner, the mishna’s criteria for roofing fit for a <i>sukka</i> could not be derived from it. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: “Winepress” is written</b> in the verse <b>here,</b> referring to the wine, <b>and it is impossible to roof with</b> wine. Apparently, the verse is referring to stalks and sheaves but not to produce.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya strongly objects to this:</b> Why can’t a <i>sukka</i> be roofed with wine? <b>Say</b> that it is referring to <b>congealed wine that comes from Senir,</b> from Mount Hermon, <b>which is similar to a cake of figs.</b> Since it is possible to interpret the verse as referring to the use of food for roofing, the mishna’s criteria for roofing fit for a <i>sukka</i> could not be derived from it. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: This matter was in our hands,</b> as we assumed that we found the source in the Torah for the materials fit for roofing, <b>and Rabbi Yirmeya came and took an axe to it.</b> He destroyed the proof by raising the matter of congealed wine.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> One may nevertheless derive the ruling of the mishna from this verse: <b>“From your threshing floor,”</b> indicating an item that comes from the threshing floor, <b>but not</b> the items placed on the <b>threshing floor,</b> i.e., grain, <b>itself; “from your winepress,” but not</b> the items placed in the <b>winepress,</b> i.e., grapes, <b>itself.</b> The verse is referring the waste products of the produce placed on threshing floor and in the winepress.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that proof can be cited <b>from here: “Go forth to the mount and fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and the boughs of a dense-leaved tree</b> in order to make <i>sukkot</i> as written” (Nehemiah 8:15). From this verse, the materials for <i>sukka</i> roofing can be derived.

### Part 7
Apropos this verse, the Gemara asks: <b>These myrtle</b> branches <b>are</b> the same as <b>those</b> boughs of <b>a dense-leaved tree;</b> why does the verse mention both? <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that this is how it is to be understood. The term “myrtle branches” is referring to <b>a wild myrtle,</b> unfit for use as one of the four species, to be used <b>for the</b> roofing of the <b><i>sukka</i>. And</b> the term “boughs of <b>a dense-leaved tree”</b> is referring to the myrtle, whose leaves overlie each other, to be used <b>for the <i>lulav</i>,</b> the mitzva of the four species.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One</b> may <b>not roof</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>with bundles of straw</b> tied with rope, <b>or bundles of wood, or bundles of twigs. And</b> with regard to <b>all of</b> the bundles, <b>if one untied them,</b> they are <b>fit</b> for use in roofing the <i>sukka</i>, as their lack of fitness is due to the fact that the bundles are tied. <b>And</b> even when tied, <b>all of</b> the bundles are <b>fit for</b> use in constructing the <b>walls</b> of the <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Ya’akov said: I heard</b> explanations <b>from Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> for <b>two</b> similar <i>halakhot</i> of <i>sukka</i>: <b>One</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> in <b>this</b> mishna that bundles may not be used in roofing the <i>sukka</i>, <b>and the other</b> with regard to the mishna below, pertaining to <b>one who hollows out</b> space in <b>a stack of grain</b> by removing sheaves from the bottom of the stack <b>to establish a <i>sukka</i> for him.</b> In that case, the space is surrounded by grain on the sides and above, and therefore it is <b>not a <i>sukka</i>.</b>

### Part 10
The rationale for <b>one</b> of the <i>halakhot</i> is <b>due to the decree of the storehouse.</b> Although, fundamentally, the <i>sukka</i> is fit, the Sages issued a decree prohibiting its use, lest one come to use his storehouse as a <i>sukka</i> and fail to establish it properly. <b>And</b> the rationale for <b>one</b> of the <i>halakhot</i> is <b>due to</b> the principle: <b>Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from that which has already been prepared,</b> as no active preparation was performed. <b>And I do not know</b> at present <b>which of</b> the <i>halakhot</i> <b>is due to</b> the decree of the <b>storehouse and which of them is due to</b> the principle: <b>Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from that which has already been prepared.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: Let us see</b> and determine which rationale Rabbi Yoḥanan applied to each <i>halakha</i>; <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: For what</b> reason did <b>they say</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>not roof</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>with bundles of straw, and bundles of wood, and bundles of twigs?</b> It is because <b>sometimes a person comes from the field in the evening, and</b> he has <b>his bundle</b> of wood or straw <b>on his shoulder, and he lifts it and places it atop his</b> storage <b>shed to dry it. And,</b> when the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> arrives, <b>he reconsiders</b> and decides to use the shed as a <i>sukka</i> and the bundle on top of it <b>for roofing. And</b> in that case the roofing would be unfit, as <b>the Torah said: Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from that which has already been prepared.</b> From Rabbi Yoḥanan’s formulation, apparently it is unfit due to the decree lest one come to use his storehouse as a <i>sukka</i> and fail to establish it properly, not due to some fundamental prohibition. <b>From</b> the fact <b>that this</b> case of the bundles is prohibited <b>due to the decree of the storehouse, that</b> case of the stack of grain must be prohibited <b>due to</b> the principle: <b>Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from that which has already been prepared.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why was <b>Rabbi Ya’akov</b> unable to arrive at Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion based on the <i>halakha</i> cited in his name? The Gemara explains: It is because <b>he did not hear this</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba,</b> and there was no other proof.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The distinction of Rabbi Yoḥanan between these two cases is difficult. <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>bundles of straw and bundles of wood</b> are unfit roofing <b>due to the decree of the storehouse</b> and <b>not due to</b> the principle: <b>Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from that which has already been prepared?</b> Is that ultimately the principle underlying the decree of the storehouse? <b>And</b> on the other hand, in the case of <b>one who hollows a stack of grain,</b> is the <i>sukka</i> unfit <b>due</b> only <b>to</b> the principle: <b>Prepare</b> it, <b>and not from that which has already been prepared,</b> but <b>not due to the decree of the storehouse?</b> Rather, there is no distinction between the <i>halakhot</i> and both reasons apply to both.

### Part 14
The Gemara notes: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said to you,</b> in response to Rav Ashi, that it is not so because the <i>halakhot</i> are formulated differently in the respective <i>mishnayot</i>. <b>Here,</b> in the mishna pertaining to bundles, <b>where it teaches: One</b> may <b>not roof with them, it is <i>ab initio</i></b>
