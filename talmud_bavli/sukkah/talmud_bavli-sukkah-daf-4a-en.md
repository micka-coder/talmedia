### Part 1
<b>And even though he nullified them all,</b> intending that for the duration of the Festival the halakhic status of these cushions and blankets is nothing more than that of dirt, it is not deemed a fit nullification <b>because his intention is</b> rendered <b>irrelevant by</b> the opinions of <b>all other people.</b> People do not typically do so, so the action of one who does so is discounted.

### Part 2
If one placed <b>straw</b> on the floor of his <i>sukka</i> in order to diminish its height, <b>and</b> verbally <b>nullified it</b> by saying that he will not use it for another purpose, <b>it is a decrease</b> of halakhic significance, as the halakhic status of adding straw is like that of adding dirt to the <i>sukka</i> floor and diminishing its height. The same is true, <b>all the more so,</b> if he placed <b>dirt</b> on the <i>sukka</i> floor <b>and nullified it.</b>

### Part 3
A case where one placed <b>straw</b> on the <i>sukka</i> floor <b>and he does not intend to evacuate it</b> from there, although he did not nullify it, <b>and</b> a case where one placed <b>undesignated dirt</b> that was not nullified, <b>are</b> the subject of <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis</b> with regard to whether the actions alone are effective as nullification. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: In <b>a house</b> in which there is a corpse or an olive-bulk of a corpse, the <i>halakha</i> is that if there is a handbreadth of space between the corpse and the roof, the roof serves as a barrier that prevents the ritual impurity from spreading beyond the roof. However, if there is less than a handbreadth of space between the corpse and the roof, the roof does not serve as a barrier, and the ritual impurity spreads upward. In a house of that sort <b>where one filled</b> the space between the corpse and the roof <b>with straw or pebbles</b> mixed with clods of dirt, <b>and</b> then <b>nullified</b> the straw or dirt, <b>it is</b> effectively <b>nullified,</b> and the ritual impurity spreads upward.

### Part 4
By inference, if <b>he</b> explicitly <b>nullified it, yes,</b> it is nullified; if <b>he did not nullify it, no,</b> it is not nullified. <b>And it is taught concerning</b> this mishna in the <i>Tosefta</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> If one placed <b>straw</b> on the <i>sukka</i> floor <b>and he does not intend to evacuate it, its</b> halakhic status <b>is like</b> that of <b>undesignated dirt and</b> it is <b>nullified.</b> If he placed <b>dirt</b> on the <i>sukka</i> floor <b>and he does intend to evacuate it, its</b> halakhic status <b>is like</b> that of <b>undesignated straw, and it is not nullified.</b> Apparently, the <i>tanna’im</i> already discussed this matter.

### Part 5
If a <i>sukka</i> <b>was more than twenty cubits high, but</b> the ends of the <b>palm leaves [<i>hutzin</i>] fall within twenty cubits,</b> then the following distinction applies: <b>If</b> the <b>shade</b> provided solely by the leaves within twenty cubits of the ground <b>is greater than the sunlight</b> in the <i>sukka</i>, <b>it is fit. If not, it is unfit.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara applies the same principle to the opposite case. In a case where the <i>sukka</i> <b>was</b> only <b>ten handbreadths high,</b> the minimum height for a fit <i>sukka</i>, <b>but</b> the ends of <b>the palm leaves fall within ten</b> handbreadths, <b>Abaye thought to say</b> that the same calculation applies here: <b>If the sunlight</b> in the <i>sukka</i> <b>is greater than</b> the <b>shade</b> provided by the leaves within ten handbreadths of the ground, meaning that those leaves do not constitute a fit <i>sukka</i> on their own, the <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rava said to him:</b> That calculation does not apply in this particular case, as, if the branches fall within ten handbreadths of the ground, <b>that is</b> considered <b>a sagging [<i>seruḥa</i>] residence, and a person does not reside in a sagging residence.</b> Therefore, it cannot even be considered a temporary residence.

### Part 8
If a <i>sukka</i> <b>was more than twenty cubits high and one built a</b> raised <b>platform in it opposite the entire middle wall,</b> as typically a <i>sukka</i> has three walls and the fourth side is open as an entrance, <b>and</b> the platform <b>has</b> an area of at least a bit more than seven by seven handbreadths, the minimum area required for <b>fitness of a <i>sukka</i>,</b> the <i>sukka</i> is <b>fit.</b> Since the seven-by-seven-handbreadth section from the platform to the roof has three walls and it is less than twenty cubits high, that section is a fit <i>sukka</i> in and of itself, and the rest of the <i>sukka</i> beyond the platform is fit as far as the roofing continues.

### Part 9
<b>And</b> if one built the platform <b>along the side</b> wall of the <i>sukka</i>, then the following distinction applies: <b>If there are four</b> or more <b>cubits from the edge of the platform to the</b> opposite <b>wall,</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>is unfit,</b> as the area of the platform has only two walls. However, if the distance to the opposite wall is <b>less than four cubits,</b> the <i>sukka</i> is <b>fit,</b> as the halakhic status of the roofing that covers the distance to the wall is that of a curved extension of the opposite wall.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>teaching us?</b> Is it <b>that we say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a curved wall</b> applies to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>sukka</i>? <b>We</b> already <b>learned</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a mishna (17a): In the case of <b>a house that was breached</b> by a hole in the middle of the roof, <b>and one roofed over</b> the breach, <b>if from the wall to the roofing there are four</b> or more <b>cubits</b> of the remaining original roof <b>it is</b> an <b>unfit</b> <i>sukka</i>. By inference, if the distance is <b>less than that, it is</b> a <b>fit</b> <i>sukka</i>. That is due to the <i>halakha</i> of a curved wall. The intact portion of the roof is considered an extension of the wall. As this <i>halakha</i> was already taught with regard to <i>sukka</i>, what is novel in the <i>halakha</i> of the platform?

### Part 11
The Gemara explains that there is indeed a novel element to the <i>halakha</i> of the platform. <b>Lest you say</b> that that one applies the <i>halakha</i> of a curved wall specifically <b>there,</b> in the case of a house that was breached, as the wall of the house <b>is suited to be the wall</b> of a <i>sukka</i> since it is less than twenty cubits high; <b>however, here,</b> in the case of the platform, <b>where</b> the opposite wall <b>is not suited to be the wall</b> of a <i>sukka</i> due to its excessive height, <b>say no,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a curved wall does not apply. Therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> that in the case of the platform too, the roof is considered an extension of the wall.

### Part 12
If the <i>sukka</i> <b>was more than twenty cubits high and one built a platform in the center of</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>if there is from the edge of the platform to the wall in each and every direction</b> a distance of <b>four cubits, it is unfit,</b> as the platform has no walls. If the distance is <b>less than four cubits,</b> then it <b>is fit.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>teaching us?</b> Is it <b>that we say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>curved wall</b> applies to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>sukka</i>? Then <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> identical to <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i>, as we already learned that the <i>halakha</i> of a curved wall applies.

### Part 14
The Gemara explains that there is indeed a novel element to the <i>halakha</i>. <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>we say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a curved wall</b> applies only <b>in one direction,</b> with regard to one wall of the <i>sukka</i>; <b>but in each and every direction</b> with regard to all the walls of the <i>sukka</i>, <b>no,</b> the <i>halakha</i> does not apply; therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> that this <i>halakha</i> may be applied to consider the roof as an extension of all four walls.

### Part 15
If the <i>sukka</i> <b>was less than ten handbreadths</b> high <b>and he dug</b> out an area <b>inside</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>in order to complete</b> the requisite height of the <i>sukka</i> <b>to ten</b> handbreadths, <b>if from the edge of the dug-</b>out <b>area to the wall there is</b> a distance of <b>three handbreadths, it is unfit,</b> as in that case the edge of the dug-out area is not joined to the wall of the <i>sukka</i>. Therefore, even though the interior space is ten handbreadths high, its walls are not the requisite height to be considered a fit <i>sukka</i>.
