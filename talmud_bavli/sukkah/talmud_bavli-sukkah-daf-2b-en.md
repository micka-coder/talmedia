### Part 1
The Gemara explains why each of the Sages cited his own source and did not accept the sources cited by the others. <b>All of them,</b> Rabbi Zeira and Rava, <b>did not say</b> that the fact that a <i>sukka</i> more than twenty cubits high is unfit is derived from the verse: “So that your future generations will know that I caused the children of Israel to reside in <i>sukkot</i> when I took them out of the land of Egypt” (Leviticus 23:43), <b>as</b> did <b>Rabba,</b> because in their opinion <b>that</b> verse does not mandate one to be aware that he is sitting in a <i>sukka</i>; rather, it mandates <b>knowledge for</b> future <b>generations</b> of the exodus from Egypt.

### Part 2
Similarly, <b>they,</b> Rabba and Rava, <b>also did not say</b> that it is derived from the verse: “And there shall be a <i>sukka</i> for shade in the daytime from the heat” (Isaiah 4:6), <b>as</b> did <b>Rabbi Zeira,</b> because in their opinion <b>it is</b> with regard <b>to the messianic era that this</b> verse <b>is written.</b> It means that God will be a shield and a shelter for the Jewish people; it is not referring to the structure of a <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Zeira,</b> how would he respond to this objection? The Gemara answers that Rabbi Zeira could say: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the verse is merely a metaphor, <b>let the verse say: And there shall be a canopy for shade in the daytime from the heat,</b> which is the term used in the previous verse. <b>And what is</b> the meaning of: <b>“And there shall be a <i>sukka</i> for shade in the daytime from the heat”? Learn from it two</b> matters: One is the plain meaning of the verse, that God will be a canopy of glory for the Jewish people, and the second is that the essence of a <i>sukka</i> is to have the roofing provide shade.

### Part 4
<b>They,</b> Rabba and Rabbi Zeira, <b>also did not say</b> that it is derived from the verse: “In <i>sukkot</i> shall you reside seven days” (Leviticus 23:42), <b>as did Rava, due to the difficulty</b> raised by <b>Abaye</b> with regard to a <i>sukka</i> with steel partitions. Since there is a weakness in each of the sources, it is understandable why the other Sages did not accept it.

### Part 5
§ The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rabbi Yoshiya said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis with regard to the fitness of a <i>sukka</i> more than twenty cubits high is specifically <b>in</b> a case <b>where the walls</b> of the <i>sukka</i> <b>do not reach</b> up to <b>the roofing; however,</b> in a case where <b>the walls</b> of the <i>sukka</i> <b>reach</b> up to <b>the roofing,</b> the Rabbis concede that <b>even</b> if the roofing is <b>more than twenty cubits high, it is fit. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is it?

### Part 6
It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba, who says</b> that the reason that a <i>sukka</i> that high is unfit is <b>because the eye does not</b> automatically <b>catch sight of</b> the roofing. <b>And since the walls</b> of the <i>sukka</i> <b>reach the roofing, the eye catches sight</b> of the roofing, as the person will follow the walls all the way up to the roofing despite their considerable height. However, if the roofing is not contiguous with the top of the walls, a person does not notice it without a concerted effort.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis with regard to the fitness of a <i>sukka</i> more than twenty cubits high is specifically <b>in</b> a case <b>where there is not</b> an area of <b>four cubits by four cubits in</b> the <i>sukka</i>; <b>however,</b> in a case where <b>there is</b> an area of <b>more than four cubits by four cubits in</b> the <i>sukka</i>, the Rabbis concede that <b>even</b> if the roofing is <b>more than twenty cubits high, it is fit. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is it?

### Part 8
It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zeira, who says that</b> a <i>sukka</i> that high is unfit <b>due to</b> the <b>shade</b> that is provided by the walls and not by the roofing; <b>and since</b> the <i>sukka</i> in this case <b>is spacious</b> and has a large area, <b>there is shade from the</b> roofing of the <b><i>sukka</i></b> and not only from the walls.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rav Ḥanan bar Rabba said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis with regard to the fitness of a <i>sukka</i> more than twenty cubits high is specifically <b>in</b> a case <b>where</b> the <i>sukka</i> is <b>only</b> large <b>enough</b> to <b>hold one’s head, most of his</b> body, <b>and his table,</b> as, if the <i>sukka</i> were smaller, it would not qualify as a <i>sukka</i>; <b>however,</b> in a case where <b>it</b> is sufficiently large to <b>hold more than one’s head, most of his</b> body, <b>and his table, even if it is more than twenty cubits high, it is fit. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is it? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of</b> any <b>one</b> of them. This statement cannot be explained according to any of the rationales for the fact that a <i>sukka</i> more than twenty cubits high is unfit.

### Part 10
With regard to the three aforementioned <i>halakhot</i>, the Gemara notes: <b>Granted,</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoshiya differs from</b> the statements <b>of Rav Huna and Rav Ḥanan bar Rabba, as they are providing the measure of the extent</b> of the <i>sukka</i> <b>while he is not providing a measure.</b> In Rabbi Yoshiya’s opinion, the <i>halakha</i> is based on whether the top of the walls reach the roofing, which indicates a fundamentally different understanding of the issue of a <i>sukka</i> more than twenty cubits high.

### Part 11
<b>However,</b> in terms of <b>Rav Huna and Rav Ḥanan bar Rabba, let us say that</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the minimum size required for <b>fitness of a <i>sukka</i></b> that <b>they disagree; as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Huna, <b>holds:</b> The minimum size required for <b>fitness of a <i>sukka</i> is four</b> by four <b>cubits, and</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> Rav Ḥanan bar Rabba, <b>holds:</b> The minimum size required for <b>fitness of a <i>sukka</i> is</b> one <b>that holds one’s head, and most of his</b> body, <b>and his table.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> there is no need to explain their dispute that way, <b>as</b> it could be explained that <b>everyone,</b> i.e., Rav Huna and Rav Ḥanan bar Rabba, <b>agrees</b> that <b>the</b> minimum size required for <b>fitness of a <i>sukka</i> is</b> one <b>that holds one’s head, and most of his</b> body, <b>and his table. And here,</b> it is <b>with regard to this</b> that <b>they disagree:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rav Ḥanan bar Rabba, <b>holds that</b> Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> only with regard to a <i>sukka</i> more than twenty cubits high in a case <b>where</b> it <b>holds the person’s head, and most of his</b> body, <b>and his table. However,</b> in a case where it is <b>larger than</b> one that holds <b>one’s head, and most of his</b> body, <b>and his table, everyone agrees</b> that the <i>sukka</i> is fit regardless of its height.

### Part 13
<b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Huna, <b>holds</b> that it is with regard to a <i>sukka</i> that ranges in size <b>from</b> one <b>that holds one’s head, and most of his</b> body, <b>and his table up to</b> one <b>that is four</b> by four <b>cubits</b> that <b>they disagree; however,</b> if the <i>sukka</i> is <b>more than four</b> by four <b>cubits, everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>fit.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A <i>sukka</i> that is more than twenty cubits high is unfit. Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>fit</b> even if it is <b>up to forty or fifty cubits</b> high.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving Queen Helene in Lod where her <i>sukka</i> was more than twenty cubits high, and the Elders were entering and exiting</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>and did not say anything to her</b> about the <i>sukka</i> not being fit. <br>The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> Is there <b>proof from there? She was,</b> after all, <b>a woman and</b> therefore <b>exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>.</b> Consequently, the fact that her <i>sukka</i> was not fit did not warrant a comment from the Elders. <br>Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to them</b> in response: <b>Didn’t she have seven sons</b> and therefore require a fit <i>sukka</i>? <b>And furthermore, she performed all of her actions only in accordance with</b> the directives of <b>the Sages.</b>

### Part 16
Before analyzing the objection being raised from the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara seeks to understand its content. <b>Why do I</b> need Rabbi Yehuda <b>to teach: And furthermore, she performed all of her actions only in accordance with</b> the directives of <b>the Sages?</b> His first contention was sufficient.

### Part 17
The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>is saying to them: If you say</b> that Helene’s sons <b>were minor sons and minors are exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>,</b> and that is why the Elders said nothing; <b>since they were seven</b> sons, then <b>it is not possible that there was not</b> at least <b>one among them who no longer needed his mother</b> to look after him. The <i>halakha</i> is that a minor who no longer needs his mother has reached the age of training and is required to fulfill the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> by rabbinic law. Even if she gave birth to them in consecutive years, the oldest would be seven years old, and at that age a child does not need his mother to constantly look after him.

### Part 18
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>a child who no longer needs his mother is obligated</b> in the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> only <b>by rabbinic law, and Queen Helene did not observe rabbinic law, come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which Rabbi Yehuda said: <b>And furthermore, she performed all of her actions only in accordance with</b> the directives of <b>the Sages.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara explores the statements of the <i>amora’im</i> who quoted Rav in light of this <i>baraita</i>. <b>Granted, according to the one,</b> Rabbi Yoshiya, <b>who said that</b> it is specifically <b>in</b> a case <b>where the walls</b> of the <i>sukka</i> <b>do not reach</b> up to <b>the roofing</b> that there is a <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, the <i>baraita</i> can be explained as dealing with a <i>sukka</i> of that type, as <b>it is customary for a queen to reside in a <i>sukka</i> in which the walls do not reach</b> up to <b>the roofing,</b>
