### Part 1
Rabbi Yosei could respond: <b>I include laundering, which</b> applies <b>equally to every person,</b> as everyone needs clean clothes, <b>and I exclude a remedy, which</b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>equally to every person;</b> it is only for the ill.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that which the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to Sabbatical-Year produce: <b>For food, and not for a remedy; for food, and not for sprinkling</b> wine in one’s house to provide a pleasant fragrance; <b>for food, and not to make it an emetic [<i>apiktoizin</i>]</b> to induce vomiting? <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as, if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, isn’t there also soaking and laundering</b> that should have been excluded in the <i>baraita</i>, as in their opinion, use of Sabbatical-Year produce for those purposes is prohibited?

### Part 3
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Sabbatical-Year</b> produce <b>is deconsecrated only by means of purchase;</b> however, it cannot be deconsecrated through redemption. Merely declaring that the sanctity of that produce is transferred to money or other produce is ineffective. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is deconsecrated <b>both by means of purchase and by means of redemption.</b>

### Part 4
<b>What is the rationale for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “In this year of Jubilee</b> you shall return every man unto his possession” (Leviticus 25:13), <b>and juxtaposed to it</b> it is written: <b>“And if you sell an item</b> to your neighbor” (Leviticus 25:14); this indicates that in the Jubilee Year, during which the <i>halakhot</i> of the Sabbatical Year are in effect, one deconsecrates the produce <b>by means of purchase and not by means of redemption.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan, what is the rationale for</b> his opinion? It is <b>as it is written: “For it is a Jubilee; it shall be consecrated</b> unto you” (Leviticus 25:12); this indicates that <b>just as</b> one redeems <b>consecrated</b> items <b>both by means of purchase and by means of redemption, so too, Sabbatical-Year</b> produce can be redeemed <b>both by means of purchase and by means of redemption.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan, what does he do with this</b> juxtaposition of the Jubilee Year to the verse: <b>“If you sell an item”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He needs it</b> to derive a <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> that statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: Come and see how severe</b> even the <b>hint of</b> violation of the prohibition of <b>the Sabbatical Year is;</b> as the prohibition against commerce with Sabbatical-Year produce is not one of the primary prohibitions of the Sabbatical Year, and its punishment is harsh. <b>A person</b> who <b>engages in commerce with Sabbatical-Year produce</b> is <b>ultimately</b> punished with the loss of his wealth to the point that he is forced to <b>sell his movable property and his vessels, as it is stated: “In this year of Jubilee</b> you shall return every man unto his possession” (Leviticus 25:13), <b>and juxtaposed to it,</b> it is written: <b>“And if you sell an item</b> to your neighbor” (Leviticus 25:14).

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Elazar, what does he do with this verse</b> from <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> derived his opinion? The Gemara answers: <b>He needs it</b> to derive <b>in accordance with</b> that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“For it is a Jubilee; it shall be consecrated</b> unto you” (Leviticus 25:12); <b>just as</b> the sanctity of <b>consecrated</b> items <b>takes effect on money</b> or objects in exchange for which <b>they</b> are redeemed, <b>so too,</b> the sanctity of <b>Sabbatical-Year</b> produce <b>takes effect on money</b> or objects in exchange for which <b>it</b> is redeemed.

### Part 7
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> The Gemara elaborates that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar: Sabbatical-Year</b> sanctity <b>takes effect on money</b> or objects in exchange for which the produce is redeemed, <b>as it is stated: “For it is a Jubilee; it shall be consecrated</b> unto you”; <b>just as</b> the sanctity of <b>consecrated</b> items <b>takes effect on money</b> or objects in exchange for which <b>they</b> are redeemed <b>and</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to use the money for non-sacred purposes, <b>so too,</b> the sanctity of <b>Sabbatical-Year</b> produce <b>takes effect on money</b> or objects in exchange for which <b>it</b> is redeemed, <b>and</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to use this money for purposes for which Sabbatical-Year produce may not be used.

### Part 8
<b>Or</b> perhaps extend the analogy and derive that <b>just as</b> the sanctity of <b>consecrated</b> items <b>takes effect on money</b> or objects in exchange for which <b>they</b> are redeemed, and the consecrated item <b>assumes non-sacred</b> status, <b>so too,</b> the sanctity of <b>Sabbatical-Year</b> produce <b>takes effect on money</b> or objects in exchange for which <b>it</b> is redeemed, and the Sabbatical-Year produce <b>assumes non-sacred</b> status. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It shall be</b> consecrated unto you,” meaning: <b>It shall be as it is.</b> Although the sanctity of Sabbatical-Year produce takes effect on the money, the produce remains consecrated as well.

### Part 9
The Gemara explains: <b>How so?</b> If <b>one purchased meat with Sabbatical-Year produce, both this,</b> the produce, <b>and that,</b> the meat, <b>must be removed during the Sabbatical Year.</b> The meat may be eaten only as long as the produce in exchange for which it was purchased may be eaten, i.e., as long as produce of that kind remains in the field. However, if he <b>purchased fish</b> in exchange <b>for the meat, the meat emerges</b> from its consecrated status, <b>and the fish assumes</b> consecrated status. If he then <b>purchased wine</b> in exchange <b>for the fish, the fish emerges</b> from its consecrated status, <b>and the wine assumes</b> consecrated status. If <b>he purchased oil</b> in exchange <b>for the wine, the wine emerges</b> from its consecrated status, <b>and the oil assumes</b> consecrated status.

### Part 10
<b>How so? The last</b> item purchased <b>assumes</b> the consecrated status of produce <b>of the Sabbatical Year, and the produce itself</b> remains consecrated and <b>forbidden</b> and never loses its consecrated status. The Gemara notes: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> each case using the term: <b>Purchased, purchased, apparently</b> it means that <b>by means of transaction, yes,</b> the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year takes effect; however, <b>by means of redemption, no,</b> the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year does not take effect.

### Part 11
The Gemara continues: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan. Both Sabbatical-Year</b> produce <b>and second-tithe</b> produce <b>are deconsecrated upon domesticated animals, undomesticated animals,and fowl, whether</b> they are <b>alive or whether</b> they are <b>slaughtered;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: Upon slaughtered</b> animals, <b>they are deconsecrated; upon</b> animals that are <b>alive, they are not deconsecrated.</b> The reason is that a rabbinic <b>decree</b> was issued <b>lest one raise flocks from them.</b> If one breeds a herd from that consecrated animal, the entire herd would be sacred and the potential for misuse of second-tithe property would be great.

### Part 12
<b>Rava said:</b> This <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis
