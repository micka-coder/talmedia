### Part 1
However, <b>two boards</b> placed on the <i>sukka</i> <b>do not combine. Rabbi Meir says: Even boards are like sheets,</b> in that they join together to constitute the measure of unfitness.

### Part 2
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Granted, according to Shmuel, who said</b> that <b>the dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Meir <b>is with regard to boards that do not have four</b> handbreadths <b>in their</b> width, <b>but</b> if <b>they have four</b> handbreadths <b>in their</b> width <b>everyone agrees that it is unfit; what</b> is the meaning of that which Rabbi Meir said: Boards <b>join together?</b> It means that boards less than four handbreadths wide <b>combine to</b> measure <b>four</b> handbreadths, which renders the <i>sukka</i> unfit.

### Part 3
<b>However, according to Rav, who said</b> that <b>the dispute is with regard to boards that have four</b> handbreadths <b>in their</b> width, <b>but</b> if <b>they do not have four</b> handbreadths <b>in their</b> width <b>everyone agrees that it is fit, what are the circumstances? If</b> each of the boards <b>has four</b> handbreadths in its width, <b>why must they join together</b> to render the <i>sukka</i> unfit? If each board is four handbreadths wide, each is capable of rendering the <i>sukka</i> unfit on its own. And if each of the boards <b>does not have four</b> handbreadths in its width, <b>why</b> would Rabbi Meir prohibit their use? <b>But aren’t they merely reeds</b> according to Rav? Just as one may roof the <i>sukka</i> with reeds, one should be permitted to roof the <i>sukka</i> with these narrow boards.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> explain <b>that there are four</b> handbreadths <b>in</b> the width of each board and each renders the <i>sukka</i> unfit on its own. However, <b>what</b> is the meaning of: Boards <b>join together?</b> It is with regard to a completely different matter. <b>They join together to</b> constitute <b>four cubits from the side.</b> If one placed these unfit boards adjacent to one of the walls of the <i>sukka</i>, they do not render the <i>sukka</i> unfit, due to the halakhic principle of curved wall, which views that roofing as an extension of that wall. However, that principle applies only up to four cubits of unfit roofing. If these boards join together to measure four cubits, the <i>sukka</i> is unfit according to Rabbi Meir. According to this explanation, the mishna can be explained in accordance with the opinion of Rav as well.

### Part 5
There is <b>another version</b> of the above exchange. <b>Granted, according to Shmuel, who said</b> that <b>the dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Meir <b>is with regard to boards that do not have four</b> handbreadths <b>in their</b> width, <b>but</b> if <b>they have four</b> handbreadths <b>in their</b> width, <b>everyone agrees that it is unfit, what</b> is the meaning of that which Rabbi Meir said: Boards <b>join together?</b> It means that <b>they join together to</b> constitute <b>four cubits from the side,</b> which renders the <i>sukka</i> unfit.

### Part 6
<b>However,</b> according <b>to Rav, granted,</b> according <b>to Rabbi Meir, what</b> is the meaning of: Boards <b>join together?</b> It means that <b>they join together to</b> constitute <b>four cubits from the side. However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said that even</b> if <b>they have four</b> handbreadths <b>in their</b> width, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>fit, what</b> is the meaning of: Boards <b>do not join together? They are merely reeds,</b> which is fit roofing and fit roofing that joins together remains fit roofing. The Gemara answers: <b>Since Rabbi Meir</b> used the phrase: <b>Join together, Rabbi Yehuda,</b> although it is irrelevant according to his opinion, also <b>said: Do not join together.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara notes: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> and <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel.</b>

### Part 8
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav:</b> If <b>one roofed</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>with cedar boards that do not have four</b> handbreadths <b>in their</b> width, <b>everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>fit.</b> If <b>there are four</b> handbreadths <b>in their</b> width, <b>Rabbi Meir deems it unfit and Rabbi Yehuda deems it fit.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There was <b>an incident during a time of danger,</b> when the gentiles decreed that it is prohibited for Jews to construct a <i>sukka</i>, at <b>which</b> point <b>we brought boards that had four</b> handbreadths <b>in their</b> width, <b>and we roofed the porch</b> with them so that it would not appear to be a <i>sukka</i>, <b>and we sat beneath them.</b> Evidently, boards four handbreadths wide are fit roofing for a <i>sukka</i>. <b>They said to him:</b> Is there <b>proof</b> be cited <b>from there?</b> There is <b>no proof</b> from actions performed during <b>a time of danger.</b> It is possible that the <i>sukka</i> that they built on the porch was unfit, and they built it merely to commemorate the mitzva that they were unable to fulfill. From this <i>baraita</i>, it is apparent that the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda is in a case of boards that are four handbreadths wide, in accordance with the opinion of Rav.

### Part 10
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel:</b> If <b>one roofed</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>with cedar boards that have four</b> handbreadths <b>in their</b> width, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit.</b> If <b>there are not four</b> handbreadths <b>in their</b> width, <b>Rabbi Meir deems it unfit and Rabbi Yehuda deems it fit. And Rabbi Meir concedes that, if</b> there is <b>between</b> one <b>board</b> and another <b>board</b> a gap the <b>complete</b> width <b>of a board,</b> then <b>one places</b> fit roofing from the <b>waste</b> of the threshing floor and the winepress, <b>and</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit. And Rabbi Yehuda concedes that if one roofed</b> the <i>sukka</i> with <b>a board that is four handbreadths wide</b> adjacent to one of the walls, the <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit</b> based on the principle of curved wall; <b>and,</b> nevertheless, <b>one</b> may <b>not sleep beneath</b> that board, <b>and one who sleeps beneath it does not fulfill his obligation.</b> In any event, there are two <i>baraitot</i>, each in accordance with one of the two views presented.

### Part 11
§ <b>It is stated</b> that there is an amoraic dispute: If <b>one turned</b> the unfit boards <b>on their sides,</b> and the width of the side is less than the measure that renders them unfit, do the boards remain unfit, or are they fit because in their current placement their width is narrower? <b>Rav Huna said:</b> The <i>sukka</i> <b>is unfit, and Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna said:</b> It is <b>fit.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Naḥman happened</b> to come <b>to Sura. Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna entered before him. They said to him:</b> If <b>one turned</b> these boards <b>on their sides</b> and roofed the <i>sukka</i>, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? They sought to ascertain whether his ruling is in accordance with their opinion or in accordance with the opinion of Rav Huna. <b>He said to them:</b> The <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit;</b> since the boards are unfit roofing when placed flat, <b>their</b> legal status <b>became like</b> that of <b>skewers [<i>shapudin</i>] of metal,</b> which are unfit under all circumstances.

### Part 13
When they related this encounter to Rav Huna, <b>Rav Huna said to them: Didn’t I tell you that you should say</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with my</b> opinion? Even Rav Naḥman agrees with me. <b>They said to him: And did the Master actually say a reason</b> for this ruling <b>to us, and we did not accept it from him?</b> Rav Naḥman not only issued a ruling, he also explained his ruling to us. <b>He said to them: And did you ask me for the reason and I did not say</b> it to <b>you?</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara notes: <b>Let us say that</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of Rav Huna: With regard to a <i>sukka</i> that <b>does not hold one’s head, most of his</b> body, <b>and his table;</b> a <i>sukka</i> whose wall <b>was breached with a breach large enough for a goat to jump through headlong,</b> i.e., three handbreadths; a <i>sukka</i> <b>that one placed atop</b> it <b>a board that is four handbreadths wide, even if he only introduced three handbreadths</b> of the board <b>into</b> the <i>sukka</i>, in all these cases, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit.</b>

### Part 15
<b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case where one introduces only three handbreadths of a board that is four handbreadths wide? <b>What, is it not that he turned</b> the board <b>on its side,</b> thereby diminishing its width from four to three handbreadths, in accordance with the opinion of Rav Huna? The Gemara rejects this: <b>No, with what are we dealing here?</b> It is a case <b>where one placed</b> the board <b>over the entrance of the <i>sukka</i>,</b> where there is no wall. <b>He introduced three</b> handbreadths <b>into</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>and took one</b> handbreadth <b>out</b> of the <i>sukka</i>, <b>so that</b> the legal status of that part of the board would <b>be like</b> that of <b>roofing that protrudes from the <i>sukka</i>, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that the legal status of <b>any roofing that protrudes from the <i>sukka</i> is considered like that of the <i>sukka</i>.</b> However, since this board is not adjacent to the wall of a <i>sukka</i>, the principle of curved wall does not apply. Therefore, it is four handbreadths of unfit roofing; it is prohibited to sleep beneath that board, and the entire <i>sukka</i> is rendered unfit. Consequently, there is no support for or against the opinion of Rav Huna from this <i>baraita</i>.
