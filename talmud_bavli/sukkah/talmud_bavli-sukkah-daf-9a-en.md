### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an old <i>sukka</i>, Beit Shammai deem it unfit</b> for the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> <b>and Beit Hillel deem it fit. And which is</b> considered <b>an old <i>sukka</i>?</b> It is <b>any</b> booth <b>that one established thirty days</b> or more <b>prior to the Festival</b> without expressly designating that it was for the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>. In that case, the assumption is that he constructed it for some other purpose. <b>However, if he established it</b> expressly <b>for the sake of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>even</b> if he constructed it <b>at the beginning of the</b> previous <b>year, it is fit</b> for use in the fulfillment of the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, even according to Beit Shammai.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai?</b> The Gemara explains that it is as <b>the verse states: “The festival of <i>Sukkot</i> is seven days unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:34), indicating that <b>we require a <i>sukka</i> established for the sake of the Festival.</b> A <i>sukka</i> not constructed expressly for the Festival is unfit.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>Beit Hillel</b> interpret this verse? The Gemara answers: In Beit Hillel’s opinion, <b>that</b> verse <b>is necessary to</b> teach <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Sheshet, as Rav Sheshet said in the name of Rabbi Akiva: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> use of <b>the wood of the <i>sukka</i> is prohibited</b> for any purpose other than for the <i>sukka</i> <b>all seven</b> days of the Festival, and it is designated exclusively for the mitzva? It is derived as <b>the verse states: “The festival of <i>Sukkot</i> is seven days unto the Lord.”</b>

### Part 4
<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in explanation that <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: Just as the name of Heaven takes effect upon the Festival peace-offering, so too, the name of Heaven takes effect upon the <i>sukka</i>, as it is stated: “The festival of <i>Sukkot</i> is seven days unto the Lord”; just as the Festival</b> offering <b>is</b> consecrated <b>to the Lord, so too, the <i>sukka</i> is</b> consecrated <b>to the Lord.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> don’t <b>Beit Shammai require</b> the verse <b>to</b> derive <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>as well?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, indeed it is so</b> that Beit Shammai derives the sanctity of the wood of the <i>sukka</i> from this verse. Therefore, the rationale for their opinion with regard to an old <i>sukka</i> must be based on a different verse.

### Part 6
<b>Rather, what is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai</b> with regard to an old <i>sukka</i>? <b>Another verse is written: “You shall prepare for you the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> for seven days”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13), from which it is derived that <b>we require a <i>sukka</i> established for the sake of the Festival.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>Beit Hillel</b> interpret this verse? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary to</b> teach <b>that one</b> may <b>establish a <i>sukka</i></b> even <b>during the intermediate days of the Festival.</b> If one failed to construct a <i>sukka</i> prior to the onset of the Festival, or if it collapsed during the Festival, he may establish it during the intermediate days, as the mitzva to establish a <i>sukka</i> is in effect for all seven days of the Festival.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where do <b>Beit Shammai</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? <b>They hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said: One</b> may <b>not establish a <i>sukka</i> during the intermediate days of the Festival.</b> Therefore, the requirement to build the <i>sukka</i> for the sake of the mitzva may be derived from this verse.

### Part 9
The Gemara proceeds to clarify Beit Hillel’s opinion: <b>And</b> do <b>Beit Hillel not</b> agree with the statement <b>that Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said? As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If <b>one fashioned</b> ritual fringes <b>from</b> hanging threads that remain protruding from the fabric like <b>thorns</b> after most of the superfluous threads were torn, and tied them into ritual fringes; <b>or</b> if he tied the fringes <b>from threads</b> that hang down after sewing; <b>or</b> if he tied them <b>from the fringes [<i>geradin</i>]</b> that hang from the bottom of a garment, the ritual fringes are <b>unfit</b> for fulfilling the mitzva. However, if the ritual fringes were tied <b>from balls of thread</b> that were not spun for the sake of the mitzva, they are <b>fit.</b>

### Part 10
And Rav Yehuda related: <b>When I stated this</b> <i>halakha</i> in the name of Rav <b>before Shmuel, he said to me: Even</b> ritual fringes tied <b>from balls of thread</b> are <b>unfit, as we require the spinning</b> of the thread to be <b>for the sake of</b> the mitzva. Just as the threads for the ritual fringes must be spun for the sake of the mitzva, <b>here too, let us require a <i>sukka</i> established for the sake of</b> the mitzva.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: It is <b>different there, as the verse states: “You shall prepare for you fringes”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), from which it is derived: <b>“For you,” for the sake of your obligation.</b> The fringes, from the beginning of their production, must be produced for the sake of the mitzva. The Gemara asks: <b>Here, too,</b> with regard to <i>sukka</i>, the verse says: <b>“You shall prepare for you the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:13). Shouldn’t it be derived: <b>“For you,” for the sake of your obligation?</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> term “for you” <b>is required to exclude</b> use of a <b>stolen</b> <i>sukka</i>; establish the <i>sukka</i> for you, and do not use a <i>sukka</i> belonging to another. The Gemara asks: <b>There, too,</b> with regard to ritual fringes, <b>isn’t</b> the term “for you” <b>required to exclude</b> use of <b>stolen</b> ritual fringes?

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to ritual fringes, <b>another verse is written: “And they shall make for them</b> ritual fringes” (Numbers 15:38), from which it is derived: “For them,” <b>of their own,</b> to exclude the use of stolen ritual fringes. Therefore from the term “for you,” it may be derived that ritual fringes must be produced for the sake of the mitzva.
