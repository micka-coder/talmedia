### Part 1
that is <b>thorny, split,</b> or <b>curved</b> to the extent that it is shaped <b>like a sickle</b> is <b>unfit.</b> If it became <b>hard</b> as wood it is <b>unfit.</b> If it merely appears <b>like hard</b> wood but is not yet completely hardened, it is <b>fit.</b> Apparently, a split <i>lulav</i> is unfit. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The split <i>lulav</i> in the <i>baraita</i> is so split that <b>it is shaped like a fork [<i>heimanak</i>],</b> with the two sides of the split completely separated, and it appears that the <i>lulav</i> has two spines.

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If it is <b>curved</b> to the extent that it is shaped <b>like a sickle,</b> it is unfit. <b>Rava said: We said</b> that it is unfit <b>only</b> when it is curved <b>forward</b> away from the spine; <b>however,</b> if it is curved <b>backward,</b> toward the spine, it is fit for use because that <b>is its nature,</b> and that is the way a <i>lulav</i> typically grows.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> The legal status of a <i>lulav</i> that is curved <b>to</b> either of <b>the sides is like</b> that of a <i>lulav</i> curved <b>forward,</b> and it is unfit. <b>And some say:</b> Its legal status <b>is like</b> that of a <i>lulav</i> curved <b>backward,</b> and it is fit.

### Part 4
<b>And Rava said: This <i>lulav</i> that grew with one leaf,</b> i.e., leaves on only one side of the spine, <b>is blemished and unfit.</b>

### Part 5
§ The mishna continues: <b>If the</b> palm <b>leaves were severed</b> from the spine of the <i>lulav</i>, it is unfit; if its leaves were spread, it is fit. <b>Rav Pappa said: Severed</b> means that the leaves are completely detached from the spine, and one ties them to the <i>lulav</i>, so <b>that</b> the <i>lulav</i> <b>is made like a broom. Spread</b> means that the leaves remain attached but are merely <b>separated</b> from the spine in that they jut outward.

### Part 6
Rav Pappa raised a dilemma: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>the</b> central <b>twin-leaf split?</b> The Gemara cites proof to resolve the dilemma. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> If <b>the</b> central <b>twin-leaf was removed,</b> the <i>lulav</i> <b>is unfit. What, is it not</b> that <b>the same is true if</b> the twin-leaf <b>split?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the case where it <b>was removed is different, because</b> the result is that <b>it is lacking,</b> and an incomplete <i>lulav</i> is certainly unfit. However, if the leaf remains in place, even though it is split, it does not necessarily render the <i>lulav</i> unfit.

### Part 7
<b>Some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> If <b>the</b> central <b>twin-leaf split, it becomes as</b> a <i>lulav</i> whose central <b>twin-leaf was removed, and</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> According to this version of the statement, the dilemma is resolved.

### Part 8
§ The mishna continues. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If the leaves were spread, one should bind the <i>lulav</i> from the top. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Tarfon</b> that the verse states: <b>“Branches [<i>kappot</i>] of a date palm.”</b> The Sages interpret the term to mean <b>bound [<i>kafut</i>],</b> indicating that <b>if</b> the leaves of the <i>lulav</i> <b>were spread, one should bind it.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: From where</b> is it ascertained <b>that this</b> term, <b>“branches of a date palm,” is</b> referring to the branches <b>of the <i>lulav</i>? Say</b> it is referring to <b>the hardened branch</b> of the date palm. Rav Ashi answered: That cannot be, as <b>we require</b> the <i>lulav</i> <b>to be bound, and there is no</b> binding, since at that stage the hardened leaves point outward, and binding them is impossible.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: If the fundamental requirement of the mitzva is a <i>lulav</i> that appears as one unit, <b>say</b> that one takes <b>the trunk</b> of the date palm. The Gemara answers: The term <b>bound,</b> from which it is derived that the branch should appear as one unit, <b>indicates that there is</b> the possibility that it could be <b>spread. However, this</b> trunk <b>is perpetually bound,</b> as it can never become separated.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> the verse is referring to <b>the branch of the date palm [<i>kufra</i>]</b> that has not yet hardened completely and could still be bound, albeit with difficulty. <b>Abaye said</b> that <b>it is written</b> in praise of the Torah: <b>“Its way are ways of pleasantness and all its paths are peace”</b> (Proverbs 3:17). At that stage of development, some of the leaves are thorns that potentially wound. The Torah would not command to use that type of branch in fulfilling the mitzva.

### Part 12
<b>Rava, the expert in <i>Tosefta</i>, said to Ravina:</b> Since the verse states “branches of a date palm” in the plural, <b>say</b> that one is obligated to take <b>two palm branches</b> in fulfilling the mitzva of the four species. Ravina answered: Although the word is vocalized in the plural, based on tradition <b><i>kappot</i> is written</b> without the letter <i>vav</i>, indicating that only one is required. The Gemara suggests: <b>And say</b> that one is required to take only <b>one</b> leaf? The Gemara answers: If that were the intention of the Torah, it would not have written <i>kappot</i> without a <i>vav</i>. <b>That</b> single leaf <b>is called <i>kaf</i>.</b> <i>Kappot</i> without the <i>vav</i> indicates both plural, i.e., multiple leaves, and singular, i.e., one branch.

### Part 13
§ The mishna continues: A <i>lulav</i> from the <b>palms of the Iron Mountain is fit.</b> It has few leaves on its spine, and those leaves are not crowded together like the leaves on a standard <i>lulav</i>. <b>Abaye said:</b> The Sages <b>taught that</b> this type of <i>lulav</i> is fit <b>only</b> in a case in which <b>the top of this</b> leaf <b>reaches the base of that</b> leaf above it on the spine. <b>However,</b> if there are so few leaves that <b>the top of this</b> leaf <b>does not reach the base of that</b> leaf, <b>it is unfit.</b>

### Part 14
<b>That was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>as well:</b> A <i>lulav</i> from the <b>palms of the Iron Mountain are unfit.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that it is <b>fit? Rather, learn from it in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Abaye,</b> that there is a distinction based on the configuration of the leaves on the <i>lulav</i>. Indeed, <b>learn from it.</b>
