<b>with</b> impurity imparted by <b>a grave</b> in <b>the depths.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava,</b> as <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: They would not bring doors at all, because a child has an</b> exaggerated <b>sense of self-confidence</b> and <b>perhaps he will extend his head or one of his limbs</b> beyond the edge of the door <b>and will become impure with</b> impurity imparted by <b>a grave</b> in <b>the depths. Rather, they would bring Egyptian oxen whose bellies are broad, and the children would sit upon them and</b> they would hold <b>cups of stone in their hands.</b> When <b>they reached the</b> Siloam pool <b>they descended and filled them, and ascended and sat themselves on</b> the <b>backs</b> of the oxen.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a bed, which</b> measures <b>several fistbreadths,</b> didn’t <b>we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: It was our custom that we would sleep beneath the bed before the Elders?</b> Apparently, despite the fact that a bed measures several handbreadths, its legal status is not that of a tent. The Gemara answers: <b>A bed is different, since it is designed</b> specifically <b>for</b> use <b>upon it;</b> therefore, the status of the space beneath it is not that of a tent. The Gemara asks: Aren’t <b>oxen</b> like those used to transport the children to bring water for the red heifer <b>also designated</b> specifically <b>for</b> use <b>upon them</b> and nevertheless, Rabbi Yehuda deems their spinal column and bellies a tent.

### Part 4
<b>When Ravin came</b> to Babylonia from Eretz Yisrael he said that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Oxen are different since they protect the shepherds in the sun from the sun, and in the rain from the rain.</b> Shepherds would lie beneath the bellies of the oxen as protection from the elements. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if an ox is rendered a tent because it provides protection, even if its primary designation is for use upon it, then the status of <b>a bed too</b> should be that of a tent, <b>since it protects shoes and sandals that</b> are placed <b>beneath it.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rather, Rava</b> rejected that explanation and <b>said: Oxen are different</b> and their status is that of a tent <b>since</b> their bellies and backs <b>are made to protect their innards, as it is stated: “With skin and flesh You have clothed me, and with bones and sinews You have knitted me together”</b> (Job 10:11). Since flesh and skin are mentioned in the verse as providing shelter, the status of the oxen is that of a tent.

### Part 6
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: In this case <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> conforms to <b>his reasoning, as he stated</b> elsewhere: <b>We require a <i>sukka</i></b> that is a <b>permanent residence.</b> The <b>bed</b> in a <i>sukka</i> <b>is a temporary residence, and the <i>sukka</i></b> is <b>a permanent tent; and a temporary tent does not come and negate a permanent tent.</b> The permanent <i>sukka</i> is significant and that significance supersedes any temporary structure within it. Therefore, in Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, the status of the bed is not that of a tent.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to <b>Rabbi Shimon, who also stated that we require a <i>sukka</i></b> that is a <b>permanent residence,</b> nevertheless, <b>a temporary tent comes and negates a permanent tent.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> and <b>that is</b> the point over which <b>they disagree.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds: A temporary tent comes and negates a permanent tent, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds: A temporary tent does not come and negate a permanent tent.</b>

### Part 8
The mishna relates that <b>Rabbi Shimon said,</b> contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda: There was <b>an incident involving Tavi, the</b> Canaanite <b>slave</b> of Rabban Gamliel who was sleeping beneath the bed, and Rabban Gamliel claimed that Tavi did so because he was a Torah scholar and knew that slaves are exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon said: From the conversation of Rabban Gamliel we learned two matters. We learned that</b> Canaanite <b>slaves are exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>, and we learned that one who sleeps beneath the bed did not fulfill his obligation.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara questions the formulation of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>And let</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>say: From the statement of Rabban Gamliel.</b> Why did he use the atypical expression: From the conversation of Rabban Gamliel? The Gemara answers: Through this expression <b>he teaches us</b> another matter <b>in passing, like that which Rabbi Aḥa bar Adda said, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Adda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Hamnuna said</b> that <b>Rav said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that even</b> the <b>conversation of Torah scholars require analysis,</b> even when the intention of the speaker was apparently not to issue a halakhic ruling? It is <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the righteous: “Which brings forth its fruit in its season <b>and whose leaf does not wither”</b> (Psalms 1:3). This teaches that with regard to a Torah scholar, not only is his primary product, his fruit, significant but even ancillary matters that stem from his conversation, his leaves, are significant.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who supports his <i>sukka</i> on the legs of the bed,</b> i.e., he leans the <i>sukka</i> roofing on a bed, the <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit. Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>cannot stand in and of itself</b> without support of the bed, <b>it is unfit.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> deeming this <i>sukka</i> unfit? <b>Rabbi Zeira and Rabbi Abba bar Memel disagree with regard to</b> the rationale. <b>One said:</b> It is unfit <b>because it lacks permanence.</b> The <i>sukka</i> is not stable enough, as if the bed is moved the <i>sukka</i> will collapse. <b>And one said:</b> It is unfit <b>because he is supporting</b> the roofing <b>with an object that is susceptible to ritual impurity,</b> as the bedframe is a vessel. Not only the roofing, but that which supports the roofing as well may not be susceptible to ritual impurity.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between them?</b> The Gemara explains: The difference is in a case <b>where one wedged iron skewers</b> into the ground <b>and roofed</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>upon them. According to the one who said</b> that the reason the <i>sukka</i> is unfit is <b>because it lacks permanence,</b> this <i>sukka</i> <b>has permanence,</b> and it is fit. However, <b>the one who said</b> the reason the <i>sukka</i> is unfit is <b>because he is supporting</b> the roofing <b>with an object that is susceptible to ritual impurity, he</b> is <b>supporting it with an object that is susceptible to ritual impurity,</b> so it is unfit.

### Part 13
<b>Abaye said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this dispute <b>only</b> in a case where <b>one leaned</b> the roofing on the bed. <b>However,</b> if <b>one placed the roofing atop the bed,</b> i.e., he affixed poles to the bed and the roofing is supported by those poles, everyone agrees that the <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit. What is the reason</b> that it is fit? <b>According to the one who said</b> that the <i>sukka</i> is unfit <b>because it lacks permanence,</b> this <i>sukka</i> <b>has permanence</b> as even if the bed is moved, the roofing will move with it and will not collapse. And <b>according to the one who said</b> the <i>sukka</i> is unfit <b>because he supports it with an object that is susceptible to ritual impurity,</b> in this case <b>he is not supporting it with an object that is susceptible to ritual impurity,</b> as the roofing is not supported by the bed.
