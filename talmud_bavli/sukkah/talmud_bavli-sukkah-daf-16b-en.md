### Part 1
<b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The partition that permits drawing water may be placed <b>below; and Beit Hillel said</b> it must be placed <b>above. Rabbi Yehuda said: A partition</b> for the cistern <b>should be no more</b> stringent <b>than the wall</b> serving as a partition <b>between</b> the two courtyards. Once there is a wall between courtyards, there is no need to erect an additional partition specifically for the cistern.

### Part 2
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Yehuda stated</b> his opinion <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, who said</b> that <b>a suspended partition permits</b> one to carry, and therefore the wall between the courtyards suffices to divide the cistern as well.

### Part 3
The Gemara rejects this equation. <b>And that is not so,</b> as <b>neither does Rabbi Yehuda hold in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, nor does Rabbi Yosei hold in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Neither does Rabbi Yehuda hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as Rabbi Yehuda states</b> his opinion that a suspended partition suffices <b>only there, with</b> regard to <b>the joining of the courtyards,</b> which is an obligation <b>by rabbinic</b> law. <b>However, here,</b> with regard to <b><i>sukka</i>,</b> which is <b>by Torah</b> law, a suspended partition does <b>not</b> suffice.

### Part 5
<b>Nor does Rabbi Yosei hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as Rabbi Yosei states</b> his opinion that a suspended partition suffices <b>only here, with regard to a <i>sukka</i>, which is a positive mitzva. However,</b> in the case of carrying between courtyards on <b>Shabbat, which is a prohibition</b> that is punishable by <b>stoning, no,</b> a suspended partition does not suffice.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And if you say:</b> Since Rabbi Yosei does not hold in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda with regard to the laws of Shabbat, <b>according to whose</b> opinion was the <b>action that was taken in Tzippori performed,</b> where they relied on suspended partitions even on Shabbat? The Gemara answers: It was <b>not</b> performed <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> but <b>rather on the authority of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And what</b> was that <b>incident? When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: One time they forgot and did not bring a Torah scroll</b> to the synagogue <b>on Shabbat eve</b> prior to the onset of Shabbat. <b>The next day,</b> on Shabbat, to avoid violating the prohibition against carrying, <b>they spread</b> and suspended <b>sheets on posts</b> that were fixed along the path from the house in which the Torah scroll was stored to the synagogue, establishing partitions. <b>And they brought a Torah scroll</b> along that path <b>and read from it.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> that <b>they spread</b> the sheets on Shabbat? Carrying before the partitions were established was prohibited. <b>From where did they bring</b> these sheets <b>on Shabbat? Rather, they found sheets</b> already <b>spread on the posts, and they brought a Torah scroll and read from it.</b> They relied on a suspended partition even in this matter related to Torah law. They relied neither on the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda nor on the opinion of Rabbi Yosei; rather, they relied on the authority of a third <i>tanna</i>.

### Part 9
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Avimi said: A mat</b> that is <b>four handbreadths and a bit</b> wide can <b>permit</b> the use of a <i>sukka</i> <b>as a wall.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>How does one accomplish</b> this? <b>He suspends it in the middle</b> of a space ten handbreadths high, with <b>less than three</b> handbreadths <b>below</b> it <b>and less than three</b> handbreadths <b>above</b> it. <b>And</b> the principle states: The legal status of <b>any</b> objects that have a gap of <b>less than three</b> handbreadths between them <b>is as if</b> they were <b>joined [<i>lavud</i>].</b> Therefore, a mat four handbreadths and a bit wide can constitute a fit partition of ten handbreadths.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious.</b> The principle of joining with regard to a gap of less than three handbreadths is well known. There is no need to teach this <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>we state</b> the principle of <b><i>lavud</i> once</b> with regard to a particular surface but <b>we do not state</b> the principle of <i>lavud</i> <b>twice</b> to consider it joined in different directions, Avimi <b>teaches us</b> that one may implement the principle twice.

### Part 11
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Avimi from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A mat</b> that is <b>seven handbreadths and a bit</b> wide can <b>permit</b> use of a <i>sukka</i> <b>as a wall.</b> Apparently, a mat can serve as the wall of a <i>sukka</i> only when the principle of joined objects is implemented once. The Gemara answers: <b>When that <i>baraita</i> was taught, it was with regard to a large <i>sukka</i>,</b> one considerably higher than ten handbreadths. One suspends the mat from a bit less than three handbreadths from the roofing, and it is considered a fit <i>sukka</i> wall although it is a significant distance off the ground. <b>And what does it teach us?</b> It teaches <b>that one</b> may <b>lower walls from up downward, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b>

### Part 12
Apropos forming a <i>sukka</i> wall based on the principle of <i>lavud</i>, the Gemara cites that <b>Rabbi Ami said: A board</b> that measures <b>four</b> handbreadths <b>and a bit</b> can <b>permit</b> the use <b>of a <i>sukka</i>,</b> serving <b>as a wall, and</b> it is effective if <b>one establishes it less than three</b> handbreadths <b>from the</b> adjacent <b>wall. And</b> the principle states: The legal status of <b>any</b> objects with a gap of <b>less than three</b> handbreadths between them <b>is as if</b> they were <b>joined.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>What is he teaching us?</b> The principle of <i>lavud</i> is well known. The Gemara answers: <b>He comes to teach us</b> that the minimum <b>measure</b> of the horizontal <b>extension</b> of the wall <b>of a small <i>sukka</i> is seven</b> handbreadths. Therefore, it is possible to establish a wall for the <i>sukka</i> using a board that measures four handbreadths and a bit.
