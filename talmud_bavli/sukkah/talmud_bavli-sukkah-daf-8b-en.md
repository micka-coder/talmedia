### Part 1
while the perimeter of <b>a square circumscribed by a circle</b> is smaller than the circumference of that circle by <b>half,</b> i.e., if one adds half the perimeter of the square to the perimeter of the square, that is equal to the circumference of its circumscribing circle. Therefore, a circle with a circumference of twenty-four cubits would circumscribe a square with a perimeter of sixteen cubits, as prescribed by Rabbi Yoḥanan. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> that <b>is not</b> the case, <b>as we see that</b> the circumference of the circumscribing circle <b>is not that much.</b> The actual circumference is closer to seventeen cubits.

### Part 2
§ <b>Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> With regard to <b>two craftsmen’s booths, one within the other,</b> as potters would build two booths, an inner one used as living quarters and an outer one for plying their craft and selling their wares, <b>the inner one is not</b> fit for fulfillment of the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>,</b> since the potter resides there year-round and it is not evident during the Festival that he is residing there for the sake of the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>. <b>And</b> since it a permanent residence, <b>it is</b> also <b>obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>mezuza</i>. And the outer</b> booth <b>is</b> fit for fulfillment of the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>,</b> since he does not reside there year-round, and when he resides there during the Festival it is evident that he is doing so for the sake of the mitzva. Since it is not designated as a year-round residence, but rather serves as an entrance to his residence and a passage for merchants and merchandise, it is not considered a residence <b>and is not obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>mezuza</i>.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is the outer booth exempt from the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>? <b>Let the outer</b> booth <b>be</b> considered <b>like a gatehouse of the inner</b> booth <b>and</b> therefore <b>be obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>mezuza</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: It is exempt <b>because</b> even the inner booth <b>is not</b> a <b>permanent</b> residence. It requires a <i>mezuza</i> because the potter resides there year-round; however, that alone does not render it a full-fledged residence that would obligate one to affix a <i>mezuza</i> to the outer booth as its gatehouse.

### Part 4
<b>The Sages taught:</b> The booths represented by the mnemonic: <b><i>Gimmel</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>kaf</i>,</b> which stands for <b>a booth of gentiles [<i>goyim</i>], a booth of women [<i>nashim</i>], a booth of domesticated animals [<i>behema</i>], a booth of Samaritans [<i>Kutim</i>], a booth of any sort,</b> each is <b>fit</b> for use as a <i>sukka</i>, <b>provided it is roofed in the standard sense.</b> None of them is disqualified due to the one who constructed it or the purpose for which it was constructed.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>In the standard sense? Rav Ḥisda said</b> that it means: <b>And</b> provided <b>that one established</b> the booth <b>to</b> provide <b>shade of a <i>sukka</i></b> from its roofing, it may be used to fulfill the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What does</b> the phrase: A booth <b>of any sort,</b> come <b>to include?</b> What other booths are included in this generalization? The Gemara answers: It <b>comes to include</b> the <b>booths</b> listed in another <i>baraita</i> with the mnemonic: <b><i>Reish</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>shin</i>, as the Sages taught: The booth</b> known by the mnemonic <b><i>reish</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>shin</i>,</b> which stands for <b>the booth of shepherds [<i>ro’im</i>], the booth of fig driers [<i>kayyatzim</i>], the booth of guards of fields [<i>burganin</i>], the booth of the guards of produce [<i>shomerei peirot</i>], a booth of any sort,</b> each is <b>fit, provided it is roofed in the standard sense.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks again: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>In the standard sense? Rav Ḥisda said</b> that it means: <b>And</b> provided <b>that one established</b> the booth <b>to</b> provide <b>shade of a <i>sukka</i>,</b> it may be used to fulfill the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>What does</b> the phrase: A booth <b>of any sort, come to include?</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>comes to include</b> the <b>booths</b> listed in the first <i>baraita</i> cited above with the mnemonic <b><i>gimmel</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>kaf</i>.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara explains: <b>This <i>tanna</i> who</b> taught and detailed the <i>halakhot</i> of booths <b>of <i>gimmel</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>kaf</i></b> did so because the fitness of the booths of <b><i>gimmel</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>kaf</i></b> for use in fulfilling the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> is <b>powerful</b> and more obvious <b>to him because they are permanent</b> structures, even though their builders are not obligated in the mitzva. <b>And he taught:</b> Booths of <b>any sort, to include</b> the booths of <b><i>reish</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>shin</i>, which,</b> although they <b>are</b> seasonal and <b>not permanent</b> structures, may still be used to fulfill the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 10
<b>And that</b> other <b><i>tanna</i></b> who taught and detailed the <i>halakhot</i> of booths <b>of <i>reish</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>shin</i></b> did so because the fitness of the booths of <b><i>reish</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>shin</i></b> for use in fulfilling the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> is <b>powerful</b> and more obvious <b>to him</b> because those who constructed the booths are <b>obligated</b> in the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>. <b>And he taught:</b> Booths of <b>any sort, to include</b> the booths of <b><i>gimmel</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>kaf</i>, which,</b> although those who constructed them are <b>not obligated</b> in the mitzva, may still be used to fulfill the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>.
