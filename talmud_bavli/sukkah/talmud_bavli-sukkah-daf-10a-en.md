### Part 1
<b>What are the circumstances?</b> It is in a case <b>where</b> in <b>the lower</b> <i>sukka</i>, <b>its shade is greater than its sunlight,</b> rendering the <i>sukka</i> fit, <b>and</b> in <b>the upper</b> <i>sukka</i>, <b>its sunlight is greater than its shade</b> and it is therefore insignificant, <b>and</b> the roofing of <b>both is within twenty</b> cubits of the ground.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> there are <b>times when the upper</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit and</b> the <b>lower</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is unfit. What are the circumstances?</b> It is in a case <b>where</b> in <b>both</b> <i>sukkot</i> <b>their shade is greater than their sunlight, and</b> the roofing of the <b>upper</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is within twenty</b> cubits of the roofing of the lower one. In this case the upper <i>sukka</i> is fit, while the lower <i>sukka</i> is a <i>sukka</i> beneath a <i>sukka</i> and is unfit.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious.</b> There is nothing novel in any of these scenarios. The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to mention the case where <b>the lower</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit and the upper</b> <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit,</b> as it contains a novel element. <b>Lest you say: Let us issue a decree</b> and deem the lower <i>sukka</i> unfit, as <b>perhaps</b> the <b>unfit roofing</b> of the upper <i>sukka</i> <b>joins together with the fit roofing</b> of the lower <i>sukka</i> and renders it unfit as well; therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the two roofings do not join together and the upper roofing does not render the lower <i>sukka</i> unfit.

### Part 4
The Gemara elucidates this <i>halakha</i>. <b>How much</b> space <b>shall there be between</b> the roofing of the upper <b><i>sukka</i> and</b> the roofing of the lower <b><i>sukka</i> for the lower <i>sukka</i></b> to <b>be</b> considered a discrete entity and therefore <b>disqualified</b> as a <i>sukka</i> beneath a <i>sukka</i>?

### Part 5
<b>Rav Huna said:</b> There must be <b>a handbreadth</b> of space, <b>as we likewise find in tents of ritual impurity</b> the measure of a <b>handbreadth.</b> With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity imparted by a corpse, the legal status of the space of one handbreadth beneath a roof is that of a tent, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: A space measuring one <b>handbreadth by</b> one <b>handbreadth with a height of</b> one <b>handbreadth transmits ritual impurity.</b> If a source of ritual impurity imparted by a corpse is in that space, the impurity is transmitted to all people, vessels, and food in that space. <b>And</b> a space that size <b>serves as a barrier before the</b> spread of <b>ritual impurity</b> beyond that space. <b>However,</b> if the space measures <b>less than the height of</b> one <b>handbreadth, it does not transmit</b> impurity to the objects in that space, <b>and it does not serve as a barrier</b> before the spread of ritual impurity. The impurity breaches the confining walls and rises upward as if there were no covering over it.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna say:</b> For this to be considered a <i>sukka</i> beneath a <i>sukka</i>, the space between the roofing of the upper <i>sukka</i> and that of the lower one must measure at least <b>four</b> handbreadths, <b>as we do not find a significant area</b> that measures <b>less than four</b> handbreadths, e.g., with regard to the domains of Shabbat.

### Part 7
<b>And Shmuel said:</b> The space between the roofing of the upper <i>sukka</i> and that of the lower one must measure at least <b>ten</b> handbreadths. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of Shmuel?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>As</b> the criterion for <b>its fitness, so too</b> is the criterion for <b>its unfitness; just as its fitness</b> is only <b>in</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>ten</b> handbreadths high, <b>so too,</b> its <b>unfitness</b> as a <i>sukka</i> is engendered only <b>by</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>ten</b> handbreadths high.

### Part 8
The Gemara questions Shmuel’s statement: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If there are no residents in the upper</b> <i>sukka</i>, <b>the lower</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>There are no residents? If we say</b> that it means that there are no <b>actual residents,</b> the question arises: <b>Is that to say that residents cause</b> it to be unfit? If the upper <i>sukka</i> is a fit <i>sukka</i>, is there any difference whether or not people reside there? <b>Rather, what is</b> the meaning of: <b>There are no residents? Is it not</b> referring to <b>any</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>that is not suitable to</b> serve as <b>a residence? And what are the circumstances</b> of that case? It is a case <b>where</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>is not ten</b> handbreadths <b>high,</b> as anything less than ten handbreadths high is not considered a residence. From the fact that it is Rabbi Yehuda who distinguishes between whether or not the upper <i>sukka</i> is at least ten handbreadths high, conclude <b>by inference that the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>holds</b> that the lower <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit even if</b> the upper <i>sukka</i> <b>is</b> less than ten handbreadths high and therefore <b>not suitable to</b> serve as <b>a residence.</b> This is contrary to the opinion of Shmuel.

### Part 10
<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that the Sages <b>say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, in explanation of the mishna: <b>If</b> the roofing of <b>the lower</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is not</b> sufficiently sturdy to be <b>able to support the cushions and blankets of the upper</b> <i>sukka</i>, then <b>the lower</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>is fit,</b> as the upper <i>sukka</i> is not suitable to serve as an independent residence. According to this explanation, the mishna does not discuss the height of the upper <i>sukka</i>; it discusses the quality of the roofing.

### Part 11
The Gemara notes: Is that to say <b>by inference that the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>even though</b> the roofing of the lower <i>sukka</i> <b>is not</b> sufficiently sturdy to be <b>able to support</b> the cushions and blankets of the upper <i>sukka</i>, the lower <i>sukka</i> is <b>unfit?</b> In that case, the upper <i>sukka</i> is not a suitable residence. Why should the lower <i>sukka</i> be unfit?

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: The first <i>tanna</i> agrees that if the roofing of the lower <i>sukka</i> is unable to support the cushions and the blankets at all, the upper <i>sukka</i> is not considered a <i>sukka</i> and the lower <i>sukka</i> is fit. However, <b>there is</b> a practical difference <b>between</b> the opinions of the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yehuda in a case where the roofing of the lower <i>sukka</i> <b>is able to support</b> the cushions and the blankets of the upper <i>sukka</i> <b>with difficulty</b> and there is a concern that the roofing might collapse. In that case, the first <i>tanna</i> holds that since the roofing is capable of supporting the cushions and blankets, the upper <i>sukka</i> is considered a separate <i>sukka</i> and renders the lower <i>sukka</i> unfit. According to Rabbi Yehuda, since the roofing is able to support the weight of the cushions and blankets only with difficulty, the upper <i>sukka</i> is not fit. Therefore, the lower <i>sukka</i> is fit.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one spread a sheet over</b> the roofing as protection for those sitting in the <i>sukka</i> <b>due to the sun, or</b> if one spread a sheet <b>beneath</b> the roofing as protection <b>due to the falling leaves, or</b> if <b>one spread</b> a sheet as a canopy <b>over the</b> frame of <b>a four-post [<i>kinof</i>]</b> bed, the area in the <i>sukka</i> beneath the sheets is <b>unfit.</b> In the first two cases, because the sheet is susceptible to ritual impurity, it renders the otherwise fit roofing unfit. In the case of the canopy, one is not sitting under the roofing of the <i>sukka</i>; rather, he is sitting inside a tent. <b>However, one</b> may <b>spread</b> the sheet <b>over</b> the frame of <b>a two-post [<i>naklitei</i>] bed,</b> which has one post in the middle of each end of the bed. When spreading the sheet over the posts it forms an inclined rather than a flat roof, and a tent with an inclined roof is not considered a significant structure.

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> the ruling that the sheet renders the <i>sukka</i> unfit <b>only</b> when it is placed underneath the roofing <b>due to the falling leaves; however,</b> if his intent was to spread the sheet for decorative purposes <b>to beautify</b> the <i>sukka</i>, it is not in the category of roofing and the <i>sukka</i> is <b>fit.</b> The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious,</b> as: <b>Due to the falling leaves,</b> is what <b>we learned</b> in the mishna. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>the same is true,</b> i.e., the <i>sukka</i> is unfit, <b>even</b> when the sheet was spread <b>to beautify</b> the <i>sukka</i>, <b>and</b> the reason <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> specifically the case where one spread the sheet <b>due to the falling leaves</b> is that the mishna <b>teaches the matter,</b> spreading a sheet in the <i>sukka</i>, <b>in the manner in which it</b> typically occurs. Rav Ḥisda <b>teaches us</b> that the formulation of the mishna is precise and the <i>halakha</i> applies specifically to the case cited. If one spread the sheet for decorative purposes, it does not render the <i>sukka</i> unfit.

### Part 15
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>Tosefta</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of Rav Ḥisda. If <b>one roofed</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>in accordance with its halakhic</b> requirements, <b>and decorated it with colorful curtains and sheets, and hung in it</b> ornamental <b>nuts, peaches, almonds, and pomegranates, grape branches [<i>parkilei</i>], and wreaths of stalks</b> of grain, <b>wines, oils, and</b> vessels full of <b>flour, it is prohibited to</b> derive benefit and <b>use them</b>
