<b>Rav said: On account of four matters the property of homeowners is confiscated by the state treasury [<i>timyon</i>]: On</b> account of <b>those who delay</b> payment of <b>the salary of hired laborers</b> (see Leviticus 19:13; Deuteronomy 24:15); <b>on</b> account of <b>those who withhold the salary of hired laborers</b> and do not pay at all; <b>and on</b> account of <b>those who throw off the yoke</b> of communal responsibility <b>from their</b> own <b>necks and place</b> that yoke <b>on</b> the necks of <b>their friends; and on</b> account of <b>the arrogance</b> of those who, due to their wealth, exercise power over the community. <b>And the</b> punishment for <b>arrogance is equal to them all. However, with regard to the humble it is written: “The humble will inherit the land and delight themselves in the abundance of peace”</b> (Psalms 37:11).
