### Part 1
<b>The verse equated a woman to a man</b> with regard <b>to all punishments</b> and prohibitions <b>in the Torah.</b> The mitzvot of Yom Kippur include prohibitions, as well as the punishment of <i>karet</i>. Why, then, was this additional derivation necessary? <b>Abaye said: Actually, <i>sukka</i> is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. Nevertheless, it <b>was necessary</b> to teach that a woman is exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: “Shall you reside”</b> (Leviticus 23:42) indicates that you reside in the <i>sukka</i> <b>as you dwell; just as dwelling</b> is typically performed by a <b>man and his wife, so too,</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i></b> is performed by both <b>a man and his wife.</b> Therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> that women are exempt.

### Part 2
<b>Rava said</b> a different reason: A <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>was necessary</b> to teach that a woman is exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: Derive</b> a verbal analogy with regard to <i>Sukkot</i>, about which it is written: “On the <b>fifteenth</b> day of this seventh month is the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>” (Leviticus 23:34), <b>from</b> Passover, about which it is written: “And on the <b>fifteenth</b> day of the same month is the <b>festival of <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Leviticus 23:6). <b>Just as there, women are obligated</b> to eat <i>matza</i> on Passover even though it is a time-bound mitzva, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>, <b>women are obligated.</b> Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>teaches us</b> that they are exempt.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And now that you said</b> that women’s exemption from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> is a <b><i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>why do I</b> need the definite article stated in the <b>verse</b> in the term “the homeborn”? The Gemara answers: This verse comes <b>to include converts,</b> as <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>the Merciful One says: “The homeborn in Israel,”</b> indicating that only homeborn Jews are included <b>and not the converts.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that converts are also obligated.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: The obligation of women to fast on <b>Yom Kippur is derived from</b> the statement <b>that Rabbi Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said.</b> In that case, why do I need the definite article in the term: The homeborn? The Gemara answers: That phrase <b>was needed only to</b> include women in the <b>extension</b> of the period <b>of affliction</b> on Yom Kippur eve, as <b>it might enter your mind to say: Since the Merciful One excludes</b> one who violates the obligation to afflict himself during <b>the extension</b> of the period <b>of affliction from</b> the <b>punishment</b> of <i>karet</i> <b>and</b> from the Torah <b>prohibition, women should not be obligated</b> to observe that period <b>at all.</b> Their obligation to observe Yom Kippur is based on the principle: The verse equated a woman to a man with regard to all punishments and prohibitions in the Torah. Since there is neither punishment nor Torah prohibition during that period, women should be exempt. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that since they are obligated to observe Yom Kippur, they are obligated to observe the extension of Yom Kippur as well.

### Part 5
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>“All</b> the homeborn” comes <b>to include the minors</b> capable of performing this mitzva. The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>Women and slaves and minors are exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> where it is taught that minors are included, it is referring to <b>a minor who reached</b> the age of <b>training,</b> whose parents are commanded to train him in the performance of mitzvot and to accustom him to fulfill them. <b>Here,</b> in the mishna where it stated that the minor is exempt, it is referring to <b>a minor</b> who <b>did not</b> yet <b>reach</b> the age of <b>training.</b> The Gemara asks: The obligation of <b>a minor who reached</b> the age of <b>training</b> to perform mitzvot <b>is by rabbinic law,</b> and therefore it is not derived from a verse. The Gemara answers: Indeed, the obligation of the minor is <b>by rabbinic law</b> as part of his training, <b>and the verse</b> is <b>a mere support</b> alluding to that obligation.

### Part 6
The mishna continues: <b>A minor who does not need his mother</b> any longer <b>is obligated</b> in the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>a minor who does not need his mother? In the school of Rabbi Yannai they said:</b> This is referring to <b>any</b> child <b>who defecates and his mother does not</b> need to <b>wipe him. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> It is <b>any</b> child <b>who awakens from his sleep and does not call: Mother, mother.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Older</b> children <b>also call</b> for their mother when they arise; what, then, is the criterion? The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, say</b> that <b>any</b> child <b>who awakens and does not call: Mother, mother,</b> repeatedly until his mother comes is characterized as one who does not need his mother. An older child will cry once. However, if his mother does not come, he will tend to himself.

### Part 7
The mishna relates: There was <b>an incident where the daughter-in-law of</b> Shammai the Elder <b>gave birth</b> and he removed part of the roof so the baby would be in a <i>sukka</i>. The Gemara asks: Does the mishna cite <b>an incident to contradict</b> the preceding <i>halakha</i> that minors that are not independent are exempt from the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>? The Gemara answers: The mishna is <b>incomplete, and it teaches the following: And Shammai is stringent</b> even with very small children; <b>and there was also an incident and the daughter-in-law of Shammai the Elder gave birth</b> and Shammai <b>removed the</b> coat of <b>plaster</b> from the roof and left the beams <b>and roofed</b> with the beams <b>over the bed for the</b> newborn <b>minor.</b>

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All seven days</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>a person renders his <i>sukka</i></b> his <b>permanent</b> residence <b>and his house</b> his <b>temporary</b> residence. If <b>rain fell, from when is it permitted to vacate</b> the <i>sukka</i>? It is permitted <b>from</b> the point that it is raining so hard <b>that the congealed dish will spoil.</b> The Sages <b>told a parable: To what is this matter comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to a servant who comes to pour wine for his master, and he pours a jug [<i>kiton</i>] of water in his face</b> to show him that his presence is not desired. So too, in the <i>sukka</i>, rain is an indication that the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not want the person to fulfill the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: All seven days</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>a person renders his <i>sukka</i></b> his <b>permanent</b> residence <b>and his house</b> his <b>temporary</b> residence. <b>How so? If he has beautiful vessels, he takes them up to the <i>sukka</i>,</b> which was typically built on the roof. <b>If he has beautiful bedding, he takes it up to the <i>sukka</i>. He eats and drinks and relaxes in the <i>sukka</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara explains that it is <b>as the Sages taught:</b> “In <i>sukkot</i> <b>shall you reside” (</b>Leviticus 23:42), and they interpreted: Reside <b>as you dwell</b> in your permanent home. <b>From here they said: All seven days, a person renders his <i>sukka</i></b> his <b>permanent</b> residence <b>and his house</b> his <b>temporary</b> residence. <b>How so? If he has beautiful vessels, he takes them up to the <i>sukka</i>;</b> if he has <b>beautiful bedding, he takes it up to the <i>sukka</i>; he eats and drinks and relaxes in the <i>sukka</i> and studies</b> Torah <b>in the <i>sukka</i>.</b>

### Part 10
With regard to studying Torah in the <i>sukka</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rava say: Studying Bible and studying Mishna</b> are undertaken <b>in the <i>sukka</i>;</b> however, <b>analyzing</b> the Mishna must be undertaken <b>outside the <i>sukka</i>.</b> This indicates that one should not analyze Torah in the <i>sukka</i>. The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, where it was taught that one studies in the <i>sukka</i>, is <b>with regard to extensive study,</b> i.e., broad study and memorization. <b>That</b> statement of Rava that one should study outside the <i>sukka</i> is <b>with regard to intensive study;</b> such study requires an environment where one can concentrate properly in order to engage in analysis of the Mishna.
