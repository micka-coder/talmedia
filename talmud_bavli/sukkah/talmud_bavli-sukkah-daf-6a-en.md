### Part 1
However, if <b>he was dressed in his clothes, and his sandals were on his feet, and his rings were on his fingers, he immediately</b> becomes <b>ritually impure, but they,</b> the clothes, sandals, and rings, <b>remain pure until he stays</b> in the house <b>long enough to eat half a loaf</b> of bread. This calculation is based on <b>wheat bread,</b> which takes less time to eat, <b>and not</b> on <b>barley bread,</b> and it relates to one who is <b>reclining and eating</b> it together <b>with relish</b> or a condiment, which hastens the eating. This is a Torah measurement connected specifically to wheat.

### Part 2
<b>Barley</b> is also used as a basis for measurements, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>A bone</b> from a corpse the size <b>of a</b> grain of <b>barley imparts</b> ritual <b>impurity through contact and by being carried,</b> but <b>it does not impart impurity</b> by means <b>of a tent,</b> i.e., if the bone was inside a house, it does not render all the articles in the house ritually impure.

### Part 3
The halakhic measure determined by <b>a vine is the quantity of a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of wine for a nazirite.</b> A nazirite, for whom it is prohibited to drink wine, is liable to be flogged if he drinks that measure.

### Part 4
<b>Fig</b> alludes to the measure of <b>a dried fig-bulk with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>carrying out</b> on <b>Shabbat.</b> One is liable for carrying food fit for human consumption on Shabbat, provided that he carries a dried fig-bulk of that food.

### Part 5
<b>Pomegranate</b> teaches the following measure, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>All</b> ritually impure wooden <b>vessels belonging to</b> ordinary <b>homeowners</b> become pure through being broken, as broken vessels cannot contract or maintain ritual impurity. They are considered broken if they have holes <b>the size of pomegranates.</b>

### Part 6
The Sages interpreted: <b>“A land of olive oil and honey,”</b> as: <b>A land, all of whose measures are olive-bulks.</b> The Gemara poses a question: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> that it is a land <b>all of whose measures</b> are olive-bulks? <b>But aren’t there those</b> measures <b>that we</b> just <b>mentioned</b> above, which are not olive-bulks? <b>Rather, say: A land, most of whose measures are olive-bulks,</b> as most measures relating to forbidden foods, e.g., fats, blood, <i>piggul</i>, leftover sacrificial flesh, ritually impure food, and the sciatic nerve, are olive-bulks, as are the measures for a corpse to transmit impurity in a tent and for an animal carcass to transmit impurity through contact.

### Part 7
<b>Honey,</b> i.e., dates from which date honey is extracted, also determines a measure, as with regard <b>to</b> eating on <b>Yom Kippur,</b> one is liable only if he eats <b>a large date-bulk</b> of food.

### Part 8
<b>Apparently,</b> all <b>these</b> halakhic measurements <b>are</b> derived from this verse <b>in the Torah</b> and are not <i>halakhot</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>And how can you understand</b> it in that manner that all these <b>measures are</b> explicitly <b>written</b> in the Torah with regard to each of the <i>halakhot</i> mentioned above? <b>Rather, they are <i>halakhot</i></b> that were transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>and the verse</b> cited <b>is mere support</b> for these <i>halakhot</i>, not a source.

### Part 9
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi said earlier that Rav said that the <i>halakhot</i> governing <b>interpositions</b> that invalidate ritual immersion are <i>halakhot</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. The Gemara challenges this assertion: <b>These,</b> too, <b>are</b> written <b>in the Torah, as it is written: “And he shall bathe his flesh in the water”</b> (Leviticus 14:9), and the Sages derived <b>that nothing should interpose between his flesh and the water.</b> Apparently, the <i>halakhot</i> of interposition are derived from a verse in the Torah and not through oral tradition.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>When the <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses <b>comes</b> to teach, it is not with regard to an interposition on one’s skin, which is indeed derived from verses in the Torah. Rather, it comes to teach that an interposition <b>in one’s hair</b> invalidates the immersion, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabba bar bar Ḥana, as Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: A single hair [<i>nima</i>] tied</b> in a knot <b>interposes</b> and invalidates the immersion. <b>Three</b> hairs tied together in a knot <b>do not interpose,</b> because three hairs cannot be tied so tightly that water cannot penetrate them. With regard to <b>two</b> hairs tied together in a knot, <b>I do not know</b> the <i>halakha</i>. This <i>halakha</i> with regard to hair is a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai.

### Part 11
The Gemara raises a difficulty: The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>one’s hair is also</b> written <b>in the Torah,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to that <b>which is written: “And he shall bathe [<i>et besaro</i>] his flesh in the water.”</b> The superfluous word <b><i>et</i></b> comes to include <b>that which is subordinate to his flesh, and what is that?</b> That is <b>his hair.</b> The fact that, like the body, there can be no interposition between one’s hair and the water is also derived from a verse.

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>When the <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>comes</b> to teach, it is not with regard to an interposition in one’s hair, which is indeed derived from a verse in the Torah. Rather, it comes to teach <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b>
