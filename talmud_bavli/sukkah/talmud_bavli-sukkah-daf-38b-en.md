### Part 1
<b>Many significant <i>halakhot</i> can be learned from the custom of <i>hallel</i></b> based on the manner in which it was recited. In reciting <i>hallel</i> there are allusions to several halakhic matters and customs that the Sages instituted due to circumstances extant at the time. Although due to increased literacy and familiarity with the <i>hallel</i> liturgy the reasons no longer apply, these customs remain in practice. The prayer leader <b>recites: “<i>Halleluya</i>”</b> (Psalms 113:1), <b>and</b> the congregation <b>recites: <i>Halleluya</i>,</b> in response. <b>From here</b> is the source <b>that</b> there is <b>a mitzva to respond: <i>Halleluya</i>.</b>

### Part 2
Likewise, the prayer leader <b>recites: “Give praise, servants of the Lord”</b> (Psalms 113:1), <b>and</b> the congregation <b>recites: <i>Halleluya</i>,</b> in response. <b>From here</b> is the source of the <i>halakha</i> cited in the mishna <b>that if an adult male was reciting</b> <i>hallel</i> <b>on his</b> behalf, <b>he answers: <i>Halleluya</i>. He recites: “Thank the Lord,</b> for He is good” (Psalms 118:1), <b>and they respond: “Thank the Lord,</b> for He is good.” <b>From here</b> is the source <b>that</b> there is <b>a mitzva to respond</b> by reciting <b>the beginnings of chapters. It was also stated</b> that <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said:</b> There is <b>a mitzva to respond</b> by reciting <b>the beginnings of chapters.</b>

### Part 3
Rava continued to cite the significant <i>halakhot</i> learned from <i>hallel</i>. The prayer leader <b>recites: “Lord, please save us”</b> (Psalms 118:25), <b>and</b> the congregation <b>recites: “Lord, please save us,”</b> in response. <b>From here</b> is the source of the <i>halakha</i> cited in the mishna <b>that if a minor was reciting</b> a portion that is not from the beginning of a chapter <b>on one’s</b> behalf, <b>he recites after him</b> precisely <b>what he says.</b>

### Part 4
The prayer leader <b>recites: “Lord, please grant us success,” and</b> the congregation <b>recites</b> in response: “<b>Lord, please grant us success”</b> (Psalms 118:25). <b>From here</b> is the source of the <i>halakha</i> <b>that if</b> one <b>comes to repeat</b> a particular verse in <i>hallel</i> twice, <b>he</b> may <b>repeat</b> it. The prayer leader <b>recites: “Blessed is one who comes”</b> (Psalms 118:26), <b>and</b> the congregation <b>recites</b> the rest of the verse: <b>“In the name of the Lord”</b> (Psalms 118:26), in response. <b>From here</b> is the source of the <i>halakha</i> that the halakhic status of <b>one who hears</b> a passage recited <b>is equivalent to</b> that of <b>one who recites</b> it, as the congregation fulfills its obligation even though it does not repeat the entire verse.

### Part 5
Apropos this <i>halakha</i>, the Gemara relates that the Sages <b>raised a dilemma before Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba:</b> If <b>one heard</b> a passage recited <b>and did not recite</b> it himself, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Did he fulfill his obligation or not? <b>He said to them</b> that <b>the Sages, and the schoolteachers, and the heads of the nation, and the</b> homiletic <b>interpreters said: One who heard</b> a passage recited <b>and did not recite</b> it himself <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation.

### Part 6
<b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of Bar Kappara: From where</b> is it derived that the halakhic status of <b>one who hears</b> a passage recited <b>is equivalent to</b> that of <b>one who recites</b> it? It is <b>as it is written: “All the words of the book which</b> the king of Judea <b>has read”</b> (II Kings 22:16). <b>And did</b> King <b>Josiah read them? Didn’t Shaphan read them, as it is written: “And Shaphan read it before the king”</b> (II Kings 22:10)? <b>Rather, from here</b> it is derived <b>that</b> the halakhic status of <b>one who hears</b> a passage recited <b>is equivalent to</b> that of <b>one who recites</b> it, and it is as though Josiah read the words himself.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And perhaps after Shaphan read them Josiah read</b> them again? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> It should <b>not enter your mind</b> to say so, <b>as it is written: “Because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before the Lord when you heard</b> what I spoke in this place” (II Kings 22:19). The Gemara infers: <b>“When you heard”</b> is written in the verse, <b>and not: When you read.</b> In other words, immediately upon hearing Shaphan read the text, King Josiah sent for Huldah the prophetess, which shows that he humbled his heart. Clearly, the halakhic status of one who hears a passage recited is equivalent to that of one who recites it.

### Part 8
Apropos <i>hallel</i>, the Gemara cites additional <i>halakhot</i>. <b>Rava said: Let a person not recite: “Blessed is one who comes,” and then,</b> after pausing, recite: <b>“In the name of the Lord.” Rather,</b> let him recite without pause: <b>“Blessed is one who comes in the name of the Lord.” Rav Safra said to</b> Rava:
