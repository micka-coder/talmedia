<b>and they</b> each <b>said: Take them up to the <i>sukka</i>.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And when they gave Rabbi Tzadok less than an egg-bulk of food, he took</b> the food <b>in a cloth and he ate it outside the <i>sukka</i> and did not recite a blessing after</b> eating <b>it.</b> The Gemara infers: Had they given him <b>an egg-bulk</b> of food, <b>he</b> would have been <b>required</b> to eat it in a <b><i>sukka</i>. Let us say that this is a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef and Abaye,</b> who said that one is permitted to eat that measure in the context of a casual meal outside the <i>sukka</i>. The Gemara answers: No proof can be cited from here, because <b>perhaps</b> the reason the mishna emphasizes that Rabbi Tzadok ate less than an egg-bulk of food is that eating <b>less than an egg-bulk does not require washing</b> hands <b>and</b> reciting <b>a blessing</b> after eating it; <b>however,</b> eating <b>an egg-bulk requires washing and</b> reciting a <b>blessing.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: A person is obligated to eat fourteen meals in the <i>sukka</i></b> over the course of the seven days of the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>one during the day</b> each day <b>and one at night</b> each night. <b>And the Rabbis say: There is no quota</b> for the number of meals, and one may choose whether or not to eat any of the meals <b>except for the</b> meal on the <b>evening of the first Festival</b> day <b>of <i>Sukkot</i>,</b> which one is required to eat in the <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 4
<b>And furthermore, Rabbi Eliezer said: One who did not eat</b> a meal on the <b>evening of the first day</b> of the Festival should <b>compensate</b> with a meal on the <b>evening of the last day of the Festival,</b> on the Eighth Day of Assembly, despite the fact that he will not eat it in the <i>sukka</i>. <b>And the Rabbis say: There is no compensation for</b> this <b>matter, and with regard to</b> similar cases where it is impossible to rectify failure to fulfill a positive mitzva, <b>it is stated: “That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:15).

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who mandates eating fourteen meals in the <i>sukka</i>? The Gemara answers that he derives his opinion from the verse: “In <i>sukkot</i> <b>shall you reside”</b> (Leviticus 23:42), which the Sages interpreted to mean: Reside <b>as you dwell</b> in your permanent home. Therefore, <b>just as</b> in one’s <b>dwelling</b> one typically eats <b>one</b> meal <b>during the day and one</b> meal <b>at night, so too, in a <i>sukka</i></b> one eats <b>one</b> meal <b>during the day and one</b> meal <b>at night.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> interpret that verse? The Gemara answers: They explain that a <i>sukka</i> is <b>like a</b> permanent <b>dwelling. Just as</b> in one’s <b>dwelling, if one desires</b> to eat, <b>he eats, and if one does not desire</b> to do so, <b>he does not eat, so too,</b> in the <b><i>sukka</i>, if one desires</b> to eat, <b>he eats, and if one does not desire</b> to do so, <b>he does not eat.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then according to the Rabbis, <b>even</b> on <b>the first Festival evening as well</b> one should not be required to eat in the <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak:</b> There is a verbal analogy between the festivals of Passover and <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to <i>Sukkot</i>: “On the <b>fifteenth</b> day of this seventh month is the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> for seven days unto the Lord” (Leviticus 23:34). <b>And it is stated:</b> “And on the <b>fifteenth</b> day of the same month is the festival of <i>matzot</i> unto the Lord” (Leviticus 23:6) <b>with regard to</b> the festival of <b>Passover. Just as there,</b> with regard to Passover, on <b>the first night</b> there is <b>an obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>and from that point onward it is optional,</b> as from that point onward the only obligation is to refrain from eating leaven, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to <i>Sukkot</i>, on <b>the first night</b> there <b>is an obligation</b> to eat in the <i>sukka</i> <b>and from that point onward it is optional.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to Passover, <b>from where do we</b> derive that there is an obligation to eat <i>matza</i> on the first night? The Gemara answers that <b>the verse says: “In the evening you shall eat <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:18). <b>The verse established it</b> as <b>an obligation.</b>

### Part 10
§ The mishna continues: <b>And furthermore, Rabbi Eliezer said</b> that one who did not eat a meal on the evening of the first day of the Festival should compensate with a meal on the evening of the last day of the Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Eliezer say</b> that <b>a person is obligated to eat fourteen meals in the <i>sukka</i>, one during the day and one at night?</b> However, the compensatory meal on the evening of the Eighth Day of Assembly is not eaten in the <i>sukka</i>. <b>Beira said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said: Rabbi Eliezer retracted</b> his previous statement and agrees with the Rabbis that there is no quota for the meals that one must eat in the <i>sukka</i>, and it is only the meal on the first evening of the Festival that one must eat in the <i>sukka</i>. Their dispute is with regard to compensation if one failed to eat the meal on the first evening.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>With what</b> will <b>he compensate</b> for his failure to eat the Festival meal? <b>If we say</b> that he compensates <b>with bread, he is</b> thereby <b>eating the</b> festive <b>meal of that</b> Eighth <b>Day</b> of Assembly; how is it obvious that it is compensation for a different meal? <b>Rather, what is</b> the meaning of: <b>He</b> should <b>compensate?</b> It means that <b>he</b> should <b>compensate by</b> adding <b>types of delicacies [<i>targima</i>]. That is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>as well: If he compensated by</b> adding <b>types of delicacies, he fulfilled his obligation.</b>

### Part 12
<b>The steward [<i>apotropos</i>] of King Agrippas asked Rabbi Eliezer: For</b> someone <b>like me, who is accustomed to eat only one meal a day, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it sufficient <b>that I eat one meal</b> and <b>exempt</b> myself from the obligation to eat any more that day? Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: Each day you continue</b> eating <b>and taste various kinds of appetizers in deference to your own</b> desires, <b>and now you do not continue</b> eating even <b>one appetizer in deference to your Maker?</b>

### Part 13
<b>And</b> the steward <b>further asked</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>For</b> someone <b>like me, who has two wives, one in Tiberias and one in Tzippori, and has two <i>sukkot</i>, one in Tiberias and one in Tzippori, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Can <b>I depart from</b> one <b><i>sukka</i> to</b> another <b><i>sukka</i> and exempt</b> myself from the obligation? In other words, is it permitted to fulfill the mitzva in one <i>sukka</i> for part of <i>Sukkot</i> and in another for the rest of the Festival? Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: No, as I say</b> that <b>anyone who departs from</b> one <b><i>sukka</i> to</b> another <b><i>sukka</i> has negated the mitzva of the first.</b> The obligation is to reside in the same <i>sukka</i> for all seven days.

### Part 14
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b>
