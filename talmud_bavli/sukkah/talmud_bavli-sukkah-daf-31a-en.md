### Part 1
it is called <b><i>hoshana</i>,</b> which is a term used to describe the four species. The Gemara answers: This is not a full-fledged change of name, as occasionally it <b>also</b> happens that <b>they initially refer to a myrtle branch as a <i>hoshana</i></b> while it is attached to the tree.

### Part 2
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>a stolen <i>sukka</i> and</b> with regard to <b>one who roofs</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>in the public domain,</b> which is tantamount to robbing land from the public, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> these <i>sukkot</i> <b>unfit</b> for use in fulfillment of the mitzva, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> them <b>fit.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This <b>dispute is</b> limited to a case <b>where one assaults another and</b> forcibly <b>evicts him from his <i>sukka</i>,</b> and takes his place in the <i>sukka</i>. In that case, Rabbi Eliezer deems the <i>sukka</i> unfit. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer conforms to his</b> own <b>reasoning, as he said: A person does not fulfill his obligation with the <i>sukka</i> of another.</b> Therefore, in any event, he does not fulfill his obligation with it. <b>If land</b> can <b>be stolen</b> and acquired by the robber, the <i>sukka</i> from which he evicted the owner <b>is a stolen <i>sukka</i>. And if indeed land cannot be stolen,</b> nevertheless, the robber does not fulfill his obligation according to Rabbi Eliezer, as <b>it is a borrowed <i>sukka</i>.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And the Rabbis conform to their reasoning, as they said: A person fulfills his obligation with the <i>sukka</i> of another. And</b> since <b>land cannot be stolen and</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>is</b> merely <b>a borrowed</b> <i>sukka</i> and not a stolen one, the robber fulfills his obligation, despite the fact that he committed a reprehensible act.

### Part 5
<b>However,</b> if <b>one stole wood and roofed</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>with it, everyone agrees,</b> as Rabbi Eliezer concedes, that the original owner of the wood <b>has</b> rights <b>only</b> to <b>the monetary value of the wood.</b> The wood itself belongs to the robber, so it is not a stolen <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> does Rav Naḥman draw the conclusion that the dispute is with regard to a stolen <i>sukka</i> and not with regard to a <i>sukka</i> established with stolen building materials?

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>From the fact that</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a stolen <i>sukka</i> is juxtaposed in the <i>baraita</i> to the <i>halakha</i> of a <i>sukka</i> established in the public domain, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that the legal status of the stolen <i>sukka</i> is <b>similar to</b> the legal status of a <i>sukka</i> established in <b>the public domain. Just as</b> one does not fulfill his obligation with a <i>sukka</i> in <b>the public domain</b> because <b>the land is not his,</b> with regard to the stolen <b><i>sukka</i> too,</b> one does not fulfill his obligation because <b>the land is not his,</b> not because the building materials were stolen.

### Part 8
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain old woman who came before Rav Naḥman. She said to him: The Exilarch and all the Sages in his house have been sitting in a stolen <i>sukka</i>.</b> She claimed that the Exilarch’s servants stole her wood and used it to build the <i>sukka</i>. <b>She screamed, but Rav Naḥman did not pay attention to her. She said to him: A woman whose father,</b> Abraham, our forefather, <b>had three hundred and eighteen slaves screams before you, and you do not pay attention to her?</b> She claimed that she should be treated with deference due to her lineage as a Jew. <b>Rav Naḥman said to</b> the Sages: <b>This</b> woman <b>is a screamer, and she has</b> rights <b>only</b> to <b>the monetary value of the wood.</b> However, the <i>sukka</i> itself was already acquired by the Exilarch.

### Part 9
<b>Ravina said:</b> With regard to <b>the stolen</b> large <b>beam of a <i>sukka</i>, the Sages instituted an ordinance</b> that the robber need not return it intact, <b>due to the</b> general <b>ordinance of a beam.</b> By the letter of the law, one who stole a beam and incorporated it in the construction of a new house is required to dismantle the house and return the beam. The Sages instituted an ordinance requiring the robber to repay the monetary value of the beam instead. They instituted this ordinance to facilitate the repentance of the robber, who would be less likely to repent if doing so entailed destruction of the house.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious.</b> In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> the beam <b>different from</b> other <b>wood</b> used in establishing the <i>sukka</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say: Wood is common,</b> and therefore the owners are more likely to despair of recovering the wood and will suffice with receiving monetary restitution and replacing the wood, <b>but,</b> with regard to <b>this</b> large beam, which <b>is not common, say</b> that there is <b>no</b> despair, and the robber is required to return the actual beam, therefore, Ravina <b>teaches us</b> that the ordinance applies even to this beam, and the robber is required to return only its monetary value.

### Part 11
The Gemara notes: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> that the robber need not dismantle the <i>sukka</i> and return the beam <b>applies</b> only <b>within</b> the <b>seven</b> days of the Festival. <b>However, after</b> the <b>seven</b> days, the beam <b>returns</b> to the owner <b>intact. And if</b> the robber <b>attached it with mortar</b> and it is affixed permanently to the <i>sukka</i>, then <b>even after</b> the <b>seven</b> days of the Festival, the ordinance remains in effect, and the robber <b>gives</b> the original owner <b>the monetary value</b> of the beam.

### Part 12
§ It was taught in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>A dry <i>lulav</i> is unfit. Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> it <b>fit. Rava said: The dispute is</b> specifically <b>with regard to a <i>lulav</i>, as the Rabbis hold: We liken the <i>lulav</i> to the <i>etrog</i>,</b> based on their juxtaposition in the verse. <b>Just as the <i>etrog</i> requires beauty, so too, the <i>lulav</i> requires beauty. And Rabbi Yehuda holds: We do not liken the <i>lulav</i> to the <i>etrog</i>. However, with regard to an <i>etrog</i>, everyone agrees that we require beauty [<i>hadar</i>]</b> as the verse states: “Fruit of a beautiful tree” (Leviticus 23:40) and a dry <i>etrog</i> does not meet that criterion.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to a <i>lulav</i>, does Rabbi Yehuda</b> really <b>not require beauty? But didn’t we learn in the mishna</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to a <i>lulav</i> whose leaves have spread out, <b>one should bind</b> the <i>lulav</i> <b>from the top. What is the reason</b> to do so? Is it <b>not because he requires beauty</b> in the case of <i>lulav</i>?

### Part 14
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No, as the reason is taught: Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Tarfon</b> that the same verse states: <b>“Branches [<i>kappot</i>] of a date palm.”</b> The Sages interpret the term to mean <b>bound [<i>kafut</i>],</b> indicating that <b>if</b> the leaves of the <i>lulav</i> <b>were spread, one should bind it.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>not require beauty</b> with regard to the <i>lulav</i>? <b>But didn’t we learn in a mishna: One binds the <i>lulav</i> only with its own species,</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda? What is the reason</b> that Rabbi Yehuda requires the binding to be from its own species? Is it <b>not due to</b> the fact that <b>he requires beauty</b> with regard to the <i>lulav</i>?

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> that is not the reason, <b>as Rava said:</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda, one may bind the <i>lulav</i> <b>even with fiber</b> that grows around the trunk of the date palm <b>and even with the root of the date palm,</b> even though these do not meet the criterion of beauty. The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda there,</b> that a <i>lulav</i> must be bound with its own species? The Gemara answers: It is <b>because he holds</b> that <b>a <i>lulav</i> requires binding, and if one brought another species</b> to bind it, <b>they are five species</b> instead of four, violating the prohibition against adding to the mitzvot of the Torah.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to an <i>etrog</i>, does Rabbi Yehuda require beauty? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the four species of the <i>lulav</i>, just as one may not diminish from their</b> number, <b>so too, one may not add to their</b> number. <b>If one did not find an <i>etrog</i>, he should not bring a quince, a pomegranate, or any other item</b> instead. If the species are slightly <b>dried,</b> they <b>are fit.</b> If they are completely <b>dry,</b> they <b>are unfit. Rabbi Yehuda says: Even dry <i>etrogim</i> are fit.</b>

### Part 18
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There was <b>an incident</b>
