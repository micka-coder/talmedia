### Part 1
<b>Rather, Abaye said: It is a rabbinic</b> decree issued so <b>that one will not conduct</b> himself on Shabbat <b>in the manner that he conducts</b> himself <b>during the week.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Abaye would consolidate the principles of the <i>baraitot</i></b> pertaining to the construction of a tent on Shabbat <b>and teach:</b> With regard to <b>a large wineskin, a</b> wine <b>strainer, a canopy</b> hung over a bed, <b>and a folding chair</b> whose cover is detached from its legs, <b>one may not assemble</b> them due to the prohibition against making a temporary tent. <b>If one did</b> so unwittingly, <b>he is exempt</b> by Torah law from bringing a sin-offering, <b>but</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> by rabbinic decree. With regard to <b>permanent tents, one may not make</b> them, <b>and if he did</b> so, <b>he is liable to</b> bring <b>a sin-offering</b> for performing the prohibited labor of building. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a bed, and a folding chair [<i>teraskal</i>]</b> whose cover is attached to its legs, <b>and a</b> collapsible <b>toilet, it is permissible to open them <i>ab initio</i>,</b> since they are prepared for use from before Shabbat.

### Part 3
We also learned in the mishna: <b>One may not place</b> wine for filtering even <b>into</b> a <b>suspended</b> strainer <b>on Shabbat. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>one strained</b> wine, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> If <b>one strained</b> wine, <b>he is liable to</b> bring <b>a sin-offering.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Sheshet strongly objects to this: Is there something for which the Rabbis render one liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering and Rabbi Eliezer permits</b> its performance <b><i>ab initio</i>?</b> Extreme differences of opinion of that kind are rarely found in one mishna.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yosef strongly objects to</b> this question: <b>Why not? Isn’t</b> there an analogous dispute with regard to a woman who wears <b>a city of gold</b> ornament from one domain to another on Shabbat, <b>as Rabbi Meir renders</b> her <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering, and Rabbi Eliezer permits</b> it even <b><i>ab initio</i>?</b>

### Part 6
<b>What is</b> that dispute? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A woman may not go out</b> into the public domain on Shabbat <b>with a city of gold</b> ornament. <b>And if she did go out</b> with it into the public domain, <b>she is liable to bring a sin-offering;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: She may not go out</b> with it <i>ab initio</i>, <b>and if she went out, she is exempt. And Rabbi Eliezer says: A woman may go out with a city of gold</b> ornament <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> Apparently, there is precedent for a dispute in which one opinion maintains that an action incurs liability to bring a sin-offering, while another opinion rules that it is permitted <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Do you hold that Rabbi Eliezer is relating to</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said</b> that <b>she is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering? He is relating to</b> the statement of <b>the Rabbis, who said one is exempt but it is prohibited, and he said to them</b> that he holds that it is <b>permitted <i>ab initio</i>.</b> Had there not been the intermediate opinion of the Rabbis, an argument with such extreme opinions would not have been possible.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: One is liable to bring a sin-offering for straining. <b>Due to</b> performance of <b>what</b> category of prohibited labor <b>do we forewarn him? Rabba said:</b> It is <b>for</b> the category of <b>selecting,</b> as one is selecting the wine from the sediment. <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> It is <b>for</b> the category of <b>sifting,</b> as straining is similar to sifting flour in a sifter, which is a form of selecting.

### Part 9
<b>Rabba said: According to my opinion, it is reasonable. What is the manner of one who selects?</b> He <b>takes</b> the <b>food and leaves the refuse; here too,</b> when straining wine, <b>one takes the food and leaves the refuse.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: According to my opinion,</b> that this is not typical selection but rather a specific type of selection, <b>it is reasonable,</b> as <b>what is the manner of sifting?</b> The <b>refuse</b> remains <b>atop</b> the sifter <b>and the food is below. Here too,</b> when straining wine, the <b>refuse</b> remains <b>atop</b> the strainer <b>and the food is below.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rami bar Yeḥezkel taught:</b> With regard to <b>a doubled cloak, one may not make</b> a covering on Shabbat by taking the cloak and placing it over a rope and extending the two sides in order to form something similar to a canopy beneath which one could lie (<i>ge’onim</i>; Rif). <b>And if one made</b> it, <b>he is exempt</b> from bringing a sin-offering by Torah law, <b>but it is prohibited</b> by rabbinic decree. If <b>there was a string or a cord wrapped around it</b> before Shabbat, and the cloak was attached to the string while folded, <b>it is permitted to</b> spread it and <b>stretch it <i>ab initio</i>.</b>

### Part 12
On a related issue, <b>Rav Kahana raised a dilemma before Rav:</b> In the case of <b>a canopy, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is it permitted to spread it on Shabbat? <b>He said to him: Even a bed is prohibited.</b> Rav Kahana asked: With regard to <b>a bed, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>He said to him: Even a canopy is permitted.</b> Rav Kahana again asked: In the case of <b>a bed and a canopy, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>He said to him: A canopy is prohibited, and a bed is permitted.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this is <b>not difficult,</b> as the responses do not in fact contradict one another. Rather, <b>when he said: Even a bed is prohibited,</b> this is referring to folding beds <b>like those of the Carmanians.</b> Unfolding them is considered like making a tent. <b>When he said: Even a canopy is permitted,</b> this is referring to spreading the canopy in the manner explained by <b>Rami bar Yeḥezkel.</b> The canopy was bound by a string from before Shabbat. When he said: <b>A canopy is prohibited, and a bed is permitted,</b> this is referring to beds and canopies <b>like ours,</b> which do not fold. A bed of that kind involves no building. However, spreading canopies is performed in a manner similar to constructing a tent.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Yosef said: I saw the canopies of the house of Rav Huna that were spread out in the evening, and in the morning they were cast off and lying</b> on the ground. This indicates that it is permitted to dismantle and spread them on Shabbat.

### Part 15
<b>Rav said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya:</b> With regard to <b>a curtain, it is permitted to spread it, and it is permitted to dismantle it.</b> Since a curtain has no roof, neither action constitutes establishing a tent.

### Part 16
<b>And Shmuel said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya:</b>
