### Part 1
If <b>one circumcised but did not uncover</b> the flesh at <b>the</b> area of the <b>circumcision</b> by folding back the thin membrane beneath the foreskin, <b>it is as if he had not circumcised.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Avina said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> When the mishna said most of the corona, they meant <b>the flesh that covers most of the height of the corona,</b> as well as most of its circumference.

### Part 3
We learned in the mishna: <b>If</b> the baby <b>was fleshy,</b> the circumcisor corrects the circumcision so that it will not appear uncircumcised. <b>Shmuel said: A child who is encumbered with flesh, one examines him,</b> and <b>as long as when</b> his limb <b>hardens he looks circumcised, one need not circumcise</b> him again. <b>And if not,</b> meaning he does not appear circumcised even then, <b>one must circumcise</b> him again.

### Part 4
<b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i></b> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A child who is encumbered with flesh, one examines him,</b> and <b>as long as when it hardens it does not appear circumcised, one needs to circumcise him</b> again, <b>and if not, one need not circumcise him</b> again.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between these</b> two formulations? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> in a case where he <b>appears</b> circumcised but <b>does not appear</b> fully circumcised. According to Shmuel, in order to avoid an additional circumcision, one must appear fully circumcised, and this state is insufficient. According to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, only one who appears uncircumcised requires further circumcision; this partial circumcision is adequate.

### Part 6
We learned in the mishna: If <b>he circumcised</b> a child <b>but did not uncover</b> the area of the circumcision, it is as if he did not circumcise him. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i> that <b>one who circumcises</b> a child <b>recites: Who has made us holy through His commandments, and commanded us concerning circumcision. The father of the</b> circumcised <b>child recites: Who has made us holy through His commandments, and commanded us to bring him into the covenant of Abraham, our father. Those standing</b> there <b>recite: Just as he has entered into the covenant, so may he enter into Torah, marriage, and good deeds.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And the one who recites the</b> additional <b>blessing says: Who made the beloved one holy from the womb, marked the decree in his flesh, and gave his descendants the seal and the sign of the holy covenant. Therefore, as a reward for this, the living God, our Portion, commanded to deliver the beloved of our flesh from destruction, for the sake of His covenant that He set in our flesh. Blessed are You, Lord, Who establishes the covenant.</b>

### Part 8
<b>One who circumcises converts says: Blessed are You, Lord, our God, King of the universe, Who made us holy with His commandments, and commanded us concerning circumcision. And the one who recites the</b> additional <b>blessing recites: Who has made us holy with His commandments, and commanded us to circumcise converts, and to drip from them covenantal blood, as were it not for the blood of the covenant, the heaven and earth would not be sustained, as it is stated: “If My covenant would not be with day and night, the ordinances of heaven and earth I would not have placed”</b> (Jeremiah 33:25), which is interpreted to mean that were it not for the covenant of circumcision that is manifest both day and night, the world would cease to exist. He concludes the blessing with the phrase: <b>Blessed are You, Lord, Who establishes the covenant.</b>

### Part 9
When a Jew buys a Canaanite slave, he is obligated to circumcise the slave, as the slave is partially entering the covenant of the Jewish people. <b>One who circumcises slaves recites</b> a blessing: <b>Who made us holy with His commandments, and commanded us concerning circumcision. And the one who recites the additional blessings says</b> a blessing similar to those mentioned above: <b>Who made us holy with His commandments, and commanded us to circumcise slaves, and to drip from them covenantal blood, as were it not for the blood of the covenant the heaven and earth would not be sustained, as it is stated: “If My covenant would not be with day and night, the ordinances of heaven and earth I would not have placed”</b> (Jeremiah 33:25). <b>Blessed are You, Lord, Who establishes the covenant.</b>
