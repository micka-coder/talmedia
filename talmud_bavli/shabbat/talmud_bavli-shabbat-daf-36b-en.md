<b>What is the practical</b> halakhic <b>difference</b> that emerges from this change of names? It is in the area <b>of women’s bills of divorce.</b> With regard to bills of divorce, special care is devoted to ensuring that the name of the place where the bill is written is not altered. Therefore, it is important to be aware that Babylon underwent a name change in later generations.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a stove that was lit</b> on Shabbat eve <b>with straw</b> or <b>with rakings,</b> scraps collected from the field, one may <b>place</b> a pot of <b>cooked food atop it</b> on Shabbat. The fire in this stove was certainly extinguished while it was still day, as both straw and rakings are materials that burn quickly. However, if the stove was lit <b>with pomace,</b> pulp that remains from sesame seeds, olives, and the like after the oil is squeezed from them, <b>and</b> if it was lit <b>with wood,</b> one may <b>not place</b> a pot atop it on Shabbat <b>until he sweeps</b> the coals from the stove while it is still day <b>or until he places ashes</b> on the coals, so that the fire will not ignite on Shabbat. <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Even after one has swept away the coals, it is only permitted to place <b>hot water</b> on it, as it is sufficiently hot and does not require additional cooking, <b>but not cooked food.</b> Since, in general, one prefers that food will cook more, there is concern lest he come to ignite the fire by stoking the coals. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> Both <b>hot water and cooked food</b> may be placed. <b>Beit Shammai say: One may remove</b> a pot from the stove on Shabbat <b>but</b> may <b>not return</b> it. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> One may <b>even return it.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The students <b>raised a dilemma</b> with regard to the explanation of the mishna. <b>That</b> which we learned in the mishna: One may <b>not place, does it</b> mean that <b>one may not return</b> a pot that he took off the fire and wishes to return on Shabbat; <b>however, to leave</b> the pot from Shabbat eve into Shabbat, <b>one may leave</b> it <b>even though</b> this stove <b>is not swept</b> of its coals <b>and</b> its coals <b>are not covered with ashes? And,</b> according to this, <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is it</b> in this mishna? <b>It</b> is the opinion of <b>Ḥananya. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, <b>Ḥananya says: Any</b> food <b>that</b> has already been cooked to the extent <b>of the food of ben Drosai,</b> who would only cook his food the minimum amount necessary, <b>one is permitted to leave it atop a stove</b> on Shabbat <b>even though</b> the stove <b>is not swept and not covered with ashes. Or perhaps,</b> that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: One may not place, means one may not <b>leave</b> it on the fire from Shabbat eve. <b>And if</b> the coals in the stove were <b>swept</b> or <b>covered with ashes, yes,</b> one may leave the pot on the stove. <b>And if not, no,</b> one may not leave it, <b>and all the more so</b> one may not <b>return</b> it to the stove on Shabbat under any circumstances.

### Part 5
In order to resolve this dilemma, the Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this <b>from the</b> fact <b>that two sections were taught in our mishna.</b> In the first, <b>Beit Shammai say: Hot water but not cooked food. And Beit Hillel say:</b> Both <b>hot water and cooked food.</b> And in the second, <b>Beit Shammai say: One may remove</b> it <b>but may not return</b> it. <b>And Beit Hillel say: One may even return</b> it. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that when <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that one may not place it means that it is prohibited <b>to leave</b> it; in that case, the mishna <b>is teaching as follows:</b> With regard to <b>a stove that was lit with straw</b> or <b>with rakings, one may leave cooked food on it.</b> If it was lit <b>with pomace</b> or <b>with wood, one may not leave</b> the cooked food on it <b>until he sweeps</b> the coals <b>out</b> while it is still day <b>or until he places ashes on it. And what may they leave? Beit Shammai say: Hot water but not cooked food. And Beit Hillel say:</b> One may leave both <b>hot water and cooked food</b> on it. <b>And just as</b> they <b>disagree with regard to leaving</b> a pot on the stove, <b>so too,</b> they <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether or not it is permitted <b>to return</b> it to the stove. <b>As Beit Shammai say: One may take</b> the pot from the stove on Shabbat <b>but may not return</b> it to the stove at all. <b>And Beit Hillel say: One may even return</b> it.

### Part 6
<b>However, if you say</b> that when <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that one may not place, it means that it is prohibited <b>to return</b> it, then the mishna <b>is teaching as follows: A stove that was lit with straw</b> or <b>with rakings, one may return cooked food onto it.</b> If it was lit <b>with pomace</b> or <b>with wood, one may not return</b> cooked food to it <b>until one sweeps</b> the coals <b>out</b> while it is still day <b>or until one places ashes</b> on them. <b>And what may they return? Beit Shammai say: Hot water but not cooked food. And Beit Hillel say:</b> Both <b>hot water and cooked food. Beit Shammai say: One may remove but may not return. And Beit Hillel say: One may even return.</b> If in the first section the question of what may be returned was already addressed, <b>why do I need this additional</b> dispute in the second section? The gist of Beit Shammai’s statement that cooked food may not be returned to the stove is that one may remove but may not return. Apparently, the mishna can only be understood in accordance with the first explanation. The first clause discusses leaving and the latter clause discusses returning.
