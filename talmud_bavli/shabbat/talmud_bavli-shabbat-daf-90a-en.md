### Part 1
<b>They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>in</b> the case of <b>sweet types, because they are fit</b> to be mixed together <b>to sweeten</b> the food in a <b>pot.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that they join together with one another is <b>that they are suitable to sweeten the</b> food in a <b>pot</b> together. <b>However,</b> if <b>that is not so,</b> then they <b>do not</b> join together with one another. Apparently, spices, in general, do not join together to constitute a complete measure. The Gemara answers: <b>Here, too,</b> the mishna is referring to a case where <b>they are suitable to sweeten</b> the food in a pot.

### Part 2
We learned in the mishna: The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>nutshells, pomegranate peels, safflower and madder,</b> which are used to produce dyes, is <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to dye a small garment</b> that is placed atop a woman’s hairnet. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raised a contradiction</b> from what we learned elsewhere in a mishna: <b>One who carries out herbs</b> that were <b>soaked</b> in water is liable if he carried out a measure <b>equivalent</b> to the amount used <b>to dye a sample</b> the size of a stopper, <b>for the shuttle</b> of a loom. This refers to a small swath of wool that a weaver places on the loom, as a color sample. The herbs were soaked in water because this was how they were prepared for use as dyes. Apparently, according to this Gemara, the measure for liability is not the amount used to dye a small garment. The Gemara replies: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b> In the case of soaked dyes, the measure for liability is smaller <b>because a person does not</b> go to the <b>trouble to soak herbs</b> just <b>to dye a sample for</b> the <b>shuttle</b> of a loom. He will only begin soaking herbs to dye a more significant garment. However, for herbs that are soaking and are ready for use as a dye, the measure for liability is smaller, i.e., sufficient to dye a sample.

### Part 3
The mishna mentioned abrasive materials used for laundry, among them <b>urine.</b> The Gemara clarifies the nature of the listed materials. The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The urine mentioned in the mishna is <b>urine that is up to forty days old.</b> After that, its acidity weakens, rendering it unsuitable for that purpose. With regard to the <b>natron,</b> the Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: This refers to <b>Alexandrian natron</b> from the city in Egypt, <b>and not</b> to <b>natron</b> from <b>Anpantrin,</b> which is of a different quality. With regard to the <b><i>borit</i></b> mentioned in the mishna, <b>Rav Yehuda said: That is sand.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Borit</i> and sand?</b> Since both terms are listed, <i>borit</i> cannot be sand. <b>Rather, what is <i>borit</i>?</b> It is <b>sulphur.</b>

### Part 4
<b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> based on plants whose use is prohibited during the Sabbatical year. <b>They added</b> bulbs of <b>ornithogalum and wormwood, and <i>borit</i>, and aloe. And if it would enter your mind</b> to say that <i>borit</i> is <b>sulphur, is there sulphur</b> that is subject to the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of the Sabbatical year? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna that <b>this is the principle: Anything that has a root</b> and grows <b>is</b> subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the Sabbatical year, and</b> anything <b>that does not have a root is not</b> subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the Sabbatical year. Rather, what</b> is the <b><i>borit</i>?</b> It is <b>aloe.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And <i>borit</i> and aloe?</b> Since both terms are listed, <i>borit</i> cannot be aloe. <b>Rather,</b> there are <b>two types</b> of <b>aloe.</b> One of them is called <i>borit</i>.

### Part 5
With regard to the <b>cimolian earth</b> mentioned in the mishna, <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> This is the earth referred to as <b>pull out stick in [<i>shelof dotz</i>].</b> With regard to the <b><i>eshlag</i></b> mentioned in the mishna, <b>Shmuel said: I asked all of the seafarers</b> with regard to the identity of <i>eshlag</i>, <b>and they told me</b> that <b>it is called <i>shonana</i>, and</b> can be <b>found in the shell of the pearl, and is removed using an iron skewer.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>pepper</b> on Shabbat is <b>any amount.</b> Similarly, the measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>tar</b> is <b>any amount.</b> The measure that determines liability for carrying out various <b>kinds of perfumes and</b> various <b>kinds of metals</b> is <b>any amount.</b> The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>stones of the altar or earth of the altar,</b> sacred scrolls or their coverings that became tattered due to an insect called <b><i>mekek</i></b> that destroys <b>scrolls, and <i>mekek</i></b> that destroys <b>their coverings,</b> is <b>any amount. That</b> is because people <b>store them</b> in order <b>to bury them,</b> due to their sanctity, and accord significance to even a small measure of those items. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even one who carries out accessories of idolatry</b> on Shabbat is liable for carrying out <b>any amount, as it is stated: “And there shall cleave nothing of the proscribed items to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18). Since even the smallest amount is prohibited and must be burned, any amount is significant.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> use <b>is any amount of pepper suited?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>For</b> dispelling <b>mouth odor. For what</b> use <b>is any amount of tar suited?</b> It is suited for curing a <b>headache.</b> We learned in the mishna that one is liable for carrying out <b>any amount</b> of various <b>kinds of perfumes</b> on Shabbat. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Even <b>one who carries out</b> an object with <b>a foul odor</b> on Shabbat for medicinal or similar purposes, is liable for carrying out <b>any amount.</b> The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>fine</b> perfumed <b>oil</b> is <b>any amount.</b> The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>purple dye</b> is <b>any amount.</b> The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>a virgin rosebud</b> on Shabbat is <b>one</b> bud.

### Part 8
We learned in the mishna: The measure that determines liability for carrying out various <b>kinds of metals</b> is <b>any amount.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> use <b>is any amount of metal suited,</b> that it renders one liable for carrying it out? <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Because</b> a small amount of iron <b>is fit to make a small nail.</b>

### Part 9
Since the Gemara is discussing the measure that determines liability for carrying out metal on Shabbat, it discusses the related <i>halakhot</i> of objects consecrated to the Temple. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who</b> vows without specifying an amount, and <b>says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>iron</b> to the Temple, <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say: He must</b> donate <b>no less than a cubit by a cubit</b> of iron. The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> use <b>is</b> metal that size <b>suited? Rav Yosef said: For a raven impediment.</b> The roof of the Temple was covered with iron surfaces with protruding nails to prevent ravens from perching there. <b>And some say</b> a slightly different version. <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say: He must</b> donate <b>no less than</b> the iron necessary for <b>a raven impediment. And how much</b> iron is that? <b>Rav Yosef said: A cubit by a cubit.</b> One who vows to donate <b>copper must</b> donate <b>no less than</b> the value of <b>a <i>ma’a</i> of silver. It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One must</b> donate <b>no less than</b> the amount needed to forge <b>a small copper hook.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> Temple use <b>is</b> that <b>suited? Abaye said: They</b> use <b>it</b> to <b>scrape the wicks</b> from the candelabrum, <b>and clean</b> the <b>lamps</b> with it.

### Part 10
We learned in the mishna: The measure that determines liability for carrying out sacred scrolls or their coverings that became tattered due to an insect called <b><i>mekek</i></b> that destroys <b>scrolls, and</b> another type of <b><i>mekek</i></b> that destroys their <b>coverings,</b> is any amount. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> These insects, the <b><i>mekek</i></b> that destroys <b>scrolls,</b> the <b><i>tekhakh</i></b> that attacks <b>silk, and</b> the <b><i>ila</i></b> that eats <b>grapes, and</b> the <b><i>pe</i></b> that eats <b>figs, and</b> the <b><i>ha</i></b> that eats <b>pomegranates, all</b> pose <b>danger</b> to one who swallows them. The Gemara relates: <b>A certain student was sitting before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> and <b>was eating figs.</b> The student <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>My teacher, are there thorns in figs?</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: The <i>pe</i> killed that</b> fellow. The insect in the fig had punctured the student’s throat.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who carries out a merchant’s basket, even if there are many types</b> of spices and jewelry <b>in it, is obligated</b> to bring <b>only one sin-offering,</b> because he performed only one act of carrying out. The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>garden seeds</b> on Shabbat is <b>less than a fig-bulk. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> The measure for liability is <b>five</b> seeds.
