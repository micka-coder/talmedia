### Part 1
The mishna lists items that a woman may or may not carry into, or wear in the public domain on Shabbat. This depends on whether the particular object is considered an ornament, which she may wear, or merely a burden for the woman, which she may not. Even if it is considered an ornament, there is still concern that she might remove it and carry it in her hand in the public domain, which is prohibited by Torah law.<br><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>With what</b> items may <b>a woman go out</b> into the public domain on Shabbat <b>and with what</b> items may <b>she not go out?</b>

### Part 2
<b>A woman may neither go out with strings of wool, nor with strings of flax, nor with strips</b> of any other materials that a woman braids <b>in</b> the hair of <b>her head. And</b> a woman <b>may not immerse</b> in a ritual bath <b>with them</b> in her hair <b>until she loosens them.</b> When the strings or strips are tight, the water cannot reach her hair unobstructed, invalidating her immersion.

### Part 3
<b>And,</b> likewise, a woman may <b>neither</b> go out <b>with</b> the ornament called <b><i>totefet</i>, nor with <i>sarvitin</i> that are not sewn</b> into her head covering, <b>nor with a <i>kavul</i> into the public domain.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And,</b> likewise, a woman may <b>neither</b> go out <b>with a city of gold</b> ornament, <b>nor with a <i>katla</i></b> ornament, <b>nor with nose rings, nor with a ring that has no seal on it, nor with a needle that is not perforated,</b> which are merely for decorative purposes.

### Part 5
<b>And if she</b> unwittingly <b>went out</b> wearing any of these, <b>she is not liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> According to Torah law, a woman is permitted to go out into the public domain wearing ornaments. However, the Sages decreed that a woman may not go out wearing certain ornaments, lest she remove them to show them to another and inadvertently carry them four cubits in the public domain.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Immersion, who mentioned</b> anything about <b>that?</b> The mishna is dealing with the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, so why did it mention the <i>halakhot</i> of immersion?

### Part 7
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh</b> said: When the mishna <b>states</b> the <i>halakha</i>, it employs the style known as: <b>What is the reason.</b> The mention of immersion is an explanation, not a superfluous addition. The mishna should be understood as follows: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>a woman may neither go out with strings of wool nor with strings of flax?</b> It is <b>because the Sages said</b> that <b>on weekdays she may not immerse with them until she loosens them. And since on weekdays she may not immerse with them until she loosens them, on Shabbat she may not go out</b> with them, <b>lest</b> a situation requiring <b>immersion</b> for the purpose of a <b>mitzva come about, and she untie them, and come to carry them four cubits in the public domain.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Kahana raised a dilemma before Rav:</b> With regard to strings made into <b>hollow chains, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it permissible for women to go out into the public domain with them on Shabbat or not? It depends on whether they are considered an interposition to immersion. Rav <b>said to him: Woven, you say?</b> With regard to <b>anything woven, the Sages did not issue a decree.</b> Because water reaches the hair unobstructed, there is no need to loosen the hollow chain and there is no concern lest she carry it in the public domain. <b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> With regard to <b>anything woven, the Sages did not issue a decree.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And some say</b> that <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: I saw that my sisters are not particular about</b> removing <b>them,</b> and they bathe even with woven chains tied in their hair. Apparently, water reaches the hair. Therefore, the chain is not an interposition with regard to immersion.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> practical difference <b>is there between this version and that version</b> of the resolution of the dilemma?

### Part 11
The Gemara explains: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> in a case <b>where</b> the chains <b>are dirty. According to this version,</b> in <b>which you said:</b> With regard to <b>anything woven, the Sages did not issue a decree, these too are woven. And according to that version,</b> in <b>which you said</b> that it is <b>due to</b> the fact that his sisters were not <b>particular;</b> in this case, <b>since they are dirty, she is particular about them</b> and will certainly remove them when she washes. Therefore, she is required to do so when immersing in a ritual bath as well.

### Part 12
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna in tractate <i>Mikvaot</i>: <b>And these</b> are the objects that <b>interpose for a person: Strings of wool, and strings of flax, and the straps that are on the girls’ heads. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Strings <b>of wool and</b> strands <b>of hair do not interpose because the water reaches</b> the hair <b>through them. Rav Huna said: And we learned all these,</b> strings of wool and flax, in a case where they are used to tie the hair <b>on the girls’ heads.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav Yosef strongly objects to</b> this <i>halakha</i> of Rav Huna: <b>To exclude what</b> other places in the body did Rav Huna say this? <b>If you say</b> that it comes <b>to exclude</b> strings tied <b>to the neck, and</b> then, strings made <b>of what</b> material does it exclude? <b>If you say</b> that it comes <b>to exclude</b> strings <b>of wool, now,</b> the mishna stated that <b>soft</b> strings of wool <b>on top of</b> hair, which is relatively <b>hard, interpose</b> and invalidates the immersion. With regard to <b>soft</b> strings <b>on top of</b> the <b>soft</b> flesh of the neck, <b>is it necessary</b> to say that they interpose?

### Part 14
<b>Rather,</b> say that Rav Huna’s statement came <b>to exclude strings of flax.</b> A similar difficulty arises: <b>Now</b> the mishna stated that <b>hard</b> strings of wool <b>on top of</b> hair, which is <b>hard, interposes</b> and invalidates the immersion. If so, with regard to <b>hard</b> strings <b>on top of</b> the <b>soft</b> flesh of the neck, <b>is it necessary</b> to say that they interpose?

### Part 15
<b>Rather, Rav Yosef said, this is the reason that Rav Huna</b> restricts the concern for interposition to strings tied in her hair and not around her neck: <b>Because a woman does not strangle herself</b> when adorning herself with a string or straps around her neck. Therefore, she never tightens the strings or straps to the extent that water cannot reach the skin.

### Part 16
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> the explanation of Rav Yosef from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The girls</b> may <b>go out</b> into the public domain on Shabbat <b>with strings in their ears.</b> Young girls would have their ears pierced, but earrings were not placed in their ears until they were older. Instead, they inserted strings so that the holes would not close. <b>However,</b> they may <b>not</b> go out <b>with straps</b> around <b>their necks. And if you say</b> that the principle: <b>A woman does not strangle herself,</b> is halakhically valid, <b>why</b> may they <b>not</b> go out into the public domain with <b>straps around their necks?</b> They are not tied tight and do not constitute an interposition that invalidates immersion.
