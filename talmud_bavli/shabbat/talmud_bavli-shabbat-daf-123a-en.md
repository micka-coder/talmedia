### Part 1
Using <b>an object whose</b> primary <b>function</b> is <b>for a prohibited</b> use, <b>for the purpose</b> of utilizing the object <b>itself</b> to perform a permitted action, is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>A mortar, if it</b> still <b>has garlic in it, one may move it</b> on Shabbat, <b>and if not, one may not move it.</b> Apparently, under no circumstances may a mortar be used, even for an action that is generally permitted on Shabbat, because the mortar’s primary function is prohibited.

### Part 3
Rabba <b>said to him:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya, who says: A vessel may not be moved</b> on Shabbat <b>except for the purpose of its</b> designated <b>use.</b>

### Part 4
Abaye <b>raised</b> another <b>objection</b> to Rabba’s opinion. We learned in a mishna that <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not take a</b> large <b>pestle</b> from a mortar, which is typically used for a prohibited action, in order <b>to cut meat on it</b> for the purpose of a Festival. <b>And Beit Hillel permit</b> doing so due to the mitzva of rejoicing on the Festival. <b>And everyone agrees</b> that <b>if one cut meat on it</b> for the purpose of the Festival, <b>that it is</b> then <b>prohibited to move it</b> because there is no further need for it on the Festival. Apparently, it is prohibited to use an object whose primary function is for a prohibited use, even to perform a permitted action.

### Part 5
Initially, Rabba <b>thought to respond to</b> Abaye’s objection by saying that this mishna, too, is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya,</b> that a vessel may only be moved on Shabbat for the purpose of its designated use. However, he changed his mind <b>once he heard that</b> which <b>Rav Ḥinana bar Shelemya said in the name of Rav: Everyone agrees in the case of launderers’ pins, presses, and clothing rods</b> (<i>Arukh</i>), that <b>since</b> one <b>is particular about them</b> to ensure that they remain intact, he <b>designates a place for them</b> and does not move them for other purposes. Therefore, everyone agrees that it is prohibited to move them. <b>Here, too,</b> the mortar and pestle are specifically designated for a particular use and <b>one designates a place for them;</b> therefore, it is prohibited to move them.

### Part 6
<b>It was stated</b> that there was another amoraic dispute on this topic. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It was with regard to <b>the hammer of goldsmiths that we learned</b> it may be used to crack nuts. Although the goldsmith is particular about ensuring that the hammer remains smooth and avoids using it for any purpose other than its particular use, nevertheless, it was allowed to be used for other permitted actions. <b>Rav Shemen bar Abba said:</b> It was with regard to <b>the hammer of spice merchants that we learned</b> it may be used to crack nuts.

### Part 7
The Gemara explains: <b>The one who said</b> it is permitted to crack nuts on Shabbat using <b>the hammer of spice merchants, all the more so</b> that it is permitted to use a hammer typically used by <b>goldsmiths.</b> However, <b>the one who said</b> that it is only permitted to use a hammer used by <b>goldsmiths, but</b> with regard to the hammer <b>of spice merchants,</b> the merchant <b>is particular about it</b> and would not allow it to be used for cracking nuts. Use for other purposes would cause the hammer to absorb foreign smells, which would ruin the spices.

### Part 8
And we learned in the mishna: one may move <b>a reed or a shuttle [<i>karkar</i>]</b> in order to stick it into food. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an unripe fig that one buried in straw</b> to accelerate its ripening, <b>and</b> likewise with regard to <b>a cake that one buried in coals</b> in order to heat it, <b>if part of it is exposed, it is permitted to move it</b> on Shabbat. <b>And if not,</b> and it was completely covered, <b>it is prohibited to move it</b> lest one come to carry straw or coals, which are set-aside, along with it. It is prohibited for one to move set-aside objects or to cause them to be moved.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Elazar ben Tadai says: One may insert a reed or a shuttle</b> into an unripe fig or a cake that is buried in coals to remove it from its place, <b>and</b> the straw and the coals <b>are shaken off on their own. Rav Naḥman says: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Tadai.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that Rav Naḥman holds: Moving</b> an object <b>in an atypical manner is not</b> considered to be a bona fide act of <b>moving</b> and is permitted on Shabbat? <b>Didn’t Rav Naḥman say: This radish</b> that was buried in the dirt to protect it, if it was inserted <b>from the top to bottom,</b> i.e., the wider part of the radish is closer to the surface and the narrower part is farther, it is <b>permitted</b> to remove it from the dirt. If it was inserted <b>from bottom to top,</b> and the wider part was farther from the surface, <b>it is prohibited</b> because he thereby moves the dirt. Apparently, Rav Naḥman prohibits moving set-aside items even if one does so in an atypical manner. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Naḥman reversed</b> his opinion with regard to <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> of the radish.

### Part 11
We learned in the mishna: One is permitted to take <b>an</b> ordinary <b>hand needle</b> used for sewing clothes <b>to extract</b> a thorn <b>with it. Rava, son of Rabba, sent</b> the following question <b>to Rav Yosef: Let our teacher teach us:</b> With regard to a <b>needle whose eye or point was removed, what is its</b> legal status, i.e., is moving it on Shabbat permitted?

### Part 12
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: You</b> already <b>learned</b> the answer to that question in the mishna: One is permitted to take <b>an</b> ordinary <b>hand needle</b> used for sewing clothes <b>to extract a thorn with it. And what does the thorn</b> that is stuck in his flesh <b>care whether</b> the needle <b>has an eye or whether it does not have an eye?</b> Since the needle is suited for that purpose, it is permitted to move it.

### Part 13
Rava, son of Rabba, <b>raised an objection to</b> Rav Yosef from that which we learned in a mishna: A ritually impure <b>needle whose eye or point was removed</b> becomes <b>ritually pure,</b> because its status as a vessel is negated. Since it is no longer considered a vessel, why would it be permitted to move it?

### Part 14
<b>Abaye said: Are you raising a contradiction from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>ritual impurity to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat?</b> With regard to <b>ritual impurity, we require a functional utensil</b> for it to become ritually impure or to retain impurity, and anything which is not functional is ritually pure. However, <b>with regard to Shabbat we require something that is fit</b> for use, <b>and this too is fit to extract</b> a <b>thorn with it,</b> and therefore, its legal status is that of a utensil and moving it is permitted.

### Part 15
<b>Rava said:</b> The one <b>who raises the objection, raises the objection well. From</b> the fact that <b>with regard to ritual impurity it is not</b> considered <b>a utensil, with regard to Shabbat, it is also not</b> considered <b>a utensil,</b> and if it is not a utensil it may not be moved on Shabbat.

### Part 16
The Gemara <b>raises an objection to</b> the opinion of Rava based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A needle, whether it is perforated or whether it is not perforated, it is permitted to move it on Shabbat. And they said</b> that the status of a <b>perforated</b> needle is different <b>only with regard to ritual impurity alone.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Abaye interpreted it according to the opinion of Rava:</b> In this mishna, <b>we are dealing with unfinished</b> needles. <b>Sometimes one decides</b> to <b>render them a utensil</b> for other purposes without perforating them. <b>However,</b> in a case <b>where its eye or its point was removed</b> from the finished needle, its status as a vessel was negated, since <b>a person throws it among the junk [<i>gerutaot</i>].</b>

### Part 18
With regard to the matter of <b>aligning the</b> limbs of an <b>infant</b> on Shabbat when it is necessary to do so, <b>Rav Naḥman prohibits</b> doing so on Shabbat, due to concern that it is similar to the prohibited labor of completing the production process of a vessel, <b>and Rav Sheshet permits</b> doing so. <b>Rav Naḥman says: From where do I say</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>As we learned in a mishna: One may not make</b>
