### Part 1
<b>on black wine?</b> Sitting <b>on a wide divan or on a narrow divan? With a good friend or a bad friend? And Rav Ḥisda said: And all these</b> allude <b>to promiscuity.</b> These are all euphemisms for different types of women. Well-kneaded bread refers to a woman who is not a virgin; white wine refers to a fair-complexioned woman; a wide divan refers to a fat woman; a good friend refers to a good-looking woman.

### Part 2
On the topic of Jerusalem, <b>Raḥava said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: The logs of Jerusalem</b> used for fuel <b>were from</b> the <b>cinnamon</b> tree, <b>and when they would ignite them, their fragrance would waft through all of Eretz Yisrael. And since Jerusalem was destroyed, these</b> fragrant logs <b>were buried, and only a</b> sliver the size of a grain of <b>barley remains, and it is located in the treasury of [<i>gazzai</i>] Tzimtzemai the queen.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Just as it is prohibited for a woman to carry out certain items unique to a woman into the public domain, the Sages said that <b>a man may neither go out</b> on Shabbat <b>with a sword, nor with a bow, nor with a shield [<i>teris</i>], nor with an <i>alla</i>, nor with a spear. And if he</b> unwittingly <b>went out</b> with one of these weapons to the public domain <b>he is liable to bring a sin-offering.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says: These</b> weapons <b>are ornaments for him;</b> just as a man is permitted to go out into the public domain with other ornaments, he is permitted to go out with weapons.

### Part 5
<b>And the Rabbis say: They are nothing other than reprehensible</b> and in the future they will be eliminated, <b>as it is written: “And they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation will not raise sword against nation, neither will they learn war anymore”</b> (Isaiah 2:4).

### Part 6
With regard to women’s ornaments, they added that <b>a garter</b> placed on her leg to hold up stockings <b>is pure</b> and cannot become ritually impure as a utensil, <b>and she may</b> even <b>go out with it on Shabbat.</b>

### Part 7
However, <b>ankle chains,</b> which were also women’s ornaments, can become ritually <b>impure, and she may not go out with them on Shabbat.</b>

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the term <b><i>alla</i>?</b> It means <b>club [<i>kulpa</i>].</b>

### Part 9
We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: These</b> weapons <b>are ornaments for him. It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that elaborates on this subject: The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Eliezer: And since,</b> in your opinion, <b>they are ornaments for him, why are they</b> to be <b>eliminated in the messianic era? He said to them: They will not be needed</b> anymore, <b>as it is stated: “Nation will not raise sword against nation”</b> (Isaiah 2:4). The Gemara asks: <b>And let the weapons be merely for ornamental</b> purposes, even though they will not be needed for war. <b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>just as in</b> the case of <b>a candle in the afternoon.</b> Since its light is not needed, it serves no ornamental purpose. Weapons, too; when not needed for war, they serve no ornamental purpose either.

### Part 10
<b>And</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, as Shmuel said: The only difference between this world and the messianic era is subjugation of the exiles</b> to other kingdoms, from which the Jewish people will be released. However, in other respects, the world will remain as it is, <b>as it is written: “Because the poor will not cease from within the land”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:11). Society will not change, and wars will continue to be waged.

### Part 11
However, <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> who disagrees with Shmuel. <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: All of the prophets only prophesied with regard to the messianic era; however, with regard to the World-to-Come</b> it was stated: <b>“No eye sees, God, except You,</b> that which He will do for he that waits for Him” (Isaiah 64:3). What will be in the World-to-Come cannot be depicted even by means of prophecy.

### Part 12
<b>And some say</b> the disagreement between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis was different. <b>They said to Rabbi Eliezer: Since</b> in your opinion <b>they are ornaments for him</b>, <b>why will they be eliminated in the messianic era? He said to them: Even in the messianic era they will not be eliminated. And that is</b> in accordance with <b>that which Shmuel</b> stated that the world will remain fundamentally the same, <b>and</b> he <b>disagrees with Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Abaye said to Rav Dimi, and some say</b> it was <b>to Rav Avya, and some say Rav Yosef said to Rav Dimi, and some say</b> it was <b>to Rav Avya, and some say Abaye said to Rav Yosef: What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer who said: These</b> weapons <b>are ornaments for him? As it is written: “Gird your sword upon your thigh, mighty one, your glory and your splendor”</b> (Psalms 45:4), indicating that a sword is considered an ornament.

### Part 14
The Gemara relates that some time later <b>Rav Kahana said to Mar, son of Rav Huna:</b> Is that really a proof? <b>This</b> verse <b>is written in reference to matters of Torah</b> and should be interpreted as a metaphor. <b>He said to him:</b> Nevertheless, <b>a verse does not depart from its literal meaning,</b> although there may be additional homiletical interpretations.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Kahana said</b> about this: <b>When I was eighteen years old and</b> had already <b>learned the entire Talmud, and</b> yet <b>I did not know that a verse does not depart from its literal meaning until now.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Kahana <b>teaching us</b> with that statement? The Gemara answers: He comes to teach <b>that a person should</b> first <b>learn and then understand</b> the rationale.

### Part 16
<b><i>Zarot</i></b> is a <b>mnemonic</b> acronym for Elazar [<i>zayin</i>], Reish Lakish [<i>reish</i>], and their students [<i>vav</i>, <i>tav</i>], the <i>amoraim</i> who interpreted the verse in Psalms cited above

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Two Torah scholars who sharpen one another in <i>halakha</i>; the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> ensures <b>success for them, as it is written: “And in your majesty [<i>vahadarkha</i>] prosper,</b> ride on, in behalf of truth and meekness and righteousness; and let your right hand teach you tremendous things” (Psalms 45:5). The Sages said: <br><b>Do not read “and your majesty [<i>vahadarkha</i>],” rather,</b> by changing some of the vocalization and the letters, read it as <b>and He will sharpen you [<i>veḥidedkha</i>],</b> and ultimately you will be successful. <br><b>Moreover, they</b> who act in that manner will <b>rise to prominence, as it is written: “Prosper, ride on.”</b> <br><b>I might have thought even</b> if one engages in the study of Torah <b>not for its own sake;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “On behalf of truth.”</b> <br><b>I might have thought</b> that one would be rewarded with prosperity even <b>if he became arrogant;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “Meekness</b> and <b>righteousness.”</b> <br><b>And if they do so</b> in the proper manner <b>they merit the Torah that was given with the right hand</b> of the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>as it is written: “And let your right hand teach you tremendous things”</b> (Psalms 45:5).

### Part 18
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: They are rewarded with the matters stated with regard to the right</b> hand <b>of the Torah. As Rava bar Rav Sheila said and some say Rav Yosef bar Ḥama said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written, “Length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand are riches and honor”</b> (Proverbs 3:16)? Is that to say, <b>however,</b> that <b>in her right</b> there <b>is length of days, but there are not riches and honor? Rather,</b> it means: <b>Those who relate to it with the</b> skilled <b>right</b> hand, i.e., who study Torah for its own sake and with proper intentions, <b>there is length of days and all the more so riches and honor</b> for them. Whereas, <b>those who relate to it with the</b> unskilled <b>left</b> hand, <b>there are riches and honor; there is not length of days.</b>

### Part 19
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Two Torah scholars who are agreeable to each other</b> when engaging <b>in</b> discussions of <b><i>halakha</i>, the Holy One, Blessed be He, listens to them, as it is stated: “Then they that feared the Lord spoke [<i>nidberu</i>]</b> one with another; and the Lord hearkened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His name” (Malachi 3:16). <b>And</b> the term <b>speech</b> [<b><i>dibbur</i></b>] <b>means nothing other than calm, as it is stated: “He subdues [<i>yadber</i>] people under us”</b> (Psalms 47:4). He will cause the nations to submit to the Jewish people leading to a period of calm. Here too the term <i>dibbur</i> indicates calm and agreeability.

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase in that verse: <b>“And those who thought of His name”? Rabbi Ami said: Even if one</b> merely <b>planned to perform a mitzva, and</b> ultimately <b>due to circumstances beyond his control did not perform</b> that mitzva, <b>the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as if he performed it.</b>

### Part 21
The Gemara continues in praise of those who perform mitzvot: <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Idi said: Anyone who performs a mitzva as it was commanded,</b> others <b>do not apprise him</b> of <b>bad tidings, as it is stated: “He who keeps the commandment shall know no evil thing”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:5).

### Part 22
<b>Rav Asi, and some say Rabbi Ḥanina said: Even if the Holy One, Blessed be He, issued a decree, He</b> may <b>abrogate it, as it is stated: “For the word of the King has authority and who may say to Him: What do You do?”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:4). <b>And,</b> although this indicates that even though the King, God, issued a decree, <b>juxtaposed to it</b> is the verse: <b>“He who guards the commandment shall know no evil thing”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:5). For one who observes mitzvot properly, the decree is abrogated and he will know no evil.

### Part 23
<b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Two Torah scholars who listen to each other in</b> the discussion of <b><i>halakha</i>, the Holy One, Blessed be He, hears their voice, as it is stated: “You who dwell in gardens, the companions heed your voice, cause me to hear it”</b> (Song of Songs 8:13).

### Part 24
<b>And if they do not do so,</b> i.e., they do not listen to each other, <b>they cause the Divine Presence to depart from</b> among <b>Israel, as it is stated</b> in the following verse: <b>“Run away, my beloved, and be like</b> a gazelle or a young hart upon the mountains of spices” (Song of Songs 8:14).

### Part 25
<b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Two</b> individual <b>Torah scholars who,</b> while studying together, <b>cause one another to err [<i>madgilim</i>] in <i>halakha</i></b> [<i>Tosafot</i>], nevertheless, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, loves them, as it is stated: “And his banner [<i>vediglo</i>] over me is love”</b> (Song of Songs 2:4). <b>Rava said: And that is</b> only true in a case <b>where they know the foundation of the law,</b> and their error resulted from the lack of more sophisticated knowledge. <b>And that is</b> only true in a case <b>where they do not have a prominent</b> person <b>in the city from whom</b> they could <b>learn</b> without error.

### Part 26
<b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: One who loans</b> another <b>money is greater than one who gives</b> him <b>charity. And the one who places</b> money <b>into</b> a common <b>purse,</b> i.e., one who enters into a partnership with a needy person, <b>is the greatest of them all,</b> since in that case the needy person is not embarrassed when receiving the assistance.

### Part 27
<b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> Even <b>if a Torah scholar is as vengeful and begrudging as a snake, wrap him</b> tightly around <b>your waist,</b> i.e., keep him close, because you will benefit from his Torah. On the other hand, even <b>if an <i>am ha’aretz</i> is righteous, do not dwell in his neighborhood,</b> as his righteousness does not compensate for the fact that he is ignorant.

### Part 28
<b>Rav Kahana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said, and some say Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Reish Lakish said, and some say Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Anyone who raises an evil dog within his home prevents kindness from</b> entering <b>into his home,</b> since poor people will hesitate to enter his house. As it is alluded to in the verse: <b>“To him that is afflicted [<i>lamas</i>],</b>
