<b>which has spittle.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And that which was taught</b> in the other <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may take</b> hay <b>from before an animal whose mouth is foul,</b> is referring to <b>a donkey.</b> Its mouth is foul <b>because it does not discern</b> between different foods <b>and</b> it <b>eats</b> everything. <b>And</b> the statement: <b>One may place it before an animal whose mouth is fine,</b> is referring <b>to a cow, which discerns</b> between different foods <b>and</b> only then <b>it eats.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>straw that is on top of a bed,</b> if a person wishes to lie on it, <b>he may not move it with his hand</b> to smooth it, as the straw is set aside for kindling; <b>rather, he may move it with his body.</b> Since moving straw with one’s body is not the usual manner, it is permitted. <b>And if</b> the straw <b>was</b> designated as <b>animal food, or a pillow or sheet was on it,</b> which would clearly indicate that the straw was placed on the bed so one could sleep on it, the straw is not considered set-aside, and <b>one may move it</b> even <b>with his hand.</b>

### Part 4
<b>A press which belongs to a homeowner, one may loosen it</b> on Shabbat. This press is used to dry and press clothing after laundering. One loosens it to remove clothing from it. <b>However, one may not press</b> clothing with it on Shabbat. <b>And</b> in the case of a press that <b>belongs to a launderer,</b> which is made specifically for pressing and requires professional expertise for its operation, <b>one may not touch it. Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> the launderer’s press <b>was loosened</b> somewhat <b>on Shabbat eve, he may loosen it completely</b> on Shabbat <b>and remove</b> the garment.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to moving items that are set aside, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rav Naḥman said: This radish,</b> which was buried in the earth, if it was buried <b>from top to bottom,</b> with its wide end at the top and its narrow end at the bottom, <b>it is permitted</b> to remove it on Shabbat. When the radish is buried in that manner, one does not move the earth when he removes the radish. However, if the radish was buried in the earth <b>from bottom to top,</b> with the wide end at the bottom, <b>it is prohibited.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Adda bar Abba said: They say</b> in <b>the school of Rav: We already learned</b> in the mishna that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman:</b> With regard to <b>straw on top of a bed, one may not move it with his hand, but he may move it with his body. And if it is animal food, or a pillow or sheet is on it, he may move it</b> even <b>with his hand. Conclude from here</b> that <b>moving</b> an item <b>in an atypical manner is not considered moving.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from here</b> that this is indeed the case.

### Part 7
The Gemara cites a somewhat similar case. <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> In the case of <b>these peppers, crushing them one by one with the handle of a knife is permitted.</b> However, crushing <b>two</b> at a time <b>is prohibited,</b> because it appears to be a prohibited labor. <b>Rava said: Since he alters</b> the manner in which he performs this activity, <b>even</b> crushing <b>many</b> at a time <b>is also</b> permitted.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Yehuda</b> also <b>said: One who bathes in water should first dry himself</b> immediately upon exiting, <b>and then ascend</b> to the coast, <b>lest he come to carry</b> the remaining drops of water on his body <b>four cubits in a <i>karmelit</i>.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if there is a concern about carrying water, there should be concern <b>when one descends</b> into the water <b>as well.</b> In that case, <b>his force propels</b> water <b>four cubits</b> into the river, <b>and</b> it should be <b>prohibited.</b> The Gemara answers: With regard to movement that results from <b>his force in a <i>karmelit</i>,</b> the Sages <b>did not</b> issue a <b>decree.</b> Since one does not directly propel the water, but the water moves only as an extension of his motion, and since the river is a <i>karmelit</i>, and the prohibition to carry there is only a rabbinic law, the Sages did not issue a decree for one who descends into the water.

### Part 10
In a similar decree, <b>Abaye said, and some say</b> that it was stated by <b>Rav Yehuda:</b> If one has <b>mud on his foot, he may wipe it on the ground</b> on Shabbat, <b>but he may not wipe it on a wall.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rava said: What is the reason</b> that he may <b>not</b> wipe it off <b>on a wall?</b> Is it <b>because it appears like building,</b> as he is adding plaster to the wall? <b>That is the building of a field laborer,</b> which is not an actual building. There is no concern in that case because in adding plaster to that building, one does not perform the prohibited labor of building.

### Part 12
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> On the contrary, <b>He may wipe it on a wall, but he may not wipe it on the ground.</b> This is due to the concern <b>lest one come to level holes</b> in the ground while wiping his foot.

### Part 13
<b>It is stated</b> that other <i>amora’im</i> disputed this issue. <b>Mar, son of Ravina, said: Both this,</b> wiping the mud on a wall, <b>and that,</b> wiping the mud on the ground, <b>are prohibited. Rav Pappa said: Both this and that are permitted.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Mar, son of Ravina, with what may he wipe</b> his foot? The Gemara answers: Even according to his opinion, there is a permitted manner to clean his foot; <b>he wipes it on a beam</b> on the ground.

### Part 15
<b>Rava said: A person should not sit</b> on Shabbat right <b>at the entrance</b> to a closed alleyway where <b>a side post</b> is placed as a symbolic partition enabling one to carry inside the alleyway. The reason for this is that <b>perhaps an object will roll</b> into the public domain <b>and one will come to get it,</b> as there is no conspicuous demarcation between inside and outside the alleyway.

### Part 16
<b>And Rava</b> also <b>said</b> a similar decree: <b>A person may not position a barrel</b> on a dirt floor, <b>lest he come to level holes</b> in the ground while smoothing the surface upon which he is positioning the barrel.

### Part 17
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>Rava said: A person may not stuff a rag into the mouth of a jug [<i>shisha</i>]</b> on Shabbat, <b>lest he come to</b> violate the prohibition of <b>squeezing</b> liquid from the cloth.

### Part 18
<b>Rav Kahana said:</b> With regard to <b>mortar that is on one’s garment</b> on Shabbat, <b>one may rub it</b> off <b>from the inside, but one may not rub it</b> off <b>from the outside,</b> because that is comparable to the prohibited labor of laundering.

### Part 19
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from that which we learned: With regard to <b>mortar that is on one’s shoe, he may scrape it</b> off <b>with the back of a knife</b> as a departure from the typical manner of scraping. <b>And</b> mortar <b>which is on one’s clothes, he may scrape</b> off <b>with his fingernail, as long as he does not rub it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What, is it not</b> saying <b>that he may not rub</b> it <b>at all?</b> The Gemara rejects that premise: <b>No,</b> it is saying <b>that he may not rub</b> it <b>from the outside, rather from the inside.</b>

### Part 20
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai said: One may scrape</b> mud off of <b>a new shoe</b> on Shabbat, <b>but not</b> off of <b>an old</b> shoe, because a layer of the shoe will be removed, which constitutes the prohibited labor of smoothing.
