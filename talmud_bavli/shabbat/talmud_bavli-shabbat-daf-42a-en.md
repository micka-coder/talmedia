<b>is permitted,</b> since one did not intend to perform that prohibited labor.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>Shmuel,</b> who permits adding water even in an amount sufficient to harden a vessel, <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who says that one may perform an action that inadvertently results in a prohibited labor? <b>Didn’t Shmuel say: One may extinguish a piece of white-hot metal in a public area</b> on Shabbat <b>so that the masses will not be injured?</b> That is because the piece of white-hot metal is not actual fire and extinguishing it is prohibited by rabbinic decree, not Torah law. The Sages did not issue decrees in situations where there is concern for public safety. <b>However,</b> one may <b>not</b> extinguish <b>a</b> red-hot <b>wood coal</b> because extinguishing it is prohibited by Torah law. <b>And if it would enter your mind</b> that Shmuel <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> it should <b>even</b> be permitted to extinguish <b>wood as well.</b> When one extinguishes the coal, he intends neither to perform a prohibited labor nor to derive any benefit. He merely intends to prevent the coal from causing injury. Extinguishing the coal is a labor not necessary for its own sake. Rabbi Shimon says that one who performs a labor not necessary for its own sake is exempt.

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: <b>In</b> the case of <b>an unintentional act,</b> Shmuel <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> In the case of <b>labor not necessary for its own sake, he holds</b> that he is liable, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. Ravina said: Therefore, a thorn in the public domain</b> that is liable to cause injury, <b>one may move it</b> from there in increments, <b>each less than four cubits,</b> on Shabbat. Although the Torah prohibits carrying an object four cubits in the public domain on Shabbat, carrying less than four cubits is prohibited only by rabbinic law. From Shmuel’s statement, it is clear that the Sages did not issue a decree in any case where there is a threat to the masses. <b>And,</b> therefore, if the thorn was <b>in a <i>karmelit</i>,</b> where the prohibition to carry is by rabbinic law, one is permitted to carry it <b>even more</b> than four cubits.

### Part 4
We learned in the mishna: <b>However, one may place</b> water into an urn in order to warm it. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may place hot</b> water <b>into cold</b> water, <b>but not cold into hot;</b> this is <b>the statement of Beit Shammai.</b> In their opinion the cold water becomes heated by the hot water beneath it. <b>And Beit Hillel say: Both hot into cold and cold into hot</b> are <b>permitted.</b> However, Beit Hillel did not permit this in all cases. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this said?</b> It is <b>in</b> the case of <b>a cup. However, in a bath</b> with a lot of water, it is permitted to pour <b>hot into cold but not cold into hot. And Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya prohibits</b> even putting hot into cold. <b>Rav Naḥman said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya</b> in this matter.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yosef thought to say</b> that the legal status of <b>a basin [<i>sefel</i>],</b> which is a vessel used for washing, <b>is like</b> that of <b>a bath,</b> and it is prohibited to pour water into it. <b>Abaye said to him</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A basin is not like a bath</b> in terms of pouring water into it. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to what entered</b> Rav Yosef’s <b>mind initially,</b> that <b>a basin is like a bath</b> with regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>and Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya</b> in this matter, does that mean that <b>on Shabbat there is no</b> possibility of <b>washing with hot</b> water? No all-encompassing prohibition of washing with hot water on Shabbat was ever taught.

### Part 6
The Gemara replies: <b>Do you think</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> ben Menasya <b>is referring to the latter clause of the mishna?</b> No, <b>he is referring to the first clause of the mishna,</b> where we learned that <b>Beit Hillel permit both hot</b> water <b>into cold and cold</b> water <b>into hot, and Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya prohibits</b> placing <b>cold</b> water <b>into hot.</b> The Gemara asks: If so, <b>say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai</b>. Isn’t the <i>halakha</i> generally established according to Beit Hillel? The Gemara explains: <b>He said the following: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not dispute this matter.</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya had a different tradition with regard to the opinions of Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: I saw that Rava was not strict</b> in the case <b>of a vessel</b> and made no distinction between cold and hot. From where did he derive this leniency? <b>From</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>that Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: A person may place a jug of water into a basin of water, both hot into cold and cold into hot. Rav Huna said to Rav Ashi:</b> There is a weakness in this proof, as <b>perhaps there it is different because the vessel forms a partition</b> between the hot and cold water. He is not pouring cold water into the basin itself but is placing a jug whose sides form a partition into the basin. <b>He said to him:</b> The term <b>pour was stated</b> in that <i>baraita</i>. This is the correct version: <b>A person may pour a jug of water into a basin of water, both hot into cold or cold into hot.</b> Therefore, there is no room to distinguish between the two cases.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In continuation of the discussion of vessels where the prohibition of cooking applies even though the vessels are not actually on the fire itself, the mishna establishes: <b>A stew pot [<i>ilpas</i>] and a pot that were removed</b> from the fire while they were still <b>boiling,</b> even if they were removed before Shabbat, <b>one may not place spices into them</b> on Shabbat itself. Even though the pot is not actually standing on the fire, the spices are still cooked in it because the pot is a primary vessel, i.e., a vessel whose contents were cooked on the fire.
