### Part 1
<b>However, one may place</b> the spices <b>into a bowl or into a tureen [<i>tamḥui</i>],</b> which is a large bowl into which people pour the contents a stew pot or a pot. Bowls and tureens are both secondary vessels and food placed into them does not get cooked. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may place</b> spices <b>into anything</b> on Shabbat <b>except for</b> a vessel that has in it <b>something containing vinegar</b> or <b>brine</b> of salted fish.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is <b>Rabbi Yehuda referring to the first clause</b> of the mishna <b>and</b> being <b>lenient?</b> According to that possibility, the mishna prohibits placing spices into any boiling pot and Rabbi Yehuda holds that this only applies if there is fish brine or vinegar inside the pot. <b>Or perhaps he is referring to the latter clause of</b> the mishna <b>and</b> is being <b>stringent?</b> The Rabbis said that one is permitted to place spices into a bowl or a tureen, and Rabbi Yehuda came to add a stringency and say that if the bowl or tureen contains vinegar or brine, it is prohibited to place spices into it.

### Part 3
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from <b>that which was taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Into all stew pots one may place</b> spices on Shabbat; <b>into all pots,</b> even those that are <b>boiling, one may place</b> spices, <b>except for one that contains vinegar</b> or <b>brine.</b> The <i>baraita</i> clearly indicates that Rabbi Yehuda disputes the first clause of the mishna and is being lenient.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yosef thought to say</b> that <b>salt is like a spice</b> whose legal status is: <b>In a primary vessel</b> that was on the fire, salt <b>gets cooked</b> and therefore it is prohibited to place salt into it on Shabbat. <b>And in a secondary vessel,</b> into which the contents of a primary vessel were poured, salt <b>does not get cooked. Abaye said to him:</b> Didn’t <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> already <b>teach</b> that <b>salt is not like a spice?</b> Certainly he meant that <b>in a secondary vessel it also gets cooked. And</b> the Gemara remarks that this conclusion <b>disputes</b> the statement of <b>Rav Naḥman,</b> as <b>Rav Naḥman said: Salt requires cooking</b> for as long <b>as the meat of an ox</b> does, i.e., it requires extensive cooking.

### Part 5
<b>And some say</b> a very different version of this: <b>Rav Yosef thought to say</b> that <b>salt is like a spice,</b> i.e., <b>in a primary vessel it gets cooked,</b> whereas <b>in a secondary vessel it does not get cooked. Abaye said to him:</b> Didn’t <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> already <b>teach</b> that <b>salt is not like a spice,</b> meaning that <b>in a primary vessel, it also does not get cooked? And that is</b> precisely what <b>Rav Naḥman said: Salt requires cooking</b> for as long <b>as the meat of an ox</b> does.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> From a discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of insulation and preparation for Shabbat followed by a brief tangent dealing with the prohibited labor of cooking on Shabbat, the mishna proceeds to briefly discuss prohibitions relating to set-aside [<i>muktze</i>] items in terms of Shabbat lamps. <b>One may not place a vessel beneath the</b> oil <b>lamp,</b> the vessel containing the oil and the wick, on Shabbat in order <b>to receive the oil</b> that drips from the wick. <b>And if one placed</b> the vessel on Friday <b>while it was still day, it is permitted. However,</b> in any case, <b>one may not make use of</b> the oil on Shabbat <b>because it is not from the</b> oil <b>prepared</b> from Shabbat eve for use on Shabbat. The oil in the lamp was already set aside and designated solely for the purpose of lighting the lamp.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Although</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one may not place a vessel beneath a hen</b> preparing to lay an egg on Shabbat on an inclined surface, in order <b>to receive its egg</b> and prevent it from breaking when it falls; <b>however,</b> they permitted <b>overturning a vessel onto</b> an egg on Shabbat <b>so that it will not</b> be trampled and <b>break. Rabba said: What is Rav Ḥisda’s reason? He holds</b> that <b>a hen is likely to lay its egg in a garbage dump</b> and people or animals will oftentimes step on it, <b>but it is not likely to lay its egg on an inclined surface</b> where the egg could roll down and break. <b>And in a common</b> case of <b>preservation,</b> the Sages <b>permitted</b> overturning a vessel onto the egg that is located in the garbage dump to protect it from being broken. <b>And in an uncommon</b> case of <b>preservation,</b> i.e., placing a vessel beneath a hen to receive its egg so that it would not roll down an inclined surface, <b>they did not permit</b> doing so.

### Part 8
<b>Abaye raised an objection</b> to Rabba’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> is it so that <b>in an uncommon</b> case of <b>preservation they did not permit</b> taking steps to protect the object on Shabbat? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One whose <b>barrel of untithed produce [<i>tevel</i>],</b> which may not be eaten until it is tithed, <b>broke on top of his roof</b> on Shabbat, <b>may bring a vessel and place it beneath</b> the barrel so that the untithed produce is not lost. Even though eating untithed produce is prohibited on Shabbat, they permitted carrying a vessel to preserve it even in the uncommon case of a barrel that breaks. Apparently, even in an uncommon case of preservation the Sages permit taking the necessary steps. Rabba answered: This too, is a common case of preservation because it is an instance of <b>new barrels [<i>gulfei</i>], which commonly break.</b>

### Part 9
Abaye <b>raised</b> another <b>objection</b> to Rabba’s opinion from the last mishna in this chapter: <b>One may place a vessel beneath the</b> oil <b>lamp</b> in order <b>to receive</b> burning <b>sparks</b> of oil that drip from the burning wick even though this is not common. Rabba answered: <b>Sparks are also common</b> and therefore, it is a common case of preservation.
