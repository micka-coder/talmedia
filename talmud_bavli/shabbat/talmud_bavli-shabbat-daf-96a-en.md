### Part 1
<b>This</b> statement, that a hole must be large enough to enable a pomegranate to go out in order to purify the vessel, is referring to <b>large</b> vessels. <b>And this</b> statement, that teaches that a vessel is purified only when the majority of the vessel is broken, is referring <b>to small</b> vessels. <b>Rav Asi said</b> that <b>they teach</b> this <i>halakha</i>: With regard to <b>an earthenware vessel,</b> the <b>measure</b> of the hole that renders it unable to become ritually impure is large enough <b>to enable liquid to enter it. And they only said:</b> The measure of a small hole from which <b>liquid seeps,</b> with regard to the <b>impurity</b> of <b>a shard [<i>gistera</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers that <b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, said:</b> A shard is used as a plate beneath a perforated earthenware vessel. If the shard is also perforated and leaks, it is no longer of any use. <b>Because one does not say: Bring</b> another <b>shard to</b> seal the leak of a <b>shard,</b> but throws it out immediately.

### Part 2
<b>Ulla said: Two <i>amora’im</i> in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>disagree</b> about <b>this</b> topic: They are <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Avin, and Rabbi Yosei bar Zavda. One said:</b> The measure of a hole that purifies an earthenware vessel is large enough <b>to enable a pomegranate to go out. And one said:</b> The size of <b>a small root. And your mnemonic</b> to remember that neither holds that the measure is size of an olive is the expression: <b>Both one who increases and one who decreases.</b> They hold extreme positions in this dispute and eschew the intermediate position. <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Kahana said</b> an intermediate position <b>in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: An earthenware vessel</b> becomes ritually pure with a hole <b>large enough to enable olives to go out. And Mar Kashisha, son of Rabba, concluded</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: And</b> vessels that have been perforated <b>are like dung vessels, and</b> so too, <b>stone vessels and earth vessels</b> that were not baked in a kiln, <b>which neither become impure by Torah law nor by rabbinic law. And,</b> as far as <b>the matter of</b> an earthenware vessel with <b>a sealed cover</b> in a room with a corpse, it maintains its impurity <b>until the majority of it is broken.</b>
