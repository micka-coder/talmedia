### Part 1
With regard to <b>swollen meat</b> that began to putrefy, it is permitted to move it <b>because it is food for non-domesticated animals.</b> With regard to <b>exposed water,</b> from which a snake might have drunk and into which it injected its venom, it is permitted to move it <b>because it is suitable for a cat,</b> which is somewhat immune to snake venom. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> Exposed water <b>itself may not be kept due to the danger</b> that one may inadvertently drink it.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may overturn a basket in front of the chicks</b> so that <b>they can climb on and climb off</b> of it. Likewise, with regard to <b>a hen that fled</b> that one seeks to retrieve, <b>one may push it</b> even with his hands <b>until it reenters</b> the house.

### Part 3
<b>One may help calves and foals to walk,</b> and likewise <b>a woman may help her son to walk. Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> is it permitted? <b>When</b> her son <b>picks one</b> foot <b>up and puts one</b> foot <b>down</b> by himself. <b>However, if</b> her son <b>were dragging</b> both his feet, <b>it would be prohibited</b> because it would be like carrying him in the public domain.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>an animal that fell into an aqueduct, one brings cushions and blankets,</b> and throws them into the water ditch, <b>and places them beneath</b> the animal in the aqueduct. <b>And if</b> the animal thereby <b>emerges, it emerges.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>Tosefta</i>: With regard to <b>an animal that fell into an aqueduct</b> on Shabbat, <b>one provides it with sustenance in its place so that it will not die.</b> This implies that providing it with <b>sustenance, yes,</b> that is permitted, providing it with <b>cushions and blankets, no,</b> that it is prohibited.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as there is room to distinguish between the cases. <b>This,</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> in which it was taught that one provides the animal with sustenance, is referring to a case where <b>it is possible to provide</b> it with <b>sustenance. That,</b> the mishna in which Rav said that one brings cushions and blankets, is referring to a case where <b>it is impossible to provide</b> it with <b>sustenance.</b> Where <b>it is possible to provide</b> it with <b>sustenance, yes,</b> he does so. <b>And if</b> it is <b>not</b> possible to provide it with sustenance, <b>he brings cushions and blankets and places them beneath</b> the animal.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Does he not,</b> by placing the cushions and blankets, <b>negate a vessel’s preparedness?</b> The cushions and blankets are no longer fit for their designated use on Shabbat, and this negation of their designated use is similar to the prohibited labor of dismantling. The Gemara answers: Rav <b>holds</b> that <b>negating a vessel’s preparedness</b> is prohibited <b>by rabbinic law. Causing a living creature to suffer</b> is <b>a Torah</b> prohibition. <b>And</b> a matter prohibited by <b>Torah law comes and overrides</b> a matter prohibited <b>by rabbinic law.</b>

### Part 8
We learned in the mishna: With regard to <b>a hen that fled</b> that one seeks to retrieve, he may push it back to its place. By inference: <b>Push</b> the hen, <b>yes,</b> it is permitted, <b>help</b> it <b>to walk, no,</b> it is prohibited. The Gemara comments: <b>We</b> already <b>learned this, as the Sages taught: One may help domesticated animals, non-domesticated animals, and fowl walk in the courtyard</b> on Shabbat, <b>but not hens.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>a hen, what</b> is the <b>reason</b> that one may <b>not</b> help it walk? <b>Abaye says:</b> It is prohibited <b>because</b> the hen <b>lifts itself</b> off the ground. As a result, one actually carries it.

### Part 10
<b>It was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may help domesticated animals, non-domesticated animals, and fowl walk in the courtyard, but not in the public domain. And a woman may help her son walk in the public domain, and, needless to say,</b> it is permitted <b>in the courtyard. And it was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not lift domesticated animals, non-domesticated animals, and fowl</b> off the ground <b>in the courtyard, but one may push them so that they will enter.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara first seeks to clarify the second <i>baraita</i>. <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself is difficult.</b> On the one hand, <b>you said</b> that <b>one may not lift,</b> from which it may be inferred, <b>however,</b> that <b>one may help it walk. Then you said: Push, yes,</b> it is permitted, <b>help walk, no,</b> it is prohibited. <b>Abaye said: The latter clause,</b> which states that one may not help it walk, <b>we came to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a <b>hen,</b> which, as mentioned above, one may not help it walk.

### Part 12
Having mentioned moving the hen, the Gemara cites that which <b>Abaye said: One who slaughters a hen should force its legs into the ground, or alternatively lift it</b> entirely into the air. Failure to do so leads to the concern <b>lest</b> the hen <b>place its claws into the ground</b> and convulse during the slaughter <b>and dislocate the signs,</b> the trachea and gullet. This would invalidate the slaughter and render the hen an unslaughtered animal carcass.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not birth an animal on a Festival,</b> and all the more one may not birth it on Shabbat. <b>However, one may assist it</b> to give birth. <b>And one may birth a woman</b> even <b>on Shabbat, and call a midwife for her</b> to travel <b>from place to place,</b> even when the midwife’s travel involves the desecration of Shabbat. <b>And one may desecrate Shabbat for</b> a woman giving birth. <b>And one may tie the umbilical cord</b> of a child born on Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: One may even cut</b> the umbilical cord. <b>And all the requirements of circumcision may be performed</b> for a baby whose eighth day of life occurs <b>on Shabbat.</b>

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>How may one assist</b> in the birth of an animal? <b>Rav Yehuda said: One holds the newborn so that it will not fall to the ground. Rav Naḥman says: One presses the flesh</b> around the womb <b>so that the newborn will emerge.</b>

### Part 15
<b>It was taught in</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda: How may one assist</b> in the birth of an animal? <b>One holds the newborn so that it will not fall to the ground, and he blows into its nostrils</b> to remove mucus obstructing the air passages, enabling the offspring to breathe, <b>and he places</b> the mother’s <b>teat into its mouth so that it will suckle.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: We would have mercy on kosher animals on a Festival,</b> to help the offspring. The Gemara asks: <b>How does</b> one have mercy? <b>Abaye said:</b> If the mother does not draw her offspring near and tend to it, <b>one may bring a lump of salt and place</b> it <b>in the</b> animal’s <b>womb, so that</b> it will suffer, <b>remember its suffering</b> while giving birth, <b>and have mercy on</b> the offspring. And <b>one may pour fluids of the afterbirth on</b> the offspring <b>so that</b> the mother <b>will smell it and have mercy on it,</b> her offspring. <b>And</b> this may be done <b>specifically</b> for a <b>kosher</b> animal, <b>but</b> for a <b>non-kosher</b> animal, <b>no,</b> it may not be done.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> one may not do so for <b>a non-kosher</b> animal? The Gemara answers: <b>A non-kosher</b> animal <b>does not distance its offspring, and if it does distance its offspring, it will not draw</b> it <b>near</b> again. No purpose is served by taking these steps with a non-kosher animal.

### Part 18
We learned in the mishna: <b>And one may birth a woman</b> even when that involves the desecration of Shabbat The Gemara asks: <b>After all, it was taught</b> explicitly in the mishna: <b>And one may birth a woman</b> even <b>on Shabbat, and call a midwife for her</b> to travel <b>from place to place.</b> The phrase: <b>And one may desecrate Shabbat for</b> a woman giving birth, <b>what</b> does it come <b>to include?</b> All the possible acts of desecrating Shabbat for the birthing woman were already listed.

### Part 19
The Gemara answers: It comes <b>to include that which the Sages taught</b> with regard to this issue: <b>If</b> a woman giving birth <b>were</b> to <b>need a lamp, her friend lights the lamp for her</b> on Shabbat. <b>And if she were to need oil, her friend brings her oil</b> via the public domain in an atypical manner, carrying it <b>in</b> the palm of her <b>hand</b> but not in a vessel. <b>And if</b> the oil that her friend brings <b>in</b> her <b>hand is not enough, she brings</b> oil <b>in her hair. And if</b> oil that she brings <b>in</b> her <b>hair is not enough, she brings</b> oil <b>for her</b> in the typical manner, <b>in a vessel.</b>

### Part 20
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> a woman giving birth <b>were to need a lamp, her friend</b> would <b>light the lamp for her</b> on Shabbat. The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>only in the case of a blind</b> woman giving birth. <b>Lest you say: Since she cannot see</b> even with the light <b>it is prohibited</b> to bring a lamp for her, <b>it teaches us</b> that lighting the lamp is permitted to <b>settle her mind.</b> The blind woman <b>thinks: If there is something</b> that needs to be done in the course of childbirth, the lamp will enable my <b>friend to see and she will do</b> it <b>for me.</b>

### Part 21
We learned in the mishna: <b>And if she needed oil,</b> her friend brings her oil in her hair. The Gemara asks: What good is this advice? <b>Derive</b> that <b>it</b> is prohibited <b>due to</b> the prohibited labor of <b>wringing.</b> The friend will need to wring her hair in order to extract the oil for the birthing woman.

### Part 22
It was <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef who both said: There is no</b> prohibition of <b>wringing with regard to hair,</b> since hair does not absorb liquids like other materials. <b>Rav Ashi said: Even if you say</b> that <b>there is</b> a prohibition of <b>wringing with regard to hair,</b> here the friend does not actually bring the oil in her hair. Rather, <b>she brings it in a vessel</b> tied <b>through her hair.</b> She does this because <b>as much</b> as <b>it is possible to change</b> the manner in which one performs a labor that is being done to save a life, <b>we change it.</b>

### Part 23
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>a woman in childbirth, as long as the womb is open, whether she said: I need</b> Shabbat to be desecrated, or <b>whether she did not say: I need</b> Shabbat to be desecrated, <b>one desecrates Shabbat for her.</b> Generally, a woman in childbirth is in danger, and prohibited labors may be performed in life-threatening circumstances.

### Part 24
Once <b>the womb closed</b> after birth, <b>whether</b> the woman who gave birth <b>said:</b>
