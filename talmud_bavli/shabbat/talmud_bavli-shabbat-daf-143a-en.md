### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>There, since</b> the intestines <b>will putrefy</b> as time passes, they are <b>on his mind from yesterday.</b> Since Shabbat eve, he has had in mind to feed them to the cat.

### Part 2
The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to say <b>that Rava holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as Rava taught: A woman may not enter the wood storehouse to take a</b> wooden <b>poker</b> to stoke a fire on a Festival. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>a poker that broke, it is prohibited to kindle</b> a fire with <b>it on a Festival, as one may kindle</b> a fire on a Festival <b>with vessels</b> that may be moved, <b>but one may not kindle</b> a fire <b>with broken vessels</b> that broke during the Festival. They are set-aside and prohibited. <b>Conclude from it</b> that Rava ruled in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of set-aside.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: One</b> may <b>clear bones and shells</b> left from the Shabbat meal <b>from the table</b> with his hand. <b>And Beit Hillel say: One</b> may <b>remove the entire board [<i>tavla</i>]</b> that is the table surface <b>and shake</b> the bones and shells off of <b>it,</b> but he may not lift them with his hand because they are set-aside and may not be moved.

### Part 4
<b>One</b> may <b>clear</b> bread <b>crumbs from the table,</b> even if they are <b>less than an olive-bulk, and pea and lentil pods.</b> Even though it is not fit for human consumption, it may be moved <b>because it is animal fodder.</b>

### Part 5
With regard to <b>a sponge, if it has leather</b> as <b>a handle, one may wipe</b> the table <b>with it, and if not, one may not wipe</b> the table <b>with it</b> lest he come to squeeze liquid from it. <b>And the Rabbis say: Both this,</b> a dry sponge with a handle, <b>and that,</b> one without a handle, <b>may be moved on Shabbat and it does not become ritually impure.</b> A sponge is not among the substances that can become ritually impure, neither by Torah law nor by rabbinic decree.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> Reverse the two opinions, as <b>we have only Beit Shammai in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who prohibits moving set-aside items, <b>and Beit Hillel in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who permits doing so.

### Part 7
We learned in the mishna: <b>One</b> may <b>clear</b> bread <b>crumbs from the table.</b> The Gemara comments: This <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>crumbs that are less than an olive-bulk, it is prohibited to destroy them by hand</b> in deference to the food.

### Part 8
We learned in the mishna: One may clear <b>pea</b> and lentil <b>pods</b> from the table on Shabbat. The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion <b>is it</b> in the mishna? It is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who is not</b> of the opinion that there is a prohibition of <b>set-aside.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: With regard to <b>a sponge, if it has leather</b> as <b>a handle, one may wipe</b> the table <b>with it, and if not, one may not wipe</b> the table <b>with it. We have arrived at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who <b>said: An unintentional act is prohibited,</b> as he certainly does not intend to squeeze liquid from the sponge.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>In that</b> case, <b>even Rabbi Shimon agrees</b> that it is prohibited, <b>as it is Abaye and Rava who both say: Rabbi Shimon agrees in</b> a case of: <b>Cut off its head will it not die,</b> i.e., inevitable consequences. When the prohibited outcome that ensues from the unintentional action is inevitable, Rabbi Shimon agrees that it is prohibited. Squeezing liquid from a sponge is an inevitable consequence.

### Part 11
With regard to <b>those pits of Aramean dates,</b> which are low quality and occasionally fed to animals, <b>it is permitted to move</b> the pits <b>since</b> they <b>are fit</b> for use <b>due to their origin,</b> i.e., the dates that were prepared as animal feed beforehand. <b>And</b> moving pits <b>of Persian</b> dates <b>is prohibited.</b> Since those dates are high quality and are not prepared for animals, their pits, too, are not prepared for that use.

### Part 12
The Gemara relates that <b>Shmuel</b> would <b>carry them along with bread.</b> The letters <b><i>shin</i>, <i>resh</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>peh</i>, <i>zayin</i></b> are <b>a mnemonic</b> of the Sages whose opinions are cited below: Shmuel, Rabba, Huna, Ameimar, Sheshet, Pappa, Zekharya. The Gemara comments: <b>Shmuel’s</b> statement is consistent <b>with his reasoning, as Shmuel said: A man may perform all his needs with bread.</b> As long as the bread remains edible, he need not be concerned that he is treating the bread contemptuously.

### Part 13
<b>Rabba would move them along with a pitcher of water. Rav Huna, son</b> of <b>Rav Yehoshua, would render them a chamber pot with excrement.</b> The Sages permitted moving repulsive vessels. Here, too, he would collect all the date pits and then move them out because they were disgusting. <b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: And may one create a chamber pot with excrement <i>ab initio</i>?</b> Although the Sages permitted moving a container of excrement, they did not permit creating one <i>ab initio</i> so that it would be permitted to move it.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Sheshet would dispose of</b> the pits <b>with his tongue. Rav Pappa would dispose of them behind the divan</b> on which he sat while eating because he did not want to move them in another manner. <b>They said about Rabbi Zekharya ben Avkolas that he would turn his face</b> toward the <b>back of the divan and dispose of them.</b>
