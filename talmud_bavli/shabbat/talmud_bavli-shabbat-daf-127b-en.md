### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>These too,</b> hospitality toward guests and visiting the sick, <b>are in the category of acts of loving-kindness. A different version</b> of that answer: <b>These</b> matters on the longer list <b>are attributable to those,</b> the matters on the shorter list.

### Part 2
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who judges another favorably is himself judged favorably. And there was an incident</b> involving <b>a certain person who descended from the Upper Galilee and was hired</b> to work <b>for a certain homeowner in the South</b> for <b>three years. On the eve of the Day of Atonement, he said to</b> the homeowner: <b>Give me my wages, and I will go and feed my wife and children.</b> The homeowner <b>said to him: I have no money. He said to him:</b> In that case, <b>give me</b> my wages in the form of <b>produce. He said to him: I have none.</b> The worker said to him: <b>Give me</b> my wages in the form of <b>land.</b> The homeowner said to him: <b>I have none.</b> The worker said to him: <b>Give me</b> my wages in the form of <b>animals. He said to him: I have none.</b> The worker said to him: <b>Give me cushions and blankets.</b> He said to him: <b>I have none.</b> The worker <b>slung his tools</b> over his shoulder <b>behind him and went to his home in anguish.</b>

### Part 3
<b>After the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>the homeowner took</b> the worker’s <b>wages in his hand, along with a burden</b> that required <b>three donkeys, one</b> laden <b>with food, one</b> laden <b>with drink, and one</b> laden <b>with types of sweets, and went to the</b> worker’s <b>home. After they ate and drank,</b> the homeowner <b>gave him his wages.</b>

### Part 4
The homeowner <b>said to him: When you said to me: Give me my wages, and I said: I have no money, of what did you suspect me?</b> Why did you not suspect me of trying to avoid paying you? The worker answered, <b>I said: Perhaps the opportunity to purchase merchandise [<i>perakmatya</i>] inexpensively presented itself, and you purchased</b> it <b>with</b> the money that you owed me, and therefore you had no money available. The homeowner asked: <b>And when you said to me: Give me animals, and I said: I have no animals, of what did you suspect me?</b> The worker answered: <b>I said: Perhaps</b> the animals <b>are hired to others.</b> The homeowner asked: <b>When you said to me: Give me land, and I said: I have no land, of what did you suspect me?</b> The worker answered: <b>I said: Perhaps</b> the land <b>is leased to others,</b> and you cannot take the land from the lessees. The homeowner asked: <b>And when</b> you said to me: Give me produce, and <b>I said: I have no produce, of what did you suspect me?</b> The worker answered: <b>I said: Perhaps they are not tithed,</b> and that was why you could not give them to me. The homeowner asked: <b>And when I said: I have no cushions or blankets, of what did you suspect me?</b> The worker answered: <b>I said: Perhaps he consecrated all his property to Heaven</b> and therefore has nothing available at present.

### Part 5
The homeowner <b>said to him:</b> I swear by <b>the</b> Temple <b>service</b> that <b>it was so.</b> I had no money available at the time because I <b>vowed</b> and consecrated <b>all my property on account of Hyrcanus, my son, who did not engage in Torah</b> study. The homeowner sought to avoid leaving an inheritance for his son. <b>And when I came to my colleagues in the South,</b> the Sages of that generation, <b>they dissolved all my vows.</b> At that point, the homeowner had immediately gone to pay his worker. Now the homeowner said: <b>And you, just as you judged favorably,</b> so <b>may God judge you favorably.</b>

### Part 6
On a similar note, the Gemara relates that <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving a certain pious man who redeemed a young Jewish woman</b> from captivity. When they arrived <b>at the inn he had her lie beneath his feet. The next day, he descended, and immersed</b> in a ritual bath to purify himself before Torah study and prayer, <b>and taught his students.</b> This conduct could arouse suspicion that the pious man kept the maiden for himself, as immersion in the morning is customary for men who have experienced a seminal emission by engaging in sexual relations.

### Part 7
<b>And</b> the pious man <b>said to</b> his students: <b>When I had her lie beneath my feet, of what did you suspect me?</b> They said to him: <b>We said: Perhaps there is a student among us whose</b> conduct <b>is not established</b> before <b>the rabbi,</b> and he wanted to make certain that this student would not inappropriately accost the young woman. Therefore, the rabbi kept the woman close by.

### Part 8
He said to them: <b>When I descended and immersed, of what did you suspect me?</b> They answered: <b>Perhaps due to the exertion of travel, a</b> seminal <b>emission befell the rabbi. He said to them:</b> I swear <b>by the</b> Temple <b>service</b> that <b>it was so. And you, just as you judged</b> me <b>favorably,</b> so <b>may God judge you favorably.</b>

### Part 9
<b>The Sages taught</b> a similar <i>baraita</i>: <b>Once</b> there was <b>a certain matter needed by Torah scholars.</b> They wanted to discuss an issue <b>with a certain matron whose</b> company was kept <b>by all the prominent</b> people <b>of Rome.</b> The Torah scholars wanted to address the government on behalf of the Jewish people, and they sought the matron’s advice. <b>They said: Who will go? Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: I shall go.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua and his students went</b> to her. <b>When he arrived</b> with his students <b>at the entrance of her house, he removed his phylacteries at a distance of four cubits</b> from the door, <b>and entered, and locked the door before them. After he emerged, he descended and immersed</b> in a ritual bath, <b>and taught his students.</b> Here too, this was conduct that could arouse suspicion that something improper transpired.

### Part 11
<b>And he said to</b> his students: <b>When I removed the phylacteries, of what did you suspect me?</b> They said to him, <b>we said: The rabbi must hold</b> that <b>sacred items may not enter a place of impurity.</b> Therefore, it would have been inappropriate to enter the house with phylacteries.

### Part 12
He asked: <b>When I locked</b> the door, <b>of what did you suspect me?</b> They said to him: <b>We said: Perhaps there is a</b> discreet <b>royal matter</b> that must be discussed <b>between him and her</b> and should not be revealed.

### Part 13
Rabbi Yehoshua asked: <b>When I descended and immersed, of what did you suspect me?</b> They said to him, <b>we said: Perhaps a bit of spittle sprayed from her mouth onto the rabbi’s clothes.</b> The Sages decreed that the legal status of a gentile is like that of a <i>zav</i>; their bodily fluids transmit ritual impurity. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them:</b> I swear <b>by the</b> Temple <b>service</b> that <b>it was so. And you, just as you judged favorably,</b> so <b>may God judge you favorably.</b>

### Part 14
We learned in the mishna: <b>One</b> may <b>move ritually pure <i>teruma</i></b> on Shabbat. The Gemara objects: That is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is necessary</b> to teach this <b>only</b> in a case <b>in which it is placed in Israelite hands. Lest you say: Since it is not suitable for</b> the Israelite to eat, he is <b>prohibited</b> to move it on Shabbat; therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> that <b>since it is suitable for</b> a <b>priest</b> to eat, one may <b>well</b> move it on Shabbat.

### Part 15
<b>And</b> we also learned in the mishna: One may move <b>doubtfully tithed produce.</b> The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>doubtfully tithed produce,</b> why may one move it? <b>It is not suitable for him</b> to eat. The Gemara answers: <b>Since if he</b> so <b>desires,</b> he may <b>renounce</b> all <b>his property,</b> declaring it ownerless, <b>and he</b> would then <b>be poor, and</b> the doubtfully tithed produce would be <b>suitable for him, now too it is suitable for him.</b> A pauper may eat doubtfully tithed produce, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One</b> may <b>feed the poor doubtfully tithed produce and soldiers [<i>akhsanya</i>] doubtfully tithed produce. And Rav Huna said</b> that <b>it was taught: Beit Shammai say: One</b> may <b>neither feed the poor doubtfully tithed produce nor</b> feed <b>soldiers doubtfully tithed produce. And Beit Hillel say: One</b> may <b>feed the poor doubtfully tithed produce and</b> feed <b>soldiers doubtfully tithed produce.</b> The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel.

### Part 16
We learned in the mishna: And one may move <b>first tithe whose</b> teruma of the tithe <b>has</b> already <b>been taken.</b> The Gemara poses a question: <b>It is obvious</b> that if the <i>teruma</i> was already tithed it is non-sacred produce in every sense. The Gemara explains: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach this <b><i>halakha</i> only in</b> the following case: A Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest while the grain was still <b>on the stalks and brought it to the threshing floor, and before the grain was threshed, the <i>teruma</i> of the tithes was taken and the <i>teruma gedola</i> was not taken.</b>

### Part 17
<b>And</b> the above mentioned <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abbahu, as Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> With regard to <b>first tithe, in a case in which</b> the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest while the grain was still <b>on the stalks, one is exempt from separating <i>teruma gedola from it</i>, as it is stated: “And you shall set apart from it a gift for the Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe”</b> (Numbers 18:26). By inference: <b>A tenth part of the tithe,</b> i.e., the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, <b>I,</b> God, <b>said to you</b> that you must take, <b>and not both <i>teruma gedola</i> and the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: If so, even if</b> the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest after the kernels of grain were removed from the stalks and placed <b>in a pile,</b> the Levite should <b>also be exempt</b> from taking <i>teruma gedola.</i> Abaye <b>said to him: With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states: “From all that is given to you, you shall set apart</b> that which is the Lord’s <b><i>teruma</i>”</b> (Numbers 18:29). God’s <i>teruma,</i> i.e., <i>teruma gedola,</i> must be taken from all the Levites’ gifts.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>What did you see</b> that led you to require <i>teruma gedola</i> from first tithe that was taken from grain in piles, and not from first tithe that was taken from grain on stalks? Abaye answers: <b>This,</b> stalks that were threshed and placed into piles, are completely processed and <b>have become grain, and that,</b> grains that have remained on the stalk, <b>have not</b> yet <b>become grain.</b> The verse states the following with regard to <i>teruma gedola</i>: “The first of your grain” (Deuteronomy 18:4) is given to the priest. Once it is considered grain, the rights of the priest take effect and the Levite is required to separate <i>teruma gedola.</i>

### Part 20
We learned in the mishna: One may move second tithe that was redeemed. The Gemara asks: This is obvious. The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>only in</b> a case where the consecrated property was not completely redeemed, i.e., <b>where one gave</b> payment for <b>the principal,</b> the value of the tithe, <b>but he did not give</b> payment for <b>the fifth</b> that he must add when redeeming items that he consecrated. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that failure to add <b>the fifth does not invalidate</b> the redemption, and the second tithe assumes non-sacred status from the moment that one pays the principal.

### Part 21
<b>And</b> we learned in the mishna: One may move even <b>dry lupine,</b> which is not fit for consumption by a person, because it is goat food. The Gemara comments: This applies <b>only</b> when lupine is <b>dry. However,</b> when it is <b>moist, no</b> it is prohibited to move it. <b>What is the reason</b> for this prohibition? <b>Since</b> lupine <b>is</b> extremely <b>bitter</b> when wet, an animal <b>will not eat</b> it.
