### Part 1
After some discussion of the ways of the Amorite, the Gemara cites additional statements from the Amorite chapter in the <i>Tosefta</i> and from other sources on this topic. <b>One who says: My fortune be fortunate [<i>gad gaddi</i>] and be not weary by day or by night;</b> that statement <b>contains an element of the ways of the Amorite. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> That is more severe than the ways of the Amorite, as <b><i>gad</i> is nothing other than a term of idolatry, as it is stated:</b> “And you that forsake the Lord, that forget My holy mountain, <b>that prepare a table for <i>Gad</i>,</b> and that offer mingled wine in full measure unto <i>Meni</i>” (Isaiah 65:11). <i>Gad gaddi</i> is a form of prayer to an idol.

### Part 2
One who requests that <b>he</b> be called <b>by</b> his wife’s <b>name and she</b> be called <b>by his name</b> for good fortune, his request <b>contains an element of the ways of the Amorite.</b>

### Part 3
One who says: <b>Let my barrels be strengthened [<i>donu danei</i>],</b> that <b>contains an element of the ways of the Amorite. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> That is more severe than the ways of the Amorite, as <b><i>Dan</i> is nothing other than a term of idol worship, as it is stated: “They that swear by the sin of Samaria and say: As your god <i>Dan</i> lives”</b> (Amos 8:14).

### Part 4
<b>One who</b> hears a raven calling and is concerned about a bad omen and <b>says to the raven: Scream, and</b> says <b>to the female raven: Whistle and turn your tail to me for the best;</b> those statements <b>contain an element of the ways of the Amorite.</b>

### Part 5
<b>One who says: Slaughter this rooster that calls out</b> in the <b>evening and</b> says: Slaughter this <b>chicken that calls out like a male</b> rooster; those statements <b>contain an element of the ways of the Amorite.</b>

### Part 6
One who says: <b>I will drink and leave over, I will drink and leave over,</b> so that his wine will increase; that statement <b>contains an element of the ways of the Amorite.</b>

### Part 7
<b>One who cracks eggs on a wall and smears</b> them <b>in front of the chicks;</b> that series of actions <b>contains an element of the ways of the Amorite.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And one who stirs</b> the pot <b>in front of chicks</b> as an auspicious practice so they do not die; that action <b>contains an element of the ways of the Amorite.</b>

### Part 9
<b>A woman who dances and counts</b> the chicks until she reaches the number of <b>seventy-one chicks, so they won’t die;</b> her action <b>contains an element of the ways of the Amorite.</b>

### Part 10
A woman <b>who dances to</b> ensure that the <b><i>kutaḥ</i>,</b> a spice made from whey salt and bread, that she is preparing will be successful, <b>and</b> a woman <b>who silences</b> bystanders <b>to</b> ensure that the <b>lentils</b> will cook properly, <b>and</b> a woman <b>who screams to</b> ensure that the <b>pearl barley</b> will cook properly; all these <b>contain an element of the ways of the Amorite.</b>

### Part 11
<b>A woman who urinates in front of her pot so it will cook quickly;</b> that action <b>contains an element of the ways of the Amorite.</b>

### Part 12
<b>But one may put a chip of mulberry</b> wood <b>and shards of glass in the pot so it will cook quickly,</b> as doing so is effective and not merely superstition. <b>And the Rabbis prohibit shards of glass</b> not due to superstition; rather, <b>due to</b> the <b>danger</b> involved if the glass is not strained out completely.

### Part 13
<b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One</b> may <b>place a lump of salt into a candle so it will burn brightly;</b> that is effective and not merely for good fortune, so there is no element of the ways of the Amorites involved. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>one may put mud or clay under a candle so it will burn longer.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rav Zutra said: He who covers an oil lamp or who uncovers a kerosene</b> lamp for no purpose <b>violates the prohibition: Do not destroy,</b> since by doing so the fuel burns more quickly.

### Part 15
One who says while drinking: <b>Wine and life to the mouth of the Sages,</b> this does <b>not fall into the category of the ways of the Amorite. There was an incident with Rabbi Akiva who made a banquet for his son, and over each and every cup he brought he said: Wine and life to the mouth of the Sages, wine and life to the mouth of the Sages and to the mouth of their students.</b>

### Part 17
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The Sages <b>stated a significant principle with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat: One who forgets the essence of Shabbat,</b> i.e., one who is entirely ignorant of the mitzva of Shabbat according to Torah law, <b>and performed numerous prohibited labors on multiple <i>Shabbatot</i>, is liable</b> to bring <b>only one sin-offering</b> for all those labors when he becomes aware that those actions were prohibited. <b>One who knows the essence of Shabbat</b> but forgets which day is Shabbat, i.e., one who lost track of the days of the week, <b>and performs numerous prohibited labors on multiple <i>Shabbatot</i> is liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for each Shabbat</b> when he becomes aware that he performed those actions on Shabbat. <b>One who is aware that</b> the day <b>is Shabbat</b> but temporarily forgot that certain labors were prohibited <b>and performed numerous prohibited labors on multiple <i>Shabbatot</i> is liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for each</b>
