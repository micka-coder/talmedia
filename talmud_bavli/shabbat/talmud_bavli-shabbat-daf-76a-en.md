<b>Rabbi Elazar said: This</b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar stated a principle: Anything that is not fit to be stored and</b> people do <b>not</b> typically <b>store</b> items <b>like it, but it was deemed fit</b> to be stored <b>by this</b> person <b>and he stored it, and another</b> person <b>came and carried out</b> the object that was stored, <b>that</b> person who carried it out <b>is rendered liable by the thought of this</b> person who stored it. Once one person deemed it significant by means of thought and action, it is considered significant for all people. According to our mishna, however, only the person who stored the object is liable for carrying it out.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna lists the measures in which various substances are significant and generally stored. <b>One who carries out straw</b> in a measure <b>equivalent to a cow’s mouthful</b> is liable. The measure that determines liability for <b><i>etza</i></b> is <b>equivalent to a camel’s mouthful.</b> Because it is a coarser food, he must carry out a greater amount in order to be liable. The measure that determines liability for <b>ears of grain</b> is <b>equivalent to a lamb’s mouthful.</b> The measure that determines liability for <b>grass</b> is <b>equivalent to a goat’s mouthful,</b> which is smaller than that of a lamb. The measure that determines liability for <b>garlic leaves and onion leaves,</b> if they are <b>moist</b> and fit for human consumption, is <b>equivalent to a dried fig-bulk.</b> A dried fig-bulk is the standard measure for human food. If the garlic leaves and onion leaves are <b>dry,</b> the measure for liability is <b>equivalent to a goat’s mouthful. And none</b> of these substances <b>join</b> together <b>with one another</b> to constitute a measure for liability <b>because they are not equal in their measures.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara first asks: <b>What is <i>etza</i></b> mentioned in the mishna? <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> It is <b>straw of types of legumes. When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said:</b> In the case of <b>one who carries out</b> a measure of <b>straw equivalent to a cow’s mouthful for a camel,</b> for which it is an insignificant measure, is his liability determined based on the measure that he carried out or based on the objective for which he carried it out? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> He is <b>liable. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> He is <b>exempt. In the evening, Rabbi Yoḥanan said that;</b> however, <b>in the morning, he reversed</b> his opinion and agreed with Reish Lakish. <b>Rav Yosef said: He did well to reverse</b> his opinion, <b>since</b> that amount <b>is not suitable for a camel.</b> There is no liability for carrying out less than a camel’s mouthful for a camel. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>On the contrary,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s <b>original</b> statement that he is liable <b>is reasonable, as it is suitable for a cow.</b> He carried out a significant measure that is fit for use, and he is liable for carrying it out even though it is insignificant for a camel.

### Part 4
<b>Rather, when Ravin</b> later <b>came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he</b> transmitted a revised version of the dispute and <b>said:</b> With regard to <b>one who carries out</b> a measure <b>equivalent to a cow’s mouthful of straw for a camel, everyone agrees that he is liable. Where they disagree</b> is <b>in</b> a case of one who <b>carries</b> out a measure of <b><i>etza</i>,</b> which cows do not typically eat, <b>equivalent to a cow’s mouthful for</b> the purpose of feeding <b>a cow.</b> Here the question is more difficult. Clearly, if one were to carry out that measure for a camel, or for no particular purpose, he would be exempt. However, since he designated the food for a cow, for which it is a significant amount, perhaps he should be liable for carrying out.

### Part 5
<b>And the opposite was stated</b> in the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> He is <b>exempt. Reish Lakish said:</b> He is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> He is <b>exempt</b> because he holds that <b>eating under duress,</b> i.e., food that is not typically eaten but could be eaten if necessary, such as a cow eating <i>etza</i>, <b>is not considered eating. Reish Lakish said:</b> He <b>is liable</b> because he holds that <b>eating under duress is considered eating.</b>

### Part 6
We learned in the mishna: The measure that determines liability for <b>an ear of grain</b> is <b>equivalent to a lamb’s mouthful.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Its measure for liability is <b>equivalent to a dried fig-bulk?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>This,</b> a lamb’s mouthful, <b>and that,</b> a dried fig-bulk, <b>are one,</b> the same, <b>measure.</b>

### Part 7
We learned in the mishna: The measure that determines liability for one who carries out <b>garlic leaves and onion leaves,</b> if they are <b>moist,</b> is <b>equivalent to a dried fig-bulk.</b> If the garlic leaves and onion leaves are <b>dry,</b> the measure for liability is <b>equivalent to a goat’s mouthful. And none</b> of these substances <b>join</b> together <b>with one another</b> to constitute an amount for which one would be liable <b>because they are not equal in their measures. Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said:</b> Substances that have a more lenient legal status and have a greater measure for liability <b>do not join together</b> with the substances <b>among them</b> whose legal status is <b>more stringent</b> and whose measure for liability is smaller. For example, one who carries out a goat’s mouthful of a mixture of straw, which is more lenient, and grass, which is more stringent, is exempt. <b>However,</b> substances whose status is more stringent, like grass, <b>join together</b> with the substances <b>among them</b> whose status is <b>more lenient,</b> like an ear of grain. One who carries out a lamb’s mouthful of a mixture of grass, which is more stringent, and an ear of grain, which is more lenient, is liable.

### Part 8
The Gemara questions this principle: <b>And do any</b> items <b>that are not equal in their measures join together?</b> Don’t their fundamental differences preclude any combination? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna that the opposite is true? <b>The garment</b> must be at least <b>three by three</b> handbreadths in order to become a primary source of ritual impurity by means of ritual impurity imparted by treading of a <i>zav</i>. <b>And the sack</b> made from goats’ hair must be at least <b>four by four</b> handbreadths. <b>And the</b> animal <b>hide</b> must be <b>five by five,</b> and a <b>mat</b> must be <b>six by six. And</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught about</b> the mishna: <b>The garment and the sack, the sack and the hide,</b> and <b>the hide and the mat join together with one another. And Rabbi Shimon said: What is the reason</b> that they join together? <b>Because</b> all the component materials <b>are fit to become ritually impure</b> through the ritual impurity imparted to <b>a seat</b> upon which a <i>zav</i> sits, as they can each be used to patch a saddle or saddlecloth. Since they are all suitable for the same use, they join together with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity. By inference: <b>The reason</b> they can combine is <b>because they are fit to become ritually impure</b> through the ritual impurity imparted to <b>a seat. However,</b> in a case where the combination <b>is</b> of several items <b>not fit to become ritually impure</b> through the ritual impurity imparted to <b>a seat, no,</b> they do not join together even to the more lenient, larger measure. Apparently, in general, items with different measures do not join together.
