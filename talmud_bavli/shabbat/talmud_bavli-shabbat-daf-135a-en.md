### Part 1
<b>and</b> the circumcision of a halakhically <b>uncertain</b> foreskin <b>does not override Shabbat.</b> And by means of the same inference from the term his foreskin, derive that circumcision of <b>his definite foreskin overrides Shabbat, and</b> circumcising the foreskin of <b>a hermaphrodite</b> baby, with regard to whom there is uncertainty whether or not circumcision is required, <b>does not override Shabbat.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The circumcision of <b>a hermaphrodite overrides Shabbat, and</b> if he is not circumcised, when he reaches majority <b>he is punishable by <i>karet</i>.</b> Rabbi Yehuda interprets the verse in the following manner: <b>His definite foreskin overrides Shabbat; however,</b> the circumcision of one <b>born at twilight does not override Shabbat.</b> And likewise, <b>his definite foreskin overrides Shabbat; however,</b> the circumcision of one <b>who was born circumcised,</b> i.e., without a foreskin, <b>does not override Shabbat.</b> With regard to a child in that condition, there is a dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, <b>as Beit Shammai say: It is necessary to drip covenantal blood from him,</b> in lieu of circumcision of the foreskin, <b>and Beit Hillel say: It is not necessary,</b> as he is already circumcised.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said:</b> That was not the subject of their dispute, as <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree over</b> the fact that <b>from one who was born circumcised, it is necessary to drip covenantal blood, because</b> they agree that <b>it is a</b> case of a <b>concealed foreskin.</b> The child is not actually circumcised; it is just that his foreskin is not visible. <b>With regard to what did they disagree? With regard to a convert who</b> for some reason was circumcised when he was a gentile and <b>converted when he was</b> already <b>circumcised, as Beit Shammai say: Dripping covenantal blood from him is necessary, and Beit Hillel say: Dripping covenantal blood from him is not necessary,</b> and he needs only a ritual immersion to complete his conversion.

### Part 4
The Gemara cited above that <b>the Master said:</b> The circumcision of a halakhically <b>uncertain</b> foreskin <b>does not override Shabbat.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> case of uncertainty does this statement come <b>to include?</b> The Gemara answers: It comes <b>to include that which the Sages taught:</b> To circumcise a <b>child</b> born after <b>seven</b> months of pregnancy, <b>one desecrates Shabbat,</b> as it will likely live. <b>However,</b> to circumcise a <b>child</b> born after <b>eight</b> months of pregnancy, with regard to whom the presumption was that he would not survive, <b>one may not desecrate Shabbat.</b> And even <b>for</b> the circumcision of a child with regard to whom there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether the <b>child</b> was born after <b>seven</b> months and <b>uncertainty</b> whether the <b>child</b> was born after <b>eight</b> months, <b>one may not desecrate Shabbat.</b>

### Part 5
And the Sages taught: <b>A child</b> born after <b>eight</b> months <b>is like a stone</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of set-aside [<i>muktze</i>], <b>and it is prohibited to move him. However, his mother may bend over</b> the child <b>and nurse him due to the danger</b> that failure to nurse will cause her to fall ill.

### Part 6
With regard to the halakhic ruling in the case of a child born circumcised, <b>it is stated</b> that the Sages disagree. <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the explanation of the <b>first <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., in accordance with Rabbi Yehuda’s explanation of the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, that they disagree with regard to one born circumcised. Since we rule in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel, it is not necessary to drip covenantal blood from a child born circumcised. <b>And Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel do not disagree with regard to one born circumcised, and that everyone agrees that it is necessary to drip covenantal blood from him.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates that <b>to Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> there was <b>this child that was born circumcised,</b> and the time for his circumcision was on Shabbat. <b>He inquired after thirteen</b> ritual <b>circumcisors,</b> but they refused to circumcise him, <b>until</b> ultimately, he circumcised his son himself and <b>rendered him</b> one with a <b>severed urethra.</b> He did not know how to perform a circumcision and made too deep an incision. Rav Adda bar Ahava <b>said: I have it coming to me,</b> i.e., I deserve to be punished, <b>as I violated</b> the ruling of <b>Rav,</b> who ruled that one born circumcised does not even need covenantal blood drawn.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Naḥman said to him: And did he not violate</b> the ruling of <b>Shmuel? Say that Shmuel said</b> that one is required to drip covenantal blood <b>during the week, on Shabbat, did he say</b> so? Certainly one does not desecrate Shabbat in that case. The Gemara explains that Rav Adda bar Ahava <b>held</b> differently, that in that case there is not merely a concern that perhaps there is a concealed foreskin. In that case, that <b>there is definitely a concealed foreskin.</b> Therefore, a form of circumcision must be performed on the child, and it overrides Shabbat. <b>As it was stated</b> that there is an amoraic dispute as to whether or not it is permitted to drip covenantal blood on Shabbat from a child born circumcised. <b>Rabba said: We are concerned lest there is a concealed foreskin,</b> and therefore there is uncertainty whether or not he is considered uncircumcised, and therefore it is prohibited to circumcise him on Shabbat. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> In that case, <b>there is certainly a concealed foreskin</b> and therefore, it is permitted to circumcise him even on Shabbat.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Yosef said: From where do I say this</b> line of reasoning? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer HaKappar says:</b> There is a tradition that <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to</b> a child who <b>was born circumcised, that one is required to drip covenantal blood from him. With regard to what did they disagree?</b> With regard to whether or not <b>to desecrate Shabbat on his</b> behalf. <b>Beit Shammai say: One desecrates Shabbat</b> in order to circumcise <b>him, and Beit Hillel say: One does not desecrate Shabbat</b> in order to circumcise <b>him.</b> Rav Yosef concludes: <b>Does this not</b> prove <b>by inference that the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> whose opinion Rabbi Eliezer HaKappar disputes, <b>holds</b> that everyone agrees that <b>one desecrates Shabbat on his</b> behalf, and Rabbi Eliezer HaKappar disagrees and states that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel dispute that very matter?

### Part 10
The Gemara refutes this: <b>And perhaps</b> the <b>first <i>tanna</i> is saying</b> that <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>one may not desecrate</b> Shabbat in that case, and Rabbi Eliezer HaKappar disagrees and holds that there is a dispute in this regard. The Gemara immediately rejects this assertion: <b>If</b> that is <b>so,</b> that Rabbi Eliezer HaKappar is coming to introduce an opinion that allows desecrating Shabbat to perform circumcision in this case, that is the opinion of Beit Shammai; did <b>Rabbi Eliezer HaKappar come to teach us the reasoning</b> of <b>Beit Shammai?</b> Their opinion is rejected as <i>halakha</i>, and there would be no purpose in making a statement simply to explain the opinion of Beit Shammai. The Gemara answers that proof is not absolute; <b>perhaps this is what he is saying: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to this matter</b> of circumcision of a baby born circumcised on Shabbat. They disagree with regard to the requirement to drip covenantal blood on a weekday.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Asi stated</b> a principle: <b>Any</b> child <b>whose</b> birth renders his <b>mother ritually impure</b> due to <b>childbirth is circumcised at eight</b> days; <b>and any</b> child <b>whose</b> birth does <b>not</b> render <b>his mother ritually impure</b> due to <b>childbirth,</b> e.g., the birth was not natural, but by caesarean section, is <b>not</b> necessarily <b>circumcised at eight</b> days. <b>As it is stated: “If a woman bears seed and gives birth to a male, she shall be impure</b> seven days…<b>and on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:2–3). This verse draws a parallel between the two issues, indicating that only a child whose birth renders his mother impure is circumcised on the eighth day.

### Part 12
<b>Abaye said to him: The early generations,</b> from Abraham through the revelation at Sinai, <b>will prove</b> that the principle is not valid, <b>as</b> the birth of a male during that era did <b>not</b> render <b>his mother ritually impure</b> due to <b>childbirth,</b> as the <i>halakhot</i> of the impurity of childbirth were commanded at Sinai, <b>and</b> nevertheless, the child <b>was circumcised at eight</b> days, as stated in the Torah, in the book of Genesis.

### Part 13
Rabbi Asi <b>said to him:</b> There is no proof from here, as when <b>the Torah was</b> later <b>given,</b>
