### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>However, didn’t</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>derive</b> this by means of <b>a verbal analogy?</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira <b>did not learn a verbal analogy.</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira had no tradition of this verbal analogy from his teachers, and therefore he disagreed with Rabbi Akiva’s conclusion. The Gemara asks: <b>However,</b> according to Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, <b>from where was</b> Zelophehad’s liability derived? Why was he executed? The Gemara answers: Zelophehad was among those who <b>“presumed</b> to ascend to the top of the mountain” (Numbers 14:44) in the wake of the sin of the spies.

### Part 2
<b>On a similar note,</b> Rabbi Akiva revealed an additional matter not explicitly articulated in the Torah. <b>You say</b> that when Aaron and Miriam spoke against Moses, both Aaron and Miriam were struck with leprosy, as it written: <b>“And God became angry at them and He left,</b> and the cloud departed from above the tent, and behold, Miriam was leprous like snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous” (Numbers 12:9–10). The verse’s statement that God became angry at both of them <b>teaches that Aaron, too, became leprous;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira said to him: Akiva, in either case you will be judged in the future</b> for this teaching. <b>If</b> the truth is <b>in accordance with your statement, the Torah concealed</b> Aaron’s punishment <b>and you reveal it. And if</b> the truth is not in accordance with your statement, <b>you are</b> unjustly <b>slandering that righteous man.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>However, didn’t</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>derive</b> this from the plural pronoun <b>them,</b> meaning that God was angry with both of them? The Gemara answers: God’s anger in <b>that</b> verse was manifest in <b>a mere rebuke,</b> not in leprosy. A <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, <b>who said</b> that <b>Aaron also became leprous, as it is written: “And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous”</b> (Numbers 12:10), and it was <b>taught:</b> This teaches <b>that he turned,</b> i.e., he was healed, <b>from his leprosy,</b> as he too had been afflicted.

### Part 4
On the topic of Miriam’s leprosy, the Gemara cites that which <b>Reish Lakish said: One who suspects the innocent</b> of indiscretion <b>is afflicted in his body, as it is written:</b> “And Moses answered and said: <b>But they will not believe me</b> and will not hearken to my voice, for they will say, God did not appear to you” (Exodus 4:1), <b>and it is revealed before the Holy One, Blessed be He, that the Jewish people would believe.</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>said to</b> Moses: <b>They are believers, the children of believers; and ultimately, you will not believe.</b>

### Part 5
<b>They are believers, as it is written: “And the people believed</b> once they heard that God had remembered the children of Israel, and that He saw their affliction, and they bowed and they prostrated” (Exodus 4:31). <b>The children of believers,</b> as it says with regard to Abraham our Patriarch: <b>“And he believed in God,</b> and He counted it for him as righteousness” (Genesis 15:6). <b>Ultimately, you will not believe, as it is stated:</b> “And God said to Moses and to Aaron: <b>Because you did not believe in Me</b> to sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel” (Numbers 20:12). <b>From where</b> do we know that Moses <b>was afflicted</b> in his body? <b>As it is written: “And God said to him further: Bring your hand to your bosom,</b> and he brought his hand to his bosom and he took it out and behold, his hand was leprous like snow” (Exodus 4:6).

### Part 6
On this topic, <b>Rava said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> who said: The divine <b>attribute of beneficence takes effect more quickly than the</b> divine <b>attribute of punishment.</b> From where is this derived? <b>While, with regard to the</b> divine <b>attribute of punishment, it is written, “And he took it out and behold, his hand was leprous like snow”</b> (Exodus 4:6), <b>with regard to the</b> divine <b>attribute of beneficence it is written:</b> “And He said: Return your hand to your bosom, and he returned his hand to his bosom <b>and he took it out from his bosom and behold, it had returned to be like his original flesh”</b> (Exodus 4:7). The Gemara analyzes this as follows: It was already <b>from his bosom</b> that <b>it returned to be like his original flesh.</b> Moses’ hand was healed even before he took his hand out.

### Part 7
The Gemara proceeds to discuss another miracle that transpired at that time. With regard to the verse, “And each man threw down his staff and they became serpents, <b>and Aaron’s staff swallowed their staffs”</b> (Exodus 7:12), <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This was <b>a miracle within a miracle.</b> It was Aaron’s staff, not his serpent, that swallowed the other staffs.

### Part 8
We learned in the mishna that there is a dispute between Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis in a case where one threw an object <b>from the private domain to the</b> other <b>private domain</b> through the public domain between the two. Rabbi Akiva deems him liable, as one who threw an object from the private domain to the public domain, and the Rabbis deem him exempt.

### Part 9
<b>Rabba raised a dilemma</b> with regard to their dispute: <b>Are they disagreeing</b> with regard to a case where the object traveled <b>below ten</b> handbreadths from the ground? <b>And,</b> if so, <b>it is with regard to this</b> point <b>that they disagree: As this Master,</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>holds: We say</b> that <b>an object in airspace is considered at rest.</b> The object is considered as if it was actually placed in the public domain after being lifted from the private domain. <b>And this Master,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds: We do not say</b> that <b>an object in airspace is considered at rest. However,</b> with regard to a case where the object traveled <b>above ten</b> handbreadths from the ground, <b>everyone agrees</b> that one is <b>exempt, and we do not derive</b> the legal status of <b>throwing from</b> the legal status of <b>passing.</b> Although everyone agrees that one who passes an object from a private domain to another private domain via a public domain is liable, even if it was passed above ten handbreadths, as that was the service of the Levites, one who throws an object in that manner is exempt.

### Part 10
<b>Or perhaps, they are disagreeing</b> with regard to a case where the object traveled <b>above ten</b> handbreadths from the ground, and <b>it is with regard to this that they disagree: As this Master,</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>holds: We derive</b> the legal status of <b>throwing from</b> the legal status of <b>passing.</b> Therefore, one who throws an object that passes through the airspace of a public domain higher than ten handbreadths from the ground is liable. <b>And this Master,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds: We do not derive throwing from passing. However,</b> with regard to a case where the object traveled <b>beneath</b> the <b>ten</b> handbreadth airspace of the public domain, <b>everyone agrees</b> that he is <b>liable. What is the reason</b> for that? <b>An object in airspace is considered at rest.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rav Yosef said: Rav Ḥisda had a dilemma</b> with regard to <b>this matter, and Rav Hamnuna resolved it for him from this</b> <i>baraita</i>: With regard to an object that travels <b>from the private domain to the</b> other <b>private domain, and it passes through the public domain itself, Rabbi Akiva deems</b> one <b>liable and the Rabbis deem</b> one <b>exempt. From the fact that it says</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Through the public domain itself, it is obvious</b> that it is <b>with regard to</b> a case where the object traveled below <b>ten</b> handbreadths from the ground <b>that they disagree.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And with regard to what</b> form of transfer is the <i>baraita</i> dealing? <b>If you say</b> it refers to <b>passing</b> an object in his hand, is it only when he passes it <b>below ten</b> handbreadths that <b>he is liable?</b> When he passes it <b>above ten</b> handbreadths <b>is he not liable? Didn’t Rabbi Elazar say: One who carries out a load</b> from a private domain to a public domain <b>above ten</b> handbreadths from the ground <b>is liable, as that was the</b> manner in which <b>the descendants of Kehat,</b> from whom we derived the laws of carrying, carried their <b>burden</b> in the Tabernacle? <b>Rather, isn’t</b> this <i>baraita</i> referring to a case <b>of throwing, and it is</b> in a case where the object travels <b>below ten</b> handbreadths from the ground <b>that one is liable,</b> and <b>above ten</b> handbreadths from the ground <b>one is not liable? Learn from it</b> that it is <b>with regard to</b> whether or not <b>an object in airspace is considered at rest</b> that <b>they disagree.</b> The Gemara summarizes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that this is the crux of their dispute.

### Part 13
<b>And</b> this conclusion <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar said: Rabbi Akiva deems</b> one <b>liable even</b> if the object travels <b>above ten</b> handbreadths. <b>And that</b> term that <b>was taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>the public domain itself,</b> is <b>to convey to you the far-reaching</b> nature of the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> who deem one exempt even if the object traveled in the public domain itself, and all the more so if it traveled above ten handbreadths, which is no longer within the bounds of the public domain.

### Part 14
This opinion of Rabbi Elazar <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥilkiya bar Tovi, as Rav Ḥilkiya bar Tovi said:</b> If the thrown object traveled <b>within three</b> handbreadths from the ground, <b>everyone agrees</b> that one is <b>liable</b> because the Sages established the principle of <i>lavud</i>. <i>Lavud</i> means that any object within three handbreadths of another object is considered to be attached to it. Therefore, an object that traveled within three handbreadths of the ground is considered to have come to a complete rest. If the thrown object traveled <b>above ten</b> handbreadths from the ground, <b>everyone agrees</b> that one is <b>exempt.</b> If the thrown object traveled <b>between three</b> handbreadths <b>and ten</b> handbreadths from the ground, <b>we have come to the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 15
<b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Within three</b> handbreadths of the ground, <b>everyone agrees</b> that one is <b>liable; above ten</b> handbreadths from the ground, <b>everyone agrees</b> that one is exempt by Torah law, and <b>it is only</b> prohibited <b>due to rabbinic decree.</b> The Sages prohibited throwing or passing an object from the private domain of one person set to the private domain of another person unless a joining of the courtyards is set. <b>And if both of</b> the private <b>domains were his it is permitted.</b> If the thrown object traveled <b>between three</b> handbreadths <b>and ten</b> handbreadths from the ground, <b>Rabbi Akiva deems</b> one <b>liable and the Sages deem</b> him <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 16
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>And if both of</b> the private <b>domains were his,</b> i.e., they belonged to the same person, <b>it is permitted. Let us say</b> that this <b>is a conclusive refutation</b> of <b>Rav’s</b> opinion, <b>as</b> an amoraic dispute <b>was stated</b> with regard to the following case: Concerning <b>two houses on two</b> opposite <b>sides of the public domain,</b> even if they belong to the same person, <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: It is prohibited to throw</b> an object <b>from this</b> private domain <b>to that</b> private domain. <b>And Shmuel said: It is permitted to throw from this</b> private domain <b>to that</b> private domain. The Gemara rejects this and states: <b>Didn’t we</b> already <b>establish that</b> Rav’s statement is referring to a case <b>where one</b> of the houses <b>was elevated and one was low?</b> Due to the disparity in height, the concern is that <b>at times</b> the object <b>will fall</b> into the public domain, <b>and</b> one <b>will come to bring it</b> in from there and thereby violate a Torah prohibition.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Hamnuna, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna</b> said <b>to Rav Ḥisda:</b> From <b>where is this matter that the Sages stated: Any</b> objects <b>less than three</b> handbreadths apart <b>are considered to be <i>lavud</i>,</b> attached? <b>He said to him: Because it is impossible for the public domain to be made level with planes.</b> Since the space cannot be completely smooth, even the minor differences in the ground level throughout the public domain must be taken into consideration.

### Part 18
He asked him: <b>If so,</b> if that is the reason, objects within <b>three</b> handbreadths should <b>also</b> be considered <i>lavud</i>. Why is it that only objects within less than three handbreadths are considered attached? <b>And furthermore,</b> an inference can be made from <b>that which we learned</b> in the mishna with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>sukka</i>: If <b>one lowers the walls</b> of a <i>sukka</i> <b>from the top to the bottom, if</b> the bottom of the wall <b>is above three handbreadths</b> from the ground, the <i>sukka</i> <b>is invalid</b> because it is considered to be lacking walls. By inference, if one lowers the walls so that the bottom of the wall is <b>below three</b> handbreadths from the ground, it is <b>valid.</b> In this case, the rationale that it is impossible for the public domain to be made level does not apply.

### Part 19
He rejects this: <b>There, the reason</b> that a space larger than three handbreadths is not considered to be part of the wall is <b>because it,</b> i.e., the wall, <b>is a partition that goats pass through.</b> Therefore, it is a partition incapable of serving its function. Once a partition is below three handbreadths, it will obstruct the passage of the goats. Furthermore, according to this explanation, <b>it works out well</b> when the measure of three handbreadths is <b>below,</b> adjacent to the ground. If any more than three handbreadths of space are between the ground and the wall, it is not considered a wall. However, there are several <i>halakhot</i> in which <i>lavud</i> applies <b>above</b> and not near the ground, e.g., when the roofing of the <i>sukka</i> is not connected to the walls. <b>What,</b> then, <b>can be said</b> to explain that <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rather,</b> the conclusion is that the <i>halakha</i> which states that <b>anything that is less than three is considered to be <i>lavud</i> is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>learned through tradition.</b>

### Part 20
<b>The Sages taught</b> a case in a <i>baraita</i> similar to the one discussed in the mishna: One who throws an object <b>from the public domain to the</b> other <b>public domain and</b> the object passes through <b>the private domain between</b> the two, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems him liable</b> for carrying into the private domain, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt.</b> With regard to this, <b>Rav and Shmuel both said: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> him <b>liable only</b> if <b>the private domain</b> between the two public areas <b>is covered</b> with a roof. In that case, <b>we say</b> that <b>the house is considered full</b> and an object that passes through it is considered as if it landed upon an actual object. <b>However,</b> if the private domain <b>is not covered,</b> he <b>is not</b> liable even according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. On this topic, <b>Rav Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>would deem him liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin-offerings in this case, <b>one for carrying out</b> from the private domain into the second public domain, <b>and one for carrying in,</b> when the object initially entered the private domain.

### Part 21
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ḥana was sitting, and</b> the following point <b>was difficult for him:</b>
