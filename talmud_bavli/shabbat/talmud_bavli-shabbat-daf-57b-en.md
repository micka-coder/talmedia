### Part 1
<b>Here we are dealing with a broad, ornamented strap [<i>katla</i>]</b> hanging around the neck, to which a small bib is attached. <b>A woman does strangle herself</b> with a <i>katla</i> because the strap is broad and tightening it does not cause pain. She tightens it <b>because it pleases her that she will appear fleshy.</b> It was considered beautiful to have flesh protrude from the <i>katla</i>.

### Part 2
In the same mishna in tractate <i>Mikvaot</i>, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Strings <b>of wool and</b> strands <b>of hair do not interpose</b> and invalidate the immersion <b>because the water reaches through them.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to strands of hair.</b> However, the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with his opinion with regard to wool strings.

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> By saying that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with Rav Yehuda, <b>by inference</b> the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> with regard to strands of hair. However, no opinion stating that strands of hair constitute an interposition is cited in the mishna.

### Part 5
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>had we not heard from the first <i>tanna</i> that he is speaking of strands of hair,</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>would also not have spoken</b> about them. Apparently, the first <i>tanna</i> prohibited strands of hair, and Rabbi Yehuda disagreed with him. Nevertheless, it could be explained otherwise. <b>And, perhaps he</b> prefaced what he <b>was saying</b> to the Rabbis with the phrase: <b>Just as. Just as you agree with me</b> that <b>strands of hair</b> do not interpose, <b>agree with me</b> that <b>strings of wool also</b> do not interpose. The fact that he mentioned strands of hair does not indicate a dispute; on the contrary, it is an attempt to establish a consensus with regard to the <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 6
Indeed, <b>it was stated</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The Rabbis agree with Rabbi Yehuda with regard to strands of hair.</b>

### Part 7
<b>This</b> opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Strings of wool interpose. Strands of hair do not interpose. Rabbi Yehuda says: Both</b> strings <b>of wool and</b> strands <b>of hair do not interpose.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The language of <b>the mishna is also precise,</b> as we learned in a mishna in our chapter: <b>A woman may go out with strands of hair whether</b> they are <b>from her</b> own hair or <b>whether</b> they are <b>from</b> the hair of <b>another. Whose</b> opinion <b>is</b> expressed in this mishna? <b>If you say</b> that it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, even strings of wool</b> should <b>also</b> have been permitted. <b>Rather, is it not the</b> opinion of <b>the Rabbis; and conclude from it</b> that <b>with regard to strands of hair, they do not disagree?</b> The Gemara determines: Indeed, <b>conclude from it.</b>

### Part 9
The mishna said that a woman may <b>not</b> go out <b>with</b> the ornament called a <b><i>totefet</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is a <i>totefet</i>? Rav Yosef said: A packet of spices</b> to ward off the evil eye.

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said to him: And let</b> the legal status of <b>this</b> packet <b>be like</b> that of <b>an effective amulet,</b> whose effectiveness is proven, <b>and</b> it should <b>be permitted,</b> as an effective amulet may be moved on Shabbat.

### Part 11
<b>Rather, Rav Yehuda said in the name of Abaye:</b> A <i>totefet</i> is an <b><i>appuzainu</i>,</b> an ornament worn on the forehead. This opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A woman may go out with a gilded hairnet</b> worn to hold the hair in place, <b>and with the <i>totefet,</i> and with the <i>sarvitin</i> that are fastened to the hairnet,</b> since a woman would not remove her head covering to show her friend those ornaments.

### Part 12
And they said: <b>Which is a <i>totefet</i> and which is <i>sarvitin</i>? Rabbi Abbahu said: <i>Totefet</i> is that which goes around her</b> forehead <b>from ear to ear. <i>Sarvitin</i> are those</b> attached to the net <b>that reach</b> down <b>to her cheeks.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav Huna said: Poor women make</b> these ornaments <b>from</b> different <b>types of colored</b> materials. <b>Wealthy women make them of silver and of gold.</b>

### Part 14
We learned in the mishna that a woman may <b>not</b> go out with <b>a <i>kavul</i>. Rabbi Yannai said: This <i>kavul</i>, I do not know what it is. Is it the seal of a slave,</b> who would have a seal on his clothing identifying him as a slave, about <b>which we learned</b> in our mishna that it is prohibited, <b>but a cap of wool</b> that a woman places on her hair, she may <b>well</b> go out wearing it? <b>Or, perhaps we learned</b> in our mishna that going out with <b>a cap of wool</b> is prohibited <b>and all the more so</b> that going out with <b>the seal of a slave</b> is prohibited.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said: It is reasonable</b> to say <b>in accordance with the one who said</b> that <b>we learned</b> about <b>a cap of wool</b> in the mishna. <b>And this</b> opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A woman may go out with a <i>kavul</i> and with an <i>istema</i> to the courtyard</b> on Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> She may <b>even</b> go out <b>with the <i>kavul</i> into the public domain. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar stated a principle: Anything that is</b> worn <b>beneath the hairnet,</b> a woman <b>may go out</b> into the public domain <b>with it,</b> since a woman will not uncover her hair even to show off an ornament while in the public domain. <b>Anything that is</b> worn <b>over the hairnet,</b> like an ornamental hat, a woman <b>may not go out with it.</b> From the context and proximity of the <i>halakha</i> dealing with <i>kavul</i> to the statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, apparently a <i>kavul</i> is a wool cap worn under the net.

### Part 16
Since <i>istema</i> was mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>What is an <i>istema</i>? Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> <i>Istema</i> is a <b><i>beizyunei</i>.</b> However, Rabbi Abbahu’s explanation employed a term from the Aramaic dialect spoken in Eretz Yisrael, which was not understood in Babylonia. Therefore, they asked there: <b>What is</b> a <b><i>beizyunei</i></b>? <b>Abaye said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> It is a small hat or ribbon used to <b>gather hairs that protrude [<i>kalya paruḥei</i>]</b> from the headdress.

### Part 17
<b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> that <b>three things were said with regard to an <i>istema</i>: There is no</b> prohibition of a mixture of <b>diverse kinds,</b> wool and linen, <b>in it.</b> Since it is made of hard felt and not woven together, the prohibition of diverse kinds does not apply to material of that kind. <b>And it does not become impure with</b> the ritual impurity of <b>leprosy.</b> Only woven garments can become impure with leprosy. <b>And</b> women <b>may not go out with it to the public domain</b> on Shabbat.

### Part 18
<b>In the name of Rabbi Shimon they said: Also,</b>
