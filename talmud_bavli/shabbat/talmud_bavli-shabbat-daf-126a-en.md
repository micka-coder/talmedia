### Part 1
<b>Both</b> if it is <b>tied and</b> if it is <b>not</b> tied it is permitted, <b>and that is</b> only <b>if it is prepared</b> for this purpose beforehand.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to</b> Rabbi Abba: <b>And let the Master say</b> it in this way: <b>Both if it is hanging and if it is not hanging, and that is</b> only <b>if it is tied, as Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Like the dispute here</b> with regard to the window shutter, <b>so too</b> is the <b>dispute with regard to a bolt that was dragged,</b> which refers to a pole that was stuck through a hole in the door and into the ground in order to hold the door in place. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>a bolt that is dragged,</b> which is not a part of the door itself but is attached to it and is dragged on the ground, <b>one locks with it in the Temple</b> on Shabbat, because the rabbinic decrees are not in effect in the Temple, <b>but not in the</b> rest of the <b>country</b> outside the Temple. <b>And</b> a bolt <b>that is placed</b> alongside the door and not attached, <b>here,</b> in the Temple, <b>and there,</b> outside the Temple, it is <b>prohibited</b> to lock with it on Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One that was placed</b> is permitted <b>in the Temple and one that is dragged</b> is permitted even <b>in the</b> rest of the <b>country.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is a bolt that is dragged that one locks with it in the Temple but not in the</b> rest of the <b>country? Any</b> bolt <b>that is tied and hangs</b> from the door <b>and</b> one of <b>its edges reaches the ground. Rabbi Yehuda says: That is permitted even in the</b> rest of the <b>country. Rather, what is prohibited in the</b> rest of the <b>country? Any</b> bolt <b>that is neither tied nor hung, and one removes it</b> from the door <b>and places it in a corner.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua bar Abba said in the name of Ulla: Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>who taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a bolt that is dragged?</b> The <i>tanna</i> <b>is Rabbi Eliezer,</b> whose opinion in this case is identical to his opinion in the mishna with regard to the window shutter. It is certainly referring to a shutter that is attached. If it is not attached, Rabbi Eliezer holds that it is prohibited for use even in the Temple.

### Part 5
Rabbi Abba <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>It is I who say</b> that this case is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: With regard to <b>a reed that the homeowner installed to open and lock</b> the door <b>with it</b> like a bolt, <b>when it is tied and hanging in the entrance, one may open and lock</b> the door <b>with it</b> on Shabbat, and when it is <b>not tied and hanging, one may not open and lock</b> the door <b>with it. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If it was <b>prepared</b> for that use, it is permitted to use it <b>even if it is not tied.</b> There is an opinion that holds that a bolt need not be attached, and preparation is sufficient to permit its use.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Yehuda bar Sheilat said</b> that <b>Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> in this case <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> really <b>say this? Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>All covers of vessels</b>
