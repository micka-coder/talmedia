### Part 1
<b>kindness from his friend</b> and awe of the Almighty will leave” (Job 6:14), <b>since in the Greek language they call a dog <i>lamas</i>. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> One who keeps an evil dog in his home <b>even divests himself of fear of Heaven, as it is stated</b> at the end of that verse: <b>“And awe of the Almighty will leave.”</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>A certain</b> pregnant <b>woman who entered to</b> use the oven in a <b>certain house to bake, the dog</b> in that house <b>barked at her, and her fetus was displaced. The owner of the house said to her: Do not be afraid because his teeth have been removed and his claws have been removed. She said to him: Take your goodness and throw it on the thorns.</b> Your encouragement is useless as the <b>fetus has already been displaced</b> and will certainly die.

### Part 3
On a related note, <b>Rav Huna said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Rejoice young man in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes; but know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment”</b> (Ecclesiastes 11:9)? <b>Until here,</b> “the sight of your eyes,” these are <b>the words of the evil inclination; from here on,</b> “but know that, etc.,” these are <b>the words of the good inclination.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Reish Lakish said: Until here,</b> the verse refers <b>to matters of Torah.</b> One is provided the opportunity to study and involve himself in the Torah and rejoice in its innovations; <b>from here on,</b> “but know that, etc.,” <b>it refers to good deeds.</b> One will ultimately stand trial for that which he studied and did not implement.

### Part 5
We learned in the mishna that <b>a garter is pure. Rav Yehuda said: Garter; that is a bracelet</b> worn on the arm.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Yosef raised an objection:</b> It is stated here that <b>a garter is pure and</b> a woman <b>may go out with it on Shabbat, while a bracelet is ritually impure.</b> It is mentioned explicitly in the verse enumerating the spoils of the war with the Midianites: “And we have brought the Lord’s offering, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and girdles, to make atonement for our souls before the Lord” (Numbers 31:50). Earlier in that chapter it is written with regard to the spoils: “Purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day both you and your captives” (Numbers 31:19). Apparently, a bracelet can become ritually impure.

### Part 7
<b>Rather, this is what</b> Rav Yehuda <b>is saying: A garter</b> on the leg <b>is in place of a bracelet</b> on the arm. It goes around the leg to hold a stocking in place just as a bracelet goes around the arm. However, unlike a bracelet, a garter cannot become ritually impure because it is not an ornament. It simply holds up the stocking.

### Part 8
The Gemara relates: <b>Ravin and Rav Huna were sitting before Rav Yirmeya. And Rav Yirmeya was sitting and dozing</b> as the two students conversed. <b>And Ravin sat and said:</b> The difference between a garter and ankle chains is that <b>a garter is</b> worn <b>on one</b> leg, <b>and ankle chains</b> are worn <b>on two</b> legs.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Huna said to him: These</b> garters <b>and those</b> ankle chains <b>are</b> both worn <b>on two</b> legs. <b>And</b> when she wears garters on both legs <b>they place a chain between them, and they become</b> vessels with the legal status equal to that of <b>ankle chains.</b>

### Part 10
And Ravin asked: <b>And</b> does <b>the chain that</b> is connected to <b>it render it a vessel?</b> If a garter without a chain is not considered a vessel, why would the addition of a chain render it a vessel that can become ritually impure?

### Part 11
<b>And if you say</b> the reason for this <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani, as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a metal vessel</b> that <b>makes a sound is</b> considered a vessel and can become <b>ritually impure? As it is stated: “Every thing that passes through the fire, you shall make it pass through the fire,</b> and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of sprinkling; and all that does not pass through the fire you shall make to go through water” (Numbers 31:23). And the Sages interpret the verse homiletically: Every thing [<i>davar</i>], <b>even speech [<i>dibbur</i>];</b> in other words, even an object that makes a sound shall pass through fire to become purified because it is a vessel.

### Part 12
However, this case is not similar. <b>Granted, there, they require</b> the vessel <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>its sound and it performs an action.</b> However, <b>here, what action does</b> the chain <b>perform?</b> Although it creates a sound, the chain serves no purpose.

### Part 13
He said to him: <b>Here, too,</b> the <b>chain is performing a</b> purposeful <b>action,</b> as <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There was one family in Jerusalem whose</b> daughters’ <b>strides were lengthy, and</b> as a result <b>their hymen</b> membranes <b>would fall</b> away. In order to solve this problem they made them ankle chains <b>and they hung a chain between them so that their strides would not be</b> so <b>large and,</b> indeed, <b>their hymen</b> membranes <b>would no</b> longer <b>fall</b> away. Meanwhile, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya awoke from their</b> voices <b>and said to them: Correct, and Rabbi Yoḥanan said likewise.</b>

### Part 14
On the topic of ritual impurity, the Gemara relates: <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a woven fabric of any size</b> can <b>become</b> ritually impure? It is derived <b>from the frontplate [<i>tzitz</i>]</b> of the High Priest, which is considered a vessel despite its small size.

### Part 15
<b>Abaye said to him: And is the frontplate a woven fabric? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The frontplate is</b> made <b>like a kind of</b> smooth <b>plate of gold, and</b> its <b>width is two fingerbreadths, and it encircles</b> the forehead <b>from ear to ear. And on it is written in two lines: <i>Yod heh</i>,</b> i.e., the Tetragrammaton, <b>above, and <i>kodesh lamed</i>,</b> i.e., sacred to, <b>below.</b> Thus, the words: Sacred to God, were written on the frontplate. In deference to the name of God, it would be written on the top line, and the words: Sacred to, on the line below.

### Part 16
<b>And Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: I saw it</b> in the Caesar’s treasury <b>in the city of Rome and Sacred to God was written on one line.</b> In any case, since the frontplate is a gold plate, how can it serve as a source for ritual impurity in fabrics?

### Part 17
<b>When Rav Dimi ascended to Neharde’a, he sent to</b> the yeshiva students: <b>The statements I said to you</b> with regard to woven fabrics of any size becoming ritually impure regardless of their size, <b>they are my mistake. However, this</b> is what <b>they said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: From where</b> is it derived <b>that an ornament of any size</b> can become <b>ritually impure?</b> It is derived <b>from the frontplate. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that a woven fabric of any size</b> can become <b>ritually impure?</b> It is derived <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“Or a garment</b> or leather or sack; any vessel with which any work is done must be put into water and it shall be unclean until evening, then it shall be clean” (Leviticus 11:32). From the extraneous phrase, “or a garment,” it is derived that any garment, regardless how small, falls into this category.

### Part 18
Similarly, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A woven fabric of any size</b> can become <b>ritually impure, and an ornament of any size</b> can become <b>ritually impure.</b> An object that is half <b>woven</b> fabric <b>and</b> half <b>ornament</b> of <b>any size</b> can become <b>ritually impure.</b> And <b>a sack is added</b> to the category of <b>garment; it</b> too <b>is ritually impure due to woven fabric.</b>

### Part 19
<b>Rava said</b> in explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>A woven fabric of any size is ritually impure</b> as derived <b>from</b> the phrase <b>“or a garment.” An ornament of any size is ritually impure,</b> as derived <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the frontplate. A woven fabric and an ornament of any size is ritually impure,</b> as derived <b>from</b> that which is stated: “And Moses and Elazar the priest took the gold from them, <b>all vessels with which labor is done”</b> (Numbers 31:51). Any object that can be utilized for any action falls into the category of: All vessels with which labor is done.

### Part 20
<b>One of the Sages said to Rava: That</b> verse <b>is written with regard to Midian.</b> There it is referring specifically to ritual impurity imparted by a corpse, and how is it possible to derive from that <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity in general?

### Part 21
<b>Rava said to him: He derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy
