### Part 1
One whose clothes fell into water on a Festival may not dry them in the conventional manner; however, <b>he may spread them out in the sun, but not before the people,</b> who may suspect that he laundered his clothes on Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</b> doing so even in a place concealed from view. Apparently, the Sages disagree whether or not an action prohibited due to the appearance of prohibition is prohibited everywhere.

### Part 2
We learned in the mishna that a woman may go out on Shabbat <b>with a cloth that is in her ear. Rami bar Yeḥezkel taught: And that is</b> specifically in a case <b>where</b> the cloth <b>is tied to her ear</b> and she will not come to carry it.

### Part 3
The mishna continues: A woman may go out <b>with a cloth that is in her sandal. Rami bar Yeḥezkel taught: And that is</b> specifically in a case <b>where</b> the cloth <b>is tied to her sandal.</b>

### Part 4
We learned in the mishna: A woman may go out <b>with a cloth that she placed due to her menstrual</b> flow. <b>Rami bar Ḥama considered saying that</b> it is permitted specifically in a case <b>where it is tied between her thighs. Rava said:</b> It is permitted <b>even though it is not tied to her; since it is repulsive, she will not come to carry it</b> even if it falls.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma before Rabbi Abba: If she made herself a handgrip</b> in which she could hold the cloth, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Since she does not have to touch the cloth with her bare hand, is there concern that she will come to carry it or not? <b>He said to him: It is permitted. It was also stated</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman bar Oshaya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: If she made herself a handgrip it is permitted.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan went out with</b> a cloth in his ear <b>to the study hall</b> on Shabbat, <b>and his colleagues are in disagreement with him</b> and rule that it is prohibited to do so because it was not tied to his ear. <b>Rabbi Yannai went out with it,</b> a cloth in his ear, <b>to a <i>karmelit</i>,</b> an intermediate domain, neither public nor private. <b>And all</b> the Sages <b>of his generation are in disagreement with him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t Rami bar Yeḥezkel teach: And that is</b> specifically in a case <b>where</b> the cloth <b>is tied to her ear?</b> How could these Sages ignore this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; this,</b> where it was taught that certain Sages went out with a cloth, is in a case <b>where it was</b> stuck <b>tightly</b> in their ears. Therefore, it was permitted even though it was not tied. <b>That,</b> where Rami bar Yeḥezkel said that going out with a cloth is permitted only when it is tied, is in a case <b>where it was not</b> stuck <b>tightly</b> in his ear.

### Part 7
We learned in the mishna: A woman may go out <b>with pepper and with a grain of salt</b> in her mouth. The Gemara explains: She places <b>pepper</b> in her mouth <b>to</b> prevent <b>mouth odor and a grain of salt to</b> treat <b>a toothache.</b> With regard to that which we learned in the mishna: A woman may go out on Shabbat <b>with any thing that she places in her mouth:</b> This refers to <b>ginger</b> or, <b>alternatively,</b> to <b>cinnamon [<i>dartzona</i>].</b>

### Part 8
We learned in the mishna that the Sages disagree whether or not a woman may go out on Shabbat <b>with a false tooth</b> and <b>a gold tooth; Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permits </b>doing so <b>and the Rabbis prohibit</b> doing so. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: They only taught</b> the dispute with regard to a <b>gold</b> tooth. Since it is precious, she might remove it from her mouth to show her friends and come to carry it. <b>However, with regard to a silver</b> tooth, which is less precious, there is no concern that she will remove it from her mouth. <b>Everyone agrees that it is permitted. That</b> opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a tooth made <b>of silver, everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>permitted.</b> With regard to a tooth <b>of gold, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permits</b> going out with it <b>and the Rabbis prohibit</b> going out with it.

### Part 9
<b>Abaye said: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and Rabbi Eliezer, and Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar all hold that anything that makes her unappealing</b> when removed, <b>she will not come to</b> remove it and <b>show it</b> to others. Therefore, it is permitted for her to go out with it.

### Part 10
The Gemara elaborates: The opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi is <b>that which we</b> just <b>stated.</b> The opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> is <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer exempts</b> a woman who went out <b>with a bundle of fragrant herbs and with a flask of balsam oil,</b> since a woman whose odor is foul does not remove and show the bundle to others.

### Part 11
The opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> is <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar stated a principle: Anything that is</b> worn <b>beneath the net,</b> a woman <b>may go out</b> into the public domain <b>with it,</b> since a woman will not uncover her hair while in the public domain even to show off an ornament. <b>Anything that is</b> worn <b>over the net,</b> e.g., an ornamental hat, a woman <b>may not go out with it,</b> since there is concern that she will remove it and carry it.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A woman <b>may go out with a <i>sela</i></b> coin <b>that</b> she ties <b>on a wound on her foot. The young girls may go out with strings, and even with</b> wood <b>chips that are in</b> the holes in <b>their ears</b> so that the holes will not seal. Young girls would have their ears pierced, but earrings were not placed in their ears until they were older. Jewish <b>women</b> in <b>Arab</b> countries <b>may go out veiled,</b> with a scarf covering their face, <b>and</b> Jewish <b>women</b> in <b>Media</b> may go out <b>with cloaks fastened</b> with stones. <b>And, any person</b> in any place is permitted to go out on Shabbat clothed in that way; <b>however, the Sages spoke in the present,</b> addressing prevalent situations. A woman <b>may fasten</b> her cloak <b>on a stone</b> by inserting a small stone and wrapping her cloak around it, as she would with a button. <b>And</b> likewise, she may do so <b>on a nut or on a coin, as long as she does not fasten</b> her cloak with them <b>on Shabbat <i>ab initio</i>.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <b><i>tzinit</i></b> with regard to which the mishna taught that a woman may go out with a coin tied to it on Shabbat? The Gemara explains: It is <b>a wound on the sole of her foot.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different about a <i>sela</i>?</b> Why specifically is a coin placed on the wound? <b>If you say that any object that is hard is beneficial for her, make an earthenware</b> shard <b>for her</b> instead. <b>Rather,</b> it is beneficial <b>due to the rust</b> on the coin. If so, <b>make a</b> small silver <b>plate for her.</b> Why specifically a coin? <b>Rather</b> it is beneficial <b>due to the image</b> engraved on the coin. If so, <b>make her an unminted coin</b> and engrave an image on it. <b>Abaye said: Learn from it that all</b> these factors together <b>are beneficial for her.</b>

### Part 15
The mishna taught that <b>the</b> young <b>girls may go out with strings.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>Shmuel’s father did not allow his daughters to go out with strings, and did not allow them to lie next to each other, and he made ritual baths for them in the days of Nisan and mats</b> in the Euphrates River <b>in the days of Tishrei.</b> Since the water was shallow and the riverbed muddy, he placed mats on the riverbed so that they could immerse without getting dirty.

### Part 16
The Gemara analyzes the conduct of Shmuel’s father: <b>He did not allow them to go out with strings. Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>the girls may go out with strings?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> strings with which the <b>daughters of Shmuel’s father</b> went out <b>were colorful ones,</b> and he was concerned that because the strings were beautiful they would come to remove them to show them to others and carry them.

### Part 17
<b>He did not allow them to lie next to one another. Let us say that this supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, as Rav Huna said: Women who rub against one another</b> motivated by sexual desire
