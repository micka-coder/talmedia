### Part 1
on a similar note, <b>Rav Kahana said: Reeds that one tied them</b> into a bundle, <b>require</b> that <b>most</b> of them ignite. If <b>one did not tie them</b> into a bundle, <b>they do not require</b> that <b>most</b> of them ignite, in accordance with the statement of Rav Huna. However, <b>seeds require</b> that <b>most</b> of them ignite. And if <b>he placed them in woven baskets, they do not require</b> that <b>most</b> of them catch fire.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yosef taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Four bonfires do not require</b> that <b>most</b> of the flammable materials catch fire, as their materials burn easily once the fire takes hold of them. And they are: A bonfire <b>of pitch, and of sulfur, and of</b> dry <b>cheese, and of fatty</b> materials. And <b>it was taught in a <i>baraita</i></b>: A bonfire <b>of straw and</b> one <b>of rakings</b> of wood gathered from the field <b>also</b> do not require that most of it catch fire.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yoá¸¥anan said: Babylonian wood does not require</b> that <b>most</b> of it catch fire. <b>Rav Yosef</b> the Babylonian <b>objects: What is that</b> wood that they use in Babylonia that burns so well? <b>If you say</b> that it refers to wood <b>slivers</b> used for burning and light, <b>now</b> that with regard to <b>a wick, Ulla said</b> that <b>one who lights</b> it for a Shabbat lamp <b>must light most of what emerges</b> from the vessel; <b>is it necessary</b> to mention with regard to wood <b>slivers</b> that most of them must be lit? <b>Rather, Rav Yosef said:</b> Certainly the reference is to <b>the branch of</b> a <b>cedar</b> tree. And <b>Rami bar Abba said:</b> The reference here is to a <b>hyssop</b> [<b><i>zaza</i></b>].
