### Part 1
<b>something else,</b> a euphemism for a pig, <b>it is harmful with regard to something else,</b> a euphemism for leprosy.

### Part 2
It was <b>Rav and Shmuel who both said:</b> With regard to <b>one who performs the practice</b> of bloodletting, <b>let him wait a bit and then let him rise, as the Master said:</b> There are <b>five matters</b> that render one <b>closer to death than life, and they are these:</b> If <b>one ate and</b> immediately <b>rose,</b> if <b>one drank and rose,</b> if <b>one slept and</b> immediately <b>rose,</b> if <b>one let blood and rose,</b> if <b>one engaged in</b> conjugal <b>relations and rose.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Shmuel said: The interval for bloodletting</b> is <b>every thirty days. And during the</b> middle <b>periods</b> of one’s life, <b>he should decrease</b> the frequency of bloodletting; <b>and during the</b> later <b>periods, he should decrease</b> its frequency <b>again.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And Shmuel said: The times for bloodletting</b> are <b>the first</b> day <b>of the week, the fourth</b> day of the week <b>and Shabbat eve. However,</b> on the <b>second and the fifth</b> days of the week, <b>no,</b> one should not let blood, <b>as the Master said:</b> Only <b>one who has the merit of</b> his <b>ancestors</b> and relies on it <b>should let blood on</b> the <b>second and on the fifth</b> days of the week, <b>as the court on High,</b> in the heavens, <b>and the court below are equal.</b> The courts in the cities convene on Mondays and Thursdays, as does the heavenly court. Letting blood on a day of judgment is dangerous. If one is judged unfavorably all his blood could flow out.

### Part 5
The Gemara explains: <b>On the third day of the week, what is the reason</b> that one does <b>not</b> let blood? It is <b>because</b> the planet <b>Mars is dominant during the even</b> hours. Since it is a planet of blood, and the even hours are a bad omen, that combination gives cause for concern. The Gemara asks: On <b>Shabbat eve,</b> Mars <b>also dominates during the even</b> hours. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the <b>multitudes have</b> already become <b>accustomed to</b> letting blood on Shabbat eve, the verse: <b>“The Lord protects the simple-hearted”</b> (Psalms 116:6) applies in this case.

### Part 6
Similarly, <b>Shmuel says:</b> On <b>the fourth</b> day of the week that <b>is the fourth day</b> of the month; on <b>the fourth</b> day of the week that <b>is the fourteenth</b> of the month; on <b>the fourth</b> day of the week that <b>is the twenty-fourth</b> of the month; and on <b>the fourth</b> day of the week after which <b>there are not four</b> days remaining in the month <b>it is dangerous</b> to let blood.

### Part 7
Bloodletting on <b>the New Moon and</b> on the <b>second</b> day of the month causes <b>weakness;</b> bloodletting on the <b>third</b> day of the month leads to <b>danger.</b> Bloodletting on <b>the eve of a Festival</b> causes <b>weakness;</b> bloodletting on <b>the eve of the festival of <i>Shavuot</i></b> leads to <b>danger. And the Sages issued a decree</b> prohibiting bloodletting <b>on the eve of every Festival due to the festival</b> of <b><i>Shavuot</i>. On</b> <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>an evil spirit named <i>Tibbuaḥ</i>,</b> from the Hebrew word meaning slaughter, <b>emerges, as had the Jewish people not accepted the Torah</b> on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, <i>Tibbuaḥ</i> <b>would have slaughtered their flesh and their blood.</b> Consequently, it remains a dangerous day.

### Part 8
<b>Shmuel said:</b> If <b>one ate wheat and</b> afterward <b>let blood, he only let that wheat.</b> The bloodletting was ineffective as the wheat replaced any blood that was let. <b>And this</b> ineffectiveness <b>applies</b> only if he let blood <b>to cure</b> an illness; <b>however, to relieve</b> discomfort, bloodletting after eating wheat <b>relieves</b> one’s discomfort.

### Part 9
<b>One who lets blood</b> should engage in <b>drinking immediately;</b> he should not engage in <b>eating until</b> the time that it takes to walk <b>half a <i>mil</i></b> has elapsed.

### Part 10
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: When they said that one should engage in <b>drinking immediately,</b> does that mean that drinking immediately is <b>beneficial; however, thereafter, it is injurious? Or perhaps,</b> thereafter <b>it is neither injurious nor beneficial.</b> No resolution is found for this dilemma, therefore <b>it stands</b> unresolved.

### Part 11
Similarly, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: When they said one should not engage in <b>eating until</b> the time that it takes to walk <b>half a <i>mil</i></b> has elapsed, does that mean <b>that</b> only at that time <b>it is beneficial,</b> however, <b>after that</b> time <b>or before that</b> time <b>it is injurious? Or perhaps,</b> before and after that time <b>it is neither injurious nor beneficial.</b> No resolution is found for this dilemma, therefore <b>it</b> too <b>stands</b> unresolved.

### Part 12
<b>Rav</b> would <b>announce: One hundred bloodlettings for a <i>zuz</i>;</b> cutting the hair on <b>one hundred heads for a <i>zuz</i>;</b> grooming <b>one hundred moustaches</b> does <b>not</b> cost <b>anything</b> (<i>ge’onim</i>). Blood letters typically served as barbers as well and did not charge for grooming a moustache. If one hundred men happened to arrive one day to have their moustaches groomed, the barber would work all day without receiving any pay. <b>Rav Yosef said: When we were</b> students <b>in Rav Huna’s school,</b> on <b>a day when the Sages were sluggish</b> in their studies, <b>they would say: Today is the day of the moustaches, and I did not know what they were saying.</b> Now that I heard Rav’s statement, I understand that they meant that it was a day without purpose.

### Part 13
We learned in the mishna: <b>And one may tie the umbilical cord</b> of a child born on Shabbat. <b>The Sages taught</b> similarly in the <i>Tosefta</i> and even added to it: <b>One may tie the umbilical cord</b> of a child born on Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: One may even cut</b> the umbilical cord. <b>And one may insulate the placenta</b> as a healing remedy <b>so as to warm the newborn. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: Princesses insulate</b> the placenta <b>in mugs of oil; the daughters of the wealthy</b> do so <b>in combed wool; the daughters of the poor in</b> soft <b>rags.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said</b> that <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> that it is even permitted to cut the umbilical cord on Shabbat.

### Part 15
<b>And Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said</b> that <b>Rav said: The Rabbis concede to Rabbi Yosei with regard to the umbilical cord</b> attached to <b>twin babies that one may cut</b> it on Shabbat. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? In that case, leaving the cord attached is dangerous. <b>Since</b> the attached twins will try to <b>disengage from each other,</b> they could potentially rip each other’s cords.

### Part 16
<b>And Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said</b> that <b>Rav said: Everything stated in the passage of rebuke</b> (Ezekiel 16) <b>one may perform for a woman in childbirth on Shabbat.</b> Since that chapter speaks of the dangerous birth of an abandoned child, for all other children, these issues should be addressed. <b>As it is stated</b> there: <b>“And as for your birth, on the day you were born, your navel was not cut, and you were not washed in water for cleansing, and you were not salted, nor were you swaddled”</b> (Ezekiel 16:4).

### Part 17
The Gemara explains: <b>“And as for your birth, on the day you were born”; from here</b> it is derived <b>that one delivers the newborn on Shabbat. “Your navel was not cut”; from here</b> it is derived <b>that one cuts the umbilical cord on Shabbat. “And you were not washed in water for cleansing”; from here</b> it is derived <b>that one washes the newborn on Shabbat. “And you were not salted”; from here</b> it is derived <b>that one salts the newborn on Shabbat. “Nor were you swaddled”; from here</b> it is derived <b>that one swaddles the newborn on Shabbat.</b>
