<b>they kindle it with the majority</b> of the those present at the banquet <b>in mind.</b> When the majority of those present are gentiles, it is permitted.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates that <b>Shmuel happened</b> to come <b>to the house of Avin Toran. A certain gentile came</b> and <b>kindled a lamp. Shmuel turned his face back</b> away from the lamp in order to avoid benefitting from the light. <b>When</b> Shmuel <b>saw</b> that the gentile <b>brought a document and was reading</b> it, <b>he said: He kindled it with his</b> own benefit <b>in mind. He turned his face back toward the lamp.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All vessels may be moved on Shabbat, and their doors,</b> which are part of these vessels, along <b>with them, even if they were dismantled on Shabbat, as</b> the doors of these vessels <b>are unlike the doors of the house.</b> It is prohibited to make use of the doors of a house on Shabbat, even if they were removed from the entrance, <b>because they are not prepared</b> from before Shabbat.

### Part 5
Likewise <b>a person may move a mallet,</b> which is generally used for labor prohibited on Shabbat, <b>to crack nuts with it.</b> Likewise, one may move <b>an axe,</b> a tool generally used to chop wood, <b>to cut a cake of figs with it.</b> So too, one may move <b>a saw to cut cheese with it.</b> Similarly, one may move <b>a spade to scoop dried figs with it.</b>

### Part 6
One may also move <b>a winnowing shovel and a pitchfork,</b> both of which are designated for use with crops in a barn, <b>to place</b> food <b>on it for a child.</b> One is likewise permitted to take a <b>reed or a shuttle</b> from a spindle, ordinarily used for weaving, in order <b>to insert it</b> into food like a fork. One is permitted to move an ordinary <b>hand needle</b> used for sewing clothes <b>to extract a thorn with it, and</b> one may move <b>a sack maker’s</b> needle <b>to open the door with it.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states: <b>All vessels may be moved, and even if they were dismantled on Shabbat.</b> Should we learn from here that there is only a question with regard to vessels which were dismantled on Shabbat, <b>and</b> that <b>there is no need</b> to mention vessels detached <b>during the week,</b> as it is certainly permitted to carry them on Shabbat?

### Part 8
<b>On the contrary,</b> if they were dismantled <b>on Shabbat</b> it can be said that the parts of the vessel <b>were prepared</b> for use at the onset of Shabbat, <b>due to</b> their being attached to <b>their original</b> vessels from which they were removed. However, if they were detached <b>during the week,</b> at the onset of Shabbat they would <b>not</b> have been <b>prepared</b> for use, <b>due to</b> their being detached from <b>their original</b> vessels from which they were removed.

### Part 9
<b>Abaye said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: All vessels may be moved on Shabbat along with their doors. And even if they came apart during the week, they may be moved on Shabbat.</b>

### Part 10
<b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>the door of a chest,</b> or <b>of a box,</b> or <b>of a closet, one may remove</b> them from their hinges on Shabbat, <b>but he may not restore</b> them to their original places. <b>And</b> with regard to the door of <b>a chicken coop,</b> one may neither <b>move</b> it <b>nor restore</b> it to its place.

### Part 11
<b>Granted,</b> in the case of <b>a chicken coop</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>holds: Since</b> the coop <b>is attached to the ground, there is</b> a prohibition against <b>building on the ground</b> and <b>there is</b> a prohibition against <b>dismantling on the ground.</b> Consequently, when one dismantles or restores the door he has performed the prohibited labor of building. <b>However,</b> in the case of the door <b>of a chest,</b> or <b>a box,</b> or <b>a closet, what does he hold?</b>

### Part 12
<b>If</b> the tanna <b>holds</b> that <b>there is</b> a prohibition against <b>building with regard to vessels,</b> then <b>there is</b> also a prohibition against <b>dismantling with regard to vessels</b> and it should be prohibited to remove the door. <b>And if there is no</b> prohibition against <b>dismantling with regard to vessels</b> and it is permitted to remove the door, then there should also be <b>no</b> prohibition against <b>building with regard to vessels.</b> Why, then, is it prohibited to restore a door to its original place?

### Part 13
<b>Abaye said: Actually, he holds that there is</b> a prohibition against <b>building with regard to vessels and there is</b> also a prohibition against <b>dismantling with regard to vessels.</b> To resolve the difficulty, emend the text. Rather than saying: One may remove them, <b>it is saying:</b> The doors of a chest, or a box, or a closet <b>that were</b> already <b>removed</b> may not be restored.

### Part 14
<b>Rava said to him:</b> There are <b>two</b> possible <b>responses</b> with which your statement can be rejected. <b>One</b> is that <b>it is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may remove</b> them, <i>ab initio</i>. <b>And furthermore, what is</b> the meaning of: <b>But one may not restore</b> them? According to your emendation, what is the meaning of the word, but, in this context? <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> holds that <b>there is no</b> prohibition against <b>building with regard to vessels and there is no</b> prohibition against <b>dismantling with regard to vessels, and</b> so why did the <i>tanna</i> rule one may not restore the door? It is due to <b>a decree lest one fix</b> it firmly in place in the manner of a full-fledged prohibited labor, completing the production process of a vessel.

### Part 15
The mishna states: <b>A person may take a mallet</b> on Shabbat in order to crack nuts with it. <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> The type of hammer in this case is <b>a hammer</b> designated <b>for nuts to crack nuts with it, but blacksmiths’</b> hammers, <b>no,</b> they may not be used.

### Part 16
That <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that using <b>an object whose</b> primary <b>function</b> is <b>for</b> a <b>prohibited</b> use, <b>even for the purpose</b> of utilizing the object <b>itself</b> to perform a permitted action, is <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Rabba said to him: But if</b> what you say is <b>so,</b> how do you reconcile this with <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna in which <b>it is taught: And a winnowing shovel or a pitchfork</b> in order <b>to place</b> food <b>for a child on it; are a winnowing shovel and a pitchfork designated for</b> use by <b>a child? Rather, Rabba said:</b> The mishna should be interpreted as follows: One may use <b>a blacksmiths’ hammer</b> on Shabbat <b>to crack nuts with it.</b>

### Part 18
The <i>tanna</i> <b>holds:</b>
