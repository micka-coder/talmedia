### Part 1
<b>it is made</b> merely <b>to align his steps</b> and straighten his posture. He does not completely lean all his weight on it. <b>Here,</b> in the case of a wooden leg, <b>it is made to lean on, and</b> in fact <b>he leans</b> all his weight <b>on it.</b>

### Part 2
It was taught in the mishna that the supports of a <i>zav</i> and his chair <b>are</b> subject to <b>ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading, and one may not go out with them on Shabbat, and one may not enter into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard with them.</b>

### Part 3
<b>The <i>tanna</i>,</b> who recited <i>mishnayot</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan, taught</b> the opposite <i>halakha</i> in the mishna: <b>One may enter into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard with them.</b>

### Part 4
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: I teach that a woman may perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with</b> this support, as it has the legal status of a shoe in every sense, <b>and you say that one may enter</b> the Temple courtyard? <b>Teach</b> the mishna in the following manner: <b>One may not enter into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard with them.</b>

### Part 5
We learned in the mishna that <b><i>loketamin</i> are pure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are <i>loketamin</i>? Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> They are wooden toys in the shape of a <b>donkey</b> one carried <b>on the shoulders,</b> creating the impression that the donkey is riding him. <b>Rava bar Pappa said:</b> They are <b>stilts</b> used to avoid getting dirty when walking in mud or for amusement. <b>Rava bar Rav Huna said: They are masks [<i>peramei</i>].</b>

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Young <b>boys may go out on Shabbat with knots</b> as a folk remedy <b>and princes with bells. And any person</b> is permitted to go out on Shabbat with those objects; <b>however, the Sages spoke in the present,</b> addressing situations that were prevalent.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that young boys may go out on Shabbat with knots. The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> these <b>knots? Adda Mari said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman bar Barukh said</b> that <b>Rav Ashi bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said: They are garlands of</b> the <b>madder</b> plant that are tied for their medicinal qualities.

### Part 8
<b>Abaye said: Mother,</b> actually his foster mother, <b>said to me</b> about the healing properties of madder: <b>Three</b> garlands <b>maintain</b> the illness at its present state and prevent it from worsening, <b>five</b> garlands <b>heal</b> the illness, and <b>seven are effective even against sorcery.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: And that</b> benefit provided by the madder plant <b>is</b> specifically in a case <b>where</b> one on whom the knots were tied <b>does not look at the sun and the moon, and does not see rain, and hears neither the sound of</b> clanging <b>iron, nor the sound of the hen, nor the sound of footsteps. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> If that is the case, the remedial powers of <b>the madder fell in a pit,</b> i.e., if so many conditions exist, for all intents and purposes it provides no benefit at all.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: If these knots in the madder plant have remedial qualities, <b>why specifically</b> were <b>boys</b> mentioned in the mishna? <b>Even girls</b> can benefit from the cure <b>as well.</b> By the same token, <b>why specifically</b> were <b>young</b> boys mentioned in the mishna? <b>Even adults</b> can benefit from the cure <b>as well.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rather, what are</b> these <b>knots? Like that which Avin bar Huna said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said: A son who has longings for his father</b> and has a difficult time leaving him, the father <b>takes a strap from the right shoe and ties it on</b> the boy’s <b>left</b> arm as a talisman to help the child overcome his longings. These feelings are more common in small children and especially in boys for their fathers, as fathers were more involved in raising their sons than they were in raising their daughters. Therefore, the Sages allowed specifically young boys to go out with these knots. With regard to this practice, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: And your mnemonic</b> for where to tie the strap <b>is phylacteries,</b> which are tied by the right hand on the left arm. <b>And the opposite,</b> tying the strap from the left shoe onto his right arm, <b>is dangerous</b> because it will exacerbate his longings.

### Part 12
On the topic of the use of various forms of healing and medicinal practices and their permissibility on Shabbat, the Gemara cites additional statements by that Sage on these topics. <b>Avin bar Huna said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said:</b> With regard to <b>overturning an</b> empty <b>cup</b> in which there had been hot water and placing it <b>on</b> one’s <b>navel</b> for healing purposes <b>on Shabbat,</b> he may <b>well</b> do so.

### Part 13
<b>And Avin bar Huna said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said: It is permissible to smear oil and salt</b> on oneself <b>on Shabbat.</b>

### Part 14
<b>As in this</b> case <b>of Rav Huna,</b> who departed <b>from the house of Rav, and Rav,</b> who departed <b>from the house of Rabbi Ḥiyya, and Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who departed <b>from the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>when they were drunk,</b> the rabbi <b>would bring oil and salt and rub them on the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet and say: Just as this oil is clear, so let the wine of so-and-so, son of so-and-so,</b> his mother, <b>become clear.</b> In other words, let them become sober. <b>And if</b> he could <b>not</b> bring oil and salt, or if they did not work, <b>he would bring the sealing</b> clay <b>of a barrel and soak it in water and say: Just as this sealing</b> clay <b>is clear, so let the wine of so-and-so, son of so-and-so, become clear.</b>

### Part 15
<b>And Avin bar Huna said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said: It is permitted to strangle,</b> i.e., tightly bandage the neck of one whose vertebra was dislocated in order to reset it, <b>on Shabbat.</b>

### Part 16
<b>And Avin bar Huna said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said:</b> With regard to tightly <b>swaddling a baby</b> born <b>on Shabbat</b> in order to align any limbs that may have been dislocated in birth, one may <b>well</b> do so.

### Part 17
There were different versions with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of Avin bar Huna. <b>Rav Pappa taught</b> two <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <b>children</b> in his name <b>and Rav Zevid taught</b> one <i>halakha</i> with regard to a <b>child</b> in his name. The Gemara explains: <b>Rav Pappa taught</b> two <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <b>children, and he taught both of them in</b> the name of <b>Avin bar Huna,</b> i.e., the <i>halakha</i> with regard to knots and the <i>halakha</i> with regard to swaddling. <b>Rav Zevid taught</b> one <i>halakha</i> with regard to a <b>child. The first,</b> with regard to knots, <b>he taught in</b> the name of <b>Avin bar Huna. And this,</b> with regard to swaddling, <b>he taught in</b> the name of <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana, as Rabba bar bar Ḥana said:</b> With regard to tightly <b>swaddling a baby on Shabbat,</b> one may <b>well</b> do so.

### Part 18
The Gemara cites additional statements said by Abaye in the name of the woman who raised him with regard to remedies. <b>Abaye said, Mother said to me: All incantations</b> that are repeated <b>are</b> intoned using <b>the name of the mother</b> of the one requiring the incantation, <b>and all knots</b> tied for the purpose of healing <b>are</b> tied <b>on the left.</b>

### Part 19
<b>And Abaye said, Mother said to me: All incantations</b> for <b>which</b> the number of times they must be intoned <b>is specified,</b> one recites them <b>as they are specified; and those</b> for <b>which</b> the number of times they must be intoned <b>is not specified,</b> one recites them <b>forty-one times.</b>

### Part 20
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may go out with a preservation stone,</b> which prevent miscarriages, <b>on Shabbat. They said in the name of Rabbi Meir</b> that one may go out <b>even with the counterweight of a preservation stone;</b> i.e., a stone or another object that was weighed against and found equivalent to the weight of the preservation stone, which is also effective. <b>And</b> this leniency applies <b>not</b> only to <b>a woman who miscarried</b> in the past and is concerned that she may miscarry again; <b>rather,</b> it applies even to a woman who never miscarried and is concerned <b>lest she miscarry</b> for the first time. <b>And</b> it applies <b>not</b> only to <b>a woman who</b> is aware that she <b>is pregnant; rather,</b> it applies even if a woman suspects that <b>she may become pregnant and miscarry. Rav Yeimar bar Shelamya said in the name of Abaye: And this</b> applies only <b>when</b> he happened upon an object <b>that was</b> found <b>equal</b> to the preservation stone when <b>he weighed</b> it against that stone, not when one alters the object to equal the weight of the preservation stone. <b>Abaye raised a dilemma:</b> With regard to a <b>counterweight to the counterweight,</b> i.e., one who finds an object and determines its weight by weighing it against the counterweight of the preservation stone, <b>what</b> is its legal status? May a woman go out into the public domain with it? The Gemara concludes: <b>Let</b> this dilemma <b>stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 21
<b>And Abaye said, Mother said to me: To</b> heal <b>a fever of one day, let one take a pale,</b> i.e., newly minted, <b>dinar and go to the salt</b> pools, <b>and weigh its weight in salt</b> against it, <b>and let him bind</b> the salt <b>to the opening of the neckline</b> of his garment <b>with a thread</b> made <b>of hair.</b>

### Part 22
<b>And if</b> this remedy is <b>not</b> effective, <b>let him sit at a crossroads, and when he sees a large ant carrying something, he should take</b> the ant <b>and place it in a copper tube, and close it with lead, and seal it with sixty seals, and shake it, and lift it, and say to it: Your burden is upon me and my burden,</b> my fever, <b>is upon you. Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Huna, said to Rav Ashi: And perhaps a</b> different <b>person</b> already <b>found</b> this ant <b>and</b> used <b>this</b> remedy to <b>end</b> his illness. In that case, by accepting the burden of the ant, he is bringing another’s illness upon himself. <b>Rather, let him say to</b> the ant: <b>My burden and your burden are upon you.</b>

### Part 23
<b>And if</b> that remedy is <b>not</b> effective, <b>let him take a new jug, and go to the river, and say to it: River, river, lend me a jug of water for a guest who happened</b> to come <b>to me. And let him turn it around his head seven times, and pour out</b> the water <b>behind him, and say to it: River, river, take</b> back <b>the water that you gave me because the guest who happened</b> to come <b>to me came on its day and left on its day.</b>

### Part 24
<b>Rav Huna said:</b>
