### Part 1
<b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says</b> with regard to an amulet: <b>As long as he does not hold it in his hand and carry it four cubits in the public domain?</b> Apparently, even with regard to an amulet, there is a distinction between wearing it and carrying it.

### Part 2
<b>Rather, with what are we dealing here? With</b> an amulet that is <b>covered in leather.</b> Since the writing itself is covered, the name of God is not degraded when the amulet is brought into the bathroom with him.

### Part 3
The Gemara objects. There is writing on the scrolls of <b>phylacteries, which is covered in</b> the <b>leather</b> of boxes housing the scrolls, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who enters a bathroom</b> while wearing phylacteries <b>must remove</b> the <b>phylacteries at a distance of four cubits and</b> only then <b>enter.</b> There is no halakhic difference whether or not the writing is covered.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this: <b>There,</b> with regard to phylacteries, the prohibition to enter the bathroom is not due to the sacred writing on the scrolls inside the phylacteries. Rather, it is <b>due to the</b> letter <b><i>shin</i></b> that protrudes from the leather of the boxes housing the scroll in the phylacteries of the head, <b>as Abaye said:</b> The source of the requirement of the <b><i>shin</i> of the phylacteries is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b> It is required by Torah law. <b>And, Abaye said:</b> The knot in the shape of the letter <b><i>dalet</i></b> in the straps <b>of the phylacteries</b> of the head <b>is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai. And, Abaye said:</b> The <b>letter <i>yod</i> of the phylacteries is a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai.</b> It is due to those letters that one must safeguard the sanctity of the phylacteries and refrain from taking them into the bathroom.

### Part 5
We learned in the mishna: <b>And</b> he may <b>neither</b> go out <b>with <i>shiryon</i>, nor with a <i>kasda</i>, nor with <i>maggafayim</i>.</b> These terms were not understood, and therefore the Gemara explains them:

### Part 6
<b><i>Shiryon</i></b> is <b>a coat of mail [<i>zerada</i>],</b> armor made of scales. <b><i>Kasda</i>: Rav said</b> that it is <b>a leather hat [<i>sanvarta</i>]</b> worn under a metal helmet. <b><i>Maggafayim</i>: Rav said</b> they are <b>leg armor</b> worn beneath the knee.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A woman may neither go out</b> to the public domain <b>with a perforated needle,</b> i.e., a standard needle with an eye, <b>nor with a ring that has a seal on it, nor with a <i>kulyar</i>, nor with a <i>kovelet</i>,</b> the identity of which will be discussed in the Gemara, <b>nor with a flask of balsam oil.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And if she did go out</b> into the public domain, <b>she is liable to bring a sin-offering;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir,</b> who holds that in doing so she violated the Torah prohibition of carrying a burden in the public domain on Shabbat. <b>And the Rabbis exempt</b> one who goes out on Shabbat <b>with a <i>kovelet</i> and with a flask of balsam oil.</b> In their opinion, these are ornaments, and therefore they do not fundamentally violate the Torah prohibition of carrying in the public domain on Shabbat.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to that which we learned in the mishna that a woman may not go out on Shabbat with a ring that has a seal, and by inference that she may go out with a ring without a seal, <b>Ulla said: And the reverse</b> of <b>these</b> <i>halakhot</i> is true <b>with regard to a man.</b> A man who wears a ring with a seal in the public domain is exempt. However, if he wears a ring without a seal, he is liable to bring a sin-offering as it is not considered an ornament for a man. Based on that statement, the Gemara concludes: <b>Apparently, Ulla holds</b> that <b>every object that is suitable for a man is not suitable for a woman, and an object that is suitable for a woman is not suitable for a man.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rav Yosef raised an objection</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Shepherds may go out</b> on Shabbat <b>in</b> garments made of <b>sacks. And not</b> with regard to <b>the shepherds alone did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that they are permitted to go out in sacks on Shabbat; <b>rather, any person</b> may do so. <b>However,</b> the Sages taught the <i>halakha</i> with regard to shepherds because <b>it is the</b> standard <b>practice of shepherds to go out in sacks.</b> Apparently, although a sack is not a typical garment for most people, it is permitted even for one who is not a shepherd and would not generally wear it. Based on the same principle, although men do not generally wear women’s ornaments and women do not generally wear men’s ornaments, since occasionally a man might wear an ornament belonging to a woman or vice versa, each should be permitted to go out into the public domain with the ornament of the other.

### Part 11
<b>Rather, Rav Yosef said: Ulla holds</b> that <b>women are a people unto themselves.</b> The difference between the standard practice of men and women is greater than the difference between the standard practice of practitioners of different professions.

### Part 12
<b>Abaye raised an objection</b> to Rav Yosef’s statement from the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who finds phylacteries</b> outside of the city on Shabbat <b>should</b> don them and <b>bring them into</b> the city <b>one pair at a time.</b> This applies to <b>both a man and a woman. And if you say</b> that <b>women are a people unto themselves, isn’t</b> the mitzva to don phylacteries <b>a time-bound, positive mitzva,</b> as there are times when the mitzva to don phylacteries is not in effect? <b>And</b> the following is a halakhic principle: <b>Women are exempt from every time-bound, positive mitzva.</b> If, in fact, the clothing and ornaments of a man are not suitable for a woman under any circumstances, why is a woman permitted to don the phylacteries and bring them into the city on Shabbat? Shouldn’t that be considered a prohibited act of carrying?

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to phylacteries, <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>night is an</b> appropriate <b>time</b> to don <b>phylacteries, and Shabbat</b> and Festivals are similarly <b>an</b> appropriate <b>time</b> to don <b>phylacteries.</b> Consequently, the mitzva of phylacteries is <b>a positive mitzva</b> that is <b>not time bound; and</b> in <b>every positive mitzva</b> that is <b>not time bound, women are obligated.</b> Therefore, women are permitted to don the phylacteries and bring them into the city.

### Part 14
With regard to Rabbi Meir’s ruling in the mishna that a woman is liable by Torah law if she goes out into the public domain wearing a ring with a seal, the Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it</b> considered <b>carrying out in a backhanded manner?</b> A ring with a seal is not an ornament for a woman; it is an object like any other. One typically carries objects holding them in his hand. Wearing an object around one’s finger is atypical. There is no Torah prohibition violated when a labor is performed in an atypical manner.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> that <b>we are dealing</b> in the mishna <b>with a woman who is a treasurer</b> for charity. A woman with that occupation typically wears a ring with a seal on her finger in order to perform her job. She does not, though, wear it as an ornament. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: You answered</b> and explained why, in the case of a <b>woman,</b> she would be liable to bring a sin-offering. However, in the case of a <b>man</b> who wore a ring without a seal, <b>what is there to say?</b> Why should he be liable?

### Part 16
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that there is a different reason: <b>Sometimes a person gives his wife a ring that has a seal on it to take it to</b> his house and place it in <b>a box</b> for safekeeping, <b>and,</b> in order to ensure that she does not lose the ring, the woman <b>places it in on her hand,</b> i.e., on her finger, <b>until she reaches the box. And,</b> likewise, <b>sometimes a woman gives her husband a ring that does not have a seal on it to take it to a craftsman to repair it, and</b> the husband <b>places it on his hand,</b> i.e., on his finger, <b>until he reaches the craftsman.</b> The purpose of wearing these rings is not for ornamentation. Nevertheless, it is considered a typical manner of carrying them.

### Part 17
We learned in the mishna: <b>Nor with a <i>kulyar</i>, nor with a <i>kovelet</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> a <b><i>kulyar</i>? Rav said: A brooch</b> with which a woman fastens the collar of her garment. <b><i>Kovelet</i>: Rav said</b> that it is <b>a bundle of fragrant herbs [<i>pilon</i>]. And, similarly, Rav Asi said: A bundle of fragrant herbs.</b>

### Part 18
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A woman may not go out</b> on Shabbat <b>with a bundle of fragrant herbs, and if she did go out she is liable to bring a sin-offering,</b> as she violated a Torah prohibition; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: She may not go out</b> <i>ab initio</i>; <b>however, if she went out, she is exempt. Rabbi Eliezer says: A woman may go out with a bundle of fragrant herbs</b> even <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree? Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>it is a burden.</b> Therefore, one who takes it out into the public domain on Shabbat is liable to bring a sin-offering. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>it is an ornament.</b> Nevertheless, they prohibited going out with it <i>ab initio</i> due to concern <b>lest she remove</b> the bundle of herbs from its place, <b>and show it</b> to others, <b>and come to carry it</b> in the public domain. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer holds: Whose practice is it to place</b> fragrant herbs on herself? <b>A woman whose odor is foul.</b> But <b>a woman whose odor is foul does not remove and show</b> the bundle to others because, by doing so, her odor will be detected, a situation that she would prefer to avoid. <b>And,</b> therefore she <b>will not come to carry it four cubits in the public domain.</b>

### Part 20
This <i>baraita</i> cites the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who permits, even <i>ab initio</i>, going out into the public domain with a bundle of herbs. The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer exempts</b> a woman who goes out on Shabbat <b>with a bundle of herbs and with a flask of balsam oil?</b> With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, exempt means that although it is not prohibited by Torah law, it is prohibited <i>ab initio</i> by rabbinic law.

### Part 21
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.</b> When Rabbi Eliezer made <b>this</b> statement, it was <b>when he was addressing</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Meir.</b> When Rabbi Eliezer made <b>that</b> statement, it was <b>when he was addressing</b> the statement <b>of the Rabbis.</b> To clarify: <b>When he was addressing</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who <b>said</b> that <b>she is liable to bring a sin-offering, he said to him</b> that she is <b>exempt</b> from bringing the sacrifice. <b>When he was addressing</b> the statement of <b>the Rabbis, who said</b> that she is <b>exempt but</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> <i>ab initio</i><b>, he said</b> that it is <b>permitted</b> even <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b>
