### Part 1
The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>cucumber seeds</b> is <b>two</b> seeds because they are large and conspicuous. The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>squash seeds</b> is <b>two</b> seeds. The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>seeds of Egyptian beans</b> is <b>two.</b> The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>a live kosher locust</b> is <b>any amount.</b> For carrying out a <b>dead</b> kosher locust, which is edible, it is the same as any other food, <b>a fig-bulk.</b> The measure that determines liability for carrying out the locust called <b><i>tzipporet keramim</i>, whether dead or alive,</b> is <b>any amount;</b> this is because <b>one stores them for medicinal purposes</b> or as a talisman, which renders even a small quantity significant. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even one who carries out a live non-kosher locust</b> is liable for carrying out <b>any amount,</b> because <b>people store</b> locusts <b>for a child</b> who wants <b>to play with it.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna the measure that determines liability for carrying out garden seeds on Shabbat. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raised a contradiction</b> from what we learned: The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>compost and fine sand</b> on Shabbat is <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to fertilize a cabbage stalk;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis say: Equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to fertilize a</b> single <b>leek.</b> Even a single plant is a significant amount. <b>Rav Pappa said: This</b> smaller measure applies to a case where the seed <b>was</b> already <b>planted</b> and growing. In that case, one carries out manure to fertilize one plant. <b>That</b> larger measure applies to a case where the seed <b>was not</b> yet <b>planted, because a person does not</b> go to the <b>trouble to carry out a single seed for planting.</b>

### Part 3
With regard to what the mishna said about the measure for carrying out <b>cucumber</b> and squash <b>seeds, the Sages taught: One who carries out</b> date <b>pits</b> on Shabbat, <b>if</b> he did so in order <b>to plant,</b> he is liable for carrying out <b>two</b> pits. <b>If</b> he did so in order for the animals <b>to eat,</b> he is liable for carrying out <b>enough to fill a pig’s mouth. And how much is enough to fill a pig’s mouth? One</b> date pit. <b>If</b> he did so in order <b>to burn</b> the pits, the measure that determines liability is <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to cook an easily</b> cooked <b>egg. If</b> he carried them out in order to use them <b>to count,</b> the measure for liability is <b>two</b> pits. <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say</b> the measure for liability is <b>five</b> pits. A person is capable of keeping track of up to five items without help. <b>The Sages taught: One who carries out two hairs from a horse’s tail</b> or <b>from a cow’s tail</b> on Shabbat <b>is liable, since people store them to</b> use in <b>traps.</b> The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>stiff hair of a pig</b> is <b>one</b> hair. It is significant because it is used to sew shoes. The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>palm fronds</b> is <b>two</b> fronds, but the measure for <b>palm vines,</b> which are peeled off the frond and are thinner, is one vine.

### Part 4
We learned in the mishna: With regard to carrying out the locust called <b><i>tzipporet keramim</i>, whether dead or alive,</b> the measure for liability is <b>any amount.</b> This is because one stores them for medicinal purposes or as a talisman, which renders even one locust significant. The Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>tzipporet keramim</i>? Rav said:</b> It is the locust called <b><i>palya biari</i>. Abaye said: And</b> it can be <b>found in a palm tree that</b> has only <b>one vine, and it is used</b> as a talisman <b>for wisdom.</b> One <b>eats its right half,</b> and <b>casts its left half into a copper tube, and seals it with sixty seals, and hangs it on his left arm. And</b> the <b>mnemonic</b> reminding <b>you</b> which half to eat and which half to hang on the arm is the verse: <b>“A wise heart to his right and a foolish heart to his left”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:2). <b>And one</b> then <b>grows wise as much as he wants, and studies as much as he wants, and</b> then <b>eats the other half, as if</b> he does <b>not</b> do so, <b>his learning</b> will <b>be forgotten.</b>

### Part 5
We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even one who carries out</b> a live non-kosher locust is liable for carrying out any amount, because people store locusts for play. The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> the <b>first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that people do <b>not</b> give children non-kosher locusts for play. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Due to the concern that <b>perhaps</b> the child <b>will eat it.</b> And the Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> it should <b>also</b> be prohibited to give a child a <b>kosher locust,</b> lest the child will eat it, <b>as</b> the Gemara related <b>that Rav Kahana stood before Rav and passed a</b> live <b>kosher locust near his mouth.</b> Rav <b>said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>Put it down,</b> so that <b>people will not</b> mistakenly <b>say: He is eating it and violating</b> the prohibition <b>of “You shall not make yourselves detestable”</b> (Leviticus 11:43). Apparently, eating a kosher locust is prohibited while it is alive. <b>Rather,</b> even according to the unattributed mishna, there is no room for concern that a young child will eat a locust with which he is playing. The reason that the first <i>tanna</i> prohibits giving a non-kosher locust to a child for play is the concern that <b>perhaps it will die and he will eat it. And Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who permits giving a non-kosher locust to a child for play, does not share that concern. <b>If</b> the locust <b>dies,</b> the <b>child will eulogize it</b> and mourn its death, and certainly would not eat it.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who stores</b> a seed <b>for sowing, or as a sample, or for medicinal purposes and carried it out on Shabbat is liable</b> for carrying out <b>any amount.</b> By storing that measure, he indicates that it is significant to him. Therefore, he is liable for carrying it, despite the fact that what he carried out is less than the halakhic measure that determines liability for that item. <b>And any</b> other <b>person is only liable</b> for carrying it out on Shabbat <b>if</b> he carries out <b>its measure</b> for liability. If one stored the seed, carried it out, <b>and then brought it back in,</b> with no intention to utilize it for the specific purpose for which he stored it, <b>he is only liable if</b> he brought in <b>its measure</b> for liability (Rav Shmuel Strashun).

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why does</b> the mishna <b>teach: One who stores</b> a seed for a specific purpose and carried it out? <b>Let</b> the mishna simply <b>teach: One who carries out</b> a seed <b>for planting, or as a sample, or for medicinal purposes is liable</b> for carrying out <b>any amount.</b> One is not liable for storing the seed. He is liable for carrying out less than the measure that determines liability because he attributed significance to that measure. <b>Abaye said: With what we are dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where one stored it</b> for a specific purpose <b>and forgot why he stored it, and now he carries it out</b> for <b>no</b> specific <b>purpose.</b>
