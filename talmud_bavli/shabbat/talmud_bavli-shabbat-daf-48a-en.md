### Part 1
<b>causing heat to rise,</b> i.e., heating food that is not actually insulated in it, but merely resting upon it, the residue <b>of olives causes heat to rise.</b> Therefore, it is prohibited even to place cooked food upon it. However, the residue <b>of sesame does not cause heat to rise</b> to that extent. Therefore, it is permitted to place food upon it.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates an anecdote somewhat relevant to the previous discussion: <b>Rabba and Rabbi Zeira happened</b> to come <b>to the house of the Exilarch</b> on Shabbat, and <b>saw this servant who placed a jug [<i>kuza</i>] of</b> cold <b>water on the mouth of a kettle</b> filled with hot water. <b>Rabba rebuked him</b> for having acted contrary to the <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rabbi Zeira said to</b> Rabba: <b>How is</b> this case <b>different</b> from placing <b>an urn on top of</b> another <b>urn,</b> which is permitted on Shabbat? Rabba <b>said to him: There,</b> when he places one urn on top of another urn, <b>he</b> merely <b>preserves</b> the heat in the upper urn; therefore, it is permitted. <b>Here,</b> in the case where he places the jug of cold water on the mouth of a kettle, <b>he is generating</b> heat in the water in the upper vessel; therefore, it is prohibited.

### Part 3
The Gemara continues: Rabba <b>then saw</b> that same servant <b>spread a kerchief [<i>dastodar</i>] over a vat</b> of water <b>and place a cup</b> used to draw water from the vat, <b>on</b> the kerchief. Once again, <b>Rabba rebuked him</b> for having acted improperly. <b>Rabbi Zeira said to him: Why</b> did you rebuke him? Rabba <b>said to him: Now, see</b> what will happen. <b>Ultimately, he saw that</b> the servant <b>was squeezing</b> out the water that was absorbed by the kerchief, thereby violating a Torah prohibition. Nevertheless, Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: How is this</b> case <b>different from</b> that of a <b>cloth [<i>parvanka</i>],</b> which one is permitted to spread over a vat even on Shabbat? Rabba <b>said to him:</b> There is a distinction between the two cases: <b>There,</b> in the case of the cloth, <b>he is not particular about it;</b> even if it gets wet, he will not come to squeeze it dry. <b>Here,</b> with regard to the kerchief, <b>he is particular about it,</b> and he will wring it so that it will not remain wet.

### Part 4
We learned in the mishna: <b>And</b> one may <b>neither</b> insulate a pot <b>in straw</b>, nor in the residue of grapes that were pressed for their juice, nor in soft material. <b>Rav Adda bar Mattana raised a dilemma before Abaye:</b> With regard to swatches of <b>soft material in which he insulated</b> a pot, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to moving</b> that material <b>on Shabbat?</b> Ordinarily, swatches of materials of that kind are set-aside because they have no use. Therefore, moving them on Shabbat is prohibited. Do we say that since they are now being used to insulate a pot, they assume the legal status of a utensil, which may be moved on Shabbat?

### Part 5
Abaye <b>said to him:</b> Just <b>because he does not</b> now <b>have a basket of straw</b> in which to insulate his food, <b>does he stand up and renounce his basket of soft material?</b> Obviously, he would have preferred to insulate his food in straw, as it is less expensive. The only reason that he used that material was because there was no straw available at the time. However, he does not want the swatches of material to be used for any other purpose, lest it be ruined. Therefore, it remains set-aside.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports him: One may insulate</b> a pot of food on Friday afternoon <b>in woolen fleece, in combed wool, in tabs of</b> wool dyed <b>purple, and in</b> swatches of <b>soft material; however, he may not move them.</b> Apparently, this is in accordance with the opinion of Abaye.

### Part 7
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>If that is the reason, there is no</b> conclusive <b>argument,</b> as <b>it is saying</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>as follows: If,</b> however, <b>he did not insulate</b> a pot <b>in them, he may not move them</b> on Shabbat. In that case, they remain earmarked for their own purpose and are therefore set-aside [<i>muktze</i>].

### Part 8
The Gemara questions this last assertion: <b>If so, what</b> is the reason <b>to say</b> that? Obviously, those materials are set-aside. The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that all these materials <b>are suitable</b> for one <b>to sit on them,</b> and, consequently, their legal status is that of utensils, which may be moved. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so, and they may not be moved due to the prohibition of set-aside.

### Part 9
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ḥisda permitted returning stuffing to the pillow</b> from which it had fallen <b>on Shabbat. Rav Ḥanan bar Ḥisda raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may untie the neck opening</b> of a shirt <b>on Shabbat</b> if it had been tied by the launderer; <b>however, one may not open</b> a new neck opening for the first time on Shabbat. <b>And one may not place soft material into a pillow or into a cushion on a Festival, and, needless to say,</b> one may not do so <b>on Shabbat.</b> This <i>baraita</i> contradicts the ruling issued by Rav Ḥisda.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>new</b> pillows, whereas <b>that,</b> the statement of Rav Ḥisda is referring to <b>old</b> pillows. Stuffing a pillow for the first time on Shabbat is prohibited because by so doing one fashions a new utensil. However, if the stuffing fell out of the pillow, refilling the pillow is permitted even on Shabbat.

### Part 11
The Gemara notes: <b>That</b> opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not place soft material</b> as stuffing <b>into a pillow or into a cushion on a Festival, and needless to say</b> one may not do so <b>on Shabbat.</b> However, if the stuffing <b>fell out, it may be replaced</b> even <b>on Shabbat, and needless to say</b> that doing so is permitted <b>on a Festival.</b>

### Part 12
Having raised the issue of opening a collar, the Gemara cites that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: One who opens</b> a new <b>neck opening</b> in a shirt <b>on Shabbat,</b> by cutting through the fabric and threads that kept it closed, <b>is liable to bring a sin-offering.</b> By creating the opening, he renders the shirt fit to wear, thereby fashioning a utensil on Shabbat.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Kahana strongly objects to this:</b>
