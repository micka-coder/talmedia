### Part 1
<b>if you do not permit him</b> to move the corpse in an atypical manner, <b>he will come to extinguish</b> the fire. The Sages permitted performing an act prohibited by rabbinic law so that one will not come to transgress a Torah prohibition. <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Sheila said</b> that <b>Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Lakish with regard to</b> the issue of rescuing <b>a corpse</b> from a fire.

### Part 2
We learned in the mishna that <b>one may not make use of</b> the oil that drips from the candle on Shabbat <b>because it is not among</b> the oil <b>prepared</b> from Shabbat eve for use on Shabbat. With regard to this same issue, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The remaining oil that is in the lamp or in a bowl</b> in which a wick was burning <b>is prohibited</b> for use on Shabbat. However, <b>Rabbi Shimon permits</b> using the remaining oil as, according to his opinion, there is virtually nothing prohibited due to the prohibition of set-aside.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The dispute in this mishna seems to be a local one; however, it is the key to several <i>halakhot</i> in the area of the prohibition of set-aside [<i>muktze</i>]. <b>One may move a new</b> oil <b>lamp</b> on Shabbat <b>but not</b> an <b>old</b> one that was already used. A lamp that was used is covered with soot and unsuitable for use. It is therefore considered set aside from use due to its disgusting nature. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: All</b> oil <b>lamps may be moved</b> on Shabbat <b>except for an</b> oil <b>lamp</b> that is <b>burning on Shabbat,</b> due to the concern that it might be extinguished.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> the dispute in the mishna in greater detail in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One may move a new</b> oil <b>lamp</b> on Shabbat <b>but not an old one;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says: All</b> oil <b>lamps may be moved</b> on Shabbat <b>except for an</b> oil <b>lamp that they kindled on</b> that <b>Shabbat.</b> Rabbi Meir does not hold that one must distance himself from objects that are disgusting. However, since the lamp was burning on Shabbat, it may not be moved, as it is an object set aside due to prohibition for the entire Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> All lamps may be moved <b>except for an</b> oil <b>lamp</b> that is <b>burning on Shabbat.</b> If the flame <b>was extinguished, one is permitted to move it. However, a cup and a bowl and a lantern</b> that are full of oil with a wick lit in them, <b>one may not move them from their place</b> even after the flame is extinguished. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: One may supply</b> himself with oil <b>from an extinguished candle and from the oil that drips</b> from the lamp, <b>and even while the lamp is burning.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Abaye said: Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon, holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>his father in one</b> matter <b>and disagrees with him in one</b> matter. <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>his father in one</b> matter, <b>as he is not</b> of the opinion that moving <b>set-aside</b> objects is prohibited. <b>And he disagrees with him in one</b> matter; <b>as his father holds</b> that <b>if</b> the flame <b>was extinguished, yes,</b> he may move it, if <b>it was not extinguished, no,</b> he may not move it. <b>And</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>holds: Even though</b> the flame <b>was not extinguished,</b> it is permitted to carry the lamp and to use the oil that drips from it. In his opinion, doing so in no way extinguishes the flame and it is in no way comparable to extinguishing the flame.

### Part 6
Following Rabbi Shimon’s statement, it was taught in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>However, a cup, and a bowl, and a lantern, one may not move them from their place.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different about these,</b> that even Rabbi Shimon prohibits moving them? <b>Ulla said:</b> In <b>the latter clause</b> of this <i>Tosefta</i>, <b>we came</b> back <b>to</b> explain the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who prohibits moving items that are set-aside.

### Part 7
<b>Mar Zutra strongly objects to</b> Ulla’s explanation: <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning of the word <b>however</b> in the phrase: <b>However,</b> a cup and a bowl, etc.? Rabbi Yehuda prohibited moving an oil lamp as well. In what way could the legal status of a bowl be any different? <b>Rather, Mar Zutra said: Actually,</b> this must be explained differently. That phrase was stated by <b>Rabbi Shimon. And when Rabbi Shimon permitted</b> moving a lamp, that was <b>in</b> the case of <b>a small lamp, which he has in mind,</b> i.e., he is certain that the flame will be extinguished on Shabbat and that he will have the opportunity to use the remaining oil that day. <b>However, these,</b> the bowl and the lantern, <b>which have much</b> oil, <b>no,</b> he does not expect them to be extinguished and he sets them aside from use for the entire Shabbat.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Using <b>the remaining oil that is in an</b> oil <b>lamp or in a bowl is prohibited</b> on Shabbat, <b>and Rabbi Shimon permits</b> using it. Apparently, Rabbi Shimon does not distinguish between a candle and a bowl. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> where Rabbi Shimon permitted <b>a bowl,</b> was specifically in a case where it is <b>similar to a lamp,</b> i.e., a small bowl in which the flame will quickly extinguish. <b>Here,</b> where Rabbi Shimon prohibited using the oil remaining in a bowl, it is referring to <b>a bowl that is similar to a cup,</b> which is large.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: A</b> metal <b>candlestick [<i>pamot</i>] that was kindled on Shabbat, according to</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>who permits</b> moving a lamp, <b>it is prohibited</b> because it is large. Whereas, <b>according to</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>who prohibits</b> moving a lamp, a metal candlestick <b>is permitted</b> because it does not become disgusting (Rabbeinu Ḥananel). The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda is of</b> the opinion that an object that is <b>set-aside [<i>muktze</i>] due to repugnance</b> may not be moved, and <b>he is not of</b> the opinion that an object that is <b>set-aside due to prohibition</b> may not be moved, and therefore permits moving the candlestick? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: All metal candlesticks may be moved</b> on Shabbat <b>with the exception of a candlestick that was kindled on Shabbat</b> itself? Apparently, he prohibits moving the metal candlestick, not because it is disgusting but because it is set-aside due to prohibition. <b>Rather, if it was stated, it was stated as follows, Rabbi Zeira said: A</b> metal <b>candlestick that was kindled on Shabbat, everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is prohibited.</b> One that <b>was not kindled</b> on Shabbat, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is permitted</b> because it is neither set aside due to prohibition nor set aside due to repugnance.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: A bed which one designated to</b> place <b>money</b> upon it <b>may not be moved</b> on Shabbat because it is set-aside. It is prohibited even though it no longer has money upon it. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak raised an objection to</b> Rav Yehuda from our mishna: <b>One may move a new</b> oil <b>lamp</b> on Shabbat <b>but not</b> an <b>old</b> one.
