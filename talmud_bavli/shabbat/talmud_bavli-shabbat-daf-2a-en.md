### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The acts of <b>carrying out</b> from a public domain into a private domain or vice versa, which are prohibited <b>on Shabbat,</b> are primarily <b>two</b> basic actions <b>that comprise four</b> cases from the perspective of a person <b>inside</b> a private domain, <b>and two</b> basic actions <b>that comprise four</b> cases from the perspective of a person <b>outside,</b> in a public domain.

### Part 2
The mishna elaborates: <b>How</b> do these eight cases take place? In order to answer that question, the mishna cites cases involving a poor person and a homeowner.

### Part 3
<b>The poor</b> person <b>stands outside,</b> in the public domain, <b>and the homeowner stands inside,</b> in the private domain. <b>The poor person</b> lifted an object in the public domain, <b>extended his hand into</b> the private domain, <b>and placed</b> the object <b>into the hand of the homeowner.</b> In that case, the poor person performed the prohibited labor of carrying from the public domain into the private domain in its entirety. <b>Or,</b> the poor person reached his hand into the private domain, <b>took</b> an item from the hand of the homeowner, <b>and carried</b> it <b>out</b> into the public domain. In that case, the poor person performed the prohibited labor of carrying out from the private domain into the public domain in its entirety. In both of these cases, because <b>the poor person</b> performed the prohibited labor in its entirety, he <b>is liable and the homeowner is exempt.</b>

### Part 4
The mishna cites two additional cases. In these, the prohibited labor is performed by the homeowner, who is in the private domain: <b>The homeowner</b> lifted an item in the private domain, <b>extended his hand into</b> the public domain, <b>and placed</b> the object <b>into the hand of the poor person.</b> In that case, the homeowner performed the labor of carrying out from the private domain into the public domain in its entirety. <b>Or,</b> the homeowner reached his hand into the public domain, <b>took</b> an object <b>from</b> the hand of the poor person, <b>and carried</b> it <b>into</b> the private domain. In that case, the homeowner performed the labor of carrying from the public domain into the private domain in its entirety. In both of those cases, because <b>the homeowner</b> performed the prohibited labor in its entirety, he <b>is liable and the poor person is exempt.</b>

### Part 5
There are four additional cases where neither the homeowner nor the poor person performed the labor in its entirety, and therefore neither is liable: <b>The poor person extended his hand into</b> the private domain <b>and</b> either <b>the homeowner took</b> an object <b>from</b> his hand and placed it in the private domain <b>or</b> the homeowner <b>placed</b> an object <b>into</b> the hand of the poor person, and the poor person <b>carried</b> the object <b>out</b> into the public domain. In those cases and the two that follow, the act of transferring the object from one domain to another was performed jointly by two people, the poor person and the homeowner. Because each performed only part of the prohibited labor, <b>both of them are exempt.</b>

### Part 6
So too, in a case where <b>the homeowner extended his hand into the public domain and,</b> either <b>the poor person took</b> an object <b>from</b> the homeowner’s hand and placed it in the public domain <b>or the poor person placed</b> an object <b>into</b> the homeowner’s hand and the homeowner <b>carried</b> the object <b>into</b> the private domain. Because each performed only part of the prohibited labor, <b>both of them are exempt.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in our mishna: The acts of carrying out on Shabbat are two that comprise four. Similarly, <b>we learned</b> in the mishna <b>there,</b> in tractate <i>Shevuot</i>: <b>Oaths</b> on a statement, which, when violated, render one liable to bring a sin-offering <b>are two that comprise four.</b> The first two cases, which are mentioned explicitly in the Torah, are: One who swore that he would perform a specific action in the future and one who swore to refrain from performing said action. Based on an amplification in the language of the Torah, two more cases are added: One who swore that he performed a specific action in the past and one who swore that he did not perform said action.
