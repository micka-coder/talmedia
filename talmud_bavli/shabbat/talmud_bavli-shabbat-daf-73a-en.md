### Part 1
<b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> that the <b>first</b> clause of the <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with</b> the contrast between Shabbat and <b>idolatry, and the latter</b> clause of the <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with</b> contrasting Shabbat and <b>other mitzvot? And what are the circumstances</b> of: <b>Unwitting without intent, with</b> regard to <b>other mitzvot?</b> It is in a case <b>where</b> one <b>thought</b> that it <b>was</b> permitted <b>fat, and ate it,</b> and later discovered that it was forbidden fat. This is one example of other mitzvot where one is liable. <b>That is not</b> the case <b>with</b> regard to <b>Shabbat, where</b> he <b>is exempt, as</b> one who <b>intended to cut</b> a <b>detached</b> plant <b>and</b> unwittingly <b>severed</b> a plant still <b>attached</b> to the ground is <b>exempt. And</b> according to <b>Abaye</b>, who holds that he is liable in that case, <b>what are the circumstances</b> of: <b>Unwitting without intent,</b> with regard to other mitzvot? It is in a case <b>where</b> one had something in his mouth and <b>he thought it was spittle and swallowed it</b> with no intention to eat it, and it turned out to be forbidden fat that he swallowed. This is one example of other mitzvot, where he is liable. <b>That is not</b> the case <b>with</b> regard to <b>Shabbat,</b> where the phrase: He is <b>exempt,</b> is referring to the case of <b>one who intended to lift</b> a plant <b>detached</b> from the ground <b>and</b> mistakenly <b>severed</b> a plant still <b>attached</b> to the ground. In that case, even Abaye agrees that <b>he is exempt. However,</b> one who <b>intended to cut</b> a <b>detached</b> plant <b>and</b> unwittingly <b>severed</b> a plant still <b>attached</b> to the ground <b>is liable</b> since he intended to perform a standard act of cutting. Therefore, no proof can be cited from this <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 2
A similar dispute between Abaye and Rava <b>was stated.</b> In the case of <b>one who intended to throw</b> an object <b>two</b> cubits in the public domain, for which he would not be liable by Torah law, <b>and</b> it turned out that <b>he threw</b> it <b>four</b> cubits, in violation of the prohibition by Torah law against carrying an object four cubits in the public domain, <b>Rava said:</b> He is <b>exempt. Abaye said:</b> He is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rava said:</b> He is <b>exempt, as he does not intend</b> to execute <b>a throw</b> of <b>four</b> cubits, and, consequently, does not intend to perform a prohibited act. <b>Abaye said:</b> He is <b>liable, as he intends</b> to execute <b>a standard throw,</b> and ultimately a throw that traveled a prohibited distance was executed. Another dispute between them was stated. In the case of <b>one who thought</b> that he was in <b>the private domain</b> and threw an object more than four cubits, <b>and,</b> ultimately, <b>it was found</b> to be <b>the public domain, Rava said:</b> He is <b>exempt. And Abaye said:</b> He is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rava said:</b> He is <b>exempt,</b> as <b>he does not intend</b> to execute <b>a prohibited throw.</b> In a private domain, he may throw an object as far as he chooses. <b>And Abaye said:</b> He is <b>liable, as he intends</b> to execute <b>a standard throw.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: <b>And it is necessary</b> to mention these three disputes, despite their similarities, because each one teaches a unique element. <b>As, had</b> the Gemara <b>taught us</b> only <b>the first,</b> the case of one who intended to lift a plant detached from the ground and mistakenly severed a plant still attached to the ground, we would have said that it was only <b>in that</b> case that <b>Rava said</b> he is exempt, <b>as he does not intend</b> to perform an act of <b>prohibited severing.</b> He had no intention to perform an action that entails desecration of Shabbat. <b>However,</b> the ruling in the case of <b>one who intended to throw</b> an object <b>two</b> cubits in the public domain <b>and he threw</b> it <b>four</b> cubits would be more stringent, <b>as</b> an object <b>cannot be thrown four</b> cubits <b>without</b> being thrown <b>two cubits.</b> A throw of two cubits is a component part of the four-cubit throw. Consequently, <b>say</b> that in that case Rava <b>agrees with Abaye,</b> as he performed an act that has a prohibited dimension to it. <b>And, had</b> the Gemara <b>taught us</b> the dispute in <b>this</b> case of throwing two cubits as well, we would have said that it is only <b>in that</b> case that <b>Rava says</b> that he is exempt, <b>as he does not intend</b> to execute <b>a throw of four</b> cubits. A throw of fewer than four cubits does not constitute a transgression. <b>However,</b> in the case of <b>one who thought</b> that he was in <b>the private domain, and</b> ultimately <b>it was found</b> to be <b>the public domain where the individual intends</b> to execute <b>a throw</b> of <b>four</b> cubits, which is a prohibited distance, <b>say</b> that Rava <b>agrees with Abaye</b> that he is liable. Therefore, <b>it is necessary</b> to mention all three cases in which they disagree.

### Part 4
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna: <b>The primary categories of labor are forty-less-one, and we discussed it</b> and asked: <b>Why do I need</b> this <b>tally</b> of forty-less-one? <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The tally was included to teach <b>that if one performed all of</b> the prohibited labors <b>in</b> the course of <b>one lapse of awareness</b> during which he was unaware of the prohibition involved, <b>he is liable for each and every one. Granted,</b> according <b>to Abaye, who said that in a</b> case <b>like that</b> one mentioned above, where one intended to throw an object two cubits and it traveled four cubits <b>he is liable, you find that</b> circumstance in a case where <b>he was aware that the prohibition of Shabbat</b> applies to certain labors, <b>and he was aware</b> that particular <b>labors were prohibited, and was mistaken with regard to measures.</b> He intended to perform an act involving less than the prohibited measure, and it turned out that the action he performed involved an amount equal to or greater than the prohibited measure. That is an unwitting act that renders him liable to bring a sin-offering, according to Abaye. <b>However, according to Rava, who said</b> that <b>he is exempt</b> in a case where one intended to throw an object two cubits and it traveled four cubits, in <b>what</b> circumstances <b>do you find that</b> he would be liable for each and every one? Is it in a case where, with regard to <b>Shabbat,</b> his actions were <b>intentional, and,</b> with regard to the <b>prohibited labors,</b> his actions were <b>unwitting?</b>

### Part 5
It works out <b>well if he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said: Once he was unwitting with regard to</b> the fact that the punishment for his transgression is <b><i>karet</i>, even though he</b> was aware that his action was in violation of a Torah <b>prohibition</b> and performed the transgression <b>intentionally,</b> he is considered to have sinned unwittingly. If he holds in accordance with that opinion, <b>you find</b> a case where one could be liable for each and every prohibited labor <b>when he was aware that</b> performing labor on <b>Shabbat</b> involves violation of a Torah <b>prohibition,</b> but he was unaware that the punishment for violating that prohibition is <i>karet</i>. <b>However, if he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> who <b>said:</b> It is not considered unwitting <b>until he was unwitting with regard to</b> both the <b>prohibition and <i>karet</i>,</b> the result is that he is completely unaware of all the prohibited labors of Shabbat. The question then arises: With regard <b>to what</b> aspect of Shabbat was he aware? If he was completely unaware of all the labors prohibited on Shabbat, in what sense were his actions intentional with regard to Shabbat? The Gemara answers: <b>He was aware</b> of the <i>halakhot</i> of the prohibition of <b>Shabbat boundaries, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who holds that this prohibition is by Torah law.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> This fundamental mishna enumerates those who perform the <b>primary categories of labor</b> prohibited on Shabbat, which number <b>forty-less-one.</b> They are grouped in accordance with their function: <b>One who sows, and one who plows, and one who reaps, and one who gathers</b> sheaves into a pile, <b>and one who threshes,</b> removing the kernel from the husk, <b>and one who winnows</b> threshed grain in the wind, and <b>one who selects</b> the inedible waste from the edible, and <b>one who grinds, and one who sifts</b> the flour in a sieve, <b>and one who kneads</b> dough, <b>and one who bakes.</b>

### Part 7
Additional primary categories of prohibited labor are the following: <b>One who shears wool,</b> and <b>one who whitens it, and one who combs</b> the fleece and straightens <b>it, and one who dyes it, and one who spins</b> the wool, <b>and one who stretches</b> the threads of the warp in the loom, <b>and one who constructs two meshes,</b> tying the threads of the warp to the base of the loom, <b>and one who weaves two threads, and one who severs two threads</b> for constructive purposes, and <b>one who ties</b> a knot, <b>and one who unties</b> a knot, <b>and one who sews two stitches</b> with a needle, as well as <b>one who tears</b> a fabric <b>in order to sew two stitches.</b>

### Part 8
<b>One who traps a deer,</b> or any living creature, and <b>one who slaughters it, and one who flays it,</b> and <b>one who salts its</b> hide, a step in the tanning process, <b>and one who tans its hide, and one who smooths it,</b> removing hairs and veins, <b>and one who cuts it</b> into measured parts.

### Part 9
<b>One who writes two letters and one who erases in order to write two letters. One who builds</b> a structure, <b>and one who dismantles</b> it, <b>one who extinguishes</b> a fire, <b>and one who kindles</b> a fire. <b>One who strikes</b> a blow <b>with a hammer</b> to complete the production process of a vessel (Rabbeinu Ḥananel), and <b>one who carries out</b> an object <b>from domain to domain.</b> All <b>these are primary categories of labor,</b> and they number <b>forty-less-one.</b>
