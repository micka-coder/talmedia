<b>his hand on the shoulder of another, and the other’s hand on his shoulder, and suspends</b> the lamb <b>and flays</b> its hide.

### Part 2
The source for the <b>thick end</b> of a bolt is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>a bolt</b> used in a door lock <b>which has a thick end at the head</b> of the bolt, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: One may drag it from this doorway and hang it in another</b> doorway <b>on Shabbat,</b> but he may not move it with his hands, because it was considered to be set-aside. <b>Rabbi Tarfon says: It is like all the</b> other <b>utensils and may be moved in a courtyard.</b>

### Part 3
The case of <b>a mortar</b> is <b>that which we said</b> above. <b>Rabba said: From what</b> does that conclusion ensue? <b>Perhaps, actually I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that these <i>mishnayot</i> <b>were taught after permission</b> to move <b>utensils</b> on Shabbat was adopted, and nevertheless, the prohibitions can be understood. With regard to the <b>rods</b> for the showbread, <b>what is the reason</b> that they are used? They are used <b>due to concern</b> that the bread will <b>decay. In that brief</b> period until the conclusion of Shabbat <b>it will not decay.</b> With regard to <b>poles,</b> why may they not be used on Passover eve? It is prohibited because <b>it is possible</b> to flay the lamb <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b> Use of the pole is superfluous, and therefore it is set-aside.

### Part 4
In the case of <b>the thick end</b> of the bolt in the door, why was it prohibited to move it by hand? It was prohibited <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yanai, as Rabbi Yanai says: We are dealing with a courtyard</b> for which a joining of courtyards [<i>eiruv</i>] was not established. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua holds</b> that <b>inside the doorway is</b> considered to be <b>like inside</b> the house, <b>and</b> therefore, <b>he is moving utensils</b> of the <b>houses in the courtyard.</b> Since there is no joining of the courtyards, one may not move a vessel from the house to the courtyard. <b>And Rabbi Tarfon holds</b> that <b>inside the doorway is</b> considered to be <b>like outside</b> the house, <b>and therefore, he is moving utensils</b> of the <b>courtyard in the courtyard,</b> which is permitted.

### Part 5
With regard to <b>a mortar,</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya,</b> who holds that a vessel may only be moved on Shabbat for the purpose of its designated use.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All vessels may be moved for a</b> specific <b>purpose and not for a</b> specific <b>purpose. Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> Vessels <b>may only be moved for a</b> specific <b>purpose.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>For a</b> specific <b>purpose, and what is</b> the meaning of: <b>Not for a</b> specific <b>purpose?</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabba said: For a</b> specific <b>purpose</b> means: Moving <b>an object whose</b> primary <b>function</b> is <b>for</b> a <b>permitted</b> use <b>for the purpose of</b> utilizing the object <b>itself. Not for a</b> specific <b>purpose</b> means: Moving <b>an object whose</b> primary <b>function</b> is <b>for</b> a <b>permitted</b> use <b>for the purpose of</b> utilizing <b>its place. And</b> an object <b>whose</b> primary <b>function</b> is <b>for</b> a <b>prohibited</b> use, <b>for the purpose of</b> utilizing the object <b>itself, yes,</b> it is permitted; <b>for the purpose of</b> utilizing <b>its place, no,</b> it is prohibited. <b>And Rabbi Neḥemya came to say: And even an object whose</b> primary <b>function</b> is <b>for</b> a <b>permitted</b> use, moving it <b>for the purpose of</b> utilizing the object <b>itself, yes; for the purpose of</b> utilizing <b>its place, no. Rava said to him: Do you call for the purpose of</b> utilizing <b>its place, not for a</b> specific <b>purpose?</b> It is for a purpose.

### Part 9
<b>Rather, Rava said: For a</b> specific <b>purpose</b> means: Moving <b>an object whose</b> primary <b>function</b> is <b>for</b> a <b>permitted</b> use <b>both for the purpose of</b> utilizing the object <b>itself and for the purpose of</b> utilizing <b>its place. Not for a</b> specific <b>purpose</b> means: Moving it <b>even from the sun to the shade. And an object whose</b> primary <b>function</b> is <b>for</b> a <b>prohibited</b> use, <b>both for the purpose of</b> utilizing the object <b>itself and for the purpose of</b> utilizing <b>its place, yes,</b> it is permitted; moving it <b>from the sun to the shade, no,</b> it is prohibited. <b>And Rabbi Neḥemya came to say: Even an object whose</b> primary <b>function</b> is <b>for</b> a <b>permitted</b> use, moving it <b>for the purpose of</b> utilizing the object <b>itself and for the purpose of</b> utilizing <b>its place, yes,</b> it is permitted; moving it <b>from the sun to the shade, no,</b> it is prohibited.

### Part 10
It is told that <b>Rav Safra and Rav Aḥa bar Huna and Rav Huna bar Ḥanina sat</b> together <b>and they sat and they said: According to Rabba’s</b> explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya</b> that it is prohibited to move an object whose primary function is for a permitted use for the purpose of utilizing its place, <b>these</b> empty <b>bowls, how do we carry</b> them? <b>Rav Safra said to them:</b> You may move them, <b>just as is</b> the case of a <b>chamber pot</b> containing waste that may be moved because it is disgusting.

### Part 11
<b>Abaye said</b> this same matter <b>to Rabba: According to the Master’s</b> explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya, these</b> empty <b>bowls, how do we carry</b> them? He <b>said to him: Our colleague Rav Safra interpreted it: Just as is</b> the case of a <b>chamber pot.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Abaye raised an objection</b> to Rava’s opinion from that which was taught: With regard to <b>a mortar, if it has garlic in it, one may move it</b> on Shabbat, <b>and if not, one may not move it</b> on Shabbat. According to Rava’s opinion that all utensils may be moved, why is it prohibited to move the mortar? Rava responded: <b>With what we are dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case of moving the mortar <b>from the sun to the shade,</b> which Rava prohibited. <b>Abaye raised an objection</b> to Rava’s opinion from that which was taught: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>agree</b> that <b>if one cut meat on it</b> for the purpose of the Festival <b>that</b> it is then <b>prohibited to move it</b> because there is no further need for it on the Festival. According to Rava’s opinion, all utensils may be moved. He answered him: <b>Here, too,</b> we are dealing with a case of moving the mortar <b>from the sun to the shade.</b>

### Part 13
<b>And</b> Abaye raised another objection with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One may not prop a pot with a piece of wood, and so too,</b> one may not prop <b>a door</b> on a piece of wood. <b>Isn’t a piece of wood on a Festival an object whose</b> primary <b>function</b> is <b>for</b> a <b>permitted</b> use, since it is permitted to move it to light an oven? <b>Apparently,</b> there is an opinion that moving <b>an object whose</b> primary <b>function</b> is <b>for</b> a <b>permitted</b> use, <b>both for the purpose of</b> utilizing the object <b>itself and for the purpose of</b> utilizing <b>its place</b> is <b>prohibited,</b> and according to Rabba, even Rabbi Neḥemya does not hold that this is so. Rava answers: <b>There, what is the reason</b> for the prohibition? It is <b>because on Shabbat it is an object whose</b> primary <b>function</b> is <b>for</b> a <b>prohibited</b> use. Since the wood is set aside from use on Shabbat, the Sages issued <b>a decree</b> prohibiting moving it <b>on a Festival, due to Shabbat.</b>

### Part 14
<b>And if you say:</b> Moving the wood should be <b>permitted on Shabbat itself because an object whose</b> primary <b>function</b> is <b>for</b> a <b>prohibited</b> use <b>is permitted both for the purpose of</b> utilizing the object <b>itself and for the purpose of</b> utilizing <b>its place,</b> that assertion is rejected. <b>This</b> ruling, which permits moving an object whose primary use is prohibited, <b>applies</b> only in a case <b>where the status of a vessel applies to it; in a case where the status of a vessel does not apply to it, no,</b> it is prohibited.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And do we issue decrees</b> prohibiting actions on Festivals due to the fact that they are prohibited on Shabbat? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>One may drop fruits</b> from the roof <b>through a skylight on a Festival, but not on Shabbat.</b> Apparently, the Sages do not prohibit on a Festival all of the actions that are prohibited on Shabbat.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks on the contrary: <b>And do we not issue decrees</b> on a Festival due to Shabbat? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>The only</b> difference <b>between a Festival and Shabbat is</b> with regard to the preparation of <b>food alone.</b> In all other matters the Sages established that the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat and Festivals are the same.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Yosef says:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> mishna, which rules that it is prohibited, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer; that</b> mishna, which rules that it is permitted, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is prohibited to slaughter a mother animal and its offspring on the same day, as it is stated: “You shall not slaughter it and its offspring both in one day” (Leviticus 22:28). With regard to <b>it and its offspring that fell into a pit</b> on a Festival, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One may raise the first in order to slaughter it, and</b> then <b>slaughter it; and</b> with regard to <b>the second one, one may provide it sustenance in its place</b> in the pit <b>so that it will not die. Rabbi Yehoshua says: One may raise the first in order to slaughter it, and</b> then reconsider and <b>not slaughter it, and</b> then <b>employ artifice</b> and say that he reconsidered and wants to slaughter the other, <b>and raise the second. If he</b> so <b>desires, he slaughters this</b> one; <b>if he</b> so <b>desires, he slaughters that</b> one. Apparently, Rabbi Yehoshua permits certain actions on a Festival due to financial considerations, and does not issue decrees in those cases.

### Part 18
The Gemara rejects this: <b>From what</b> does that conclusion ensue? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Eliezer only stated</b> that he may not raise the second animal <b>there,</b> in a case <b>where it is possible to</b> save the animal by <b>feeding</b> it in the pit; <b>however,</b> in a case <b>where it is impossible to</b> save it by <b>feeding</b> it in the pit, <b>no,</b> he would permit raising the animal.

### Part 19
<b>Alternatively, Rabbi Yehoshua only said</b> that he may raise the second animal in a case <b>where it is possible to employ artifice; however,</b> in a case <b>where it is not possible to employ artifice, no,</b> he would not permit doing so.

### Part 20
<b>Rather Rav Pappa said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, and that</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel. As we learned</b> in a mishna that <b>Beit Shammai say:</b>
