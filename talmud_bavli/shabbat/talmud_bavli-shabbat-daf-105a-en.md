### Part 1
<b>and managed</b> to write <b>two</b> letters, <b>he is liable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that one is <b>exempt</b> in that case? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult: That</b> case where we learned that he is exempt is referring to a case <b>where</b> the letters <b>require crowns. This</b> is referring to a case <b>where they do not require crowns,</b> and he is liable. If the letters already had their requisite ornamentation and an individual separated them, it is as if he wrote two letters.

### Part 2
We learned in the mishna If <b>one wrote one letter</b> as <b>an abbreviation [<i>notarikon</i>]</b> representing an entire word, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Beteira deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt. Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra: From where</b> is it derived that the <b>language of abbreviation</b> is employed <b>in the Torah? As it is stated:</b> “Neither shall your name any more be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; <b>for the father of a multitude of nations [<i>av hamon goyim</i>] have I made you”</b> (Genesis 17:5). The verse itself contracts <i>av hamon</i> into Abraham [<i>Avraham</i>]. The words <i>av hamon</i> themselves are interpreted as an abbreviation: <b>I have made you a father [<i>av</i>] for the nations, I have made you chosen [<i>baḥur</i>] among the nations, I have made you beloved [<i>ḥaviv</i>] among the nations, I have made you king [<i>melekh</i>] for the nations, I have made you distinguished [<i>vatik</i>] for the nations, I have made you trusted [<i>ne’eman</i>] for the nations.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan himself said</b> that the word <b><i>anokhi</i></b> that begins the Ten Commandments is an <b>abbreviation</b> for: <b>I myself wrote</b> and <b>gave [<i>ana nafshi ketivat yehavit</i>]. The Rabbis said</b> it is an abbreviation for: <b>A pleasant statement was written</b> and <b>given [<i>amira ne’ima ketiva yehiva</i>]. Some say</b> the word <b><i>anokhi</i></b> can be interpreted <b>backwards: It was written, it was given, its statements are faithful [<i>yehiva ketiva ne’emanim amareha</i>].</b>

### Part 4
<b>The school of Rabbi Natan said</b> that there is another abbreviation in the Torah. In the verse: “And the angel of the Lord said to him: Why did you hit your donkey these three times? Behold I have come out as an adversary <b>because your way is contrary [<i>yarat</i>] against me”</b> (Numbers 22:32). <i>Yarat</i> is an abbreviation for: The donkey <b>feared [<i>yare’a</i>], it saw [<i>ra’ata</i>],</b> and <b>it turned aside [<i>nateta</i>]. The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The word <b><i>karmel</i></b> in the verse: “And bread, and toasted grain flour, and toasted grain [<i>karmel</i>]” (Leviticus 23:14) means: <b>A full kernel [<i>kar maleh</i>],</b> i.e., the seed fills the stalk. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said</b> in King David’s words: “And behold, with you is Shimi ben Gera from Benjamin, of Bahurim, <b>who cursed me with a grievous [<i>nimretzet</i>] curse</b> on the day that I went to Mahanaim” (I Kings 2:8). The word <i>nimretzet</i> is an <b>abbreviation</b> for: <b>He is an adulterer [<i>noef</i>], he is a Moabite [<i>Moavi</i>], he is a murderer [<i>rotze’aḥ</i>], he is an oppressor [<i>tzorer</i>], he is an abomination [<i>to’eva</i>].</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that there is another abbreviation in the Bible: “And Judah said: What can we say to my master, <b>what can we speak, and how can we justify [<i>nitztadak</i>]”</b> (Genesis 44:16), which stands for: <b>We are honest [<i>nekhonim</i>], we are righteous [<i>tzaddikim</i>], we are pure [<i>tehorim</i>], we are innocent [<i>dakkim</i>], we are holy [<i>kedoshim</i>].</b>

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who writes two letters</b> on Shabbat <b>in two</b> separate <b>lapses of awareness</b> separated by a period of awareness that the day was Shabbat, writing <b>one</b> letter in <b>the morning and one</b> letter <b>in the afternoon, Rabban Gamliel deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering like someone who has unintentionally performed a full-fledged prohibited labor, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>what do they disagree? Rabban Gamliel holds: There is no awareness for half a measure.</b> One is not liable to bring a sacrifice for half a measure; therefore, the fact that he became aware between performance of the two halves of the prohibited labor is of no significance. His awareness does not demarcate between one act of writing a letter and the second act of writing a letter with regard to liability to bring a sin-offering. <b>And the Rabbis hold: There is awareness for half a measure.</b> If an individual became aware of his transgression between the two parts of the prohibited labor, each individual part is independent of the other, and the two halves of the prohibited labor do not join together to create liability.
