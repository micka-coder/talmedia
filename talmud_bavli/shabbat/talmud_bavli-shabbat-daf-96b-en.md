### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the main issue<b>,</b> the Gemara asks: <b>After all, throwing is a subcategory</b> of <b>carrying out. Where is</b> the primary category of prohibited labor of <b>carrying out itself written</b> in the Torah? Isn’t it necessary to clarify the primary category before discussing the subcategory? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: As the verse said: “And Moses commanded, and they passed a proclamation throughout the camp</b> saying: Neither man nor woman should perform any more work to contribute to the Sanctuary; and the people stopped bringing” (Exodus 36<b>:</b>6). According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, Moses commanded the people to cease bringing contributions in order to prevent them from bringing their contributions on Shabbat. He then explains<b>: Where was Moses sitting?</b> He was <b>in the camp of the Levites, and the Levites’ camp was the public domain. And he said to Israel: Do not carry out and bring</b> objects <b>from the private domain,</b> your camp, <b>to the public domain,</b> the camp of the Levites.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And how do</b> you know that <b>he was standing</b> and commanding the people <b>on Shabbat? Perhaps he was standing during the week, and</b> Moses commanded the cessation of contributions <b>because the labor</b> of the Tabernacle <b>was completed,</b> since all the necessary material was already donated, <b>as it is written: “And the work was sufficient for them</b> for all of the work to perform it, and there was extra” (Exodus 36:7). Rather, <b>derive</b> this by means of a verbal analogy between <b>passing</b> mentioned in this context and <b>passing</b> mentioned with regard to <b>Yom Kippur.</b>

### Part 3
<b>It is written here,</b> with regard to the Tabernacle: <b>“And they passed a proclamation throughout the camp,” and it is written there,</b> with regard to Yom Kippur: <b>“And you shall pass a blast of a <i>shofar</i></b> on the tenth day of the seventh month, on Yom Kippur you shall sound a shofar throughout your land” (Leviticus 25:9). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the <i>shofar</i> of the Jubilee Year, passing is <b>on a day</b> on which it is <b>prohibited</b> to perform labor, <b>so too, here</b> passing is <b>on a day</b> on which it is <b>prohibited</b> to perform labor.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source prohibiting <b>carrying out</b> from a private domain into the camp of the Levites. <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>carrying in</b> is also considered a prohibited labor? The Gemara answers: <b>It is a logical inference. After all,</b> carrying is <b>from one domain to another,</b> so <b>what</b> difference <b>is</b> there <b>to me</b> whether it is <b>carrying out or carrying in?</b> Carrying from one domain to another is prohibited; the direction in which the object is carried makes no difference. <b>However, carrying out</b> is a <b>primary category,</b> while <b>carrying in</b> is a <b>subcategory,</b> as it is not stated explicitly in the biblical text.

### Part 5
The Gemara now questions the distinction between primary categories and subcategories of labor. <b>After all, one is liable for this,</b> carrying out, <b>and one is liable for that,</b> carrying in. <b>Why</b> is <b>this called</b> a <b>primary category, and why</b> is <b>this called a subcategory?</b> What is the point of the distinction?

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: The practical <b>ramification is that if one performs two</b> different <b>primary categories together,</b> or <b>alternatively,</b> if one performs <b>two subcategories</b> of two different primary categories <b>together, he is liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin-offerings. <b>And if one performs a primary category</b> of labor together <b>with its own subcategory, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin-offering.

### Part 7
The Gemara further asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who <b>renders one liable for</b> the performance of <b>a subcategory</b> of prohibited labor when performed <b>together with a primary category, why</b> is <b>this called</b> a <b>primary category, and why</b> is <b>this called a subcategory?</b> The Gemara answers: According to him, <b>that which was a significant labor in the Tabernacle is called a primary category; that which was not a significant labor in the Tabernacle is not called a primary category. Alternatively,</b> perhaps <b>that which is written</b> explicitly in the Torah <b>is called a primary category, and that which is not written</b> explicitly in the Torah <b>is called a subcategory.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And</b> as for the <i>halakha</i> <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>one who throws</b> an object on Shabbat a distance of <b>four cubits</b> in the public domain and it lands <b>on a wall,</b> if the wall was <b>higher than ten handbreadths,</b> it is <b>as if he threw it into the air,</b> and he is exempt. If the wall was <b>lower than ten handbreadths,</b> it is <b>as if he threw it onto the ground, and one who throws an object</b> a distance of <b>four cubits onto the ground</b> in the public domain <b>is liable.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: If <b>one threw</b> an object <b>four cubits in the public domain,</b> and it did not go from one domain to another, <b>from where do we</b> derive <b>that he is liable?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yoshiya said: Because the weavers of</b> the <b>tapestries</b> in the Tabernacle <b>throw their needles to each other</b> when they need to borrow the other’s needle. Throwing was a labor performed in the Tabernacle; therefore, one is liable for performing it. The Gemara wonders: <b>Why do weavers</b> need <b>needles? Rather,</b> emend the statement to say: <b>Because those who sewed</b> the <b>tapestries throw their needles to each other.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: Is it clear that they had to throw needles to each other? <b>Perhaps they sat next to each other.</b> The Gemara answers: It is clear that they kept their distance from each other. If they sat too close, <b>they would reach each other</b> and hurt one another <b>with</b> their <b>needles.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Perhaps,</b> even though they kept their distance, they <b>sat within four cubits</b> of each other, and they would not throw the needles farther than that. In the absence of proof of their sitting arrangement, this <i>halakha</i> cannot be derived from those who sewed the tapestries.

### Part 11
<b>Rather, Rav Ḥisda said:</b> Throwing an object four cubits in the public domain is prohibited <b>because the weavers of</b> the <b>tapestries</b> in the Tabernacle <b>threw the shuttle,</b> to which the thread of the warp was tied <b>on the tapestry.</b> Weaving entails throwing the thread of the warp through the threads of the woof. The Gemara asks: That is not actually throwing, <b>as didn’t</b> the weaver <b>hold</b> the end of the thread <b>in his hand?</b> One is not liable for throwing an object when part of it remains in his hand. Rather, this must be referring to <b>the final throw,</b> when the weaving was finished and the weaver released the thread from his hand.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>Doesn’t</b> the shuttle <b>go in an exempt domain?</b> The tapestry was less than four handbreadths wide, rendering it an exempt domain even though it is four cubits long. One who throws in an exempt domain is exempt. <b>Rather, it is because the weavers of tapestries throw the shuttle to those who</b> seek to <b>borrow</b> it from them. The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps they sat next to each other?</b> The Gemara answers: That is impossible because <b>they would reach one another</b> and disturb one another when tightening the thread at <b>the end</b> of the tapestry.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And perhaps they were</b> not in a straight line but <b>staggered.</b> That would enable the weavers to sit adjacent to each other without disturbing each other’s work. <b>And furthermore, did they borrow from each another? Wasn’t</b> the following <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> of the Sage <b>Luda?</b> The verse states: “And all the wise men who performed all of the work of the Sanctuary came, <b>each one from the work he was doing”</b> (Exodus 36:4). From that verse it is derived: Each <b>performed</b> the labor <b>from his own work, and they would not perform</b> the labor <b>from their friends’ work.</b> Each person had his own tools and did not need to borrow from others.

### Part 14
<b>And furthermore,</b> the Gemara asks: <b>Even</b> if the <i>halakha</i> of throwing was derived from here, <b>from where do we</b> derive that <b>one who carries</b> an object <b>four cubits in the public domain is liable?</b> Rather, apparently, this <i>halakha</i> is not derived from the labor performed in the construction of the Tabernacle. <b>Rather, all</b> the <i>halakhot</i> related to carrying <b>four cubits in the public domain are learned through tradition</b> and not derived from the text.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The wood gatherer</b> who was sentenced to death for desecrating Shabbat (see Numbers 15:33–36) <b>was one who carried four cubits in the public domain.</b> He was stoned for performing the prohibited labor of carrying. <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: He was one who detached</b> still-growing branches. He was stoned for performing the prohibited labor of detaching. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ya’akov, said: He was one who gathered</b> sticks together into a pile.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>ramification</b> of determining precisely which prohibited labor the wood gatherer performed? The Gemara answers: The ramification is <b>with regard to</b> the statement of <b>Rav, as Rav said: I found a hidden scroll in the house of Rabbi Ḥiyya. And in it, it is written</b> that <b>Isi ben Yehuda says:</b> The number of <b>primary categories of labor</b> prohibited on Shabbat is <b>forty-less-one. And if one performed all</b> of them <b>in</b> the course of <b>one lapse of awareness, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin-offering. The Gemara asks: <b>One and no more? We learned</b> in a mishna: The number of <b>primary categories of prohibited labors</b> on Shabbat is <b>forty-less-one,</b> which the mishna proceeds to list. <b>And we discussed</b> this mishna: <b>Why do I need</b> this <b>tally</b> of forty-less-one? <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The tally was included to teach <b>that if one performed all</b> the prohibited labors <b>in</b> the course of <b>one lapse of awareness,</b> during which he was unaware of the prohibition involved, <b>he is liable for each and every one.</b>

### Part 17
This citation from the hidden scroll cannot be accurate. Rather, emend this statement in the hidden scroll and <b>say</b> that <b>one is not liable for one</b> of them. There is a primary category of labor among the thirty-nine primary categories of prohibited labor whose violation does not incur the death penalty. The identity of this category that is not punishable by death was not specified.

### Part 18
<b>It is obvious to Rav Yehuda</b> that <b>one who carries</b> four cubits in the public domain <b>is liable</b> to receive the death penalty. <b>And it is obvious to</b> the <b><i>baraita</i></b> that <b>one who detaches is liable</b> to receive the death penalty. <b>And it is obvious to Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov</b> that <b>one who gathers is liable</b> to receive the death penalty. In other words, this <b>Master maintains:</b> With regard to <b>this</b> labor, <b>in any case, there is no uncertainty. And this Master maintains:</b> With regard to <b>that</b> labor, <b>in any case, there is no uncertainty.</b> Each Sage maintains that the prohibited labor that he attributed to the wood gatherer incurs the death penalty and is certainly not the labor referred to in the hidden scroll.

### Part 19
On the topic of the wood gatherer, the Gemara cites that which <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The wood gatherer</b> mentioned in the Torah was <b>Zelophehad, and it says: “And the children of Israel were in the desert and they found a man</b> gathering wood on the day of Shabbat” (Numbers 15:32), <b>and below,</b> in the appeal of the daughters of Zelophehad, <b>it is stated: “Our father died in the desert</b> and he was not among the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Korah, but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons” (Numbers 27:3). <b>Just as below</b> the man in the desert is <b>Zelophehad, so too, here,</b> in the case of the wood gatherer, the unnamed man in the desert is <b>Zelophehad;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 20
<b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira said to him: Akiva, in either case you will be judged in the future</b> for this teaching. <b>If</b> the truth is <b>in accordance with your statement</b> that the wood gatherer was Zelophehad, <b>the Torah concealed</b> his identity, <b>and you reveal it. And if</b> it the truth is not in accordance with your statement, <b>you are</b> unjustly <b>slandering that righteous man.</b>
