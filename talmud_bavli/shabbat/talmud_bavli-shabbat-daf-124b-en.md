### Part 1
<b>One may neither carry a child nor a <i>lulav</i> nor a Torah scroll out to the public domain</b> on a Festival, <b>and Beit Hillel permit</b> doing so. Beit Hillel permit carrying objects from one domain to another on a Festival for purposes other than preparing food.

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Say that you heard Beit Shammai</b> prohibit <b>carrying out</b> an object from one domain to another; <b>did you hear</b> that they prohibited <b>moving</b> an object? The Gemara rejects that distinction: <b>And isn’t</b> the prohibition of <b>moving itself</b> a decree issued <b>due to</b> the prohibition of <b>carrying out?</b> One who prohibits carrying out certainly prohibits moving an object as well.

### Part 3
The Gemara adds: <b>And even Rav holds</b> in accordance with <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> of <b>Rava, as Rav said:</b> Moving <b>a hoe</b> so <b>that</b> it will <b>not be stolen; that is</b> an example of <b>moving</b> an object <b>not for a</b> specific <b>purpose, and</b> it <b>is prohibited.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that it is prohibited <b>is</b> that it is moved <b>so it will not be stolen; however, for the purpose of</b> utilizing the object <b>itself and for the purpose of</b> utilizing <b>its place,</b> it is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rav Kahana happen</b> to come <b>to the house of Rav, and</b> he <b>said: Bring a net for Kahana</b> so that he may <b>sit on</b> it? <b>Is that not to say that</b> with regard to <b>an object whose</b> primary <b>function is prohibited, for the purpose of</b> utilizing the object <b>itself, yes,</b> it is permitted to move it; and <b>for the purpose of</b> utilizing <b>its place, no,</b> it is prohibited?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers that <b>this is what he said to them: Remove</b> the <b>net from before Kahana.</b> That is a case of moving for the purpose of utilizing its place. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>There,</b> it was a case of moving the object <b>from the sun to the shade,</b> as it was in a place where it could have been damaged. One might have mistakenly concluded that this was the reason that they were moving the net. Rav specified that the net was being moved for the purpose of utilizing the object itself, not to indicate that moving it for the purpose of utilizing its place is prohibited, but to indicate that moving from the sun to the shade is prohibited.

### Part 6
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Mari bar Raḥel, had felt cushions in the sun</b> on Shabbat. Rav Mari <b>came before Rava</b> and <b>said to him: What is</b> the ruling with regard <b>to carrying them?</b> Rava <b>said to him: It is permitted.</b> Rav Mari said to Rava: <b>I have others,</b> and I do not need these cushions specifically. Rava said to him: Even so, these cushions are <b>suitable for guests.</b> Rav Mari said to him: <b>I also have</b> others <b>for guests and therefore</b> would be moving the cushions so that they would not be ruined in the sun. Rava <b>said to him: You have revealed your opinion</b> that <b>you hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba. For everyone</b> else, <b>it is permitted</b> to move the cushions in this situation; however, <b>for you, it is prohibited,</b> as it is inappropriate to permit one to perform an action that he considers prohibited.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>brooms</b> made <b>of fine wool</b> garments, <b>it is permitted to move them on Shabbat</b> because it is permitted to use them. <b>However,</b> brooms made <b>of date-palm</b> fronds, <b>no,</b> they may not be moved. It is prohibited to fill holes in the ground.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> It is permitted to move <b>even</b> those made <b>of date-palm</b> fronds. The Gemara asks: <b>With what are we dealing? If you say</b> that this is referring to moving it <b>for the purpose of</b> utilizing the object <b>itself and for the purpose of</b> utilizing <b>its place, would Rav say</b> a broom made <b>of date-palm</b> fronds, <b>no,</b> it may not be moved? <b>Doesn’t Rav hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava? Rather,</b> this is referring to moving the broom <b>from the sun to the shade,</b> and that these brooms are in a place where they can be damaged. However, it is still puzzling: <b>In this</b> case, <b>would Rabbi Elazar say</b> that <b>even</b> brooms made <b>from date-palm</b> fronds may be moved? The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> this is referring to moving them <b>from the sun,</b> where they will be damaged, <b>to the shade.</b> Emend this and <b>say: And so too, Rabbi Elazar said,</b> like Rav, that it is prohibited.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All vessels that may be moved on Shabbat, their shards may be moved along with them, as long as they are suited for some purpose.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Shards of a</b> large <b>bowl</b> may be used <b>to cover the mouth of a barrel. Shards of</b> a <b>glass</b> vessel may be used <b>to cover the mouth of a cruse.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda <b>says: As long as they are suited for a purpose similar to their</b> original <b>use. Shards of a</b> large <b>bowl</b> must be suited <b>to pour soup into them, and shards of a glass</b> vessel must be suited <b>to pour oil into them.</b>

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> This <b>dispute</b> in the mishna is only with regard to a case <b>where</b> the vessels <b>broke on Shabbat eve, as this Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that if they are suited for a purpose <b>similar to their</b> original <b>use, yes,</b> it is permitted, and for <b>some other use, no,</b> it is prohibited. <b>And this Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>hold: Even</b> if they are suited <b>for some other use,</b> it is also permitted.

### Part 13
<b>But</b> if the vessels <b>broke on Shabbat, everyone agrees they are permitted.</b> The reason for this is <b>since they were</b> designated for Shabbat use and consequently considered <b>prepared</b> at the onset of Shabbat <b>due to their original</b> vessels, <b>it is permitted</b> to move the shards as well.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Zutrai raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may kindle</b> a fire on a Festival <b>with</b> whole <b>vessels, but one may not kindle</b> a fire <b>with shards of vessels.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara seeks to clarify: Vessels <b>that were broken when? If you say</b> that <b>they were broken before the Festival,</b> why is it prohibited to light a fire with them? <b>They are</b> pieces of <b>ordinary wood. Isn’t</b> this referring to a case where they broke <b>on the Festival, and it is taught: One may kindle</b> a fire on a Festival <b>with</b> whole <b>vessels, but one may not kindle</b> a fire <b>with shards of vessels.</b> The legal status of a vessel broken on a Festival, and all the more so one broken on Shabbat, is more stringent, not less.

### Part 16
<b>Rather, if it was stated, it was stated as follows. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> This <b>dispute</b> in the mishna is only with regard to a case <b>where</b> the vessels <b>broke on Shabbat, as this Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds it was prepared</b> before Shabbat as part of the original vessel, <b>and this Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>it</b> is an item that <b>came into being</b> on Shabbat. Since they were not shards before Shabbat, they are a new entity and are set-aside. <b>However,</b> if they were broken <b>from before</b> the onset of <b>Shabbat everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>permitted</b> to move them, <b>since they were prepared to</b> serve some <b>function while it was still day,</b> before the onset of Shabbat.

### Part 17
With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of Festivals, <b>it was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may kindle</b> a fire <b>with</b> whole <b>vessels, but one may not kindle</b> a fire <b>with shards of vessels. And it was taught</b> in the <b>other</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as one may kindle</b> a fire <b>with vessels, so</b> too, <b>one may kindle</b> a fire <b>with shards of vessels. And it was taught</b> in yet <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may neither kindle</b> a fire <b>with vessels nor with shards of vessels.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara resolves the apparent contradiction between the <i>baraitot</i>: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which distinguishes between vessels and broken vessels, <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that there is a prohibition of set-aside on a Festival. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which permits kindling with both vessels and shards, <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that there is no prohibition of set-aside on a Festival. <b>This</b> third <i>baraita</i>, which prohibits kindling with both vessels and shards, <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya,</b> who prohibits moving a vessel for any purpose other than its designated function.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> With regard to <b>these bricks that remained from the building</b> after construction was completed, <b>it is permitted to move them</b> on Shabbat, because <b>they are suited</b> for one <b>to sit on them.</b> And if <b>one arranged them</b> in a pile, he <b>certainly</b> thereby <b>set them aside</b> from his consciousness, and it is prohibited to move them.

### Part 20
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>a small earthenware</b> shard, it <b>is permitted to move</b> it on Shabbat <b>in the courtyard,</b> because there are vessels there that need to be covered; <b>but in a <i>karmelit</i>, no,</b> one may not move it, because typically there are no vessels there and there would be no use for the shard. <b>And Rav Naḥman himself said: Even in a <i>karmelit</i></b> it is permitted, <b>but in the public domain, no,</b> it is prohibited. <b>And Rava said: Even in the public domain,</b> it is permitted.

### Part 21
<b>And Rava follows his</b> regular line of <b>reasoning, as Rava was walking in the street of Meḥoza</b> and <b>his shoes became dirty with clay. His servant came, took</b> a shard of <b>earthenware</b> from the street, <b>and wiped</b> the clay off. <b>The Sages raised</b> their <b>voice at him</b> to reprimand him. Rava <b>said: Is it not enough</b> for them that <b>they did not learn,</b> but <b>they are also teaching</b> others? <b>If</b> the shard <b>was in a courtyard, wouldn’t it be suited to cover a vessel with it? Here too,</b> the shard <b>is also suited to me,</b> and moving it should not be prohibited.

### Part 22
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>the</b> clay <b>seal of a jug that was broken, it is permitted to move</b> it <b>on Shabbat. That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the</b> clay <b>seal that was broken, it is permitted to move it, and its shards are permitted to be carried on Shabbat. And one may not break a shard from it to cover a vessel with it or to support the legs of a bed with it. And if one threw it into the garbage</b> dump, <b>it is prohibited</b> to move it because he set it aside from his consciousness.

### Part 23
<b>Rav Pappa strongly objects to this: If</b> that is <b>so,</b> if <b>one throws his cloak</b> into the garbage dump, would you <b>also</b> say that <b>it is prohibited</b> to move it because it is set-aside? Isn’t the cloak still fit for use, and its status is not dependent on his intention? <b>Rather, Rav Pappa said:</b>Rav Mari bar Raḥel, had felt
