### Part 1
<b>once they decreed that first, why do I need that</b> decree of impurity on hands that touch a sacred scroll <b>as well?</b> Once the Sages decreed impurity on hands in general, there is no longer a necessity to decree impurity on hands that touched a Torah scroll, as hands are impure in any case. <b>Rather,</b> certainly the Sages <b>decreed</b> impurity on <b>this,</b> hands that touched a Torah scroll, <b>first. And then they decreed</b> impurity <b>on all hands.</b>

### Part 2
Among the decrees listed in the mishna, there is the decree that contact with one who <b>immersed himself during the day</b> disqualifies <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>One who immersed himself during the day</b> transmits impurity by <b>Torah</b> law, as it is written: “One who touches it remains impure until evening. He should not eat of the consecrated items and he must wash his flesh with water. <b>And the sun sets and it is purified.</b> Afterward, he may eat from the teruma, for it is his bread” (Leviticus 22:6–7). Consequently, until sunset he is prohibited by Torah law from touching consecrated items, and the same is true for <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>Delete from here,</b> from the list of decrees in the mishna, <b>one who immersed himself during the day.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And</b> among the decrees that were listed, there is also the decree concerning the impurity of <b>the foods that became impure</b> through contact <b>with liquids.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With liquids that</b> became impure due to contact with <b>what</b> source of impurity? <b>If you say</b> that the mishna is referring to <b>liquids that come</b> to be impure <b>due to</b> contact with <b>a creeping animal, they are</b> impure <b>by Torah law, as it is written</b> with regard to the impurity of creeping animals: <b>“And every liquid that is drunk</b> in any vessel, will be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). <b>Rather,</b> the mishna is referring to <b>liquids that come</b> to be impure <b>due to</b> contact with impure <b>hands.</b> The Sages issued this <b>decree due to liquids that come</b> to be impure <b>through</b> contact with <b>a creeping animal.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And</b> among the decrees that were listed, there is also the decree concerning <b>the vessels that became impure</b> through contact <b>with liquids.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Vessels that became impure</b> due to contact <b>with liquids that</b> became impure due to contact with <b>what</b> source of impurity? <b>If you say</b> that they become impure due to contact <b>with liquids</b> secreted by <b>a <i>zav</i>,</b> e.g., spittle, urine, etc., <b>they are</b> impure <b>by Torah law, as it is written: “And if a <i>zav</i> spits on a pure person</b> and he should wash his clothes and wash in water and he is impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:8). The Sages interpreted homiletically: <b>Whatever is in the hand of the pure person I made impure for you.</b> Not only did the person who came into contact with the liquids of the <i>zav</i> become impure, but the objects in his hand did as well. <b>Rather,</b> here it is referring <b>to liquids that come</b> to be impure <b>due to</b> contact with <b>a creeping animal,</b> which by Torah law do not transmit impurity to vessels. <b>And</b> the Sages issued <b>a decree</b> with regard to those liquids <b>due to</b> their similarity to the <b>liquids of a <i>zav</i>.</b>

### Part 5
Among the list of items in the mishna with regard to which the disciples of Shammai and Hillel instituted decrees, were the hands of any person who did not purify himself for the sake of purity of <i>teruma</i>. If he came into contact with <i>teruma</i>, the Sages decreed it impure. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>hands,</b> was it <b>the disciples of Shammai and Hillel</b> who <b>issued the decree</b> of impurity? <b>Shammai and Hillel</b> themselves <b>issued the decree. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Yosei ben Yo’ezer of Tzereida and Yosei ben Yoḥanan of Jerusalem decreed impurity on the land of the nations,</b> that the land outside Eretz Yisrael transmits impurity; <b>and</b> they decreed impurity <b>on glass vessels,</b> even though glass is not listed in the Torah among the vessels that can become impure. <b>Shimon ben Shataḥ instituted</b> the formula of <b>a woman’s marriage contract and</b> also <b>decreed</b> special <b>impurity on metal vessels. Shammai and Hillel decreed impurity on the hands.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>Shammai and his faction and Hillel and his faction, didn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Shmuel said: With regard to eighteen matters they issued decrees</b> that day, <b>and with regard to</b> those <b>eighteen</b> matters <b>they disagreed</b> prior to that? The eighteen disputes were only between the disciples of Shammai and Hillel, <b>whereas Hillel and Shammai</b> themselves <b>argued only in three places.</b> Clearly, they were neither party to the disputes nor the decrees. <b>As Rav Huna said:</b> Shammai and Hillel <b>disagreed in</b> only <b>three places and no more. And if you say</b> that Hillel and Shammai <b>came</b> and <b>decreed</b> that <i>teruma</i> that came into contact with hands <b>would be in abeyance, and their students came and decreed to burn</b> <i>teruma</i> that came into contact with hands, then the following difficulty arises. <b>Didn’t Ilfa,</b> one of the Sages, <b>say:</b> With regard to <b>hands,</b> from <b>the beginning their decree</b> was that <i>teruma</i> that comes into contact with them is <b>to be burned?</b> According to Ilfa, there is no uncertainty. <i>Teruma</i> that came into contact with definite impurity is burned. <i>Teruma</i> that is in abeyance may not be destroyed. One must wait until it becomes definitely impure or decomposes on its own. <b>Rather,</b> the explanation is that <b>they came and issued a decree and</b> the people <b>did not accept</b> the decree <b>from them, and their disciples came and issued a decree and they accepted</b> it <b>from them.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks further: <b>Still,</b> the matter is not clear, as the decree of hands was <b>issued</b> by King <b>Solomon. As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: At the time that Solomon instituted</b> the ordinances of <b><i>eiruv</i> and</b> of <b>washing hands</b> to purify them from their impurity, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said</b> in his praise: <b>“My son, if your heart is wise my heart will be glad, even mine”</b> (Proverbs 23:15), and so too: <b>“My son, be wise and make my heart glad, that I may respond to those who taunt me”</b> (Proverbs 27: 11). The Gemara responds: <b>Came</b>
