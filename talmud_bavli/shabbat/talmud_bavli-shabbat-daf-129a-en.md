### Part 1
<b>I need</b> Shabbat to be desecrated, or <b>whether she did not say: I need</b> Shabbat to be desecrated, <b>one does not desecrate Shabbat for her.</b>

### Part 2
<b>That is</b> how <b>Rav Ashi taught it. This is</b> how <b>Mar Zutra taught it: Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>a woman in childbirth, as long as the womb is open, whether she said: I need</b> Shabbat to be desecrated, or <b>whether she did not say: I need</b> Shabbat to be desecrated, <b>one desecrates Shabbat for her.</b> Once <b>the womb closed</b> after birth, if <b>she said: I need</b> Shabbat to be desecrated, <b>one desecrates Shabbat for her.</b> If <b>she did not say: I need</b> Shabbat to be desecrated, and all the more so if she said: I do not need Shabbat to be desecrated, <b>one does not desecrate Shabbat for her.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Ravina said to Mareimar:</b> Since <b>Mar Zutra teaches leniently, and Rav Ashi teaches stringently, in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is the <i>halakha</i>?</b> Mareimar <b>said to him: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Mar Zutra,</b> based on the following principle: In cases of <b>uncertainty</b> concerning <b>a life-threatening</b> situation, the <i>halakha</i> <b>is lenient.</b>

### Part 4
With regard to the matter of the open womb, the Gemara asks: <b>From when is</b> it considered that <b>the opening of the womb</b> has begun? <b>Abaye says:</b> It begins <b>from when</b> the woman <b>sits on the travailing chair. Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> It begins <b>from when the blood flows and descends; and others say when her friends</b> need to <b>carry her by her arms,</b> as she can no longer walk on her own.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>Until when</b> does <b>the opening of the womb</b> continue? <b>Abaye said:</b> It lasts <b>three days. Rava said in the name of Rav Yehuda:</b> It lasts <b>seven</b> days. <b>And others say:</b> It lasts <b>thirty</b> days.

### Part 6
The Sages of <b>Neharde’a say:</b> For <b>a woman in childbirth,</b> there are halakhic distinctions between <b>three, seven, and thirty</b> days after she gives birth. The Gemara elaborates: During the first <b>three</b> days after birth, <b>whether she said: I need</b> Shabbat to be desecrated, or <b>whether she did not say: I need</b> Shabbat to be desecrated, <b>one desecrates Shabbat for her.</b> Between three and <b>seven</b> days after birth, if <b>she said: I need</b> Shabbat to be desecrated, <b>one desecrates Shabbat for her.</b> If <b>she did not say: I need</b> Shabbat to be desecrated, <b>one does not desecrate Shabbat for her.</b> Between seven and <b>thirty</b> days after birth, <b>even</b> if <b>she said: I need</b> Shabbat to be desecrated, <b>one does not desecrate Shabbat for her; however, we perform</b> all necessary prohibited labors <b>by means of a gentile.</b>

### Part 7
This ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rav Ulla, son of Rav Ilai,</b> who <b>said: All needs</b> of a sick person whose life is not in danger <b>are performed by means of a gentile on Shabbat. And</b> this ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Hamnuna, as Rav Hamnuna says:</b> With regard to <b>a matter in which there is no danger,</b> but only potential illness, <b>one says to the gentile</b> to perform the act, <b>and</b> the gentile <b>performs</b> the act.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> For <b>a woman in childbirth,</b> there is a <i>halakha</i> of <b>thirty days.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> was this stated? The Sages of <b>Neharde’a say:</b> It was stated <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>immersion.</b> A woman does not purify herself through ritual immersion within thirty days of giving birth because she is in a weakened state and susceptible to catching cold.

### Part 9
<b>Rava said: We say</b> that the ruling that she does not immerse during that period applies <b>only when her husband is not with her. However,</b> if <b>her husband is with her, her husband warms her</b> by engaging in relations with her, and she is not susceptible to catching cold, <b>as</b> is illustrated <b>in this</b> incident involving <b>the daughter of Rav Ḥisda,</b> Rava’s wife. She <b>immersed within thirty days</b> of giving birth, <b>not in the presence of her husband, and caught cold, and</b> afterward <b>they brought her</b> funeral <b>bier after Rava to Pumbedita.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: One builds a fire for a woman in childbirth on Shabbat during the rainy season.</b> The Sages <b>thought</b> to infer <b>from here</b> the following: <b>For a woman in childbirth, yes,</b> one builds a fire; <b>for sick people, no, he</b> does not build a fire. <b>In the rainy season, yes,</b> one builds a fire; <b>in the summer, no, he</b> does not build a fire. <b>And</b> the Gemara concludes: <b>That is not</b> the case. <b>There is no difference</b> between <b>a woman in childbirth and a sick person, and there is no difference between the rainy season and the summer.</b> In all of these cases one may build a fire on Shabbat. This conclusion emerges <b>from that which was stated: Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to one who <b>let blood and caught cold, one makes a fire for him even during the season of Tammuz,</b> i.e., the summer. Failure to do so could result in serious illness.

### Part 11
The Gemara relates that after <b>Shmuel</b> underwent bloodletting, <b>they broke for him a</b> wooden <b>armchair</b> made <b>of teak [<i>shaga</i>]</b> to build a fire. Similarly, for the sake of <b>Rav Yehuda they broke</b> a wooden <b>table</b> made <b>of ebony [<i>yavna</i>], and for Rabba they broke a bench.</b> They needed to build a fire due to the potential danger to Rabba. Since they could not find firewood, they kindled the fire with the furniture.

### Part 12
<b>And Abaye said to Rabba:</b> In breaking the bench, <b>didn’t the Master violate</b> the prohibition, <b>“Do not destroy”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:19)? It is prohibited to destroy objects of value. Rabba <b>said to him: Do not destroy</b> also with regard to destruction <b>of my body.</b> Preventing illness and danger <b>is preferable to me.</b>

### Part 13
With regard to the danger of bloodletting, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: One should always sell the beams of his house and purchase shoes for his feet</b> with the proceeds, as shoes protect him from stepping on obstacles and from catching cold. <b>If he let blood and has nothing to eat</b> after the bloodletting, <b>he should</b> even <b>sell the shoes on his feet, and from</b> the proceeds <b>provide the needs of a meal.</b> After bloodletting, a meal is more crucial to one’s well-being than shoes are.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> these special <b>needs of a meal? Rav said:</b> It is referring to <b>meat. And Shmuel said:</b> It is referring to <b>wine.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rav says:</b> It is referring to <b>meat</b> because <b>the soul replaces the soul,</b> i.e., the meat replenishes the person’s strength. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> It is referring to <b>wine</b> because <b>the red replaces the red,</b> i.e., red wine substitutes for red blood.

### Part 15
<b>A mnemonic</b> for the names of the Sages cited in the following discussion is the word <b><i>shenimsar</i>;</b> <i>shin</i> for Shmuel, <i>nun</i> for Rabbi Yoḥanan, <i>mem</i> for Rav Naḥman, <i>samekh</i> for Rav Yosef, <i>reish</i> for Rava.

### Part 16
The Gemara relates the following about bloodletting and drinking wine. <b>Shmuel, on the day</b> on which he <b>would perform the practice</b> of bloodletting, <b>they</b> would <b>prepare for him</b> a dish of <b>cooked spleen. Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> would <b>drink</b> wine after bloodletting <b>until the odor emerged from his ears. And Rav Naḥman</b> would <b>drink until his spleen floated</b> in wine. <b>Rav Yosef</b> would <b>drink until</b> the wine <b>would emerge from the bloodletting incision. Rava would search</b> for <b>wine</b> that was sufficiently aged such <b>that three leaves</b> had already grown over three years on the vine from which the grapes were picked (Rashash).

### Part 17
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzhak said to the Sages: I beg of you, on the day</b> that you undergo <b>bloodletting, tell your households,</b> your wives: <b>Naḥman</b> bar Yitzhak <b>happened</b> to come <b>to</b> visit <b>us.</b> Due to the visit of the important guest, the women will prepare a large meal. The husbands will eat well, recover from the lost blood, and avoid endangering themselves.

### Part 18
<b>And</b> Rav Naḥman bar Yitzhak said: <b>All types of artifice</b> that come at the expense of others <b>are prohibited except for this artifice, which is permitted. One who performed the practice</b> of bloodletting <b>and it is not possible for him</b> to purchase food due to lack of means, <b>let him take a worn <i>zuz</i></b> coin <b>and go to seven stores.</b> In each store, he tastes the wine as one who seeks to buy wine would. After tasting, he hands the <i>zuz</i> to the storekeeper, who will not accept it because it is worn. He then proceeds to do the same in all the stores <b>until he has tasted the measure of a quarter</b> of a <i>log</i> of wine. <b>And if</b> doing so <b>is not</b> possible, <b>let him eat seven black dates and smear oil on his temple and lie in the sun.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara relates: The gentile scholar, <b>Ablat, found Shmuel lying in the sun.</b> Ablat <b>said to</b> Shmuel: <b>Wise man of the Jews,</b> a matter that is <b>evil, can it become good?</b> Are there any circumstances in which the heat of the sun, which is harmful, can be beneficial? Shmuel <b>said to him: It</b> happens on <b>a day of bloodletting,</b> for which the heat of the sun is beneficial.

### Part 20
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> actually, <b>that is not</b> what occurred. <b>Rather, there is a day on which the sun is beneficial</b> more than <b>the entire year,</b> and that is <b>the day on which the Tammuz solstice,</b> the longest day of the year, occurs. <b>And Shmuel thought: I will not reveal</b> this remedy <b>to him.</b>

### Part 21
<b>Indifferent, in wind, taste, waited</b> are a <b>mnemonic</b> for the following matters. It was <b>Rav and Shmuel who both said: Anyone who is indifferent</b> and not vigilant with regard to <b>the meal</b> eaten after <b>bloodletting, they are indifferent</b> with regard to providing <b>his food from the Heavens. And they say</b> in the name of Heaven: <b>He took no pity on his life, will I take pity on him?</b>

### Part 22
Similarly, it was <b>Rav and Shmuel who both said: One who performs the practice</b> of bloodletting <b>should not sit where the wind is blowing,</b> due to the concern that <b>perhaps the blood letter let</b> too much blood from <b>him and established</b> the amount of remaining blood <b>at a quarter</b> of a <i>log</i>. <b>And</b> there is concern <b>the wind will come and draw out</b> a little more blood <b>from him, and he will be endangered.</b>

### Part 23
The Gemara relates: <b>Shmuel would customarily perform the practice</b> of bloodletting <b>in a house</b> whose walls were <b>seven and a half bricks thick. One day he performed</b> bloodletting <b>and felt himself</b> weakened. <b>He examined</b> and discovered that <b>one half-brick was lacking</b> from the thickness of the walls. The resultant chill caused his weakness.

### Part 24
It was <b>Rav and Shmuel who both said: One who performs the practice of bloodletting should taste something and then go outside, since if he does not taste anything, if he encounters a corpse, his face will turn green. If he encounters one who killed a person, he will die. If he encounters</b>
