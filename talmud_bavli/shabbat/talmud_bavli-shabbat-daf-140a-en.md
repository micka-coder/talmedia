### Part 1
<b>Because it is only made to</b> enhance the <b>color</b> of the food. That does not negate the egg-white as significant food in the sense that it would be considered waste, and therefore, no actual selection is performed.

### Part 2
<b>It is stated:</b> With regard to <b>mustard that one kneaded on Shabbat eve, on the following day,</b> Shabbat, <b>Rav said: One may dissolve it</b> in wine or water <b>with a vessel, but not with</b> his <b>hand,</b> as using a vessel diverges from the normal method of preparation.

### Part 3
<b>Shmuel said to him:</b> Why may he not dissolve it <b>with</b> his <b>hand? Is that to say that he dissolves it with</b> his <b>hand every day?</b> If it is prepared in that manner, <b>it is donkey food.</b> Certainly dissolving by hand is not the manner in which mustard is prepared during the week. Therefore, dissolving mustard with a vessel should not be permitted on Shabbat. <b>Rather, Shmuel said</b> the opposite: <b>He may dissolve it with</b> his <b>hand</b> as a divergence from the typical method of preparation, <b>but he may not dissolve it</b> in the usual manner, <b>with a vessel.</b>

### Part 4
<b>It is stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> from Eretz Yisrael also disputed this issue, as <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Both this and that,</b> dissolving by hand and with a vessel, <b>are prohibited;</b> while <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Both this and that are permitted. Abaye and Rava both said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the lenient opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>

### Part 5
Subsequently, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan stood</b> and adopted <b>the opinion</b> of <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> and prohibited both methods of dissolving. <b>Rabbi Elazar stood</b> and adopted <b>the opinion</b> of <b>Shmuel,</b> who prohibited using a vessel but permitted it by hand. Given these stances, <b>Abaye and Rava both said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who prohibited both methods.

### Part 6
The Gemara relates: <b>Abaye’s mother,</b> actually his foster mother, <b>prepared</b> mustard <b>for him, and he did not eat</b> it. <b>Ze’eira’s wife prepared</b> mustard <b>for Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi,</b> her husband’s student, <b>and he did not eat</b> it. <b>She said to him: I made</b> this <b>for your rabbi and he ate</b> it, <b>and you do not eat</b> it? <b>Rava bar Shabba said: I was standing before Ravina, and they stirred</b> mustard <b>for him with the inner part of the garlic, and he ate</b> it.

### Part 7
<b>Mar Zutra said: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with any of these statements. Rather, it is in accordance with this</b> one, <b>as it was stated: Mustard that one kneaded on Shabbat eve, on the following day he may dissolve it either by hand or with a vessel, and he may place honey in it. And</b> when he dissolves it <b>he may not beat</b> it forcefully as would a craftsman, <b>but</b> he may <b>mix</b> it gently.

### Part 8
<b>Cress that one ground on Shabbat eve, on the following day he may place oil and vinegar in it, and add <i>amita</i> into</b> the mixture, <b>and he may not beat</b> it, <b>but</b> he may <b>mix</b> it. Similarly, <b>garlic that one crushed on Shabbat eve, on the following day, he may place beans and grits in it, and he may not pound, but mix, and he may add <i>amita</i> into</b> the mixture. The Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>amita</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>mint. Abaye said: Learn from this</b> that adding <b>mint is beneficial for cress.</b>

### Part 9
We also learned in the mishna: <b>One may prepare <i>anumlin</i> on Shabbat. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may prepare <i>anumlin</i> on Shabbat. However, one may not prepare <i>aluntit</i>.</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>And what is <i>anumlin</i> and what is <i>aluntit</i>? <i>Anumlin</i></b> is a drink, which is a mixture of <b>wine, honey, and pepper. <i>Aluntit</i></b> is a mixture of <b>aged wine and clear water and balsam, which they prepare</b> for use after bathing in <b>a bathhouse to cool down</b> from the heat of the bathhouse. It is prohibited to prepare it on Shabbat because it is a form of remedy.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> On <b>one occasion, I followed Mar Ukva into a bathhouse. When I exited, he came</b> and <b>gave me one cup of</b> this <b>wine to drink, and I felt</b> its chill <b>from the hairs on my head</b> down <b>to the toenails on my feet. And if he had given me another cup to drink,</b> and if I would have survived it, <b>I would have feared a reduction of my merit in the World-to-Come.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t Mar Ukva drink</b> this wine <b>every day?</b> How was he not harmed? The Gemara answers: <b>Mar Ukva was different, as</b> he <b>grew accustomed to it.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not soak asafoetida in lukewarm water</b> to prepare a medicinal drink from it; <b>however, one may place</b> it <b>into vinegar</b> like a standard spice. <b>And one may not soak vetches</b> in water in order to separate them from their chaff, <b>nor rub them</b> by hand so as to remove their chaff. <b>However, one may place</b> them <b>into a sieve or into a basket,</b> and if the chaff gets removed, so be it.

### Part 12
<b>One may not sift straw in a sieve, and</b> similarly, <b>one may not place it on a high place so that that the chaff</b> blows away in the wind; <b>however, one may take</b> the straw <b>in a sieve and place it into the trough</b> of an animal, and one need not be concerned if the chaff is removed in the process.

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>If one</b> unwittingly <b>soaked</b> asafoetida on Shabbat, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Adda from</b> the city of <b>Naresh interpreted it before Rav Yosef: If one soaked</b> it, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Abaye said to him: But if that is so,</b> if <b>one soaked a piece of meat in water,</b> would you <b>also</b> say <b>that he is liable?</b> No cooking was performed at all. <b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> It is prohibited <b>by rabbinic decree,</b> so <b>that one will not conduct</b> himself on Shabbat <b>in the manner in which he conducts</b> himself <b>during the week.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised a dilemma before Rabbi Yannai: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to soaking asafoetida in cold water</b> on Shabbat? Rabbi Yannai <b>said to him: It is prohibited.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan asked: <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>One may not soak asafoetida in lukewarm</b> water, indicating that <b>it is permitted</b> to soak it <b>in cold</b> water?

### Part 16
Rabbi Yannai <b>said to him: If so, that</b> is the difference <b>between my</b> knowledge <b>and yours,</b> as I am able to analyze the <i>halakha</i> more profoundly. In this case, the mishna is not a reliable source, as <b>the mishna</b> expresses <b>an individual</b> opinion. <b>As it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One may neither soak asafoetida in hot</b> water <b>nor in cold</b> water. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: In hot</b> water it is <b>prohibited; in cold</b> water it is <b>permitted.</b> The mishna that does not prohibit cold water is in accordance with the individual opinion of Rabbi Yosei, but the <i>halakha</i> is not ruled based on that opinion.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> purpose <b>is</b> soaked asafoetida <b>prepared?</b> The Gemara answers: As a cure <b>for heaviness of the heart.</b> One who feels a pain in his heart drinks asafoetida. The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Aḥa bar Yosef felt heaviness in</b> his <b>heart. He came before Mar Ukva</b> to ask his advice. Mar Ukva <b>said to him: Go drink</b> the weight of <b>three shekels of asafoetida in three days. He went and drank on Thursday and Shabbat eve. In the morning, he went</b> and <b>asked in the study hall</b> if he could drink it on Shabbat. <b>They said to him:</b> The Sage <b>from the school</b> of <b>Rav Adda taught, and others say,</b> that the Sage <b>from the school</b> of <b>Mar bar Rav Adda taught: A person may drink</b> asafoetida on Shabbat, even <b>a <i>kav</i> or two <i>kav</i>, and he need not be concerned</b> about the decree prohibiting medicine, because asafoetida is drunk by healthy people as well.

### Part 18
Rav Aḥa bar Yosef <b>said to them:</b> With regard <b>to drinking, I have no dilemma. When I raised a dilemma,</b> it is with regard <b>to soaking</b> asafoetida; <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin said to them: There was an incident</b> that happened <b>with me, and I came</b> and <b>asked</b> that question <b>to Rav Adda bar Ahava, and he did not have</b> an answer for it. <b>I came</b> and <b>asked Rav Huna, and he said</b> that <b>this is what Rav is saying: One may soak</b> asafoetida <b>in cold water and place</b> it <b>in the sun</b> to warm it so it will be fit to drink.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: Was Rav’s ruling <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the one who permitted</b> soaking asafoetida in cold water? The Gemara answers: His ruling could be <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>the one who prohibited</b> doing so; <b>this</b> prohibition <b>applies only when he had not drunk</b> asafoetida <b>at all; however, here, since he drank</b> it <b>on Thursday and on Shabbat eve, if he does not drink on Shabbat he</b> would thereby be <b>endangered.</b> Therefore, he is permitted even to soak the asafoetida.

### Part 20
The Gemara relates another incident involving Rav Aḥa bar Yosef: <b>Rav Aḥa bar Yosef was walking</b> and <b>leaning on the shoulder of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, his sister’s son.</b> Rav Aḥa <b>said to him: When we arrive at Rav Safra’s house, bring me in. When they arrived,</b> Rav Naḥman <b>brought him in.</b> Rav Aḥa then <b>raised a dilemma before</b> Rav Safra: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> pertaining <b>to rubbing</b> and thereby softening <b>a linen shirt</b> that is hard after being laundered <b>on Shabbat?</b> Does <b>one intend to soften the shirt, and one may well</b> do so? <b>Or perhaps he intends to generate whiteness</b> in the shirt, <b>and it is prohibited?</b> Rav Safra <b>said to him: He intends to soften, and one may well</b> do so.

### Part 21
<b>When</b> Rav Aḥa <b>emerged</b> and <b>came</b> from Rav Safra’s house, Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: What dilemma did the Master raise before</b> Rav Safra? Rav Aḥa <b>said to him: I raised</b> the following <b>dilemma before him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> pertaining <b>to rubbing</b> and thereby softening <b>a linen shirt on Shabbat, and he said to me: One may well</b> do so.

### Part 22
Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak asked: <b>And let the Master raise</b> the same <b>dilemma</b> with regard to rubbing a <b>scarf.</b> He replied: <b>I did not raise the dilemma</b> with regard to a <b>scarf, as I raised it before Rav Huna. And he resolved it for me</b> and said that it is permitted (Rif).

### Part 23
Rav Naḥman asked him: <b>And let the Master resolve</b> the dilemma with regard to a shirt <b>from</b> Rav Huna’s ruling with regard to <b>a scarf.</b> Rav Aḥa <b>said to him:</b> There is a difference between the cases: <b>There,</b> in the case of a shirt, <b>it appears that one is generating whiteness,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> in the case of a scarf, <b>it does not appear that one is generating whiteness,</b> as people are not so particular with the whiteness of a scarf, and one’s intention is undoubtedly to soften it.

### Part 24
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> With regard to <b>this linen shirt,</b>
