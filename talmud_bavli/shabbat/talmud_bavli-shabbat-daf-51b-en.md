### Part 1
<b>he may not remove</b> the pot <b>and</b> then <b>return</b> it to its place.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The chaff of fine flax is like manure.</b> Therefore, one may not insulate food in it even on Shabbat eve.

### Part 3
<b>One may place a</b> copper <b>urn upon a</b> copper <b>urn, and</b> one may place <b>an</b> earthenware <b>pot upon an</b> earthenware <b>pot</b> because the lower utensil will not heat the upper one. <b>However,</b> one may <b>not</b> place <b>an</b> earthenware <b>pot upon a</b> copper <b>urn, or a</b> copper <b>urn upon an</b> earthenware <b>pot,</b> as in that case there is concern that the upper utensil will be heated by the lower one. <b>And one may seal the mouth</b> of a pot <b>with dough.</b> All of the above may <b>not</b> be undertaken <b>in order to heat</b> the water, <b>but only so that</b> its heat <b>will be maintained</b> and it will not cool down.

### Part 4
<b>And just as one may not insulate hot</b> food to keep it warm, <b>so too, one may not insulate cold</b> food to keep it cold. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permitted insulating cold</b> food on Shabbat.

### Part 5
<b>And one may neither crush snow nor hail on Shabbat so that its water will flow</b> and he will be able to drink it. That act involves creation of a new entity, water from ice, on Shabbat, which is prohibited. <b>However, he may place</b> the snow or the hail <b>into a cup or a dish</b> and allow it to melt on its own, <b>and he need not be concerned.</b>

### Part 7
Due to the mitzva to rest one’s animals on Shabbat, one’s animal may not go out into the public domain bearing a burden. However, an object designated to protect the animal or to prevent it from fleeing is not considered a burden; therefore, an animal bearing objects that serve that purpose may go out into the public domain.<br><br><strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna asks: <b>With what may an animal go out</b> into the public domain on Shabbat <b>and with what may it not go out? A camel may go out</b> on Shabbat <b>with an <i>afsar</i>, and a <i>naka</i></b> may go out <b>with a <i>ḥatam</i>, and a <i>luvdekim</i></b> may go out <b>with a <i>perumbiya</i>.</b> All these terms will be defined in the Gemara. <b>And a horse</b> may go out <b>with a chain</b> around its neck.

### Part 8
<b>And,</b> in general, <b>all</b> animals that typically <b>have a chain</b> around their necks when they go out to the public domain <b>may go out with a chain</b> on Shabbat <b>and may be pulled by the chain.</b>

### Part 9
If these chains contracted ritual impurity, <b>one may sprinkle</b> waters of purification <b>on them and immerse them in their place</b> on the animal, and they need not first be removed.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Several terms in the mishna were not clear to the Sages, and the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>naka</i> with a <i>ḥatam</i>? Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: A white female camel</b> (<i>ge’onim</i>) <b>with an iron nose ring.</b> And what is the meaning of <b><i>luvdekim</i> with a <i>perumbiya</i>? Rav Huna said: A Libyan donkey with an iron halter.</b>

### Part 11
Having mentioned a Libyan donkey, the Gemara relates that <b>Levi</b> once <b>sent money to Bei Ḥozai to procure for himself a Libyan donkey,</b> which is reputed to be of superior quality. <b>They bound</b> his money, returned it, and <b>sent him barley, to say that the strides of a donkey</b> depend <b>on the barley</b> that it eats. If one provides his donkey with better feed, its performance will be as good as that of a Libyan donkey.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The students <b>switched</b> the details in the mishna <b>before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi and asked: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>this</b> animal going out into the public domain <b>with</b> that which is permitted <b>for that</b> animal? For example, may a white female camel go out with a bit or a camel with an iron nose ring?

### Part 13
The Gemara explains: The case of <b>a white female camel</b> going out <b>with a bit should not be a dilemma for you; since it is not</b> sufficiently <b>secured by</b> a bit, <b>it is</b> regarded as <b>a burden</b> with which the animal may not go out. The case <b>where</b> there <b>should be a dilemma for you</b> is that of <b>a camel</b> going out to the public domain <b>with a nose ring. What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in that case? The Gemara explains the dilemma: Is the <i>halakha</i> that <b>since a bit</b> alone <b>suffices</b> to secure a camel, an iron nose ring <b>is</b> considered <b>a burden? Or,</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>perhaps</b> that with regard to a device that provides <b>excessive security we do not say</b> that <b>it is a burden?</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said before</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi that <b>so said father,</b> Rabbi Yosei: <b>Four animals</b> may <b>go out with a bit: The horse, and the mule, and the camel, and the donkey. What</b> does this list come <b>to exclude?</b> Is it <b>not</b> coming <b>to exclude a camel</b> going out <b>with a nose ring?</b> Apparently, the dilemma is resolved. The camel may go out only with a bit. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No</b>, the list comes <b>to exclude a white female camel</b> going out <b>with a bit.</b>

### Part 15
<b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: A Libyan donkey and a camel may go out with a bit.</b> The Gemara notes that the question whether or not an animal may go out into the public domain with excessive security is <b>parallel</b> to a dispute between <b>the <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A non-domesticated animal may not go out with a collar. Ḥananya says: It may go out with a collar and with anything that secures it.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara clarifies the case: <b>With what are we dealing</b> here? <b>If you say</b> that we are dealing <b>with a large non-domesticated animal, does a collar suffice for it?</b> Since it does not sufficiently secure the animal, it is considered a burden, and it is prohibited for the animal to go out with it on Shabbat. <b>Rather,</b> it must be dealing <b>with a small non-domesticated animal.</b> In that case, <b>doesn’t a collar suffice for it?</b> Why then does the anonymous first <i>tanna</i> hold that the animal may not go out with it?

### Part 17
<b>Rather, is it not</b> that <b>the</b> practical <b>difference between their</b> opinions <b>is</b> with regard to <b>a cat? The</b> anonymous <b>first <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>since a small rope suffices</b> for the cat, a collar <b>is</b> considered <b>a burden</b> with which the cat may not go out into the public domain. <b>And Ḥananya holds</b> that with regard to a device that provides <b>excessive security, we do not say that it is a burden.</b> The <i>tanna’im</i> disagree whether or not a device that provides excessive security is considered a burden. The Gemara concludes: <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya.</b> A device that provides excessive security is not considered a burden.

### Part 18
The Gemara relates that <b>Levi, son of Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya, and Rabba bar Rav Huna were</b> once <b>going</b> together <b>on a road. Levi’s donkey</b> on its own initiative <b>went ahead of the donkey of Rabba bar Rav Huna. Rabba bar Rav Huna was offended</b> because he was the greater Torah scholar, and he thought that Levi went first to assert that he considered himself the greater scholar. Levi <b>said</b> to himself: <b>I will say something to him, so that</b>
