<b>he may not remove</b> the pot <b>and</b> then <b>return</b> it to its place.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The chaff of fine flax is like manure.</b> Therefore, one may not insulate food in it even on Shabbat eve.

### Part 3
<b>One may place a</b> copper <b>urn upon a</b> copper <b>urn, and</b> one may place <b>an</b> earthenware <b>pot upon an</b> earthenware <b>pot</b> because the lower utensil will not heat the upper one. <b>However,</b> one may <b>not</b> place <b>an</b> earthenware <b>pot upon a</b> copper <b>urn, or a</b> copper <b>urn upon an</b> earthenware <b>pot,</b> as in that case there is concern that the upper utensil will be heated by the lower one. <b>And one may seal the mouth</b> of a pot <b>with dough.</b> All of the above may <b>not</b> be undertaken <b>in order to heat</b> the water, <b>but only so that</b> its heat <b>will be maintained</b> and it will not cool down.

### Part 4
<b>And just as one may not insulate hot</b> food to keep it warm, <b>so too, one may not insulate cold</b> food to keep it cold. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permitted insulating cold</b> food on Shabbat.

### Part 5
<b>And one may neither crush snow nor hail on Shabbat so that its water will flow</b> and he will be able to drink it. That act involves creation of a new entity, water from ice, on Shabbat, which is prohibited. <b>However, he may place</b> the snow or the hail <b>into a cup or a dish</b> and allow it to melt on its own, <b>and he need not be concerned.</b>
