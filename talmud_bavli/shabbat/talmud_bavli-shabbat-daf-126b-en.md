### Part 1
<b>that have a handle may be moved on Shabbat. And Rav Yehuda bar Sheila said</b> that <b>Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And that is</b> specifically when <b>the status of a vessel applies to them,</b> i.e., when the cover itself is suited for use as a vessel. This is contrary to the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who holds that preparation alone is sufficient.

### Part 2
<b>And if you say: Here, too,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is referring to a case where <b>the status of a vessel applies to</b> the reed, <b>does Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel require</b> that <b>the status of a vessel apply</b> to it? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>hard branches of a palm</b> tree <b>that one cut for firewood</b> or for construction <b>and</b> then <b>he reconsidered their</b> designation and decided to use them <b>for sitting, he must tie</b> the branches together on Shabbat eve so that they will not be set-aside. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: He need not tie</b> them together, and nevertheless, it is permitted to move them. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel does not require that one render it a vessel. Thought is sufficient.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <b>in one</b> matter <b>and disagrees with him in one</b> matter.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak taught at the entrance of the</b> house <b>of the Exilarch:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> in the matter of a window shutter. <b>Rav Amram raised an objection</b> from that we learned explicitly in a mishna: <b>And from their statements</b> and their actions, <b>we derived that one may seal</b> a window, <b>and measure, and tie</b> a knot <b>on Shabbat.</b> Apparently, one may shutter the window under any circumstances, not only when the shutter was prepared for use, as Rabbi Eliezer said.

### Part 5
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Amram: <b>What is your opinion,</b> that the proof is decisive because it <b>was taught</b> in the mishna <b>unattributed</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with an unattributed mishna? The mishna with regard to <b>a bolt that is dragged is also</b> an <b>unattributed</b> mishna. The <i>halakha</i> should be in accordance with that mishna as well. The Gemara concludes: <b>And even so, an action is greater.</b> Even though the two <i>mishnayot</i> are of equal weight, since one of them not only cites an unattributed opinion but also relates an incident where the Sages shuttered a window, that source is decisive.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All covers of vessels that have a handle may be moved on Shabbat. Rabbi Yosei said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> In the case of <b>a cover for the ground,</b> i.e., the cover of a pit; <b>however, with regard to covers of vessels, both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, even if they do not have handles, <b>they may be moved on Shabbat.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda bar Sheila said</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And this applies</b> specifically when <b>the status of a vessel applies to them</b> and they are suited for some use. The Gemara adds: <b>Everyone holds</b> that with regard to <b>a cover for the ground, if it has a handle, yes,</b> it is permitted to move it, and <b>if not, no,</b> it is prohibited to move it; with regard to <b>a cover of a vessel, even if it does not have a handle,</b> it is permitted to move it.

### Part 8
<b>When they disagree</b> in the mishna, it is with regard to <b>vessels that one attached to the ground. This Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>we issue a decree</b> according to which it is prohibited to move the cover of a vessel attached to the ground due to the concern that one will move a cover for the ground itself, <b>and that Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, <b>holds</b> that <b>we do not issue a decree.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Another version</b> of this statement: <b>When they disagree</b> in the mishna, it is with regard to <b>the cover of an oven; this Sage likens it to a cover for the ground, and this Sage likens it to a cover of a vessel.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> On Shabbat<b>, one</b> may <b>move even four or five baskets of straw and</b> baskets <b>of produce, due to the guests,</b> who require that place to sit<b>, and due to suspension</b> of Torah study in <b>the study hall,</b> where space is required to seat the students<b>. However,</b> one may <b>not</b> move these items to create space in <b>the storeroom.</b>

### Part 12
<b>One</b> may <b>move ritually pure <i>teruma</i>,</b> although it may only be eaten by a priest; <b>and doubtfully tithed produce</b> [<b><i>demai</i></b>], which may not be eaten until tithes are separated from it due to concern that an <i>am ha’aretz</i> did not separate its tithes; and <b>first tithe whose <i>teruma</i></b> of the tithe <b>has</b> already <b>been taken</b> and given to priests; <b>and second tithe and consecrated items that were redeemed; and</b> even <b>dry lupine,</b> which is not fit for consumption by a person, <b>because it is goat food.</b>

### Part 13
<b>However,</b> one may <b>neither</b> move <b>untithed produce, nor first tithe whose <i>teruma</i> has not been taken, nor second tithe and consecrated items that were not redeemed, nor</b> raw <b>arum and</b> raw <b>mustard,</b> as all of these items are not fit for consumption and are therefore set aside. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel permits</b> moving <b>in</b> the case of <b>arum because it is food</b> for <b>ravens.</b>

### Part 14
With regard to <b>bundles of straw, and bundles of wood, and bundles of twigs, if one prepared them</b> on Shabbat eve <b>for animal food, one may move them. And if not, one may not move them.</b>

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that the mishna stated that <b>one</b> may <b>move five</b> baskets, <b>is</b> mentioning <b>four</b> baskets <b>necessary?</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The mishna means that one may move <b>four</b> out <b>of five</b> baskets, but not all of them. <b>Some say:</b> It is permitted to move <b>four</b> baskets <b>from a small storeroom and five</b> baskets <b>from a large storeroom.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> then is the meaning of: <b>However,</b> one may <b>not</b> move these items to create space in <b>the storeroom?</b> It means that <b>one may not</b> use <b>the storeroom</b> for the <b>first time.</b> If he has never taken supplies from this storeroom, he may not begin moving baskets from it. <b>And whose</b> opinion is cited in this mishna? It is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who is</b> of the opinion that this constitutes a prohibition of <b>set-aside.</b> The contents of a storeroom that was never used are set-aside.

### Part 18
<b>And Shmuel says:</b> The difficulty in the mishna should be explained as a figure of speech: <b>Four and five,</b>
