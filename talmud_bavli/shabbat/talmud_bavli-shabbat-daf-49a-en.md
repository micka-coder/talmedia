### Part 1
<b>And the Sages issued a decree</b> that it should be considered a connection <b>with regard to ritual impurity</b> even <b>when not in use, due to ritual impurity when in use.</b> If one component becomes ritually impure, the other component becomes ritually impure as well. <b>And,</b> as a further stringency, they issued a decree that it is not considered a connection <b>with regard to sprinkling</b> even <b>when in use, due to sprinkling when not in use.</b> The water of purification must be sprinkled on each part individually.

### Part 2
The mishna listed several materials in which food may not be insulated on Shabbat eve <b>when</b> those materials <b>are moist. A dilemma was raised</b> before the Sages: Is the mishna referring specifically to materials that are <b>moist due to their own</b> natural state, <b>or</b> is it referring <b>perhaps</b> even to materials that <b>are</b> now <b>moist due to something else,</b> e.g., because they were soaked by liquid?

### Part 3
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from the materials listed in the mishna: <b>And</b> one may <b>neither</b> insulate a pot <b>in straw, nor in the residue of grapes</b> that have been pressed for their juice, <b>nor in soft materials, nor in grass, when these</b> materials <b>are moist. Granted, if you say</b> that the mishna is referring to materials that are <b>moist due to something else,</b> this can be <b>well</b> understood, as all of these materials can get wet. <b>However, if you say</b> that it is referring to materials that are <b>moist due to their own</b> natural state, <b>where do you find soft materials</b> that are <b>moist due to their own</b> natural state? Wool is dry in its natural state. The Gemara rejects this argument: The mishna is referring to a case where the material is made <b>from</b> wool <b>plucked</b> from <b>between the thighs</b> of the animal, as that wool is usually damp from sweat.

### Part 4
The Gemara continues with a similar question: <b>And that which Rabbi Oshaya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may insulate</b> a pot of hot food on Shabbat eve <b>in a dry garment and in dry produce, but not in a moist garment or in moist produce. Where do you find</b> a ruling pertaining to <b>a cloth that is moist due to its own</b> natural state? The Gemara answers: Here too, the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the cloth was made <b>from</b> wool <b>plucked</b> from <b>between the thighs</b> of the animal. The wool was spun and the cloth was woven while the wool was still moist. Consequently, there is no conclusive proof whether the materials listed in the mishna are prohibited only when naturally moist or even if they are moist due to another source.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One</b> may <b>insulate</b> a pot of hot food on Shabbat eve <b>in clothing, in produce, in doves’ wings, in a carpenter’s wood-shavings, and in the chaff of fine flax. Rabbi Yehuda prohibits</b> doing so when it is <b>fine, and permits</b> doing so when it is <b>coarse.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Since doves’ wings were mentioned in the mishna, the Gemara cites a related story: <b>Rabbi Yannai said:</b> Donning <b>phylacteries requires a clean body, like</b> that of <b>Elisha, Man of Wings.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the statement that donning phylacteries requires a clean body? <b>Abaye said:</b> It means <b>that one may not break wind</b> while donning <b>them. Rava said:</b> It means <b>that one may not sleep in them.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And why did they call</b> Elisha <b>Man of Wings? Because on one occasion the evil kingdom of Rome issued a decree against Israel that,</b> as punishment, <b>they would pierce the brain of anyone who dons phylacteries.</b> Nevertheless, <b>Elisha would don them and</b> defiantly <b>go out to the marketplace.</b> One day, <b>an official [<i>kasdor</i>]</b> who was appointed to enforce the decree <b>saw him;</b> Elisha <b>ran</b> away <b>from him, and</b> the official <b>ran after him. When</b> the official <b>reached him,</b> Elisha <b>removed</b> the phylacteries <b>from his head and held them in his hand.</b> The officer <b>asked him: What is that in your hand?</b> Elisha <b>said to him:</b> It is merely <b>a dove’s wings.</b> A miracle was performed: <b>He opened his hand, and,</b> indeed, it <b>was found</b> to be <b>a dove’s wings. Therefore,</b> in commemoration of this miracle, <b>they</b> would <b>call him Elisha, Man of Wings.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> about <b>doves’ wings from</b> those of <b>other birds</b> that led Elisha to say that he had doves’ wings in his hand? The Gemara answers: <b>Because the congregation of Israel is likened to a dove, as it is stated:</b> “You shall shine as <b>the wings of a dove covered with silver</b> and her pinions with yellow gold” (Psalms 68:14). <b>Just as this dove,</b> only <b>its wings protect it</b> and it has no other means of protection, <b>so too the Jewish people,</b> only <b>mitzvot protect them.</b>

### Part 9
We learned in the mishna: One may insulate food on Shabbat eve <b>in a carpenter’s wood-shavings,</b> and in the chaff of fine flax. Rabbi Yehuda prohibits doing so when it is fine, and permits doing so when it is coarse. <b>A dilemma was raised</b> before the Sages: Is the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda referring to the carpenter’s wood-shavings,</b> or is it <b>referring to the chaff of flax?</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The</b> legal status of <b>the chaff of fine flax is like</b> that of <b>manure,</b> i.e., it adds heat. The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude from it</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>is referring to the chaff of flax.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from it.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may insulate</b> cooked food on Shabbat eve <b>in</b> animal <b>hides and may move</b> those hides on Shabbat. So too, one may insulate food <b>in wool fleece and,</b> in contrast to hides, <b>one may not move</b> the fleece. <b>How,</b> then, <b>does one act</b> if he insulated food in fleece, and now wishes to remove the pot? <b>He lifts the cover,</b> which he is permitted to move, <b>and</b> the fleece <b>falls</b> by itself. He need not even touch it.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says:</b> If he placed the pot in <b>a basket</b> filled with fleece, <b>he leans</b> the basket <b>on its side</b> so that the fleece will fall to the side <b>and takes</b> the pot. Otherwise, there is concern <b>lest</b> the wool collapse when <b>he lifts</b> the pot from the basket. <b>And</b> then, <b>he will be unable to replace</b> the pot, as it is prohibited to move the wool to make room for the pot, since the wool is set-aside. <b>And the Rabbis</b> disagree and <b>say: He may take</b> the pot <b>and</b> afterward <b>replace it.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Akhinai and Rabbi Yonatan ben Elazar sat, and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥama sat with them, and they raised</b> the following <b>dilemma:</b> Did <b>we learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna that only <b>the hides of a</b> common <b>homeowner</b> may be moved; <b>however,</b> the hides <b>of a craftsman,</b> whose profession is processing hides, <b>since he is particular that they</b> not be ruined because they are essential to his work, <b>one may not move them</b> on Shabbat? <b>Or, perhaps, we learned</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna that even <b>the hides of a craftsman</b> may be moved, <b>and all the more so</b> that hides <b>of a</b> common <b>homeowner</b> may be moved.

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Elazar said to them: It</b> stands to <b>reason</b> that <b>we learned</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna with regard to <b>the hides of a</b> common <b>homeowner; however,</b> hides <b>of a craftsman</b> may not be moved, since <b>he is particular about them. Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥama said to them</b> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said as follows:</b>
