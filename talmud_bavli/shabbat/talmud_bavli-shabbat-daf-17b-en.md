### Part 1
<b>Tavi the bird hunter [<i>rishba</i>]</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The decree that <b>growths of <i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., produce that grows from <i>teruma</i> that was planted in the ground, are considered <i>teruma</i>, the Sages <b>also issued on that day.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this decree? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: A decree due to pure <i>teruma</i> in the hand of a</b> non<b>-</b>priest <b>Israelite.</b> One who seeks to avoid giving <i>teruma</i> to a priest would plant it in the ground and thereby negate its <i>teruma</i> status. To prevent him from doing so, the Sages decreed that that which grows from the <i>teruma</i> is also considered <i>teruma</i>. Consequently, one would gain nothing by replanting the <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 2
<b>Rava said: If they are suspected of that, let them refrain from separating <i>teruma</i></b> altogether. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> We know that with regard to <b>an Israelite,</b> as opposed to a Levite, fundamentally <b>it is possible to perform</b> the mitzva of <i>teruma</i> by separating merely <b>one grain of wheat, in</b> accordance with the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> who said that by Torah law there is no fixed measure for <i>teruma</i>. By separating one grain of wheat as <i>teruma</i> for all the wheat on the threshing floor, one fulfills his obligation. <b>Since he</b> nevertheless <b>did not</b> take advantage of that possibility to exempt himself from the obligation of separating <i>teruma</i>, <b>he is trustworthy,</b> and there is no reason to suspect that he will seek to avoid giving <i>teruma</i> to the priest by planting it. <b>Rather,</b> the reason for <b>the decree</b> is <b>due to impure <i>teruma</i> in the hand of a priest.</b> A priest is forbidden to eat impure <i>teruma</i> and he is required to burn it. However, the priest is permitted to derive benefit from its burning. The Sages were concerned <b>lest he keep</b> the impure <i>teruma</i> <b>with him</b> until the season of sowing and sow his field with it, <b>and,</b> as a result, <b>he encounter a stumbling-block</b> because over time he is liable to forget that the <i>teruma</i> is impure and eat it.

### Part 3
With regard to the total of eighteen decrees, the Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what is <b>the other</b> decree? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla:</b> In a case of <b>one who</b> was carrying a purse with money in it on Shabbat eve, and <b>it got dark</b> for him <b>on the way,</b> the Torah law permitted him to carry the purse in increments, each of which is less than four cubits. However, the Sages issued the following decree: It is prohibited to carry in increments; <b>he</b> should <b>give his purse to a gentile</b> accompanying him. This decree was <b>also issued on that day.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And the other</b> decree: The Sage <b>Bali said</b> that <b>Avimi of Sanvata said:</b> The decrees with regard to gentiles that prohibit <b>their bread, and their oil, and their wine, and their daughters are all</b> one decree <b>of the eighteen matters.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well</b> according <b>to Rabbi Meir,</b> as according to his opinion the Gemara already enumerated eighteen decrees. <b>However,</b> according <b>to Rabbi Yosei,</b> who holds that the dispute remains with regard to the matter of vessels in the courtyard, <b>they are</b> only <b>seventeen.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> also <b>that</b> statement of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Adda, as Rav Aḥa bar Adda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> The Sages <b>issued a decree</b> prohibiting eating <b>their bread due to their oil. And</b> they issued a decree prohibiting <b>their oil due to their wine.</b> Consequently, there are two separate decrees.

### Part 5
The Gemara wonders: They issued a decree <b>on their bread because of their oil.</b> In <b>what</b> way <b>is the</b> prohibition on <b>oil stronger than</b> the prohibition on <b>bread? Rather,</b> say that <b>they issued a decree</b> prohibiting <b>their bread and their oil due to their wine. And</b> they issued a decree prohibiting <b>their wine due to</b> the fact that it leads to familiarity, and people will come to marry <b>their daughters. And</b> they issued a decree prohibiting <b>their daughters due to something else,</b> idolatry. <b>And</b> they further issued a decree <b>on something else,</b> idolatry, <b>due to something else.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <b>something else</b> alluded to here? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: They issued a decree on a gentile baby,</b> according him the legal status <b>that he transmits impurity</b> as one <b>with the</b> legal status <b>of a</b> great <b><i>zav</i>,</b> who experienced three emissions, even though he did not experience an emission. This was in order to distance Jewish children from gentile children so <b>that a Jewish boy should not be accustomed to be with</b> a gentile <b>in homosexual relations.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> according <b>to Rabbi Meir</b> it is difficult <b>as well,</b> as <b>they are</b> now <b>nineteen</b> decrees. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Meir <b>counts</b> the decrees of <b>food</b> items <b>and vessels that became impure</b> through contact <b>with liquids as one.</b> Consequently, according to Rabbi Meir, too, there are only eighteen decrees.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In this mishna there is a fundamental dispute between Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai: Must one begin refraining from actions prohibited on Shabbat on Shabbat eve? Or, may one initiate an action prior to Shabbat, even if he knows that it will continue on its own on Shabbat itself? These are the details of that dispute: <b>Beit Shammai say: One may only soak</b> dry <b>ink</b> in water <b>and</b> dry plants, which produce <b>dyes,</b> in water <b>and vetch</b> for animal food to soften them in water on Shabbat eve, adjacent to Shabbat, <b>if</b> there is clearly <b>sufficient time for them to soak</b> for their designated purpose <b>while it is still day,</b> before Shabbat begins, and their continued soaking on Shabbat will have no effect. <b>And Beit Hillel permit</b> doing so. <b>Beit Shammai say: One may only place bundles of</b> combed <b>flax inside the oven</b> on Shabbat eve if there is sufficient time <b>so that they will be heated while it is still day. And</b> one may <b>only</b> place <b>wool into the</b> dyer’s <b>kettle if</b> there is <b>sufficient time for</b> the wool <b>to absorb the dye</b> while it is still day. <b>And Beit Hillel permit</b> doing so.

### Part 7
<b>Beit Shammai say: One may spread traps</b> for an <b>animal and birds and fish only</b> if there is sufficient time remaining in the day <b>for them to be trapped</b> in them <b>while it is still day, and Beit Hillel permit</b> doing so even if there is not sufficient time remaining in the day. <b>Beit Shammai say: One may only sell</b> an item <b>to a gentile</b> on Shabbat eve, <b>and</b> one <b>may only load</b> a burden on his donkey <b>with him, and</b> one <b>may only lift</b> a burden <b>on him if</b> there remains <b>sufficient time for</b> the gentile <b>to arrive to a near place</b> prior to Shabbat, and the Jew will play no role in the performance of a prohibited labor by the gentile on Shabbat. <b>And Beit Hillel permit</b> doing so. <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not give skins to a</b> gentile <b>tanner, nor clothes to a gentile launderer, unless</b> there is <b>sufficient time for</b> work on <b>them to be completed while it is still day,</b> before Shabbat begins. <b>And in all of them Beit Hillel permit</b> doing so <b>with</b>
