### Part 1
By inference: <b>If there is a wound on his foot, he may go out</b> with one sandal. In that case, <b>with</b> a sandal <b>on which of</b> his feet <b>does he go out? Rav Huna said:</b> With a sandal <b>on the</b> foot <b>that has a wound on it. Apparently, he holds: A sandal is made for the purpose</b> of avoiding <b>pain.</b> Typically, a person wears sandals only in order to avoid the pain of walking on stones and the like. When he is seen with only one sandal, it is clear that he is oblivious to that pain and the only reason that he is wearing the sandal is due to the wound on his foot. Consequently, no one will suspect that he went out wearing two sandals and that if he is wearing one, he must be carrying the other one.

### Part 2
<b>And Ḥiyya bar Rav said:</b> He goes out with a sandal <b>on the</b> foot <b>that does not have a wound on it. Apparently, he holds</b> that the sandal is <b>made for the purpose of</b> providing <b>comfort,</b> and he wears it on his healthy foot. <b>And</b> it does not arouse suspicion because, with regard to <b>that</b> foot <b>on which there is a wound, its wound indicates</b> that he is unable to wear a sandal on <b>that</b> foot, and it is clear that he left the other sandal at home.

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan also holds that</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna,</b> which maintains that one only wears sandals to avoid pain, is correct. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Rav Shemen bar Abba,</b> his attendant: <b>Give me my sandal. He gave him the right</b> sandal. <b>He said to him: You have rendered</b> this foot as one with <b>a wound.</b> In Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion, one must always put on his left shoe first. One who puts on the right shoe first is no longer permitted to put on the left shoe. By handing him his right sandal, he is forcing Rabbi Yoḥanan to go out with one sandal, leading onlookers to conclude that he has a wound on that foot. That incident corresponds to Rav Huna’s opinion that one wears the sandal on the wounded foot.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this: <b>And perhaps, he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav,</b> which maintains that one wears the sandal on the healthy foot, <b>and he is saying as follows:</b> By handing me my right shoe, <b>you have rendered</b> my left foot, on which I have no shoe, as one with <b>a wound.</b> No proof can be cited from that incident, as Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion cannot be ascertained from the exchange with his attendant.

### Part 5
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan follows his</b> regular line of <b>reasoning. As Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Just <b>as</b> one dons <b>phylacteries, so too,</b> one puts on <b>shoes. Just as phylacteries are</b> placed <b>on the left</b> arm, <b>so too,</b> when putting on <b>shoes</b> one begins <b>with the left</b> foot.

### Part 6
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When one puts on</b> his <b>shoes, he puts on the right shoe</b> first <b>and afterward puts on the left shoe.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Yosef said: Now that it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in <b>this</b> manner, <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan stated</b> the <i>halakha</i> in <b>that</b> manner, <b>one</b> who <b>acted this way acted</b> properly, <b>and one who acted that way acted</b> properly, as each custom has a basis.

### Part 8
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> Why is the Gemara certain that Rabbi Yoḥanan disagrees with the <i>baraita</i>? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Yoḥanan had not heard this <i>baraita</i>, and had he heard it, he would have retracted</b> his opinion. <b>And</b> even <b>if he heard it,</b> perhaps he heard it <b>and held that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with that mishna.</b> In any case, it is necessary to rule in accordance with one of the opinions.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: And one who fears Heaven fulfills both</b> opinions. <b>And who is this</b> God-fearing person? <b>Mar, son of Rabbana. How does he conduct</b> himself? <b>He puts on his right</b> shoe <b>and does not tie</b> the laces. <b>And</b> then <b>he puts on his left</b> shoe <b>and ties</b> it, <b>and</b> then afterward <b>ties</b> the laces <b>of his right</b> shoe. <b>Rav Ashi said: I saw that Rav Kahana was not particular</b> with regard to the order in which he put on his shoes.

### Part 10
After citing this excerpt from <i>Hilkhot Derekh Eretz</i> with regard to putting on shoes, the Gemara cites the entire matter. <b>The Sages taught: When one puts on</b> his <b>shoes, he puts on the right shoe</b> first <b>and afterward puts on the left shoe</b> because the right always takes precedence. <b>When he removes them, he removes the left and afterward he removes the right,</b> so that the right shoe will remain on the foot longer.

### Part 11
<b>When one washes</b> his feet, <b>he washes the right</b> first <b>and afterward he washes the left. And one who wishes to spread oil</b> on his feet <b>spreads oil on the right</b> first <b>and afterward spreads oil on the left. And one who wishes to spread oil on his entire body, spreads oil on his head first because it is the king of all his</b> other <b>limbs.</b>

### Part 12
We learned in the mishna: <b>And</b> he may <b>neither</b> go out <b>with phylacteries. Rav Safra said: Do not say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is only <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of the <b>one who said</b> that <b>Shabbat is not</b> an appropriate <b>time</b> to don <b>phylacteries,</b> i.e., it is prohibited to don phylacteries on Shabbat, and that is the reason that one may not go out into the public domain with them. <b>Rather, even according to the one who said</b> that <b>Shabbat is</b> an appropriate <b>time</b> to don <b>phylacteries, he may not go out</b> with them due to the concern <b>lest he come to carry them</b> in his hand <b>in the public domain,</b> which is prohibited by Torah law.

### Part 13
<b>And some teach</b> the statement of Rav Safra as referring <b>to the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And if he went out</b> into the public domain with phylacteries <b>he is not liable to bring a sin-offering. Rav Safra said: Do not say that</b> this <i>halakha</i> is only <b>according to</b> the opinion of the <b>one who said</b> that <b>Shabbat is</b> an appropriate <b>time</b> to don <b>phylacteries,</b> and therefore he does not violate a Torah prohibition by going out into the public domain with phylacteries and is not liable to bring a sin-offering. <b>Rather, even according to</b> the opinion of <b>one who said that Shabbat is not</b> an appropriate <b>time</b> to don <b>phylacteries, he is not liable to bring a sin-offering. What is the reason</b> that he is exempt? Donning phylacteries is <b>performed in the manner of</b> wearing <b>a garment</b> or an ornament. Although one may not use phylacteries on Shabbat, there is no Torah prohibition against moving them.

### Part 14
We learned in the mishna: <b>Nor with an amulet when it is not from an expert. Rav Pappa said: Do not say</b> that the meaning of the mishna is that one may <b>only</b> go out with an amulet <b>if the person</b> who wrote it <b>is an expert and the amulet</b> has proven <b>effective. Rather, if the person</b> who wrote it <b>is an expert, even though the amulet</b> has <b>not</b> proven <b>effective,</b> he may go out with it.

### Part 15
The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches: Nor with an amulet when it is not from an expert, and it does not teach: When</b> the amulet <b>is not effective.</b> Apparently, it is sufficient if the writer of the amulet is an expert, even if the effectiveness of the amulet has not been proven. The Gemara comments: Indeed, <b>learn from it.</b>

### Part 16
<b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>What is an effective amulet?</b> It is <b>any</b> amulet <b>that healed</b> one person once, <b>and</b> healed him <b>again, and</b> healed him <b>a third</b> time. That is the criterion for an effective amulet, and it applies to <b>both a written amulet and an amulet of</b> herbal <b>roots; both</b> if it has proven effective in healing <b>a sick person who is dangerously</b> ill, <b>and</b> if it has proven effective in healing <b>a sick person who is not dangerously</b> ill. It is permitted to go out with these types of amulets on Shabbat.

### Part 17
And an amulet was <b>not</b> only permitted in a case <b>where</b> one has already <b>fallen</b> due to epilepsy and wears the amulet in order to prevent an additional fall. <b>Rather,</b> even if one has never fallen, and he wears the amulet so that he <b>will not</b> contract the illness and <b>fall,</b> he is permitted to go out with it on Shabbat is permitted.

### Part 18
<b>And he may tie and untie</b> it <b>even in the public domain, as long as he does not tie it</b>
