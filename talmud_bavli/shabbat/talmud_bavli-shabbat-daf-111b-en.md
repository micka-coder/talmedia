### Part 1
<b>it is prohibited to insert</b> it <b>tightly on a Festival</b> due to the prohibited labor of wringing. Doesn’t Rabbi Shimon permit performing an unintentional act from which a prohibited labor may ensue? The Gemara answers: <b>In that</b> case, <b>even Rabbi Shimon concedes</b> that it is prohibited, <b>as it was Abaye and Rava who both said: Rabbi Shimon concedes in</b> instances categorized as: <b>Cut off its head and it shall not die.</b> This category refers to situations where the ensuing prohibited labor is inevitable. In those kinds of cases, one is liable even according to Rabbi Shimon. Since stuffing a cloth into a barrel will inevitably lead to wringing wine from it, Rabbi Shimon concedes that doing so is forbidden.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks again: <b>Didn’t Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi say</b> that <b>Rav said</b> explicitly: The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and Rav Ḥanan bar Ami</b> said that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. And Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin taught</b> the same tradition <b>without</b> mentioning the names of the <b>men</b> who cited the statements, but cited it directly: <b>Rav said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. Rather, Rava said: I and the lion of the group explained</b> this. <b>And</b> the Gemara asks: <b>And who is</b> the lion of the group? It is <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin.</b> He and Rava explained: The <b><i>halakha</i> is</b> indeed <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> but <b>not for his reason.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> exactly is the meaning of the statement: The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> but <b>not for his reason? If we say</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who permits</b> smearing rose oil, but <b>not for his reason, because Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that rose oil <b>heals, and Rav holds</b> that it <b>does not heal,</b> which is why he permits smearing it on Shabbat, then <b>does Rav hold</b> that rose oil <b>does not heal? From</b> the fact <b>that it is taught: Princes smear rose [<i>vered</i>] oil on their wounds; by inference,</b> it <b>heals. Rather,</b> it means: The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who <b>permits</b> rose oil, <b>but not for his reason. As Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that <b>although</b> rose oil <b>is uncommon</b> and expensive, and anyone who sees one smearing it realizes that it is for medicinal purposes, nevertheless, it is <b>permitted. And Rav holds</b> that <b>if</b> rose oil <b>is common</b> in a given place, <b>yes,</b> one may smear it on himself; <b>however, if</b> it is <b>not common</b> there, it is <b>not</b> permitted. <b>And in Rav’s place, roses were common,</b> and that is why he permitted smearing with rose oil on Shabbat. However, in a place where rose oil is uncommon, he concedes to the Rabbis, who prohibited doing so.
