### Part 1
<b>I will bury my sons</b> if <b>this is</b> not <b>a truncated <i>halakha</i>, i.e., that the one who heard</b> it, <b>heard</b> a halakhic ruling concerning a different situation <b>and erred.</b> He thought this <i>halakha</i> was established with regard to the following: Movable objects with the thickness of an ox goad transmit impurity to another vessel when the movable object is over both the source of impurity and the vessel at the same time. However, the original <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If <b>the farmer was passing and his ox goad was on his shoulder and one side of</b> the ox goad <b>covered the grave,</b> the Sages <b>deemed</b> the ox goad itself <b>impure due to</b> the impurity <b>of vessels that cover a corpse.</b> Any object located over a grave becomes impure. However, just because the ox goad itself became impure, this does not necessarily mean that it transmits impurity to other objects.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Akiva said: I will correct</b> and explain the <i>halakha</i> so <b>that the statements of the Sages will be upheld</b> as they were originally said, and this <i>halakha</i> will be explained as follows: <b>All movable objects transmit impurity to the person carrying them</b> if the objects are at least as thick as an ox goad. As will be explained below, there is room to decree that a round object with the circumference of an ox goad should have the legal status of a tent over a corpse. Something that serves as a covering over a corpse not only becomes impure itself, but also transmits impurity, as it is written: “Anything that is in the tent will become impure for seven days” (Numbers 19:14). Therefore, even the person carrying the ox goad becomes impure due to the ox goad. <b>And,</b> however, movable objects that covered the corpse bring impurity <b>upon themselves</b> by means of this makeshift tent <b>at any size,</b> and there is no minimum measure. <b>And,</b> however, those objects that cover the corpse do not transmit impurity <b>to other people</b> who are not carrying them. <b>And</b> the same is true with regard to <b>vessels,</b> unless the width of these vessels is at least <b>one handbreadth.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And Rabbi Yannai said: And the ox goad that they mentioned</b> is specifically one in which <b>its width is not a handbreadth and,</b> however, <b>its circumference is a handbreadth, and they,</b> the Sages, <b>issued a decree on its circumference due to its width.</b> If its width was a handbreadth it would transmit impurity as a tent by Torah law. Therefore, they issued a rabbinic decree with regard to an object whose circumference is a handbreadth. This is another of the eighteen decrees.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according <b>to Rabbi Tarfon, who said: I will bury my son</b> if <b>this is</b> not <b>a truncated <i>halakha</i>,</b> the tally of the decrees <b>is lacking,</b> and there are not eighteen. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The decree that the <b>daughters of</b> the <b>Samaritans are</b> considered to already have the status of <b>menstruating women from their cradle, they issued on that day. And in the other</b> matter of drawn water, <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> and thereby the tally of the decrees is complete.

### Part 5
<b>And another</b> of those decrees is the matter of <b>one who harvests</b> grapes in order to take them <b>to the press. Shammai says: It has become susceptible, and Hillel says: It has not become susceptible. Hillel said to Shammai:</b> If so, <b>for what</b> purpose <b>do they harvest</b> grapes <b>in purity,</b> i.e., utilizing pure vessels, as in your opinion, since the grapes are susceptible to impurity by means of the juice that seeps from them, care must be taken to avoid impurity while gathering; <b>and,</b> however, <b>they do not harvest</b> olives <b>in purity?</b> According to your opinion that liquid that seeps out renders the fruit susceptible to impurity, why is there not a similar concern with regard to the liquid that seeps out of olives?

### Part 6
Shammai <b>said to him: If you provoke me</b> and insist that there is no difference between gathering olives and grapes, then, in order not to contradict this, <b>I will decree impurity on the gathering</b> of olives <b>as well.</b> They related that since the dispute was so intense, <b>they stuck a sword in the study hall, and they said: One who</b> seeks to <b>enter</b> the study hall, <b>let him enter, and one who</b> seeks to <b>leave may not leave,</b> so that all of the Sages will be assembled to determine the <i>halakha</i>. <b>That day Hillel was bowed and was sitting before Shammai like one of the students.</b> The Gemara said: <b>And</b> that day <b>was as difficult for Israel as the day the</b> Golden <b>Calf was made,</b> as Hillel, who was the <i>Nasi</i>, was forced to sit in submission before Shammai, and the opinion of Beit Shammai prevailed in the vote conducted that day. <b>And Shammai and Hillel issued the decree, and</b> the people <b>did not accept it from them. And their students came</b> and <b>issued the decree, and</b> the people <b>accepted it from them.</b>

### Part 7
As to the essence of the matter, the Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> they decreed that liquids that seeped from the grapes unintentionally render the grapes susceptible to impurity? <b>Rabbi Ze’iri said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> The Sages issued <b>a decree</b> due to concern <b>lest he gather</b> the grapes <b>in impure baskets.</b> The impurity of the vessel would accord the liquid in it the status of a liquid that renders food items susceptible to impurity.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: This <b>works out well,</b> according <b>to the one who said</b> that <b>an impure vessel accords liquids</b> in it the halakhic status as if they were placed there willfully, and they render foods susceptible to impurity even if he did not want the liquids in the vessel. However, according <b>to the one who said</b> that <b>an impure vessel does not accord liquids</b> that status, <b>what can be said</b> in explanation of the decree? <b>Rather, Rabbi Ze’iri said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said</b> the following: The reason is not as we suggested; rather, this is <b>a decree</b> instituted by the Sages <b>lest he gather them in pitched baskets,</b> which are sealed. Since liquids that seep out of the grapes do not spill out of the baskets, it is opportune for him to have the liquids seep out of the grapes as he thereby accelerates the production of wine in the press. Because the seeping of the liquid is opportune, it renders the grapes susceptible to impurity.

### Part 9
<b>Rava said:</b> The reason for the <b>decree</b> is <b>due to the</b> case of liquid that squirted out when one separated clusters of grapes that were <b>stuck together</b>. Since he did so by his own hand, consciously and willfully, the liquid that seeps out renders the grapes susceptible to impurity. Just as <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: Sometimes a person goes to his vineyard</b> in order <b>to ascertain whether or not the grapes have reached</b> the time for <b>gathering, and he takes a cluster of grapes to squeeze it, and he sprays</b> the juice <b>onto</b> the <b>grapes.</b> Based on the quality of the juice, he determines whether or not the grapes are sufficiently ripe. If so, this grape juice was squeezed by his own hand willfully and it renders the grapes susceptible to impurity, as even <b>at the time of gathering</b> it is conceivable that the <b>liquid is still moist upon</b> the grapes.

### Part 10
Since all eighteen decrees decreed that day have not yet been enumerated, the Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what is <b>the other? Said</b>
