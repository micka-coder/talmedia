### Part 1
<b>every day</b> of the seven-day mourning period, <b>Rav Yehuda would take ten</b> people <b>and</b> they would <b>sit in his place,</b> in the house of the deceased. <b>After seven days</b> had passed the deceased <b>appeared</b> to <b>Rav Yehuda in his dream and said to him: Put your mind to rest, for you have put my mind to rest.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said: Everything people say before the deceased, he knows, until</b> the tomb <b>is sealed</b> with <b>the top-stone. Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>disagreed with regard to</b> the meaning of <b>this</b> statement. <b>One</b> of them <b>said</b> that the deceased is aware <b>until</b> the tomb <b>is sealed</b> with <b>the top-stone,</b> which is referring to the covering of the grave (<i>Tosafot</i>). <b>And one</b> of them <b>said</b> that it is <b>until the flesh decomposes.</b>

### Part 3
<b>The one who said</b> that it is <b>until the flesh decomposes</b> can support his position based on that <b>which is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“But his flesh grieves for him, and his soul mourns over him”</b> (Job 14:22). This indicates that the deceased is aware of the pain of his flesh in the grave. <b>The one</b> who <b>said</b> that the deceased is aware only <b>until</b> the tomb <b>is sealed</b> with <b>the top-stone</b> can support his view based on that <b>which is written</b> in a different verse: <b>“And the dust returns to the earth as it was,</b> and the spirit returns to God who gave it” (Ecclesiastes 12:7). This indicates that when the body returns to the earth, the spirit also returns to its place and is no longer aware of what is happening to the body.

### Part 4
<b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And the spirit returns to God who gave it”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:7) that the words: Who gave it, mean: As it was given. In other words, <b>give it to Him as He gave it to you;</b> just as He gave it to you <b>in purity, you too</b> should return it to God <b>in purity.</b> The Gemara cites <b>a parable of a king of flesh and blood who distributed royal garments to his servants. The wise ones folded them and placed them in a box [<i>kufsa</i>]</b> to protect them, whereas <b>the foolish ones went and worked in them.</b> After <b>a period of time the king requested</b> that <b>his garments</b> be returned to him. The <b>wise ones returned them to him pressed,</b> as they were when the servants received them, and <b>the foolish ones returned them dirty. The king was happy to greet the wise ones and angry to greet the foolish ones.</b>

### Part 5
<b>With regard to the wise ones he said: My garments shall be given</b> back <b>to the storehouse, and let them go to their homes in peace. And with regard to the foolish ones he said: My garments shall be given to the launderer, and they,</b> the fools, <b>will be locked up in prison</b> as a punishment for degrading the king’s garments for their own purposes.

### Part 6
<b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, also</b> acts in this way. <b>With regard to the bodies of the righteous,</b> which are likened to the royal garments that are well kept, <b>it states: “He enters into peace, they rest on their beds</b> each one that walks in his uprightness” (Isaiah 57:2). <b>And with regard to their souls, it states: “And the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life</b> with the Lord your God” (I Samuel 25:29). And conversely, <b>with regard to the bodies of the wicked, it states: “There is no peace, says the Lord, for the wicked”</b> (Isaiah 57:21), <b>and with regard to their souls, it states: “And the souls of your enemies He shall sling out in the hollow of a sling”</b> (I Samuel 25:29).

### Part 7
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The souls of the righteous are stored beneath the Throne of Glory, as it is stated: “And the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life”</b> (I Samuel 25:29). <b>And</b> the souls <b>of the wicked are continuously tied up, and one angel stands at</b> one <b>end of the world and another angel stands at</b> the other <b>end of the world and they sling the souls</b> of the wicked back and forth <b>to one another, as it is stated: “And the souls of your enemies He shall sling out in the hollow of a sling”</b> (I Samuel 25:29).

### Part 8
<b>Rabba said to Rav Naḥman: What</b> happens to the souls <b>of middling people,</b> who are neither righteous nor wicked? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> It is good that you asked me this question, for even <b>if I were dead I would not</b> have been able <b>to tell you</b> that. As <b>Shmuel said as follows: These and those,</b> the souls of the wicked and of the middling people, <b>are handed over to Duma,</b> the angel in charge of spirits. But <b>these,</b> the souls of the middling people, <b>have rest, and these,</b> the souls of the wicked, <b>do not have rest. Rav Mari said:</b> Even the bodies of <b>the righteous will</b> not be preserved and will <b>become dust, as it is written: “And the dust returns to the earth as it was”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:7).

### Part 9
The Gemara cites a related story: <b>The diggers who were digging in Rav Naḥman’s land</b> came upon a grave, and <b>Rav Aḥai bar Yoshiya,</b> who was buried there, <b>rebuked them. They came and said to Rav Naḥman: A</b> deceased <b>person</b> just <b>rebuked us.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>came and said to</b> the person buried there: <b>Who is the Master,</b> i.e., who are you? He <b>said to him: I am Aḥai bar Yoshiya.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> How has your body been preserved? <b>Didn’t Rav Mari say</b> that <b>the righteous will turn to dust?</b> Rav Aḥai <b>said to him: And who is Mari, whom I do not know?</b> Why should I be concerned about what he says? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> Even without Rav Mari’s statement, <b>there is an</b> explicit <b>verse which is written: “And the dust will return to the earth as it was”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:7).

### Part 10
Rav Aḥai <b>said to him: Whoever taught you</b> the book of <b>Ecclesiastes did not teach you</b> the book of <b>Proverbs, for it is written</b> in Proverbs: “A tranquil heart is the life of the flesh, <b>but envy is the rotting of the bones”</b> (Proverbs 14:30). This means that <b>anyone who has envy in his heart</b> during his lifetime, <b>his bones rot</b> in the grave, and <b>anyone who does not have envy in his heart, his bones do not rot.</b>

### Part 11
Rav Naḥman <b>touched him</b> and <b>saw that he had substance.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Let the Master arise</b> and come <b>into my house.</b> Rav Aḥai <b>said to him: You have revealed</b> that <b>you have not even studied Prophets,</b> and it is not just the Writings of which you are ignorant, <b>for it is written: “And you shall know that I am the Lord when I open up your graves</b> and lift you up from your graves, My nation” (Ezekiel 37:13). As long as the dead have not been instructed to leave their graves, leaving of their own accord is prohibited.

### Part 12
Rav Naḥman once again asked Rav Aḥai about the preservation of the flesh, and <b>he said: But it is written: “For you are dust and you shall return to dust”</b> (Genesis 3:19), so why has your body not turned into dust? He <b>said to him: That</b> verse applies to the righteous only <b>one hour before the resurrection of the dead,</b> so that they, too, may be created anew (Maharsha).

### Part 13
<b>A certain apostate</b> once <b>said to Rabbi Abbahu: You say</b> that <b>the souls of the righteous are stored beneath the Throne of Glory,</b> but if so, <b>how did the oracle woman raise up Samuel using necromancy</b> if his soul was no longer in this world? Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him: There, it was within twelve months</b> of his death, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: For <b>a full twelve months</b> a deceased person’s <b>body remains and his soul ascends and descends,</b> such that it is sometimes in this world with its body. <b>After twelve months, the body ceases</b> to exist
