### Part 1
Similarly, with regard to <b>awareness of ritual impurity,</b> there <b>are two</b> cases <b>that comprise four.</b> It is prohibited for one who is ritually impure to enter the Temple or to consume a consecrated item. However, one who unwittingly violates this serious prohibition is obligated to bring a sacrifice for his transgression only if he was clearly aware of his ritually impure status both before committing the transgression and thereafter. The two cases of unwitting transgression in this area are: One who was aware and then forgot that he is ritually impure, and then either ate consecrated meat or entered the Temple, and subsequently recalled that he was ritually impure. Two additional cases are: One who was aware of his ritually impure status but was unaware that the food he was about to eat was consecrated and ate it, or he was unaware that he was about to enter the Temple and entered it.

### Part 2
<b>Signs of affliction by leprosy</b> are <b>two that comprise four.</b> The Torah (Leviticus 13) mentions two types of signs of affliction with regard to leprosy, <i>baheret</i> and <i>se’et</i>. Two additional, secondary signs of affliction were added. They are not as white as those delineated in the Torah. Consequently, there are derivatives of both <i>baheret</i> and <i>se’et</i>.

### Part 3
The mishna in <i>Shevuot</i> also mentions that the acts of <b>carrying out on Shabbat are two</b> basic actions <b>that comprise four.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different here that</b> our mishna <b>teaches: Two that comprise four inside and two that comprise four outside, and what is different there,</b> in tractate <i>Shevuot</i>, <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> with regard to transfers on Shabbat: <b>Two that comprise four, and nothing more?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> in tractate <i>Shabbat</i>, which contains <b>the primary</b> discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of Shabbat,</b> the mishna <b>teaches the primary categories</b> of labor that are prohibited on Shabbat, including carrying out from the private to the public domain, and it <b>teaches the subcategories</b> of labor that are prohibited on Shabbat, including carrying from the public into the private domain. But <b>there,</b> in tractate <i>Shevuot</i>, which does <b>not</b> contain <b>the primary</b> discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of Shabbat,</b> the mishna <b>teaches the primary categories</b> of labor prohibited on Shabbat but <b>does not teach the subcategories</b> of labor.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the primary</b> categories of labor prohibited on Shabbat? They are acts of <b>carrying out</b> from the private domain to the public domain. However, the Gemara objects: The acts of <b>carrying out are</b> only <b>two</b> in number: There is the case of the homeowner who takes an object out of the private domain and places it in the hand of the poor person in the public domain and the case of a poor person who takes an object from the homeowner’s hand in the private domain and takes it out into the public domain. What are the two additional cases referred to by the phrase: Two that comprise four, in tractate <i>Shevuot</i>?

### Part 7
<b>And if you say</b> that the mishna in tractate <i>Shevuot</i> enumerates all four cases of carrying out, <b>among them</b> those <b>for</b> which there is <b>liability and among them</b> those <b>for</b> which there is <b>exemption,</b> including those mentioned in the second half of our mishna in which each individual performs only half of the prohibited labor, that is not feasible. The mishna in <i>Shevuot</i> <b>teaches</b> the prohibition of carrying out on Shabbat <b>parallel to the signs of affliction by leprosy. Just as there,</b> with regard to leprosy, <b>all</b> four <b>of them</b> are cases <b>for</b> which there is <b>liability, so too, here,</b> with regard to Shabbat, <b>all</b> four <b>of them</b> are cases <b>for</b> which there is <b>liability.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rather, Rav Pappa said</b> that the difference between the manner in which the <i>halakha</i> is cited in tractates <i>Shevuot</i> and <i>Shabbat</i> must be understood as follows: <b>Here,</b> where it contains <b>the primary</b> discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of Shabbat,</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> both cases of <b>liability and</b> cases of <b>exemption,</b> meaning cases of carrying out for which one is liable by Torah law as well as those for which one is exempt by Torah law. However, <b>there,</b> where it does <b>not</b> contain <b>the primary</b> discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of Shabbat,</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> cases of <b>liability</b> but <b>does not teach</b> cases of <b>exemption.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> the cases of <b>liability?</b> They are acts of <b>carrying out</b> from the private domain to the public domain. The Gemara objects on the grounds that there <b>are</b> only <b>two acts of carrying out:</b> Carrying out while standing inside and carrying out while standing outside. What is the meaning of the phrase in <i>Shevuot</i>: Which comprise four? The Gemara answers: It is possible to arrive at a total of four. Cases of carrying in from the public domain to the private domain are also enumerated in tractate <i>Shevuot</i>. Consequently, there are <b>two</b> cases <b>of carrying out and two</b> cases <b>of carrying in.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara objects: In <i>Shevuot</i>, the phrase: Acts of <b>carrying out, is taught</b> in the mishna, not acts of carrying in. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The <b><i>tanna</i></b> in <i>Shevuot</i> <b>also refers to carrying in as carrying out.</b>

### Part 11
<b>From where</b> do I know this? <b>From that which we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One who carries out</b> an object <b>from one domain to another is liable. Are we not</b> also <b>dealing</b> with a case <b>where he is carrying</b> it <b>in from the public domain to the private domain, and</b> nevertheless the mishna <b>characterizes it</b> as <b>carrying out?</b>

### Part 12
<b>And what is the reason</b> that the term carrying out is used to refer to an act of carrying in? <b>The <i>tanna</i> characterizes any</b> act that involves <b>lifting of an object from its place</b> and transferring it to another domain as <b>carrying out.</b> Carrying out does not refer only to carrying an object out from one’s house. Rather, it is a general depiction of moving an object from the domain in which it is located into another domain.

### Part 13
<b>Ravina said: Our mishna is also precise,</b> and its language leads us to the same conclusion, <b>as</b> the expression: Acts of <b>carrying out</b> on Shabbat, <b>was taught</b> in our mishna, yet <b>immediately</b> a case of <b>carrying in is articulated.</b> The first case listed in our mishna involves the poor person placing an object into the hand of the homeowner, which is a case of carrying in from the public to the private domain. The Gemara notes: Indeed, <b>conclude from this</b> that the term carrying out also refers to carrying in.

### Part 14
<b>Rava said:</b> The language of the <i>mishnayot</i> poses no difficulty. The <i>tanna</i> in both of these <i>mishnayot</i> did not teach: Acts of carrying out on Shabbat. Rather, <b>he taught: Domains</b> of Shabbat. The correct version of the mishna is: <b>The domains of Shabbat are two</b> that comprise four, and, according to this <i>tanna</i>, there are four instances of prohibited labor in these two domains, inside and outside.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Mattana said to Abaye:</b> The mishna speaks of two that comprise four inside and two that comprise four outside, for a total of eight. Yet there is a difficulty: <b>Are these eight</b> cases? <b>They are twelve.</b> Upon closer inspection, in the four cases in the latter part of the mishna, the homeowner and the poor person each performs an individual action contributing to the overall prohibited labor of carrying in or carrying out. Consequently, there are four actions in the first part of the mishna and eight actions in the second part.

### Part 16
Abaye responded: <b>According to your reasoning, they are sixteen</b> actions, as even in the first part of our mishna, the one who receives the object and the one who places the object each participates in the performance of a prohibited action. Therefore, there are a total of sixteen actions.

### Part 17
Rav Mattana <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>That is not difficult,</b> as <b>granted</b>,
