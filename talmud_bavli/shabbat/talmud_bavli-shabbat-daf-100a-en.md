### Part 1
<b>it is not</b> considered <b>its placement.</b> However, <b>Rava raised a dilemma:</b> In a case where there is <b>a nut in a vessel and the vessel is floating on water, what</b> is the ruling? Is it permitted to lift the nut on Shabbat if one is in another domain? The two sides of the dilemma are: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>we go according to the</b> status of the <b>nut, and</b> it <b>is at rest</b> in the vessel? <b>Or perhaps we go according to</b> the status of the <b>vessel, and it is not at rest.</b> No resolution was found to this dilemma. Therefore, <b>let it stand</b> unresolved as well.

### Part 2
However, with regard to <b>oil</b> floating <b>on wine,</b> there is <b>a dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri and the Rabbis. As we learned</b> in a mishna: In the case of <b>oil floating on wine, and one who immersed himself during the day,</b> i.e., one who was impure, immersed himself in a ritual bath, but will not become completely pure until sunset, <b>touched the oil, he invalidated only</b> the <b>oil</b> and not the wine. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says:</b> With regard to <b>the two,</b> i.e., the oil and the wine, they are considered to have <b>a connection to each other.</b> Since he made the oil impure, the wine is also impure. Their dispute is whether or not the oil is considered to be placed atop the wine.

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said:</b> In the case of <b>a pit in the public domain</b> that is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>deep and</b> precisely <b>eight</b> handbreadths <b>wide, and one threw a mat into it, he is liable.</b> However, if <b>he divided</b> the pit <b>with a mat</b> that split it in two, each one slightly less than four handbreadths wide, <b>he is exempt</b> because neither part is considered a private domain. The Gemara comments: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye, for whom it is obvious</b> that <b>the mat eliminates the partition</b> of the pit, <b>all the more so that a segment</b> of dirt thrown into a pit that is ten handbreadths deep, rendering it less than ten handbreadths, <b>eliminates the partition,</b> and he has no dilemma with regard to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s case. According to <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who raised a dilemma with regard to a segment</b> of dirt, <b>it is obvious that a mat does not eliminate the partition.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said:</b> With regard to <b>a pit in the public domain</b> that is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>deep and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide</b> and <b>filled with water,</b> and <b>one threw</b> an object <b>into it</b> on Shabbat, <b>one is liable</b> because the pit is considered a private domain. And if the pit was <b>filled with fruit and one threw</b> an object <b>into it, he is exempt. What is the reason</b> for the different rulings? <b>Water is not</b> significant enough to <b>eliminate the partition; fruit eliminates the partition. This was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who throws</b> an object <b>from the sea to the street or from the street to the sea is exempt</b> because the sea is considered a <i>karmelit</i>, and one is not liable according to Torah law in that case. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: If</b> the <b>area</b> in the sea <b>where he threw</b> it <b>is ten</b> handbreadths <b>deep and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide, he is liable,</b> as he is considered as one who threw an object into a private domain. Apparently, the water in the sea does not eliminate the status of a private domain.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who throws</b> an object <b>four cubits</b> in the public domain, if the object hits <b>the wall above ten handbreadths</b> from the ground, which is an exempt domain, it is <b>as if one threw it in the air,</b> and he is exempt. If it hits the wall <b>below ten handbreadths</b> from the ground, it is <b>as if he threw it</b> and it landed <b>on the ground, and one who throws</b> an object <b>four cubits</b> and it lands <b>on the ground is liable.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that if one throws an object in the public domain a distance of four cubits and it hits a wall above ten handbreadths from the ground, he is liable if he threw it. The Gemara asks: <b>And we discussed it:</b> How could he be liable for carrying in that case? Since the object <b>did not come to rest</b> on the wall, there was no placement. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>a juicy cake of figs</b> that sticks to the wall when thrown against it that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said:</b> If <b>one threw</b> a stone at a wall <b>above ten</b> handbreadths from the ground, <b>and it went and came to rest in a hole</b> in the wall <b>of any size</b> less than four handbreadths, <b>we have come to the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis. According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said: One carves out</b> the space <b>to complete</b> it, <b>he is liable.</b> We complete the hole by conceptually carving it to four handbreadths because doing so is theoretically possible. Since the hole is considered ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide, one is liable for transferring an object from a public domain to a private one. <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say: One does not carve out</b> the space <b>to complete</b> it, the thrower <b>is not liable</b> because the hole is actually less than four handbreadths wide at present. <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one threw</b> an object <b>above ten</b> handbreadths, <b>and it went and came to rest in a small hole, Rabbi Meir deems</b> him <b>liable, while the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> In the case of <b>a mound</b> that is an inclined plane that gradually <b>attains</b> a height of <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>over</b> a horizontal space of <b>four</b> cubits, <b>and one threw</b> an object from the public domain and it <b>came to rest atop</b> that mound, <b>he is liable</b> because it is considered a partition. <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An alleyway that is level inside and becomes an inclined</b> or declined plane as it enters <b>the public domain,</b> which is higher or lower than the alleyway, <b>or</b> if the entrance to the alleyway is <b>level</b> when entering <b>the public domain and inside it</b> is <b>inclined, that alleyway requires neither a post</b> alongside its entrance <b>or a beam</b> across its entrance in order to distinguish it from the public domain because the incline itself is considered a partition. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says:</b> In the case of a <b>mound</b> that gradually <b>attains</b> a height of <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>over</b> a horizontal space of <b>four</b> cubits, <b>and one threw</b> an object from the public domain and it <b>came to rest atop</b> that mound, <b>he is liable.</b>

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one threw</b> an object in the public domain, intending for it to land <b>within four cubits,</b> meaning that he had no intention of violating the Torah prohibition of carrying, <b>and</b> the object <b>rolled</b> and went <b>beyond four cubits, he is exempt.</b> However, if one threw an object with the intention of it landing <b>beyond four cubits, and</b> the object <b>rolled</b> back <b>within four cubits, he is liable</b> from when he originally threw the object.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that if one threw an object beyond four cubits and it rolled back within four cubits, he is liable. The Gemara asks: The object <b>did not come to rest</b> beyond four cubits, so how can the one who threw it be liable? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And that</b> liability was established <b>when</b> the object <b>came to rest atop something. That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one threw</b> an object <b>beyond four cubits and the wind blew it</b> while still in the air <b>and brought it</b> within four cubits, <b>he is exempt even though it,</b> i.e., the wind, <b>then brought it back out</b> because the object did not come to rest in the place where it was thrown. However, if <b>the wind seized it briefly</b> and it stayed on the ground for a brief period of time (<i>Tosafot</i>), <b>even though</b> the wind <b>then brought it in,</b> the individual <b>is liable.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rava said:</b> Despite the principle of <i>lavud</i>, which states that <b>within three</b> handbreadths of the ground an object is considered to be attached to it, <b>according to the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that an object in airspace is not considered at rest, the object <b>must come to rest atop something</b> to establish liability. The Gemara relates that <b>Mareimar sat and stated this <i>halakha</i>. Ravina said to Mareimar:</b>
