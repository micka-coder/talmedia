### Part 1
<b>similar to</b> the case of <b>an amulet</b> worn for healing purposes. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that this is the correct understanding.

### Part 2
The Gemara further examines the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier. <b>The Master said: Nor</b> may an animal go out <b>with an amulet</b> on Shabbat, <b>even if</b> the amulet <b>proved effective.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: One may <b>not</b> go out on Shabbat <b>with an amulet that has not proved effective?</b> By inference: If the amulet <b>proved effective,</b> he may <b>well</b> do so. The Gemara answers: <b>Here too</b>, it is referring to an amulet <b>that has not proved effective.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>Doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach: Even if</b> the amulet <b>proved effective?</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to an amulet that <b>proved effective for a person, and did not prove effective for an animal.</b> The Gemara wonders: <b>Is there</b> an amulet that <b>proved effective for a person and is not effective for an animal?</b> Healing an animal should be easier than healing a person. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> an amulet <b>aids a person, who is under</b> the protection of <b>an</b> advocate <b>angel [<i>mazal</i>];</b> however, <b>it does not aid an animal, which is not under</b> the protection of <b>an</b> advocate <b>angel.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara poses a question: <b>If so,</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to an amulet that did not prove effective for an animal, but if the amulet proved effective, the animal may indeed go out into the public domain with it; <b>what</b> is the meaning of the phrase in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>And this is a stricture</b> that applies <b>to animals beyond</b> the strictures that apply <b>to people?</b> The <i>halakha</i> is the same with regard to both people and animals. If the amulet has proven effective, even an animal may go out with it on Shabbat. If it has not proven effective, even a person may not go out with it. The Gemara responds: <b>Do you hold</b> that <b>this</b> statement <b>is referring to an amulet? It is referring to a shoe;</b> an animal may not go out with a shoe on Shabbat, but a person may.

### Part 5
With regard to whether and to what extent the discomfort of animals is a factor taken into consideration on Shabbat, the Gemara says: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may smear</b> on <b>oil and scrape</b> off a scab on Shabbat <b>for a person, and one may not smear</b> on <b>oil and scrape</b> off a scab <b>for an animal. Is it not</b> referring here to a case <b>where there is a wound, and</b> he smears on oil <b>and</b> scrapes the scab <b>due to</b> the <b>discomfort</b> caused by the wound, and nevertheless it was permitted exclusively for a person and not for an animal? The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where the wound has</b> already <b>ceased</b> and healed, and he smears oil and scrapes <b>due to</b> the <b>pleasure</b> caused by the treatment.

### Part 6
The Gemara cites an additional proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an animal</b> suffering from heart <b>congestion</b> that restricts its <b>blood</b> supply and whose temperature has risen, <b>one may not stand it in water so that it will cool</b> off. However, with regard to <b>a person</b> suffering from heart <b>congestion</b> that restricts his <b>blood</b> supply, <b>one</b> may <b>stand him in water so that he will cool</b> off. Apparently, the suffering of an animal is of no concern. <b>Ulla said:</b> Here, the Sages issued <b>a decree</b> prohibiting all healing on Shabbat <b>due to the crushing of herbs</b> for medicinal purposes, which is prohibited by Torah law. The Sages prohibited cooling the animal in water lest one come to grind the ingredients used in the preparation of medicine.

### Part 7
<b>If so,</b> the same decree should <b>also</b> apply in the case of <b>a person.</b> It should be prohibited to stand a sick person in water to cool him off due to the rabbinic prohibition against engaging in healing on Shabbat. The Gemara answers: In the case of <b>a person, it appears as</b> if he entered the water merely <b>to cool</b> off, not necessarily to cure an illness.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>If so</b>, say in the case of <b>an animal as well</b> that <b>it appears as</b> if it entered the water merely <b>to cool</b> off<b>,</b> not necessarily to cure an illness. The Gemara answers: <b>An animal</b> does <b>not</b> typically enter the water on its own to <b>cool</b> off. Neither does one typically stand an animal in water to cool it off unless it serves some healing purpose. Apparently, due to a decree, the Sages were stringent and prohibited standing the animal in water even if it will die as a result.

### Part 9
The Gemara now asks: <b>Do we</b> really <b>issue a decree for an animal? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If an animal <b>were standing beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit,</b> a situation in which it is prohibited to go fetch it, <b>he may call</b> the animal <b>and it will come</b> to him on its own? <b>And we do not issue a decree</b> to prohibit calling the animal, <b>lest he come to bring it</b> himself. Apparently, the Sages did not issue a decree in a case where one could incur a loss and there is no actual transgression committed. Here too, it should not be prohibited to stand his animal in water due to a decree lest he come to grind herbs and thereby violate a Torah prohibition.

### Part 10
<b>And Ravina said:</b> No proof can be cited from this case, as here it is a situation <b>where</b> the animal’s Shabbat <b>limit was subsumed within</b> the <b>limit</b> of its owner. The animal strayed beyond its own Shabbat limit, which is determined by the Shabbat limit of the shepherd entrusted with its herding. However, the animal remained within the Shabbat limit of its owner, which extended beyond that of the shepherd. Consequently, the owner is permitted to call the animal so that it will return on its own. Even if he forgets and goes out to fetch the animal, he will not have gone beyond his Shabbat limit. The fact that the animal itself went beyond its Shabbat limit is of no concern.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The matter of the decree due to <b>crushing herbs is itself</b> subject to a dispute between <b>the <i>tanna’im</i>. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>an animal that ate vetch,</b> which caused a life-threatening case of constipation, <b>one may not run it</b> around <b>in the courtyard to loosen</b> its bowels due to the decree prohibiting healing. <b>Rabbi Oshaya deems</b> it <b>permitted.</b> Apparently, the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree whether or not healing is prohibited with regard to animals. The Gemara adds that <b>Rava taught:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Oshaya.</b>

### Part 12
<b>The Master said: Neither may a <i>zav</i> go out with his pouch,</b> which prevents his clothes from becoming sullied by his emissions, <b>nor goats with the pouch that is on their udders.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>Goats may go out with the pouch that is on their udders?</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a pouch <b>that is</b> tied <b>tightly</b> to the udder. It is permitted because there is no concern that the pouch will fall. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a pouch <b>that is not tightly</b> tied. It is prohibited because of the concern that the pouch will fall and a person will come to retrieve it.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Yosef said: Have you removed the <i>tanna’im</i> from the world?</b> This is subject to a disagreement between <b>the <i>tanna’im</i></b>, <b>as we learned</b> in our mishna: <b>She-goats may go out</b> with their udders <b>bound. Rabbi Yosei Rabbi Yosei prohibits</b> the animals from going out <b>with all</b> of <b>these</b> items, as he considers them burdens, <b>except for the ewes that are <i>kevunot</i>. Rabbi Yehuda says: Goats may go out</b> on Shabbat with their udders <b>bound to dry</b> their milk supply and discontinue their lactation in order to facilitate conception, as in that case, they are tied with a tight, permanent knot. <b>However,</b> they may <b>not</b> go out with their udders bound <b>to</b> conserve the <b>milk,</b> as in that case they are bound loosely. Apparently, there are <i>tanna’im</i> who rule leniently with regard to attaching pouches to the udders of goats and permit the practice, and others prohibit doing so.

### Part 15
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> were taught <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> nevertheless it is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where the goats are permitted to go out with a pouch on their udders, the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where it was done <b>to dry</b> their milk supply. <b>There,</b> where goats are prohibited to do so, the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where it was done <b>to</b> conserve <b>the milk</b>.

### Part 16
The Gemara adds: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving the goats</b> belonging to the residents of <b>a house in Antioch whose udders were</b> especially <b>large</b> and they would drag along the ground. <b>And they made pouches for them so that their udders would not get scratched.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara cites a related <i>baraita</i> in which the <b>Sages taught:</b> There was <b>an incident where one</b> man’s <b>wife died, and she left</b> him <b>a son to nurse</b>, <b>and he did not have</b> money to pay <b>the wages of a wet-nurse. And a miracle was performed on his behalf, and he developed breasts like the two breasts of a woman, and he nursed his son.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Rav Yosef said: Come and see how great this person is that a miracle</b> of <b>that</b> magnitude <b>was performed on his behalf. Abaye said to him: On the contrary, how dishonorable is this person that the order of creation was altered on his behalf.</b> A miracle was indeed performed on his behalf; however, it was performed in a demeaning and unpleasant manner.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Yehuda</b> added and <b>said: Come and see how difficult</b> it is to provide for <b>a person’s sustenance.</b> It is so difficult <b>that the order of creation had to be altered on</b> his <b>behalf,</b> which was apparently easier than providing him a source of financial support. <b>Rav Naḥman said: Know</b> that it is so, <b>as miracles are</b> often <b>performed</b> on a person’s behalf; <b>however,</b> it has <b>not</b> yet happened that <b>food was</b> miraculously <b>created</b> in a person’s home.

### Part 20
The Gemara relates another unusual story. <b>The Sages taught:</b> There was <b>an incident involving one man who married a one-armed woman, and he did not realize</b> that she was one-armed <b>until the day that she died. Rav said: Come and see how modest this woman was that her husband did not realize</b> this <b>about her. Rabbi Ḥiyya said to him: That is</b> typical <b>conduct</b> for <b>her,</b> as a woman typically covers herself. All the more so a one-armed woman makes sure to cover her defect. <b>Rather,</b> say: <b>How modest was this man that he did not recognize</b> this <b>in his wife.</b>

### Part 21
We learned in our mishna: <b>Rams may go out <i>levuvin</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>levuvin</i>? Rav Huna said: Tied [<i>tutri</i>]</b> in pairs. The Gemara explains: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that this</b> word <b><i>levuvin</i> is a term of closeness? As it is written: “You have drawn me near [<i>libavtini</i>], my sister my bride”</b> (Song of Songs 4:9).

### Part 22
<b>Ulla said:</b> <i>Levuvin</i> refers to animal <b>hide that one ties over the hearts</b> [<i>lev</i>] of rams <b>so that wolves will not attack them</b>. The Gemara asks: Do <b>wolves attack rams</b> but <b>do not attack ewes?</b> Why is this protection provided only to males? The Gemara answers: <b>Because</b> the males <b>walk at the head of the flock.</b> The Gemara asks: Do <b>wolves attack the head of the flock</b> but <b>not the rear of the flock? Rather,</b> the wolves prey specifically on the rams <b>because they are plump</b>. The Gemara asks: <b>Are there no plump</b> ones <b>among the ewes? And furthermore, do</b> the wolves <b>know</b> how to distinguish <b>between these,</b> the plump ones, and <b>those,</b> the thin ones? <b>Rather,</b> the wolves prey specifically on the rams <b>because they raise their noses and walk while looking</b> to both sides. The wolves think that they are preparing to attack them.

### Part 23
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b>: <i>Levuvin</i> refers to animal <b>hide that one ties under their male</b> organ <b>so that they will not mount the females. And from where</b> do we derive that meaning? <b>Because the latter clause states: Ewes may go out <i>sheḥuzot</i>. What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>sheḥuzot</i>?</b> It means <b>that they fasten [<i>she’oḥazin</i>] their tails</b> with animal hide <b>so that the males may mount them</b> more easily. It is reasonable to explain that <b>the first clause</b> refers to an action undertaken <b>so that the males will not mount the females, and the latter clause</b> to an action undertaken <b>so that the males will mount them.</b>

### Part 24
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> may it <b>be inferred that this</b> word <b><i>sheḥuzot</i> is a term of exposure?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written</b> in the description of a wicked woman: <b>“And behold there met him a woman</b>
