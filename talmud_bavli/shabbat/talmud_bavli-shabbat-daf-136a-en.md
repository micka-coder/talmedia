### Part 1
If so, with regard to <b>circumcision, how can we circumcise him?</b> Perhaps he is a stillborn and one may not desecrate Shabbat for his circumcision.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said: One may circumcise him whichever way you look at it,</b> based on the following calculation: <b>If he is</b> a child who will <b>live,</b> the circumcisor <b>may well circumcise</b> the child, <b>and if not,</b> if the child is a stillborn and the circumcisor <b>is</b> merely <b>cutting flesh,</b> one who cuts the flesh of a corpse or the flesh of one with the legal status of a corpse is not considered to have made a wound, and therefore has not performed a prohibited labor.

### Part 3
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And however,</b> with regard to <b>that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether he was <b>born after seven</b> months of pregnancy, and <b>uncertainty</b> whether he was <b>born after eight</b> months, <b>one does not desecrate Shabbat on his</b> behalf and circumcise him. The Gemara asks: <b>Why? Let us circumcise him</b> on Shabbat, as <b>whichever way you look at it,</b> that is appropriate. <b>If he is</b> a child that will <b>live,</b> the circumcisor <b>may well circumcise</b> the child, <b>and if not, he is</b> merely <b>cutting</b> the <b>flesh</b> of a corpse, which does not violate any Shabbat prohibitions.

### Part 4
<b>Mar, son of Ravina, said: Rav Naḥumei bar Zekharya and I interpreted</b> this as follows: Indeed, as for <b>circumcision</b> itself, <b>we</b> do <b>indeed circumcise</b> that child even on Shabbat. It <b>was only necessary</b> to say that one does not desecrate Shabbat on his behalf <b>with regard to</b> the issue of preparing <b>facilitators of circumcision</b> on Shabbat, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> that actions that facilitate circumcision at its appointed time override Shabbat.

### Part 5
<b>Abaye said:</b> The issue of whether a child who has not yet survived thirty days from his birth is considered viable is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b>the <i>tanna’im</i></b> with regard to the interpretation of the verse: <b>“And if any animal of which you may eat shall die,</b> one who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The verse is interpreted as coming <b>to include offspring of eight</b> months. Large domesticated animals typically give birth after a gestation period of nine months. If an animal of that sort gives birth after eight months, its offspring is deemed to be not viable and <b>its slaughter does not purify it.</b> Rather, it assumes the status of an unslaughtered animal, which is not only prohibited to be eaten, but also transmits ritual impurity to those who touch or move it. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, say: Its slaughter purifies it,</b> and it does not assume unslaughtered animal status.

### Part 6
<b>What, is it not that this</b> is the matter with regard to which <b>they disagree? That</b> this <b>Master holds</b> that the animal <b>is</b> considered <b>alive</b> and therefore its slaughter is effective, as is the case with regard to all pure animals, <b>while</b> this <b>Master,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that it <b>is</b> considered <b>dead.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rava said: If so, instead of disagreeing over</b> the issue of <b>impurity and purity, let them disagree over</b> the issue of <b>eating,</b> i.e., whether it is permitted to eat this offspring after it is slaughtered. Since they did not dispute this point, their disagreement must revolve around a different factor.

### Part 8
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is</b> considered <b>dead,</b> yet <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, hold</b> that it has the legal status <b>like</b> that of <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> an animal with a condition that will cause it to die within twelve months. With regard to a <b><i>tereifa</i>, is it not that even though it is</b> considered <b>dead</b> from the perspective of <i>halakha</i> because there is no possibility of long-term survival, nevertheless, if it is slaughtered, <b>its slaughter purifies it?</b> It does not cause ritual impurity like an unslaughtered animal, even though it may not be eaten. <b>Here too, it is no different. And the Rabbis,</b> who do not accept this claim, say: <b>It is not similar to a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> since <b>a <i>tereifa</i> had a period of fitness</b> before it became a <i>tereifa</i>. However, <b>this</b> animal that was born after eight months of pregnancy <b>did not</b> ever <b>have a period of fitness.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And if you say:</b> With regard to an animal that was a <b><i>tereifa</i> from the womb</b> and was born in that condition, <b>what is there to say?</b> It too never had a period of fitness. There is a distinction between the cases. <b>There,</b> with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>there is slaughter in its type; here,</b> with regard to a stillborn, <b>there is no slaughter in its type,</b> as there is no circumstance where slaughter of a stillborn animal is appropriate.

### Part 10
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Do the Rabbis disagree with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> who holds that any animal that survived for eight days after birth is presumed viable, <b>or not? If you say</b> that they <b>disagree,</b> the dilemma is: <b>Is</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> in accordance with his</b> opinion, <b>or is</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> not in accordance with his</b> opinion?

### Part 11
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from that which we learned: With regard to a <b>calf that was born on a Festival, one may slaughter</b> it <b>on</b> the <b>Festival.</b> Apparently, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s opinion is not accepted, and one need not wait eight days after the animal is born. The Gemara refutes this: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is a case in <b>which one is certain that its months</b> of gestation <b>were completed,</b> and therefore, it is certainly not stillborn.

### Part 12
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from that which we learned: Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, who disagreed with regard to whether or not it is permitted to inspect firstborn animals for blemishes on a Festival, <b>agree that if</b> a firstborn animal <b>was born with its blemish, it is</b> considered <b>prepared</b> for use on the Festival. It is not deemed set-aside and an expert may examine it to determine whether or not it is a permanent blemish. Apparently, a firstborn animal may be slaughtered on the day of its birth. The Gemara refutes this proof as well: It is a case in <b>which one is certain that its months</b> of gestation <b>were completed,</b> and it is certainly not stillborn.

### Part 13
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to the dilemma, <b>as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> in this matter <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b> Nonetheless, from the fact that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> was ruled in accordance with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>by inference,</b> the Sages <b>disagree</b> with his ruling. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from this</b> the resolution to both dilemmas raised above.

### Part 14
<b>Abaye said:</b> With regard to a baby less than thirty days old that <b>fell off a roof or was eaten by a lion, everyone agrees</b> that <b>he is</b> considered to have been <b>alive;</b> it was a viable baby that died in the accident. <b>Where they disagree is</b> in a case where the baby <b>yawned,</b> i.e., breathed momentarily after birth, <b>and</b> then immediately <b>died.</b> This <b>Master,</b> the Rabbis, <b>hold:</b> The baby <b>is</b> considered to have been <b>living,</b> since it was born alive; <b>and</b> this <b>Master holds: It is</b> considered to have been born <b>dead</b> until it lives a month after its birth.

### Part 15
<b>What</b> practical <b>difference is there</b> whether or not the baby is considered to have been alive? The difference is <b>to exempt</b> the child’s mother <b>from levirate marriage.</b> If a man died with no children, and his wife was pregnant and a viable child was born, the woman is exempt from levirate marriage; however, if the child was born dead, the man is considered to have died childless, and his widow is obligated in levirate marriage.

### Part 16
The Gemara raises a difficulty: Is that to say that if the child <b>fell off a roof or was eaten by a lion, everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is</b> considered to have been <b>alive? Didn’t Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, happen</b> to come <b>to the house of the son of Rav Idi bar Avin, and he prepared for them a third-born calf on the seventh day</b> after its birth. <b>And they said to him: Had you waited</b> to slaughter <b>it until the evening, we would have eaten from it. Now</b> that you did not wait, <b>we shall not eat from it.</b> Apparently, if a calf is slaughtered before it was alive for eight days and definitely viable, suspicion that it is stillborn remains; the same is true of a child who dies from an accident within thirty days of birth.

### Part 17
<b>Rather,</b> Abaye’s statement must be reformulated: <b>When</b> the baby <b>yawned and died, everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is</b> considered to have been <b>dead</b> from the outset. <b>Where they disagree is in</b> a case <b>when it fell off a roof or was eaten by a lion:</b> This <b>Master,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>holds: It is</b> considered to have been <b>dead; and</b> this <b>Master holds</b> that since it did not die on its own, <b>it is</b> considered to have been <b>alive.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara relates: <b>A baby was born to the son of Rav Dimi bar Yosef. Within thirty days</b> the baby <b>died. He sat</b> and <b>mourned over him. His father,</b> Rav Dimi bar Yosef, <b>said to him:</b> Are you mourning because <b>you wish to partake of the delicacies fed to mourners?</b> The <i>halakha</i> deems a child that dies before thirty days stillborn, and one does not mourn over it. <b>He said to him: I am certain that its months</b> of gestation <b>were completed.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara similarly relates that <b>Rav Ashi happened</b> to come <b>to Rav Kahana’s house. A matter befell him,</b> i.e., his child died <b>within thirty days</b> of its birth. Rav Ashi <b>saw him</b> and observed <b>that he was sitting and mourning over him. He said to him: Doesn’t the Master hold</b> in accordance with <b>that which Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> that only a child who lived for thirty days is not considered stillborn? <b>He said to him: I am certain that its months</b> of gestation <b>were completed</b> and he is not to be considered a stillborn.

### Part 20
<b>It was stated</b> that the Sages discussed the following question: What is the ruling in a case where a baby <b>died within thirty days</b> after birth, leaving its mother a childless widow, <b>and</b> before they decided whether or not she was obligated in levirate marriage, <b>she stood and was betrothed</b> to another? <b>Ravina said in the name of Rava:</b>
