### Part 1
<b>what did the Elders,</b> i.e., the Sages of that generation, do that was considered a <b>sin? Rather, say:</b> God will enter into judgment <b>with the Elders because they did not protest</b> the sinful conduct of <b>the princes.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yehuda was sitting before Shmuel</b> when <b>this woman came</b> and <b>cried before</b> Shmuel about an injustice that had been committed against her, <b>and</b> Shmuel <b>paid no attention to her.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> Shmuel: <b>Doesn’t the Master hold</b> in accordance with the verse: <b>“Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard”</b> (Proverbs 21:13)? He <b>said to him: Big-toothed one, your superior</b>, i.e., I, your teacher, <b>will be</b> punished <b>in cold water. The superior of your superior will be</b> punished <b>in hot water. Mar Ukva, who sits as president of the court,</b> is responsible for those matters.

### Part 3
And from where is it derived that this responsibility is incumbent upon the house of the Exilarch? <b>As it is written: “House of David, so says the Lord: Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor, lest My fury go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings”</b> (Jeremiah 21:12). The Exilarch is a direct descendant of the house of David.

### Part 4
With regard to the issue of reprimand, it was related that <b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Simon: Let the Master reprimand</b> the members of <b>the house of the Exilarch,</b> as Rabbi Simon had some influence over them. Rabbi Simon <b>said to him: They will not accept</b> reprimand <b>from me.</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Let my master reprimand them even if they do not accept</b> it.

### Part 5
<b>As Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Never did</b> a promise manifesting <b>a good attribute emerge from the mouth of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and He</b> later <b>retracted it</b> and rendered it <b>evil, except</b> with regard to <b>this matter, as it is written: “And the Lord said to him: Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark [<i>tav</i>] upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry on account of all the abominations that are done in her midst”</b> (Ezekiel 9:4).

### Part 6
<b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to</b> the angel <b>Gabriel: Go and inscribe a <i>tav</i> of ink on the foreheads of the righteous</b> as a sign <b>so that the angels of destruction will not have dominion over them. And</b> inscribe <b>a <i>tav</i> of blood on the foreheads of the wicked</b> as a sign <b>so that the angels of destruction will have dominion over them</b>.

### Part 7
<b>The attribute of justice said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, how are these different from those? He said to</b> that attribute: <b>These are full-fledged righteous</b> people <b>and those are full-fledged wicked</b> people. The attribute of justice <b>said to Him: Master of the Universe</b>, <b>it was in</b> the <b>hands</b> of the righteous <b>to protest</b> the conduct of the wicked, <b>and they did not protest.</b>

### Part 8
<b>He said to</b> that attribute: <b>It is revealed and known before Me that</b> even <b>had they protested the</b> conduct of the wicked, <b>they would not have accepted</b> the reprimand <b>from them.</b> They would have continued in their wicked ways. The attribute of justice <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, if it is revealed before You</b> that their reprimand would have been ineffective, <b>is it revealed to them?</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, retracted His promise to protect the righteous and decided that those who failed to protest would also be punished.

### Part 9
<b>And that is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Slay utterly old and young, both maid, and little children, and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at My Sanctuary”</b> (Ezekiel 9:6). <b>And it is written</b> in that same verse: <b>“Then they began with the elderly men who were before the house.” Rav Yosef taught: Read not: My Sanctuary [<i>mikdashi</i>], rather: Those sanctified to Me [<i>mekudashai</i>]. These are people who observed the whole Torah in its entirety from <i>alef</i> through <i>tav</i>. And immediately: “And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lies toward the north, and every man with his weapon of destruction in his hand; and one man among them was clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkwell by his side; and they went in and stood beside the bronze altar”</b> (Ezekiel 9:2).

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Was there a bronze altar</b> in the Temple in the time of Ezekiel? Already in the days of Solomon there was only a stone altar. Rather, this should be understood as a figure of speech. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: Begin from the place where they recite songs</b> of praise <b>before Me</b>. This is a reference to the Levites in the Temple whose musical instruments are made of bronze. <b>And who are the six men</b> mentioned here? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Fury, Wrath, and Rage, and Destroyer, and Breaker, and Annihilator,</b> six angels of destruction.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks further: <b>And what is different</b> about the letter <b><i>tav</i>,</b> that it was inscribed on the foreheads of the righteous? <b>Rav said: <i>Tav</i></b> is the first letter of the word <b><i>tiḥye</i>, you shall live,</b> indicating that the righteous shall live. <b><i>Tav</i></b> is also the first letter of the word <b><i>tamut</i>, you shall die,</b> indicating that the wicked shall die. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> The letter <i>tav</i> is the first letter of the word <i>tama</i>, ceased, indicating that the <b>merit of the Patriarchs has ceased</b> and will not help the wicked. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The letter <i>tav</i> is the first letter of the word <i>taḥon</i>, will have mercy, indicating <b>that</b> due to <b>the merit of the Patriarchs</b> God <b>will have mercy</b> on the righteous.

### Part 12
<b>And Reish Lakish said:</b> The letter <b><i>tav</i></b> is <b>the last</b> letter <b>of the seal of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> as <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: The seal of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is truth [<i>emet</i>],</b> which ends with the letter <i>tav</i>. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said:</b> The letter <i>tav</i> teaches that <b>these are people who observed the entire Torah from <i>alef</i> through <i>tav.</i></b>

### Part 13
With regard to the statement that the merit of the Patriarchs has ceased, the Gemara asks: <b>From when did the merit of the Patriarchs cease? Rav said: From the days of</b> the prophet <b>Hosea, son of Beeri, as it is stated:</b> “And now <b>I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of My hand”</b> (Hosea 2:12). Israel will no longer be saved by the merit of the Patriarchs.

### Part 14
<b>And Shmuel said</b>: The merit of the Patriarchs ceased <b>since the days of Hazael, as it is stated: “And Hazael, king of Aram, oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz”</b> (II Kings 13:22). <b>And it is written</b> there: <b>“And the Lord was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and turned toward them because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and would not destroy them; neither has He till now cast them away from His presence”</b> (II Kings 13:23). That was the last time that the merit of the Patriarchs was mentioned.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> The merit of the Patriarchs ceased <b>since the days of Elijah</b> the Prophet<b>, as it is stated: “And it came to pass at the time of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the Prophet came near and said, Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word”</b> (I Kings 18:36). By inference: Let it be known this day and not afterward because the merit of the Patriarchs will cease today.

### Part 16
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The merit of the Patriarchs ceased <b>since the days of Hezekiah, as it is stated: “For the increase of the realm and for peace without end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice; from now and forever the zeal of the Lord of hosts performs this”</b> (Isaiah 9:6). That is to say, from this point on, the merit of the Patriarchs will not protect Israel, leaving only the zeal of the Lord.

### Part 17
The Gemara continues its discussion of punishment in general and the relationship between a person’s actions and the punishments meted out against him in particular: <b>Rav Ami said: There is no death without sin;</b> were a person not to sin, he would not die. <b>And there is no suffering without iniquity.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara adduces proof to these assertions: <b>There is no death without sin, as it is written: “The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him”</b> (Ezekiel 18:20). A person dies only because of his own sins and not because of some preexistent sin. And <b>there is no suffering without iniquity, as it is written: “Then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with strokes”</b> (Psalms 89:33).
