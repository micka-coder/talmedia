<b>and I do not know whether</b> the Festival occurred <b>before</b> Shabbat <b>or after</b> Shabbat. <b>And they came before Rabbi Yoḥanan, and he said to them: Let gentiles attend to his</b> burial.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> likewise, <b>Rava said:</b> If a person <b>died on the first day of a Festival, gentiles may attend to his</b> burial; <b>on the second day of a Festival</b> observed in the Diaspora, <b>Jews may attend to his</b> burial. <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even on the second day of the festival of Rosh HaShana, which is not so with regard to an egg.</b> With regard to an egg laid on the Festival, the two days of Rosh HaShana are considered one long day that cannot be disconnected. Therefore, in contrast to other two-day Festivals in the Diaspora, use of an egg laid on the first day of Rosh HaShana is prohibited on the second day. However, in deference to the dead, the Sages were lenient with regard to burial on the second day of Rosh HaShana. Why then did Rav Menashya prohibit the inhabitants of Bashkar from attending to the burial on a Festival? The Gemara answers: <b>Because they were not</b> well versed in <b>Torah.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Avin bar Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gureya said: A person may wrap himself in a canopy and in its straps and go out to the public domain on Shabbat, and he need not be concerned</b> about violating the prohibited act of carrying out a burden.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the straps <b>different from that</b> which <b>Rav Huna</b> said? <b>As Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: One who goes out</b> unwittingly to the public domain <b>on Shabbat with a</b> four-cornered <b>garment that does not have the requisite ritual fringes attached is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering,</b> because the remaining fringes are not an integral part of the garment. Since they do not fulfill the mitzva, they are considered a burden that may not be carried into the public domain on Shabbat. The Gemara answers: There is a distinction between the cases. <b>Ritual fringes are significant relative to a garment and are not negated.</b> They are considered an independent entity that may not be carried out into the public domain. <b>These</b> straps of a canopy <b>are not significant and are negated.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said:</b> According to the Rabbis, who prohibit suspending a strainer on a Festival, <b>a person</b> may nevertheless <b>employ artifice</b> and circumvent the prohibition against suspending <b>a strainer</b> by taking it <b>on a Festival</b> and <b>suspending it</b> for the purpose of <b>pomegranates in it,</b> which is permitted. Once the strainer is suspended, he may <b>suspend it</b> in order to filter <b>sediment</b> from the wine, as even the Rabbis hold that on a Festival it is permitted to do this straining through a strainer that is already suspended. <b>Rav Ashi said: And this</b> is only permitted provided <b>that he</b> actually <b>suspended pomegranates in it</b> before using it to strain wine. It must be obvious to all that he used the strainer in a permitted manner.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> that <i>halakha</i> <b>different from that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may begin brewing beer during</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival for the purpose of</b> using it on <b>the Festival.</b> If it is <b>not for the purpose of the Festival, it is prohibited.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>both</b> with regard to <b>date beer and</b> with regard to <b>barley beer.</b> And <b>even though they have old</b> beer, <b>one may employ artifice and</b> say that he wishes to <b>drink from the new,</b> and that he is making beer on the intermediate days of the Festival for that purpose. Apparently, it is permitted to employ artifice even without actively demonstrating that one is performing the action for a permitted purpose. This contradicts the opinion of Rav Ashi.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to beer, <b>the matter is not evident.</b> When people see someone starting to brew beer, they have no way of knowing whether or not he has beer at home, and consequently, whether or not the action itself is prohibited in that case. However, <b>here,</b> with regard to a strainer, <b>the matter is evident,</b> as people see him suspending a strainer for wine, which is prohibited.

### Part 8
On the topic of artifice, the Gemara relates that <b>the Rabbis said to Rav Ashi: Master, observe this Torah scholar, and Rav Huna ben Rabbi Ḥayon is his name, and some say</b> that <b>his name is Rav Huna, son of Rabbi Ḥalvan, who took a slice of garlic and placed it in the spout of a barrel, and said: I intend to store it.</b> He thereby stopped the spout on Shabbat. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>he went and slept in a ferry</b> on the river, and the ferryman sailed the ferry across the river, <b>and he</b> thereby <b>crossed to the other side and inspected the fruit</b> of his vineyard. He said: <b>I intend to sleep.</b> In this way, he crosses the river by boat on Shabbat, which is a prohibited activity.

### Part 9
Rav Ashi <b>said to them: Are you speaking of artifice? This is artifice</b> employed to circumvent <b>a rabbinic</b> prohibition, <b>and a Torah scholar will not come to perform</b> the action <b><i>ab initio</i></b> without artifice. Therefore, there is no reason to prohibit him from doing so.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may pour water over sediment</b> that is in a strainer on Shabbat <b>so that it will become clear</b> and clean. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>one may filter wine through cloths and through an Egyptian basket</b> made from palm leaves. Since these liquids are drinkable even without filtering, doing so does not violate the prohibition of selecting.

### Part 11
<b>And</b> likewise, <b>one may place an egg in a mustard strainer</b> in order to separate the yolk from the egg-white, <b>and one may prepare <i>anumlin</i>,</b> a wine-based drink, <b>on Shabbat. Rabbi Yehuda says: On Shabbat</b> one may only make <i>anumlin</i> in a small <b>cup; on a Festival, in a</b> larger <b>vessel; and on the intermediate days of a Festival,</b> one may even prepare it <b>in a barrel. Rabbi Tzadok says:</b> There is no objective principle; rather, <b>it is all according to the</b> number of <b>guests;</b> if they are numerous, one may prepare a larger quantity of <i>anumlin</i>.

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Ze’iri said: A person may place clear wine and clear water into a strainer on Shabbat, and he need not be concerned</b> over the prohibition of selecting, as the wine is drinkable even without this filtering. <b>However,</b> doing so with <b>murky</b> liquids, <b>no,</b> one may not strain them.

### Part 13
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A person may stir a barrel of wine,</b> mixing <b>its wine and its sediment, and place it in a strainer on Shabbat, and he need not be concerned.</b> Apparently, it is permitted to place even murky wine in a strainer. <b>Ze’iri explained that</b> <i>baraita</i> and resolved the difficulty: <b>That was taught</b> with regard to wine <b>between the presses,</b> when the wine has yet to ferment and will remain murky even after filtering.

### Part 14
We learned in the mishna: <b>One may filter wine through cloths</b> on Shabbat. <b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya said:</b> This is permitted <b>provided one does not make an indentation</b> in the cloth, making it into a receptacle, as one must diverge from the usual, weekday manner of performing this activity.

### Part 15
We also learned in the mishna: <b>And</b> it is permitted to filter wine on Shabbat <b>through an Egyptian basket. Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said</b> the following caveat to that statement: It is permitted <b>provided one does not lift</b> the basket <b>a handbreadth from the bottom of the</b> lower <b>vessel.</b> This ensures that one performs the activity in an atypical manner (Rabbeinu Yona).

### Part 16
<b>Rav said: It is permitted</b> to place <b>this cover</b> that has holes for filtering <b>over half a barrel,</b> but <b>it is prohibited</b> to spread it <b>over the entire barrel,</b> in order that it not appear as though one is using it as a filter (Rabbeinu Ḥananel).

### Part 17
<b>Rav Pappa said: A person may not attach a bundle of straw to the mouth of a barrel’s spigot, because it appears like a strainer.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara relates: The members <b>of Rav Pappa’s household would carefully pour beer from one vessel to another</b> so that the dregs from one vessel would not pass to the other. <b>Rav Aḥa from Difti said to Ravina: But there are the</b> final <b>drops,</b> which remain when one pours the beer into another vessel. When pouring the final drops from the dregs left in the vessel, one is in violation of the prohibition of selecting. He replied: In Rav Pappa’s house they would leave the final drops in the first vessel together with the dregs. They would not attempt to separate them, as <b>the last drops were not significant to the household of Rav Pappa,</b> because beer was always readily available in his house.

### Part 19
<b>And</b> we further learned in the mishna: <b>One may place an egg in</b> a mustard <b>strainer</b> on Shabbat in order to separate the yolk from the egg-white. The Sage, <b>Ya’akov Korḥa, taught</b> a reason for this:
