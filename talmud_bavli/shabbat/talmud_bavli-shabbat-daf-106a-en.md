### Part 1
<b>all of the brothers should be concerned,</b> lest their death be approaching. Similarly, if <b>one member of a group dies, the entire group should be concerned. Some say</b> the concern is greatest if the <b>eldest dies.</b> If he, despite his virtues, could not avoid punishment, others will certainly not be saved. <b>And some say</b> the concern is greatest if the <b>youngest dies,</b> because the least significant people are punished first, and perhaps this is the start of a punishment for the entire group.

### Part 2
We learned in the mishna: <b>And anyone who performs</b> labors <b>destructively</b> on Shabbat <b>is exempt. Rabbi Abbahu taught</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan: Anyone who performs</b> labors <b>destructively</b> on Shabbat <b>is exempt, except for one who inflicts a wound or kindles</b> a fire. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Go teach</b> that <b>outside.</b> This <i>baraita</i> is not fit for discussion in the study hall. The opinion that deems one liable for <b>inflicting</b> a wound <b>or kindling</b> a fire on Shabbat <b>is not an</b> accepted <b>teaching</b> and should be ignored. <b>And if you want to say</b> that it is <b>a</b> legitimate <b>teaching, one who inflicts a wound</b> would only be liable <b>in</b> a case where <b>he needed</b> the blood to give <b>to his dog,</b> and <b>one who kindles</b> a fire would only be liable <b>in</b> a case where <b>he needs its ashes.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: How could Rabbi Abbahu teach this <i>baraita</i>? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> explicitly in the mishna: <b>Anyone who performs</b> labors <b>destructively</b> on Shabbat <b>is exempt,</b> including one who inflicts a wound or who kindles a fire? The Gemara answers: In his opinion, <b>the mishna</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who deems one liable for performing labor which is not needed for its own sake, whereas the <b><i>baraita</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who exempts in that case. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason that Rabbi Shimon</b> deems one who inflicts a wound or kindles a fire on Shabbat liable even though these are destructive acts? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that a verse</b> was <b>necessary to permit circumcision</b> on Shabbat, by inference, <b>in general, one who inflicts a wound is liable.</b> If inflicting a wound was not prohibited on Shabbat, there would be no need to permit circumcision.

### Part 4
Similarly, <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Torah prohibited kindling a fire</b> on Shabbat even <b>with regard to</b> the execution by burning of <b>a priest’s daughter</b> who committed adultery, <b>conclude from it that in general, one who ignites a fire</b> on Shabbat <b>is liable.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> address this proof? The Gemara answers: <b>There, that</b> is a case of a <b>constructive</b> labor in accordance <b>with</b> the explanation of <b>Rav Ashi.</b> For <b>Rav Ashi said: What</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> between <b>repairing</b> the child through <b>circumcision and repairing a vessel?</b> They are both constructive acts. And <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me between cooking a</b> lead <b>wick,</b> as a melted lead wick was poured down the throat of the criminal sentenced to execution by burning, <b>and cooking herbs</b> used to produce dyes in the Tabernacle? The Torah addressed these cases specifically because they are constructive, and nothing can be derived from them with regard to liability for performance of destructive labors.

### Part 6
We learned in the mishna: <b>The measure</b> that determines liability <b>for one who whitens</b> and for similar prohibited labors is <b>the full width of a double <i>sit</i>. Rav Yosef would demonstrate</b> the width of a double <i>sit</i> by indicating the distance between the index and middle fingers and instructing the onlookers to <b>double</b> the measure. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami would demonstrate</b> in a <b>simple</b> manner, as he calculated that the distance between the thumb and the forefinger is equal to a double <i>sit</i>.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One who traps a bird into a closet</b> or cage, <b>and</b> one who traps <b>a deer into a house is liable. The Rabbis say:</b> One is liable for trapping <b>a bird into a closet</b>
