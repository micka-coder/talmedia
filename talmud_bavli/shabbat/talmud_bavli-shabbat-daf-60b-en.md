### Part 1
<b>One may send garments</b> as a gift <b>on a Festival, whether they are sewn</b> or <b>whether they are not sewn,</b> because any object fit for any use on a Festival may be sent as a gift. <b>However,</b> one may <b>neither</b> send <b>a spiked sandal nor an unsewn shoe on a Festival,</b> since using them is prohibited. Apparently, one may not wear a spiked sandal on a Festival.

### Part 2
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that the Sages prohibited wearing a spiked sandal <b>on Shabbat?</b> It is <b>because there is an assemblage</b> of people. <b>On a Festival too, there is an assemblage</b> of people. The Gemara asks: <b>On a communal fast day, there is an assemblage</b> of people; wearing a spiked sandal <b>should be prohibited</b> then, as well. The Gemara answers: <b>When this incident occurred, it was</b> on a day when there was <b>an assemblage of prohibition,</b> i.e., a day on which performing labor is prohibited. <b>Here,</b> a fast day, is a day when there is <b>an assemblage of permission,</b> a day on which performing labor is permitted, and the two are not comparable. However, extending the scope of commemorative decrees to apply to comparable situations, e.g., from Shabbat to the Festivals, is acceptable.

### Part 3
<b>And</b> this is true <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Akiva, who said</b> in the following case that a decree issued due to a specific set of circumstances is applied only to those specific circumstances. The ashes of the red heifer were once transported across the Jordan River in a boat. A source of ritual impurity was discovered at the bottom of the boat. The Sages sought to issue a decree prohibiting transport of the ashes of the red heifer over any body of water, sea or river, over a bridge, or in a boat. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Akiva said that decrees that are issued due to a specific event apply only to precisely those circumstances. Therefore, he said: <b>They only prohibited</b> transporting the ashes of a red heifer <b>in the Jordan</b> River <b>and in a boat, and like the incident that occurred.</b> However, even according to this approach, which limits restriction, <b>that applies only to the Jordan</b> River and not to other rivers. This is <b>because it is different from other rivers</b> in several respects, e.g., width and depth. <b>However, a Festival and Shabbat are similar to one another, as it was taught</b> in the mishna: <b>The</b> halakhic <b>difference between a Festival and Shabbat is only</b> with regard to preparation of <b>food.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that a spiked sandal is prohibited <b>only</b> when the nails were placed in the sandal <b>to strengthen</b> its form; <b>however,</b> if they were placed in the sandal <b>for beauty, it is permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with <b>how many</b> nails is it considered to be <b>for beauty? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Five on this</b> sandal <b>and five on that</b> one. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina said: Seven on this</b> one <b>and seven on that</b> one.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Rav Shemen bar Abba: I will explain</b> it <b>to you: According to my</b> opinion, when inserting nails for beauty, <b>two</b> are inserted <b>from here,</b> its outer side, one near the toes and one near the heel, <b>and two</b> are inserted <b>from there,</b> its inner side, one near the toes and one near the heel, <b>and one</b> is inserted <b>on its straps; and for Rabbi Ḥanina, three from here, and three from there, and one on its straps.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For an uneven sandal,</b> whose soles are not straight, <b>one makes seven</b> nails on the bottom to straighten it, and it is then permitted for use on Shabbat; that is <b>the statement of Rabbi Natan. And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permits</b> straightening the sandal <b>with thirteen</b> nails.

### Part 7
The Gemara notes: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> there is no problem, <b>as he stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan. However, Rabbi Yoḥanan, in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>did he state</b> his opinion? Neither of the <i>tanna’im</i> agrees with his opinion. The Gemara answers: <b>He stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Nehorai, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Nehorai says:</b> With <b>five</b> nails inserted into the sole, it <b>is permitted</b> to go out into the public domain on Shabbat; <b>and</b> with <b>seven</b> nails, it is <b>prohibited</b> to go out into the public domain on Shabbat.

### Part 8
The Sage, <b>Ifa, said to Rabba bar bar Ḥana: You,</b> who are <b>students of Rabbi Yoḥanan, act in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan. We will act in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Huna raised a dilemma before Rav Ashi:</b> With a sandal that has <b>five</b> nails inserted into the sole, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to going out into the public domain? <b>He said to him: Even</b> with <b>seven</b> nails it <b>is permitted.</b> He asked further: With <b>nine, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>He said to him: Even</b> with <b>eight</b> it <b>is prohibited.</b>

### Part 10
<b>That shoemaker raised a dilemma before Rabbi Ami: If one sewed</b> the sole and attached it to the sandal <b>from within, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? May he go out into the public domain after inserting nails into it? Rabbi Ami <b>said to him: It is permitted, and I do not know the reason.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ashi said: And does the Master not know the reason?</b> It is obvious. <b>Since he sewed it from within,</b> it is no longer a sandal, <b>it is a shoe. With regard to a sandal, the Sages issued a decree; with regard to a shoe, the Sages did not issue a decree.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Zavda raised a dilemma before Rabbi Abba bar Avina:</b> If <b>he shaped</b> the nail <b>like tongs [<i>kelavus</i>]</b> by bending a nail with two sharp ends and sticking both ends into the sandal, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? May he go out into the public domain with it on Shabbat? <b>He said to him: It is permitted. It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> If <b>he shaped it like tongs it is permitted.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> If <b>he covered</b> the <b>entire</b> sole <b>in nails, so that</b> contact with <b>the ground</b> will <b>not wear it away, it is permitted</b> to go out with that sandal on Shabbat, since it is no longer the spiked sandal with regard to which they issued a decree.

### Part 14
<b>It was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Sheshet: A man may not go out with a spiked sandal, and may not walk with it</b> even <b>from house to house</b> within his courtyard, and may not <b>even</b> walk <b>from bed to bed</b> within his house. <b>However,</b> since the decree was issued with regard to circumstances identical to a specific incident, it only applies to wearing the sandal. Therefore, <b>one may carry</b> the sandal <b>to cover a vessel with it and to support the legs of the bed with it. And Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, prohibits</b> using it for other purposes as well. <b>If most of its nails fell out, and four or five remain in it, it is permitted</b> to go out with it. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permits</b> going out into the public domain with the sandal, even if <b>up to seven</b> nails remain in it. <b>If he covered it with leather from beneath</b> the wood frame of the sandal <b>and inserted nails into it from above, it is permitted. If he made</b> the nail <b>like a tong, or</b> made one end flat <b>like a platter [<i>tas</i>], or</b> sharpened it <b>like a peg, or covered it entirely with nails so that</b> contact with <b>the ground</b> will <b>not wear it away, it is permitted</b> to go out with it.

### Part 15
The Gemara analyzes the <i>Tosefta</i> cited in support of Rav Sheshet’s opinion. <b>This</b> <i>Tosefta</i> <b>itself is difficult,</b> as it is self-contradictory. On the one hand <b>you said:</b> If <b>most of its nails fell out</b> it is permitted; apparently, that is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though many</b> nails <b>remain in</b> the sole. <b>And,</b> however, <b>subsequently it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta,</i> without specifying the number of nails that were there from the outset: With <b>four or five</b> nails, <b>yes,</b> going out is permitted; however, with <b>more</b> nails, <b>no,</b> it is prohibited.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> and it can be resolved as follows: <b>Here,</b> where it was permitted to go out wearing the sandal if the majority of nails fell out, it is referring to a case <b>where they were broken,</b> i.e., the heads of the nails were broken off while most of the nail remained embedded in the sole. In that case, it is clearly evident that most of the nails fell out. <b>Here,</b> where it was permitted only if four or five nails remain, it is referring to a case <b>where they were</b> totally <b>removed</b> and only the nails that remain in the shoe are visible.

### Part 17
The Gemara continues its detailed analysis of the <i>Tosefta</i>: It was taught that if most of the nails in the sandal came out and only <b>four or five</b> nails remain, it <b>is permitted</b> to go out wearing it. The Gemara asks: <b>Now,</b> if it was mentioned that when <b>five</b> nails remain, going out <b>is permitted, is it necessary</b> to mention <b>four? Rav Ḥisda said</b> that the <i>Tosefta</i> means: If <b>four</b> nails remain <b>from</b> the nails in <b>a small sandal, and</b> if <b>five</b> nails remain <b>from</b> the nails in <b>a large sandal,</b> going out is permitted.

### Part 18
It was taught in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permits up to seven.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that for a sandal with an uneven sole, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permits up to thirteen?</b> The Gemara answers: An <b>uneven</b> sole <b>is different.</b> Since the nails are inserted for the purpose of straightening the sole, it does not have the legal status of a spiked sandal.

### Part 19
The Gemara notes: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> new explanation that a sandal with an uneven sole has a different legal status, <b>for Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who stated, contrary to the opinions of the <i>tanna’im</i> in this <i>baraita</i>, that the number of nails permitted in each sandal is five, <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is also not difficult.</b> He could explain that a sandal with an <b>uneven</b> sole <b>is different</b> and requires additional nails. However, in the case of a sandal with an even sole, even the other <i>tanna’im</i> would not permit that many.

### Part 20
<b>Rav Mattana said, and some say Rav Aḥadvoi bar Mattana said</b> that <b>Rav Mattana said: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who completely prohibited moving a spiked sandal. The Gemara asks: That is <b>obvious.</b> Isn’t there a halakhic principle that in a dispute between <b>an individual and</b> the <b>many, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the</b> opinion of the <b>many?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say that the rationale for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, is</b> more <b>reasonable in this</b> case, and therefore the <i>halakha</i> should be ruled in accordance with his opinion. Rav Mattana <b>teaches us</b> that that is not the <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 21
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said: If not</b> for the fact <b>that they would call me: Babylonian who permits prohibitions, I would permit</b> the insertion of <b>many</b> nails <b>into</b> a spiked sandal. The Gemara asks: <b>And how many</b> nails would he have permitted? <b>In Pumbedita they said: Twenty-four</b> nails. <b>In Sura they said: Twenty-two. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: And</b> this is <b>your mnemonic</b> to remember which opinion was stated in Sura and which opinion was stated in Pumbedita: <b>Until</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>came from Pumbedita to Sura he lost two</b> nails from his shoe. Since the route that Rabbi Ḥiyya took from Pumbedita to Eretz Yisrael passed through Sura, one could say: Due to the rigors of the journey, two nails fell from the sandal of Rabbi Ḥiyya between Pumbedita and Sura.

### Part 22
It was taught in the mishna: <b>And</b> he may <b>not</b> go out <b>with a single</b> sandal <b>when there is no wound on his foot.</b>
