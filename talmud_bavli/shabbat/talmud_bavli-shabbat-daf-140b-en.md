### Part 1
<b>to remove it from the reed</b> upon which it is hanging <b>is permitted;</b> however, to remove <b>the reed from it is prohibited.</b> Since the reed is not a vessel, it is set-aside. <b>Rava said: And if it is</b> hung on <b>a weaver’s vessel, it is permitted</b> to remove the vessel as well. Although its primary function is for a prohibited labor, since it is a vessel, it may be moved.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: This bundle of vegetables, if it is suitable for animal food, it is permitted to move it</b> on Shabbat, <b>but if not, it is prohibited</b> to move it.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said</b> as follows: In the case of <b>this hook,</b> if it is used for hanging <b>meat, it is permitted to move it,</b> as it is also suitable for other uses. However, if it is a hook for hanging <b>fish, it is prohibited</b> to move it, because it smells bad (Rabbeinu Ḥananel) and is used exclusively for fish.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ketina said: One who stands</b> on a board <b>in the middle of a bed,</b> it is <b>as though he were standing on the stomach of a woman.</b> Just as he would certainly injure the woman, he will certainly break the bed (<i>ge’onim</i>). The Gemara comments: <b>And it is not</b> a correct <b>matter,</b> and it is not accepted as <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 5
On the topic of the bundle of vegetables, the Gemara cites additional advice on similar issues that <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> to poor scholars experiencing difficulty earning a livelihood: <b>A student of a Torah academy who buys vegetables should buy long ones. A bundle is a bundle,</b> and they have a standard thickness at a standard price. <b>However, the</b> addition of <b>length</b> comes <b>on its own</b> for free.

### Part 6
<b>And Rav Ḥisda</b> also <b>said: A student of a Torah academy who buys reeds should buy long ones,</b> since <b>a bundle is a bundle.</b> Bundles of reeds have a standard thickness, <b>but the length</b> comes <b>on its own</b> for free.

### Part 7
<b>And Rav Ḥisda</b> further <b>said: A student of a Torah academy who does not have much bread should not eat a vegetable, because it whets</b> the appetite. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: I neither ate a vegetable in my</b> state of <b>poverty, nor did I eat a vegetable in my</b> state of <b>wealth. In my poverty,</b> I did not eat a vegetable <b>because it whets</b> the appetite. <b>In my wealth,</b> I did not eat a vegetable <b>because I said: Where a vegetable enters, let meat and fish enter</b> instead.

### Part 8
<b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A student of a Torah academy who does not have much bread should not cut it into thin slices;</b> rather, he should eat what he has in one helping. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A student of a Torah academy who does not have much bread should not break</b> it for guests. <b>What is the reason? As he will not do so in a generous manner. And Rav Ḥisda said: Originally, I would not break</b> bread <b>until I placed my hand in the entire dish</b> to assure <b>that I found</b> that there was enough bread <b>to meet my needs.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And Rav Ḥisda</b> also <b>said: One who is able to eat barley bread and</b> nevertheless <b>eats wheat</b> bread <b>violates the prohibition against</b> wanton <b>destruction.</b> One who wastes resources is comparable to one who destroys items of value. <b>And Rav Pappa said: One who is able to drink beer and</b> nevertheless <b>drinks wine violates the prohibition against</b> wanton <b>destruction.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And this is not</b> a correct <b>matter,</b> as <b>the prohibition against destruction of one’s body takes precedence.</b> It is preferable for one to care for his body by eating higher quality food than to conserve his money.

### Part 10
<b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A student of a Torah academy who has no oil should wash,</b> i.e., smear himself, <b>with ditch water,</b> as the scum that accumulates in it is as useful as oil.

### Part 11
<b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A student of a Torah academy who buys meat should buy from the neck [<i>unka</i>], as there are three types of meat</b> there.

### Part 12
<b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A student of a Torah academy who buys a linen shirt [<i>kitonita</i>] should buy</b> it <b>from</b> those who work by <b>the river Abba, and should wash it every thirty days, so that it will last him for the twelve months of the year. And I guarantee</b> that the shirt will remain in good shape. The Gemara comments: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>kitonita</i>? A fine class [<i>kita</i>],</b> as fine clothing provide one entry into a well-dressed class of people.

### Part 13
<b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A student of a Torah academy should not sit on a new mat, as</b> its dampness <b>ruins his garments.</b>

### Part 14
<b>And Rav Ḥisda said: A student of a Torah academy should not give his clothes to his host to wash for him, as</b> that is <b>not proper behavior, for</b> the host <b>might see something on it,</b> such as signs of a seminal emission, <b>and he will be demeaned</b> in the eyes of his host.

### Part 15
After citing Rav Ḥisda’s recommendations to students, the Gemara cites his advice to his daughters. <b>Rav Ḥisda said to his daughters: Be modest before your husbands; do not eat bread before your husbands,</b> lest you eat too much and be demeaned in their eyes.

### Part 16
Similarly, he advised: <b>Do not eat vegetables at night,</b> as vegetables cause bad breath. <b>Do not eat dates at night and do not drink beer at night,</b> as these loosen the bowels. <b>And do not relieve</b> yourself <b>in the place where your husbands relieve</b> themselves, so that they will not be revolted by you.

### Part 17
<b>And when a person calls at the door</b> seeking to enter, <b>do not say: Who is it,</b> in the masculine form, <b>but</b> rather: <b>Who is it,</b> in the feminine form. Avoid creating the impression that you have dealings with other men.

### Part 18
In order to demonstrate the value of modesty to his daughters, Rav Ḥisda <b>held a pearl in one hand and a clod of earth in the other. The pearl he showed them</b> immediately, <b>and the clod of earth, he did not show them until they were upset</b> due to their curiosity, <b>and then he showed it to them.</b> This taught them that a concealed object is more attractive than one on display, even if it is less valuable.

### Part 19
We learned in the mishna: <b>One may not soak vetches</b> in water in order to separate them from their chaff. However, one may take the straw in a sieve and place it into the trough of an animal. The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna</b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: One may not look at a sieve at all</b> on Shabbat, lest one come to violate the prohibited labor of selecting.

### Part 20
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may sweep</b> hay <b>from before an animal that is being fattened, and one may move</b> hay <b>to the sides for an animal that grazes</b> on its own in the field (Rabbeinu Ḥananel); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Dosa. And the Rabbis prohibit</b> doing so. <b>One may take</b> hay <b>from before this animal and place it before that animal on Shabbat.</b>

### Part 21
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Do <b>the Rabbis,</b> who are stringent, <b>disagree with the first clause</b> of Rabbi Dosa’s statement, <b>or</b> do <b>they disagree with the latter</b> clause of the mishna, <b>or</b> do <b>they disagree with both</b> clauses?

### Part 22
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from that which <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> With regard to <b>both this,</b> hay placed before an animal set aside for fattening, <b>and that,</b> hay placed before an animal that grazes on its own, <b>one may not move</b> it <b>to the sides.</b> Apparently, the Rabbis rule stringently in both cases.

### Part 23
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This <b>dispute</b> is <b>with regard to a trough</b> formed <b>in the ground; however, with regard to a trough which is a vessel, everyone agrees that it is permitted.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>Is there anyone who permits</b> doing so in <b>a trough</b> formed in <b>the ground? Isn’t one leveling holes</b> and thereby performing the prohibited labors of building or plowing? <b>Rather, if it was stated, it was stated as follows: Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This <b>dispute</b> applies only <b>to a trough that is a vessel; however, with regard to a trough</b> formed in <b>the ground, everyone agrees that it is prohibited,</b> due to the concern lest one level holes.

### Part 24
We also learned in the mishna: <b>One may take</b> hay <b>from before</b> this <b>animal</b> and place it before that animal. <b>It was taught in one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may take</b> hay <b>from before an animal whose mouth is fine and place it before an animal whose mouth is foul. And it was taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may take</b> hay <b>from before an animal whose mouth is foul and place it in front of an animal whose mouth is fine.</b> There is an apparent contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i>.

### Part 25
<b>Abaye said:</b> Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> hold that <b>one may take</b> hay <b>from before a donkey</b> and place it <b>before an ox.</b> However, <b>one may not take</b> hay <b>from before an ox</b> and place it <b>before a donkey.</b> The formulation of the <i>baraitot</i> can be explained as follows: <b>That which was taught: One may take</b> hay <b>from before an animal whose mouth is fine,</b> is referring to <b>a donkey,</b> and the reason the <i>baraita</i> says its mouth is fine is <b>because it has no spittle.</b> Therefore, the donkey does not dampen the remaining hay with its saliva. <b>And</b> the statement: <b>And one may place it before an animal whose mouth is foul,</b> is referring to <b>a cow,</b>
