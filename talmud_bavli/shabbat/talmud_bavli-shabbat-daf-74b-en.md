### Part 1
<b>as they are boiled seven times. And, if one does not remove them</b> from the shells, they <b>rot.</b> Therefore, <b>it is considered like</b> removing <b>waste from food.</b> The rotting edible portion of the lupine causes the shell to reek. Removing the edible portion, therefore, has the legal status of removing waste.

### Part 2
We learned in the mishna, among those liable for performing primary categories of labor: <b>And one who grinds. Rav Pappa said: One who chops beets</b> into small pieces on Shabbat <b>is liable due to</b> the prohibited labor of <b>grinding,</b> as the actions are similar. <b>Rav Menashe said: One who chops wood chips</b> for sawdust (Rambam) <b>is liable due to</b> the prohibited labor of <b>grinding. Rav Ashi said: If</b> he <b>is particular</b> in his chopping <b>with regard to the measurement,</b> i.e., he is careful to cut all the chips to a particular size, he is also <b>liable due to</b> the labor of <b>cutting.</b>

### Part 3
We learned in the mishna, among those liable for performing primary categories of labor: <b>And one who kneads and one who bakes. Rav Pappa said: Our <i>tanna</i> left</b> out the labor of <b>cooking</b> the <b>spices</b> for dye, <b>which was</b> performed <b>in the Tabernacle, and included</b> the labor of <b>baking,</b> which was not performed in the construction of the Tabernacle. If, as stated above, all the primary categories of labor were derived from the labors in the Tabernacle, why did the <i>tanna</i> omit cooking? The Gemara answers: <b>Our <i>tanna</i> cited the sequence</b> of preparing <b>bread,</b> which was the underlying principle behind his organization of the primary categories of labor. He opened with plowing and concluded with the preparation of bread.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Avira said: One who places a peg into an oven</b> to dry <b>is liable for</b> performing the labor of <b>cooking.</b> The Gemara asks: That is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>he intends to strengthen the utensil,</b> as ultimately, the peg is hardened in the oven, in contrast to cooking in which the fire softens the item being cooked. Therefore, <b>he teaches us that</b> initially the wood <b>is softened</b> in the oven, <b>and</b> only <b>afterward it is hardened. Rabba bar Rav Huna said: One who boils pitch is liable for</b> performing the labor of <b>cooking.</b> The Gemara asks: That is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>since it proceeds to harden</b> afterward, <b>say</b> that it is <b>not considered</b> cooking. One might think that since the pitch was hard before it was cooked and will ultimately be hard after it is cooked, boiling pitch is not considered cooking. Therefore, <b>he teaches us</b> that even a temporary change is considered cooking.

### Part 5
<b>Rava said: One who</b> unwittingly <b>crafted an</b> earthenware <b>barrel</b> on Shabbat <b>is liable to</b> bring <b>seven sin-offerings:</b> He crumbles the lumps of dirt; which is (1) grinding; (2) selects the stones from the dirt; (3) kneads the mortar; (4) cuts the mortar into pieces of a suitable size; (5) builds the mold; (6) kindles the fire, and then fires the earthenware vessel, which is (7) baking (<i>ge’onim</i>). One who crafts <b>an oven is liable for eight sin-offerings,</b> since in addition to those seven labors, he spreads another layer of mortar to finish the job, performing the prohibited labor of (8) smoothing. <b>Abaye said: One who</b> unwittingly <b>crafts a receptacle</b> from reeds on Shabbat <b>is liable to</b> bring <b>eleven sin-offerings.</b> In pruning the reeds, he performed both (1) reaping and (2) planting, as he stimulates growth of the remaining reeds. He (3) gathers the reeds; (4) selects them; (5) smooths and levels them; cuts them into small pieces, which is (6) grinding; and (7) cuts them to a particular measurement. When he begins weaving the reeds, he performs the labors of (8) stretching the warp; (9) constructing two meshes; and (10) weaving. Crafting the object as a whole constitutes (11) building (<i>ge’onim</i>). <b>And if he sews the mouth</b> of the receptacle, <b>he is liable to</b> bring <b>thirteen sin-offerings</b> with the added labors of (12) sewing and (13) tying.

### Part 6
We learned in the mishna, among those liable for performing primary categories of labor: <b>One who shears wool, and one who whitens it,</b> which are labors in the process of shearing and spinning wool. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who</b> unwittingly <b>spins wool</b> still attached <b>on the back of</b> an <b>animal on Shabbat is liable to</b> bring <b>three sin-offerings: One due to shearing,</b> since, in the process, some of the wool is detached from the sheep; <b>and one due to combing</b> the wool; <b>and one due to spinning. Rav Kahana said: This is not</b> a typical <b>manner of shearing, and this is not</b> a typical <b>manner of combing, and this is not</b> a typical <b>manner of spinning.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is that <b>not</b> a typical manner of spinning? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in the name</b> of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya</b> that the verse in the context of the work of the Tabernacle: “And all the women whose hearts lifted them with wisdom spun the goats” (Exodus 35:26) means that <b>they washed</b> the hair <b>on the goats, and they spun</b> it into threads <b>on the goats</b> themselves without first shearing the hair? <b>Apparently, spinning on the back of an animal is considered</b> a typical manner of <b>spinning.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Extraordinary wisdom is different.</b> Although certain individuals are capable of spinning wool that way, the typical person is not capable of performing that feat.

### Part 7
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who</b> unwittingly <b>plucks</b> a large feather from <b>the wing</b> of a bird on Shabbat, <b>and who snips</b> the tip of the feather, <b>and who pulls out</b> the thin threads that comprise the feather <b>is liable to</b> bring <b>three sin-offerings. And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said</b> in explanation: One who <b>plucks</b> the wing <b>is liable due to</b> the labor of <b>shearing.</b> One who <b>snips</b> the tip of the feather <b>is liable due to cutting.</b> And one who <b>pulls out</b> the threads <b>is liable due to smoothing.</b>

### Part 8
We learned in the mishna, among those liable for performing primary categories of labor: <b>One who ties and one who unties.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Where was</b> there <b>tying in the Tabernacle? Rava said: They tied</b> the <b>tents</b> of the Tabernacle <b>to the pegs.</b> The Gemara rejects this: And is that considered performance of the labor of <b>tying? That was tying</b> a knot <b>in order to untie</b> it. When the children of Israel departed from an encampment, they dismantled the Tabernacle, which involved untying all of the knots. One is not liable for tying a temporary knot on Shabbat. <b>Rather, Abaye said: As the weavers of curtains</b> for the Tabernacle, <b>when a thread would rip, they would tie it. Rava said to him: You have resolved</b> the problem with regard to the labor of <b>tying; however,</b> with regard to the labor of <b>untying, what can be said?</b> Where, in the construction of the Tabernacle, was the labor of untying performed? <b>And if you say that</b> it was performed <b>if one found two threads</b> with knots <b>tied next to each other, he untied one and</b> left one <b>tied; now, before a king of flesh and blood one would not do so,</b> as the curtain would look flawed, in the Tabernacle, <b>before the King of kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> would <b>one do so? Rather, Rava said, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Elai</b> said: <b>The trappers of <i>ḥilazon</i>,</b> whose blood was used in the Tabernacle as a dye, <b>tie and untie</b> their nets.

### Part 9
We learned in the mishna, among those liable for performing primary categories of labor: <b>And one who sews two stitches.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>That does not endure;</b> two stitches will unravel immediately. A prohibited labor whose result is temporary is not considered a prohibited labor. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That</b> has the legal status of a prohibited labor only in a case <b>where,</b> after sewing the stitches, <b>he tied them.</b> He tied a knot at each of the two ends of the thread so that the stitches would not unravel.

### Part 10
We learned in the mishna, among those liable for performing primary categories of labor: <b>One who tears in order to sew two stitches.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Was there tearing in</b> the construction of <b>the Tabernacle?</b> The Gemara answers that it was <b>Rabba and Rabbi Zeira who both said</b> the following explanation:
