### Part 1
The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one may reset a break</b> on Shabbat, which was the ruling in Shmuel’s version of the mishna. The Gemara relates that <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana happened</b> to come <b>to Pumbedita</b> and <b>he did not enter Rav Yehuda’s lecture.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>sent for Adda, his attendant,</b> and <b>said to him: Go drag him</b> to the lecture. <b>He went and dragged him</b> forcibly to the lecture (Rabbeinu Ḥananel). Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>came and found</b> Rav Yehuda <b>teaching</b> that <b>one may not reset a break</b> on Shabbat. <b>He said to him: This is what Rav Ḥana of Baghdad said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one may reset a break</b> on Shabbat. Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: Ḥana is ours,</b> a Babylonian scholar, <b>and Shmuel is ours, and</b> nevertheless, <b>I did not</b> yet <b>hear</b> this <i>halakha</i>; <b>did I not rightfully drag you</b> to the lecture?

### Part 2
We learned in the mishna that <b>one whose hand was dislocated</b> may not treat it by vigorously moving it about in water. The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Avya was</b> once <b>sitting before Rav Yosef and his hand became dislocated.</b> Rav Avya then displayed a variety of hand positions and <b>he said to him: What</b> is the ruling with regard to <b>this?</b> Am I permitted to place my hand in this way, or is it a violation of the prohibition against healing on Shabbat? Rav Yosef said to him: <b>It is prohibited.</b> Rav Avya again asked: <b>And what</b> is the ruling if I position my hand in <b>this</b> way? Rav Yosef <b>said to him: It is prohibited. In the meantime, his hand</b> was restored to its proper location and <b>was healed.</b>

### Part 3
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: What is your dilemma? We learned</b> in our mishna that <b>one whose hand or foot was dislocated</b> on Shabbat <b>may not</b> vigorously <b>move it about in cold water; however, he may rinse it in the usual manner, and if it is healed, it is healed.</b> Rav Avya <b>said to him:</b> That is no proof, <b>as didn’t we learn</b> in our mishna that <b>one may not reset a break, and Rav Ḥana of Baghdad said</b> that <b>Shmuel said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that <b>one may</b> indeed <b>reset a broken bone.</b> Therefore, perhaps a dislocated limb may also be treated on Shabbat. Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Were all these woven together in a single weave? Where it was stated</b> that an alternative version of the mishna exists, <b>it was stated; where it was not stated, it was not stated.</b> Therefore, the ruling of the mishna with regard to a dislocated limb must be observed.
