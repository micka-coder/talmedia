### Part 1
<b>And Rabbi Yosei prohibits</b> going out into the public domain with the wooden leg, since he does not consider it to have the legal status of a shoe.

### Part 2
<b>And if</b> the wooden leg <b>has a receptacle</b> for <b>pads,</b> a concave space at the top of the leg into which pads are placed to cushion the amputated leg, it assumes the status of a wooden vessel and can become <b>ritually impure.</b>

### Part 3
And <b>his supports,</b> which are shoes that one who had both of his feet amputated places on his knees in order to walk on his knees, if a <i>zav</i> wears them, they are subject to <b>ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading.</b> A <i>zav</i> is a primary source of ritual impurity. If he touches a vessel it assumes first-degree ritual impurity status. However, vessels on which he treads, sits, lies, or leans become primary sources of ritual impurity, provided they are designated for that purpose. These supports are vessels designated for treading. <b>And one may go out with them</b> into the public domain <b>on Shabbat</b> since they have the legal status of shoes. <b>And one may enter the Temple courtyard with them.</b> Although, generally, wearing shoes in the Temple courtyard is prohibited, in this regard, the supports do not have the legal status of shoes.

### Part 4
However, if one who is crippled to the extent that he cannot walk at all sits on a chair that is attached to him, places supports on his hands, and propels himself along with his hands, <b>his chair and supports are</b> subject to <b>ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading. And one may not go out with them on Shabbat, and one may not enter the Temple courtyard with them.</b>

### Part 5
<b><i>Loketamin</i>,</b> which will be explained in the Gemara, <b>are ritually pure</b> in the sense that they cannot become ritually impure because they are not vessels, <b>and one may not go out with them</b> on Shabbat.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: How did we learn</b> the dispute in our mishna? Does Rabbi Meir rule that the amputee may go out with a wooden leg and foot and Rabbi Yosei prohibits him from doing so? Or is it Rabbi Meir who prohibited him from doing so, and Rabbi Yosei’s opinion is the lenient one? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: I don’t know.</b> And Rava asked: <b>What is the <i>halakha</i></b> in this matter? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: I don’t know.</b>

### Part 7
<b>It was stated: Shmuel said</b> that the correct reading of the mishna is: <b>An amputee may not</b> go out, and Rabbi Yosei permits him to do so. <b>And, likewise, Rav Huna said</b> that the correct reading of the mishna is: <b>An amputee may not. Rav Yosef said: Since Shmuel said</b> that the correct reading of the mishna is: <b>An amputee may not, and Rav Huna said: An amputee may not, we will also learn</b> the mishna: <b>An amputee may not.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rava bar Shira strongly objects to this:</b> And <b>did they not hear that Rav Ḥanan bar Rava taught</b> the mishna <b>to Ḥiyya bar Rav before Rav in a small room [<i>kituna</i>] in</b> the <b>school of Rav: An amputee may not go out</b> on Shabbat <b>with his wooden leg;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And Rabbi Yosei permits</b> going out with it. <b>And Rav signaled him</b> with a hand gesture to <b>reverse</b> the opinions, Rabbi Meir permits going out and Rabbi Yosei prohibits doing so. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: And the mnemonic</b> to remember which <i>tanna</i> permits and which <i>tanna</i> prohibits is <b><i>samekh samekh</i>.</b> The letter <i>samekh</i> appears both in the name Yosei and in the Hebrew word for prohibits [<i>oser</i>]. In that way, one remembers that Rabbi Yosei is the one who prohibits it.

### Part 9
The Gemara comments: <b>And even Shmuel,</b> who said that the correct reading of the mishna is: An amputee may not, and Rabbi Yosei permits it, <b>reversed</b> his opinion. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: The <i>ḥalitza</i> ceremony, which frees a childless widow from the obligation to enter into levirate marriage with her brother-in-law, involves the widow removing her brother-in-law’s sandal from his foot. If <b>she removed a sandal that is not his,</b> or <b>a wooden sandal, or</b> the sandal <b>of the left foot</b> that was <b>on</b> his <b>right</b> foot, <b>the <i>ḥalitza</i> is valid.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And we said: Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who holds that a wooden sandal is considered a shoe for this purpose? <b>Shmuel said: It is Rabbi Meir, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>An amputee may go out with his wooden leg,</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yosei prohibits</b> doing so. Ultimately, Shmuel accepted Rav’s reading of the mishna.

### Part 11
<b>And Rav Huna also reversed</b> his opinion, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a plasterers’ sandal</b> worn by those who work with lime and would cover their leather shoes with a shoe woven from straw or reeds so that the leather shoes would not get ruined by the lime. If the plasterer is a <i>zav</i> and walks with his shoes covered, the shoe covering <b>is</b> subject to <b>ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading,</b> as the legal status of that sandal is that of a shoe. <b>A woman may perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with it, and one may go out with it on Shabbat;</b> this is the <b>statement of Rabbi Akiva. And</b> the Rabbis <b>did not agree with him.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>they agreed with him? Rav Huna said</b> in resolution of this apparent contradiction: <b>Who is</b> the Sage whose opinion is referred to in the phrase: <b>They agreed with him?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Meir. And who is</b> the Sage whose opinion is referred to in the phrase: <b>They did not agree with him?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> Even Rav Huna accepted Rav’s reading of the mishna that Rabbi Yosei prohibits going out with a wooden leg.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Yosef said: Who is</b> the Sage whose opinion is referred to in the phrase: <b>They did not agree with</b> Rabbi Akiva? It is <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri. As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>A receptacle</b> made <b>of straw and a tube</b> made <b>of reeds, Rabbi Akiva deems</b> these vessels capable of becoming <b>ritually impure, and Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri deems</b> them <b>pure,</b> i.e., incapable of becoming ritually impure because they are not vessels. According to Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, straw objects are not considered vessels fit for use.

### Part 14
It was taught in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>the Master said: A plasterers’ sandal is</b> subject to <b>ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading.</b> The Gemara asks: How could that be? These sandals <b>are not made for walking. Rav Aḥa bar Rav Ulla said:</b> They are used for walking, <b>as,</b> at times, <b>the plasterer walks in them until he reaches his house.</b>

### Part 15
We learned in the mishna: <b>And if</b> the wooden leg <b>has a receptacle for pads, it</b> is capable of becoming <b>ritually impure. Abaye said: It</b> is subject to <b>ritual impurity</b> due to contact with <b>ritual impurity</b> imparted by a <b>corpse, and it is not</b> subject to <b>ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading.</b> If a <i>zav</i> uses a wooden leg it merely assumes first-degree ritual impurity status, since he cannot lean all his weight on it. <b>Rava said:</b> The artificial foot <b>is even</b> subject to <b>ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rava said: From where do I</b> derive to <b>say</b> this <i>halakha</i>? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>The wagon of a</b> small <b>child</b> utilized to teach him to walk (<i>Tosafot</i>) <b>is</b> subject to <b>ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading,</b> since its purpose is to lean on it. <b>And Abaye said:</b> The two cases are not comparable. <b>There,</b> in the case of the wagon, <b>he leans</b> all his weight <b>on it; here,</b> in the case of the wooden leg, <b>he does not lean</b> all his weight <b>on it.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Abaye said: From where do I</b> derive to <b>say</b> this <i>halakha</i>? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A</b> walking <b>stick,</b> typically used by the <b>elderly, is pure,</b> i.e., incapable of becoming ritually impure <b>from any</b> form of ritual impurity. Apparently, an object upon which one does not lean all his weight is not subject to ritual impurity imparted by treading.

### Part 18
<b>And</b> how does <b>Rava</b> respond to this proof? He says that there is a distinction between the cases: <b>There,</b> in the case of a walking stick used by the elderly,
