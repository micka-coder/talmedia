### Part 1
With regard to <b>a</b> vine <b>branch that is tied to a pitcher, one may fill</b> water <b>with it on Shabbat</b> because the branch became part of the vessel.

### Part 2
With regard to <b>a window shutter, Rabbi Eliezer says: When it is tied</b> to <b>and hanging</b> from the window, i.e., it is not touching the ground, <b>one may shutter</b> the window <b>with it,</b> because it is not considered building; <b>and if not,</b> i.e., it is touching the ground, <b>one may not shutter</b> the window <b>with it. And the Rabbis say: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case <b>one may shutter with it.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there:</b> In the case of <b>a stone that is atop a barrel</b> and one wants to open the barrel, <b>he tilts</b> the barrel <b>on its side and</b> the stone <b>falls. Rabba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They only taught</b> this in a case <b>where one forgets</b> the stone atop the barrel; <b>however,</b> in a case <b>where one places</b> the stone atop the barrel intentionally, the barrel <b>becomes a base for a prohibited object,</b> and it is therefore prohibited to move the barrel. <b>And Rav Yosef</b> said that <b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They only taught</b> this in a case <b>where one forgets</b> it; <b>however,</b> in a case <b>where one places</b> it there, the stone <b>becomes a cover for the barrel</b> and it is permitted to use it like other barrel covers.

### Part 4
<b>Rabba said: We raise an objection to our <i>halakha</i></b> from the mishna: With regard to <b>a stone that is in a gourd</b> used to draw water, <b>if they fill it</b> with water <b>and</b> the stone <b>does not fall, one may fill with it</b> on Shabbat. Apparently, if the stone is designated for a purpose, it is no longer set-aside. He rejects the proof: <b>And that is not so,</b> as these cases are not comparable. <b>There,</b> in the case of the stone in the gourd, <b>since one attached</b> it to the gourd, <b>he rendered</b> the stone <b>a wall</b> of the gourd and part of the vessel, unlike in the case of the stone atop the barrel.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yosef said: And we raise an objection to our <i>halakha</i></b> from the mishna: <b>And if not,</b> and the stone does fall, <b>one may not fill with it.</b> A stone that is not attached is not considered to be part of the vessel and is therefore set-aside. He rejects the proof. <b>And that is not so,</b> as these cases are not comparable. <b>There, since he did not attach</b> the stone to the gourd, <b>he negates its</b> status as a part of the vessel and it remains set-aside.

### Part 6
The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to what do they disagree? One Sage,</b> Rabba, <b>holds</b> that <b>we require an action</b> to change the status of a stone or another set-aside object into a vessel, <b>and one Sage,</b> Rav Yosef, <b>holds</b> that <b>we do not require an action.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And they,</b> Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, <b>follow their</b> regular line of <b>reasoning, as when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he said that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said, and some say that</b> it was <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> who <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Once Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>went to one place and found a course of</b> building <b>stones, and</b> he <b>said to his students: Go out and think</b> that you are designating these stones for Shabbat <b>so that we may sit on them tomorrow</b> on Shabbat, <b>and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>did not require them</b> to perform <b>an action</b> with those stones. Thought alone was sufficient.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> That is not what happened. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>required them</b> to perform <b>an action</b> to designate the stones. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> action <b>did he say to them</b> to perform? <b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to them: Go out and arrange</b> the stones. <b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>he said to them: Go out and rub</b> the mortar off of <b>them.</b> Rabbi Ami requires a more significant action to render the stones a vessel.

### Part 9
<b>It was stated</b> that there was a dispute with regard to this matter. <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said: It was a</b> new <b>stack of beams,</b> not stones. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Shaul said: It was the sounding pole of a ship</b> used to determine the depth of the water. <b>The one who said</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi permitted sitting on a ship’s <b>sounding pole, all the more so</b> he permitted doing so in the case of <b>beams. And</b> with regard to <b>the one who said</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi permitted sitting on a stack of <b>beams, but</b> in the case of the <b>sounding pole</b> he would prohibit doing so because it is set-aside due to monetary loss, as he is <b>particular about it</b> that it will not become warped and damaged.

### Part 10
We learned in the mishna: With regard to <b>a</b> vine <b>branch that is tied</b> to a pitcher, one may fill water with it on Shabbat. The Gemara infers: If it is <b>tied, yes,</b> it is permitted; if it is <b>not tied, no,</b> it is prohibited. <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>

### Part 11
<b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>hard branches of a palm</b> tree <b>that one cut for firewood</b> or for construction, <b>and</b> then <b>he reconsidered their</b> designation and decided to use them <b>for sitting, he must tie</b> the branches together on Shabbat eve so that they will not be set-aside. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: He need not tie</b> them together, and nevertheless, it is permitted to move them. According to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, cut wood need not be specially prepared to be used on Shabbat.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Sheshet says: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, with what are we dealing here? With</b> a case where the shoot is still <b>connected to its origin,</b> the vine. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, he is making use</b> of an item that <b>is attached to the ground,</b> and the Sages issued a decree prohibiting the use of any plant attached to the ground. The Gemara answers: This is referring to a branch attached to the vine <b>below three</b> handbreadths off the ground. A vine attached to the ground below three handbreadths off the ground was not prohibited in that decree, just as it is permitted to make use of tree roots adjacent to the ground. <b>Rav Ashi said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that it is referring <b>to a</b> branch that <b>is detached,</b> nevertheless, its use is prohibited due to the <b>decree lest one cut</b> and straighten the branch to prepare it for use with the bucket. Therefore, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel teaches that there is no need for concern.

### Part 13
We learned in the mishna that Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis dispute the case of <b>a window shutter</b> and in what manner one is permitted to shutter a window on Shabbat. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Everyone agrees that one may not construct a temporary tent on a Festival</b> for the <b>first time, and needless to say,</b> one may not do so <b>on Shabbat.</b> The <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree only</b> with regard to <b>adding</b> to an existing tent, <b>as Rabbi Eliezer says: One may not add</b> to an existing structure <b>on a Festival, and needless to say,</b> one may not do so <b>on Shabbat. And the Rabbis say: One may add</b> to a temporary structure <b>on Shabbat, and needless to say,</b> one may do so <b>on a Festival.</b>

### Part 14
We learned in the mishna that the Rabbis say: Both in this case and in that case one may shutter with it. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, in this context? <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Kahana said:</b>
