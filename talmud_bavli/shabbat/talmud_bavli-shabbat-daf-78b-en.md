The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>wax</b> is <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to place on the opening of a small hole</b> to seal it. The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>crushed earthenware</b> is <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to</b> knead and <b>make</b> from it <b>an opening for</b> the bellows to be placed in <b>a gold refiners’ crucible.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the <i>mishna</i>: The measure that determines liability for carrying out a rope is <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used to form an ear-shaped handle for a basket. The Gemara asks: In the case of <b>rope, too, let one be liable</b> for carrying out a measure <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to make a loop for hanging a sifter or a sieve,</b> as he is with a reed. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> rope is tough and would <b>cut grooves in the vessel, people do not make</b> loops from it. <b>The Sages taught:</b> The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>hard palm leaves</b> is <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to make an ear-shaped handle for an Egyptian wicker basket,</b> which is made from woven palm branches. <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>bast</b> is <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to place on the opening of a small funnel to filter the wine.</b> The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>fat</b> is <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to smear beneath a small cake. And how much is its measure? Equivalent to</b> the size of <b>a <i>sela</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Was it not taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that its measure is <b>equivalent to a dried fig?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This,</b> the width of a <i>sela</i>, <b>and that,</b> the volume of a dried fig, <b>are one measure.</b> The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>soft material</b> is <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to make a small ball. And how much is its measure?</b> It is <b>like</b> the size of <b>a nut.</b>

### Part 4
We learned in the mishna: The measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>paper</b> is <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to write a tax receipt.</b> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>How much</b> is the measure of <b>a tax receipt?</b> Enough to write <b>two letters</b> characteristic <b>of a tax receipt,</b> which are larger than regular letters. <b>And the</b> Gemara <b>raises a contradiction: One who carries out blank paper; if it has</b> space <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to write two letters, he is liable, and</b> if <b>not, he is exempt.</b> That paper is smaller than a tax receipt. <b>Rav Sheshet said: What</b> are the <b>two letters</b> taught in the <i>Tosefta</i>? <b>Two letters of a tax receipt. Rava said:</b> The <i>Tosefta</i> can even be explained as referring to <b>two</b> standard-size <b>letters of ours and</b> blank <b>space</b> with which <b>to hold</b> the paper on which the text is written, <b>which is</b> the size of <b>a tax receipt.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara <b>raises an objection: One who carries out paper</b> from which the writing has been <b>erased or a</b> promissory <b>note</b> whose debt has been <b>repaid, if there is in its white</b> section, the space with no text, <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to write two letters, or</b> if <b>the entire paper is equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to wrap around a small jar of perfume, he is liable; and if not,</b> if it is smaller, <b>he is exempt.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Granted, according to Rav Sheshet,</b> who <b>said: What</b> are the <b>two letters</b> taught in the <i>Tosefta</i>, <b>two letters of a tax receipt,</b> it works out <b>well. However, according to Rava,</b> who <b>said: Two</b> standard-size <b>letters of ours and</b> blank <b>space</b> with which <b>to hold</b> the paper on which the text is written, <b>which is</b> the size of <b>a tax receipt, here,</b> on this paper or document, blank <b>space</b> with which <b>to hold</b> the paper <b>is not necessary,</b> as one can hold it on the erased part or on the text of the voided promissory note. Nevertheless, the measure for liability in the <i>Tosefta</i> for carrying out paper from which the writing was erased is no smaller. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is <b>difficult.</b>

### Part 6
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who carries out a tax receipt</b> on Shabbat <b>before he has shown it to the tax collector,</b> and he still needs it, <b>is liable</b> for carrying out on Shabbat. <b>Once he has shown it to the tax collector he is exempt,</b> as it has no significance. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even once he has shown it to the tax collector he is liable because there</b> will be a time when he <b>needs it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between their</b> opinions? <b>Abaye said: There is</b> a practical difference <b>between their</b> opinions with regard to <b>tax runners.</b> Occasionally, the tax collectors send inspectors after those who already passed the tax audit in order to verify that they indeed paid. In that case, even though one already showed it to the original tax collector, he will be required to produce it again. <b>Rava said: There is</b> a practical difference <b>between their</b> opinions with regard to <b>a senior tax collector and a junior tax collector.</b> Sometimes, when the first tax collector that one encounters is a minor official, he will need to keep the receipt with him and produce it if he encounters a more senior official. <b>Rav Ashi said: There is a difference between them</b> even in a case where there is just <b>one tax collector.</b> Nevertheless, it is to his advantage to keep it in his possession <b>because he needs</b> it <b>to show</b> it <b>to a second tax collector</b> whom he may encounter in the future, <b>as he says to</b> him: <b>Look, I am a man</b> trusted <b>by the tax collector.</b> The document in his possession proves that he is on good terms with the tax authorities.

### Part 7
<b>The Sages taught: One who carries out a promissory note</b> on Shabbat <b>before he repaid</b> the debt <b>is liable;</b> however, <b>once he repaid it, he is exempt. Rabbi Yehuda says: Even once he repaid</b> the debt, <b>he is liable</b> for carrying out the document <b>because he needs it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>the</b> practical difference <b>between their</b> opinions? <b>Rav Yosef said: There is</b> a practical difference <b>between their</b> opinions with regard to the <i>halakha</i> whether or not it <b>is prohibited to keep a repaid</b> promissory <b>note</b> in one’s possession. <b>The Rabbis hold: It is prohibited to keep a repaid</b> promissory <b>note</b> in one’s possession, so that the creditor will not use it to collect the debt a second time. Since it is prohibited to keep a repaid promissory note, the document has no value. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds: It is permitted to keep a repaid</b> promissory <b>note</b> in one’s possession and use it as paper.

### Part 8
<b>Abaye said: Everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is prohibited to keep a repaid</b> promissory <b>note</b> in one’s possession, <b>and here</b> they disagree with regard to the question whether or not, in a case where a debtor <b>admits that he wrote a</b> promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor must <b>ratify it</b> in court. The <b>first <i>tanna</i> holds:</b> When a debtor <b>admits that he wrote a</b> promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor must <b>ratify it</b> in court to confirm that it is not a forgery. If it cannot be ratified, the debtor can claim that he already repaid the debt. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds:</b> When a debtor <b>admits that he wrote a</b> promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor <b>need not ratify it</b> in court and can collect his debt without ratification. The document is considered more reliable than the debtor’s claims. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of: <b>Before he repaid</b> the debt <b>and once he repaid it?</b>
