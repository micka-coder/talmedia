<b>they nourished their eyes from nakedness.</b>

### Part 2
With regard to the verse that lists the ornaments, <b>Rav Sheshet said: For what reason did the verse list outer ornaments,</b> i.e., a bracelet, <b>with inner ornaments,</b> i.e., a <i>kumaz</i>? <b>To tell you</b> that <b>anyone who gazes upon a woman’s little finger</b> is considered <b>as if he gazed upon her</b> naked <b>genitals.</b> The atonement was for the sin of looking.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna continues to discuss those items with which it is permitted to go out and those items with which it is prohibited to go out on Shabbat. <b>A woman may go out with strands of hair</b> that she put on her head, <b>whether</b> they are <b>from her own</b> hair that she made into a wig, <b>or whether</b> they are <b>from</b> the hair of <b>another, or whether they are from</b> the hair of <b>an animal.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And</b> a woman may go out <b>with</b> an ornament called <b><i>totefet</i>, and with <i>sarvitin</i> when they are sewn</b> and will not fall.

### Part 5
She may go out on Shabbat <b>with</b> a <b>woolen cap or with a wig to the courtyard,</b> although not to the public domain. <b>And</b> likewise she may go out <b>with a cloth that is in her ear, and with a cloth in her sandal, and with a cloth that she placed due to her menstrual</b> status.

### Part 6
She may go out on Shabbat <b>with pepper, or with a grain of salt, or anything placed in her mouth</b> for healing or for preventing bad odor, <b>as long as she does not put</b> these objects in her mouth <b>for the first time on Shabbat. And if it fell out she may not replace it.</b>

### Part 7
<b>A false tooth</b> as well as (Ramban) <b>a gold tooth, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permits</b> going out with it, <b>and the Rabbis prohibit</b> doing so.

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that a woman may go out with different strands of hair. The Gemara comments: <b>And it is necessary</b> to cite all of the cases. <b>If</b> the mishna <b>taught us only</b> with regard to <b>her own</b> hair, I would have said that she may go out with it <b>because it is not repulsive,</b> as it is her own hair; therefore, there is no concern lest she come to remove the strands and carry them in the public domain. <b>However,</b> the hair <b>of another, which is repulsive</b> and a different color from hers, <b>say no,</b> she may not go out with it, due to concern lest she be embarrassed, remove it, and come to carry it in the public domain.

### Part 9
<b>And if</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> that she is permitted to go out with the hair <b>of another,</b> I would have said that she may go out with it because <b>it is</b> hair <b>of her own kind.</b> Therefore, it is not repulsive in her eyes and she will not come to remove it. <b>However,</b> the hair <b>of an animal,</b> since <b>it is not of her own kind, say no,</b> she may not go out with it due to concern lest she remove it. Therefore, <b>it is necessary</b> to cite all three cases.

### Part 10
<b>It was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: It is permitted <b>as long as a girl does not go out with</b> the hair <b>of an elderly woman, and an elderly woman</b> does not go out <b>with</b> the hair <b>of a girl.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges: <b>Granted,</b> the Gemara cited the case of <b>an elderly woman</b> who goes out <b>with</b> the hair <b>of a girl,</b> as it is a reasonable scenario because <b>it is flattering for her</b> to look young. <b>However, why</b> would <b>a girl</b> go out <b>with</b> the hair <b>of an elderly woman?</b> Since <b>it is demeaning for her</b> to appear elderly, it is an unlikely scenario. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the mishna <b>taught</b> the case of <b>an elderly woman with</b> the hair <b>of a girl, it also taught</b> the improbable case of <b>a girl with</b> the hair <b>of an elderly woman.</b>

### Part 12
It was taught in the mishna that a woman may go out <b>with a woolen cap or with a wig to the courtyard. Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>all</b> ornaments and garments with <b>which the Sages prohibited going out into the public domain</b> on Shabbat, <b>it is</b> also <b>prohibited to go out with</b> them <b>into the courtyard</b> due to the concern lest she forget and go out to the street, <b>with the exception of a woolen cap and a wig.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Anani bar Sason said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: All</b> ornaments have the same legal status <b>as a woolen cap</b> and may be worn into the courtyard.

### Part 14
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna that it is permitted to go out <b>with a woolen cap or a wig into the courtyard. Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav</b> the matter works out <b>well,</b> as the mishna allows one to go out into a courtyard only with a woolen cap and a wig. <b>However, according to the opinion of Rabbi Anani bar Sason,</b> it is <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>In whose name did Rabbi Anani bar Sason say</b> his <i>halakha</i>? <b>In the name of Rabbi Yishmael bar Yosei, and Rabbi Yishmael bar Yosei is a <i>tanna</i> and,</b> as such, has the authority <b>to dispute</b> the determination in the mishna.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rav, what is different</b> about <b>these,</b> the woolen cap and the wig, that the mishna permitted going out into the courtyard with them? <b>Ulla said: So that she will not become unappealing to her husband.</b> That would be the result if all ornamentation was prohibited. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And of her that is sick in her menstrual status [<i>niddata</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 15:33), <b>the Elders</b> of the <b>early</b> generations <b>said</b> that this verse comes to teach us that the menstruating woman should be distanced from her husband in all senses, like a person ostracized [<i>menudeh</i>] by the Sages. This includes <b>that she may not paint</b> her eyes <b>blue</b>, <b>and she may not rouge [<i>pokeset</i>]</b> her face, <b>and she may not adorn herself with colorful clothing. Until Rabbi Akiva came and taught: If</b> you do <b>so, you are making her unappealing to her husband, and her husband will</b> consequently <b>divorce her.</b> Therefore, extreme strictures should not be instituted. <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning of that which <b>the verse states: “And of her that is sick in her menstrual status”? She shall remain</b> prohibited <b>in her menstrual status</b> even after the flow of blood has stopped <b>until she immerses in the water</b> of a ritual bath.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Wherever the Sages prohibited</b> an action <b>due to the appearance</b> of prohibition, <b>even in the innermost chambers,</b> where no one will see it, it <b>is prohibited.</b> When prohibiting an action, the Sages did not distinguish between different circumstances. They prohibited performing the action in all cases.

### Part 17
The Gemara raises an objection. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that an animal belonging to a Jew may <b>not</b> go out on Shabbat <b>with a bell</b> around its neck, <b>even though it is plugged</b> and makes no sound, due to the appearance of prohibition, as it appears as if he were taking the animal to the marketplace. <b>And it was taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>He may plug the bell on</b> the animal’s <b>neck and walk with it in the courtyard.</b> Apparently, although the Sages prohibited this action due to the appearance of prohibition, they permitted it in the courtyard.

### Part 18
The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> subject to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> in this matter, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:
