<b>the second tithe, one may not weigh gold dinars with it</b> in order to determine their precise weight. <b>And</b> doing so is prohibited <b>even</b> if he is weighing the coin in order <b>to redeem other second-tithe</b> produce <b>with it,</b> as one may not derive benefit from tithe money. The Gemara discusses this matter: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>when Rav and Shmuel disagree</b> it is with regard to a case when one lights <b>from lamp to lamp, but with a wood chip, Shmuel prohibits</b> lighting, <b>this will not be a conclusive refutation</b> of Shmuel’s opinion. <b>But if you say</b> that he <b>permits</b> lighting from lamp to lamp <b>with a wood chip as well, this would be a conclusive refutation</b> of his opinion, as the Sages did not permit use of and benefit from a sacred object even for the purpose of a similar sacred need. <b>Rabba said:</b> This is not difficult, as in the case of weighing tithe money the Sages prohibited doing so as a <b>decree lest the weights not be precisely equal.</b> One will discover that the weight of the gold dinars is not equal to the weight of the <i>sela</i> that he used to weigh them, <b>and he will reconsider and render them unsanctified,</b> i.e., they will maintain their original, non-sacred status. In that case, he will have used the tithe money for an unsanctified purpose. However, when one lights even a wood chip for the purpose of Hanukkah lights, it is clear that it is for the purpose of performing a mitzva, and there is no reason to issue a decree.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Sheshet raised an objection</b> from that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>. With regard to the Temple candelabrum, it is stated: <b>“Outside the veil of the testimony,</b> in the Tent of Meeting, <b>shall</b> Aaron <b>order</b> it from evening to morning before the Lord continually; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations” (Leviticus 24:3). It must be understood: <b>And does</b> God <b>require its light</b> for illumination at night? <b>Didn’t the children of Israel, all forty years that they walked in the wilderness, walk exclusively by His light,</b> the pillar of fire? <b>Rather,</b> the lighting of the candelabrum <b>is testimony to mankind that the Divine Presence rests among Israel.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this <b>testimony? Rav said: That is the westernmost lamp</b> in the candelabrum <b>in which the measure of oil placed was the same measure</b> of oil as was placed in <b>the other</b> lamps, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>he would light the</b> others <b>from it</b> each day <b>and with it he would conclude,</b> i.e., the westernmost lamp would continue burning throughout the day after all the others were extinguished. The rest of the lamps burned only at night, and each night he would relight the rest of the lamps from the westernmost lamp. <b>But isn’t it true that here,</b> in the Temple, <b>since the lamps were fixed</b> in the candelabrum, it was impossible to light directly from lamp to lamp? <b>There was no alternative to taking</b> a wood chip <b>and lighting</b> the rest of the lamps from the westernmost lamp. Consequently, <b>it is difficult both according to the one who said</b> that one may not light from lamp to lamp <b>due to contempt for the mitzva and according to the one who said</b> that one may not light from lamp to lamp <b>due to weakening</b> the <b>mitzva.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Pappa explained</b> that it need not necessarily be understood that way. Rather, there were <b>long wicks</b> in the candelabrum, which made it possible to reach and light directly from one lamp to another. However, <b>ultimately, according to the one who said</b> that one may not light from lamp to lamp <b>due to weakening</b> the <b>mitzva, it is difficult.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, the question remains <b>difficult.</b>

### Part 4
In summary, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the halakhic conclusion reached <b>about</b> this matter in terms of lighting from lamp to lamp? <b>Rav Huna, son of Rabbi Yehoshua, said: We see; if</b> the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the one who said that <b>kindling</b> the Hanukkah light <b>accomplishes</b> the <b>mitzva</b> and the rest is secondary, <b>one may light from lamp to lamp.</b> The lighting itself is the essence of the mitzva of Hanukkah lights. <b>And if</b> the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the one who said that <b>placing</b> the lit lamp in a suitable place <b>accomplishes</b> the <b>mitzva,</b> then <b>one may not light from lamp to lamp.</b> According to that opinion, lighting is simply an auxiliary action that facilitates the fulfillment of the essence of the mitzva, which is placing the lamp in a place where its light can be seen by the public. Since lighting is merely a preparatory action, one may not demean the mitzva by lighting from lamp to lamp.

### Part 5
After the issue of whether lighting accomplishes the mitzva or placing accomplishes the mitzva was raised in the context of the previous discussion, the Gemara cites the discussion in its entirety. <b>As a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In the case of the Hanukkah light, does <b>lighting accomplish</b> the <b>mitzva,</b> and placing the lit lamp is simply a continuation of that action, <b>or</b> does <b>placing</b> the kindled lamp <b>accomplish</b> the <b>mitzva,</b> and lighting is simply a practical necessity that facilitates placing the lamp?

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to this dilemma from that which <b>Rava said:</b> One who <b>was holding a burning Hanukkah lamp</b> in his hand <b>and standing, he did nothing</b> in terms of fulfilling the mitzva. <b>Conclude from this that placing accomplishes</b> the <b>mitzva.</b> Until he sets the lamp down in its appropriate place, he did not fulfill the mitzva. The Gemara rejects this: <b>There,</b> they said that he did not fulfill his obligation for a different reason. One <b>who sees</b> it will <b>say</b> that he is not holding the lamp in order to fulfill the mitzva, but <b>he is holding it for his own needs.</b> Since holding the lamp can mislead onlookers, he does not fulfill the mitzva in that manner.

### Part 7
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another resolution for this dilemma from that which <b>Rava said:</b> One who <b>lights</b> the Hanukkah lamp <b>inside</b> the house <b>and</b> then <b>takes it out</b> and places it at the entrance to his house <b>did nothing</b> in terms of fulfilling the mitzva. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>lighting accomplishes the mitzva</b> it is understandable, as <b>lighting in its place is required. That is why</b> Rava ruled that <b>he did nothing</b> in terms of fulfilling the mitzva. <b>However, if you say</b> that <b>placing accomplishes the mitzva, why</b> did Rava rule that <b>he did nothing?</b> Didn’t he set it down in its appropriate place? The Gemara answers: <b>There too,</b> even though he subsequently brought it outside, <b>one who sees</b> him lighting inside will <b>say</b> to himself that <b>he is lighting</b> the lamp <b>for his</b> own <b>needs</b> and not in fulfillment of the mitzva.

### Part 8
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another resolution from that which <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b>
