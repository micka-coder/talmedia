<b>trimming vegetables is permitted. And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If <b>Yom Kippur occurs on</b> a <b>weekday, one may crack nuts and remove pomegranate seeds from</b> the late <b>afternoon and onward,</b> because doing so involves no actual labor and <b>due to anxiety,</b> i.e., if a person does not know that there is food prepared for when the fast ends, he suffers more during the final hours of the day (Rabbi Zeraḥia HaLevi). The Gemara relates: The members of <b>Rav Yehuda’s house would trim cabbage.</b> The members of <b>Rabba’s house would scrub gourds. Once</b> Rabba <b>saw</b> that <b>they were doing</b> this <b>early,</b> before the late afternoon, <b>he said to them: A letter came from the West,</b> i.e., from Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name</b> of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> saying that doing so is <b>prohibited.</b>
