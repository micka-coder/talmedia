### Part 1
<b>And</b> to <b>what</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> is the Gemara referring? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A woman may not go out</b> on Shabbat <b>with a key that is in her hand, and if she went out she is liable to bring a sin-offering;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Eliezer exempts</b> a woman who goes out <b>with a bundle of fragrant herbs and with a flask of balsam oil [<i>palyaton</i>].</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara finds the statement of Rabbi Eliezer difficult: <b>A bundle of fragrant herbs; who mentioned</b> anything about <b>that?</b> Rabbi Meir did not mention a bundle of herbs; why did Rabbi Eliezer mention it in his response?

### Part 3
The Gemara answers that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and it teaches the following: And likewise, with a bundle of fragrant herbs, and likewise with a flask of balsam oil she may not go out, and if she went out she is liable to bring a sin-offering;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Eliezer exempts in</b> the cases of <b>a bundle of fragrant herbs and a flask of balsam oil. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> In a case <b>where</b> the vessels <b>have perfume in them; however,</b> in a case where <b>they do not have perfume in them, she is liable</b> for carrying the flask out into the public domain on Shabbat.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said: That is to say</b> that <b>one who carries out</b> a measure of <b>food</b> that is <b>less than the measure</b> that determines liability on Shabbat, but he does so <b>in a vessel, he is liable.</b> Although he is not liable for carrying the food out into the public domain, he is liable for carrying out the vessel. In that case, the vessel is not subordinate to the food, and therefore it is significant. <b>Since</b> the case of the flask <b>in which there is no perfume is comparable to</b> the case in which there is <b>less than the</b> required <b>measurement</b> of food <b>in a vessel, and it was taught</b> in the case of the flask that <b>she is liable</b> even though the fragrance of the perfume remains in the vessel, it stands to reason that one who carries a vessel containing less than a measure of food is also liable.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> That is no proof because, <b>in general, I would say to you</b> that <b>he is exempt</b> in a case where there is less than the measure that determines liability for food. <b>However, it is different here,</b> in the case of the empty flask of perfume <b>as,</b> in that case, <b>there is no substance</b> at all. Because the vessel is completely empty, he is liable for carrying the flask.

### Part 6
Related to the mention of perfume, the Gemara cites several statements. It is stated: “That drink wine in <i>mizrekei</i>, <b>and anoint themselves with the chief ointments;</b> but they are not grieved for the hurt of Joseph” (Amos 6:6). <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: “</b>The chief ointments” <b>is balsam oil.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Yosef raised an objection</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava issued a decree on balsam oil as well,</b> prohibiting its use due to mourning over the destruction of the Temple, <b>and</b> the Sages <b>did not agree with him. And if you say</b> that balsam oil is the chief ointment cited in the verse, and the decree was issued <b>due to</b> the <b>pleasure</b> it provides, <b>why didn’t</b> the Sages <b>agree with his</b> decree? Doesn’t the verse criticize those who do not feel the pain of the people?

### Part 8
<b>Abaye said to him: And according to your reasoning, that which is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“That drink wine in <i>mizrekei</i>”; Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> disagree over the meaning of the term <i>mizrekei</i>. <b>One said:</b> They are <b>multi-spouted vessels [<i>kenishkanin</i>],</b> wine vessels with spouts from which several people can drink at one time, <b>and one said that they throw [<i>mezarkin</i>] their cups to one another</b> in joy and jest. <b>Is that also prohibited? Didn’t Rabba bar Rav Huna visit the house of the Exilarch and</b> see the Exilarch <b>drink</b> from <b>a multi-spouted vessel, and</b> Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>did not say anything to him?</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> the principle is as follows: With regard to <b>any matter in which there is</b> an element of <b>pleasure and in which there is</b> an element of <b>joy, the Sages issued a decree</b> prohibiting it due to mourning over the destruction of the Temple. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a matter in which there is</b> an element of <b>pleasure and in which there is no</b> element of <b>joy, the Sages did not issue a decree.</b> Since there is no element of joy in balsam oil, even though it is precious and pleasurable, they did not issue a decree prohibiting it.

### Part 10
The Gemara interprets additional verses related to the critique of the leadership of Samaria. It is stated: <b>“That lie upon beds of ivory and stretch [<i>seruḥim</i>] upon their couches</b> and eat the lambs out of the flock and the calves out of the midst of the stall” (Amos 6:4). <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: This</b> term, <i>seruḥim</i>, interpreted homiletically, <b>teaches</b> that their sin was that <b>they would urinate before their beds</b> while <b>naked.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Abbahu ridiculed that</b> interpretation: <b>If so,</b> that this is the meaning of the term <i>seruḥim</i>, <b>is this</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Therefore now they shall go into exile at the head of the exiles</b> and the revelry of those <i>seruḥim</i> shall pass away” (Amos 6:7), <b>because they urinate before their beds</b> while <b>naked they will be exiled at the head of exiles?</b> Although doing so is revolting, a punishment so severe is certainly excessive.

### Part 12
<b>Rather, Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> This verse is referring to a grave sin. <b>These are people who would eat and drink with each other, and join their beds to each other, and swap wives with each other, and defile their beds with semen that was not theirs.</b> That is the meaning of <i>seruḥim</i> upon their couches. For those severe transgressions they deserved to be exiled at the head of exiles.

### Part 13
On a related note, <b>Rabbi Abbahu said, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: Three matters bring a person to</b> a state of <b>poverty</b> as a divine punishment from Heaven: <b>One who urinates before his bed</b> while <b>naked, and one who demeans the ritual washing of the hands, and one whose wife curses him in his presence.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>one who urinates before his bed</b> while <b>naked, Rava said: We only said this</b> prohibition in a case <b>where he turns his face toward his bed</b> and urinates toward it; <b>however,</b> if he turns his face and urinates <b>toward the outer</b> portion of the room, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>

### Part 15
<b>And</b> where <b>one turns his face toward his bed, too, we only said this</b> prohibition in a case <b>where he urinates on the ground; however,</b> if he urinates <b>into a vessel, we have no</b> problem <b>with it</b> since that is not considered disgusting.

### Part 16
With regard to <b>one who demeans the ritual washing of the hands, Rava said: We only said</b> this statement in a case <b>where he does not wash his hands at all; however,</b> if <b>he washes</b> his hands <b>and does not wash</b> them with a significant amount of water, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara notes: <b>And that is not</b> so, <b>as Rav Ḥisda said: I wash</b> my hands <b>with handfuls of water and</b> they <b>gave me</b> in reward <b>handfuls of prosperity.</b> Apparently, in order to garner the benefits of ritual washing of his hands, one should use a significant amount of water.

### Part 18
With regard to <b>one whose wife curses him in his presence, Rava said:</b> This is referring to a case where she curses him <b>over matters</b> relating to <b>her ornaments,</b> i.e., she complains that he does not provide her with jewelry. The Gemara comments: <b>And that applies only when he has</b> the resources to buy her jewelry <b>but does not do</b> so; however, if he does not have sufficient resources he need not be concerned.

### Part 19
Since the Gemara spoke of sins in the First Temple era, it continues to explain other verses with similar content. <b>Rava, son of Rav Ilai, interpreted</b> the following verse <b>homiletically. What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “The Lord says because the daughters of Zion are haughty</b> and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet” (Isaiah 3:16)?<br>“Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,” indicates <b>that they would walk with upright stature</b> and carry themselves in an immodest way.<br><b>“And walk with outstretched necks,”</b> indicates <b>that they would walk</b> in small steps, <b>heel to toe,</b> so onlookers would notice them.<br><b>“Wanton eyes,”</b> indicates <b>that they would fill their eyes with blue eye shadow and beckon.</b><br><b>“Walking and mincing [<i>tafof</i>] as they go,”</b> indicates <b>that the</b> wealthy women <b>would walk</b> a <b>tall</b> woman <b>alongside</b> a <b>short</b> one so that the tall woman would stand out. This is derived from the interchangeability of the letters <i>tet</i> and <i>tzadi</i>; <i>tzafo</i>, meaning, in this case, to be seen.<br><b>“Making a tinkling [<i>te’akasna</i>] with their feet,” Rabbi Yitzḥak from the school of Rabbi Ami said: This teaches that they would place myrrh and balsam in their shoes and would walk in the marketplaces of Jerusalem. And once they approached</b> a place where the <b>young men of Israel</b> were congregated, <b>they would stamp</b> their feet <b>on the ground and splash the perfume toward them and instill the evil inclination into them like venom of a viper [<i>ke’eres bakhos</i>].</b>

### Part 20
<b>What was their punishment</b> for these sins? <b>As Rabba bar Ulla taught: “And it shall come to pass that instead of a sweet smell, there shall be a stench;</b> and instead of a belt, a rope; and instead of well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a fine dress, a girding of sackcloth; instead of beauty, a brand” (Isaiah 3:24). <br>He explains: “And it shall come to pass that instead of a sweet smell there shall be a stench,” indicates that <b>the place that they would perfume became decaying sores.</b><br><b>“And instead of a sash, a rope [<i>nikpe</i>],”</b> indicates that <b>the place where they were girded with a sash became</b> covered with <b>many bruises</b> [<b><i>nekafim</i></b>].<br><b>“And instead of well-set hair, baldness,”</b> indicates that <b>the place where they would style</b> their hair <b>became bald</b> spots.<br><b>“And instead of a fine dress [<i>petigil</i>], a girding of sackcloth,”</b> indicates that the <b>orifices [<i>petaḥim</i>] that lead to pleasure [<i>gil</i>] will become</b> a place <b>for a girding of sackcloth.</b><br><b>“Instead of beauty, a brand [<i>ki</i>],” Rava said: That is</b> the popular expression <b>that people say: Instead of beauty, a sore [<i>kiva</i>].</b>

### Part 21
With regard to a different verse: <b>“The Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion</b> and the Lord will lay bare their secret parts” (Isaiah 3:17). And the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the heads of the daughters of Zion; <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: This teaches that there was an outbreak of leprosy among them. It is written here, scab [<i>sippaḥ</i>], and it is written there,</b> among the types of leprosy: <b>“For a sore, and for a scab [<i>sappaḥat</i>],</b> and for a bright spot” (Leviticus 14:56).

### Part 22
With regard to the verse: <b>And the Lord will lay bare their secret parts [<i>pot’hen ye’areh</i>], Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree. <b>One says:</b> It means <b>that they,</b> i.e., their innards, <b>were poured out [<i>ye’areh</i>] like a jug. And one says: That their orifices [<i>pitḥeihen</i>] were</b> covered with hair as thick <b>as a forest [<i>ya’ar</i>].</b>

### Part 23
On the topic of the sins of Jerusalem and the abundance that existed before its destruction, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: The people of Jerusalem were people of arrogance.</b> They would couch their crude behavior in euphemisms. <b>A person would say to another: On what did you dine today? Well-kneaded bread or bread that is not well-kneaded? On white wine or</b>
