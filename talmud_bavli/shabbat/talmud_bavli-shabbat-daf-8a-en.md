### Part 1
Regarding this assertion, <b>Abaye said: In the private domain, everyone agrees</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> i.e., that the private domain is considered one entity filled from the ground to the sky. <b>However, here</b> this <i>baraita</i> is referring to a special case involving <b>a tree standing in the private domain and its boughs lean into the public domain, and</b> one <b>threw</b> an object from the public domain <b>and it rested</b> upon <b>the boughs</b> of the tree. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that <b>we say: Cast its boughs after its trunk.</b> The tree’s branches are considered an extension of its trunk, therefore the entire tree is considered a private domain, and one who throws onto it is liable. <b>And the</b> Rabbis <b>hold</b> that <b>we do not say: Cast its boughs after its trunk,</b> and therefore the boughs themselves are not considered to be a private domain, but rather an exempt domain, and one who throws atop them from the public domain is not liable.

### Part 2
<b>Abaye said: One who threw a round</b> reed <b>barrel into the public domain,</b> and the barrel is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and</b> its diameter <b>is not six</b> handbreadths <b>wide, is liable.</b> Since its diameter is less than six handbreadths, its area is less than the area of four handbreadths squared. Therefore, this barrel is considered an object, and if he threw it from the private domain to the public domain he is liable. However, if the diameter of the barrel was <b>six</b> handbreadths <b>wide, he is exempt.</b> Since the area of the barrel is greater than the area of four handbreadths squared, it is considered an independent private domain, and he did not perform an act of throwing an object from one domain to another domain.

### Part 3
<b>Rava said: Even if it was not six</b> handbreadths <b>wide he is exempt. What is the reason</b> for this? He is exempt because <b>it is impossible that the ends of the reeds</b> protruding from the weave of the barrel <b>will not extend above ten</b> handbreadths. Consequently, the entire barrel never entered the public domain, as part of it remains in a non-liable place, i.e., ten handbreadths off the ground of the public domain.

### Part 4
If <b>he turned</b> the barrel that is less than six handbreadths wide <b>over on its mouth,</b> i.e., if he threw it with its mouth facing down, even if the barrel was only <b>seven</b> handbreadths <b>and a bit</b> high, <b>he is</b> still <b>liable,</b> as the legal status of this barrel is equivalent to that of any other object that lands there. However, if the height of this barrel was <b>seven and a half</b> handbreadths, he is <b>exempt.</b> Within three handbreadths of the ground, the principle of <i>lavud</i> takes effect: An object within three handbreadths of the ground has the legal status of being connected to the ground. The sides of the barrel extend to the ground and then it is considered as if the barrel already touched the ground of the public domain, even though it is actually still three handbreadths away, while its upper part remains an exempt domain. It is as if this was a barrel higher than ten handbreadths.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Ashi said: Even</b> if the height of the barrel was <b>seven and a half</b> handbreadths, <b>he is liable,</b> as the sides of the barrel are not considered to be higher than they are in reality. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The reason is because <b>partitions are made</b> exclusively <b>for the inside</b> of the barrel. The sides of the barrel play no role beyond the barrel itself, and therefore there is no room to extend the sides by means of the principle of <i>lavud</i>. Therefore, if the barrel itself is not higher than ten handbreadths, it is merely an object.

### Part 6
<b>Ulla said: A pillar</b> that is <b>nine</b> handbreadths high, standing <b>in the public domain, and many</b> people adjust the burden on their <b>shoulders upon it, and one threw</b> an object from the private domain <b>and it rested atop</b> the pillar, <b>he is liable. What is the reason</b> for this? It is based on this principle: Anything protruding from the public domain: If it is <b>less than three</b> handbreadths off the ground, and the <b>multitudes step on it,</b> it is considered to be part of the ground. If it is <b>from three to nine</b> handbreadths, <b>they,</b> the multitudes, <b>neither step on it nor</b> adjust the burden on their <b>shoulders</b> on it, and it is not considered part of the public domain. However, a protrusion <b>nine</b> handbreadths high, <b>certainly</b> the multitudes adjust the burden on their <b>shoulders on it.</b> Since the multitudes utilize it, it is considered a public domain, despite its height.

### Part 7
Based on Ulla’s statement, <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: A hole</b> in the ground of the public domain, which is several handbreadths deep, <b>what is</b> its legal status? Is it also considered, in accordance with Ulla’s principle, part of the public domain? In general, with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, there is no distinction between an area elevated above its surroundings and an area depressed below its surroundings. Rav Yosef <b>said to him: And the same</b> is true <b>in a hole;</b> these <i>halakhot</i> apply. <b>Rava said: In a hole,</b> these <i>halakhot</i> do <b>not</b> apply. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Since <b>use under duress is not considered use,</b> and the use of a pit even if it is nine handbreadths deep is inconvenient, and it is not comparable to a pillar of the same height.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Adda bar Mattana raised an objection to Rava’s</b> opinion from that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One whose basket was placed in the public domain</b> and it was <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four wide, one may neither move</b> an object <b>from it to the public domain nor from the public domain to it,</b> since its legal status is that of a private domain. If it were <b>less than that</b> height, <b>one may carry</b> from it to the public domain and vice versa. The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And the same</b> is true <b>for a hole. Is this</b> statement <b>not</b> referring <b>to the latter</b> clause of the <i>baraita</i>: One may carry from a pit which is less than ten handbreadths deep to the public domain? This supports the opinion of Rav Yosef, that a hole is subsumed within the public domain. Rava rejected this: This statement is <b>not</b> referring to the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>, but rather <b>to the first</b> clause of the <i>baraita</i>: It is like a basket in that one may not carry from a hole ten handbreadths deep to the public domain because it is a full-fledged private domain. However, no conclusion may be drawn with regard to a hole less than ten handbreadths deep.

### Part 9
Rav Adda bar Mattana <b>raised</b> another <b>objection</b> to Rava’s opinion from what was taught in a different <i>baraita</i>, which deals with the laws of joining of borders:
