that <b>his mother</b> would <b>bring him</b> wheat <b>in a trough.</b> In other words, she would guard the wheat grains from when they were harvested by placing them in vessels and guarding them until Passover.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain boat</b> carrying <b>wheat, which capsized</b> before Passover <b>in</b> the <b>Ḥishta</b> River. <b>Rava permitted</b> its owners <b>to sell</b> the recovered grain <b>to gentiles</b> during Passover.

### Part 3
<b>Rabba bar Levai raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a garment in which diverse kinds,</b> a prohibited mixture of wool and linen, <b>has been lost,</b> i.e., a wool garment into which a linen thread was sewn or vice versa, <b>one</b> may <b>not sell it to a gentile; and one</b> may <b>not</b> even <b>fashion it</b> into <b>a saddlecloth for a donkey.</b> It is prohibited to do so lest one remove a piece of this garment and sew it onto his own clothing. <b>However, one</b> may <b>fashion it</b> into <b>a shroud for a dead body,</b> as there is no concern that he will remove it from the dead.

### Part 4
The Gemara clarifies this issue: <b>What is the reason</b> that one may <b>not</b> sell it <b>to a gentile?</b> Is it <b>not due to</b> the concern <b>that</b> the gentile <b>will resell it to a Jew?</b> Since the mixture of wool and linen is not visible, it is possible for a Jew to use this cloth unawares. The same concern applies to grain: It is not apparent that the grain that capsized in the river is prohibited. It should therefore be prohibited to sell this wheat to gentiles, lest they resell it to Jews.

### Part 5
<b>Rava</b> reconsidered and <b>then said: He should sell</b> this wheat <b>one <i>kav</i> at a time,</b> i.e., in small measures, each <b>to</b> a different <b>Jew,</b> but not to any one Jew in large quantities, <b>so that</b> all of this wheat <b>will be used before Passover.</b> By selling it in this manner, all the grain will be used quickly and no one will unwittingly eat these leavened grains on Passover.

### Part 6
<b>The Sages taught: One</b> may <b>not stir</b> flour into <b>a pot</b> of food <b>on Passover</b> to absorb the foam that has accumulated during the cooking process. <b>And one who wishes to stir</b> flour should <b>add the flour and afterward add vinegar,</b> which will prevent the flour from becoming leavened. <b>And some say:</b> One may <b>even add vinegar and afterward add the flour,</b> as vinegar prevents flour from becoming leavened even after the flour is diluted in water.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> whose opinion is introduced by the phrase <b>some say?</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>a stew pot or a pot</b> of food <b>that one removed</b> from the fire when it was <b>seething,</b> one may <b>not add spices to them on Shabbat. However, one</b> may <b>add</b> spices <b>to a dish or to</b> the large <b>plate</b> into which the food is poured from the pot. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One</b> may <b>add</b> spices <b>to any</b> food that has been removed from the fire, <b>except to</b> a dish <b>that contains vinegar or brine,</b> as this food is considered as though it were still seething, due to the pungency of the vinegar or brine. Since Rabbi Yehuda maintains that vinegar has the same effect as boiling, he would agree that vinegar, like boiling water, prevents flour from becoming leavened.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And let us establish</b> the opinion of: Some say, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Yosei says,</b> with regard to wheat grains that were soaked in water: <b>One</b> should <b>soak them in vinegar, and</b> this <b>vinegar will cause</b> the wheat <b>to contract</b> and prevent it from becoming leavened.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>When we learn</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> this <b>applies</b> only to a situation <b>where</b> the vinegar is <b>in its pure,</b> unadulterated form, in which case its pungency prevents the wheat from becoming leavened. <b>However,</b> if the vinegar is added <b>by means of a mixture, no,</b> Rabbi Yosei’s statement does not apply to a case of this kind.

### Part 11
<b>Ulla said:</b> In <b>both</b> of <b>these</b> cases, whether the vinegar is added first or afterward, its use is <b>prohibited,</b> as one must avoid scenarios that might lead to a prohibition, <b>as per</b> the well-known adage: <b>Go around, go around,</b> and <b>do not approach the vineyard, they say to the nazirite.</b> Since a nazirite is prohibited from drinking wine and eating grapes, it is preferable for him to avoid a vineyard entirely. A similar principle applies to other prohibitions.

### Part 12
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Pappi permitted the cooks [<i>burdikei</i>] of the household of the Exilarch to mash roasted grains into a pot</b> of food, to dissolve the accumulated foam. <b>Rava said: Is there</b> anyone <b>who permits this matter in a place where servants are found?</b> Servants are unlikely to be careful with regard to these prohibitions. They will use raw flour for this purpose, which will lead to a violation of the prohibition against leavened bread on Passover. <b>Some say</b> that <b>Rava himself</b> would <b>add roasted grains into</b> his own <b>pot.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One</b> may <b>not add flour to <i>ḥaroset</i>,</b> a seasoned, pungent food, <b>or to mustard,</b> to dull the sharp taste. In both cases, the pungency of these foods might accelerate the leavening of the flour. <b>And if one added</b> flour to either of these, the mixture may <b>be eaten immediately</b> before it is leavened; <b>and Rabbi Meir prohibits</b> this, lest the food be leavened immediately.

### Part 14
The mishna continues: <b>One</b> may <b>not boil the Paschal</b> lamb <b>in</b> ordinary <b>liquids or in fruit juices,</b> as the Torah explicitly states that it must be roasted. <b>However,</b> one may <b>baste</b> it while it is roasting <b>and dip it into</b> liquid while eating it.

### Part 15
The <i>tanna</i> further states: <b>Water that has been used by a baker</b> for cooling his hands or washing dishes should <b>be poured out, because</b> this water <b>leavens</b> the dough, as the water probably contains a small quantity of flour and dough.

### Part 16
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis concerns a case where one adds flour <b>to mustard,</b> which is extremely pungent and will not leaven the flour immediately. <b>But</b> in a case where flour is added <b>to</b> the less pungent <b><i>ḥaroset</i>,</b> which will leaven the flour quickly, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the mixture must <b>be burned immediately.</b>

### Part 17
<b>And that</b> opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> may <b>not add flour to <i>ḥaroset</i>, and if one did add</b> flour it should <b>be burned immediately.</b> With regard to flour that was added <b>to mustard, Rabbi Meir says:</b> It should <b>be burned immediately, and the Rabbis say:</b> It should <b>be eaten immediately,</b> before it is leavened. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehuda, said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> concerning this issue. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehuda:</b>
