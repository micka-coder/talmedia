### Part 1
If one <b>slaughtered</b> the Paschal lamb <b>for</b> people who are <b>circumcised on condition that uncircumcised</b> people <b>achieve atonement through the sprinkling</b> of its blood, i.e., although the uncircumcised people are prohibited from eating the Paschal lamb, it was his intention that they achieve atonement through the blood of the offering, <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The offering is <b>disqualified. Rabba said:</b> It is <b>valid.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> it is <b>disqualified</b> because <b>intent</b> that the offering should be <b>for uncircumcised</b> people has sufficient force to disqualify the offering <b>at</b> the time of <b>the sprinkling. Rabba said</b> that it is <b>valid</b> because <b>intent</b> that the offering should be for <b>uncircumcised</b> people can only disqualify the offering during the slaughter and <b>not during the sprinkling.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabba said: From where do I</b> derive to <b>say this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: I <b>might</b> have thought that an uncircumcised person <b>would disqualify the</b> other fit <b>members of the group who come with him. And</b> it may be inferred <b>logically</b> to the contrary that he does not disqualify the others: <b>Since lack of circumcision disqualifies</b> a Paschal lamb slaughtered for that person, <b>and</b> similarly, <b>ritual impurity disqualifies</b> it, the following can be said: <b>Just as</b> with <b>ritual impurity, partial impurity was not made to be like full impurity,</b> meaning that if one member of the group for which the offering is slaughtered is ritually impure, the offering is not disqualified for the entire group, <b>so too, with lack of circumcision; partial lack of circumcision was not made to be like full lack of circumcision,</b> meaning that if one member of the group is uncircumcised, the offering is not disqualified as it would be if all members of the group were uncircumcised.

### Part 3
<b>Or</b> perhaps <b>go this way</b> and maintain the following: <b>Since lack of circumcision disqualifies</b> the offering, <b>and</b> similarly, intent to eat the offering beyond the allotted <b>time disqualifies</b> the offering, this can be said: <b>Just as</b> if one said at the time of the slaughter that he intended to eat part of the offering beyond the allotted <b>time, partial</b> invalid intent <b>was made to be like</b> intent to eat the <b>entire</b> offering at an invalid <b>time,</b> and the offering is disqualified, <b>so too, with lack of circumcision; partial lack of circumcision was made to be like full lack of circumcision,</b> and the offering is disqualified.

### Part 4
<b>Let us see to which it is similar,</b> i.e., which comparison seems more reasonable: Do <b>we derive a matter,</b> namely, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to uncircumcised males, <b>that does not apply to all offerings, from</b> another <b>matter,</b> namely, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the ritually impure, <b>that does not apply to all offerings,</b> as when it comes to other offerings, one who is ritually impure may send his offering with a proxy and thereby achieve atonement? <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to intent to eat the offering beyond the allotted <b>time, which applies to all</b> other <b>offerings, should not</b> be used to <b>prove</b> anything about our case.

### Part 5
<b>Or,</b> perhaps, <b>go this way: We derive a matter,</b> namely, the law with regard to uncircumcised males, <b>for which no allowance</b> is made <b>from its rule, from a matter,</b> namely improper intent with regard to the time, <b>for which no allowance</b> is made <b>from its rule,</b> as there are no exceptions for either of these two disqualifications. <b>And</b> the law with regard to <b>ritual impurity should not</b> be used to <b>prove</b> anything, <b>as</b> there are circumstances in which <b>an allowance</b> is made <b>from its rule.</b> Under certain circumstances it is permitted to offer the Paschal lamb while ritually impure, such as when the entire Jewish people is ritually impure.

### Part 6
In order to resolve this issue, <b>the verse states: “This,”</b> as it says: “And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: This is the ordinance of the Passover: No stranger shall eat of it; but every man’s servant that is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat of it” (Exodus 12:43–44). <b>What</b> is implied from the emphasis of <b>“this”? If you say</b> that it comes to teach that if <b>all</b> the members of the group are <b>uncircumcised</b> the offering is <b>disqualified,</b> but if only <b>part of</b> the group is uncircumcised <b>it is not disqualified, this is derived from</b> the words <b>“and all uncircumcised males,”</b> in the verse: “And all uncircumcised males shall not eat of it” (Exodus 12:48). The amplification indicated by the word all teaches that the offering is invalidated only if all members of the group are uncircumcised.

### Part 7
<b>Rather, is this not what it is teaching: The verse states: “And all uncircumcised</b> males,” to teach that only if <b>all</b> members of the group are <b>uncircumcised is</b> the offering <b>disqualified,</b> but if only <b>part</b> of the group is <b>uncircumcised it is not disqualified. And if you say</b> that <b>the same is true of sprinkling</b> the blood of the offering, i.e., that if it is done for a group whose members are <b>all uncircumcised,</b> the offering <b>is in any event disqualified;</b> therefore <b>the verse states: “This,”</b> to restrict application of this law and teach: <b>It is during slaughter that if all</b> members of a group are <b>uncircumcised,</b> the offering <b>is disqualified; but during sprinkling, even</b> if <b>all</b> members of the group are <b>uncircumcised, it is not disqualified.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And if you say: What is the leniency of sprinkling</b> such that this intent for a group whose members are all uncircumcised disqualifies the offering only during the slaughter but not during the sprinkling? Rabba’s reasoning is that <b>there is no intent concerning those who may eat</b> of the offering <b>during the sprinkling.</b> Intent to feed the Paschal lamb to those who are unable to eat it invalidates the offering only during the slaughter, but not during the sprinkling.

### Part 9
<b>And Rav Ḥisda</b> is of the opinion that, <b>on the contrary,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should be understood <b>in the opposite direction. The verse states: “And all uncircumcised</b> males,” teaching that only if <b>all</b> the members of the group are <b>uncircumcised is</b> the offering <b>disqualified,</b> but if only <b>part</b> of the group is <b>uncircumcised, it is not disqualified.</b> This applies during slaughter; <b>however,</b> during the <b>sprinkling, even</b> if only <b>part</b> of the group is uncircumcised <b>it is disqualified. And if you say</b> that <b>the same is true of sprinkling</b> in <b>that</b> the offering <b>is not disqualified unless all</b> members are uncircumcised; therefore <b>the verse states “this”</b> to restrict the application of this <i>halakha</i> and teach that it is only during <b>slaughter that part of</b> the group <b>does not disqualify</b> the offering, <b>but</b> during the <b>sprinkling even part of</b> the group <b>disqualifies</b> the offering.

### Part 10
<b>And if you say: What is the stringency of sprinkling</b> such that part of the group being uncircumcised disqualifies the offering during the sprinkling, but not during slaughter? The answer is that <b><i>piggul</i></b> status <b>is established only during sprinkling.</b> The status of <i>piggul</i> applies to an offering when one performs at least one of the rites with the intent that the offering be consumed outside the allotted time, but only if no rite was performed with some other invalid intent, such as intending that the offering be eaten outside its designated place. This can only be confirmed at the time of the sprinkling, which is the last of the four essential rites. Consequently, sprinkling is the rite most likely to disqualify an offering due to improper intent.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ashi strongly objects to this</b> method of interpretation: <b>From where</b> do you derive <b>that this</b> expression <b>“and all uncircumcised</b> males” <b>means that all</b> the members of the group are uncircumcised? <b>Perhaps this</b> expression <b>“and all [<i>kol</i>] uncircumcised</b> males” <b>means that any</b> of its members <b>is uncircumcised.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One says</b> in the Torah: <b>“This,”</b> to teach that the offering <b>is not disqualified unless all of it</b>s members are <b>uncircumcised,</b> and <b>there is no difference between slaughtering and sprinkling.</b> Therefore, the dispute between Rabba and Rav Ḥisda must be based on some other proof text and issue. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: Rav Ḥisda and Rabba</b>
