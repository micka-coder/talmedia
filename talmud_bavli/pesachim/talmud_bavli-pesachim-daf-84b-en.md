### Part 1
<b>this one is disqualified,</b> and the prohibition does not apply. However, <b>according to the one who says</b> that it depends on whether the offering is <b>fit for eating, this</b> offering that is brought in a state of ritual impurity <b>is also fit for eating,</b> and the prohibition of breaking a bone therefore applies.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yosef said: In a case like this,</b> in which the Paschal lamb was brought in a state of ritual impurity, <b>everyone agrees that it is not subject to</b> the prohibition <b>of breaking a bone.</b> This is <b>because Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi only <b>came to be lenient, and this</b> offering <b>is disqualified</b> due to the fact that it is ritually impure, despite the fact that such an offering is accepted and therefore obligatory.

### Part 3
<b>Rather, the practical difference between them is</b> with regard to a Paschal lamb that <b>had a time when it was valid and</b> then <b>became disqualified. According to the one who says</b> that the verse should be understood as indicating that the prohibition of breaking a bone applies only to <b>a valid</b> Paschal lamb, <b>this one is valid</b> and the prohibition applies. <b>According to the one who says</b> that the prohibition applies only to an offering that is <b>fit for eating, it is not fit for eating now,</b> and therefore the prohibition does not apply.

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said: In any case like this, everyone agrees that it is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone. What is the reason? Now, at least, it is disqualified. Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>breaking a bone while it is still day</b> on Passover eve <b>is the practical difference between them. According to the one who says</b> the verse should be understood as applying the prohibition to any Paschal lamb that is <b>valid, this one is valid</b> and the prohibition applies. <b>According to the one who says</b> the prohibition applies to a Paschal lamb that is <b>fit for eating, now it is not fit for eating</b> and therefore the prohibition does not yet apply.

### Part 5
<b>The Gemara raises an objection: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One may register for</b> a Paschal lamb to eat <b>the marrow of the head, and one may not register for</b> the purpose of eating <b>the marrow of the thigh bone.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is the reason</b> one may register for <b>the marrow of the head?</b> It is <b>since one can extract it</b> from inside the head <b>and remove it</b> without breaking any of the bones, which is not the case with regard to marrow from the thigh bone. <b>And if it should enter your mind</b> to say <b>that breaking a bone while it is still day seems well,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi should hold that <b>we may break the thigh bone as well and remove its marrow, and</b> it should be permitted to <b>register for it.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara responds: <b>Abaye could have said to you: And according to your reasoning, after nightfall</b> there is <b>also</b> a permissible way to consume the marrow of the thigh bone: <b>We should bring a coal, and place it on</b> the bone, <b>and burn it, and remove its marrow, and</b> therefore it should be permissible to <b>register for it, for it was taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>But one who burns bones</b> of the Paschal lamb <b>and one who cuts sinews do not</b> transgress the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rather, what have you to say</b> in order to explain why one may not remove the marrow from the thigh bone by burning the bone? It must be due to a rabbinic prohibition. Why did the Sages enact this prohibition? <b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>because</b> the heat might cause the bone to <b>burst</b> at a location other than where the coal is placed, which would be considered breaking rather than burning. <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>due to ruining sacrificial food, as one</b> who burns a hole in the bone <b>ruins it actively</b> because <b>it is possible that the fire will consume some of its marrow.</b> Similarly, breaking a bone <b>while it is still day is also</b> prohibited due to rabbinic <b>decree.</b> The Sages prohibited the breaking a bone while it still day <b>due to</b> the concern lest one do so <b>after dark.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> With regard to <b>any case like this, everyone agrees it is subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone. What is the reason?</b> It is because <b>at night it will be fit for eating. Rather,</b> it is <b>with regard to a portion of a limb</b> that <b>has gone out</b> of its permissible boundary and thereby become disqualified that <b>they disagree.</b> In such an instance, one removes the disqualified part in order to be able to eat the rest, and the Sages disagree about whether one may cut the bone. According to <b>the one who said</b> that the verse limits the prohibition of breaking a bone to a Paschal lamb that is <b>valid, this one is valid,</b> and it is therefore prohibited to break a bone. <b>And</b> according to <b>the one who said</b> the prohibition applies to any Paschal lamb that is <b>fit for eating, this one is not fit for eating,</b> and it should therefore be permitted to break its bones.

### Part 9
<b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> If <b>a portion of a limb has gone out</b> of its permissible boundary <b>and one broke it,</b> one has not transgressed. <b>It is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone. This is</b> in accordance with the view that the prohibition of breaking bones applies only to a Paschal lamb that is fit for eating.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> With regard to <b>any case like this, everyone agrees that it is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone, as this limb is disqualified</b> and not merely unfit for eating. <b>Rather, breaking a bone</b> of a Paschal lamb <b>when</b> it is not yet fully roasted and still <b>raw is the practical difference between them.</b> According to <b>the one who said</b> the prohibition applies only to a Paschal lamb that is <b>valid, this one is valid,</b> and it is therefore prohibited to break a bone. <b>And</b> according to <b>the one who said</b> the prohibition applies to any Paschal lamb that is <b>fit for eating,</b> the prohibition does not apply to this offering because <b>now it is not fit for eating.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Any case like this is subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone. What is the reason?</b> It is <b>because it is</b> still considered <b>fit for eating,</b> since one can <b>roast it and eat it. Rather, breaking</b> a bone in <b>the tail is the practical difference between them. According to the one who says</b> the prohibition applies to any Paschal lamb that is <b>valid, this one is valid</b> and the prohibition applies. <b>According to the one who says</b> the prohibition applies to any Paschal lamb that is <b>fit for eating, this is not fit for eating, as the tail</b> is consecrated <b>to God,</b> meaning that it is burned on the altar.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Ashi said: A case like this is certainly not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone, as</b> the tail <b>is certainly not fit for eating at all. Rather,</b> the case of <b>a limb upon which there is not an olive-bulk of meat is the practical difference between them. According to the one who says</b> the prohibition applies to any Paschal lamb that is <b>valid, this is valid,</b> and the prohibition applies. <b>According to the one who says</b> the prohibition applies to any Paschal lamb that is <b>fit for eating, we require the</b> minimal <b>measure of</b> meat that would constitute an act of <b>eating, and there is not</b> enough meat on this bone; therefore, the prohibition does not apply.

### Part 13
<b>Ravina said: Any case like this is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone, as we require the</b> minimal <b>measure</b> of meat that would constitute an act of <b>eating. Rather,</b> the case of <b>a limb upon which there is not an olive-bulk of meat in this place and there is an olive-bulk of meat in another place is the practical difference between them. According to the one who says</b> the prohibition applies to any Paschal lamb that is <b>valid, this one is valid,</b> and it is prohibited to break a bone. <b>According to the one who says</b> the prohibition applies to any Paschal lamb that is <b>fit for eating, we require the</b> minimal <b>measure</b> of meat that would constitute an act of <b>eating in the place of the break, and there is not</b> enough meat there. Therefore, the prohibition of breaking a bone does not apply.

### Part 14
The Gemara points out that <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with four of</b> the interpretations cited above. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The verse <b>“In one house shall it be eaten…and you shall not break a bone in it”</b> (Exodus 12:46) teaches that <b>one is liable for</b> breaking the bone of <b>a valid</b> Paschal lamb, <b>and one is not liable for</b> breaking the bone of a <b>disqualified</b> Paschal lamb.

### Part 15
If <b>it had a time in which it was valid and it became disqualified at the time of eating, it is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone.</b> This supports the opinion of Rav Yosef.

### Part 16
If <b>it has the</b> minimal <b>measure</b> of meat that would constitute an act of <b>eating, it is subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone; if it does not have the</b> minimal <b>measure</b> of meat necessary to constitute an act of <b>eating, it is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone.</b> This supports the opinion of both Rav Ashi and Ravina.

### Part 17
<b>That which is fit for the altar,</b> such as the tail, <b>is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone.</b> This supports the opinion of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak.

### Part 18
<b>At the time of eating, it is subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone; when it is not the time for eating, it is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone.</b> This supports the opinion of Abaye.

### Part 19
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> argued about the following matter: In the case of <b>a limb upon which there is not an olive-bulk of meat in this place</b> in which one breaks the bone, <b>and there is an olive-bulk of meat in a different place,</b> has one violated the prohibition of breaking a bone? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: It is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone.</b>

### Part 20
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall not break a bone in it,”</b> which indicates that the prohibition applies to <b>both a bone upon which there is an olive-bulk of meat and a bone upon which there is not an olive-bulk of meat. What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>Upon which there is not an olive-bulk of meat? If we say that it does not have an olive-bulk of meat on it at all,</b> it is not fit for eating at all. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>is it subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>breaking a bone? Rather, is it not</b> true that <b>this is what it is saying:</b> The prohibition applies <b>both</b> to <b>a bone upon which there is an olive-bulk of meat in this place, and</b> to a bone <b>upon which there is not an olive-bulk of meat in this place and there is an olive-bulk of meat in a different place?</b> This poses <b>a difficulty to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish.</b>

### Part 21
<b>He said to him:</b>
