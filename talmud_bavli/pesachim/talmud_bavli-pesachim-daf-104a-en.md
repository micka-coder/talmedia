### Part 1
<b>But the Master did not say three</b> distinctions, <b>nor did he say seven,</b> as he actually mentioned four distinctions. <b>He said to him: In truth,</b> that is inaccurate, as the distinction <b>between the seventh day and the six days of work</b> is not considered a separate statement of distinction. Rather, this distinction is mentioned because it is <b>similar to the conclusion</b> of the blessing, <b>and Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: One who recites <i>havdala</i> must say</b> an expression that is <b>similar to the conclusion near the conclusion</b> of the blessing, to emphasize the connection between the blessing and its conclusion. <b>And the</b> scholars <b>of Pumbedita say</b> that one must say a phrase <b>similar to the beginnings</b> of blessings <b>near their conclusions.</b>

### Part 2
With regard to the previously cited dispute, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between them?</b> Since the beginning and end of a blessing generally address the same topic, what is the difference between these two opinions? The Gemara responds: <b>The</b> practical difference <b>between them is</b> in the case of <b>a Festival that occurs after Shabbat, as one concludes</b> this <i>havdala</i> with the phrase: Who separates <b>between sacred and sacred.</b>

### Part 3
<b>The one who said</b> that one must mention an expression <b>similar to</b> the <b>beginnings</b> of blessings <b>near their conclusions</b> would say that one is <b>not required to say: Between the sanctity of Shabbat and the sanctity of the Festival You have distinguished,</b> before concluding the blessing, as the beginning of the blessing refers simply to the sacred and the profane. <b>And</b> according to <b>the one who said</b> that one must say a phrase <b>similar to</b> the <b>conclusions</b> of blessings <b>near their conclusions,</b> one is <b>required to say: Between the sanctity of Shabbat and the sanctity of the Festival You have distinguished.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara returns to the aforementioned matter <b>itself. Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya said: One who decreases</b> the number of distinctions mentioned in <i>havdala</i> should <b>not decrease</b> their number to less <b>than three, and one who increases</b> their number should <b>not increase</b> them to <b>more than seven.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One says</b> statements of <b>distinctions at the conclusion of Shabbat, and at the conclusion of Festivals, and at the conclusion of Yom Kippur, and at the conclusion of Shabbat</b> that leads <b>into a Festival, and at the conclusion of a Festival</b> that leads <b>into the intermediate days</b> of a Festival. <b>However,</b> one does <b>not</b> mention distinctions <b>at the conclusion of a Festival</b> that leads <b>into Shabbat,</b> as the sanctity of Shabbat is greater than that of a Festival. <b>One who is accustomed</b> to reciting distinctions may <b>recite many</b> distinctions, <b>and one who is not accustomed</b> to doing so <b>recites</b> only <b>one</b> distinction. This ruling implies that there is no absolute requirement to mention more than one distinction.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The son of sacred ones recites</b> only <b>one</b> distinction, but <b>the people were accustomed to recite three</b> distinctions. The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> this person called <b>the son of sacred ones?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Menaḥem bar Simai. And why did they call him the son of sacred ones?</b> Because <b>he would not look at the forms on coins,</b> which were occasionally idolatrous symbols or some other prohibited image. The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Shmuel bar Idi sent</b> Rabbi Menaḥem bar Simai the following message: <b>My brother Ḥananya says</b> that one should mention only <b>one</b> distinction. However, the Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> that opinion.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who recites <i>havdala</i> must say</b> distinctions <b>similar to the distinctions stated</b> explicitly <b>in the Torah.</b> One should not add other distinctions. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How</b> should one say <b>the order of the distinctions</b> in <i>havdala</i>? <b>One recites: Who distinguishes between sacred and profane: Between light and darkness; between Israel and the nations; and between the seventh day and the six days of work; between the ritually impure and the ritually pure; between the sea and the dry land; between the upper waters</b> above the firmament <b>and the lower waters</b> below the firmament; and <b>between priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> This is an extended version of <i>havdala</i>, which includes references to seven distinctions.

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And one concludes</b> the blessing <b>with the order of Creation:</b> Blessed is He Who arranges the order of Creation, or: Who orders Creation. <b>And others say</b> that one concludes <b>with: Who fashions Creation. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says</b> that <b>one concludes with</b> the phrase: <b>Who sanctifies Israel.</b> The Gemara explains its objection: <b>And if</b> what Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said <b>is so,</b> the distinction <b>between the sea and the dry land</b> should not be mentioned, as the term <b>distinction is not written with regard to</b> this issue. The Gemara answers: <b>Remove from here</b> the distinction <b>between the sea and the dry land.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the distinction <b>between the seventh day and the six days of work</b> should <b>also</b> not be counted in the tally of the distinctions, as it <b>is</b> mentioned only to repeat something <b>similar to the conclusion.</b> Consequently, this text of <i>havdala</i> <b>lacks one</b> more distinction, <b>and</b> this means that <b>there are not seven</b> distinctions in total.

### Part 10
<b>They say</b> in answer to this question: The distinction between <b>priests, Levites, and Israelites is two matters,</b> i.e., it counts as two separate distinctions. One distinction is <b>between Levites and Israelites, as it is written: “At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi</b> to bear the Ark of the covenant of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 10:8). A further distinction is that <b>between the priests and the Levites, as it is written: “The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should be sanctified as most holy,</b> he and his sons forever” (I Chronicles 23:13).

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> formula should be used <b>to conclude</b> the blessing of <i>havdala</i>? <b>Rav said</b> the blessing should conclude with the phrase: <b>Who sanctifies Israel. And Shmuel said</b> the concluding phrase is: <b>Who distinguishes between sacred and profane.</b> The Gemara adds that <b>Abaye, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Yosef, cursed it,</b> i.e., he would become angry at one who concluded the blessing in accordance with <b>that</b> opinion <b>of Rav.</b>

### Part 12
<b>It was taught in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: Anyone who concludes</b> the <i>havdala</i> blessing with the combined formula: <b>Who sanctifies Israel and distinguishes between sacred and profane,</b> God will <b>lengthen his days and years.</b>
