### Part 1
<b>so one interrupts for <i>havdala</i>?</b> People eating a meal on Shabbat until after nightfall must interrupt their meal to recite <i>havdala</i>. The Gemara inquires: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>One interrupts?</b> Is it <b>not</b> referring <b>to removing the table?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> spreading <b>a cloth,</b> which is sufficient for <i>havdala</i> as well.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna happened</b> to come <b>to the house of the Exilarch.</b> His hosts were reclining for a meal, <b>and</b> the attendants <b>brought a table before him</b> so he could eat as well. Since Shabbat had already started, <b>he spread a cloth</b> over the food <b>and recited <i>kiddush</i>. That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> the Sages <b>agree that one</b> may <b>bring the table only if he has</b> already <b>recited <i>kiddush</i>; and if one brought</b> out the table before <i>kiddush</i>, he should <b>spread a cloth</b> over the food <b>and recite <i>kiddush</i>.</b>

### Part 3
<b>It was taught in one</b> <i>baraita</i>: Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei, who disagree over whether it is permitted to eat from <i>miná¸¥a</i> time on Shabbat eve and whether one must interrupt his meal, <b>agree that one</b> may <b>not begin</b> a meal from this time. <b>And it was taught in the other</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>they agree that one</b> may <b>begin</b> a meal. The Gemara explains: <b>Granted, that which was taught</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, that Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei <b>agree that one</b> may <b>not begin</b> a meal, <b>you will find</b> that this is correct <b>with regard to the eve of Passover,</b> as even Rabbi Yosei concedes that one may not start a meal on Passover eve <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 4
<b>However,</b> with regard to the other <i>baraita</i>, <b>which taught</b> that Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei <b>agree that one</b> may <b>begin, when</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply? <b>If we say</b> it is referring to <b>the eve of Shabbat,</b> this cannot be the case, as it was taught that Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei indeed <b>disagree</b> over whether one may start a meal at that time. The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> in which Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei agree that it is permitted to start a new meal, is referring to <b>before nine hours</b> of the day have passed, as everyone agrees that it is permitted to commence a meal at this time. Conversely, <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> in which they disagree over whether it is permitted to start a new meal, is referring to later in the day, <b>after nine hours.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara continues to discuss the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>kiddush</i>: With regard to <b>those people who recited <i>kiddush</i> in the synagogue,</b> as was customarily done at the conclusion of the prayer service on Shabbat night, <b>Rav said: They have not fulfilled</b> their obligation to recite a blessing <b>over wine.</b> That is, the blessing over the wine in the synagogue does not enable them to drink wine at home without an additional blessing. However, <b>they have fulfilled</b> their obligation <b>of</b> reciting <b><i>kiddush</i>. And Shmuel said:</b>
