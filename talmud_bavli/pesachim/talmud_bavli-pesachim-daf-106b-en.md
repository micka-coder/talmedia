### Part 1
<b>One who washes his hands</b> should <b>not recite <i>kiddush</i></b> after washing, as this would constitute an interruption between washing and eating, and he will have to wash again. Instead, he should hear <i>kiddush</i> from someone else. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta said to them: Not</b> a lot of time has <b>yet</b> passed since <b>Rav died,</b> and <b>we have</b> already <b>forgotten his</b> halakhic <b>rulings. Many times I stood before Rav</b> and saw that <b>sometimes he preferred bread,</b> and <b>he would recite <i>kiddush</i> over bread.</b> On those occasions Rav would wash his hands, recite <i>kiddush</i> over the bread, and eat it. <b>At</b> other <b>times he preferred wine</b> and <b>would recite <i>kiddush</i> over wine.</b> This shows that <i>kiddush</i> is not considered an interruption between washing one’s hands and eating bread.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> One who has <b>tasted</b> any food on Shabbat night may <b>not recite <i>kiddush</i></b> anymore that night, as one must recite <i>kiddush</i> before he eats. Instead, he recites <i>kiddush</i> during the day before the meal. <b>Rav Ḥana bar Ḥinnana raised a dilemma before Rav Huna:</b> If one <b>tasted</b> food at the conclusion of Shabbat before reciting <i>havdala</i>, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to</b> whether <b>he</b> may <b>recite <i>havdala</i>? He said to him: I say</b> that one who has <b>tasted</b> food may still <b>recite <i>havdala</i>. And Rav Asi said:</b> One who has <b>tasted</b> food may <b>not recite <i>havdala</i>.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba happened to</b> come to <b>the house of Rav Asi. He forgot and tasted some</b> food after Shabbat before <i>havdala</i>. <b>They gave him a cup and he recited <i>havdala</i>.</b> Later, Rav Asi’s <b>wife said to</b> her husband: <b>But</b> my <b>Master does not act this way.</b> In your opinion, one who eats before <i>havdala</i> does not recite <i>havdala</i>. <b>He said to her: Leave</b> Rav Yirmeya bar Abba. <b>He maintains in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>his rabbi.</b> Rav Yirmeya bar Abba was a student of Rav, who ruled that even one who has eaten may recite <i>havdala</i>.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> One who has <b>tasted</b> food before <i>kiddush</i> may <b>not recite <i>kiddush</i>,</b> and <b>one who has tasted</b> food before <i>havdala</i> may <b>not recite <i>havdala</i>. And Rabba said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> One who has <b>tasted</b> may nevertheless <b>recite <i>kiddush</i>, and one who has tasted</b> may likewise <b>recite <i>havdala</i>.</b>
