### Part 1
<b>The decision</b> of the <b>third</b> opinion of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, is <b>not</b> considered <b>a decision</b> in this case, as the other two Sages do not raise the issue of a stumbling block at all.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua with regard to a barrel of <i>teruma</i> that broke in an upper press and was flowing down into the lower press applies only to a case <b>where</b> one <i>se’a</i> of <i>teruma</i> <b>fell into less than one hundred <i>se’a</i> of impure, non-sacred</b> wine in the lower press.

### Part 3
<b>However,</b> if the <i>teruma</i> wine <b>fell into one hundred</b> <i>se’a</i> of <b>ritually impure, non-sacred</b> produce, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the wine should be allowed to <b>descend and become ritually impure</b> by itself, <b>and one</b> should <b>not</b> actively <b>render it impure with</b> his <b>hand.</b> The reason is that if <i>teruma</i> falls into non-sacred produce one hundred times greater in quantity than itself, the <i>teruma</i> is nullified by the non-sacred produce, and therefore, it would be permitted for a non-priest to eat it. Although it becomes ritually impure, the legal status of the nullified <i>teruma</i> is that of non-sacred produce.

### Part 4
The Gemara comments: <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a barrel of <i>teruma</i></b> wine <b>that broke in the upper winepress, and in the lower</b> press there is <b>one hundred</b> times that amount of <b>ritually impure, non-sacred</b> wine, <b>Rabbi Eliezer concedes to Rabbi Yehoshua that if one is able to rescue</b> even <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>from</b> the barrel that broke and keep the wine <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual purity, he</b> should <b>rescue</b> it. <b>And</b> if <b>not,</b> one should let the <i>teruma</i> wine <b>descend and become impure</b> on its own, <b>but he</b> should <b>not</b> actively <b>render it impure with</b> his <b>hand.</b>

### Part 5
After citing proof for the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, from this source, the Gemara questions the formulation of the <i>baraita</i> itself. <b>This</b> expression: <b>Rabbi Eliezer concedes to Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> is puzzling, as Rabbi Eliezer ruled that one may never directly render the barrel impure. The <i>baraita</i> <b>should</b> say the opposite: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua concedes to Rabbi Eliezer,</b> as it is Rabbi Yehoshua who concedes that one may not render impure the barrel of <i>teruma</i> in the upper vat. <b>Rava said: Reverse</b> the names, so that it is Rabbi Yehoshua who concedes to Rabbi Eliezer.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: Actually, do not reverse</b> the names. Rather, <b>with what are we dealing here?</b> We are referring to a case where it is possible to collect the wine only <b>in a vessel whose interior is ritually pure and whose exterior is impure</b> by rabbinic law, having become impure through contact with impure liquids. <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>we</b> should <b>issue a decree</b> that one may not rescue even a quarter-<i>log</i>, <b>lest the</b> vessel’s <b>exterior touch the <i>teruma</i></b> and render it impure, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that Rabbi Eliezer concedes to Rabbi Yehoshua that despite that concern, it is permitted to rescue a quarter-<i>log</i> of pure <i>teruma</i>.
