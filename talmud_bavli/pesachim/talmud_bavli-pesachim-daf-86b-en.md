### Part 1
I <b>might</b> have thought that a single Paschal lamb <b>may be eaten in two</b> separate <b>groups; therefore, the verse states: “In one house shall it be eaten.”</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds that the consonantal text of the Torah is authoritative;</b> meaning, the primary understanding of the verse is according to the way it is spelled. If this is the case, the verse may be rendered: In one house shall he eat it [<i>yokhal</i>], referring to the person eating the Paschal lamb. This would indicate that one eating from the Paschal lamb must eat in one location, but the verse does not prohibit dividing the offering between multiple groups. <b>And Rabbi Shimon holds that the vocalized text of the Torah is authoritative.</b> Since the word is pronounced <i>ye’akhel</i>, it is clear that it is referring to the Paschal lamb itself, and the verse requires that the offering be consumed by a single group of people (Rabbeinu Ḥananel).

### Part 3
The Gemara attempts to clarify this <i>halakha</i>: If members of a group <b>were sitting</b> and eating the Paschal lamb, <b>and a partition was spread between them</b> such that they now constitute two separate groups, <b>according to</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>who says a Paschal lamb may be eaten in two groups, they may</b> continue to <b>eat; according to</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>who says a Paschal lamb may not be eaten in two groups, they may not</b> continue to <b>eat</b> because they now constitute two groups.

### Part 4
On the other hand, if <b>they were sitting</b> in two separate groups separated by a partition, <b>and the partition between them was removed, according to</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>who says that one who eats</b> the Paschal lamb <b>may eat</b> it <b>in two places, they may eat; according to</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>who says that one who eats</b> the Paschal lamb <b>may not eat</b> it <b>in two places, they may not eat.</b> The removal of the partition defines a new place and it is as though they are eating in a new location.

### Part 5
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Kahana sat and</b> taught this lesson <b>simply,</b> as though it were absolutely clear that erecting a partition divides a group into two distinct groups and removing a partition causes the area to be regarded as a new location. <b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: You should raise this dilemma as a question: Does removal of a partition or the construction of a partition</b> in one location during the eating of the Paschal lamb render the place <b>comparable to two locations and</b> cause the people to be considered <b>two groups, or not?</b> In fact, there is no clear answer to this dilemma, and the Gemara concludes: <b>Let</b> the question <b>stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 6
It was taught in the mishna that <b>a bride turns her face.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> she turns her face? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is because she is embarrassed</b> by other members of the group looking at her.

### Part 7
In this regard, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, happened to come to the house of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak. They said to him: What is your name? He said to them: Rav Huna,</b> even though using his title appeared to show conceit. <b>They said: Our master may sit on the bed</b> due to his great stature. <b>He sat</b> immediately, despite the fact that common etiquette dictated that he initially refuse. <b>They gave him a cup</b> of wine that <b>he accepted the first time,</b> without initially refusing it. <b>And he drank it in two</b> sips <b>and did not turn his face</b> from the rest of the people who were present.

### Part 8
These actions all appeared to be departures from the common etiquette and surprised his hosts, who <b>said to him: What is the reason you call yourself Rav Huna? He said to them: I am</b> known by <b>that name</b> since my youth, and therefore referring to myself with that title does not indicate conceit. They asked him: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>when they told you to sit on the bed, you sat</b> immediately and did not initially refuse? <b>He said to them:</b> We have learned that <b>anything the master of the house says to you,</b> you should <b>do, except for</b> an inappropriate request, such as if he says to <b>leave.</b>

### Part 9
They continued to question his conduct: <b>What is the reason that when they gave you the cup, you accepted it the first time</b> and did not politely demur? <b>He said to them: One may refuse a lesser person, but one may not refuse a great person;</b> when an important person makes a request, it is respectful to comply immediately. They persisted in their questioning: <b>What is the reason you drank it in two</b> sips? <b>He said to them: As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who drinks his cup at one time is a guzzler;</b> drinking it in <b>two</b> sips is <b>proper manners;</b> one who drinks his cup in <b>three</b> sips <b>is haughty,</b> as he thereby demonstrates that he is pampered and indulgent. They continued to question his conduct: <b>What is the reason you did not turn your face</b> in accordance with the common etiquette? <b>He said to them: We learned in the mishna that a bride turns her face;</b> however, there is no reason for anyone else to turn his face.

### Part 10
The Gemara relates another incident that is somewhat similar to the one just quoted: <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, happened to come to the house of Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Yosei ben Lakonya. They gave him a cup</b> of wine to drink. <b>He accepted it the first time</b> it was offered <b>and drank it at one time. They said to him: Does our master not hold</b> of the <i>halakha</i> that <b>one who drinks his cup at one time is a guzzler? He said to them: They did not say</b> this rule <b>with regard to your small cup, and your sweet wine, and my wide stomach.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rav Huna said: Members of a group enter with three,</b> meaning that when there are three members present the waiter must start serving them, <b>and they may leave even with one,</b> meaning that they may leave one at a time, and the waiter must continue serving those who remain until they are finished. <b>Rabba said: And that is</b> true only <b>when</b> the last member of the group <b>entered at a time when it is common to enter</b> the meal and not unusually early or late, <b>and it is</b> true only <b>when the waiter [<i>dayyala</i>] knew about them,</b> i.e., he knew that the members of this group leave one by one as they finish their meals and do not eat the entire meal together.

### Part 12
<b>Ravina said: And</b> the people who stayed late and extended their meal <b>must give</b> the waiter extra <b>money</b> for the <b>wages</b> he earned during the extra time that he served them, <b>and the last</b> one <b>must add money</b> for the time the waiter stayed to serve him individually. The Gemara notes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with the opinion</b> of Ravina. Rather, the waiter must serve until the last member of the group has completed his meal without additional compensation.
