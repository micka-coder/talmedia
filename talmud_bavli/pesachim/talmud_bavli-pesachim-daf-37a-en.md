### Part 1
<b>And Beit Hillel permit</b> one to bake bread in this manner. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> thickness is required for the <i>matza</i> to be considered <b>thick bread? Rav Huna said:</b> This category includes <i>matza</i> that is <b>a handbreadth</b> thick. The proof is <b>as we found by the shewbread,</b> which could not be leavened and which was <b>a handbreadth</b> thick.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yosef strongly objects to this</b> explanation: <b>If</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that it is permitted to bake bread a handbreadth thick for the shewbread, which was prepared <b>by diligent</b> priests who ensured that the dough did not become leavened, will <b>they say</b> the same <b>with regard to</b> other people <b>who are not</b> as <b>diligent?</b> Furthermore, <b>if they said</b> this <b>with regard to well-kneaded bread,</b> will <b>they say</b> the same <b>with regard to bread that is not well kneaded?</b>

### Part 3
Rav Yosef continues: <b>If they said</b> that bread a handbreadth thick is permitted in a case where the bread was cooked <b>with dry wood,</b> which was brought to the Temple during the dry summer months, as the heat generated from this type of wood would cause the bread to cook quickly before it leavened, will <b>they say</b> the same with regard to ordinary people who cook <b>with moist wood? If they said</b> this <b>with regard to a hot oven</b> in the Temple, will <b>they</b> also <b>say</b> it is permitted <b>with regard to a cool oven?</b> Finally, <b>if they said</b> so <b>with regard to</b> the shewbread, which was baked <b>in a metal oven</b> that could be heated quickly, will <b>they say</b> the same <b>with regard to a clay oven?</b> Clearly, these two cases are different, and no comparison can be drawn between the shewbread and ordinary <i>matza</i>.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba said: I asked my special Rabbi, and who is this? Rav. Some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said: I asked my special Rabbi, and who is this? Our holy Rabbi,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the expression: <b><i>Pat ava</i>?</b> He explained that it means: <b>A large</b> quantity <b>of bread,</b> a large batch of dough prepared in one session. <b>And why did they call it: <i>Pat ava</i>,</b> thick bread? It is referred to by this name <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> it requires <b>a large</b> amount <b>of kneading. And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>in the place where this <i>tanna</i> lived, a large quantity of bread was</b> simply <b>called <i>pat ava</i>,</b> thick bread.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this prohibition against preparing a large batch? <b>If</b> the reason <b>is due to the unnecessary exertion</b> that is required to knead a large amount of dough, which is an improper activity on a Festival, <b>why</b> discuss <b>particularly</b> the application of this <i>halakha</i> <b>to Passover?</b> The same <i>halakha</i> <b>should</b> apply <b>also to other Festivals.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so;</b> it is prohibited to prepare a large quantity of dough during any Festival. <b>And</b> while <b>this <i>tanna</i> was referring to the festival of Passover,</b> he incidentally mentioned a <i>halakha</i> that actually applies to other Festivals as well. The Gemara comments: <b>That</b> opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, which states that <b>Beit Shammai say: One</b> may <b>not bake <i>pat ava</i> on a Festival, and Beit Hillel permit</b> baking bread in this manner on a Festival.

### Part 7
<b>The Sages taught: One fulfills</b> the obligation to eat <i>matza</i> <b>on Passover with fine bread, with coarse bread, and</b> after the fact <b>with</b> <i>matza</i> <b>shaped in figures, although they said</b> that <b>one should not bake</b> <i>matza</i> <b>shaped in figures on Passover</b> <i>ab initio</i>. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Baitos ben Zonin asked the Sages</b> about <b>this matter: Why did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>not prepare</b> <i>matza</i> <b>shaped in figures on Passover</b> <i>ab initio</i>? <b>They said to him:</b> The reason is <b>because a woman will tarry over it</b> as she prepares the bread, so that she can form the figure before it is baked, <b>and she will</b> thereby <b>cause it to become leavened.</b>

### Part 8
<b>He said to them: It is possible</b> for a woman <b>to prepare</b> this <i>matza</i> <b>with a mold, and</b> she could <b>set it immediately,</b> without delaying the baking process. <b>They said to him:</b> People would fail to understand the distinction, and <b>they would say</b> that <b>all shaped</b> <i>matza</i> <b>is prohibited, and</b> yet <b>Baitos’ shaped</b> <i>matza</i> <b>is permitted.</b> Consequently, the Sages rejected this distinction, and prohibited all forms of <i>matza</i> shaped in figures on Passover.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok said: Once I followed my father,</b> Rabbi Tzadok, <b>into Rabban Gamliel’s home, and they brought before him</b> <i>matza</i> <b>shaped in figures on Passover. I said: Father, didn’t the Sages say</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>not prepare</b> <i>matza</i> <b>shaped in figures on Passover? He said to me: My son, they did not say this</b> prohibition <b>for</b> the <i>matza</i> of <b>all</b> ordinary <b>people; rather, they said so</b> in regard to the <i>matza</i> <b>of bakers,</b> who are under pressure to enhance the appearance of their products in order to increase sales. The dough could leaven, since bakers might take too much time to ensure that the shape of their <i>matza</i> is exactly right.

### Part 10
<b>Some say</b> that <b>this is</b> what Rabbi Tzadok <b>said to</b> his son: The Sages <b>did not say</b> that this practice is prohibited with regard to the <i>matza</i> <b>of bakers,</b> who are expert and efficient in their work and will do it quickly, but <b>rather</b> this prohibition applies to the <i>matza</i> <b>of all</b> ordinary <b>people.</b> According to both versions of this exchange, it is permitted to eat this <i>matza</i> after the fact. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: One</b> may <b>prepare</b> <i>matzot</i> <b>shaped as thin</b> wafers, <b>but one</b> may <b>not prepare</b> <i>matzot</i> <b>shaped as thick loaves,</b> as the latter is more likely to be leavened.

### Part 11
<b>The Sages taught: Sponge-like cakes, honey cakes, spiced cakes [<i>eskeritin</i>], pan-fried bread [<i>ḥallat hamasret</i>], and</b> bread prepared from <b>a mixture</b> of permitted grain and <i>teruma</i>, their owners <b>are</b> all <b>exempt from <i>ḥalla</i>.</b> The Gemara clarifies these obscure terms. <b>What is pan-fried bread? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: This is boiled bread</b> baked <b>by</b> ordinary <b>homeowners</b> in a deep frying pan.

### Part 12
<b>Reish Lakish said: These</b> dishes <b>are pot-boiled stew [<i>ilpas</i>],</b> not bread. Since this food is prepared in a pot and not in an oven, it has been boiled rather than baked, and its owner is therefore exempt from <i>ḥalla</i>. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Even the owner of bread prepared like <b>a pot-boiled stew is obligated</b> in <i>ḥalla</i>, but the owners of <b>these</b> pan-fried breads and the other baked goods listed are exempt, <b>as</b> these breads <b>were baked in the sun.</b> Since they were not baked over a fire, they are not classified as bread with regard to the mitzva of <i>ḥalla</i>.

### Part 13
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish statement from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>sponge-cakes, honey cakes, or spiced cakes,</b> if one <b>prepared them in a pot,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to separate <i>ḥalla</i>. However, if he prepared them <b>in the sun,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from this mitzva. This is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish. Ulla said: Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> could have <b>said to you: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where one heated</b> the pot over the fire <b>and afterward pasted</b> the dough to the sides of the hot pot. This is considered like baking in an oven, and one is therefore obligated to separate <i>ḥalla</i> from the dough.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>However,</b> if one <b>pasted</b> the dough to the sides of the pot <b>and afterward heated</b> it, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>So too,</b> you will say <b>that</b> is he is <b>exempt</b> from the mitzva of <i>ḥalla</i>? If so, <b>rather than teach</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i> that the owner of the bread is <b>exempt if it was baked in the sun, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>distinguish and teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>within</b> the presentation of this case <b>itself: In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that one who prepares this bread in a pot is obligated to separate <i>ḥalla</i>, <b>said? For example, when one heated the pot and afterward pasted</b> the bread to its sides; <b>but if he placed the bread</b> in the pot <b>and</b> then <b>boiled</b> it, he is <b>exempt.</b> Why didn’t the <i>baraita</i> formulate the <i>halakha</i> in this manner?

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: The text of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and is teaching the following: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> In a case <b>where one heated</b> the pot <b>and afterward pasted</b> the bread to its sides. <b>However,</b> if <b>one placed</b> the bread inside the pot <b>and afterward boiled</b> it, <b>it is</b> considered <b>as though it had been cooked in the sun, and</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from separating <i>ḥalla</i>.

### Part 16
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a difficulty from a <i>baraita</i>: One can <b>fulfill</b> the obligation to eat <i>matza</i> <b>with half-baked <i>matza</i> and pot-boiled <i>matza</i>.</b> Apparently, dough baked in a pot is classified as bread. The Gemara answers: <b>Here too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where one heated</b> the pot like an oven, <b>and afterward he pasted</b> the dough to the sides of the pot.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>What is half-baked <i>matza</i>? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> This refers to <b>any</b> <i>matza</i> <b>that</b> is sufficiently baked so that <b>when</b> it is <b>broken no strands</b> of dough <b>emerge from its sides. Rava said: And likewise the loaves of the thanks-offering</b> may be used if they have been baked to this extent. The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious</b> that this is the case, as <b>here,</b> with regard to <i>matza</i>, <b>“bread” is written, and there,</b> with regard to the loaves of the thanks-offering, <b>“bread” is</b> also <b>written</b> (Leviticus 7:13). Since both loaves are called bread, it is obvious that the same criteria should apply to both cases.

### Part 18
The Gemara rejects this assertion: This statement is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> the following: <b>Since it is written</b> with regard to a thanks-offering: <b>“And he shall present from it</b>
