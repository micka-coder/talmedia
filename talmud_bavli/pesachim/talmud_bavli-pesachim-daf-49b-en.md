<b>and unacceptable.</b>

### Part 2
<b>The Sages taught: A person should always</b> be willing to <b>sell all he has</b> in order to <b>marry the daughter of a Torah scholar.</b> If <b>he cannot find the daughter of a Torah scholar, he should marry the daughter of</b> one of the <b>great</b> people <b>of the generation,</b> who are pious although they are not Torah scholars. If <b>he cannot find the daughter of</b> one of the <b>great</b> people <b>of the generation, he should marry the daughter of</b> one of <b>the heads of the congregations.</b> If <b>he cannot find the daughter of</b> one of <b>the heads of the congregations, he should marry the daughter of</b> one of <b>the charity collectors.</b> If <b>he cannot find the daughter of</b> one of <b>the charity collectors, he should marry the daughter of</b> one of <b>the schoolteachers.</b> However, <b>he should not marry the daughter of an ignoramus [<i>am ha’aretz</i>] because they are vermin and their wives are</b> similar to <b>a creeping animal,</b> as their lifestyle involves the violation of numerous prohibitions. <b>And with regard to their daughters</b> the verse <b>states: “Cursed is he who lies with an animal”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:21), as they are similar to animals in that they lack any knowledge or moral sense.

### Part 3
The Gemara continues its discussion with regard to an ignoramus. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: It is prohibited for an ignoramus to eat meat, as it is stated: “This is the law [<i>torah</i>] of the beast and of the fowl”</b> (Leviticus 11:46). He expounds: <b>Anyone who engages in Torah</b> study <b>is permitted to eat the meat of animals and fowl, and anyone who does not engage in Torah</b> study <b>is prohibited to eat the meat of animals or fowl.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara proceeds to mention some sharply negative statements of the Sages in which they overstated their negative sentiments with regard to ignoramuses, although these ignoramuses were wicked in addition to being boors (<i>ge’onim</i>). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: It is permitted to stab an ignoramus</b> to death <b>on Yom Kippur that occurs on Shabbat. His students said to him: Master,</b> at least <b>say</b> that it is permitted <b>to slaughter him. He said to them:</b> I intentionally used the word stab, as <b>this</b> term, slaughtering, <b>requires a blessing</b> when one slaughters an animal, <b>and that</b> term, stabbing, <b>does not require a blessing</b> in any context.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: It is prohibited to accompany an ignoramus</b> while traveling <b>on the road</b> due to concern that the ignoramus might try to harm his traveling partner, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Torah: <b>“For it is your life and the length of your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20). An ignoramus has not studied any Torah, indicating that <b>he is not concerned about his own life;</b> with regard <b>to another’s life, all the more so.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is permitted to tear</b> open <b>an ignoramus like a fish. Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: And</b> one may cut him open <b>from his back</b> and thereby cause his immediate death by piercing his spinal cord rather than his stomach.

### Part 7
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva said: When I was an ignoramus I said: Who will give me a Torah scholar</b> so that <b>I will bite him like a donkey? His students said to him: Master, say</b> that you would bite him <b>like a dog! He said to them:</b> I specifically used that wording, as <b>this one,</b> a donkey, <b>bites and breaks bones, and that one,</b> a dog, <b>bites but does not break bones.</b>

### Part 8
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: Anyone who marries off his daughter to an ignoramus</b> is considered <b>as though he binds her and places her before a lion.</b> Why is this so? <b>Just as a lion mauls</b> its prey <b>and eats and has no shame, so too, an ignoramus strikes</b> his wife <b>and</b> then <b>engages in sexual relations</b> with her without appeasing her first, <b>and has no shame.</b>

### Part 9
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If we did not need</b> the ignoramuses <b>for business, they would kill us.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara shifts to a discussion of an ignoramus who has some degree of sensitivity (<i>Me’iri</i>). <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: Anyone who engages in Torah</b> study <b>in the presence of an ignoramus,</b> causing the ignoramus embarrassment and anguish over his inability to study Torah, <b>is considered as though he had sexual relations with</b> the ignoramus’s <b>betrothed</b> bride <b>in his presence, as it is stated: “Moses commanded us the Torah, an inheritance</b> [<b><i>morasha</i></b>] for the congregation of Jacob” (Deuteronomy 33:4). <b>Do not read it</b> as <b>inheritance [<i>morasha</i>]; rather,</b> read it as <b>betrothed [<i>me’orasa</i>].</b> The Torah is compared to the betrothed bride of the Jewish people until one studies it and thereby consummates his marriage with it.

### Part 11
Similarly, he said: <b>The hatred which ignoramuses have for a Torah scholar is greater than the hatred that the nations of the world have for the Jewish people. And</b> the <b>wives</b> of the ignoramuses hate Torah scholars <b>more than</b> the ignoramuses themselves. <b>It was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> that one <b>who studied</b> Torah <b>and left</b> his studies hates Torah scholars <b>more than all of them.</b>

### Part 12
<b>The Sages taught: Six statements were made with regard to ignoramuses: One may not entrust them with testimony,</b> i.e., one may not appoint them as witnesses to a particular event or transaction. Additionally, <b>one may not accept testimony from them,</b> as they are not considered trustworthy, and <b>one should not reveal a secret to them,</b> as they will reveal it. <b>One may not appoint them as steward [<i>apotropos</i>] over</b> an estate belonging to <b>orphans,</b> due to concern that they might make improper use of the orphans’ property. Likewise, <b>one may not appoint them as guardian over a charity fund.</b> Finally, <b>one should not accompany them</b> while traveling <b>on the road,</b> due to concern for one’s safety. <b>And there are those who say: One does not even announce their lost</b> items, meaning that if one finds a lost article from such a person, he is allowed to keep it without making an effort to locate the owner (<i>Me’iri</i>).

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: What is the reasoning of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who holds that one must announce having found the lost article of an ignoramus? The Gemara explains: <b>Sometimes upstanding offspring will come from him and will consume</b> the property, <b>as it is stated: “He may prepare it but the just shall put it on”</b> (Job 27:17). It is possible for a wicked person to prepare something for himself that will later be used by a righteous person.

### Part 14
The Gemara returns to explaining the mishna. It was taught: <b>And so too, one who left</b> Jerusalem with sacrificial meat in his possession must return to Jerusalem to burn it, just as one is required to return in order to remove leaven from his possession. According to Rabbi Meir, this <i>halakha</i> applies with regard to an egg-bulk of sacrificial meat or leaven, whereas Rabbi Yehuda disagrees and says the minimum amount for both is an olive-bulk.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>an egg-bulk is</b> the minimal amount that is considered <b>significant, and Rabbi Yehuda holds that an olive-bulk is also</b> considered <b>significant?</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna in <i>Berakhot</i>: <b>How much</b> food must one eat in order <b>to obligate</b> those with whom he ate <b>in a <i>zimmun</i>? An olive-bulk</b> of food is sufficient according to the unattributed opinion in the mishna, which is generally that of Rabbi Meir. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda says: An egg-bulk</b> is the minimum measure to obligate those with whom one ate in a <i>zimmun</i>. This seems to contradict the opinions of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda stated in the mishna here.

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The opinions are reversed</b> in one of these sources, and must be emended.

### Part 17
<b>Abaye said: Actually, do not reverse</b> the opinions. <b>There, they disagree with regard to</b> the interpretation of <b>verses,</b> while <b>here, they disagree with regard to logical reasoning.</b> How so? <b>There,</b> with regard to <i>zimmun</i>, <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the interpretation of <b>verses. Rabbi Meir holds</b> that the verse: “And you shall eat and be satisfied and bless the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 8:10) should be understood as follows: <b>“And you shall eat,” that is eating; “and be satisfied,” that is drinking.</b> The standard halakhic principle is that <b>eating</b> is defined as the consumption of <b>an olive-bulk. And Rabbi Yehuda holds: “And you shall eat and you shall be satisfied”</b> refers <b>to eating that includes satisfaction. And what is</b> considered eating with satisfaction? It is consumption of <b>an egg-bulk.</b>

### Part 18
However, <b>here,</b> in the cases of leaven and consecrated food, <b>they disagree</b> not with regard to the interpretation of verses but <b>with regard to logical reasoning, as Rabbi Meir holds:</b> The requirement to <b>return</b> consecrated food <b>is analogous to its ritual impurity. Just as its</b> susceptibility to <b>ritual impurity is</b> only when it is the size of an <b>egg-bulk, so too,</b> the requirement to <b>return it is</b> only when it is the size of an <b>egg-bulk. And Rabbi Yehuda holds:</b> The requirement to <b>return</b> consecrated food
