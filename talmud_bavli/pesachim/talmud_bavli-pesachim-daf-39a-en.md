### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And these are the vegetables with which a person</b> can <b>fulfill his obligation</b> to eat bitter herbs <b>on Passover:</b> One can fulfill his obligation <b>with <i>ḥazeret</i>, with chervil [<i>tamkha</i>], and with field eryngo [<i>ḥarḥavina</i>], and with endives [<i>olashin</i>], and with <i>maror</i>. One fulfills</b> his <b>obligation with them whether</b> they are <b>fresh</b> or <b>whether</b> they are <b>dry. However,</b> one does <b>not</b> fulfill his obligation if they are <b>pickled</b> in water or vinegar, <b>nor</b> if they are <b>over-boiled [<i>shaluk</i>]</b> in hot water, <b>nor</b> if <b>they are boiled [<i>mevushal</i>].</b>

### Part 2
The mishna adds: <b>And</b> all these different types of vegetables <b>join together to</b> the measure of <b>an olive-bulk,</b> i.e., it is not necessary to eat this amount from one specific type of vegetable. <b>And one fulfills</b> his obligation by eating <b>their stalk,</b> as it is not necessary to eat the leaves. <b>And</b> one fulfills the obligation <b>with doubtfully tithed</b> produce, <b>with first-tithe</b> produce <b>whose <i>teruma</i> has been taken</b> and given to a priest, <b>and</b> with both <b>second-tithe</b> produce <b>and consecrated property that were redeemed.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara identifies the plants mentioned by the mishna by their Aramaic names. <b><i>Ḥazeret</i></b> is <b>lettuce. <i>Olashin</i></b> is called <b><i>hindevi</i>.</b> With regard to <b><i>tamkha</i>, Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: It is called <i>temakhta</i></b> in Aramaic. As for <b><i>ḥarḥavina</i>, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> This is the plant <b>that</b> grows <b>around the palm tree.</b> The mishna taught: <b>And with <i>maror</i>.</b> The Gemara explains: This is a plant called <b><i>merirata</i>.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Bar Kappara teaches: These are the vegetables with which a person</b> can <b>fulfill his obligation</b> to eat bitter herbs <b>on Passover: With endives, chervil, <i>ḥarḥallin</i>, field eryngo, and <i>ḥazeret</i>. Rav Yehuda says: Also wild endives, garden endives, and <i>ḥazeret</i>.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: Why does Rav Yehuda mention <b>garden endives and <i>ḥazeret</i>? These were</b> already <b>taught in the first clause.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>this is</b> what Rav Yehuda <b>is saying: Even wild endives are</b> equivalent to <b>garden endives and <i>ḥazeret</i></b> and may be used as bitter herbs on Passover. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The plants <b><i>asvas</i>, and <i>tura</i>, and sweet myrrh [<i>mar yero’ar</i>]</b> can <b>also</b> be used to fulfill this obligation. <b>Rabbi Yosei said to him: <i>Asvas</i> and <i>tura</i></b> are two names for <b>one</b> plant, <b>and <i>mar</i> is</b> the same plant as <b><i>yero’ar</i>.</b>

### Part 6
A Sage of <b>the school of Rabbi Samuel teaches: These are the vegetables with which a person</b> can <b>fulfill his obligation</b> to eat bitter herbs <b>on Passover: With <i>ḥazeret</i>, endives, chervil, field eryngo, <i>ḥarginnin</i>, and <i>hardofannin</i>. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One can <b>also</b> fulfill his obligation with <b><i>ḥazeret yolin</i> and <i>ḥazeret gallin</i>,</b> as they are <b>similar to</b> the aforementioned vegetables.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Ile’a said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b> One can <b>also</b> fulfill his obligation with <b><i>arkablim</i>. And I went around all of</b> Rabbi Eliezer’s <b>students looking for a colleague</b> who agreed with me that Rabbi Eliezer said this, <b>but I did not find</b> anyone who remembered this ruling. <b>But when I came before Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, he conceded to my statement.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Any</b> plant <b>that has</b> white <b>sap</b> when it is cut may be used as bitter herbs. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says: Anything whose surface is light</b> green may be used as bitter herbs. <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say: Any bitter herb</b> that <b>has sap and whose surface is light</b> green is fit for this mitzva. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From the statements of all these</b> Sages, <b>we can learn</b> that <b>a bitter green herb has sap and its surface is light</b> green. <b>Rav Huna said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Ravina found Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, searching for <i>merirata</i></b> to use as bitter herbs. <b>He said to him: What is your opinion,</b> that you seek this particular herb? If you are looking for <b>that</b> which <b>is most bitter, but we learned <i>ḥazeret</i></b> first in the mishna, which indicates that this is the preferred choice. <b>And</b> likewise, a Sage of <b>the school of Shmuel taught <i>ḥazeret</i></b> first, before the other types of bitter herbs. <b>And Rabbi Oshaya said:</b> The optimal fulfillment of the <b>mitzva</b> is with <b><i>ḥazeret</i>, and Rava said: What is <i>ḥazeret</i>?</b> It is <b>lettuce [<i>ḥassa</i>].</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>lettuce [<i>ḥassa</i>]?</b> It refers to the fact <b>that God has mercy [<i>ḥas</i>] on us. And Rabbi Samuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Why are the Egyptians likened to bitter herbs</b> in the verse: “And they embittered their lives” (Exodus 1:14)? This comparison serves <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as these bitter herbs are soft at first and harsh in the end, so too, the Egyptians were soft at first,</b> when they paid the Jews for their work, <b>but were harsh in the end,</b> as they enslaved them. This idea applies solely to <b><i>ḥazeret</i>,</b> which has a bitter aftertaste, but not to other types of bitter herbs, which are bitter from the beginning. Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, <b>said to</b> Ravina: <b>I retract</b> my position and concede that it is preferable to use <i>ḥazeret</i> for bitter herbs.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Reḥumi said to Abaye: From where</b> is it known <b>that this bitter herb</b> that must be eaten on Passover night <b>is a type of vegetable?</b> Perhaps one could <b>say</b> that the mitzva should be performed with <b>the bile of a <i>kufya</i></b> fish, which is very bitter, but not necessarily with a type of plant? He answered: Bitter herbs are <b>similar to <i>matza</i>; just as <i>matza</i></b> must be prepared only from food <b>that grows from the ground, so too, bitter herbs</b> must be from food <b>that grows from the ground.</b> The Gemara asks: How do we know that a bitter herb is specifically a vegetable rather than the bitter <b>oleander</b> bush? The Gemara answers: Bitter herbs are <b>similar to <i>matza</i>; just as <i>matza</i></b> is prepared from <b>a type of plant,</b> but not including a tree, <b>so too, bitter herbs</b> must be from <b>a type of plant</b> that is not a tree.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks a similar question: Perhaps I can <b>say</b> that one may use <b><i>harzipu</i>,</b> a vegetable that poisons animals, as the bitter herb. The Gemara answers: It must be <b>similar to <i>matza</i>; just as <i>matza</i></b> is prepared from plants <b>that</b> are fit for human consumption and <b>can be purchased with</b> second-<b>tithe money, so too, bitter herbs</b> must be from a species <b>that can be purchased with</b> second-<b>tithe money.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rabba bar Rav Ḥanin said to Abaye:</b> I can <b>say that</b> the <b>bitter herb</b> mentioned in the Torah includes merely <b>one</b> species, i.e., only the bitterest plant can be used for this obligation. Abaye responded: For this reason <b>it is written: “Bitter herbs”</b> (Exodus 12:8) in the plural, indicating that many types of bitter herbs are fit for this purpose. Rabba retorted: <b>But</b> one can <b>say that “bitter herbs”</b> refers to <b>two</b> different species, but no more. Abaye explained: Bitter herbs are <b>similar to <i>matza</i>; just as <i>matza</i></b> can be prepared from <b>many types</b> of grain, <b>so too, bitter herbs</b> can be taken from <b>many</b> different <b>types</b> of vegetables.

### Part 14
<b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With regard to the <b>vegetables that the Sages said a person can fulfill with them his obligation</b> to eat bitter herbs <b>on Passover, they</b> may <b>all be planted in one</b> garden <b>bed.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>That is to say that</b> the prohibition against planting <b>diverse kinds</b> of seeds <b>does not apply to them?</b> Rav’s statement indicates that all these species are so similar that they may be planted together without violating the prohibition against planting different species of crops in one area of a field.

### Part 15
<b>Rava raised an objection</b> from a mishna: <b><i>Ḥazeret</i> and <i>ḥazeret gallin</i>; endive and wild endive; leek and wild leek; coriander and wild coriander; mustard and Egyptian mustard; and Egyptian gourd and <i>harmutza</i>,</b> a type of gourd, <b>are not</b> considered a mixture of <b>diverse kinds</b> when planted <b>together.</b> This indicates that <b><i>ḥazeret</i> and <i>ḥazeret gallin</i>, yes,</b> they may be planted together; however, <b><i>ḥazeret</i> and endives, no,</b> they may not be planted together.

### Part 16
<b>And lest you say that all</b> these species <b>are taught together,</b> and the mishna is actually saying that any of these species may be planted together, <b>but didn’t Rav</b> himself <b>say</b> that these plants <b>were taught in pairs,</b> i.e., one may plant each plant only with its pair that is listed in the mishna, due to their similarity; however, one may not, e.g., plant lettuce and endive together. It therefore remains unclear what Rav meant when he said that vegetables fit for use as bitter herbs may be planted in a single garden bed.

### Part 17
The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term <b>planted, which Rav said?</b> It means that these plants may <b>be properly planted.</b> In other words, they may be planted together provided that there is an appropriate amount of space between them, so that there is no violation of the prohibition against planting diverse kinds of seeds. The Gemara asks: If he wishes to inform us about planting them <b>properly, we</b> already <b>learned</b> this in a mishna:
