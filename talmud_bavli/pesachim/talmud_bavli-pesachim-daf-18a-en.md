### Part 1
The purification waters <b>are nullified in its innards</b> and do not impurify the meat of the cow. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that it was <b>from</b> his ruling with regard to liquids transmitting impurity to <b>vessels</b> by Torah law <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>retracted</b> his opinion, <b>but with regard to foods he holds in accordance with</b> the opinions of <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon</b> that liquids transmit ritual impurity to food by Torah law, <b>why</b> does he say that the purification waters <b>are nullified in its innards entirely</b> and no longer transfer impurity at all?

### Part 2
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Although</b> these waters <b>do not transmit a severe</b> form of <b>ritual impurity</b> to a person or vessel that comes into contact with them, <b>in any event let them transmit a lesser</b> form of <b>impurity</b> to food that comes into contact with them. Rabbi Yehuda’s ruling with regard to the purification waters indicates that he retracted his previous opinion entirely and he maintains that there is no impurity of liquids by Torah law at all. Since this impurity is by rabbinic law, the Sages did not extend their decree to the uncommon circumstance of the purification waters.

### Part 3
The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>What, too, is</b> the meaning of Rabbi Yehuda’s phrase: <b>They are nullified in its innards? It</b> means that <b>they are nullified</b> only <b>from a severe</b> form of <b>impurity. However,</b> according to Rabbi Yehuda, the purification waters <b>transmit a lesser form of impurity.</b> This proves <b>by inference that the first <i>tanna</i> maintains</b> that the purification waters <b>also transmit a severe</b> form of <b>impurity</b> to people and vessels. This is a problematic conclusion, as the first <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: Its flesh is impure,</b> which clearly indicates that its flesh alone is impure, whereas the purification waters swallowed by the cow do not transmit impurity to people or vessels. The result is that according to this approach, there is no difference between the opinions of Rabbi Yehuda and the first <i>tanna</i>.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: The <b>entire</b> mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> the mishna <b>is incomplete and is teaching the following:</b> With regard to <b>a cow that drank the purification waters, its flesh is impure. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said with regard to <b>a lesser</b> form of <b>impurity, but</b> with regard to <b>a severe</b> form of <b>purity, no,</b> its flesh is not impure, <b>as Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The waters <b>are nullified in its innards</b> and their status is no longer that of purification waters. Instead, their impurity is by rabbinic law, like any other liquid.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Ashi said: Actually,</b> it is possible to explain that the waters <b>are nullified in its innards entirely</b> from any type of impurity, as this issue is unrelated to the question of whether the impurity of liquids is by Torah law or rabbinic law. Rather, this <i>halakha</i> is <b>due to</b> the fact that purification waters <b>become a foul liquid</b> when ingested, and the principle is that offensive liquid can neither be rendered impure itself nor transfer impurity to other items.

### Part 6
It was taught in the <i>baraita</i> about uncertainty as to the impurity of liquids that <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> With regard <b>to foods</b> that came into contact with impure liquid, the foods <b>are impure.</b> However, with regard <b>to vessels</b> that came into contact with impure liquid, the vessels <b>are pure. Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Reish Lakish said: Rabbi Yosei said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, his teacher, who interpreted</b> the term <b><i>yitma</i>,</b> which is an intransitive verb in the simple conjugation meaning: <b>It shall be impure,</b> as though it were written <b><i>yetamme</i>,</b> a transitive verb in the intensive conjugation meaning: <b>It shall render impure,</b> i.e., it transmits impurity to other items.

### Part 7
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>On that day,</b> when they appointed Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya the <i>Nasi</i>, <b>Rabbi Akiva taught: “And every earthenware vessel</b> into which <b>any of them</b> falls, whatever is in it shall be impure [<i>yitma</i>], and you shall break it” (Leviticus 11:33). The verse <b>does not say: It is impure [<i>tameh</i>]; rather,</b> it says: <b>It shall be impure [<i>yitma</i>],</b> indicating that an item in an impure earthenware vessel <b>transmits impurity to other</b> items. <b>This</b> verse <b>teaches about a loaf</b> with <b>second-</b>degree ritual impurity status, i.e., ritual impurity imparted through contact with a vessel impurified by a creeping animal, <b>that</b> the loaf <b>renders</b> other items impure with <b>third-</b>degree ritual impurity, even <b>non-sacred</b> items.

### Part 8
The Gemara inquires: <b>And here,</b> with regard to the ritual impurity of liquids, <b>how does</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>interpret</b> the verses? The Gemara cites the verse: “From all food which may be eaten, upon which water has come, shall be impure; <b>and all drink that may be drunk in every vessel, shall be impure [<i>yitma</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 11:34). Rabbi Yosei interprets the end of the verse as: <b>Shall render impure [<i>yetamme</i>],</b> indicating that liquid also <b>transmits impurity to foods.</b> The Gemara discusses this derivation: Do <b>you say</b> that this expression teaches that liquid <b>transmits ritual impurity to foods, or perhaps</b> the verse <b>is</b> teaching <b>only</b> that <b>it transmits impurity to</b> other <b>liquids,</b> but not to food? <b>You said</b> in response: <b>That was not</b> the correct interpretation.

### Part 9
The Gemara wonders about the unusual expression. <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>That was not</b> the correct interpretation? How can this difficulty be dismissed so easily? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It means that <b>we did not find</b> any case of <b>ritual impurity that renders a similar</b> item impure. Therefore, it must be that the verse teaches that this liquid transmits impurity to food.

### Part 10
<b>Ravina said: From</b> an analysis of <b>the verse itself you also cannot say</b> that the term: <b>Shall be impure,</b> means that the liquid <b>transmits ritual impurity</b> only to <b>liquids. As, if it enters your mind</b> to say that the term: <b>Shall be impure, in the latter</b> portion of the verse means that <b>it transmits ritual impurity</b> only to <b>liquids,</b> then the term: <b>Shall be impure, in the first</b> portion of the verse, in reference to food, should <b>also</b> mean that <b>it transmits ritual impurity</b> only to <b>liquids.</b> And if that is so, <b>let</b> the verse <b>combine</b> the two cases <b>and write them</b> together as follows: <b>From all food which may be eaten, upon which water has come, and all drink that may be drunk in every vessel, shall be impure.</b>

### Part 11
Ravina concludes his proof: <b>Why do I</b> need the term: <b>Shall be impure, twice? Rather,</b> it must be that the term: <b>Shall be impure, in the first</b> portion of the verse teaches that food <b>transmits ritual impurity</b> to <b>liquids,</b> while the term: <b>Shall be impure, in the latter</b> portion of the verse teaches that liquid <b>transmits ritual impurity</b> to <b>food.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that the term teaches that liquid <b>transmits ritual impurity to vessels.</b> The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>And isn’t it an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? <b>Just as</b> an impure <b>vessel, which transmits impurity to liquid</b> that comes into contact with it, nevertheless <b>does not transmit impurity to</b> another <b>vessel,</b> so too, <b>liquids that come to</b> a state of impurity <b>due to</b> contact with <b>a vessel, is it not right that they</b> should <b>not transmit impurity to vessels?</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara suggests: <b>And say that when</b> liquids <b>do not transmit ritual impurity</b> to a vessel, that is in the case of <b>liquids that come to</b> a state of impurity <b>due to</b> contact with an impure <b>vessel,</b> as the vessel itself does not transmit impurity to another vessel. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>liquids that come to</b> a state of impurity <b>due to</b> contact with <b>a creeping animal,</b> a more severe form of impurity, <b>indeed, they</b> should <b>transmit impurity</b> even to vessels. The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>Are liquids that come to</b> a state of impurity <b>due to</b> contact with <b>a creeping animal stated</b> explicitly in the Torah? The impure liquids mentioned in the verse became impure by contact with a vessel that came into contact with a dead creeping animal.
