### Part 1
<b>“And you shall guard the <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:17). This verse teaches that one may use only <b><i>matza</i> that has been guarded</b> from becoming leavened <b>for the purpose</b> of <b>matza,</b> i.e., with the intention of fulfilling one’s obligation of <i>matza</i> with it. This explanation <b>excludes this</b> <i>matza</i>, which was prepared for a nazirite or a thanks-offering and <b>which was not guarded for the purpose</b> of <b><i>matza</i> but for the purpose of a sacrifice.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> a different reason: One may not use <i>matza</i> prepared for a nazirite or a thanks-offering because <b>the verse states: “Seven days you shall eat <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Exodus 12:15), which indicates that one can fulfill his obligation only with <b><i>matza</i> that</b> can <b>be eaten for</b> all <b>seven days.</b> This requirement <b>excludes this</b> <i>matza</i>, which is of nazirite’s wafers or the loaves of a thanks-offering and <b>which cannot be eaten for seven days, but</b> only <b>for</b> one <b>day and</b> one <b>night.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba, and it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba:</b> I <b>might</b> have thought <b>that one can fulfill his obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>with the loaves of a thanks-offering or a nazirite’s wafers;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall guard the <i>matzot</i>,”</b> indicating that one must use <b><i>matza</i> that has been guarded</b> from becoming leavened <b>for the purpose of <i>matza</i></b> on Passover. This requirement <b>excludes this</b> <i>matza</i>, <b>which was not guarded for the purpose</b> of <b><i>matza</i> but for the purpose of a sacrifice.</b>

### Part 4
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef:</b> I <b>might</b> have thought <b>that a person can fulfill his obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>with the loaves of a thanks-offering or a nazirite’s wafers;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “Seven days you shall eat <i>matzot</i>,”</b> from which it is inferred that one must fulfill this obligation with <b><i>matza</i> that</b> can <b>be eaten for</b> all <b>seven</b> days. This requirement <b>excludes this</b> <i>matza</i>, <b>as it cannot be eaten for seven days but</b> only <b>for a day and a night.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks a question of both opinions: And <b>let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that one cannot fulfill his obligation to eat <i>matza</i> with the loaves of a thanks-offering or a nazirite’s wafers, from the phrase <b>“bread of affliction [<i>leḥem oni</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3). According to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, this phrase means: One can fulfill his obligation to eat <i>matza</i> only <b>with</b> food that may <b>be eaten in</b> a state of <b>acute mourning.</b> This requirement <b>excludes this</b> <i>matza</i>, i.e., the loaves of the thanks-offering and the nazirite wafers, <b>which is not eaten in</b> a state of <b>acute mourning but in</b> a state <b>of joy,</b> as an acute mourner is prohibited from eating sacrificial foods.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: Rabba and Rav Yosef both <b>maintain in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who said</b> that since <b><i>oni</i>,</b> meaning poverty, <b>is written,</b> the <i>matza</i> must be bread of poverty. According to Rabbi Akiva, this phrase does not teach the <i>halakha</i> pertaining to consumption by acute mourners.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks another question: <b>And let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that one cannot fulfill his obligation to eat <i>matza</i> with the loaves of a thanks-offering or a nazirite’s wafers, from the fact <b>that it is <i>matza ashira</i>,</b> enhanced <i>matza</i>, as both the loaves of the thanks-offering and the nazirite’s wafers contain oil. <i>Matza</i> that contains ingredients besides flour and water is classified as <i>matza ashira</i> and cannot be used for the mitzva of eating <i>matza</i> on the first night of Passover.

### Part 8
<b>Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said:</b> This is an incorrect definition, as the total amount of oil in these loaves or wafers <b>is</b> only <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i>, <b>and</b> as this small amount of oil <b>is divided between several loaves,</b> it is nullified in the mixture. Consequently, the loaves of the thanks-offering and the nazirite’s wafers are not <i>matza ashira</i>.

### Part 9
The Gemara again asks: <b>And let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that one cannot fulfill his obligation to eat <i>matza</i> with the loaves of a thanks-offering or a nazirite’s wafers from that fact <b>that</b> these types of bread <b>cannot be eaten in every habitation.</b> It was previously stated that the obligation to eat <i>matza</i> can be fulfilled only with food that can be eaten anywhere in Israel, whereas offerings may be eaten only in Jerusalem.

### Part 10
<b>Reish Lakish said: That is to say, the loaves of the thanks-offering and the nazirite’s wafers</b> may <b>be eaten in Nov and Givon.</b> In other words, the omission of this reason indicates that offerings could have been sacrificed on the communal altars during the period when improvised altars were permitted, before the Temple was built. These offerings are not among those that can be sacrificed only: “In the place that the Lord shall choose” (Deuteronomy 12:5). This means that during that period the loaves of the thanks-offering and the nazirite’s wafers could indeed have been eaten anywhere, as improvised altars were built in any place. Consequently, even after the Temple was built, the loaves of the thanks-offering and the nazirite’s wafers are still considered fit to be eaten anywhere in Israel.

### Part 11
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Ilai said: I asked Rabbi Eliezer</b> ben Hyrcanus: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the possibility <b>that a person</b> can <b>fulfill</b> the obligation to eat <i>matza</i> <b>with the loaves of a thanks-offering or a nazirite’s wafers? He said to me: I did not hear</b> anything about this issue. <b>I went and asked Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who <b>said to me: They said,</b> concerning <b>loaves for a thanks-offering or a nazirite’s wafers that</b> one <b>prepared for his own</b> offering, that <b>a person cannot fulfill his obligation with them.</b> However, if one baked them <b>to sell in the market, he</b> can <b>fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with them.</b>

### Part 12
<b>When I returned and recited</b> these <b>matters to Rabbi Eliezer, he said to me</b> in excitement: By the <b>covenant, these are the</b> very <b>matters that were stated to Moses on Mount Sinai.</b> Rabbi Eliezer swore that this <i>halakha</i> had been transmitted over the generations going back to Moses on Mount Sinai. <b>Some say</b> he spoke in astonishment: By the <b>covenant!</b> Are <b>these</b> in fact <b>the matters that were stated to Moses on Mount Sinai? And doesn’t</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>require a reason?</b> Since there is no explicit tradition in this regard, it is necessary to provide a reason for this distinction.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> indeed, <b>what is the reason</b> for this distinction between these loaves one prepared for himself and those he intended to sell in the market? <b>Rabba said:</b> With regard to <b>anything</b> sold <b>in the market,</b> the merchant may <b>change his mind</b> about it. <b>He</b> might <b>say: If it is sold, it is sold;</b> but <b>if it is not sold</b> for an offering, <b>I will fulfill</b> my obligation to eat <i>matza</i> <b>with it.</b> Since the merchant had in mind from the outset that these <i>matzot</i> might be used for the mitzva on Passover, he is permitted to use them to fulfill his obligation.
