### Part 1
<b>What, is it not</b> the case <b>that the</b> mishna and the <i>baraita</i> <b>disagree</b> concerning <b>the following</b> matter: <b>According to the one who says</b> that one must recite <b>until “A joyful mother of children,”</b> he <b>maintains</b> that the subsequent <b><i>halleluya</i></b> is <b>the start of a chapter. And the one who said</b> that one must recite <b>until “When Israel came forth” maintains</b> that <b><i>halleluya</i></b> is <b>the end of the</b> previous <b>chapter.</b> The mishna and the <i>baraita</i> disagree only with regard to when the word <i>halleluya</i> should be recited, at this point in the seder or when <i>hallel</i> is resumed after the meal.

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this contention: This is no proof, as <b>Rav Ḥisda explains</b> the difference between the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with his reasoning, that everyone maintains</b> that <b><i>halleluya</i></b> marks <b>the end of a chapter.</b> However, <b>the one who said</b> that one must recite <b>until “When Israel came forth”</b> spoke <b>well,</b> as he cites the beginning of the next verse. <b>And the one who said</b> that one must recite <b>until “A joyful mother of children”</b> means <b>until and including,</b> i.e., one finishes the entire verse including the word <i>halleluya</i>.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>say: Until <i>halleluya</i>. And if you say that we</b> would <b>not know which <i>halleluya</i></b> he meant, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>say:</b> The <b><i>halleluya</i> of “A joyful mother of children.”</b> The Gemara comments: This is indeed <b>difficult</b> for the opinion of Rav Ḥisda.

### Part 4
Likewise, <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna explains</b> the difference between the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with his reasoning, that everyone agrees</b> that <b><i>halleluya</i></b> signifies <b>the start of a chapter. The one who said</b> that one must recite <b>until “A joyful mother of children”</b> spoke <b>well, and the one who said</b> that one must recite <b>until “When Israel came forth” maintains</b> that the term means <b>until and not including,</b> as one does not conclude with the word <i>halleluya</i> after “A joyful mother of children.”

### Part 5
The Gemara asks a similar question with regard to the opinion of Rabba bar Rav Huna: If so, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>say: Until <i>halleluya</i>. And if you say that we</b> would <b>not know which <i>halleluya</i></b> he meant, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>say:</b> The <b><i>halleluya</i> of “When Israel came forth.”</b> The Gemara comments: This is indeed <b>difficult</b> for Rabba bar Rav Huna’s opinion.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> the mishna stated that <b>one concludes</b> this section of <i>hallel</i> <b>with</b> a blessing that refers <b>to redemption.</b> With regard to the dispute over how to conclude the blessing, <b>Rava said:</b> For <b>the recitation of <i>Shema</i> and <i>hallel</i></b> on Passover, the wording of the final blessing is: <b>Who redeemed Israel,</b> in the past tense, whereas the seventh blessing of the weekday <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer</b> concludes with: <b>Who redeems Israel,</b> in the present tense. <b>What is the reason</b> for this difference? Prayer <b>is a</b> supplication for mercy and therefore one mentions and requests the anticipated redemption in his prayers.

### Part 7
Likewise, <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The formula <b>of <i>kiddush</i></b> is: <b>Who sanctified us with His mitzvot and commanded us,</b> in the past tense. In contrast, the formula in the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer</b> is: <b>Sanctify us with Your mitzvot,</b> in the future tense. <b>What is the reason</b> for this difference? Prayer <b>is a</b> supplication for mercy, and one submits a request for the future.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: And one must mention the exodus from Egypt in the daytime <i>kiddush</i></b> of Shabbat, despite the fact that Shabbat is not directly connected to the Exodus. The proof is that <b>here,</b> with regard to Passover, <b>it is written: “That you may remember the day</b> when you came out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life” (Deuteronomy 16:3); <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to Shabbat: <b>“Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it”</b> (Exodus 20:8). By means of a verbal analogy of the word “day,” these verses teach that one must also recall the Exodus on Shabbat.

### Part 9
The Gemara discusses the formulas of other prayers. <b>Rabba bar Sheila said:</b> The <b>prayer</b> that describes the future restoration of the kingship of Israel concludes with: <b>He Who causes the horn of salvation to flourish,</b> while the blessing recited <b>after the <i>haftara</i>,</b> the portion read from the Prophets, concludes with: <b>Shield of David.</b>

### Part 10
Incidentally, the Gemara cites the promise God issued to David through Nathan the Prophet: <b>“And I will make you a great name, like the names of the great ones</b> in the earth” (II Samuel 7:9). <b>Rav Yosef teaches: This is</b> the meaning of the phrase “like the names of the great ones,” that Jews will <b>say: Shield of David,</b> just as they say: Shield of Avraham.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said</b> with regard to God’s blessing of Avraham: “And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing,” (Genesis 12:2). <b>“And I will make of you a great nation”; this is</b> fulfilled in the opening of the first blessing of the <i>Amida</i>, <b>as</b> Jews <b>say: God of Abraham. “And I will bless you”; this is</b> fulfilled when <b>they say: God of Isaac,</b> as it is a blessing for a father when the name of his son is eternalized. <b>“And I will make your name great”; this is</b> fulfilled <b>when they say: God of Jacob.</b>

### Part 12
One <b>might</b> have thought that Jews should <b>conclude</b> the first blessing of the <i>Amida</i> prayer <b>with</b> the names of <b>all</b> the forefathers; therefore <b>the verse states: “And you will be a blessing,”</b> i.e., <b>with you,</b> Avraham, <b>they</b> will <b>conclude</b> the blessing, <b>and they</b> will <b>not conclude with</b> a mention of <b>all</b> of the forefathers. This is why the first blessing of the <i>Amida</i> prayer ends: Shield of Avraham.

### Part 13
<b>Rava said: I found the Elders of Pumbedita sitting and saying: On Shabbat, both in prayer and in <i>kiddush</i>,</b> one recites: <b>Who sanctifies Shabbat. On a Festival, both in prayer and in <i>kiddush</i></b> one recites: <b>Who sanctifies Israel and the seasons. And I said to them: On the contrary,</b> in <b>prayer, both on Shabbat and on a Festival,</b> one should recite: <b>Who sanctifies Israel.</b> However, <b>in the <i>kiddush</i> of Shabbat</b> one should recite: <b>Who sanctifies Shabbat,</b> whereas in the <i>kiddush</i> <b>of a Festival</b> one should recite: <b>Who sanctifies Israel and the seasons.</b>

### Part 14
Rava further said to the Elders of Pumbedita: <b>And I</b> can <b>say my reason and your reason. Your reason</b> is that since <b>Shabbat is established and permanent,</b> i.e., it always occurs on the seventh day of the week, <b>both in prayers and in <i>kiddush</i></b> one should recite: <b>Who sanctifies Shabbat.</b> It is not necessary for Israel to sanctify Shabbat, as it is permanently sanctified by God. Conversely, with regard to a <b>Festival, as it is Israel who establishes it, as</b> the Sages <b>add</b> extra days to certain <b>months and establish years</b> by intercalating them, one recites: <b>Who sanctifies Israel and the seasons.</b> This is Rava’s explanation of the reason for the ruling of the Elders of Pumbedita.

### Part 15
Rava continues: <b>My reason is</b> that in the case of <b>prayer, which is in public,</b> one recites: <b>Who sanctifies Israel,</b> in honor of the community. Conversely, for <b><i>kiddush</i>, which is</b> recited by an individual <b>alone on Shabbat,</b> one says: <b>Who sanctifies Shabbat,</b> as Israel does not sanctify Shabbat. <b>On a Festival</b> one recites: <b>Who sanctifies Israel and the seasons.</b> In this case, Israel is mentioned, as its Sages sanctify the Festivals.

### Part 16
The Gemara rejects Rava’s reason: <b>And that is not so. Is there not</b> also the <b>prayer</b> recited <b>by</b> a person who is <b>alone; and is there not</b> also kiddush <b>in public?</b> The above distinction is rendered meaningless in practice. <b>But Rava maintains: Follow the main</b> practice of each mitzva. Prayer is primarily a communal activity, whereas <i>kiddush</i> is fundamentally the obligation of each individual.

### Part 17
The Gemara reports: <b>Ulla bar Rav descended</b> to lead the prayer service <b>before Rava. He said</b> the formula <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Elders of Pumbedita, and</b> Rava <b>did not say anything to him. Apparently, Rava retracted</b> his opinion and accepted the formula of the Elders of Pumbedita. Likewise, the Gemara relates: <b>Rav Natan, father of Rav Huna, son</b> of <b>Rav Natan, descended</b> to lead the prayer service <b>before Rav Pappa</b> and <b>recited</b> the liturgy <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Elders of Pumbedita,</b> and <b>Rav Pappa praised him</b> for his correct recitation.

### Part 18
<b>Ravina said: I happened</b> to come <b>to Sura before Mareimar, and the prayer leader descended before him and recited</b> the liturgy <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Elders of Pumbedita, and everyone</b> tried to <b>silence him,</b> as they had never heard that version of the prayer before. Mareimar <b>said to them: Leave him,</b> as <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Elders of Pumbedita. And</b> the people in attendance listened to him and <b>no</b> longer tried to <b>silence</b> the prayer leader, but allowed him to complete the prayer.

### Part 19
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>They poured for</b> the leader of the seder <b>the third cup</b> of wine, <b>and he recites the blessing over his food,</b> Grace After Meals. Next, they pour him the <b>fourth</b> cup. <b>He completes <i>hallel</i> over it,</b> as he already recited the first part of <i>hallel</i> before the meal. <b>And he</b> also <b>recites the blessing of the song</b> at the end of <i>hallel</i> <b>over</b> the fourth cup. During the period <b>between these cups,</b> i.e., the first three cups established by the Sages, <b>if one wishes to drink</b> more <b>he</b> may <b>drink;</b> however, <b>between the third</b> cup <b>and the fourth</b> cup one should <b>not drink.</b>

### Part 20
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Ran Ḥanan said to Rava:</b> Since the mishna states that Grace After Meals must be recited over the third cup, <b>learn from it</b> that Grace After Meals <b>requires a cup</b> of wine. Rava <b>said to him:</b> This is no proof, for although <b>the Sages instituted</b> the drinking of <b>four cups in the manner of freedom,</b> once the four cups are in place, with <b>each and every one</b> of them <b>we will perform a mitzva,</b> despite the fact that they were not originally instituted for this purpose. After the Sages instituted these four cups, they attached a special mitzva to each one. However, this does not prove that there is an obligation to recite Grace After Meals over a cup of wine during the rest of the year.

### Part 21
We learned in the mishna that they pour the leader of the seder the <b>fourth</b> cup and <b>he completes <i>hallel</i> over it, and he recites the blessing of the song</b> at the end of <i>hallel</i> <b>over</b> that cup.
