### Part 1
its owners will have no choice but to <b>consult</b> a Sage <b>about it</b> to determine whether or not it is ritually pure, as <b>even with regard to a vessel that is placed upon the ground,</b> which is certainly not capable of providing an answer if asked, its legal status is <b>like</b> that of <b>an item that has knowledge to be asked.</b> The fact that the knife is an inanimate object is not reason enough to rule it ritually pure. It was therefore necessary to say that the knife is ritually pure because the Temple courtyard is a public domain. If it was a private domain, the knife would be deemed impure.

### Part 2
It was taught that if an impure needle were found in an animal, <b>the meat is ritually impure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With what</b> liquid <b>was this meat rendered susceptible</b> to impurity? A food can become impure only if it were rendered susceptible to impurity through contact with a liquid; how, then, could the sacrificial meat become impure immediately after the animal was slaughtered?

### Part 3
<b>If we say that it was rendered susceptible</b> to impurity <b>by</b> the <b>blood</b> that flowed when it was slaughtered, <b>didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to blood of consecrated</b> offerings <b>that it does not render</b> produce <b>susceptible</b> to impurity? <b>As it is stated: “You shall surely not eat the blood; you shall pour it upon the earth like water”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:16). The Sages derived from this verse: <b>Blood that is poured like water,</b> i.e., blood from a non-sacred domesticated animal that is poured out when it is slaughtered and not received in a vessel like sacrificial blood, assumes the legal status of water and <b>renders</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. <b>Blood that is not poured out like water,</b> but is received in a vessel to be sprinkled on the altar, <b>does not render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to impurity.

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> say <b>that</b> this meat <b>was rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>by the</b> other <b>liquids of the slaughterhouse,</b> e.g., the water that was kept near the altar for washing the offerings. <b>But didn’t Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, say</b> with regard to <b>the liquids of the slaughterhouse: Not only are they ritually pure,</b> as noted in the testimony of Yosei ben Yo’ezer, <b>but they do not</b> even <b>render</b> meat <b>susceptible</b> to impurity?

### Part 5
<b>Rather,</b> say that the meat <b>is rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>by the esteem for sacred</b> objects. According to this principle, certain items that cannot become impure by Torah law become susceptible to impurity by rabbinic law due to their extreme sanctity. The Gemara rejects that possibility: <b>Say that the esteem for sacred</b> objects <b>is effective to disqualify</b> the meat <b>itself</b> despite the fact that it was not rendered susceptible to receive impurity, but <b>does it also</b> transmit impurity to the extent that one <b>counts first- and second-</b>degree impurity from contact with that meat? Can impurity based on the esteem for sacred objects be transmitted to other objects like standard impurity?

### Part 6
If so, <b>resolve</b> from here <b>that which Reish Lakish raised as a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a mass from meal-offerings,</b> does one <b>count first- and second-</b>degree impurity from contact with it <b>or not?</b> Due to the esteem for sacred objects, the offering itself can become impure without having been rendered susceptible through contact with liquid; however, the dilemma is whether or not it transmits impurity to other objects.

### Part 7
The Gemara responds: Perhaps the dilemma with regard to the status of ritual impurity due to esteem for sacred objects has not in fact been resolved. In the case of meat, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> It is referring to a case <b>where</b> the meat <b>was</b> from <b>a cow</b> brought as <b>a peace-offering sacrifice,</b> whose hide and meat belong to its owner, <b>and</b> the owner <b>led it through the river</b> to clean it, and he slaughtered it <b>while liquid was still moist upon it.</b> While the animal was being flayed, water fell on the meat, rendering it susceptible to impurity.

### Part 8
We learned in a mishna cited above: If the needle <b>was found in the secretions</b> of the animal’s stomach, <b>everything,</b> meat, knife, and hands, <b>is pure.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And let these secretions,</b> which are liquid, <b>return and transmit impurity to the meat</b> itself. Like any other liquid, the secretions assume first-degree ritual impurity by rabbinic decree. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> It is referring <b>to thick,</b> solid <b>secretions,</b> which are not liquid. <b>Rav Ashi said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that it is referring <b>to soft secretions,</b> it does not transfer impurity <b>because it is an offensive liquid,</b> which does not transmit impurity.

### Part 9
<b>The <i>tanna</i></b> who recited <i>mishnayot</i> and <i>baraitot</i> in the study hall <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Sheshet.</b> Based on the verses, it is possible to create the following scenario: The carcass of <b>a creeping animal transmits impurity to liquids,</b> the <b>liquids transmit impurity to a vessel,</b> the <b>vessel transmits impurity to foods, and</b> the <b>foods transmit impurity to liquids. And we have</b> thereby <b>learned</b> that there are <b>three</b> successive levels <b>of impurity with regard to a</b> dead <b>creeping animal.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>These are four</b> levels, not three. The Gemara answers: <b>Cut</b> the <b>liquids of the first clause,</b> so that the <i>baraita</i> reads: The carcass of a creeping animal transmits impurity to a vessel and the vessel to foods, etc.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary, cut</b> the <b>liquids of the latter clause,</b> which states that foods transmit impurity to liquids. The Gemara explains: <b>The only <i>tanna</i> that we find who said</b> that <b>liquids transmit impurity to a vessel is Rabbi Yehuda.</b> And even <b>he retracted</b> this statement. <b>And your mnemonic</b> to remember the order of the transfer of impurity in this <i>baraita</i> is <b>a brewing vat,</b> as the order is similar to the production of beer. First one brings the vessel, then one places barley, the food, in it, and then the water. That is the order of the transmission of impurity in the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 11
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there:</b> With regard to the carcass of <b>a creeping animal that was found in an oven, the bread inside it</b> is impure with <b>second-</b>degree ritual impurity. This is <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>the oven</b> is impure with <b>first-</b>degree impurity and transmits impurity to the bread.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said to Rava: And let us view that oven as one filled with impurity,</b> as an earthenware vessel is rendered impure by a creeping animal in the airspace of the oven even without making contact with it. <b>And</b> consequently <b>this bread</b> should <b>be</b> impure with the <b>first-</b>degree of impurity. The oven should be considered as if it were filled with carcasses of creeping animals and the bread should assume first-degree impurity status as though it became impure directly from a creeping animal.

### Part 13
<b>He said to him: This</b> suggestion <b>cannot enter your mind, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>all the vessels</b> found in an earthenware oven <b>become impure from the airspace of</b> an impure <b>earthenware vessel.</b>
