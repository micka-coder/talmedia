### Part 1
<b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>Rav, who said</b> that, according to the mishna, if one did sprinkle the blood it is accepted, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> that eating the Paschal lamb is not essential. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> With regard to <b>all offerings in the Torah, whether the meat became ritually impure and the fat remains</b> pure, <b>or the fat became ritually impure and the meat remains</b> pure, <b>one</b> may <b>sprinkle the blood.</b>

### Part 2
With regard to the offerings of <b>a nazirite and one who performs</b> the ritual of <b>a Paschal lamb,</b> if <b>the fat became impure and the meat remains</b> pure, <b>one</b> may <b>sprinkle the blood.</b> If <b>the meat became impure and the fat remains</b> pure, <b>one</b> may <b>not sprinkle the blood</b> because eating the offering is a part of the mitzva itself and the impure meat may not be eaten. However, <b>if he sprinkled</b> the blood, <b>it was accepted.</b>

### Part 3
If <b>the owners became ritually impure from a corpse</b> and therefore cannot eat the offering, <b>one</b> may <b>not sprinkle</b> the blood; <b>and if one sprinkled</b> it, <b>it was not accepted.</b> Although failure to eat the offering does not preclude it from being accepted, that rule applies only when the owner of the offering is personally fit to eat it.

### Part 4
It was taught in the mishna: <b>With regard to</b> other <b>offerings it is not so;</b> even if the meat has become ritually impure, if the fat remains pure, the blood is sprinkled on the altar. The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of <b>the mishna?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>It is Rabbi Yehoshua. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> With regard to <b>all the offerings in the Torah from which there remains an olive-bulk of meat</b> that is fit to be eaten <b>or an olive-bulk of fat</b> that is fit to be sacrificed on the altar, <b>one</b> may <b>sprinkle the blood.</b> If all that remains is <b>half an olive-bulk of meat and half an olive-bulk of fat, one</b> may <b>not sprinkle the blood.</b> The fat is burned on the altar and the meat is eaten by the priests. Since the meat and fat serve different functions, they do not combine to equal the minimum amount that must remain in order to sprinkle the blood.

### Part 6
<b>And with regard to a burnt-offering, even</b> if all that was left was <b>half an olive-bulk of meat and half an olive-bulk of fat, one</b> may <b>sprinkle the blood because it is all consumed</b> on the altar. Since both the meat and the fat are sacrificed on the altar, they can be combined. <b>And with regard to a meal-offering, although all of it remains</b> pure, <b>one</b> may <b>not sprinkle</b> the blood of the animal offering that is brought together with it.

### Part 7
The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>What is</b> the mention of <b>a meal-offering doing</b> here? The discussion is about sprinkling blood, which is not relevant in the case of a meal-offering. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The meal-offering under discussion is <b>the meal-offering</b> brought with the <b>libations</b> that accompany animal offerings. <b>It could enter your mind to say: Since it comes due to the offering, it is comparable to the offering itself.</b> One might think that even if the offering became impure but the meal-offering remained pure, one would be permitted to sprinkle the blood of the animal due to the remaining meal-offering. Consequently, <b>it teaches us</b> that this is not the case.

### Part 8
<b>From where do we</b> derive that if only the <b>fat</b> remains, one may sprinkle the blood of the offering? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael, and</b> there are those who <b>determined</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> was stated <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: As the verse states:</b> “And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Lord at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting; <b>and he shall make the fat smoke for a satisfying aroma to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 17:6). This verse indicates that one may sprinkle the blood if the <b>fat</b> remains pure <b>although there is no</b> pure <b>meat.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>We have found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one may sprinkle the blood if only <b>fat</b> remains; but if all that is left is <b>the diaphragm and</b> the <b>two kidneys,</b> which are also sacrificed on the altar, <b>from where do we</b> derive that one may sprinkle the blood?

### Part 10
The Gemara responds: <b>Where did we say that one</b> may <b>sprinkle</b> the blood in such a case? The Gemara answers: The fact that one may sprinkle the blood in that case is clear <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is taught</b> at the end of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And with regard to a meal-offering, although all of it remains</b> pure, <b>one</b> may <b>not sprinkle</b> the blood. It can be deduced from this statement that <b>it is a meal-offering</b> for which <b>one</b> may <b>not sprinkle</b> the blood, as the meal-offering is not part of the animal; <b>but</b> with regard to <b>the diaphragm and the two kidneys, it seems well</b> to sprinkle the blood if they remain. That being the case, <b>from where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan himself said,</b> this time without quoting <i>tanna</i>’<i>im</i>: <b>The verse</b> we quoted above <b>states: For a satisfying aroma,</b> which indicates that <b>anything you raise as a satisfying aroma,</b> i.e., anything burned on the altar, is enough to sprinkle the blood.

### Part 12
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary to write fat</b> in that verse <b>and</b> it is <b>necessary to write: For a satisfying aroma. As, if the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>fat, I would have said</b> that if <b>fat</b> remains, <b>yes,</b> the blood may be sprinkled, but if only <b>the diaphragm and two kidneys</b> remain, which are not as significant as the fat, <b>no,</b> the blood may not be sprinkled. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: For a satisfying aroma. And if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>For a satisfying aroma, I would have said</b> that it includes <b>anything that rises as a satisfying aroma, and even a meal-offering</b> is included. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes fat,</b> to teach that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to sacrificial parts of the animal and not to accompanying libations and meal-offerings.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If the entire <b>community or most of it became ritually impure, or the priests were</b> all <b>impure and the community was pure, they should perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>in ritual impurity.</b> If <b>a minority of the community became impure,</b> even if they are many people, <b>those who are pure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>and those who are impure perform</b> the ritual on <b>the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>.

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> If most or all of <b>the Jewish people were impure and the priests and sacred vessels</b> used in the Temple service were <b>pure; or,</b> conversely, if <b>the Jewish people were pure and the priests and sacred vessels</b> were <b>impure; and even</b> in a situation in which <b>the Jewish people and the priests were pure and the sacred vessels</b> were <b>impure, they</b> may <b>perform</b> any part of the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>in ritual impurity.</b> The reason for this is that <b>a communal offering,</b> which is sacrificed even in a state of ritual impurity, <b>is not divided.</b> Therefore, since some of the service must be performed in a state of ritual impurity, it may all be performed in a state of ritual impurity.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: They taught</b> that the service may be done in a state of ritual impurity if the sacred vessels are impure <b>only</b> in a case where <b>the knife</b> to be used for slaughtering <b>became impure through</b> contact with <b>one who was ritually impure</b> due to contact with <b>a corpse, as the Merciful One states:</b> “And whoever shall touch on the open field <b>one slain with a sword,</b> or one that died, or the bone of a man, or a grave, shall be impure for seven days” (Numbers 19:16). The Sages expounded: <b>A sword is like a corpse.</b> Therefore, a sword or another metal implement that touches a corpse attains the same level of impurity as the corpse itself, which is the ultimate primary source of ritual impurity. Similarly, a knife that touches a person who is a primary source of ritual impurity due to contact with a corpse attains that same status.

### Part 16
Therefore, <b>it renders impure the person</b> who uses it for slaughtering. In this case, <b>when</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>is initially performed, it is performed in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity of the body.</b> Generally, one who is impure in this way is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> if he eats sacrificial meat or enters the Temple.

### Part 17
<b>However,</b> if <b>the knife became ritually impure with the impurity of a creeping animal, which renders the meat impure but does not render the person impure,</b> because something rendered impure by a primary source of ritual impurity becomes a secondary source of ritual impurity, which can render food impure but not people, <b>those who are pure</b> may <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb, but <b>those who are impure may not perform</b> the ritual. This is because <b>it is preferable that one eat</b> the Paschal lamb <b>with impurity of the meat,</b> as the nature of its prohibition is that of a regular <b>negative commandment, and one should not eat the meat with impurity of the body, which</b> renders one liable to receive <b><i>karet</i>.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara comments on Rav Ḥisda’s attempt to distinguish between different types of impurity and to claim that the entire community sacrifices the Paschal lamb in a state of ritual impurity only when the people have become impure with a severe form of impurity. <b>Apparently, Rav Ḥisda holds</b> that <b>impurity is overridden in</b> cases involving <b>the public.</b> The prohibition of sacrificing offerings in a state of impurity is not wholly permitted for a community; rather, it is overridden in cases of great need. Therefore, whenever it is possible to minimize the severity of the impurity, in is necessary to do so. <b>And, so too, Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> explicitly: <b>Impurity is overridden in</b> cases involving <b>the public.</b>

### Part 19
<b>And Rava said</b> that whenever there is any form of ritual impurity involved in the service, <b>even those who are ritually impure may also perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>As it is written: “And the flesh that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten, it shall be burned in fire; and the flesh, every one that is pure may eat the flesh”</b> (Leviticus 7:19).

### Part 20
Rava derives from this verse that <b>anywhere that we do not apply</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>“the flesh that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten”</b> and the meat may be eaten despite being impure, <b>we</b> also <b>do not apply “and the flesh, every one that is pure may eat the flesh.”</b> In that case, the meat may be eaten even by one who is impure. Just as the first half the verse is not applicable, the second half is also not applicable. It is only <b>anywhere that we apply</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>“the flesh that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten”</b> that <b>we</b> also <b>apply</b> the second half of the verse: <b>“And the flesh, every one that is pure may eat the flesh.”</b> Therefore, when the offering is sacrificed in a state of ritual impurity, there is no prohibition for impure people to eat it.

### Part 21
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to the mishna’s statement that the Paschal lamb may be sacrificed in a state of impurity if the majority of the public is impure. In a case where <b>the Jewish people were</b> divided, and exactly <b>half</b> were <b>pure and half</b> were <b>impure, Rav said half and half is like the majority, and Rav Kahana said half and half is not like the majority.</b>

### Part 22
The Gemara explains the dispute between Rav and Rav Kahana. <b>Rav said: Half and half is like the majority,</b> meaning that each of the two groups has the status of the majority of the public. Therefore, <b>those</b> who are pure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves</b> in a state of ritual purity. <b>And those</b> who are impure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves</b> in a state of ritual impurity. They are also considered like the majority of the public, and the sacrifice of the majority of the public is not deferred to the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>. <b>And Rav Kahana said: Half and half is not like the majority.</b> Therefore, those who are <b>pure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>and</b> those who are <b>impure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>.

### Part 23
<b>Some say</b> that what was stated above is not the correct conclusion based on Rav Kahana’s statement. Rather, <b>Rav Kahana said: Half and half is not like the majority.</b> Therefore, <b>those who are pure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on the <b>first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>,
