### Part 1
<b>is analogous to its prohibition. Just as its prohibition is</b> only when it is the size of an <b>olive-bulk, so too,</b> the requirement to <b>return it is</b> only when it is the size of an <b>olive-bulk.</b>

### Part 2
Another opinion on this issue <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> The minimum measure for both <b>this and that,</b> leaven and sacrificial meat, is <b>two egg-bulks</b> of prohibited material, <b>but the Rabbis did not agree with him.</b>

### Part 3
Incidental to the discussion of leaving Jerusalem and its surrounding area, the Gemara cites expositions of a prophetic passage, including a statement that God will eventually expand the boundaries of Jerusalem. The verse states: <b>“And it shall come to pass on that day that there shall not be light,</b> but <b>heavy clouds [<i>yekarot</i>] and thickness [<i>vekippaon</i>]”</b> (Zechariah 14:6). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the expression <b>“<i>yekarot vekippaon</i>”?</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: This is</b> the <b>light</b> currently provided by the sun, <b>which is significant</b> [<b><i>yakar</i>] in this world and insignificant</b> [<b><i>kafuy</i>] in the World-to-Come,</b> when the moon will shine as brightly as the sun does now and the sun will be seven times brighter than it is currently.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This</b> expression refers to the tractates of <b><i>Nega’im</i> and <i>Oholot</i>, which are weighty [<i>yekarim</i>]</b> owing to their difficulty <b>in this world,</b> as they are among the most complex subjects, <b>but</b> will be <b>easy [<i>kefuyin</i>] in the World-to-Come,</b> when people will be much wiser.

### Part 6
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: These are people who are</b> considered <b>important [<i>yekarim</i>] in this world and unimportant</b> [<b><i>kefuyim</i>] in the World-to-Come.</b> This is <b>like</b> the incident involving <b>Rav Yosef, son of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi,</b> who <b>became ill and</b> was about to <b>expire. When he returned</b> to good health, <b>his father said to him: What did you see</b> when you were about to die? <b>He said to him: I saw an inverted world. Those above,</b> i.e., those who are considered important in this world, were <b>below,</b> insignificant, while <b>those below,</b> i.e., those who are insignificant in this world, were <b>above. He said to him: My son, you have seen a clear world.</b> The world you have seen is the true world, as in that world people’s standings befit them. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi asked: <b>And where are we,</b> the Torah scholars, <b>there?</b> Rav Yosef responded: <b>Just as we are</b> regarded <b>here, so are we</b> regarded <b>there.</b>

### Part 7
Rav Yosef added: <b>And I heard that they were saying</b> in that world: <b>Praiseworthy is the one who arrives here with his studies in hand. And I</b> also <b>heard that they were saying: Those executed by the government</b> enjoy such an exalted status that <b>no one can stand in their enclosure.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And who are these</b> martyrs that Rav Yosef was referring to? <b>If you say</b> that he was referring to <b>Rabbi Akiva and his colleagues,</b> who were martyred, this cannot be: Is their elevated status <b>due</b> only <b>to</b> the fact that <b>they were martyred by</b> the Roman <b>government and nothing more?</b> These men were exceptional in their piety and sanctity during their lives as well. <b>Rather,</b> it is referring to <b>the martyrs of Lod,</b> Pappos and Luliyanos, who gave themselves up to be martyred for the sake of the Jewish people. They falsely admitted to killing the king’s daughter in order to prevent a harsh decree from being issued against the entire community. Although they were not known for exceptional piety before that event, they are considered to be extremely holy due to their martyrdom.

### Part 9
The Gemara continues to expound the section of the book of Zechariah cited above. The verse states: <b>“On that day there shall be upon the bells of the horses [<i>metzillot hasus</i>]: Holy unto the Lord”</b> (Zechariah 14:20). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the expression <b><i>metzillot hasus</i>?</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: In the future the Holy One, Blessed be He, will extend Jerusalem</b> by <b>as much as</b> the distance that <b>a horse can run</b> the entire time <b>it casts a shadow [<i>metzeil</i>].</b> Jerusalem will be so large that a horse running from one side of the city in the morning will not arrive at the other end of the city until midday, when its shadow will have disappeared.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: All</b> decorative <b>bells [<i>metzillot</i>] that one hangs between the eyes of a horse will be sanctified to God,</b> i.e., they will be consecrated for the Temple treasury.

### Part 12
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: All spoils that the Jewish people</b> will <b>take</b> from gentiles who wage war against them, <b>up to the time a horse runs and casts a shadow [<i>metzeil</i>],</b> i.e., half a day, <b>will be sanctified for God.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that this expression refers to <b>all spoils that the Jewish people</b> will <b>take, this is as it is written</b> in the continuation of the verse, which mentions additional treasure donated to the Temple: <b>“And the pots in the Lord’s house shall be like the basins before the altar.” However, according to the ones who said these</b> other <b>two</b> explanations, <b>what</b> is the meaning of: <b>“And the pots in the Lord’s house”?</b> The Gemara explains that according to these opinions the verse <b>is saying something else:</b> It is prophesying that in the future <b>the Jewish people will become wealthy and bring donations</b> to the Temple.

### Part 14
The Gemara goes on to ask: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that this expression refers to <b>spoils, this is as it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“And</b> on that day <b>there shall no longer be a merchant [<i>kena’ani</i>] in the house of the Lord of hosts”</b> (Zechariah 14:21), as he will no longer be needed. <b>However, according to the ones who said these</b> other <b>two</b> explanations, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the expression: <b>“There shall no longer be a merchant”? Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> The word <i>kena’ani</i> is in fact a contraction of the phrase: <b>There is no poor person here [<i>ein kan ani</i>].</b> In other words, there will no longer be poor people, and therefore the Jews themselves will be able to donate whatever is needed in the Temple (Maharsha).

### Part 15
<b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that a merchant can be called a <i>kena’ani</i>? As it is written: “And Judah saw there the daughter of a certain <i>kena’ani</i>…</b>and he took her, and went in unto her” (Genesis 38:2). <b>What is</b> the meaning of the word <b><i>kena’ani</i></b> in this context? <b>If you say</b> it refers to <b>an actual Canaanite, is it possible that Abraham warned Isaac</b> not to marry a Canaanite woman, and <b>Isaac warned Jacob</b> to the same effect, <b>and</b> nonetheless <b>Judah went and married</b> a Canaanite woman? <b>Rather, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> She was <b>the daughter of a merchant, as it is written: “As for the merchant [<i>kena’an</i>], the balances of deceit are in his hand. He loves</b> to oppress” (Hosea 12:8). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that this meaning of the word can be understood from the following verse, which describes Tyre: <b>“Whose traders are princes, whose merchants [<i>kinaneha</i>] are the honorable of the earth”</b> (Isaiah 23:8).

### Part 16
The Gemara cites another verse from the prophecy at the end of the book of Zechariah: <b>“And the Lord shall be King over all the earth, on that day shall the Lord be one and His name one”</b> (Zechariah 14:9). The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that now He is not one?</b>

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina said: The World-to-Come is not like this world.</b> In <b>this world, upon good tidings one recites: Blessed…Who is good and does good, and over bad tidings one recites: Blessed…the true Judge. In the World-to-Come</b> one will <b>always</b> recite: <b>Blessed…Who is good and does good.</b> There will be only one mode of blessing God for tidings.

### Part 18
The verse states: “On that day shall the Lord be one <b>and His name one.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the word <b>one</b> in this context? <b>Is that to say that now His name is not one?</b>

### Part 19
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The World-to-Come is not like this world. In this world,</b> God’s name that <b>is written with</b> the letters <b><i>yod</i></b> and <b><i>heh</i> is read</b> as <i>Adonai</i>, which begins with the letters <b><i>alef</i></b> and <b><i>dalet</i>.</b> God’s name is not pronounced in the same way as it is written. <b>However, in the World-to-Come it will all be one,</b> as God’s name will be both <b>read with</b> the letters <b><i>yod</i></b> and <b><i>heh</i> and written with</b> the letters <b><i>yod</i></b> and <b><i>heh</i>.</b>

### Part 20
<b>Rava thought to expound</b> upon the correct punctuation and enunciation of the name of God during his public <b>lecture</b> before one of the Festivals. <b>A certain old man said to him:</b> The word <b>forever is written</b> in the verse: “This is My name forever [<i>le’olam</i>]” (Exodus 3:15) without the letter <i>vav</i>, such that it can be read <i>le’alem</i>, to conceal, meaning that the name should be concealed.

### Part 21
<b>Rabbi Avina raised a contradiction: It is written</b> in the verse: <b>“This is My name forever,”</b> implying a requirement to conceal the name of God, and in the very next phrase it states: <b>“And this is My memorial unto all generations”</b> (Exodus 3:15), which indicates that the name of God is to be publicized and remembered by all. Rather, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: I,</b> i.e., My name, is <b>not read as I am written. I am written with</b> the letters <b><i>yod</i></b> and <b><i>heh</i>, and I am read with</b> the letters <b><i>alef</i></b> and <b><i>dalet</i>.</b>
