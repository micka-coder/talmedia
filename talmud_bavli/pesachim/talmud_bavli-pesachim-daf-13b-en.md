<b>their decrease</b> in value is <b>at the standard</b> rate of stored produce, due to rot and rodents. <b>However,</b> if <b>their decrease</b> in value is <b>beyond the standard</b> rate, everyone agrees that <b>one sells them in court; and all the more so</b> in the case <b>here,</b> with regard to leavened bread, <b>as</b> the bread will be <b>entirely lost.</b> Once the leaven is prohibited, it remains prohibited even after Passover. Consequently, everyone agrees that one is obligated to sell the leaven.

### Part 2
We learned in the mishna: <b>And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said: Two</b> disqualified <b>loaves</b> of a thanks-offering are placed on the pillars surrounding the Temple as an indicator. The <b><i>tanna</i></b> who recited <i>mishnayot</i> in the study hall <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Yehuda:</b> The loaves were placed <b>on [<i>al gav</i>] the bench</b> in the Temple. <b>He said to him: And does he need to conceal them?</b> No one would see them if they were placed there. Rather, <b>teach</b> the <i>baraita</i>: <b>On the roof of [<i>al gag</i>] the colonnade,</b> where everyone could see them.

### Part 3
<b>Raḥava said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: The Temple Mount was a double colonnade,</b> i.e., surrounded by two rows of columns. <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> it <b>was called an <i>istevanit</i></b> and it was <b>a colonnade within a colonnade.</b>

### Part 4
We learned in the mishna that Rabbi Yehuda says these two loaves placed outside were <b>disqualified.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> were <b>they disqualified?</b> What caused their disqualification? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Since</b> the thanks-offerings brought that day <b>are numerous,</b> and the priests are unable to eat their portions from the loaves of all the offerings, the remaining loaves <b>are disqualified by</b> virtue of their being <b>left overnight.</b> The Gemara explains that so many loaves were brought that day, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> may <b>not bring a thanks-offering on the festival of Passover due to the leavened bread</b> included <b>with it,</b> as ten of the forty loaves brought with a thanks-offering are loaves of leavened bread.

### Part 5
The Gemara raises a difficulty: It is <b>obvious</b> that one may not bring this offering on Passover, as it contains leaven. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said: Here</b> this <i>baraita</i> is not referring to the prohibition against bringing the offering on Passover itself. Rather, <b>we are dealing with</b> the issue of sacrificing a thanks-offering on <b>the fourteenth</b> of Nisan, <b>and</b> this <i>tanna</i> <b>maintains: One</b> may <b>not bring consecrated</b> offerings <b>to</b> a <b>situation</b> where the time that they may be eaten is restricted, thereby increasing <b>the</b> likelihood of <b>disqualification.</b> Although it is permitted to eat leavened bread until the sixth hour of the fourteenth of Nisan, one may not bring a thanks-offering on Passover eve. The reason is that a thanks-offering may be eaten for one full day and the following night, and if it is brought on the eve of Passover, the time available before disqualification is reduced.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> therefore, <b>everyone</b> who ascended on the pilgrimage to Jerusalem and were obligated to bring thanks-offerings <b>brought them on the thirteenth</b> of Nisan. <b>And since</b> these thanks-offerings <b>are numerous, they are disqualified by</b> virtue of their being <b>left overnight,</b> as priests are unable to eat their portions from the loaves of all the offerings brought that day.

### Part 7
<b>They said in the name of Rabbi Yannai:</b> The loaves placed as an indicator <b>were not disqualified</b> by being left overnight. <b>Rather, why did</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>call them disqualified?</b> It was due to the fact <b>that no</b> animal <b>offering was slaughtered together</b> with <b>them</b> to consecrate them, but they were consecrated as thanks-offering loaves independently. They could not be eaten until the offering with which they were brought was slaughtered. The Gemara asks: <b>And let us slaughter</b> the thanks-offering to render the loaves permitted. The Gemara answers: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where the</b> animal for the <b>offering was lost.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>And let us bring another</b> animal to replace the first one for <b>sacrifice and let them slaughter</b> it. The Gemara answers: This is a case <b>where</b> the one who consecrated the thanks-offering <b>said: This is a thanks-offering and these are its loaves.</b> He consecrated the animal and the loaves together, <b>and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba, as Rabba said:</b> If <b>the loaf</b> of a thanks-offering is <b>lost,</b> its owner <b>brings another loaf</b> to complete the offering. However, if <b>the thanks-offering was lost</b> and the loaves remain, one may <b>not bring another thanks-offering. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The loaves</b> are brought <b>due to the thanks-offering but the thanks-offering is not brought on account of the loaves.</b> The animal sacrificed is the primary component of the offering while the loaves are subordinate to it.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And let us redeem</b> the loaves from their consecrated status <b>and render them non-sacred,</b> and there will be no need to burn the loaves. <b>Rather,</b> the Gemara explains that <b>actually</b> the case is one <b>where the</b> animal <b>offering was</b> indeed <b>slaughtered over</b> the loaves to permit <b>them, but</b> the animal’s <b>blood spilled</b> before it could be sprinkled on the altar. Once the animal has been slaughtered, the loaves are fully consecrated and cannot be redeemed, but in this case, neither can they be eaten, as the blood was not sprinkled on the altar.

### Part 10
<b>And in accordance with whose</b> opinion is this statement that the slaughter of the animal consecrates the loaves and from that point they can no longer be redeemed? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: Each</b> of <b>two factors</b> that are indispensable in <b>permitting</b> the sacrifice of an offering, <b>elevates</b> the subordinate components of the offering to consecrated status, <b>without the other.</b> In this case, the loaves are consecrated when the animal to be sacrificed is slaughtered, even if the blood was not sprinkled, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The lambs sacrificed</b> on the festival of <b>Assembly,</b> i.e., <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>consecrate the loaves</b> that accompany them <b>only by</b> means of their <b>slaughter. How so?</b> If <b>one slaughtered</b> the lambs <b>for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> i.e., as lambs for <i>Shavuot</i>, in the appropriate manner, <b>and</b> the priest <b>sprinkled their blood for their</b> own <b>sake, the loaves are consecrated.</b>

### Part 11
However, if <b>one slaughtered them not for their</b> own <b>sake, and</b> the priest <b>sprinkled their blood not for their</b> own <b>sake, the loaves are not consecrated,</b> as the factors indispensable in rendering the offering permitted were not properly performed. If <b>one slaughtered them for their</b> own <b>sake, and he sprinkled their blood not for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> the fact that the lambs were properly slaughtered renders the loaves partially consecrated. Therefore, <b>the loaves are consecrated</b> to the extent that they cannot be redeemed, <b>but they are not consecrated</b> to the extent that they may be eaten. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: Actually, the loaves are consecrated only when one slaughters</b> the offerings <b>for their</b> own <b>sake and sprinkles their blood for their</b> own <b>sake,</b> i.e., only if both factors indispensable in rendering the offering permitted were properly performed. The previous answer in the Gemara is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.

### Part 13
The Gemara adds: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the previous answer is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> it is understood, as <b>with what</b> case <b>are we dealing here?</b> It is in a unique case <b>where</b> after the slaughter, <b>the blood was received in the cup and it</b> only then <b>spilled</b> before it was sprinkled.

### Part 14
<b>And Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>his father,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>who stated</b> a principle: The legal status of <b>any</b> blood <b>that is about to be sprinkled</b> and prepared for sprinkling <b>is like</b> that of blood that <b>had</b> already <b>been sprinkled.</b> Therefore, the loaves are consecrated when the blood is received in the vessel and thereby prepared to be sprinkled. They may not be eaten until the blood is actually sprinkled.

### Part 15
<b>It was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> that <b>they said in the name of Rabbi Elazar:</b> These loaves <b>were</b> entirely <b>fit. As long as</b> the loaves <b>were placed</b> there, <b>the entire nation</b> continued to <b>eat</b> leaven. When <b>one of</b> the loaves <b>was taken</b> away, the people knew that the time had come <b>to place</b> the leaven <b>in abeyance,</b> meaning that they <b>neither eat nor burn</b> their leaven. When <b>both of</b> the loaves <b>were taken</b> away, <b>they all began burning</b> their leaven.

### Part 16
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abba Shaul says:</b>
