### Part 1
<b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> that taught that even in cases of <b>uprooting</b> oneself from a meal that requires a blessing of significance afterward, one nevertheless is required to recite a new blessing before resuming his meal?

### Part 2
<b>It is Rabbi Yehuda, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>friends who were reclining</b> and eating a meal <b>and uprooted themselves to go to the synagogue or to the study hall, when they exit,</b> these foods <b>do not require a blessing</b> to be recited <b>afterward, and when they return, these foods do not require an introductory blessing</b> before resuming eating. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When they left some of</b> the <b>friends there,</b> at the meal. <b>However, if they did not leave some of the friends there, when they exit,</b> these foods <b>require a blessing</b> to be recited <b>afterward, and when they return,</b> these foods <b>require an introductory blessing.</b> According to Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, the <i>baraita</i> that served as the basis of the Gemara’s objection to the explanation of Rav Ḥisda actually represents the minority opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, whereas Rav Ḥisda holds in accordance with the majority opinion of the Rabbis.

### Part 3
The Gemara infers from the above <i>baraita</i>: <b>The reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> it is only with regard to <b>items</b> of food <b>that require a blessing after them in their place, that when</b> the people eating them <b>exit,</b> these foods <b>do not require a blessing</b> to be recited <b>afterward, and when they return,</b> these foods <b>do not require an introductory blessing. However,</b> if they ate <b>items</b> of food <b>that do not require a blessing</b> that must be recited specifically <b>in their place, even according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda, <b>when</b> these people <b>exit,</b> these foods <b>require a blessing</b> to be recited <b>afterward, and when they return</b> these foods <b>require an introductory blessing.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say that this is a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who holds that a change of location never obligates one to recite a new blessing? The Gemara expresses surprise at this proposition: <b>But didn’t we</b> already <b>refute</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion <b>once?</b> Why is it necessary to refute his ruling yet again? The Gemara admits that this is true but adds: Nevertheless, <b>let us say that this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is also a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan.

### Part 5
The Gemara responds that Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling cannot be definitively refuted from this <i>baraita</i>, as <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said to you: The same is true that even</b> with regard to <b>items</b> of food <b>that do not require a blessing afterward in their place,</b> the people who ate them <b>are also not required to recite</b> a new <b>blessing. And</b> with regard to <b>that which</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: They uprooted themselves,</b> from which it was inferred that the people were eating foods that require a blessing afterward in the place of eating, this phrase serves <b>to convey the far-reaching</b> nature <b>of Rabbi Yehuda’s</b> stringent opinion.

### Part 6
The Gemara explains the previous statement: According to Rabbi Yehuda, <b>even</b> if they were eating <b>items</b> of food <b>that require a blessing after them in their place,</b> and they will definitely return to the meal, <b>the reason</b> that these foods do not require a new blessing is <b>that they left some of</b> their <b>friends</b> at the meal. <b>However, if they did not leave some of</b> their <b>friends, when they exit,</b> these foods <b>require a blessing</b> to be recited <b>afterward, and when they return,</b> these foods <b>require an introductory blessing.</b> Nevertheless, it is possible that the Rabbis are lenient and do not obligate them to recite a new blessing, even if they are eating food that does not require a blessing afterward in the place in which they ate.

### Part 7
The Gemara points out that it <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda:</b> With regard to <b>friends who were reclining to drink wine</b> together <b>and uprooted themselves</b> from their place <b>and</b> subsequently <b>returned</b> to their original location, they <b>need not recite</b> a new <b>blessing.</b> Wine is considered an important beverage that requires a concluding blessing in the place where it was consumed. This <i>baraita</i> explicitly supports the opinion of Rav Ḥisda, who rules with regard to items of this kind that if one left the place where he was drinking and later returned, no new blessing is necessary.

### Part 8
The Gemara returns to the subject of interrupting one’s meal to recite <i>kiddush</i>. <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>members of a group who were reclining</b> and eating a meal, <b>and the day</b> of Shabbat <b>was sanctified, they bring</b> one of the diners <b>a cup of wine and he recites over it the sanctification of the day,</b> i.e., <i>kiddush</i>, <b>and a second</b> cup <b>over which he recites Grace after Meals;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: One</b> may <b>continue eating</b> the rest of his meal, even <b>until dark.</b>
