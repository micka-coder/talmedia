### Part 1
<b>about his property,</b> as the priest who is watching the firstborn wants to slaughter it before it dies, as if it dies, eating it would be prohibited. Therefore, <b>we say: If you permit him</b> to let blood <b>in a place that does not cause a blemish in</b> the animal, <b>he will come to do</b> so <b>in a place that causes a blemish in it,</b> to save his animal.

### Part 2
<b>And the Rabbis</b> respond that if that is the case, <b>all the more so</b> should it be permitted to let blood in a manner that will not cause a blemish, <b>for if you do not permit him</b> to take any steps to save the animal <b>at all, he will come to act</b> in a prohibited manner and cause a blemish. If there is a legitimate alternative, he will not cause a blemish in the firstborn.

### Part 3
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>And do we say</b> that <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda a person is agitated about his property? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One</b> may <b>not scrape an animal on a Festival</b> with a fine-tooth comb, <b>because</b> in doing so <b>he inflicts a wound,</b> which is prohibited on Festivals? <b>However, one</b> may <b>scratch</b> an animal with a wide-tooth comb, as this does not inflict a wound. <b>And the Rabbis say: One</b> may <b>neither scrape nor even scratch,</b> for if one were permitted to scratch an animal he might come to scrape it as well.

### Part 4
<b>And it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>What is scraping and what is scratching? Scraping</b> is performed with a comb with <b>small</b> teeth <b>and</b> with which <b>one inflicts a wound. Scratching</b> is performed with a comb that has <b>large</b> teeth <b>and</b> with which <b>one does not inflict a wound.</b> Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda does not issue a decree to prohibit scratching lest one come to scrape, even though he is agitated over his property.

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>There,</b> with regard to a firstborn, it is different, <b>for if he leaves it</b> and does nothing the animal <b>will die,</b> and therefore <b>we say</b> that <b>a person is agitated over his property.</b> In his agitated state he will overlook the details of permitted and prohibited actions and violate a prohibition. <b>Here,</b> however, <b>if he leaves</b> his animal and does not comb it, <b>it will merely</b> suffer <b>pain</b> from the stinging insects. In that case <b>we do not say</b> that <b>a person is agitated about his property.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yehuda, what is different with regard to leavened bread that he issued a decree</b> lest a person come to eat the prohibited food, <b>and what is different with regard to scraping that he did not issue</b> a comparable <b>decree?</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda maintains that unleavened <b>bread</b> might be <b>interchanged with</b> leavened <b>bread,</b> whereas <b>scraping</b> would <b>not be interchanged with scratching.</b> Since one uses a completely different utensil in the performance of the prohibited action, interchanging the two actions is unlikely.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The <i>tanna’im</i> disagree regarding until what time leaven may be eaten and at what time it must be removed on Passover eve. <b>Rabbi Meir says: One</b> may <b>eat</b> leaven <b>the entire fifth</b> hour of the fourteenth of Nisan, <b>and one</b> must <b>burn</b> it immediately afterward <b>at the beginning of the sixth</b> hour. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One</b> may <b>eat the entire fourth</b> hour <b>and</b> one <b>places it in abeyance</b> for <b>the entire fifth</b> hour, <b>and one burns</b> it <b>at the beginning of the sixth</b> hour.

### Part 8
<b>And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said: Two disqualified loaves of a thanks-offering are placed on the bench</b> in the colonnade in the Temple as an indicator. There was a specially designated place for these loaves in the Temple. <b>As long as</b> the loaves <b>are placed</b> there, <b>the entire nation</b> continues to <b>eat</b> leaven. When <b>one</b> of the loaves <b>was taken</b> away, the people know that the time had come <b>to place</b> the leaven <b>in abeyance,</b> meaning that they <b>neither eat nor burn</b> their leaven. When <b>they were both taken</b> away, <b>the entire nation began burning</b> their leaven.

### Part 9
<b>Rabban Gamliel says</b> that the times are divided differently: <b>Non-sacred</b> foods <b>are eaten the entire fourth</b> hour, <b>and <i>teruma</i></b> may be eaten during <b>the entire fifth</b> hour. Since it is a mitzva to eat <i>teruma</i> and burning it is prohibited, additional time was allocated for its consumption. <b>And one burns</b> all leaven including <i>teruma</i> <b>at the beginning of the sixth</b> hour.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara seeks to draw a comparison between this dispute of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda and a dispute between them on a different topic. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there:</b> If <b>one</b> witness <b>says</b> that an incident occurred <b>on the second</b> day <b>of the month and one</b> other witness <b>says</b> that it happened on <b>the third</b> day of that month, <b>their testimony is valid.</b> This minor contradiction does not invalidate the testimony.

### Part 11
The mishna explains: The reason is <b>that this</b> witness <b>knows about the addition</b> of an extra day <b>to</b> the previous <b>month.</b> Since he knows that the court added a day to the previous month, which lasted thirty days, he testifies that the incident occurred on the second day of the month. <b>And that</b> witness <b>does not know about the addition</b> of an extra day <b>to</b> the previous <b>month,</b> and he therefore thinks that the incident in question occurred on the third of the month.

### Part 12
If <b>one says</b> that the incident occurred on <b>the third</b> day of the month <b>and one says</b> it happened <b>on the fifth, their testimony is void,</b> as there is no way to rationalize this contradiction. Similarly, if <b>one says</b> the incident occurred <b>at two hours</b> of the day <b>and one says</b> it happened <b>at three hours, their testimony is valid,</b> as that discrepancy could be the result of the lack of precision. However, if <b>one says</b> it occurred <b>at three</b> hours <b>and one says</b> it took place <b>at five</b> hours, <b>their testimony is void.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In the last case, <b>their testimony is valid,</b> as it could be that one is slightly mistaken. However, if <b>one says</b> it happened <b>at five</b> hours <b>and one says at seven</b> hours, everyone agrees that <b>their testimony is void.</b> That is a clear contradiction that cannot be rationalized as a miscalculation, <b>as at five</b> hours of the day <b>the sun</b> is <b>in the east, and at seven</b> hours <b>the sun</b> is already <b>in the west.</b> It is impossible to confuse the fifth hour with the seventh.

### Part 14
<b>Abaye said: When</b> analyzing the matter, <b>you will find</b> that you can <b>say</b> that <b>according to the statement of Rabbi Meir a person does not err at all,</b> as Rabbi Meir assumes that people know the exact time of day. <b>According to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda a person errs</b> up to <b>half an hour.</b> Abaye elaborates: <b>According to the statement of Rabbi Meir, a person does not err at all,</b> and the reason that in the case where one says two hours and one says three the testimony is valid is that <b>the incident</b> actually <b>occurred as the second</b> hour <b>ended and the third</b> hour <b>began. And</b> when <b>this</b> witness <b>said</b> it happened in <b>the second</b> hour he was referring to <b>the end of the second</b> hour. When <b>that</b> witness <b>said the third</b> hour he was referring to <b>the beginning of the third</b> hour. It is possible that both witnesses spoke the truth.

### Part 15
Abaye continues his explanation: <b>According to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, a person errs</b> by <b>half an hour,</b> as <b>when</b> the <b>incident occurred, it occurred at the midpoint of the fourth</b> hour, at three and a half hours of the day. <b>And this</b> witness, <b>who says three</b> hours, means <b>the end of the third hour, and</b> he <b>errs</b> by saying that it occurred <b>half an hour before</b> the incident actually occurred. <b>And that</b> witness, <b>who says five</b> hours, means <b>the beginning of the fifth</b> hour, i.e., the end of the fourth hour, <b>and he errs</b> by saying that it occurred <b>half an hour after</b> the incident actually occurred. Since it is possible that their testimonies do not conflict, their testimony is valid.

### Part 16
<b>Some say</b> a different version of this statement. <b>Abaye said: When</b> analyzing the matter, <b>you will find</b> that you can <b>say</b> that <b>according to Rabbi Meir a person errs a bit,</b> and <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda a person errs</b> by <b>an hour and a bit.</b> Abaye elaborates: <b>According to Rabbi Meir, a person errs a bit,</b> as <b>when</b> the <b>incident occurred, it occurred either at the end of the second</b> hour <b>or at the beginning of the third</b> hour, <b>and one of</b> the two witnesses <b>errs a bit. According to Rabbi Yehuda, a person errs</b> by <b>an hour and a bit,</b> as <b>when</b> the <b>incident occurred, it occurred either at the end of the third</b> hour <b>or at the beginning of the fifth</b> hour,
