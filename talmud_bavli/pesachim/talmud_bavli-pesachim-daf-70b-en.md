### Part 1
with few people registered for it, so that each person receives a <b>large</b> portion of the offering. Therefore, there is no need for a Festival peace-offering or for a cleaver. The Gemara questions this answer: <b>How do</b> the owners <b>know</b> already on the thirteenth that only a small number of people will be registered for the Paschal lamb? Perhaps more people will register for the offering before it is slaughtered, in which case we should assume that the cleaver was immersed, as it might be necessary to bring a Festival peace-offering together with the Paschal lamb.

### Part 2
<b>Rather,</b> we must say that we are talking about a Paschal lamb <b>that came in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity,</b> in which case a Festival peace-offering is not brought, and consequently there is no need for a cleaver. The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately, how do</b> the owners <b>know</b> already on the thirteenth when they are immersing their knives that the Paschal lamb will be brought in ritual impurity, so that they need not immerse their chopping knives? Perhaps it will turn out that most of the community is ritually pure.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers that we are talking about a situation <b>where the <i>Nasi</i> died,</b> in which case all of Israel must defile themselves in order to participate in his burial. The Gemara asks: <b>When did the <i>Nasi</i> die? If you say that he died on the thirteenth</b> and everyone became ritually impure as a result, <b>why do I</b> need <b>to immerse the</b> slaughtering <b>knife</b> to begin with? It will become ritually impure again in any event. <b>Rather, he died on the fourteenth</b> and they did not know in advance that the Paschal lamb would be brought in a state of impurity. But if so, <b>what is different</b> about <b>the</b> slaughtering <b>knife</b> that <b>he immerses</b> it <b>and what is different</b> about <b>the cleaver</b> that <b>he does not immerse it?</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case where <b>the <i>Nasi</i> was in a dying state on the thirteenth.</b> With regard to <b>a</b> slaughtering <b>knife,</b> about which there is only <b>one doubt,</b> that perhaps the <i>Nasi</i> will die before the Festival and the Paschal lamb will be brought in a state of ritual impurity, <b>he immerses it,</b> for if the <i>Nasi</i> does not die he will need a ritually pure knife to slaughter his Paschal lamb. With regard to <b>a cleaver,</b> about which there are <b>two doubts,</b> that perhaps the <i>Nasi</i> will die and a ritually pure knife will not be needed, and that even if he does not die, perhaps the meat of the Paschal lamb will be plentiful and the Festival peace-offering will not be brought, <b>he does not immerse it.</b>

### Part 5
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Yehuda ben Dortai separated</b> himself from the other Rabbis, <b>he and Dortai his son, and went and settled in the south</b> so that he would not be obligated to bring the Paschal lamb, seeing that he was at a great distance from Jerusalem. He did this because he disagreed with the Rabbis with regard to the Festival peace-offering of the fourteenth, which in their view does not override Shabbat. <b>He said: If Elijah will come and say to the Jewish people: For what</b> reason <b>did you not sacrifice the Festival peace-offering on Shabbat, what</b> will <b>they say to him? I am astounded at the two</b> most <b>eminent</b> scholars <b>of the generation, Shemaya and Avtalyon, who are great sages and great expositors</b> of the Torah, <b>and</b> yet <b>they did not tell the Jewish people</b> that even <b>the Festival peace-offering</b> of the fourteenth <b>overrides Shabbat.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav said: What is ben Dortai’s reason? As it is written: “And you shall slaughter the Paschal offering to the Lord your God from the flock and from the herd,</b> in the place which the Lord shall choose to rest His name there” (Deuteronomy 16:2). A question must be asked: Does the Paschal offering come from the herd, i.e., from cattle? <b>Doesn’t the Paschal offering</b> come <b>from only the sheep and from the goats,</b> as commanded in the book of Exodus (12:5)? <b>Rather,</b> the verse should be understood as follows. <b>“Flock”; this</b> is referring to <b>the Paschal offering. “Herd”; this</b> is referring to <b>the Festival peace-offering</b> that is brought along with it. <b>And the Merciful One says: “And you shall slaughter the Paschal offering,”</b> thus teaching that the two offerings are sacrificed together. From here ben Dortai derived that the Festival peace-offering of the fourteenth is like the Paschal offering in every way, and so it too overrides Shabbat.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ashi said: Need we arise and explain the reason of those who separated</b> themselves from the other Rabbis? Ben Dortai and his son broke away from all the other sages of the Jewish people, and we need not occupy ourselves with the opinions of such people. <b>Rather, the verse comes</b> to explain the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman, for Rav Naḥman said that Rabba bar Avuh said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>a leftover Paschal offering is sacrificed as a peace-offering?</b> A leftover Paschal offering is an animal that had been consecrated as a Paschal offering but was subsequently lost and later found after a different animal had already been sacrificed in its place. Alternatively, if one set aside and consecrated money for the purchase of a Paschal lamb and then the price of livestock dropped so that there was money left over after the purchase was made, the extra money has the status of a leftover Paschal lamb.

### Part 8
<b>As it is stated: “And you shall slaughter the Paschal offering to the Lord your God from the flock and from the herd.” Does the Paschal offering come from the herd? Doesn’t it come from only the sheep and from the goats? Rather,</b> the verse comes to teach that <b>a leftover Paschal offering shall be</b> brought <b>as something that comes from the flock and from the herd,</b> that is, as a peace-offering, which may be brought from all types of flock and cattle, including both males and females.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks about the crux of the matter: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, what is the reason</b> that the Festival peace-offering <b>does not override Shabbat? It is certainly a communal offering,</b> and all communal offerings override Shabbat.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Ile’a said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Safra: The verse said</b> with regard to the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>: <b>“And you shall celebrate it as a Festival for the Lord, seven days in the year;</b> it shall be a statute forever in your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventh month” (Leviticus 23:41). Now is the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>seven</b> days? <b>They are eight</b> days, as the Eighth Day of Assembly is always celebrated at the conclusion of <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>Rather, from here</b> we derive <b>that the Festival peace-offering</b> [<b><i>ḥagiga</i></b>], about which the verse states: “And you shall celebrate [<i>veḥagotem</i>] it,” <b>does not override Shabbat.</b> Since every eight-day period contains a Shabbat, the Torah said that the Festival [<i>ḥag</i>] is celebrated, i.e., the Festival peace-offering [<i>ḥagiga</i>] can be brought the entire seven days of the Festival.

### Part 11
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: I said before my teachers,</b> pointing out the following difficulty with regard to this source: <b>There are times when you find only six</b> days on which the Festival peace-offering can be brought, <b>for example, when the first day of the Festival occurs on Shabbat,</b> in which case the Eighth Day of Assembly also falls on Shabbat, and so there are only six days on which the Festival peace-offering may be brought. <b>Abaye said: Would the bereaved Avin,</b> another name for Ravin, <b>say such a thing</b> and be so careless as to ask an unfounded question? There is a big difference: <b>Eight you do not find at all;</b> the eight days of the Festival cannot possibly pass without a Shabbat. But <b>seven</b> days on which the Festival peace-offering can be brought <b>are</b> in fact <b>found in most years.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Ulla said that Rabbi Elazar said:</b> With regard to <b>peace-offerings that one slaughtered on the eve of the Festival, one fulfills with them neither</b> the mitzva to bring peace-offerings of <b>rejoicing nor</b> the mitzva to bring a <b>Festival peace-offering.</b> The mitzva of bringing peace-offerings of <b>rejoicing</b> is not fulfilled, <b>as it is written: “And you shall slaughter</b> peace-offerings and eat there, <b>and you shall rejoice</b> before the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 27:7). Based on this verse, <b>we require</b> that the <b>slaughter</b> be
