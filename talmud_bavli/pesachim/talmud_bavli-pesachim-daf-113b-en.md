### Part 1
When <b>the <i>tanna</i> taught</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rava and Rav Safra, Rav Safra’s face lit up</b> with joy, as he was listed among those praised by God. <b>Rava said to him:</b> This does not refer to someone <b>like the Master. Rather,</b> the statement applies to people like <b>Rav Ḥanina and Rav Oshaya, who were cobblers in Eretz Yisrael, and they would sit in the marketplace of prostitutes and fashion shoes for prostitutes. And</b> the prostitutes <b>would enter</b> their shops and <b>look at them.</b> However, due to their piety, these Sages <b>did not raise their eyes to look at</b> the women. And those prostitutes were so impressed with this behavior that when they <b>swore,</b> they would say <b>as follows: By the lives of the holy Sages of Eretz Yisrael.</b> It is this type of bachelor who is praised by Heaven.

### Part 2
The Gemara cites a similar statement. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, loves three</b> people: <b>One who does not get angry; one who does not get drunk; and one who is forgiving. The Holy One, Blessed be He, hates three</b> people: <b>One who says one</b> statement <b>with his mouth and</b> means <b>another in his heart,</b> i.e., a hypocrite; <b>one who knows testimony about another</b> person <b>and does not testify on his behalf; and one who observes a licentious matter</b> performed <b>by another</b> person <b>and testifies against him alone.</b> His testimony is meaningless, as he is the only witness; consequently, he merely gives the individual a bad reputation.

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: This is <b>like</b> that incident <b>where Tuveya sinned</b> with immorality, <b>and Zigud came alone to testify about him before Rav Pappa.</b> Rav Pappa instructed that <b>Zigud be lashed.</b> Zigud <b>said to him: Tuveya sinned and Zigud is lashed,</b> an objection that became a popular saying. <b>He said to him: Yes, as it is written: “One witness shall not rise up against a man”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15), <b>and you testified against him alone. You have merely given him a bad reputation.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> Although one who sees another committing a sin should not testify against him by himself, <b>he is</b> nonetheless <b>permitted to hate him, as it is stated: “If you see the donkey of he who hates you lying under its load”</b> (Exodus 23:5). The Gemara clarifies this verse: <b>What</b> is the meaning of he <b>who hates you</b> mentioned in the verse? <b>If you say</b> it is referring to <b>a gentile who hates</b> you, <b>but wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the phrase: <b>He who hates, of</b> which the Torah <b>spoke, is a Jew who hates</b> you, <b>not a gentile who hates</b> you?

### Part 5
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the verse is referring to <b>a Jew who hates</b> you. <b>But is one permitted to hate</b> a fellow Jew? <b>But isn’t it written: “You shall not hate your brother in your heart”</b> (Leviticus 19:17), which clearly prohibits the hatred of another Jew? <b>Rather,</b> perhaps you will say that the verse is referring to a situation <b>where there are witnesses that he performed a sin.</b> However, in that case, <b>everyone</b> else should <b>also hate him. What is different</b> about this particular person who hates him? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring <b>to a case like this, when he saw him</b> perform <b>a licentious matter?</b> He is therefore permitted to hate him for his evil behavior, whereas others who are unaware of his actions may not hate him.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Not only is this permitted, it is even <b>a mitzva to hate him, as it is stated: “The fear of God is to hate evil”</b> (Proverbs 8:13). <b>Rav Aḥa, son</b> of <b>Rava, said to Rav Ashi: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to</b> whether one who saw someone sin may <b>tell his teacher</b> so that <b>he</b> too <b>will hate him?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: If</b> the student <b>knows</b> that he is <b>trusted by his teacher as two</b> witnesses, and therefore his statement will be accepted, <b>he</b> should <b>tell him, and if</b> he is <b>not</b> trusted by his teacher as two witnesses, he should <b>not tell him.</b>

### Part 7
<b>The Sages taught:</b> There are <b>three</b> types of people <b>whose lives are not lives,</b> due to their constant suffering: <b>The compassionate, the hot tempered, and the delicate. Rav Yosef said: All of these</b> attributes <b>are</b> found <b>in me.</b>

### Part 8
Furthermore, <b>the Sages taught:</b> Members of <b>three</b> groups <b>hate other</b> members of the same group: <b>Dogs, roosters, and the Persian priests. And some say: Also prostitutes. And some say: Also Torah scholars in Babylonia.</b>

### Part 9
Likewise, <b>the Sages taught:</b> Members of <b>three</b> groups <b>love one another: Converts, slaves, and ravens.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Four</b> types of people <b>cannot be endured</b> by anyone: <b>An arrogant pauper; a wealthy person who denies</b> monetary claims against him; <b>a lecherous old man; and a leader who lords over the community for no cause. And some say: Also one who divorces his wife once and twice and takes her back</b> a third time. He should decide definitively whether or not he wants her.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why didn’t <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> mention this case of a man who remarries his wife after two divorces? The Gemara answers: <b>Sometimes</b> the husband’s payment to her in the event of divorce, as stipulated in <b>her marriage contract, is large,</b> and since he is unable to pay he is forced to take her back. <b>Alternatively, he has children with her and cannot divorce her,</b> as he wants someone to care for them.

### Part 12
The Gemara continues: <b>Canaan commanded his sons</b> with regard to <b>five matters</b> that are apparently normal behavior for slaves: <b>Love one another, love robbery, love promiscuity, hate your masters, and do not speak the truth.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Six matters are said with regard to a horse:</b> It <b>loves promiscuity,</b> it <b>loves war, its demeanor is arrogant, it despises sleep, it eats much, and it excretes little. And some say:</b> Just as a horse always rushes straight into the heat of a battle, it <b>also attempts to kill its master in war.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Seven</b> are <b>ostracized by Heaven,</b> despite the fact that they have not been ostracized in any court: <b>A Jew who does not have a wife; and one who has a wife but has no sons; and one who has sons whom he does not raise to</b> engage in <b>Torah study; and one who does not have phylacteries on his head, and phylacteries on his arm, and ritual fringes on his garment, and a <i>mezuza</i> in his doorway; and one who withholds shoes from his feet. And some say: Also one who does not sit with a group</b> that is partaking of a feast in celebration <b>of a mitzva.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Marta said</b> that Rav said, citing <b>Rabbi Yosei of Hutzal: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one</b> may <b>not consult astrologers? As it is stated: “You shall be wholehearted with the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:13). The Torah demands absolute faith in God and acceptance of His justice, without attempting to predict the future.

### Part 16
<b>And from where</b> is it derived concerning <b>one who knows about another that he is greater than him, even in one matter, that he must treat him with respect? As it is stated: “Because a surpassing spirit was in him, the king thought to set him over the whole realm”</b> (Daniel 6:4). This verse teaches that one who is in any way greater than another person is worthy of his respect.

### Part 17
<b>And</b> it was also stated by Rabba bar bar Ḥana: With regard to a woman who was <b>observing</b> her days of ritually <b>pure blood,</b> and those days have ended, she <b>is prohibited to engage in intimacy</b> immediately, lest she see ritually impure blood. Any blood emitted by a woman within forty days after giving birth to a male child or eighty days after giving birth to a female child is ritually pure. After this period of time has passed, a woman should not have relations with her husband immediately. The Gemara asks: <b>Until when</b> is she prohibited to her husband? <b>Rav said:</b> She must wait <b>a set interval of time</b> for the ritual impurity of a <i>nidda</i>, i.e., either one day or one night.

### Part 18
With regard to Rabbi Yosei of Hutzal, it was <b>taught:</b> The <b>Yosef of Hutzal</b> mentioned in other places in the Gemara <b>is</b> the same person as <b>Yosef the Babylonian.</b> Yosef is the full name of Yosei. Furthermore, <b>he is</b> also known as <b>Isi ben Gur Arye, he is Isi ben Yehuda, he is Isi ben Gamliel,</b> and <b>he is Isi ben Mahalalel. And what is his</b> real <b>name? His</b> real <b>name</b> is <b>Isi ben Akavya.</b> Similarly, the Sage <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Tavla is</b> also known as <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Ḥakla,</b> who <b>is Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Ela.</b> These are two cases of one Sage with several names.
