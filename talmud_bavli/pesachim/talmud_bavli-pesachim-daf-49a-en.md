### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>the fourteenth</b> of Nisan <b>that occurs on Shabbat, one removes all</b> leaven from his possession, whether it is <i>teruma</i> or non-sacred food, <b>before Shabbat,</b> except for that which will be eaten during the first part of Shabbat. In that case, one cannot remove leaven from his possession on the fourteenth of Nisan itself as he does in other years. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> One may remove the leaven <b>at its</b> usual <b>time</b> on the fourteenth of Nisan by throwing it away or declaring it ownerless. <b>Rabbi Eliezer bar Tzadok says: <i>Teruma</i></b> should be removed <b>before Shabbat,</b> as only a few people are permitted to eat it and therefore one can presume that it will remain uneaten during Shabbat. However, <b>non-sacred</b> foods should be removed <b>at their</b> usual <b>time,</b> on the fourteenth of Nisan itself.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer bar Tzadok says: One time my father,</b> Rabbi Tzadok, <b>spent Shabbat in Yavne, and the fourteenth</b> of Nisan <b>occurred on</b> that <b>Shabbat. Zonin,</b> who was <b>the appointee of Rabban Gamliel, came and said: The time has come to remove leavened bread; and I went with my father and we removed the leavened bread.</b> This story serves as anecdotal evidence that leaven is removed at the usual time on the fourteenth of Nisan, even on Shabbat.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who is traveling</b> on the eve of Passover <b>to slaughter his Paschal lamb, to circumcise his son, or to eat a betrothal feast in his father-in-law’s house, and he remembers that he has leavened bread in his house, if he is able to return</b> to his house <b>and remove</b> the leaven and afterward <b>return to the mitzva</b> toward which he was traveling, <b>he should return</b> home <b>and remove</b> his leaven. <b>But if</b> there is not enough time for him to go home and remove the leaven, and still complete the mitzva that he already began, <b>he should nullify it in his heart,</b> as by Torah law this is sufficient.

### Part 4
If one was traveling <b>to save</b> Jews from an attack by <b>gentiles, from a</b> flooding <b>river, from bandits, from a fire, or from a collapsed</b> building, he should not even attempt to return, and instead <b>he should nullify</b> the leaven <b>in his heart.</b> This applies even if he could remove his leaven and still return to his previous activity. If he went <b>to establish his Shabbat</b> residence in order to adjust his Shabbat limit for an <b>optional</b> purpose, rather than in order to fulfill a commandment, <b>he should return immediately</b> to remove his leaven.

### Part 5
<b>And so too,</b> the same <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>one who left Jerusalem and remembered that there was consecrated meat in his hand.</b> Meat that is taken out of Jerusalem becomes disqualified, and one is required to burn it in proximity to the Temple. <b>If he passed</b> the area of Mount <b>Scopus</b> [<b><i>Tzofim</i>],</b> beyond which one cannot see Jerusalem, <b>he burns</b> the meat <b>at the site</b> where <b>he</b> is located; <b>and if</b> he has <b>not</b> traveled that far, <b>he must return and burn it before the Temple with wood from the arrangement</b> on the altar, which was designated for burning consecrated items that were disqualified.

### Part 6
The mishna asks: For <b>how much</b> leaven or consecrated meat is one required <b>to return? Rabbi Meir says:</b> In both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case, one must return for <b>an egg-bulk. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case, one must return for <b>an olive-bulk. And the Rabbis say</b> that the amount depends on the case: With regard to <b>consecrated meat,</b> he is required to return if he has <b>an olive-bulk, but</b> in a case where he remembers that he has <b>leavened bread,</b> he required to return only <b>for an egg-bulk.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> between this mishna and another source. It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who is traveling to eat a betrothal feast in his father-in-law’s house or to establish his Shabbat</b> residence for an <b>optional</b> purpose, <b>must return immediately</b> to remove his leaven. This contradicts the mishna, which states that one who is going to a betrothal feast may nullify the leaven without returning for it, because the meal is considered a mitzva.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> as there is a tannaitic dispute with regard to the issue. <b>This</b> source, the <i>baraita</i>, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> while <b>that</b> source, the mishna, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A betrothal feast is optional;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It is a <b>mitzva.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And now that Rav Ḥisda said: The dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei applies to <b>the second</b> betrothal feast, where the groom takes part in an additional meal with the bride’s family, <b>but everyone agrees that the first</b> betrothal <b>feast is a mitzva,</b> the contradiction between the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> can be resolved differently. <b>Even if you say that this</b> mishna and <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> are both in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> it is <b>not difficult. This</b> mishna, which relates to the meal as a mitzva, is referring to <b>the first meal. That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which assumes that the meal is not a mitzva, is referring to <b>the second meal.</b>

### Part 10
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: I heard only</b> that there is a mitzva with regard to a <b>betrothal feast</b> itself, <b>but not</b> with regard to the feast of the <b>gifts [<i>sivlonot</i>],</b> when the groom would present gifts to the bride. While a festive meal was eaten on this occasion, it was not considered to be a mitzva. <b>Rabbi Yosei said to him: I heard</b> that both <b>a betrothal feast and</b> the feast of the <b>gifts</b> are considered mitzvot.

### Part 11
Having discussed whether a betrothal feast is a mitzva, the Gemara addresses a related issue. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: A Torah scholar may not</b> derive <b>benefit from</b> partaking in <b>any feast that is not a mitzva.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>In what case</b> does this statement apply? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: In a case</b> where <b>the daughter of a priest</b> marries <b>an Israelite,</b> or where <b>the daughter of a Torah scholar</b> marries <b>an ignoramus.</b> Although a wedding feast is generally a mitzva, it is not in this case, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> When <b>the daughter of a priest</b> marries <b>an Israelite their union will not be auspicious,</b> as it is disgraceful for the priesthood when the daughter of a priest marries an Israelite.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by <b>this</b> statement that their union will be inauspicious? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The inauspicious nature of such a marriage can be identified based on the verse describing the return of a daughter of a priest to her father’s house after marrying a non-priest. The verse is understood as mentioning that the marriage will result in one of three possibilities: she will <b>either be a widow, a divorcee, or without children</b> (see Leviticus 22:13). <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> Either her husband <b>will bury her or she will bury him,</b> because one of them will die young, <b>or she will cause him to become poor.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> himself <b>say: One who wishes to become wealthy should cling to the descendants of Aaron,</b> and <b>all the more so</b> should the merit of the <b>Torah</b> and the <b>priesthood cause them to become wealthy.</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> case, where he becomes wealthy, <b>refers to a Torah scholar</b> who marries a woman of priestly lineage. In that case their union will be a successful one. <b>That</b> case, where their union will not be auspicious, refers to <b>an ignoramus</b> who marries a woman of priestly lineage.

### Part 15
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua married a daughter of a priest</b> and <b>became ill. He said:</b> Apparently, <b>it is not satisfactory to Aaron</b> the priest <b>that I cling to his descendants, so that he has a son-in-law like me.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara also relates that <b>Rav Idi bar Avin married a daughter of a priest. Two sons</b> who were <b>ordained</b> to decide halakhic matters <b>came from him,</b> namely <b>Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, and Rabbi Yehoshua, son of Rav Idi.</b> Similarly, <b>Rav Pappa said: Had I not married a daughter of a priest, I would not have become wealthy.</b>

### Part 17
On the other hand, <b>Rav Kahana,</b> who was not a priest, <b>said: Had I not married a daughter of a priest, I would not have been exiled,</b> as Rav Kahana was forced to flee from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael. <b>They said to him: But you were exiled to a place of Torah,</b> which is not a punishment at all. He answered: <b>I was not exiled as people are</b> generally <b>exiled,</b> i.e., I did not emigrate of my own free will; rather, I was forced to flee from the authorities.

### Part 18
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who benefits from</b> partaking in <b>an optional feast,</b> which is not a mitzva, <b>will ultimately be exiled, as it is stated: “And eat the lambs of the flock and the calves out of the midst of the stall”</b> (Amos 6:4), <b>and it is written: “Therefore now they shall go into exile at the head of the exiles;</b> and the revelry of those who stretched themselves out shall pass away” (Amos 6:7).

### Part 19
The Gemara continues discussing a Torah scholar who benefits from optional feasts. <b>The Sages taught: Any Torah scholar who feasts excessively everywhere</b> degrades himself and brings suffering upon himself. He will <b>ultimately destroy his house, widow his wife, orphan his chicks,</b> i.e., his children, <b>and his studies will be forgotten. Much dispute will come upon him, his words will not be heeded, and he will desecrate God’s name and the name of his master and the name of his father. And he will cause a bad name for himself, his children, and his descendants throughout future generations.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>What is this</b> bad reputation that he causes to himself and his descendants? <b>Abaye said:</b> His son <b>is called the son</b> [<b><i>bar</i></b>] <b>of the one who heats ovens,</b> since this person continually heated ovens in order to prepare food for feasts. <b>Rava said:</b> His son will be called <b>the son of the one who dances</b> in <b>inns [<i>bei kuvei</i>],</b> as he seems to be invited to every feast to entertain the guests. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> His son will be called <b>the son of the one who licks bowls [<i>pinkhei</i>]. Rav Shemaya said:</b> His son will be called <b>the son of the one who folds</b> his garment <b>and crouches,</b> i.e., falls asleep drunk.

### Part 21
On the topic of proper marriage partners, the Gemara cites the following discussion. <b>The Sages taught: One should always</b> be willing to <b>sell all he has</b> in order to <b>marry the daughter of a Torah scholar, as if he dies or</b> if he <b>is exiled</b> and he cannot raise his children, <b>he can be assured that his sons will be Torah scholars,</b> since their mother will ensure that they are well educated. <b>And one should not marry the daughter of an ignoramus, as if he dies or is exiled, his sons will be ignoramuses.</b>

### Part 22
Furthermore, <b>the Sages taught: One should always</b> be willing to <b>sell all he has</b> in order to <b>marry the daughter of a Torah scholar and</b> in order to <b>marry off his daughter to a Torah scholar.</b> This type of marriage can be <b>compared to grapes of a vine</b> that become intertwined <b>with grapes of a vine, something</b> which is <b>beautiful and acceptable</b> to God and man. <b>And one should not marry the daughter of an ignoramus.</b> This type of marriage can be <b>compared to grapes of a vine</b> that have become intertwined <b>with berries of a bramble,</b> which is <b>something unseemly</b>
