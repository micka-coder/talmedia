### Part 1
as <b>it could enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat with it <i>matzot</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3), one might have thought that <b>anyone included</b> in the obligation <b>to eat <i>matza</i> is</b> also <b>included</b> in the <b>prohibition against eating leavened bread. And these women, since they are excluded</b> from the obligation <b>to eat <i>matza</i>, as it is a time-bound, positive mitzva</b> from which they are exempt as a rule, I might <b>say they are also excluded from the prohibition against eating leavened bread.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that women are also prohibited from eating leavened bread.

### Part 2
The Gemara comments: <b>And now</b> that women <b>have been included in the prohibition against eating leavened bread, they</b> should <b>also be included</b> in the obligation <b>to eat <i>matza</i>,</b> even though it is a time-bound, positive mitzva, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. As Rabbi Eliezer said: Women are obligated to eat <i>matza</i> by Torah</b> law, <b>as it is stated: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it;</b> seven days you shall eat with it <i>matzot</i>” (Deuteronomy 16:3). These two commandments are juxtaposed to teach that <b>anyone included</b> in <b>the prohibition against eating leavened bread is</b> also <b>included in</b> the obligation <b>to eat <i>matza</i>. And these women too, since they</b> are <b>included</b> in <b>the prohibition against eating leavened bread, they are</b> also <b>included in</b> the obligation <b>to eat <i>matza</i>.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara questions this derivation: <b>What did you see</b> that led you to understand <b>that</b> the term <b>anything [<i>kol</i>]</b> comes to <b>include women and to exclude</b> leaven in <b>its mixture?</b> On the contrary, <b>say</b> that it comes <b>to include</b> in the punishment of <i>karet</i> one who eats <b>its mixture.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>It is reasonable</b> to explain that the verse comes to include women since the verse is <b>dealing with those who</b> are obligated in the mitzva not to <b>eat</b> leavened bread, <b>it includes those who eat,</b> as the verse says: “For anyone who eats leavened bread…shall be cut off.” It stands to reason that the expression: Anyone [<i>kol</i>] includes additional people who are punishable by <i>karet</i>, not additional types of leaven. Would a verse that <b>is dealing with those who</b> may not <b>eat</b> leaven come to <b>include</b> additional types of foods that may not <b>be eaten?</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Natan, father of Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, strongly objects to this: And anywhere that</b> a verse <b>is dealing with those who eat, does</b> it necessarily <b>not</b> come to <b>include</b> additional <b>types of food</b> in the prohibition? <b>Wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“For anyone who eats the fat of the domesticated animal, of which men present</b> an offering of fire to God, the soul that eats it shall be cut off from its people” (Leviticus 7:25)? The Sages interpreted this verse: <b>I have</b> derived from this verse that the prohibition applies <b>only</b> to the <b>fats</b> of <b>unblemished</b> animals <b>that are fit to be sacrificed. From where</b> is it derived that it is also prohibited to eat the <b>fats of blemished animals,</b> which may not be offered as sacrifices? <b>The verse states: “Of the domesticated animal.” From where</b> is it derived that it is prohibited to eat the <b>fats of non-sacred</b> animals? <b>The verse states: “For anyone</b> who eats the fat.” Rav Natan explains his objection: <b>Here, isn’t</b> the verse <b>dealing with those who eat</b> fats, and nevertheless, its superfluous phrases come to <b>include</b> types of foods that may not <b>be eaten.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the verse concerning prohibited fats, <b>where there are no</b> additional people <b>who eat</b> of it to include, as the prohibition already applies to everyone, the superfluous expression comes <b>to include</b> additional <b>foods. Here,</b> in the verse that deals with leavened bread, <b>where there are</b> people <b>who eat</b> of it who can be included, namely women, the verse does <b>not exclude</b> people <b>who eat and include</b> foods that are <b>eaten.</b> Generally, there should be a connection between the content of a verse and that which is derived from it. Only when no other derivation is possible is a less related matter derived.

### Part 7
The Gemara explains: <b>And the Rabbis, who are not of</b> the opinion that leaven in a <b>mixture</b> is included in the prohibition, <b>do not interpret</b> that the term: <b>Anything [<i>kol</i>],</b> comes to include other matters; neither with regard to leaven in a mixture nor with regard to <i>karet</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>However,</b> in that case, <b>from where do they</b> derive that it is prohibited for <b>women</b> to eat leavened bread?

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: Although <b>they do not derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from the term: <b>Anything, they derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from the expression: <b>For anyone [<i>ki kol</i>],</b> in the verse: “For anyone who eats leaven.”

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if indeed the phrase: For anyone, is a more inclusive expression than the simple word anything, then according to <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> another <i>halakha</i> could also be derived from here. <b>Say</b> that the phrase: <b>Anyone</b> who eats leaven, comes <b>to include the women,</b> and the phrase: <b>For anyone</b> who eats, comes <b>to include</b> leaven in <b>its mixture.</b> According to Rabbi Eliezer, then, one would be punishable by <i>karet</i> for eating leaven in a mixture.

### Part 10
<b>And lest you say that Rabbi Eliezer does not derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from the phrase: <b>For anyone [<i>ki kol</i>],</b> as he does not consider this an inclusive expression, the result would be another contradiction. <b>Wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: “For no [<i>ki kol</i>] leaven nor any honey shall be offered as a burnt-offering before God” (Leviticus 2:11)? Had the verse stated only: <b>You shall not offer leaven, I would have</b> derived <b>nothing other</b> than the <i>halakha</i> that it is prohibited to sacrifice <b>an entire</b> piece of leaven. <b>From where</b> is it derived that it is also prohibited to sacrifice <b>part of it? The verse states: “No [<i>kol</i>]</b> leaven,” indicating that it is prohibited to sacrifice even part of it. <b>From where</b> is it derived that it is prohibited to sacrifice leaven in <b>a mixture? The verse states: “For no</b> [<b><i>ki kol</i></b>] leaven.” The Gemara analyzes this statement: <b>Whom did you hear who derives</b> <i>halakhot</i> from the term: <b><i>Kol</i>?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Eliezer, and</b> nevertheless, <b>he derives</b> additional details from the expression: <b><i>Ki kol</i>.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara concludes: This matter remains <b>difficult,</b> as no satisfactory explanation has been found for why Rabbi Eliezer does not derive from the expression <i>ki kol</i> that leaven in a mixture is also prohibited.

### Part 12
After discussing leaven in a mixture, the Gemara states a more general principle. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: With regard to all prohibitions of the Torah, a permitted</b> substance <b>does not join together with a prohibited</b> substance. If one eats a permitted food with a prohibited food, and together they constitute the minimum prohibited measure, he is exempt from punishment for this act of consumption. This principle applies to all <i>halakhot</i> <b>except for the prohibitions of a nazirite,</b> who is liable for eating a mixture of that kind, <b>as the Torah said</b> with regard to a nazirite: “He shall abstain from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, nor shall he drink anything <b>soaked</b> in grapes” (Numbers 6:3). This verse indicates that a nazirite is prohibited from consuming not only wine and vinegar, but also any food that was soaked in these liquids.

### Part 13
<b>And Ze’eiri said:</b> Permitted and prohibited substances <b>also</b> combine with regard to <b>the prohibition against offering leaven</b> on the altar, as it states: “For no [<i>kol</i>] leaven and no [<i>kol</i>] honey shall be offered as a burnt-offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11). This indicates that one is also liable for sacrificing leaven in a mixture (<i>Tosafot</i>) in addition to the liability for sacrificing pure leaven.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Ze’eiri issue his ruling? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who derives</b> from the term <b><i>kol</i></b> that any mixture that contains any amount of a prohibited substance is not nullified.

### Part 15
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b>
