### Part 1
or <b>its blood was spilled,</b> or <b>its blood was taken outside the hangings</b> that denoted the courtyard of the Tabernacle, <b>we maintain</b> that it must be <b>burned; from where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>We derive it from</b> the exposition of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse that states: “Any sin-offering from which some blood has been brought to the Tent of Meeting, to make atonement <b>in the sacred place,</b> shall not be eaten; <b>it shall be burned in fire”</b> (Leviticus 6:23), <b>has taught that the burning of a sin-offering is in the sacred</b> area, the Temple courtyard.

### Part 3
<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>this alone,</b> a sin-offering; with regard to <b>the rest of the disqualified offerings of the most sacred order and the portions of offerings of lesser sanctity</b> that are consumed on the altar, <b>from where do we</b> derive that they must be burned in the Temple courtyard, which is their boundary when they are valid? <b>The verse states: “Any…in the sacred place…shall be burned in fire,”</b> which teaches that any consecrated item must be burned in a sacred place.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks further: <b>We found</b> a source for <b>offerings of the most sacred order; from where do we derive</b> that it also applies to <b>offerings of lesser sanctity? Rather,</b> we must say as follows: <b>Anything disqualified in the sacred</b> area, the Temple courtyard, must be <b>burned.</b> It is <b>no different</b> whether it is <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, and</b> it is <b>no different</b> whether it is <b>offerings of the most sacred order; they learned it as a tradition. And the sin-offering of Aaron</b> that was burned on the eighth day of inauguration was mentioned only <b>because the incident that took place, took place in this way.</b> It was not mentioned in order to teach the <i>halakhot</i> of offerings.

### Part 5
The Gemara proceeds to ask an unrelated question with regard to <i>piggul</i>: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i> from the school of Rabba bar Avuh, who said</b> that <b>even <i>piggul</i>,</b> which is a disqualification of the animal itself, <b>requires decay of form,</b> meaning that it must be left over until the next day so that it will begin to decay and is only then burned, <b>from where do we</b> derive that it requires decay of form?

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>It is derived</b> from a verbal analogy from the parallel words <b>“iniquity”</b> and <b>“iniquity.”</b> With regard to <i>piggul</i>, the verse states: “It remains rejected [<i>piggul</i>]; and the soul that eats it shall bear its iniquity” (Leviticus 7:18), and with regard to <b>leftover</b> sacrificial meat, the verse states: “And whatever is leftover…shall be burned in fire…and each of those who eat it shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 19:6–8). Just as leftover sacrificial meat is burned after it has been left over to the next day, so too, <i>piggul</i> is burned only after it has been left over to the next day and its form has decayed.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Let us</b> instead <b>learn</b> the rules of <i>piggul</i> <b>through</b> a verbal analogy based on the parallel words <b>“iniquity”</b> and <b>“iniquity”</b> from <b>the sin-offering of Aaron,</b> with regard to which the verse states: “Why did you not eat the sin-offering in the place of sanctity…and He gave it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation” (Leviticus 10:17). The sin-offering of Aaron was burned immediately, without decay of form, so why can it not be learned from there that <i>piggul</i> does not require decay of form either? That <i>tanna</i> could have <b>said to you: The sin-offering of Aaron in a case like this would also require decay of form</b> were it to occur <b>in</b> future <b>generations; but there,</b> when it was burned immediately, <b>it was a provisional edict</b> issued in exigent circumstances.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Now that we say</b> that we have accepted the conclusion that <b>all disqualified sacred</b> offerings must be <b>burned,</b> and it is <b>no different</b> whether they are disqualified <b>offerings of the most sacred order</b> or <b>offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> because in both cases <b>they learned it as a tradition,</b> with regard to the verse that says: <b>“In the sacred place…shall be burned in fire,” why do I</b> need it? What does this verse teach that is not known from oral tradition? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is required</b> to teach that the requirement of burning that is learned from the oral tradition cannot take place anywhere; <b>its burning</b> must take place only <b>in the sacred</b> place, the Temple courtyard.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks further: If the source of the <i>halakha</i> is an oral tradition, with regard to the verse that states: <b>“The flesh that touches any impure item shall not be eaten, it shall be burned in fire”</b> (Leviticus 7:19), <b>why do I</b> need it? This <i>halakha</i> is included in the oral tradition and should not require its own verse.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse is <b>necessary for itself. It could enter your mind to say</b> that <b>disqualified sacred</b> offerings include only a case <b>where its blood was left overnight</b> instead of being sprinkled on the altar on the day the offering was slaughtered; or <b>its blood was spilled;</b> or <b>its blood was taken outside</b> the hangings; <b>and</b> similarly, the case of an offering that <b>was slaughtered at night.</b> In all these cases, the offering must be <b>burned</b> because these are disqualifications unique to sanctified offerings <b>that do not exist with regard to unconsecrated</b> items.

### Part 11
<b>But</b> if the meat <b>became ritually impure, which disqualifies unconsecrated</b> meat <b>also, say</b> that <b>since it was treated in the manner of unconsecrated items,</b> as the disqualification is not unique to consecrated items, <b>it should not require burning, and burial should be sufficient for it.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that an offering that is disqualified through ritual impurity must also be burned.

### Part 12
It was taught in the mishna that if <b>the owners</b> of the offering <b>became ritually impure or died</b> before the offering was completed, <b>its form</b> must be left to <b>decay,</b> and it is burned after the first day of the Festival. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka disagrees and says that it is burned immediately. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This <b>dispute</b> is about a case in which <b>the owners became ritually impure after the sprinkling</b> of the blood, <b>because the meat was fit for eating</b> since all its services were completed in a valid way. <b>But</b> if <b>the owners became ritually impure before the sprinkling</b> of the blood, such that <b>the meat was not fit for eating</b> even for a moment, <b>all agree</b> that <b>it should be burned immediately.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this statement based on the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>This is the principle:</b> In <b>all</b> cases in which <b>its disqualification is in itself, it should be burned immediately.</b> If the disqualification is <b>in the blood</b> of the offering or <b>in the owners, its form</b> should be left to <b>decay, and</b> then <b>it should be taken out to the place</b> designated for <b>burning.</b>

### Part 14
The following inference can be made based on the formulation of the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>It is teaching</b> that the case of disqualified <b>owners</b> is <b>similar to</b> the case of disqualified <b>blood: Just as</b> in the case of <b>blood</b> the disqualification necessarily occurred <b>before the sprinkling</b> of the blood, as the offering is not disqualified if anything happens to the blood after sprinkling, <b>so too,</b> the case of <b>owners</b> is referring to one in which they became disqualified even <b>before the sprinkling</b> of the blood, which contradicts the statement of Rav Yosef.

### Part 15
<b>Rather, if</b> this <b>was stated</b> in the name of Rav Yosef, <b>it was stated as follows:</b> This <b>dispute</b> is specifically about a case in which <b>the owners became ritually impure before the sprinkling</b> of the blood, such that <b>the meat was never fit for eating, which</b> makes it <b>as though its disqualification is in itself. But</b> if <b>the owners became ritually impure after sprinkling</b> of the blood, such that <b>the meat was fit for eating, all agree</b> that <b>its disqualification is due to a different matter,</b> i.e., an external factor, <b>and it requires decay of form.</b>

### Part 16
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even</b> a case in which the owners became ritually impure <b>after sprinkling</b> the blood <b>is</b> included in <b>the dispute</b> about whether decay of form is necessary. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka and Rabbi Neḥemya said the same thing.</b> The statement of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka is that which we said.</b>

### Part 17
With regard to <b>Rabbi Neḥemya, what is</b> the ruling in which he expressed his opinion? It is <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> Aaron’s sin-offering that was burned on the eighth day of inauguration <b>was burned due to acute mourning,</b> as that was the day his sons Nadav and Avihu died. <b>For this</b> reason, <b>it is stated</b> that Aaron explained to Moses: “Now that events such <b>as these</b> befell me, were I to eat this day’s sin-offering would the Lord approve?” (Leviticus 10:19). In other words, it was due to the deaths of his sons, which Aaron referred as “events such as these,” that Aaron burned the sin-offering instead of eating it.

### Part 18
Rabbi Yoḥanan analyzes Rabbi Neḥemya’s statement: <b>Now, acute mourning is similar to</b> a case of disqualification <b>after sprinkling</b> of the blood, because acute mourning merely disqualifies the owners from eating the offering. It does not disqualify the actual performance of the sacrificial service by a High Priest, such as Aaron. Therefore, it is like other disqualifications that take effect after the sprinkling, which simply prohibit the eating of the meat. <b>And when it was burned, it was burned immediately,</b> without waiting until the following day. This shows that Rabbi Neḥemya agrees that an offering that becomes disqualified after its blood has been sprinkled should be burned immediately.
