### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> On <b>the eve of Passover, adjacent to <i>minḥa</i></b> time, <b>a person</b> may <b>not eat until dark,</b> so that he will be able to eat <i>matza</i> that night with a hearty appetite. <b>Even the poorest of Jews</b> should <b>not eat</b> the meal on Passover night <b>until he reclines</b> on his left side, as free and wealthy people recline when they eat. <b>And</b> the distributors of charity should <b>not give</b> a poor person <b>less than four cups of wine</b> for the Festival meal of Passover night. <b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even</b> if the poor person is one of the poorest members of society and receives his food <b>from the charity plate.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara expresses surprise at the mishna’s statement that one may not eat on Passover eve from the time that is adjacent to <i>minḥa</i>. <b>Why discuss</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>particularly</b> with regard to the <b>eves of Passover? Even</b> on the <b>eves of Shabbat and</b> other <b>Festivals it is also</b> prohibited to eat in the late afternoon, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person</b> should <b>not eat on the eves of Shabbat and Festivals from <i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>onward, so that he will enter Shabbat when he</b> has <b>a desire</b> to eat and he will enjoy the Shabbat meal; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: One</b> may <b>continue eating until dark.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Huna said:</b> The mishna <b>was necessary only according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who said</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>continue eating until dark.</b> According to his opinion, the mishna is necessary to emphasize that <b>this applies</b> only <b>on the eves of Shabbat and Festivals. But on the eve of Passover, due to the obligation to</b> eat <b><i>matza</i>,</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>concedes</b> that one must refrain from eating in the afternoon, so that he will eat <i>matza</i> with a good appetite.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Pappa said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> there is still a difference between the eves of Shabbat and other Festivals, as compared with the eve of Passover. <b>There, on the eves of Shabbat and</b> other <b>Festivals,</b> it is only <b>from <i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>onward that it is prohibited</b> to eat, but <b>adjacent to <i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>it is permitted. However, on the eve of Passover, even adjacent to <i>minḥa</i></b> time, <b>it is also prohibited</b> to eat. For this reason, the mishna is referring specifically to the eve of Passover.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And on the eve of Shabbat adjacent to <i>minḥa</i></b> time, is it <b>permitted</b> to eat? <b>But wasn’t</b> the following <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>? <b>A person</b> may <b>not eat on the eve of Shabbat and Festivals from nine hours onward, so that he will enter Shabbat when he is</b> filled with the <b>desire</b> to eat; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: One</b> may <b>continue eating until dark.</b> According to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, even on Shabbat eve one may not eat from before the time of the lesser <i>minḥa</i>, which is at nine and a half hours of the day.

### Part 6
<b>Mar Zutra said: Who will say to us that</b> this version of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is accurate?</b>
