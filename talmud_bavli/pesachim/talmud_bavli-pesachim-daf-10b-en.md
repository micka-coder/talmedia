### Part 1
The Gemara addresses yet another case: If one <b>placed</b> leaven <b>in this corner and found</b> it <b>in another corner,</b> this is akin to <b>the dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an axe that was lost in a house, the house is impure, as I say</b> that <b>a ritually impure person entered</b> the house <b>and took</b> the axe, touching other items in the process. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The house is ritually pure, as I say</b> that <b>he lent</b> the axe <b>to another</b> person <b>and forgot, or that he took it from this corner and placed it in the other corner and forgot.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>A corner, who mentioned anything about it?</b> The <i>baraita</i> was referring to an axe that was lost, not one that was in a different corner.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete, and is teaching the following:</b> With regard to <b>an axe that was lost in a house, the house is ritually impure, as I say</b> that <b>an impure person entered</b> the house <b>and took</b> the axe, <b>or, if</b> the owner <b>placed it in this corner and</b> later <b>found it in another corner, the house is</b> likewise <b>ritually impure, as I say</b> that <b>an impure person entered</b> the house <b>and took</b> the axe <b>from this corner and placed in another corner. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The house is ritually pure, as I say</b> that <b>he lent it to another</b> person <b>and forgot, or that he took it from this corner and placed it in that corner and forgot</b> about it. When the <i>baraita</i> is interpreted in this manner, the dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis applies to the question about leaven.

### Part 4
<b>Rava said:</b> If one saw <b>a mouse enter</b> a house with a <b>loaf</b> of bread <b>in its mouth, and he entered after</b> the mouse <b>and found crumbs,</b> the house <b>requires</b> additional <b>searching, due to</b> the fact that <b>a mouse does not typically generate crumbs.</b> Therefore, it cannot be assumed that these crumbs are from the loaf snatched by the mouse. <b>And Rava</b> also <b>said:</b> If one saw <b>a child enter with a loaf in his hand, and he entered after</b> the child <b>and found crumbs,</b> the house <b>does not require</b> additional <b>searching, because a child typically generates crumbs,</b> and one can therefore assume that the crumbs are from that loaf.

### Part 5
Although the rulings in these cases were clear to Rava, <b>Rava raised a dilemma</b> with regard to a related case: If one saw <b>a mouse enter with a loaf in its mouth, and</b> he saw <b>a mouse leave with a loaf in its mouth, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara elaborates: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>this</b> mouse <b>that entered is that</b> same mouse <b>that left</b> and there is no more leaven left in the house? <b>Or perhaps it is a different</b> mouse.

### Part 6
The Gemara adds: <b>If you say</b> that <b>this</b> mouse <b>that entered was this</b> one <b>that left,</b> another dilemma arises: If one saw <b>a white mouse enter with a loaf</b> of bread <b>in its mouth and a black mouse leave with a loaf</b> of bread <b>in its mouth, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do I say <b>this is certainly a different</b> mouse, <b>or perhaps</b> the black mouse <b>took</b> the loaf <b>from</b> the white mouse?

### Part 7
The Gemara continues to suggest variations on this case: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>mice do not take from each other,</b> as one mouse is generally not significantly stronger than another, if one saw <b>a mouse enter with a loaf</b> of bread <b>in its mouth and a marten leave with a loaf</b> of bread <b>in its mouth, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do I say that <b>the marten certainly took it</b> from the mouse, as it is larger and stronger? <b>Or perhaps it is a different</b> loaf, <b>for if it is so, that</b> the marten <b>took</b> the loaf <b>from the mouse, the mouse</b> itself <b>would</b> also <b>be found in its mouth,</b> as the marten would presumably take not only the loaf of bread but the mouse as well.

### Part 8
<b>And if you say</b> that we accept the contention that <b>if it is so, that</b> if the marten <b>took it from the mouse the mouse</b> itself <b>would be in its mouth,</b> in regard to a case where one saw <b>a mouse enter with a loaf</b> of bread <b>in its mouth and a marten leave with</b> both <b>a loaf</b> of bread <b>and a mouse in its mouth, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do I say that <b>this is certainly the same</b> mouse and loaf, <b>or perhaps</b> even this conclusion can be disputed: <b>If it is so, that this is the same</b> mouse, the <b>loaf would have been found in the mouse’s mouth</b> rather than in the marten’s mouth. Consequently, this must be a different loaf of bread. <b>Or perhaps</b> the loaf of bread <b>fell</b> from the mouse’s mouth <b>due to</b> its <b>fear</b> and the marten <b>took it</b> separately. No satisfactory answer was found for these dilemmas and the Gemara concludes: <b>Let</b> them <b>stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 9
<b>Rava raised a dilemma:</b> If there was <b>a loaf</b> of bread <b>on a high beam</b> in the ceiling, does one <b>need</b> to climb <b>a ladder</b> to <b>take it down or</b> is this effort <b>not necessary? Do we say: The Sages did not</b> obligate one to <b>exert</b> himself that much in his search for leaven, and <b>since</b> the loaf of bread <b>will not fall on its own he will not come to eat it? Or perhaps</b> it can be claimed that <b>sometimes</b> the loaf may <b>fall and he will come to eat it,</b> as objects placed high up occasionally drop.

### Part 10
<b>And if you say</b> with regard to a loaf of bread on a beam, <b>sometimes</b> it will <b>fall and he will come to eat it,</b> in a case where the <b>loaf was in a pit,</b> does one <b>need</b> to use <b>a ladder to bring it up, or</b> is this effort <b>not necessary?</b> The Gemara explains the two sides of the dilemma: <b>Here</b> the loaf <b>will certainly not come up on its own,</b> and one can therefore let it remain where it is; <b>or perhaps</b> there is still a concern that <b>sometimes he</b> might <b>go down</b> into the pit <b>to perform</b> some <b>requirement of his, and he will come to eat it.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara continues to discuss the various permutations of this case. And <b>if you say</b> that <b>sometimes one goes down</b> into the pit <b>for</b> some <b>requirement of his, and he will come to eat it,</b> with regard to <b>a loaf</b> that was <b>in the mouth of a snake,</b> is it <b>necessary</b> for him to bring <b>a snake charmer to take</b> the loaf <b>out</b> of the snake’s mouth, <b>or</b> is this effort <b>not necessary?</b>

### Part 12
Once again the Gemara explains the two sides of the dilemma: Do I say that <b>with regard to his</b> own <b>body the Sages</b> obligate one to <b>exert</b> himself and search everywhere, but <b>with regard to his money the Sages do not</b> obligate one to <b>exert</b> himself, i.e., he is not required to spend money in order to destroy leaven? <b>Or perhaps,</b> the legal status of his money is <b>no different</b> than that of his body, as one must remove leaven wherever he finds it, in any way he can? This series of dilemmas is also left answered and the Gemara concludes: <b>Let</b> them <b>stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One searches</b> for leaven <b>on the evening of the fourteenth</b> of Nisan, <b>and on the fourteenth</b> in <b>the morning, and at the time of</b> the <b>removal</b> of leaven. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> that is not the case; however, if <b>one did not search on the evening of the fourteenth he</b> should <b>search on the fourteenth</b> during the day.

### Part 14
If <b>he did not search on the fourteenth, he should search during the festival</b> of Passover. If <b>he did not search during the Festival, he should search after the Festival,</b> as any leaven that remained in his possession during the Festival is classified as leaven owned by a Jew during Passover, which one is obligated to remove. <b>And</b> the principle is: With regard to the leaven <b>that</b> one <b>leaves</b> after the search, he should <b>place it in</b> a <b>concealed</b> location where it will most likely be left untouched, <b>so that it will not require searching after it</b> if it goes missing.

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that one must conduct a search three times? The Gemara answers: It is <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna who both say:</b> The requirement to conduct three searches <b>corresponds to</b> the <b>three</b> times that <b>the removal</b> of leaven <b>is</b> mentioned <b>in the Torah.</b> One verse says: “<i>Matzot</i> shall be eaten for seven days, and <b>no leavened bread shall be seen with you, neither shall there be leaven seen with you,</b> in all your borders” (Exodus 13:7), and another verse states: <b>“Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:19), while a third verse says: “Seven days shall you eat <i>matzot</i>, <b>yet on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:15).

### Part 16
<b>Rav Yosef raised an objection</b> to this explanation, seeking to prove that even according to Rabbi Yehuda one need not conduct three searches for leaven. He explained that Rabbi Yehuda lists the three times when one may conduct a search for leaven. It was taught in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Anyone who did not search at these three times</b> may <b>no longer search. Apparently,</b> Rabbi Yehuda does not hold that one must conduct three searches. Rather, in regard to whether or not one may conduct a search for leaven if he failed to conduct a search at one of those three opportunities, it is <b>from this</b> point <b>forward that they disagree.</b> The Rabbis hold that one may conduct the search even after the time of the removal of leaven, and Rabbi Yehuda disagrees.

### Part 17
<b>Mar Zutra taught</b> Rav Yosef’s statement in <b>this</b> manner: <b>Rav Yosef raised an objection</b> from that which <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Anyone who did not search at one of these three times</b> may <b>no longer search.</b> In Mar Zutra’s version, Rabbi Yehuda explicitly states: One of these three times, which reinforces the claim that he obligates one to conduct only one search. The Gemara similarly concludes: <b>Apparently,</b> it is with regard to whether or not <b>one</b> may <b>no longer search that they disagree.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara concludes that <b>Rabbi Yehuda also said: If one did not search</b> for leaven bread at the first opportunity, he may do so at the second or third opportunities; however, he may not search for leaven after these three times have passed.

### Part 19
<b>And here,</b> in the mishna, it is <b>about this that they disagree:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>maintains</b> that <b>before the prohibition</b> against eating leaven takes effect, <b>yes,</b> one may conduct a search; <b>after the prohibition</b> against eating leaven takes effect, <b>no,</b> one may no longer conduct a search, due to a rabbinic <b>decree lest one come to eat from</b> the leaven while searching for it. <b>And the Rabbis maintain: We do not issue a decree</b> lest one come to eat from the leaven, and he may therefore conduct a search even after the prohibition against eating leaven has taken effect.

### Part 20
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And does Rabbi Yehuda issue a decree lest one come to eat</b> from the leaven in whose removal he is engaged? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>Once the <i>omer</i></b> offering <b>was sacrificed,</b> people would <b>go out and find the markets of Jerusalem filled with flour and toasted grain,</b> all from the new crop. This grain was undoubtedly harvested and processed when the Torah prohibition against eating from the new crop was still in effect.
