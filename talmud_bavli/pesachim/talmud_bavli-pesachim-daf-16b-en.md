### Part 1
Conversely, <b>blood that is not poured out like water</b> but is received in a vessel to be sprinkled on the altar <b>does not render</b> produce <b>susceptible</b> to contract impurity. <b>Rav Shmuel bar Ami strongly objects to this: There is</b> the <b>blood squeezed</b> from an animal after slaughter once the initial spurt of blood has concluded, <b>which is poured like water,</b> as it is unfit for sprinkling upon the altar. <b>And</b> nevertheless, this blood <b>does not render</b> produce <b>susceptible</b> to impurity.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to him: Leave</b> aside <b>the blood squeezed</b> after the initial spurt, which is an exceptional case, <b>as even from non-sacred</b> animals it <b>does not render</b> produce <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>either.</b> With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that blood renders produce susceptible to ritual impurity, the legal status of blood squeezed after the initial spurt is not that of blood at all.

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: <b>Rav Shmuel bar Ami accepted this</b> statement <b>from</b> Rabbi Zeira and cited a verse that supports it. <b>As the Merciful One states: “Only be strong not to eat the blood; for the blood is the soul”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23). This verse indicates: <b>Blood</b> with regard to which <b>the soul leaves</b> the body when it is spilled <b>is called blood;</b> however, <b>blood</b> with regard to which <b>the soul</b> does not <b>leave</b> the body when it is spilled, but which is squeezed out afterward, <b>is not called blood.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara cites an additional proof that the impurity of liquids is by Torah law. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> With regard to <b>blood that became ritually impure, and</b> a priest <b>sprinkled it</b> on the altar, the following distinction applies: If he did so <b>unwittingly,</b> the offering <b>is accepted.</b> If he sprinkled the blood <b>intentionally,</b> the offering <b>is not accepted.</b> Apparently, blood becomes ritually impure by Torah law, even if it does not transmit impurity to other items. The Gemara rejects this contention: This impurity is <b>by rabbinic law, and</b> this ruling is <b>not in accordance with</b> Rav’s explanation of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Yo’ezer of Tzereida,</b> as he maintains that sacrificial blood does not become impure at all.

### Part 5
The Gemara cites a proof from another mishna. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: For what does the frontplate</b> of the High Priest <b>atone</b> and thereby allow the blood of the offering to be sprinkled? It atones <b>for the blood, and for the meat, and for the fat that became impure, whether</b> one caused it to become impure <b>unwittingly or intentionally, whether due to</b> circumstances <b>beyond</b> his <b>control or willfully,</b> and <b>whether</b> it is the offering <b>of an individual or</b> that <b>of a community.</b> Apparently, the blood of an offering can become impure.

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects this proof: The mishna is referring to blood that is impure <b>by rabbinic law, and</b> here too, it <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Yosei ben Yo’ezer of Tzereida,</b> who says that consecrated blood does not become impure at all.

### Part 7
The Gemara cites an additional proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another verse written about the frontplate: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead, <b>and Aaron shall bear the sin committed with the consecrated</b> objects, which the children of Israel shall hallow, even all their sacred gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before God” (Exodus 28:38).

### Part 8
<b>And</b> the Sages expounded: <b>Which sin does it bear? If</b> you say it atones for <b>the sin of <i>piggul</i>,</b> an offering disqualified by the intention to sacrifice or eat the offering after the permitted time, <b>it is already stated:</b> “And if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is <i>piggul</i>; <b>it shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 19:7). <b>If</b> you say it atones for <b><i>notar</i>,</b> i.e., meat of an offering left after the time that one was permitted to eat it, <b>it is already stated:</b> “And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings is eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, <b>neither shall it be credited</b> to he who offered it” (Leviticus 7:18).

### Part 9
Evidently, the frontplate <b>bears only the sin of impurity</b> in the offering of an individual, <b>as</b> in some circumstances, impurity <b>was exempted from its general</b> prohibition on behalf <b>of the community.</b> It was permitted to sacrifice communal offerings in the Temple in a state of impurity. <b>What, does</b> this <b>not</b> apply to <b>impure blood</b> as well? Apparently, blood can also become impure. <b>Rav Pappa said: No,</b> the reference is not to impure blood but to <b>the impurity of handfuls</b> of flour separated by the priest from a meal-offering. The handful of flour renders the meal-offering permitted to be eaten by the priests, parallel to the blood of an animal offering.

### Part 10
The Gemara cites an additional proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was said to the prophet Haggai: “Thus said the Lord of Hosts: Ask now the priests with regard to the Torah, saying: <b>If a person bears hallowed flesh in the corner of his garment, and with his garment he touches bread, or stew, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it be sacred? And the priests answered and said: No”</b> (Haggai 2:11–12). This question is asked with regard to the flesh of a creeping animal and whether or not the substances that come into contact with it become impure.
