### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>How does one roast the Paschal lamb? One brings a spit [<i>shappud</i>] of pomegranate</b> wood <b>and thrusts it into the mouth</b> of the lamb <b>until</b> it reaches <b>its anus, and</b> one then <b>puts its legs and entrails inside it</b> and roasts it all together; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One does not insert its legs and entrails inside it, as <b>this is a type of cooking.</b> Anything placed inside the offering does not get roasted directly by the fire and is considered to have been cooked. <b>Rather, one suspends</b> the legs and entrails from the spit above the animal’s head <b>outside it. One</b> may <b>not roast the Paschal lamb on the</b> metal <b>spit nor on</b> a metal <b>grill [<i>askela</i>].</b> However, <b>Rabbi Tzadok said: There was an incident with Rabban Gamliel, who said to his slave Tavi: Go and roast the Paschal lamb for us on the grill.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let them bring a metal</b> spit. The Gemara answers: With regard to a metal utensil, <b>once part of it is hot, it is all hot, and</b> the meat is <b>roasted due to the</b> heat of the <b>spit. And the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that the Paschal lamb must be <b>roasted in fire and not roasted through something else.</b> The Gemara asks why it is necessary to use specifically a spit of pomegranate wood: <b>Let them bring</b> a spit <b>of palm</b> wood. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the palm branch <b>has grooves</b> between the leaves, <b>it gives off</b> a small amount of <b>water</b> from the grooves during roasting. The meat of the offering that touches the spit <b>is as though it is cooked.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let them bring</b> a spit <b>of fig</b> wood. The Gemara answers: <b>Since it is hollow</b> and has sap inside, <b>it gives off water, and it is as though</b> the meat <b>is cooked.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let them bring</b> a spit made <b>from an oak</b> or <b>from a carob</b> tree or <b>from a sycamore,</b> which are hard and do not have sap. The Gemara answers: With regard to each one of these trees, <b>since it has knots</b> and one must cut them off in order to smooth the branch, <b>it gives off water</b> from the locations of the cuts during roasting, and the meat is considered cooked.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: A branch <b>from a pomegranate</b> tree <b>also has knots.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Its knots are smooth.</b> There is no need to straighten the branch with a knife in order to use it, and therefore it does not emit water. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that the mishna is referring to <b>a branch</b> within its first <b>year, which does not</b> yet <b>have knots.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But there is the place it was cut</b> from the tree, and water will come from there. The Gemara answers: <b>One leaves the place it was cut outside</b> of the animal rather than inserting that side of the branch into the animal.

### Part 5
The Gemara notes that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Just as</b> the part of <b>a spit of wood</b> that is inside the animal <b>is not burned,</b> although it is over the fire, <b>so</b> the part of <b>a spit of metal</b> that is inside the animal <b>does not become burning hot.</b> There is no concern that the meat will be roasted from the heat of the spit. The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> This is not the case. With regard to <b>this,</b> the metal, when <b>part of it is hot, it is all hot. And</b> with regard to <b>that,</b> the wood, when <b>part of it is hot, not all of it is hot,</b> and therefore the meat is cooked by the heat of the fire and not by the heat of the spit.

### Part 6
It was taught in the mishna that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, <b>one places the legs</b> and entrails inside the lamb’s body and roasts them together. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> would <b>call</b> the Paschal lamb: <b><i>Tokh</i>, <i>tokh</i>,</b> because when one roasts the legs and entrails inside the lamb they make that sound, like other things that are cooked. <b>Rabbi Tarfon</b> would <b>call it: Helmeted kid.</b> In his opinion, the entrails must be roasted when they are suspended from the spit above the head of the animal, somewhat resembling a helmet.

### Part 7
<b>The Sages taught: Which is the kid roasted whole that it is prohibited to eat on the nights of Passover in modern times,</b> so as not appear as though one sacrificed the Paschal lamb outside the Temple? It is <b>any</b> kid <b>that one roasted all at once</b> in the manner that the Paschal lamb was roasted. However, if <b>one of its limbs is severed</b> or <b>one of its limbs is boiled, it is no</b> longer considered <b>a kid roasted whole.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara expresses surprise at the formulation of this <i>baraita</i>. <b>Now, one can say</b> that if <b>one of its limbs is severed, although one roasts it together with</b> the rest of the animal, <b>you said</b> that it is <b>no</b> longer considered a kid roasted whole, and it is permitted in modern times. If one of its limbs <b>is</b> severed and <b>boiled,</b> which is not an approved method of preparation of the Paschal lamb, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that that it is not considered roasted whole? <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where one boiled</b> the limb <b>while it was attached</b> to the rest of the animal. The <i>halakha</i> teaches that even if the animal remains whole, if one of its limbs is cooked it is no longer considered a kid roasted whole.

### Part 9
The Gemara raises a general halakhic discussion related to the mishna. <b>Rabba said: This stuffing</b> of raw meat inside another animal that is being roasted <b>is permitted,</b> even if the meat that is stuffed inside has not been salted to remove the blood. <b>Abaye said to him: But</b> the meat of the animal being roasted <b>absorbs blood</b> from the stuffing. <b>He said to him: As it absorbs it, so it</b> then <b>emits it.</b> The heat of the fire causes blood to be released from the meat used as stuffing into the meat of the animal being stuffed, and the heat then draws the blood out of that meat as well.

### Part 10
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that</b> this mishna <b>supports him: He places its legs and its entrails inside</b> the Paschal lamb and roasts them together. <b>What is the reason</b> that it is permitted to do this? Is it <b>not because we say: As it absorbs it, so it emits it?</b> Although Rabbi Akiva disputes this statement, his opinion is due to the unique <i>halakhot</i> of the Paschal lamb. It seems that everyone agrees that there is no concern about the prohibition against consuming blood. The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>Say it is different there,</b> in the case of the Paschal lamb. <b>Since there is the place of the slaughter, which is hollow</b> and open,
