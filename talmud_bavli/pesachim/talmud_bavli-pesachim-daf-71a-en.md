### Part 1
<b>at the time of rejoicing,</b> on the Festival itself, <b>and</b> if it was slaughtered on the fourteenth <b>it is not.</b> The mitzva to bring a <b>Festival peace-offering</b> is also not fulfilled, for <b>it is something that is an obligation,</b> as everyone is obligated to bring this offering, and the principle is that <b>anything that is an obligation must come only from that which is unconsecrated,</b> meaning that one cannot bring an obligatory offering from an animal that has already been consecrated for another purpose.

### Part 2
The Gemara proposes: <b>Let us say that</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>supports him.</b> The verse states: “Seven days shall you celebrate to the Lord your God in the place that the Lord shall choose, for the Lord your God shall bless you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands, and you shall be but joyous” (Deuteronomy 16:15). This verse seems superfluous, as it was already stated in the previous verse: “And you shall rejoice in your Festival.” The <i>baraita</i> expounds: <b>“And you shall be but joyous”</b> comes <b>to include the last night of the Festival.</b> Even then you must make sure there is <b>rejoicing</b> by eating the appropriate peace-offerings. The <i>baraita</i> considers: <b>Do you say</b> that the verse comes to include <b>the last night of the Festival? Or</b> perhaps <b>it</b> comes to include <b>only the first night of the Festival.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And you shall be <b>but joyous”;</b> the word “but” <b>restricts</b> this mitzva, meaning that there is not always a mitzva to be joyous.

### Part 3
The Gemara clarifies how this <i>baraita</i> supports Ulla: <b>What is the reason</b> that we learn from this expression that it is specifically on the first night that there is no mitzva of rejoicing? <b>Is it not because</b> on the first night <b>he has nothing with which to rejoice?</b> As Ulla said, one cannot fulfill the mitzva of rejoicing with a peace-offering that was slaughtered on the eve of the Festival, because it was not slaughtered at the time of rejoicing. On the last night of the Festival, on the other hand, one can rejoice with a peace-offering that was slaughtered the previous day, i.e., the last intermediate day of the Festival, which is also a time of rejoicing.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this support: <b>No,</b> it is not for this reason, but rather <b>for the reason taught</b> in the continuation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What did you see to include the last night of the Festival</b> in the mitzva of rejoicing <b>and to exclude the first night of the Festival,</b> a distinction that is not even hinted at in the verse? The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>I include the last night of the Festival</b> in the mitzva of rejoicing, <b>for there is rejoicing</b> on the days of the Festival <b>preceding it, and I exclude the first night of the Festival, for there is no</b> day of <b>rejoicing preceding it.</b> Thus, no support for Ulla can be deduced from the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yosef raised an objection</b> against the opinion of Ulla: It was taught in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to <b>the Festival peace-offering of the fourteenth</b> that <b>one fulfills with it</b> the mitzva to bring peace-offerings of <b>rejoicing, but one does not fulfill with it</b> the mitzva to bring a <b>Festival peace-offering.</b> We can ask, <b>why?</b> Surely, according to Ulla, <b>we require</b> that the <b>slaughter</b> be performed <b>at a time of rejoicing, and</b> this requirement <b>is not</b> fulfilled in this case. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Idi bar Avin said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring here to a case <b>where he delayed and slaughtered it</b> only on the fifteenth, i.e., on the Festival, which is a time of rejoicing.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ashi said: So too, it is reasonable</b> to understand the <i>baraita</i> in this manner, <b>for if you do not say so,</b> but rather that the Festival peace-offering was slaughtered on the fourteenth, there is a difficulty, for <b>who taught this <i>baraita</i>?</b> Is it not <b>ben Teima</b> who taught it? According to <b>ben Teima,</b> however, <b>he has disqualified it by leaving it overnight,</b> for in his view this Festival peace-offering is similar to a Paschal lamb and may not be eaten the following day. <b>Learn from this</b> that the <i>baraita</i> must be referring to a case where the Festival peace-offering was slaughtered not on the fourteenth, but on the fifteenth.

### Part 7
<b>Rava raised an objection</b> against the opinion of Ulla: It was taught in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>the <i>hallel</i></b> is recited <b>and</b> the mitzva of <b>rejoicing</b> with the peace-offerings of rejoicing is observed on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> for <b>eight</b> days. Now <b>if you say we require</b> that the <b>slaughter</b> be performed <b>at a time of rejoicing, many times you find</b> that the mitzva of rejoicing is observed for <b>only seven</b> days, <b>such as when the first day of the Festival occurs on Shabbat,</b> when a peace-offering of rejoicing may not be slaughtered. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehuda, said: One rejoices with the male goats of the Festivals.</b> That is to say, in such a situation the mitzva of rejoicing can be fulfilled with the meat of the goats that are brought on the Festivals as sin-offerings, as these offerings, being communal offerings, may be slaughtered even on Shabbat.

### Part 8
<b>Rava said: There are two</b> possible <b>responses to</b> refute <b>this. One</b> is <b>that the male goats of the Festivals are eaten raw</b> and <b>are not eaten roasted.</b> Being a non-essential part of the service, roasting the meat is forbidden on Shabbat. Therefore, the meat can be eaten only raw, <b>and there is no rejoicing with raw</b> meat. <b>And furthermore,</b> only <b>the priests eat</b> of the meat of these sin-offerings. <b>With what</b> then <b>do</b> ordinary <b>Israelites rejoice? Rather, Rav Pappa said:</b> In such a situation, <b>one rejoices with clean clothes and old wine.</b>

### Part 9
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he related a different version of what <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> With regard to <b>peace-offerings that one slaughtered on the eve of the Festival, one fulfills with them</b> the mitzva to bring peace-offerings of <b>rejoicing, but one does not fulfill with them</b> the mitzva to bring a <b>Festival peace-offering.</b> He explains: <b>One fulfills</b> the mitzva of <b>rejoicing,</b> because <b>we do not require</b> that the <b>slaughter</b> be performed <b>at the time of rejoicing</b> as long as the offering is eaten at the time of rejoicing. <b>But one does not</b> fulfill the mitzva of the <b>Festival peace-offering,</b> because the Festival peace-offering is <b>something that is an obligation, and</b> the principle is that <b>anything that is an obligation must come only from unconsecrated</b> animals.

### Part 10
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against Ravin from the <i>baraita</i> that was taught above: <b>“And you shall be but joyous”</b> comes <b>to include the last night of the Festival</b> in the mitzva of <b>rejoicing.</b> The <i>baraita</i> considers: <b>Do you say</b> that the verse comes <b>to include the last night</b> in the mitzva of rejoicing? <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it</b> comes <b>to include only the first night of the Festival?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And you shall be <b>but</b> joyous”; the word <b>“but” restricts</b> this mitzva, meaning that there is not always a mitzva to be joyous.

### Part 11
The Gemara explains how this <i>baraita</i> is difficult according to Ravin: <b>What is the reason</b> that we learn from here that it is specifically on the first night that there is no mitzva of rejoicing? <b>Is it not because</b> on the first night <b>he has nothing with which to rejoice,</b> as one cannot fulfill the mitzva of rejoicing with peace-offerings slaughtered not at a time of rejoicing? The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> the reason is <b>as it was taught</b> in the continuation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What did you see to include the last night of the Festival</b> in the mitzva of rejoicing <b>and to exclude the first night of the Festival?</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>I include the last night of the Festival, for there is rejoicing</b> on the days of the Festival <b>preceding it, and I exclude the first night of the Festival, for there is no</b> day of <b>rejoicing preceding it.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Kahana said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the sacrificial parts of the Festival peace-offering of the fifteenth</b> of Nisan, i.e., those portions of the offering that are consumed on the altar, <b>are disqualified when left overnight</b> on the first night after the offering is slaughtered, despite the fact that the meat of the offering may be consumed for an additional day? <b>As it is stated:</b> “You shall not offer the blood of My offering with leaven; <b>neither shall the fat of my Festival offering be left over until morning”</b> (Exodus 23:18), <b>and, juxtaposed with it</b> is the word <b>first,</b> in the verse: “The first of the first fruits of your land you shall bring to the house of the Lord your God” (Exodus 23:19). This comes <b>to say</b> to us <b>that the morning</b> mentioned in the first verse is the <b>first morning</b> after the offering has been sacrificed.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Yosef strongly objects to this</b> proof: <b>The reason is that it wrote</b> the word <b>first. But had it not written</b> the word <b>first, I would have said: What is</b> the meaning of the term <b>morning? The second morning</b> after it was sacrificed. This raises a question: <b>Is there anything</b> like this <b>where the meat</b> of an offering that is to be eaten <b>is disqualified</b> already <b>from the evening,</b> as the meat of a Festival peace-offering may be eaten only for two days and the night between them, <b>while the sacrificial parts</b> to be consumed on the altar are permitted <b>until the</b> next <b>morning?</b>

### Part 14
<b>Abaye said to him: Why not? For</b> there is <b>the Paschal offering according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya,</b> who holds <b>that the meat</b> that is to be eaten <b>is disqualified</b> already <b>from midnight</b> and may no longer be eaten after that time, <b>while the sacrificial parts</b> to be consumed on the altar may be offered <b>until morning.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rava said: This is what was difficult to Rav Yosef: Is there anything</b> like this, i.e., <b>that the <i>tanna</i> does not need</b> the word <b>“first”</b> to teach us that the word “morning,” written <b>with regard to the meat</b> of an offering, is referring to the first morning, <b>whereas Rav Kahana requires</b> the word <b>“first”</b> to teach us that the word “morning,” written <b>with regard to the sacrificial portions</b> to be consumed on the altar, is referring to the first morning? This is despite the fact that the latter, owing to their greater sanctity, are obviously more easily disqualified than the former.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this source alluded to by Rava? The Gemara explains: <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Nor shall any of the meat that you sacrifice on the first day at evening remain overnight until the morning”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:4),
