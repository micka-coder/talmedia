is made <b>from refined flour; fatty meat</b> refers to meat <b>from a goat that has not</b> yet <b>given birth; and aged wine</b> refers to wine that has been <b>aged significantly,</b> for at least three years.

### Part 2
The Gemara states a general principle: <b>Any</b> food or medical treatment <b>that is effective in</b> healing <b>this</b> sickness or this limb <b>is deleterious for that</b> one. <b>And</b> any food or treatment <b>that is deleterious for this</b> one <b>is effective</b> in healing <b>that</b> one, <b>except for moist ginger, long peppers, and bread</b> made of <b>refined</b> flour, <b>and fatty meat, and aged wine, which are effective to heal all</b> limbs <b>of the body.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara returns to its discussion of the details mentioned in the mishna. Why is <b>Median beer</b> prohibited during Passover? It is because the Medians <b>place barley water into it.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And Edomite vinegar</b> is prohibited because the Edomites <b>place barley into it.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Initially,</b> when the Temple stood <b>and they would bring</b> wine <b>libations from Judea,</b> the wine would be blessed and would be preserved without any additives. <b>The wine of Judea would not turn to vinegar unless they placed barley into it</b> to achieve this effect. <b>And they would call</b> this vinegar to which barley had been added <b>ordinary vinegar,</b> since wine would not become vinegar without this additive.

### Part 6
<b>And now,</b> after the destruction of the Temple, <b>Edomite wine does not turn to vinegar unless one places barley into it. This is called Edomite vinegar, to fulfill that which is stated</b> with regard to Tyre, and the same applies to other enemies of the Jewish people: “Because Tyre has said against Jerusalem: Aha, she is broken that was the gate of the peoples; she is turned unto me; <b>I shall be filled with her that is laid waste”</b> (Ezekiel 26:2). The Sages expound: <b>If this one,</b> Jerusalem, <b>is full,</b> then <b>that one,</b> her enemy, <b>is laid waste; and if this</b> enemy <b>is full,</b> then <b>she,</b> Jerusalem, <b>is laid waste.</b> Therefore, when the Jewish people fall, their enemies can achieve the success that was once attained by the Jews. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This notion can be derived <b>from here,</b> where the verse states regarding Esau and Jacob: <b>“The one people shall be stronger than the other people”</b> (Genesis 25:23), meaning that when one nation gains power, the other is weakened, because they cannot both be strong at the same time.

### Part 7
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: In Judea, initially, one who would purchase vinegar from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>,</b> i.e., one who is not scrupulous in matters of ritual purity and tithes and is therefore suspect of not having tithed his fruit properly, would <b>not need to tithe it due to</b> the fact that <b>it can be assumed</b> that ordinary vinegar <b>was made only from <i>temed</i>,</b> a liquid produced from grape remnants. After filtering the wine from the stems, seeds, and skins, water was poured over these remnants. The liquid was then drained off and allowed to ferment until it became vinegar. This liquid was called <i>temed</i>, and it is not necessary to tithe it. Vinegar was produced in this way because the wine of that time was so strong that it did not turn to vinegar on its own. <b>But now, one who purchases vinegar from an <i>am ha’aretz</i> must tithe it,</b> as the wine nowadays turns to vinegar quickly, <b>and the presumption is</b> that vinegar <b>comes only from wine.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Yehuda hold that <i>temed</i> is not subject to tithing? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>one who produces <i>temed</i> and adds a measured</b> amount <b>of water and</b> afterward <b>finds a corresponding</b> amount of liquid to that which <b>he measured, he is exempt</b> from tithing this <i>temed</i> because it is clear that the grape produce added only flavor and did not add to the volume of the <i>temed</i>. And <b>Rabbi Yehuda obligates</b> one to tithe the <i>temed</i> even in that case. If this is so, how can Rabbi Yehuda permit a person to purchase <i>temed</i> from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>? According to his opinion in this <i>baraita</i>, <i>temed</i> must be tithed.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> what Rabbi Yehuda <b>is saying:</b> One is required to tithe <i>temed</i>; however, <b><i>amei ha’aretz</i> are not suspected</b> of failing to tithe <b><i>temed</i>.</b> Because <i>temed</i> is so inexpensive, the assumption is that <i>amei ha’aretz</i> are not sparing with it and are willing to tithe it. <b>If you wish, say</b> instead that even if <i>amei ha’aretz</i> <b>are suspected</b> of failing to tithe <i>temed</i>, <b>and</b> this is <b>not difficult</b> for the following reason: <b>This</b> mishna is referring to a case where the <i>temed</i> was produced <b>with dregs</b> that contain some amount of wine, and therefore Rabbi Yehuda says that a person is required to tithe it. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the <i>temed</i> was produced <b>with grape pits; because</b> it is assumed that no wine is mixed into the <i>temed</i>, Rabbi Yehuda states that one is exempt from tithing it.

### Part 10
It is stated in the mishna that <b>Egyptian <i>zitom</i></b> is considered leavened food. The Gemara asks: <b>What is Egyptian <i>zitom</i>?</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rav Yosef taught</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: It is <b>one-third barley, one-third safflower, and one-third salt.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Pappa removes barley</b> from the list of ingredients <b>and includes wheat;</b> he maintains that Egyptian <i>zitom</i> was made with wheat rather than barley. The Gemara comments: <b>Your mnemonic</b> to remember which Sage expressed which version is the word <b><i>sisanei</i>,</b> meaning a twig basket. <i>Sisanei</i> contains the letter <i>samekh</i> twice, which can help one remember that Rav Yosef, whose name contains a <i>samekh</i>, says that Egyptian <i>zitom</i> is made from <i>se’orim</i>, barley, a word that contains the letter <i>sin</i>, which makes the same sound as <i>samekh</i>.

### Part 13
The Gemara describes how Egyptian <i>zitom</i> is prepared: Those who prepare it <b>soak</b> the ingredients together, <b>and</b> then they <b>roast them and grind them</b> together. <b>They drink</b> the mixture <b>from Passover to <i>Shavuot</i>.</b> This drink <b>relaxes</b> the bowels of one who is <b>constipated, and it constipates</b> one whose bowel movements are <b>loose.</b> However, <b>it is dangerous for a sick person or a pregnant woman</b> to drink this mixture.

### Part 14
It was taught in the mishna that <b>dyers’ broth</b> is considered leavened. The Gemara explains: <b>Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they interpreted</b> that this is <b>bran water [<i>maya deḥivri</i>] that</b> people <b>use to dye leather.</b>

### Part 15
It was further stated in the mishna that <b>bakers’ well-worked dough</b> is also considered leavened. The Gemara explains the nature of this substance: It is <b>bread made from grain that was</b> harvested before it was <b>one-third</b> ripe and then made into a loaf. This loaf was placed <b>on top of a pot to draw out the filth</b> from the broth.

### Part 16
It was further taught in the mishna that the <i>kolan</i> of <i>soferim</i>, <b>kolan of soferim,</b> is considered leavened. The Gemara explains: <b>Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they interpreted that</b> this expression is referring to <b>shoemakers’ glue</b> that is made from flour.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Shimi from Ḥozna’a said: This is the</b> depilatory <b>paste of the daughters of the wealthy, of which they would leave a remnant for the daughters of the poor.</b> It was the common practice for women to remove hair from different parts of their bodies by applying various pastes, some of which contained flour. The <i>kolan</i> of <i>soferim</i> mentioned in the mishna was such a substance. It was given this name because wealthy young women would give the paste [<i>kolan</i>] to poor young women whose fathers were schoolteachers [<i>soferim</i>], so that the poor women could utilize it as well.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach</b> a mnemonic by noting that the mishna lists <b>four items</b> that are used by the ordinary people <b>of the state,</b> i.e., <i>kutaḥ</i>, beer, vinegar, and <i>zitom</i>, <b>and three items of artisans,</b> i.e., dyers’ broth, kolan of soferim, and bakers’ well-worked dough? <b>And if you say</b> that kolan of soferim is <b>the</b> depilatory <b>paste of the daughters of the wealthy,</b> then <b>what artisanship is there in that?</b> According to this interpretation, that substance does not belong on the list of artisans’ items.

### Part 19
The Gemara answers with another question: <b>Rather what,</b> will you say that this is referring to <b>shoemakers’ glue?</b> If so, <b>why did</b> the authors of the mishna <b>call it bookmakers’ glue [<i>kolan shel soferim</i>]? It should</b> have been called <b>shoemakers’ glue [<i>kolan shel ratzanin</i>]. Rav Oshaya said: Actually,</b> one should explain that <i>kolan</i> is referring to <b>shoemakers’ glue; and why is it called bookmakers’ glue?</b> The reason is that <b>bookmakers also use it to attach their pages.</b> During the time of the mishna, this paste was referred to as bookmakers’ glue.

### Part 20
It is stated in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>women’s adornments are also</b> prohibited as leavened food. The Gemara asks: <b>Could it enter your mind</b> to say <b>that adornments</b> made from silver, gold, or woven materials contain leaven? <b>Rather, say</b> instead that this means: <b>Even women’s cosmetics</b> or other items used by women to enhance their skin are prohibited if they contain leavened ingredients. <b>As Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: With regard to the Jewish women</b>
