### Part 1
Dough made from <b>five-quarters</b> of a <b><i>log</i></b> of <b>flour and</b> a bit <b>more obligates</b> one to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i>?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>this is</b> what Rav <b>is saying: A <i>kav</i> from Melogna is the same measure as this,</b> as it is not a regular <i>kav</i> but a larger measure, identical to the amount from which one is required to separate <i>ḥalla</i>.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yosef said: These women of our</b> family <b>ordinarily bake <i>kefiza</i></b> by <b><i>kefiza</i>,</b> i.e., three-quarters of a <i>log</i> at a time, <b>on Passover,</b> since it is easier to prevent small quantities of dough from becoming leavened. <b>Abaye said to him: What is your opinion?</b> Do you tell them to do this in order to be <b>stringent? That</b> is <b>a stringency that leads to a leniency, as</b> by working with small quantities <b>one removes</b> the dough <b>from</b> the obligation to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i>.</b>

### Part 3
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: They do</b> separate <i>ḥalla</i> from the dough, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One who removes</b> loaves of bread from an oven <b>and places them in a basket, the basket combines them to</b> reach the quantity from which one is required to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> even if each of the loaves would not attain the necessary measure for separating <i>ḥalla</i> on their own. <b>And Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b> Therefore, the women of Rav Yosef’s household would put all the finished <i>matzot</i> into a basket and separate <i>ḥalla</i> from them.

### Part 4
Abaye <b>said to him: But wasn’t it stated with regard to</b> that <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: They taught</b> that a basket combines the loaves <b>only</b> with regard to <b>Babylonian loaves that bite from one another.</b> In other words, the loaves are slightly attached, and when one separates them, a bit from one loaf comes off with the other loaf. <b>However,</b> it does <b>not</b> apply <b>to</b> long, <b>rod-like loaves</b> [<b><i>ke’akhin</i></b>] that were baked separately. Therefore, that principle cannot be applied to the case discussed here, in which each batch of <i>matza</i> was baked on its own. Rav Yosef answered: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to</b> that <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer <b>even with regard to</b> long, <b>rod-like loaves?</b> This indicates that Rav Yosef accepted the view of Rabbi Ḥanina.

### Part 5
In light of this discussion, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a board without a rim [<i>levizbezin</i>], what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered to be a vessel that combines loaves baked separately into one unit with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>? <b>Do we require the inside of the vessel</b> in order to combine the loaves, <b>and that is lacking,</b> since the board is flat rather than concave? <b>Or perhaps we require the airspace of the vessel, and that is</b> present in this case? The Gemara concludes: <b>Let it stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 6
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: A basket combines</b> different loaves placed in it with regard to the obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: An oven combines them. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Babylonian loaves that bite from one another are combined;</b> however, if the loaves are connected to any lesser degree, e.g., if they are together in an oven or basket, they are not considered combined for the purpose of separating <i>ḥalla</i>.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabban Gamliel says: Three women may knead</b> their dough <b>as one,</b> meaning at one time, <b>and bake</b> the batches of dough <b>in one oven, one after the other,</b> and they need not be concerned that their dough will become leavened while they are waiting to use the oven.

### Part 8
<b>And the Rabbis say: Three women</b> may be <b>engaged</b> in preparing <b>dough as one,</b> in the following manner: <b>One kneads</b> her dough as another <b>one arranges</b> her own dough so it takes the form of <i>matza</i>, while another <b>one bakes</b> her dough.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Akiva says: Not all women, not all wood, and not all ovens are the same,</b> and therefore no set rules should be established. Rather, <b>this is the principle:</b> If the dough begins to <b>rise, she</b> should <b>spread cold</b> water in which she immersed her hands, onto the dough, in order to stop the leavening process.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the woman who <b>kneads</b> first completes her kneading, <b>she arranges</b> her dough <b>and another</b> woman <b>kneads in her place.</b> When the first woman finishes <b>arranging</b> her dough, <b>she bakes and another</b> woman <b>arranges</b> her dough <b>in her place, and the third</b> woman <b>kneads</b> her dough. When the first woman finishes <b>baking, she kneads</b> the dough for her next batch, <b>and another</b> woman <b>bakes in her place, and the third</b> woman <b>arranges</b> her dough, <b>and they continue in turn. As long as they are engaged</b> in handling <b>the dough, it will not become leavened.</b>

### Part 11
It was taught in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that <b>not all women,</b> not all wood, and not all ovens are the same. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva said: I deliberated</b> this matter <b>before Rabban Gamliel,</b> asking: <b>May our master teach us</b> if your statement, cited in the mishna, was said <b>with regard to diligent women or women who are not diligent?</b> Was it said <b>with regard to</b> an oven fueled with <b>moist wood or dry wood?</b> Was it said <b>with regard to a hot oven or a cold oven?</b> Rabban Gamliel himself <b>said to me: You have only what the Sages taught,</b> which is that <b>this is the principle:</b> If the dough begins to <b>rise</b> such that there is a concern that it may become leavened, <b>she should spread cold</b> water <b>onto</b> the dough to prevent it from becoming leavened.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Dough at the beginning of the leavening process [<b><i>siur</i></b>], must <b>be burned, but one who eats it is exempt</b> from the punishment of <i>karet</i> because the dough had not become fully leavened. Dough that has reached the stage of <b>cracking</b> must <b>be burned, and one who eats it</b> intentionally <b>is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>,</b> as he has intentionally eaten leavened bread during Passover.

### Part 13
<b>What is</b> considered <b><i>siur</i>?</b> Dough that has been leavened to the point that it has cracks that look <b>like the antennae of locusts.</b> The stage of <b>cracking</b> occurs later in the leavening process, <b>when the cracks intermingle.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say: One who</b> intentionally <b>eats</b> either <b>this or that,</b> dough with cracks like locust antennae or with cracks that have become intermingled, <b>is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>,</b> as once dough begins to crack it has certainly become leavened. <b>And what is <i>siur</i>?</b> It is any dough <b>whose surface has becomes pale</b> like the face of <b>a person whose hair stands</b> on end due to fear.

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: What is <i>siur</i>?</b> It is <b>any</b> dough <b>whose surface has become pale</b> like the face of <b>a person whose hair stands</b> on end due to fear. <b>Cracking</b> is considered to have occurred when cracks <b>like the antennae of locusts</b> appear. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: What is <i>siur</i>?</b> It is when the dough forms cracks <b>like the antennae of locusts,</b> and <b>cracking</b> is <b>when the cracks intermingle. And one who</b> intentionally <b>eats</b> either <b>this or that is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b><i>siur</i> must be burned but</b> that <b>one who eats it is exempt</b> from <i>karet</i>; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The opinion attributed to the Rabbis in the <i>baraita</i> appears to be the same as that which is attributed to Rabbi Yehuda in the mishna, but according to Rabbi Yehuda, one who eats <i>siur</i> is exempt from <i>karet</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should be understood in the following manner: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> whose opinion was mentioned previously, <b>one who</b> intentionally <b>eats</b> either <b>this or that is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>,</b> whereas according to the Rabbis he is exempt.

### Part 16
<b>Rava said: What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir?</b> It is that <b>there is no crack above that does not have several cracks below.</b> Therefore, even if only one small crack appears on the surface, it is a sign that the inside of the dough is filled with cracks and has become leavened.
