### Part 1
<b>And what</b> did Rabbi Meir mean when he said: <b>From their statements?</b> He meant: <b>From the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina the deputy High Priest.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Reish Lakish said</b> another explanation of the mishna <b>in the name of bar Kappara: The</b> case in the <b>mishna</b> is one involving <b>a primary source of ritual impurity by Torah law and a secondary source of impurity by Torah law. And what</b> did Rabbi Meir mean by the phrase: <b>From their statements?</b> He was not referring to the <i>tanna’im</i> in this mishna, but rather: <b>From the statements of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua</b> cited elsewhere.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: To <b>which</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua</b> is Rabbi Meir referring? <b>If you say</b> he is referring to <b>this</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, as we learned</b> in a mishna: In the case of <b>a barrel of <i>teruma</i></b> produce <b>with regard to which uncertainty developed</b> with regard to its <b>impurity,</b> and which therefore may not be eaten, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that one must nevertheless safeguard the <i>teruma</i> from ritual impurity. Therefore, he maintains: <b>If</b> the barrel <b>was resting in a vulnerable place,</b> where it may come into contact with impurity, <b>one</b> should <b>place it in a concealed place, and if it was exposed, he</b> should <b>cover it.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> That is not necessary. Rather, even <b>if it was placed in a concealed place,</b> he may <b>place it in a vulnerable place</b> if he chooses. <b>And if it was covered, he</b> may <b>expose it,</b> as he need no longer safeguard this <i>teruma</i> from impurity. According to Rabbi Yehoshua, as <i>teruma</i> whose impurity status is uncertain, may be used only for lighting a fire, there is no requirement to prevent it from contact with ritual impurity. The same reasoning applies to pure leaven: One is not required to safeguard it from impurity in the process of its removal.

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects the comparison: <b>Is</b> this dispute with regard to the placement of doubtfully impure <i>teruma</i> <b>comparable</b> to the case of burning ritually pure and impure items together? <b>There,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua permits <b>mere</b> passive <b>causation</b> of impurity; however, he does not permit one to actively render <i>teruma</i> whose impurity status is uncertain, impure. <b>Here,</b> however, in the statement of Rabbi Meir, he actively renders leavened <i>teruma</i> <b>impure with</b> his <b>hands.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Meir did not infer his opinion from that statement; instead, he inferred it from <b>this</b> other statement of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua. As we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>a barrel of <i>teruma</i></b> wine <b>that broke in the upper</b> area of a <b>winepress,</b> where grapes are pressed, <b>and</b> there is <b>impure, non-sacred</b> wine in the <b>lower</b> area of the press, where the wine flows from the upper area, the following dilemma arises: If the <i>teruma</i> wine flows into the non-sacred wine, the <i>teruma</i> will be rendered ritually impure. The result will be significant financial loss, as the legal status of all the wine in the lower press will be that of impure <i>teruma</i>, which is prohibited even for priests to drink.

### Part 7
In that case, <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua concede that if one is able to rescue</b> even <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>from</b> the barrel that broke by receiving the <i>teruma</i> wine in a vessel before it becomes impure, and thereby keep the wine <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual purity, he</b> should <b>rescue</b> it. <b>And</b> if <b>one cannot</b> receive the wine in a pure vessel, as only impure vessels are available, such that if he uses them to receive the wine or to seal the upper press he will render the <i>teruma</i> impure, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The <i>teruma</i> wine should be allowed to <b>descend and become impure</b> on its own, <b>but one</b> should <b>not</b> actively <b>render it impure with</b> his <b>hand. Rabbi Yehoshua says: One</b> may <b>even render it impure with</b> his <b>hand.</b> Since it will become impure on its own regardless of his actions, there is no objection to rendering the <i>teruma</i> impure preemptively in order to prevent greater financial loss. Apparently, according to Rabbi Yehoshua, it is permitted to render an item impure if it will be lost in any case.

### Part 8
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> that Rabbi Meir is referring to the above dispute, <b>this</b> expression: <b>From their statements,</b> is imprecise, as his ruling is not based on Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion at all. Instead, Rabbi Meir <b>should have</b> said: <b>From his statement,</b> as he learns his ruling solely from the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers that <b>this is</b> what Rabbi Meir <b>is saying: We learned</b> this ruling <b>from the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua.</b> Since the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua, this is a substantive source. The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as</b> the continuation of the mishna <b>teaches: Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua concede.</b> This indicates that Rabbi Meir is referring to their opinions. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that this is the correct interpretation of Rabbi Meir’s statement.

### Part 10
<b>And likewise, Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: The</b> case in the <b>mishna</b> is one involving <b>a primary source of ritual impurity by Torah law and a secondary source of impurity by Torah law. And what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>From their statements?</b> It means <b>from the statements</b> of <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua</b> in the dispute cited above.

### Part 11
<b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i> that elaborates on the mishna. <b>Rabbi Yosei said</b> to Rabbi Meir: <b>The</b> inferred <b>conclusion</b> of burning pure and impure leaven together <b>is not similar to the</b> case from which you cited <b>proof. When the Sages testified, about what did they testify? If</b> your source is the testimony of Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy High Priest, he testified <b>about the meat that became ritually impure through</b> contact with <b>a secondary source of impurity,</b> saying <b>that one</b> may <b>burn it</b> together <b>with the meat that became impure through</b> contact with <b>a primary source of impurity.</b> In that case, <b>this</b> meat <b>is impure and that</b> meat <b>is</b> similarly <b>impure.</b>

### Part 12
<b>If</b> your source is the testimony of Rabbi Akiva, he testified <b>about</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>oil that was</b> ritually <b>disqualified by</b> coming into contact with <b>one who immersed himself during that day,</b> saying <b>that one may kindle it in a lamp that became ritually impure</b> with first-degree impurity <b>through</b> contact with one who became <b>ritually impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>a corpse.</b> That is a case where <b>this</b> oil <b>is disqualified and that</b> lamp <b>is impure. We also concede with regard to <i>teruma</i> that became impure through</b> contact with <b>a secondary source of impurity that one</b> may <b>burn it with <i>teruma</i> that became impure through</b> contact with <b>a primary source of impurity.</b>

### Part 13
<b>However, how will we burn</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>in abeyance,</b> whose impurity status is uncertain, together <b>with ritually impure</b> <i>teruma</i>? <b>Perhaps Elijah</b> the Prophet <b>will come</b> and establish prophetically that the <i>teruma</i> is not ritually impure, <b>and he will render it ritually pure.</b> The legal status of <i>teruma</i> in abeyance is uncertain. How can one actively render it impure when it might ultimately be determined that it is pure?
