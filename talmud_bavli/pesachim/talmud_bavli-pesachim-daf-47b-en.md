### Part 1
<b>And</b> he is plowing during the <b>Sabbatical</b> year, when agricultural labor is prohibited, <b>on a Festival.</b> Additionally, the person plowing is <b>a priest and a nazirite,</b> and he is plowing <b>a place of ritual impurity,</b> i.e., a burial site. It is prohibited for a priest and a nazirite to become impure by walking over the burial spot of a corpse. Therefore, the one plowing commits two transgressions simply by traversing the field. <b>And if we say</b> the principle: <b>Since, etc., he should not be liable for plowing</b> on a Festival, <b>since</b> the dirt he loosens <b>is fit for covering the blood of a bird.</b> One who slaughters a bird or a non-domesticated animal is required by Torah law to cover the blood. Since it is possible that one will need to slaughter many such animals or birds and will not have enough dirt to cover their blood, his plowing may end up facilitating covering the blood. Therefore, it should not be considered a prohibited labor on the Festival.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Pappa bar Shmuel said:</b> The case is one in which a person plowed <b>sharp stones,</b> i.e., clods of dirt that have hardened and are unfit to be used to cover blood.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: Aren’t these clods of dirt <b>fit</b> to be <b>crushed</b> and used to cover blood? The Gemara responds: <b>Is crushing permitted on a Festival?</b> The Gemara counters: But they are <b>fit to be crushed in an unusual manner,</b> which is not prohibited by Torah law. The Gemara answers: The case is one in which a person plowed <b>hard,</b> rocky <b>soil,</b> which cannot be crushed.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>Is hard soil fit for planting?</b> The case under discussion is one in which a person was preparing the ground in order to plant food crops in a vineyard. The Gemara answers: In this case, <b>there was hard soil above and</b> fertile, <b>loose soil underneath,</b> into which seeds could be planted. The Gemara rejects this answer: <b>Derive</b> that the act of plowing would be permitted in that case <b>due to</b> the <b>loose soil,</b> which is suitable for covering blood.

### Part 5
<b>Rather, Mar bar Rav Ashi said:</b> The case is one in which a person plowed <b>mud,</b> which is not fit for covering blood. The Gemara asks rhetorically: <b>Is mud fit for planting?</b> The Gemara answers: The case is one in which a person plowed <b>moist earth,</b> which is suitable for planting but which cannot be used to cover blood.

### Part 6
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rabba’s acceptance of the principle: Since, etc. <b>One who cooks the sciatic nerve in milk on a Festival and eats it is flogged</b> for <b>five</b> distinct prohibitions. How so? <b>He is flogged due to</b> the prohibition of <b>cooking the</b> sciatic <b>nerve on a Festival,</b> which is prohibited because the sciatic nerve is unfit for consumption; <b>and he is flogged due to</b> the prohibition of <b>eating</b> the sciatic <b>nerve,</b> which is explicitly prohibited by the Torah; <b>and he is flogged due to</b> the prohibition of <b>cooking meat in milk; and he is flogged due to</b> the prohibition of <b>eating meat</b> cooked <b>in milk; and</b> lastly, <b>he is flogged due to</b> the prohibition of <b>kindling</b> a fire unnecessarily on a Festival. <b>And if we say</b> the principle: <b>Since, etc., he should not be liable for kindling</b> a fire unnecessarily, <b>since</b> the fire <b>is fit for</b> use in attending to his legitimate Festival needs, e.g., cooking permitted foods.

### Part 7
Rabba <b>said to him: Remove</b> the prohibition of <b>kindling</b> a fire from this list <b>and add</b> the prohibition of eating <b>a sciatic nerve from an animal carcass</b> that was not properly slaughtered.

### Part 8
Abaye responded: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach</b> with regard to this mishna: He <b>is flogged twice for his eating,</b> as he violated the prohibitions of eating the sciatic nerve and eating meat cooked in milk, <b>and three</b> times <b>for his cooking,</b> as he violated the prohibitions of kindling a fire, cooking on a Festival, and cooking meat in milk? <b>And if it is</b> so, that the case is one in which the sciatic nerve was taken from an animal carcass, Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>should have</b> stated that he is flogged <b>three</b> times <b>for his eating,</b> as he violated the prohibitions of eating a sciatic nerve, eating meat cooked in milk, and eating an animal carcass.

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> Rabba said: <b>Remove</b> the prohibition of <b>kindling</b> a fire <b>and add</b> in its place the prohibition of using <b>wood</b> that has been <b>set aside</b> from use on the Festival.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: Is the prohibition against utilizing <b>set-aside</b> material prohibited <b>by Torah</b> law, such that a person is flogged for violating this prohibition? <b>He said to him: Yes, as it is written: “And it shall come to pass on the sixth day that they shall prepare that which they bring in”</b> (Exodus 16:5). This verse teaches that anything that has not been prepared before the Festival is considered to be set-aside, and it is prohibited to utilize it. This verse indicates that utilizing set-aside objects is prohibited; however, it does not formulate this prohibition as a negative commandment. Therefore, the Gemara adds that <b>the warning</b> indicating that it is a negative commandment <b>is from here: “You shall not perform any labor”</b> (Exodus 20:10). This general statement pertaining to Shabbat includes utilizing objects that were not set aside for use before Shabbat.

### Part 11
Abaye <b>said to him: Wasn’t it you who said: I raised a dilemma before Rav Ḥisda, and some say</b> the correct version is: <b>I raised a dilemma before Rav Huna:</b> If <b>one brought a lamb from the meadow,</b> and the lamb is therefore set-aside because it was not designated for use before the Festival, <b>and he slaughtered it</b> as the <b>daily</b> offering <b>on a Festival, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it permissible to offer this sacrifice?

### Part 12
<b>And you said to us: He said to me about this</b> issue that the answer can be derived from a verse in Ezekiel pertaining to communal offerings. The verse states: “And one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered pastures of Israel” (Ezekiel 45:15). This verse is expounded in the following manner: The word <b>lamb</b> is referring to either a male or female lamb, <b>but not to a firstborn,</b> as that status applies only to male sheep.

### Part 13
The word <b>one</b> indicates that a sacrifice may <b>not</b> be brought from the animal <b>tithe.</b> The lamb must be one that can stand alone. An animal designated as tithe is always part of a group, as it is the tenth animal to leave the pen; therefore, it cannot be offered as a communal offering.

### Part 14
The expression: <b>Of the flock</b> indicates that only some animals of the flock may be offered, whereas one may <b>not</b> offer <b>a <i>palges</i>,</b> which is no longer a lamb but is not yet considered a ram.
