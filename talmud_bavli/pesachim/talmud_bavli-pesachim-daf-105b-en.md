### Part 1
<b>the sanctification of the day,</b> i.e., <i>kiddush</i> at night, at the beginning of Shabbat, <b>because the sanctification of the day takes precedence over the honor of the day and the honor of the night. And if it is so,</b> that one who fails to recite <i>kiddush</i> at night may do so at any time during the day, <b>let him leave over</b> the cup of wine <b>until the following day and use it for two</b> mitzvot, as he can recite <i>kiddush</i> during the day and simultaneously honor the Shabbat day by drinking wine. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>said to him: A mitzva is beloved in its</b> proper <b>time.</b>

### Part 2
Ravina objected to this answer: <b>And do we say</b> that <b>a mitzva is beloved in its</b> proper <b>time? But wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who enters his home at the conclusion of Shabbat recites the blessing over the wine, and</b> then <b>over the light, and</b> then <b>over the spices, and recites <i>havdala</i> thereafter over the cup</b> of wine. <b>And if he has only one cup</b> of wine, <b>he leaves it for after</b> he eats his <b>food,</b> and uses it for Grace after Meals, <b>and arranges all of the</b> other blessings together <b>thereafter.</b> This <i>baraita</i> indicates that <b>we do not say</b> that <b>a mitzva is beloved in its</b> proper <b>time,</b> as one does not have to recite <i>havdala</i> immediately, i.e., before partaking of his meal.

### Part 3
<b>He said to him: I am neither a scholar, nor a speculator, nor</b> an important <b>individual; rather, I teach and</b> systematically <b>arrange</b> <i>halakhic</i> rulings, <b>and</b> the scholars <b>instruct</b> the students <b>in the study hall in accordance with my</b> opinion. I maintain that <b>there is a difference for us between the arrival of the day</b> of Shabbat <b>and the departure of the day.</b> With regard to <b>the arrival of the day, the sooner we</b> welcome the day by reciting <i>kiddush</i> <b>the better, and we</b> thereby express how <b>beloved it is</b> to us. With regard to <b>the conclusion of the day, we delay it so that</b> Shabbat will not appear <b>to be like a burden to us.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara points out that one may <b>learn from this <i>baraita</i> eight</b> <i>halakhot</i>. The Gemara elaborates: <b>Learn from it</b> that <b>one who recites <i>havdala</i> in the</b> evening <b>prayer must</b> also <b>recite <i>havdala</i> over a cup.</b> The <i>baraita</i> states that one who comes home must recite the blessing over wine and <i>havdala</i>, despite the fact that he has presumably already recited <i>havdala</i> in the evening prayer service.

### Part 5
<b>And learn from it</b> that one who recites the <b>blessing</b> of Grace after Meals <b>requires a cup</b> of wine. <b>And learn from it</b> that <b>a cup of blessing requires</b> a minimum <b>measure,</b> for otherwise it would have been possible for one who has only one cup of wine to simply divide it into two, recite <i>havdala</i> immediately, and still have a cup of wine left over for Grace after Meals.

### Part 6
<b>And learn from it</b> that <b>one who recites a blessing must taste</b> the food over which he recites the blessing. Otherwise, one who has only one cup of wine would be able to use it for both <i>havdala</i> and Grace after Meals. <b>And learn from it</b> that once <b>he has tasted</b> the wine in the cup he has <b>disqualified it</b> from further use as a cup of blessing. <b>And learn from it</b> that even if one has <b>tasted</b> food after Shabbat, he nevertheless <b>recites <i>havdala</i>.</b>
