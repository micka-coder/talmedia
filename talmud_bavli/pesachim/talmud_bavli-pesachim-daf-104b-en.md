### Part 1
However, the Gemara states: <b>And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> that opinion. Instead, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>Ulla happened</b> to come <b>to Pumbedita. Rav Yehuda said to his son, Rav Yitzḥak: Go</b> and <b>bring him a basket of fruit</b> as a gift, <b>and</b> while you are there, <b>observe how he recites <i>havdala</i>.</b> Rav Yitzḥak himself <b>did not go.</b> In his place, <b>he sent to him Abaye,</b> who was a young student at the time. <b>When Abaye came</b> back, Rav Yitzḥak <b>said to him: How did</b> Ulla <b>recite</b> the blessing of <i>havdala</i>? Abaye <b>said to him</b> that Ulla <b>said: Blessed is the He Who distinguishes between sacred and profane, but</b> he did <b>not</b> say anything <b>further.</b>

### Part 3
Rav Yitzḥak <b>came before his father,</b> Rav Yehuda, who <b>said to him: How did</b> Ulla <b>recite</b> <i>havdala</i>? <b>He said to him: I</b> myself <b>did not go.</b> Instead, <b>I sent Abaye, who said to me</b> that Ulla recited: <b>Who distinguishes between sacred and profane.</b> Rav Yehuda grew angry and <b>said to him: The Master’s haughtiness and the Master’s pride caused the Master</b> to act in a way that ensured <b>that</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> will not be said in his name.</b> In other words, had you gone yourself, this <i>halakha</i> would have been attributed to you, but due to your haughtiness and pride, it will be transmitted in the name of Abaye.

### Part 4
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Ulla’s practice from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>all blessings,</b> one <b>begins</b> their recitation <b>with: Blessed, and concludes</b> reciting <b>them with: Blessed, except for blessings over mitzvot, blessings over fruit, a blessing that is juxtaposed to another</b> blessing in the order of prayer, e.g., during the <i>Amida</i> prayer, <b>and the final blessing after <i>Shema</i>.</b>

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: These blessings are different, <b>as some of them begin with: Blessed, and do not conclude with: Blessed,</b> e.g., blessings over mitzvot and before eating, <b>and some of them conclude with: Blessed, and do not begin with: Blessed,</b> such as a blessing that is juxtaposed to another blessing. <b>And</b> the blessing: <b>He Who is good and does good,</b> is exceptional, as it is a blessing that is juxtaposed to another blessing, and yet it <b>begins with: Blessed, and does not conclude with: Blessed.</b>
