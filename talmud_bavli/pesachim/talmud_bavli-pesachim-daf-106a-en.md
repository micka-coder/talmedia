### Part 1
<b>And learn from it</b> that if one has only one cup of wine, he may <b>recite two sanctifications over one cup,</b> as the <i>baraita</i> states that one may recite two entirely unrelated blessings over a single cup. <b>And learn from it</b> that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> according to the ruling of <b>Beit Shammai, in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who says that Beit Shammai maintain that one should recite the blessing over fire before the blessing over spices.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> On close examination, two of the inferences from the <i>baraita</i>, the ruling that once one who has <b>tasted</b> the cup has <b>disqualified it and</b> the ruling that <b>a cup of blessing requires</b> a specific minimum <b>measure, are</b> actually <b>one matter</b> and should not be counted separately.

### Part 3
Rav Ashi elaborates: <b>And this is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: What is the reason</b> that once one has <b>tasted</b> the cup he has <b>disqualified it</b> from further usage as a cup of blessing? It is <b>because a cup of blessing requires</b> a specific minimum <b>measure.</b> Once one has tasted, there is not enough wine left in the cup. The disqualification is not because of the act of tasting itself. If enough wine remains in the cup after one has taken a sip, it may be used again as a cup of blessing. This ruling is not in accordance with the opinion of certain Sages, who maintain that sipping from the cup itself constitutes an inherent disqualification.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi was particular with regard to a blemished pitcher,</b> i.e., he would not recite <i>kiddush</i> or <i>havdala</i> with a pitcher from which someone had already taken a sip. <b>Rav Idi bar Sheisha was particular with regard to a blemished cup. Mar bar Rav Ashi was particular even with regard to a blemished barrel</b> and would take wine for <i>kiddush</i> only from a previously unopened barrel.

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Remember the day of Shabbat to sanctify it”</b> (Exodus 20:7): <b>Remember it over wine,</b> through the recitation of <i>kiddush</i>. <b>I have only</b> derived that there is a mitzva to recite <i>kiddush</i> <b>during the day,</b> as the verse is referring to the day of Shabbat. <b>From where</b> do I derive that one must also recite <i>kiddush</i> <b>at night? The verse states: “Remember the day of Shabbat to sanctify it,”</b> which indicates that one should also remember Shabbat as soon as it is sanctified.

### Part 6
The Gemara expresses surprise at this last question: <b>From where</b> is it derived that one must recite <i>kiddush</i> <b>at night?</b> Is this the appropriate question? <b>On the contrary, the essential</b> mitzva of <b><i>kiddush</i> is to sanctify</b> the day <b>at night, as</b> one <b>must sanctify the beginning of the day,</b> i.e., Friday night; there is no reason to sanctify Shabbat in the middle of the day, i.e., in the morning. <b>And furthermore,</b> the continuation of the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>From where</b> do we derive the obligation of <i>kiddush</i> <b>at night? The verse states: “Remember the day of Shabbat.” The <i>tanna</i> is seeking</b> a source for <i>kiddush</i> <b>at night, and</b> yet he <b>cites a verse</b> that is referring <b>to the day.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara answers that <b>this is</b> what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: “Remember the day of Shabbat to sanctify it”</b> is a mitzva to <b>remember it over wine when it begins. I have only</b> derived the obligation to recite <i>kiddush</i> <b>at night; from where</b> do I derive that one must also recite <i>kiddush</i> <b>during the day? The verse states: “Remember the day of Shabbat.”</b> The emphasis of the word day indicates that one must recite <i>kiddush</i> again during the day.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>During the day,</b> when one does not recite the same <i>kiddush</i> as at night, <b>what blessing does one recite? Rav Yehuda said:</b> Before the meal, one brings a cup of wine and simply recites the usual blessing over wine: <b>Who creates the fruit of the vine.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ashi happened to</b> come to the city of <b>Meḥoza.</b> The Sages of Meḥoza <b>said to him</b> on Shabbat day: Will <b>the Master recite for us the great <i>kiddush</i>?</b> And they immediately <b>brought him</b> a cup of wine.

### Part 9
Rav Ashi was unsure what they meant by the term great <i>kiddush</i> and wondered if the residents of Meḥoza included other matters in their <i>kiddush</i>. <b>He thought: What is this great <i>kiddush</i></b> to which they refer? <b>He said</b> to himself: <b>Since</b> with regard to <b>all the blessings</b> that require a cup of wine, <b>one first recites</b> the blessing: <b>Who creates the fruit of the vine,</b> I will start with that blessing. <b>He recited: Who creates the fruit of the vine, and lengthened it</b> to see if they were expecting an additional blessing. <b>He saw a particular elder bending over his cup and drinking,</b> and he realized that this was the end of the great <i>kiddush</i>. <b>He read</b> the following verse <b>about himself: “The wise man, his eyes are in his head”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:14), as he was alert enough to discern the expectations of the local residents.

### Part 10
As stated above, <b>the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya say: One who did not recite <i>havdala</i> at the conclusion of Shabbat</b> may <b>recite <i>havdala</i> anytime</b> over the course of <b>the entire week.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And until how many</b> days of that week have passed may one still recite <i>havdala</i>? <b>Rabbi Zeira said: Until the fourth</b> day <b>of the week,</b> Wednesday, after which it is no longer considered the same week as the previous Shabbat.

### Part 11
This is <b>like that</b> ruling of <i>halakha</i> stated when <b>Rabbi Zeira sat before Rav Asi, and some say it</b> was <b>Rav Asi</b> who sat <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan. And he sat and said: With regard to</b> the wording of <b>bills of divorce,</b> the <b>first</b> day of <b>the week</b> and the <b>second and third</b> days of the week are all called: <b>After Shabbat.</b> If a bill of divorce or a condition upon which the document depends includes the phrase: After Shabbat, it refers to one of the first three days of the week. However, the <b>fourth</b> and <b>fifth</b> days of the week <b>and</b> the <b>eve of the day</b> of Shabbat are called: <b>Before Shabbat.</b> Likewise, with regard to <i>havdala</i>, the first three days of the week are considered the time period after Shabbat, and therefore one may still recite <i>havdala</i> on these days.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi said: However,</b> one who recites <i>havdala</i> during this time period may <b>not</b> recite the blessing <b>over fire.</b> This blessing may be recited only at the conclusion of Shabbat, at the time when fire was originally created.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Beruna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b>
