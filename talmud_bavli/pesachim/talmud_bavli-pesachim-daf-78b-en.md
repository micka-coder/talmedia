### Part 1
<b>Didn’t you say</b> that <b>with regard to</b> an offering involving <b>the public, even Rabbi Yehoshua concedes</b> that ritual impurity is permitted?

### Part 2
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yosei’s statement should be understood differently. When he said: <b>I see</b> as correct <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> he was referring to <b>after the fact.</b> When he said: I see as correct <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> he meant <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>After the fact Rabbi Yehoshua also concedes, as it teaches: Rabbi Yehoshua concedes that if one sprinkled</b> the blood, <b>it was accepted</b> and the offering is valid.

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: <b>This</b> case is <b>with regard to ritual impurity,</b> and <b>that</b> case is <b>with regard to</b> an offering that was <b>lost or burned.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>When it teaches</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua concedes that if one sprinkled</b> the blood <b>it is accepted,</b> that is <b>with regard to</b> a case in which the meat of the offering <b>became impure; but with regard to</b> a case where the meat of the offering was <b>lost or burned,</b> he does <b>not</b> agree, even after the fact. <b>When Rabbi Yosei said: I see</b> as correct <b>the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer after the fact,</b> that was <b>with regard to</b> cases in which the meat <b>was lost or burned,</b> with regard to which Rabbi Yehoshua did not concede to Rabbi Eliezer.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>the meat</b> of the Paschal lamb <b>became ritually impure, and the fat remains</b> pure and may be burned on the altar, <b>one</b> may <b>not sprinkle the blood.</b> On the other hand, if <b>the fat became impure and the meat remains</b> pure, <b>one</b> may <b>sprinkle the blood</b> because the meat remains fit to be eaten. This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a Paschal lamb, whose primary purpose is to be eaten by those who have registered for it. However, <b>with regard to</b> other <b>offerings it is not so. Rather, although the meat has become impure and the fat remains</b> pure, <b>one</b> may <b>sprinkle the blood,</b> because part of the offering still remains valid.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said: If one sprinkled</b> the blood despite the fact that the meat was ritually impure, <b>it was</b> nonetheless <b>accepted;</b> one is not obligated to observe the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>Don’t we require</b> that the Paschal lamb be <b>eaten,</b> which could not occur in this case? The Gemara answers: Failure to engage in <b>eating</b> the offering <b>does not preclude</b> it from being accepted.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it written:</b> “And if the household be too little for a lamb, then he and his neighbor who is close to his house shall take one according to the number of the souls; <b>according to every man’s eating</b> you shall make your count for the lamb” (Exodus 12:4)? This indicates that the Torah requires one to eat the Paschal lamb. The Gemara responds: This verse is stated <b>as a mitzva</b> only. It should be fulfilled, but it does not preclude acceptance of the offering.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> was it <b>not</b> stated <b>to preclude</b> acceptance of the offering if it cannot be eaten? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“According to the number of</b> the souls”; this <b>teaches that the Paschal lamb is slaughtered only for those who have registered for it</b> and have thereby included themselves in advance in the number of the souls? I <b>might</b> have thought that if <b>one slaughtered it for those who have not registered for it, he is</b> merely <b>like one who violates a mitzva,</b> but the offering is still <b>valid</b> after the fact. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “According to every man’s eating you shall make your count”; the verse repeated</b> that the Paschal lamb is eaten only by those registered in order <b>to</b> underscore that failure to register <b>precludes</b> the offering from being valid.

### Part 8
<b>And those who</b> are able to <b>eat</b> the offering, as opposed to the sick or elderly who are unable to eat it, <b>are juxtaposed</b> in the verse <b>to those who registered.</b> Therefore, just as a Paschal lamb is disqualified if it is slaughtered for those who did not register for it, it is disqualified if it cannot be eaten. This poses a difficulty for the opinion of Rav.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, Rav said</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan, who said</b> that failure to engage in <b>eating the Paschal lamb does not preclude</b> one from fulfilling one’s obligation to bring the offering, as the eating is a separate mitzva.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Natan</b> is this referring to? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>this</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Natan, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that all Jews</b> may <b>fulfill</b> their obligation after the fact <b>with one Paschal lamb? The verse states: “And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it in the afternoon”</b> (Exodus 12:6). He asked: <b>And does the entire assembly slaughter</b> it? Is it a mitzva for each individual to slaughter his own Paschal lamb? <b>Is it not</b> true that <b>only one</b> person <b>slaughters</b> for the entire group? <b>Rather,</b> this formulation of the verse <b>teaches that all Jews</b> may <b>fulfill their obligation with one Paschal lamb.</b> It is considered as though they all slaughtered it and fulfilled their obligation, although they cannot all eat an olive-bulk of the offering.

### Part 11
The Gemara responds that this is not comparable to the case at hand: <b>Perhaps it is different there, as, if these withdraw</b> from the offering, <b>it is fit for those, and if those withdraw it is fit for these.</b> Although it is impossible for all Jews to partake of the same offering, the offering is fit for each individual, who could eat an olive-bulk of it if enough other people would withdraw.

### Part 12
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>this</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Natan, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one group registered for</b> a Paschal lamb <b>and then another group registered for it,</b> and there was not enough meat to allow each person to eat an olive-bulk, <b>the first ones, who have an olive-bulk</b> of the Paschal lamb for each person, <b>eat and are exempt from performing</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>; the latter ones, who do not have an olive-bulk</b> available from the Paschal lamb for each person, <b>do not eat and are obligated to perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> Both <b>these and those are exempt from performing</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, as the blood has already been sprinkled.</b> Therefore, they have all fulfilled their obligation. This indicates that, according to the opinion of Rabbi Natan, eating is not essential.

### Part 14
The Gemara responds that one can <b>still</b> ask: <b>Perhaps it is different there, as, if these</b> members of the first group <b>withdraw, it is fit for</b> the members of the second group. The Gemara rejects the question: <b>If so, let it teach</b> that the second group is exempt from the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>since</b> the members of the first group <b>are fit to withdraw. What</b> is the reason for the statement of the <i>baraita</i> that <b>the blood has already been sprinkled? Learn from this that the matter depends on the blood, but</b> failure to engage in <b>eating</b> the Paschal lamb <b>does not preclude</b> one from fulfilling his obligation.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>What compelled Rav to establish the mishna</b> as teaching that the blood may not be sprinkled on the altar <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan? Let us establish</b> the mishna in accordance with the view of <b>the Rabbis and</b> say that <b>even after the fact, no,</b> one does not fulfill his obligation. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav had difficulty with the mishna: Why does it teach</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>not sprinkle the blood? It should teach that</b> the offering <b>is disqualified. Rather, learn from this</b> use of language that <b>one</b> may <b>not sprinkle</b> the blood on the altar <b><i>ab initio</i>, but after the fact it seems well.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan, why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“according to every man’s eating,”</b> if it does not teach that the eating is essential? The Gemara answers: It is necessary, even according to the opinion of Rabbi Natan, to teach <b>that we require a person who is fit for eating.</b> Although it is possible to fulfill one’s obligation without actually eating the Paschal lamb, if one is physically unable to eat some of it, e.g., one who is sick or elderly, he does not fulfill his obligation.

### Part 17
The Gemara raises a discussion based on the views cited above. <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> that <b>taught this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>As the Sages taught:</b> If <b>one slaughtered it for</b> individuals who are <b>able to eat it and sprinkled its blood for</b> individuals <b>who cannot eat it, the Paschal lamb itself is valid, and one fulfills his obligation with it. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? <b>Let us say it is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan,</b> who holds that eating is not essential, <b>and not</b> in accordance with <b>the</b> opinion of the <b>Rabbis?</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: The <i>baraita</i> can be understood <b>even</b> if <b>you say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> Everyone agrees that improper <b>intent</b> pertaining to <b>those who will eat</b> the offering disqualifies the offering only if it occurs during the slaughter; it does not disqualify the offering if it occurs during the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> that <b>taught this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>As the Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>one who was sick</b> and not able to eat meat <b>at the time of</b> the <b>slaughter and</b> was <b>healthy at the time of</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, or one who was <b>healthy at the time of</b> the <b>slaughter and sick at the time of</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, <b>one</b> may <b>not slaughter or sprinkle</b> blood <b>for him until he is healthy from the time of slaughter until</b> the <b>time of</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this? <b>Let us say it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that eating the Paschal lamb is essential, <b>and not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: The <i>baraita</i> can be understood <b>even</b> if <b>you say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan,</b> because even Rabbi Natan holds that <b>we require a person who is fit for eating.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara records a further discussion: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> that <b>taught this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>As the Sages taught:</b> If <b>one slaughtered</b> the Paschal lamb <b>in ritual purity, and after that the owners became ritually impure, the blood</b> should <b>be sprinkled in purity and the meat</b> should <b>not be eaten in impurity. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>?

### Part 21
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> is <b>subject to dispute, and it is</b> taught in this <i>baraita</i> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan,</b> who holds that eating is not essential, and not in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> can be understood <b>even</b> if <b>you say</b> that <b>it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. With what are we dealing here? With</b> a situation in which the majority of <b>the public</b> is ritually impure, in which case everyone agrees that <b>they perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>even in</b> a state of <b>impurity.</b>

### Part 22
The Gemara asks: <b>If it is in</b> a case involving <b>the public, why is the meat not eaten in</b> a state of <b>impurity?</b> When the majority of the public is impure, they may sacrifice and even consume the Paschal lamb. The Gemara answers that this prohibition is due to a rabbinic <b>decree lest the owners become impure after the sprinkling</b> of the blood, <b>and they will say: Last year, didn’t we become impure, and</b> nevertheless <b>we ate</b> the Paschal lamb? <b>Now too, we will eat. And they will not know that last year, when the blood was sprinkled the owners were</b> already <b>impure,</b> and therefore the offering could be consumed in a state of impurity. <b>Now, the owners were pure</b> when the blood was sprinkled and became impure only afterward, and a Paschal lamb sacrificed in a state of purity cannot be eaten in a state of impurity, even if everyone is impure.
