### Part 1
<b>due to</b> the fact that the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a nazirite</b> and those of <b>a sin-offering</b> are <b>two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., to teach the same principle, and two verses that teach the same principle <b>do not teach</b> that principle by analogy.

### Part 2
The Gemara elaborates: The derivation that a permitted substance joins together with a prohibited substance in the case of <b>a nazirite</b> is <b>that which we stated</b> above. With regard to <b>a sin-offering, what is</b> the derivation that permitted material combines with prohibited material? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Anything that touches in its flesh shall become consecrated”</b> (Leviticus 6:20). I <b>might</b> have thought that non-sacred meat that touched any part of a sin-offering is rendered prohibited <b>even if it did not absorb</b> the taste of the sin-offering it touched. Therefore, <b>the verse states: In its flesh shall become consecrated,</b> to teach that this meat is not consecrated <b>until</b> the taste of the sin-offering <b>is absorbed within its flesh.</b>

### Part 3
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Shall become consecrated</b> means that <b>its</b> legal status <b>becomes like</b> that of the sin-offering itself; <b>that</b> is, <b>if</b> the sin-offering <b>is disqualified,</b> this meat <b>will</b> also <b>be disqualified. And if</b> the sin-offering <b>is valid,</b> the meat that touched it may <b>be eaten in accordance with the more stringent</b> standards <b>of</b> a sin-offering as far as when and where it may be eaten. The principle that a permitted substance joins together with a prohibited substance applies in the case of a sin-offering as well. Therefore, the principle cannot be extended to the entire Torah, as a <i>halakha</i> stated in two cases is not applied elsewhere.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the Rabbis as well, let</b> the cases of <b>a nazirite and a sin-offering</b> be considered <b>two verses that come as one and they do not teach</b> the principle that the legal status of taste is like that of the substance with regard to the entire Torah.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers that the Rabbis <b>say:</b> Both of <b>these</b> cases <b>are necessary</b> as they could not have been derived from each other. Therefore, they are not two verses that come as one and it is possible to derive a principle from these two <i>halakhot</i>.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Akiva,</b> who does not derive a general principle from these verses, would respond by asking: In <b>what</b> way <b>are</b> they <b>necessary? Granted, if the Merciful One had written</b> this principle only with regard <b>to a sin-offering,</b> one would <b>not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a nazirite from it,</b> as <b>we do not derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b>non-sacred</b> objects <b>from</b> those of <b>consecrated</b> objects. Certain stringencies and strictures apply only to consecrated property. <b>However, let the Merciful One write</b> this principle <b>with regard to a nazirite, and you</b> could <b>bring</b> the case of the <b>sin-offering and derive</b> it from the case of a nazirite, just <b>as</b> the application of this principle to <b>all prohibitions in the Torah is derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a nazirite.</b> Since this principle is stated in both cases unnecessarily, these are two verses that come as one, and one cannot derive a principle from them.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> as they maintain that the principle that the legal status of the taste of a prohibited substance is like that of the substance itself is not limited to these two cases, they would <b>say to you</b> that both sources <b>are necessary.</b> The case of the <b>sin-offering</b> is necessary <b>to</b> derive the principle <b>that a permitted</b> substance <b>joins together with a prohibited</b> substance, as <b>one cannot derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>from consecrated</b> property. <b>And</b> the term <b>soaked,</b> which appears in the context of the <i>halakhot</i> of a nazirite, <b>teaches</b> the principle that the legal status of <b>taste is like</b> that of the <b>substance.</b> Since both examples are necessary, they are not considered two verses that come as one, and it is therefore possible to derive a principle from them. <b>And</b> consequently <b>from here you derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to all of the Torah in its entirety.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how could <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Akiva would say that <b>both</b> cases teach the principle that <b>a permitted</b> substance <b>joins together with a prohibited</b> substance, <b>and they are</b> indeed <b>two verses that come as one,</b> to teach about the same issue. <b>And</b> the rule is that <b>any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> overarching principles.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: But</b> with regard to <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: “He shall eat <b>nothing that is made of the grapevine, from the grape skins to the grape seed”</b> (Numbers 6:4), <b>taught with regard to prohibitions of a nazirite that</b> these substances <b>join together.</b> If the nazirite ate only a small amount of each substance that when joined together constitute the measure that determines liability, he is liable. <b>Now</b> the following question arises: <b>According to Rabbi Akiva,</b> who maintains that <b>prohibited and permitted</b> substances <b>join together, is it necessary</b> to teach that one <b>prohibited</b> substance <b>joins together with</b> another <b>prohibited</b> substance? Apparently, according to Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, this derivation is unnecessary.

### Part 10
Rav Kahana <b>said to him</b> that this derivation is necessary because the two cases are not identical: Whereas <b>prohibited and permitted</b> substances combine only when they are eaten <b>simultaneously, prohibited and</b> other <b>prohibited</b> substances join together even when eaten <b>one after the other.</b> In other words, if a nazirite eats half an olive-bulk of grape skins and then eats half an olive-bulk of grape seeds, he is liable according to Rabbi Akiva.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>dough that is in the cracks of a</b> kneading <b>bowl, if there is an olive-bulk</b> of dough <b>in one place,</b> one <b>is obligated to remove</b> it. <b>And if</b> the dough does <b>not</b> add up to this amount, <b>it is nullified due to its insignificance.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And similarly, with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of immersion to purify the bowl from <b>ritual impurity, if one is particular about</b> the dough that is stuck in the cracks and he plans to remove it and use it, <b>it</b> is a foreign substance that <b>interposes</b> between the kneading bowl and the water of the ritual bath, and invalidates the immersion of the bowl, leaving it ritually impure. <b>And if he wants</b> the dough <b>to remain</b> in place, <b>its</b> status <b>is like</b> that <b>of the</b> kneading <b>bowl</b> itself and is not an interposition.

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: They taught</b> that one is obligated to remove a combined olive-bulk of leaven <b>only in a case where the</b> pieces of dough <b>are not</b> in a position where they <b>serve to reinforce</b> the kneading bowl. <b>However, in a case where they serve to reinforce</b> the bowl and they will remain there for this purpose, <b>he is not obligated to remove</b> them; he may simply render them null and void.

### Part 14
The Gemara concludes: This proves <b>by inference</b> that with regard to <b>less than an olive-bulk, even in a place where it does not serve to reinforce</b> the bowl, <b>one is not obligated to remove</b> it.

### Part 15
<b>Some teach</b> the statement of Rav Yehuda with regard <b>to the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And if</b> the dough is <b>not</b> an olive-bulk, <b>it is nullified due to its insignificance. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: They taught</b> that one is obligated to remove less than an olive-bulk of dough in one place <b>only in a place where it serves to reinforce</b> the bowl; <b>however, in a place where it does not serve to reinforce</b> the bowl, <b>one is obligated to remove it.</b> This proves <b>by inference that</b> if there is <b>an olive-bulk</b> of dough in one place, <b>even in a place where it serves to reinforce</b> the bowl, <b>one is obligated to remove it.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara comments: It <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with the first version</b> of Rav Yehuda’s statement, and it <b>was taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with the latter version</b> of his statement. The Gemara elaborates: It <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with the first version</b> of Rav Yehuda’s statement: With regard to <b>dough that is in the cracks of a</b> kneading <b>bowl in a place where it is serves to reinforce</b> the bowl, it <b>does not interpose</b> and invalidate the immersion for ritual impurity, <b>and one does not violate</b> the prohibition against having leaven in his possession during Passover. <b>And in a case where it does not serve to reinforce</b> the bowl, <b>it interposes, and one violates</b> the prohibition against having leaven in his possession on Passover. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is <b>in</b> the case of <b>an olive-bulk</b> of dough; <b>however,</b> in a case where there is <b>less than olive-bulk, even in a case where it does not serve to reinforce</b> the bowl, <b>it does not interpose and</b> one <b>does not violate</b> a prohibition by having it in his possession.

### Part 17
<b>And</b> it <b>was taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with the latter version</b> of Rav Yehuda’s statement: With regard to <b>dough that is in the cracks of a</b> kneading <b>bowl, in a place where it serves to reinforce</b> the bowl,
