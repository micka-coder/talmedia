### Part 1
Rabbi Yosei maintains that once they have <b>finished</b> their meal, they bring out two cups; <b>over the first cup one recites the Grace after Meals, and over the second</b> cup he <b>recites the sanctification of the day.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> do they need two cups? <b>And let them say both of them,</b> Grace after Meals and <i>kiddush</i>, <b>over one cup.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: One does not recite two sanctifications,</b> i.e., for two mitzvot such as Grace after Meals and <i>kiddush</i>, <b>over one cup. What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Because one does not perform mitzvot in bundles.</b> If someone performs multiple mitzvot all in one go, he gives the impression that they are a burdensome obligation that he wants to complete as fast as possible.

### Part 3
<b>And</b> does one <b>not</b> perform multiple mitzvot together? <b>But wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who enters his home at the conclusion of Shabbat recites the blessing over the wine, and</b> then <b>over the light, and</b> then <b>over the spices, and thereafter he recites <i>havdala</i> over the cup</b> of wine. <b>And if he has only one cup</b> of wine, <b>he leaves it for after</b> he eats his <b>food,</b> and uses it for Grace after Meals, <b>and arranges all of the</b> other blessings together <b>thereafter.</b> This <i>baraita</i> indicates that one may use the same cup both for Grace after Meals and <i>havdala</i>. The Gemara answers: We cannot prove anything from here, as a case where one <b>does not have</b> an additional cup <b>is different.</b> One who has two cups of wine is required to recite Grace after Meals over one of the cups and <i>havdala</i> over the other one.

### Part 4
The Gemara continues its line of questioning: <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>a Festival that occurs after Shabbat,</b> when presumably <b>one has</b> enough wine. <b>And</b> nevertheless, <b>Rav said</b> that the proper order of the blessings is according to the Hebrew acronym <b><i>yod</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>heh</i>:</b> The blessing over the wine [<i>yayin</i>], <i>kiddush</i>, the blessing over the candle [<i>ner</i>], and <i>havdala</i>. This ruling shows that one recites <i>kiddush</i> and <i>havdala</i> over the same cup of wine.

### Part 5
<b>They say</b> in answer to this question: <b>From</b> the fact that Rav <b>did not say</b> that one recites the blessing for <b>time,</b> Who has given us life [<i>sheheḥiyanu</i>], sustained us, and brought us to this time, this proves <b>by inference that we are dealing with the seventh</b> day <b>of Passover,</b> which is the only Festival day on which one does not recite the blessing for time. If so, it is possible that <b>whatever</b> wine this person <b>had, he</b> has already <b>consumed</b> over the course of the Festival, <b>and he does not have</b> enough wine left for two separate cups.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>the first Festival</b> night that occurs after Shabbat, <b>when one has</b> wine, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>Abaye said</b> that the order of the blessings in this instance follows the Hebrew acronym <b><i>yod</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>zayin</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>heh</i>:</b> The blessing over wine [<i>yayin</i>]; <i>kiddush</i>; the blessing for time [<i>zeman</i>]; the blessing over the candle [<i>ner</i>]; and <i>havdala</i>. <b>And Rava said</b> that the order of the blessings is in accordance with the acronym <b><i>yod</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>zayin</i>:</b> Wine [<i>yayin</i>]; <i>kiddush</i>; candle [<i>ner</i>]; <i>havdala</i>; and the blessing for time [<i>zeman</i>]. Although Abaye and Rava dispute the correct order of the blessings, they agree that one recites multiple blessings over a single cup of wine.

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects the previous explanation in favor of the following: <b><i>Havdala</i> and <i>kiddush</i> are one matter,</b> as they both mark and draw attention to the sanctity of certain days. By contrast, <b>Grace after Meals and <i>kiddush</i> are two</b> entirely different <b>matters.</b> Therefore, one who recites both of them over the same cup of wine is combining two unrelated mitzvot, apparently so that he can be done with them as quickly as possible. Consequently, this practice is prohibited.

### Part 8
After raising the issue of the proper order of the blessings for <i>kiddush</i> on a Festival that occurs right after Shabbat, the Gemara addresses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself.</b> With regard to <b>a Festival that occurs after Shabbat, Rav said</b> that the proper order of the blessings follows the acronym <b><i>yod</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>heh</i>:</b> Wine [<i>yayin</i>], <i>kiddush</i>, candle [<i>ner</i>], and <i>havdala</i>; <b>and Shmuel said</b> the proper order is <b><i>yod</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>kuf</i>:</b> Wine [<i>yayin</i>], candle [<i>ner</i>], <i>havdala</i>, and <i>kiddush</i>.
