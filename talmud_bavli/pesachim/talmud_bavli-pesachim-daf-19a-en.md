### Part 1
<b>any impure thing shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 7:19). <b>Are we not dealing</b> even with a case <b>where</b> meat <b>touched</b> an object that was ritually impure with <b>second-</b>degree ritual impurity? And nevertheless, the verse states explicitly that it is impure and assumes third-degree ritual impurity status. No other source is needed to teach that consecrated objects can assume third-degree ritual impurity status. Therefore, <b>fourth-</b>degree impurity status can be derived <b>by</b> means of the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, <b>as we stated</b> above.

### Part 2
The Gemara returns to its previous point: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that Rabbi Yosei <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> that non-sacred objects can assume third-degree impurity status, <b>let him also teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>fourth</b> degree of impurity <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>, and</b> the <b>fifth</b> degree <b>with regard to consecrated</b> items, on the basis of that same <i>a fortiori</i> inference. The fact that he does not extend the <i>a fortiori</i> inference to include these <i>halakhot</i> proves that Rabbi Yosei does not agree with Rabbi Akiva’s opinion on this issue.

### Part 3
<b>However,</b> with regard to the fact that <b>Rabbi Akiva does not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, from where do we</b> derive this? Perhaps he accepts Rabbi Yosei’s <i>a fortiori</i> inference and holds that <i>teruma</i> assumes fourth-degree impurity status and consecrated items assume fifth-degree impurity status.

### Part 4
Rav Kahana <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi that there is indirect proof that this is the case. <b>As it is not</b> possible <b>to avoid</b> finding at least one <b><i>tanna</i> who teaches fourth-</b>degree impurity with regard to <b><i>teruma</i></b> and fifth-degree impurity with regard to <b>consecrated</b> items, <b>and says</b> that <b>this is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who derived it from the <i>a fortiori</i> inference of Rabbi Yosei. In response to this claim, the Gemara asks: <b>And will we stand and rely on that</b> proof? Can proof for Rabbi Akiva’s opinion be cited from the fact that no such <i>tanna</i> was found? Perhaps there is some source for that <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Ashi, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Kahana, left</b> the study hall to examine this matter. <b>He analyzed</b> the issue <b>and found</b> proof positive that Rabbi Akiva does not hold that there is fifth-degree impurity with regard to consecrated items. He proved this from <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>A vessel joins that which is in it</b> into a single unit. For example, if there are fruits in a vessel between which there is no contact and one of them became ritually impure, all of the fruits are impure, as they are joined by the vessel. This principle applies <b>with regard to consecrated property, but not with regard to <i>teruma</i>. And the fourth</b> degree of impurity <b>disqualifies consecrated</b> items but does not transmit impurity, <b>while third-</b>degree impurity disqualifies <b><i>teruma</i>.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is <b>from the testimony of Rabbi Akiva</b> that <b>this mishna is taught, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Akiva added</b> in his testimony with regard to <b>the</b> fine <b>flour, the incense, the frankincense, and the coals</b> on the altar, which are not foods and do not ordinarily become impure, <b>that if</b> a person <b>who immersed during that day,</b> who disqualifies consecrated items, <b>touches some of them, he disqualifies all of them,</b> as the vessel joins them into one unit.

### Part 7
This <i>baraita</i>, which is the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, states that with regard to <b>fourth-</b>degree impurity, <b>yes,</b> consecrated objects assume that status; however, with regard to <b>fifth-</b>degree impurity, <b>no,</b> consecrated objects do not assume that status. With regard to <b>third-</b>degree impurity, <b>yes,</b> <i>teruma</i> assumes that status; however, with regard to <b>fourth-</b>degree impurity, <b>no,</b> <i>teruma</i> does not assume that status.

### Part 8
The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>holds</b> that <b>joining</b> in a single vessel, of frankincense, incense, or coals, is a <i>halakha</i> <b>by rabbinic law,</b> not by Torah law, as the ritual impurity of frankincense and coals is by rabbinic law. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>disputes that</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Ḥanin, who said: Joining</b> in a vessel is a <i>halakha</i> <b>by Torah law, as it is stated: “One golden spoon of ten shekels, filled with incense”</b> (Numbers 7:20). <b>The verse rendered everything in the spoon,</b> i.e., all the incense, as <b>one</b> entity.

### Part 9
Apropos ritual purity and impurity in the Temple, the Gemara cites that <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>there:</b> The Sages testified <b>about</b> the case of <b>a needle that was found in the meat</b> of an animal that was led through water, <b>that the knife and the hands</b> that touched the needle <b>are ritually pure but the meat is impure,</b> as the needle might have been impure. If the needle <b>was found in the secretions</b> of the animal’s stomach, <b>everything is pure,</b> as secretions do not transfer impurity to the meat. <b>Rabbi Akiva said: We were privileged</b> to learn a novel <i>halakha</i> from here, which is <b>that there is no impurity of hands in the Temple</b> as in this case the hands did not become impure upon contact with the needle.
