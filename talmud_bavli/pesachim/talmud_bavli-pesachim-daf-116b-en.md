### Part 1
<b>these three matters on Passover has not fulfilled his obligation:</b> The <b>Paschal lamb, <i>matza</i>, and bitter herbs.</b> When one mentions these matters, he must elaborate and explain them: The <b>Paschal lamb</b> is brought <b>because the Omnipresent passed over [<i>pasaḥ</i>] the houses of our forefathers in Egypt, as it is stated: “That you shall say: It is the sacrifice of the Lord’s Paschal offering for He passed over</b> the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses” (Exodus 12:27).

### Part 2
Rabban Gamliel continues to explain: The reason for <b><i>matza</i></b> is <b>because our forefathers were redeemed from Egypt, as it is stated: “And they baked the dough that they took out of Egypt</b> as cakes of <i>matzot</i>, for it was not leavened, as they were thrust out of Egypt and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual” (Exodus 12:39). The reason for <b>bitter herbs</b> is <b>because the Egyptians embittered our forefathers’ lives in Egypt, as it is stated: “And they embittered their lives</b> with hard service, in mortar and in brick; in all manner of service in the field, all the service that they made them serve was with rigor” (Exodus 1:14).

### Part 3
The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna further states: <b>In each and every generation a person must view himself as though he</b> personally <b>left Egypt, as it is stated: “And you shall tell your son on that day, saying: It is because of this which the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 13:8). In every generation, each person must say: “This which the Lord did for me,” and not: This which the Lord did for my forefathers.

### Part 4
The mishna continues with the text of the Haggadah. <b>Therefore we are obligated to thank, praise, glorify, extol, exalt, honor, bless, revere, and laud [<i>lekales</i>] the One who performed for our forefathers and for us all these miracles: He took us out from slavery to freedom, from sorrow to joy, from mourning to a Festival, from darkness to a great light, and from enslavement to redemption. And we will say before Him: <i>Halleluya</i>.</b> At this point one recites the <i>hallel</i> that is said on all joyous days.

### Part 5
Since one does not complete <i>hallel</i> at this point in the seder, the mishna asks: <b>Until where does one recite</b> <i>hallel</i>? <b>Beit Shammai say: Until</b> “Who makes the barren woman dwell in her house as <b>a joyful mother of children,</b> <i>halleluya</i>” (Psalms 113:9). <b>And Beit Hillel say: Until</b> “Who turned the rock into a pool of water, <b>the flint into a fountain of waters”</b> (Psalms 114:8). <b>And one concludes</b> this section of <i>hallel</i> <b>with</b> a blessing that refers to <b>redemption. Rabbi Tarfon says</b> that although one should recite: <b>Who redeemed us and redeemed our forefathers from Egypt,</b> one who did so <b>would not conclude</b> with the formula: Blessed are You, Lord.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that one recites a different version of this blessing: <b>So too, the Lord our God and the God of our forefathers will bring us to future holidays and Festivals in peace, happy over the building of Your city and joyous in Your service. And there we will eat from the Paschal lamb and other offerings, etc., until: Blessed are You, Lord, Who redeemed Israel.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rava said:</b> When mentioning the exodus from Egypt one <b>must say: And He took us out from there.</b> Furthermore, <b>Rava said:</b> When one mentions <b><i>matza</i></b> in the list of the three matters one must recall during the seder, <b>he must lift</b> it for display before the assembled company. Likewise, when discussing <b>bitter herbs, one must raise</b> them. However, nowadays <b>one need not raise</b> the <b>meat. And not only that, but</b> it is prohibited to do so, for if one lifts the meat <b>it appears as though he is eating sacrificial meat outside</b> the Temple. An observer might think he is presenting it as the meat of a Paschal lamb, and it is prohibited by Torah law to slaughter a sheep as a Paschal lamb outside the Temple.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: A blind</b> person <b>is exempt from reciting</b> the <b>Haggadah.</b> The proof is that <b>it is written here,</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb: “And you shall tell your son on that day saying, <b>it is because of this</b> which the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt” (Exodus 13:8), <b>and it was written there,</b> with regard to the stubborn and rebellious son, that his parents say: <b>“This son of ours</b> is stubborn and rebellious, he does not listen to our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard” (Deuteronomy 21:20). The Gemara explains the verbal analogy of the word “this”: <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the rebellious son, the Sages expound that the verse <b>excludes a blind</b> person, as a blind parent cannot say: This son of ours, for he cannot point to him; <b>so too here,</b> in the case of the recitation of the Passover Haggadah, the word “this” <b>excludes blind</b> people.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Mareimar say: I asked the Sages from the school of Rav Yosef,</b> who was blind: <b>Who recited</b> the <b>Haggadah in the house of Rav Yosef? They said</b> to him: <b>Rav Yosef</b> himself recited it. Mareimar subsequently asked: <b>Who recited</b> the <b>Haggadah in the house of Rav Sheshet,</b> who was also blind? <b>They said</b> to him: <b>Rav Sheshet</b> himself recited it. This indicates that a blind person is obligated to recite the Haggadah. The Gemara answers: <b>These Sages,</b> Rav Yosef and Rav Sheshet, <b>maintain</b> that <b>nowadays</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of eating <b><i>matza</i></b> and the recitation of the Haggadah that accompanies it apply <b>by rabbinic</b> law. For this reason, blind people can recite the Haggadah for others.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: Does this prove <b>by inference</b> that <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov maintains</b> that eating <b><i>matza</i> nowadays</b> applies <b>by Torah</b> law? <b>But isn’t Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov the one who said</b> that eating <b><i>matza</i> nowadays</b> applies <b>by rabbinic</b> law? Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov apparently contradicts himself. The Gemara answers: Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov <b>maintains</b> that <b>everything the Sages instituted</b> through their decrees, <b>they instituted similar</b> to the model established <b>by Torah</b> law. In other words, although the obligations to eat <i>matza</i> and recite the Haggadah are rabbinic, the stringencies and restrictions that apply to Torah mitzvot apply here as well. Therefore, a blind person is exempt from reciting the Haggadah.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Sheshet and Rav Yosef too, certainly everything the Sages instituted</b> through their decrees, <b>they instituted similar</b> to the model established <b>by Torah</b> law. Why, then, did these blind Sages recite the Haggadah themselves?

### Part 12
The Gemara rejects this difficulty: <b>How can</b> these cases, the verses dealing with rebellious son and the Passover Haggadah, <b>be compared? Granted, there,</b> in the case of the rebellious son, <b>as</b> the verse <b>could have written: He is our son, and</b> instead <b>it is written: “This son of ours,”</b> I can <b>learn from it</b> that the parents must point to a finger to their son, <b>which comes to exclude blind</b> parents. <b>However, here,</b> if the verse did <b>not</b> use the phrase <b>“because of this,” what</b> could it have <b>written</b> in reference to <i>matzot</i> and bitter herbs? <b>Rather,</b> this verse <b>comes because of the <i>matza</i> and bitter herbs.</b> Consequently, there is no need to actually to point with one’s finger in this instance, and therefore the blind are also obligated to recite the Haggadah.

### Part 13
The mishna states: <b>Therefore we are obligated</b> to thank.
