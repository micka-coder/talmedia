<b>he said</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “The <b>first fruits</b> of your grain, your wine, your oil, and the first of the fleece of your sheep, shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), implying <b>that its remnants are recognizable for an Israelite,</b> as the notion of a first part indicates that there is another portion remaining which is fit to be consumed by the Israelite. <b>This</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>is excluded as there is no recognizable remnant</b> left that may be consumed by the Israelite, because it is leavened bread. Since even after this portion has been separated the remainder of the produce may not be eaten, that which was separated does not become <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Avya sat before Rav Ḥisda, and he sat and said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> With regard to <b>grapes that became ritually impure,</b> one should <b>tread on them less than an egg-bulk at a time, and the wine</b> that comes from them is <b>kosher</b> even <b>for libations</b> because it is ritually pure. <b>Apparently</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>holds: The liquid is stored</b> inside the grape, as the juice is not considered to be part of the grape itself but rather stored in the grape as though contained in a receptacle. According to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion, <b>when do</b> these liquids <b>become ritually impure?</b> This occurs only <b>when one squeezes them,</b> and prior to this the juice remains pure even if the grape was impure. And <b>when one squeezes them, there is less than the</b> minimum <b>measure</b> of grape flesh that would transfer ritual impurity, as food can impart ritual impurity only if it is at least an egg-bulk in size.

### Part 3
The Gemara challenges this statement: <b>If that is so, then even</b> if he squeezes <b>an egg-bulk</b> of grapes, the juice will still not become impure. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: In the case of <b>one who is ritually impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>a corpse</b> and <b>who squeezed olives or grapes</b> in the <b>exact</b> amount of <b>an egg-bulk,</b> the liquid <b>is</b> ritually <b>pure.</b> Once the first drop of liquid is squeezed out, less than an egg-bulk of food remains, and it cannot render the liquid impure. In that case, why did Rabbi Yoḥanan permit squeezing only less than an egg-bulk? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> it was speaking of a case where the ruling was <b>after the fact;</b> however, <b>here,</b> it is discussing the ruling <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> and the mishna states that one may press juice only from less than an egg-bulk of grapes due to <b>a</b> rabbinic <b>decree lest one come to perform</b> the act of squeezing on <b>more than an egg-bulk,</b> causing the liquid to become impure.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to</b> Rav Aḥa bar Rav Avya: <b>Who will listen to you and to Rabbi Yoḥanan your teacher</b> with regard to this issue? <b>As, where did the impurity that was in</b> the grape juice <b>go?</b> The Gemara notes that <b>apparently</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>holds: Liquids are absorbed</b> within the fruit and are therefore considered to be part of the grape itself. <b>And since the flesh of the grape became ritually impure, the liquid became ritually impure</b> as well.

### Part 5
Rav Aḥa <b>said to him: Do you not hold</b> that <b>liquids are stored</b> inside the grape? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: In the case of <b>one who is ritually impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>a corpse</b> and <b>who squeezed olives or grapes</b> in the <b>exact</b> amount of <b>an egg-bulk,</b> using a flat wooden utensil without touching the liquid itself, the liquid is ritually <b>pure. Granted, if you say</b> that the juice is <b>stored</b> inside the grapes, then it is <b>due to that</b> reason that the liquid <b>is pure. But if you say</b> that the liquid is <b>absorbed</b> within the grapes, <b>why</b> is the juice <b>pure?</b> According to this opinion, once the grape itself becomes impure, the juice, which is attached to it and absorbed in it, becomes impure as well.

### Part 6
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case where <b>the grapes have not been rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, since they have not come in contact with liquids. <b>When do they become susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? This is only <b>once one presses them</b> and they become wet with their own juice. However, <b>when he presses them,</b> they decrease in volume <b>and are lacking the measure</b> of volume required to become impure. This must be the explanation, <b>for if you do not say so,</b> it is difficult to reconcile this mishna with <b>that which was taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>To what</b> may <b>this</b> case of <i>teruma</i> of leavened bread <b>be compared?</b> It may be compared <b>to <i>teruma</i> of berries, olives, and grapes that became impure, which can neither be eaten nor burned.</b> However, according to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement <b>they may even be eaten, as if one wishes he may tread less than an egg-bulk</b> at a time.

### Part 7
<b>Rava said:</b> It is possible to reject this proof, as even if this action is permitted in principle, there is <b>a rabbinic decree</b> prohibiting it <b>lest he encounter a stumbling block.</b> If one keeps ritually impure fruit of <i>teruma</i> in order to press it for its juice, it is possible that he will forget its status and accidentally eat it. <b>Abaye said to him: Are we concerned about</b> this type of <b>stumbling block? Wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> may <b>light</b> a fire <b>with bread and oil of <i>teruma</i> that became ritually impure?</b> It can be deduced from this <i>baraita</i> that there is no concern that a person will forget and eat these foods. Rava <b>said to him: Bread</b> is only permitted when <b>one throws it among the wood</b> used for fuel so that it is ruined and no longer considered edible. <b><i>Teruma</i> oil</b> is permitted only <b>when one puts it into a repulsive vessel</b> so that no one will drink it.

### Part 8
With regard to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself,</b> it was taught: <b>One</b> may <b>light with bread and oil of <i>teruma</i> that became ritually impure.</b> The Sages limited the application of this <i>halakha</i>, as <b>Abaye said in the name of Ḥizkiya and Rava said</b> in the name of the Sages from <b>the school of Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Marta</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: They taught</b> that one may use impure <i>teruma</i> as firewood <b>only</b> with regard to <b>bread; however,</b> with regard to <b>wheat, no,</b> one may not light a fire <b>with it, lest one encounter a stumbling block</b> and eat it, because wheat will not become inedible by being placed among the firewood. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even wheat</b> may be used as fuel. The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> does he permit this? <b>Let us be concerned lest he encounter a stumbling block.</b> The Gemara answers based on what <b>Rav Ashi said</b> with regard to a different issue:
