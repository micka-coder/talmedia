<b>so too, here</b> he should use <b>a piece</b> of <i>matza</i>. <b>Alternatively: Just as the manner of a poor person</b> is that <b>he heats</b> the oven <b>and his wife bakes</b> quickly, before the small amount of wood they have is used up, <b>so too here;</b> when baking <i>matza</i>, <b>he heats the oven and his wife bakes</b> quickly so the dough doesn’t rise. This is why <i>matza</i> is called the poor man’s bread.

### Part 2
The mishna states that they bring the <i>ḥaroset</i> to the leader of the seder, <b>although</b> eating <b><i>ḥaroset</i> is not a mitzva.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And if</b> it <b>is not a mitzva, for what</b> reason does one <b>bring it</b> to the seder? <b>Rabbi Ami said:</b> It is brought <b>due to</b> the <b>poison</b> in the bitter herbs, which is neutralized by the <i>ḥaroset</i>. In this regard, <b>Rav Asi said:</b> The remedy for one who ate the <b>poison in lettuce</b> is to eat <b>a radish.</b> The remedy <b>for the poison in a radish</b> is <b>leeks.</b> The remedy for <b>the poison in leeks</b> is <b>hot</b> water. A remedy <b>for the poison in all</b> vegetables is <b>hot</b> water. The Gemara comments: <b>In the meantime,</b> while one is waiting for someone to bring him the remedy, <b>let him say</b> the following incantation: <b>Poison, poison, I remember you, and your seven daughters, and your eight daughters-in-law.</b>

### Part 3
The mishna states: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says</b> that eating <i>ḥaroset</i> is <b>a mitzva.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the nature of this <b>mitzva?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Levi says:</b> It is <b>in remembrance of the apple,</b> as apple is one of the ingredients in <i>ḥaroset</i>. The verse states: “Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, reclining upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you” (Song of Songs 8:5), which is an allusion to the Jewish people leaving Egypt. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <i>ḥaroset</i> is <b>in remembrance of the mortar</b> used by the Jews for their slave labor in Egypt. <b>Abaye said: Therefore,</b> to fulfill both opinions, one <b>must</b> prepare it <b>tart and</b> one <b>must</b> prepare it <b>thick.</b> One must prepare it <b>tart in remembrance of the apple, and</b> one <b>must</b> prepare it <b>thick in remembrance of the mortar.</b>

### Part 4
It <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> The <b>spices</b> used in the <i>ḥaroset</i> are <b>in remembrance of the hay</b> that our forefathers used for building in Egypt, and the <b><i>ḥaroset</i></b> itself <b>is in remembrance of the mortar. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, said:</b> When selling <i>ḥaroset</i>, <b>the small shopkeepers in Jerusalem would say as follows: Come and take spices for yourselves for</b> the <b>mitzva.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The attendants <b>poured the second cup for</b> the leader of the seder, <b>and here the son asks his father</b> the questions about the differences between Passover night and a regular night. <b>And if the son does not have the intelligence</b> to ask questions on his own, <b>his father teaches him</b> the questions.

### Part 6
The mishna lists the questions: <b>Why is this night different from all other nights? As on all other nights we eat leavened bread and <i>matza</i></b> as preferred; <b>on this night all</b> our bread is <b><i>matza</i>. As on all other nights we eat other vegetables; on this night</b> we eat <b>bitter herbs.</b> The mishna continues its list of the questions. When the Temple was standing one would ask: <b>As on all other nights we eat</b> either <b>roasted, stewed,</b> or <b>cooked meat,</b> but <b>on this night all</b> the meat is the <b>roasted</b> meat of the Paschal lamb. The final question was asked even after the destruction of the Temple: <b>As on all other nights we dip</b> the vegetables in a liquid during the meal only <b>once;</b> however, <b>on this night</b> we dip <b>twice.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And according to the intelligence</b> and the ability <b>of</b> the <b>son, his father teaches him</b> about the Exodus. When teaching his son about the Exodus. <b>He begins with</b> the Jewish people’s <b>disgrace and concludes with</b> their <b>glory. And he expounds from</b> the passage: <b>“An Aramean tried to destroy my father”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:5), the declaration one recites when presenting his first fruits at the Temple, <b>until he concludes</b> explaining <b>the entire section.</b>

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> If <b>his son is wise</b> and knows how to inquire, his son <b>asks him. And if he is not wise, his wife asks him. And if</b> even his wife is <b>not</b> capable of asking or if he has no wife, <b>he asks himself. And even</b> if <b>two Torah scholars who know the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover</b> are sitting together and there is no one else present to pose the questions, they <b>ask each other.</b>

### Part 9
The mishna states that one of the questions is: <b>Why is this night different from all other nights? As on all other nights we dip once;</b> however, <b>on this night</b> we dip <b>twice. Rava strongly objects to this</b> statement of the mishna: <b>Is that to say</b> that on <b>every</b> other <b>day there is no alternative</b> but to <b>dip once?</b> Is there an obligation to dip at all on other days, as indicated by the wording of the mishna? <b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is teaching: As on all other nights we are not obligated to dip even once;</b> however, <b>on this night</b> we are obligated to dip <b>twice.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rav Safra strongly objects to this</b> explanation: Is it <b>obligatory for the children?</b> As previously mentioned, the reason one dips twice is to encourage the children to ask questions. How can this be called an obligation? <b>Rather, Rav Safra said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is teaching: We do not</b> normally <b>dip even once;</b> however, <b>on this night</b> we dip <b>twice.</b> This wording is preferable, as it indicates the performance of an optional act.

### Part 11
It was taught in the mishna that the father <b>begins</b> his answer <b>with disgrace and concludes with glory.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>With disgrace? Rav said</b> that one should begin by saying: <b>At first our forefathers were idol worshippers,</b> before concluding with words of glory. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> The disgrace with which one should begin his answer is: <b>We were slaves.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Naḥman said to his servant, Daru:</b> With regard to <b>a slave who is freed by his master, who gives him gold and silver, what</b> should <b>the slave say to him?</b> Daru <b>said to him: He must thank and praise</b> his master. <b>He said to him:</b> If so, <b>you have exempted us from reciting</b> the questions of: <b>Why is this</b> night <b>different,</b> as you have stated the essence of the seder night. Rav Naḥman immediately <b>began to recite: We were slaves.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabban Gamliel would say: Anyone who did not say</b>
