### Part 1
<b>Rava said: The <i>halakha</i> is</b> that with regard to the prohibition against eating a mixture of <b>leavened bread during its time</b> of prohibition, i.e., during Passover, regardless of whether it is mixed <b>with its own type or with another type, it is forbidden,</b> even if <b>any amount</b> becomes mixed in, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav. Not during its time</b> of prohibition, but rather after the conclusion of Passover, regardless of whether the leavened bread was mixed <b>with its own type or with another type, it is permitted,</b> even when it gives flavor to the mixture. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who states that leavened bread owned by a Jew during Passover is permitted after Passover.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Did Rava</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that according to Rabbi Shimon, leavened bread owned by a Jew on Passover is permitted after Passover? <b>But didn’t Rava</b> himself <b>say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon imposed a penalty</b> forbidding one from deriving benefit from leavened bread owned by a Jew during Passover, <b>since he transgressed</b> the prohibition <b>it shall not be seen and</b> the prohibition <b>it shall not be found?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara resolves this challenge: <b>This</b> penalty <b>applies</b> only to leavened bread that is <b>in its pure</b> unadulterated form, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>a mixture, no,</b> one does not impose a penalty, even though the leavened bread is still extant. The Gemara adds: <b>And Rava follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> stated elsewhere, that indicates that he rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, <b>as Rava said: While we were</b> studying <b>in Rav Naḥman’s house,</b> on the evening <b>when the seven days of Passover had passed, he said to us: Go and buy leavened bread from the gentiles</b> who baked it on that day, the last day of Passover. Based on this story, it is clear that he maintained that one may eat leavened bread that was owned by a gentile during Passover.

### Part 4
<b>Rav said:</b> Earthenware <b>pots</b> in which leavened bread was cooked <b>during Passover</b> should <b>be broken,</b> as some small quantity of the flavor of the leavened bread was absorbed into the pot. It is therefore prohibited to cook in them again, as the forbidden flavor of this leavened bread would be transmitted to the new food. The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> was Rav so stringent with regard to these pots? <b>Let him retain</b> the pots until <b>after</b> the conclusion of <b>Passover and prepare</b> mixtures <b>of another type</b> of food <b>in them.</b> Even Rav maintains that when a small bit of leavened bread is mixed with another type of food after Passover, the mixture is permitted. The Gemara explains that he did not allow this due to <b>a rabbinic decree that perhaps one will come to prepare a mixture of the same type in</b> these pots, causing their contents to become prohibited. He therefore instructed that one destroy these pots in order to avoid this pitfall.

### Part 5
<b>And Shmuel said: They</b> need <b>not be broken. Rather, he</b> should <b>retain them until after its time,</b> i.e., the conclusion of Passover, <b>and</b> then he may <b>prepare</b> food of <b>either the same type or another type in them.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And Shmuel follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> stated elsewhere, <b>as Shmuel said to the pot merchants,</b> who would dramatically raise their prices after Passover: <b>Level the prices for your pots. And if</b> you do <b>not</b> bring your prices down, <b>I will teach you</b> that the <i>halakha</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> that one is permitted to derive benefit from leavened bread after Passover. This ruling would lead people to retain their vessels and desist from purchasing new vessels after Passover, and consequently the merchants would lose business.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Let him</b> indeed <b>teach</b> this ruling <b>to them, for Shmuel holds</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> as was previously mentioned. As such, why did he not publicize his opinion on the matter? The Gemara answers: <b>It was Rav’s locale,</b> and therefore it would not be appropriate for Shmuel to publicly present a position with which Rav did not agree. However, when he saw the merchants raising their prices in an unfair manner, he nevertheless threatened to make his opinion on the matter public.

### Part 8
The Gemara recounts: There was <b>a certain oven that they smeared with grease</b> from meat, and consequently the flavor of meat was absorbed into it, and then they used it to bake bread. <b>Rava bar Ahilai prohibited eating this bread even with salt,</b> and not just with milk. This status would apply <b>forever</b> to bread baked in this oven, even during subsequent baking, <b>lest one eat</b> such bread <b>with <i>kutaḥ</i>,</b> a dairy-based seasoning, which would be a violation of the prohibition against eating meat with milk.

### Part 9
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this statement: It was taught that <b>one</b> may <b>not knead the dough with milk, and if he</b> did <b>knead</b> the dough with milk, then <b>all of the bread is prohibited due to</b> concern that he will commit <b>a habitual transgression.</b> As one habitually eats bread with meat, there is a concern that one will come to eat this bread with meat as well, unwittingly transgressing the prohibition against eating meat with milk. <b>Similarly,</b>
