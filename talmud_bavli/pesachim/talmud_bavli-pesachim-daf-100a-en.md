### Part 1
<b>Perhaps</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>is corrupted,</b> and therefore it cannot serve as the basis of an objection.

### Part 2
<b>Mareimar said to him, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Yeimar: I happened to</b> come to <b>the</b> Festival <b>lecture of Rav Pineḥas, son of Rav Ami, and</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> who recited <b><i>mishnayot</i> stood up and taught</b> this <b><i>baraita</i> before him, and he accepted it.</b> This incident proves that the above version of the <b><i>baraita</i></b> is accepted and considered accurate. <b>If so,</b> the aforementioned objection to Rav Pappa’s opinion on the basis of the <b><i>baraita</i></b> remains <b>difficult. Rather,</b> Rav Pappa’s answer is insufficient, and <b>it is clear</b> that the mishna must be understood <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rav Huna.</b> In other words, the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, who maintains that although one may eat until dark on the eves of Shabbat and other Festivals, it is prohibited to eat on Passover eve from shortly before the lesser <b><i>minḥa</i></b> until nightfall.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the explanation of <b>Rav Huna, does it work out well? But didn’t Rabbi Yirmeya say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard <b>to the eve of Passover, and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> with regard <b>to the eve of Shabbat?</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara infers from the above statement: From the fact that it was necessary to say that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard <b>to the eve of Passover,</b> this proves <b>by inference that Rabbi Yosei disagrees with regard to both</b> cases, both the eves of Shabbat and other Festivals, as well as Passover eve. Consequently, it is impossible to ascribe to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei the mishna’s prohibition against eating on the eve of Passover, as he evidently permits one to eat until dark even on Passover eve.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>No;</b> the statement should be understood as follows: When it was said that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, this proves <b>by inference that they disagree with regard to interruption.</b> Even Rabbi Yosei agrees that one may not start eating on Passover eve from <i>minḥa</i> time onward, but he maintains that one who started to eat is not obligated to interrupt his meal even when the Festival begins.

### Part 6
<b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei disagree about interrupting a meal: If people were eating on the eve of Shabbat, <b>they</b> must <b>interrupt for <i>Shabbatot</i>,</b> meaning that once Shabbat begins, they must interrupt their meal, clear away the table, and recite the evening prayers and <i>kiddush</i> before continuing their meal; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> These diners need <b>not interrupt</b> their meal.

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> continues by relating a story: <b>And</b> there was <b>an incident involving Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Yosei, who were reclining</b> and eating together <b>in Akko</b> on Friday afternoon, <b>and the day</b> of Shabbat <b>was sanctified,</b> i.e., Shabbat began. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said to Rabbi Yosei: <i>Berabbi</i>,</b> a title for an important man of distinguished lineage, is it <b>your will that we</b> should <b>interrupt and be concerned for the statements of our colleague Yehuda,</b> who maintains that one is obligated to interrupt his meal?

### Part 8
<b>He said to him: Each and every day you cherish my statements before</b> those of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and rule in accordance with my opinion, <b>and now you cherish the statement of Rabbi Yehuda before me?</b> Rabbi Yosei continued by applying a verse to this situation: <b>“Will he even force the queen before me in the house?”</b> (Esther 7:8).

### Part 9
Rabban Shimon <b>said to him: If so,</b> if displaying concern for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion will be viewed as a halakhic ruling, <b>we will not interrupt,</b> as <b>perhaps the students will see</b> that we have broken off our meal <b>and will establish the <i>halakha</i> for generations</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. The Sages later <b>said: They did not move from there until they established the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> that one need not interrupt one’s meal on the eve of Shabbat and Festivals.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who said that one must interrupt one’s meal by removing the table entirely, <b>nor</b> is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who ruled that one need not interrupt one’s meal at all. <b>Rather,</b> one must <b>spread a cloth</b> over one’s table <b>and recite <i>kiddush</i>,</b> after which he may continue his meal. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Taḥalifa bar Avdimi say</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Just as one interrupts for <i>kiddush</i>,</b>
