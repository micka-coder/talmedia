### Part 1
The Gemara continues to discuss harmful spirits. <b>One who relieves himself on the stump of a palm tree will be seized by a spirit of</b> a pain of <b>half</b> his head, i.e., a migraine, <b>and one who places his head on the stump of a palm tree will be seized by a spirit of sickness. One who walks over a palm tree, if</b> the tree <b>is cut down, he</b> too <b>will be killed. If</b> that tree <b>is uprooted, he will</b> also <b>be uprooted and will die.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> statement <b>applies</b> only if <b>he does not place his legs upon it; however,</b> if <b>he places his legs upon it, we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara cites another statement with regard to shadows. There <b>are five</b> types of dangerous <b>shadows: The shadow of a single palm tree, the shadow of</b> a tree called <b><i>kanda</i>, the shadow of a caper-bush, and the shadow of</b> the <b>sorb</b> tree. <b>Some say: Also the shadow of a ship and the shadow of a willow. The</b> general <b>rule of the matter</b> is: <b>Whatever has many branches, its shadow is dangerous.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And any tree whose wood is hard, its shadow is dangerous, except for</b> the tree called <b><i>kero masa</i>. Although its wood is hard, its shadow is not dangerous, as the demon said to her son: Leave the <i>kero masa</i></b> tree <b>alone, as it</b> was <b>that</b> tree <b>that killed your father. And</b> the tree later <b>killed</b> the son too. The <i>kero masa</i> tree is harmful to demons. <b>Rav Ashi said: I saw that Rav Kahana avoided all</b> types <b>of shadows.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara comments: The demons <b>near the caper-bush</b> are called <b><i>ruḥei</i>.</b> A demon found <b>near the sorb trees</b> is called <b><i>shida</i>.</b> The demons found <b>on roofs</b> are called <b><i>rishfei</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <b>practical difference</b> of these definitions? It makes a difference <b>for</b> writing <b>an amulet</b> on behalf of one who has been harmed. It is necessary to know the name of the demon who caused the damage.

### Part 5
The Gemara further comments: The demon found <b>near the caper-bush</b> is <b>a creature with no eyes. What is</b> the practical halakhic <b>difference</b> of this observation? It is relevant with regard <b>to fleeing</b> from <b>it.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Once a Torah scholar went to relieve himself near a caper-bush. He heard</b> the demon <b>coming and fled from it. When</b> this evil spirit <b>went, it grabbed a palm tree</b> and got stuck there. <b>The palm tree dried out and</b> the demon <b>burst.</b>

### Part 6
It was stated above that the demons found <b>near the sorb tree</b> are called <b><i>sheidei</i>.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>This sorb</b> tree <b>that is close to the city</b> contains <b>no less than sixty demons.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <b>practical difference</b> of this statement? The Gemara answers: It is relevant <b>for writing an amulet</b> for this number.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates: <b>A certain ruler of a city walked and stood by a sorb</b> tree <b>that was near a city. Sixty <i>sheidei</i></b> demons <b>came upon him and he was in danger. One of the Sages who did not know that it was a sorb tree of sixty <i>sheidei</i> came and wrote him an amulet for one <i>shida</i></b> demon. That man <b>heard that there was a celebration inside</b> the tree, <b>and</b> the demons <b>were singing: The scarf of</b> the <b>Master is like that of a Torah scholar,</b> but <b>we checked the Master and he does not know</b> how to say <b><i>barukh</i>,</b> the blessing when donning a scarf. The demons were mocking him and saying that he did not know how to write an amulet. Another <b>one of the Sages, who knew that it was a sorb tree of sixty <i>sheidei</i>, came and wrote an amulet</b> against <b>sixty demons. He heard them saying: Clear your items away from here.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara discusses the <b><i>ketev meriri</i>,</b> a demon mentioned in the Torah (Deuteronomy 32:24). <b>There are two</b> types <b>of <i>ketev</i></b> demons, <b>one</b> that comes <b>before noon</b> in the morning <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> comes <b>in the afternoon.</b> The one <b>that</b> comes <b>before noon is called <i>ketev meriri</i>, and it appears in a jug of <i>kutaḥ</i>,</b> a Babylonian spice, and continuously <b>revolves around inside it.</b> The <i>ketev</i> <b>in the afternoon is called <i>ketev yashud tzaharayim</i></b> (Psalms 91:6), <b>and it appears inside the horn of a goat and revolves around inside it like a sifter.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara relates: <b>Abaye was coming and walking</b> along the street. <b>And Rav Pappa was walking on his right and Rav Huna, son</b> of <b>Rav Yehoshua,</b> was <b>on his left.</b> Abaye <b>saw a certain <i>ketev meriri</i> coming on his left side and he switched Rav Pappa to his left and Rav Huna, son</b> of <b>Rav Yehoshua, to his right. Rav Pappa said</b> to Abaye: And <b>I, what is different that you were not concerned about</b> any possible harm to <b>me?</b> Abaye <b>said to him: The time is in your favor.</b> You are wealthy and fortunate, and therefore I believe that you will most likely not be harmed by the demon.

### Part 10
The Gemara comments: <b>From the first of Tammuz to the sixteenth of</b> that month, these demons are <b>certainly found. From here onward</b> it is <b>uncertain whether they are found or whether they are not found. And they can be found in the shadow of a sea squill that has not grown a cubit, and in the shadow</b> of objects in the <b>morning and evening when</b> their length <b>is less than a cubit. And they are mostly</b> found <b>in the shadow of a privy.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rav Yosef said: These three matters cause blindness to the light</b> of one’s eyes: <b>One who combs his hair</b> when it is <b>dry, one who drinks</b> wine that is <b>dripping</b> from the barrel, <b>and one who puts on shoes when his feet are wet</b> after being washed.

### Part 12
If a food is <b>hanging in one’s house,</b> it <b>causes poverty.</b> This is <b>as people say</b> in a popular proverb: <b>He who hangs the basket hangs his sustenance,</b> i.e., he loses it. <b>And we said this only</b> about hanging <b>bread; however,</b> if one hangs <b>meat and fish, we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b> The reason is that <b>it is the common practice</b> to hang meat and fish. <b>Bran [<i>parei</i>] in the house causes poverty.</b> Bread <b>crumbs in the house cause poverty.</b> If these crumbs are spread throughout the house on <b>Shabbat nights,</b> i.e., Friday nights, <b>or on Tuesday nights,</b> when demons are present, <b>harmful spirits rest on them.</b>

### Part 13
<b>The administering angel</b> appointed over <b>food is called Nakid,</b> i.e., he is clean [<i>naki</i>] and particular about cleanliness. <b>The administering angel</b> appointed over <b>poverty is called Naval.</b> The angel appointed over food will not stay in a dirty place, while the angel appointed over poverty will thrive there. <b>A plate</b> placed <b>on a jug causes poverty. One who drinks water from a plate causes</b> eye <b>pain.</b> One <b>who eats cress without washing his hands will be afraid for thirty days.</b>
