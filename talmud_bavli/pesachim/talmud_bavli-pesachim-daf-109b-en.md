### Part 1
<b>A cubit, by a cubit, by a height of three cubits. And the Sages measured</b> the <b>measure</b> of <b>the water</b> necessary <b>for a ritual bath</b> at <b>forty <i>se’a</i>.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara cites a discussion related to the topic of measurements. <b>Rav Ashi said: Ravin bar Ḥinnana said to me: The table of the Temple,</b> upon which the shewbread was placed, <b>was</b> comprised of assembled <b>parts. For if it should enter your mind</b> that the table <b>was firmly connected</b> and could not be taken apart, <b>how could</b> the priests <b>immerse a cubit in a cubit?</b> The dimensions of the table were two cubits by one cubit, with a height of one and a half cubits. If the table contracted ritual impurity, it had to be immersed in a ritual bath. If a ritual bath contains an area of one cubit by one cubit, the table can fit inside only if it is dismantled.

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: <b>What is the difficulty? Perhaps</b> the priest <b>would immerse it in the sea that</b> King <b>Solomon built,</b> which was a very wide ritual bath, as it states: “And he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass” (I Kings 7:23). <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: The sea that Solomon built contained</b> the volume of water of <b>one hundred and fifty ritual purification baths.</b> It was certainly possible to immerse even large vessels in this sea.

### Part 4
We learned in the mishna that even with regard to the poorest of Jews, the charity distributors should <b>not</b> give <b>him less than four</b> cups of wine. The Gemara asks: <b>How could the Sages establish a matter through which one will come to</b> expose himself to <b>danger? But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person</b> should <b>not eat pairs,</b> i.e., an even number of food items; <b>and he</b> should <b>not drink pairs</b> of cups; <b>and he</b> should <b>not wipe himself with pairs; and he</b> should <b>not attend to his</b> sexual <b>needs in pairs.</b> The concern was that one who uses pairs exposes himself to sorcery or demons. Why would the Sages require one to drink an even number of cups and thereby place himself in a position of danger?

### Part 5
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>the verse said: “It was a night of watching</b> to the Lord” (Exodus 12:42), which indicates that Passover night <b>is a night that remains guarded from</b> demons and <b>harmful spirits</b> of all kinds. Therefore, there is no cause for concern about this form of danger on this particular night.

### Part 6
<b>Rava said</b> a different answer: <b>The cup of blessing</b> for Grace after Meals on Passover night is used in the performance of an additional mitzva and is not simply an expression of freedom. Therefore, <b>it combines</b> with the other cups <b>for the good,</b> i.e., to fulfill the mitzva to drink four cups, <b>and it does not combine for the bad.</b> With regard to the danger of drinking pairs of cups, it is as though one drinks only three cups. <b>Ravina said: The Sages instituted four</b> separate <b>cups,</b> each of which is consumed <b>in a manner</b> that demonstrates <b>freedom.</b> Therefore, <b>each and every one</b>
