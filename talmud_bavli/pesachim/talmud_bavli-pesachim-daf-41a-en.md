### Part 1
Did <b>the Master say</b> this statement <b>with regard to <i>ḥaroset</i>, or did the Master say</b> it <b>with regard to mustard? He said to him: What is</b> the <b>practical difference</b> whether he was referring to <i>ḥaroset</i> or mustard? Both of these are mentioned together, and the same <i>halakha</i> applies to both.

### Part 2
He said to him: There is a difference with regard <b>to that</b> which was stated by <b>Rav Kahana, as Rav Kahana said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis concerns a case in which flour was added <b>to mustard. However,</b> if flour was added <b>to <i>ḥaroset</i>, everyone agrees</b> that <b>it</b> must <b>be burned immediately.</b> Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak was asking Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehuda, whether he disagrees with Rav Kahana and maintains that the Rabbis dispute the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <i>ḥaroset</i> as well.

### Part 3
<b>He said to him: I did not hear</b> about this statement; <b>that is to say, I do not hold</b> in accordance with it. I do not distinguish between these two cases, as in my opinion the Rabbis permit one to eat even this <i>ḥaroset</i>.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ashi said: It is reasonable</b> to rule <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Kahana, from</b> the fact <b>that Shmuel said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who maintains that vinegar will prevent grain from becoming leavened. <b>What, isn’t it</b> correct to infer from here that vinegar added to flour <b>does not shrink</b> the grain and will <b>even leaven</b> it? According to this explanation, food that contains vinegar, e.g., <i>ḥaroset</i>, is likely to be leavened immediately, as claimed by Rav Kahana.

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <b>No,</b> this is no proof, as <b>perhaps</b> Shmuel meant that, according to the opinion of the Rabbis, vinegar will <b>neither cause</b> the wheat <b>to shrink nor leaven</b> it. Consequently, this statement cannot serve as a proof of the opinion of the Rabbis with regard to <i>ḥaroset</i>.

### Part 6
The mishna taught that <b>one</b> may <b>not boil</b> the Paschal lamb in liquid. To explain this issue, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that interprets the verse: “You shall not eat it partially roasted, nor boiled in any way in water, but roasted with fire; its head with its legs, and with the innards in it” (Exodus 12:9). <b>The Sages taught: “In water”; I have</b> derived <b>nothing other</b> than the prohibition against boiling the Paschal lamb <b>in water. From where</b> do I know that it is likewise prohibited to boil it in <b>other liquids?</b>

### Part 7
<b>You said</b> that this can be derived by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: And just as water, which does not temper the taste</b> of the food boiled in it, is <b>prohibited</b> for boiling the Paschal lamb, with regard to <b>other liquids, which do temper the taste</b> of the food boiled in them, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that it is prohibited to boil the Paschal lamb in them?

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi provides a different derivation and <b>says:</b> From the phrase <b>“In water,” I have</b> derived <b>nothing other</b> than the prohibition against boiling the Paschal lamb <b>in water. From where</b> do I learn that it is likewise prohibited to boil it in <b>other liquids? The verse states: “Nor boiled in any way,”</b> which means: <b>In any case,</b> i.e., boiling the Paschal lamb in any type of liquid is prohibited.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these two derivations? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them is</b> with regard to meat <b>that is roasted in a pot</b> without the addition of any liquid, but is cooked in its own juices. According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, it is prohibited to prepare the Paschal lamb in this manner, as this is considered boiling, whereas the Rabbis maintain that an action is classified as boiling only if one adds liquid to the meat.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> with regard to <b>that</b> phrase, <b>“boiled in any way,” what do they do with it?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>required for that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one boiled</b> the Paschal lamb <b>and afterward roasted it, or roasted it and afterward boiled it, he is liable</b> to receive lashes for boiling the Paschal lamb.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> if one <b>boiled</b> the Paschal lamb <b>and afterward roasted it, he is liable, as he boiled it</b> first and is punished for this act. <b>However,</b> if <b>he roasted it and afterward boiled it,</b> and <b>it is</b> a food that has been <b>roasted by fire, why</b> is he liable?

### Part 12
<b>Rav Kahana said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? It is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who maintains that boiling after roasting nullifies the previous act of roasting. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One can <b>fulfill</b> his obligation to eat <i>matza</i> <b>with a wafer that has been soaked</b> in water <b>or with a boiled</b> wafer <b>that has not</b> yet <b>dissolved;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says: One</b> can <b>fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with a wafer that has been soaked</b> in a cooked dish <b>but not with a boiled</b> wafer, <b>even if it has not dissolved.</b> Evidently, Rabbi Yosei maintains that food that was initially baked and subsequently boiled is no longer categorized as baked, and the same presumably applies to meat that was roasted and then boiled.

### Part 13
<b>Ulla said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to boiled <i>matza</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> there is no difficulty, as the cases of <i>matza</i> and the Paschal lamb are dissimilar in this regard. <b>Here,</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb, <b>it is different, as the verse states: “Nor boiled in any way,”</b> which indicates that it is prohibited to boil it <b>in any case.</b> No restriction of this kind is stated with regard to <i>matza</i>.

### Part 14
<b>The Sages taught:</b> I <b>might</b> have thought <b>that</b> if <b>one roasted</b> the Paschal lamb <b>fully, he</b> should <b>be liable.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall not eat it partially roasted, nor boiled in any way in water”</b> (Exodus 12:9). This verse teaches that <b>I,</b> God, <b>said to you</b> that the Paschal lamb is prohibited if it is <b>partially roasted or boiled in any way, but not</b> if <b>it is fully roasted.</b> One who roasts the Paschal lamb fully has not violated a prohibition.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case that render it necessary for a verse to teach that roasting the Paschal lamb fully is not a violation of a prohibition? <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> This is referring to a situation <b>where one burned it.</b> The verse indicates that even one who entirely burns the Paschal lamb does not violate this prohibition.

### Part 16
<b>The Sages taught:</b> I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one who ate an olive-bulk</b> portion of the Paschal sacrifice <b>raw</b> should <b>be liable</b> for violating a prohibition. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall not eat it partially roasted [<i>na</i>], nor boiled in any way in water.”</b> This verse <b>teaches</b> that <b>I,</b> God, <b>said to you</b> that it is prohibited to eat the Paschal lamb <b>partially roasted or boiled, but</b> there is <b>no</b> prohibition against eating <b>it raw.</b>

### Part 17
I <b>might</b> have thought <b>that it is permitted</b> to eat it raw <i>ab initio</i>. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “But roasted with fire”</b> (Exodus 12:9). This teaches that the mitzva is to roast the Paschal lamb with fire, <i>ab initio</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of cooking that are defined as <b><i>na</i>,</b> partially roasted? <b>Rav said: As the Persians say: <i>Avarnim</i>,</b> half roasted.

### Part 18
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: One who cooks</b> food <b>in the hot springs of Tiberias on Shabbat is exempt.</b> One violates the Shabbat prohibition of cooking only if he uses a fire. In the case of <b>a Paschal</b> lamb <b>that was cooked,</b> i.e., boiled, <b>in the hot springs of Tiberias,</b> one is <b>liable</b> for boiling the offering.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different with regard to Shabbat, that</b> one is <b>not</b> punished for cooking in this manner? The reason is <b>that</b> a fire, or <b>a fire derivative, is required</b> for an act to be defined as cooking on Shabbat, <b>but there is no</b> fire here, as the hot springs are not generated by fire. If so, <b>with regard to</b> the <b>Paschal</b> lamb <b>as well, it is not a fire derivative,</b> and it should not be considered boiling with regard to this prohibition either.

### Part 20
<b>Rava said: What is</b> the meaning of the word <b>liable that</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>taught?</b> It means <b>that</b> in doing so <b>one violated</b> the positive mitzva, <b>due to</b> that which is written: <b>“Roasted with fire.”</b> In other words, one who boils the Paschal lamb in the hot springs of Tiberias did not in fact violate the prohibition of boiling the Paschal lamb, but he has also not fulfilled the positive mitzva to roast the offering.

### Part 21
<b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Natan, teaches this</b> interpretation <b>of Rav Ḥisda’s</b> statement <b>explicitly,</b> i.e., that <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> himself <b>said: One who cooks in the hot springs of Tiberias on Shabbat is exempt, and</b> with regard to <b>a Paschal</b> lamb <b>that was cooked in the hot springs of Tiberias,</b> one <b>is liable</b> to receive punishment for this act. In doing so, <b>he violated</b> a positive mitzva, <b>due to</b> that which is written: <b>“Roasted with fire.”</b>

### Part 22
<b>Rava said:</b> One who <b>ate</b> the Paschal lamb <b>partially roasted,</b>
