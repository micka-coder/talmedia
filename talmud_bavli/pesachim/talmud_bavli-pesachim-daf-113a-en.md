### Part 1
<b>are</b> found <b>on the paths [<i>gazyata</i>]</b> near the city, <b>as horses</b> belonging to the demons <b>flee</b> along those paths, <b>and</b> the demons <b>come to lead them</b> away. Generally, however, demons do not enter inhabited places.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> Rav <b>said to Rav Asi: Do not live in a city where horses do not neigh and where dogs do not bark,</b> as these animals provide security and protection. <b>And do not live in a city where the mayor is a doctor,</b> as he will be too busy working to govern properly. <b>And do not marry two</b> women, as they will likely join forces against you. And <b>if you</b> do <b>marry two, marry a third</b> as well. If two of your wives plot against you, the third will inform you of their plans.

### Part 3
<b>Rav said to Rav Kahana:</b> It is better for one <b>to turn over a carcass than to turn over his word,</b> i.e., to break his promise. Rav further said: <b>Skin a carcass in the market and take payment, but do not say: I am a priest, or: I am a great man, and this matter disgusts me.</b> It is preferable for one to work, even in menial labor, than to be dependent on others. Rav also advised Rav Kahana: If <b>you ascend to the roof,</b> carry <b>your food with you.</b> One should always carry his sustenance with him, even if he goes only on a short trip. If <b>one hundred pumpkins in the city</b> cost <b>a <i>zuz</i>, place</b> them carefully under <b>the corners</b> of your clothes. Treat food respectfully even if it is inexpensive.

### Part 4
<b>Rav said to Ḥiyya, his son: Do not</b> get into the habit of <b>drinking medications,</b> lest you develop an addiction. <b>And do not leap over a ditch,</b> as you might hurt yourself in the process. <b>And do not pull out a tooth,</b> but try to heal it if possible. <b>And do not provoke a snake</b> in your house to try to kill it or chase it away. <b>And do not provoke a gentile,</b> as this too is dangerous.

### Part 5
Similarly, <b>the Sages taught:</b> There are <b>three</b> beings <b>one</b> should <b>not provoke: A small gentile, and a small snake, and a small</b> Torah <b>scholar. What is the reason? Because their authority stands behind their ears.</b> They will eventually grow up, assume power, each in his own way, and avenge those who have harassed them.

### Part 6
<b>Rav said to Ayvu, his son: I struggled</b> to teach <b>you <i>halakha</i> but</b> my efforts <b>did not succeed,</b> as you did not become a great scholar. <b>Come</b> and <b>I will teach you</b> about <b>mundane matters: Sell your merchandise while the dust</b> from the road is still <b>on your feet.</b> As soon you return from your travels, sell your wares, lest the prices fall in the meantime. Furthermore, it is possible that <b>anything you sell</b> might later cause you to <b>regret</b> the sale, <b>except for wine, which you</b> can <b>sell without regret.</b> Since wine might go bad and be entirely lost, its sale is always advisable.

### Part 7
Rav further advised his son: <b>Open your purse</b> to accept payment, and only then <b>open your sack</b> to deliver the goods, to ensure you will receive payment for your merchandise. It is better to earn <b>a <i>kav</i> from the ground than a <i>kor</i> from the roof.</b> A <i>kor</i> is one hundred and eighty times larger than a <i>kav</i>. This proverb means that it is preferable to earn a small amount from a local, safe transaction than to attempt to earn more through a distant, risky venture.

### Part 8
Rav continued: If there are <b>dates in your storeroom, run to the brewery</b> to sell them. If you wait, there is a good chance the dates will go bad. The Gemara asks: <b>And how many</b> dates should one keep for himself? <b>Rava said: Up to three <i>se’a</i>. Rav Pappa said: If I were not a beer manufacturer I would not have become wealthy. Some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Ḥisda who said: If I were not a beer manufacturer I would not have become wealthy.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the word <b><i>sudana</i>,</b> the Aramaic term for a brewer? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: A pleasant secret [<i>sod na’e</i>] and acts of loving kindness,</b> as brewing is a good way to make money and also enables one to perform good deeds.

### Part 9
The Gemara continues to offer advice about mundane matters. <b>Rav Pappa said: Anything</b> you acquire with a document <b>by means</b> of which ownership is transferred, i.e., a bill of acquisition or obligation, <b>requires collection,</b> despite the fact that you are the legal owner. <b>Any sale on credit is uncertain whether or not</b> it <b>will come</b> to fruition. <b>And</b> even <b>if it</b> does <b>come</b> to fruition, <b>the money is bad.</b> These funds are difficult to collect, and they are generally not paid on time.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said three matters, citing the people of Jerusalem: When you go to war do not go out first, but go out last.</b> The reason is <b>so that</b> if your side is defeated and you need to flee for your life, <b>you will enter</b> the refuge of the city <b>first. And</b> it is better to <b>make your Shabbat</b> like an ordinary <b>weekday and do not be beholden to</b> other <b>beings. And exert yourself</b> to join together <b>with one upon whom the hour smiles.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said three matters, citing the people of Jerusalem: Do not indulge in a shameful act</b> in public, <b>because of the incident that occurred</b> involving David and Bathsheba (see II Samuel 11–12). If <b>your daughter has grown up,</b> it is better to <b>free your</b> Canaanite <b>slave and give</b> him <b>to her</b> than to leave her to find a husband on her own. <b>And be careful with your wife with regard to her first son-in-law,</b> as she is especially fond of him. <b>What is the reason</b> for this warning? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Due to</b> the possibility of <b>licentiousness. Rav Kahana said: Due to</b> the fact that she might give him all your <b>money</b> and leave you impoverished. The Gemara comments: Since <b>either of these</b> could <b>happen,</b> it is best to be prudent.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Three</b> people are <b>among those who inherit the World-to-Come: One who lives in Eretz Yisrael; one who raises his sons to</b> engage <b>in Torah study; and one who recites <i>havdala</i> over wine at the conclusion of Shabbat.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the special importance of <b>that</b> mitzva, to recite <i>havdala</i> over wine? The Gemara answers: This is referring to an individual with only a small amount of wine, <b>who</b> nevertheless <b>leaves some of</b> his kiddush wine <b>for <i>havdala</i>.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> further <b>said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, proclaims about</b> the goodness of <b>three</b> kinds <b>of people every day,</b> as exceptional and noteworthy individuals: <b>About a bachelor who lives in a city and does not sin</b> with women; <b>about a poor person who returns a lost object to its owners</b> despite his poverty; <b>and about a wealthy person who tithes his produce in private,</b> without publicizing his behavior. The Gemara reports: <b>Rav Safra was a bachelor living in a city.</b>
