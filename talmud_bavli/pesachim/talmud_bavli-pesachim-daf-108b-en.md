### Part 1
<b>As they too were</b> included <b>in that miracle</b> of the Exodus, they are therefore obligated to participate in the celebration.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: These four cups must contain</b> enough undiluted wine to allow <b>for diluting a significant cup.</b> In talmudic times, people would not drink pure wine. They would dilute it with water, generally adding three times as much water as wine. If <b>one drank them undiluted,</b> he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. If <b>one drank them all at once,</b> i.e., he poured all four cups of wine into one large cup and drank it, he has <b>fulfilled</b> the obligation. If <b>one gave his sons or the members of his household to drink from them,</b> he has nevertheless <b>fulfilled</b> the obligation.

### Part 3
The Gemara now addresses each of these rulings of Shmuel in turn. Shmuel said that if <b>one drank them undiluted</b> he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>Rava said:</b> He has <b>fulfilled</b> the obligation to drink the four cups of <b>wine,</b> but he has <b>not fulfilled</b> the obligation to drink in a way that expresses <b>freedom,</b> which is the preferable way to fulfill the mitzva, as aristocrats do not drink undiluted wine.

### Part 4
If <b>one drank</b> the four cups <b>all at once, Rav said</b> that he has <b>fulfilled</b> the obligation to drink <b>wine</b> as an expression of rejoicing on the Festival, but he has <b>not fulfilled</b> the obligation to drink <b>four cups,</b> which requires four distinct cups, each drunk separately. Shmuel also stated that if <b>one gave his sons or the members of his household to drink from them,</b> he has nevertheless <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: And this is</b> the case only <b>if he</b> himself <b>drank the majority of the cup.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the above rulings from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These four cups must contain</b> one <b>quarter</b>-<i>log</i>, <b>whether</b> the wine <b>is undiluted or diluted, whether</b> it is <b>new or aged. Rabbi Yehuda says: It must have the taste and appearance of wine. In any event,</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching</b> that each cup must contain at least the amount <b>of</b> one <b>quarter-</b><i>log</i>, <b>and</b> yet <b>you said</b> that each must contain enough for diluting <b>a significant cup.</b>

### Part 6
<b>They say</b> in response that <b>this and that are one</b> and the same <b>measure.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the expression: <b>Enough for diluting a significant cup, which</b> Shmuel <b>said?</b> He meant that there must be enough undiluted wine <b>for each and every one</b> of the cups, i.e., one quarter-<i>log</i> of diluted wine. <b>This</b> amounts to one <b>quarter</b>-<i>log</i> of undiluted wine <b>for all of them</b> combined. A significant cup contains one quarter-<i>log</i>. This quarter-<i>log</i> is comprised of one quarter undiluted wine and three quarters water. Therefore, each cup must contain at least one quarter of one quarter-<i>log</i> of undiluted wine, so that one consumes a full quarter-<i>log</i> of liquid from each cup.

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> stated that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> the cup from which one drinks <b>must have</b> the <b>taste and appearance</b> of wine. <b>Rava said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda? As it is written: “Look not upon wine when it is red”</b> (Proverbs 23:31). This verse proves that the appearance of wine and not only its taste is important.

### Part 8
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All are obligated in these four cups, including men, women, and children. Rabbi Yehuda said: What benefit do children receive from wine?</b> They do not enjoy it. <b>Rather, one distributes to them</b>
