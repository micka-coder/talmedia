### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Reish Lakish said: That is to say</b> that <b>mitzvot require intent.</b> One who performs a mitzva must do so with the intent to fulfill his obligation. The proof of this from the mishna is that <b>since one does not eat</b> the lettuce <b>at the time of his obligation to</b> eat <b>bitter herbs,</b> he eats it after reciting only one blessing: <b>Who creates fruit of the ground. And</b> clearly the reason is that <b>perhaps he did not intend</b> to fulfill his obligation to eat <b>bitter herbs,</b> and <b>therefore</b> he <b>needs to dip it again for the purpose of bitter herbs. For if it could enter your mind</b> that <b>mitzvot do not require intent, why do you</b> need <b>two dippings? But he</b> has already <b>dipped</b> the lettuce <b>once.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>From where</b> do you know that this is the case? <b>Perhaps</b> I can say that <b>actually mitzvot do not require intent. And that which you said, why do I</b> need <b>two dippings,</b> perhaps the reason is <b>so that there</b> should <b>be a conspicuous</b> distinction <b>for the children,</b> which will cause them to inquire into the difference between this night and all others.

### Part 3
<b>And if you say:</b> If <b>so, let</b> the tanna <b>teach us</b> this halakha with regard to <b>other vegetables</b> as well, as there is no obvious reason that lettuce is chosen for this distinction. In response, I would say that had the mishna <b>taught us</b> about <b>other vegetables, I would have said</b> that it is only <b>where there are other vegetables that one requires two dippings,</b> one for the other vegetables and one for the bitter herbs; <b>however,</b> if one has <b>only <i>ḥazeret</i>, he does not require two dippings,</b> as one dipping is sufficient. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that <b>even</b> if one has just <b><i>ḥazeret</i> he requires two dippings, so that there be a conspicuous</b> distinction <b>for the children.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And furthermore, it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: On Passover, if <b>one ate</b> vegetables of <b>doubtfully tithed produce,</b> i.e., he bought the vegetables from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. If <b>he ate them without</b> the <b>intent</b> of the mitzva, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>If he ate them in halves,</b> by eating half an olive-bulk of bitter herbs, pausing, and then eating an additional half an olive-bulk, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation.

### Part 5
<b>And</b> the Gemara adds: With regard to this last case, one who eats an olive-bulk in halves, that is the <i>halakha</i>, <b>provided that he does not pause between eating</b> the first half an olive-bulk and <b>the other</b> half an olive-bulk <b>more than the time it takes to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread. If one takes longer than this amount of time, the two parts of bitter herbs cannot combine. This <i>baraita</i> indicates that even if one eats the bitter herbs without intention he has fulfilled his obligation, which presents a difficulty for Reish Lakish.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: The issue of whether or not mitzvot require intent <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Although one</b> has already <b>dipped the <i>ḥazeret</i></b> once, it is <b>a mitzva to bring before him <i>ḥazeret</i> and <i>ḥaroset</i>, and two cooked dishes.</b> Apparently, he lacked intention during his first consumption of lettuce, and therefore he must be given additional lettuce with which to fulfill his obligation.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And still</b> this is no conclusive proof, as <b>from where</b> do I know that Rabbi Yosei is of the opinion that mitzvot require intent? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Yosei maintains</b> that <b>mitzvot do not require intent, and</b> the reason <b>that we require two dippings is so that there</b> should <b>be a conspicuous</b> distinction <b>for the children.</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>If so,</b> for <b>what</b> reason does Rabbi Yosei use the term <b>mitzva?</b> There is no mitzva from the Torah to provide a distinction to stimulate the curiosity of the young ones. The mitzva is to eat bitter herbs, and evidently this individual must return and eat them again because he lacked intention the first time.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> are these <b>two cooked foods</b> mentioned in the mishna? <b>Rav Huna said: Beets and rice.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>Rava would seek beets and rice</b> for his meal on Passover night, <b>since</b> this ruling <b>came from Rav Huna’s mouth.</b> Although Rava realized that Rav Huna was merely citing examples and did not mean that one must eat those specific foods, he wanted to fulfill the statement of his teacher precisely.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Ashi said: Learn</b> incidentally another <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> this statement <b>of Rav Huna,</b> that there is <b>no</b> one <b>who is concerned about that</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri. As it was taught in</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: Rice is a type of grain</b> in all regards; <b>and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> eating it in <b>its leavened</b> state on Passover; <b>and one fulfills his obligation with it on Passover,</b> if it was properly baked into <i>matza</i>. It can be inferred from Rav Huna’s suggestion to use cooked rice, that rice cannot become leavened.

### Part 10
<b>Ḥizkiya said:</b> The two cooked foods can <b>even</b> be <b>fish and</b> the <b>egg that</b> that was fried <b>on it. Rav Yosef said:</b> One <b>requires two types of meat</b> on Passover night, <b>one in remembrance of the Paschal lamb and</b> the other <b>one in remembrance of the Festival</b> peace-offering, which was also eaten on Passover night. <b>Ravina said:</b> For the two cooked foods one may use <b>even</b> the meat on <b>the bone</b> and the <b>gravy</b> in which it was cooked.

### Part 11
With regard to the <i>halakha</i> of eating vegetables, the Gemara clarifies: It is <b>obvious</b> that <b>where there are other vegetables</b> available besides bitter herbs, at the first dipping <b>one recites over</b> the <b>other vegetables the blessing: Who creates fruit of the ground, and eats,</b> with the intention of including in this blessing the bitter herbs he will eat later. <b>And then,</b> at the second dipping, <b>he recites the blessing:</b> Commanded us over <b>eating bitter herbs,</b> on the lettuce <b>and eats</b> it.

### Part 12
However, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>where there is only lettuce</b> available? When should one recite each blessing? <b>Rav Huna said: One initially recites the blessing: Who creates fruit of the ground, over the bitter herbs,</b> i.e., the lettuce, <b>and eats</b> them. <b>And ultimately,</b> after the <i>matza</i>, <b>one recites the blessing:</b> Commanded us over <b>eating bitter herbs, over</b> the lettuce <b>and eats</b> it.
