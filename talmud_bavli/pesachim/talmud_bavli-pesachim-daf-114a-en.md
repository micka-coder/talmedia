### Part 1
The <b>Rabbi Yitzhak ben Aḥa</b> mentioned in a ruling <b>of <i>halakha</i> is</b> the same as the <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Pineḥas</b> who appears in statements <b>of <i>aggada</i>. And your mnemonic</b> to remember the names is the standard phrase: <b>Listen my brothers and friends [<i>shimu aḥai vere’ai</i>].</b> <i>Shimu</i> sounds like <i>shema’ta</i>, the term for <i>halakha</i>, while <i>aḥai</i> is similar to the patronymic ben Aḥa.

### Part 2
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said, citing Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Elai: Eat an onion [<i>batzal</i>] and sit in the shade [<i>batzel</i>],</b> i.e., eat inexpensive food while sitting in a comfortable place, <b>but do not eat</b> expensive <b>geese and chickens, as your heart will pursue you,</b> i.e., you will develop a taste for luxuries. Devote <b>less to your food and your drink and</b> spend <b>more on your house,</b> as one’s house is a better investment than food.

### Part 3
<b>When Ulla came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said</b> that <b>they say</b> the following <b>proverb in the west,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>One who eats a fat tail [<i>alita</i>] must hide in the attic [<i>aliyata</i>]</b> from creditors who think he is wealthy. <b>One who eats vegetables [<i>kakulei</i>] can lie down in the city’s garbage [<i>kiklei</i>]</b> without fear of others, as he is not in debt.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The <i>tanna</i> describes the beginning of the Passover seder. The attendants <b>poured</b> the wine of <b>the first cup</b> for the leader of the seder. <b>Beit Shammai say: One recites the blessing over the</b> sanctification of the <b>day,</b> i.e., the <i>kiddush</i> for the Festival: Who blesses Israel and the Festivals, <b>and thereafter he recites the blessing over the wine:</b> Who creates fruit of the vine. <b>And Beit Hillel say: One recites the blessing over the wine and thereafter recites the blessing over the day.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: These are the <b>matters</b> of dispute <b>between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a meal. Beit Shammai say:</b> When reciting <i>kiddush</i> over wine, <b>one recites a blessing over the</b> sanctification of the <b>day and thereafter recites a blessing over the wine, because the day causes the wine to come</b> before the meal. And Beit Shammai offer an additional reason. <b>The day has</b> already <b>been sanctified and the wine has not yet come.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And Beit Hillel say: One recites the blessing over the wine and thereafter recites a blessing over the day, because the wine causes <i>kiddush</i> to be recited.</b> Since one does not recite <i>kiddush</i> without wine or bread, clearly the wine is the primary feature of the ritual. <b>Alternatively, the blessing over wine is</b> recited <b>frequently and the blessing over the day is not</b> recited <b>frequently,</b> and there is a general principle: When <b>a frequent</b> practice <b>and an infrequent</b> practice coincide, <b>the frequent</b> practice <b>takes precedence</b> over the infrequent practice. The <i>Tosefta</i> concludes: <b>And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>What is alternatively?</b> Why did Beit Hillel cite an additional reason? The Gemara explains: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>there</b> Beit Shammai cite <b>two</b> reasons, <b>and here</b> Beit Hillel offer only <b>one;</b> therefore, Beit Hillel said <b>they are two</b> reasons here too: When <b>a frequent</b> practice <b>and an infrequent</b> practice coincide, <b>the frequent</b> practice <b>takes precedence</b> over the infrequent practice.

### Part 8
It was taught in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel.</b> The Gemara comments: It is <b>obvious</b> that this is so, <b>as a Divine Voice emerged</b> and proclaimed that the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel. Why was it necessary for the <i>Tosefta</i> to state that in this particular case the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with their opinion? The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that this <i>Tosefta</i> was taught <b>before the Divine Voice</b> emerged and proclaimed that principle.

### Part 9
And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead that this statement was indeed issued <b>after the Divine Voice</b> emerged, and the <i>Tosefta</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, who said</b> that <b>one disregards a Divine Voice</b> when deciding <i>halakha</i>. Just as Rabbi Yehoshua disregarded the Divine Voice in his dispute with Rabbi Eliezer, so too, one disregards the Divine Voice that proclaimed that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel. Therefore, it was necessary to state that the <i>halakha</i> is in fact in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel here.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The attendants <b>brought</b> vegetables <b>before</b> the leader of the seder prior to the meal, if there were no other vegetables on the table. <b>He dips the <i>ḥazeret</i></b> into water or vinegar, to taste some food <b>before he reaches the</b> dessert of <b>the bread,</b> i.e., the bitter herbs, which were eaten after the <i>matza</i>. <b>They brought before him <i>matza</i> and</b> <i>ḥazeret</i> <b>and <i>ḥaroset</i>, and</b> at least <b>two cooked dishes</b> in honor of the Festival. The <i>tanna</i> comments that this was the practice, <b>although</b> eating <b><i>ḥaroset</i> is not a mitzva</b> but merely a custom. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Tzadok says:</b> Actually, it is <b>a mitzva</b> to eat <i>ḥaroset</i>. <b>And in</b> the period when <b>the Temple</b> stood and they offered the Paschal lamb, <b>they brought before him the body of the Paschal lamb.</b>
