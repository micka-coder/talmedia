### Part 1
<b>The <i>tanna</i> is teaching</b> a series of <b>leniencies.</b> He taught only those aspects in which the Ninth of Av is more lenient than a communal fast. He did not teach those aspects in which it is more stringent. There was no attempt made to enumerate all the differences.

### Part 2
It was stated in the mishna: <b>And in all places Torah scholars are idle</b> and do not perform labor on the Ninth of Av, and according to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel one should always conduct himself like a Torah scholar in this regard and refrain from performing labor. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds</b> that <b>we are not concerned about presumptuousness</b> when a person conducts himself like a Torah scholar? <b>And</b> conversely, do <b>the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>we are concerned about presumptuousness? Didn’t we hear them</b> say <b>the opposite? As we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to the recitation of <i>Shema</i> on one’s wedding night, the Rabbis said that <b>if a groom wishes to recite <i>Shema</i> on the first night</b> despite his exemption, he may do so. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Not everyone who wishes to assume the reputation</b> of a God-fearing person <b>may assume</b> it, and consequently not everyone who wishes to recite <i>Shema</i> on his wedding night may do so. Their opinions in that mishna appear contrary to their opinions in the current mishna.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The</b> attribution of the <b>opinions is reversed</b> in one of the sources. <b>Rav Sheisha, son</b> of <b>Rav Idi, said: Do not reverse</b> either text, as it is possible to resolve the difficulty in another manner. The contradiction between the statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> here <b>and</b> the statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> there is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> on the Ninth of Av, <b>since everyone is performing labor and he is not performing labor,</b> his idleness is conspicuous and <b>appears like presumptuousness. However, there,</b> in the case of reciting <i>Shema</i> on one’s wedding night, <b>it does not appear like presumptuousness, as everyone is reciting</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>and he is also reciting</b> it with them.

### Part 4
Similarly, the contradiction <b>between</b> the statement of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> here <b>and</b> the statement of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> there is <b>not difficult. There,</b> in the case of reciting <i>Shema</i> on one’s wedding night, <b>it is that we require concentration, and it is clear to all</b> that <b>he is unable to concentrate</b> because of his preoccupation with the mitzva that he must perform. Therefore, if he recites <i>Shema</i> <b>it appears like presumptuousness.</b> It is as though he is announcing: I am able to concentrate although others in my situation are not. <b>However, here,</b> by not performing labor on the Ninth of Av <b>it does not appear like presumptuousness,</b> as people <b>say: It is</b> because <b>he has no labor</b> to perform. <b>Go out and see how many idle people there are in the marketplace,</b> even on days when it is permitted to perform labor.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Apropos the discussion of performing labor on Passover eve, differences in other customs were cited. <b>And the Rabbis say: In Judea,</b> people <b>would perform labor on Passover eves until midday, and in the Galilee</b> people <b>would not perform</b> labor on Passover eve <b>at all.</b> With regard to performing labor on <b>the night</b> before Passover eve, the night between the thirteenth and fourteenth of Nisan, <b>Beit Shammai prohibit</b> performing labor, <b>and Beit Hillel permit</b> doing so <b>until sunrise.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks with regard to the mishna: <b>Initially,</b> at the beginning of the chapter, the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> that in certain places there is merely a <b>custom</b> not to perform labor, <b>and</b> yet <b>ultimately,</b> in this latest mishna, <b>he taught that</b> according to the opinion of Beit Shammai, <b>it is prohibited</b> to perform labor. Apparently, performance of labor is not dependent on custom but is actually prohibited.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> since <b>that</b> first mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> and <b>this</b> current mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: In Judea they would perform labor on Passover eves until midday, and in the Galilee they would not perform</b> labor <b>at all. Rabbi Meir said to him: What proof</b> do you cite <b>from Judea and the Galilee to</b> the discussion <b>here? Rather,</b> in <b>a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed to perform labor, one performs</b> labor, <b>and</b> in <b>a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed not to perform</b> labor, <b>one does not perform</b> labor. The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Meir is speaking</b> about <b>custom, by inference, Rabbi Yehuda is speaking</b> about a <b>prohibition</b> against performing labor in the Galilee.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yehuda hold that performance of labor on the fourteenth is permitted</b> everywhere other than the Galilee? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>one who is weeding</b> a field on <b>the thirteenth</b> of Nisan <b>and</b> a stalk of grain <b>was uprooted in his hand, he plants it in a muddy place</b> so that it will take root before the <i>omer</i> offering is brought on the sixteenth of Nisan? It will then be permitted to eat the grain after the <i>omer</i> offering is brought. However, <b>one</b> should <b>not plant it in a dry place,</b> as it will not take root there immediately. If it begins to sprout only after the <i>omer</i> offering is brought, that grain will remain prohibited until after the following year’s <i>omer</i> offering is brought.

### Part 9
From Rabbi Yehuda’s statement it can be inferred that if a person was weeding <b>on the thirteenth</b> of Nisan, <b>yes,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i>; however, <b>on the fourteenth</b> of Nisan, <b>no,</b> one may not replant the stalk of grain. <b>Now, we learned</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Any graft that does not take hold within three days will no longer take hold. If it could enter your mind</b> that <b>performing labor on the fourteenth is permitted, why</b> do <b>I</b> need this <i>halakha</i> to be taught specifically with regard to the <b>thirteenth?</b> It would have been a greater novelty had he taught the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case that occurs on the fourteenth. <b>Aren’t there</b> three days remaining for grain planted on the fourteenth to take root before the <i>omer</i> offering, i.e., <b>the fourteenth</b> of Nisan, <b>the fifteenth</b> of Nisan, <b>and part of the sixteenth</b> of Nisan? <b>Rava said: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> of replanting a stalk of wheat with regard to <b>the Galilee;</b> as mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Yehuda says that in the Galilee they do not perform labor at all.

### Part 10
The Gemara further asks: <b>Isn’t there the night</b> between the thirteenth and the fourteenth of Nisan, during which according to the opinion of Beit Hillel, labor is permitted even in the Galilee, which is the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yehuda could have taught the <i>halakha</i> with regard to weeding on the night before the fourteenth. <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> Rabbi Yehuda said this <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> who prohibit performing labor that night. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> There is no reason to suggest implausibly that Rabbi Yehuda holds in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai, contrary to the accepted <i>halakha</i>. <b>Actually,</b> Rabbi Yehuda holds in accordance <b>with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel.</b> However, he did not teach the case about the night before the fourteenth of Nisan <b>because it is not the</b> typical <b>manner of people to weed at night.</b> It is virtually impossible to identify weeds in the dark.

### Part 11
<b>Ravina said: Actually,</b> it can be explained that Rabbi Yehuda is referring <b>to Judea.</b> With regard to a plant <b>taking root, we state</b> only <b>once</b> the principle: The legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that of <b>the entire</b> day, but we <b>do not state twice</b> the principle: The legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that of <b>the entire</b> day. When discussing a plant that was replanted on the fourteenth, in the tally of three days, the legal status of part of both the fourteenth and the sixteenth cannot be like that of entire days. A plant takes root after a fixed amount of time, and this is not affected by formalistic halakhic principles like: The legal status of part of the day is like that of the entire day.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> With regard to <b>any labor that one began before the fourteenth</b> of Nisan, <b>he may complete it on the fourteenth</b> before midday. <b>However, one</b> may <b>not begin</b> to perform that labor <b>from the outset on the fourteenth, even if he is able to complete it</b> before midday. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The practitioners of only <b>three crafts</b> are permitted to <b>perform labor until midday on Passover eve, and they are: Tailors, barbers, and launderers,</b> whose work is needed for the Festival. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: Even shoemakers</b> are permitted to work on the fourteenth.

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Was it with regard to labor <b>for the purpose of the Festival</b> that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that Rabbi Meir permits completing labor on the fourteenth, <b>but</b> labor <b>that is not for the purpose of the Festival may not even be completed? Or perhaps</b> it was with regard to labor <b>that is not for the purpose of the Festival</b> that <b>we learned</b> that Rabbi Meir permits completing labor on the fourteenth, <b>but</b> with regard to labor <b>that is for the purpose</b> of the Festival, <b>we</b> may even <b>initiate</b> it. <b>Or perhaps,</b> with regard to <b>both</b> labor <b>that is for the purpose of the Festival and</b> labor <b>that is not for the purpose</b> of the Festival, <b>completing, yes,</b> it is permitted, but <b>initiating, no,</b> it is prohibited.

### Part 14
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from that which we learned: <b>However, one may not begin</b> work <b>from the outset on the fourteenth, even</b> if it is <b>a small belt, or even a small hairnet. What</b> is the meaning of the term <b>even</b> in this context? <b>Isn’t it</b> that <b>even</b> with regard to <b>those</b> items <b>that are for the purpose of the Festival, completing, yes,</b> it is permitted, but <b>initiating, no,</b> it is prohibited? And <b>by inference,</b> with regard to labor <b>that is not for the purpose</b> of the Festival, <b>we may not even complete</b> labor that was begun previously. This supports the first possibility cited above.

### Part 15
The Gemara rejects this answer: <b>No; actually</b> this means that even labor <b>that is not for the purpose</b> of the Festival <b>we</b> may <b>also complete,</b> in accordance with the third possibility above. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the term <b>even?</b> It is that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even</b> to <b>these</b> items, a belt and a hairnet, <b>which are small; as it could enter your mind to say:</b> Since they are small and <b>their initiation is their completion, let us even initiate</b> their manufacture on the fourteenth <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> Therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> that even with regard to this type of labor, initiating is prohibited. This <i>baraita</i> does not provide an unequivocal resolution to the dilemma.

### Part 16
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the resolution to the dilemma from another source from another source. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> With regard to <b>any labor that is for the purpose of the Festival,</b>
