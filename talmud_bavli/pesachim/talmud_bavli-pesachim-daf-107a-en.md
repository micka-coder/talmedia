### Part 1
<b>Rava said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that one who <b>tasted</b> food before <i>kiddush</i> may <b>recite <i>kiddush</i>; and</b> one who <b>tasted</b> food before <i>havdala</i> may <b>recite <i>havdala</i>; and one who did not recite <i>kiddush</i> on Shabbat eve,</b> at night, may <b>recite <i>kiddush</i> any time</b> during <b>the entire day until the conclusion of Shabbat.</b> Likewise, <b>one who did not recite <i>havdala</i> at the conclusion of Shabbat</b> may <b>recite <i>havdala</i> any time</b> during <b>the entire week,</b> i.e., during the first three days of the week, the time period called: After Shabbat.

### Part 2
<b>Ameimar began this teaching of Rava in this</b> emended <b>formulation: Rava said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that one who <b>tasted</b> food before <i>kiddush</i> may <b>recite <i>kiddush</i>;</b> and one who <b>tasted</b> food before <i>havdala</i> may <b>recite <i>havdala</i>;</b> and <b>one who did not recite <i>kiddush</i> on Shabbat eve,</b> at night, may <b>recite <i>kiddush</i> any time</b> during <b>the entire day. One who did not recite <i>havdala</i> at the conclusion of Shabbat</b> may <b>recite <i>havdala</i> any time</b> during <b>the entire day</b> of Sunday, but no later.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates that <b>the Mar Yanuka,</b> the younger Mar, <b>and Mar Kashisha,</b> the elder Mar, both <b>sons of Rav Ḥisda, said to Rav Ashi: Once Ameimar happened to</b> come to <b>our place and we did not have wine</b> for <i>havdala</i>. <b>We brought him beer and he did not recite <i>havdala</i>, and he passed the night fasting,</b> as it is prohibited to eat before <i>havdala</i>. <b>The next day we exerted ourselves and brought him wine, and he recited <i>havdala</i> and tasted some</b> food. <b>The next year he again happened</b> to come <b>to our place.</b> Once again <b>we did not have wine</b> and <b>we brought</b> him <b>beer. He said: If so,</b> if it is so difficult to obtain wine in your place, beer <b>is the wine of the province. He recited <i>havdala</i></b> over the beer <b>and tasted some</b> food.

### Part 4
The Gemara notes that one may <b>learn from</b> Ameimar’s conduct <b>three</b> <i>halakhot</i>: <b>Learn from it</b> that <b>one who recites <i>havdala</i> in the prayer</b> service <b>must recite <i>havdala</i></b> again <b>over a cup,</b> as Ameimar had presumably recited the paragraph of <i>havdala</i> in his <i>Amida</i> prayer. <b>And learn from it</b> that <b>it is prohibited for a person to eat before he recites <i>havdala</i>. And learn from it</b> that <b>one who did not recite <i>havdala</i> at the conclusion of Shabbat</b> may <b>recite <i>havdala</i> anytime</b> during <b>the entire week,</b> i.e., during the first three days of the week.

### Part 5
In the above story, Ameimar refused to recite <i>havdala</i> over beer. The Gemara addresses this issue at greater length. <b>Rav Huna raised a dilemma before Rav Ḥisda: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether it is permitted <b>to recite <i>kiddush</i> over date beer? He said: Now, if</b> with regard to <b>barley beer, fig beer, and</b> beer produced from <b>berries, I raised a dilemma before Rav</b> as to whether or not they may be used for <i>kiddush</i>, <b>and Rav</b> had previously raised this dilemma <b>before Rabbi Ḥiyya, and Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> had inquired <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and he did not resolve it for him,</b> as he could not find a source that clearly permits it, <b>is it necessary to say that date beer,</b> which is inferior to those other types of beer, may not be used for <i>kiddush</i>?

### Part 6
Those who heard this response <b>understood from it</b> that <b>it is <i>kiddush</i> that one</b> may <b>not recite over it, but one</b> may <b>recite <i>havdala</i></b> over date beer. <b>Rav Ḥisda said to them</b> that <b>Rav said as follows: Just as one</b> may <b>not recite <i>kiddush</i> over</b> date beer, <b>so one</b> may <b>not recite <i>havdala</i> over it. It was also stated</b> that <b>Rav Taḥalifa bar Avimi said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Just as one</b> may <b>not recite <i>kiddush</i> over</b> date beer, <b>so one</b> may <b>not recite <i>havdala</i> over it.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara relates that <b>Levi sent Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>a beer of thirteen soakings,</b> i.e., thirteen batches of dates had been soaked in water until it had thoroughly absorbed the taste of the dates. This was considered a high-quality beer. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>tasted it</b> and <b>it was especially pleasant. He said:</b> A beer <b>like this is fit to recite <i>kiddush</i> over and to say upon it all the songs and praises in the world,</b> as it is as good as wine. <b>At night, it</b> disrupted his digestion and <b>caused him pain. He said: It pains</b> on the one hand <b>and soothes</b> on the other.

### Part 8
With regard to the discomfort caused by beer, the Gemara cites related statements of <i>amora’im</i>. <b>Rav Yosef said: I will take a vow in public,</b> which cannot be nullified, <b>that I will not drink beer</b> due to its negative effects, despite the fact that beer was a popular beverage in Babylonia. <b>Rava said: I would</b> rather <b>drink water</b> used for <b>soaking</b> flax, <b>and I will not drink beer.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And Rava said: One who recites <i>kiddush</i> over beer, his</b> regular <b>drink should be beer.</b> In other words, the fitting punishment for one who recites <i>kiddush</i> over beer, the poor man’s drink in Babylonia, is for him to become poor himself and have to drink beer on a regular basis. The Gemara relates that <b>Rav</b> was <b>found</b> by <b>Rav Huna reciting <i>kiddush</i> over beer. He said to him: Abba,</b> Rav’s first name, <b>has started to acquire coins with beer.</b> As Rav recently began selling beer, it has become his favorite beverage, to the extent that he uses it for <i>kiddush</i>.

### Part 10
<b>The Sages taught: One</b> may <b>recite <i>kiddush</i> only over wine, and one</b> may <b>recite blessings only over wine.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>Is that to say that one does not say the blessing: By Whose word all things [<i>shehakol</i>] came to be, over beer and water? Abaye said: This is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: One only says: Bring a cup of blessing to recite the blessing</b> of Grace after Meals, <b>over wine. The Rabbis taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> may <b>not recite <i>kiddush</i> over beer. In the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, they said</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>recite <i>kiddush</i></b> over beer.

### Part 11
With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that one who recites <i>kiddush</i> must drink from the cup, the Gemara states that one fulfills the mitzva of <i>kiddush</i> <b>by tasting any amount of wine. Rabbi Yosei, son of Yehuda, says</b> that one must drink at least <b>a cheekful. Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said, and Rav Giddel from</b> the city of <b>Neresh likewise teaches: One who recites <i>kiddush</i> and tastes a cheekful has fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>and if not,</b> he <b>has not fulfilled</b> his obligation.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: I teach this</b> <i>baraita</i> in a precise manner, and I do <b>not</b> mention <b>Giddul bar Menashya, nor Giddul bar Minyumei, but rather</b> the <b>plain</b> name <b>Giddul,</b> without any identifying moniker. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <b>practical difference</b> in Rav Giddel’s name? The Gemara answers: <b>To raise a contradiction</b> between one of <b>his</b> rulings and another one of <b>his</b> rulings. Since it is not clear exactly which Sage issued this ruling, it is impossible to prove that he reversed or contradicted his opinion in a later statement.

### Part 13
The Gemara returns to the mishna, which stated that it is prohibited to eat <b>adjacent to <i>minḥa</i> time</b> on Passover eve. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages in the study hall: Did <b>we learn</b> in the mishna that it is prohibited to eat <b>adjacent to</b> the time of the <b>greater <i>minḥa</i> [<i>minḥa gedola</i>],</b> which is half an hour after midday, <b>or perhaps we learned</b> in the mishna that it is prohibited to eat <b>adjacent to</b> the time of the <b>lesser <i>minḥa</i> [<i>minḥa ketana</i>],</b> two and a half hours before sunset?

### Part 14
The Gemara elaborates: Did <b>we learn</b> in the mishna that it is prohibited to eat <b>adjacent to</b> the time of <b>the greater <i>minḥa</i>,</b> and this is <b>because of the Paschal lamb, lest one come to be drawn after</b> the meal and spend a long time eating, as was typical for large meals,
