### Part 1
<b>“You may not sacrifice the Paschal lamb in any one of your cities”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:5). Rabbi Elazar ben Matya derived from the expression “in any one” that one person cannot be the determining factor in whether the community sacrifices the Paschal lamb in a state of ritual purity or impurity.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even</b> if <b>one tribe</b> is <b>ritually impure and all the rest of the tribes</b> are <b>pure, those</b> tribes who are ritually pure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves</b> in a state of purity, <b>and those</b> members of the tribe that is impure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves</b> in a state of ritual impurity. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He holds</b> that <b>one tribe is called a community,</b> and a community may sacrifice the Paschal lamb in a state of impurity.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> if <b>one tribe is impure and all the rest of the tribes are pure,</b> all the tribes may <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity, as a communal offering is not divided.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>one tribe is called a community, and</b> since an entire community is impure, it is considered as though <b>half</b> the Jewish people were pure <b>and half</b> were impure. <b>And a communal offering is not divided.</b> Therefore, <b>all of them may perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b>

### Part 4
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disputed the following issue: If <b>the Jewish people were</b> divided, and exactly <b>half</b> were <b>pure and half</b> were <b>impure, Rav said: They render impure one of</b> those who was pure <b>with a creeping animal.</b> The majority of the people will then be ritually impure and they may all sacrifice the Paschal lamb in a state of ritual impurity.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> do so? <b>Let those</b> who are pure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on their own</b> in a state of purity <b>and those</b> who are impure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on their own</b> in a state of impurity. <b>Didn’t Rav</b> himself <b>say:</b> If half the community is ritually pure and half is ritually impure, <b>those</b> who are pure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves and those</b> who are impure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves? Say</b> in answer to this question: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a unique circumstance <b>where the ritually impure outnumbered the ritually pure</b> by <b>one</b> person.

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>If so, the majority</b> of the community <b>is impure.</b> Therefore, <b>let them all perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>in</b> a state of <b>impurity.</b> The Gemara answers: Rav <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Matya, who said: An individual cannot tip</b> the balance of <b>the community toward ritual impurity.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so, our question has returned to its place.</b> If this situation is considered half and half, <b>let those</b> who are pure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on their own</b> in a state of purity <b>and those</b> who are impure perform the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on their own</b> in a state of impurity.

### Part 7
<b>Rather, this is</b> what Rav <b>said: If there is a <i>tanna</i> who holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>, who said that</b> in a case where <b>half</b> the community is pure <b>and half</b> is impure, <b>they do not all perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>in</b> a state of <b>impurity, and</b> also <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> that <b>a communal offering is not divided,</b> there is no way to solve the problem other than to <b>render impure one of</b> those who were pure <b>with a creeping animal.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And Ulla said:</b> They do not render one of them impure with a creeping animal. Rather, <b>they send one of them</b> who is pure <b>to a distant place,</b> so that the majority of the community that is present at the Temple will be ritually impure, and they will all sacrifice the Paschal lamb in a state of ritual impurity. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let them render him impure with a creeping animal</b> as Rav said, which is easier to implement.

### Part 9
The Gemara responds: Ulla <b>holds</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>slaughter</b> the Paschal lamb <b>and sprinkle</b> its blood even <b>for someone</b> who is <b>ritually impure from a creeping animal</b> because he can become ritually pure by the evening and eat from the Paschal lamb. Therefore, rendering someone impure with a creeping animal does not disqualify him from participating in the Paschal lamb in a state of purity.

### Part 10
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let them render him impure with a corpse,</b> which causes ritual impurity for seven days. The Gemara responds that this solution is not implemented because <b>you</b> would <b>defer him from his Festival peace-offering.</b> Since he would be impure for the entire Festival, he would be unable to sacrifice a Festival peace-offering, which is the peace-offering brought by each person who visits the Temple on the Festival. He would needlessly be prevented from performing a mitzva.

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges this response: <b>Now, too,</b> by sending one pure person to a distant place, <b>you disqualify him from</b> sacrificing <b>his Paschal lamb</b> and prevent him from performing a mitzva. The Gemara answers: His sacrifice of the Paschal lamb will not necessarily be totally disqualified. <b>It is possible that he will perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>.

### Part 12
The Gemara challenges this response: <b>With regard to</b> ritual impurity from <b>a corpse also, it is possible that he will perform</b> the ritual of the Festival peace-offering <b>on the seventh</b> day of Passover, <b>which is his eighth day</b> of ritual impurity, since he became impure on the eve of Passover. He can become ritually pure by the seventh day and still sacrifice a Festival peace-offering.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>Ulla holds</b> that <b>all</b> the days of the Festival on which one may sacrifice a Festival peace-offering <b>are redress for</b> what one was obligated but unable to bring on <b>the first</b> day. Therefore, <b>one who is fit</b> to bring the offering <b>on the first</b> day <b>is fit on all of them, and whenever one is not fit on the first</b> day, <b>he is not fit on all of them.</b> Consequently, one who is impure on the first day of the Festival is unable to sacrifice a Festival peace-offering the rest of the Festival.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Naḥman said to</b> the students: <b>Go and say to Ulla</b> that his solution is not practical. <b>Who will listen to uproot his pegs and tent and run</b> to a distant place?

### Part 15
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> discussed the following matter: If <b>the majority of</b> the public <b>were <i>zavim</i> and a minority of them were ritually impure from</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse,</b> what should they do? The <i>halakha</i> is that even if the majority of the public has the status of <i>zavim</i>, they may not sacrifice the Paschal lamb in a state of impurity. <b>Rav said: Those</b> who are <b>impure from</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse do not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>or on the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>.

### Part 16
Rav explains: On the <b>first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>they do not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>because they are the minority, and the minority may not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> in a state of impurity. <b>On the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>they also do not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb because <b>whenever the community performs</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>the individual performs</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on the second.</b> Conversely, <b>whenever the community does not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>the individual does not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>.

### Part 17
<b>Shmuel said to</b> those who informed him of Rav’s ruling: <b>Go and say to</b> Rav, whose first name was <b>Abba: What do you do with</b> the following verse: <b>“Let the children of Israel offer the Paschal lamb in its appointed time”</b> (Numbers 9:2)? Rav <b>said to</b> those who transmitted Shmuel’s objection: <b>Go and say to him: When they are all <i>zavim</i>, what do you do? Rather,</b> you are forced to say that <b>since it is impossible</b> to fulfill the mitzva, <b>it is impossible. Here, too, it is impossible.</b>

### Part 18
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> discussed the following matter: <b>The majority of</b> the public <b>were ritually impure from</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse</b> on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>, so that the Paschal lamb is sacrificed in a state of impurity, <b>and a minority of them were <i>zavim</i>,</b> whose impurity does not permit them to sacrifice the Paschal lamb on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>.

### Part 19
In a case where the <i>zavim</i> became pure in time for the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>Rav Huna said: There is no redress for a Paschal lamb that is brought in ritual impurity.</b> Since the Paschal lamb was sacrificed in a state of impurity on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>, it cannot be sacrificed on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> that year. <b>And Rav Adda bar Ahava said: There is redress for a Paschal lamb that is brought in</b> a state of <b>impurity.</b> Therefore, one who was unable to participate when the public sacrificed the Paschal lamb in a state of impurity may still bring the Paschal lamb on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>.

### Part 20
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that they disagree about the following:</b> Rav Huna, <b>the one who said there is no redress for a Paschal lamb that is brought in</b> a state of <b>impurity, holds</b> that <b>ritual impurity is</b> merely <b>overridden in</b> cases involving <b>the public.</b> It is not fully permitted. Therefore, although those who are impure are deferred to the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> when the Paschal lamb is brought in a state of purity, there is no indication that the same is true when it is brought on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i> in a state of impurity.

### Part 21
Conversely, Rav Adda bar Ahava, <b>the one who said there is redress for a Paschal lamb that is brought in ritual impurity, holds</b> that <b>ritual impurity is</b> wholly <b>permitted in</b> cases involving <b>the public.</b> Therefore, it is considered as though the Paschal lamb were sacrificed on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i> in a state of purity, and those who were unable to sacrifice the Paschal lamb on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i> sacrifice it on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>.

### Part 22
<b>Say: No,</b> it is unnecessary to accept this assumption. It is possible that <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>ritual impurity is overridden in</b> cases involving <b>the public, and they disagree about this</b> other issue: This <b>Master,</b> Rav Huna, who said there is no redress, <b>holds:</b>
