<b>and he will end up refraining from performing the Paschal lamb? Or perhaps we learned</b> this <i>halakha</i> in the mishna as pertaining to the time <b>adjacent to the lesser <i>minḥa</i>, and</b> the reason for the prohibition is <b>due to <i>matza</i>.</b> If one eats shortly before nightfall, <b>perhaps he will come to eat the <i>matza</i></b> as an act of <b>excessive eating,</b> when one forces himself to eat despite the fact that he has no desire to do so.

### Part 2
<b>Ravina said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Even King Agrippa, who regularly eats</b> every day <b>at nine hours,</b> i.e., three hours before sunset, <b>on that day</b> of Passover eve, <b>he</b> may <b>not eat until dark.</b> Ravina infers from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that it is prohibited to eat <b>adjacent to the lesser <i>minḥa</i>, this is</b> why his actions are accounted to <b>the greatness of Agrippa,</b> as he refrained from eating despite the fact that the prohibition had not yet gone into effect.

### Part 3
<b>However, if you say</b> that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that one may not eat <b>adjacent to the greater <i>minḥa</i>, what is the greatness of Agrippa?</b> The <b>prohibition</b> against eating had already <b>taken effect at the outset,</b> right after midday. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that it is prohibited to eat <b>adjacent to the lesser <i>minḥa</i>,</b> and Agrippa was praised for changing his regular routine, despite the fact that he was not obligated to do so.

### Part 4
However, the question still remains: <b>Ultimately, what is the greatness of Agrippa? The time of the prohibition had arrived.</b> Although the ninth hour begins shortly before the prohibition goes into effect, Agrippa’s meal would presumably extend into the time when it is prohibited to eat, and therefore it was indeed prohibited for him to start his meal at the regular time. The Gemara answers: Since Agrippa was accustomed to eating in the afternoon, it might have been thought that he should be permitted to eat at this hour on Passover eve as well. <b>Lest you say</b> that since Agrippa would not eat during the morning like most people, <b>nine hours for Agrippa is considered like four hours for us,</b> the <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that we do not distinguish between Agrippa and anyone else in this regard.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> It is prohibited to eat a proper meal from <i>minḥa</i> time onward; <b>however, one</b> may <b>dip</b> and eat <b>types of refreshments,</b> e.g., fruit or meat that do not constitute a full meal and will not fill one’s stomach. The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> would <b>dip</b> and eat <b>vegetables. That</b> opinion, that it is permitted to snack after <i>minḥa</i> time on Passover eve, <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: During the afternoon of Passover eve, <b>the waiter</b> may <b>dip in the intestines</b> of the animals that had been slaughtered in preparation for the Festival meals <b>and place them before the guests</b> who had registered for the Paschal lamb. This was done to whet their appetites, so they would eat the Paschal lamb and <i>matza</i> that evening with greater relish.

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And although there is no</b> absolute <b>proof for</b> this <b>matter,</b> there <b>is an allusion to</b> this <b>matter,</b> as <b>it is stated: “Break up for yourselves a fallow ground, and do not sow among thorns”</b> (Jeremiah 4:3). This verse teaches that one must undertake preparations to achieve positive results. Similarly, one should eat a small amount in the afternoon to enable him to consume more in the evening.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates that <b>Rava would drink wine the entire day of Passover eve, so</b> as to <b>whet his appetite</b> to enable him <b>to eat more <i>matza</i> at night. Rava said: From where do I say it, that wine whets</b> the appetite? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna:
