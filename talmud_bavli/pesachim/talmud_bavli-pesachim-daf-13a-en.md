### Part 1
that the incident occurred <b>during sunrise</b> is because <b>he was standing</b> out <b>in the open and</b> they were <b>mere rays of light that he saw</b> which he mistook for sunrise. In actuality, he too is testifying to an incident that occurred before sunrise, and the testimony of the two witnesses is therefore compatible testimony. Rav Shimi bar Ashi therefore <b>teaches us</b> that there is no concern that it transpired in that manner.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. Rava said to Rav Naḥman: And let the Master say</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that one may eat during the entire fifth hour, <b>as the <i>tanna</i> taught</b> an <b>unattributed</b> mishna <b>in accordance with his opinion,</b> indicating that this is the <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 3
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: For the <b>entire time that one is permitted to eat</b> leaven himself, <b>he feeds</b> it to his animal. It can be inferred from this mishna that there is no intermediate period when it is prohibited for a person to eat leaven but he may feed it to his animal. This unattributed mishna must be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, as Rabbi Yehuda maintains that during the fifth hour it is prohibited to eat leaven but one may feed it to an animal.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>That</b> mishna <b>is not</b> classified as <b>unattributed,</b> as it is in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Gamliel, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> had the mishna been in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, the term: <b>Permitted,</b> is <b>difficult.</b> Instead, the mishna should have been formulated: When one eats he may feed.

### Part 5
Rava raised an additional difficulty to Rav Naḥman: <b>And let the Master say</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel, as he is</b> the <b>decisor</b> in this dispute, and there is a general principle that the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with the decisor who states an opinion that compromises between two opinions cited previously. <b>He said to him: Rabban Gamliel is not a decisor; he is stating a reason of his</b> own. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Meir disagree with regard to consumption of any type of leaven; they do not distinguish between <i>teruma</i> and non-sacred food. Since Rabban Gamliel distinguishes between the time one must desist from eating <i>teruma</i> and the latest time that one may eat non-sacred food, his is evidently an unrelated opinion that is in no way a compromise between the other two rulings.

### Part 6
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: When <b>Rav said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, he ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the fourteenth</b> of Nisan <b>that occurs on Shabbat,</b> one does not remove leaven on Passover eve in the usual manner. Rather, <b>one removes everything</b> leavened <b>before Shabbat, and one burns ritually impure <i>teruma</i>:</b> <i>Teruma</i> <b>in abeyance,</b> whose purity is uncertain, <b>and</b> even any <b>pure</b> <i>teruma</i> that he does not require for his Shabbat meals. <b>And one leaves from the pure</b> leaven <b>food for two meals,</b> the meal at night and the one in the morning, <b>in order to eat</b> and finish <b>until four hours</b> of Shabbat morning. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Elazar ben Yehuda of Bartota, who said</b> it <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua.</b>

### Part 7
The Sages <b>said to him: One</b> should <b>not burn pure</b> <i>teruma</i>, as <b>perhaps those</b> who can <b>eat it will be found</b> on Shabbat, and he will have retroactively violated a Torah prohibition by burning pure <i>teruma</i> unnecessarily. Instead, one places the <i>teruma</i> aside, and if no one is found to eat it, he feeds it to the dogs or renders it null and void in his heart. <b>He said to them: They already sought</b> people to eat the <i>teruma</i> <b>and they did not find</b> any other priests in the city to eat it. <b>They said to him: Perhaps</b> those priests who could eat the <i>teruma</i> on that Shabbat <b>slept outside the wall</b> of the city and will enter the city on Shabbat morning, at which point they could eat the <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 8
<b>He said to</b> the Sages: <b>According to your statement,</b> that you take into account this unlikely scenario, <b>one</b> should <b>not even burn <i>teruma</i> in abeyance,</b> as <b>perhaps Elijah</b> the Prophet <b>will come</b> on Shabbat and establish prophetically that the <i>teruma</i> is not ritually impure, <b>and render it ritually pure. They said to him:</b> That possibility is no source of concern, as <b>the Jewish people have already been assured that Elijah will come neither on a Friday nor on the eve of a Festival, due to the exertion</b> involved preparing for the upcoming holy day. Consequently, Elijah will certainly come neither on Friday, nor on Shabbat itself, which is Passover eve.

### Part 9
<b>They said: They did not move from there until</b> the Sages voted and <b>they established the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Yehuda of Bartota, who said</b> it <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua.</b>

### Part 10
Apropos the previous statement that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>what, is it not</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his opinion <b>even</b> with regard <b>to eating?</b> Rav’s ruling indicates that one may eat leaven until the end of the fourth hour, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>Rav Pappa said in the name of Rava: No,</b> the aforementioned ruling applies only to the obligation <b>to remove</b> leaven, i.e., the Sages agreed that it is permitted to remove pure <i>teruma</i> on Friday only if there is no one available to eat it.

### Part 11
The Gemara notes: <b>And even Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with this</b> statement <b>of Rav Naḥman,</b> and rules that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>As Ravin bar Rav Adda said:</b> There was <b>an incident</b> that occurred involving <b>a certain person who deposited a saddlebag [<i>disakkayya</i>] filled with leavened bread with Yoḥanan Ḥakuka’a, and mice bore</b> a hole <b>in</b> the bag, <b>and leavened bread was spilling out</b> of the sack. <b>And he came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi on Passover eve to ask what he should do. In <b>the first hour</b> of the day Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: Wait,</b> as the owner of the bag might yet return to take it from you and eat the leaven. In <b>the second</b> hour <b>he said to him: Wait.</b> In <b>the third</b> hour <b>he said to him: Wait.</b> In <b>the fourth</b> hour <b>he said to him: Wait. In the fifth</b> hour, concluding that the person was not coming, <b>he said to him: Go and sell it in the market.</b>

### Part 12
<b>What, did</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>not</b> mean that Yoḥanan Ḥakuka’a should sell this leaven <b>to gentiles, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who says that it is prohibited for a Jew to eat leaven during the fifth hour? <b>Rav Yosef said: No,</b> it could be that he meant to sell it <b>to a Jew, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> that one may eat leaven during the fifth hour. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was simply advising him to sell the leaven quickly before the sixth hour begins, at which point it would be prohibited for Jews to eat it. <b>Abaye said to him: If</b> it is permitted <b>for a Jew</b> to eat leaven, <b>let him take it for himself</b> and pay the owner back later. Why trouble him to sell it to someone else?

### Part 13
The Gemara responds: Eating it himself is not an option <b>due to</b> the potential of <b>suspicion. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a similar situation: <b>Collectors of charity who have no poor people to</b> whom they can <b>distribute</b> the money, <b>change</b> the money <b>with other</b> people <b>and do not change it themselves,</b> i.e., with their own coins.

### Part 14
Likewise, <b>collectors of</b> food for <b>the charity plate,</b> who would collect food in large vessels for the poor to eat, <b>who do not have poor people</b> to whom <b>to distribute</b> the food, <b>sell</b> the food <b>to others and do not sell it to themselves, as it is stated: “And you shall be clear before God and before Israel”</b> (Numbers 32:22). It is not sufficient that a person is without sin in the eyes of God. He must also appear upright in the eyes of other people so that they will not suspect him of wrongdoing.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Adda bar Mattana said to Rav Yosef: You told us explicitly</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi meant: <b>Go and sell it to gentiles, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Rav Yosef took ill late in life and forgot his studies, and therefore his student would remind him that he also agreed with that version of the incident.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Yosef said: In accordance with whose</b> opinion, i.e., the opinion of which <i>tanna</i>, <b>is that <i>halakha</i> which was taught by Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, that one should sell leaven deposited with him in order to prevent the depositor from losing his possession? Rav Yosef explains: It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>one who deposits produce with another, even if</b> the produce will be <b>ruined</b> by insects or mold, <b>he</b> should <b>not touch them. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> He should <b>sell them in court, due to</b> the obligation to <b>restore lost property.</b> Just as one is required to return a lost item, he is likewise required to prevent loss of another’s property for which he assumed responsibility.

### Part 17
<b>Abaye said to him: Wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The Rabbis <b>taught</b> that one may not touch them <b>only</b> if
