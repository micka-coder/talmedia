### Part 1
he <b>receives two</b> sets of <b>lashes,</b> for violating the prohibitions: “You shall not eat it partially roasted” (Exodus 12:9) and: “You shall only eat it…roasted with fire” (Exodus 12:9). One who ate it <b>boiled receives two</b> sets of <b>lashes,</b> for the prohibitions: “Nor shall it be boiled in any way in water” (Exodus 12:9), and “You shall only eat it…roasted with fire.” One who ate the Paschal lamb after it had been <b>partially roasted and</b> then <b>boiled receives three</b> sets of <b>lashes,</b> for eating the Paschal lamb partially roasted, for eating it boiled, and for failing to eat it roasted.

### Part 2
<b>Abaye said: One does not receive lashes for a prohibition stated in general terms.</b> The prohibition inferred from the verse "You shall only eat it...roasted in fire" includes many types of cooking, and one is not punished with lashes for violating this mitzva, as it is a general prohibition that includes meat cooked in several different ways.

### Part 3
<b>Some say</b> that Abaye said: <b>It is two</b> sets of <b>lashes that he does not receive,</b> as the mitzva that the Paschal lamb be roasted with fire does not add to the specific prohibitions against eating it partially roasted or cooked. However, <b>at any rate one set of lashes he does receive.</b> Therefore, one who prepared a Paschal lamb without properly cooking it but without roasting it is punished with lashes for failing to roast it “with fire.”

### Part 4
<b>Some say</b> that <b>one does not receive even one</b> set of <b>lashes</b> for violating this prohibition, <b>as the prohibition</b> he transgressed <b>is not specific</b> to one matter, <b>like the prohibition against muzzling.</b> The principle that one is liable to receive lashes for violating a prohibition is derived from the juxtaposition of the mitzva: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the corn” (Deuteronomy 25:4) with the verses that deal with lashes. It is inferred from this juxtaposition that one is not liable to receive lashes for violating prohibitions that are dissimilar to that of muzzling, e.g., a prohibition that is not specific to one matter.

### Part 5
The Gemara cites a parallel dispute with regard to a different <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rava said:</b> If a nazirite <b>ate</b> a grape <b>skin he receives two</b> sets of <b>lashes,</b> as the verse states: “All the days that he is a nazirite he shall eat nothing that is made of the grapevine; from pressed grapes to a grape pit he shall not eat” (Numbers 6:4). He receives two sets of lashes, one for eating food that grew on a grapevine and one for consuming the skin of a grape. Likewise, if he ate a grape <b>pit he receives two</b> sets of <b>lashes,</b> one for eating a grape pit and the other for eating a grape product. If he ate a grape <b>skin and</b> a grape <b>pit he receives three</b> sets of <b>lashes,</b> one for eating the grape skin, one for eating the grape pit, and the third for eating a grape product.

### Part 6
<b>Abaye said:</b> As with regard to the Paschal lamb, <b>one does not receive lashes for a prohibition stated in general terms. Some say</b> that according to Abaye, <b>it is two</b> sets of <b>lashes that he does not receive;</b> however, <b>at any rate one set of lashes he does receive.</b> And <b>some say: One does not receive even one</b> set of <b>lashes for</b> transgressing this prohibition, <b>as the prohibition</b> he transgressed <b>is not specific</b> to one matter, <b>like the prohibition against muzzling.</b>

### Part 7
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If <b>one ate a partially roasted olive-bulk</b> of the Paschal lamb <b>while it was still day</b> on the fourteenth of Nisan, <b>he is exempt.</b> If he ate <b>a partially roasted olive-bulk after dark, he is liable</b> to receive lashes. If <b>he ate a roasted olive-bulk</b> of the Paschal lamb <b>while it was still day</b> on the fourteenth of Nisan, <b>he has not disqualified himself from</b> his <b>group.</b> Once he has started eating the offering, he may not leave the group he joined that arranged to partake together of a single Paschal lamb. Nevertheless, this case is different, as he began eating before the obligation to eat the Paschal lamb went into effect, and therefore he has not disqualified himself from his group by eating the Paschal lamb of another group. However, if he ate <b>a roasted olive-bulk after dark,</b> when he is obligated to eat the Paschal lamb, <b>he disqualifies himself from the group</b> he had joined.

### Part 8
<b>It was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: I <b>might</b> have thought that one who <b>eats a partially roasted olive-bulk</b> of the Paschal lamb <b>while it was still day is liable</b> to receive lashes. <b>And this</b> is <b>a logical derivation</b> by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>If at</b> the <b>time when one is included in</b> the mitzva <b>to arise</b> and <b>eat</b> the <b>roasted</b> Paschal lamb, <b>he is</b> also <b>included in</b> the prohibition <b>not to eat</b> it <b>partially roasted,</b> then <b>at a time when one is not included in</b> the mitzva <b>to arise</b> and <b>eat</b> the <b>roasted</b> Paschal lamb, <b>isn’t it right that he</b> should be <b>included in</b> the prohibition <b>not to eat</b> it <b>partially roasted?</b>

### Part 9
<b>Or</b> perhaps this is <b>not</b> the case, as the opposite can be stated: <b>At</b> the <b>time when one is not included in</b> the mitzva <b>to arise</b> and <b>eat</b> the <b>roasted</b> Paschal lamb, <b>he is included in</b> the prohibition <b>not to eat</b> it <b>partially roasted.</b> However, <b>at a time when one is included in</b> the mitzva <b>to arise</b> and <b>eat</b> the <b>roasted</b> Paschal lamb, <b>he is not included in</b> the prohibition <b>not to eat</b> it <b>partially roasted,</b> as the prohibition applies only before one is permitted to eat the Paschal lamb.

### Part 10
The Gemara adds: <b>And do not be confounded</b> by this suggestion, <b>as</b> the prohibition against eating from the Paschal lamb is <b>relaxed</b> because of special circumstances <b>with regard to roasted</b> meat. Before nightfall of the fifteenth of Nisan it is prohibited to eat the Paschal lamb regardless of how it was prepared, but once it grows dark it is permitted to eat it roasted. Perhaps the relaxation of this prohibition indicates that one who eats a partially roasted Paschal lamb after nightfall also does not violate a transgression.

### Part 11
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall not eat it partially roasted, nor boiled in any way [<i>bashel mevushal</i>] in water, but roasted with fire”</b> (Exodus 12:9). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “Roasted with fire,”</b> since the previous verse already said: “On this night you shall eat the meat roasted with fire” (Exodus 12:8), <b>what</b> then is the meaning when <b>the</b> second <b>verse states: “Roasted with fire”?</b> This verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>at</b> the <b>time when one is included in</b> the mitzva <b>to arise</b> and <b>eat</b> the <b>roasted</b> Paschal lamb, <b>he is</b> also <b>included in</b> the prohibition <b>not to eat</b> it <b>partially roasted,</b> whereas <b>at a time when one is not included in</b> the mitzva <b>to arise</b> and <b>eat</b> the <b>roasted</b> Paschal lamb, <b>he is not included in</b> the prohibition <b>not to eat</b> it <b>partially roasted</b> either.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I</b> could have simply <b>read “boiled [<i>bashel</i>],”</b> as this word suffices to teach that eating a boiled Paschal lamb is prohibited after dark. <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the seemingly superfluous word <b><i>mevushal</i>,</b> which also means boiled? These two words together are translated as “boiled in any way.” <b>As</b> I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>I have only</b> derived that this prohibition applies <b>when it was boiled after dark,</b> when the obligation to eat the Paschal lamb is in effect. <b>From where</b> do I derive that one is liable <b>if he boils it while it was still day? The verse states</b> the inclusive phrase <b><i>bashel mevushal</i>,</b> which teaches that this prohibition applies <b>in any case.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>But Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi himself <b>derived</b> from the expression <b>“<i>bashel mevushal</i>”</b> the prohibition <b>against roasting</b> the meat of the Paschal lamb <b>in a pot,</b> i.e., cooking the meat in a pot without the addition of liquids, <b>and</b> the prohibition against boiling it <b>with other liquids.</b> How can he derive another <i>halakha</i> from this same phrase?

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if this verse is referring only to the matter of cooking meat with other liquids or without any liquids, <b>let the verse say either “<i>bashel bashel</i>” or “<i>mevushal mevushal</i>,”</b> and one <i>halakha</i> would be derived from the extraneous word. <b>What</b> is derived from the varied wording <b>“<i>bashel mevushal</i>”? Learn from this</b> verse <b>two</b> <i>halakhot</i>, one with regard to the manner of the cooking of the Paschal lamb, and the other concerning the time of its cooking.

### Part 15
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If one <b>ate</b> from <b>a roasted</b> Paschal lamb <b>when it was still day, he is liable</b> to receive lashes, and likewise if one ate <b>after dark an olive-bulk that was partially roasted, he is liable</b> to receive lashes.

### Part 16
This <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> that the case of <b>roasted</b> meat is <b>similar to</b> the case of <b>partially roasted</b> meat: <b>Just as</b> one who consumes <b>partially roasted</b> meat is in violation <b>of a prohibition, so too,</b> one who consumes this <b>roasted</b> meat while it is still day is in violation <b>of a prohibition.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>partially roasted</b> meat, <b>it is written: “You shall not eat it partially roasted”</b> (Exodus 12:9). <b>However,</b> with regard to meat that has been <b>roasted, from where do we</b> derive that one who eats it before the proper time has committed a transgression?

### Part 18
The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And they shall eat the meat on that night,</b> roasted with fire, and <i>matzot</i>; with bitter herbs they shall eat it” (Exodus 12:8). The Gemara derives from this verse: <b>At night, yes,</b> the Paschal lamb may be eaten; however, <b>by day, no,</b> it may not be eaten in any manner.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>This is a prohibition that comes by inference from a positive mitzva,</b> i.e., it is not stated in the Torah in the form of a prohibition. There is a principle that <b>every prohibition that comes by inference from a positive mitzva</b> is classified as <b>a positive mitzva.</b> One who transgresses a mitzva of this kind is considered to have transgressed a positive mitzva, not a prohibition.

### Part 20
The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>?
