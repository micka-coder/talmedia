### Part 1
<b>sharpness of the fruit</b> remains present in the vinegar <b>in its pure,</b> unadulterated form, despite the fact that the vinegar itself is not sharp. <b>Here, the sharpness of the fruit does not</b> remain present in the vinegar <b>in its pure,</b> unadulterated form because it has already been used with the meat. Therefore, the vinegar is no longer potent enough to keep the blood in the meat.

### Part 2
It was taught in the mishna that <b>one</b> may <b>not roast the Paschal lamb</b> on a grill. Subsequently, the mishna quotes an incident in which Rabban Gamliel instructed his servant to roast the Paschal lamb for him on a grill. The Gemara expresses surprise: Was <b>an incident</b> cited <b>to contradict</b> what was previously stated? The Gemara responds: The mishna <b>is incomplete and is teaching the following: And if it is a perforated grill,</b> so that the fire reaches each part of the meat and the animal will not be roasted from the heat of the grill itself, <b>it is permitted. And</b> with regard to this <b>Rabbi Tzadok said</b> that <b>there was an incident with Rabban Gamliel, who said to his slave Tavi: Go and roast the Paschal lamb for us on the perforated grill.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara cites a discussion related to the subject of roasting the Paschal lamb. <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Idi raised a dilemma before Rav Adda bar Ahava:</b> In the case of <b>an oven that one fired with peels of</b> fruit that are <b><i>orla</i>,</b> i.e., fruit that grows on a tree the first three years after it was planted, from which one may not receive any benefit, if, after the oven became very hot, <b>he swept it</b> and removed the fuel and the ashes, <b>and he baked bread in it, according to the opinion that prohibits</b> bread baked directly with heat from <i>orla</i> fuel, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to this bread? It was baked with the heat trapped in the oven only after the fuel was removed. <b>He said to him: The bread is permitted.</b>

### Part 4
Rav Ḥinnana <b>said to him: But didn’t Rav Ḥinnana the Elder say</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If there is <b>an oven that one fired and swept</b> so that the heat remains but there is no longer any fire in the oven, <b>and</b> one then <b>roasted the Paschal lamb in it, this is not</b> a fulfillment of the Torah’s command that the Paschal lamb must be <b>roasted in fire, as it is stated</b> in the Torah: “And they shall eat the meat on that night, <b>roasted in fire,</b> and <i>matzot</i>; with bitter herbs they shall eat it. Do not eat of it raw, nor boiled in water, but <b>roasted in fire;</b> its head with its legs and with its inner parts” (Exodus 12:8–9), and since it says the phrase: Roasted in fire, <b>two times,</b> the verse emphasizes that the Paschal lamb must literally be roasted on the fire?

### Part 5
The following can now be inferred: <b>The reason</b> is specifically because <b>the Merciful One reveals</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to the Paschal lamb in the Torah by repeating: <b>Roasted in fire, roasted in fire, twice. But</b> if <b>the Merciful One had not revealed</b> this <i>halakha</i> by emphasizing the need to roast it directly on the fire, <b>I would have said</b> a Paschal lamb roasted in an oven that has already been swept <b>is</b> nonetheless considered <b>roasted in fire.</b> Therefore, in other situations in which something is roasted in an oven, even if it is not roasted directly from the heat of a fire, its status should be comparable to something that was roasted directly from the fuel. If the fuel is forbidden, the food should be forbidden.

### Part 6
Rav Adda bar Ahava <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥinnana bar Idi: <b>The Merciful One reveals it there,</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb, <b>and we learn from it</b> that even in other areas of <i>halakha</i>, only something that is roasted directly by a fire is considered roasted in fire.

### Part 7
<b>And if you wish, say</b> a different answer instead: <b>There,</b> in the case of the Paschal lamb, <b>the reason</b> one may not roast the lamb if one has already swept out the oven <b>is that the Merciful One writes “roasted in fire” twice. But</b> if <b>the Merciful One had not written “roasted in fire” twice, I would have said that the Merciful One is particular about fire,</b> meaning that the source of the heat in the oven should be fire, <b>and even if one swept it, it is</b> still considered <b>roasted in fire.</b> It was therefore necessary to repeat the phrase “roasted in fire.” <b>But here,</b> in the case of <i>orla</i>, <b>the Merciful One is particular about the prohibited fuel, and it is not here</b> in the oven. Therefore, there is no reason to prohibit the bread.

### Part 8
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If <b>one cuts</b> the Paschal lamb superficially in several places <b>and places it on coals, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say that this is</b> considered <b>roasted in fire,</b> as coals have the status of real fire. <b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami raised a contradiction to Rav Ḥisda: Did Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi actually <b>say that coals are</b> considered like <b>fire?</b>

### Part 9
Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami <b>raised a contradiction</b> based on the Torah’s statement with regard to the laws of leprosy: “Or flesh that shall have on its skin <b>a burn from fire”</b> (Leviticus 13:24). From the fact that it says a burn from fire, I have derived <b>nothing other</b> than a case in which <b>it is burned by fire</b> itself; if it <b>is burned by a coal, by burning ash, by burning lime, by burning plaster [<i>gipsis</i>], or</b> by <b>anything</b> else that is burning <b>and</b> whose source of heat <b>comes from fire, to include</b> also <b>water heated by fire, from where</b> is it derived that these are also considered a burn from fire? <b>The verse states: A burn, a burn,</b> twice. By repeating the term, <b>it includes</b> all these types of burns.

### Part 10
The following can now be inferred: <b>The reason is that the Merciful One includes</b> these types of burns in the Torah through the words: <b>A burn, a burn. But</b> if <b>the Merciful One had not included</b> them through the repetitive expression <b>a burn, a burn,</b> one would have assumed that <b>coals are not</b> considered <b>fire,</b> which contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi that any usage of the term fire includes coals as well.

### Part 11
<b>He said to him:</b> With regard to a red-hot <b>wood coal,</b> it is <b>not necessary</b> for <b>the verse to include it.</b> As long as it is burning, it is certainly considered a fire. <b>Where a verse is necessary</b> is with regard <b>to</b> a red-hot <b>piece of metal</b> that was heated by a fire. Without the verse, it would have been possible to think a person burned by hot metal it is not considered burned by fire.

### Part 12
The Gemara expresses surprise at the previous answer: <b>And are</b> red-hot <b>pieces of metal not</b> considered <b>fire? But with regard to a daughter of a priest</b> who committed adultery after betrothal, <b>it is written:</b> “And the daughter of a priest, if she profanes herself through adultery, she profanes her father; <b>in fire she shall be burned”</b> (Leviticus 21:9), <b>and Rav Mattana said:</b> They would not literally burn her in fire; rather, <b>they would prepare for her</b> a molten <b>bar of lead.</b> They would execute her by pouring molten lead down her throat. This proves that burning metal is considered fire.

### Part 13
The Gemara responds: <b>It is different there, as the verse states</b> not simply fire, but <b>“in fire she shall be burned.”</b> The expression <b>“she shall be burned”</b> comes <b>to include all burnings that come from fire.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara suggests: If so, <b>all the more so fire itself</b> fulfills the requirement of burning. <b>Let us surround her</b> with <b>bundles of branches and burn her</b> with them. The Gemara responds: <b>It comes</b> from a verbal analogy between the word <b>“burning”</b> stated here and the word <b>“burning”</b> stated and in the context of the death of <b>the sons of Aaron: Just as below,</b> with regard to the sons of Aaron, the verse states that they were burned with fire (see Leviticus 10:2), and it was <b>a burning of the soul and the body remained,</b> as even their clothes were not burned, <b>so too, here,</b> with regard to the daughter of a priest, it means the <b>burning of the soul and the body remains.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara challenges: <b>Let us</b> execute <b>her with</b> boiling <b>water heated by fire.</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>due to</b> the statement of <b>Rav Naḥman, as Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And you shall love your fellow as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18). When executing someone, <b>select for him a kind death.</b> Even when someone must be executed, his dignity should be protected. He should be executed in the most comfortable way possible.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>Once there is</b> the reason of <b>Rav Naḥman, why do I</b> need <b>the verbal analogy</b> derived from the sons of Aaron? Even without it, Rav Naḥman’s ruling requires the court to carry out the execution with molten lead, which provides an easier death. <b>Say</b> in answer to this question: <b>If not</b> for the <b>verbal analogy, I would have said that burning the soul</b> while <b>the body remains is not</b> considered <b>burning. And if</b> it were only <b>due to</b> the statement of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> that one must select a kind death, <b>we should add many bundles of branches so that she would die quickly.</b> Therefore, the verbal analogy <b>teaches us</b> that executing with molten lead is considered burning.

### Part 17
<b>But</b> if it so that the verse says “she shall be burned” to include all methods of burning, <b>for what do I need</b> the expression <b>“in fire”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>To exclude lead from its source.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira:</b> Is it true that <b>anywhere that it is written: “In fire she shall be burned”</b> it comes <b>to include all</b> methods of <b>burning that come from fire? But</b> what of <b>bulls that are burned,</b> about <b>which it is written: “And he shall burn it on wood in fire,</b> where the ash is poured it shall be burned” (Leviticus 4:12), <b>and it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In fire, and not in burning lime and not in burning plaster?</b> Why aren’t all methods of burning permitted in this case as well?

### Part 19
<b>He said to him: How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of the daughter of a priest, <b>it is written: “In fire,” and</b> the verse <b>subsequently</b> states that <b>she shall be burned,</b> which comes <b>to include all</b> methods of <b>burning that come from fire. Here,</b> in the case of a bull, <b>it is written: “And he shall burn it on wood in fire.” At the end</b> it says <b>fire, to say that</b> with regard to <b>fire, yes,</b> it may be used, but with regard to <b>something else, no,</b> it may not be used.

### Part 20
The Gemara objects: <b>There, too,</b> with regard to bulls that are burned, <b>burning is written at the end, as it is written</b> at the end of that verse:
