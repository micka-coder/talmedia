### Part 1
<b>and a change of place,</b> i.e., one moves to a different location in the middle of his meal, he <b>need not recite</b> a new <b>blessing.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a change of place</b> one <b>must recite</b> a new <b>blessing;</b> however, in a case of <b>a change of wine</b> one <b>need not recite</b> another <b>blessing.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Idi bar Avin sat before Rav Ḥisda, and Rav Ḥisda sat and said in the name of Rav Huna: That</b> which <b>you said,</b> that after <b>a change of place</b> following <i>kiddush</i> one <b>must recite</b> a new <b>blessing, they only taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who moves <b>from house to house; however,</b> with regard to one who moves <b>from place to place</b> within one house, <b>no,</b> he is not obligated to recite a new blessing.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Idi bar Avin said to him: This</b> is indeed what <b>we learned in the <i>baraita</i> of the school of Rav Hinak, and</b> some <b>say in the <i>baraita</i> of the school of bar Hinak, in accordance with your</b> ruling. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if there is a <i>baraita</i> that states the same <i>halakha</i>, does <b>Rav Huna</b> merely come to <b>teach us a <i>baraita</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Huna</b> taught the <i>halakha</i> quoted in the <i>baraita</i> because <b>he had not heard the <i>baraita</i>.</b> Rav Huna independently issued the same ruling as that of the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 4
<b>And furthermore, Rav Ḥisda sat and said in his own name,</b> not in the name of his teachers: <b>That</b> which <b>you said,</b> that after <b>a change of place</b> one <b>must recite</b> a new <b>blessing, we only said</b> so <b>with regard to</b> one who eats <b>items</b> of food <b>that do not require a blessing after them in their</b> original <b>place,</b> e.g., water or fruit. In a case of this kind, exiting one’s location indicates that he has concluded his meal, and when he begins to eat again, this is considered a new meal that requires a new blessing.

### Part 5
<b>However,</b> this is the ruling if one is eating <b>items</b> of food <b>that require a blessing</b> of significance, i.e., Grace after Meals and its abridged version, <b>after them,</b> e.g., one of the seven species: As this blessing must be recited <b>in their</b> original <b>place,</b> i.e., where one ate these foods, he has not completed his meal by exiting that location. Therefore, if he changes location and continues to eat, he <b>need not recite</b> a new <b>blessing. What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? <b>He returns to the originally established</b> meal when he continues eating, as he certainly intended to continue that meal. <b>And Rav Sheshet said: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case, whether or not one is eating food that requires a blessing afterward in the place where he ate, if he changes location and continues eating he <b>must recite</b> a new <b>blessing.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Ḥisda’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>members of a group who were reclining to drink, and they uprooted themselves from their place to go</b> and <b>greet a groom or greet a bride, when they exit,</b> these foods <b>do not require a blessing</b> to be recited <b>afterward,</b> and <b>when they return</b> these foods <b>do not require an introductory blessing.</b>

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When they left there an elderly or a sick</b> person who cannot go with them, and he remains in the place of the meal. In this case, the original meal is considered ongoing. <b>However,</b> if <b>they did not leave there an elderly or sick</b> person, <b>when they exit,</b> the foods that they have already eaten <b>require a blessing; when they return,</b> the foods that they will eat <b>require an introductory blessing.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara infers from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Uprooted themselves,</b> this proves <b>by inference that we are dealing with items</b> of food <b>that require a blessing after them in their</b> original <b>place.</b> The word uprooted indicates that in the normal course of events, a blessing would have been required for this meal in its place, and for some reason the people left the meal early. <b>And the reason is that they left there an elderly or sick</b> person. <b>That is</b> why <b>when they exit,</b> these foods <b>do not require a blessing</b> to be recited <b>afterward, and when they return,</b> these foods <b>do not require an introductory blessing.</b>

### Part 9
<b>However, if they did not leave there an elderly or sick</b> person, <b>when they exit,</b> the foods they have already eaten <b>require a blessing</b> to be recited <b>afterward, and when they return,</b> these foods <b>require an introductory blessing</b> before resuming eating. This is <b>difficult according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who maintains that even if one did not return to his original location at all but resumed eating elsewhere, he need not recite a new blessing.
