### Part 1
If one ate <b>a hornet, he is flogged</b> with <b>six</b> sets of lashes. Since a hornet creeps along the ground, all of the previously mentioned prohibitions with regard to an ant apply to it as well. An additional prohibition is stated in the following verse: “And all flying insects are impure to you; they shall not be eaten” (Deuteronomy 14:19). Based on this precedent, it is possible to say that the addition of the phrase “It shall not be eaten” with regard to impure meat indicates merely an additional negative mitzva for which one would be punished; however, it does not necessarily indicate a prohibition to derive benefit. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Anywhere that it is possible to expound</b> a new <i>halakha</i>, <b>we expound, and we do not establish</b> the verse as containing <b>additional negative</b> mitzvot with regard to that same prohibition.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>the beginning</b> of the verse: <b>“And the flesh that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 7:19)? The Gemara explains: This comes <b>to include wood and incense;</b> although they are not eaten, they are susceptible to ritual impurity of foods. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>the end</b> of this verse: <b>“And as for the flesh, every one that is pure may eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 7:19)? The Gemara answers: This comes <b>to include</b> the <b>sacrificial parts</b> of the animal offered on the altar, such as the fats; they, too, have the legal status of meat and are susceptible to ritual impurity of foods. If these portions become ritually impure and one eats them, even if he is pure, he is liable to be flogged.

### Part 3
The Gemara challenges: The <i>halakha</i> that these <b>sacrificial parts</b> can become impure and are then prohibited to be eaten <b>is derived from there,</b> i.e., from another source, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“But the soul that eats from the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which belong to the Lord,</b> having his impurity upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). The added words “which belong to the Lord” come <b>to include</b> these <b>sacrificial parts,</b> which are meant to be offered to God and not eaten by other people, within this prohibition against eating sacrificial meat when it is impure.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this: <b>There,</b> it is referring to a case of <b>impurity of the body;</b> if one who is ritually impure eats sacrificial parts he is punishable <b>with <i>karet</i>. Here,</b> it is referring to a case of <b>impurity of the flesh,</b> where the meat is impure but the person eating it is pure; one who does so is merely in violation <b>of a negative</b> mitzva.

### Part 5
After discussing the prohibitions against eating and deriving benefit from certain items, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>all prohibitions</b> against eating <b>in the Torah, one may be flogged for</b> violating <b>them only</b> if he eats the prohibited item in its usual <b>manner of consumption.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>To exclude what</b> case did Rabbi Yoḥanan say this? <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: To exclude</b> a case <b>where one eats raw fat;</b> he teaches <b>that</b> one who does so <b>is exempt,</b> since this is not the usual manner of eating it.

### Part 6
<b>Some say</b> that this is what <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>all prohibitions</b> against deriving benefit <b>in the Torah, one is flogged for</b> violating <b>them only</b> if he derives <b>benefit</b> from the prohibited item in the usual <b>manner.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>To exclude what</b> case did Rabbi Yoḥanan say this? <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: To exclude</b> a case <b>where one placed the fat of an ox that is stoned on his wound</b> to help it heal. He teaches <b>that,</b> although one generally may not derive benefit from forbidden fats, in this case <b>he is exempt</b> because these fats are not normally used for medicinal purposes. <b>And all the more so one who eats raw fat is exempt,</b> as this is certainly not an ordinary way to benefit from fat.

### Part 7
<b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rav Aḥa bar Avya said</b> that <b>Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> If <b>one placed the fat of an ox that is stoned on his wound</b> for medicinal purposes, <b>he is exempt, because</b> with regard to <b>all prohibitions</b> against deriving benefit <b>in the Torah, one is flogged for</b> violating <b>them only</b> if he derives <b>benefit</b> from the prohibited item in its usual <b>manner.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: We, too, have also learned</b> in a mishna that the Rabbis said: <b>One absorbs the forty</b> lashes <b>due to</b> drinking the juice squeezed from <b><i>orla</i></b> fruits <b>only for</b> that which <b>seeps from olives,</b> oil, <b>and from grapes,</b> wine. <b>In contrast,</b> for drinking the juice that seeps from <b>mulberries, figs, and pomegranates</b> one is <b>not</b> flogged, despite the fact that it is prohibited to consume those juices. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Is it <b>not because he is not eating them in their usual manner of</b> deriving <b>benefit?</b> Generally, these fruits are eaten and not squeezed for their juice.

### Part 9
<b>Abaye said to him</b> that this mishna does not necessarily prove this same point: <b>Granted, had the</b> mishna <b>taught us</b> the case of <b>the fruit itself, as he is not eating it in its usual manner of</b> deriving <b>benefit, it</b> would work out <b>well. However, here,</b> where the case is with regard to their juice, the reason he is not flogged is <b>because it is merely moisture</b> that drips from the fruit, which is not considered to be an essential part of the fruit.

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said: All concede with regard to</b> prohibited mixtures of <b>diverse kinds</b> planted <b>in a vineyard that one is flogged for</b> deriving benefit from <b>them even</b> if he does <b>not</b> benefit from them <b>in their usual manner. What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>because no</b> prohibition against <b>eating is written about them</b> explicitly in the Torah. Therefore, the verse is interpreted to mean that it is prohibited to benefit from them in any manner; rather, one must burn them immediately.

### Part 11
The Gemara <b>raises an objection. Isi ben Yehuda says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that it is prohibited</b> to eat <b>meat</b> that has been cooked <b>in milk? It is stated here: “For you are a sacred people</b> unto the Lord your God. You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>And it is stated there: “And you shall be sacred men unto Me;</b> therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field [<i>tereifa</i>]; you shall cast it to the dogs” (Exodus 22:30). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>it is prohibited</b> to eat it, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to meat in milk, <b>it is prohibited</b> to eat it.

### Part 12
From the above comparison <b>I have derived only</b> that it is prohibited to <b>eat</b> it, as it is prohibited to eat a <i>tereifa</i>; <b>from where</b> do I derive that it is prohibited to derive <b>benefit</b> from it as well? <b>You</b> may <b>state an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> with regard to <b><i>orla</i>, through which no sin has been committed,</b> as it is part of the ordinary growth process of the tree to produce fruit during the first three years, yet still <b>it is prohibited</b> to deriving <b>benefit</b> from it; then with regard to <b>meat in milk, through which a sin has been committed,</b> as the two were illicitly cooked together, <b>is it not right that it should be prohibited</b> to derive <b>benefit</b> from it?
