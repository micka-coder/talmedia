### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is</b> the meaning of the name <b><i>Parva</i>? Rav Yosef said: <i>Parva</i></b> is the name of a Persian <b>sorcerer,</b> whose name is associated with the chamber due to a particular incident.

### Part 2
§ It was stated in the mishna: <b>They spread</b> there <b>a sheet of fine linen.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> that the sheet that they spread was made of <b>fine linen? Rav Kahana said:</b> It was <b>so that</b> the High Priest <b>will be aware</b> and remember <b>that the service of the day</b> is performed <b>in fine linen.</b>

### Part 3
§ The mishna continues: <b>In the morning, he would wear</b> garments <b>worth eighteen</b> <i>maneh</i>, and in the afternoon he would wear garments worth twelve <i>maneh</i>. In total, the clothes were worth thirty <i>maneh</i>. The Gemara expresses surprise at the total in the mishna: <b>Does the <i>tanna</i> come to tell us the tally</b> that eighteen and twelve equal thirty? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> comes to <b>teach us that</b> one may <b>not fashion</b> garments worth <b>less than</b> the total of <b>these</b> morning and afternoon garments. The Gemara elaborates: <b>If one decreases</b> the value <b>of these</b> morning garments, and <b>raises</b> the value <b>of those</b> afternoon garments, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b> One can distribute the total of thirty <i>maneh</i> between the two sets of garments in any manner that he chooses.

### Part 4
The Gemara comments: <b>However, everyone,</b> both Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis, <b>agrees that</b> the clothes of the <b>morning are superior</b> and must be more valuable than those of the afternoon. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Ilai, said</b> that with regard to the linen garments donned by the High Priest in the morning, <b>the verse states:</b> “He shall be dressed in a sacred <b>linen</b> tunic, and with <b>linen</b> trousers next to his flesh, and he shall be girded with a <b>linen</b> belt, and he shall wear <b>a linen</b> mitre” (Leviticus 16:4). From the fact that the verse repeats the term linen four times it is derived that the <b>choicest linen</b> should be used for this purpose.
