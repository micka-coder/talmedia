### Part 1
<b>Everyone concedes that</b> if the animal one designated as a sin-offering became lost, and he designated another animal in its stead and then found the first animal, <b>if he gained atonement through</b> the one <b>that was not lost,</b> i.e., the second one, <b>the one that was lost</b> is left <b>to die.</b>

### Part 2
<b>However, according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rav,</b> who rules that the remaining goat from the first pair is the one that is sacrificed, that goat was never disqualified, and the extra goat from the second pair was designated to serve the same purpose as the remaining goat. <b>This is like</b> one who <b>designates two sin-offerings as a guarantee,</b> so that if he loses one of them he will still be able to bring the other one. <b>And Rabbi Oshaya said</b> that all agree that if <b>one separated two sin-offerings as a guarantee, he gains atonement through one of them, and the second</b> is left <b>to graze</b> until it becomes unfit. Consequently, even the sin-offering of an individual is not left to die in this case.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>Since Rava said</b> that <b>Rav holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who said</b> that <b>the mitzva</b> should be performed <b>with the first</b> animal, when one designates the second animal, it is considered <b>from the beginning to be comparable to</b> an offering <b>separated</b> in order <b>to be lost.</b> In that case, if it is the sin-offering of an individual, the second animal is left to die.

### Part 4
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: It should</b> be left to <b>die. Granted, according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said</b> that the <b>second</b> goat <b>of the first pair should</b> be left to <b>graze, according to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who said <b>it should</b> be left <b>to die, he</b> nonetheless <b>gains atonement with</b> the <b>second</b> goat <b>of the second pair.</b>

### Part 5
<b>However, according to Rav, who said</b> that the <b>second</b> goat <b>of the second pair should</b> be left to <b>graze,</b> and <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda it should</b> be left to <b>die,</b> then <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda</b> he cannot sacrifice either of the two goats: The first goat may not be sacrificed because Rabbi Yehuda holds that disqualified animals are permanently rejected, and the second goat must be left to die. <b>With which</b> goat <b>will he gain atonement?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Do you maintain</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda was referring to the second</b> goat <b>of the second pair</b> when he said it should be left to die? <b>Rabbi Yehuda was referring to the second</b> goat <b>of the first pair.</b> The second goat of the second pair is sacrificed.

### Part 6
<b>There are those who raised this objection</b> from the statement of Rabbi Yehuda in the mishna. <b>And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> If <b>the blood</b> of the goat sacrificed to God <b>spilled</b> before it was sprinkled, <b>the scapegoat</b> is left <b>to die.</b> Similarly, if <b>the scapegoat dies, the blood</b> of the goat sacrificed to God <b>should be spilled,</b> and two other goats are brought and lots are drawn.

### Part 7
<b>Granted, according to Rav,</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna <b>they disagree with regard to a communal sin-offering.</b> According to the Rabbis the second animal is left to graze, whereas according to Rabbi Yehuda it is left to die. <b>And</b> in <b>the latter clause they disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>animals</b> that become disqualified as offerings are permanently rejected. According to the Rabbis they are not rejected and therefore the first goat is sacrificed, whereas Rabbi Yehuda holds that they are rejected and therefore the first goat is left to die and the second goat is sacrificed. <b>However, according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, what</b> does the term: <b>And furthermore,</b> in the mishna indicate? Even the Rabbis agree that the remaining goat from the first pair is permanently disqualified. The Gemara comments that indeed, this is <b>difficult.</b>

### Part 8
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> If <b>the blood</b> of the goat sacrificed to God <b>spilled</b> before it was sprinkled, <b>the scapegoat should</b> be left to <b>die.</b> Similarly, if the scapegoat dies, the blood of the goat sacrificed to God should be spilled. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> if <b>the blood</b> of the goat sacrificed to God <b>spilled, the scapegoat should</b> be left to <b>die, as the mitzva</b> of the blood <b>has not yet been performed,</b> as it was not sprinkled in the prescribed manner.

### Part 9
<b>However,</b> if <b>the scapegoat dies, why should the blood</b> of the goat sacrificed to God <b>be spilled? The mitzva of</b> the scapegoat <b>has</b> already <b>been performed.</b> The only essential detail with regard to the scapegoat is the lottery, which has already been performed by the priest. Sending it to Azazel and pushing it off a cliff are carried out by an appointed person and while they are prescribed <i>ab initio</i>, they are not indispensable. After the fact, if the goat dies in some other way, the obligation has been fulfilled.

### Part 10
The Sages <b>of the house of Rabbi Yannai said</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “But the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, <b>shall be stood alive before the Lord, to make atonement</b> over him, to send him away to Azazel into the wilderness” (Leviticus 16:10). <b>Until when must</b> the scapegoat <b>be alive? Until the blood of its counterpart is sprinkled,</b> and if it dies before, the blood is disqualified.

### Part 11
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 2:1): If <b>residents of a city sent their shekels</b> to the Temple with a messenger, <b>and</b> the shekels <b>were stolen or were lost</b> along the way; <b>if</b> the <b>funds were</b> already <b>collected,</b> i.e., the coins for the new year’s offerings were taken from the chamber before the money was stolen, the messengers <b>take an oath to the treasurers</b> of the Temple that they did not unlawfully use the shekels, but that they were taken unbeknownst to them or by force. This is because once the necessary coins have been removed, all other coins that have been dedicated for this purpose are considered Temple property wherever they are, and their subsequent theft does not change that status. If the messengers take this oath, they are exempt from monetary liability.

### Part 12
<b>And if</b> the funds were <b>not</b> yet collected when these coins were stolen, the coins are still considered the property of those who dedicated them to the Temple, and therefore the messengers <b>take an oath to the residents of the city, and the residents of the city donate other</b> shekels to the Temple <b>in their stead.</b>

### Part 13
If the shekels that were lost <b>are found or the thieves returned them, both these and those are shekels,</b> i.e., they remain sanctified, <b>but they do not count</b> toward the amount due <b>the following year.</b> The next year the members of that city must donate new shekels; they have not fulfilled the second year’s obligation by having given twice the previous year. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: They do count toward the following year.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda? Rava said: Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>the obligations of this year are</b> also <b>brought the following year,</b> and therefore it is possible to fulfill one’s obligation for the next year by using the shekels of this year.

### Part 15
<b>Abaye raised an objection to this</b> explanation. It was taught that if <b>the bull and goat of Yom Kippur were lost and one designated others in their stead, and similarly</b> if <b>the goats</b> which atone for a communal transgression of <b>idol worship</b> by instruction of the court <b>were lost and he designated others in their stead,</b> and the original animals were found, <b>all</b> the original animals <b>should</b> be left to <b>die,</b> and cannot be sacrificed at a later time. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon say: They should</b> be left to <b>graze until they become unfit.</b> Then <b>they are sold, and the money</b> received in <b>their</b> sale <b>will go to</b> the purchase of <b>a</b> public <b>gift-offering, as a communal sin-offering</b> is <b>not</b> left to <b>die.</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda, if the obligations of this year may be brought the following year, the bull and goat of Yom Kippur that were lost should be sacrificed the following year, and not left to die. Rava <b>said to him:</b>
