### Part 1
The Gemara answers that this is no proof, as <b>he is not dealing with the incense.</b> In practice, the High Priest must indeed go back and scoop new incense after slaughtering the bull. The mishna did not mention this detail because it is discussing the issue of the sprinkling of blood, not the incense service.

### Part 2
§ <b>Ulla said:</b> With regard to <b>a goat that he slaughtered before presentation of the blood of the bull,</b> it is as though <b>he did nothing.</b> The Gemara asks: But <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that if <b>he performed</b> the sprinkling of <b>the blood of the goat before</b> the sprinkling of <b>the blood of the bull, he</b> must <b>repeat</b> the action <b>and sprinkle the blood of the goat after</b> sprinkling <b>the blood of the bull. And if it is so</b> that Ulla is correct, the mishna <b>should have said</b> that <b>he must return and slaughter</b> another bull. The Gemara answers: <b>Ulla interpreted</b> the mishna as referring only <b>to the presentations in the Sanctuary</b> that were performed out of order. However, it is essential that the presentations in the Holy of Holies must be performed before the slaughter of the goat. <b>And likewise, Rabbi Afes said</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to the presentations in the Sanctuary.</b>

### Part 3
§ The mishna states: <b>And similarly in the Sanctuary, and likewise on the golden altar,</b> if the blood spills he must go back and begin that cycle of sprinklings afresh. <b>The Sages taught:</b> “And he shall make atonement for the most sacred place, and he shall make atonement for the Tent of Meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly” (Leviticus 16:33). <b>“And he shall make atonement for the most sacred place,” this is the innermost sanctum,</b> the Holy of Holies; <b>“the Tent of Meeting,” this is the Sanctuary; “altar”</b> is meant <b>as per its plain meaning; “he shall make atonement,” is</b> referring to the second mention of this phrase in the verse, <b>these are the courtyards.</b>

### Part 4
<b>“The priests”</b> is meant <b>as per its plain meaning; “people of the assembly,” these are the Israelites; “he shall make atonement,” these are the Levites,</b> who also gain atonement. <b>They are all equated</b> in this verse <b>in</b> that they achieve <b>one atonement</b> in this verse, which indicates <b>that they all achieve atonement through the scapegoat</b> for all <b>other transgressions,</b> apart from the ritual impurity of the Temple and consecrated objects, i.e., entering the Temple or eating consecrated food while ritually impure. The bull presented inside atones only for the priests, while the goats atone solely for Israelites. Only the scapegoat atones equally for all Jews. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: Just as the blood of the goat presented inside atones for Israelites</b> who sinned <b>with the ritual impurity of the Temple and its consecrated objects, so too, the blood of the</b> High Priest’s <b>bull atones for the priests</b> who sinned <b>with the ritual impurity of the Temple and its consecrated objects. And just as the confession over the scapegoat atones for Israelites with regard to all other transgressions, so too, the confession over the bull atones for the priests with regard to all other transgressions,</b> and therefore the priests do not require atonement through the scapegoat.

### Part 6
<b>The Sages taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: “And when he has finished atoning for the sacred place, and the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat” (Leviticus 16:20). <b>“And when he has finished atoning for the sacred place,” this is</b> the sprinklings in <b>the innermost sanctum,</b> the Holy of Holies; <b>“Tent of Meeting,” this is the</b> sprinklings toward the curtain in the <b>Sanctuary; “altar,” as per its plain meaning.</b> This <b>teaches that they each</b> constitute <b>a separate atonement unto themselves,</b> i.e., each one of these actions achieves a distinct atonement. If a disqualification occurs in any of the atoning actions, he must return to the beginning of that action.

### Part 7
<b>From here</b> the Sages <b>stated:</b> If the High Priest <b>presented some of the presentations inside</b> the Holy of Holies <b>and</b> then <b>the blood spilled, he brings other blood and begins from the start of the presentations inside. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> He need not start the cycle of sprinklings again; rather, <b>he begins only from the place where he stopped.</b> If <b>he finished the presentations inside and</b> then <b>the blood spilled, he brings other blood and starts at the beginning of the presentations in the Sanctuary.</b> However, he does not begin the presentations inside anew, as he has already sprinkled all the required blood inside, and that stage of the service is complete.

### Part 8
If <b>he presented some of the presentations in the Sanctuary and the blood spilled, he brings other blood and begins</b> again <b>from the start in the Sanctuary,</b> as he has not yet completed all the sprinklings in the Sanctuary. <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: He begins only from the place where he stopped.</b>

### Part 9
If <b>he finished the presentations in the Sanctuary and the blood spilled, he brings other blood and begins at the start of the presentations at the altar,</b> as he has already achieved the atonement of the sprinklings in the Sanctuary. If <b>he presented some of the presentations at the altar and the blood spilled, he brings other blood and begins at the start of the presentations at the altar,</b> as the atonement of the altar has yet not been completed. In this case, too, <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say</b> that <b>he begins from the place where he stopped.</b> If <b>he finished the presentations at the altar and the blood spilled</b> before he poured the remainder of the blood at the base of the outer altar, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the remainders <b>are not indispensable,</b> and he need not slaughter another offering for this mitzva.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And both of them,</b> meaning the first <i>tanna</i>, i.e., Rabbi Meir, the accepted author of unattributed <i>mishnayot</i>, Rabbi Elazar, and Rabbi Shimon, <b>derived</b> their opinions <b>from one verse:</b> “And Aaron shall make atonement upon its corners once a year; <b>with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement once a year</b> he shall make atonement for it throughout your generations; it is most sacred to the Lord” (Exodus 30:10).

### Part 11
Rabbi Yoḥanan elaborates: <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that God said: <b>I said to you</b> to bring <b>one sin-offering and not two sin-offerings.</b> In other words, the High Priest may not sprinkle the blood of two offerings on the inner altar. Consequently, if the blood of the sin-offering spilled in the middle of the rite, he may not complete the presentation with the blood of another animal; rather, he must slaughter new offerings so that he can present all the sprinklings at the altar from one sin-offering. <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon hold</b> that God said: <b>I said to you</b> to perform <b>one sprinkling and not two sprinklings.</b> If he already sprinkled once, the High Priest need not sprinkle again, and if the blood spilled in the middle, the rite is completed with the blood of another offering.

### Part 12
§ <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: Rabbi Ya’akov differentiated for me</b> with respect <b>to <i>lugin</i>.</b> In other words, Rabbi Ya’akov said that although Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon disagree with Rabbi Meir with respect to the sprinkling on Yom Kippur, maintaining that the High Priest restarts from where he stopped, if some of the oil from the <i>log</i> used for purifying the leper spills in the middle of the sprinkling, these <i>tanna’im</i> do not disagree that the priest must start that rite afresh.

### Part 13
The Gemara expresses surprise at this claim: <b>And</b> do they <b>not</b> disagree with regard to this issue as well? <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he presented some of the presentations</b> of oil <b>that</b> he sprinkles <b>inside</b> the Temple <b>and the <i>log</i> spilled, he brings another <i>log</i> and begins from the start of the presentations in the Sanctuary;</b> and <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: He begins from the place where he stopped.</b>

### Part 14
Likewise, if <b>he finished the presentations in the Sanctuary and the <i>log</i> spilled, he brings another <i>log</i> and begins from the start of the presentations</b> that he puts on <b>the thumbs</b> of the leper. If <b>he put some of the presentations on</b> the leper’s <b>thumbs and the <i>log</i> spilled, he brings another <i>log</i> and begins from the start of the presentations on</b> his <b>thumbs. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: He begins from the place where he stopped.</b> If <b>he finished the presentations on his thumbs and the <i>log</i> spilled, everyone agrees</b> that <b>the presentations on the head are not indispensable.</b> This <i>baraita</i> proves that Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon also disagree with Rabbi Meir with regard to the purifying oil of the leper.

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: Rather, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement must be amended, as one should <b>say: Rabbi Ya’akov taught me</b> this dispute <b>with regard to <i>lugin</i>.</b> Just as there is a dispute with regard to spilled blood during the presentations on Yom Kippur, Rabbi Ya’akov taught that a similar dispute applies to the leper’s <i>log</i> of oil.

### Part 16
The Gemara analyzes this issue: <b>The Master said</b> above that everyone agrees that the <b>presentations of</b> oil placed on <b>the head</b> of the leper <b>are not indispensable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>because it is written: “And the rest of the oil</b> that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be purified, to make atonement for him before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:29), which indicates that this presentation involves only the rest of the oil and is therefore not an essential element of atonement, <b>however, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> consider the verse: <b>“But the rest of the meal-offering</b> shall be for Aharon and his sons; it is one of the sacred offerings of the Lord by fire” (Leviticus 2:3). Should we say, <b>so too, that they are not indispensable?</b> This cannot be the case, as the <i>halakha</i> is that if the remnants of the meal-offering are lost before the handful is burnt, the owner of the offering must bring another handful.

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there,</b> with regard to the leper’s <i>log</i> of oil, <b>as it is written</b> earlier: <b>“And of the rest</b> of the oil that is in his hand, the priest shall put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be purified, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the big toe of his right foot” (Leviticus 14:17), and it is also written: <b>“And of the rest</b> of the oil that is in the priest’s hand, he shall put upon the head of him that is to be purified” (Leviticus 14:18). This shows that the presentation on the head is performed only with the remainder of the oil, and therefore this action is certainly not indispensable.
