### Part 1
<b>out of order and he was answered in order.</b> He should have asked first whether Saul would come down, and afterward what the people of Keilah would do. <b>And once he realized that he had asked out of order he went back and asked in order, as it is stated</b> immediately afterward: <b>“Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And God said: They will deliver you”</b> (I Samuel 23:12).

### Part 2
<b>But if the matter</b> is urgent and <b>requires</b> asking <b>two</b> questions simultaneously, there being no time to follow the standard protocol, one may ask both questions simultaneously and <b>he is answered</b> with regard to the <b>two</b> questions together, <b>as it is stated: “And David asked of God, saying: Shall I pursue after this troop? Will I overtake them? And He answered him: Pursue, for you will surely overtake them, and will surely rescue”</b> (I Samuel 30:8).

### Part 3
The Gemara notes the reliability of the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>: <b>Even though a decree of a prophet can be retracted,</b> as sometimes a dire prophecy is stated as a warning and does not come true, <b>a decree of the <i>Urim VeTummim</i> cannot be retracted. As it is stated: “By the judgment of the <i>Urim</i>”</b> (Numbers 27:21). The use of the term judgment suggests that the decree is as final as a judicial decision.

### Part 4
<b>Why is it called <i>Urim VeTummim</i>? <i>Urim</i>,</b> which is based on the word <i>or</i>, light, is so called because <b>it illuminates</b> and explains <b>its words. <i>Tummim</i>,</b> which is based on the word <i>tam</i>, completed, is because <b>it fulfills its words,</b> which always come true.

### Part 5
<b>And if you say: In the</b> battles following the incidents in <b>Gibeah of Benjamin</b> (Judges 19–20), <b>why did</b> the <i>Urim VeTummim</i> <b>not fulfill</b> its words? The Jewish People consulted the <i>Urim VeTummim</i> three times with regard to their decision to attack the tribe of Benjamin, and each time they were instructed to go to battle. However, the first two times they were defeated and only on the third attempt were they successful. Is this not proof that the <i>UrimVeTummim</i> does not always fulfill its words?

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: The first two times <b>they did not check</b> with the <i>Urim VeTummim</i> <b>whether they would be victorious or be defeated</b> but only inquired how and whether they should go to battle. Had they asked, they indeed would have been told that they would not succeed. <b>But on the last time, when they did check</b> and inquire whether they would be successful, the <i>UrimVeTummim</i> <b>agreed</b> with them that they should go to battle and that they would succeed, <b>as it is stated: “And Pinehas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days, saying: Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And God said: Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver him into your hand”</b> (Judges 20:28).

### Part 7
<b>How is it done?</b> How does the <i>Urim VeTummim</i> provide an answer? The names of the twelve tribes were engraved upon the stones of the breastplate. These letters allowed for the answer to be received. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The letters of the answer <b>protrude,</b> and the priest then combines those letters to form words in order to ascertain the message. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> The letters rearrange themselves and <b>join</b> together to form words.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: How was it possible to receive an answer to every question? <b>But</b> the letter <b><i>tzadi</i> is not written</b> within the names of the twelve tribes engraved on the breastplate’s stones. <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The names <b>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were</b> also <b>written there.</b> The name <i>Yitzḥak</i>, Isaac, contains the letter <i>tzadi</i>. The Gemara asks again: <b>But surely</b> the letter <b><i>tet</i> was not written</b> on the breastplate, since it is not found in the names of the Patriarchs nor in the names of the twelve tribes. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: <i>Shivtei Yeshurun</i>,</b> the tribes of Jeshurun, <b>was</b> also <b>written there.</b> The word <i>shivtei</i>, tribes, contains the letter <i>tet</i>. In this way the entire alphabet was represented.

### Part 9
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Any priest who does not speak with Divine Spirit and upon whom the Divine Presence does not rest is not consulted</b> to inquire of the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>. <b>As Zadok inquired</b> of the <i>Urim VeTummim</i> <b>and it was effective for him,</b> and he received an answer; but <b>Ebiathar</b> inquired <b>and it was not effective for him,</b> and he did not receive an answer. <b>As it is stated: “But Ebiathar went up until all the people had finished”</b> (II Samuel 15:24), which is taken to mean that he was removed from the High Priesthood since the Divine Spirit had departed from him.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: If it is true that the letters of the breastplate protrude or even join together to form the answer, why does the High Priest need the Divine Spirit and Divine Presence to be with him? And if he has the Divine Spirit and Divine Presence with him, why does he need the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>? The Gemara answers: The Divine Spirit <b>assisted the</b> <i>Urim VeTummim</i>. In other words, the letters formed the answer only if the High Priest himself was worthy, but his divine inspiration was not great enough to provide an answer without them.

### Part 11
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And</b> the High Priest <b>may be consulted</b> for the decision of the <i>Urim VeTummim</i> <b>only on behalf of the king,</b> or on behalf of the president of the court, or on behalf of one whom the community needs. <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And he shall stand before Elazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the <i>Urim</i></b> before God; by his mouth they shall go out, and by his mouth they shall come in, both he and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation” (Numbers 27:21). Each phrase describes a different circumstance in which the <i>Urim VeTummim</i> may be consulted: <b>“He”; this is</b> a reference <b>to a king,</b> as “he” refers to Joshua, who had the status of a king. <b>“All the children of Israel with him”; this is</b> a reference to <b>the priest anointed for war,</b> as all of the Jewish people follow him to war according to his instruction. <b>“Even all the congregation”; this is</b> a reference to <b>the Sanhedrin,</b> who are the heads of the Jewish people.
