### Part 1
<b>Rather, Rava said: He presents downward seven</b> times <b>for the purpose of the bull, and he again presents upward once and downward seven</b> times <b>for the purpose of the goat.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks another question: What if the <b>cups became mixed,</b> i.e., if the bowl containing the blood of the bull was confused with that of the blood of the goat? The Gemara explains: <b>He presents</b> blood from one cup by sprinkling upward once and downward seven times, <b>and he again presents</b> a second set of sprinklings from the second cup.

### Part 3
<b>And he again presents</b> another set of sprinklings, again from the first cup, which amounts to a total of <b>three times.</b> In this manner, he fulfills the obligation no matter which cup was which. If the first cup was that of the bull’s blood and the second was that of the goat, he fulfilled his obligation with the first and second sprinklings. If the first cup contained the blood of the goat, he performed the sprinkling of the goat’s blood before that of the bull, which means his first set of sprinklings are discounted. Consequently, when he sprinkled from the second cup, which contains the bull’s blood, and a third time from the cup of the goat’s blood, he fulfilled his obligation with the second and third sets of sprinklings.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks yet another question: <b>If</b> only <b>part of</b> the <b>blood became mixed</b> together <b>and part of the blood did not become mixed,</b> e.g., if some of the blood spilled and became mixed in a third vessel, the solution is <b>obvious: When he presents, he presents from the</b> blood of <b>certain</b> identity.

### Part 5
<b>However,</b> one could still ask a question with regard to this case: What is the status of the mixed blood in <b>the other</b> vessel or vessels? <b>Are they</b> considered the <b>remainder</b> of the blood, <b>and</b> the remainder of the blood <b>goes to the base</b> of the altar like the remainder of all blood of sin-offerings? <b>Or perhaps</b> this mixture of blood <b>is rejected,</b> as the blood from this vessel was not used for the first sprinklings, <b>and</b> therefore the two types of blood are spilled and <b>go to the canal</b> beneath the altar, which rinses all the dirt from the courtyard into the Kidron River.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Pappa said: Even according to the one who says</b> that <b>one cup renders its counterpart a remainder,</b> i.e., if a one collected blood in two cups, the blood in the second cup is considered the remainder of the first cup, <b>this applies</b> only in a case <b>where he could present</b> blood from the second cup <b>if he wanted</b> to, i.e., if both cups were filled with blood from the offering. <b>However,</b> in <b>this</b> case, <b>as</b> the blood in this vessel could <b>not be presented</b> even <b>if he wanted</b> to, it does <b>not</b> become a remainder, and it is therefore certainly rejected.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rav Pappa: On the contrary, even according to the one who says</b> that when blood is collected in two cups <b>one cup renders</b> the blood of <b>its counterpart rejected, that applies</b> only when <b>he rejects</b> the second cup <b>with</b> his own <b>hands,</b> i.e., by means of a direct act. <b>However,</b> in a case <b>where he does not reject it with</b> his own <b>hands,</b> as no act of rejection was performed but rather the blood became a remainder by itself, the blood is <b>not</b> rejected.

### Part 8
<b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the verse <b>above, it says:</b> “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the corners of the altar of the burnt-offering, <b>and he shall pour its blood</b> out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering” (Leviticus 4:25). <b>And</b> in the verse <b>below it says:</b> “And the priest shall take of its blood with his finger, and put it upon the corners of the altar of burnt-offering, <b>and he shall pour all its blood</b> out at the base of the altar” (Leviticus 4:30). The second verse adds the word “all.”

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a sin-offering that</b> if <b>one collected its blood in four cups and presented</b> blood from each of them by sprinkling <b>once from this</b> cup <b>and once from that</b> cup until he has sprinkled four times, once from each cup, <b>that</b> the leftover blood in <b>all</b> the cups <b>is poured</b> out as remainders <b>on the base</b> of the altar? <b>The verse states: “And he shall pour all its blood.”</b>

### Part 10
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if <b>he presented four presentations from one of them,</b> all the rest should be spilled on the base of the altar as remainder; therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he shall pour its blood.”</b> This indicates that not all the blood, but only <b>that</b> blood in the bowl from which blood was sprinkled on the altar, <b>is poured on the base</b> as a remainder, <b>and the</b> rest of the cups of blood <b>are poured into the canal. Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a sin-offering that if one collected its blood in four cups and presented four presentations from one of them, that they are all poured at the base</b> of the altar? <b>The verse states: “And he shall pour all its blood.”</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> isn’t <b>it</b> also <b>written: “And he shall pour its blood”?</b> How does he explain this difference between the verses? <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> When the Torah states “its blood,” it comes <b>to exclude</b> the <b>remainders that are in the throat of</b> the <b>animal.</b> If more blood comes out of the throat after the collection of the blood, that blood is certainly not poured on the base of the altar but is swept into the canal of the Temple.

### Part 12
§ The mishna states that after the High Priest sprinkled the blood toward the curtain <b>he poured the blood of the bull into the blood of the goat.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>We learned</b> this mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who said</b> that the High Priest <b>mixes</b> the two types of blood before placing them <b>on the corners</b> of the inner altar, and he does not present each one separately. <b>As it was stated:</b> The later <i>tanna’im</i>, <b>Rabbi Yoshiya and Rabbi Yonatan,</b> debated this issue. <b>One</b> of them <b>said:</b> The High Priest <b>mixes</b> the blood for the purpose of placing the blood on the altar’s corners, <b>and one</b> of them <b>said: He does not mix</b> the blood.

### Part 13
The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoshiya was</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>who said</b> that the High Priest <b>mixes</b> the blood. In general, he maintains that whenever a verse mentions two matters, <b>although</b> the term: <b>Together, is not written</b> explicitly, <b>it is considered as though</b> the term: <b>Together, is</b> indeed <b>written.</b> In other words, two items that appear in the same verse are treated as combined unless expressly stated otherwise. By contrast, Rabbi Yonatan maintains that even if two matters are mentioned together they are treated separately unless the verse uses the term: Together. In this case, the verse states: “And he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat” (Leviticus 16:18). Therefore, Rabbi Yoshiya rules that the High Priest must place the two sets of blood together.

### Part 14
The Gemara rejects this contention. <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan,</b> it remains possible to explain its ruling, since <b>it is different here, as it is written “once”</b> (Exodus 30:10), which indicates that there must be one act of sprinkling and not two. Consequently, the High Priest must mix the blood to ensure that there is only one presentation.

### Part 15
The Gemara comments: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>contrary to our response,</b> but in accordance with the initial assumption: “And he shall go out to the altar that is before the Lord, and make atonement for it; <b>and he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat,</b> and put it on the corners of the altar round about” (Leviticus 16:18). This verse teaches <b>that</b> the blood of the bull and the goat should <b>be mixed.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b>
