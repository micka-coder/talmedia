### Part 1
It is <b>with regard to</b> whether the Temple <b>service is desecrated</b> and disqualified if the priest failed to immerse before its performance that <b>they disagree.</b> According <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>ben Zoma,</b> this immersion is for the purpose of sanctification and is an integral part of the service; consequently, if the priest failed to immerse <b>he desecrates the service.</b> According <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda he does not desecrate</b> the <b>service,</b> because the immersion is merely a precautionary measure.

### Part 2
The Gemara wonders: <b>And</b> according <b>to ben Zoma, is</b> the service <b>desecrated? But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a High Priest who did not immerse and did not sanctify</b> his hands and feet <b>between</b> donning the golden <b>garments and</b> the white linen <b>garments,</b> and similarly, with regard to a High Priest who did not immerse <b>between</b> performance of one <b>service and</b> another <b>service, his service is valid.</b> However, <b>both a High Priest and a common priest who did not sanctify his hands and feet</b> at all <b>in the morning and performed the service, his service is disqualified.</b> If the High Priest’s failure to immerse between services does not desecrate the service, all the more so that failure to perform the first immersion would not desecrate the service, as ben Zoma derives the first immersion from the immersion of the High Priest. Apparently, that is not the basis of their dispute.

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> it is with regard <b>to</b> whether one who fails to immerse before service <b>stands in</b> violation of <b>a positive mitzva</b> that <b>they disagree.</b> According <b>to ben Zoma, he stands in</b> violation of a <b>positive mitzva</b> because there is a special requirement to perform this immersion for the purpose of sanctification. According to <b>Rabbi Yehuda, he does not stand in</b> violation of <b>a positive mitzva.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara wonders: <b>And does Rabbi Yehuda hold</b> in accordance with <b>this</b> line of <b>reasoning? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A leper</b> on the eighth day of his purification, after he has already immersed at the end of the seventh day, <b>immerses</b> again <b>and stands at the Gate of Nicanor</b> in the Temple to bring his purification offerings and to have the priest sprinkle the blood of the guilt-offering and the oil that accompanies his purification offerings on his thumbs and big toes to complete the purification process. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He does not require</b> an additional <b>immersion, as he already immersed the</b> previous <b>evening.</b> Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda does not require a special immersion in the morning to remind the leper of old impurity.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: In <b>that</b> case of the leper, the reason that no immersion is required in the morning is <b>as the reason was taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>As he already immersed the</b> previous <b>evening.</b> That immersion purified him and reminded him of any old impurity that he might have. This is in no way connected to the matter of ancillary immersion.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> the one <b>who grasps</b> this <i>baraita</i> as a contradiction to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, in <b>what</b> manner <b>does he grasp it?</b> The rationale for the <i>halakha</i> is explicit. The Gemara answers: <b>Because</b> the Gemara <b>wants to raise a contradiction</b> between <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> and this <i>baraita</i>, and the question will be clarified through combination of the sources. As it was taught: Why was the chamber called <b>the Chamber of the Lepers?</b> It is <b>because the lepers immerse there. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It was <b>not only lepers</b> that <b>they said</b> immerse there; <b>rather, all people</b> immersed there. Rabbi Yehuda states that lepers and others immersed in this chamber in the Temple, contradicting his statement in the first <i>baraita</i> that a leper does not require immersion in the Temple, as he immersed the evening before.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; this</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the leper <b>immersed</b> the evening before and need not immerse again; <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the leper <b>did not immerse.</b> In that case, there was a special chamber where lepers could immerse. The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the leper <b>did not immerse</b> at all the previous evening, <b>he requires the sun to set</b> after his immersion to be sufficiently purified to enter the Temple. <b>Rather, both this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> refer to a case <b>where</b> the leper <b>immersed,</b> but <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> that requires a second immersion is in a case where he <b>was distracted</b> from his efforts to avoid impurity imparted by a corpse; <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> that does not require a second immersion is in a case where he <b>was not distracted.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: If he <b>was distracted</b> from his efforts to avoid impurity imparted by a corpse, it is <b>sprinkling</b> of purification waters on <b>the third and the seventh</b> days that <b>he requires,</b> not merely immersion. <b>As Rabbi Dostai bar Matun said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Distraction</b> from efforts to avoid impurity <b>requires sprinkling</b> of purification waters on <b>the third and the seventh</b> days.

### Part 9
<b>Rather, both this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> refer to a case <b>where</b> the leper <b>was not distracted, and</b> this is <b>not difficult; this</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the leper <b>immersed</b> the evening before with <b>the intention of entering the Temple; that</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the leper <b>did not immerse</b> in the evening with <b>the intention of entering the Temple.</b> In that case, he requires a second immersion for purification even to enter the sacred area. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> with a slight emendation: It was <b>not lepers</b> that <b>they said</b> immerse there; <b>rather, all people</b> immersed there. Rabbi Yehuda does not qualify the statement of the Rabbis but disputes it. In his opinion, lepers do not require immersion in the morning at all.

### Part 10
In an alternative resolution of the contradiction between the statements of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>Ravina said:</b> In the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Yehuda is stating</b> his opinion <b>to them according to the statement of the Rabbis.</b> His statement does not reflect his opinion. Rather, it is a contention that he raised in the framework of his dispute with the Rabbis. According <b>to my</b> opinion, <b>a leper does not require</b> a second <b>immersion</b> to enter the Temple. However, according <b>to your</b> opinion, <b>concede to me then [<i>izi</i>] that</b> it was <b>not only lepers</b> that <b>they said</b> immerse there; <b>rather, all people</b> immersed there. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> explain their opinion? It answers that there is no comparison: <b>A leper is accustomed to impurity;</b> therefore, he could overlook other impurities that he may have contracted. The immersion reminds him to purify himself for those as well. However, <b>all</b> other <b>people,</b> who <b>are not accustomed to impurity,</b> will certainly be sensitive to and conscious of any impurity that they may have encountered and do not require a special immersion.

### Part 11
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Let us say</b> that <b>the Rabbis, who disagree</b> with <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard to immersions, <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>ben Zoma,</b> who maintains that this immersion is an obligation by Torah law for anyone entering the courtyard. <b>And</b> the fact <b>that</b> the dispute in the <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught</b> with regard to a <b>leper,</b> contrary to the opinion of ben Zoma, comes <b>to convey the far-reaching</b> nature of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> that even a leper does not require immersion. <b>Or perhaps</b> fundamentally the Rabbis agree with Rabbi Yehuda; however, the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a leper is different</b> because <b>he is accustomed to impurity,</b> and that is why a second immersion was instituted for him. Rav Yosef <b>said to him: A leper is different</b> because <b>he is accustomed to impurity.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef:</b> According to <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> the immersion is not an actual obligation but <b>it is an ancillary immersion</b> to remind the individual of old impurity,
