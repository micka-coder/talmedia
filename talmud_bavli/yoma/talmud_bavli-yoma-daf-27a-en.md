### Part 1
The Gemara asks: But <b>that</b> verse about putting fire on the altar <b>is needed for its own sake,</b> to teach that the wood must be brought by a priest; it should not be interpreted as an inference that other services, such as flaying and cutting, may be performed by non-priests. <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: I found Abaye explaining</b> Hizkiya’s derivation <b>to his son</b> based on the following <i>baraita</i>. It is written: <b>“And he shall slaughter</b> the bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:5), with no mention of a priest, which teaches that <b>slaughter by a non-priest is acceptable.</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Now, from where would you come</b> to think otherwise? Why would one even suspect that a priest should be required to slaughter the offering, so that a specific verse is required to tell us otherwise? <b>From the fact that it is stated: “And you and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood”</b> (Numbers 18:7), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that no part of the sacrificial service may be performed by a non-priest, not <b>even slaughtering.</b>

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he shall slaughter the bull before the Lord, and the sons of Aaron…shall sacrifice the blood”</b> (Leviticus 1:5), from which it is inferred that <b>from the</b> sacrificing of blood, which begins with the <b>collection</b> of the blood, <b>and onward is a mitzva</b> exclusively <b>of priesthood.</b> Just prior to this the Torah states: <b>“And he shall place his hands</b> upon the head of the burnt-offering…<b>and he shall slaughter</b> the bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:4–5). In this verse the Torah is referring to the donor of the offering when it says: He shall place his hands, and therefore when it continues: And he shall slaughter, it is also referring to the donor. The Torah thereby <b>taught</b> that <b>the slaughter</b> of the offering <b>is acceptable</b> if performed <b>by a non-priest.</b>

### Part 3
Abaye asked: <b>Since,</b> as this <i>baraita</i> establishes, <b>from the collection</b> of the blood <b>and onward is a mitzva</b> exclusively <b>of priesthood, why do I</b> need the Torah to say afterward: <b>“The sons of Aaron shall put</b> fire on the altar” (Leviticus 1:7)? Since the verse about putting the fire on the altar follows the verse about collection of blood, it is clear that it must be done by priests, and the verse’s stipulation of this fact appears superfluous. This is why Ḥizkiya concluded that the verse is not required for its own sake but is needed to teach the following inference: It is only the placing of fire on the altar that requires priests, <b>to the exclusion of flaying and cutting up</b> the animal, which may be performed by a non-priest.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But still,</b> the verse about the placement of wood by priests <b>is necessary</b> for its own sake. As <b>it might have entered your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> placing the wood is <b>not a service that is indispensable</b> for obtaining <b>atonement,</b> as atonement is achieved solely through the blood of the offering, it should <b>not be required</b> to be performed by <b>priests.</b> And one might have thought that the principle that all tasks from the collection of the blood and onward require a priest applies only to services relating to the blood. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that nevertheless, <b>priesthood is required.</b> Consequently, it cannot be asserted that the verse is written for the purpose of excluding other services.

### Part 5
<b>Rather,</b> Hizkiya’s derivation must be rejected, and the acceptability of non-priests for flaying and cutting the animal must be learned <b>from here:</b> It is written: <b>“And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay out the pieces, the head and the fat”</b> (Leviticus 1:8). <b>Since,</b> as the <i>baraita</i> above establishes, <b>from the collection</b> of the blood <b>and onward is a mitzva</b> exclusively <b>of priesthood, why do I</b> need the verse to specify: <b>“And</b> Aaron’s sons <b>shall lay out</b> the pieces”? Since the specification of priesthood here appears superfluous, one must conclude that it is written not for its own sake but <b>to exclude flaying and cutting up</b> the animal, to teach that those acts need not be performed by a priest.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: Granted, the verse comes to convey the inference that another act does not require priesthood, <b>but say</b> that it comes <b>to exclude the arrangement of the two logs,</b> to teach that this activity may be done by a non-priest. The Gemara rejects this: <b>It is</b> more <b>reasonable</b> that the verse, which deals with laying out the pieces of the offering on the altar, would <b>exclude a service</b> that is <b>similar to itself,</b> i.e., something related to the body of the sacrificial animal, such as flaying it and cutting it up, rather than the arrangement of the wood, which is not related to the animal itself.

### Part 7
The Gemara responds: <b>On the contrary,</b> one should say that <b>it excludes</b> something relevant to <b>arrangement,</b> i.e., the placement of the logs, <b>which is similar</b> to the laying of the pieces of the offering in that both pertain to the placement of an item on the altar. Perhaps, then, the verse is coming to convey the inference that the arrangement of the logs, unlike the arrangement of the pieces of the offering, may be performed by a non-priest.

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>It cannot enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as the Master said:</b> After mentioning the mitzva to collect the blood, the Torah states: <b>“And the priest shall bring all of it near and burn it on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:13), where bringing near is referring to <b>carrying the limbs to the ramp.</b> The specification of priesthood in this verse is not required for its own sake, since all services following the collection of blood require priesthood. Therefore, it must be that it comes to convey the inference that <b>it is</b> only <b>carrying the limbs to the ramp that requires priesthood,</b> but <b>carrying wood</b> to the altar <b>does not require priesthood. This,</b> in turn, implies that <b>the</b> actual <b>arrangement of the two logs,</b> which was not excluded, <b>does require priesthood.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara returns to the derivation presented above, where the question was raised: <b>Why do I</b> need the words <b>“and</b> Aaron’s sons <b>shall lay out</b> the pieces”? The conclusion was that the specification of priesthood here comes <b>to exclude flaying and cutting up</b> the animal, to teach that these acts may be performed by a non-priest. The Gemara now rejects this derivation: <b>But say that this</b> verse <b>too is</b> necessary <b>for its own sake,</b> to teach the lesson that the Gemara will shortly derive from these words (Maharsha), and one can no longer assert that the verse comes solely for the purpose of conveying the inference that other, similar acts, i.e., flaying and cutting up the animal, do not require priesthood.

### Part 10
<b>Rather,</b> this derivation must be rejected as well, and another verse must be found from which to prove that non-priests may flay and cut up the animal. The Torah states: <b>“And the priest shall burn all of it on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:9). Since this is an act following the collection of the blood, the specification of priesthood is not needed for its own sake. Therefore, <b>for what</b> purpose does that verse <b>come?</b> It comes <b>to exclude flaying and cutting up</b> the animal, which may be performed by a non-priest.

### Part 11
The Gemara reviews the lessons taught by the other verses cited above. When the Torah writes: <b>“The priest shall bring all of it near…the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:13), <b>this</b> is referring to <b>carrying the limbs to the ramp,</b> and the verse comes to exclude other, similar actions, teaching that although <b>carrying the limbs to the ramp requires priesthood, carrying wood</b> to the altar <b>does not require priesthood. Therefore,</b> it is derived from here as well that the <b>arrangement of the two logs does require priesthood,</b> as explained above. And when the Torah writes: “The sons of Aaron <b>shall put</b> fire on the altar” (Leviticus 1:7), this is necessary <b>for its own sake,</b> to teach that this service must be done by priests.

### Part 12
When the Torah states: “And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall lay out the pieces, the head and the fat” (Leviticus 1:8), it comes to teach the following: <b>“And they shall lay out,”</b> through the use of the plural, teaches that it must be done by <b>two</b> priests, as the minimum number implied by a plural word is two. <b>“The sons of Aaron,”</b> also in plural, indicates an additional <b>two; “the priests,”</b> also in plural, indicates <b>two</b> more. <b>We</b> therefore <b>learn</b> from this verse <b>that</b> the sacrificial <b>lamb requires six</b> priests to carry its limbs to the altar.The flesh is taken by five priests, and the innards by one, as described in an earlier mishna.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Hamnuna said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar posed a difficulty: This</b> verse <b>is written</b> about a young bull, not a lamb; and a <b>bull requires twenty-four</b> priests. How, then, can this verse be used as the source that six priests are required to carry the limbs of a lamb? And <b>he resolved</b> the difficulty himself as follows: The same verse states: <b>“On the wood that is on the fire upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:8), all of which apparently teaches nothing new about the sacrifice. Therefore, it is seen as an allusion to the daily offering, which was a lamb, as <b>what is an item about which it is stated that</b> specially prepared <b>wood and fire</b> on an <b>altar</b> must be provided, and that pre-existing wood and fire do not suffice?
