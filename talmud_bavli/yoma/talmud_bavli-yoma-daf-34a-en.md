### Part 1
<b>The verse states:</b> “And the priest shall burn wood upon it in the morning, in the morning, <b>and he shall place the burnt-offering upon it”</b> (Leviticus 6:5), <b>and Rava said:</b> The verse could have simply said: And he shall place upon it, indicating that everything sacrificed on the altar is placed upon it; but instead, the verse states: “And he shall place <b>the burnt-offering</b> upon it,” to teach that <b>it ascends</b> the altar <b>first.</b>

### Part 2
Abaye continued: The sacrifice of the <b>meal-offering</b> precedes the sacrifice of the High Priest’s daily <b>griddle-cake</b> offering, half of which he sacrifices in the morning and half in the afternoon, as the verse states: “To bring offerings by fire to the Lord, burnt-offerings, meal-offerings, sacrifices, and libations, on each day what is proper to it” (Leviticus 23:37). Since the Torah states <b>burnt-offerings and meal-offerings,</b> apparently the daily burnt-offering precedes the meal-offering. And since the meal-offering is part of the burnt-offering sacrifice, it precedes the griddle-cake offering, which is a meal-offering unrelated to the burnt-offering.

### Part 3
Abaye continued: <b>And the griddle-cake</b> offering precedes the pouring of the <b>libations</b> of the daily offering. This is because it is in the <b>category</b> of <b>meal-offering.</b> Since it has been established that the meal-offering that accompanies the daily offering is sacrificed after the daily offering, all meal-offerings are sacrificed after the daily-offering prior to any other service.

### Part 4
Abaye continued: <b>And</b> the <b>libations</b> precede the sacrifice of the <b>additional offerings,</b> as it is written: <b>Offerings and libations,</b> from which it is derived that the libations are brought immediately after the daily offering, before any other offering is sacrificed. <b>And the additional offerings</b> precede <b>the vessels</b> of frankincense that are brought on Shabbat. The Gemara asks: <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The vessels</b> of frankincense <b>precede the additional offerings?</b> The Gemara answers: This <b>is</b> the subject of a dispute between the <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 58a).

### Part 5
<b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>reasonable</b> that the sequence should be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who said the additional offerings</b> precede <b>the vessels</b> of frankincense, as <b>didn’t you say</b> that the repetition of the term: <b>In the morning, in the morning,</b> comes <b>to prioritize</b> the daily offering? <b>Here too,</b> repetition within the clause: “He shall arrange them <b>on</b> Shabbat <b>day, on</b> Shabbat <b>day”</b> (Leviticus 24:8), with regard to the vessels of frankincense, comes to <b>postpone</b> that service until the peak of the day.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion <b>of the one who said:</b> The <b>vessels</b> of frankincense <b>precede the additional offerings?</b> The Gemara explains: By means of a verbal analogy <b>he derives: Statute,</b> written with regard to the vessels of frankincense: “A statute for all time” (Leviticus 24:9), <b>from: Statute,</b> written with regard to the <b>griddle-cake</b> offering: “A statute for all time” (Leviticus 6:15). Just as the griddle-cake offering precedes the additional offerings, so too, the vessels of frankincense precede the additional offerings.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>If he derived it from there, let him derive the entire matter from there,</b> and let the vessels of frankincense be burned immediately after the griddle-cake offering; why are the libations offered between them? The Gemara answers: It is <b>to that</b> end that the verse: “He shall arrange them <b>on</b> Shabbat <b>day, on</b> Shabbat <b>day,”</b> with regard to the vessels of frankincense, <b>is effective, to postpone</b> their offering until later.

### Part 8
§ After analyzing Abaye’s tradition with regard to the sequence of the daily service, the Gemara returns to analyzing the passage in the mishna: <b>The morning incense was burned between</b> the receiving and sprinkling of the <b>blood</b> and the burning <b>of the limbs.</b> The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is the mishna? <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> elsewhere (15a), the mishna <b>should</b> say that the incense was burned <b>between</b> the sprinkling of the <b>blood and</b> the removal of the ashes from the <b>lamps. If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul,</b> the mishna <b>should</b> say that the incense was burned <b>between</b> the removal of the ashes from the <b>lamps and</b> the burning <b>of</b> the <b>limbs.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, but</b> the mishna <b>is not speaking of the sequence</b> of the entire service. The mishna states that the incense was burned between the sprinkling of the blood and the burning of the limbs of the daily offering, although other services were performed then as well, including the removal of ashes from the lamps.

### Part 10
The mishna continues: The <b>afternoon</b> incense was burned <b>between</b> the taking of the <b>limbs</b> up to the altar and the pouring of its <b>libations.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that the <b>verse states:</b> “And the other lamb you shall present in the afternoon, <b>as the meal-offering in the morning and its libation, you shall present it,</b> an offering made by fire, of a sweet fragrance unto the Lord” (Numbers 28:8). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>the morning meal-offering incense precedes libations, so too here,</b> in the afternoon, <b>incense precedes the libations.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, <b>just as there,</b> in the morning, <b>incense</b> even <b>precedes limbs, so too here,</b> in the afternoon, <b>incense</b> should <b>precede limbs.</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>Is it written: As the limbs in the morning? As the meal-offering in the morning, is written,</b> indicating with regard to the daily afternoon offering that it is <b>like the meal-offering in the morning, and not like the</b> burning of the <b>limbs of the morning.</b>

### Part 12
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“And its libation shall be a quarter-<i>hin</i></b> for the one lamb, in the sacred area it shall be poured as an offering of strong drink unto the Lord” (Numbers 28:7). The Sages understand this verse as referring to the daily afternoon offering; therefore, <b>one will derive</b> the manner and order <b>of</b> the daily <b>morning</b> offering <b>from</b> the manner and order <b>of</b> the daily <b>afternoon</b> offering. Just as libations are required for the daily afternoon offering, so too, they are required for the daily morning offering.
