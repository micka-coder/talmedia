<b>because it resembles the luster of pearls [<i>paz</i>]</b> in the way it glistens. <b><i>Shaḥut</i> gold</b> is named as such <b>because</b> it is very malleable and <b>is spun like thread [<i>shenitve keḥut</i>].</b> <i>Shaḥut</i> is a contraction of the words <i>shenitve keḥut</i>. <b>Closed gold</b> is so called <b>because when</b> a shop <b>opens</b> to sell it, <b>all the</b> other <b>shops close,</b> as no one is interested in purchasing any other type of gold. <b><i>Parvayim</i> gold</b> is so called <b>because</b> its redness <b>resembles the blood of bulls [<i>parim</i>].</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Ashi said: There are</b> in fact only <b>five</b> types of gold, the last five in Rav Ḥisda’s list. Gold and good gold are not independent categories; rather, <b>each and every one</b> of the types of gold has two varieties: Regular <b>gold and</b> a superior variety called <b>good gold. That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to <i>parvayim</i> gold: <b>On every</b> other <b>day</b> the coal pan was made <b>of greenish gold, but</b> on <b>this day</b> it was made of <b>a red</b> gold, <b>and this is the <i>parvayim</i> gold which resembles the blood of bulls.</b>

### Part 3
§ The mishna states: <b>On every</b> other <b>day,</b> a priest <b>sacrificed a <i>peras</i>,</b> half of a <i>maneh</i>, of incense <b>in the morning,</b> and a <i>peras</i> in the afternoon, but on this day the High Priest adds an additional handful of incense and burns it in the Holy of Holies. <b>On every</b> other <b>day,</b> the incense <b>was</b> ground <b>fine</b> as prescribed by the Torah, <b>but</b> on <b>this day it was superfine. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the incense on Yom Kippur that it is <b>“finely ground</b> aromatic incense” (Leviticus 16:12). <b>What</b> does the <b>verse</b> mean to <b>teach</b> by this? <b>Has it not already been stated: “And you shall grind some of it finely”</b> (Exodus 30:36)? <b>Rather, it teaches</b> that on Yom Kippur the incense has to be <b>superfine.</b>

### Part 4
§ The mishna states: <b>On every</b> other <b>day, priests ascend on the eastern side of the ramp.</b> A <i>baraita</i> explains the reason for this: <b>As the Master said: All the turns that you turn should be only to the right,</b> which, after ascending the altar, means one will turn <b>to the east</b> and will mean one will circulate the altar in a counter-clockwise fashion. When they descended, they again turned to the right, which is to the west of the ramp.

### Part 5
§ The mishna continues: <b>But</b> on <b>this day</b> the priests <b>ascend in the middle</b> of the ramp <b>and descend in the middle. What is the reason? Due to the eminence</b> of the <b>High Priest</b> he should not walk on the side but in the middle.

### Part 6
§ We learned in the mishna that <b>every</b> other <b>day the High Priest sanctifies his hands and his feet from the laver</b> like the other priests, and on this day he sanctifies them from the golden flask. <b>What is the reason? Due to the eminence</b> of the <b>High Priest.</b>

### Part 7
§ The mishna states: <b>On every</b> other <b>day, there were four arrangements</b> of wood <b>there,</b> upon the altar, but on this day there were five. <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>On every</b> other <b>day there were two arrangements</b> of wood on the altar, <b>but</b> on <b>this day</b> there were <b>three: One,</b> the <b>large arrangement; and one,</b> the <b>second arrangement</b> for coals <b>for the incense; and one,</b> the additional arrangement of wood, <b>which they add on that day</b> for the incense that is burned in the Holy of Holies. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: On every</b> other <b>day</b> there were <b>three</b> arrangements, <b>but</b> on <b>this day</b> there were <b>four: One, the large arrangement; and one,</b> the <b>second arrangement for the incense; and one, for the upkeep of the fire,</b> so that if the fire of the large arrangement begins to die down, wood from this arrangement may be added to it to raise the flames; <b>and one,</b> the additional arrangement of wood <b>that they add on that day</b> for the incense that is burned in the Holy of Holies.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Meir says: On every</b> other <b>day there were four</b> arrangements of wood on the altar <b>but</b> on <b>this day</b> there were <b>five: One,</b> the <b>large arrangement; and one,</b> the <b>second arrangement for the incense; and one, for the upkeep of the fire;</b> and <b>one, for</b> burning <b>the limbs and fats that were not</b> fully <b>consumed</b> on the altar <b>the</b> previous <b>evening; and one,</b> the additional arrangement of wood <b>that they add on that day</b> for the incense that is burned in the Holy of Holies.

### Part 10
The Gemara analyzes the different opinions: <b>At any rate, everyone has</b> at least <b>two</b> arrangements in their calculations. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>The verse states: “It is the burnt-offering on the flame on the altar all night”</b> (Leviticus 6:2); <b>this</b> is referring to <b>the large arrangement.</b> It states further: <b>“And the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereby”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), <b>this</b> additional mention of a fire is referring to <b>the second arrangement,</b> which is <b>for the incense. And from where does Rabbi Yosei</b> learn about the additional arrangement <b>for the upkeep of the fire? He derives it</b> from the verse: <b>“And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby”</b> (Leviticus 6:5), which mentions fire for the third time.

### Part 11
<b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that normally there are only two arrangements, explain this third mention of a fire? <b>That</b> additional mention <b>comes to</b> teach about <b>the kindling</b> of the <b>thin wood chips,</b> which were used to ignite the fires on the altar, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda would say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the kindling of the wood chips should</b> be done <b>only at the top of the altar,</b> rather than setting them alight at the bottom of the altar and carrying them up? <b>The verse states: “And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby”</b> (Leviticus 6:5), which indicates that the fire that is brought there has to be lit on the altar itself. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that an arrangement for the upkeep of the fire is made? The verse states: “And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby”</b> (Leviticus 6:5).

### Part 12
<b>And from where</b> does <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> derive that the <b>kindling of the wood chips</b> should be at the top of the altar? <b>He derives it from the</b> same <b>place</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon derives it. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:7), which <b>teaches about the kindling of</b> the <b>wood chips that it may be</b> done <b>only by a fit priest and</b> one who is robed <b>in</b> the priestly <b>vestments of service;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon said to him:</b> There is no need for a verse to teach that a priest must kindle the chips, <b>for could it enter your mind that a non-priest could approach the altar? Rather,</b> this verse <b>teaches</b> about the <b>kindling of the wood chips, that they may be lit only at the top of the altar.</b>

### Part 13
<b>And</b> what would <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> respond to Rabbi Shimon’s reasoning? <b>If</b> this <i>halakha</i> was derived <b>from there, I would have said</b> a non-priest could light the fire on the altar by <b>standing on the ground</b> below <b>and using a bellows</b> to fan the flames on the top of the altar. Therefore, this verse <b>teaches us</b> that in all circumstances the person kindling the fire must be a priest.

### Part 14
<b>And from where does Rabbi Meir</b> learn about an additional arrangement for the <b>limbs and the fats that were not</b> fully <b>consumed</b> on the altar <b>the</b> previous <b>evening? He derives it</b> from the phrase <b>“and the fire.”</b> The apparently superfluous word “and” alludes to the existence of an additional arrangement. <b>And the Rabbis,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yehuda, who disagree, <b>do not expound</b> the word <b>“and.”</b>

### Part 15
<b>And</b> according to <b>the Rabbis, what do they do with the limbs and the fats that were not</b> fully <b>consumed</b> on the altar <b>the</b> previous <b>evening?</b> Where are they burned? A priest <b>returns them to the large arrangement,</b> where the process of their burning is completed. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>for limbs and fats that were not</b> fully <b>consumed</b> on the altar <b>the</b> previous <b>evening,</b>
