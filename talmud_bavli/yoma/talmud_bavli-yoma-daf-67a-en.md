with a distance of <b>ninety <i>ris</i></b> between them. As there are <b>seven and a half</b> <i>ris</i> <b>for each <i>mil</i>,</b> the total distance was twelve <i>mil</i>. <b>At each and every booth,</b> people there <b>say to him: Here is food; here is water,</b> if you need it. <b>And they escort him from booth to booth, except for the last</b> person at the last booth, <b>who does not reach the cliff with him. Rather, he stands from a distance and observes his actions</b> to ensure that he fulfills the mitzva properly.

### Part 2
<b>What did</b> the one designated to dispatch the goat <b>do</b> there? <b>He divided a strip of crimson</b> into two parts, <b>half</b> of the strip <b>tied to the rock, and half of it tied between the two horns</b> of the goat. <b>And he pushed the goat backward, and it rolls and descends. And it would not reach halfway</b> down <b>the mountain until it was</b> torn <b>limb</b> from <b>limb.</b> The one designated to dispatch the goat <b>came and sat under the</b> roofing of <b>last booth until it grows dark</b> and only then went home. <b>And from what point are the garments</b> of the man <b>rendered impure,</b> as it is stated that he is impure and his clothes requires immersion? <b>From</b> the moment <b>he emerges outside the wall of Jerusalem. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> His clothes are rendered impure only <b>from the moment that he pushes</b> the goat <b>from the cliff.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: There</b> were <b>ten booths, and</b> the distance between Jerusalem and the cliff was <b>twelve <i>mil</i>;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> There were <b>nine booths and</b> the distance was <b>ten <i>mil</i>. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> There were <b>five booths and</b> the distance was <b>ten <i>mil</i>, and all of them</b> were able to escort the one leading the goat <b>by</b> establishing <b>a joining</b> of boundaries [<i>eiruv teḥumin</i>] before Yom Kippur, allowing those at each booth to walk to the next booth.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yosei said: Elazar my son told me: If</b> they were able to walk to the next booth <b>by</b> establishing <b>an <i>eiruv</i>, I could even make two booths</b> suffice for the distance of <b>ten <i>mil</i>.</b> With the proper placement of an <i>eiruv</i>, an individual is permitted to walk a distance of two <i>mil</i>, which is four thousand cubits. Consequently, the people of Jerusalem could escort the one leading the goat a distance of two <i>mil</i>, and the people of the first booth could walk two <i>mil</i> from the booth toward Jerusalem to meet him, and escort him back to their booth. Others at that booth, who had established their <i>eiruv</i> in the direction of the second booth, could then escort the one leading the goat two <i>mil</i> toward the second booth, where he would be met by people from the second booth, who would escort him the remaining two <i>mil</i> to the booth. This booth would be located only two <i>mil</i> from the cliff.

### Part 5
The Gemara comments: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is <b>that which was taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: People from all the booths would escort the one leading the goat, <b>except for the last</b> person in the last booth, <b>who did not reach the cliff with him; rather, he stands from a distance and observes his actions? In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this statement? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> as he holds that the last booth was too far from the cliff for the people there to escort the one leading the goat the entire way.

### Part 6
It was taught in the mishna: <b>At each and every booth</b> people there <b>say to him: Here is food; here is water,</b> if you need it. It was <b>taught: No man</b> who escorted the goat <b>ever needed this</b> food and water. <b>However,</b> they would offer it to him anyway, <b>because one who has bread in his basket is not similar to one who does not have bread in his basket.</b> One who does not have food available to him is concerned that he will not be able to find any if he really needs it, and he therefore feels his hunger and thirst more acutely.

### Part 7
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>What did</b> the person designated to dispatch the goat <b>do</b> there? <b>He divided a strip of crimson</b> into two parts, half of the strip tied to the rock, and half of it tied between the two horns of the goat. The Gemara asks: <b>Let him tie the whole</b> strip <b>to the rock.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since it is a mitzva</b> to push <b>the goat</b> from the cliff. If he tied the whole strip to the rock, <b>perhaps it would turn white quickly, and his mind would be eased</b> with the knowledge that the sins of the Jewish people had been forgiven. He would then not fulfill the mitzva of pushing the goat off the cliff. He therefore tied part of it between the horns of the goat and looked to see if it became white. Once he was actively involved with the goat, he would remember to push it off the cliff.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let him tie the whole</b> strip <b>between</b> the goat’s <b>horns.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Sometimes the goat turns its head and</b> he <b>will not know</b> if the strip turns white or not.

### Part 9
<b>The Sages taught: At first they would tie</b> this <b>strip of crimson to the opening of the Entrance Hall</b> of the Temple <b>on the outside.</b> If the strip <b>turned white they would rejoice,</b> as this indicated that their sins had been atoned for. If <b>it did not turn white they would be sad and ashamed.</b> When the Sages saw that people were overly distressed on Yom Kippur, <b>they established that they should tie</b> the strip of crimson <b>to the opening of the Entrance Hall on the inside,</b> since only a few could actually go in to see it. <b>And</b> they <b>would still peek and see:</b> If <b>it turned white, they would rejoice,</b> and if <b>it did not turn white they would be sad.</b> Therefore, the Sages <b>established that they should tie half of</b> the strip <b>to the rock and half of it between</b> the goat’s <b>horns,</b> so that the people would not know what happened to the strip until after the conclusion of Yom Kippur.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Naḥum bar Pappa said in the name of Rabbi Elazar HaKappar: At first they would tie the strip of crimson to the opening of the Entrance Hall</b> of the Temple <b>on the inside, and when the goat reached the wilderness,</b> the strip of crimson <b>would turn white, and they knew that the mitzva was fulfilled.</b> The verse alludes to the use of the strip of crimson, as it <b>is stated: “Though your sins be as scarlet, they will become white as snow;</b> though they be red like crimson, they will be as wool” (Isaiah 1:18). This verse indicates that when something scarlet turns white, it is a sign of atonement and forgiveness for the sins of the Jewish people.

### Part 11
§ It was taught in the mishna that the goat <b>would not reach halfway</b> down <b>the mountain</b> before it was torn limb from limb. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What</b> is the status of <b>those limbs?</b> Is it permitted to derive <b>pleasure</b> from them? <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed with regard to this issue. <b>One said they are permitted</b> for benefit, <b>and one said they are prohibited.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara explains their reasoning: <b>The one who said they are permitted</b> for benefit
