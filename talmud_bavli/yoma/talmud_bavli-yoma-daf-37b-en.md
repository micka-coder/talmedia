### Part 1
<b>Abaye said:</b> Although gold is not suitable for knife blades, as it is too soft for use in slaughter, the mishna is referring to <b>knife handles.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a different <i>baraita</i>: King Munbaz <b>also made</b> the <b>bases of vessels,</b> the <b>grips of vessels,</b> the <b>handles of vessels, and the handles of knives of Yom Kippur of gold.</b> Apparently, knives are not categorized as vessels; therefore, the handles of the Yom Kippur vessels that Munbaz donated were not knife handles. The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye interpreted</b> that Munbaz donated gold for the <b>handles of axes and hatchets.</b> The blades of these implements cannot be made of gold; rather, like knives, they require stronger material.

### Part 2
§ The mishna continues: Queen <b>Helene, his mother, fashioned a</b> decorative <b>gold chandelier</b> above the entrance of the Sanctuary. It was <b>taught</b> in a mishna: <b>When the sun rose, sparks</b> of light would <b>emanate from</b> the chandelier, which was polished, <b>and everyone knew that the time</b> to <b>recite <i>Shema</i> had arrived.</b> The ideal time to recite <i>Shema</i> is at the moment of sunrise.

### Part 3
The Gemara <b>raises an objection: One who recites <i>Shema</i></b> in the <b>morning with the men of the priestly watch,</b> who served in the Temple during a given week, <b>or with the men of the non-priestly watch,</b> designated groups of Israelites who accompanied the priestly watch to Jerusalem that week, <b>did not fulfill</b> his obligation. That is <b>because the men of the priestly watch</b> recite <i>Shema</i> too <b>early</b> so that they will have sufficient time to perform the Temple service, <b>and the men of the non-priestly watch,</b> who recite lengthy prayers and stand over the daily morning offering when it is sacrificed, <b>postpone</b> reciting <i>Shema</i>. For whom, then, did the emanating sparks signal the time to recite <i>Shema</i>? <b>Abaye said:</b> It was an indicator <b>for the rest of the people in Jerusalem,</b> who recited <i>Shema</i> at the appropriate time to recite <i>Shema</i>.

### Part 4
§ The mishna relates: Queen Helene <b>also fashioned</b> a golden <b>tablet</b> on which the <i>sota</i> Torah portion was written. The Gemara comments: <b>You learn from this</b> that <b>one</b> may <b>write a scroll</b> that contains only several portions of the Torah, <b>from which a child may be taught.</b> The Sages disputed whether it is permitted to do so even for the purpose of education. <b>Reish Lakish said in the name of Rabbi Yannai:</b> There is no proof from this mishna, as the tablet prepared by Queen Helene consisted of the letters <b>of</b> the <b><i>alef</i>-<i>beit</i>,</b> i.e., only the first letter of each word was written on the tablet, representing the word.

### Part 5
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>sota</i>: <b>When</b> the scribe <b>writes</b> the <i>sota</i> scroll, <b>he looks and writes that which is written on the tablet.</b> Apparently, the full text of the passage was written on the tablet. The Gemara rejects this: Emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>say: He looks and writes like</b> that <b>which is written on the tablet.</b> The tablet aids the scribe in remembering the text that must be written.

### Part 6
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>When he writes, he looks and writes that which is written on the tablet. And what is written on the tablet? If a man lay with you…and if he did not lay with you; if you strayed…if you did not stray</b> (see Numbers 5:19–20). Apparently, the full text of the passage was written on the tablet. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> it was written
