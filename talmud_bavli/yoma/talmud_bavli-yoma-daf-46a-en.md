### Part 1
<b>but from this side or from that side</b> of the altar, both of which are not directly in front of the Sanctuary’s entrance, I would <b>say</b> that <b>no,</b> the fire may not be taken from there. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to write both terms in order to teach this <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Elazar said in the name of bar Kappara: Rabbi Meir would say:</b> With regard to <b>limbs of a burnt-offering that remained</b> on the altar from the previous night and which were not fully consumed, <b>one should make a separate arrangement</b> of wood <b>for them and arrange them</b> upon it to be burned. <b>And</b> this is done <b>even on Shabbat.</b>

### Part 3
<b>What is</b> bar Kappara <b>teaching us</b> when he informs us that Rabbi Meir requires a separate arrangement to be made? Surely, <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> this in the mishna that cites Rabbi Meir as saying: <b>On every</b> other <b>day, there were four arrangements</b> of wood <b>there,</b> upon the altar. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Avin said:</b> Bar Kappara’s teaching <b>is needed only</b> in order to teach the requirement to set up a fourth arrangement, even though it is only for limbs of <b>disqualified</b> offerings. As certain disqualifications apply only <i>ab initio</i>, if the offering is nevertheless brought upon the altar it should not then be removed. Bar Kappara teaches that Rabbi Meir’s ruling applies in the event that limbs of such an offering were not fully consumed.

### Part 4
The Gemara qualifies this: <b>But</b> this applies <b>specifically</b> when <b>the fire has</b> already <b>taken hold of them</b> and they have begun to burn. <b>But</b> if <b>the fire</b> has not yet <b>taken hold of them, no,</b> a separate arrangement is not made in order to burn them.

### Part 5
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of this qualification: <b>Both</b> with regard to the limbs of <b>valid</b> offerings <b>and</b> of <b>disqualified</b> offerings, <b>if the fire has</b> already <b>taken hold of them</b> and they have begun to burn, <b>yes,</b> a separate arrangement is made to burn them, <b>but if</b> the fire did not take hold of them, <b>no,</b> a separate arrangement is not made in order to burn them.

### Part 6
Bar Kappara concluded: <b>And</b> this is done <b>even on Shabbat.</b> But surely, <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> this in the mishna that cites Rabbi Meir as saying: <b>But</b> on <b>this day,</b> on Yom Kippur, there are <b>five.</b> This means that the arrangement for burning any remaining limbs is made also on Yom Kippur, despite the fact that all the Shabbat prohibitions apply.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> Nevertheless, bar Kappara’s teaching <b>is necessary,</b> for <b>it could enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this applies</b> only <b>when Yom Kippur occurs after Shabbat,</b> i.e., on Sunday. Perhaps only in such a case is a separate arrangement made, based on the accepted law <b>that</b> leftover <b>fats of Shabbat</b> offerings <b>are sacrificed</b> and burned <b>on Yom Kippur. However,</b> if Yom Kippur occurs <b>in the middle of the week,</b> then perhaps <b>no,</b> a separate arrangement is not made in order to burn them. Therefore, bar Kappara <b>teaches us</b> that Rabbi Meir’s ruling applies in all cases.

### Part 8
<b>Rava said: Who is this that does not care about his flour,</b> i.e., he does not truly care about what he says and speaks imprecisely? <b>Did we</b> not <b>learn</b> in the mishna: <b>On every</b> other <b>day.</b> This clearly implies that Rabbi Meir’s ruling applies equally to all days of the week. As such, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov’s justification for bar Kappara’s teaching is already implied in Rabbi Meir’s words in the mishna. The Gemara comments: Indeed, it is <b>difficult.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara comments: Both Rava and bar Kappara hold that a separate arrangement is made even on Shabbat. This <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, who said: The beginning</b> of the sacrificial service of the daily offering, i.e., its slaughter, the sprinkling of its blood, and its burning <b>overrides</b> Shabbat; <b>the end</b> of its service, i.e., the burning of its sacrificial parts, <b>does not override</b> Shabbat.

### Part 10
The Gemara analyzes Rav Huna’s statement: Returning to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Huna said: The beginning</b> of the sacrificial service of the <b>daily offering overrides</b> a <i>halakha</i>, whereas <b>the end</b> of its service <b>does not override</b> a <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 11
Previously, the Gemara assumed that Rav Huna was discussing the possibility that the sacrifice of the daily offering overrides Shabbat. The Gemara now clarifies if this was his intention: <b>What</b> is meant by saying that the end of its service <b>does not override</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> Although the end of its service <b>does override Shabbat, it does not override</b> the <i>halakha</i> that it should not be brought in a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b> This is true although the beginning of the sacrificial service of the daily offering may, if necessary, be brought in a state of ritual impurity. <b>And Rabba said:</b> The end of its service <b>overrides</b> only the <i>halakha</i> that it should not be brought in a state of <b>ritual impurity, but it does not override Shabbat.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>It</b> poses <b>a difficulty to your</b> opinion, <b>and it</b> poses <b>a difficulty to</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda. It</b> is <b>difficult to your opinion</b> as follows: <b>What is different</b> about the prohibition of bringing an offering in a state of <b>ritual impurity</b> that the daily offering overrides it? <b>Because it is written</b> with regard to the daily offering <b>“in its season”</b> (Numbers 28:2), to emphasize that it should be brought under all circumstances, even if that means that it will be brought <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b> But, by that logic, the daily offering should <b>also</b> override <b>Shabbat.</b> Because the term <b>“in its season”</b> emphasizes that it should be brought under all circumstances, this means <b>even on Shabbat.</b>

### Part 13
<b>And it</b> is <b>difficult to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda: What is different</b> about <b>Shabbat</b> that the daily offering overrides it? <b>Because it is written “in its season,”</b> to emphasize that it should be brought under all circumstances, <b>even on Shabbat.</b> But by that logic, the daily offering should <b>also</b> override the prohibition of bringing an offering in a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b> Because the term <b>“in its season”</b> emphasizes that it should be brought under all circumstances, this means <b>even in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b>

### Part 14
Rabba <b>said to him: It</b> is <b>not difficult to my</b> opinion <b>and it does not</b> pose <b>a difficulty to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda. It</b> is <b>not difficult to my</b> opinion, because I hold that <b>the end of</b> its sacrificial rite <b>is like its beginning.</b>
