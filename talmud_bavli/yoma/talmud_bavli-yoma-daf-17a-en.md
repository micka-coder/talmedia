### Part 1
<b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from it</b> that that the <i>mishnayot</i> in tractate <i>Middot</i> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov?</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from it</b> that this is so.

### Part 2
§ In an additional attempt to resolve the contradiction with regard to the Chamber of the Lambs, <b>Rav Adda, son of Rav Yitzḥak, said: This chamber was removed</b> from the corner, as it was not actually in the corner of the Hall of the Hearth but was located along the middle of the western side of the hall. <b>And</b> therefore, for one <b>who comes from the north,</b> the chamber <b>appears to him</b> to be in the <b>south</b> of the hall; <b>and</b> for one <b>who comes from the south,</b> the chamber <b>appears to him</b> to be in the <b>north</b> of the hall.

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: In any event, <b>it is reasonable</b> to say that this chamber <b>was</b> closer to the <b>southwest</b> corner than it was to the northwest corner. <b>From where</b> does one arrive at that conclusion? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that we raise a contradiction</b> between the mishna in tractate <i>Tamid</i>, where we learned that the chamber in which the <b>shewbread</b> was prepared stood in the northeast corner, and the mishna in tractate <i>Middot</i>, where we learned that the chamber in which the <b>shewbread</b> was prepared stood in the southeast corner.

### Part 4
<b>And we resolve</b> the contradiction based on what <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: The Master</b> in tractate <i>Middot</i> <b>envisions</b> the chambers as one coming <b>via</b> the <b>right,</b> from the south to the east, then to the north and then to the west. And <b>the Master</b> in tractate <i>Tamid</i> <b>envisions</b> the chambers as one coming <b>via</b> the <b>left,</b> from the south to the west, then to the north and then to the east. Both agree with regard to the location of the chamber in which the shewbread was prepared; they merely describe that location from different perspectives.
