### Part 1
<b><i>Peh</i>, <i>zayin</i>, <i>reish</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>beit</i>,</b> an acronym for: Lottery [<i>payis</i>], as a new lottery is performed on that day to determine which priests will sacrifice the offerings that day, and the order established on <i>Sukkot</i> does not continue; the blessing of time [<i>zeman</i>]: Who has given us life, sustained us, and brought us to this time, is recited just as it is recited at the start of each Festival; Festival [<i>regel</i>], as it is considered a Festival in and of itself and there is no mitzva to reside in the <i>sukka</i> (see <i>Tosafot</i>); offering [<i>korban</i>], as the number of offerings sacrificed on the Eighth Day is not a continuation of the number offered on <i>Sukkot</i> but is part of a new calculation; song [<i>shira</i>], as the Psalms recited by the Levites as the offerings were sacrificed on the Eighth Day are not a continuation of those recited on <i>Sukkot</i>; blessing [<i>berakha</i>], as the addition to the third blessing of Grace after Meals and in the <i>Amida</i> prayer (see <i>Tosafot</i>) is phrased differently than the addition recited on <i>Sukkot</i>.

### Part 2
<b>However,</b> despite all these differences, <b>with regard to compensation</b> for failure to sacrifice the Festival offerings at the earliest opportunity, everyone agrees that <b>it is</b> a day of <b>compensation for</b> obligations not met during the <b>first</b> Festival, <b>as didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>One who did not celebrate on the first Festival day</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> by sacrificing the Festival offering may <b>celebrate</b> and sacrifice the Festival offering throughout <b>the whole Festival in its entirety,</b> including <b>the last Festival day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>. Apparently, the Eighth Day of Assembly is considered the last Festival day of Sukkot and is appended to it with regard to its obligations.

### Part 3
The Gemara challenges further: <b>And say</b> that the priest should be sequestered before the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i>,</b> which is a Festival preceded by weekdays, as there too <b>it is</b> a matter of <b>sequestering of seven</b> days <b>for one day. Rabbi Abba said:</b> There is a distinction between the inauguration and <i>Shavuot</i>, as <b>one derives</b> an instance where the obligatory offering is <b>one bull and one ram,</b> Yom Kippur, <b>from</b> an instance where the obligatory offering is <b>one bull and one ram,</b> the inauguration, <b>to the exclusion of <i>Shavuot</i>,</b> when <b>they are two rams</b> that are offered.

### Part 4
The Gemara challenges: <b>This</b> works out <b>well</b> according <b>to the one who said</b> that the obligatory offering on <b>Yom Kippur is one ram; however,</b> according <b>to the one who said</b> that <b>they are two rams</b> that are sacrificed on Yom Kippur, <b>what is there to say?</b> According to that opinion, Yom Kippur is not comparable to the inauguration. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One ram is the one that is mentioned here;</b> as it is written: “With this Aaron will come into the Sanctuary, with a young bull for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 16:3), and <b>it is the</b> same <b>one that is mentioned in the book of Numbers:</b> “And on the tenth day of the seventh month you will have a sacred gathering when you will afflict your souls; you will not do any labor, and you will offer a burnt-offering to the Lord for a sweet aroma: One young bull, one ram…” (Numbers 29:7–8). <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: They are two rams</b> offered on Yom Kippur, <b>one mentioned here</b> in the book of Leviticus <b>and one mentioned in the book of Numbers.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects this solution: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> and two rams are brought on Yom Kippur, a distinction remains between Yom Kippur and <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>There,</b> with regard to Yom Kippur, <b>one</b> ram, mentioned in the book of Leviticus, is <b>for the obligation of the day,</b> the atonement of Yom Kippur; <b>and one</b> ram, mentioned in the book of Numbers, is for the <b>additional offerings.</b> This is <b>to the exclusion of</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b><i>Shavuot</i>, where both</b> rams <b>are obligations of the day.</b> Therefore, there is no basis for deriving the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <i>Shavuot</i> from the inauguration.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that the requirement derived is to sequester the priest prior to <b>Rosh HaShana, as</b> there, too, <b>it is sequestering of seven</b> days <b>for one day.</b> The days before Rosh HaShana are weekdays, and as in the inauguration, a bull and a ram are sacrificed. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that this too is rejected: <b>One derives a bull and a ram</b> that the High Priest brings <b>from his own</b> property on Yom Kippur <b>from a bull and a ram</b> that Aaron brought <b>from his own</b> property at the inauguration. This is <b>to the exclusion of <i>Shavuot</i> and Rosh HaShana,</b> when the bull and the ram sacrificed are <b>from community</b> property and not owned by the priest. The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> works out <b>well</b> according <b>to the one who said</b> that every time the Torah utilizes the phrase: <b>Take you,</b> it means <b>from your own</b> property,
