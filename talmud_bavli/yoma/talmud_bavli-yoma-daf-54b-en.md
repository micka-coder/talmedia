It means <b>like a man</b> joined and <b>clinging to his <i>livaya</i>,</b> his partner, i.e., his wife. In other words, the cherubs appeared to be embracing one another. <b>Reish Lakish said: When gentiles</b> destroyed the Second Temple and <b>entered the Sanctuary, they saw</b> these drawings of <b>cherubs clinging to one another.</b> They peeled them from the wall, <b>took them out to the market, and said: These Jews, whose blessing is a blessing and whose curse is a curse,</b> due to their great fear of God, should <b>they be occupied with such matters,</b> making images of this kind? <b>They immediately debased</b> and destroyed <b>them, as it is stated: “All who honored her debase her because they have seen her nakedness”</b> (Lamentations 1:8).

### Part 2
§ The mishna taught that a stone sat in the Holy of Holies <b>and it was called</b> the <b>foundation [<i>shetiyya</i>]</b> rock. A Sage <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: Why was it called <i>shetiyya</i>? It is <b>because the world was created [<i>hushtat</i>] from it.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>We learned</b> the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who said</b> that <b>the world was created from Zion. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The world was created from its center, as it is stated: “When the dust runs into a mass, and the clods cleave fast together”</b> (Job 38:38). The world was created by adding matter to the center, like the formation of clumps of earth.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The <b>world was created from the sides, as it is stated: “For He said to the snow: Become the earth, likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of His mighty rain”</b> (Job 37:6). This verse indicates that the rains fell from all sides, which led to the creation of the earth. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, cast a stone into the sea, from which the world was created, as it is stated: “Upon what were its foundations fastened; or who laid its cornerstone?”</b> (Job 38:6).

### Part 4
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The world <b>was created from Zion, as it is stated: “A Psalm of Asaph. God, the Lord God</b> has spoken and called the earth, from the rising of the sun to its place of setting” (Psalms 50:1), <b>and it states: “Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,</b> God has shined forth” (Psalms 50:2). The mishna is taught in accordance with this last opinion.

### Part 5
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: “These are the generations of the heaven and the earth when they were created, on the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven”</b> (Genesis 2:4) means that the <b>generations of the heavens,</b> i.e., all things found in the heavens, <b>were created from the heavens,</b> while the <b>generations of the earth were created from the earth.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And the Rabbis say: Both these and those were created from Zion, as it is stated: “A Psalm of Asaph. God, the Lord God has spoken and called the earth, from the rising of the sun to its place of setting,” and it says: “Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shined forth,”</b> i.e., <b>from</b> Zion <b>the beauty of the world was perfected,</b> which includes both the generations of the heavens and the generations of the earth.

### Part 7
§ The mishna taught that the High Priest <b>took the blood</b> of the bull <b>from</b> the one <b>who was stirring it</b> so it would not coagulate, <b>and he entered</b> and sprinkled it like one who whips. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>Like one who whips? Rav Yehuda demonstrated</b> the action with his hand,
