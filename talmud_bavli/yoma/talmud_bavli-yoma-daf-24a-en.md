### Part 1
The phrase comes <b>to include worn out</b> garments, teaching that as long as they have not become tattered they may be used for Temple services.

### Part 2
The Gemara continues with another <i>baraita</i> connected to this debate. With regard to the garments of the High Priest, the Torah states: “And Aaron shall go into the tent of meeting, and he shall take off the linen garments that he had put on when he went into the Sanctuary, <b>and shall leave them there”</b> (Leviticus 16:23). This verse <b>teaches that</b> the linen garments worn by the High Priest during the Yom Kippur service <b>require storing away,</b> i.e., they may not be used again. <b>Rabbi Dosa says:</b> They do not have to be stored away, because although they may not be used again by the High Priest on a subsequent Yom Kippur, <b>they are acceptable</b> for use <b>for a common priest. And what,</b> then, is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And shall leave them there,”</b> which implies that they are not to be used again? It means <b>that</b> the High Priest himself <b>may not use them</b> on a <b>subsequent Yom Kippur</b> for service in the Holy of Holies; it does not mean that they may not be used at all.

### Part 3
The Gemara returns to the question of whether or not the removal of the ashes is considered a bona fide Temple service, requiring all four priestly garments, and whether or not this is the subject of debate between <i>tanna’im</i>. <b>What, is it not with regard to this that</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Dosa <b>disagree: One Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, who derives from the phrase “he shall wear” that all four garments are required, <b>holds</b> that the removal of the ashes <b>is a</b> bona fide <b>service; and one Sage,</b> Rabbi Dosa, who derives a different teaching from “he shall wear,” <b>holds</b> that <b>it is not a</b> bona fide <b>service,</b> and consequently only two of the four garments are required? Their dispute would therefore be identical to the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: It is possible to say that this is <b>not</b> the subject of debate between these two <i>tanna’im</i>. Rather, <b>everyone</b> agrees that the removal of ashes <b>is</b> a bona fide Temple <b>service</b> requiring all four garments, <b>and here they disagree about</b> a different point, which is <b>this: One Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>a</b> derivation from the <b>verse is necessary</b> to <b>include</b> the mitre and belt, which are not mentioned explicitly in the verse. <b>And one Sage,</b> Rabbi Dosa, <b>holds that</b> since the removal of the ash is a bona fide Temple service it is obvious that all four garments are required, so a derivation from <b>a verse</b> to include the other two garments <b>is not necessary.</b> Accordingly, both <i>tanna’im</i> are in agreement that the removal of ash is a bona fide service and requires all four priestly garments.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rabbi Avin raised a dilemma: How much</b> ash must be removed in order to fulfill the mitzva of <b>removal of the ashes? Do we derive it from the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> the portion that the Levite sets aside for the priest, in which case one hundredth of the total is separated, <b>or do we derive it from the donations</b> that were set aside from the spoils of the war with <b>Midian, where</b> one five-hundredth was taken from the spoils of war (see Numbers 31:28)? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a teaching with regard to this dilemma. <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>it is stated here: “And he shall take up</b> the ashes” (Leviticus 6:3), <b>and it is said elsewhere,</b> with regard to a meal-offering: <b>“And he shall take up</b> a handful of the choice flour of the meal-offering” (Leviticus 6:8). <b>Just as there,</b> the amount he removes is <b>a handful</b> of flour, <b>so too, here,</b> he removes <b>a handful</b> of ash. The amount of ashes removed from the altar is therefore not a fixed percentage of the total ash.

### Part 6
§ <b>Rav said:</b> Although a non-priest may not perform any Temple service, <b>there are</b> only <b>four</b> Temple <b>services</b> for which <b>a non-priest is liable to</b> receive the punishment of <b>death</b> by God’s hand for doing so. They are: <b>Sprinkling</b> sacrificial blood on the altar, <b>and burning</b> incense or parts of sacrificial animals on the altar, <b>and</b> pouring out <b>the water libation</b> on the altar on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>and</b> pouring out <b>the wine libation</b> on the altar. <b>And Levi said:</b> This is true <b>also</b> for <b>the removal of the ashes. And similarly, Levi taught in his</b> collection of <b><i>baraitot</i>: The removal of ashes</b> is <b>also</b> included among those services for which a non-priest incurs the death penalty if he performs them.

### Part 7
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason for Rav’s</b> opinion? <b>As it is written: “And you and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood in everything pertaining to the altar and to that within the veil; and you shall serve; I give you the priesthood as a service of gift; and the common man that draws near shall be put to death”</b> (Numbers 18:7). Rav interprets this verse as follows: <b>“A service of gift”</b> indicates a service that involves giving, i.e., placing something on the altar, <b>and not a service</b> that involves <b>removal</b> from the altar, to the exclusion of removing the ashes. <b>“And you shall serve [<i>va’avadtem</i>]”</b> is interpreted as referring to <b>a service that is complete [<i>avoda tamma</i>]</b> on its own, such as sprinkling the blood, <b>and not</b> a service that is not complete, i.e., <b>a service that</b> is only a preparatory step and <b>has another service after it</b> that completes its purpose, such as slaughtering the animal or collecting its blood, which are only preparatory steps leading up to the sprinkling of the blood on the altar.

### Part 8
<b>And</b> what is the reason for the opinion of <b>Levi?</b> Why does he include the removal of ashes? According to him, <b>the Merciful One includes</b> this service by adding <b>“in everything pertaining to the altar,”</b> which teaches that all actions performed on the altar, including the removal of ashes, are significant and are prohibited to a non-priest on pain of death. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rav</b> learn from the phrase “in everything pertaining to the altar”? The Gemara answers: According to him, the word “everything” in <b>that</b> phrase comes <b>to include the seven sprinklings that are</b> performed <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary, when the blood of certain offerings is sprinkled on the veil of the Holy of Holies, <b>and</b> the seven sprinklings of oil <b>of the leper,</b> which are also performed inside the Sanctuary. Rav learns from the word “everything” that if a non-priest were to perform any of these actions he would be liable to receive the death penalty, despite the fact that they are not performed on the altar.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>Levi</b> derive these cases? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> them <b>from</b> the superfluous wording of the text. As the entire phrase <b>“pertaining</b> to the altar” is superfluous, he derives from this the inclusion of the removal of the ashes. Additionally, the expression <b>“everything pertaining”</b> implies a further inclusion, from which he derives the internal sprinklings mentioned above. <b>And</b> what does <b>Rav</b> learn from this superfluous wording? Rav does <b>not derive</b> anything particular from the distinction between the expressions <b>“pertaining</b> to the altar” and <b>“everything pertaining</b> to the altar.”

### Part 10
The Gemara asks about Levi’s position: <b>But say</b> that the verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>“In everything pertaining”</b> is a <b>generalization,</b> and <b>“a service of gift”</b> is a <b>specification,</b> indicating a case of <b>a generalization</b> followed by <b>a specification.</b> One of the principles of hermeneutics states that in such cases, <b>the generalization includes only what</b> is mentioned explicitly <b>in the specification.</b> Following that rule, one would conclude: <b>A service of giving,</b> i.e., placing on the altar, <b>yes,</b> this is included, but <b>a service of removal</b> is <b>not</b> included. This presents a difficulty for Levi. The Gemara responds that <b>the verse states:</b>
