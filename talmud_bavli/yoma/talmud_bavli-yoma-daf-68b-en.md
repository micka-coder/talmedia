### Part 1
<b>North of Jerusalem, and outside of three camps. Rabbi Yosei says: They are burned in the place of the ashes.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rava said: Who is</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> who disagrees with Rabbi Yosei</b> on this issue? <b>It is Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Where the ashes are poured out [<i>shefekh hadeshen</i>] shall it be burned”</b> (Leviticus 4:12), which means <b>that there shall</b> already <b>be ash there</b> in that place, so that it is known as the ash heap even before this animal is burned there. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> This verse indicates <b>that its place should be slanted [<i>meshupakh</i>]</b> so that ash that is deposited there will roll downhill. Rava understood that whereas Rabbi Yosei requires that there already be ash present when the bull is burned, Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov does not.

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> There is no proof from here, as <b>perhaps they disagree</b> only <b>about whether the place must be slanted.</b> Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov may agree there should be ash there to begin with, but he adds that the place must also be slanted. Therefore, there is no proof to support Rava’s statement.

### Part 4
<b>The Sages taught:</b> It states: <b>“And he who burns</b> them shall wash his garments” (Leviticus 16:28), to indicate that only the <b>garments</b> of the one <b>who burns</b> the bull and goat of Yom Kippur <b>are rendered impure, but not</b> the garments of the one <b>who kindles the fire, and not</b> the garments of the one <b>who arranges the pile</b> of wood. <b>And who is the one who burns? It is the one who assists at the</b> actual <b>time of burning.</b>

### Part 5
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>garments would be rendered impure even</b> after the bull and goat have <b>become ash.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: Them,</b> to indicate that <b>they</b> themselves, the bull and goat of Yom Kippur, <b>render garments impure, but they do not render garments impure once they become ash. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: The bull causes ritual impurity</b> before it is burned, but once <b>the flesh is burned it no longer renders garments impure.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between the</b> opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> and the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a difference <b>between them when he turned it into a charred</b> mass and the form of the animal has already become distorted but has not actually become ash. According to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, it no longer causes impurity.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>They said to the High Priest: The goat has reached the wilderness. And how did they know</b> in the Temple <b>that the goat reached the wilderness? They would build platforms [<i>dirkaot</i>]</b> all along the way and people would stand on them <b>and wave scarves [<i>sudarin</i>]</b> to signal when the goat arrived. <b>And</b> therefore <b>they knew that the goat reached the wilderness.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> Why did they need these platforms? <b>Didn’t they</b> already <b>have a reliable indicator? From Jerusalem to Beit Ḥiddudo,</b> the edge of the wilderness, where the mitzva of dispatching the goat was performed, was a distance of <b>three <i>mil</i>.</b> Since the nobles of Jerusalem <b>walked a <i>mil</i></b> to escort the dispatcher <b>and returned a <i>mil</i>, and waited</b> the time <b>equivalent</b> to the time it takes to walk <b>a <i>mil</i>, they knew that the goat reached the wilderness.</b> There was no need for the platforms.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Yishmael says: Didn’t they have a different indicator? There was a strip of crimson tied to the entrance to the Sanctuary, and when</b> the <b>goat reached the wilderness</b> and the mitzva was fulfilled <b>the strip would turn white, as it is stated: “Though your sins be as scarlet, they will become white as snow”</b> (Isaiah 1:18).

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Abaye said: Learn from this</b> that <b>Beit Ḥiddudo is located in the wilderness, and this</b> comes to <b>teach us that Rabbi Yehuda holds that once the goat has reached the wilderness, its mitzva is complete</b> even before it is pushed off the cliff, and there is no need to wait any longer.
