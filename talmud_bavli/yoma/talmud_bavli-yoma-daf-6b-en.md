### Part 1
<b>Rather,</b> must <b>it not</b> be that the <i>baraita</i> is equating them with regard <b>to their immersion,</b> in that both one who has relations with a menstruating woman and one impure with impurity imparted by a corpse immerse during the day?

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects that conclusion. <b>No; actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> the duration of <b>their impurity.</b> Although there is nothing novel in that equation, it <b>was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to teach <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>However,</b> in one sense, the case of <b>one</b> who is impure because he <b>had relations with a menstruating woman</b> is <b>more severe than</b> one impure with impurity imparted by a corpse. One who is impure because he had relations with a menstruating woman <b>transmits impurity through</b> lying on <b>a bed or</b> sitting on <b>a chair,</b> even if he never came into direct contact with the chair or the bed. He renders the bed or chair impure <b>with a mild</b> form of <b>impurity.</b> He confers upon them first-degree ritual impurity status, sufficient only to <b>render foods and liquids impure.</b> One impure with impurity imparted by a corpse transmits impurity by means of direct contact.

### Part 3
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an additional proof <b>that Rabbi Ḥiyya taught:</b> For <b>the <i>zav</i> and the <i>zava</i> and the leper and the female leper, and one who had relations with a menstruating woman, and one who is ritually impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>a corpse, their immersion is during the day.</b> For <b>a menstruating woman and a woman after childbirth, their immersion is at night.</b> The Gemara concludes that this <i>baraita</i> is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion of Rav Shimi from Neharde’a, who said that one who is impure because he had relations with a menstruating woman immerses at night.

### Part 4
With regard to the sequestering of the High Priest, the Gemara asks: <b>And before you remove him from the</b> potential of <b>impurity of his house, remove him from the</b> potential of the more severe <b>impurity</b> imparted by <b>a corpse.</b> The Sages should have instituted an ordinance prohibiting visitors to the High Priest lest one die while in his chamber and render him impure. <b>Rav Taḥlifa, father of Rav Huna bar Taḥlifa, said in the name of Rava: That is to say</b> that <b>impurity</b> imparted by a <b>corpse is permitted in</b> cases involving <b>the public.</b> In cases where the public is involved, impurity imparted by a corpse does not prevent the Temple service from being conducted. Since the service of the High Priest on Yom Kippur is a service involving communal offerings, impurity imparted by a corpse does not invalidate the service.

### Part 5
<b>Ravina said: Even</b> if <b>you say that impurity</b> imparted by <b>a corpse is</b> merely <b>overridden in public</b> and not completely permitted, the idea that the High Priest is not removed from the potential of impurity imparted by a corpse can be understood. <b>Impurity</b> imparted by <b>a corpse is uncommon.</b> The likelihood that one visiting the High Priest will suddenly die is minimal. In contrast, <b>impurity of his house is common,</b> as uncertainty with regard to his wife’s status as a menstruating woman could arise at any moment.

### Part 6
There is an amoraic dispute with regard to the effect of impurity imparted by a corpse on the conduct of the Temple service. <b>It was stated</b> with regard to <b>impurity</b> imparted by <b>a corpse</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said: It is permitted in</b> cases involving <b>the public;</b> e.g., when a majority of the Jewish people is impure, the service of a ritually pure priest is not preferable to that of an impure priest. The Temple service proceeds as though there was no impurity at all. <b>And Rav Sheshet said:</b> Impurity imparted by a corpse is merely <b>overridden in</b> cases involving <b>the public,</b> and service performed by a ritually pure priest is preferable.

### Part 7
The Gemara restricts the scope of the dispute. In a case <b>where there are</b> both <b>ritually impure and pure</b> priests in <b>that patrilineal family</b> tasked with serving in the Temple on that day, <b>everyone,</b> even Rav Naḥman, <b>agrees that the pure</b> priests <b>serve</b> and <b>the impure</b> priests <b>do not serve. When they disagree,</b> it is with regard to a case where the entire patrilineal family is impure. Is it necessary <b>to seek out and bring pure</b> priests <b>from a different patrilineal family</b> belonging to the same priestly watch, who are tasked with serving in the Temple on a different day that week?

### Part 8
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> The prohibition against performing the Temple service in a state of impurity imparted by a corpse <b>is permitted</b> in cases involving <b>the public, and we do not</b> need to <b>seek out</b> other priests. Since the Torah permitted the performance of the Temple service by priests impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, it is completely permitted and it is as though the service is performed in purity. <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> The prohibition of impurity imparted by a corpse <b>is overridden</b> in cases involving <b>the public,</b> and wherever possible <b>we seek out</b> ritually pure priests.

### Part 9
<b>Some say</b> that the dispute is slightly different: <b>Even</b> in a case <b>where there are</b> both <b>ritually pure and ritually impure</b> priests in <b>that patrilineal family, Rav Naḥman disagreed</b> with Rav Sheshet <b>and said</b> that the priests serve <b>even</b> when they are <b>impure,</b>
