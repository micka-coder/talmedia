### Part 1
<b>to enter directly,</b> as it is more appropriate for the High Priest to approach the Holy of Holies somewhat circuitously. <b>And</b> in response to this <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> could have <b>said to you: The Jewish people are beloved</b> by God, <b>as the Torah did not require them</b> to make use <b>of an agent,</b> e.g., an angel, to intercede on their behalf. Instead, God hears the nation’s prayers directly. Consequently, the High Priest, who represents the people on Yom Kippur, need not approach in a roundabout fashion.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if an indirect approach is a mark of respect, in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, too, let</b> the High Priest <b>enter</b> indirectly <b>between</b> the <b>candelabrum and the wall.</b> The Gemara answers: If the High Priest walks by that route, he might <b>blacken his clothes</b> through the soot left on the wall by the candelabrum.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Natan said:</b> With regard to the <b>one-cubit partition, the Sages did not determine</b> its status, <b>whether</b> it was part <b>of the inside</b> of the Holy of Holies <b>or</b> part <b>of the outside</b> area of the Sanctuary.

### Part 4
<b>Ravina strongly objects to this</b> opinion: <b>What is the reason</b> for this uncertainty? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>because it is written: “And the House that King Solomon built for the Lord was sixty cubits in length, and its width was twenty cubits, and its height was thirty cubits”</b> (I Kings 6:2), <b>and it is written: “And the House, that is, the Sanctuary, was forty cubits long”</b> (I Kings 6:17), <b>and it is written: “And before the partition twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in width, and twenty cubits in height”</b> (I Kings 6:20), <b>and</b> therefore <b>we do not know whether the one-cubit partition</b> was part <b>of these twenty</b> cubits of the Holy of Holies or part <b>of these forty</b> cubits of the Sanctuary, then this problem can be resolved.

### Part 5
Ravina explains the resolution of the problem: <b>But perhaps</b> it was <b>not</b> part <b>of these twenty</b> cubits <b>nor</b> part <b>of these forty</b> cubits, as in establishing the measurements the verse <b>counts the space</b> but <b>does not count</b> the <b>walls</b> themselves, i.e., the cubit of the wall is not included in either measurement. <b>Know</b> that it is so, <b>as anywhere that</b> the verse <b>counts</b> the area of <b>the walls</b> in addition to the spaces they contain, it also <b>counts</b> the one-cubit partition.

### Part 6
Ravina cites a proof for the previous claim. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>The Sanctuary</b> was <b>one hundred</b> cubits <b>by one hundred</b> cubits, <b>with a height of one hundred</b> cubits. From east to west, the hundred cubits were divided as follows: The <b>wall of the Entrance Hall</b> was <b>five</b> cubits; <b>and the Entrance Hall</b> itself was <b>eleven</b> cubits; the <b>wall of the Sanctuary</b> was <b>six</b> cubits; the <b>length</b> of the Sanctuary itself was <b>forty cubits; and</b> there was the <b>one-cubit partition;</b> the <b>Hall of</b> the <b>Holy of Holies</b> was another <b>twenty cubits;</b> the outer <b>wall of the Sanctuary</b> was <b>six</b> cubits; <b>and the chamber</b> behind it was <b>six</b> cubits; <b>and the wall of the chamber</b> was <b>five</b> cubits. This mishna proves that when the walls are counted in addition to the spaces, the one-cubit partition is included in the calculation.

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> the uncertainty does not concern the location of the one-cubit partition, which was certainly positioned between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies. Instead, the issue is <b>its sanctity, whether</b> it was considered <b>like the inside</b> of the Holy of Holies <b>or like the outside</b> area of the Sanctuary. Since there was no such wall in the Second Temple, the Sages were uncertain with regard to the status of the extra cubit.

### Part 8
§ <b>And this is what Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Yosef of Hutzal raised a dilemma</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And he prepared a partition in the midst of the House within to set there the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord”</b> (I Kings 6:19). This was his <b>dilemma</b> that <b>was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>what</b> case <b>is</b> the verse <b>speaking?</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara explains the dilemma. Should it be read: <b>And</b> Solomon <b>prepared a partition in the midst of the House within to set there,</b> meaning that he placed the partition within the Temple and behind it he prepared a space to place the Ark, and the partition itself did not possess the sanctity of the Holy of Holies? <b>Or perhaps this is</b> what the verse <b>states: A partition in the midst of the House within,</b> i.e., the verse ends there, while the rest of the text forms a new verse. According to this interpretation, the place of the partition itself was part of the Holy of Holies, and that was where Solomon prepared a place for the Ark.

### Part 10
The Gemara is surprised at this explanation: <b>And was</b> Yosef of Hutzal really <b>uncertain</b> how to punctuate this verse? <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Isi ben Yehuda says:</b> There are <b>five verses in the Torah whose</b> meaning <b>cannot be decided,</b> i.e., it is unclear from the text how the verses should be read.
