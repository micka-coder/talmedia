### Part 1
<b>about the ritual impurity of</b> the priest’s <b>home,</b> i.e., his wife. This is done lest he become impure through relations with a menstruating woman, which is ritual impurity lasting seven days. Therefore, he is removed from his home for seven days.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Reish Lakish: Granted,</b> according <b>to my</b> opinion, <b>that I derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of sequestering <b>from</b> the <b>inauguration,</b> that explains <b>that which is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: With regard to both <b>this</b> priest engaged in the burning of the red heifer <b>and that</b> High Priest prior to Yom Kippur, <b>one sprinkles upon him</b> for <b>all seven</b> days the purification water mixed with ashes from samples <b>from all</b> the previous red heifer <b>sin-offerings that were</b> safeguarded <b>there</b> in the Temple. The reason for this practice is <b>that there was also sprinkling during</b> the <b>inauguration. However, according to your</b> opinion, <b>that you derive it from Sinai, was there</b> in fact <b>sprinkling at Sinai?</b> According to your opinion, why are the priests sprinkled?

### Part 3
Reish Lakish <b>said to him: And according to your reasoning, does it</b> work out <b>well?</b> At the <b>inauguration,</b> the sprinkling was with <b>blood; here,</b> the sprinkling was with <b>water.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan answered: <b>That is not difficult, as Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: Water replaced blood,</b> but both have the status of sprinkling. <b>However, according to your</b> reasoning, <b>at Sinai, was there sprinkling</b> at all? Reish Lakish <b>said to him:</b> The Sages <b>merely</b> established <b>a higher standard,</b> and this sprinkling is not a requirement.

### Part 4
§ The Gemara comments: A <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that the sequestering is derived from the inauguration; <b>and</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> that it is derived from Sinai. The Gemara elaborates: A <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> It was stated with regard to the inauguration: <b>“With this Aaron will come into the Sanctuary,</b> with a young bull for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 16:3). To what is the term: With this, referring? It is referring to <b>that which is stated in the matter. What is</b> the matter? It is <b>the matter of the inauguration.</b> In the manner that the priest was prepared for the inauguration, so too is he prepared for Yom Kippur. <b>And what is stated in the matter of</b> the <b>inauguration?</b> It is that <b>Aaron</b> the priest <b>withdrew</b> for <b>seven</b> days <b>and served one day, and Moses transmitted</b> the Torah guidelines <b>to him all seven</b> days <b>in order to train him in the</b> Sanctuary <b>service.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And</b> throughout the <b>generations as well,</b> the <b>High Priest withdraws seven</b> days prior to Yom Kippur <b>and serves one day. And two Torah scholars from</b> among <b>the students of Moses, to the exclusion of Sadducees,</b> who are not students of Moses, <b>transmit</b> the Torah guidelines <b>to him all seven</b> days <b>in order to train him in the</b> Sanctuary <b>service.</b>

### Part 6
<b>From there</b> the Sages <b>said</b> in the mishna: <b>Seven days prior to Yom Kippur</b> the Sages would <b>remove the High Priest,</b> who performs the entire Yom Kippur service, <b>from his house to the Chamber of <i>Parhedrin</i>; and just as</b> the Sages would <b>remove the High Priest, so do they remove the priest who burns the heifer,</b> from his house <b>to the chamber that was before the <i>bira</i></b> at the <b>northeast</b> corner of the courtyard on the Temple Mount. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>both this</b> priest whom the Sages sequester prior to Yom Kippur <b>and that</b> priest whom the Sages sequester prior to engaging in the burning of the heifer, <b>one sprinkles upon him,</b> for <b>all seven</b> days of sequestering, the purification water with ashes <b>from all the</b> previous red heifer <b>sin-offerings that were</b> safeguarded <b>there</b> in the Temple.

### Part 7
<b>And if you say</b> that at the <b>inauguration</b> the sprinkling was with <b>blood,</b> and <b>here</b> the sprinkling was with <b>water, you said: Water replaced blood. And it says</b> in the verse: <b>“As has been done this day, so the Lord has commanded to do, to make atonement for you”</b> (Leviticus 8:34). <b>To do, these are the actions</b> performed in the burning <b>of the</b> red <b>heifer; to make atonement, these are the actions</b> performed on <b>Yom Kippur.</b> This <i>baraita</i>, then, is proof for the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan.

### Part 8
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>But</b> the term: <b>With this [<i>bezot</i>], is required for</b> the meaning of the verse <b>itself;</b> the priest is required to bring <b>a young bull for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering.</b> The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>If</b> the term comes to teach <b>only</b> with regard <b>to the offerings, let the verse say: With this [<i>bezeh</i>],</b> in the masculine, referring to the bull, <b>or: With these [<i>be’elleh</i>],</b> referring to the bull and the ram. <b>What,</b> then, may be derived from the use of the feminine term <b><i>bezot</i>,</b> which refers to neither the bull nor the ram? <b>Learn from it two</b> conclusions; one with regard to the offerings and one with regard to sequestering.

### Part 9
The Gemara continues its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>And it says?</b> Why does the <i>baraita</i> cite an additional proof from another verse? Why wasn’t the first proof sufficient? <b>And if you say</b> that <b>it is</b> on <b>the first Yom Kippur</b> when Aaron performed the service <b>that</b> the High Priest <b>requires sequestering, as we find in</b> the <b>inauguration</b> when the priests were sequestered before being consecrated as priests, <b>but on Yom Kippur in general, no,</b> subsequent High Priests do not require sequestering; or <b>alternatively,</b> if you say: <b>It is the first High Priest who requires sequestering,</b> as did all the priests during the inauguration, <b>but</b> subsequent <b>High Priests in general, no,</b> they do not require sequestering before Yom Kippur; then <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which it says in the verse: <b>“As has been done</b> this day, so the Lord has commanded to do,” meaning that this is a mitzva for all generations.

### Part 10
§ And a <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> that sequestering is derived from Sinai: <b>Moses ascended in the cloud, and was covered in the cloud, and was sanctified in the cloud, in order to receive the Torah for the Jewish people in sanctity, as it is stated: “And the glory of the Lord abode upon Mount Sinai</b> and the cloud covered him six days, and He called to Moses on the seventh day from the midst of the cloud” (Exodus 24:16). <b>This was an incident</b> that occurred <b>after the</b> revelation of <b>the Ten Commandments</b> to the Jewish people, and these six days <b>were the beginning</b> of the <b>forty days</b> that Moses was on the mountain (see Exodus 24:18); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> The opinion of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili corresponds to that of Reish Lakish; Moses withdrew for six days before receiving permission to stand in the presence of God.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This incident occurred before the revelation of the Ten Commandments to the Jewish people, and when the Torah says: <b>“And the glory of the Lord abode</b> upon Mount Sinai,” it is referring to the revelation of the Divine Presence that began on the <b>New Moon</b> of Sivan, which was six days before the revelation of the Ten Commandments.
