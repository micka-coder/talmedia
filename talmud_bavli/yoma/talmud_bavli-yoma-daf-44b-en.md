<b>except during</b> the <b>burning</b> of the incense.

### Part 2
<b>But there is</b> also <b>this higher standard, that whereas from the Sanctuary they remove</b> themselves <b>both during its own sanctification,</b> i.e., the blood presentations in the Sanctuary, <b>and during the sanctification of the innermost</b> chamber, i.e., the Holy of Holies, <b>but from</b> the area <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar, they remove</b> themselves <b>only during the sanctification of the Sanctuary. Rava said:</b> Indeed, there are numerous distinctions, but the <i>baraita</i> teaches only one because all the distinctions fit into <b>one category of removal.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara continues to analyze the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: Just as they remove themselves from the area between the Entrance Hall and the altar during the burning of the incense, <b>they similarly remove</b> themselves <b>during the</b> blood <b>presentations of the bull of the anointed priest; of the bull for an unwitting</b> communal <b>sin; and of the goats of idol worship. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rabbi Pedat said:</b> It is derived by a verbal analogy between the word <b>atonement</b> said in connection with those offerings and the word <b>atonement from</b> the prohibition on <b>Yom Kippur.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ahava said: Learn from this</b> that there is a prohibition in the area between the Entrance Hall and the altar. The <b>higher standards</b> applied to the various areas in the Temple are defined <b>by Torah law, and</b> the Sages <b>learned them</b> as a tradition.

### Part 5
<b>As if it could enter your mind</b> that these standards are defined <b>by rabbinic law, what is different</b> about the area <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar</b> that the prohibition applies only there? <b>Perhaps</b> other priests would accidentally <b>happen to enter</b> the Sanctuary while incense is burning there. But if that is the reason, then the rabbinic decree should require that <b>they remove</b> themselves <b>also from the entire Temple courtyard,</b> since <b>perhaps they</b> would accidentally <b>happen to enter.</b> The fact that the prohibition does not extend to the Temple courtyard suggests that the standards are defined by Torah law.

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects Rav Aḥa bar Ahava’s reasoning: The prohibition could indeed be rabbinic. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to limit it to the area <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar,</b> as follows: <b>Since there is nothing that separates it</b> from the Sanctuary, the distinction between the two areas <b>is not conspicuous,</b> and therefore people may err and enter. But with regard to the <b>Temple courtyard, since there is the outer altar that separates</b> the rest of the Temple courtyard from the Sanctuary, the distinction between the areas <b>is conspicuous,</b> and therefore there is no need to extend the prohibition throughout the Temple courtyard.

### Part 7
<b>Rava said: Learn from this</b> fact that there is a rabbinic prohibition in the area between the Entrance Hall and the altar. <b>The sanctity of the Entrance Hall</b> and the sanctity of the <b>Sanctuary is one matter,</b> i.e., there they share the same sanctity, and therefore the Torah prohibition applies to the Entrance Hall as well. <b>For if it could enter your mind</b> to say that <b>these</b> areas <b>have two</b> distinct levels <b>of sanctity,</b> it would emerge that the prohibition to be in the <b>Entrance Hall is itself</b> a rabbinic <b>decree. But will we arise and issue</b> one <b>decree to</b> prevent violation of another <b>decree</b> by prohibiting being present in the area between the Entrance Hall and the altar, lest one enter the Entrance Hall itself?

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects Rava’s reasoning: <b>No,</b> this would not be a case of issuing one decree to prevent violation of another decree, because <b>the Entrance Hall and the</b> area <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar</b> share <b>one sanctity.</b> Consequently, any prohibition applied to one will certainly also apply to the other. However, <b>the Sanctuary and the Entrance Hall have two</b> distinct <b>sanctities.</b>

### Part 9
§ The mishna states: <b>On every</b> other <b>day,</b> a priest <b>would scoop up</b> the coals with a coal pan made <b>of silver and pour</b> the coals from there <b>into</b> a coal pan <b>of gold.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> the gold pan was not used to scoop the coals? The Gemara answers: Because <b>the Torah spared the money of the Jewish people.</b> Since the pan is worn away with use, it is preferable to use a less expensive silver pan.

### Part 10
§ The mishna continues: <b>But</b> on <b>this day,</b> on Yom Kippur, the High Priest <b>scoops up with</b> a coal pan <b>of gold, and with</b> that coal pan, <b>he would bring</b> the coals <b>into</b> the Holy of Holies. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that on Yom Kippur only one pan is used? <b>Due to the weakness</b> of the <b>High Priest.</b> He has to perform the entire service by himself while fasting; using only one pan minimizes his exertion.

### Part 11
§ The mishna states: <b>On every</b> other <b>day,</b> a priest scoops up the coals with a coal pan <b>of four <i>kav</i></b> and pours the coals into a coal pan of three <i>kav</i>. Rabbi Yosei says: On every other day, a priest scoops with a coal pan of a <i>se’a</i>, which is six <i>kav</i>, and then pours the coals into a coal pan of three <i>kav</i>. <b>It was taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 33a): As he poured from a pan of four <i>kav</i> to a pan of three <i>kav</i>, <b>a <i>kav</i> of coals became scattered, and he swept them into the canal</b> that passed through the Temple and ran to the Kidron brook.

### Part 12
It <b>was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>A <i>kav</i></b> of coals was scattered. <b>And it was taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Two <i>kav</i></b> were scattered. The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which <b>teaches that</b> a single <b><i>kav</i></b> was scattered, is understandable. It is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> the first <i>tanna</i> of the mishna, who maintain that coals are poured from a coal pan of four <i>kav</i> to one of three. <b>But that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which <b>teaches</b> that <b>two <i>kav</i></b> of coals were scattered, in accordance <b>with whose</b> opinion is it? <b>It is not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> According to Rabbi Yosei, three <i>kav</i> of coals would have been scattered.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: With</b> a coal pan <b>of two <i>kav</i> he would bring</b> the coals <b>into</b> the Holy of Holies. If one accepts the opinion of the Rabbis that the coals were scooped with a coal pan of four <i>kav</i>, two <i>kav</i> were scattered.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Ashi said: You can even say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, and this is what he is saying: On every</b> other <b>day,</b> a priest <b>scooped with</b> a coal pan <b>of a desert <i>se’a</i>, which</b> is five Jerusalem <i>kav</i>, <b>and</b> then <b>he poured</b> the coals <b>into a coal pan of three Jerusalem <i>kav</i>.</b> Therefore, two <i>kav</i> would be scattered.

### Part 15
§ The mishna states: <b>On every</b> other <b>day,</b> the coal pan <b>was heavy, but</b> on <b>this day</b> it was <b>light. It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>On every</b> other <b>day its side was thick but</b> on <b>this day</b> it was <b>soft</b> and thin. <b>On every</b> other <b>day</b> its handle <b>was short but</b> on <b>this day it was long. What is the reason? So that the arm of the High Priest could assist him</b> in carrying the coal pan, i.e., he could support the coal pan by resting it against his arm rather than bear the entire weight in his hand.

### Part 16
It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>On every</b> other <b>day it did not have a ring,but</b> on <b>this day it has a ring</b> on the end of the handle, which clatters against it and makes a noise in fulfillment of the verse “And the sound thereof shall be heard when he goes in to the Sanctuary” (Exodus 28:35); this is <b>the statement of the son of the Deputy.</b>

### Part 17
§ The mishna states: <b>On every</b> other <b>day, it was</b> of <b>greenish gold</b> but on this day it was of a red gold. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: There are seven</b> types <b>of gold</b> mentioned in the Bible: <b>Gold, and good gold, and gold of Ophir</b> (I Kings 10:11), <b>and glistering gold</b> (I Kings 10:18), <b>and <i>shaḥut</i> gold</b> (I Kings 10:17), <b>and closed gold</b> (I Kings 10:21), <b>and <i>parvayim</i> gold</b> (II Chronicles 3:6). The Gemara explains the reason for these names: There is a distinction between <b>gold and good gold, as it is written</b> in the verse: <b>“And the gold of that land is good”</b> (Genesis 2:12), which indicates the existence of gold of a higher quality. <b>Gold of Ophir</b> is gold <b>that comes from Ophir. Glistering [<i>mufaz</i>] gold</b> is so named
