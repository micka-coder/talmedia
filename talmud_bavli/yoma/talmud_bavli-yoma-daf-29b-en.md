### Part 1
<b>Let us restore</b> the handful that was removed from the meal-offering at night, <b>and let us again take a handful during the day.</b> Why must the meal-offering be burned? The Gemara explains: <b>He taught</b> the <i>baraita</i> that he received through tradition, <b>and he said its</b> explanation. <b>Service vessels,</b> which are sacred, <b>consecrate</b> their contents <b>even</b> when those contents are <b>not</b> placed in the vessel <b>at</b> the appointed <b>time</b> for that service. Once the handful is placed in the sacred vessel, the sanctity of the handful immediately takes effect and the situation can no longer be remedied.

### Part 2
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>This is the principle: Any</b> offering <b>that is sacrificed during the day is consecrated</b> by being sacrificed <b>during the day; and any</b> offering <b>that is sacrificed at night is consecrated</b> only <b>at night; and any</b> offering <b>that is sacrificed both during the day and at night is consecrated both during the day and at night. In any case, it is teaching</b> that <b>any</b> offering <b>that is sacrificed during the day is consecrated during the day.</b> One learns by inference: <b>During the day, yes,</b> it is consecrated; <b>at night, no,</b> it is not consecrated. Apparently, the handful of the meal-offering is not consecrated before dawn, which poses a difficulty to the explanation of Rabbi Avinâ€™s father. The Gemara answers: <b>Perhaps</b> the inference from the <i>baraita</i> means that when it is not sacrificed at its appointed time <b>it is not</b> sufficiently <b>consecrated to be sacrificed</b> on the altar; <b>however, it is</b> sufficiently <b>consecrated to be disqualified.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Zeira raised an objection</b> to the principle of the father of Rabbi Avin based on what was taught in a mishna: If a priest <b>arranged</b> the <b>bread and the vessels</b> of frankincense that accompany the shewbread on the golden table <b>after Shabbat,</b> on Sunday instead of on Shabbat, then even though <b>he burned the</b> frankincense that was in the <b>vessels on Shabbat,</b> they are <b>disqualified.</b> That is because the bread was not arranged at its appointed time and therefore will not be arranged on the table for the requisite seven days.

### Part 4
<b>How shall he proceed</b> to prevent its disqualification? <b>He should</b> not remove it, but rather he should <b>leave</b> the shewbread on the table <b>to</b> be removed <b>the following Shabbat, as even if</b> the bread <b>remained on the table for many days, that</b> does <b>not matter.</b> Then, on the following Shabbat, he arranges and places the shewbread in the appropriate manner. <b>And</b> according to the opinion of the father of Rabbi Avin, <b>why</b> is this remedy effective? If service vessels consecrate their contents even when those contents are not placed there at the appointed time, once the bread was placed on the table after Shabbat <b>it is consecrated and disqualified.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rava said:</b> Rabbi Zeira, <b>who raises the objection, raises the objection well. And the father of Rabbi Avin is also stating a <i>baraita</i>.</b> Therefore, his opinion cannot be dismissed. At the same time, the contradiction between the <i>baraita</i> and the mishna must be resolved. <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>maintains:</b> A service performed at <b>night</b> is <b>not</b> considered <b>premature.</b> If there is a requirement to perform a certain action during the day but one performed it the night before, it is not considered as though he did not perform it at its appointed time, because the day and the night before it are considered a single unit. Therefore, placing the shewbread on the table before dawn disqualifies it. However, a service performed <b>a day</b> earlier is considered <b>premature.</b> Therefore, the table does not consecrate shewbread placed on it a day before Shabbat, and all the more so a week before Shabbat.

### Part 6
If a service performed at night is not considered premature, <b>when Shabbat evening</b> arrives, the arrangement of bread remaining on the table should <b>be consecrated and disqualified</b> when morning comes, because it was arranged at night. <b>Ravina said:</b> It is referring to a case where <b>one removed</b> the shewbread from the table <b>before</b> nightfall on Friday night to prevent consecration and disqualification. <b>Mar Zutra, and some say Rav Ashi, said: Even</b> if <b>you say that one did not remove</b> the shewbread <b>before</b> nightfall, <b>since he arranged</b> the shewbread <b>not in accordance with</b> the procedure dictated by <b>its mitzva</b> as it was not at its appointed time, its legal status <b>becomes as</b> if <b>a monkey arranged</b> the shewbread. At dawn, the priest will remove it from the table and replace it in accordance with the procedure dictated by its mitzva. However, with regard to a meal-offering whose handful was placed into a sacred vessel and shewbread that was placed on the table before dawn, they are not considered premature. They are therefore consecrated and disqualified.

### Part 7
The mishna continues: <b>This was the principle in the Temple:</b> Anyone who covers his legs, a euphemism for defecating, must immerse afterward; and anyone who urinates requires sanctification of the hands and feet with water from the basin afterward. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> one who urinates is required to sanctify his <b>feet, due to drops</b> of urine that drip on his feet. <b>However,</b> with regard to his <b>hands, what is the reason</b> that he is required to sanctify them? His hands did not come into contact with anything filthy. <b>Rabbi Abba said: That is to say</b> that one learns appropriate conduct from this, namely that
