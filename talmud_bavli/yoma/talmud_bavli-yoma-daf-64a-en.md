### Part 1
The Gemara presents another explanation as to why a verse is needed to indicate that the scapegoat may not be lacking time. <b>Rava said:</b> It is referring to a case <b>where</b> the one who sold the two goats <b>had</b> a critically <b>ill person in his household, and he slaughtered the mother</b> of the scapegoat in order to save the ill person’s life <b>on Yom Kippur.</b> Although the scapegoat is more than eight days old, it is considered lacking time because it is prohibited to slaughter a mother animal and its offspring on the same day.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Is it prohibited in a case like this? The Merciful One stated</b> in the Torah: “And whether it be a cow or ewe, <b>you shall not slaughter</b> it and its young on one day” (Leviticus 22:28), <b>and this</b> act of pushing the scapegoat off the cliff <b>is not</b> a ritual <b>slaughter.</b> Consequently, the prohibition against slaughtering a mother animal and its offspring should not apply. The Gemara answers: <b>They say in the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, that <b>pushing it</b> off <b>the cliff,</b> which is the manner in which the scapegoat is supposed to be killed, <b>is</b> considered <b>its slaughter.</b>

### Part 3
§ It was taught in the mishna that if one of the goats dies after the lottery, a second pair of goats is sought and new lots are drawn. After that lottery, the priest utters a stipulation: <b>If</b> the one to be sacrificed <b>to God died, that</b> goat <b>upon which</b> the lot for God was drawn shall stand in its stead; and if the one to be sent to Azazel died, that goat upon which the lot for Azazel was drawn shall stand in its stead. The second, superfluous goat should graze until it becomes blemished, at which point it will be sold and the money received in its sale will go to the purchase of a public gift-offering. The Gemara discusses which goat is set to pasture: The one that remains from the first lottery or the one that remains from the second lottery?

### Part 4
<b>Rav said:</b> If the goat to be sent to Azazel died, <b>he should sacrifice the second</b> goat <b>of the first pair</b> to God, <b>and the second</b> goat <b>of the second pair should graze</b> until it becomes unfit. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The second</b> goat <b>of the first pair</b> is the one that <b>should graze,</b> whereas <b>he should sacrifice the second</b> goat <b>of the second pair.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rav holds</b> that <b>animals are not rejected.</b> An animal that was consecrated as an offering but later became unfit for sacrifice is not considered disqualified forever. Therefore, although the remaining goat was not eligible to be sacrificed when its counterpart died, once another goat has been paired with it following a new lottery, it is no longer rejected and should be sacrificed. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan holds</b> that <b>animals are rejected.</b> Therefore, once the remaining goat from the first pair became disqualified, it remains disqualified forever.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rav?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> it <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> applicable to an animal that is <b>lacking time.</b> In the case of an animal that is <b>lacking time, is it not</b> true that <b>although it is unfit now, when it again becomes fit, it seems well,</b> i.e., it may be sacrificed as an offering? <b>Here, too,</b> it is <b>no different.</b> The Gemara rejects this answer: <b>Is it comparable? There,</b> when the animal is lacking time, <b>it was never fit</b> to be sacrificed. <b>Here,</b> the animal <b>was fit</b> as an offering <b>and</b> later became unfit and <b>was</b> therefore <b>rejected.</b> Perhaps in this case it is permanently disqualified.

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara retracts the first explanation and says that <b>this is the reasoning of Rav: He derives</b> it <b>from</b> the case of <b>an animal with a temporary blemish.</b> The animal is disqualified as an offering as long as the blemish remains, but is eligible for sacrifice once the blemish has healed. In the case of <b>an animal with a temporary blemish, is it not</b> true that <b>although it is unfit now, when it again becomes fit, it seems well,</b> i.e., it may be sacrificed as an offering? <b>Here too,</b> it is <b>no different.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>There,</b> in the case of an animal with a temporary blemish, <b>from where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? <b>As it is written: “Because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them;</b> they shall not be accepted for you” (Leviticus 22:25), which teaches us: It is when the <b>blemish is in them that they shall not be accepted; but if their blemish passes, they shall be accepted.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> respond to this proof? <b>The Merciful One limited</b> this <i>halakha</i> by using the term: <b>In them,</b> which indicates that <b>it is they,</b> animals with temporary blemishes, <b>that are accepted when their blemishes pass, but</b> with regard to <b>all</b> other animals that become disqualified, <b>once they are rejected they</b> remain <b>rejected.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rav</b> answer Rabbi Yoḥanan? <b>That</b> term: <b>In them,</b> should be understood as follows: <b>It is on their own that they are not accepted; but in mixtures</b> with animals thatare fit to be sacrificed, animals that have a temporary blemish <b>are accepted.</b>

### Part 11
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>If limbs</b> from <b>unblemished</b> burnt-offerings became mixed <b>with limbs</b> from <b>blemished</b> burnt-offerings, which are disqualified, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If <b>the head of one of them is sacrificed</b> on the altar before they knew of the blemish, <b>they should sacrifice all the heads,</b> as it is assumed that the head of the disqualified animal was the one already sacrificed on the altar. Similarly, if <b>the legs of one of them</b> were sacrificed, <b>they should sacrifice all the legs. And the Rabbis say: Even if all of them were sacrificed except for one,</b> that one <b>should be taken out to the place</b> designated for <b>burning</b> disqualified offerings, as it is not assumed that the limbs of the disqualified animal have already been brought.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Yoḥanan, derive the <i>halakha</i> that the limbs are acceptable if they are in a mixture? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the Torah’s choice of terminology: It could have written: “In them,” as <b><i>bam</i>,</b> but instead it used the term <b><i>bahem</i>,</b> with the extra letter <i>heh</i>, and therefore an extra <i>halakha</i> can be derived from this word. The Gemara comments: <b>And the other</b> Sage, Rav, <b>does not expound</b> the difference in terminology between the words <b><i>bam</i></b> and <b><i>bahem</i>,</b> as he does not consider the distinction significant enough to teach a <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>According to Rav, although living beings are not</b> permanently <b>rejected,</b> that only explains why the remaining goat of the first pair is acceptable for sacrifice, but why must it be the one to be sacrificed? <b>If he wants this</b> one from the first pair <b>he should sacrifice it, and if he wants that</b> one from the second pair, <b>he should sacrifice that.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rava said: Rav holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who said:</b> The <b>mitzva</b> should be fulfilled with the goat <b>from the first</b> pair. The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> indicates that this is his opinion? <b>If we say</b> it is the statement of <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> with <b>regard to</b> the <b>containers, as we learned</b> in a mishna: There were <b>three containers,</b> each <b>of which</b> held <b>three <i>se’a</i>, with which they collected</b> coins from <b>the chamber. And</b> the letters <b><i>alef</i>, <i>beit</i>,</b> and <b><i>gimmel</i> were written on them. And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said: Why were <i>alef</i>, <i>beit</i>,</b> and <b><i>gimmel</i> written on them?</b> In order <b>to know which of them was collected</b> from the chamber <b>first,</b> in order <b>to bring</b> an offering <b>from it first, as the mitzva is</b> performed <b>with the first</b> one.

### Part 15
That statement of Rabbi Yosei cannot serve as the source for Rav’s opinion. <b>Perhaps</b> it is <b>different there,</b> in the case of the containers, <b>because at the time when the first</b> container of coins <b>was fit</b> for use, <b>the</b> containers used <b>later</b> were <b>not</b> yet <b>fit</b> for use. Therefore, it cannot serve as a precedent with regard to a case in which both became fit for use at the same time. In the case of the Yom Kippur goats, none of the goats are actually fit for sacrifice until the point in the Temple service when they are supposed to be sacrificed. By that time, lots have already been drawn for the second pair of goats.

### Part 16
<b>Rather,</b> the source of Rav’s opinion is the statement of <b>Rabbi Yosei with regard to the Paschal lamb. As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who separated</b> an animal as <b>his Paschal lamb and it became lost, and he separated another in its stead, and afterward,</b> but before midday on the eve of Passover, <b>the first</b> one <b>is found, and they are both standing</b> before him, the owner may <b>bring whichever of them he wishes.</b> This is the <b>statement of the Rabbis. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The <b>mitzva</b> should be performed <b>with the first</b> one.
