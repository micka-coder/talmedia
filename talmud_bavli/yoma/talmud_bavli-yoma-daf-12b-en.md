### Part 1
That action is unnecessary and therefore superfluous; <b>his service initiates him.</b> The replacement High Priest need not undergo any preliminary initiation. His very performance of the Yom Kippur service, which is valid only if performed by the High Priest, initiates him as acting High Priest. As proof, the Gemara states: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>all the</b> sacred <b>vessels that Moses made, their anointment</b> with oil <b>consecrates them. From that</b> point <b>forward,</b> in the generations after Moses, new vessels did not require anointment to be consecrated; rather, <b>their</b> use in Temple <b>service initiates them</b> and renders them fit for use. <b>Here, too,</b> with regard to the High Priest, <b>his service initiates him.</b>

### Part 2
§ Apropos the belt of the High Priest, the Gemara cites the aforementioned dispute in its entirety. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said:</b> With regard to <b>the belt of the common priest,</b> there is a dispute between <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon. One said:</b> It was a mixture <b>of diverse kinds</b> of wool and linen, like the belt of the High Priest mentioned in the Torah. <b>And one said:</b> It was made of <b>fine linen,</b> like the rest of the garments of the common priest.

### Part 3
The Gemara suggests: <b>Conclude that it is Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>who said</b> that the belt of the common priest was a mixture <b>of diverse kinds, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The only</b> difference <b>between a High Priest and a common priest is</b> the <b>belt;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: Not even</b> the <b>belt</b> represents a difference between them. The Gemara explains: With regard to the difference between the High Priest and the common priest, <b>when</b> is there a dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i>? <b>If we say</b> that the dispute is with regard to <b>the rest of the days of the year, there are many</b> other differences between them, since <b>the High Priest serves</b> wearing <b>eight garments and the common</b> priest wears <b>four</b> garments. Therefore, that could not be the point of the dispute.

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> that the dispute is with regard to the differences between the High Priest and the common priest on <b>Yom Kippur?</b> They agree that the belt of the High Priest on Yom Kippur is made of linen, but disagree with regard to the common priest’s belt. According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, who says that there is a difference between the belts, the belt of the common priest must be made of a mixture of diverse kinds. According to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who says that there is no difference between their belts, the belt of the common priest must be made of linen, like that of the High Priest on Yom Kippur.

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects this proof. The Sages <b>say: No,</b> this is not a proof, as <b>actually,</b> the dispute is with regard to the differences <b>during the rest of the days of the year.</b> However, the dispute is not with regard to all the differences between the High Priest and the common priest, but rather only with regard to <b>those</b> four garments <b>common</b> to both priests: The tunic, trousers, turban, and belt. Based on this understanding that the dispute is with regard to the rest of the year, the analysis of the dispute is reversed: According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the belt of the High Priest is a mixture of diverse kinds and that of the common priest is made of linen, while according to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, the belt of the common priest is a mixture of diverse kinds. Therefore, there is no definitive proof from the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 6
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he stated</b> this tradition in a clearer fashion: With regard to <b>the belt of the High Priest on Yom Kippur, everyone agrees</b> that it is made <b>of fine linen,</b> as stated in the Torah. With regard to <b>the belt of the High Priest during the rest of the days of the year, everyone agrees</b> that it is a mixture <b>of diverse kinds. They disagreed only with regard to the belt of the common priest both during the rest of the days of the year and on Yom Kippur, as Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi says: It was a mixture <b>of diverse kinds, and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says</b> it was made <b>of linen.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: We, too, have learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah says with regard to the removal of the ashes from the altar: “And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen trousers shall he put <b>upon his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 6:3). The <i>baraita</i> questions the formulation of the verse. Since at the beginning of the verse it is written: “And the priest shall put on,” for <b>what</b> purpose <b>does the verse state: “Shall he put upon,”</b> in the latter part of the verse? <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It comes <b>to include</b> donning the <b>mitre</b> and the <b>belt for the removal of the ashes,</b> even though it is not explicitly stated in the verse. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Dosa says</b> that the term: Shall put on, comes <b>to include</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>the garments of the High Priest on Yom Kippur are fit for a common priest.</b> During the Yom Kippur service, the High Priest wears just four linen garments. Although he may not serve in those garments on Yom Kippur the following year, a common priest may serve in them during the rest of the year. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: There are two responses to</b> reject this <b>statement</b> of Rabbi Dosa. <b>One: The belt of the High Priest on Yom Kippur is not</b> the same as <b>the belt of the common priest</b> during the rest of the year. Clearly, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the belt of the High Priest on Yom Kippur is made of linen, and that of the common priest during the year is a mixture of the diverse kinds of wool and linen.

### Part 9
<b>And furthermore,</b> there is another reason to reject the statement of Rabbi Dosa. Could it be that with regard to <b>garments that were used</b> by the High Priest to perform a service of <b>extreme sanctity,</b> the common priest <b>will use them</b> to perform a service of <b>minor sanctity? Rather,</b> according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, for <b>what</b> purpose <b>does the verse state</b> the phrase: <b>Shall put on?</b> It comes <b>to include threadbare</b> garments and to teach that as long as they are not completely tattered, they may be worn for that service.

### Part 10
<b>And Rabbi Dosa follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: That which is written: “And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the Sanctuary, <b>and shall leave them there”</b> (Leviticus 16:23), <b>teaches</b> that the garments worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur <b>require interment</b> and may not be put to additional use. <b>Rabbi Dosa says:</b> It means only that the High Priest <b>may not use them</b> on <b>Yom Kippur</b> in <b>a different</b> year. According to Rabbi Dosa, they may be worn by a common priest during his service, as they do not require interment.

### Part 11
§ The Gemara returns to the initiation of the acting High Priest. <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: If <b>a disqualification befalls</b> the High Priest <b>and they appointed another in his stead,</b> and then the cause of the disqualification of the High Priest is resolved, e.g., he was purified from impurity, the <b>original</b> High Priest <b>returns to his service.</b> With regard to the <b>second,</b> acting High Priest, <b>all the mitzvot of the High Priesthood are</b> incumbent <b>upon him.</b> He serves wearing eight garments and it is prohibited for him to let his hair grow, to rend his garments in mourning the death of a relative, to subject himself to impurity imparted by the corpse of a relative, or to marry a widow. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The <b>original</b> priest <b>returns to his service,</b> while the <b>second is fit</b> to serve <b>neither as High Priest</b> with eight garments, because there is a different High Priest; <b>nor as a common priest</b> with four garments, as once he was elevated to a state of extreme sanctity he may not be reduced to a state of minor sanctity.

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Yosei said</b> as proof for his opinion: There was <b>an incident involving</b> the priest <b>Yosef ben Elem of Tzippori,</b> who, when a reason for <b>disqualification befell a High Priest,</b> the priests <b>appointed him in his stead.</b> After the cause of the disqualification was resolved, <b>the Sages said:</b> The <b>original</b> High Priest <b>returns to his service,</b> while the <b>second is fit</b> to serve <b>neither as High Priest nor as a common priest.</b> The Gemara explains: Neither as a <b>High Priest, due to hatred,</b> jealousy and bitterness that would arise if there were two High Priests with equal standing in the Temple; nor as a <b>common priest, because</b> the principle is: <b>One elevates</b> to a higher level <b>in</b> matters of <b>sanctity and one does not downgrade.</b> Once he has served as a High Priest he cannot be restored to the position of a common priest.

### Part 14
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b>
