### Part 1
The strip of crimson <b>of the</b> red <b>heifer</b> has the <b>weight</b> of <b>ten <i>zuz</i>; and</b> the strip <b>of the scapegoat</b> has the <b>weight of two <i>sela</i>,</b> which is eight <i>zuz</i>; <b>and</b> the strip <b>of the leper</b> has the <b>weight of a shekel,</b> which is two <i>zuz</i>.

### Part 2
And <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> further said: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta and the Rabbis disagree</b> with regard to the strip of crimson <b>of</b> the red <b>heifer. One said:</b> It has the <b>weight of ten</b> <i>zuz</i>. <b>And one said:</b> It has the <b>weight of one shekel. And your mnemonic</b> for remembering that while both assume that only one of the extreme values was required no one suggests the middle value of two <i>sela</i> is required, is the aphorism from a mishna: God equally values <b>both the one who gives much and the one who gives little</b> as long as his intention is to Heaven.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti said to Ravina:</b> It is <b>not with regard to the</b> strip of the red <b>heifer</b> that <b>they disagree; rather,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the strip of <b>the scapegoat</b> that <b>they disagree. And on that</b> very <b>day</b> that they disputed this issue, <b>Ravya bar Kisi</b> died, <b>and they made a mnemonic out of it,</b> associating the <i>halakha</i> with his name: The death of <b>Ravya bar Kisi atones like the scapegoat,</b> since the death of the righteous person atones for his generation.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: I heard</b> a teaching that there is a distinction between <b>two slaughters: One of the</b> red <b>heifer, and one of the bull</b> of the High Priest on Yom Kippur. The slaughter of <b>one</b> of them <b>is valid</b> even if done <b>by a non-priest, and</b> the slaughter of the other <b>one is invalid</b> if done <b>by a non-priest. But I do not know which of them</b> is which.

### Part 5
An amoraic dispute <b>was stated:</b> With regard to the <b>slaughter of the</b> red <b>heifer and the bull</b> of the High Priest on Yom Kippur, there is a dispute between <b>Rav and Shmuel: One said:</b> A red <b>heifer</b> slaughtered by a non-priest <b>is invalid,</b> whereas the <b>bull</b> of the High Priest slaughtered by a non-priest <b>is valid. And</b> the other <b>one said: His bull is invalid,</b> but the red <b>heifer is valid.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude</b> that <b>it is Rav who said</b> that if <b>the heifer</b> is slaughtered by a non-priest it <b>is invalid, as Rabbi Zeira said: The slaughter of the heifer by a non-priest is invalid. And Rav said concerning this</b> statement of Rabbi Zeira: This is because <b>we learned in</b> the Torah’s description of the slaughter of the red heifer both <b>“Elazar</b> the priest” (Numbers 19:3) and <b>“statute”</b> (Numbers 19:2). Because Elazar is mentioned, it indicates the slaughter should be performed by a priest, and the use of the term “statute” teaches that one may not deviate from any of the details of the service as delineated in the verses; if one does deviate, the service is invalid. Clearly then, Rav held that if the heifer is slaughtered by a non-priest it is invalid.

### Part 7
The Gemara analyzes Rav’s opinion: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rav, what is different</b> with regard to the red <b>heifer,</b> that if it is slaughtered by a non-priest it is invalid? As Rav explained, it is different in <b>that,</b> with regard to it, <b>it is written “Elazar” and “statute.”</b> But with regard to <b>the bull</b> of the High Priest <b>it is also written “Aaron”</b> the High Priest (Leviticus 16:11) and <b>“statute”</b> (Leviticus 16:34). Based on Rav’s logic, that indicates that the priest is indispensable.

### Part 8
The Gemara explains: The slaughter of the bull by a non-priest is valid because <b>slaughtering is not</b> classified as a sacrificial <b>service;</b> therefore, it does not have to be done by a priest. The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>If so,</b> by the same logic, the red <b>heifer</b> should <b>also</b> be valid when slaughtered by a non-priest. The Gemara concludes: The logic that slaughtering is not classified as a sacrificial service does not apply in the case of the red heifer because the red <b>heifer is different.</b> It has the sanctity <b>of</b> items <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance,</b> and therefore the principles that apply to other offerings do not necessarily apply to it.

### Part 9
But <b>is it not</b> arguable, by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference,</b> that the slaughter of the red heifer by a non-priest is valid? If the slaughter of the bull of the High Priest, which is an actual offering, is valid when performed by a non-priest, then all the more so the slaughter of the red heifer, which is not an offering, should be valid when similarly performed by a non-priest. <b>Rav Shisha, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> The slaughter by of the red heifer a non-priest is invalid. The <i>halakha</i> is <b>just as in</b> the case of <b>appearances of leprosy, which,</b> despite their <b>not</b> being a sacrificial <b>service,</b> still <b>require the priesthood.</b> Only a priest may declare the signs of leprosy to be pure or impure. It is apparent from this case that the logic of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference does not hold.

### Part 10
The Gemara analyzes Shmuel’s opinion: <b>And</b> according <b>to Shmuel, who said</b> that if a non-priest slaughters <b>the bull</b> of the High Priest it <b>is invalid, what is different</b> with regard to <b>his bull</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i>? It is different in <b>that,</b> with regard to it, <b>it is written “Aaron,”</b> indicating that a priest is required, <b>and “statute,”</b> indicating that the requirements of the Yom Kippur service are indispensable. But with regard to the red <b>heifer it is also written: “Elazar” and “statute”</b> which by the same logic should indicate the need for a priest is indispensable. The Gemara concludes: <b>It is different there as it is written: “And he shall slaughter it before him”</b> (Numbers 19:3), i.e., in front of Elazar, which suggests <b>that it could be</b> that <b>a non-priest slaughters and Elazar watches.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And Rav,</b> who assumes the slaughter is performed by the priest himself, how does he interpret the phrase: “Before him”? He understands it to mean <b>that he should not divert his attention from</b> the heifer from the moment of slaughtering until the completion of the process. As with other matters of purification, one is required to maintain his attention on the matter; any distraction can invalidate the process. <b>And from where does Shmuel,</b> who already derived something from this verse, derive <b>that he should not divert his attention</b> from it? <b>He derives it</b> from the verse: <b>“And he shall burn the heifer in his sight”</b> (Numbers 19:5).

### Part 12
<b>And</b> what does <b>Rav</b> learn from this verse? He holds that <b>one</b> verse is needed to teach the requirement to maintain one’s attention <b>with regard to slaughtering, and one</b> verse is needed to teach the requirement <b>with regard to burning.</b>

### Part 13
<b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to have the requirement stated in both cases <b>since, if the Merciful One had written it</b> only <b>with regard to slaughtering,</b> I might have limited the requirement to that case <b>because it is the start of the</b> Temple <b>service; but</b> with regard to <b>burning, I could say</b> that <b>no,</b> there is no requirement. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach the requirement also in the case of burning. <b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> the requirement only <b>with regard to burning,</b> I might have limited it to that case, <b>because it is now that</b> the <b>heifer is</b> actually <b>being made ready</b> to be used; <b>but</b> with regard to <b>slaughtering, I could say</b> that <b>no,</b> there is no requirement. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach the requirement also in that case.

### Part 14
As the requirement is mentioned with regard to two stages of the rite of the red heifer, this suggests that it does not exist for every stage. Therefore, the Gemara asks: It is written this way in order <b>to exclude what</b> stage? <b>If we say, to exclude</b> from the requirement the stages of <b>gathering its ashes and filling the water for sanctification,</b> i.e., taking the water in order to pour it on the ashes and mix them together,
