### Part 1
<b>does not accept</b> that one may rely on <b>writing</b> in a situation where an error is possible. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: There was only one pedestal</b> in the Temple on which to place the blood. <b>What is the reason</b> that they did <b>not</b> place <b>two</b> pedestals there? The reason is <b>because</b> the pedestals might be <b>exchanged</b> for one another, and he might take the goat’s blood instead of that of the bull. <b>But</b> in that case, <b>let us place two</b> pedestals <b>and write on them which</b> one <b>is for the bull and which is for the goat. Rather,</b> it is clear that <b>Rabbi Yehuda does not accept</b> that one may rely on <b>writing</b> in a situation where error is possible.

### Part 2
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against this conclusion: <b>There were thirteen</b> collection <b>horns in the Temple, and they were</b> each <b>inscribed</b> with different names. On one container was written: <b>New shekels.</b> In this horn they placed shekels that were donated at the correct time that year. <b>And</b> on another horn the phrase <b>old shekels</b> was written, referring to coins from the past year that did not reach the Temple during the allotted period. On the other horns, the following phrases were written: <b>Nests,</b> for obligatory offerings consisting of pairs of pigeons or turtledoves; <b>young birds for burnt-offerings; wood,</b> for anyone who wished to donate wood; <b>frankincense; and gold for the Ark cover. And</b> there were <b>six</b> additional boxes designated <b>for</b> communal <b>free-will offerings</b> of all kinds.

### Part 3
The Gemara explains: <b>New shekels, these are</b> the <b>shekels of each and every year</b> that arrive on time; <b>old shekels,</b> these are for <b>one who did not donate a shekel the previous year,</b> who must <b>donate the next year; nests, these are the turtledoves</b> brought as offerings; <b>young birds for burnt-offerings, these are pigeons; and all these</b> birds <b>are burnt-offerings;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Rabbi Yehuda maintains that there was no container for nests of obligatory sin-offerings and burnt-offerings, due to the potential mixture between the two. In any case, this shows that Rabbi Yehuda does rely on inscriptions written on containers, which contradicts the above claim that he does not rely on writing in these situations.

### Part 4
<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said: They say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, that this is a rabbinic <b>decree due to</b> the possible presence in the mixture of <b>a sin-offering whose owners have died.</b> Since a sin-offering of this kind must be left to die, if one of the donors of the coins in the sin-offering horn passes away, his funds cannot be used. The Gemara asks: <b>And are we concerned</b> about the possible death of a donor? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>one who sends his sin-offering from overseas, they sacrifice it</b> for him <b>on the presumption that he is alive,</b> although he might have died in the meantime. This shows that the possibility of death is not taken into account.

### Part 5
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yehuda’s concern is <b>due to a sin-offering whose owner has certainly died,</b> lest it be confirmed that one of the people who donated money for a sin-offering bird has indeed died. The Gemara asks: Even so, this can be rectified, as <b>let us select four <i>zuz</i>,</b> the price of such an offering, <b>and throw them into the water</b> to be destroyed. It may be said that the money removed from the box was the money for the sin-offering whose owner died, <b>and these</b> other coins <b>will be permitted.</b> It will be clarified retroactively that these coins were designated for that purpose. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yehuda does not accept</b> the rule of retroactive <b>clarification.</b> In his opinion, one cannot issue a designation after the fact. Consequently, he rejects this solution.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that this is indeed Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion? <b>If we say</b> it is derived <b>from that which we learned</b> in the following mishna, there is a difficulty. The mishna states: With regard to <b>one who buys wine from among the Samaritans,</b> who do not tithe their produce properly, <b>on Shabbat eve at nightfall</b> and has no time to separate the tithe before Shabbat and to place the separated portions in distinct locations, he may <b>arise and say: Two <i>log</i></b> of the one hundred <i>log</i> present here, <b>which I will separate in the future,</b> after Shabbat, <b>shall be</b> the <b><i>teruma</i></b> <i>gedola</i> given to a priest, as the Sages mandated that one-fiftieth of one’s produce constitutes an average measure of <i>teruma</i>;
