### Part 1
All this is <b>provided that he does not skip from the end of the book to its beginning,</b> since then it would be clear to everyone that he is skipping text.

### Part 2
§ It was taught in the mishna: The High Priest <b>furls the Torah scroll</b> and places it on his bosom and says: More than what I have read before you is written here. The Gemara comments: <b>And why</b> must he say <b>all this?</b> It is <b>so as not to cast aspersions on the Torah scroll,</b> because people might think that the portion he read by heart is not written there.

### Part 3
§ It was further taught in the mishna: The Torah portion beginning with the verse: <b>“And on the tenth,” from the book of Numbers</b> (29:7), <b>he reads by heart.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does he read it by heart? <b>Let him furl</b> the scroll to that portion <b>and read it</b> from the text. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> It is <b>because one may not furl a Torah scroll in public, out of respect for the community.</b> It is inappropriate to make the community wait until they have reached the next section.

### Part 4
But why not <b>let another</b> Torah scroll <b>be brought</b> that has previously been furled to that portion <b>and read</b> from it? <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda said:</b> People might mistakenly think the second scroll was brought <b>due to a flaw</b> that was found <b>in the first</b> one. <b>And Reish Lakish said</b> a different reason: A second scroll should not be brought <b>due to</b> the fact that doing do will cause an <b>unnecessary blessing</b> to be recited; before reading from a new scroll the High Priest would have to repeat the blessings required upon reading from the Torah. Therefore, it is preferable that he read by heart.

### Part 5
The Gemara questions Rav Huna bar Yehuda’s answer: <b>Are we</b> really <b>concerned</b> that people will think the first scroll had <b>a flaw? Didn’t Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa say:</b> When <b>the New Moon ofTevet,</b> which always occurs during Hanukkah, <b>occurs on Shabbat, one brings</b> and reads from <b>three Torah</b> scrolls. <b>One reads</b> from <b>one</b> scroll <b>the topic of the day,</b> i.e., the weekly portion; <b>and</b> from <b>one</b> scroll the portion <b>of the New Moon; and</b> from <b>one</b> scroll a passage related to Hanukkah. It is apparent from the statement of Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa that many Torah scrolls may be used, and there is no concern that people will mistakenly think one or more had a flaw.

### Part 6
The Gemara explains: When <b>three men</b> read <b>from three scrolls there is no</b> concern that people will think there was <b>a flaw,</b> since people assume that it is befitting for each individual to receive his own scroll. But when <b>one man</b> reads <b>from two scrolls, there is</b> a concern that people will think there is <b>a flaw,</b> and they will not realize that this was done only to avoid forcing the community to wait while the scroll was furled.

### Part 7
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And</b> the High Priest <b>recites eight blessings</b> after the reading. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that these are the eight blessings: <br>The blessing <b>concerning the Torah</b> is recited <b>in the</b> usual <b>way one recites a blessing in the synagogue:</b> Who gives the Torah; <br>The three blessings: <b>concerning the</b> Temple <b>service, concerning thanksgiving, and concerning pardon of iniquity,</b> are all recited <b>according to their established forms</b> in the prayers; <br>The blessing <b>concerning the Temple in and of itself;</b> <br>The blessing <b>concerning the priests in and of themselves;</b> <br>The blessing <b>concerning the Jewish people in and of itself;</b> <br>The blessing <b>concerning the rest of the prayer.</b>

### Part 8
<b>The Sages taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> the blessing <b>concerning the rest of the prayer</b> reads: <b>Song, supplication, petition before You for Your people Israel, who need to be saved. And he</b> adds an additional supplication and <b>concludes</b> the blessing <b>with: The One Who hears prayer. And after</b> the High Priest concludes his reading, <b>each and every</b> person present <b>brings a Torah scroll from his house,</b> although in fact each person had already brought one on Yom Kippur eve, <b>and reads from it</b> for himself <b>in order to show its</b> beautiful <b>appearance to the community.</b> This is considered beautification of the mitzva.

### Part 9
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>One who sees the High Priest</b> reading the Torah does not see the bull and goat that are burned, and vice versa. This is <b>not because one is not permitted</b> to see both but because there is a distance between them and they are performed simultaneously. The Gemara comments: It is <b>obvious</b> that this is not due to a prohibition; what possible reason could there be to prohibit this? The Gemara answers: This was taught explicitly <b>lest you say that</b> it is prohibited <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish said: One does not pass over</b> the opportunity to perform <b>mitzvot,</b> even if it is in order to perform a different mitzva.

### Part 10
The Gemara clarifies why this principle might have applied here. <b>And what mitzva</b> is there in hearing the reading of the High Priest? It is a fulfillment of the principle expressed in the verse: <b>“The king’s glory is in the multitude of people”</b> (Proverbs 14:28). Having a large assembly involved in a mitzva gives honor to God. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the problem with seeing both events was only a practical one.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>If</b> the High Priest <b>read</b> the Torah <b>in</b> sacred white <b>fine linen garments, he</b> then <b>sanctified his hands and feet</b> as he did each time before removing the priestly vestments. He then <b>removed</b> the linen garments, <b>descended</b> to the ritual bath, <b>and immersed.</b> Afterward he <b>ascended and dried himself</b> with a towel, <b>and they brought him</b> the <b>golden garments</b> of the High Priesthood, <b>and he dressed</b> in them <b>and sanctified his hands and feet.</b>

### Part 12
The mishna addresses those offerings whose sacrifice has still not been mentioned. The verses in Leviticus, chapter 16, detail the special offerings of the atonement service of Yom Kippur. Of those offerings, the ram of the High Priest and the ram of the people have still not been addressed. In addition to this, the additional offerings of Yom Kippur detailed in Numbers, chapter 29, have not yet been discussed. These include seven one-year-old lambs and a bull to be brought as a burnt-offering and a goat to be brought as a sin-offering. The mishna continues: <b>He emerged and offered his ram and the ram of the people and the seven unblemished year-old lambs</b> mandated to be offered that day. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Those offerings were not sacrificed at this point; <b>rather,</b> they were sacrificed <b>with the daily morning offering; and the bull</b> of the Yom Kippur <b>burnt-offering; and the goat whose</b> services <b>are performed outside</b> of the Sanctuary, i.e., in the Temple courtyard, <b>were sacrificed with the daily afternoon offering.</b>

### Part 13
After sacrificing these offerings, <b>he sanctified his hands and feet and removed</b> the golden garments, <b>and he descended</b> into the ritual bath <b>and immersed and ascended and dried himself.</b>

### Part 14
<b>They brought him the white garments</b> again, <b>and he dressed</b> in them <b>and sanctified his hands and feet.</b> Afterward <b>he entered</b> the Holy of Holies <b>to take out the</b> incense <b>spoon and the coal pan,</b> which he had brought there earlier. <b>He</b> again <b>sanctified his hands and feet and removed</b> the white garments <b>and descended</b> to the ritual bath <b>and immersed and ascended and dried himself</b> with a towel.

### Part 15
<b>They brought him</b> the <b>golden garments, and he dressed</b> in them <b>and sanctified his hands and feet and entered</b> the Sanctuary <b>to burn the afternoon incense and to remove</b> the ashes from <b>the lamps,</b> which signified the end of the day’s service. <b>And he sanctified his hands and feet and removed</b> the golden garments, <b>and he descended</b> to the ritual bath <b>and immersed and ascended and dried himself.</b>

### Part 16
<b>They</b> then <b>brought him his own clothing and he dressed,</b> since the service was complete and Yom Kippur was over; and the people <b>escort him to his house</b> in deference to him. <b>And</b> the High Priest <b>would make a feast for his loved ones</b> and his friends <b>when he emerged in peace from the Sanctuary.</b>

### Part 17
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It was taught in the mishna: Rabbi Akiva said the seven lambs were sacrificed with the daily morning offering; and the bull of the Yom Kippur burnt-offering; and the goat whose services are performed outside of the Sanctuary, i.e., in the Temple courtyard, with the daily afternoon offering. It is unclear whether the middle clause concerning the bull should be read as a continuation of the first clause, or as relating to the latter clause. The Gemara seeks to clarify this ambiguity. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>saying?</b> Does he mean to say the seven lambs <b>were sacrificed with the daily morning offering,</b> whereas <b>the bull</b> of the Yom Kippur <b>burnt-offering and the goat whose</b> services <b>are performed outside were sacrificed with the daily afternoon offering?</b>

### Part 18
<b>Or perhaps this is what he is saying:</b> The seven lambs <b>were sacrificed with the daily morning offering</b> and <b>the bull</b> of the Yom Kippur <b>burnt-offering together with them,</b> whereas <b>the goat whose</b> services <b>are performed outside,</b> i.e., in the Temple courtyard, was sacrificed <b>with the daily afternoon offering.</b>

### Part 19
<b>And furthermore,</b> another dilemma: With regard to <b>the bull</b> of the Yom Kippur <b>burnt-offering,</b> according <b>to Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion: Since <b>he omitted</b> mention of <b>it,</b> it must be clarified <b>when</b> the High Priest <b>performs</b> its sacrifice. Is it sacrificed at this point in the day, or at another time?

### Part 20
<b>And furthermore,</b> another dilemma: According to <b>both Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion <b>and</b> according to <b>Rabbi Akiva’s</b> opinion, since neither of them mentioned the <b>portions of the sin-offering</b> to be consumed on the altar, it must be clarified <b>when</b> the High Priest <b>performs their</b> service and places them on the altar.

### Part 21
<b>Rava said: You will only find it properly</b> explained either according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer as taught by the school</b> of <b>Shmuel, or</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva as</b> taught <b>in the <i>Tosefta</i>.</b>

### Part 22
<b>The school of Shmuel taught</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: He came out and offered his ram and the ram of the people and the portions of the sin-offering</b> to be consumed on the altar. <b>But the bull</b> of the Yom Kippur <b>burnt-offering and the seven lambs and the goat whose</b> services <b>are performed outside</b> were sacrificed <b>with the daily afternoon offering.</b>

### Part 23
<b>What is Rabbi Akiva’s</b> opinion as taught in the <b><i>Tosefta</i>? As it was taught</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: The bull</b> of the Yom Kippur <b>burnt-offering and the seven lambs were sacrificed with the daily morning offering, as it is stated</b> with regard to the additional offerings of other Festivals: <b>“Besides the morning burnt-offering which is the daily burnt-offering</b> you shall sacrifice these” (Numbers 28:23), indicating that the additional offerings of the day should be sacrificed together with the daily offering. <b>And afterward the service of the day,</b> which is unique to Yom Kippur, is performed.
