### Part 1
The verse states: “But the goat on which the lot came up for Azazel <b>shall be stood alive before the Lord, to make atonement over him,</b> to send him away for Azazel into the wilderness” (Leviticus 16:10). The verse indicates that the goat must remain alive until a certain time. Were it to die beforehand, it would have to be replaced. <b>Until when</b> is the goat for Azazel <b>required to stand alive? Until the time of the application of the blood of its counterpart,</b> i.e., the goat for God; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> It must remain alive <b>until the time of the verbal confession</b> over it.

### Part 2
<b>With regard to what do they disagree? As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states that the goat should remain alive <b>“to make atonement”</b> (Leviticus 16:10). This indicates that it must remain alive until it effects atonement. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon dispute which atonement the verse is referring to. <b>The verse speaks of atonement through</b> the application of the <b>blood</b> of the sin-offering goat. <b>And similarly it states: “When he has made an end of atoning for the Sanctuary,</b> and the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat” (Leviticus 16:20). <b>Just as there</b> the reference is <b>to atonement through blood, so too here</b> the verse is referring to <b>atonement through blood. This is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: “To make atonement over it”; the verse speaks of atonement through speech,</b> i.e., the verbal confession that is recited over it.

### Part 4
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that the drawing of lots is not indispensable. A <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>Rabbi Akiva’s students asked him:</b> If the lot for God <b>was drawn by</b> the High Priest’s <b>left</b> hand, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>he may transfer</b> the lot <b>to</b> his <b>right</b> hand? <b>He said to them: Do not give the heretics an opportunity to dominate.</b> If it is allowed, they will adduce this as proof of their claim that the <i>halakhot</i> are not absolute, and the Sages have the power to change them as they see fit.

### Part 5
The Gemara infers: <b>The</b> only <b>reason</b> Rabbi Akiva provided to disallow it was <b>so as not to give heretics an opportunity to dominate,</b> which implies that if <b>not for this</b> reason, it would be permitted to <b>transfer</b> the lot to the right hand. How could this be true? <b>Didn’t you say</b> that <b>the drawing</b> of the lots <b>is indispensable? And,</b> consequently, <b>once</b> the designation of the goat has been defined by the drawing of the <b>left</b> hand, <b>how</b> then <b>could we transfer</b> the lot to the right hand? Perforce, the designation is not created by the actual drawing, and as such it is not indispensable.

### Part 6
The Gemara explains the <i>baraita</i> can be understood in a way in which it does not provide a proof: <b>Rava said: This is</b> what Rabbi Akiva’s students <b>are saying:</b> If <b>the lot was drawn by</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>he may transfer it,</b> the lot, <b>and its</b> associated <b>goat to</b> his <b>right</b> side. <b>He said to them: Do not give the heretics an opportunity to dominate.</b> Accordingly, there was never any suggestion of changing the designation of the goats. Therefore, no proof can be brought concerning the indispensability of the drawing of the lots.

### Part 7
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that the drawing of lots is indispensable. A <i>baraita</i> teaches (<i>Sifra</i>, <i>Aharei Mot</i> 2:4): <b>If</b> the verse <b>had stated</b> only: <b>“The goat upon which</b> the lot” (Leviticus 16:9), <b>I would have said</b> the intention is that <b>he</b> must physically <b>place</b> the lot <b>upon it.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse</b> also <b>states:</b> “On which <b>it came up”</b> (Leviticus 16:9), indicating that <b>once</b> the lot <b>has come up</b> from the receptacle, <b>it is not necessary</b> to do <b>more,</b> i.e., the lot does not have to be physically placed upon the goat.

### Part 8
The Gemara clarifies: <b>To what</b> does the <i>baraita</i> refer when it says it is not necessary to actually place the lot upon the goat? <b>If we say</b> it means that it is no longer necessary to do so even <b>as a mitzva,</b> then, <b>by inference,</b> one must conclude that <b>the placement</b> of the lot upon the goat is <b>not even a mitzva.</b> This is problematic. Since it is clearly part of the Yom Kippur service, it must at least be a mitzva. <b>Rather, is it not</b> that when the <i>baraita</i> teaches that the placing of the lot is not necessary, it means only that the placing of the lot is not <b>indispensable? And conclude from it</b> that the <b>drawing</b> of lots <b>is indispensable,</b> but <b>the placement</b> of the lot upon the goat <b>is not indispensable.</b>

### Part 9
Rava rejects the proof: <b>Rava said:</b> This cannot serve as a proof, since <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: If</b> the verse <b>had stated</b> only: <b>“The goat upon which</b> the lot,” <b>I would have said</b> that the intention is that <b>he should</b> physically <b>place</b> the lot <b>upon</b> the goat, and the lot should remain upon it <b>until the time of its slaughter.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse</b> also <b>states:</b> “On which <b>it came up,”</b> indicating that <b>once</b> the lot <b>has come up</b> from the receptacle and been placed upon the goat for even one moment, <b>it is not necessary</b> to do <b>more,</b> i.e., the lot does not have to remain on the goat anymore. Understood in this way, it cannot be determined from this <i>baraita</i> whether or not the placement is indispensable.

### Part 10
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that Rabbi Yehuda holds that the drawing of the lots is indispensable. A <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Sifra</i> teaches: The verse states: “Aaron shall bring forward the goat upon which the lot came up for the Lord, <b>and he shall offer it for a sin-offering”</b> (Leviticus 16:9). The verse indicates that <b>the lottery makes it a sin-offering,</b> but verbally designating the goat with <b>the status</b> of a sin-offering <b>does not make it a sin-offering.</b>

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> continues: A verse is needed to teach this <i>halakha</i>, as I <b>might</b> have thought to come to the opposite conclusion. <b>Is there not an <i>a fortiori</i> inference</b> as follows: <b>Just as in a case in which</b> the use of <b>a lottery does not consecrate</b> the animals with a specific designation, e.g., a woman who has given birth and must bring two birds, one as a sin-offering and one as a burnt-offering, nevertheless a verbal designation of the animals with <b>the required status does consecrate them,</b> so too, in <b>a case in which</b> the use of <b>a lottery does consecrate</b> the animals, <b>is it not</b> logically <b>right that</b> verbally designating the animals with <b>the required status should consecrate them?</b>

### Part 12
In contradiction of this reasoning, <b>the verse states,</b> with regard to the goat: “He shall offer it for a sin-offering” to indicate that the lottery makes it a sin-offering; verbally designating the goat with the status of a sin-offering does not make it a sin-offering.
