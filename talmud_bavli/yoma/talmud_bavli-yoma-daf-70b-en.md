### Part 1
<b>And afterward, the goat whose</b> services <b>are performed outside</b> is sacrificed, <b>as it is stated: “One goat for a sin-offering besides the sin-offering of atonement</b> and the daily burnt-offering, and its meal-offering, and their libations” (Numbers 29:11), indicating that the goat sin-offering is sacrificed after the other offerings of the day. <b>And afterward</b> he offers <b>his ram and the ram of the people, and afterward</b> he places upon the altar the <b>portions of the sin-offering</b> to be consumed on the altar, <b>and afterward he sacrifices the daily afternoon offering.</b>

### Part 2
<b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> The High Priest <b>acts in accordance with</b> the order in <b>which it is written</b> in the Torah: <b>First he performs</b> the services described in <b>Leviticus, and afterward he performs</b> the additional offerings mentioned in <b>the book of Numbers.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And</b> what is <b>Rabbi Akiva’s</b> reasoning? His <b>reasoning</b> is <b>that as</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches</b> that the verse states: <b>“Besides the morning burnt-offering which is the daily burnt-offering</b> you shall sacrifice these” (Numbers 28:23), <b>it is apparent</b> that the sacrifice of the <b>additional offerings</b> should be <b>performed</b> together <b>with the daily morning offering.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Eliezer, what does he do with this</b> verse: <b>“Besides the sin-offering of atonement,”</b> which was the basis for Rabbi Akiva’s opinion? <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary for him</b> to derive from it that <b>for what this one,</b> the goat sin-offering whose blood is sprinkled inside the Holy of Holies, <b>atones, that one,</b> the goat sin-offering of the additional offerings whose services are performed in the Temple courtyard, also <b>atones.</b>

### Part 5
§ The <i>Tosefta</i> cited above, which recorded the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, also records additional versions of his view: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in</b> the <b>name of</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>One</b> of the seven lambs <b>is sacrificed with the daily morning offering, and</b> the other <b>six</b> are sacrificed <b>with the daily afternoon offering. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says in</b> the <b>name of</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>Six are sacrificed with the daily morning offering and one with the daily afternoon offering.</b>

### Part 6
<b>What is the rationale of the Rabbis,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who divide the sacrifice of the seven lambs into two parts? <b>Two verses are written</b> that suggest different times at which the additional offerings are sacrificed: <b>It is written</b> with regard to the additional offerings: <b>“Besides the morning burnt-offering</b> which is the daily burnt-offering you shall sacrifice these” (Numbers 28:23), implying that the additional offerings are sacrificed in the morning. <b>But it is</b> also <b>written</b> that upon concluding the service of the day: <b>“And he shall exit and make his burnt-offering</b> and the burnt-offering of the people” (Leviticus 16:24). As the phrase: “The burnt-offering of the people,” is referring to the additional offerings, this verse implies that the additional offerings are sacrificed in the afternoon. <b>Therefore,</b> in order to fulfill both verses, <b>he performs</b> the sacrifice of <b>some of them here,</b> in the morning, <b>and some of them there,</b> in the afternoon.

### Part 7
<b>With regard to what do</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar <b>disagree? Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the High Priest <b>performs</b> the sacrifice of <b>one</b> lamb in the morning, <b>as it is written: “Besides the morning burnt-offering,” and then he performs the service of the day</b> before he proceeds to sacrifice the other six lambs. Initially, only the minimum possible number of lambs is sacrificed <b>lest the High Priest become weak</b> by doing more. He might then be unable to complete the service of the day, which cannot be performed by anyone else and without which atonement cannot be achieved.

### Part 8
<b>And Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, holds: Since he has begun</b> to sacrifice the lambs <b>he performs</b> the sacrifice of <b>six</b> of them, leaving over only one until the afternoon. He sacrifices the maximum possible number of lambs now <b>lest he be negligent</b> later and fail to sacrifice so many at the close of the day. There is no concern that by doing so he might become weak and be unable to perform the service of the day, because <b>with regard to the service of the day,</b> the High Priest is <b>diligent</b> and will always muster the energy needed.

### Part 9
The Gemara notes: Despite their disagreements, <b>everyone</b> agrees, <b>however,</b> that <b>there is</b> only <b>one ram</b> for the people. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> Only one ram for the people is sacrificed, as <b>the one stated here</b> in Leviticus: “With this shall Aaron come into the Sanctuary: With a young bull for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 16:3), <b>is the same one</b> that is <b>stated in the Book of Numbers:</b> “And you shall sacrifice a burnt-offering to the Lord of pleasing odor: One young bull, one ram, seven unblemished year-old lambs shall be unto you” (Numbers 29:8). <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: There are two rams</b> for the people: <b>One that is stated here</b> in Leviticus, which is part of the service of the day, <b>and one stated in the Book of Numbers,</b> which is part of the day’s additional offerings.

### Part 10
<b>What is the rationale of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>As it is written: “One,”</b> implying one ram, not two. <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, what</b> is the meaning of <b>“one”?</b> “One” indicates that the ram used should be the <b>unique one,</b> i.e., the best, <b>of its flock.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And</b> from where does <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi derive the requirement that the ram be of the best stock? <b>He derives it from</b> the verse: <b>“Your choice vows”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:11), which teaches that all offerings must be from the choicest animals. <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> why is this additional verse necessary? <b>One</b> verse refers to <b>obligatory</b> offerings, <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> refers to <b>free-will</b> offerings. <b>And</b> both <b>are necessary</b> because the requirement in one case cannot be learned from the other. It is reasonable that a free-will offering must be from the choicest animal since it is a voluntary gift; and it is also reasonable that an obligatory offering should be the choicest, since an obligation must be fulfilled in the finest possible way.

### Part 12
§ It was taught in the mishna: The High Priest <b>sanctified his hands and feet</b> and entered the Holy of Holies to take out the incense spoon and the coal pan. The Gemara cites a related <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 16:23), which is taken to mean that he enters the Holy of Holies. <b>Why does he come?</b> He comes in order <b>to take out the</b> incense <b>spoon and the coal pan</b>
