### Part 1
Therefore, with regard to overriding the prohibition to bring an offering in a state of <b>ritual impurity,</b> since <b>the beginning</b> of the sacrifice of the daily offering <b>is fit to override</b> the prohibition of offering it in a state of <b>ritual impurity,</b> so too, <b>its end also overrides</b> the prohibition. However, in the case of <b>Shabbat, the beginning</b> of a daily offering of the weekday <b>is not fit to override</b> Shabbat, since by definition it must be brought on its appropriate day. Therefore, <b>its end also does not override</b> Shabbat in the event that limbs remain from Friday’s daily offering.

### Part 2
And it is also <b>not difficult to the</b> opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> because <b>he does not hold</b> that <b>its end is like its beginning.</b> Rather, he has the following reasoning: The prohibitions of <b>Shabbat</b> are not merely overridden <b>in</b> the case of <b>a communal</b> offering, but they are actually <b>permitted,</b> such that there is no need to try to avoid performing the necessary labors when sacrificing it. Therefore, <b>its end also overrides</b> Shabbat.

### Part 3
However, in the case of the prohibition to bring an offering in a state of <b>ritual impurity, which is</b> merely <b>overridden in</b> the case of <b>a communal</b> offering, it is preferable to avoid doing so. Therefore, <b>the beginning of</b> its sacrifice, i.e., its slaughter and the sprinkling of its blood, and its burning, <b>which is the essential</b> stage that provides <b>atonement, overrides</b> the prohibition and should be done even in a state of ritual impurity. However, <b>its end,</b> i.e., the burning of the sacrificial parts, <b>which is not the essential</b> stage that provides <b>atonement, does not override</b> the prohibitions.

### Part 4
The Torah prohibits the fire on the altar to be extinguished: “A perpetual fire shall be kept burning on the altar, it shall not go out” (Leviticus 6:6). With regard to this prohibition, an amoraic dispute <b>was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who extinguishes the fire of</b> the coals that are taken with <b>the coal pan</b> for the incense on Yom Kippur <b>or</b> the fire <b>of</b> the coals that are taken in order to light <b>the candelabrum, Abaye said: He is liable. Rava said: He is not liable.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara elaborates on the dispute: In a case <b>where one extinguished</b> a coal while still standing <b>upon the top of the altar, everyone agrees that he is liable.</b> This is because the verse explicitly is referring to extinguishing a flame “upon the altar.” <b>When they disagree,</b> it is in a case <b>where he brought</b> the coals <b>down to ground</b> level <b>and extinguished</b> a coal there. <b>Abaye said: He is liable,</b> since it is still considered <b>fire of the altar. Rava said: He is not liable,</b> because <b>once it has been removed</b> from the altar <b>it is</b> considered <b>removed</b> and no longer part of the altar’s fire. Therefore, the prohibition does not apply to it.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, with regard to <b>this</b> ruling <b>that Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: One who takes down a coal from upon the altar and extinguishes it is liable, in accordance with whose</b> opinion is he ruling? Could he possibly be ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye?</b> Certainly not. In disputes between Abaye and Rava, the <i>halakha</i> follows Rava.

### Part 7
The Gemara explains: <b>You can even say</b> his ruling <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava</b> by making the following distinction: <b>There,</b> in the ruling of Rav Naḥman, the coal <b>was notremoved to fulfill its mitzva.</b> Therefore, it is still considered to be part of the fire of the altar and the prohibition still applies. Whereas, <b>here,</b> in the dispute between Abaye and Rava, this is a case of coal that <b>was removed to fulfill its mitzva.</b> Therefore, it is associated with its mitzva and no longer considered the fire of the altar.

### Part 8
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of the dispute:

### Part 9
In a case <b>where he brought</b> the coals <b>down to the ground and extinguished</b> a coal there, <b>everyone agrees that he is not liable. When they disagree</b> it is in a case <b>where one extinguished</b> a coal while still standing <b>upon the top of the altar. Abaye said: He is liable,</b> since it is still considered <b>fire of the altar. Rava said: He is not liable,</b> because <b>once it has been removed</b> from the altar <b>it is</b> considered <b>removed</b> and no longer part of the altar’s fire. Therefore, the prohibition does not apply to it.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, with regard to <b>this</b> ruling <b>that Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: He who takes down a coal from upon the altar and extinguishes it is liable, in accordance with whose</b> opinion is his ruling? It would appear that it is <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye, nor in accordance</b> with the opinion of <b>Rava.</b> The Gemara explains: You can even say that his ruling is in accordance with the opinion of Rava by making the following distinction: <b>There,</b> in the ruling of Rav Naḥman, the coal <b>was not removed to fulfill its mitzva;</b> it is therefore still considered to be part of the fire of the altar and the prohibition applies. Whereas, <b>here,</b> in the dispute between Abaye and Rava, this is a case of coal that <b>was removed to fulfill its mitzva,</b> and it is therefore associated with its mitzva and no longer considered the fire of the altar.
