### Part 1
<b>Now you are certainly impure, as it is written</b> about the Jewish people: <b>“Her impurity was in her skirts”</b> (Lamentations 1:9), and the Divine Presence does not dwell upon the Jews when they are impure. Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to him: Come</b> and <b>see what is written about</b> the Jewish people: <b>“That dwells with them in the midst of their impurity”</b> (Leviticus 16:16). This indicates that <b>even when they are impure, the Divine Presence dwells among them.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the aforementioned <i>halakha</i>. It was stated above that the comparison to the goat teaches that the High Priest sprinkles the bull’s blood once upward; and the seven downward sprinklings of the goat’s blood are derived from the rite of the blood of the bull. Subsequently, the order of sprinkling toward the curtain in the Sanctuary is again derived by means of a similar comparison. The Gemara asks: <b>And does a matter derived by juxtaposition,</b> i.e., a <i>halakha</i> not written explicitly in the Torah but learned by means of a comparison, <b>again teach by juxtaposition?</b> There is a general principle that a <i>halakha</i> derived by juxtaposition with regard to offerings cannot subsequently teach another <i>halakha</i> by juxtaposition.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers that the first juxtaposition was not a proper inference by verbal analogy, as <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> that the High Priest must sprinkle once upward and seven times downward <b>is</b> derived both <b>from that</b> juxtaposition <b>and something else</b> as well. Since the basic requirement that he must sprinkle upward and downward for the bull and the goat is stated explicitly in both cases, and the comparison was necessary only to teach the precise number of sprinklings, this inference <b>is not</b> considered <b>a juxtaposition</b> to the extent that one cannot derive further comparisons from it.

### Part 4
The Gemara continues to question this explanation: <b>It works out well according to the one who said</b> that a juxtaposition that is also inferred from something else <b>is not</b> considered <b>a juxtaposition</b> in this regard; <b>but according to the one who says</b> that this too <b>is</b> called <b>a juxtaposition, what can be said?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> the <b>locations that are derived from one another.</b> The <i>halakha</i> of the blood of the bull was not derived from that of the goat, nor the <i>halakha</i> of sprinkling the bull’s blood outside the curtain from that of sprinkling the bull’s blood inside. Instead, the first comparison equates the sprinkling of the bull’s blood and the goat’s blood, while the second comparison equates the locations, i.e., he sprinkles outside the curtain in the same manner that he sprinkles inside. Consequently, the two juxtapositions are not connected to each other, which means that there is no problem of a <i>halakha</i> derived by juxtaposition itself teaching by juxtaposition.

### Part 6
<b>If you wish, say</b> instead a different resolution: The sprinkling <b>outside is derived from</b> the sprinkling <b>inside all at once,</b> i.e., the juxtaposition includes not only the blood of the bull and the goat, but also the manners of sprinkling the blood inside and outside. There are not two comparisons here, one derived from the other, but a single, complex juxtaposition.

### Part 7
§ A Sage <b>taught: When</b> the High Priest <b>sprinkles</b> the blood, <b>he does not</b> actually <b>sprinkle on the curtain but opposite the curtain. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: I saw</b> the curtain <b>in Rome.</b> After a miracle was performed on his behalf and he healed the daughter of the Roman emperor, Rabbi Elazar was permitted to view the ruler’s treasures and take whatever he wanted. He saw the Temple vessels that the Romans captured, including the curtain. Rabbi Elazar continued: <b>And on</b> the curtain <b>were several drops of blood from the bull and the goat of Yom Kippur.</b> This shows that the blood was actually sprinkled on the curtain.

### Part 8
The Gemara questions this conclusion: <b>But</b> how can Rabbi Elazar be sure that these drops of blood were from the bull and goat of Yom Kippur? <b>Perhaps</b> they <b>were</b> from the <b>bull for an unwitting communal sin</b> or <b>the goats for</b> a sin of <b>idolatry,</b> both of whose blood is also sprinkled on the curtain.

### Part 9
The Gemara explains <b>that he saw that these</b> sprinklings of blood <b>were performed in their order,</b> one drop after another, a sequence that is followed only in the Yom Kippur service. <b>And we also learned</b> in a mishna about <b>a case like this with regard to</b> the <b>bull for an unwitting communal sin: When he sprinkles,</b> the blood <b>would not touch the curtain, but if it did touch, it touched,</b> and this did not invalidate the service.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: I saw</b> the curtain <b>in Rome, and there were several drops of blood on it from</b> the <b>bull for an unwitting communal sin and</b> the <b>goats for</b> a sin of <b>idolatry.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> how could he identify the source of the blood; <b>perhaps they</b> were <b>from the bull and goat of Yom Kippur?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He saw that they were performed not in their order</b> and inferred that they must be sprinklings from communal sin-offerings, which are not presented in a sequence.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks a question: What should the High Priest do if <b>the blood</b> of the bull <b>became mixed with the blood</b> of the goat before he finished all the sprinklings? <b>Rava said:</b> He should <b>present</b> from the mixture <b>once upward and seven</b> times <b>downward, and that counts toward</b> both <b>this</b> one <b>and that</b> one, as he has sprinkled from both of them.

### Part 12
<b>They said this</b> answer <b>before Rabbi Yirmeya</b> in Eretz Yisrael, whereupon <b>he said: Foolish Babylonians! Because they live in a dark,</b> low <b>land, they speak darkened <i>halakhot</i>,</b> devoid of logic. If this solution is followed, when the High Priest sprinkles the mixture of bull and goat blood, <b>he</b> thereby <b>presents</b> the <b>upward</b> sprinklings <b>of the goat before</b> he sprinkles the <b>downward</b> presentations of the <b>bull; and the Torah said: “And when he has finished atoning for the sacred place”</b> (Leviticus 16:20), which teaches: <b>He finishes the blood of the bull</b> by sprinkling upward and downward, <b>and</b> only <b>afterward he finishes the blood of the goat.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> that the High Priest proceeds as follows: <b>He presents once upward and seven</b> times <b>downward for the purpose of</b> sprinkling the blood of <b>the bull,</b> as the blood of the bull is in this mixture. <b>And he again presents once upward and seven</b> times <b>downward for the purpose of</b> sprinkling the blood of <b>the goat.</b> Although the blood is mixed together and by sprinkling for the purpose of the bull’s blood he also sprinkles some of the goat’s blood, since he has only the bull’s blood in mind it is as though he did not sprinkle the blood of the goat at all.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks another question: What should the High Priest do if <b>the blood</b> of the bull <b>became mixed with the blood</b> of the goat <b>during the final presentations</b> that he performs in the Sanctuary? <b>Rav Pappa,</b> who was sitting <b>before Rava, thought to say: He presents seven</b> times <b>downward for the purpose of the bull and for the purpose of the goat, and he again presents once upward for the purpose of the goat.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rava said to him: Until now they called us</b> Babylonians merely <b>foolish, and now</b> they will call us the <b>foolish of the foolish, as</b> they will say that <b>we teach them and</b> yet <b>they do not learn.</b> In response to your statement one could simply repeat Rabbi Yirmeya’s previous argument: <b>But he presents downward</b> sprinklings <b>for the goat before</b> the <b>upward</b> sprinklings <b>for the goat, and the Torah said: Present upward and then downward.</b>
