### Part 1
<b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if he <b>thought</b> invalidating thoughts during <b>the raking of the coals?</b> Does this thought invalidate the incense? The Gemara elaborates: The question here is whether <b>actions that facilitate</b> the performance of <b>a mitzva are considered like the mitzva</b> itself. If so, merely raking the coals, which facilitates the mitzva of the incense, is like burning the incense itself; therefore, an improper thought would disqualify the incense. <b>Or</b> perhaps actions that facilitate the performance of a mitzva are <b>not</b> considered part of the mitzva itself. No answer was found for this question either, and the Gemara once again concludes: <b>Let it stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 2
§ The Sages <b>raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>carrying</b> the blood in one’s <b>left</b> hand? Is this action valid, or is carrying, like receiving and sprinkling the blood, an act that must be performed with the right hand? Rav Sheshet <b>said to the m: We</b> already <b>learned it;</b> there is an answer to this question from the mishna: <b>He took the coal pan in his right</b> hand <b>and the spoon in his left</b> hand. This proves that although the spoon is carried in the left hand to the place of the service, the rite is valid.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And let us resolve</b> this dilemma <b>for them from that which we learned</b> in a mishna: The priest who is privileged to carry the head and the leg of the daily offering to the ramp carried <b>the right leg</b> in his <b>left</b> hand, <b>with its</b> entire <b>hide</b> facing <b>outward</b> and the place of the slaughter on the neck facing the priest. This mishna also proves that carrying with the left hand is acceptable.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>If</b> the proof is <b>from there, I would have said: That applies</b> only to a type of <b>carrying that does not invalidate atonement,</b> as even if the limbs are not carried up to the altar, atonement is nevertheless achieved through the sprinkling of the blood. The rite is valid even if the limbs of the daily offering are not burned at all. <b>However, with regard to</b> the type of <b>carrying that does invalidate atonement,</b> e.g., carrying the blood to the altar, <b>no,</b> perhaps it must be done specifically with the right hand. Rav Sheshet therefore <b>teaches us</b> from the mishna that although carrying the spoon is necessary for the mitzva, the rite is nevertheless valid if it is carried in the left hand.
