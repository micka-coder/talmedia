### Part 1
<b>Ten</b> of those <b>cubits</b> stood <b>opposite the entrance to</b> the <b>Sanctuary. Eleven</b> of those <b>cubits</b> were <b>to the north</b> of the entrance <b>and eleven</b> of those <b>cubits</b> were <b>to the south</b> of the entrance. <b>It follows</b> that the <b>altar</b> was <b>aligned</b> precisely <b>opposite</b> the <b>Sanctuary and its walls.</b> According to this opinion, since the altar was directly aligned with the entrance of the Sanctuary, it blocked the entrance. The floor of Israelite courtyard was thirteen and a half cubits above the threshold of the Eastern Gate. Add nine cubits, which was the height of the altar, and the result is that the top of the altar was twenty-two and a half cubits higher than the threshold of the gate, rendering it impossible to see the entrance of the Sanctuary through the eastern gate of the Temple Mount. Therefore, it was necessary to lower the eastern wall to enable the priest standing on the Mount of Olives to see the entrance of the Sanctuary.

### Part 2
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that the <i>mishnayot</i> in tractate <b><i>Middot</i></b> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, do you find</b> that the <b>altar</b> stood <b>in the middle of</b> the <b>courtyard</b> in tractate <i>Middot</i>? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna there: <b>The</b> dimensions <b>of the entire courtyard were a length of 187</b> cubits <b>by a width of 135</b> cubits. That mishna elaborates: The length of the courtyard <b>from east to west</b> was <b>187</b> cubits, divided as follows: <b>The area of access</b> for the <b>Israelites,</b> known as the Israelite courtyard, was <b>eleven cubits</b> long. <b>The area of access</b> for <b>the priests to walk</b> and serve was <b>eleven cubits</b> long, and the <b>altar</b> itself was <b>thirty-two</b> cubits long. There were <b>twenty-two</b> cubits <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar, and the Sanctuary</b> was <b>one hundred cubits</b> long. <b>And</b> there was an additional <b>eleven cubits</b> of space <b>behind the Hall of the Ark Cover,</b> the Holy of Holies, which was at the western end of the Sanctuary.

### Part 3
The Gemara provides the dimensions of the Temple’s width <b>from south to north,</b> a total of <b>135</b> cubits. <b>The ramp and the altar</b> together were <b>sixty-two</b> cubits. The ramp and altar were each thirty-two cubits long, but two cubits of the upper part of the altar were subsumed in the base and ledge surrounding the altar. There were <b>eight cubits from the altar to the rings</b> to the north of the altar, through which the heads of the sacrificial animals were placed for slaughter. <b>The area of the rings</b> itself was <b>twenty-four</b> cubits, and <b>from the rings to the tables</b> on which the animals were rinsed there were an additional <b>four</b> cubits. <b>From the tables to the pillars</b> on which the animals were suspended for flaying there were an additional <b>four</b> cubits. <b>From the pillars to the courtyard wall</b> there were <b>eight cubits.</b> The total to this point is 110 cubits. <b>And the balance</b> of twenty-five cubits was <b>between the ramp and the</b> southern <b>wall,</b> along with the <b>area</b> filled by <b>the pillars</b> themselves, which was not included in the above tally. This yields a total of 135 cubits.

### Part 4
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that the <i>mishnayot</i> in tractate <b><i>Middot</i></b> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, do you find the altar in the middle of</b> the <b>courtyard? Most</b> of the <b>altar stands in the southern</b> part of the courtyard.
