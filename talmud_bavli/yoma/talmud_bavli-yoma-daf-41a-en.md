### Part 1
The Gemara now formulates the proof: <b>Who is</b> the author of <b>anonymous</b> halakhic statements made in the <b><i>Sifra</i>? Rabbi Yehuda. And</b> this <i>baraita</i> from the <i>Sifra</i> <b>teaches: The lottery makes it a sin-offering,</b> but verbally designating the goat with <b>the status</b> of a sin-offering <b>does not make it a sin-offering. Apparently,</b> according to Rabbi Yehuda, <b>the lottery is indispensable.</b> This <b>refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says that the lottery is not indispensable,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yannai, according to the second version of his dispute, <b>is</b> indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>

### Part 2
§ The Gemara addresses a similar case of designating offerings: <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Nests,</b> a pair of birds of which one bird must be sacrificed as a sin-offering and the other as a burnt-offering <b>become designated</b> for the specific type of offering <b>only</b> at one of two distinct points: <b>Either upon the owner’s taking</b> of them, when he initially purchases and consecrates them for his offering, <b>or upon the priest’s</b> actual <b>performance</b> of the sacrificial rite upon them.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: What is the reason of Rav Ḥisda? As it is written</b> in one verse: <b>“And she shall take</b> two turtledoves or two young pigeons, the one for a burnt-offering and the other for a sin-offering” (Leviticus 12:8). In another verse, it is also written: <b>“And</b> the priest shall <b>offer</b> them, the one for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 15:15). The verses mention only the possibility of designating the offering <b>either upon taking</b> them <b>or upon</b> the <b>performance</b> of the sacrificial rite.

### Part 4
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Ḥisda’s ruling from the <i>baraita</i> cited above: The verse states, with regard to the goat of Yom Kippur: <b>“And</b> Aaron shall…<b>offer it for a sin-offering”</b> (Leviticus 16:9). This indicates that <b>the lottery makes it a sin-offering,</b> but verbally designating the goat with <b>the status</b> of a sin-offering <b>does not make it a sin-offering.</b>

### Part 5
A verse is needed to teach this <i>halakha</i>, <b>as</b> I <b>might</b> have come to the opposite conclusion: <b>Is there not an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: Just as in a case in which</b> the use of <b>a lottery does not consecrate</b> the animals with a specific designation, nevertheless verbally designating the animals with <b>the required status does consecrate them,</b> so too, in <b>a case in which</b> the use of <b>a lottery does consecrate</b> the animals, <b>is it not</b> logically <b>right that</b> verbally designating the animals with <b>the required status should consecrate them?</b>

### Part 6
To counter this reasoning, <b>the verse states: “He shall make it a sin-offering”</b> to indicate that <b>the lottery makes it a sin-offering, but</b> verbally designating the goat with <b>the status</b> of a sin-offering <b>does not make it a sin-offering.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara explains the challenge to Rav Ḥisda’s ruling: <b>But here,</b> in the case of designating the goats, the <i>baraita</i> is focusing on the moment at which the lottery is held, <b>which is neither the time of taking</b> the goats <b>nor the time of performing</b> the sacrificial rite. Yet the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that were it not for a verse that teaches otherwise, it would be possible to permanently <b>establish</b> the animals’ designation through a verbal designation at that time. This contradicts Rav Ḥisda’s ruling.

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects the challenge: <b>Rava said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> does not contradict Rav Ḥisda’s ruling. <b>This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Just as in a case in which</b> the use of <b>a lottery does not consecrate</b> the animals with a specific designation, <b>even</b> if it is held <b>at the time of taking</b> the animals <b>or at the time of performing</b> the sacrificial rite, nevertheless verbally designating the animals with <b>the required status does consecrate them</b> if that is done <b>at the time of taking</b> the animals <b>or at the time of performing</b> the sacrificial rite; so too, in <b>a case in which</b> the use of <b>a lottery does consecrate</b> the animals, although it is held <b>neither at the time of taking</b> the animals <b>nor at the time of performing</b> the sacrificial rite, <b>is it not</b> logically <b>right that</b> verbally designating the animals with <b>the required status should consecrate them,</b> if it is done <b>at the time of taking</b> the animals <b>or at the time of performing</b> the sacrificial rite?

### Part 9
To counter this reasoning, <b>the verse states: “He shall make it a sin-offering”</b> to indicate that <b>the lottery makes it a sin-offering, but</b> verbally designating the goat with <b>the status</b> of a sin-offering <b>does not make it a sin-offering.</b> Rava has thereby explained the reasoning of the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with Rav Ḥisda’s ruling.

### Part 10
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another challenge to Rav Ḥisda’s ruling: One who inadvertently enters the Temple while ritually impure is required to bring a sliding-scale offering to achieve atonement. This offering is unique in that the specific offering one is required to bring depends upon his financial situation. With regard to this offering, a <i>baraita</i> teaches about the case of <b>a poor person who ritually impurified the Temple,</b> i.e., entered the Temple while ritually impure; <b>and he set aside money for his nests</b>, his bird pair, as he is required, as a poor person, to bring one bird as a sin-offering and one bird as a burnt-offering for atonement; <b>and</b> then <b>he became wealthy,</b> and he is consequently required to bring an animal sin-offering; <b>and afterward,</b> unaware of the <i>halakha</i> that he is no longer required to bring a bird pair, he separates his money into two portions and <b>said</b> that <b>these</b> coins <b>are for his sin-offering and those</b> coins <b>are for his burnt-offering.</b>

### Part 11
Then, in such a case, he <b>adds</b> more money <b>and brings his obligation</b> of an animal sin-offering <b>from the money</b> set aside <b>for hissin-offering,</b> but <b>he may not add</b> more money <b>and bring his obligation</b> of an animal offering <b>from the money</b> set aside <b>for his burnt-offering.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara explains the challenge to Rav Ḥisda’s ruling: <b>But here,</b> in the case of designating the money, the <i>baraita</i> is focusing on a moment <b>which is neither the time of taking</b> the money <b>nor the time of performing</b> the sacrificial rite with the birds. <b>And</b> yet the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that through a verbal designation one can permanently <b>establish</b> the status of the money, as is apparent from the fact that the money set aside for the burnt-offering may not be used toward the sin-offering. This contradicts Rav Ḥisda’s ruling.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Sheshet said: But</b> how <b>can you understand</b> the <i>baraita</i> that way? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Elazar say</b> that <b>Rabbi Hoshaya said: A wealthy person who ritually impurifies the Temple and brings</b> the <b>offering</b> that <b>a poor</b> person is required to bring <b>does not fulfill</b> his obligation. <b>Since he does not</b> and cannot <b>fulfill</b> his obligation with that offering, <b>how</b> can that designation permanently <b>establish</b> the status of the money?

### Part 14
<b>Rather, what have you to say</b> in order for the <i>baraita</i> to make sense? <b>That he had already said</b> his designation of the money <b>while in his impoverished state. Here also,</b> in order for the <i>baraita</i> not to contradict Rav Ḥisda’s ruling, it may be explained in a similar vein, <b>that he had already said at the time of</b> taking and <b>setting aside</b> his money, which monies were for his sin-offering and which were for his burnt-offering.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rabbi Ḥaga,</b> who <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoshiya said</b> that a wealthy person who brings the offering that a poor person is required to bring <b>does fulfill</b> his obligation,
