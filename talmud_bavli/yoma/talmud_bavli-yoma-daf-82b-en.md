### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to the <b>murderer himself, from where</b> do <b>we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i> that he should be killed rather than transgress the prohibition against murder? The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> derived through <b>reason,</b> as it was told: <b>A certain</b> person <b>came before Rava. He said to</b> Rava: <b>The master of the village</b> where I live <b>said to me: Kill so-and-so, and if</b> you do <b>not</b> do so, <b>I will kill you.</b> What should I do? Rava <b>said to him: Let yourself be killed, and you should not kill.</b> Rava reasoned: <b>What did you see</b> to make you think <b>that your blood is redder</b> and more important than his? <b>Perhaps the blood of that man is redder,</b> and he is more important than you. If so, it is logical that one must not kill another person to save himself.

### Part 2
§ With respect to a pregnant woman who smells food, it is told: <b>A certain pregnant woman smelled</b> a food and craved it. Those involved <b>came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi to ask how to proceed. <b>He said to those</b> who were inquiring: <b>Go and whisper to her that today is Yom Kippur. They whispered to her, and this whispering helped;</b> she stopped craving the food. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>read</b> this verse <b>about</b> the baby she was carrying: <b>“Before I formed you in the belly I knew you,</b> and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you” (Jeremiah 1:5), and indeed, the baby who <b>came out of</b> that woman was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara relates another story: <b>A certain pregnant woman smelled</b> food and had a craving to eat it on Yom Kippur. Those involved <b>came before Rabbi Ḥanina</b> to ask how to proceed. <b>He said to them: Whisper to her</b> that today is Yom Kippur. They whispered to her, but <b>she did not accept the whisper</b> and continued to crave the food. Rabbi Ḥanina <b>read</b> this verse <b>about</b> the baby:
