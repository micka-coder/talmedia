### Part 1
<b>Rav Pappa: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in a case where <b>he stuck the handful</b> of flour <b>onto the side of the vessel?</b> After the flour of a meal-offering has been separated, it must be placed in a vessel for burning, an action that sanctifies the flour. Rav Pappa inquires as to what the <i>halakha</i> is if the priest places the flour on the sides, instead of on the bottom of the vessel. The Gemara clarifies the two sides of the dilemma: Do <b>we require</b> the handful to be <b>inside the vessel, and that is</b> the case here? <b>Or perhaps we require</b> the handful to be <b>placed properly inside</b> the vessel, <b>and that is not</b> fulfilled in this instance. No answer is found for this question, and the Gemara concludes: <b>Let it stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 2
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi raised</b> a similar <b>dilemma: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if the priest <b>overturned the vessel and stuck</b> the <b>handful to</b> an indentation in <b>the underside of the vessel?</b> Do <b>we require</b> the handful to be <b>inside</b> the vessel, <b>and that</b> requirement <b>is</b> fulfilled here; <b>or perhaps we require</b> it to be <b>placed properly</b> in the vessel, <b>and that is not</b> the case here? With regard to this question as well, the Gemara states: <b>Let it stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 3
§ <b>Rav Pappa raised a dilemma:</b> Should <b>the handfuls to which</b> the Sages <b>referred</b> be <b>smoothed</b> over <b>or</b> slightly <b>overflowing? Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an explicit statement in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The handfuls to which</b> the Sages <b>referred</b> should be <b>neither smoothed</b> over <b>nor overflowing, but full,</b> without any flour spilling out.

### Part 4
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there,</b> in <i>Zevaḥim</i> 32a: If <b>the blood</b> of the sacrificial animal <b>spilled on the floor</b> instead of being collected directly into a vessel, <b>and</b> a priest <b>collected it</b> from there into a vessel, <b>it is disqualified,</b> as it was not collected properly. Conversely, if the blood spilled <b>from the vessel onto the floor,</b> after it was collected properly, <b>and</b> a priest <b>collected it</b> and put it back in the vessel, <b>it is valid.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a halakhic midrash: <b>“And</b> the anointed priest <b>shall take from the blood of the bull”</b> (Leviticus 4:5); this means that the priest shall take <b>from the blood of the soul,</b> i.e., the bull’s blood that flows from the place of slaughter as the animal dies, <b>and not from the blood of the skin,</b> which bleeds out when the skin is cut before the slaughter, <b>nor from the blood squeezed</b> from an animal after the initial spurt.

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> interprets the phrase <b>“from the blood of the bull,”</b> as though these words were written in a different order: <b>Blood from the bull,</b> i.e., the priest shall <b>receive it</b> directly. <b>For if it should enter your mind</b> that the letter <i>mem</i>, which means “from” in the phrase <b>“from the blood of the bull,”</b> is limiting <b>and</b> indicates that <b>even</b> if the priest received <b>some of the blood,</b> his action is acceptable, <b>didn’t Rav Yehuda say: He who receives</b> the blood <b>must receive all of the blood of</b> the <b>bull, as it is stated: “And all the blood of the bull he shall pour out on the base of the altar”</b> (Leviticus 4:7)? This verse emphasizes that the priest must pour all of the bull’s blood, which is possible only if he has collected all of it.

### Part 7
<b>Rather, learn from this</b> that <b>what is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“From the blood of the bull”?</b> It means that the priest must <b>receive</b> the <b>blood</b> directly <b>from the bull. And</b> this Sage <b>maintains</b> that the Sages <b>subtract and add and interpret homiletically,</b> i.e., one may take a letter from one word, insert it into a second word, and explain the phrase in that manner.

### Part 8
§ <b>Rav Pappa raised a dilemma</b> based on the above ruling: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if <b>the incense from his handfuls scattered?</b> Is <b>his hand considered like the neck of the animal, and</b> the incense is <b>disqualified? Or perhaps</b> his hand <b>is considered like a vessel used in the Temple service, and</b> if the incense fell from his hand <b>it is not disqualified.</b> No answer was found for this question either, and the Gemara again concludes: <b>Let it stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 9
§ <b>Rav Pappa raised</b> another <b>dilemma: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if the High Priest <b>thought</b> a disqualifying thought <b>during the taking of the handful of the incense,</b> e.g., if he intended to burn it after its appropriate time? Does this thought invalidate the rite or not? <b>Do we say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy of <b>“handfuls”</b> and <b>“handfuls,” from</b> the case of <b>a meal-offering,</b> as follows: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the meal-offering, <b>thought is effective</b> to invalidate <b>it, so too</b> here, with regard to taking a handful of incense, <b>thought is effective</b> to invalidate <b>it? Or</b> should the two cases <b>not</b> be compared?

### Part 10
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said to Rav Pappa: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to your dilemma: <b>Rabbi Akiva added the handful</b> of fine flour <b>and the incense, and the frankincense, and the coals</b> that are collected in a vessel, to the ruling of the Sages <b>that if one who immersed himself during the day touched part of them, he disqualifies all of them.</b> Due to the respect in which sacred objects are held, these objects are treated as one solid unit. This is so despite the fact that its parts are not really attached to each other but are separate small segments and therefore, logically, one who immersed himself during the day should disqualify only those parts of the item with which he came into direct contact.

### Part 11
The Gemara explains: <b>It enters your mind</b> that <b>from</b> the fact that <b>one who immersed himself during the day disqualifies</b> these items by touch, therefore <b>leaving</b> them after their permitted time <b>likewise disqualifies</b> them; <b>and from</b> the fact that <b>leaving</b> them after their time <b>disqualifies</b> them, therefore <b>thought likewise disqualifies</b> them. Consequently, as incense is similar to flour with regard to ritual impurity, it is also disqualified by the priest’s improper thought.

### Part 12
§ <b>Rav Pappa raised</b> another <b>dilemma:</b>
