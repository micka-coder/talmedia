### Part 1
In the case of one who <b>comes to measure</b> and purchase <b>naphtha,</b> the merchant <b>says to him: Measure</b> it <b>for yourself,</b> as I prefer to keep my distance from the foul odor. With regard to one who <b>comes to measure</b> and purchase <b>balsam,</b> the merchant <b>says to him: Wait for me until I</b> can <b>measure</b> it <b>with you, so that you and I will</b> both <b>be perfumed.</b> Similarly, with regard to sin God merely provides an opening, whereas with regard to mitzvot God assists the individual in their performance.

### Part 2
In <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael it was taught: Sin stupefies the heart of a person</b> who commits it, <b>as it is stated: “And do not impurify yourselves with them, so that you should not be thereby impurified”</b> (Leviticus 11:43) <b>Do not read</b> that term as: <b>“And be impurified [<i>venitmetem</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>And your</b> hearts will <b>be stupefied</b> [<b><i>venitamtem</i>].</b>

### Part 3
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following with regard to the verse: <b>“And do not impurify yourselves with them, so that you should not be thereby impurified”; a person who impurifies himself a bit, they impurify him greatly.</b> If a person impurifies himself of his own volition <b>below,</b> on earth, <b>they impurify him</b> even more so <b>above,</b> in Heaven. If a person impurifies himself <b>in this world, they impurify him in the World-to-Come.</b>

### Part 4
Conversely, <b>the Sages taught</b> the following with regard to the verse: <b>“Sanctify yourselves and you will be sanctified”</b> (Leviticus 11:44); <b>a person</b> who <b>sanctifies himself a bit, they sanctify him</b> and assist him <b>greatly.</b> If a person sanctifies himself <b>below, they sanctify him above.</b> If a person sanctifies himself <b>in this world, they sanctify him in the World-to-Come.</b>
