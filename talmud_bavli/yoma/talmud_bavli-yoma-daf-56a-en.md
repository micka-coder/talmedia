### Part 1
<b>ten</b> <i>log</i> that I will later separate shall be the <b>first tithe;</b> and another tenth from the rest, which equals <b>nine</b> <i>log</i> of the remaining ninety, shall be <b>second tithe. And he redeems</b> the second tithe with money that he will later take to Jerusalem, <b>and he</b> may then <b>immediately drink</b> the wine. After Shabbat, when he removes portions from the mixture and places them in vessels, they are retroactively designated as <i>terumot</i> and tithes. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
