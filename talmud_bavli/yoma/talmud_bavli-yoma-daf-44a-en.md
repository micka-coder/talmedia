### Part 1
I <b>might</b> have thought nobody should be present, <b>even in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states “in the Tent of Meeting,”</b> limiting the prohibition to the Temple itself. <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a prohibition exists <b>in the Tent of Meeting</b> of the Tabernacle <b>that was in the desert, from where</b> do I derive that the prohibition applies also to the Tabernacle that stood in <b>Shiloh, and</b> that it applies also to <b>the Eternal House,</b> i.e., the Temple in Jerusalem? <b>The verse states “in the Sanctuary,”</b> indicating that the prohibition applies to any Sanctuary.

### Part 2
<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a prohibition exists <b>during the burning</b> of the incense; <b>from where</b> do I derive that the prohibition applies also <b>during the presentations of the</b> bull’s <b>blood</b> in the Holy of Holies? <b>The verse states: “When he goes in to make atonement,”</b> and atonement is achieved through the presentations of blood. <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a prohibition exists from the time of <b>his entrance</b> into the Holy of Holies; <b>from where</b> is it derived that the prohibition remains in force until <b>his exit? The verse states: “Until he comes out.”</b>

### Part 3
The <i>baraita</i> concludes by expounding the final part of the verse: <b>“And have made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 16:17). This teaches that <b>his atonement precedes the atonement of his household; the atonement of his household precedes that atonement of his brethren, the priests; the atonement of his brethren, the priests, precedes the atonement of the entire community of Israel.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a prohibition exists <b>during the burning</b> of the incense. From <b>where</b> in the verse could this have <b>been inferred? Rava said, and similarly Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said, and similarly Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The conclusion of that <b>verse states: “And have made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel.” Which</b> act of <b>atonement is the same for him, and for his household, and for his brethren, the priests, and for the entire community of Israel? You must say this is the burning of the incense.</b>

### Part 5
Does <b>incense effect atonement?</b> The Torah mentions the concept of atonement only with regard to offerings. <b>Yes, as Rabbi Ḥananya teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>We learned of the incense that it effects atonement,</b> as <b>it is stated: “And he put on the incense and made atonement for the people”</b> (Numbers 17:12). <b>And the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: For what does incense effect atonement? For slander.</b> And why is that? <b>Let something that</b> is done <b>in secret,</b> i.e., the incense, which is burned in seclusion within the Sanctuary, <b>come and effect atonement for an act done in secret,</b> i.e., slander, which is generally said in private.

### Part 6
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there: They remove</b> themselves <b>from</b> the area <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar during the burning</b> of the incense. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: They taught</b> that this is true <b>only during the burning</b> of the incense <b>of the Sanctuary, but during the burning</b> of the incense <b>in the innermost</b> chamber, i.e., the Holy of Holies, people are required to <b>remove</b> themselves only <b>from the Sanctuary. They do not need to remove themselves</b> from the area <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava raised an objection</b> to Rabbi Elazar’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>, <b>and some say it unattributed: Rabbi Yosei says: Just as they remove</b> themselves <b>from</b> the area <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar during the burning</b> of the incense, <b>they similarly remove</b> themselves <b>during the</b> blood <b>presentations of the bull of the anointed priest,</b> i.e., of the High Priest, which he brings if he issues an erroneous halakhic ruling and acts upon it; and also during the blood presentations <b>of the bull for an unwitting</b> communal <b>sin</b> brought if the Sanhedrin issues an erroneous halakhic ruling and the community acts upon it; and also during the blood presentations <b>of the goats of idol worship</b> brought for an inadvertent communal transgression of idol worship.

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If so, <b>what higher standard is</b> applicable <b>to the Sanctuary relative to</b> the area <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar? Only that</b> those <b>in the Sanctuary remove</b> themselves <b>both during the</b> incense <b>burning and also</b> during the blood presentations, which is <b>not during the</b> incense <b>burning.</b> Those who are in the area <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar remove</b> themselves <b>only during the</b> incense <b>burning</b> but not during the blood presentations.

### Part 9
The Gemara explains the challenge: <b>In any case,</b> it is evident from the <i>baraita</i> that <b>during the</b> incense <b>burning they do remove</b> themselves. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to <b>during the burning</b> of the incense <b>of the innermost</b> chamber, i.e., the Holy of Holies? This would contradict Rabbi Elazar’s opinion.

### Part 10
The Gemara defends his opinion: <b>No,</b> it is referring to <b>during the burning of the</b> incense <b>of the Sanctuary.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> how can the <i>baraita</i> say: <b>What higher standard</b> is applicable to the Sanctuary? This implies that it is superior only with respect to one higher standard. <b>Are there not more? Surely, there is this higher standard, that whereas</b> the people <b>in the Sanctuary remove</b> themselves <b>both during its own,</b> i.e., the Sanctuary’s, incense <b>burning and during the</b> incense <b>burning of the innermost</b> chamber, i.e., the Holy of Holies, <b>but in</b> the area <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar they remove</b> themselves <b>only during the burning</b> of the incense <b>of the Sanctuary.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara explains: <b>This is</b> in fact what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching:</b> It is teaching <b>only that</b> those <b>in the Sanctuary remove</b> themselves <b>both during the burning</b> of the incense <b>and also</b> during the blood presentations, which is <b>not during the burning</b> of the incense; <b>from</b> the area <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar they do not remove</b> themselves,
