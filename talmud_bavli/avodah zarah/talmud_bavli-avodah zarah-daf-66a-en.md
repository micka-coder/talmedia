### Part 1
§ With regard to <b>old wine</b> used for a libation that fell <b>onto grapes, all agree</b> that the grapes are forbidden only <b>in</b> a case where the wine <b>imparts flavor</b> to them. With regard to <b>new wine</b> used for a libation, i.e., wine that had just been squeezed and has not yet fermented, that fell <b>onto grapes, Abaye says</b> that <b>any amount</b> renders the grapes forbidden, <b>and Rava says</b> that they are forbidden only <b>in</b> a case where the wine <b>imparts flavor</b> to them.

### Part 2
The Gemara explains their respective opinions: <b>Abaye says</b> that <b>any amount</b> renders them forbidden because he maintains that when categorizing substances in the context of the <i>halakhot</i> of mixtures <b>we follow the flavor,</b> and <b>this</b> wine <b>and those</b> grapes <b>are</b> of <b>the same flavor, which renders it</b> a case of <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance. And</b> the principle is that in a case of <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance, any amount</b> of the forbidden substance renders the mixture forbidden.

### Part 3
<b>And Rava says</b> that the grapes are forbidden only <b>in</b> a case where the wine <b>imparts flavor</b> to them because he maintains that when categorizing substances in the context of the <i>halakhot</i> of mixtures <b>we follow the name, and this</b> wine has <b>a discrete name, and those</b> grapes have their own <b>discrete name. And</b> accordingly, <b>this is</b> a case of <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with a different</b> type of <b>substance. And</b> the principle is that in a case of <b>a substance</b> in contact <b>with a different</b> type of <b>substance,</b> the mixture is forbidden only <b>in</b> a case where the forbidden item <b>imparts flavor</b> to it.

### Part 4
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna that in the case of <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation that fell on</b> cracked <b>grapes,</b> the grapes are forbidden. It <b>enters our mind</b> that this is referring to <b>new wine</b> falling <b>on grapes. What, is it not</b> the intention of the mishna that they are forbidden only <b>in</b> a case where the wine <b>imparts flavor</b> to the grapes? If so, then it is the name that counts, as the flavor of the wine in this case is the same as the grapes. The Gemara rejects this premise: <b>No,</b> the mishna means that <b>any amount</b> of the wine renders the grapes forbidden.

### Part 5
The Gemara challenges this explanation. <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in <b>the last clause: This is the principle: Anything that benefits</b> from a forbidden item <b>imparting flavor</b> to it is <b>forbidden,</b> and <b>anything that does not benefit</b> from a forbidden item <b>imparting flavor</b> to it is <b>permitted, by inference, we are dealing with</b> a case where the forbidden item <b>imparts flavor</b> to the permitted item.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> how does <b>Abaye</b> explain this? In his opinion, the ruling of <b>the mishna</b> is stated <b>with regard to old wine</b> that fell <b>onto grapes,</b> which are not of the same flavor, so it is reasonable that the grapes are rendered forbidden by an amount that imparts flavor.

### Part 7
This dispute between Abaye and Rava applies to another case as well. With regard to the case of <b>wine vinegar and malt vinegar</b> that became mixed together, and one is permitted and the other is forbidden, <b>and</b> also the case of <b>leaven of wheat</b> flour <b>and leaven of barley</b> flour that became mixed together, and one is permitted and the other is forbidden, <b>Abaye says:</b> The forbidden substance renders the mixture forbidden <b>in</b> a case where it <b>imparts flavor</b> to the mixture, because <b>we follow the flavor, and this flavor is discrete and that flavor is discrete, and</b> therefore <b>it becomes</b> a mixture of <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food <b>not</b> of <b>its</b> own <b>type. And a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food <b>not</b> of <b>its</b> own <b>type</b> is forbidden <b>in</b> a case where the forbidden food <b>imparts flavor</b> to the mixture.

### Part 8
<b>And Rava says: Any amount</b> of the forbidden substance renders the mixture forbidden, in accordance with his opinion that <b>we follow the name, and this is called vinegar and that is called vinegar, and this is called leaven and that is called leaven, and</b> therefore <b>it becomes</b> a mixture of <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food of <b>its</b> own <b>type, and</b> in <b>any</b> case of <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food of <b>its</b> own <b>type, any amount</b> of the forbidden substance renders the mixture forbidden.

### Part 9
<b>Abaye says: From where do I say that we follow the flavor? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Forbidden <b>spices</b> that are known by <b>two or three</b> different <b>names but are</b> of <b>the same species, or</b> of <b>three</b> different <b>species, are forbidden, and combine</b> together to render a dish forbidden. <b>And Ḥizkiyya says:</b> The reason the three species combine to render the dish forbidden is that <b>here we are dealing with types of sweet</b> spices. <b>Since they are</b> all <b>fit to sweeten the dish,</b> they combine, as they impart the same kind of flavor. Abaye explains: <b>Granted, if you say we follow the flavor, they are all</b> considered <b>the same flavor,</b> and therefore they combine. <b>But if you say we follow the name,</b> why should they combine to render the dish forbidden? <b>This name is discrete and that name is discrete.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And Rava</b> could <b>say to you:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that all forbidden foods combine, whether or not they have the same name or the same flavor, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Meir: From where</b> is it derived <b>that any</b> foods <b>forbidden by the Torah</b> that fall into a mixture <b>combine with one another</b> to render a mixture forbidden? <b>As it is stated: “You shall not eat anything abominable”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:3), which indicates that <b>anything that I have made abominable,</b> i.e., forbidden, <b>to you, is prohibited for consumption,</b> and therefore all of these prohibitions are actually a single general prohibition.

### Part 11
With regard to forbidden <b>vinegar</b> that fell <b>into</b> a barrel of <b>wine, all agree</b> that the mixture is forbidden <b>in</b> a case where the forbidden vinegar <b>imparts flavor</b> to the mixture. In a case of forbidden <b>wine</b> that spilled <b>into vinegar,</b> since the sharper smell of the vinegar overwhelms the smell of the wine before it mixes in, <b>Abaye says</b> that <b>any amount</b> of the wine renders the mixture forbidden, <b>and Rava says</b> that it is forbidden only <b>in</b> a case where the wine <b>imparts flavor</b> to the vinegar.

### Part 12
The Gemara explains their respective opinions: <b>Abaye says</b> that <b>any amount</b> renders the mixture forbidden,
