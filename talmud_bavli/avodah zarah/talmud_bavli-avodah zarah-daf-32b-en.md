### Part 1
If it does <b>not</b> have <b>a trace of blood upon it,</b> then it <b>is permitted. Rav Huna says: They taught</b> that a bloodless hide is permitted <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the gentile <b>did not salt it, but</b> if he <b>salted it,</b> it is <b>prohibited,</b> as <b>I say: Its salting removed</b> the trace of blood.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> A hide is <b>prohibited</b> only <b>when the tear</b> around its heart is <b>circular,</b> but if it is <b>elongated,</b> it <b>is permitted.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: If one rules that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, does that mean <b>by inference that</b> the Rabbis <b>disagree,</b> or perhaps there is no dispute and everyone accepts the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel? Rav Yosef <b>said to him: What difference is there to you</b> whether or not the Rabbis disagree? In either case the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. Abaye <b>said to him,</b> invoking a folk expression with regard to one who learns without achieving understanding: Is it simply <b>learn the lesson;</b> let <b>it be</b> like <b>a song?</b> In other words, is it sufficient to simply parrot the halakhic ruling? No; it is necessary to examine an issue to understand it even if it does not yield a practical halakhic difference.

### Part 4
§ The mishna further teaches: <b>Meat that enters the</b> house of <b>idol worship,</b> before it is sacrificed, is <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as if</b> one were to posit that it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> this would be difficult: <b>Doesn’t he say:</b> When slaughtering an animal, <b>a gentile’s unspecified intention</b> is to use it <b>for idol worship?</b> Accordingly, Rabbi Elazar would disagree with the ruling of the mishna that meat entering a house of idol worship is permitted.

### Part 5
The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> meat <b>that exits</b> the house of idol worship <b>is prohibited because it is</b> considered <b>as offerings to the dead,</b> i.e., idols. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that it is classified as such? It is because it is <b>impossible that it is not an idolatrous offering.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion does this reflect? It <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira.</b>

### Part 6
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that an idolatrous offering imparts ritual impurity by means of a tent</b> to an individual or item situated together with it under the same structure, even if they do not come into direct contact? <b>As it is stated: “They joined themselves also unto Baal of Peor, and ate the offerings to the dead”</b> (Psalms 106:28). <b>Just as a corpse imparts ritual impurity by means of a tent, so too idolatrous offerings impart ritual impurity by means of a tent.</b> Similarly, Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira would hold that just as it is prohibited to derive benefit from a corpse, so too it is prohibited to derive benefit from idolatrous offerings.

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>those going to a festival of idolatry,</b> it is <b>prohibited to engage with them in business.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>Shmuel says:</b> In the case of <b>a gentile who goes to a festival of idolatry,</b> if he is <b>on</b> his <b>way to</b> the festival <b>it is prohibited</b> to engage in business with him, <b>as he</b> subsequently <b>goes and</b> offers <b>thanks before</b> the object of <b>idol worship. Upon</b> his <b>return it is permitted,</b> as <b>what was, was,</b> i.e., he has already finished his worship, and refraining from engaging in business with the gentile at this stage will accomplish nothing.

### Part 8
Conversely, with regard to <b>a Jew who goes to a festival of idolatry,</b> if he is <b>on</b> his <b>way to</b> the festival <b>it is permitted</b> to engage in business with him, as <b>perhaps he will retract from</b> his plan <b>and will not go. Upon</b> his <b>return, it is prohibited, since</b>
