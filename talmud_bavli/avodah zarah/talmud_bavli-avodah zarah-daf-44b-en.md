### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A wise gentile, <b>Proclus ben Plospus,</b> once <b>asked</b> a question <b>of Rabban Gamliel in</b> the city of <b>Akko when he was bathing in the bathhouse of</b> the Greek god <b>Aphrodite.</b> Proclus <b>said to him: It is written in your Torah:</b> “And <b>nothing of the proscribed items shall cleave to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18). <b>For what reason do you bathe</b> before an idol <b>in the bathhouse of Aphrodite?</b>

### Part 2
Rabban Gamliel <b>said to him: One may not answer</b> questions related to Torah <b>in the bathhouse. And when he left</b> the bathhouse, Rabban Gamliel gave him several answers. <b>He said to him: I did not come into its domain; it came into my domain.</b> The bathhouse existed before the statue dedicated to Aphrodite was erected. Furthermore, people <b>do not say: Let us make a bathhouse</b> as <b>an adornment for Aphrodite; rather,</b> they <b>say: Let us make</b> a statue of <b>Aphrodite</b> as <b>an adornment for the bathhouse.</b> Therefore, the main structure is not the Aphrodite statue, but the bathhouse.

### Part 3
Rabban Gamliel continued: <b>Alternatively,</b> there is another answer: Even <b>if</b> people would <b>give you a lot of money, you would not enter</b> before <b>your</b> object of <b>idol worship naked, or</b> as <b>one who experienced a seminal emission</b> who comes to the bathhouse to purify himself, <b>nor</b> would you <b>urinate before it. This</b> statue <b>stands upon the sewage pipe and all the people urinate before it.</b> There is no prohibition in this case, as <b>it is stated</b> in the verse <b>only: “Their gods”</b> (see Deuteronomy 12:2), which indicates that a statue <b>that</b> people <b>treat as a deity</b> is <b>forbidden,</b> but one <b>that</b> people <b>do not treat</b> with the respect that is <b>due to a deity</b> is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna relates that Rabban Gamliel first told Proclus that he cannot answer a question related to Torah in a bathhouse. The Gemara asks: <b>And how could he have acted</b> in <b>this</b> manner? How could Rabban Gamliel have stated even this <i>halakha</i> in the bathhouse? <b>But doesn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: It is permitted to contemplate</b> matters of Torah <b>everywhere except for the bathhouse and the bathroom?</b>

### Part 5
<b>And if you would say</b> that Rabban Gamliel <b>stated</b> this ruling <b>to him in a secular language,</b> and therefore it was permitted for him to do so, this would not be a satisfactory answer; <b>but doesn’t Abaye say</b> that it is <b>permitted to say secular statements</b> in a bathhouse or bathroom <b>in the sacred tongue,</b> Hebrew, but it is <b>prohibited to say sacred,</b> Torah-related, <b>statements</b> even <b>in a secular language</b> in a bathhouse or bathroom?

### Part 6
The Gemara answers that the mishna actually <b>taught</b> as follows: <b>When he left</b> the bathhouse, Rabban Gamliel <b>said to him: One may not answer</b> questions related to Torah <b>in the bathhouse.</b>

### Part 7
§ <b>Rav Ḥama bar Yosef the Distinguished says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: Rabban Gamliel gave a deceptive response to that officer,</b> Proclus. <b>And I,</b> Rav Ḥama, <b>say that</b> the response <b>was not deceptive</b> but truthful.

### Part 8
The Gemara explains: <b>What was its deception,</b> according to Rabbi Oshaya? It was <b>that</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>said to him: This</b> statue <b>stands upon the sewage pipe and all people urinate before it.</b> In saying this, Rabban Gamliel meant that the statue has no idolatrous status as is evident from the demeaning conduct performed before it. <b>And</b> this claim is deceptive, as even <b>if one urinates before it, what of it?</b> Does that really negate its idolatrous status? <b>But doesn’t Rava say</b> that the idol of <b>Peor proves</b> the contrary, <b>as</b> its worshippers <b>defecate before it daily, and</b> its idolatrous status still <b>is not revoked?</b>

### Part 9
Rav Ḥama bar Yosef himself disagrees: <b>And I say</b> that <b>it is not a deceptive</b> answer. With regard to <b>that</b> idol, Peor, <b>its</b> standard manner of <b>worship is in that</b> manner; therefore, its status is certainly not revoked by that behavior. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>this</b> statue, Aphrodite, <b>its</b> standard manner of <b>worship is not in that</b> manner. Therefore, the display of demeaning conduct in its presence is indicative of a lack of reverence for it and of its lack of idolatrous status.

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said: The deception in</b> Rabban Gamliel’s response was <b>from here, when he said to him: I did not come into its domain, but</b> rather <b>it came into my domain.</b> He explains: <b>And</b> even <b>if it,</b> the bathhouse, <b>had come into its domain, what of it?</b> Even if the idol had preceded the bathhouse, it would still not render use of the bathhouse prohibited; <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (51b): With regard to an object of <b>idol worship that has a bathhouse or a garden</b> in front of it, <b>one may</b> derive <b>benefit from</b> the bathhouse or garden <b>without</b> showing <b>favor</b> by giving thanks or payment to its priests, <b>but one may not</b> derive <b>benefit from it while</b> showing it <b>favor?</b> Rabban Gamliel’s answer was therefore deceptive because the permissibility of using the bathhouse had nothing to do with its antecedence to the statue.

### Part 11
Rav Ḥama bar Yosef himself disagrees: <b>And I say</b> that <b>it is not a deceptive</b> answer, <b>as</b> even though <b>Rabban Gamliel</b> visited the bathhouse <b>without</b> showing <b>favor</b> by expressing thanks or giving payment, the very fact that such an esteemed visitor paid it a visit <b>is the equivalent of others</b> actively showing <b>favor.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya says: The deception in</b> Rabban Gamliel’s response was <b>from here, when he said to him: This</b> statue <b>stands upon the sewage pipe and all people urinate before it.</b> He explains: <b>And if people urinate before it, what of it?</b> That does not indicate a lack of idolatrous status; <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (53a): If one <b>spit in front of it, urinated in front of it, dragged it, or threw feces at it,</b> its status as an object of idol worship <b>is not revoked?</b>

### Part 13
Rav Ḥama bar Yosef himself disagrees: <b>And I say</b> that <b>it is not a deceptive</b> answer. <b>There,</b> the case of that mishna is of one who <b>temporarily rages against</b> the idol, <b>and afterward he appeases it. Here,</b> in the case of the Aphrodite statue erected on the sewage pipe, <b>each and every hour</b> the statue <b>remains in</b> a constant state of <b>disparagement.</b> This setup indicates a permanent lack of reverence and an absence of true idolatrous status.

### Part 14
<b>Rabba bar Ulla said: The deception in</b> Rabban Gamliel’s response was <b>from here, when he said to him</b> that people <b>do not say: Let us make a bathhouse</b> as <b>an adornment for Aphrodite; rather,</b> they say: <b>Let us make</b> a statue of <b>Aphrodite</b> as <b>an adornment for the bathhouse.</b> He explains: <b>And</b> even <b>if</b> people <b>say: Let us make a bathhouse</b> as <b>an adornment for Aphrodite, what of it? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who says: This house is</b> hereby dedicated <b>to idol worship,</b> or: <b>This cup is</b> hereby dedicated <b>to idol worship, he has said nothing,</b> i.e., his words take no effect, <b>as there is no</b> <i>halakha</i> of <b>consecration with regard to</b> objects of <b>idol worship.</b> While one can consecrate an item to the Temple through verbal designation, there is no such method for according idolatrous status to an object. Therefore, Rabban Gamliel’s deception lies in his indication that such a formulation would render the bathhouse forbidden as an object of idol worship.

### Part 15
Rav Ḥama bar Yosef himself disagrees: <b>And I say</b> that <b>it is not a deceptive</b> answer. <b>Although</b> the bathhouse would <b>not be rendered forbidden</b> as an object of idol worship due to a verbal designation, <b>it would at least have</b> the status of <b>an adornment</b> of an object of idol worship, which is also forbidden.
