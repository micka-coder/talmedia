### Part 1
<b>and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the mishna on 14b, that it is permitted to sell to a gentile large livestock that are damaged. Yet, it is prohibited to sell large undamaged beasts, just as one may not sell large undamaged livestock. <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> It is not necessary to explain that the mishna is referring to such a specific case. Rather, <b>an ordinary lion is</b> considered <b>damaged with regard to labor,</b> as lions are not generally used to perform labor. Therefore there is no concern that a lion will be used to perform prohibited labor on Shabbat.

### Part 2
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as one may not sell large livestock to</b> gentiles, <b>so too one may not sell large beasts to them. And even in a place where</b> the people were accustomed to <b>sell small livestock to</b> gentiles; nevertheless, <b>one may not sell large beasts to</b> them. The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava</b> is <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara presents a different version of this discussion. <b>Ravina raises a contradiction between the mishna</b> here <b>and a <i>baraita</i> and resolves</b> the contradiction. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One may not sell bears, or lions, or any item that can cause injury to the public, to</b> gentiles. Ravina analyzes the mishna: <b>The reason</b> a beast such as a lion cannot be sold to gentiles is <b>that it can cause injury to the public,</b> from which it may be inferred that with regard to another beast, which <b>does not cause injury to the public, one may sell</b> it to gentiles.

### Part 4
<b>And</b> Ravina <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as one may not sell large livestock</b> to gentiles, <b>so too, one may not sell large beasts</b> to them. <b>And even in a place where</b> the people were accustomed to <b>sell small livestock</b> to gentiles, <b>one may not sell large beasts</b> to them. The <i>baraita</i> indicates that one may never sell large beasts to gentiles, even if it poses no danger to the public. <b>And</b> Ravina <b>resolves</b> the contradiction between the mishna and the <i>baraita</i>: The ruling of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to a damaged lion, in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda. Rav Ashi says</b> there is a different explanation: <b>An ordinary lion is</b> considered <b>damaged with regard to labor.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Naḥman objects to</b> the inference drawn from the mishna: <b>Who will tell us that a lion is</b> considered <b>a large beast? Perhaps it is</b> considered <b>a small beast,</b> in which case it cannot be inferred that the mishna permits the sale of large beasts.

### Part 6
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav Ashi examined the mishna</b> here carefully, <b>and</b> from it he <b>raises a refutation</b> of the opinion of Rav Ḥanan bar Rava, who permitted the sale of large beasts. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One may not sell bears, or lions, or any item that can cause injury to the public, to</b> gentiles. Rav Ashi inferred two conclusions from here. First, <b>the reason</b> a beast such as a lion cannot be sold to gentiles is <b>because it can cause injury to the public,</b> whereas with regard to a beast that <b>does not cause injury to the public, one may sell</b> it to gentiles. This inference was cited in contradiction of the opinion of Rav, as explained before.

### Part 7
<b>And</b> Rav Ashi then inferred, in resolution of Rav’s opinion, that <b>the reason</b> the mishna specifies that one may sell <b>a lion</b> if it does not pose a danger to the public is <b>that an ordinary lion is</b> considered <b>damaged with regard to labor. But a different</b> animal <b>that performs labor</b> may <b>not</b> be sold. This presents a difficulty to the opinion of Rav Ḥanan bar Rava. The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava</b> is <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But in any event, what labor can a large beast perform?</b> Why is it necessary to prohibit the sale of large beasts if they are not trained to perform any labor? <b>Abaye said: Mar Yehuda said to me</b> that <b>in the house of Mar Yoḥani, they grind the mill with wild asses,</b> which are considered large beasts.

### Part 9
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira said: When we were in the</b> study <b>hall of Rav Yehuda, he said to us: Learn from me this matter, which I heard from a great man, but I do not know if</b> I heard it <b>from Rav or from Shmuel:</b> The status of <b>a large beast is like</b> that of <b>small livestock with regard to a spasm,</b> i.e., the symptoms of vitality required at the time of slaughtering.

### Part 10
Rabbi Zeira continued: <b>When I came to</b> the city of <b>Korkoneya, I found Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi sitting and saying in the name of Shmuel:</b> The status of <b>a large beast is like</b> that of <b>small livestock with regard to a spasm. I said</b> to myself: One can <b>conclude from</b> here that this <b>was stated in the name of Shmuel. When I came to Sura, I found Rabba bar Yirmeya sitting and saying in the name of Rav:</b> The status of <b>a large beast is like</b> that of <b>small livestock with regard to a spasm. I said</b> to myself: One can <b>conclude from</b> here that this <b>was stated in the name of Rav, and</b> it <b>was</b> also <b>stated in the name of Shmuel.</b>

### Part 11
<b>When I ascended to there,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>I found Rav Asi sitting and saying</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya says in the name of Rav:</b> The status of <b>a large beast is like</b> that of <b>small livestock with regard to a spasm. I said to him: And doesn’t the Master hold that the Master</b> who is responsible for dissemination <b>of</b> this <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>Rabba bar Yirmeya?</b> Why don’t you attribute the statement to him? Rav Asi <b>said to me: Black pot [<i>patya</i>],</b> a term of endearment for a scholar who works hard studying Torah: <b>From me and from you</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> may be concluded.</b> In other words, our two statements should be combined to form one accurate attribution of the <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 12
The Gemara notes that in fact this ruling <b>was also stated: Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The status of <b>a large beast is like</b> that of <b>small livestock with regard to a spasm.</b>

### Part 13
§ The mishna teaches that <b>one may not build</b> a basilica in conjunction with gentiles. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: There are three</b> types of <b>basilicas:</b> Those <b>of kings, and</b> those <b>of bathhouses, and</b> those <b>of storehouses. Rava says: Two</b> of these types <b>are permitted,</b> as they are not used for inflicting the death penalty, <b>and one is prohibited [<i>le’isor</i>]. And a mnemonic</b> device for this ruling, that the basilica of kings is prohibited, is the verse: <b>“To bind [<i>le’esor</i>] their kings with chains”</b> (Psalms 149:8).

### Part 14
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that this is what <b>Rava says: All</b> these types of basilica are <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: How can it be permitted to build any type of basilica; <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>One may not build with them a basilica, a tribunal, a stadium, or a platform?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the mishna means the following: One may not build in conjunction with gentiles a basilica <b>of a tribunal, or of a stadium, or of a platform.</b> But it is permitted to build a basilica that is not used for sentencing and inflicting the death penalty.

### Part 15
§ Apropos the above discussion, the Gemara relates incidents involving Sages who were sentenced by the ruling authorities. <b>The Sages taught: When Rabbi Eliezer was arrested</b> and charged <b>with heresy</b> by the authorities, <b>they brought him up to a tribunal to be judged. A certain</b> judicial <b>officer [<i>hegemon</i>] said to him:</b> Why <b>should an elder like you engage in these frivolous matters</b> of heresy?

### Part 16
Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: The Judge is trusted by me</b> to rule correctly. <b>That officer thought</b> that Rabbi Eliezer <b>was speaking about him; but</b> in fact <b>he said</b> this <b>only in reference to his Father in Heaven.</b> Rabbi Eliezer meant that he accepted God’s judgment, i.e., if he was charged he must have sinned to God in some manner. The officer <b>said to him: Since you</b> put <b>your trust in me,</b> you are <b>acquitted [<i>dimos</i>]; you are exempt.</b>

### Part 17
<b>When</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>came home, his students entered to console him</b> for being accused of heresy, which he took as a sign of sin, <b>and he did not accept</b> their words of <b>consolation. Rabbi Akiva said to him: My teacher, allow me to say one matter from</b> all of <b>that which you taught me.</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: Speak.</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: My teacher, perhaps</b> some statement of <b>heresy came before you</b>
