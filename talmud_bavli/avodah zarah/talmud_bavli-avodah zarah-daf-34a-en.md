### Part 1
<b>to them: I observe that they sweat,</b> i.e., they exude liquid from their exterior. <b>And since they sweat, they certainly absorb, and are</b> therefore <b>prohibited.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that they cannot be rendered permitted by purging with hot water? It is because <b>the Torah attested with regard to an earthenware vessel that</b> substances absorbed in it are <b>never expelled from its walls.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara reiterates its question: Mareimar ruled that glazed earthenware absorbs leavened bread permanently, but he did not rule likewise with regard to wine. But in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> leavened bread <b>different from wine</b> used for an idolatrous <b>libation?</b> Why is it <b>that Mareimar taught</b> with regard to <b>them: All glazed earthenware vessels are permitted,</b> even if they have contained wine of gentiles?

### Part 3
The Gemara adds: <b>And if you would say</b> that these cases are different, as <b>leavened bread</b> is prohibited <b>by Torah law</b> whereas <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation</b> is prohibited <b>by rabbinic</b> law, that is difficult: <b>But</b> there is a principle that <b>all</b> ordinances <b>that the Sages instituted, they instituted them parallel to Torah law.</b> Although this wine is prohibited by rabbinic law, it is subject to the same <i>halakhot</i> as leavened bread. The Gemara answers: <b>This one’s use is with hot</b> substances, <b>and that one’s use is with cold</b> substances. Wine is drunk while it is cold and is therefore absorbed to a lesser extent than leavened bread, which is often cooked in the vessel.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Akiva happened to</b> come to the city of <b>Ginzak,</b> whose residents <b>asked him</b> three questions to which he did not know the answer: First, <b>does one fast for hours, or does one not fast for hours?</b> The answer to the question <b>was not available to</b> Rabbi Akiva. Second, are clay <b>jars</b> that <b>belong to gentiles</b> permanently <b>prohibited, or</b> can they be rendered <b>permitted?</b> The answer <b>was not available to him.</b> Third, <b>in what</b> garments <b>did Moses serve all seven days of</b> the Tabernacle’s <b>inauguration,</b> as acting priest when Aaron and his sons were initiated into the priesthood? Moses presumably did not wear the priestly vestments, as he himself was not a priest. Once again, the answer <b>was not available to him.</b>

### Part 5
Rabbi Akiva <b>came</b> and <b>asked</b> these questions in the <b>study hall. They said to him:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one fasts for hours, and if he completed</b> the fast <b>he prays the prayer of a fast. And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that the <b>jars</b> that <b>belong to gentiles are permitted after</b> they have not been used for <b>twelve months.</b> Finally, <b>in what</b> garments <b>did Moses serve</b> during <b>the seven days of inauguration?</b> He did not serve in his own clothes, nor in the regular priestly vestments, but <b>in</b> a special <b>white cloak. Rav Kahana teaches:</b> Moses served <b>in a white cloak without a hem.</b>

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches that residual grape <b>seeds and grape skins</b> that <b>belong to gentiles</b> are prohibited. <b>The Sages taught:</b> Moist grape <b>seeds and grape skins</b> that <b>belong to gentiles</b> are <b>prohibited,</b> but <b>dry ones are permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Which are</b> considered <b>moist and which are</b> considered <b>dry? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> Grape residues are considered <b>moist</b> for <b>all</b> of the first <b>twelve months</b> after the grapes were pressed, and <b>dry after</b> the first <b>twelve months.</b>

### Part 7
<b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: When</b> these grape residues <b>are prohibited,</b> one is <b>prohibited even from</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from them. <b>When they are permitted, they are permitted even with regard to consumption.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Zevid says:</b> With regard to <b>these yeasts</b> produced from <b>the wine of Arameans, after twelve months</b> of <b>the year they are permitted. Rav Ḥaviva, son of Rava, says:</b> With regard to <b>these jugs</b> that belong to gentiles, <b>after twelve months</b> of <b>the year they are permitted. Rav Ḥaviva says:</b> With regard to <b>these</b>
