### Part 1
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that a convert and a gentile are permitted to divide up common property that includes objects of idol worship, <b>said?</b> This is said with regard to property <b>that they inherited; but</b> if <b>they were partners,</b> it is <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 2
§ The Gemara mentions another discussion among Rav Naḥman, Ulla, Avimi bar Pappi, and Rav Ḥiyya bar Ami. <b>They were sitting again and a dilemma was raised before them:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile who resides in Eretz Yisrael and observes the seven Noahide mitzvot [<i>ger toshav</i>],</b> including the prohibition against engaging in idol worship, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the possibility <b>that he can revoke</b> the status of objects of <b>idol worship?</b> Is it the case that one <b>who worships</b> idols <b>can revoke</b> the status of one, but one <b>who does not worship</b> them <b>cannot revoke</b> the status of one? <b>Or perhaps</b> should it be reasoned that <b>anyone who is of the same kind</b> as idol worshippers, i.e., a gentile, <b>can revoke</b> its status, <b>and</b> a <i>ger toshav</i> <b>is of the same kind</b> as idol worshippers?

### Part 3
<b>Rav Naḥman said to them: It stands to reason</b> that one <b>who worships</b> idols <b>can revoke</b> the status of one, but one <b>who does not worship</b> them <b>cannot revoke</b> the status of one.

### Part 4
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this ruling from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a Jew who found</b> an object of <b>idol worship in the marketplace, as long as it has not</b> yet <b>come into his possession, he can tell a gentile, and</b> the gentile <b>can revoke</b> its idolatrous status. <b>Once it has come into his possession, he cannot tell a gentile and</b> have the gentile <b>revoke</b> its status. This applies to any gentile, <b>because</b> the Sages <b>said: A gentile can revoke</b> the status of <b>his own</b> object of <b>idol worship or that of another</b> gentile, <b>whether he worships it or whether he does not worship it.</b>

### Part 5
<b>What</b> is meant by the phrase: <b>Worships it, and what</b> is meant by the phrase: <b>Does not worship it? If we say</b> both <b>this and that</b> are referring to <b>a gentile, this is</b> the same as the previous statement in the <i>baraita</i>, that a gentile can revoke the status of <b>his own</b> object of idol worship <b>or that of another</b> gentile, i.e., an object that he worships or one that another gentile worships. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> to be understood that the phrase: <b>Worships it,</b> is referring to <b>a gentile? And what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>Does not worship it?</b> It is referring to <b>a <i>ger toshav</i>,</b> who does not worship any idols. <b>And learn from it</b> that <b>a <i>ger toshav</i> can also revoke</b> the status of objects of idol worship.

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects this explanation. <b>No, actually, I will say to you</b> that <b>this</b> phrase <b>and that</b> phrase are both referring to <b>a gentile, and</b> with regard to that <b>which you say,</b> that <b>this is</b> the same as the statement concerning <b>his</b> object of idol worship <b>or that of another</b> gentile, it can be explained as follows: <b>The first clause</b> is referring to a case where both gentiles worship the same idol, e.g., <b>this</b> one <b>and that</b> one both worship <b>Peor, or this</b> one <b>and that</b> one both worship <b>Mercury,</b> and the <i>baraita</i> is teaching that one can revoke the status of an idol that belongs to the other. <b>The latter clause,</b> which distinguishes between one who worships it and one who does not worship it, is referring to a case where <b>this</b> one worships <b>Peor and that</b> one worships <b>Mercury,</b> indicating that an idolater can revoke the status of an idol that he does not worship at all, but only if he is himself an idolater, as opposed to a <i>ger toshav</i>.

### Part 7
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Who is a <i>ger toshav</i>?</b> It is <b>anyone who has accepted upon himself before three <i>ḥaverim</i>,</b> i.e., people devoted to the meticulous observance of mitzvot, especially <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity, <i>teruma</i>, and tithes, <b>not to worship idols.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And the Rabbis say: Anyone who has accepted upon himself</b> observance of the <b>seven mitzvot that the descendants of Noah accepted upon themselves</b> is a <i>ger toshav</i>.

### Part 9
<b>Others say: These have not entered the category of <i>ger toshav</i>. Rather, who is a <i>ger toshav</i>? This is a convert</b> who <b>eats</b> unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses,</b> which are not kosher, but <b>who has accepted upon himself to observe all of the mitzvot that are stated in the Torah except for the prohibition</b> against eating unslaughtered <b>carcasses.</b>

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Whatever the definition of a <i>ger toshav</i>, the following <i>halakhot</i> apply to him: <b>One may leave him alone with wine</b> briefly without Jewish supervision with no concern that he might use it for a libation, thereby rendering it forbidden to Jews, as he is not an idol worshipper. <b>But one may not deposit wine with him</b> for an extended period of time, lest he exchange it with the wine of a gentile, which is forbidden. <b>And</b> this applies <b>even in a town that has a Jewish majority. But one may leave him alone with wine</b> briefly without Jewish supervision <b>even in a town with a majority of gentiles. His oil is</b> treated <b>like his wine</b> in terms of its permissibility.

### Part 11
The Gemara interjects: <b>His oil is like his wine?</b> Can this <b>enter your mind? Does</b> the <b>oil</b> of a gentile <b>become,</b> i.e., assume the status of, <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation? Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should be emended as follows: <b>His wine is like his oil.</b> It is permitted to derive benefit from it, but not to consume it.

### Part 12
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And with regard to all other matters,</b> a <i>ger toshav</i> <b>is</b> treated <b>like a gentile. Rabban Shimon says: His wine is</b> treated like <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation. And some say</b> he says: Even <b>drinking</b> it is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara comments on the <i>baraita</i>: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: And with regard to all other matters,</b> a <i>ger toshav</i> <b>is</b> treated <b>like a gentile. With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this stated? Is it <b>not</b> teaching <b>that he can revoke</b> the status of an object of <b>idol worship as a gentile</b> can? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: No,</b> it is stated with regard to <b>giving</b> away rights in <b>a domain or renouncing</b> rights in <b>a domain</b> in the context of the <i>halakhot</i> of joining houses in courtyards for Shabbat.

### Part 14
<b>And</b> this is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An apostate Jew</b> who nevertheless <b>observes his Shabbat in the marketplace,</b> i.e., in public, <b>can renounce</b> his rights in a shared <b>domain</b> so the other Jews in the domain may carry in it on Shabbat, but an apostate <b>who does not observe his Shabbat</b> even <b>in the marketplace cannot renounce</b> his rights in <b>a domain, because</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that only <b>a Jew can give</b> away rights in his <b>domain or renounce</b> his rights in his <b>domain,</b> and this applies in the context of joining houses in courtyards on Shabbat.

### Part 15
<b>But with regard to a gentile,</b> this is not effective <b>unless</b> the Jew <b>leases</b> his domain in the courtyard. <b>How so?</b> A Jew <b>may say to</b> another Jew: <b>My</b> rights in this <b>domain</b> are hereby <b>acquired by you,</b> or: <b>My</b> rights in this <b>domain</b> are hereby <b>renounced to you,</b> and the other Jew thereby <b>acquires</b> those rights, <b>and it is not necessary</b> for him <b>to take possession</b> of it through a formal act of acquisition.

### Part 16
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yehuda sent a gift</b>
