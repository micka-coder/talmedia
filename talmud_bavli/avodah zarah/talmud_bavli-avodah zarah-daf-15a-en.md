### Part 1
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Even in a place where they prohibited leaving</b> an animal <b>in seclusion</b> with a gentile, it is <b>permitted to sell</b> it to a gentile. <b>What is the reason?</b> Once the animal is sold to the gentile, there is no concern that he will engage in bestiality. This is because <b>a gentile spares his</b> own <b>animal</b> from bestiality, <b>as</b> he does <b>not</b> want it to <b>become sterile</b> through this practice. By contrast, it is prohibited to leave one’s animal in seclusion with a gentile, as he would have no such compunction with regard to an animal belonging to others. The Gemara notes: <b>And even Rav retracted his</b> opinion; <b>as Rav Taḥlifa says</b> that <b>Rav Sheila bar Avimi says in the name of Rav: A gentile spares his animal, as</b> he does <b>not</b> want it to <b>become sterile.</b>

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: <b>But in every place one may not sell</b> to gentiles <b>large livestock,</b> calves, or foals, whether these animals are whole or damaged. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Granted, we are not concerned about</b> the gentile engaging in <b>bestiality</b> with the animal, but <b>we are concerned</b> about him <b>putting</b> the animal <b>to work</b> on Shabbat.

### Part 3
The Gemara expresses puzzlement: <b>And let</b> the gentile <b>put</b> it <b>to work.</b> Why should one be concerned about this possibility? <b>Since he bought it, he acquires it</b> and may put it to work on Shabbat, as it no longer belongs to the Jew. The Gemara answers: Selling it is prohibited by rabbinic <b>decree due to</b> the concern of <b>lending and due to</b> the concern of <b>leasing</b> the animal to the gentile, as in those cases the animal would be performing work on Shabbat when it is owned by a Jew.

### Part 4
The Gemara raises a further difficulty: But during that time period, the act of <b>borrowing</b> the animal causes the gentile to temporarily <b>acquire it, and</b> likewise, by <b>leasing</b> the animal, he temporarily <b>acquires it.</b> Why, then, is it a problem if the gentile puts the animal to work on Shabbat?

### Part 5
<b>Rather, Rami, son of Rav Yeiva, said:</b> Selling is prohibited by rabbinic <b>decree due to</b> the concern with regard to <b>testing. As at times, one sells</b> an animal <b>to</b> a gentile when it is <b>close to sunset of Shabbat eve, and</b> one <b>says to him: Go</b> and <b>test</b> the animal, <b>and it hears the voice of</b> its Jewish owner <b>and walks because of his</b> command. <b>And it is beneficial to</b> the Jewish seller <b>that</b> the animal <b>should walk,</b> as he wants to demonstrate to the gentile that it is fit for labor. <b>And</b> in this manner, <b>he is</b> considered <b>one who drives his</b> laden <b>animal on Shabbat. And one who drives his</b> laden <b>animal on Shabbat</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, objects to</b> the Gemara’s assumption that leasing confers ownership. <b>And</b> by <b>leasing</b> an item, <b>does one</b> actually <b>acquire</b> it? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (21a): <b>Even in a place</b> with regard to <b>which</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that it is permitted for a Jew <b>to rent</b> a house to a gentile, <b>they did not say</b> that one may rent it <b>for</b> use as <b>a residence, because</b> the gentiles will <b>bring</b> objects of <b>idol worship into it?</b> The objection is as follows: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that through <b>leasing</b> one <b>acquires</b> an item or property, then <b>when this</b> gentile <b>brings</b> the idols <b>into</b> the house <b>he brings them into his</b> own <b>house.</b> Why, then, is it prohibited for a Jew to rent a residence to a gentile?

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>Idol worship is different, as it is</b> a particularly <b>severe</b> prohibition, and therefore even an item that does not entirely belong to a Jew is treated with great stringency. <b>As it is written: “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26), and this house still retains the name of its Jewish owner.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Mesharshiyya,</b> also <b>objects to</b> the Gemara’s assumption that leasing confers ownership. <b>And</b> by <b>leasing</b> an item, <b>does one</b> actually <b>acquire</b> it? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 11:9): <b>An Israelite who rented a cow from a priest may feed it vetches of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the animal belongs to a priest; <b>and</b> conversely, <b>a priest who rented a cow from an Israelite, although the responsibility to feed it is incumbent upon him, he may not feed it vetches of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as it does not belong to him.

### Part 9
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that through <b>leasing</b> one <b>acquires</b> the item, <b>why can’t</b> the priest <b>feed it</b> vetches of <i>teruma</i>? After all, <b>it is</b> currently <b>his own cow. Rather, learn from</b> here that one <b>does not acquire</b> an item through <b>leasing.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And now that you</b> have <b>said</b> that one <b>does not acquire</b> an item through <b>leasing,</b> and therefore an animal that was leased to a gentile still belongs to the Jew, the original proposal can be accepted: The reason that one cannot sell large livestock to gentiles is a rabbinic <b>decree due to</b> the concern of <b>leasing, and a decree due to</b> the concern of <b>lending</b> the animal to the gentile, <b>and</b> also <b>a decree due to</b> the concern of <b>testing.</b>

### Part 10
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Adda permitted</b> the owners of a donkey <b>to sell</b> their <b>donkey</b> to gentiles <b>by means of</b> a Jewish <b>middleman [<i>desafseira</i>].</b> He reasoned as follows: <b>If</b> the concern is <b>due to testing,</b> in this case the animal <b>does not recognize the voice of</b> the middleman so <b>that it would walk because of him. And if</b> the concern is <b>due to lending and leasing, since</b> the donkey <b>is not his,</b> that middleman <b>would neither lend nor lease</b> it. <b>Additionally,</b> the middleman would not lease or lend the animal <b>because</b> he wants to sell it and <b>does not</b> want any <b>blemish to be revealed in it.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Huna sold a certain cow to a gentile. Rav Ḥisda said to him: What is the reason</b> that <b>the Master acted in that manner?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him:</b> I can <b>say</b> that <b>he purchased it</b> in order <b>to slaughter</b> it, not to use it for labor.
