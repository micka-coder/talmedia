<b>and in small barrels, even though</b> the grapes are squashed in the process and <b>the wine,</b> i.e., the juice, <b>sprays onto</b> the grapes, nevertheless they are <b>permitted.</b> Rav Kahana <b>said to</b> Rav Yeimar: <b>Are you saying</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> where the gentile already <b>brought</b> the grapes? The <i>baraita</i> is discussing whether the grapes are prohibited after the fact, whereas <b>I am saying</b> that one should not permit a gentile to bring the grapes <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain <i>etrog</i> that fell into a barrel of wine. A gentile jumped up</b> to <b>take it</b> out of the barrel, thereby unintentionally touching the wine. <b>Rav Ashi said to</b> the people standing there: <b>Hold his hand</b> still, <b>so that he does not stir</b> the wine and render it prohibited, <b>and tip</b> the barrel <b>until</b> the wine <b>is drained</b> into another vessel, and then he may take the <i>etrog</i>.

### Part 3
§ <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> In the case of <b>this gentile who intentionally poured a Jew’s wine as a libation</b> in order to render it prohibited, <b>even though</b> it is <b>prohibited to sell it to another gentile,</b> as one may not derive benefit from it, nevertheless, it <b>is permitted for him to collect its monetary</b> value <b>from that gentile. What is the reason</b> for this? It is considered as though the gentile <b>burned</b> the wine and destroyed it, and he is required to pay for the damage.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ashi says: From where do I say</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i>? This <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a gentile who poured a Jew’s wine as</b> an idolatrous <b>libation</b> but <b>not before</b> an object of <b>idol worship,</b> the wine is <b>prohibited, but Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava and Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira deem</b> it <b>permitted due to two</b> factors: <b>One</b> is <b>that</b> idol worshippers <b>pour wine as</b> an idolatrous <b>libation only before</b> an object of <b>idol worship. And</b> the other <b>one</b> is <b>that</b> the Jew <b>says to</b> the gentile: It is <b>not in your</b> power <b>to render my wine prohibited against my will.</b> Rav Ashi rules in accordance with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>. Nevertheless, he derives from the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava and Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira that one may collect compensation from the gentile, whose actions were against the will of the owner.

### Part 5
§ There was <b>a certain barrel of wine</b> from <b>which the stopper had been removed</b> and the wine was spilling out. <b>A gentile came, jumped up,</b> and <b>placed his hand on</b> the hole to prevent the wine from leaking. <b>Rav Pappa said: Any wine that is adjacent</b> to <b>the stopper</b> is <b>prohibited,</b> as it was touched by the gentile,
