### Part 1
<b>of Rabbi Volas: No,</b> this <i>halakha</i> is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> the gentile <b>has partnership in</b> the idol, <b>and</b> it <b>teaches us</b> that <b>it is</b> only <b>a Jew who cannot revoke</b> the status of <b>a gentile’s</b> object of idol worship. <b>But a gentile</b> can <b>revoke</b> the status of <b>his own</b> object of idol worship.

### Part 2
<b>There are those who teach</b> Rabbi Hillel’s statement <b>with regard to a <i>baraita</i>: Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says:</b> The status of <b>a Jew’s</b> object of <b>idol worship can never be revoked. What</b> is the reason for the additional emphasis of the term <b>never? Rabbi Hillel, son of Rabbi Volas, says:</b> The emphasis <b>is necessary only</b> for a case <b>where the gentile has partnership in</b> the idol, <b>and</b> it <b>teaches us that</b> the <b>Jew worships</b> the idol <b>based on his own intentions,</b> and therefore although the gentile revokes the status of his share, the Jew’s share remains forbidden.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>How does</b> a gentile <b>revoke</b> the status of an object of idol worship? If <b>he cut off the tip of its ear,</b> or <b>the tip of its nose,</b> or <b>its fingertip;</b> or if <b>he crushed it, even though he did not remove</b> any <b>part of it,</b> in all these cases he thereby <b>revoked</b> its status as an object of idol worship. If he <b>spat before</b> the idol, <b>urinated before it, dragged it</b> on the ground, or <b>threw excrement at it,</b> the status of <b>this</b> idol <b>is not revoked,</b> as this is only a temporary display of scorn, and afterward the gentile might continue to worship the idol. If the gentile <b>sold it or mortgaged it, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> He thereby <b>revoked</b> its status. <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that he <b>did not revoke</b> its status.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if the gentile crushed the idol without removing any part of it, the status of the idol is revoked. The Gemara asks: In a case <b>where he did not remove</b> any <b>part of it, by what</b> action <b>did he revoke</b> its status? <b>Rav Zeira says:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where he crushed its face</b> with a hammer, destroying its form, even though none of its stone was removed.

### Part 5
§ The mishna teaches: If he <b>spat before</b> the idol <b>or urinated before it,</b> the status of this idol is not revoked, as this is only a temporary display of scorn. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived?

### Part 6
<b>Ḥizkiyya says:</b> This is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “And it shall come to pass that, when he shall be hungry, he shall fret, and curse his king and his god, and turn his face upward”</b> (Isaiah 8:21). <b>And it is written after</b> this verse: <b>“And he shall look to the earth, and behold distress and darkness,</b> the gloom of anguish, and outspread thick darkness” (Isaiah 8:22). This indicates <b>that even though he cursed his king and his</b> idolatrous <b>god, and</b> he <b>turned his face upward</b> to God, nevertheless, <b>he</b> subsequently <b>looks to the earth</b> and beholds distress and darkness, since he returns to his idol worship.

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches: If the gentile <b>sold it or mortgaged it, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> He thereby <b>revoked</b> its status. And the Rabbis say that he did not revoke its status. The Gemara cites a dispute between that which <b>Ze’eiri</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and</b> that which <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba</b> says that <b>Rav says. One says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis applies only <b>when</b> the gentile sold his idol to <b>a gentile smith. But when</b> he sold it to <b>a Jewish smith everyone agrees</b> that by selling the idol the gentile <b>revoked</b> its status, as he knows that the Jewish smith will certainly melt it down. <b>And one says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> applies <b>to</b> the case where he sold the idol to <b>a Jewish smith.</b>

### Part 8
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: According to the second opinion, does the <b>dispute</b> apply only <b>to</b> the case where he sold the idol to <b>a Jewish smith; but</b> if he sold it to <b>a gentile smith everyone agrees</b> that he <b>did not revoke</b> its status by selling it? <b>Or perhaps both in this</b> case <b>and in that</b> case there is <b>a dispute.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara replies: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>, <b>as Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: My statement</b> that by selling the idol the gentile revokes its status <b>appears</b> correct in a case <b>where he sold it for</b> the purpose of <b>destruction, and the statement of my colleagues</b> that its status is not revoked appears correct in a case <b>where he sold it for</b> the purpose of <b>worship.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara explains the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning of selling the idol <b>for destruction, and what</b> is the meaning of selling it <b>for worship? If we say</b> that selling it <b>for destruction</b> means <b>literally</b> that he knew that it was being bought <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>destruction,</b> and that selling it <b>for worship</b> means <b>literally</b> that it was bought <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>worship,</b> this is difficult. <b>What is the reasoning of the one who says</b> that the gentile <b>revoked</b> the idol’s status even though he knew that the buyer intended to worship it, <b>and what is the reasoning of the one who says</b> that he <b>did not revoke</b> its status even though he knew that the buyer intended to destroy it?

### Part 11
<b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case where the buyer’s intentions were not known with certainty? And accordingly, selling the idol <b>for destruction</b> means selling it <b>to one who will</b> presumably <b>destroy it in the future. And who is that</b> buyer? This is referring to <b>a Jewish smith.</b> Similarly, selling the idol <b>for worship</b> means selling it <b>to one who will</b> presumably <b>worship it in the future. And who is that</b> buyer? This is referring to <b>a gentile smith.</b> Since Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi states that his opinion appears correct in the case of a Jewish smith and the opinion of his colleagues appears correct in the case of a gentile smith, one <b>may conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that there is <b>a dispute both in this</b> case <b>and in that</b> case.

### Part 12
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: My statement</b> that the idol’s status is revoked <b>appears to my colleagues</b> correct in a case <b>where he sold it for</b> the purpose of <b>destruction. And who is it</b> who buys the idol with the intent of destroying it? This is referring to <b>a Jewish smith.</b> This is <b>because even my colleagues disagreed with me only</b> in a case <b>where he sold it for</b> the purpose of <b>worship; but</b> when he sold it to a Jewish smith <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>destruction, they concede to my</b> opinion.

### Part 13
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who buys broken vessels</b> made from gold or silver <b>from the gentiles and finds among them</b> an object of <b>idol worship, if he pulled</b> the object of idol worship, thereby performing an act of acquisition, <b>before he gave</b> the <b>money</b> to the gentile, <b>he may return</b> the object of idol worship to the gentile. But <b>if he pulled</b> it <b>after he gave</b> the <b>money</b> to the gentile he may not return it. Since the idol’s status was not revoked, he must <b>take</b> it and cast it <b>into the Dead Sea.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara explains the objection: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>in</b> the case of a gentile who sells an object of idol worship to <b>a Jewish smith</b> there is <b>a dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis, the <i>baraita</i> is not difficult. In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that when a gentile sells an idol to a Jewish smith he does not thereby revoke its status. <b>But if you say</b> that the <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis applies only <b>when</b> the idol is sold to <b>a gentile smith, but in</b> the case of <b>a Jewish smith everyone agrees</b> that the gentile <b>revoked</b> the idol’s status, then in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>?

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: It <b>is different there, as</b> the gentile <b>sold</b> the metal <b>with the understanding that</b> he was selling <b>broken vessels,</b> and <b>he did not sell</b> the metal <b>with the understanding that</b> he was selling an object of <b>idol worship.</b> He therefore had no intention of revoking its status.

### Part 16
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> If a gentile <b>borrowed</b> money <b>against</b> an object of idol worship, using it as collateral, <b>or</b> with regard to another case <b>where a rockslide fell on it, or</b> a case <b>where robbers stole it, or</b> a case <b>where the owners abandoned it and went overseas,</b> the following <i>halakha</i> applies:
