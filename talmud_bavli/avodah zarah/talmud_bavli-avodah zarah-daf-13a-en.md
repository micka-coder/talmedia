### Part 1
<b>but it is permitted to cause benefit.</b> Although by buying from the store one indirectly supports idol worship, as a portion of the sales are given to support idol worship, this is not prohibited by Torah law. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even</b> if the stores are <b>adorned</b> only <b>with fruit</b> one is <b>also prohibited</b> from buying from them. This is derived by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: If it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>derive benefit</b> from idol worship, is it <b>not all the more so</b> prohibited to <b>cause benefit</b> to idol worship?

### Part 2
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Reish Lakish’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> On the <b>day in which a reduction</b> is made from <b>the tax</b> in honor of <b>idol worship, they announce and say: Anyone who takes a wreath</b> of roses <b>and places</b> it <b>on his head and on the head of his donkey in honor of</b> the object of <b>idol worship, his tax will be reduced. And if</b> one does <b>not</b> place a wreath on one’s head, <b>his tax will not be reduced.</b>

### Part 3
<b>What should a Jew who is present there do?</b> If <b>he places</b> the wreath on his head and on the head of his donkey, he will <b>be found to derive benefit</b> from idol worship. And if <b>he does not place</b> the wreath on his head, he will <b>be found to cause benefit</b> to idol worship, through the tax that he pays.

### Part 4
<b>From here</b> the Sages <b>stated: One who conducts business in a market of idol worship</b> will be forced either to benefit from or cause benefit to idol worship. Therefore, any <b>animal</b> he bought there <b>should be destroyed,</b> any <b>produce, clothing or vessels should</b> be left to <b>decompose,</b> and with regard to any <b>money or metal vessels,</b> which would not decompose on their own, <b>one should take them</b> and cast them <b>into the Dead Sea. And what</b> constitutes <b>destroying</b> the animal? <b>One cuts</b> off <b>the hooves of</b> the animal <b>from the knee and below.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara explains the objection to Reish Lakish’s statement. <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that it is prohibited to cause benefit to idol worship, as it states: If <b>he places</b> the wreath on his head then he will <b>be found to derive benefit</b> from idol worship, and if <b>he does not place</b> the wreath on his head, he will <b>be found to cause benefit</b> to idol worship. How, then, can Reish Lakish claim that it is permitted to cause benefit to idol worship?

### Part 6
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya, son of Rav Idi, said: Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish holds</b> as follows: <b>The Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Natan,</b> whose opinion is cited in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>and I spoke in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis who disagree with</b> Rabbi Natan. The Gemara notes: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who rules in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Natan, <b>holds</b> that the Rabbis <b>do not disagree</b> with Rabbi Natan; rather, everyone agrees that it is prohibited to cause benefit to idol worship.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that <b>they do not disagree? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may go to a fair of gentiles,</b> whose purpose is to honor to idol worship, <b>and buy from</b> the gentiles <b>animals, and slaves, and maidservants,</b> as the purchase raises the items to a more sanctified state; and he may buy <b>houses, fields, and vineyards</b> from them, due to the mitzva to settle Eretz Yisrael. <b>And one may write</b> the necessary deeds <b>and confirm</b> them <b>in their</b> gentile <b>courts [<i>be’arkaot</i>],</b> although this involves an acknowledgement of their authority, <b>because it is as though he is rescuing</b> his property <b>from their hands,</b> as the court’s confirmation and stamp of approval prevents the seller from denying the sale and claiming that the property still belongs to him.

### Part 8
<b>And if he is a priest, he may become ritually impure by</b> going <b>outside Eretz</b> Yisrael, even though a priest is usually prohibited from leaving Eretz Yisrael to the impure land outside, in order <b>to litigate</b> with them <b>and to contest their</b> claims. <b>And just as</b> a priest <b>may become ritually impure</b> by going <b>outside Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>so may he become ritually impure</b> for this purpose <b>by</b> entering <b>a cemetery.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara interrupts its citation of the <i>baraita</i> to express surprise at this last ruling: <b>Can it enter your mind</b> to say that a priest may become impure <b>by</b> entering <b>a cemetery?</b> The <i>halakha</i> that a cemetery imparts <b>ritual impurity</b> to a priest is <b>by Torah law;</b> how could the Sages override this prohibition? <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>an area where there is uncertainty with regard to the location of a grave or a corpse [<i>beit haperas</i>],</b> owing to the fact that a grave had been unwittingly plowed over, and the bones may have become scattered throughout the field. Such a field imparts ritual impurity <b>by rabbinic law.</b>

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> a priest <b>may</b> likewise <b>become ritually impure</b> and leave Eretz Yisrael in order <b>to study Torah or</b> in order <b>to marry a woman. Rabbi Yehuda says: When</b> does this allowance apply? It applies <b>when he cannot find</b> a place <b>to study</b> in Eretz Yisrael. <b>But when</b> the priest <b>can find</b> a place <b>to study</b> in Eretz Yisrael, <b>he may not become ritually impure</b> by leaving the country.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even when he can find</b> a place <b>to study</b> Torah in Eretz Yisrael, <b>he may</b> leave the country and <b>become ritually impure, because a person does not merit to learn from everyone,</b> and it is possible that the more suitable teacher for him lives outside of Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Yosei says,</b> in support of his opinion: There was <b>an incident involving Yosef the priest, who followed his teacher to</b> the city of <b>Sidon,</b> outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>to learn Torah</b> even though the preeminent Sage of his generation, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, lived in Eretz Yisrael. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> about this: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara returns to the issue at hand. This <i>baraita</i> <b>apparently</b> indicates that the Rabbis do <b>disagree</b> with Rabbi Natan, as they hold that it is permitted to buy items from a gentile fair and cause benefit to idol worship, whereas the ruling of Rabbi Natan is a minority opinion. The Gemara responds: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said to you: Actually,</b> the Rabbis <b>do not disagree</b> with Rabbi Natan, and even according to this <i>baraita</i> one is prohibited from causing benefit for idol worship.

### Part 14
The Gemara elaborates: <b>And</b> the fact that the <i>baraita</i> permits buying at a gentile fair is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>here,</b> where Rabbi Natan prohibits buying items from a gentile fair, he states his ruling <b>with regard to one who buys from a merchant, as a tax is taken from him</b> for the benefit of idol worship; whereas <b>there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that permits buying items at the fair, it states its ruling <b>with regard to one who buys from a homeowner,</b> i.e., a private individual, <b>where a tax is not taken from him.</b>

### Part 15
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the <i>baraita</i> that cited the opinion of Rabbi Natan. <b>The Master said</b> above: Any <b>animal</b> that one bought there <b>should be destroyed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> a requirement to prevent <b>suffering to animals? Abaye said:</b> Although there is an enjoinder against causing suffering to a living creature, it is permitted when necessary, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> to Joshua: <b>“You shall destroy their horses”</b> (Joshua 11:6).

### Part 16
<b>The Master said</b> above: <b>And what constitutes destroying</b> the animal? <b>One cuts the hooves of</b> the animal <b>from the knee and below.</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may neither consecrate</b> objects, <b>nor dedicate</b> items for sacred use, <b>nor valuate</b> an item’s worth based on its appraisal (see Leviticus, chapter 27) and dedicate its monetary worth to the Temple treasury, <b>in the present</b> time, when the Temple no longer exists. <b>And if one did consecrate, or dedicate, or valuate</b> items for sacred use, the presence of these items might lead to the violation of the prohibition against using consecrated property. Therefore, if one dedicated <b>an animal it should be destroyed.</b> If he dedicated <b>produce, garments, or vessels</b> made from materials that decompose,
