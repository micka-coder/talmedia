### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar does not accept</b> the principle that a sharecropper works for his <b>tenancy,</b> rather than as the Jew’s employee. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, with regard to <b>a gentile, what is the reason</b> that it is <b>permitted</b> to rent to him? The Gemara answers <b>that we say to him</b> that he may not perform labor on certain days, <b>and he complies.</b> The Gemara asks: If that is so, then in the case of <b>a Samaritan as well, we can say to him</b> that he may not perform labor on certain days, <b>and he</b> will <b>comply.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>A Samaritan</b> will <b>not comply, as he says: I am more learned than you,</b> and I know that it is permitted to work on these days.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, why</b> does Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar state <b>specifically</b> that the reason for the prohibition is <b>because</b> the field <b>is called by the name of</b> the owner? <b>Let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>due to</b> the fact that the Samaritan, like a Jew, is commanded to refrain from labor during the intermediate days of the Festival, and since he will work on these days, renting him a field is included in the prohibition: <b>“You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14). The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar <b>states one</b> reason <b>and</b> adds <b>another: One</b> reason is <b>that</b> of the prohibition: You shall not put a stumbling block <b>before the blind; and, furthermore,</b> it is prohibited <b>because</b> the field <b>is called by the name of</b> the owner.

### Part 3
§ The Gemara relates that there were <b>certain saffron growers</b> who jointly owned a field in an arrangement according to <b>which a gentile took possession</b> of the field and worked in it <b>on Shabbat, and a Jew</b> took possession of it <b>on Sunday. They came before Rava,</b> to find out if they could divide their profits equally, and Rava <b>permitted them</b> to do so.

### Part 4
<b>Ravina raised an objection to</b> the ruling of <b>Rava</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a Jew and a gentile who received</b> tenancy of <b>a field in partnership,</b> with the understanding that they were to work the field and receive part of its produce in exchange, <b>the Jew may not say to the gentile: Take your portion</b> of the profit for your work <b>on Shabbat, and I</b> will take my portion for my work <b>on</b> one of the days of the rest of <b>the week.</b> The reason one may not do so is that it turns out that when the gentile worked on Shabbat, he was laboring partly on behalf of his Jewish partner. <b>But if they initially stipulated</b> when they entered into their partnership that the gentile would receive a share of the profit in exchange for his work on Shabbat, and the Jew would receive a share for the work that he performs during one of the days of the week, it is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And if</b> they did not make this stipulation and later <b>came to calculate</b> the number of weekdays for which the Jew should receive the profit, corresponding to the number of <i>Shabbatot</i> that the gentile worked, it is <b>prohibited,</b> as this would mean that when the gentile worked on Shabbat, he was working on behalf of the Jew. Rava was <b>embarrassed</b> that he had ruled incorrectly. <b>Ultimately, the matter was revealed that</b> the saffron growers <b>had stipulated from the outset</b> that this was the arrangement, and therefore even according to the <i>baraita</i> Rava had ruled correctly.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Geviha from Bei Ketil said</b> that the incident was actually as follows: The Jew and the gentile formed a partnership with regard to <b>those <i>orla</i> saplings,</b> to tend to them and sell them. <b>The gentile would</b> work and <b>profit</b> from them during <b>the <i>orla</i> years,</b> the first three years after the tree is planted when it is prohibited for a Jew to eat its fruit, <b>and the Jew</b> would work and profit from them during <b>the years where</b> the fruit is <b>permitted. They came before Rava,</b> who <b>permitted them</b> to do so.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Ravina object to</b> the ruling issued by <b>Rava?</b> The Gemara answers: No, Ravina’s intention was <b>to provide a support for</b> the ruling of Rava. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> wasn’t Rava <b>embarrassed</b> by Ravina’s statement? The Gemara answers: <b>That never happened.</b>

### Part 8
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If the partners did <b>not specify</b> that the gentile would work on Shabbat and the Jew during the week, but they also did not calculate their profits so that they would split the earnings equally, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara attempts to provide an answer from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: If they initially stipulated</b> that the gentile would receive a share of the profit in exchange for his work on Shabbat, while the Jew would receive a share for the work on one of the other days of the week, it is <b>permitted.</b> This indicates that <b>without specification,</b> it is <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Say the last clause: If</b> they <b>came to calculate</b> their profits, it is <b>prohibited;</b> this indicates that <b>without specification,</b> doing so is <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather, no</b> inference is <b>to be learned from this</b> <i>baraita</i>, as the inferences contradict each other.
