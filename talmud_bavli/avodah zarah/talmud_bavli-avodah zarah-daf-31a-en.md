### Part 1
It is <b>prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit from nondescript wine</b> of a gentile, <b>and</b> the wine <b>imparts the ritual impurity of liquids when</b> it has the volume of <b>one-quarter</b> of a <i>log</i>. With regard to the wine of <b>one who deposits his wine with a gentile,</b> one is <b>prohibited from drinking</b> it, <b>but</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it.

### Part 2
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 11b): With regard to <b>one who deposits his produce with a gentile,</b> it has the status <b>of the produce of a gentile</b> with regard <b>to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>and</b> with regard <b>to tithe,</b> as the gentile might have exchanged the Jew’s produce with untithed produce or produce of the Sabbatical Year. According to this logic, wine deposited with a gentile should be entirely prohibited, due to the concern that the gentile exchanged it with his own. The Gemara answers: It is permitted for one to derive benefit from the wine in a case <b>where</b> the gentile <b>designated a corner for</b> the Jew’s wine, i.e., if the wine was locked away in a specific place to which only a Jew has access.

### Part 3
The Gemara questions this: <b>If that is so, drinking</b> from the wine should <b>also be permitted. As Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> once <b>happened</b> to come <b>to Parod,</b> where the deceased <i>tanna</i> bar Kappara had lived. When he arrived, <b>he said: Is there any Mishna of bar Kappara</b> here? In response, <b>Rabbi Tanḥum of Parod taught him</b> the following <i>baraita</i>, citing bar Kappara: With regard to <b>one who deposits his wine with a gentile, drinking</b> from the wine <b>is permitted.</b>

### Part 4
Upon hearing this, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>read</b> the following verse <b>about him: “Where the tree falls, there it shall be”</b> (Ecclesiastes 11:3). Does it <b>enter your mind</b> that this means that the tree itself <b>will be there?</b> It is obvious that a fallen tree lands where it falls. <b>Rather,</b> the verse is saying: <b>There its fruits shall be.</b> The verse is a metaphor for a Sage, and its fruits represent his disciples. Rabbi Yoḥanan was intimating that although bar Kappara may have died, Rabbi Tanḥum, his disciple, perpetuates his wisdom.

### Part 5
In any event, it is apparent from the <i>baraita</i> quoted by Rabbi Tanḥum that there is a case in which it is permitted to drink wine deposited with a gentile. This contradicts the statement of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira. <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that it is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which permits drinking wine deposited with a gentile, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> whereas <b>that</b> statement of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 6
Rabbi Zeira elaborates: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>both one who purchases or one who rents a house</b> located <b>in a gentile’s courtyard, and they filled</b> the house with containers of <b>wine, and</b> the <b>key</b> to the house <b>or a seal is in the possession of a Jew,</b> so that the gentile cannot access the wine, in which case it is even more secure than when a corner is designated for the Jew’s wine, <b>Rabbi Eliezer permits</b> the wine, <b>and the Rabbis prohibit</b> it.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Naḥmani, says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Ze’eiri says, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says: Abba bar Ḥama said to me</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>Ze’eiri said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Elazar says: All</b> substances are sufficiently <b>secured by one seal, except wine, which is not</b> sufficiently <b>secured by one seal. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even wine is secured by one seal. And they do not disagree</b> in their reasoning. Rather, <b>this</b> opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> and <b>that</b> opinion of Rabbi Elazar is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 9
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: All</b> substances are <b>secured by a seal within a seal,</b> i.e., two seals, <b>except wine, which is not secured by a seal within a seal. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even wine is secured by a seal within a seal. And both</b> hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that <b>when the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer,</b> it is <b>with regard to one seal, but</b> in the case of <b>a seal within a seal,</b> they concede that there is no concern that the gentile might have opened it, and therefore <b>they permit</b> the wine. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, <b>holds</b> that <b>they prohibited even</b> wine that was secured by <b>a seal within a seal.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>What is a seal within a seal like? Rava says: A basin</b> placed <b>over the mouth of a barrel</b> that is <b>smeared</b> with clay <b>and</b> stamped with <b>a seal is</b> considered <b>a seal within a seal. And if not,</b> it is <b>not</b> considered a seal within a seal. If <b>a basket</b> is placed over a barrel <b>and</b> is <b>fastened</b> to it, this <b>is a seal within a seal;</b> if it is <b>not fastened</b> to the barrel, <b>it is not a seal within a seal.</b> With regard to <b>a wineskin</b> that is placed <b>in a sack [<i>disakaya</i>],</b> if the wineskin’s <b>stopper is</b> facing <b>downward,</b> this <b>is a seal within a seal;</b> if <b>its stopper is</b> facing <b>upward,</b> this <b>is not a seal within a seal. And if he bends the</b> wineskin’s <b>bottleneck inward and ties</b> the sack <b>and seals</b> it, this <b>is</b> also considered <b>a seal within a seal.</b>

### Part 11
§ <b>The Sages taught: At first,</b> the Sages <b>would say</b> that <b>wine from</b> the Samaritan city of <b>Ein Kushi is prohibited, due to</b> the concern that it might have come into contact with the idolatrous inhabitants of <b>Birat Serika, and</b> similarly the wine <b>of Barkata is prohibited due to</b> the idolatrous inhabitants of <b>the village of Parshai, and</b> the wine <b>of Zagdor is prohibited due to the village of Shaleim.</b> Subsequently, <b>they retracted</b> and began <b>saying: Open barrels are prohibited</b> but <b>sealed</b> barrels <b>are permitted.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> did they <b>reason initially, and what</b> did they <b>reason ultimately?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Initially</b> they <b>reasoned: A Samaritan is not particular about the touch of</b> an idolatrous <b>gentile,</b> and <b>there is no difference</b> in this regard between <b>open</b> barrels <b>and sealed</b> barrels. <b>And ultimately</b> they <b>reasoned: When</b> Samaritans <b>are not particular</b> about agentile’s touch, this is only <b>with regard to open</b> barrels, but <b>with regard to sealed</b> barrels, <b>they are particular.</b> Since Samaritans ensure that gentiles do not handle sealed barrels of wine, this wine is permitted.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>But are sealed</b> barrels <b>permitted? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> against this notion
