If a mouse <b>fell into vinegar, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does it enhance its flavor? <b>Rav Hillel said to Rav Ashi: There was</b> such <b>an incident</b> in <b>the study hall of Rav Kahana, and Rav Kahana deemed</b> the vinegar <b>forbidden.</b> This indicates that it enhances the flavor. Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> This is not a proof. <b>That</b> mouse <b>was dismembered,</b> and Rav Kahana deemed the vinegar forbidden due to concern that one might consume a substantive piece of the mouse in the vinegar, which is prohibited regardless of the taste.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>Ravina thought</b> that the quantity of vinegar necessary for nullifying the flavor of the mouse should be <b>calculated at 101</b> times the volume of the mouse. <b>He said:</b> It should <b>not</b> be rendered <b>worse,</b> i.e., more stringent, <b>than <i>teruma</i>,</b> which is nullified by 101 times its volume in a mixture. This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 4:7): <b><i>Teruma</i> is nullified</b> in a mixture <b>by 101</b> times its volume of permitted food. <b>Rav Taḥlifa bar Giza said to Ravina: Perhaps</b> this case is <b>similar to spice of <i>teruma</i> in a pot, whose flavor is not nullified</b> even by 101 times its volume of permitted food, as the flavor imparted by spice is exceptionally strong.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Aḥai calculated</b> the amount <b>of vinegar</b> necessary to nullify the flavor of the mouse <b>at fifty</b> times its volume. Although forbidden food in a mixture usually requires the presence of sixty times its volume of permitted food to be nullified, vinegar has a sharp enough flavor that it nullifies the mouse with less. <b>Rav Shmuel, son of Rav Ika, calculated</b> the amount <b>of beer</b> necessary for nullifying the mouse <b>at sixty</b> times the volume of the mouse.

### Part 4
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>this and that,</b> both vinegar and beer, nullify the mouse <b>with sixty</b> times its volume, <b>and so</b> is the ruling for <b>all prohibitions in the Torah.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a gentile who was transporting barrels of wine from</b> one <b>place to</b> another <b>place</b> together <b>with a Jew, if</b> the wine <b>was under the presumption of being supervised,</b> it is <b>permitted.</b> But <b>if</b> the Jew <b>notified him that he was going far away,</b> the wine is forbidden if the Jew left for <b>a sufficient</b> amount of time <b>for</b> the gentile <b>to bore a hole [<i>sheyishtom</i>]</b> in the barrel, <b>seal</b> it again with plaster, <b>and</b> for the plaster to <b>dry. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The wine is forbidden only if it was <b>sufficient</b> time <b>for</b> the gentile <b>to open the barrel</b> by removing the stopper altogether, <b>stop</b> it again by making a new stopper, <b>and</b> for the new stopper to <b>dry.</b>

### Part 6
With regard to <b>one who placed his wine in a wagon or on a ship</b> with a gentile, <b>and went on his way by a shortcut [<i>bekappendarya</i>],</b> such that the gentile does not know when the Jew will encounter him, even if the Jew <b>entered the city and bathed,</b> the wine is <b>permitted,</b> because the gentile would not use the wine for a libation, for fear the owner might catch him at it.

### Part 7
<b>If</b> the Jew <b>informed</b> the gentile <b>that he was going away</b> for a long period of time, the wine is forbidden if it was <b>sufficient</b> time <b>for</b> the gentile <b>to bore a hole</b> in the barrel, <b>seal</b> it again with plaster, <b>and</b> for the plaster to <b>dry. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> It is forbidden only if it was <b>sufficient</b> time <b>for him to open the barrel</b> by removing the stopper altogether, <b>stop</b> it again, <b>and</b> for the new stopper to <b>dry.</b>

### Part 8
With regard to <b>one who left a gentile in</b> his <b>shop, even if</b> the Jew <b>went out and came in</b> and was not there all the time, the wine is <b>permitted. But if</b> the Jew <b>informed</b> the gentile <b>that he was going away</b> for a long period of time, the wine is forbidden if it was <b>sufficient</b> time <b>for</b> the gentile <b>to bore a hole</b> in the barrel, <b>seal</b> it again with plaster, <b>and</b> for the plaster to <b>dry. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The wine is forbidden only if it was <b>sufficient</b> time <b>for</b> him <b>to open the barrel, stop</b> it again, <b>and</b> for the new stopper to <b>dry.</b>

### Part 9
If a Jew <b>was eating with</b> a gentile <b>at the table, and left jugs [<i>laginin</i>]</b> of wine <b>on the table and a jug on the side table [<i>hadulebaki</i>], and he left it and went out, what is on the table</b> is <b>forbidden,</b> as it is likely that the gentile handled it, whereas <b>what is on the side table</b> is <b>permitted. But if</b> the Jew <b>said to</b> the gentile: <b>Mix</b> water with the wine <b>and drink, even</b> the jug <b>that is on the side table</b> is <b>forbidden.</b> Similarly, <b>open barrels are forbidden,</b> but <b>sealed</b> barrels <b>are permitted</b> unless the Jew was out of the room for <b>sufficient time for</b> the gentile <b>to open</b> the barrel by removing the stopper, <b>and stop</b> it again by making a new stopper, <b>and</b> for the new stopper to <b>dry.</b>

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What are the circumstances</b> described by the phrase: <b>Under the presumption of being supervised?</b> The Gemara explains: It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one’s <b>donkey drivers and laborers were</b> unreliable with regard to ritual impurity [<i>amei ha’aretz</i>], and they were <b>laden with</b> wine or produce that was <b>ritually pure,</b> and he had instructed them not to tamper with it but he does not know whether or not they heeded him, <b>even</b> if <b>he went away from them</b> to a distance of <b>more than a <i>mil</i>, his pure items are</b> still <b>pure,</b> as it may be presumed that they heeded his instructions. <b>But if he said to them: Go and I will come after you,</b> so that they knew he would not be going with them, then <b>once they are out of his sight his pure items are impure.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in <b>the first clause,</b> where the produce is pure, <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> where it is impure? <b>Rav Yitzḥak said:</b> The ruling of <b>the first clause</b> is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case where <b>he purified his donkey drivers and laborers for this</b> assignment by having them immerse so they would not transfer impurity to the produce.

### Part 12
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If that is so,</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> this would <b>also</b> apply. The Gemara answers: <b>An <i>am ha’aretz</i> is not punctilious about contact with another</b> person. Although they themselves were purified, they may have met another <i>am ha’aretz</i> on the way, and the produce would be rendered impure by him. The Gemara further objects: <b>If so,</b> then <b>let us say so even</b> in <b>the first clause;</b> the produce should be impure in that case as well.
