### Part 1
because a liquid <b>whose smell is vinegar and</b> its <b>flavor is wine</b> is considered <b>vinegar,</b> and the wine, when it spilled into the barrel of vinegar, took on the smell of vinegar from the moment it reached the airspace of the barrel, <b>and it has</b> therefore <b>become a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food of <b>its</b> own <b>type. And any type</b> of forbidden food mixed <b>with</b> food of <b>its</b> own <b>type</b> renders the mixture forbidden <b>by any amount.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rava says</b> that the mixture is forbidden only <b>in</b> a case where the wine <b>imparts flavor</b> to the vinegar, because a liquid <b>whose smell is vinegar and</b> its <b>flavor is wine</b> is considered <b>wine, and it has</b> therefore <b>become a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food <b>not</b> of <b>its</b> own <b>type. And any type</b> of forbidden food mixed <b>with</b> food <b>not</b> of <b>its</b> own <b>type</b> renders the mixture forbidden only <b>in</b> a case where it <b>imparts flavor</b> to the mixture.

### Part 3
§ With regard to <b>this bunghole [<i>bat tiha</i>],</b> the hole in a barrel through which one can smell the wine, if <b>a gentile</b> smells <b>a Jew’s</b> wine through it, the wine is <b>permitted,</b> but for <b>a Jew</b> to smell <b>a gentile’s</b> wine through it, <b>Abaye says</b> that it is <b>prohibited,</b> whereas <b>Rava says</b> that it is <b>permitted. Abaye says</b> that it is <b>prohibited</b> because he holds that <b>a smell is</b> a substantial <b>matter,</b> a significant form of pleasure, and it is not permitted to derive benefit from a gentile’s wine. <b>Rava says</b> it is <b>permitted</b> because he holds that <b>a smell is nothing;</b> it is insignificant.

### Part 4
<b>Rava says: From where do I say that a smell is nothing?</b> It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 10:4): With regard to <b>an oven that one lit with cumin</b> stalks <b>of <i>teruma</i> and baked bread in it, the bread</b> is <b>permitted because</b> it has <b>not</b> absorbed <b>the flavor of</b> the <b>cumin</b> stalks <b>but</b> only <b>the smell of</b> the <b>cumin</b> stalks. This indicates that smell alone does not render a food forbidden. <b>And</b> how does <b>Abaye</b> explain this? He answers that <b>it is different there, as the forbidden substance was burned.</b> The smell of the forbidden cumin stalks entered the bread after the cumin stalks themselves were consumed by the fire, and a smell that is not from an extant substance is not forbidden. By contrast, in a case where the smell is from an extant source, it is forbidden.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Mari said:</b> This dispute between Abaye and Rava is <b>paral-lel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 10:3): With regard to <b>one who detached a hot</b> loaf of <b>bread</b> from the oven <b>and placed it on the opening of a barrel of wine of <i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> the bread <b>forbidden</b> to non-priests, as in his opinion the smell of the wine renders the bread forbidden to them, <b>and Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> it <b>permitted. Rabbi Yosei deems</b> it <b>permitted in</b> a case of <b>wheat</b> bread <b>but deems</b> it <b>forbidden in</b> a case of <b>barley</b> bread, <b>because the barley draws out</b> the fumes of the wine. Rav Mari explains: <b>What, is it not with regard to this</b> matter that the Sages in the mishna <b>disagree: That</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that <b>a smell is</b> a substantial <b>matter, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>a smell is nothing?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara remarks: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava,</b> the dispute between him and Abaye <b>is certainly</b> parallel to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as he must concede that Rabbi Meir holds that a smell is a substantial matter. But <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye, shall we say</b> that <b>it is</b> parallel to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye</b> could <b>say to you</b> that Rabbi Yehuda also holds that a smell is a substantial matter. <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says: In</b> the case of <b>a hot</b> loaf of <b>bread and an open barrel,</b>
