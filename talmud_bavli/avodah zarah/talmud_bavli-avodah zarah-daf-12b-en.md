### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the <i>baraita</i> to teach that it is prohibited to drink from fountains formed in the figure of human <b>faces?</b> If the reason is to teach the <i>halakha</i> in a life-threatening situation, the <i>baraita</i> already addressed this issue in the case of the spring. The Gemara answers: It was included <b>because</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>wanted to teach</b> the continuation of that <i>halakha</i>: <b>Similarly, one may not place his mouth on a pipe and drink, due to the danger</b> that this poses.

### Part 2
The Gemara inquires: <b>What danger</b> is the <i>baraita</i> referring to here? It is referring to the danger of swallowing <b>a leech</b> in the water. As <b>the Sages taught: A person should not drink water from rivers or from ponds either</b> by drinking from the water directly <b>with his mouth, or</b> by collecting the water <b>with one hand</b> alone. <b>And if he drank</b> in this manner, <b>his blood is upon his</b> own <b>head, due to the danger.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is this <b>danger?</b> It is <b>the danger of</b> swallowing <b>a leech.</b>

### Part 3
This <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> In the case of <b>one who swallows a water leech [<i>nima</i>],</b> it is <b>permitted to</b> perform labor on Shabbat and <b>heat water for him</b> to drink <b>on Shabbat,</b> as his life is in danger. <b>And</b> in fact there was <b>an incident involving one who swallowed a water leech, and Rabbi Neḥemya permitted</b> them <b>to heat water for him on Shabbat.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>In the meantime,</b> until the water is ready, what should he do? <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: He should swallow vinegar.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Idi bar Avin said: One who swallowed a hornet will not live,</b> as the hornet will sting him to death. <b>Nevertheless, they should give him a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of sharp [<i>shamgaz</i>] vinegar to drink.</b> In this manner <b>it is possible that he will live</b> for <b>a bit</b> longer <b>until he can instruct his household</b> with regard to his final wishes before dying.

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught: A person should not drink water at night. And if he drank, his blood is upon his</b> own <b>head, due to the danger.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this <b>danger?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The danger of</b> the <b><i>shavrirei</i>,</b> an evil spirit that rules over water. <b>And if he is thirsty, what is his remedy? If there is another</b> person <b>with him, he should wake him and say to him: I thirst for water,</b> and then he may drink. <b>And if</b> there is <b>no</b> other person with him, <b>he should knock with the lid on the jug and say to himself: So-and-so, son of so-and-so, your mother said to you</b> to <b>beware of</b> the <b><i>shavrirei verirei rirei yirei rei</i>,</b> found <b>in white cups.</b> This is an incantation against the evil spirit.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a city in which idol worship</b> is practiced <b>and in which there are stores that are adorned</b> for the sake of idol worship <b>and</b> there are others <b>that are not adorned, this was</b> in fact <b>an incident</b> that occurred <b>in Beit She’an, and the Sages said:</b> With regard to <b>the adorned</b> shops, it is <b>prohibited</b> to buy from them, <b>but</b> in the case of <b>those that are not adorned</b> it is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: They taught</b> that buying is prohibited <b>only</b> in the case of stores that are <b>adorned with roses and myrtle, as one derives benefit from</b> their <b>smell</b> and they serve as offerings to objects of idol worship. <b>But</b> with regard to stores that are <b>adorned with fruit,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to buy from them. <b>What is the reason</b> that they are permitted? <b>As the verse states: “And there shall cleave nothing dedicated to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18), i.e., the items dedicated to idol worship. From here it is derived that <b>it is prohibited</b> to <b>derive benefit</b> from idol worship,
