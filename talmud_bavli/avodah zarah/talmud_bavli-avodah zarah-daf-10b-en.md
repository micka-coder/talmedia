### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>let him say</b> his advice <b>explicitly?</b> Why did Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi answer in such a circumspect way, which could have been interpreted incorrectly? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> to himself: If I answer openly, <b>the important Romans</b> might <b>hear me and will cause</b> me <b>anguish.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>let him say</b> his advice <b>quietly?</b> The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was still worried that they might hear what he had said, <b>because it is written:</b> “Curse not the king, no, not in your thought, and curse not the rich in your bedchamber, <b>for a bird of the air shall carry the voice”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:20).

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: Antoninus <b>had a certain daughter whose name was Gira,</b> who <b>performed a prohibited action,</b> i.e., she engaged in promiscuous intercourse. Antoninus <b>sent a rocket plant [<i>gargira</i>] to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, to allude to the fact that Gira had acted promiscuously [<i>gar</i>]. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>sent him coriander [<i>kusbarta</i>],</b> which Antoninus understood as a message to kill [<i>kos</i>] his daughter [<i>barta</i>], as she was liable to receive the death penalty for her actions. Antoninus <b>sent him leeks [<i>karti</i>]</b> to say: I will be cut off [<i>karet</i>] if I do so. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi then <b>sent him lettuce [<i>ḥasa</i>],</b> i.e., Antoninus should have mercy [<i>ḥas</i>] on her.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates: <b>Every day</b> Antoninus <b>would send to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>crushed gold in large sacks, with wheat in the opening of</b> the sacks. <b>He</b> would <b>say to</b> his servants: <b>Bring</b> this <b>wheat to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, and they did not realize that the bags actually contained gold. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> Antoninus: <b>I do not need</b> gold, as <b>I have plenty.</b> Antoninus <b>said:</b> The gold <b>should be for those who will come after you, who will give it to the last ones who come after you. And those who descend from them will bring forth</b> the gold that I now give you, and will be able to pay taxes to the Romans from this money.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates anther anecdote involving Antoninus. Antoninus <b>had a certain</b> underground <b>cave</b> from which there was a tunnel <b>that went from his house to the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Every day he would bring two servants</b> to serve him. <b>He would kill one at the entrance of the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and would kill</b> the other <b>one at the entrance of his house,</b> so that no living person would know that he had visited Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. <b>He said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>When I come</b> to visit, <b>let no man be found before you.</b>

### Part 5
<b>One day,</b> Antoninus <b>found that Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥama was sitting</b> there. <b>He said: Did I not tell you</b> that <b>when I come</b> to visit, <b>let no man be found before you?</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: This is not a human being;</b> he is like an angel, and you have nothing to fear from him. Antoninus <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥama: <b>Tell that servant who is sleeping at the entrance that he should rise and come.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥama went</b> and <b>found that</b> the servant Antoninus referred to <b>had been killed. He said</b> to himself: <b>How shall I act? If I go and tell</b> Antoninus <b>that he was killed,</b> this is problematic, as one should <b>not report distressing</b> news. If <b>I leave him and go,</b> then I would be <b>treating the king with disrespect. He prayed for</b> God to have <b>mercy and revived</b> the servant, <b>and he sent him</b> to Antoninus. Antoninus <b>said: I know</b> that even <b>the least among you</b> can <b>revive the dead; but when I come</b> to visit <b>let no man be found before you,</b> even one as great as Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥama.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates: <b>Every day</b> Antoninus <b>would minister to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi; <b>he would feed him</b> and <b>give him to drink. When Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>wanted to ascend to his bed,</b> Antoninus <b>would bend down in front of the bed</b> and <b>say to him: Ascend upon me to your bed.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> in response: It is <b>not proper conduct to treat the king with this much disrespect.</b> Antoninus <b>said: Oh, that I were set as a mattress under you in the World-to-Come!</b>

### Part 8
On another occasion, Antoninus <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: Will <b>I enter the World-to-Come?</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Antoninus <b>said to him: But isn’t it written: “And there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau”</b> (Obadiah 1:18)? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi answered: The verse is stated <b>with regard to</b> those who <b>perform actions</b> similar to those <b>of</b> the wicked <b>Esau,</b> not to people like you.

### Part 9
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the verse: <b>“And there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that this applies <b>to everyone</b> descended from Esau, irrespective of an individual’s actions. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of the house of Esau,”</b> to indicate that the verse is stated only <b>with regard to</b> those who continue in the way of Esau, and <b>perform actions</b> similar to those <b>of Esau.</b>

### Part 10
Antoninus <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>But isn’t it written</b> in the description of the netherworld: <b>“There is Edom, her kings and all her leaders”</b> (Ezekiel 32:29)? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him:</b> The verse states: <b>“Her kings,” but not: All of her kings,</b> and likewise it states: <b>“All her leaders,” but not: All of her officers.</b> Some of them will merit the World-to-Come.

### Part 11
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Her kings,” but not: All of her kings,</b> and: <b>“All her leaders,” but not: All of her officers.</b> The inference learned from the wording of the verse: <b>“Her kings,” but not: All of her kings,</b> serves <b>to exclude Antoninus the son of Asveirus;</b> and the inference from the wording: <b>“All her leaders,” but not: All of her officers,</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> the Roman officer <b>Ketia, son of Shalom.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What is it</b> that occurred involving <b>Ketia, son of Shalom? As there was a certain</b> Roman <b>emperor who hated the Jews. He said to the important</b> members <b>of the kingdom:</b> If <b>one had an ulcerous sore [<i>nima</i>] rise on his foot, should he cut it off and live, or leave it and suffer? They said to him: He should cut it off and live.</b> The ulcerous sore was a metaphor for the Jewish people, whom the emperor sought to eliminate as the cause of harm for the Roman Empire.

### Part 13
<b>Ketia, son of Shalom, said to them:</b> It is unwise to do so, for two reasons. <b>One</b> is <b>that you cannot</b> destroy <b>all of them, as it is written: “For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven,</b> says the Lord” (Zechariah 2:10). He clarified: <b>What is it saying? Shall we say that</b> the verse means that God has <b>scattered them to the four winds</b> of the world? If so, <b>this</b> phrase: <b>“As the four winds,”</b> is inaccurate, since <b>it should have</b> said: <b>To the four winds. Rather,</b> this is what the verse is saying: <b>Just as the world cannot</b> exist <b>without winds, so too, the world cannot</b> exist <b>without the Jewish people,</b> and they will never be destroyed. <b>And furthermore,</b> if you attempt to carry out the destruction of the Jews, <b>they will call you the severed kingdom,</b> as the Roman Empire would be devoid of Jews, but Jews would exist in other locations.

### Part 14
The emperor <b>said to</b> Ketia: <b>You have spoken well</b> and your statement is correct; <b>but they throw anyone who defeats the king</b> in argument <b>into a house full of ashes [<i>lekamonya ḥalila</i>],</b> where he would die. <b>When they were seizing</b> Ketia <b>and going</b> to take him to his death, <b>a certain matron [<i>matronita</i>] said to him: Woe to the ship that goes without</b> paying the <b>tax.</b> Ketia <b>bent down over his foreskin, severed it,</b> and <b>said: I gave my tax; I</b> will <b>pass and enter. When they threw him</b> into the house of ashes, <b>he said: All of my property</b> is given <b>to Rabbi Akiva and his colleagues.</b> How was this inheritance to be divided? The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Akiva went out and taught</b> that the verse: <b>“And it shall be for Aaron and his sons”</b> (Exodus 29:28), means <b>half to Aaron and half to his sons.</b> Here too, as Rabbi Akiva is mentioned separately, he should receive half, while his colleagues receive the other half.

### Part 15
The Gemara returns to the story of Ketia. <b>A Divine Voice emerged and said: Ketia, son of Shalom, is destined for life in the World-to-Come.</b> When <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi heard this, <b>he wept, saying: There is</b> one who <b>acquires his</b> share in the <b>World</b>-to-Come <b>in one moment, and there is</b> one who <b>acquires his</b> share in the <b>World</b>-to-Come only <b>after many years</b> of toil.

### Part 16
The Gemara relates: <b>Antoninus would attend to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, and similarly the Persian king <b>Adrakan would attend to Rav. When Antoninus died, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: The bundle is separated. When Adrakan died, Rav</b> likewise <b>said:</b>
