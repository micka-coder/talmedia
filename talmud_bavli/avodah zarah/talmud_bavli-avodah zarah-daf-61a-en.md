### Part 1
Rav Ashi replied: <b>There,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the barrel is not actually thrown. Rather, <b>it is propelled by</b> the gentile, <b>and</b> again propelled <b>by him,</b> until it reaches the vat. Therefore, if the gentile did so not in anger, there is reason to be concerned that he might have touched the wine.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a Jew <b>who renders the wine of a gentile permitted</b> by treading the gentile’s grapes so that the wine can be sold to Jews, <b>and</b> although a Jew has not yet paid for the wine <b>he</b> then <b>places</b> the wine <b>in</b> the gentile’s <b>domain in a house that is open to a public thoroughfare</b> until he sells it, the <i>halakha</i> depends on the circumstances. If this occurs <b>in a city in which there are</b> both <b>gentiles and Jews,</b> the wine is <b>permitted,</b> as the gentile does not touch the wine lest the Jews see him doing so. If this occurs <b>in a city</b> in <b>which all its</b> inhabitants are <b>gentiles,</b> the wine is <b>prohibited unless</b> a Jew <b>sits and safeguards</b> the wine.

### Part 3
<b>But the watchman is not required to sit and guard</b> the wine constantly; <b>even if he</b> frequently <b>leaves</b> the place <b>and comes in</b> again later, the wine is <b>permitted. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> The <b>domain of gentiles is</b> all <b>one,</b> as the Gemara will explain.

### Part 4
In the case of a Jew <b>who renders the wine of a gentile permitted</b> by treading the gentile’s grapes so that the wine can be sold to Jews, <b>and he</b> then <b>places</b> the wine <b>in</b> the gentile’s <b>domain</b> until he sells it, the <i>halakha</i> depends on the circumstances. If <b>that one,</b> the gentile, <b>writes for</b> the Jew: <b>I received money from you</b> in payment for the wine, even though he did not yet receive the actual payment, the wine is <b>permitted.</b> This is because the wine is considered the Jew’s property and the gentile does not venture to touch it. <b>But if the Jew desires to remove</b> the wine <b>and</b> the gentile <b>does not allow him</b> to do so <b>until</b> the Jew <b>gives him the money</b> due to <b>him, this was an incident</b> that occurred <b>in Beit She’an and</b> the Sages <b>deemed</b> the wine <b>prohibited.</b> In this case the gentile believes that he has a lien upon the wine, and therefore he has no compunctions about touching it.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara questions the mishna’s distinction between a city with Jewish inhabitants and a city without Jewish inhabitants: The wine should <b>also</b> be permitted <b>in a city</b> in <b>which all its</b> inhabitants are <b>gentiles,</b> as <b>aren’t there</b> Jewish <b>peddlers who travel around the</b> various <b>towns?</b> Consequently, the gentile refrains from touching the wine, lest the Jewish peddlers see him touching it. <b>Shmuel says:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to a city that has double doors and a crossbar,</b> and the residents know when outsiders enter the city.

### Part 6
With regard to the mishna’s statement that the wine is permitted only if the gentile’s house is open to a public thoroughfare, <b>Rav Yosef says: And</b> if a Jew’s <b>window</b> is open to that place it is <b>considered like a public thoroughfare. And</b> similarly, <b>a trash heap</b> is <b>considered like a public thoroughfare</b> as many people frequent it, <b>and a palm tree</b> is <b>considered like a public thoroughfare,</b> as the gentile is concerned lest someone climbing the palm tree see him.

### Part 7
<b>With regard to</b> a case where <b>the top</b> of the palm tree <b>was cut off, Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree: One</b> of them <b>deems</b> the wine <b>prohibited and one</b> of them <b>deems</b> it <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>The one who deems</b> the wine <b>prohibited</b> holds that since no fruit grows on the palm tree, <b>why would</b> someone <b>climb up there?</b> The gentile therefore has no reason for concern lest someone see him, and he has no compunctions about touching the wine. <b>And the one who deems</b> the wine <b>permitted</b> holds that it happens on <b>occasion that</b> someone <b>loses an animal and he climbs up</b> the palm tree <b>to look for it.</b> The gentile is therefore concerned lest someone climbing the palm tree see him, and he does not touch the wine.

### Part 8
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> In the case of a Jew <b>who purchases</b> a house <b>or one who rents a house in a gentile’s courtyard, and</b> a Jew <b>filled</b> the house with barrels of <b>wine,</b> if another <b>Jew dwells in the same courtyard,</b> the wine is <b>permitted.</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even if</b> that Jew does <b>not</b> have <b>in his possession</b> the <b>key</b> to the house <b>or a seal</b> on the barrels of wine.
