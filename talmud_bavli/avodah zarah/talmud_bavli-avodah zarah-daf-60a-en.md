### Part 1
<b>but the other</b> wine in the barrel <b>is permitted. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Pappa said: The wine until the stopper,</b> i.e., in the upper portion of the barrel, is <b>prohibited, but the other</b> wine in the barrel, below the stopper, is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yeimar says:</b> Rav Pappa’s ruling is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as the mishna teaches (<i>Tevul Yom</i> 2:7): In the case of <b>a barrel that was pierced, whether on its top, on its bottom, or on</b> one of <b>its sides,</b> if <b>one who immersed that day touched it,</b> it is <b>ritually impure. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If it was pierced <b>on its top or on its bottom,</b> it is <b>impure.</b> If it was pierced <b>on</b> one of <b>its sides,</b> the wine is <b>pure,</b> whether it was touched <b>from here or from there,</b> i.e., on either side. Only the wine that he touched is rendered impure. According to the first version of Rav Pappa’s statement he holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.

### Part 3
§ <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> In a case where <b>a gentile</b> is pouring the wine from <b>the barrel and a Jew</b> is holding <b>the beaker [<i>kuva</i>]</b> into which it is poured, <b>the wine</b> is <b>prohibited. What is the reason? When</b> the wine <b>comes</b> out of the barrel, <b>it comes</b> out <b>by force of the gentile’s</b> action. In a case where <b>a Jew</b> is pouring the wine from <b>the barrel and a gentile</b> is holding <b>the beaker</b> into which it is poured, <b>the wine</b> is <b>permitted. But if</b> the gentile <b>tilts</b> the beaker <b>to the side,</b> the wine is <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> In the case of <b>this gentile who carries</b> a sealed <b>wineskin and a Jew is walking behind him</b> and ensuring that the gentile does not touch the wine itself, the <i>halakha</i> depends on the circumstances. If the wineskin is <b>full,</b> the wine is <b>permitted, as</b> the wine in the wineskin <b>is not shaken.</b> If the wineskin is <b>incompletely</b> filled, the wine is <b>prohibited,</b> as <b>perhaps</b> the wine in the wineskin might have been <b>shaken</b> by the gentile, which would have the same <i>halakha</i> as wine poured as a libation. In the case of <b>a beaker,</b> which is open on top, if it is <b>full</b> the wine is <b>prohibited,</b> as <b>perhaps</b> the gentile might have <b>touched</b> the wine. If the beaker is <b>incompletely</b> filled, the wine is <b>permitted, as</b> the gentile <b>did not touch</b> the wine.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Ashi says:</b> In the case of <b>a wineskin, whether</b> it is <b>full or incompletely</b> filled it is <b>permitted. What is the reason</b> that the wine is permitted even if it is shaken within the wineskin? It is because <b>this is not the</b> typical <b>manner of offering a libation.</b>

### Part 6
§ With regard to <b>a winepress</b> where the grapes are pressed with beams, rather than trod by foot, <b>Rav Pappi deemed permitted</b> wine that is produced by a gentile, as the gentile does not touch the wine. <b>Rav Ashi, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi, deemed</b> the wine <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara comments: <b>In</b> a case where the wine is pressed by means of the gentile’s direct <b>force everyone agrees that</b> the wine is <b>prohibited. They disagree when</b> the wine is pressed by means of <b>a force</b> generated <b>by his force.</b> Conversely, <b>there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>in</b> a case where the wine is pressed <b>by</b> means of <b>a force</b> generated <b>by</b> the gentile’s <b>force everyone agrees that</b> the wine is <b>permitted. They disagree when</b> the wine is pressed by means of the gentile’s direct <b>force.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>There was an incident in</b> which wine was pressed by means of <b>a force</b> generated <b>by</b> the gentile’s <b>force, and Rav Yaakov from Nehar Pekod deemed</b> the wine <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 8
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain barrel</b>
