### Part 1
even if they are found <b>in the marketplace,</b> are <b>ritually impure. But some say</b> that they are <b>ritually pure.</b> With regard to <b>their wine,</b> the <b>adults render</b> the wine that they touch <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation,</b> but the <b>minors do not render</b> the wine that they touch <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation. Which</b> slaves <b>are</b> considered <b>adults, and which</b> slaves <b>are</b> considered <b>minors?</b> The <b>adults</b> are those <b>who know</b> the <b>nature of idol worship and its accessories,</b> and the <b>minors</b> are those <b>who do not know</b> the <b>nature of idol worship and its accessories.</b>

### Part 2
<b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that with regard to those slaves who <b>were circumcised but did not immerse, yes,</b> the wine they touch is prohibited, but with regard to those who were <b>circumcised and immersed, no,</b> the wine they touch is not prohibited, even if they have not yet forgotten their idolatrous worship. The Gemara replies: <b>Interpret</b> this <i>halakha</i> as referring only <b>to</b> the <b>sons of maidservants</b> who were raised in a Jewish home and never engaged in idolatrous worship, but not to slaves who were acquired from gentiles.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>Doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> that the <i>halakha</i> applies to slaves purchased from gentiles <b>and also</b> to the sons of gentile maidservants, indicating that there is no differentiation between them? The Gemara replies: The <i>baraita</i> equates the two cases only <b>with regard to</b> the impurity of <b>their spittle and</b> of the <b>objects upon which they tread.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that their spittle and the objects upon which they tread are <b>impure. But according to the one who says</b> that they are <b>pure, what can be said?</b> If the spittle of the slaves and the objects upon which they tread are pure, clearly the same <i>halakha</i> applies in the case of the sons of maidservants, and it is unnecessary to state this. One may therefore conclude that the <i>baraita</i> equated the two cases with regard to the status of the wine that they touch.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: Even if the <i>baraita</i> equates the slaves and the sons of maidservants with regard to the status of their wine, it does not intend to compare their status once they have immersed. Rather, <b>this teaches us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>slaves</b> is <b>similar to</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>sons of maidservants. Just as</b> in the case of the <b>sons of maidservants, it is</b> only the <b>adults who render</b> the wine that they touch <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation,</b> but <b>minors do not render</b> the wine they touch <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation, so too</b> in the case of <b>slaves,</b> the <b>adults render</b> the wine that they touch <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation,</b> but <b>minors do not render</b> the wine they touch <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation.</b>

### Part 6
This <i>halakha</i> is <b>to the exclusion of that which Rav</b> says, <b>as Rav says:</b> If a gentile <b>baby</b> who is <b>one day old</b> touches wine, <b>he renders</b> it <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation.</b> The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> this is <b>not</b> the case.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara relates: <b>There was a certain incident in Meḥoza</b> in which <b>a gentile came</b> and <b>entered the store of a Jew.</b> The gentile <b>said to</b> the owners: <b>Do you have</b> any <b>wine to sell? They said to him: No. There was wine sitting in a bucket.</b> The gentile <b>put his hand in it</b> and <b>stirred</b> the wine around. The gentile <b>said to them: This, is it not wine? The other</b> person, i.e., the storeowner, <b>took</b> the bucket and, <b>in his anger, threw its</b> contents <b>into a barrel</b> of wine.

### Part 8
This incident raised a dilemma with regard to the status of the wine in the barrel. <b>Rava permitted</b> the owner <b>to sell</b> the wine <b>to gentiles,</b> as he held that it is permitted to derive benefit from the wine. <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana and Rav Huna, son of Rav Naḥman, disagreed with him.</b> Blasts of <b><i>shofarot</i> went out</b> from the court <b>of Rava</b> promulgating his ruling, <b>and they permitted</b> the sale. <b>And</b> blasts of <b><i>shofarot</i> went out</b> from the court <b>of Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana and Rav Huna, son of Rav Naḥman,</b> promulgating their ruling, <b>and they prohibited</b> the sale.
