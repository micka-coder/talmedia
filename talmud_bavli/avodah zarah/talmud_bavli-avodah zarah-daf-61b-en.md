### Part 1
If a Jew dwells only <b>in another courtyard,</b> the wine is also <b>permitted, but this is</b> only <b>when</b> the Jew has the <b>key</b> to the house <b>or a seal</b> on the barrels of wine <b>in his possession,</b> as this prevents the gentile from gaining access to the wine.

### Part 2
In the case of a Jew <b>who renders the wine of a gentile permitted,</b> and the wine is <b>in</b> the gentile’s <b>domain,</b> if another <b>Jew dwells in the same courtyard,</b> the wine is <b>permitted, but this is</b> only <b>when</b> the Jew has the <b>key</b> to the house <b>or a seal</b> on the barrels of wine <b>in his possession. Rabbi Yoḥanan said to the <i>tanna</i></b> reciting the <i>baraita</i>: In this case you should <b>teach</b> that <b>even if</b> that Jew does <b>not</b> have <b>in his possession</b> the <b>key</b> to the house <b>or a seal</b> on the barrels of wine, the wine is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 3
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If the second Jew dwells only <b>in another courtyard,</b> the wine is <b>prohibited, even when</b> that Jew has the <b>key</b> to the house <b>or a seal</b> on the barrels of wine <b>in his possession.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And the Rabbis deem</b> the wine <b>prohibited, unless a watchman is sitting and safeguarding</b> the wine constantly, <b>or unless an appointed</b> person <b>comes</b> to safeguard the wine. This is referring to a watchman <b>who comes at set times.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>To which</b> case in the <i>baraita</i> are <b>the Rabbis</b> referring? <b>If we say</b> that they are referring <b>to the last clause,</b> this is difficult, as in that case <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>also deems</b> the wine <b>prohibited. Rather,</b> perhaps they are referring <b>to the first clause of the last clause,</b> with regard to a case where a Jew renders a gentile’s wine permitted and another Jew dwells in the same courtyard. <b>But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say to the <i>tanna</i></b> reciting the <i>baraita</i>: You should <b>teach</b> that <b>even if</b> the Jew does <b>not</b> have <b>in his possession</b> the <b>key</b> to the house <b>or a seal</b> on the barrels of wine, the wine is permitted? It may be assumed that Rabbi Yoḥanan does not disagree with the opinion of the Rabbis.

### Part 6
<b>Rather,</b> the Rabbis are referring <b>to the last clause of the first clause,</b> with regard to a Jew’s wine that was placed in a house in a gentile’s courtyard, <b>as the first <i>tanna</i> says:</b> If a Jew dwells only <b>in another courtyard,</b> the wine is <b>permitted, but this is</b> only <b>when</b> the Jew has <b>in his possession</b> the <b>key</b> to the house <b>or a seal</b> on the barrels of wine. <b>And the Rabbis say: It is always prohibited unless a watchman is sitting and safeguarding</b> the wine constantly, <b>or unless an appointed</b> person <b>comes</b> to safeguard the wine. This is referring to a watchman <b>who comes at set times.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara questions this ruling: If <b>an appointed</b> person <b>comes at set times, it is detrimental,</b> as the gentile knows when to expect the watchman, and he may do as he pleases the rest of the time. <b>Rather,</b> emend the <i>baraita</i> and teach that the wine is prohibited <b>unless an appointed</b> person <b>comes,</b> and this is referring to a watchman <b>who does not come at set times.</b> Rather, he comes whenever he chooses to do so.

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches that if a Jew renders the wine of a gentile permitted and leaves the wine in the gentile’s domain, the wine is prohibited unless a Jew guards the wine. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> The <b>domain of gentiles is</b> all <b>one. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> come <b>to be lenient or to be stringent? Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Ze’eiri says:</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar came <b>to be lenient. Rav Naḥman</b> says that <b>Ze’eiri says:</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar came <b>to be stringent.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Ze’eiri says</b> that Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar came <b>to be lenient, and</b> accordingly, <b>this</b> is what <b>the first <i>tanna</i> is saying: Just as</b> the wine is <b>prohibited when</b> it is left <b>in</b> the gentile owner’s <b>domain, so too</b> the wine is <b>prohibited</b> when it is left <b>in the domain of another gentile,</b> as the bailee might allow the owner to touch the wine. <b>And we are concerned</b> that they might be <b>in collusion</b> and the bailee will not reveal that the gentile owner touched the wine, as the owner reciprocates on other occasions.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says</b> that not all the domains of gentiles are considered as one. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that the wine is prohibited <b>said?</b> This applies only when the wine is left <b>in</b> the gentile owner’s <b>domain. But</b> when it is left <b>in the domain of another gentile</b> the wine is <b>permitted,</b> as the gentile refrains from touching the wine when it is in the domain of another gentile, as his actions might become known. <b>And we are not concerned</b> that the two gentiles might be <b>in collusion.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara explains the other opinion. <b>Rav Naḥman</b> says that <b>Ze’eiri says:</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar came <b>to be stringent, and</b> accordingly, <b>this</b> is what <b>the first <i>tanna</i> is saying: In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that the wine is prohibited <b>said?</b> This applies only when the wine is left <b>in</b> the gentile owner’s <b>domain. But</b> when it is left <b>in the domain of another gentile</b> the wine is <b>permitted,</b> as the gentile refrains from touching the wine when it is in the domain of another gentile, <b>and we are not concerned</b> that the two gentiles might be <b>in collusion.</b> Conversely, <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> The <b>domain of gentiles is all one,</b> and the wine is prohibited, as it is possible that the gentile bailee is in collusion with the owner.

### Part 12
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman,</b> who says that <b>Ze’eiri says</b> that Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar came <b>to be stringent: Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said:</b> The <b>domain of gentiles is all one, due to the swindlers.</b> This indicates that Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar is presenting a more stringent opinion.

### Part 13
The Gemara relates that men <b>from the house of Parzak the vizier placed wine</b> that had been rendered permitted by Jews who had not yet paid for it <b>in</b> the domain of <b>their</b> gentile <b>sharecroppers. The Rabbis</b> who were studying <b>before Rava thought to say: When are we concerned</b> that two gentiles might be <b>in collusion? This matter</b> applies only in a case <b>where this</b> gentile <b>places</b> items <b>in</b> the domain of <b>that</b> gentile, and vice versa. <b>But here, since</b> the vizier’s <b>sharecroppers are not accustomed to place</b> items in <b>the house of Parzak the vizier, we are not concerned</b> that two gentiles might be <b>in collusion.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rava said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>On the contrary, even according to the one who says</b> that <b>we are not concerned</b> that two gentiles might be <b>in collusion, that statement</b> applies only <b>where</b> the other gentile <b>is not afraid of</b> the wine’s owner. <b>But here, since</b> the sharecropper is <b>afraid of</b> the vizier, <b>he covers up for him</b> and testifies on his <b>behalf</b> that he did not touch the wine.

### Part 15
There was <b>a certain city in which a Jew’s wine was placed. A gentile was found standing among the barrels</b> of wine. <b>Rava said: If</b> the gentile <b>can be caught as a thief</b>  if he touches the wine, the <b>wine is permitted.</b> Since he is afraid of being caught he does not have the presence of mind to offer the wine as a libation. <b>But if not,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> even to derive benefit from the wine, as it is assumed that the gentile certainly touched it and offered it as a libation.
