<b>and one may not lower</b> them into a pit. <b>But the heretics, and the informers, and the apostates [<i>vehameshummadim</i>] are lowered</b> into a pit, <b>but not raised</b> out of it.

### Part 2
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abbahu: <b>I teach</b> that the verse: “And so you shall do <b>with every lost item of your brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3), serves <b>to include the apostate</b> in one’s obligation to return a lost item to another Jew; <b>and you say</b> that <b>one may lower</b> him into a pit? <b>Remove</b> the term <b>apostate from here.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>answer</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan as follows: <b>Here,</b> with regard to a lost item, the verse includes an apostate because it is referring <b>to an apostate</b> who <b>eats non-kosher meat due to</b> his <b>appetite,</b> i.e., he succumbs to the temptation. Conversely, <b>there,</b> with regard to raising an apostate from a pit, I am referring to <b>an apostate</b> who <b>eats non-kosher meat to express insolence.</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Abbahu <b>holds</b> that one who <b>eats non-kosher meat to express insolence is a heretic,</b> rather than an apostate.

### Part 4
§ It <b>was stated</b> with regard to the definition of <b>an apostate</b> that <b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree. One says</b> that someone who transgresses a prohibition <b>due to</b> his <b>appetite</b> is <b>an apostate,</b> while one who transgresses a prohibition in order <b>to express insolence is a heretic. And one says</b> that <b>even</b> one who sins <b>to express insolence</b> is considered <b>an apostate. Rather, who is</b> considered <b>a heretic? This is an idol worshipper.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> against the opinion that one who sins to express insolence is considered a heretic. The <i>baraita</i> teaches: If <b>one ate a single flea or a single mosquito, he is</b> considered <b>an apostate.</b> The Gemara clarifies the objection: <b>But here</b> it must be assumed <b>that</b> the insect was eaten <b>to express insolence,</b> as it is unappetizing, <b>and</b> yet this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that one who eats a flea or a mosquito is <b>an apostate.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There, he desires to experience the taste of forbidden</b> food, and therefore he is considered to be eating only due to temptation.

### Part 6
§ The Gemara returns to the subject of lowering someone into a pit. <b>The Master said:</b> Heretics, informers, and apostates <b>are lowered</b> into a pit <b>but not raised</b> out of it. The Gemara analyzes this statement: <b>Now</b> that it is known that one actively <b>lowers</b> them into a pit, <b>is it necessary</b> to teach that one does not <b>raise</b> them from it? <b>Rav Yosef bar Ḥama said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> because it can be inferred from here <b>that if there was a ledge in the pit,</b> a Jew <b>scrapes it off</b> so that the one in the pit cannot ascend from it, <b>as</b> the Jew <b>employs a pretext and says</b> that he is removing the ledge so that <b>animals do not descend upon</b> the one in the pit while he is trapped in the pit.

### Part 7
<b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both say</b> a different answer: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this, as it can be inferred from here <b>that if there was a stone at the mouth of the well</b> that one had fallen into, a Jew <b>covers it</b> and <b>says</b> that he is covering the opening in order <b>to pass his animals over it. Ravina said:</b> One can learn from here <b>that if there was a ladder</b> in the pit, a Jew <b>removes it</b> and <b>says: I require</b> the ladder <b>to lower my son from the roof.</b>

### Part 8
§ The Gemara discusses the subject of assisting or receiving aid from a gentile in the context of circumcision. <b>The Sages taught: A Jew may circumcise a gentile for the sake of</b> making him <b>a convert.</b> This is <b>to the exclusion of</b> circumcising a gentile <b>for the sake of</b> removing <b>a worm [<i>murna</i>], which</b> is <b>not</b> permitted, as it is forbidden to heal a gentile. <b>But</b> one <b>may not</b> allow <b>a gentile</b> to <b>circumcise a Jew</b> in any situation, <b>because</b> gentiles <b>are suspected of bloodshed.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> One <b>may</b> allow <b>a gentile</b> to <b>circumcise a Jew while others are standing over him</b> and observing his actions, <b>but not</b> when they are <b>alone together. And Rabbi Meir says: Even</b> where <b>others are standing over him</b> it is <b>also not</b> permitted, <b>as</b> there are <b>times when</b> a gentile might <b>tilt the knife and render</b> the Jew <b>one whose penis has been severed,</b> and he will be unable to father children.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Meir hold</b> that one <b>may not</b> allow <b>a gentile</b> to circumcise a Jew? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> against this claim from the following <i>baraita</i>: In <b>a city in which there is no Jewish physician, and in which there is a Samaritan physician and an Aramean,</b> i.e., a gentile, <b>physician,</b> it is preferable that the <b>Aramean circumcise</b> the Jewish boys of the city <b>and</b> the <b>Samaritan not circumcise</b> them. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is preferable that the <b>Samaritan circumcise</b> the boys <b>and</b> the <b>Aramean not circumcise</b> them. Rabbi Meir holds that it is preferable for an Aramean gentile to perform circumcision despite the fact that Samaritans are considered Jewish to a certain extent.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> their opinions, so that <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> It is preferable that the <b>Samaritan circumcise</b> the boys <b>and not</b> the <b>Aramean,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is preferable that the <b>Aramean</b> circumcise them <b>and not</b> the <b>Samaritan.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yehuda hold</b> that it is <b>permitted</b> for circumcision to be performed by <b>an Aramean? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to circumcision</b> performed <b>by a gentile that</b> it <b>is not valid?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And God said to Abraham: <b>And as for you, you shall keep My covenant,</b> you, and your seed after you throughout their generations” (Genesis 17:9). “My covenant [<i>beriti</i>]” here is a reference to circumcision [<i>berit mila</i>], and therefore the verse is teaching that only Abraham and his descendants, i.e., Jews, are qualified to perform circumcision.

### Part 13
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara suggests, <b>actually do not reverse it.</b> As for the apparent contradiction between the two statements of Rabbi Meir, the Gemara explains: <b>And what are we dealing with here?</b>
