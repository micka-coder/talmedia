<b>but one may uproot</b> diverse kinds <b>with him, in order to reduce impropriety.</b>

### Part 2
The Sages initially <b>assumed</b> that in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that not only one who sows or grows diverse kinds, but even <b>one who maintains diverse kinds, is flogged. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who removes the weeds</b> interfering with the growth of the plants <b>or who covers up</b> the seeds <b>of diverse kinds</b> with earth <b>is flogged. Rabbi Akiva says: Even one who maintains</b> them instead of actively uprooting them is flogged.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Akiva?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states: “You shall not sow your field with diverse kinds of seed”</b> (Leviticus 19:19). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the case of <b>one who sows. From where</b> is it derived that <b>one who maintains</b> diverse kinds also receives lashes? <b>The verse states: “Not…diverse kinds of seed,”</b> indicating that there should not be diverse kinds in one’s field.

### Part 4
The Gemara concludes its support for the opinion of Rav Naḥman: It is prohibited to maintain diverse kinds, <b>but nevertheless,</b> if one wishes to maintain diverse kinds temporarily in order <b>to</b> be paid for uprooting them, thereby <b>reducing impropriety,</b> it is <b>permitted.</b> Similarly, it is permitted for one to receive payment for breaking barrels of wine used for a libation.

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>No,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which deems it permitted for one to uproot diverse kinds with a gentile? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who permit one to maintain diverse kinds, but prohibit one from maintaining wine used for a libation, so there is no proof from this <i>baraita</i> in support of Rav Naḥman’s opinion.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically</b> permit <b>uprooting</b> with a gentile? <b>Even maintaining</b> the diverse kinds is <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where he performed</b> the uprooting <b>unpaid, and it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>giving an unpaid gift to</b> a gentile is <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara reasons that Rav Naḥman’s ruling can in any event be proven from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>From</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda we may understand</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. Doesn’t Rabbi Yehuda say</b> that <b>it is prohibited to give</b> a gentile <b>an unpaid gift, but to reduce impropriety</b> he holds that it is <b>permitted</b> to work with a gentile? The same can be said <b>according to Rabbi Akiva as well: Although Rabbi Akiva says</b> that <b>one who maintains diverse kinds is flogged,</b> he presumably holds that if the purpose is <b>to reduce impropriety,</b> it is <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And nothing more</b> is to be said on this matter.

### Part 8
§ Rav Naḥman, Ulla, Avimi bar Pappi, and Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami <b>were sitting again and a dilemma was raised before them:</b> With regard to <b>the proceeds from</b> the sale of an object of <b>idol worship</b> that are <b>in the possession of a gentile,</b> who sold the object to another, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Does</b> the object of idol worship <b>transfer</b> its forbidden status <b>to the money</b> that is <b>in the possession of a gentile,</b> as it would to money in the possession of a Jew, <b>or not?</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Naḥman said to them: It stands to reason</b> that <b>the proceeds from</b> the sale of an object of <b>idol worship in the possession of a gentile are permitted.</b> This may be proven <b>from certain</b> gentiles <b>who came before Rabba bar Avuh</b> to convert. Rabba bar Avuh <b>said to them: Go sell everything that you have,</b> including your objects of idol worship, <b>and</b> then <b>come</b> back to me to <b>convert.</b>

### Part 10
<b>What is the reason</b> he gave this advice? Isn’t it <b>because he maintains</b> that <b>the proceeds from</b> the sale of an object of <b>idol worship in the possession of a gentile are permitted,</b> and therefore he suggested they sell the objects of idol worship so they could derive benefit from the money after they converted? The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But perhaps it is different there, as since</b> their <b>intention is to convert,</b> they <b>certainly revoked</b> the idolatrous status of these objects, and when they sold them they were selling permitted items.

### Part 11
<b>Rather,</b> proof may be brought <b>from here,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a Jew who was a creditor to a gentile</b> for the amount of <b>one hundred dinars, and</b> the gentile <b>sold</b> an object of <b>idol worship and</b> from the proceeds <b>brought him</b> the payment of the debt, or sold <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation and</b> from the proceeds <b>brought him</b> the payment of the debt, the money is <b>permitted. But if</b> the gentile <b>said to him: Wait for me until I sell</b> an object of <b>idol worship and</b> from the proceeds <b>I will bring you</b> the payment of the debt, or: Wait until I sell <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation and</b> from the proceeds <b>I will bring you</b> the payment of the debt, this money is <b>forbidden.</b> This proves that the proceeds of an object of idol worship in the possession of a gentile are permitted.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in <b>the first clause</b> that it is permitted, <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> that it is forbidden? <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> In <b>the latter clause</b> the proceeds are forbidden <b>because</b> the Jew <b>desires the preservation of</b> the object of idol worship or wine used for a libation, since he knows that the gentile must sell it in order to repay the debt.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And if he desires its preservation in a case like this, is</b> the money <b>forbidden? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 6:10): In the case of <b>a convert and a gentile who inherited from their gentile father,</b> the <b>convert can say to</b> his gentile brother: <b>You take</b> the objects of <b>idol worship and I</b> will take the <b>money,</b> or: <b>You take the wine</b> used for <b>a libation and I</b> will take the <b>produce;</b> but <b>if</b> they make this exchange <b>after</b> the property <b>came into the possession of the convert,</b> it is <b>forbidden.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rava bar Ulla said:</b> The ruling of the <b>mishna</b> is stated <b>with regard to</b> an object of <b>idol worship</b> whose value <b>can be distributed among its shards,</b> i.e., even if it were broken to pieces its value would remain, so the convert does not desire its preservation.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: This resolution <b>works out well</b> in the case of objects of <b>idol worship,</b> but with regard to <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation, what is there to say?</b> There is no situation in which the convert does not desire the preservation of the wine until the exchange. The Gemara answers: The ruling of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to Hadrianic earthenware</b> permeated with wine used for a libation. Since the wine can be extracted by soaking the earthenware in water, the convert does not desire that the vessel remain intact.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t he desire its preservation</b> in the sense <b>that it should not be stolen or lost? Rather, Rav Pappa said</b> that there is a different resolution: <b>You say</b> there is a difficulty from the case of <b>the inheritance of a convert? The inheritance of a convert is different, as the Sages were lenient with regard to it,</b> as a rabbinic <b>decree, lest he return to his corrupted</b> ways if it were prohibited for him to inherit property from his father. In the case of one who is not a convert and desires the preservation of an object of idol worship, it is prohibited for him to profit from it.
