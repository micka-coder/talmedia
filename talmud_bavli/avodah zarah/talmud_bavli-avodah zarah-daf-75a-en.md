### Part 1
<b>Rav says:</b> One must cleanse it <b>with water</b> first, <b>and the same</b> must be done <b>with ashes</b> subsequently, and <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says:</b> One must cleanse it <b>with ashes</b> first, <b>and the same</b> must be done <b>with water</b> subsequently. The Gemara comments: <b>And they do not disagree. This</b> statement, that it must be cleansed first with ashes and subsequently with water, was stated <b>with regard to a damp</b> winepress. <b>That</b> statement, that first it must be moistened with water and then cleansed with ashes, was stated <b>with regard to a dry</b> winepress.

### Part 2
A dispute <b>was stated</b> with regard to this matter: The Sages of <b>the school of Rav say in the name of Rav</b> that the cleansing process consists of <b>two</b> stages for a damp winepress, namely, ashes and water, and <b>three</b> stages for a dry winepress, namely, water, ashes, and water. <b>And Shmuel says</b> that it consists of <b>three</b> stages for a damp winepress, namely, ashes, water, and ashes, and <b>four</b> stages for a dry winepress, namely, water, ashes, water, and ashes.

### Part 3
<b>In Sura they taught</b> the dispute in <b>this</b> preceding manner, but <b>in Pumbedita they taught</b> it in the following manner: The Sages of <b>the school of Rav said in the name of Rav</b> that the cleansing process consists of <b>three</b> stages for a damp winepress, namely, ashes, water, and ashes, and <b>four</b> stages for a dry winepress, namely, water, ashes, water, and ashes. <b>And Shmuel says</b> that it consists of <b>four</b> stages for a damp winepress, namely, ashes, water, ashes, and water, and <b>five</b> stages for a dry winepress, namely, water, ashes, water, ashes, and water.

### Part 4
The Gemara comments with regard to the latter version of the dispute: <b>And they do not</b> actually <b>disagree.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Shmuel, <b>counts</b> the <b>last</b> rinsing with <b>water,</b> which is only in order to remove the ashes, <b>and</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>does not count</b> the <b>last</b> rinsing with <b>water.</b> Therefore Rav counts three and four stages, whereas Shmuel counts four and five.

### Part 5
§ The students <b>asked Rabbi Abbahu</b> with regard to a similar issue of cleansing a utensil from wine of gentiles: With regard to <b>those wicker nets [<i>gorgei</i>]</b> used to hold the grapes during the treading, <b>which belong to gentiles, what</b> is the way to cleanse them?

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said to them: You learned this</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one whose winepresses or olive presses were impure, and he wished to prepare</b> his grapes and olives <b>in</b> a state of <b>purity,</b> he must first cleanse the presses from the impure produce for which they were used. <b>He must rinse the planks</b> used as a frame in the winepress, <b>and the troughs, and the twigs</b> used as brooms in the winepress; <b>and he must cleanse the</b> pressing <b>baskets</b> with ashes and water if they were made <b>of palm leaves or of hemp [<i>bitzbutz</i>], or leave them dormant twelve months</b> if they were made <b>of bulrush or of reeds,</b> because these absorb more of the wine. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: He may leave them</b> dormant <b>from</b> one <b>wine-pressing</b> season <b>to</b> the next <b>wine-pressing</b> season, <b>or from</b> one <b>olive-pressing</b> season <b>to</b> the next <b>olive-pressing</b> season.

### Part 7
The Gemara interjects: <b>Isn’t this</b> opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel the same as that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> as twelve months pass from one wine-pressing season to the next? The Gemara responds: The difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to <b>early</b>-ripening grapes <b>and late</b>-ripening grapes. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel does not require a precise measure of twelve months, as the lapse between ripening seasons may be greater or less.

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yosei says: One who wishes to purify</b> the winepress or olive press <b>immediately</b> without waiting a year <b>can purge them by</b> pouring <b>boiling water</b> over them, <b>or scald them in water</b> used for cooking <b>olives. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Yosei: He can place them under a pipe whose water flows</b> constantly <b>or in a spring with rapid waters. And</b> for <b>how long</b> should he leave them there? He should leave them for <b>an interval</b> of time, as the Gemara will explain.

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>In the</b> same <b>way that</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> these cleansing instructions <b>with regard to</b> a winepress used for <b>libation wine, so they stated</b> these instructions <b>with regard to matters of purity.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks with regard to this last clause: <b>Isn’t it the opposite? We are dealing</b> in this <i>baraita</i> <b>with matters of purity,</b> not with the matter of wine used for a libation. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should be emended: <b>In the</b> same <b>way that</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> this <b>with regard to matters of purity, so they stated</b> this <b>with regard to libation wine.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>How long is an interval</b> of time? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>either</b> an entire <b>day or</b> an entire <b>night. Rabbi Ḥana Sha’ina, and some say Rabbi Ḥana bar Sha’ina,</b> says that <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>half a day and half a night.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak says: And they do not disagree. This</b> statement, that it is either a day or a night, is referring <b>to the season of Nisan or Tishrei,</b> i.e., the fall or spring, when the day and the night are of equal length, and <b>that</b> statement, that it is half a day and half a night, is referring <b>to the season of Tammuz or Tevet,</b> i.e., the summer or winter, when they are not equal, and so twelve hours are measured by half the day and half the night.

### Part 13
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> In order to cleanse <b>those gentiles’ straining bags [<i>ravukei</i>],</b> which are used for straining yeast from wine, with regard to those made <b>of hair,</b> which is not absorbent, one may <b>rinse them.</b> With regard to those made <b>of wool,</b> one must <b>cleanse them</b> with ashes and water. With regard to those made <b>of flax,</b> which is more absorbent, one must <b>leave them dormant. And if there are knots,</b> one must <b>undo them.</b> In order to cleanse <b>those gentiles’ baskets and strainers,</b> with regard to those <b>that are plaited from palm strips,</b> one may <b>rinse them.</b>
