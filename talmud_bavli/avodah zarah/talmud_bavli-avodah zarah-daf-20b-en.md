### Part 1
<b>and</b> a person should <b>not</b> gaze upon <b>the colored garments of a woman; and</b> a person should <b>not</b> gaze <b>at a male donkey, at a female donkey, at a pig, at a sow, or at fowl, when they are mating; and even</b> if one were <b>full of eyes like the Angel of Death</b> and saw from every direction, it is not permitted to look.

### Part 2
<b>They said about the Angel of Death that he is entirely full of eyes. When a sick person is</b> about to <b>die,</b> the Angel of Death <b>stands above his head, with his sword drawn in his hand, and a drop of poison hanging on</b> the edge of the sword. <b>Once the sick person sees him, he trembles and</b> thereby <b>opens his mouth; and</b> the Angel of Death <b>throws</b> the drop of poison <b>into his mouth. From</b> this drop of poison the sick person <b>dies, from it he putrefies, from it his face becomes green.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: Rabban Gamliel did not intentionally look at the woman; rather, he <b>was</b> walking around <b>a corner</b> and he saw her unexpectedly as they each turned.

### Part 4
With regard to the statement in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Nor</b> may one gaze <b>at the colored garments of a woman, Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if <b>they are spread on a wall,</b> not only when they are being worn. <b>Rav Pappa says: And</b> the prohibition applies only <b>when one knows their owner. Rava said:</b> The language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise, as it teaches: Nor</b> may one gaze <b>at the colored garments of a woman, and it does not teach: Nor</b> may one gaze <b>at colored garments. Learn from it</b> that the prohibition applies only to the garments of one he knows.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: That statement</b> applies only <b>in</b> the case of <b>old</b> garments, i.e., garments that have been worn; <b>but in</b> the case of <b>new</b> garments, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b> The reason is <b>that if you do not say so, how can we give</b> a woman’s <b>garment</b> before it is worn <b>to a launderer,</b> i.e., one who prepares new garments for use, knowing that the launderer must <b>look</b> at the garments?

### Part 6
The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>But according to your reasoning,</b> i.e., your assumption that a launderer is no different from all other men, there is a similar difficulty with <b>that which Rav Yehuda says:</b> If one wishes to mate an animal of one <b>species with</b> an animal of <b>its own species,</b> it is <b>permitted to insert</b> the male organ into the female <b>like a brush into a tube.</b> One could ask here as well: <b>But isn’t he looking</b> at the animals as they mate? <b>Rather, he is occupied with his work,</b> and therefore his mind will not entertain sinful thoughts. <b>So too</b> with regard to a launderer, <b>he is occupied with his work,</b> and therefore a launderer differs from other men.

### Part 7
§ <b>The Master said</b> above in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>From</b> this drop of poison on the Angel of Death’s sword, the sick person <b>dies.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that this opinion <b>disagrees</b> with a statement <b>of Shmuel’s father? As Shmuel’s father says: The Angel of Death said to me: Were I not concerned for human dignity, I would uncover the place of the</b> incision of the <b>slaughter, as</b> one does to <b>an animal</b> that is slaughtered. This indicates that the Angel of Death kills by slaughtering his victims with his sword, not by poisoning them. The Gemara answers: <b>Perhaps that drop</b> of poison <b>cuts the two organs that must be severed in ritual slaughter,</b> i.e., the trachea and the esophagus, and thereby slaughters people.

### Part 8
The Gemara notes that the continuation of the <i>baraita</i>, which states that <b>from</b> this drop of poison a corpse <b>putrefies, supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana. As Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana says</b> that <b>they say in the school of Rav: One who wishes that his dead</b> relative <b>will not putrefy should turn it on its face</b> immediately, as the drop of poison enters through the mouth, and this causes the putrefaction of the corpse.

### Part 9
§ The Gemara cites another source that interprets the verse cited above. <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> explaining the verse: <b>“And you shall keep yourself from every evil thing”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:10), which is immediately followed by the verse: “If there be among you any man who is not ritually pure by reason of that which happened to him by night” (Deuteronomy 23:11). This teaches <b>that a person should not think</b> impure thoughts <b>by day and</b> thereby <b>come to</b> the <b>impurity</b> of an emission <b>by night.</b>

### Part 10
<b>From here Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir</b> would <b>say: Torah</b> study <b>leads to care</b> in the performance of mitzvot. <b>Care</b> in the performance of mitzvot <b>leads to diligence</b> in their observance. <b>Diligence leads to cleanliness</b> of the soul. <b>Cleanliness</b> of the soul <b>leads to abstention</b> from all evil. <b>Abstention</b> from evil <b>leads to purity</b> and the elimination of all base desires. <b>Purity leads to piety. Piety leads to humility. Humility leads to fear of sin. Fear of sin leads to holiness. Holiness leads to the Divine Spirit. The Divine Spirit leads to the resurrection of the dead. And piety is greater than all of them, as it is stated: “Then You did speak in a vision to Your pious ones”</b> (Psalms 89:20).

### Part 11
<b>And</b> this statement <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Humility is greater than all of them, as it is stated: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord has anointed me to bring good tidings to the humble”</b> (Isaiah 61:1). Since <b>the pious is not stated,</b> but <b>rather “the humble,” you learn that humility is greater than all of them.</b>

### Part 12
§ The mishna teaches that <b>one may not sell to</b> a gentile any item that is attached to the ground. <b>The Sages taught: One may sell to them a tree on the condition that he cut</b> it <b>down, and</b> the buyer <b>cuts</b> it <b>down;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says: One may sell to them only</b> a tree that has actually been <b>cut down.</b> Similarly, one may sell to them <b>fodder,</b> i.e., produce that has grown stalks but is not yet ripe, <b>on the condition to cut</b> it <b>down, and he cuts</b> it <b>down;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says: One may sell to them only</b> fodder that has been <b>cut down.</b> So too, one may sell to them <b>standing grain on the condition to harvest</b> it, <b>and he harvests</b> it; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says: One may sell to them only harvested</b> grain.

### Part 13
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state the <i>halakha</i> in each of these different scenarios. <b>As, had</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught us</b> the dispute only with regard to <b>a tree,</b> I might have said that it is only <b>in that</b> case that <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> it must be cut down before being sold. The reason is that <b>since</b> the gentile <b>does not lose out</b> by keeping the tree in the soil, he might <b>keep it</b> in the ground. <b>But</b> in <b>this</b> case of standing grain, <b>since</b> if <b>he keeps it</b> in the ground <b>he will lose out,</b> one might <b>say</b> that Rabbi Meir <b>concedes to Rabbi Yehuda</b> that it may be sold before being harvested, on the condition that the gentile will harvest it, because the gentile would not leave the grain in the soil to spoil.

### Part 14
<b>And had</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught us</b> only <b>these two</b> <i>halakhot</i>, one might have said that Rabbi Yehuda permits selling these items on the condition that they be cut down <b>because the improvement</b> to the tree or grain <b>is not recognizable</b> when it is left in the ground. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>fodder, whose improvement is recognizable,</b> as it would continue to grow and ripen if left in the ground, one might <b>say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>concedes to Rabbi Meir</b> that we are concerned that the gentile will not cut down the fodder, and therefore one may sell it only once it has been cut down.

### Part 15
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>had</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught us</b> only the dispute <b>in this</b> case of fodder, one might have said that it is merely <b>in this</b> case that <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> it must be cut down before being sold, <b>but with regard to those</b> cases of a tree or standing grain, one might <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to Rabbi Yehuda</b> that one may sell these items before they are harvested on the condition that the gentile will harvest them, as there is no recognizable improvement to them if they are left in the ground. Consequently, it is <b>necessary</b> for the dispute to be stated in all three cases.

### Part 16
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to the sale of large livestock, which is forbidden due to the concern that the gentile might use them to perform labor (see 14b), if such <b>livestock</b> are sold <b>on the condition that</b> the gentile will <b>slaughter</b> them, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 17
The Gemara explains the aspects of the dilemma: <b>There,</b> in the mishna, <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda permits</b> the sale of a tree on the condition that the gentile will cut it down? Is the reason <b>that</b> the trees are <b>not in</b> the gentile’s <b>domain and</b> therefore <b>he is not able to keep them,</b> as the Jew will force him to cut them down? <b>But</b> in the case of large <b>livestock, since</b> the animal <b>stands in the domain of the gentile</b> once it is sold, there is a concern that he might <b>keep it</b> and not slaughter it. <b>Or perhaps there is no difference</b> between the cases, and Rabbi Yehuda would permit one to sell even large livestock to a gentile, on the condition that he will slaughter the animals.

### Part 18
The Gemara suggests a resolution: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One may sell large <b>livestock</b> to a gentile <b>on the condition that</b> he <b>slaughter</b> it, <b>and he slaughters</b> it; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says: One may sell to</b> a gentile <b>only a slaughtered</b> animal.

### Part 19
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not rent a house to</b> a gentile <b>in Eretz Yisrael, and needless to say</b> one may not rent <b>fields</b> to them, as explained in the Gemara. <b>And in Syria</b>
