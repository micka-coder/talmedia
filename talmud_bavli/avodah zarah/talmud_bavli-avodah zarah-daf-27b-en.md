### Part 1
The Gemara explains the rationale for this leniency: The gentile <b>thinks</b> to himself that the Jew <b>is asking him</b> for his opinion, and <b>just as he is asking him, he</b> will also <b>ask other people. And</b> the gentile further reasons that if the Jew understands that the gentile provided him with bad advice, <b>that man,</b> i.e., the gentile, <b>will bring harm to himself</b> by damaging his own reputation. It is therefore assumed that the gentile will provide good advice in order to avoid sullying his reputation.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara analyzes a situation in which one may receive medical attention from gentiles. <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> who <b>says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If there is <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether a patient will <b>live</b> through his ailment <b>or die</b> from it, the patient <b>may not be treated by</b> gentile doctors, due to the concern that a gentile doctor may kill him. But if it is <b>certain</b> that he will <b>die</b> from his affliction if he does not receive medical attention, the patient <b>is treated by them,</b> as it is possible that a gentile physician will save him.

### Part 3
The Gemara challenges: Even if it is certain that the patient will <b>die</b> if he is not treated, <b>nevertheless, there is</b> value in <b>temporal life,</b> i.e., it is preferable for the Jew to live as long as his ailment permits rather than risking a premature death at the hands of a gentile physician. The Gemara explains: <b>We are not concerned with</b> the value of <b>temporal life</b> when there is a possibility of permanent recovery, and therefore it is preferable to receive medical attention from a gentile despite the risk involved.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do you say that we are not concerned with</b> the value of <b>temporal life? As it is written</b> with regard to the discussion held by four lepers left outside a besieged city: <b>“If we say: We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there;</b> and if we sit still here, we also die. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Arameans; if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die” (II Kings 7:4). The starving lepers decided to risk premature death rather than waiting to die of starvation. The Gemara asks rhetorically: <b>But isn’t there temporal life</b> to be lost, in which case it would be preferable for the lepers to remain in their current location? <b>Rather, is it not</b> apparent that <b>we are not concerned with</b> the value of <b>temporal life?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not engage in dealings with heretics, and one may not be treated by them even in</b> a case where it is clear that without medical attention one will experience only <b>temporal life.</b>

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> relates an incident illustrating this point. There was <b>an incident involving ben Dama, son of Rabbi Yishmael’s sister,</b> in <b>which a snake bit him. And</b> following the attack, <b>Ya’akov of the village of Sekhanya,</b> who was a heretic, a disciple of Jesus the Nazarene, <b>came to treat him, but Rabbi Yishmael did not let him</b> do so. <b>And</b> ben Dama <b>said to him: Rabbi Yishmael, my brother, let him</b> treat me, <b>and I will be healed by him. And I will cite a verse from the Torah</b> to prove <b>that</b> accepting medical treatment from a heretic <b>is permitted</b> in this situation. <b>But</b> ben Dama <b>did not manage to complete the statement before his soul departed</b> from his body <b>and he died.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yishmael recited with regard to him: Fortunate are you, ben Dama, as your body is pure and your soul departed in purity, and you did not transgress the statement of your colleagues, who would state</b> the verse: <b>“And who breaks through a fence, a snake shall bite him”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:8), i.e., one is punished for ignoring an ordinance of the Sages. This incident indicates that it is not permitted for one to accept medical treatment from a heretic even if it is clear that without it he will live only a short while.

### Part 8
The Gemara explains: <b>Heresy is different, as it is enticing.</b> In other words, it is prohibited to accept medical treatment from a heretic, <b>as one might come to be drawn after</b> his heresy. By contrast, receiving medical attention from a gentile is permitted if it is certain that one will die if he is not treated.

### Part 9
<b>The Master said</b> above: <b>You did not transgress the statement of your colleagues, who would state</b> the verse: <b>“And who breaks through a fence, a snake shall bite him.”</b> The Gemara asks: But ben Dama <b>was also bitten by a snake,</b> even before this declaration of Rabbi Yishmael, so how can he be considered fortunate? The Gemara explains: <b>The snake</b> mentioned in the curse <b>of the Sages</b> is different, <b>as it has no remedy whatsoever.</b> Although ben Dama was bitten by a snake, he could have been healed.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And what would</b> ben Dama <b>have said?</b> What verse did he intend to cite as proof that it was permitted for him to be healed by a heretic? The verse: “You shall therefore keep My statutes, and My ordinances, which if a man do, <b>he shall live by them”</b> (Leviticus 18:5). This teaches that one should live by God’s mitzvot, <b>and not that he</b> should <b>die by them.</b> This verse serves as a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one may violate a prohibition in order to save a life.

### Part 11
<b>And</b> why does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> disagree with ben Dama? He maintains that <b>this matter</b> applies only <b>in private, but in public</b> one <b>may not</b> transgress a prohibition even to save a life. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael would say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> oppressors <b>say to a person: Worship an idol and you</b> will <b>not be killed, that one should worship</b> the idol <b>and not be killed? The verse states: “He shall live by them,” and not that he should die by them.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that this applies <b>even in public.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall not profane My holy name”</b> (Leviticus 22:32).

### Part 12
§ The Gemara examines various circumstances in which one is permitted to receive treatment from a gentile. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>any injury for which Shabbat is desecrated, one may not be treated by</b> gentiles. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>any</b>
