### Part 1
it is <b>a <i>susbil</i>,</b> and accordingly, <b>with regard to a long-headed</b> locust, <b>everyone agrees that</b> it is <b>prohibited. And here they disagree with regard</b> to a locust <b>whose wings barely cover most of its</b> body: One <b>Sage,</b> Yosei ben Yo’ezer, <b>holds</b> that <b>we require</b> only <b>a minimal majority</b> of the locust’s body to be covered by its wings, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>we require a noticeable majority</b> of the body to be covered.

### Part 2
§ It was stated above: <b>And</b> Yosei ben Yo’ezer testified <b>with regard to the liquids of the slaughterhouse</b> in the Temple that they are <b>ritually pure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> did Yosei ben Yo’ezer mean when he said they are <b>pure? Rav says:</b> He meant that they are <b>actually ritually pure. And Shmuel says: They are pure</b> in the sense that they do not <b>impart ritual impurity to other</b> substances; <b>but they themselves</b> can contract <b>impurity.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara explains the reasons for these opinions. <b>Rav says</b> that these liquids are <b>actually pure,</b> as <b>he maintains</b> that <b>the ritual impurity of liquids</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law, and when the Sages decreed impurity</b> upon liquids, they did so only <b>with regard to ordinary liquids. But the Sages did not issue</b> their <b>decree with regard to the liquids of the slaughterhouse</b> in the Temple.

### Part 4
<b>And Shmuel says:</b> The liquids are <b>ritually pure</b> in the sense that they do not <b>impart impurity to other</b> substances; <b>but they themselves</b> can contract <b>impurity,</b> as Shmuel <b>maintains</b> that the <b>ritual impurity of liquids</b> themselves is <b>by Torah law,</b> whereas their capacity <b>to impart impurity to other</b> substances is <b>by rabbinic law. And when the Sages issued</b> this <b>decree,</b> they did so only with regard <b>to ordinary liquids.</b> But <b>they did not issue</b> their <b>decree</b> with regard <b>to the liquids of the slaughterhouse</b> in the Temple.

### Part 5
§ It was stated: <b>And</b> Yosei ben Yo’ezer testified <b>with regard to one who touches a corpse</b> that he is <b>impure, and</b> as a result <b>they called him: Yosef the Permissive.</b> The Gemara questions this: Since he issued a stringent ruling, <b>they should have</b> called him: <b>Yosef the Prohibiting. And furthermore,</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> explicitly written <b>in the Torah, as it is written: “And whosoever in the open field touches one that is slain with a sword, or one that is dead,</b> or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be impure seven days” (Numbers 19:16).

### Part 6
The Gemara explains: <b>By Torah law one who touches</b> a corpse is <b>ritually impure,</b> but <b>one who touches</b> another <b>who</b> has <b>touched</b> a corpse is <b>pure. And</b> the Sages <b>came and decreed</b> that <b>even one who touches</b> another <b>who</b> has <b>touched</b> a corpse is also impure. <b>And</b> Yosei ben Yo’ezer <b>came and established</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the original, more lenient <b>Torah law.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>One who touches</b> another <b>who</b> has <b>touched</b> a corpse <b>is also</b> rendered impure <b>by Torah law, as it is written: “And whatsoever the impure person touches shall be impure”</b> (Numbers 19:22).

### Part 8
<b>The Sages stated this</b> difficulty <b>before Rava in the name of Mar Zutra, the son of Rav Naḥman, who said</b> a response <b>in the name of Rav Naḥman: By Torah law,</b> one <b>who touches</b> another <b>who touches</b> a corpse <b>while</b> the second individual is <b>in concurrent contact</b> with the corpse is impure with <b>seven-</b>day <b>impurity.</b> If this occurs <b>while</b> the second individual is <b>not in concurrent contact</b> with the corpse, he contracts <b>impurity</b> until the <b>evening. And</b> the Sages <b>came and decreed that even</b> where there is <b>no concurrent contact,</b> one still contracts <b>seven-</b>day <b>impurity</b> when he touches someone who touched a corpse. <b>And</b> subsequently Yosei ben Yo’ezer <b>came and established</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the original <b>Torah law.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the source of this <i>halakha</i>, prescribed <b>by Torah law? As it is written: “He that touches the dead, even any man’s dead body, shall be impure seven days”</b> (Numbers 19:11), <b>and it is written: “And whatsoever the impure person touches shall be impure”</b> (Numbers 19:22). These two verses indicate that one contracts ritual impurity for seven days. <b>And</b> yet <b>it is</b> also <b>written: “And the soul that touches him shall be impure until evening”</b> (Numbers 19:22). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> in the first two verses, the Torah is discussing <b>concurrent contact,</b> which results in impurity of seven days; <b>there,</b> in the last verse, it is discussing a case <b>where</b> there is <b>no concurrent contact,</b> and therefore the individual in question is impure only until the evening.

### Part 11
<b>Rava said to</b> the Sages who suggested that explanation citing Rav Naḥman: <b>Didn’t I tell you not to hang empty pitchers [<i>bukei</i>] upon Rav Naḥman,</b> i.e., not to attribute incorrect statements to him? Rather, <b>this is</b> what <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> Yosei ben Yo’ezer <b>permitted for them</b> a case of <b>uncertain impurity</b> contracted <b>in a public domain.</b> In other words, Yosei ben Yo’ezer ruled leniently that one who is unsure whether or not he came in contact with a corpse in the public domain is ritually pure.

### Part 12
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> from</b> the case of <b>a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>]: Just as a <i>sota</i></b> can be made to drink the bitter waters only when she is suspected of engaging in adultery in <b>a private domain, so too,</b> uncertain <b>ritual impurity</b> is considered impure only when one suspects that he came into contact with it in <b>a private domain?</b> This shows that even by Torah law one who is unsure whether or not he touched a corpse in the public domain remains pure.

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> in explanation: This is the <b><i>halakha</i>, but</b> a public <b>ruling is not issued to that effect.</b> Consequently, the masses treated this matter with stringency. <b>And</b> Yosei ben Yo’ezer <b>came and instructed</b> the masses to follow the original <b>instruction</b> of the Torah. Therefore, his ruling was in fact a leniency.

### Part 14
The Gemara provides support for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s explanation. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that Yosei ben Yo’ezer <b>drove stakes</b> into the ground <b>for</b> the people <b>and said: Until here</b> is <b>the public domain,</b> and <b>until there</b> is <b>the private domain,</b> so that they would know the <i>halakha</i> if they suspected that they had touched a corpse. The Gemara relates that <b>when</b> people <b>came before Rabbi Yannai</b> because they suspected that they might have come into contact with a source of impurity in the public domain, <b>he said to them:</b> Why involve yourselves in matters of uncertainty? <b>There is deep water in the river; go immerse</b> yourselves in it, and resolve the problem in this manner.

### Part 15
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And boiled</b> vegetables prepared by gentiles are prohibited. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The verse states</b> that when Moses asked Sihon, King of the Amorites, for passage through his land, he said: <b>“You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:28). By juxtaposing food and water, the verse teaches that food is <b>like water: Just as</b> Moses wished to purchase <b>water that was unchanged, so too,</b> he wished to purchase <b>food that was unchanged,</b> i.e., uncooked. Evidently, this is because foods cooked by gentiles are prohibited.

### Part 16
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If that is so,</b> then in a case where a gentile had <b>wheat and made it</b> into <b>roasted grains</b> by roasting it in the oven, the wheat should <b>also be prohibited,</b> as it was cooked. <b>And if you would say: Indeed</b> that is so, this cannot be the <i>halakha</i>, as <b>isn’t it taught</b> in <i>baraita</i>: If a gentile had <b>wheat and made it</b> into <b>roasted grains,</b> it is <b>permitted?</b> The Gemara suggests a different explanation: <b>Rather,</b> food is <b>like water</b> in the following manner: <b>Just as</b> Moses wished to purchase <b>water that was not altered from its original state, so too,</b> he wished to purchase <b>food that was not altered from its original state.</b> Roasting wheat kernels does not alter their original state.

### Part 17
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>If that is so,</b> then if a gentile had <b>wheat and ground it</b> into flour, the flour should <b>also be prohibited,</b> as the wheat has been altered from its original state. <b>And if you would say: Indeed</b> that is so, this cannot be the case, as <b>isn’t it taught</b> in <i>baraita</i>: If a gentile had <b>wheat and made it</b> into <b>roasted grains,</b> it is permitted; similarly, <b>flours and fine flours belonging to</b> gentiles <b>are permitted? Rather,</b> food is <b>like water</b> in the following manner: <b>Just as</b> Moses wished to purchase <b>water that was not altered from its original state by fire, so too,</b> he wished to purchase <b>food that was not altered from its original state by fire.</b> Although wheat ground into flour is altered from its original state, this change is not accomplished by means of fire.

### Part 18
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Is fire written</b> in the verse? There is no mention of fire in the verse at all. How can it be assumed that this is the similarity between water and food?
