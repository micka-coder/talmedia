### Part 1
The source is <b>that the verse states: “You should not show them mercy [<i>lo teḥonnem</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:2), which is understood as meaning: <b>You should not give them</b> a chance to <b>encamp [<i>ḥanayah</i>] in,</b> i.e., to acquire <b>land</b> in, Eretz Yisrael. The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> phrase: <b>“You should not show them mercy”;</b> isn’t <b>it necessary</b> to teach <b>that this</b> is what <b>the Merciful one is saying: You should not give them favor [<i>ḥen</i>]</b> by praising them?

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> that were <b>so, let the verse say: <i>Lo teḥunnem</i>,</b> with the letter <i>vav</i>, as then it would be evident that this is a form of the root <i>ḥet</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>nun</i>, which means favor. <b>What</b> is the reason that the verse instead states: <b><i>Lo teḥonnem</i>,</b> without the letter <i>vav</i>? <b>Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it,</b> that one may not praise them and also that one may not allow them to acquire land.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But still,</b> isn’t the phrase “You should not show them mercy” <b>necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>that this</b> is what <b>the Merciful One states: You should not give them an undeserved [<i>ḥinnam</i>] gift?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> that were <b>so, let the verse say: <i>Lo teḥinnem</i>. What</b> is the reason that it is spelled without the letter <i>yud</i>, as: <b><i>Lo teḥonnem</i>? Learn from it all of these</b> three <i>halakhot</i>.

### Part 4
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You should not show them mercy”;</b> this teaches that <b>you should not give them</b> a chance to <b>encamp in</b> the <b>land</b> of Eretz Yisrael. <b>Another matter: “You should not show them mercy”;</b> this indicates that <b>you should not give them favor. Another matter: “You should not show them mercy”;</b> this teaches that <b>you should not give them an undeserved gift.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this issue of <b>an undeserved gift</b> to a gentile <b>is itself</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“You shall not eat of any unslaughtered animal carcass; you may give it to the resident alien who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner;</b> for you are a sacred people to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that it is permitted <b>to a resident alien through giving and to a gentile through selling. From where</b> do I derive that it is permitted to transfer an unslaughtered animal <b>to a resident alien through selling? The verse states: “You may give it</b>…<b>or you may sell it,”</b> meaning that one has the option to do either of these.

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From where</b> is it derived that it is permitted <b>to a gentile through giving</b> and one is not required to sell it to him? <b>The verse states: “You may give it</b>…<b>that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner.”</b> Therefore, <b>you may say</b> that he may transfer it to <b>both a resident alien and a gentile, both through giving and through selling.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> These <b>matters are</b> to be understood <b>as they are written;</b> one may transfer an unslaughtered animal carcass <b>to a resident alien</b> only <b>through giving, and to a gentile</b> only <b>through selling,</b> as it is prohibited to give an undeserved gift to a gentile.

### Part 7
The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Meir is saying well,</b> as the verse indicates that either method is acceptable. The Gemara explains: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> could have <b>said to you: If it enters your mind</b> to understand the verse <b>in accordance with</b> that which <b>Rabbi Meir says,</b> then <b>let the Merciful One write: You may give it</b> to the resident alien who is within your gates <b>that he may eat it, and</b> also <b>you may sell it</b> to a foreigner. <b>Why do I</b> need the word <b>“or”</b> between these two options? <b>Learn from it that it comes to</b> teach that <b>the matters are</b> to be understood <b>as they are written.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Meir</b> explain the wording of the verse? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> word, “or,” teaches <b>that</b> one should <b>give precedence to giving to a resident alien over selling to a gentile. And Rabbi Yehuda</b> holds that <b>since you are commanded to sustain a resident alien,</b> as it is stated: “And he shall live with you” (Leviticus 25:35), <b>and you are not commanded to sustain a gentile, there is no need for a verse to</b> teach that one should <b>give precedence</b> to a resident alien.

### Part 9
§ It is taught in the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier: <b>Another matter: “You should not show them favor”;</b> this teaches that <b>you should not give them favor</b> by praising them. The Gemara notes that this <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rav. As Rav says: It is prohibited for a person to say: How beautiful is this gentile woman!</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who was on a step on the Temple mount, and he saw a certain gentile woman who was exceptionally beautiful</b> and <b>said: “How great are Your works, O Lord!”</b> (Psalms 104:24). <b>And Rabbi Akiva too,</b> when he <b>saw the wife of the wicked Turnus Rufus he spat, laughed, and cried. He spat, as she was created from a putrid drop; he laughed, as</b> he foresaw that <b>she was destined to convert and he would marry her; he cried, as this beauty</b> would ultimately <b>be consumed by dirt.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And</b> how would <b>Rav</b> explain the incident involving Rabban Gamliel, who praised the beauty of a gentile? The Gemara answers: Rabban Gamliel <b>was giving thanks to</b> God for creating such beautiful people rather than praising the gentile herself. <b>As the Master said: One who sees beautiful</b> or otherwise outstanding <b>creatures recites: Blessed</b> be He, <b>Who has created such in His world.</b>

### Part 12
<b>But is it permitted to gaze</b> upon a woman? The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: <b>“And you shall keep yourself from every evil thing”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:10); this teaches <b>that a person should not gaze upon a beautiful woman, even</b> if she is <b>unmarried; and</b> a person should not gaze upon <b>a married woman, even</b> if she is <b>ugly;</b>
