### Part 1
The Gemara elaborates: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, as it was interpreted above: <b>Like the signs of</b> bird <b>eggs, so are the signs of fish roe?</b> Apparently, the <i>baraita</i> assumes that non-kosher fish roe exists. The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t you</b> yourself find it necessary to <b>explain</b> and reinterpret the <i>baraita</i>, as it cannot be understood according to its straightforward meaning? Rabbi Dostai can also explain the <i>baraita</i> so that it effectively reads: Like the signs of bird eggs, <b>so are the signs of fish intestines.</b> Accordingly, the <i>baraita</i> never actually mentions fish roe at all.

### Part 2
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But where do you find</b> that one of the <b>signs of fish intestines</b> is <b>that</b> they <b>must be round and pointed?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>You find</b> this <b>with regard to</b> the swim <b>bladder</b> of a fish, which is considered to be kosher if it is shaped like a kosher egg.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>If there is no expert there,</b> and one cannot determine whether or not the fish roe is kosher, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>once</b> the seller <b>says: I salted</b> the fish from which this roe came and they were kosher, the roe is <b>permitted. Rav Naḥman says:</b> The roe is prohibited <b>until</b> the seller shows kosher fish to the buyer and <b>says: These are the fish, and these are their intestines.</b> That is, the roe is permitted only if the seller can present the fish that produced it. The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yehuda instructed Adda,</b> his <b>attendant: Once</b> the seller <b>says: I salted them,</b> they <b>are permitted.</b>

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the leaf of a <i>ḥiltit</i></b> plant is permitted. The Gemara asks: Since the previous mishna (35b) prohibited a sliver of <i>ḥiltit</i> only due to the concern that it might have been sliced with a non-kosher knife, isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that a leaf, which has not been sliced, is permitted? The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <b>only</b> with regard <b>to the slivers</b> of <i>ḥiltit</i> <b>that</b> might be found <b>on</b> the leaf, <b>lest you say</b> that one should <b>be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> a gentile might <b>bring</b> slivers sliced with a non-kosher knife <b>and mix it</b> with the slivers on the leaf. The mishna therefore <b>teaches us that</b> it is assumed that the slivers on the leaf had <b>stuck</b> to it <b>and came</b> off <b>with</b> the plant when it was pulled from the ground.

### Part 5
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And rolled olive cakes.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that these are permitted? For what reason might they be prohibited? The Gemara answers: <b>No, it is necessary</b> to teach that they are permitted <b>even though they are very soft. Lest you say</b> that there is a concern that they softened because a gentile <b>placed wine in them,</b> the mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that <b>these</b> olives <b>have softened due to the oil</b> they possess.

### Part 6
§ The mishna further teaches: <b>And Rabbi Yosei says: Overripe</b> olives <b>are prohibited.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are overripe</b> olives <b>like? Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says:</b> This is referring to <b>any</b> olive <b>that</b> if <b>one grasps it in his hand, its pit slips out,</b> due to the softness of the olive.

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Locusts that come</b> from a salesman’s basket are prohibited while those that come from the storeroom are permitted. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Locusts, and caper buds, and leeks [<i>kaflotot</i>] that come from the storehouse, and from the storeroom, and from</b> a gentile’s <b>ship are</b> all <b>permitted. Those</b> that are <b>sold in the market [<i>bekatluza</i>]</b> from baskets that are <b>in front of the storekeeper are prohibited, because</b> it is assumed that the gentile storekeeper <b>sprinkles wine upon them. And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>apple wine</b> that <b>belongs to gentiles: Those</b> that <b>come from the storehouse or from the storeroom or from</b> a salesman’s <b>basket are permitted.</b> Apple wine that <b>is sold in the market</b> is <b>prohibited, because they mix</b> grape <b>wine</b> of gentiles <b>in it.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara cites a relevant incident: <b>The Sages taught: Once Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>felt</b> discomfort <b>in his stomach</b> and knew that apple wine would alleviate it. <b>He said: Isn’t there</b> any <b>person who knows</b> whether <b>apple wine of gentiles</b> is <b>prohibited or permitted? Rabbi Yishmael ben Rabbi Yosei said before him: Once my father felt</b> discomfort <b>in his stomach and they brought him apple wine of gentiles</b> that was <b>seventy years</b> old, <b>and he drank</b> it <b>and was cured.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: You had so much</b> knowledge <b>in your hand</b> that could have relieved me, <b>and</b> yet <b>you caused me to suffer</b> by withholding it until now.

### Part 9
<b>They checked and found one gentile who had three hundred large jugs of apple wine</b> that was <b>seventy years</b> old, <b>and</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>drank</b> from it <b>and was cured. He said: Blessed is the Omnipresent who delivered His universe to keepers.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi thanked God for causing the gentile to keep the wine for seventy years so that it could be used to heal him.

### Part 10
§ The mishna further teaches: <b>And likewise with regard to <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the statement: <b>And likewise with regard to <i>teruma</i>? Rav Sheshet says:</b> This means: <b>And likewise</b> the same <i>halakha</i> applies <b>to a priest who is suspected of selling <i>teruma</i>,</b> which is less expensive, <b>as non-sacred</b> food. <b>It is</b> only when the food is <b>in front of</b> the priest <b>that</b> it <b>is prohibited; but</b> food <b>that comes from the storehouse or from the storeroom or from</b> a salesman’s <b>basket is permitted.</b> The reason is that the priest <b>is fearful,</b> because <b>he thinks</b> to himself: If I sell <i>teruma</i> in public, <b>the Sages will hear of it and deprive me of</b> all my wares.
