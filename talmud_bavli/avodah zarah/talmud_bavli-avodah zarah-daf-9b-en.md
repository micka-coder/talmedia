<b>“Forty-eight cities”</b> (Numbers 35:7). Similarly, <b>if a scribe forgot</b> the exact year, <b>let him ask the <i>tanna</i> how many</b> years does <b>he teach</b> have already been lost from the two thousand years that are designated for the days of the Messiah. <b>And he should deduct forty-eight</b> years <b>from</b> the number, correcting for the century, <b>and</b> in this manner <b>he</b> will <b>find his number. And your mnemonic</b> to remember that the <i>tanna</i> must add to the date of the scribe, while the scribe must deduct from the number of the <i>tanna</i>, is again: <b>A scribe deducts,</b> while <b>a <i>tanna</i> adds on [<i>tosfa’a</i>].</b>

### Part 2
§ <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says:</b> In the case of <b>one who does not know which year of</b> the seven-year <b>Sabbatical</b> cycle <b>he stands</b> in, <b>he should add one year</b> to the years that have passed since the destruction of the Temple in order to begin at the start of a Sabbatical cycle. <b>And he should calculate the general</b> years, i.e., the centuries, <b>as Jubilee</b> cycles, as every Jubilee concludes seven completed Sabbatical cycles of forty-nine years, <b>and the details as Sabbatical</b> cycles, i.e., he should divide the remaining years into seven-year Sabbatical cycles.

### Part 3
<b>But</b> as the Jubilee Year itself is counted as one year of a Sabbatical cycle, <b>he should take, from</b> every <b>hundred</b> years that passed, <b>two</b> years, <b>and add it to the details,</b> i.e., the remaining decades and single years. <b>And</b> then <b>he should calculate</b> with <b>the details</b> by dividing them <b>into Sabbatical</b> cycles. <b>And</b> from the remainder <b>he will know how many years in the</b> current <b>Sabbatical</b> cycle have passed. <b>And your mnemonic</b> that two years must be deducted from every century is the following verse: <b>“For these two years the famine has been in the land”</b> (Genesis 45:6).

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: After</b> the year <b>400 from the destruction of the Temple, if a person says to you: Purchase a field</b> that is <b>worth one thousand dinars for one dinar, do not purchase</b> it. It is not a worthwhile investment, as the redemption will soon come and all fields will revert to their original owners. It <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: After</b> the year <b>4,231 from the creation of the world, if a person says to you: Purchase a field</b> that is <b>worth one thousand dinars for one dinar, do not purchase</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> these two dates? The Gemara answers: There <b>is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> of <b>three years, as the <i>baraita</i> adds three years.</b> The year 400 from the destruction of the Temple corresponds to the year 4,228 from the creation of the world.

### Part 5
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> promissory <b>note in which was written</b>
