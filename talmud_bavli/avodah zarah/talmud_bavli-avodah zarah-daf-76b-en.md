with <b>a rim [<i>gedanfa</i>] of dough around its rim, and filled it with water and boiled it,</b> so that the water boiled along its rim. <b>Rava said: Who</b> would be <b>clever</b> enough <b>to perform such an action if not Rav Akavya, as he is a great man. He maintains</b> that <b>as it absorbs it so it expels it; just as</b> the rim <b>absorbs</b> the forbidden substance <b>by small drops</b> of it that reach the rim, <b>so too it expels</b> the forbidden substance <b>by small drops</b> of boiling water that reach the rim.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the knife, one must polish it and it is</b> rendered <b>pure. Rav Ukva bar Ḥama says: And one must thrust it ten times into the ground. Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says: And</b> this must be done <b>in untilled earth,</b> i.e., hard earth. <b>Rav Kahana says: And</b> this applies <b>to a good knife that does not have notches,</b> so that the entire surface of the knife is scraped against the ground. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a good knife that does not have notches, one can thrust it ten times into the ground. Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says:</b> This is sufficient <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>eating cold</b> food <b>with it.</b>

### Part 3
This is <b>like that</b> incident <b>involving Mar Yehuda,</b> an important personage of the house of the Exilarch, <b>and Bati bar Tuvi,</b> a wealthy man, who <b>were sitting before King Shapur,</b> the king of Persia. The king’s servants <b>brought an <i>etrog</i> before them.</b> The king <b>cut</b> a slice and <b>ate</b> it, and then he <b>cut</b> a slice <b>and gave</b> it <b>to Bati bar Tuvi. He then stuck</b> the knife <b>ten times in the ground, cut</b> a slice, and <b>gave</b> it <b>to Mar Yehuda. Bati bar Tuvi said to him: And is that man,</b> referring to himself, <b>not Jewish?</b> King Shapur <b>said to him: I am certain of</b> that <b>master,</b> Mar Yehuda, that he is meticulous about <i>halakha</i>; <b>but I am not certain of</b> that <b>master,</b> referring to Bati bar Tuvi, that he is meticulous in this regard.

### Part 4
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that King Shapur <b>said to him: Remember what you did last night.</b> The Persian practice was to present a woman to each guest, with whom he would engage in intercourse. Mar Yehuda did not accept the woman who was sent to him, but Bati bar Tuvi did, and therefore he was not assumed to be meticulous with regard to eating kosher food.
