as, <b>since its prohibition is nullified,</b> its <b>impurity is also nullified. When he raises the dilemma,</b> it is only with regard to <b>an offering</b> consisting <b>of food</b> brought <b>in idolatrous worship. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does one say that <b>since its prohibition is not nullified, in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Giddel,</b> who teaches that the prohibition that takes effect with regard to offerings brought in idolatrous worship is never nullified, therefore the <b>impurity is also not nullified? Or perhaps</b> only their <b>prohibition,</b> which is <b>by Torah law, is not nullified,</b> but their <b>impurity,</b> which is <b>by rabbinic law, is nullified.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 2
§ <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul asked Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: With regard to <b>vessels that were used in the temple of Onias, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to using them in the Temple?</b>

### Part 3
<b>And he raised this dilemma according to</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that <b>the temple of Onias was not a temple of idol worship. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 109a): <b>Priests who served in the temple of Onias may not serve in the Temple that is in Jerusalem, and needless to say,</b> those priests who served in a temple <b>of something else,</b> i.e., idol worship, may not serve in the Temple in Jerusalem. This distinction indicates that the temple of Onias was not a temple of idol worship. It was used for the service of God, but it violated the prohibition against sacrificing offerings outside of the Temple in Jerusalem.

### Part 4
The Gemara explains the dilemma: Does one say that <b>it is</b> only the <b>priests that the Sages penalized</b> by preventing them from serving in the Temple, <b>as they possess awareness</b> and are responsible for their actions, <b>but</b> they did <b>not</b> institute a similar decree with regard to <b>vessels,</b> as they are inanimate? <b>Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference,</b> and the decree also applies to the vessels.

### Part 5
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul: The vessels that were used in the temple of Onias <b>are prohibited, and we possessed</b> knowledge of <b>a verse</b> from which this <i>halakha</i> was derived, <b>but we forgot</b> which verse <b>it</b> is.

### Part 6
Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul <b>raised an objection to</b> this ruling from a verse referring to vessels of the Temple that Ahaz had used for idol worship: <b>“All the vessels, which King Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he acted treacherously, we have prepared and sanctified,</b> and, behold, they are before the altar of the Lord” (II Chronicles 29:19). <b>What, is it not</b> the case that the term <b>“we have prepared”</b> means <b>that we immersed them</b> in a ritual bath, and the term <b>“sanctified”</b> means <b>that we sanctified them</b> to be used again in the Temple? This would indicate that the vessels may be used in the Temple even though they were used in idolatrous worship.

### Part 7
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul: <b>Blessed are you to Heaven, as you have returned my lost</b> verse <b>to me.</b> That verse is the forgotten source of the <i>halakha</i> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi stated, and it should be interpreted as follows: <b>“We have prepared”</b> means <b>that we interred them; “and sanctified”</b> means <b>that we sanctified other</b> vessels <b>in their stead,</b> as the vessels used by Ahaz were forbidden, and the same applies to the vessels from the temple of Onias.

### Part 8
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the mishna <b>supports</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion (<i>Middot</i> 1:6): The <b>northeast</b> chamber of the Chamber of the Hearth was the chamber <b>in which the Hasmoneans sequestered the altar stones that the people of Greece desecrated. And Rav Sheshet says:</b> This means <b>that</b> they <b>desecrated</b> the stones by using them <b>for idol worship.</b> This indicates that Temple vessels that were used in idolatrous worship can no longer be used and must be sequestered.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> That case of the altar’s stones is different, because <b>there</b> a Sage <b>found a verse and interpreted it homiletically, as it is written:</b> “And they shall profane My secret place, <b>and robbers shall enter into it and profane it”</b> (Ezekiel 7:22). The verse indicates that when the gentiles entered the Temple and desecrated it, the altar was desacralized and acquired non-sacred status. Consequently, when the stones were subsequently used for idolatrous worship they were rendered forbidden even for non-sacred use.

### Part 10
The Gemara explains why the altar’s stones were sequestered: The Hasmoneans <b>said: What should we do</b> to revoke the stone’s forbidden status? <b>Shall we break them?</b> That is not possible, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “You shall build the altar of the Lord your God of <b>unhewn stones”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:6). <b>Shall we saw them</b> without breaking them? That is also not a viable option, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“You shall lift up no iron tool upon them”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:5). There was therefore no alternative to sequestering the stones.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> did the Hasmoneans have no alternative? <b>Let them break</b> the stones <b>and take them for themselves. Didn’t Rav Oshaya say:</b> The Sages <b>wished to sequester all</b> of the <b>silver and gold in the world because of</b> the <b>silver and gold of Jerusalem,</b> most of which was consecrated to the Temple treasury and became mixed with other silver and gold. <b>And we discussed it</b> and asked: <b>Is Jerusalem the majority of the world</b> that all of the silver and gold of the world should be forbidden as perhaps it came from Jerusalem?

### Part 12
<b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> The Sages <b>wished to sequester all</b> of the <b>worn-out dinars of Hadrian and Trajan because of the coins of Jerusalem,</b> as it was known that these coins contained a large quantity of the Temple treasury’s gold and silver. They did not permit the use of these coins <b>until they found a verse in the Torah</b> indicating <b>that it is permitted: “And robbers shall enter into it, and profane it”</b> (Ezekiel 7:22).

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: The two cases are not comparable. <b>There,</b> the coins of Jerusalem <b>had not been used in</b> service of the <b>Most High;</b> they were only consecrated. <b>Here, since</b> the stones of the altar <b>had been used in</b> service of the <b>Most High,</b> it is <b>not proper conduct for an ordinary person to make use of them,</b> and therefore the Hasmoneans sequestered the stones.

### Part 14
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A gentile can revoke</b> the status of <b>his</b> object of <b>idol worship and</b> the status of the idol <b>of another</b> gentile, <b>but a Jew cannot revoke</b> the status of the object of <b>idol worship of a gentile. One who revokes</b> the status of an object of <b>idol worship</b> thereby <b>revokes</b> the status of <b>its accessories.</b> But if he <b>revokes</b> the status of <b>its accessories,</b> its <b>accessories</b> alone are rendered <b>permitted, but</b> the object of idol worship <b>itself</b> remains <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, the following version of the mishna: <b>A gentile can revoke</b> the status of <b>his</b> object of <b>idol worship and</b> the status of the idol <b>of another</b> gentile. Rabbi Shimon <b>said to him: My teacher, in your youth,</b> i.e., when you were younger, <b>you taught us</b> a different version of the mishna: <b>A gentile can revoke</b> the status of <b>his</b> object of <b>idol worship and</b> the status of the object of idol worship <b>of a Jew.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Can</b> the status of <b>a Jew’s</b> idol <b>be revoked? But isn’t it written: “And shall set it up in a hidden place”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:15), from which the Sages derived that a Jew’s idol requires interment? <b>Rabbi Hillel, son of Rabbi Volas, said: No,</b> this <i>halakha</i> is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> the gentile <b>has partnership in</b> the idol, and therefore it is possible to say that its status can be revoked.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>What did</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>hold in his youth, and what did he hold in his old age?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>In his youth he held</b> that the <b>Jew worships</b> the idol <b>based on the intention of</b> the <b>gentile. Once the gentile revokes</b> the status of <b>his</b> share in the idol, the status of the share <b>of</b> the <b>Jew is also revoked. But in his old age</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>held</b> that the <b>Jew worships</b> the idol <b>based on his own intentions.</b> Therefore, <b>when</b> the <b>gentile revokes</b> the status of the object of idol worship, he revokes the status of only <b>his own</b> share, but the status of the share <b>of</b> the <b>Jew is not revoked.</b>

### Part 17
<b>There are those who teach</b> Rabbi Hillel’s statement <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>A Jew cannot revoke</b> the status of the object of <b>idol worship of a gentile.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious? Said Rabbi Hillel, son</b>
