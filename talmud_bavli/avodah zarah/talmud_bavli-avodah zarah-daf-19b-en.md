### Part 1
<b>he will not</b> become confused by the <b>different versions</b> of the same statements he hears from each teacher, as he will have no clear authoritative version from one source. The Gemara continues discussing the verse cited above: <b>“By streams [<i>palgei</i>] of water”</b> (Psalms 1:3). <b>Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai says:</b> Since the root <i>peh</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>gimmel</i> can also refer to dividing, the verse is interpreted as follows: <b>A person should always divide his years into thirds,</b> as follows: <b>One third for Bible, one third for Mishna</b> and <b>one third for Talmud.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: How can one divide his life this way? <b>Does a person know the length of his life,</b> that he can calculate how much a third will be? The Gemara answers: <b>When we said</b> that a one should divide his time into thirds, the intention was <b>with regard to</b> his <b>days,</b> i.e., he should devote one third of each day to Bible, Mishna, and Talmud, respectively.

### Part 3
The Gemara discusses the continuation of the verse cited above: <b>“That brings forth its fruit in its season</b> and whose leaf does not wither” (Psalms 1:3). <b>Rava says: If one brings forth fruit in its season,</b> i.e., if he acts in accordance with the precepts of Torah that he learns, then <b>his leaf will not wither,</b> as the Torah will sustain him. <b>But if</b> one does <b>not</b> learn with the intention that his studies should lead to action, then <b>with regard to</b> both <b>the one who is taught and with regard to the one who teaches, the verse states about them: “Not so the wicked; but</b> they are like the chaff that the wind drives away” (Psalms 1:4).

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For she has cast down [<i>hippila</i>] many wounded</b> and a mighty host are all her slain” (Proverbs 7:26)? <b>This</b> is referring to <b>a student who has not</b> yet <b>reached</b> the level where he can render <b>legal decisions, but</b> nevertheless <b>he</b> already <b>issues decisions.</b> He is like a fetus that emerged from the womb before its time, as the word <i>hippila</i> also means to miscarry. <b>“And a mighty host are all her slain”; this</b> is referring to <b>a student who has reached</b> the level where he can render <b>legal decisions,</b> referred to here as “a mighty host,” <b>but he does not issue decisions,</b> and by refraining from teaching what he knows prevents the masses from learning Torah properly.

### Part 5
<b>And until when</b> is a scholar considered too immature to render legal decisions? He is considered immature <b>until</b> the age of <b>forty years.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rava issue legal decisions</b> before that age? The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> it is permitted, as <b>in</b> Rava’s case <b>they are equal,</b> i.e., if one has achieved a level of knowledge that is equivalent to that of the foremost scholar in his city, he is permitted to render decisions even before reaching the age of forty.

### Part 6
The Gemara cites another discussion with regard to the aforementioned verse: <b>“And whose leaf does not wither”</b> (Psalms 1:3). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Adda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Aḥa bar Abba</b> who <b>says</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> One should know <b>that even</b> the <b>ordinary conversation of Torah scholars require analysis, as it is stated: “And whose leaf does not wither.”</b> This teaches that even the ordinary conversation of a Torah scholar, which is comparable to the leaves of a tree, has great significance like the actual fruit of the tree.

### Part 7
The verse continues: <b>“And in whatsoever he does he shall prosper.” Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: This matter is written in the Torah, and repeated in the Prophets, and stated a third time in the Writings:</b> Concerning <b>anyone who engages in Torah</b> study, <b>his property</b> dealings <b>will be successful. It is written in the Torah, as it is written: “Observe therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that you may make all that you do to prosper”</b> (Deuteronomy 29:8).

### Part 8
<b>It is repeated in the Prophets, as it is written: “This book of the Torah shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it; for then you shall make your ways prosperous, and then you shall have good success”</b> (Joshua 1:8). <b>It is stated a third time in the Writings, as it is written: “But his delight is in the Torah of the Lord; and in His Torah he meditates day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf does not wither; and in whatsoever he does he shall prosper”</b> (Psalms 1:2–3).

### Part 9
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Alexandri would proclaim</b> in public, in the manner of a merchant selling wares: <b>Who desires life? Who desires life? Everyone gathered around him</b> to buy from him, <b>saying to him: Give us life! He stated</b> the following verse <b>to them: “Who is the man that desires life,</b> and loves days, that he may see good in them? <b>Keep your tongue from evil,</b> and your lips from speaking guile” (Psalms 34:13–14).

### Part 10
The psalm continues: <b>“Depart from evil, and do good;</b> seek peace and pursue it” (Psalms 34:15). The Gemara explains: <b>Lest one say: I have kept my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile, I will</b> therefore <b>go and indulge in sleep.</b> To counter this possibility, <b>the verse states: “Depart from evil, and do good,”</b> i.e., it is not enough to avoid evil, but one must actively do good. And the word <b>good</b> means <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “For I have given you a good portion; My Torah, do not abandon it”</b> (Proverbs 4:2).

### Part 11
§ The mishna teaches: One may build with gentiles small platforms and bathhouses, but once <b>he reaches the arched chamber</b> in the bath <b>where</b> the gentiles <b>put up</b> objects of <b>idol worship,</b> it is prohibited for a Jew to continue building it. <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: If he did</b> continue to <b>build</b> the arched chamber, <b>his wages are permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> After all, such arched chambers <b>are</b> only <b>accessories of idol worship, and</b> with regard to <b>accessories of idol worship, both according to Rabbi Yishmael and according to Rabbi Akiva,</b> who disagree with regard to deriving benefit from an actual object of idol worship (51b), deriving benefit from accessories of idol worship is <b>not prohibited until they are worshipped.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya says:</b> Rabbi Elazar’s statement <b>is necessary only to</b> permit the wages of a Jew who built an object of <b>idol worship itself.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that an object of <b>idol worship of a Jew is forbidden immediately</b> once it is built, <b>but</b> it is not prohibited to derive benefit from an object of idol worship <b>of a gentile until it is</b> actually <b>worshipped.</b> In this case the idol was built for a gentile, and therefore the laborer may receive payment for his work, as the idol was never worshipped. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that an object of <b>idol worship of a gentile is</b> also <b>forbidden immediately, what can be said?</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rather, Rabba bar Ulla says:</b> Rabbi Elazar’s statement that the worker’s wages are permitted <b>is necessary only with regard to the final stroke</b> with which the laborer completes his work. In the case of an object of <b>idol worship, what causes it</b> to be used for idol worship? It is <b>the completion of labor, and when is the completion of labor</b> achieved? It is achieved <b>with the final stroke</b> of the laborer. <b>The final stroke</b> alone <b>does not have the value of one <i>peruta</i>,</b> and therefore the wages he receives are due when each act of labor is performed during the entire process, not when the final stroke completes the work.

### Part 14
<b>Evidently,</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>holds</b> that the obligation to pay <b>a wage is</b> incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end,</b> not merely upon completion of the work. Since the worker has rights to his wages at every stage of labor performed during the entire period of work, the wages are not considered a benefit that he receives from idol worship, as the object is classified as an object of idol worship only at the very end.

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And one may not fashion jewelry for</b> an object of <b>idol worship,</b> and this applies to jewelry such as <b>necklaces [<i>katla’ot</i>], nose rings, and rings. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If one fashions them in exchange <b>for payment,</b> it is <b>permitted.</b> The mishna returns to the issue of selling items to gentiles: <b>One may not sell to</b> a gentile any item <b>that is attached to the ground, but one may sell</b> such an item <b>once it is severed</b> from the ground. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is not necessary to sever the item from the ground; rather, <b>one may sell it on the condition that it be severed.</b>

### Part 16
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter,</b> that it is prohibited to sell to a gentile anything that is attached to the ground, derived? <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says:</b>
