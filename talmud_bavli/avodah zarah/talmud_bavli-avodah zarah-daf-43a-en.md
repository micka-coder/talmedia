### Part 1
The Sages interpret this verse as referring to the heavenly constellations, which indicates that it <b>is</b> prohibited to form only <b>these</b> figures, but it is <b>not</b> prohibited to form <b>a figure of a dragon.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara concludes, it is <b>obvious</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>finds</b> a vessel with the figure of a dragon, <b>and</b> this is <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna: In the case of <b>one who finds vessels, and upon them is a figure of the sun,</b> a figure of the moon, or a figure of a dragon, he must take them and cast them into the Dead Sea.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks about the lack of consistency between the clauses of Rav Sheshet’s statement: Can it be that <b>the first clause and the last clause are</b> referring to a case <b>where one finds</b> vessels with the specified figures, <b>and the middle clause is</b> referring to a case <b>where one forms</b> these figures?

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said: Indeed, the first clause and the last clause are</b> referring to cases <b>where one finds</b> vessels with figures, <b>and the middle clause is</b> referring to a case <b>where one forms</b> figures.

### Part 5
<b>Rava said: The entire</b> statement of Rav Sheshet is referring to a case <b>where one finds</b> vessels with these figures, <b>and the middle clause is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda adds</b> to the list of forbidden figures <b>even a figure of a nursing woman and <i>Sar Apis</i>.</b> The figure of <b>a nursing woman</b> is worshipped as it <b>symbolizes Eve, who nurses the entire world.</b> The figure of <b><i>Sar Apis</i></b> is worshipped as it <b>symbolizes Joseph, who ruled over [<i>sar</i>] and appeased [<i>mefis</i>] the entire world</b> by distributing food during the seven years of famine (see Genesis, chapter 41). <b>But</b> the figure of <i>Sar Apis</i> is forbidden <b>only when it is holding a dry measure and measuring</b> with it; <b>and</b> the figure of a nursing woman is forbidden <b>only when she is holding a child and nursing</b> it.

### Part 6
§ <b>The Sages taught: What is a figure of a dragon? Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar explained:</b> It is <b>any</b> figure <b>that has scales between its joints. Rabbi Asi motioned</b> with his hands to depict scales <b>between the joints of the neck. Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Once, I was following Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the Distinguished on the road, and he found a ring there, and there was a figure of a dragon on it. And he</b> then <b>encountered a minor gentile boy, but did not say anything to him. He</b> then <b>encountered an adult gentile, and said to him: Revoke</b> the ring’s idolatrous status. <b>But</b> the gentile <b>did not revoke it.</b> Rabbi Elazar HaKappar then <b>slapped him</b> across his face, whereupon the gentile succumbed <b>and revoked</b> its idolatrous status.

### Part 8
The Gemara comments: <b>Learn from</b> this incident the following <b>three</b> <i>halakhot</i>: <b>Learn from it</b> that <b>a gentile can revoke</b> the idolatrous status of both <b>his</b> object of <b>idol worship and that of another</b> gentile. <b>And learn from</b> the fact that Rabbi Elazar HaKappar waited to find an adult gentile, that only one who <b>is aware of the nature of idol worship and its accessories can revoke</b> the idol’s status, <b>but</b> one <b>who is not aware of the nature of idol worship and its accessories,</b> such as a minor, <b>cannot revoke</b> the idol’s status. <b>And</b> finally, <b>learn from it</b> that <b>a gentile can revoke</b> the status of an idol even <b>against his will.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina ridiculed</b> this ruling and asked: <b>But</b> why was it necessary to have a gentile actively revoke the idolatrous status of the ring? <b>Doesn’t Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the Distinguished maintain</b> in accordance with <b>that which we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who saves</b> an object <b>from a lion, or from a bear, or from a cheetah, or from a troop</b> of soldiers, <b>or from a river, or from the tide of the sea, or from the flooding of a river, or</b> similarly <b>one who finds</b> an object <b>in a main thoroughfare or</b> in <b>a large plaza, or</b> for that matter, <b>anywhere frequented by the public,</b> in all these cases, the objects belong <b>to him, because the owners despair of</b> recovering <b>them?</b> Therefore, in the case of a lost ring with an idolatrous figure on it, its idolatrous status is automatically revoked, as its owner despairs of recovering it.

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said: Granted,</b> the owner <b>despairs of</b> recovering the object <b>itself, but does he despair of</b> its <b>forbidden [<i>me’issura</i>]</b> idolatrous status? The owner does not assume that the object will never be worshipped again; rather, <b>he says</b> to himself: <b>If a gentile finds it, he will worship it. If a Jew finds it, since it is valuable, he will sell it to a gentile who will</b> then <b>worship it.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Elazar HaKappar had to have the ring’s idolatrous status revoked.

### Part 11
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Rosh HaShana</i> 24a): <b>Rabban Gamliel had</b> diagrams of the different <b>figures of moons</b> drawn <b>on a tablet</b> that hung <b>on the wall of his attic, which he would show to the ordinary</b> people <b>[<i>hahedyotot</i>]</b> who came to testify about sighting the new moon but who were unable to adequately describe what they had seen. <b>And he would say to them: Did you see</b> an image <b>like this, or did you see</b> an image <b>like that?</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> it <b>permitted</b> to form these figures? <b>But isn’t it written: “You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver, or gods of gold” (Exodus 20:20), which is interpreted to mean: <b>You shall not make figures of My attendants who serve before Me,</b> i.e., those celestial bodies that were created to serve God, including the sun and the moon.

### Part 13
In answering, <b>Abaye said: The Torah prohibited only</b> the figures of those <b>attendants that</b> one can <b>possibly reproduce</b> something that is truly <b>in their likeness.</b> Since it is impossible to reproduce the sun and the moon, the prohibition does not apply to these entities.

### Part 14
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not construct a house</b> in the exact <b>image of the Sanctuary,</b> nor <b>a portico</b> in the exact <b>image of the Entrance Hall</b> of the Sanctuary, nor <b>a courtyard corresponding to the Temple courtyard,</b> nor <b>a table corresponding to the Table</b> in the Temple, nor <b>a candelabrum corresponding to the Candelabrum</b> in the Temple. <b>But</b> one <b>may fashion</b> a candelabrum <b>of five or of six or of eight</b> lamps. <b>And</b> one <b>may not fashion</b> a candelabrum <b>of seven</b> lamps <b>even</b> if he constructs it <b>from other kinds of metal</b> rather than gold, as in extenuating circumstances the Candelabrum in the Temple may be fashioned from other metals.

### Part 15
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: One may not fashion a candelabrum of wood either, in the manner that</b> the kings of <b>the Hasmonean monarchy fashioned</b> it. When they first purified the Temple they had to fashion the Candelabrum out of wood as no other material was available. Since a wooden candelabrum is fit for the Temple, it is prohibited to fashion one of this kind for oneself.

### Part 16
The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda: Do you seek to cite <b>a proof from there,</b> i.e., from the Hasmonean era, that a candelabrum fashioned of wood is fit for the Temple? During that era the branches of the Candelabrum <b>were</b> fashioned from <b>spits [<i>shappudin</i>] of iron, and they covered</b> them <b>with tin [<i>beva’atz</i>].</b> Later, when <b>they grew richer</b> and could afford a Candelabrum of higher-quality material, <b>they fashioned</b> the Candelabrum <b>from silver.</b> When <b>they grew even richer, they fashioned</b> the Candelabrum <b>from gold.</b> In any event, Abaye proves from this <i>baraita</i> that the prohibition against forming a figure applies only to items that can be reconstructed in an accurate manner. Since this is not possible in the case of the moon, Rabban Gamliel’s figures were permitted.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>And is it</b> actually <b>permitted</b> to fashion figures of those <b>attendants</b> of God concerning <b>which it is impossible to reproduce their likeness? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver” (Exodus 20:20), is interpreted to mean: <b>You shall not make figures of My attendants who serve before Me on high?</b> Apparently, this includes the sun and the moon.

### Part 18
