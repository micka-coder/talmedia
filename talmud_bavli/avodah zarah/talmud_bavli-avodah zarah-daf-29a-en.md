<b>for facial wounds, but the reverse</b> presents <b>a danger.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Vinegar</b> is good <b>for</b> one to consume <b>after bloodletting, and</b> eating <b>small fish</b> is good <b>for</b> one who has completed <b>a fast, but the reverse</b> is <b>a danger.</b> Eating <b>cress and</b> then undergoing <b>bloodletting</b> poses <b>a danger.</b> With regard to one who suffers from <b>a fever and</b> undergoes <b>bloodletting,</b> this poses <b>a danger</b> to his life. Similarly, one who suffers from <b>pain of the eye and</b> undergoes <b>bloodletting endangers</b> to his life. On the <b>second</b> day <b>after</b> eating <b>fish</b> one may let <b>blood,</b> and on the <b>second</b> day <b>after</b> letting <b>blood</b> one may eat <b>fish.</b> With regard to eating fish on the <b>third</b> day <b>after</b> letting blood, or letting blood on the third day after eating fish, both of these actions pose <b>a danger.</b>

### Part 3
§ The Gemara presents a series of health-related statements. <b>The Sages taught: One who lets blood may not eat</b> the following foods, corresponding to the acronym <b><i>ḥet</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>shin</i>.</b> That is, he may consume <b>neither milk [<i>ḥalav</i>], nor cheese [<i>gevina</i>], nor onions [<i>betzalim</i>], nor cress [<i>sheḥalim</i>]. If he ate</b> one of these, <b>Abaye said:</b> He <b>should bring a quarter</b><i>-log</i> <b>of vinegar and a quarter</b><i>-log</i> <b>of wine and mix them together and drink</b> the mixture. <b>And when he defecates, he should defecate only toward the east of the city, because the odor</b> of the excrement after that treatment <b>is offensive.</b> Since the wind does not usually blow from the east, it is less likely to spread the stench.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: One may lift</b> the <b><i>unkali</i> on Shabbat.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <b><i>unkali</i>? Rabbi Abba said:</b> It is the <b>edge of the ribs [<i>istumkha</i>] near the heart</b> which sometimes bend inward, in which case they must be lifted and straightened into their proper position. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>the cure</b> for one whose <i>unkali</i> has been bent? He should <b>take cumin, caraway, mint [<i>ninya</i>], wormwood, satureja, and hyssop.</b>

### Part 5
This remedy is beneficial for several ailments, and the Gemara presents each of these in turn: <b>For</b> curing the <b>heart,</b> the above combination should be taken <b>with wine, and your mnemonic</b> for this is the verse: <b>“And wine that makes glad the heart of man”</b> (Psalms 104:15). <b>For</b> curing an ailment that arises due to <b>the wind [<i>ruḥa</i>],</b> one drinks the mixture <b>in water, and your mnemonic</b> for this is the verse: <b>“And the spirit [<i>ruaḥ</i>] of God hovered over the face of the waters”</b> (Genesis 1:2). <b>For childbirth [<i>lekhuda</i>],</b> a woman in labor drinks the mixture <b>with beer [<i>shikhra</i>], and your mnemonic</b> for this is the verse: <b>“With her pitcher [<i>vekhadah</i>] upon her shoulder [<i>shikhmah</i>]”</b> (Genesis 24:15).

### Part 6
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, ground all of these together and took a handful of</b> the mixture <b>and drank it. Rav Ashi ground each and every one</b> of the herbs <b>separately and he took all</b> that he could hold between <b>his large finger and his small finger</b> and drank it. <b>Rav Pappa said: I tried all these</b> remedies <b>and I was not healed until a certain Arab said to me: Bring a new jug and fill it with water and place in it a ladle [<i>tarvada</i>] of honey that is suspended among the stars,</b> i.e., add the ladle at night, <b>and drink it on the next day.</b> Rav Pappa concludes: <b>I did this and I was healed.</b>

### Part 7
<b>The Sages taught: Six items heal a sick person from his illness and their cure is</b> a permanent <b>cure, and these are: Cabbage, beets, water</b> in which <b>dried chamomile</b> was soaked, and <b>the stomach</b> contents <b>of</b> an animal, and <b>the womb</b> of an animal, <b>and the lobe of the liver. And some say: Small fish</b> are <b>also</b> included in this list. <b>And moreover,</b> eating <b>small fish causes a person’s entire body to flourish and to grow.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Ten items return a sick person to his illness, and his illness</b> becomes even more <b>severe</b> than it originally was, and <b>they are: One who eats ox meat, fat, roasted meat, bird meat, and a roasted egg, and cress; and</b> the act of <b>shaving, and bathing, and</b> the consumption of <b>cheese, and liver. And some say: Nuts</b> are <b>also</b> included in this list. <b>And some say: Cucumbers</b> are <b>also</b> included in this list. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Why are they called cucumbers [<i>kishu’in</i>]? Because they are as harmful [<i>kashin</i>] to a person’s entire body as swords.</b>

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And one may not have his hair cut by</b> gentiles <b>anywhere. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A Jew who has his hair cut by a gentile</b> should <b>observe</b> the gentile’s actions <b>in a mirror</b> while he cuts his hair. <b>And</b> in the case of <b>a gentile who has his hair cut by a Jew, when</b> the Jew <b>reaches</b> the gentile’s <b>forelock he removes his hand</b> and does not cut it, because it is associated with idol worship.

### Part 10
<b>The Master said: A Jew who has his hair cut by a gentile</b> should <b>observe</b> the gentile’s actions <b>in a mirror.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If</b> it is referring to a haircut performed <b>in a public domain, why do I</b> need <b>a mirror?</b> After all, the gentile will not harm a Jew in public. <b>And if</b> it occurs <b>in a private domain,</b> even if the Jews <b>observes</b> the gentile’s actions, <b>what of it?</b> How does the fact that the Jew is watching prevent the gentile barber from harming him? The Gemara explains: <b>Actually,</b> this is referring to a haircut <b>in a private domain, but since there is a mirror</b> in place, the Jew <b>appears as an important person</b> whom the gentile will hesitate to attack.

### Part 11
The Gemara relates a relevant incident: <b>Rav Ḥana bar Bizna was having his hair cut by a gentile in</b> one of <b>the side streets of Neharde’a.</b> The barber <b>said to him: Ḥana, Ḥana; Your throat is appealing to the razor.</b> Rav Ḥana bar Bizna <b>said:</b> I have this <b>coming to me, as I violated</b> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> who stated that one may not have his hair cut by a gentile in any location.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And didn’t</b> Rav Ḥana bar Bizna <b>violate</b> the ruling <b>of the Rabbis</b> as well? <b>Say</b> that <b>when the Rabbis stated</b> that it is permitted to have one’s hair cut by a gentile, they were referring to a haircut performed <b>in a public domain;</b> but with regard to a haircut performed <b>in a private domain, did they say</b> that it is permitted? Since the side streets of Neharde’a cannot be considered a public domain, evidently Rav Ḥana bar Bizna violated the ruling of the Rabbis. The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> Rav Ḥana bar Bizna <b>maintains:</b> With regard to <b>the side streets of Neharde’a, since many people are present</b> there, <b>they are similar to a public domain,</b> and it would therefore be permitted to have one’s hair cut there according to the opinion of the Rabbis.

### Part 13
The <i>baraita</i> stated: <b>And</b> in the case of <b>a gentile who has his hair cut by a Jew, when</b> the Jew <b>reaches</b> the gentile’s <b>forelock, he removes his hand</b> and does not cut it, because it is associated with idol worship. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> space should the Jew leave around the forelock? <b>Rav Malkiyya says</b> that <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says: Three fingerbreadths in each and every direction.</b>

### Part 14
In addition to Rav Malkiyya, whose ruling was just cited, there was another <i>amora</i> known as Rav Malkiyyu. In order to avoid confusing the two, the Gemara records their respective rulings. <b>Rav Ḥanina, son of Rav Ika, says:</b> The statements concerning <b>a skewer, maidservants, and follicles</b> were issued by <b>Rav Malkiyyu;</b> the rulings concerning <b>a forelock, burnt ashes, and cheese</b> were stated by <b>Rav Malkiyya.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> a different opinion: Statements from the <b>Mishna and <i>baraita</i></b> were issued by <b>Rav Malkiyya,</b> whereas rulings of <b><i>halakha</i></b> that are not related to a mishna or <i>baraita</i> were taught by <b>Rav Malkiyyu. And the mnemonic</b> to remember this is: <b>The Mishna is a queen [<i>malketa</i>],</b> i.e., the statements that are referring to a mishna were made by Rav Malkiyya, whose name is similar to the Aramaic term for queen. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Rav Ḥanina and Rav Pappa? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>maidservants.</b> According to Rav Ḥanina, this <i>halakha</i> was stated by Rav Malkiyyu, whereas Rav Pappa holds that it was taught by Rav Malkiyya, as it is referring to a dispute in a mishna.
