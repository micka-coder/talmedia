that was used for cooking <b>that same day</b> by a gentile, <b>as</b> in such a case, <b>it does not impart flavor</b> to food cooked in it <b>to</b> the <b>detriment</b> of the mixture.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>from that</b> point <b>onward</b> the pot <b>should be permitted,</b> as on the following day the taste of the non-kosher food imparted by the pot is already to the detriment of the food. The Gemara answers: There is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> that prohibits use of <b>a pot that</b> was <b>not</b> used by a gentile <b>that same day, due to</b> concern that one will use <b>a pot</b> used by a gentile <b>that same day.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, who holds that even if the imparted flavor is to the detriment of the permitted food nevertheless it is forbidden, <b>even</b> the flavor imparted by <b>a pot</b> that was used <b>that same day</b> is <b>detrimental</b> to the flavor of the food, and still the Torah deems it forbidden, which proves that if a forbidden substance imparts flavor to a permitted food to its detriment, the permitted food is forbidden.

### Part 4
§ <b>Rav Amram raises a contradiction before Rav Sheshet: We learned</b> in the mishna: With regard to <b>the spits and the grill, one must heat them until white-hot in the fire. But it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 97a) <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> meat: <b>The spit and the grill</b> that were used to roast sacrificial meat may not be used again after the time for eating that particular offering has passed, as the leftover taste of the offering in these utensils is forbidden, unless <b>one purges them in hot water.</b> Apparently, heating them until white-hot is unnecessary.

### Part 5
Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: Amram, my son,</b> what has the <b>matter</b> of <b>sacrificial</b> meat to do <b>with</b> vessels of <b>gentiles</b> that require <b>purging? Here,</b> in the case of sacrificial meat, the utensils <b>absorbed a permitted</b> food that subsequently became forbidden, and therefore purging in hot water is sufficient. <b>There,</b> in the case of utensils acquired from gentiles, the utensils <b>absorbed a forbidden</b> food, and so they must be heated until white-hot.

### Part 6
<b>Rava</b> disagreed, <b>saying: Ultimately,</b> even in the case of sacrificial meat, <b>when it emits</b> flavor, <b>it emits a forbidden</b> flavor, so what difference does it make that it was permitted when it was absorbed? <b>Rather, Rava said: What</b> is meant by the <b>purging</b> stated with regard to sacrificial meat? It means that besides heating it until white-hot, <b>rinsing and scouring</b> it are <b>also</b> required, as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to any utensil used with sacrificial meat, as the verse states: “It shall be scoured and rinsed in water” (Leviticus 6:21).

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said to him: Are</b> rinsing and scouring <b>comparable</b> to purging? <b>Scouring and rinsing</b> are done <b>in cold</b> water, whereas <b>purging</b> is done <b>in hot</b> water. Therefore, this is not a valid interpretation of the term purging. <b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that the Mishna employs the style of: <b>Its counterpart reveals about it</b> (see Job 36:33), as follows: The Mishna <b>taught here</b> that the spit and the grill require <b>heating until white-hot, and the same is true of purging,</b> which is also required. The Mishna <b>taught there</b> that <b>purging</b> the spit and the grill is necessary, <b>and the same is true of heating until white-hot.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rava said to him: If so, let</b> the Mishna <b>teach all of</b> these requirements <b>in one</b> of the places, <b>and let it teach</b> only <b>one</b> of them <b>in the other, and</b> then <b>let us say</b> that the Mishna employs the style of: <b>Its counterpart reveals about it.</b> The principle that one mishna supplements the other can apply when all of the information is stated in one of the two places, but not when each has only part of it.

### Part 9
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> meat, <b>this is</b> the <b>reason</b> that <b>its</b> utensils do not require heating until white-hot: It is <b>in accordance with that which Rav Naḥman</b> says that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says, as he says: Each and every day constitutes purging for the other</b> day, i.e., the previous day. Since the designated time for eating the meat of a peace-offering ends the day after it is sacrificed, using the utensils every day for an offering sacrificed on that day guarantees that the taste of every offering is expelled from the utensils before they becomes forbidden, by using them with fire on the following day. Therefore the utensils do not require special heating until white-hot in fire in order to become permitted for subsequent use.

### Part 10
The Gemara raises an objection: This <b>works out well</b> with regard to <b>peace-offerings, as, since</b> their meat <b>may be eaten over two days, purging is</b> achieved <b>before they become leftover</b> sacrificial meat, which is forbidden. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a sin-offering, since</b> its meat <b>may be eaten</b> only <b>over</b> the course of <b>a day and a night, when one cooks</b> the meat of <b>a sin-offering with</b> the utensil <b>now, it becomes leftover</b> the next morning. And <b>when one cooks with it again the next day, whether</b> the meat of <b>a peace-offering or a sin-offering,</b> the utensil <b>expels the leftover</b> taste <b>of the sin-offering</b> sacrificed <b>now into</b> the meat of <b>the sin-offering or peace-offering</b> sacrificed <b>the next day,</b> and it should be forbidden.

### Part 11
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>It is not necessary</b> to purge the utensil by heating it until white-hot even if it was used for the meat of a sin-offering; it is possible to avoid such a requirement, <b>as when one cooks a sin-offering with</b> the utensil <b>now,</b> he can <b>then cook</b> the meat of <b>a peace-offering with</b> the same utensil <b>now,</b> i.e., on the same day, and the taste of the sin-offering is consequently expelled from the utensil on that same day.

### Part 12
Then, when the taste of the peace-offering is absorbed, it creates a situation <b>where the</b> designated <b>times for</b> eating the meat of <b>the sin-offering of the next day and</b> the meat of <b>the peace-offering of the previous day are complete simultaneously.</b> It is therefore possible to use the utensil for cooking the meat of a sin-offering the next day without having to purge it from the taste of the previous day’s offerings. <b>And one can then cook</b> the meat of <b>a peace-offering</b> with the utensil <b>the next day,</b> thereby expelling from it the taste of the sin-offering of that day, and repeat this practice day after day.

### Part 13
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>If so,</b> if each day the utensil expels the taste of the sacrificial meat that has not become leftover, then <b>purging</b> it with boiling water <b>is also unnecessary.</b> Why, then, does the mishna require purging with boiling water? The Gemara comments: This poses <b>a difficulty</b> to Rava’s explanation.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that there is another resolution to the contradiction between <i>mishnayot</i>: In <b>this</b> case of a gentile’s spit and grill, because it is a utensil that is not in continual use, it <b>becomes crusty</b> and must be heated until white-hot; but <b>that</b> utensil used for sacrificial meat is in continual use, so it <b>does not become crusty.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rav Ashi said: Actually,</b> the contradiction should be resolved <b>as we said from the outset,</b> as explained by Rav Sheshet: <b>There,</b> in the case of sacrificial meat, the utensils <b>absorbed a permitted</b> food that subsequently became forbidden, and therefore purging is sufficient. <b>Here,</b> in the case of utensils acquired from gentiles, the utensils <b>absorbed a forbidden</b> food, and so they must be heated until white-hot.

### Part 16
<b>And</b> as for <b>that which</b> poses <b>a difficulty for you, that at the time</b> that the utensil <b>expels</b> flavor, <b>it expels</b> the flavor of <b>a forbidden</b> food, the answer is that <b>at the time it expels</b> flavor, the <b>forbidden</b> food <b>is nonexistent in its substantive form.</b> Since the forbidden substance expelled from the utensil is not the forbidden food itself but only its flavor, it is treated leniently, and therefore the fact that it was permitted at the time it was absorbed in the utensil is taken into account.

### Part 17
§ Returning to the mishna, the Gemara asks: <b>And how much does one heat</b> utensils to make <b>them white-hot? Rabbi Mani says: Until they shed their outer layer. And how does one purge</b> utensils with boiling water? <b>Rav Huna says:</b> One immerses <b>a small kettle inside a large kettle</b> of boiling water.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does one do with <b>a large kettle?</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer from an incident <b>involving a certain cauldron that was</b> in <b>the house of Rav Akavya</b> and required purging. <b>He surrounded it</b>
