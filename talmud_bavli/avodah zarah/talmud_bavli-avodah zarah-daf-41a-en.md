### Part 1
<b>Rabba says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis is only <b>with regard to</b> statues that are erected <b>in villages. But with regard to</b> those that are erected <b>in cities, all agree</b> that they <b>are permitted,</b> i.e., that it is permitted to derive benefit from them. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is because they were <b>fashioned for ornamental</b> purposes and not for worship.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to those erected <b>in villages, is there anyone who says</b> that <b>they are fashioned for ornamental</b> purposes? Those <b>in villages were certainly fashioned for</b> idol <b>worship.</b> How, then, can the Rabbis maintain that such statues are permitted?

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, if</b> such a distinction <b>was stated, this</b> is what <b>was stated: Rabba says</b> that the <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis is only <b>with regard to</b> statues that are erected <b>in cities,</b> where they may have been fashioned simply for ornamental purposes. <b>But with regard to</b> those erected <b>in villages, all agree</b> that they are used for idol worship and are therefore <b>forbidden.</b>

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The <b>only</b> statues that are <b>forbidden</b> are: Any statue that has in its hand a staff, or a bird, or an orb, as these are indications that this statue is designated for idolatry. The Gemara explains that each of these items symbolizes the statue’s supposed divinity, indicating its dominion over the world: <b>A staff</b> symbolizes dominion <b>as</b> the idol <b>rules itself under the entire world,</b> i.e., it rules the entire world, <b>like</b> one rules over an animal with <b>a staff. A bird</b> symbolizes dominion <b>as</b> the idol <b>grasps itself under the entire world,</b> i.e., it grasps the entire world, <b>as</b> one grasps <b>a bird</b> in his hand. <b>An orb</b> symbolizes dominion <b>as</b> the idol <b>grasps itself under the entire world,</b> i.e., it grasps the entire world, <b>as</b> one grasps <b>a ball</b> in his hand.

### Part 5
The Sages <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (6:1) that <b>they added</b> the following <b>to</b> the list of items that, when added to a statue, indicate that it is worshipped as an idol: <b>A sword</b> in its hand, <b>a crown</b> on its head, <b>and a ring</b> on its finger.

### Part 6
The Gemara explains why these items were initially believed to be insignificant and were later understood as symbolizing idol worship. With regard to a statue holding <b>a sword,</b> the Sages <b>initially thought</b> that this <b>merely</b> indicates that it is a statue of <b>a bandit. But in the end they reasoned that</b> it symbolizes the notion that the idol has the power to <b>kill itself under the whole world,</b> i.e., to kill the entire world.

### Part 7
With regard to <b>a crown,</b> the Sages <b>initially thought</b> that it is <b>merely a woven wreath. But in the end they reasoned</b> that it is <b>like the crown of a king.</b> With regard to <b>a ring,</b> the Sages <b>initially thought</b> that this <b>merely</b> symbolizes <b>the bearer of a signet ring [<i>ishtayema</i>]. But in the end they reasoned that</b> it is symbolic of the idol’s supposed ability to <b>seal its</b> fate <b>under the whole world,</b> i.e., to seal the fate of the entire world, <b>for death.</b>

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> says: It is prohibited to derive benefit even from any statue that has any item whatsoever in its hand. The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is prohibited to derive benefit from a statue <b>even</b> if it is merely holding <b>a stone,</b> or <b>even a twig.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> If the idol <b>is grasping excrement in its hand, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this meant to honor the statue, indicating that it is an object of idol worship? <b>Do we say</b> that the statue is forbidden, as this indicates that <b>the entire world is inferior to it like excrement, or perhaps</b> does this indicate that the idol itself <b>is inferior to the entire world like excrement?</b> The Gemara concludes: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who finds</b> unidentifiable <b>fragments of statues, these are permitted,</b> i.e., one may derive benefit from them. If one <b>found</b> an object in <b>the figure of a hand or</b> in <b>the figure of a foot, these are forbidden, as</b> objects <b>similar to those are worshipped.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Shmuel says:</b> It is permitted to derive benefit <b>even</b> from <b>fragments of</b> objects that have been seen used in <b>idol worship.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>fragments of</b> nondescript <b>statues</b> are permitted? This indicates that it is prohibited to derive benefit from fragments of idols that were known to be worshipped.

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: The mishna means that fragments of statues are permitted, and <b>the same is true even</b> of <b>fragments</b> of objects <b>of idol worship. And that which is taught</b> in the mishna: <b>Fragments of statues,</b> is not meant to exclude fragments of idols. Rather, this expression is used <b>because</b> the mishna <b>sought to teach</b> in <b>the last clause:</b> If one <b>found</b> an object in <b>the figure of a hand</b> or in <b>the figure of a foot, these are forbidden,</b> even if they are not known to be objects of idol worship, <b>as</b> objects <b>similar to those are worshipped.</b> If the first clause in the mishna had referred to fragments of idols, it would have been inferred that the latter clause was referring specifically to the figure of a hand or foot that was known to have been worshipped, and that otherwise such figures would not be forbidden.

### Part 13
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If one <b>found</b> an object in <b>the figure of a hand</b> or in <b>the figure of a foot, these are forbidden, as</b> objects <b>similar to those are worshipped.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why?</b>
