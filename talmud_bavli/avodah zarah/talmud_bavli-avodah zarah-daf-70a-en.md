### Part 1
but <b>the passion for wine</b> used for <b>a libation does not overwhelm their</b> judgment, and they will not allow her to use it for a libation. In the case of <b>a Jewish prostitute and gentiles dining</b> with her, <b>the wine</b> is <b>forbidden. What is the reason?</b> It is that <b>since she is contemptible in their</b> eyes, <b>she is subjugated to them,</b> and they use the wine for a libation without consideration for her.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara relates: There was an incident involving <b>a certain house where Jews’ wine was stored. A gentile entered</b> the house, and <b>he locked the door before</b> the Jew, <b>but there was a crack in the door,</b> and <b>the gentile was found standing between the barrels. Rava said: All</b> the barrels <b>that were opposite the crack</b> through which the gentile could be seen are <b>permitted,</b> because he would have been wary about being seen tampering with them. Barrels <b>on this side and that side</b> of the crack, where the gentile could not be seen, are <b>forbidden,</b> as perhaps the gentile used them for a libation.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates: There was an incident involving <b>a certain Jew’s wine that was stored in</b> the lower story of <b>a house,</b> in <b>which the Jew was living in the upper</b> story <b>and a gentile in the lower</b> story, and the wine could be supervised from the upper story. One day the residents <b>heard a sound of quarreling</b> and <b>went outside. The gentile came</b> back in <b>first</b> and <b>locked the door before</b> the Jew. <b>Rava said: The wine</b> is <b>permitted,</b> because the gentile presumably <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Just as I came</b> back in <b>early,</b> perhaps my neighbor the <b>Jew came</b> back in <b>early and is sitting in the upper</b> story <b>and watching me,</b> and therefore he would not use the wine for a libation.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates: There was an incident involving <b>a certain inn [<i>ushpiza</i>] where a Jew’s wine was stored,</b> and <b>a gentile was found sitting among the barrels. Rava said: If he was caught as a thief,</b> i.e., if the gentile seemed startled and did not have a good explanation for being there, the wine is <b>permitted,</b> as the gentile was presumably afraid about being caught and would not have used it for a libation. <b>But if not,</b> the wine is <b>forbidden.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara relates: There was an incident involving <b>a certain house where wine was stored. A gentile was found standing among the barrels. Rava said: If he has</b> a way <b>to excuse</b> his entrance to where the wine was stored, <b>the wine</b> is <b>forbidden, but if not, the wine</b> is <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this ruling from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>an inn was locked</b> and a gentile was inside, <b>or</b> if the Jew <b>said to</b> the gentile: <b>Safeguard</b> my wine, the wine is <b>forbidden. What, is it not</b> forbidden <b>even if</b> the gentile <b>does not have</b> a way <b>to excuse</b> his entrance? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a situation <b>where he does have</b> a way <b>to excuse</b> his entrance; otherwise the wine is permitted.

### Part 6
The Gemara relates: There was an incident involving <b>a certain Jew and</b> a certain <b>gentile who were sitting and drinking wine.</b> The <b>Jew heard the sound of praying at the synagogue. He got up and went</b> to pray. <b>Rava said: The wine</b> is <b>permitted,</b> because the gentile presumably <b>said</b> to himself: Any moment <b>now he will remember his wine and come back.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara relates: There was an incident involving <b>a certain Jew and</b> a certain <b>gentile who were sitting on a ship.</b> The <b>Jew heard the sound of the shofar of twilight</b> indicating the beginning of Shabbat. <b>He disembarked and went</b> into town to spend Shabbat there. <b>Rava said: The wine</b> is <b>permitted,</b> because the gentile presumably <b>said</b> to himself: Any moment <b>now he will remember his wine and come back.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara comments: <b>And if</b> one might object that the gentile is presumably not concerned <b>because</b> he knows that the Jew will not return until the end of <b>Shabbat, didn’t Rava say: Issur the Convert told me: When we were</b> still <b>gentiles,</b> before converting, <b>we</b> used to <b>say: Jews do not</b> actually <b>observe Shabbat, as, if they observe Shabbat, how many wallets would be found in the marketplace</b> that the Jews could not take on Shabbat? <b>And I did not know that we maintain</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says: One who finds a wallet on Shabbat may carry it</b> in increments of <b>less than four cubits.</b> Evidently, gentiles assume that a Jew would violate Shabbat for monetary gain.

### Part 9
The Gemara relates: There was an incident involving <b>a certain lion who roared in a winepress. A gentile heard</b> the roar and was frightened, and <b>he hid among the barrels</b> of wine. <b>Rava said: The wine</b> is <b>permitted,</b> because the gentile presumably <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Just as I am hiding, a Jew</b> might <b>also</b> be <b>hiding behind me and see me.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara relates: There was an incident involving <b>certain thieves who came to Pumbedita and opened many barrels</b> of wine. <b>Rava said: The wine</b> is <b>permitted. What is the reason? Most of the thieves</b> in Pumbedita <b>are Jews,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> follows the majority, and therefore the wine is not rendered forbidden. <b>There was</b> a similar <b>incident in Neharde’a, and Shmuel said: The wine</b> is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this? Perhaps it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says</b> with regard to cases of uncertainty concerning ritual purity that if the <b>uncertainty</b> is with regard to a person’s <b>entry</b> into a certain place, he is deemed <b>pure.</b>

### Part 12
This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 6:5): With regard to <b>one who enters into a valley during the rainy season,</b> i.e., winter, when people generally do not enter this area, <b>and</b> there was <b>ritual impurity in such and such a field, and</b> he <b>said:</b> I know <b>I walked to that place,</b> i.e., I walked in the valley, <b>but I do not know whether I entered that field</b> where the ritual impurity was <b>or whether I did not</b> enter, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> In a case of <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>entry,</b> i.e., it is uncertain whether he entered the area where the ritual impurity is located, he is <b>ritually pure.</b> But if he certainly entered the area where the ritual impurity is located and the <b>uncertainty</b> pertains to <b>contact</b> with the source of ritual impurity, he is <b>ritually impure.</b> Apparently, the ruling of Shmuel, that in a case where it is uncertain whether gentile thieves entered the house at all the wine is permitted, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.

### Part 13
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> it <b>is different there,</b> with regard to the wine barrels. <b>Since there are</b> thieves <b>who open</b> barrels <b>for the sake of</b> perhaps finding <b>money</b> in them and are not interested in the wine, <b>it is</b> a case of <b>compound uncertainty,</b> as it is uncertain whether the thieves were gentiles or Jews, and even if they were gentiles, it is uncertain whether or not they touched the wine. In a case of compound uncertainty, everyone agrees that the wine is not forbidden.
