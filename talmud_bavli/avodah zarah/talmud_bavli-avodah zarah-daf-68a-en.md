and any carcass <b>that is unfit</b> even <b>for a <i>ger</i></b> <i>toshav</i> to consume, e.g., one that turned rancid and is unfit for consumption, <b>is not called an unslaughtered carcass</b> with regard to its prohibition.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> what can <b>Rabbi Meir</b> respond to this? He could say: <b>That</b> verse is written <b>to exclude</b> meat that was <b>rancid at the outset,</b> i.e., that was not fit for consumption even before the animal’s death, due to a defect in the animal. By contrast, a carcass that was fit for consumption when the animal died and was consequently rendered forbidden remains forbidden even when it becomes rancid. <b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> could counter that meat that was <b>rancid at the outset does not need</b> specific <b>exclusion</b> by the verse, as <b>it is</b> considered as <b>mere dust</b> and does not fall under the category of an unslaughtered animal carcass.

### Part 3
§ <b>Ulla says:</b> This <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon is with regard to a forbidden food <b>that enhanced</b> the flavor of a dish when it first fell into it <b>and subsequently detracted</b> from its flavor. In this case Rabbi Meir deems the dish forbidden, since the forbidden food enhanced its flavor at the outset. <b>But</b> in a case of forbidden food that <b>detracted</b> from the flavor of the dish <b>at the outset, everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ḥagga raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Ulla</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: Forbidden <b>wine that fell into lentils, or</b> forbidden <b>vinegar that fell into split beans,</b> renders the food <b>forbidden. And Rabbi Shimon deems</b> them <b>permitted. But here</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the forbidden food <b>detracted</b> from the flavor of the dish <b>at the outset, and</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Ulla said: Ḥagga does not know what the Sages say,</b> yet <b>he raises an objection? Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the vinegar <b>fell into</b> the <b>cold split beans and</b> one subsequently <b>heated them,</b> in which case <b>it becomes like</b> a forbidden food <b>that enhanced</b> the flavor of the mixture <b>and subsequently detracted</b> from it, as vinegar enhances the flavor of cold split beans, <b>and it is</b> consequently <b>forbidden</b> according to Rabbi Meir.

### Part 6
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon is <b>with regard to</b> a case where the forbidden food <b>detracts</b> from the flavor of the permitted food <b>from the outset.</b>

### Part 7
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does Rabbi Yoḥanan mean that the <b>dispute is with regard to</b> a case where the forbidden food <b>detracts</b> from its flavor <b>from the outset, but</b> if it <b>enhanced</b> it at first <b>and subsequently detracted</b> from it, <b>everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>forbidden? Or, perhaps</b> he means that the <b>dispute</b> is <b>both in this</b> case <b>and in that</b> case. The Gemara comments: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Amram said: Is it possible</b> that <b>there is</b> substance <b>to this</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> i.e., that there is disagreement with regard to a case where the forbidden food detracts from the flavor of the permitted food from the outset, <b>but it is not taught in the Mishna?</b>

### Part 9
Rav Amram <b>went out, examined</b> the Mishna, <b>and discovered that</b> this dispute <b>is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 2:8): In the case of <b>non-sacred leaven that fell into the dough, and there is enough of it to cause</b> the dough <b>to become leavened, and</b> the dough indeed <b>became leavened, and subsequently leaven of <i>teruma</i>, or leaven of</b> forbidden <b>diverse kinds</b> planted <b>in a vineyard, fell</b> into this dough, <b>and there is enough of it to cause</b> the dough <b>to become leavened,</b> the dough is <b>forbidden,</b> because the forbidden leaven is considered to have contributed to the process of the leavening. <b>But Rabbi Shimon deems</b> the dough <b>permitted,</b> because the additional leaven has a negative impact on the dough, which was already leavened.

### Part 10
Rav Amram comments: <b>But here it is</b> a case <b>where</b> the forbidden substance <b>detracted</b> from the flavor of the dough <b>at the outset, and</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon <b>disagree,</b> as a mishna that is not attributed explicitly to a <i>tanna</i> represents the opinion of Rabbi Meir.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: Dough is different,</b> because even if the additional leaven is detrimental to its flavor, in any event the dough is enhanced, <b>since it is suitable for leavening several other</b> batches of <b>dough with it.</b> The more it is leavened, the more it is enhanced in terms of this purpose.

### Part 12
The Gemara suggests another source for the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>leaven of <i>teruma</i> and non-sacred</b> leaven <b>that fell into the dough,</b> if <b>this one</b> was <b>sufficient to cause</b> the dough <b>to become leavened and that one</b> was <b>sufficient to cause</b> the dough <b>to become leavened, and they</b> both <b>cause</b> the dough <b>to become leavened,</b> it is <b>forbidden. Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>permitted.</b> If the leaven <b>of <i>teruma</i> fell</b> in <b>first, everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>forbidden.</b> If the <b>non-sacred</b> leaven <b>fell</b> in first <b>and subsequently</b> the leaven <b>of <i>teruma</i> or of diverse kinds</b> that were planted <b>in a vineyard fell</b> in, this is also <b>forbidden; but Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara comments: <b>But here</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the forbidden substance <b>detracted</b> from the flavor of the dough <b>from the outset, and they disagree. And if you would say: Here too,</b>
