### Part 1
<b>“Shall I utterly consume all things from off the face of the earth? says the Lord. Shall I consume man and beast? Shall I consume the fowls of the heavens and the fish of the sea, and the stumbling blocks of the wicked,</b> and shall I cut off man from off the face of the earth? says the Lord” (Zephaniah 1:2–3). <b>Should</b> God <b>remove</b> objects of idol worship <b>from the world due to</b> the fact <b>that the wicked stumble because of them?</b> If so, He would have to destroy all of humanity as well, as <b>do not</b> idol worshippers also <b>worship people?</b> This is expressed in the continuation of the verse: <b>“And shall I cut off man from off the face of the earth?</b> says the Lord.”

### Part 2
§ <b>Agrippas</b> the <b>general asked Rabban Gamliel: It is written in your Torah</b> with regard to idol worship: <b>“For the Lord your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:24). <b>Doesn’t</b> jealousy arise <b>only</b> in the following cases: <b>A wise man</b> might be <b>jealous of</b> another <b>wise man, and a mighty</b> man might be jealous <b>of</b> another <b>mighty</b> man, <b>and a rich</b> man might be jealous <b>of</b> another <b>rich</b> man? If so, why is God jealous of objects of idol worship, which are not gods?

### Part 3
Rabban Gamliel <b>said to</b> Agrippas: <b>I will relate a parable to you. To what is this matter comparable?</b> It can be compared <b>to a person who married</b> a second <b>wife in addition to his</b> first <b>wife.</b> If the second wife is <b>more distinguished than</b> the first wife, the first wife <b>is not jealous of her,</b> and she does not feel anger toward her husband. But if the second wife is <b>less distinguished than</b> the first wife, <b>she is jealous of her.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Zunin said to Rabbi Akiva:</b> Both <b>my heart and your heart know that there is no substance to idol worship.</b> Nevertheless, <b>don’t we see people who go</b> with <b>broken</b> limbs to worship idols <b>and come</b> back <b>when they are whole? What is the reason</b> for this?

### Part 5
Rabbi Akiva <b>said to</b> Zunin: <b>I will relate a parable to you. To what is this matter comparable?</b> It can be compared <b>to a trusted person who was in</b> a certain <b>city, and all the residents of his city would deposit</b> items and money <b>with him,</b> even <b>not in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses. And</b> there was <b>one man</b> who did not trust him, who <b>came and</b> specifically <b>deposited</b> money <b>with him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses.</b> On <b>one occasion,</b> that person <b>forgot and deposited</b> money <b>with him not in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses.</b> The trusted man’s <b>wife said to him: Come, let us deny</b> that he deposited the money with us, as there are no witnesses. The man <b>said to her: Should we lose our credibility</b> and act deceitfully just <b>because this fool acted improperly</b> and did not require the presence of witnesses?

### Part 6
<b>So too,</b> with regard to different forms of <b>suffering, at the time when they are sent to</b> afflict <b>the person, an oath is administered to them</b> as follows: Take an oath <b>that you shall not go</b> and afflict the person <b>except on such and such a day. And you shall not leave</b> him <b>except on such and such a day, at such and such an hour, by means of so-and-so,</b> a specific doctor, <b>and by means of such and such a medicine. When the time came</b> for the suffering <b>to leave</b> him, <b>this</b> sick man <b>went to a temple of idol worship. The</b> forms of <b>suffering said:</b> By <b>right we should not leave</b> him. <b>But then they say: Should we lose</b> the fulfillment of <b>our oath</b> just <b>because this fool is acting improperly?</b>

### Part 7
<b>And this is</b> consistent with that <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “Then the Lord will make your plagues wonderful, and the plagues of your seed, even great plagues and faithful, <b>and evil and faithful sicknesses”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:59)? The term <b>“evil”</b> does not mean that the agent of sickness is in itself evil. Rather, this is referring <b>to its mission,</b> which is to cause harm. The term <b>“and faithful</b> sicknesses” indicates that the illnesses are faithful <b>to their oath</b> and adhere to the times designated for the affliction.

### Part 8
<b>Rava bar Rav Yitzḥak said to Rav Yehuda: Isn’t there a temple of idol worship in our locale, where, when the world is in need of rain,</b> the idol <b>appears to them in a dream, and it says to them: Slaughter a man</b> as an offering <b>to me, and I will bring rain. They</b> then <b>slaughter a man for it, and the rain comes.</b>

### Part 9
Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> Rava bar Rav Yitzḥak: <b>Now, were I dead I would not</b> have been able to <b>tell you</b> the explanation of <b>this matter.</b> It is therefore good that you reminded me of this matter while I am alive. The explanation is <b>as Rav says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And lest you lift up your eyes to the heavens, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heavens, you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them, <b>which the Lord your God has allotted [<i>ḥalak</i>] to all the nations</b> under the whole heaven” (Deuteronomy 4:19). The verse <b>teaches that</b> God allowed the nations to be <b>misled [<i>sheheḥelikan</i>] by matters</b> that seemingly indicate that idol worship is effective <b>in order to expel</b> the nations <b>from the world</b> due to their decision to engage in idol worship.

### Part 10
<b>And this is</b> consistent with that <b>which Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “If it concerns the scornful, He scorns them, but to the humble He gives grace”</b> (Proverbs 3:34)? One who <b>comes</b> in order <b>to become impure,</b> i.e., to sin, <b>they,</b> in Heaven, <b>provide him with an opening</b> to do so, and he is not prevented from sinning. If one <b>comes</b> in order <b>to become purified,</b> not only is he allowed to do so, but <b>they,</b> in Heaven, <b>assist him.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <b>may purchase from a gentile a winepress</b> in which the grapes have <b>been trodden</b> on, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that</b> the gentile <b>takes</b> grapes <b>in his hand</b> from the winepress <b>and places</b> them <b>on the pile</b> that remains to be trodden on. <b>And</b> the gentile’s touch <b>does not render</b> the juice of the grapes <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation</b> in idol worship, which is forbidden, <b>until it descends into the</b> collection <b>vat,</b> because until then it does not have the status of wine. Once the wine <b>descended into the</b> collection <b>vat, that which is in the vat</b> is <b>prohibited, and the rest,</b> which did not yet descend into the vat, is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 12
One <b>may tread</b> on grapes together <b>with the gentile in the winepress,</b>
