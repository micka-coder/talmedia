<b>canteens</b> belonging <b>to Arabs, after twelve months</b> of <b>the year they are permitted. Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, says:</b> With regard to <b>these Aramean grape pits, after twelve months</b> of <b>the year they are permitted. Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, says:</b> With regard to <b>these brown and black jugs, after twelve months</b> of <b>the year they are permitted.</b>

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches that <b>fish stew</b> is prohibited. <b>The Sages taught: Fish stew</b> prepared by <b>an expert is permitted,</b> as professionals do not mix wine in it. <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel: <i>Ḥilak</i></b> prepared by <b>an expert is also permitted.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Avimi, son of Rabbi Abbahu,</b> would <b>teach: Fish stew</b> prepared by <b>an expert is permitted. He</b> would <b>teach</b> this <i>baraita</i> that he received through tradition, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> would <b>say its</b> explanation: The <b>first time and</b> the <b>second</b> time that fish stew is prepared from a fish, it is <b>permitted,</b> but the <b>third</b> time it is <b>prohibited. What is the reason?</b> With regard to the <b>first time and</b> the <b>second</b> time, <b>as</b> the fish’s <b>oil is plentiful,</b> there is <b>no need to place wine in it. From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> one might <b>place wine in it</b> to compensate for the insufficient fish oil.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain boat</b> carrying <b>fish stew which came to the port of Akko,</b> and <b>Rabbi Abba from Akko placed guards over it</b> to ensure that no wine would be added to the fish stew. <b>Rava said to him: Until now, who guarded it?</b> Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: Until now, for what should we be concerned? If</b> the problem is <b>due to</b> the concern <b>that they mix wine in it,</b> that concern is unfounded, as in the place where this fish stew was produced, <b>a <i>kista</i> of fish stew</b> sells <b>for one <i>luma</i></b> while <b>a <i>kista</i> of wine</b> sells <b>for four <i>luma</i>.</b> Since wine was more expensive than fish stew, there is no reason to suspect that wine was added to the stew before it reached Akko, where fish stew is sold at a higher price than wine.

### Part 5
Upon hearing this, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira:</b> But <b>perhaps they came by means of Tyre, where wine is inexpensive</b> and therefore likely to be added to the fish stew to increase its volume. Rabbi Zeira <b>sad to him: There,</b> by way of Tyre, <b>there are impediments and melted</b> snow, which make travel very difficult, and the boat would not have sailed through that route.

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And cheese of Beit Unyaki</b> is prohibited. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: For what</b> reason <b>did they prohibit</b> deriving benefit from <b>the cheese of Beit Unyaki?</b> It is <b>because most</b> of the <b>calves of that city are slaughtered for</b> the sake of <b>idol worship,</b> and the milk curdled in their stomach contents is prohibited. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does this explanation <b>specifically</b> mention <b>most calves? Even</b> if <b>a minority</b> of calves were slaughtered for idol worship, this would <b>also</b> be reason enough, <b>as Rabbi Meir,</b> who is the <i>tanna</i> of unattributed opinions in a mishna, <b>is</b> generally <b>concerned about a minority.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara explains: <b>If you say</b> that the reason for the prohibition is due to <b>a majority</b> of calves slaughtered for idol worship, then despite the fact that the majority of animals in general used to curdle cheese are not slaughtered for idolatrous purposes, <b>there are</b> nevertheless <b>a minority</b> of animals altogether, i.e., the majority of calves, that are, and this minority of calves are cause for concern according to Rabbi Meir.

### Part 8
The Gemara continues: <b>But if you say</b> that Rabbi Meir prohibits the cheese due to <b>a minority</b> of calves, <b>since there are a majority of calves that are not slaughtered for idol worship, and there are also</b> a wider majority of the <b>remaining animals</b> used to curdle milk <b>that are not slaughtered for idol worship</b> at all, <b>this</b> would constitute <b>a minority of a minority, and Rabbi Meir is not concerned for a minority of a minority.</b> Since only a particular minority of animals used to curdle cheese, i.e., calves, are ever slaughtered for idolatry, and even within that group, only a minority are actually slaughtered, even Rabbi Meir would not be concerned.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Shimon bar Elyakim said to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish:</b> Even <b>when</b> calves <b>are slaughtered for</b> the sake of <b>idol worship, what of it? But are you</b> not <b>the one who permits</b> animals slaughtered with idolatrous intentions?

### Part 10
<b>As it was stated:</b> The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>one who slaughters an animal</b> in order <b>to sprinkle its blood for</b> the sake of <b>idol worship,</b> or <b>to burn its</b> prohibited <b>fat for idol worship,</b> is subject to a dispute between <i>amora’im</i>. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Deriving benefit from the animal is <b>prohibited,</b> as <b>he holds</b> that <b>one can intend from</b> one <b>rite to</b> another <b>rite.</b> In other words, idolatrous intent while slaughtering an animal renders it prohibited, even if the intention pertains not to the slaughter itself but to sprinkling the blood or burning the fat. <b>And</b> he maintains that <b>we derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> concerning intent <b>outside</b> the Temple <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> concerning intent <b>inside</b> the Temple. Since such intentions at the time of slaughter render an animal prohibited within the Temple, they render it prohibited outside the Temple as well, with regard to idol worship.

### Part 11
<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> Deriving benefit from the animal is <b>permitted.</b> Apparently, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish holds that slaughtering an animal for the sake of idol worship does not render it prohibited. This contradicts his previous assertion that it is prohibited to derive benefit from calves that have been slaughtered for the sake of idol worship.

### Part 12
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon bar Elyakim: <b>May your fortune be auspicious;</b> the case here is <b>where one says</b> that <b>he is worshipping</b> the idol <b>at the conclusion of the slaughter.</b> Since the act of slaughtering itself is an act of worship, the calf is rendered prohibited immediately.

### Part 13
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Rabbi Yishmael asked</b> Rabbi Yehoshua a series of questions. The Gemara notes that <b>Rav Aḥadevoi says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>by</b> giving her <b>the excrement of an ox that is</b> to be <b>stoned,</b> the woman is <b>betrothed,</b> provided that the excrement was worth one <i>peruta</i>. Although no benefit may be derived from the ox itself, it is permitted to derive benefit from its excrement. But if one attempts to betroth her <b>with the excrement of calves</b> that were used as offerings <b>of idol worship, she is not betrothed,</b> as even their excrement is forbidden. The Gemara remarks: <b>If you wish, propose logical reasoning, and if you wish, cite a verse</b> to substantiate this claim.

### Part 14
The Gemara elaborates: <b>If you wish, propose logical reasoning: With regard to calves</b> used <b>for idol worship,</b> a calf’s additional <b>girth</b> derived from the excrement stored in its body <b>is satisfactory for</b> the worshipper, as fatter animals are more impressive offerings. Since the excrement is part of the offering, it is also forbidden. <b>But with regard to an ox that is</b> to be <b>stoned, its</b> additional <b>girth is not satisfactory for</b> the owner, as he gains nothing from it.

### Part 15
<b>If you wish, cite a verse: It is written here,</b> with regard to an animal used for idol worship: <b>“And there shall cleave naught</b> of the dedicated thing <b>to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18), which indicates that the entire animal is forbidden. <b>And it is written there,</b> with regard to an ox to be stoned: <b>“The ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten”</b> (Exodus 21:28). This teaches that <b>its flesh is forbidden, but its excrement is permitted.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rava said: We learned both</b> of these <i>halakhot</i> from the mishna. He elaborates: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yishmael that cheese of gentiles is prohibited <b>because they curdle</b> it <b>in the stomach</b> contents <b>of</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass,</b> one can derive the <i>halakha</i> of the excrement of an ox that is to be stoned. The reason is that Rabbi Yishmael <b>responded to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>But isn’t the stomach of a burnt</b>-offering subject to a more <b>stringent</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>than the stomach of</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass,</b> and yet although one may not derive benefit from the stomach of a burnt-offering <i>ab initio</i>, if one did derive benefit from it he is not liable for misuse of property consecrated to the Temple?
