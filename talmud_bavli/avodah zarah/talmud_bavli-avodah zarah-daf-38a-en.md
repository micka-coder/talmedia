### Part 1
<b>Rather,</b> the cooking of gentiles is prohibited <b>by rabbinic law, and the verse</b> is cited as <b>a mere support.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara discusses the particulars of the prohibition against eating the cooking of gentiles. <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rav says: Any</b> item <b>that is eaten as it is,</b> i.e., <b>raw, is not subject to</b> the prohibition against eating <b>the cooking of gentiles.</b> The Gemara remarks: <b>In</b> the study hall in <b>Sura, they taught it this</b> way. <b>In Pumbedita, they taught it like this: Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rav says: Any</b> item <b>that is not eaten together with bread on the table of kings is not subject to</b> the prohibition against eating <b>the cooking of gentiles.</b> In other words, foods that are not eaten by distinguished individuals are not subject to this prohibition.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the practical difference <b>between</b> these two opinions? The practical difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to <b>small fish, mushrooms, and porridge.</b> These foods are not eaten raw, but they are not eaten by distinguished individuals. Consequently, these foods are prohibited according to the version taught in Sura, but permitted according to the version taught in Pumbedita.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Asi says</b> that <b>Rav says: Small, salted fish are not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>the cooking of gentiles,</b> because they can be eaten raw. <b>Rav Yosef says: If a gentile roasted</b> these fish, <b>a Jew may rely upon them for</b> use in the mitzva of <b>a joining of cooked foods,</b> which must be prepared in order to permit cooking for Shabbat on a Festival that occurs on a Friday. <b>And if a gentile made them</b> into <b><i>kasa deharsena</i>,</b> a dish of fish fried in oil and flour, the dish is <b>prohibited.</b> In this case, since the flour had not been edible, it is considered the cooked food of a gentile.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> What reason would there be to think that <i>kasa deharsena</i> prepared by a gentile is permitted? The Gemara answers: This is taught <b>lest you say</b> that the <b>salted fish,</b> which one is permitted to eat even if cooked by gentiles, is the <b>essential</b> component. Therefore, Rav Yosef <b>teaches us</b> that <b>the flour</b> is the <b>essential</b> component, and the dish is therefore considered the cooked food of a gentile.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Beruna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In the case of <b>a gentile who ignited a fire in the meadow, all the locusts that</b> were burned <b>in the meadow are prohibited.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If we say</b> that the reason they are prohibited is <b>that one no</b> longer <b>knows which are kosher and which are non-kosher</b> as a result of their burning, <b>why</b> does Rav Beruna <b>specifically</b> discuss a case involving <b>a gentile? Even</b> if <b>a Jew</b> burned the meadow, they would <b>also</b> be prohibited for the same reason. <b>Rather,</b> this is referring to a case where all the locusts were kosher, and the prohibition is <b>due to the cooking of gentiles,</b> as the locusts were effectively cooked by a gentile.

### Part 7
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Does anyone</b> actually <b>prohibit</b> the cooking of gentiles in <b>a case like this? But doesn’t Rav Ḥanan bar Ami say</b> that <b>Rabbi Pedat says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>this gentile who singed the head</b> of an animal, <b>it is permitted to eat</b> part <b>of it, even from the tip of the ear,</b> which is fully cooked? The Gemara remarks: <b>Evidently,</b> this is permitted because the gentile merely <b>intends to remove the hair</b> and not to cook the ears. <b>Here, too,</b> it ought to be permitted because he merely <b>intends to clear the meadow,</b> not to cook the locusts.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> this is referring to a case where there is a mixture of different types of locusts, and they are prohibited because one does <b>not know which are kosher and which are non-kosher. And</b> the reason Rav Beruna specified that the case involved a gentile is because <b>the incident that occurred</b> happened to have <b>occurred with</b> the involvement of <b>a gentile.</b>

### Part 9
§ The Gemara addresses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>this gentile who singed the head</b> of an animal, it is <b>permitted to eat</b> part <b>of it, even from the tip of the ear,</b> which is fully cooked. <b>Ravina said: Therefore,</b> with regard to <b>this gentile who threw</b> a moist <b>peg into the oven</b> in order to dry it out and harden it, <b>and a Jew had</b> already <b>inserted a gourd</b> in the oven <b>from the outset,</b> the gourd is <b>permitted,</b> even though it was in effect cooked by a gentile. The reason is that the gentile had no intention to cook the vegetable. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: It was necessary to teach this, <b>lest you say</b> that the gentile <b>intends to cook the vessel,</b> i.e., the peg, by softening it. Therefore Ravina <b>teaches us</b> that <b>he intends</b> only <b>to harden the vessel.</b>

### Part 10
§ The Gemara continues the discussion with regard to the cooking of gentiles by examining the <i>halakha</i> of meat cooked by both a gentile and a Jew. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>a Jew placed meat upon</b> flaming <b>coals and a gentile came and turned</b> the meat <b>over,</b> the meat is <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If we say that</b> it is a case where <b>if</b> the gentile <b>had not turned over</b> the meat <b>it would have cooked</b> anyway, it is <b>obvious</b> that the meat is permitted, as the gentile’s actions did not actually alter the food. The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather, is it not</b> a case <b>where, if</b> the gentile <b>had not turned it over, it would not have cooked?</b> But if so, <b>why is it permitted?</b> In such a case, the meat <b>is</b> certainly considered to be <b>the cooking of gentiles</b> and ought to be prohibited.

### Part 11
The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case <b>where if</b> the gentile <b>had not turned over</b> the meat, <b>it would have cooked in two hours, and now</b> that he did turn it over, <b>it will cook in</b> only <b>one hour. Lest you say</b> that <b>hastening the cooking</b> process <b>is</b> a significant <b>matter,</b> and therefore food whose preparation is expedited by a gentile is prohibited, Ravina <b>teaches us</b> otherwise.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Asi say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Any</b> item <b>that</b> has been cooked <b>like the food of ben Derosai,</b> i.e., partially cooked so that it is just about edible, <b>is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>the cooking of gentiles? Consequently,</b> if <b>it is not</b> cooked <b>like the food of ben Derosai, it is subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>the cooking of gentiles.</b> Accordingly, meat whose cooking was expedited by a gentile ought to be prohibited, as this ruling includes cases where it had not been cooked like the food of ben Derosai at the time of the gentile’s intervention.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> Rabbi Asi was referring to a case <b>where</b> the Jew <b>had placed</b> the meat that was not yet cooked like the food of ben Derosai <b>in a basket</b> where it would not have cooked at all, <b>and a gentile took it and placed it in the oven.</b> Rabbi Asi was teaching that in such a case, when the current cooking process has yet to begin, the meat is prohibited if it had not already been cooked like the food of ben Derosai. By contrast, in the case addressed by Rabbi Yehuda, the meat was already cooking and the gentile’s actions hastened the process, but did not initiate it. In other words, the issue of cooked food like the food of ben Derosai is relevant only if the gentile takes a dish that is not being cooked at present.

### Part 14
The Gemara adds: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A Jew may place meat on</b> hot <b>coals and</b> let <b>a gentile come and turn it over</b> as necessary <b>until the Jew comes</b> back <b>from the synagogue or from the study hall, and</b> the Jew need <b>not be concerned</b> for the prohibition of eating cooking of gentiles. Similarly, a Jewish <b>woman may set a pot upon the stove and</b> let <b>a gentile woman come</b>
