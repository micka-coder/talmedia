### Part 1
is referring to <b>our forefather Abraham, who did not walk in the counsel of the members of the generation of the dispersion, who were wicked, as it is stated</b> that they said to each other: <b>“Come, let us build us a city,</b> and a tower, with its top in heaven” (Genesis 11:4), a project with a wicked aim. <b>“Nor stood in the way of sinners”</b> (Psalms 1:1); this too is referring to Abraham, <b>who did not join in the stand of</b> the residents of <b>Sodom, who were sinners, as it is stated: “Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against the Lord exceedingly”</b> (Genesis 13:13).

### Part 2
<b>“Nor sat in the seat of the scornful”</b> (Psalms 1:1); this means <b>that</b> Abraham <b>did not sit in the seat of the Philistines, because they were scorners</b> who engaged in jest and buffoonery. <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to the Philistines in a later period: <b>“And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said: Call for Samson, that he may make us sport”</b> (Judges 16:25).

### Part 3
The Gemara cites an interpretation of a similar verse: <b>“Happy is the man that fears the Lord,</b> that delights greatly in His mitzvot” (Psalms 112:1). The Gemara asks: Is that to say <b>happy is the man, but not happy is the woman?</b> Why is it necessary for the verse to emphasize that it is speaking of a man? <b>Rav Amram says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The verse applies to both men and women and is teaching: <b>Happy is one who repents when he is</b> still <b>a man,</b> i.e., before he becomes elderly and his strength dwindles. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Happy is one who triumphs over his</b> evil <b>inclination like a man,</b> i.e., with strength and vigor.

### Part 4
The verse continues: <b>“He delights greatly in His mitzvot.” Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The person delights <b>in His mitzvot</b> themselves <b>and not in the reward</b> for performing <b>His mitzvot. And this is the same as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Avot</i> 1:3): Antigonus of Sokho <b>would say: Do not be like</b> the <b>servants who serve the master on the condition of receiving a reward; rather, be like</b> the <b>servants who serve the master not on the condition that</b> they <b>receive a reward.</b>

### Part 5
§ The Gemara returns to its interpretation of the verse that was discussed previously: <b>“But his delight is in the Torah of the Lord”</b> (Psalms 1:2). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: A person can learn Torah only from a place</b> in the Torah <b>that his heart desires, as it is stated: But his delight is in the Torah of the Lord,</b> i.e., his delight is in the part of the Torah that he wishes to study.

### Part 6
The Gemara relates: <b>Levi and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>were sitting before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and</b> they <b>were learning the Torah portion.</b> When <b>they finished the book</b> that they were learning and were ready to begin a new subject, <b>Levi said: Let them bring us</b> the book of <b>Proverbs;</b> and <b>Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>said: Let them bring us</b> the book of <b>Psalms.</b> He <b>compelled Levi</b> to acquiesce, <b>and they brought</b> a book of <b>Psalms. When they arrived here,</b> at the verse: <b>“But his delight is in the Torah of the Lord,” Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>explained</b> the verse <b>and said: A person can learn Torah only from a place</b> in the Torah <b>that his heart desires. Levi said: My teacher, you have given us,</b> i.e., me, <b>permission to rise</b> and leave, as I wish to study Proverbs, not Psalms.

### Part 7
The Gemara cites other interpretations of this verse. <b>Rabbi Avdimi bar Ḥama says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who engages in</b> the study of <b>Torah, the Holy One, Blessed be He, fulfills his desires, as it is stated: “But in the Torah of the Lord is his delight,”</b> i.e., if one engages in the study of the Torah of the Lord, he will have his desires met by the Lord. <b>Rava says,</b> in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>A person should always learn Torah from a place</b> in the Torah <b>that his heart desires, as it is stated: “But his delight is in the Torah of the Lord.”</b>

### Part 8
<b>And Rava</b> also <b>says,</b> with regard to this verse: <b>Initially</b> the Torah <b>is called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, but ultimately it is called by the name of</b> the one who studies it. <b>As it is</b> first <b>stated: “His delight is in the Torah of the Lord,”</b> and in the continuation of the verse it states: <b>“And in his Torah he meditates day and night.”</b> This teaches that through study one acquires ownership, as it were, of the Torah.

### Part 9
<b>And Rava says</b> in reference to this verse: <b>A person must always study Torah</b> and gain a broad knowledge of it, <b>and</b> only <b>then</b> may he <b>analyze</b> and delve into it. <b>As it is stated:</b> “His delight is <b>in the Torah of the Lord,”</b> meaning that he studies the Torah on a basic level, <b>and</b> only <b>afterward</b> does the verse state: <b>“And in his Torah he meditates,”</b> i.e., he analyzes it.

### Part 10
<b>And Rava says</b> with regard to Torah study: <b>A person should always study [<i>ligeris</i>]</b> and review <b>even though</b> he may afterward <b>forget, and even though he does not understand what it is saying. As it is stated</b> with regard to the study of Torah: <b>“My soul breaks [<i>garesa</i>] for the longing that it has</b> for Your ordinances at all times” (Psalms 119:20). <b>It is written: “Breaks,” and it is not written: Grinds,</b> demonstrating that the soul is satisfied with breaking apart material, on a basic level, even if it does not have the opportunity to grind and analyze it in greater depth.

### Part 11
<b>Rava raises a contradiction</b> between two verses: <b>It is written</b> that the Torah calls to people: <b>“Upon the highest places</b> of the city” (Proverbs 9:3), <b>and it is written</b> far more specifically: <b>“On a seat</b> in the high places of the city” (Proverbs 9:14). He explains: <b>Initially,</b> one who studies Torah does not have a secure place to sit, and therefore he is located merely <b>upon the highest places, but ultimately,</b> as he advances in his learning, he is placed <b>on a seat</b> of honor.

### Part 12
The Gemara mentions a similar contradiction. <b>It is written</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“In the top of high places”</b> (Proverbs 8:2), <b>and it is written</b> in the continuation of the verse that the Torah is <b>“by the path.”</b> This contradiction is resolved as follows: <b>Initially,</b> a person studies Torah in a private location, <b>in the top of high places, but ultimately</b> he will spread his knowledge, <b>by the path,</b> in the public realm.

### Part 13
<b>Ulla raises a contradiction</b> with regard to the following verse. <b>It is written: “Drink waters out of your own cistern”</b> (Proverbs 5:15), <b>and it is written</b> in the continuation of the verse: <b>“And running waters out of your own well.”</b> He explains: <b>Initially</b> one should <b>“drink waters out of your own cistern,”</b> i.e., like the cistern that draws water into one location, learning all existing knowledge; <b>and ultimately</b> one can produce <b>“running waters out of your own well,”</b> i.e., original thought and innovative insights in Torah.

### Part 14
The Gemara cites other statements relating to Torah study. <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Seḥora says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Wealth gotten through vanity [<i>mehevel</i>] shall be diminished; but he that gathers little by little shall increase”</b> (Proverbs 13:11)? <b>If a person turns his Torah into many bundles [<i>ḥavilot</i>],</b> by studying large amounts in a short period of time without reviewing, his Torah <b>will diminish. But if he gathers</b> his knowledge <b>little by little,</b> by studying slowly and reviewing, his knowledge <b>shall increase.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rava said: The Sages know this, but</b> nevertheless <b>they transgress it,</b> i.e., they fail to heed this advice. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: I did this,</b> as I studied little by little and regularly reviewed what I had learned, <b>and</b> my learning <b>has</b> in fact <b>endured.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rav Sheizvi said in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The slothful man [<i>remiyya</i>] will not roast [<i>yaḥarokh</i>] his prey”</b> (Proverbs 12:27)? <b>The deceitful [<i>harammai</i>] hunter,</b> i.e., one who tricks people into believing that he has acquired vast stores of knowledge by studying new material without reviewing that which he has already learned, <b>will not live [<i>yiḥye</i>] a long [<i>ya’arikh</i>] life.</b> According to this interpretation, <i>yaḥarokh</i> is a combination of the words <i>yiḥye</i> and <i>ya’arikh</i>.

### Part 17
<b>And Rav Sheshet says</b> that the verse means the opposite: <b>The cunning [<i>harammai</i>] hunter will roast</b> his prey to prevent it from escaping, i.e., he reads the verse as a rhetorical question: Will not the hunter roast? <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: This is comparable to a person who is hunting birds; if he breaks the wings of the first</b> bird so that it will be unable to fly off, and he proceeds in this manner, <b>all of</b> his prey <b>will remain in his possession; but if not,</b> they <b>will not remain in his possession,</b> as each bird will fly off when the next is captured. In a similar fashion, a clever student reviews that which he learns, to ensure that he retains his knowledge.

### Part 18
§ The Gemara returns to its interpretation of the first verses of Psalms. <b>“And he shall be like a tree planted [<i>shatul</i>] by streams of water”</b> (Psalms 1:3). The students of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai say:</b> The verse states that a Torah scholar <b>is comparable to a tree</b> that has been uprooted from its original location and <b>replanted [<i>shatul</i>]</b> somewhere else. It does <b>not</b> say that he <b>is comparable to a tree that is planted [<i>natu’a</i>]</b> and remains in one place. This is teaching that <b>anyone who learns Torah from one teacher</b> alone <b>never sees a sign of blessing,</b> as it is necessary to acquire knowledge from many teachers.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to the Sages</b> who were studying with him: <b>I wish to say something to you, but I am afraid that</b> then <b>you will leave me and go.</b> What did he wish to tell them? He wanted to say that <b>any-one who learns Torah from one teacher</b> alone <b>never sees a sign of blessing.</b> When the students heard this, they <b>did</b> in fact <b>leave him and went</b> to learn <b>from Rava.</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>said to them: That matter</b> applies only with regard to <b>reasoning,</b> i.e., in order to come up with sophisticated reasoning it is necessary to hear many different opinions. <b>But</b> with regard to the oral <b>tradition</b> itself, <b>it is preferable</b> to learn <b>from one teacher so that</b>
