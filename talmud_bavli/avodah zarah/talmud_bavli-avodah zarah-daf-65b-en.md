<b>would pour wine</b> which he sold <b>to gentiles</b> into their wineskins <b>and go</b> and <b>ferry them over the crossing, and they would give him</b> the <b>jugs</b> in which the wine had been stored <b>as payment.</b> The jugs that the wine had been stored in were included in the sale, and the gentiles would pay him by returning the jugs. People <b>came</b> and <b>told Abaye</b> that Rav Ika was accepting a wage from the wine of gentiles. Abaye <b>said to them: When he labored, he labored with permitted</b> wine, since he was pouring kosher wine into the wineskins, and only subsequently the wine was rendered forbidden by being in the possession of the gentiles.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t he desire the preservation of</b> the wine in the wineskins in <b>that the wineskins should not be torn,</b> as he would then need to return the jugs he received in payment? The Gemara answers: It is a case <b>where he stipulated with</b> the gentile purchasers that even if the wineskins were to tear it would be at their expense and not his, and he would keep the jugs in any event. <b>Alternatively,</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the gentile purchasers <b>brought barrels [<i>perisdakei</i>] with them,</b> so that they could pour the wine into them should the wineskins be torn.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t he ferry them over the crossing, which is laboring with forbidden</b> wine? The Gemara answers: This is not a case where he was ferrying the wine over the crossing himself, <b>as he</b> made an arrangement with the ferrymen and <b>said to the ferryman initially</b> that the latter would ferry the buyers and the barrels without payment. <b>Alternatively,</b> it was a case <b>where he held</b> special signal <b>knots in</b> collusion with the ferryman that he would ferry these people without payment. In any event, he was not laboring for them himself.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation that fell on grapes, one rinses them and they are permitted. But if</b> the grapes <b>were cracked, they are forbidden.</b> In a case where the wine <b>fell on figs or on dates, if there is</b> sufficient wine <b>in them to impart flavor, they are forbidden. And</b> there was <b>an incident involving Boethus ben Zunen, who transported dried figs in a ship, and a barrel of wine</b> used for <b>a libation broke and fell on them, and he asked the Sages</b> as to the <i>halakha</i>, <b>and</b> the Sages <b>deemed</b> the figs <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 5
<b>This is the principle: Anything that benefits</b> from a forbidden item <b>imparting flavor</b> to it, i.e., the forbidden item contributes a positive taste to it, is <b>forbidden,</b> and <b>anything that does not benefit</b> from a forbidden item <b>imparting flavor</b> to it is <b>permitted, such as</b> forbidden <b>vinegar that fell onto</b> split <b>beans,</b> as the flavor imparted by the vinegar does not enhance the taste of the beans.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks with regard to the incident related in the mishna: Was <b>an incident</b> cited <b>to contradict</b> the <i>halakha</i> stated immediately before it? The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>is incomplete, and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching: If</b> the wine <b>imparts flavor to</b> the <b>detriment</b> of the mixture, the food is <b>permitted. And</b> there was <b>also an incident involving Boethus ben Zunen, who was transporting dried figs in a ship, and a barrel of wine</b> used for <b>a libation broke and fell on them, and the incident came before the Sages, and</b> the Sages <b>deemed</b> the figs <b>permitted</b> because the flavor given by the wine did not enhance their taste but was instead to their detriment.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates: There was an incident involving <b>a certain heap of wheat upon which a barrel of wine</b> used for <b>a libation fell. Rava permitted selling it to gentiles,</b> as deriving benefit from it is not prohibited.

### Part 8
<b>Rabba bar Livai raised an objection to Rava</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a garment in which diverse kinds,</b> a prohibited mixture of wool and linen, <b>have been lost,</b> i.e., it is known that linen fibers became mixed into a woolen garment but they cannot be detected and removed, <b>one may not sell</b> the garment <b>to a gentile, nor fashion it</b> into <b>a saddlecloth for a donkey, but one may make it</b> into <b>shrouds for a corpse with no one to bury it [<i>met mitzva</i>],</b> as a corpse is not obligated in the observance of mitzvot.

### Part 9
Rabba bar Livai asked: <b>What is the reason</b> that it is <b>not</b> permitted to sell it <b>to a gentile? Perhaps he will come to sell it to a Jew,</b> who will not know that it is forbidden. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to the wheat, the gentile purchasers <b>may come to sell it to a Jew,</b> who is prohibited from consuming it.

### Part 10
Rava then <b>retracted</b> his decision and <b>permitted grinding</b> the wheat <b>and baking</b> bread with <b>it and selling it to gentiles not in the presence of Jews.</b> In this manner, Jews will not be likely to buy bread from the gentiles, as the bread of gentiles is forbidden to Jews.

### Part 11
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: In the case of <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation that fell on grapes, one rinses them and they are permitted. But if</b> the grapes <b>were cracked, they are forbidden.</b> The Gemara infers: If the grapes are <b>cracked,</b> they <b>are</b> forbidden, but grapes <b>that are not cracked</b> are <b>not</b> forbidden. If so, what is the cause for concern in the case where wine spilled on the wheat? It should be sufficient to rinse the wheat. <b>Rav Pappa said: Wheat is different, since, because of its slits,</b> its status is <b>similar to</b> that of grapes that are <b>cracked.</b>
