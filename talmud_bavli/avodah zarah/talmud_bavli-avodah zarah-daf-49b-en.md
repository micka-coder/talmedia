### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>took wood from</b> an <i>ashera</i>, it is <b>prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it. In a case where one <b>kindled</b> a fire in <b>an oven with</b> the wood, <b>if</b> it is <b>a new</b> oven and by kindling the fire he hardened the oven and made it stronger for use in the future, then the oven <b>must be shattered.</b> Since forbidden items were used in the process of forming the oven, one may not derive benefit from the use of the forbidden items. <b>But if</b> it is <b>an old</b> oven <b>it may be cooled;</b> it is prohibited to use the oven only while it is still hot. If one <b>baked bread with</b> wood from the <i>ashera</i> as the fuel, it is <b>prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from the bread.

### Part 2
If this bread <b>was intermingled with other</b> bread, it is <b>prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from <b>all</b> the bread. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One must take the <b>benefit</b> and <b>cast</b> it <b>into the Dead Sea.</b> In other words, one is not required to destroy all of the loaves. Instead, one should designate money equal in value to the wood that he used from the <i>ashera</i>, and he should destroy this money to offset the benefit he derived from the forbidden wood. The Rabbis <b>said to him: There is no</b> monetary <b>redemption for</b> objects that are forbidden due to <b>idol worship.</b> Once the bread becomes forbidden, it cannot be redeemed by having the value of the forbidden wood cast into the Dead Sea.

### Part 3
If one <b>took</b> wood <b>from</b> an <i>ashera</i> for use as a weaving <b>shuttle [<i>karkor</i>],</b> it is <b>prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it. If one <b>wove a garment with it,</b> it is <b>prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from the garment. If the garment <b>was intermingled with other</b> garments, <b>and</b> those <b>other</b> garments were intermingled <b>with others,</b> it is <b>prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from <b>all of them. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One must take the <b>benefit</b> and <b>cast</b> it <b>into the Dead Sea.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him: There is no</b> monetary <b>redemption for</b> objects that are forbidden due to <b>idol worship.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna presents two cases where Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis disagree. The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> both are <b>necessary; as if</b> the mishna <b>had taught us</b> only <b>the first</b> case, concerning the forbidden bread, one might have thought that it is only <b>in this</b> case that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that the bread is permitted after casting the value gained from the forbidden wood into the Dead Sea, <b>because at the time that the bread has finished</b> baking, the <b>forbidden</b> wood <b>has burned</b> up. <b>But</b> in the case of the <b>shuttle, where</b> the original <b>forbidden</b> piece of wood <b>is</b> still <b>extant,</b> perhaps one will <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to the Rabbis</b> that the forbidden garment may not be redeemed.

### Part 5
<b>And if</b> the mishna <b>had taught us</b> only the case of the <b>shuttle,</b> one might have thought that it is only <b>in this</b> case that <b>the Rabbis say</b> that the forbidden garment may not be redeemed, because the original forbidden piece of wood is still extant. <b>But</b> in the case of the <b>bread,</b> where the forbidden wood was already burned up by the time the bread finished baking, perhaps one will <b>say</b> that <b>they concede to Rabbi Eliezer</b> that the bread may be redeemed. Therefore, both cases are <b>necessary.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rabba bar Naḥmani, says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Ze’eiri says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> there is a different version of this ruling: <b>Rav Ḥisda says: Abba bar Rav Ḥisda said to me</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>Ze’eiri says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says: They taught</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer <b>only</b> in the case of forbidden <b>bread. But</b> with regard to the case of <b>a barrel</b> of wine used for an idolatrous libation, which was intermingled with permitted barrels of wine, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. <b>And Rav Ḥisda says: Even</b> in the case of <b>a barrel</b> of libation wine, the wine in the other barrels is <b>permitted</b> once the value of the forbidden barrel has been cast into the Dead Sea.

### Part 8
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man,</b> and it happened <b>that a barrel of wine</b> used for <b>a libation became intermingled with his wine. He came before Rav Ḥisda</b> to ask what he should do. Rav Ḥisda <b>said</b> to him: <b>Take four dinars and cast</b> them <b>into the river, and</b> the rest of the wine <b>will be permitted to you.</b>

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>How does one revoke</b> the idolatrous status of an <i>ashera</i>? If a gentile <b>trimmed</b> dry wood <b>or pruned</b> green wood from the tree for his own benefit, or if he <b>removed from it a stick, or a rod,</b> or <b>even a leaf, he has</b> thereby <b>revoked</b> its idolatrous status, as he has proven that he no longer worships it. If a gentile <b>shaved down</b> the tree <b>for its</b> own <b>sake,</b> to improve its appearance, it remains <b>prohibited</b> to derive benefit from it. If he shaved it down <b>not for its</b> own <b>sake,</b> it is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to <b>those shavings</b> that were shaved off for the sake of the <i>ashera</i>, <b>what should be</b> done <b>with them? Rav Huna and Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Rav disagree about it; one says</b> the shavings <b>are forbidden and one says they are permitted.</b>

### Part 11
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with the one who says</b> that the shavings <b>are permitted, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a gentile who shaved down</b> an object of <b>idol worship for his</b> own <b>sake,</b> as he wished to use the shavings, the tree <b>and its shavings are permitted.</b> The idolatrous status has been revoked from both the object and its shavings. If he shaved it <b>for its,</b> i.e., for the idol’s, own <b>sake, it</b> remains <b>forbidden, but its shavings are permitted. And</b> in the case of <b>a Jew who shaved down</b> an object of <b>idol worship, whether for its sake or for his</b> own <b>sake,</b> the object <b>and its shavings</b> remain <b>forbidden,</b> as a Jew cannot revoke an object’s idolatrous status.

### Part 12
<b>It was stated:</b> With regard to an object of <b>idol worship that broke, Rav says: It is necessary to revoke</b> the idolatrous status of <b>each and every sliver. And Shmuel says:</b> An object of <b>idol worship</b> can have its status <b>nullified only</b> if part of it breaks off in the course of <b>its</b> natural <b>manner of growth.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara inquires about Shmuel’s ruling: <b>On the contrary, can</b> an object possibly have its idolatrous status <b>nullified</b> by breaking in the course of <b>its</b> natural <b>manner of growth?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, this</b> is what Shmuel <b>is saying:</b> If an object of <b>idol worship</b> breaks, its idolatrous status is automatically nullified, as the idol worshipper will see that it broke and will no longer attribute any power to it. It <b>needs</b> to have its idolatrous status actively <b>revoked only</b> in a case where it broke off in the course of <b>its</b> natural <b>manner of growth.</b> For example, if leaves fall from a worshipped tree, the tree and the leaves retain their idolatrous status. In this case, the idol worshipper will not attribute the fallen leaves to a lack of power of the tree.

### Part 14
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that</b> Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree about this:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> that people <b>worship</b> even <b>fragments</b> of idols. Therefore, the fact that an idol broke does not result in the nullification of its idolatrous status. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Shmuel, <b>holds</b> that people <b>do not worship fragments</b> of idols.

### Part 15
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, everyone</b> agrees that people <b>worship fragments</b> of idols. <b>And here,</b> it is <b>with regard to fragments of fragments</b> that <b>they disagree.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> that <b>fragments of fragments are forbidden; and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Shmuel, <b>holds</b> that <b>fragments of fragments are permitted.</b>

### Part 16
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone</b> agrees that <b>fragments of fragments are permitted, and here they disagree with regard to</b> objects of <b>idol worship</b> that are composed <b>of segments</b> that come apart <b>and that a layman can reassemble.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> that <b>since a layman can reassemble it,</b> its idolatrous status is <b>not nullified. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Shmuel, <b>holds</b> that an object of <b>idol worship</b> needs to have its status <b>revoked only</b> when it breaks in the course of <b>its</b> natural <b>manner of growth, as that is its</b> typical <b>manner. This</b> case, where the idol is disassembled, <b>is not</b> related to <b>its</b> natural <b>growth and</b> therefore it <b>requires no</b> further act <b>to revoke</b> its idolatrous status.

### Part 17
end of chapter

### Part 18
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: Three stones</b> that are <b>adjacent to each other at</b> the <b>side of Mercury [<i>Markulis</i>] are prohibited,</b> as that idol was worshipped by tossing stones toward it, which then became part of the idol. <b>But</b> if there are only <b>two</b> stones, then they <b>are permitted. And the Rabbis say:</b> Those stones <b>that are adjacent to</b> Mercury and appear to have fallen from it <b>are prohibited. But</b> those stones <b>that are not adjacent to it are permitted.</b>

### Part 19
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> one can explain that <b>the Rabbis hold</b> that idol worshippers <b>worship fragments</b> of idols. Therefore, those stones that are <b>adjacent to</b> Mercury, <b>where it can be said</b> that they <b>fell from its</b> pile of stones, <b>are prohibited;</b> as they are considered fragments of an object of idol worship, namely the stone pile. And those <b>that are not adjacent to</b> Mercury <b>are permitted,</b> as they did not fall from it.

### Part 20
<b>But</b> with regard to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, what does he hold? If</b> he holds that idol worshippers <b>worship fragments</b> of idols, <b>even two</b> stones <b>should be prohibited. If</b> he holds that idol worshippers <b>do not worship fragments</b> of idols, <b>even three</b> stones <b>should not</b> be prohibited.

### Part 21
<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: In</b> a case where <b>it is known that</b> these stones <b>fell from</b> the pile of stones, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>they are prohibited, and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even according to the one who says:</b> Idol worshippers <b>do not worship fragments.</b> As <b>that statement</b> applies only to a form of <b>idol worship where that is not</b> the normal <b>manner</b> in which <b>it</b> is worshipped. <b>But here, where</b> the stones thrown onto the pile are <b>broken</b> stones <b>from the outset, this is its</b> normal <b>manner</b> of worship. <b>They disagree</b> only <b>when</b> it is <b>not specifically</b> known where these stones came from.
