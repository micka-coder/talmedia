### Part 1
<b>if there is a remnant of wine</b> left <b>in</b> the funnel, it is rendered <b>forbidden. In what</b> manner <b>is this remnant of wine rendered forbidden? Is it not by</b> the <b>stream</b> of wine going down from the funnel into the gentile’s vessel, thereby connecting the gentile’s vessel and the funnel and rendering the wine in the funnel forbidden? <b>Conclude from it</b> that <b>a stream</b> constitutes <b>a connection.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> that the mishna is referring to a situation <b>where</b> the wine in <b>the</b> gentile’s <b>jug</b> rose and <b>reached</b> the funnel. The Gemara infers: <b>But</b> in a case where the wine in <b>the jug did not</b> rise and <b>reach</b> the funnel, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? It is <b>not</b> forbidden. Therefore, <b>resolve</b> the dilemma and conclude <b>that a stream is not a connection.</b> The Gemara rejects this inference: <b>No,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya means to say that in a case where the wine in the <b>jug</b> rose and <b>reached</b> the funnel <b>you can resolve</b> the dilemma and conclude <b>that it is forbidden,</b> but with regard to <b>a stream the dilemma remains</b> unresolved.

### Part 3
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the second topic discussed in the mishna: In the case of <b>one who pours</b> wine <b>from</b> one <b>vessel into</b> another <b>vessel,</b> the wine left in the vessel <b>from which he poured</b> is <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>But</b> the stream of wine <b>between</b> the two vessels <b>is forbidden. Conclude from it</b> that <b>a stream</b> constitutes <b>a connection.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara raises an objection to this proof: <b>If a stream</b> constitutes <b>a connection, even</b> the wine <b>inside the vessel</b> being poured from <b>should also be forbidden.</b> The Gemara responds to this objection: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult.</b> It is the case <b>where</b> the one pouring the wine <b>interrupts</b> the flow, so the reason the wine in the vessel being poured from is permitted is that the stream is interrupted; but <b>in any case, a stream is</b> considered <b>a connection.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>According to your reasoning, say</b> that there is an inference from <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>It is</b> the wine in the vessel <b>into which he poured that</b> is <b>forbidden</b> due to the forbidden remnant of wine in the funnel, <b>but</b> by inference, the stream of wine <b>between</b> the two vessels <b>is permitted,</b> contrary to the conclusion from the previous clause. <b>Rather, no</b> inference <b>is to be learned from this</b> mishna.

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who pours</b> wine <b>from a barrel into</b> a wine <b>cistern</b> containing forbidden wine, the <b>stream</b> of wine <b>coming from the rim of the barrel downward</b> is rendered <b>forbidden.</b> Evidently, a stream constitutes a connection. <b>Rav Sheshet interpreted</b> this <i>baraita</i> as referring <b>to a gentile pouring</b> the wine from the barrel into the cistern, and the wine streaming out of the barrel is rendered forbidden <b>because it came from</b> the gentile’s <b>force,</b> i.e., the stream was powered by the gentile’s action. If a gentile moves wine, the wine is forbidden, even if the gentile did not touch it. The stream is not rendered forbidden by virtue of its connection to the wine in the cistern.

### Part 7
The Gemara raises an objection to this interpretation: <b>If</b> the reference is to <b>a gentile who pours</b> the wine, <b>even</b> the wine <b>inside the barrel is rendered forbidden,</b> because the gentile is also powering the movement of the barrel itself. The Gemara responds to this objection: The <i>halakha</i> that <b>a gentile’s force renders</b> wine <b>forbidden</b> is <b>by rabbinic law.</b> With regard to the wine <b>that</b> is poured <b>out</b> of the barrel, <b>the Sages decreed</b> that <b>it</b> is forbidden; but with regard to the wine <b>that</b> remains <b>inside</b> the barrel, <b>the Sages did not decree</b> that it is forbidden.

### Part 8
The Gemara relates accounts of how the Sages ruled concerning this matter: <b>Rav Ḥisda said to certain wine retailers: When you measure wine for gentiles, pour with interruptions,</b> rather than in a smooth steady stream, <b>or toss</b> it <b>out</b> in a single action that does not create a steady stream. <b>Rava said to certain</b> wine <b>pourers: When you pour wine, do not let a gentile approach to help you, lest you let your guard down and rest</b> the vessel <b>in</b> the gentile’s hands, <b>and</b> the wine <b>will emerge due to his force and will be rendered forbidden.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara relates: There was an incident involving <b>a certain man who siphoned wine</b> from a barrel <b>with a large tube and a small tube. A gentile came</b> and <b>rested his hand upon the large tube. Rava deemed the entire</b> quantity of <b>wine forbidden,</b> including the wine that was still in the barrel.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Pappa said to Rava, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Adda bar Mattana</b> who said this <b>to Rava, and some say</b> it was <b>Ravina</b> who said this <b>to Rava: By what</b> mechanism was the wine rendered forbidden? Was it <b>by</b> the <b>stream</b> of wine that went through the large tube, which was rendered forbidden by the contact of the gentile, and the rest of the barrel was rendered forbidden by the connection with that stream? Should one <b>conclude from</b> this ruling that <b>a stream</b> constitutes <b>a connection?</b> Rava rejects this inference: <b>It is different there, as all of the wine</b> in the barrel <b>is drawn toward the large tube and the small tube,</b> and so it is as though the gentile had touched all of the wine in the barrel.

### Part 11
<b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, says:</b> For a Jew and a gentile to drink simultaneously from <b>a vessel with tubes for several people to drink from [<i>kenishkanin</i>]</b> is <b>permitted. And this statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where</b> the <b>Jew stops</b> drinking <b>first,</b> before the gentile; <b>but</b> if the <b>gentile stops</b> drinking <b>first,</b> it does <b>not</b> apply and the wine is forbidden, as wine from the gentile’s mouth returns to the vessel and renders all of the wine forbidden. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna happened</b> to come <b>to the house of the Exilarch,</b> and <b>he permitted them to drink from a <i>kenishkanin</i></b> together with gentiles.
