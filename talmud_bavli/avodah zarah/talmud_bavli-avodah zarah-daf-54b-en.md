### Part 1
<b>But rather,</b> it is derived <b>from</b> the case of <b>vessels</b> of the Temple that Ahaz used for idol worship, <b>as it is written: “And all the vessels, which King Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he acted treacherously, we have prepared and sanctified,</b> and behold, they are before the altar of the Lord” (II Chronicles 29:19). <b>And the Master said: “We have prepared”</b> means <b>that we interred them; “and sanctified”</b> means <b>that we sanctified other</b> vessels <b>in their stead,</b> as the original vessels were prohibited. <b>But</b> how could Ahaz render the vessels of the Temple forbidden, as <b>a person does not render forbidden an item that is not his?</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rather, since</b> Ahaz <b>performed</b> a sacrificial <b>rite upon them</b> in idolatrous worship, the vessels <b>were prohibited. Here too, when</b> one <b>performed</b> a sacrificial <b>rite upon</b> the animal of another person by slaughtering it in idolatrous worship, <b>he rendered it prohibited.</b>

### Part 3
§ <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even though</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one who bows to the ground does not render it prohibited,</b> if one <b>dug pits, ditches, and caves in it, he rendered it prohibited. When Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even though</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one who bows to animals does not render them prohibited,</b> if one <b>rendered them</b> an item of <b>exchange for</b> an object of <b>idol worship,</b> exchanging the animal for an object of idol worship, <b>he rendered them prohibited.</b>

### Part 4
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he <b>said: Rabbi Yishmael bar Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis disagree with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning an item exchanged for an object of idol worship. <b>One says</b> that the item of the <b>exchange</b> is <b>prohibited,</b> but if one then acquired another item in exchange for the item of that exchange, the <b>exchange of</b> the <b>exchange</b> is <b>permitted. And one says</b> that <b>even</b> the <b>exchange of</b> the <b>exchange</b> is <b>also prohibited.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of the one who says</b> that the <b>exchange of</b> the <b>exchange</b> is <b>prohibited? The verse states:</b> “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, <b>that you should become accursed like it;</b> you shall utterly detest it…for it is accursed” (Deuteronomy 7:26). Not only do you become accursed, but <b>anything that you cause to become</b> yours <b>from</b> the exchange of an object of idol worship <b>is</b> accursed <b>like it,</b> i.e., is forbidden like the object of idol worship itself. <b>And</b> as for <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, from where does he derive that the exchange of the exchange is permitted? <b>The verse states:</b> “For <b>it</b> is accursed.” Infer from this that <b>“it,”</b> the object of idol worship, is forbidden, <b>but not</b> the <b>exchange of</b> the <b>exchange.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, how does he inter-pret the term “it”? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires that</b> term <b>to exclude</b> an item acquired in exchange for <b><i>orla</i> or</b> for <b>diverse kinds</b> of crops that grew <b>in a vineyard.</b> The verse indicates <b>that if</b> one <b>sold</b> <i>orla</i> or diverse kinds that grew in a vineyard <b>and betrothed</b> a woman <b>with</b> the <b>money</b> from the sale, she is <b>betrothed.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i> derive this <i>halakha</i>? He holds that <b><i>orla</i> and diverse kinds</b> that grew <b>in a vineyard do not require an exclusion.</b> This is <b>because idol worship and</b> the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>are two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., both teach the same principle, that an item acquired in exchange for a forbidden item is forbidden, <b>and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common <i>halakha</i> to other cases.

### Part 8
The Gemara explains: The source of this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>idol worship</b> is <b>that</b> ruling <b>which we said</b> earlier. With regard to the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, the source is <b>as it is written: “For it is a Jubilee Year; it shall be sacred for you”</b> (Leviticus 25:12). The verse juxtaposes the Jubilee Year, the produce of which has the same status as produce of the Sabbatical Year, and sacred items. Infer from this that <b>just as</b> when one buys <b>consecrated</b> property it <b>transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>it</b> is redeemed <b>and</b> the money is <b>prohibited, so too,</b> the produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>it</b> is redeemed <b>and</b> the money is <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, one could say that <b>just as consecrated</b> property <b>transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>it</b> is redeemed <b>and is transferred to non-sacred</b> status, <b>so too,</b> the produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>it</b> is redeemed <b>and is transferred to non-sacred</b> status. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It shall be</b> sacred for you,” indicating that the produce <b>shall</b> always <b>be as it is,</b> and it is not desacralized.

### Part 10
The Gemara explains: <b>How so?</b> If one <b>purchased meat with produce</b> of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, both <b>these and those,</b> i.e., the meat and the produce, <b>are eradicated in the Sabbatical</b> Year. The sanctity of the Sabbatical Year takes effect with regard to the meat as well. It is treated like the produce, and it must be disposed of when the obligation to eradicate the produce of the Sabbatical Year goes into effect. If he then purchases <b>fish with</b> this <b>meat,</b> the <b>meat loses</b> its consecrated status, and the <b>fish assume</b> the consecrated state. If he then purchases <b>wine with</b> these <b>fish,</b> the <b>fish lose</b> their consecrated status and the <b>wine assumes</b> the consecrated state. If he then purchases <b>oil with</b> the <b>wine,</b> the <b>wine loses</b> its consecrated status and the <b>oil assumes</b> the consecrated state. <b>How so? The final</b> item purchased has the sanctity of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>transferred to it, and the</b> Sabbatical-Year <b>produce itself</b> remains <b>forbidden.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, who maintains that the term “it” excludes an item exchanged for <i>orla</i> or for diverse kinds that grew in a vineyard, how does he respond to this? The Gemara answers: <b>He holds</b> that <b>two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., that teach the same principle, <b>teach</b> their common <i>halakha</i> to other cases, and one could have derived the prohibition from the cases of idol worship and the Sabbatical Year. Therefore, the term <b>“it” was necessary</b> in order <b>to exclude</b> from the prohibition an item exchanged for <i>orla</i> or for diverse kinds that grew in a vineyard.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The gentiles <b>asked the</b> Jewish <b>Sages</b> who were <b>in Rome: If it is not</b> God’s <b>will</b> that people should engage <b>in idol worship, why does He not elimi-nate it?</b> The Sages <b>said to them: Were</b> people <b>worshipping</b> only <b>objects for which the world has no need, He would eliminate it.</b> But <b>they worship the sun and the moon</b> and <b>the stars and the constellations. Should He destroy His world because of the fools?</b>

### Part 13
The gentiles <b>said to</b> the Sages: <b>If so, let Him destroy</b> those <b>objects</b> of idol worship <b>for which the world has no need and leave</b> those <b>objects for which the world</b> has <b>a need.</b> The Sages <b>said to them:</b> If that were to happen, <b>we would</b> thereby <b>be supporting the worshippers of those</b> objects for which the world has need, <b>as they</b> would <b>say: You should know that these are</b> truly <b>gods, as they were not eliminated</b> from the world, whereas the others were eliminated.

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> Certain <b>philosophers [<i>filosofin</i>] asked the</b> Jewish <b>Sages</b> who were <b>in Rome: If it is not your God’s will</b> that people should engage <b>in idol worship, for what</b> reason <b>does He not eliminate it?</b> The Sages <b>said to them: Were</b> people <b>worshipping</b> only <b>objects for which the world has no need, He would eliminate it.</b> But <b>they worship the sun and the moon</b> and <b>the stars and the constellations. Should He destroy</b> the <b>world because of the fools? Rather, the world follows its course, and</b> the <b>fools who sinned will be held to judgment in the future</b> for their transgressions.

### Part 15
The <i>baraita</i> presents <b>another matter</b> that illustrates the same concept: Consider the case of one <b>who stole a <i>se’a</i> of wheat and went and planted it in the ground.</b> By <b>right it should not grow. But the world goes along and follows its course and</b> the <b>fools who sinned will be held to judgment in the future</b> for their transgressions.

### Part 16
The <i>baraita</i> presents <b>another matter</b> that illustrates the same concept: Consider the case of one who <b>engaged in intercourse with the wife of another.</b> By <b>right she should not become pregnant. But the world goes along and follows its course and</b> the <b>fools who sinned will be held to judgment in the future</b> for their transgressions.

### Part 17
The Gemara comments: <b>And this is as Reish Lakish says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Is it not enough for the wicked that they treat My</b> die for <b>a <i>sela</i></b> coin as if it were <b>ownerless [<i>pumbi</i>],</b> using it without My permission and against My will, as they impregnate women adulterously? <b>But</b> moreover, they also <b>trouble Me and cause Me to sign</b> the result of their actions <b>against My will,</b> as I form the fetus and give it life, even when its creation is the result of prohibited sexual intercourse.

### Part 18
<b>A certain philosopher asked Rabban Gamliel: It is written in your Torah</b> with regard to the prohibition against idol worship: <b>“For the Lord your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:24). <b>For what</b> reason is <b>He jealous</b> and does He exact vengeance <b>from the</b> idol’s <b>worshippers, but</b> He is <b>not jealous of</b> the idol <b>itself</b> and does not destroy it?

### Part 19
Rabban Gamliel <b>said to</b> the philosopher: <b>I will relate a parable to you. To what is this matter comparable?</b> It may be compared <b>to a king of flesh and blood who had one son, and that son was raising a dog. And</b> the son <b>gave</b> the dog <b>a name,</b> naming him <b>after his father. When</b> the son would <b>take an oath,</b> he would <b>say:</b> I swear <b>by the life of</b> the <b>dog, my father. When the king heard</b> about this, <b>with whom</b> was the king <b>angry? Is he angry with the son or is he angry with the dog? You must say</b> that <b>he is angry with the son.</b> So too, God is angry with the worshippers who attribute divinity to objects of idol worship and not with the objects of idol worship themselves.

### Part 20
The philosopher <b>said to</b> Rabban Gamliel: <b>Do you call</b> the idol <b>a dog? But</b> the idol truly <b>exists,</b> i.e., has power. Rabban Gamliel <b>said to</b> the philosopher: <b>And what did you see</b> that caused you to believe that the idols have power? The philosopher <b>said to</b> Rabban Gamliel: <b>A fire once broke out in our city, and the entire city was burned down, but that temple of idol worship was not burned down.</b>

### Part 21
Rabban Gamliel <b>said to</b> the philosopher <b>I will relate a parable to you. To what is this matter comparable?</b> It may be compared <b>to a king of flesh and blood whose province sinned against him. When he wages war, does he wage</b> war <b>against the living or does he wage</b> war <b>against the dead? You must say</b> that <b>he wages</b> war <b>against the living.</b> God punishes the living worshippers and not the idol, which is not alive.

### Part 22
The philosopher <b>said to</b> Rabban Gamliel: <b>You call</b> the idol <b>a dog; you call</b> the idol <b>dead. If</b> it is <b>so, let</b> God <b>remove it from the world.</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>said to</b> the philosopher: <b>Were</b> people <b>worshipping</b> only <b>objects for which the world has no need, He would eliminate it.</b> But <b>they worship the sun and the moon, the stars and the constellations,</b> and <b>the streams and the valleys. Should He destroy His world because of fools? And so</b> the verse <b>states:</b>
