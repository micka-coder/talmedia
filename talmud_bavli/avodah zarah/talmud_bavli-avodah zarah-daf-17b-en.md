### Part 1
<b>as the inclination</b> to engage in idol worship <b>has been slaughtered</b> and the temptation to sin in this manner no longer exists. <b>The other said to him: Let us go by</b> the path that leads to <b>the entrance of</b> the <b>brothel and overpower our inclination, and</b> thereby <b>receive a reward. When they arrived there, they saw</b> that <b>the prostitutes yielded before their presence,</b> i.e., they entered the building out of respect for the Sages.

### Part 2
One <b>said to</b> the other: <b>From where did you know this,</b> that the prostitutes would retreat from us in embarrassment? <b>He said to him:</b> It is written: <b>“From lewdness [<i>mezimma</i>] it shall watch over you; discernment shall guard you”</b> (Proverbs 2:11), i.e., the Torah will serve as a safeguard against lewdness.

### Part 3
<b>The Sages said to Rava: What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>mezimma</i>? If we say</b> that it is referring to the <b>Torah</b> that will guard you, <b>as it is written in it: “<i>Zimma</i>”</b> (Leviticus 18:17), <b>and we translate</b> this term as: <b>The council of [<i>atzat</i>] the sinners,</b> demonstrating that <i>zimma</i> is referring to council or wisdom, <b>and</b> the term <i>etza</i> <b>is</b> also <b>written</b> with regard to the Torah: “This also comes forth from the Lord of hosts: <b>Wonderful is His counsel [<i>etza</i>], and great is His wisdom”</b> (Isaiah 28:29), this is difficult. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>If so,</b> the verse <b>should have</b> said: <b><i>Zimma</i>,</b> and not <i>mezimma</i>. Rather, <b>this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: From lewd matters [<i>midevar zimma</i>], it shall watch over you, the Torah shall guard you,</b> i.e., the term discernment is a reference to the Torah.

### Part 4
§ The Gemara returns to its discussion of the judgments of the Sages by the Roman rulers. <b>The Sages taught: When Rabbi Elazar ben Perata and Rabbi Ḥanina ben Teradyon were arrested</b> by the Romans during the time of the religious persecution of the Jewish people, <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Perata said to Rabbi Ḥanina ben Teradyon: Fortunate are you, as you were arrested on one charge</b> only, of teaching Torah publicly; <b>woe is me, as I have been arrested on five charges.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> ben Teradyon <b>said to him: Fortunate are you, as you were arrested on five charges but you will be saved; woe is me, as I have been arrested on one charge, but I will not be saved.</b> You will be saved <b>because you engaged in Torah</b> study <b>and in acts of charity, and I engaged in Torah</b> study <b>alone.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement <b>of Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says: Anyone who occupies himself with Torah</b> study <b>alone is considered like one who does not have a God. As it is stated: “Now for long seasons Israel was without the true God,</b> and without a teaching priest, and without the Torah” (II Chronicles 15:3). <b>What</b> is meant by <b>“without the true God”?</b> This teaches <b>that anyone who engages in Torah</b> study <b>alone is considered like one who does not have</b> a true <b>God.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it true that Rabbi Ḥanina ben Teradyon <b>did not engage in acts of charity? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: A person should not donate his money to the charity purse [<i>le’arnakei</i>] unless a Torah scholar like Rabbi Ḥanina ben Teradyon is appointed</b> as supervisor <b>over it?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He was trusted</b> to distribute the charity with honesty and integrity, but he himself <b>did not perform</b> charitable acts.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Ḥanina ben Teradyon <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei ben Kisma: <b>I confused</b> my own <b>coins</b> that I needed <b>for</b> the festivities of <b>Purim with coins of charity, and I distributed them</b> all <b>to the poor</b> at my own expense. How then can it be said that he never engaged in charitable acts? The Gemara responds: <b>He did perform</b> acts of charity, but <b>he did not perform as</b> many acts as <b>he should have,</b> in light of his wealth.

### Part 9
The Gemara returns to the description of the trial of the Sages. The Romans <b>brought Rabbi Elazar ben Perata</b> for his trial and <b>said: What is the reason</b> that <b>you taught</b> Torah, <b>and what is the reason</b> that <b>you stole,</b> as these were the crimes of which he was accused. Rabbi Elazar ben Perata <b>said to them: If one is an armed robber [<i>sayafa</i>], he is not a scholar [<i>safra</i>], and if one is a scholar he is not an armed robber,</b> i.e., I am accused of two mutually exclusive crimes; <b>and from</b> the fact <b>that this</b> characterization <b>is not</b> true, one may also conclude that <b>that</b> characterization <b>is also not</b> true. They asked him: <b>But</b> if you do not teach Torah, then <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>they call you rabbi?</b> He answered: <b>I am the master [<i>rabban</i>] of weavers [<i>tarsiyyim</i>].</b>

### Part 10
In order to ascertain whether Rabbi Elazar ben Perata was in fact an expert weaver, <b>they brought him two coils</b> of wool and <b>said to him: Which is</b> the <b>warp, and which is</b> the <b>woof?</b> The threads used for each differ in their thickness and strength and would be immediately recognizable to an expert. <b>A miracle occurred,</b> as <b>a female hornet came</b> and <b>sat on</b> the coil <b>of warp, and a male hornet came and sat on</b> the coil <b>of woof.</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Perata <b>said to them: This</b> is a coil <b>of warp, and that</b> is a coil <b>of woof.</b> He realized that the male hornet was a sign that the coil was the woof, as the woof is threaded through the warp, while the warp, which is fixed in the loom and receives the woof, was the one on which the female hornet sat, as the female of a species receives the male.

### Part 11
The Romans <b>said to him: And what is the reason</b> that <b>you did not come to the house of Abidan?</b> This was a gathering place where debates on wisdom and faith were conducted. Rabbi Elazar ben Perata <b>said to them: I was old and feared</b> that <b>perhaps I would be trampled under your feet,</b> due to the huge crowds. The Romans <b>said: And until now, how many elders have been trampled</b> there, that you would be worried about such a possibility? The Gemara comments: <b>A miracle occurred,</b> and on <b>that day, one old man was trampled.</b>

### Part 12
The Romans asked Rabbi Elazar ben Perata: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>you emancipated your slave?</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Perata <b>said to them: This matter never happened. One of them stood to testify against him,</b> and <b>Elijah came disguised as one of the of the Roman noblemen,</b> and he <b>said to</b> that individual: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that miracles occurred for</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Perata <b>in every</b> other case, <b>in this</b> instance <b>as well a miracle will occur for him, and that man,</b> i.e., you, <b>is</b> only <b>demonstrating his wickedness,</b> since you cannot succeed in your aim and are merely showing yourself to be desperate to cause harm.

### Part 13
<b>But</b> the man <b>paid him no heed,</b> and he <b>stood to say</b> his testimony <b>to them.</b> At that time <b>there was a written letter that was composed by</b> some <b>of the</b> most <b>important people of</b> the Roman <b>Empire</b> in order <b>to send</b> it <b>to the Emperor’s court, and they</b> had <b>sent it in the possession of that man,</b> i.e., the potential witness. <b>Elijah came</b> and <b>threw it</b> a distance of <b>four hundred parasangs.</b> The man <b>went and did not come</b> back, and therefore all the charges against Rabbi Elazar ben Perata were dropped.

### Part 14
The Romans <b>brought Rabbi Ḥanina ben Teradyon</b> for judgment, and they <b>said to him: Why did you occupy yourself with the Torah?</b> Rabbi Ḥanina ben Teradyon <b>said to them,</b> citing a verse: <b>“As the Lord my God commanded me”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:5). <b>They immediately sentenced him to</b> death by means of <b>burning, and</b> they sentenced <b>his wife to execution</b> by decapitation, <b>and his daughter</b> was condemned <b>to sit in a brothel [<i>kubba shel zonot</i>].</b> The Gemara explains the Divine decree that he should receive this punishment: <b>He</b> was sentenced <b>to</b> death by <b>burning, as he would</b>
