### Part 1
Is it permitted to put brine or fish stew in the wineskins <b><i>ab initio</i>, or</b> is the substance permitted only <b>after the fact?</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma, <b>as Rav Zevid bar Oshaya teaches:</b> With regard to <b>one who purchases jugs from gentiles,</b> if they are <b>new, he may place wine in them,</b> and if they are <b>old, he may place brine and fish stew in them <i>ab initio</i>.</b>

### Part 2
§ The Gemara discusses the effect of fire on prohibited vessels. <b>Rabbi Yehuda Nesia raised a dilemma before Rabbi Ami:</b> If <b>one returned</b> prohibited containers <b>to the furnace and they whitened</b> due to its heat, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the fire assumed to expunge the absorbed wine or not? Rabbi Ami <b>said to him:</b> If <b>brine burns</b> away the wine, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that <b>fire</b> does as well? <b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and some say Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>jugs belonging to gentiles that one returned to the furnace, once their tar has disintegrated they are permitted.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Ashi said: Do not say</b> that the jugs must stay in the furnace <b>until</b> the tar <b>falls</b> apart entirely; <b>rather, even</b> if it only <b>softens,</b> the jug is permitted, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that</b> the tar <b>did not fall</b> off. The Gemara adds: With regard to a situation in which the tar was removed by dropping ignited <b>splinters of wood [<i>kinsa</i>]</b> into the jug, <b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree: One deemed</b> the jug <b>prohibited, and one deemed</b> it <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who deemed</b> it <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara discusses the <i>halakha</i> with regard to beer kept in a prohibited vessel. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to putting beer in it? Rav Naḥman and Rav Yehuda prohibited</b> this, <b>and Rava permitted</b> it. The Gemara notes that <b>Ravina permitted Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Yitzḥak, to pour beer into</b> such a jug, but <b>he went</b> and <b>poured wine into it</b> instead. <b>And even so,</b> Ravina <b>was not concerned over the matter,</b> as <b>he said</b> to himself: <b>It is merely an incidental</b> occurrence. The fact that Rav Ḥiyya mistakenly poured wine into the jug instead of beer is not a reason to prohibit filling it with beer in general.

### Part 5
§ The Gemara discusses different vessels and the <i>halakhot</i> that pertain to them. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Bisna had certain vessels</b> made <b>of</b> cow <b>dung [<i>defakosna</i>]</b> that had contained wine of gentiles, <b>which he filled</b> with <b>water</b> and <b>placed in the sun</b> in order to rid them of the forbidden substance they had absorbed. As a result, <b>they burst. Rabbi Abba</b> then <b>said to him</b> in jest: <b>You have rendered them prohibited to you forever,</b> i.e., you have destroyed them completely. You <b>may say that the Sages said</b> that one should <b>fill</b> the containers with <b>water,</b> but <b>did</b> anyone <b>say</b> that you should <b>place them in the sun?</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yusna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami says: A natron vessel has no ritual purification,</b> i.e., it cannot be rendered suitable for use, <b>ever.</b> The reason is that this material is highly absorbent. The Gemara asks: <b>What is a natron vessel? Rabbi Yosei bar Avin says:</b> It is <b>a vessel</b> crafted from <b>the excavation of alum</b> powder.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates that an individual named <b>Parzak, from house of the vizier [<i>rofila</i>], seized certain vessels from</b> Jews of <b>Pumbedita, placed wine</b> of gentiles <b>in them,</b> and later <b>returned</b> the containers <b>to them. They went</b> and <b>asked Rav Yehuda</b> for a halakhic ruling on this matter. Rav Yehuda <b>said:</b> This vessel <b>is an item that is not brought into</b> storage for <b>preservation.</b> Accordingly, one may simply <b>scrub</b> such vessels <b>in water, and they are permitted.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Avira said:</b> With regard to <b>these dark brown Aramean jugs, since they do not absorb</b> substances <b>well,</b> one need only <b>scrub them in water and they are permitted. Rav Pappi</b> likewise <b>said:</b> With regard to <b>these earthenware vessels from Bei Mikhsei, since they do not absorb</b> substances <b>well,</b> one need only <b>scrub them in water, and they are permitted.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara continues: The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>cups,</b> which hold wine only temporarily, is subject to a dispute: <b>Rav Asi prohibited</b> them, <b>and Rav Ashi permitted</b> them. The Gemara comments: <b>If a gentile drank from</b> a cup for the <b>first time,</b> i.e., it had never been used before, <b>everyone agrees that it is prohibited,</b> as a new cup absorbs a great deal of wine in its first usage. <b>They disagree when</b> it is being used <b>for a second time,</b> i.e., the cup has already absorbed a permitted liquid, and therefore its capacity to absorb the gentile’s wine is impaired.

### Part 10
And <b>there are</b> those <b>who say:</b> If the cup is used for the <b>first or</b> the <b>second time</b> by a gentile, <b>everyone agrees that</b> it is <b>prohibited. They disagree when</b> it is being used <b>for</b> the <b>third time. And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that a cup used for the <b>first or</b> the <b>second time</b> by a gentile is rendered <b>prohibited,</b> but with regard to the <b>third</b> time, it is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rav Zevid said:</b> With regard to <b>these glazed earthenware vessels, white and black</b> ones <b>are permitted. Green</b> ones <b>are prohibited, because</b> they contain <b>alum,</b> which absorbs liquids well. <b>And if</b> any of these vessels <b>have cracks in them, they are all prohibited. Mareimar taught: Glazed earthenware [<i>kunya</i>]</b> is <b>permitted, whether it is black or white or green,</b> because the coating impairs the capacity of the container to absorb liquids.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the case of <b>leavened bread on Passover,</b> which is also absorbed? The Gemara explains its question: <b>As they</b> once <b>asked Mareimar:</b> With regard to <b>these glazed earthenware vessels, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>using them on Passover?</b> The Gemara interjects: With regard to <b>green</b> earthenware, <b>do not raise the dilemma, as</b> it contains <b>alum and</b> as a result <b>absorbs</b> leaven well, <b>and</b> it is therefore <b>prohibited.</b> Rather, <b>let the dilemma be raised</b> with regard to <b>white and black</b> earthenware. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 13
The Gemara qualifies the question further: <b>Where they have cracks in them, do not raise the dilemma, as they certainly absorb</b> that which was placed in them <b>and are</b> therefore <b>prohibited.</b> Rather, <b>let the dilemma be raised where they are</b> perfectly <b>smooth: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in such a case? Mareimar <b>said</b>
