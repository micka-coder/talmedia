### Part 1
from the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who sends a barrel of wine in the hands of a Samaritan, or</b> a barrel <b>of</b> fish <b>brine or</b> a barrel <b>of fish stew in the hands of a gentile, if he recognizes his seal and his</b> manner of <b>closing</b> the barrel, it <b>is permitted; if</b> he does <b>not</b> recognize them, it <b>is prohibited.</b> Apparently, a sealed barrel is permitted only when it is recognizable.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that this is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the first <i>baraita</i> is referring to barrels located <b>in a city; there,</b> the second <i>baraita</i> is referring to barrels that the Samaritan carries <b>on the road.</b> Sealed barrels are permitted in a city because the Samaritan is careful to ensure that gentiles do not touch them in front of anyone, so that he does not forfeit the business of Jews. While traveling he is not concerned, as he assumes that no one will discover that the gentile came into contact with the wine.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya objects to this: Didn’t these</b> barrels located <b>in the city come by the road</b> as well? <b>Rather, Rabbi Yirmeya says: We learned</b> the <i>baraita</i> that permits sealed barrels only in reference to those that are located <b>between the winepresses. Since everyone is found</b> there, the Samaritan <b>is apprehensive,</b> as he <b>says</b> to himself: <b>Now, if</b> someone <b>sees me</b> allowing a gentile to handle the wine <b>they will cause me to lose</b> my profit, as Jews will not purchase it.

### Part 4
<b>It was stated: For what</b> reason did the Sages <b>prohibit the beer of gentiles? Rami bar Ḥama says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> It is <b>due to</b> the concern that Jews will befriend gentiles while drinking with them, which might lead to <b>marriage</b> with gentiles. <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> It is <b>due to</b> the concern of <b>exposure.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> form <b>of exposure</b> is there a concern? <b>If we say</b> that the concern is with regard to <b>exposure of the vat, we too expose</b> the vat, and there is no reason to prohibit gentiles’ beer more than that of Jews. <b>And</b> if you say: <b>Rather,</b> the concern is for exposure <b>of</b> the <b>barrel, we also expose</b> barrels. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to prohibit the beer <b>in a place where the water</b> used to brew it is allowed to <b>settle.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, aged</b> beer should <b>be permitted, as Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> A substance that might contain exposed water but has <b>aged</b> is <b>permitted,</b> since the poison <b>does not allow it to age,</b> as it goes bad before it grows old. Similarly, if it <b>soured</b> it is <b>permitted,</b> because the poison impairs the taste but <b>does not allow it to sour.</b> Why, then, is all beer prohibited? The Gemara answers: The Sages issued a rabbinic <b>decree</b> with regard to <b>aged</b> beer <b>due to</b> the concern with regard to <b>new</b> beer.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara cites the opinions of various Sages with regard to beer. <b>Rav Pappa</b> had them <b>bring out</b> the <b>beer</b> belonging to gentiles from the store <b>to the entrance of the store, and he</b> would <b>drink</b> it outside the store. <b>Rav Aḥai</b> had them <b>bring</b> the beer <b>to his house, and he</b> would <b>drink</b> it there. <b>And both</b> of them drank the beer away from the presence of gentiles <b>due to</b> concern about <b>marriage</b> with gentiles. The Gemara notes that <b>Rav Aḥai established an extreme preventive measure</b> for himself beyond what is required by <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 8
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Shmuel bar Bisna happened</b> to come <b>to Marguan,</b> and <b>they brought him wine but he did not drink</b> it. Next <b>they brought him beer but he did not drink</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> he did not drink the <b>wine due to</b> the <b>trace [<i>shimtza</i>]</b> of libations, but <b>due to what</b> reason did he refrain from drinking <b>beer?</b> It was <b>due to</b> concern for <b>the trace of a trace,</b> i.e., he did not drink beer due to concern about drinking wine.

### Part 9
<b>Rav says: This Aramean beer is permitted, but my son Ḥiyya does not drink from it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at this matter, Rav’s statement is difficult: <b>If</b> the beer is <b>permitted,</b> then it is <b>permitted to everyone,</b> and there is no reason for his son to refrain from drinking it. And <b>if</b> it is <b>prohibited,</b> it is <b>prohibited to everyone,</b> and why would Rav say it is permitted?

### Part 10
The Gemara explains: <b>Rather, Rav holds</b> that the prohibition is <b>due to exposure, but the bitterness of the hops</b> in the beer <b>goes and impairs the</b> snake’s <b>venom,</b> so that it is safe for an average person to drink. <b>But</b> a person of <b>weak</b> constitution <b>is weakened further</b> by the impaired venom, <b>and</b> Rav was saying: In the case of <b>my son Ḥiyya, since he is weak, he does not drink from it.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Shmuel says: All creeping animals possess venom;</b> that <b>of a snake kills,</b> whereas the venom <b>of</b> other <b>creeping animals does not kill. Shmuel said to Ḥiyya bar Rav: Son of a lion! Come and I will say to you a superior matter that your father, Rav, said. This</b> is what <b>your father said: These Arameans</b> are <b>swollen [<i>zukanei</i>] because they drink exposed</b> liquids, <b>but they did not die</b> from doing so <b>since they eat repugnant creatures and creeping animals,</b> which <b>heat their bodies</b> and thereby render them less susceptible to the venom.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Yosef says:</b>
