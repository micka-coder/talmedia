### Part 1
But if only <b>the flavor of</b> the forbidden food is recognizable in the mixture, <b>but not its substance,</b> as it was completely dissolved into the permitted food, the mixture <b>is forbidden, but one is not flogged for</b> consuming <b>it. And if</b> the forbidden food <b>amplified the flavor</b> of the permitted food <b>to its detriment,</b> it is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then <b>let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>say: If</b> the forbidden food <b>imparts flavor to</b> the <b>detriment</b> of the mixture, it is <b>permitted.</b> Why does he use the term: Amplified? The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>teaches us: That even if there are other substances that detracted</b> from the flavor of the mixture <b>along with</b> the forbidden food, e.g., insufficient salt or excessive seasoning, this is not taken into consideration; since the forbidden food detracted from its flavor, the mixture is permitted. The Gemara comments: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the last version</b> of the statement <b>of Reish Lakish.</b>

### Part 3
§ <b>Rav Kahana says: From the statements of all</b> the <i>amora’im</i> who were cited, namely, Shmuel, Rabbi Yoḥanan, and Reish Lakish, <b>we learn</b> that if a forbidden food <b>imparts flavor</b> to a permitted food <b>to</b> the <b>detriment</b> of the mixture, it is <b>permitted. Abaye said to him: Granted, from all</b> the rest <b>of them</b> this conclusion <b>is very well; but</b> how can this be concluded from the statement <b>of Reish Lakish? He says</b> only that the Sages <b>said</b> that if a forbidden food imparts flavor to a permitted food to its detriment, the mixture is permitted. Perhaps he is only citing what others said <b>and he himself does not hold accordingly.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks with regard to Rav Kahana’s statement: <b>By inference, is there one who says</b> that if a forbidden food <b>imparts flavor</b> to a permitted food <b>to</b> the <b>detriment</b> of the mixture, it is <b>forbidden?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara answer: <b>Yes, and</b> this opinion <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Both</b> in a case where the forbidden food <b>imparts flavor to</b> the <b>detriment</b> of the flavor of the permitted food, <b>and</b> in a case where it <b>imparts flavor that enhances</b> the permitted food, the mixture is <b>forbidden;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> If it <b>enhances</b> the flavor it is <b>forbidden, but</b> if it causes it <b>detriment</b> it is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Meir? He derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the case of vessels of <b>gentiles</b> that require <b>purging,</b> i.e., vessels that gentiles used for cooking, which the Torah requires that one purge through fire and ritually purify before they may be used by Jews (see Numbers 31:22–23 and mishna on 75b). <b>Is it not</b> the case that vessels of <b>gentiles</b> that require <b>purging impart flavor</b> to food that is cooked in them <b>to</b> their <b>detriment?</b> Since time has passed since the gentiles cooked non-kosher food in the vessels, the flavor that the vessels transmit to food that a Jew cooks in them is certainly detrimental, <b>and</b> yet <b>the Merciful One deems</b> their use <b>prohibited</b> without purging. <b>So too,</b> the case here <b>is no different,</b> and even if the flavor imparted by the forbidden food is a detrimental one, the mixture should be forbidden.

### Part 7
<b>And</b> the opinion of <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Shimon, who deems the mixture permitted if the flavor imparted is detrimental, can be explained <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Huna, son of Rav Ḥiyya; as Rav Huna, son of Rav Ḥiyya, says:</b> With regard to the vessels of gentiles, <b>the Torah prohibits only a pot</b> that was used for cooking <b>on that</b> very <b>day, which does not</b> yet impart flavor <b>to</b> the <b>detriment</b> of the food cooked in it. Rather, the flavor that it imparts is not considered detrimental. <b>And</b> the opinion of <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Meir, can also be explained in accordance with this statement, as in his opinion, <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a pot</b> that was used for cooking <b>on that</b> very <b>day, it is not possible that it does not detract</b> from the flavor of food that is subsequently cooked in it even <b>slightly.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reasoning</b> of <b>Rabbi Shimon?</b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that from the verse: <b>“You shall not eat of any unslaughtered animal carcass; you may give it to the resident alien [<i>la’ger</i>] who is within your gates,</b> that he may eat it” (Deuteronomy 14:21), it is derived that with regard to animal carcasses, <b>anything that is fit for a <i>ger</i></b> <i>toshav</i> to consume <b>is called an unslaughtered carcass</b> and is forbidden,
