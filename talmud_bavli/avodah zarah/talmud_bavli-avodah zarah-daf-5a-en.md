### Part 1
This serves <b>to say to you that if an individual</b> has <b>sinned, one says to him: Go to</b> that famous <b>individual</b> who sinned, King David, and learn from him that one can repent. <b>And if the community sinned, one says to</b> them: <b>Go to</b> the <b>community</b> that sinned, i.e., the Jewish people at the time of the Golden Calf.

### Part 2
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to learn about repentance both in the case of an individual and in the case of a community. The reason is <b>that if we had learned</b> this idea only with regard to <b>an individual,</b> one might have thought that he has the option to repent only <b>because his sin is not publicized. But</b> in the case of <b>a community, whose sin is publicized,</b> one might <b>say</b> that the community <b>cannot</b> repent. <b>And</b> likewise, <b>if we had learned</b> this idea only with regard to <b>a community,</b> one might have said that their repentance is accepted <b>because their prayers are more numerous</b> than those of an individual, and they are heard before God. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>an individual, whose merit is not</b> as <b>strong,</b> one might <b>say</b> that he is <b>not</b> able to repent. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach both cases.

### Part 3
<b>And this is</b> similar to that <b>which Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The saying of David, son of Yishai, and the saying of the man raised on high [<i>al</i>]”</b> (II Samuel 23:1)? This is the meaning of the verse: <b>The saying of David, son of Yishai, who raised</b> and lightened <b>the yoke [<i>ullah</i>] of repentance,</b> as he taught the power of repentance through his own example.

### Part 4
<b>And Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani</b> further <b>says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who performs one mitzva in this world,</b> the mitzva will <b>precede him and walk before him in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And your righteousness shall go before you, the glory of the Lord shall be your reward”</b> (Isaiah 58:8). <b>And</b> with regard to <b>anyone who commits one transgression,</b> that transgression will <b>shroud him and lead him on the Day of Judgment, as it is stated: “The paths of their way do wind,</b> they go up into the waste, and are lost” (Job 6:18).

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The transgression <b>is tied to him like a dog</b> and does not leave him, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Joseph and Potiphar’s wife: <b>“And he did not listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her”</b> (Genesis 39:10). This teaches that Joseph refused <b>“to lie by her” in this world,</b> which would have meant that he would have had <b>“to be with her” in the World-to-Come.</b>

### Part 6
§ The Gemara further discusses the sin of the Golden Calf. <b>Reish Lakish says: Come and let us be grateful to our ancestors</b> who sinned with the Golden Calf, <b>as had they not sinned we</b> would <b>not have come into the world.</b> Reish Lakish explains: <b>As it is stated</b> about the Jewish people after the revelation at Sinai: <b>“I said: You are godlike beings, and all of you sons of the Most High”</b> (Psalms 82:6), which indicates that they had become like angels and would not have propagated offspring. Then, God states: After <b>you ruined your deeds: “Yet you shall die like a man,</b> and fall like one of the princes” (Psalms 82:7).

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: Is this <b>to say that if they had not sinned</b> with the Golden Calf <b>they would not have sired</b> children? <b>But isn’t it written</b> that Noah and his children were instructed: <b>“And you, be fruitful, and multiply”</b> (Genesis 9:7)? The Gemara answers: This instruction was issued only <b>until</b> the revelation at <b>Sinai,</b> but the Jewish people would have become like angels there, had they not sinned. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>also written</b> about the Jewish people who were at the revelation <b>at Sinai: “Go say to them: Return to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27), which means that they were instructed to resume marital relations? The Gemara answers: That verse is referring <b>to the enjoyment of conjugal rights,</b> not to procreation.

### Part 8
The Gemara further asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “That it might be good for them, and with their children</b> forever” (Deuteronomy 5:26), which indicates that they would continue to bear children? The Gemara answers: This verse is referring <b>to those</b> children <b>who stood</b> with them <b>at Mount Sinai,</b> not to future generations.

### Part 9
The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>But doesn’t Reish Lakish say: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “This is the book of the generations of Adam,</b> in the day that God created man” (Genesis 5:1)? <b>Did Adam the first</b> man <b>have a book?</b> Rather, the verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, showed Adam, the first</b> man, <b>every generation and its expositors, every generation and its Sages,</b> and <b>every generation and its leaders. When</b> Adam <b>arrived at the generation of Rabbi Akiva, he rejoiced in his Torah and was saddened by his death,</b> as Rabbi Akiva was tortured and murdered. Adam <b>said: “How weighty also are Your thoughts to me, O God!</b> How great is the sum of them” (Psalms 139:17). It is evident from here that the Jews were destined to bear future generations from the beginning of time.

### Part 10
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The Messiah, <b>son of David, will not come until all the souls of the body have been finished,</b> i.e., until all souls that are destined to inhabit physical bodies will do so. <b>As it is stated: “For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me, and the souls that I have made”</b> (Isaiah 57:16). According to Rabbi Yosei, in order for the Messiah to come in the end of days, it is necessary for the future generations to be born.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>Do not say</b> that if our ancestors had not sinned <b>we would not have come into the world,</b> as we still would have been born; <b>rather,</b> it would have been <b>as though we had not come into the world.</b> We would have been of no importance, due to the previous generations that would have still been alive. The Gemara asks: Is this <b>to say that if</b> the Jewish people <b>had not sinned</b> with the Golden Calf then <b>they would not have died? But isn’t the chapter</b> that addresses <b>widows whose husbands die childless</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5–10) <b>written</b> in the Torah, <b>and the chapter</b> that addresses <b>the inheritance</b> a deceased father bequeaths to his sons (Numbers 27:8–11) is also written?

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: These passages were written <b>conditionally,</b> i.e., if the Jewish people were to sin and not become like angels, those <i>halakhot</i> would take effect. The Gemara asks: <b>And are verses written conditionally</b> in this manner? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day”</b> (Genesis 1:31)? This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, established a condition with the acts of Creation, and He said: If the Jewish people accept the Torah</b> at the revelation at Sinai, all is <b>well</b> and the world will continue to exist. <b>But if</b> they do <b>not</b> accept it, <b>I will return you to</b> the primordial state of <b>chaos and disorder.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> to the new formulation of Reish Lakish’s statement, according to which the Jewish people would have become immortal had they not sinned with the Golden Calf. The verse states about the Jewish people after the revelation at Sinai: <b>“Who would give that they had such a heart as this always,</b> to fear Me, and keep all My commandments, that it might be good for them, and with their children forever” (Deuteronomy 5:26). The <i>baraita</i> states that although they had reached such an elevated state, it <b>was not possible to nullify</b> the power of <b>the Angel of Death over them, as the decree</b> of death <b>was already issued</b> from the time of creation.

### Part 14
Rather, the <i>baraita</i> explains that <b>the Jewish people accepted the Torah only in order that no nation or tongue would rule over them, as it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“That it might be good for them, and with their children forever.”</b> This indicates that had the Jewish people not sinned they would not have achieved immortality, which contradicts Reish Lakish’s statement.

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish <b>said</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The Jewish people accepted the Torah only in order that the Angel of Death would not rule over them, as it is stated: “I said: You are godlike beings, and all of you sons of the Most High”</b> (Psalms 82:6), i.e., they had become immortal like angels. Then, God states: After <b>you ruined your deeds, “yet you shall die like a man,</b> and fall like one of the princes” (Psalms 82:7).

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And also,</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yosei, isn’t it written: “That it might be good for them, and with their children forever,”</b> from which it may be inferred that although <b>it</b> will be <b>good</b> for them if they remain in this elevated state, <b>there</b> will still be <b>death?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> could have <b>said to you: Since there is no death, there is no greater good than this,</b> i.e., the promise of the verse is immortality.

### Part 17
The Gemara inquires: <b>And</b> according to <b>the first <i>tanna</i> as well, isn’t it written: “Yet you shall die like a man,”</b> which indicates that their mortality was decreed only due to the sin of the Golden Calf? The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>death?</b> It means <b>poverty. As the Master said: Four are considered as</b> though they were <b>dead: These are a pauper, a blind person, a leper, and one who has no children.</b>

### Part 18
<b>A pauper</b> is considered as though dead, <b>as it is written</b> that God said to Moses: “Go, return to Egypt; <b>for all the men</b> that sought your life <b>are dead”</b> (Exodus 4:19). <b>And who were these</b> men? They were <b>Dathan and Abiram. But did they</b> really <b>die? They were</b> still alive, as they participated in the rebellion of Korah, which took place years later. <b>Rather,</b> the verse does not mean that they had died, but <b>that they had lost their property</b> and become impoverished. This demonstrates that a pauper is considered as though he were dead.

### Part 19
<b>A blind person</b> is considered as though he were dead, <b>as it is written: “He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead”</b> (Lamentations 3:6). <b>A leper</b> is considered as though he were dead, <b>as it is written</b> that Aaron said to Moses when Miriam was struck with leprosy: <b>“Let her not, I pray, be as one dead”</b> (Numbers 12:12). <b>And one who has no children</b> is considered as though he were dead, <b>as it is written</b> that Rachel said to Jacob: <b>“Give me children, or else I am dead”</b> (Genesis 30:1).

### Part 20
<b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“If you walk in My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 26:3): In this context, <b>“if”</b> is <b>a term</b> that means <b>nothing other than supplication,</b> i.e., God is hoping that the Jewish people will observe the Torah. <b>And similarly, it is stated: “Oh that My people would hearken to Me,</b> that Israel would walk in My ways, <b>I would soon subdue their enemies”</b> (Psalms 81:14–15). <b>And it states: “Oh that you would hearken to My commandments! Then your peace would be as a river,</b> and your righteousness as the waves of the sea. <b>Your seed also would be as the sand, and the offspring of your body</b> like its grains” (Isaiah 48:18–19).

### Part 21
§ The Gemara returns to a verse cited above. <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“Who would give that they had such a heart as this</b> always, to fear Me, and keep all My commandments, that it might be good for them, and with their children forever” (Deuteronomy 5:26). At a later stage, <b>Moses said to the Jewish people: Ingrates, children of ingrates! When the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the Jewish people: “Who would give that they had such a heart as this always,” they should have said: You should give</b> us a heart to fear You.

### Part 22
The Gemara explains that Moses calls the Jewish people <b>ingrates, as it is written</b> that the Jewish people spoke disparagingly of the manna: <b>“And our soul loathes</b>
