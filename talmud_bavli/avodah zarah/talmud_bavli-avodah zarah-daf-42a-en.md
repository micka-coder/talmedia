### Part 1
<b>of one violent person [<i>metzik</i>] in</b> the city of <b>Rimon, who cast a non-viable newborn into a pit, and a priest came and looked</b> into the pit <b>to ascertain whether</b> the baby was <b>male</b> or <b>whether</b> it was <b>female,</b> as the length of time of a woman’s ritual impurity after childbirth, even if she gave birth to a non-viable newborn, depends on whether the child was male or female (see Leviticus, chapter 12). <b>And the incident came before the Sages</b> to rule whether or not the priest had contracted ritual impurity while standing over the corpse, <b>and they deemed him ritually pure.</b> The basis for this ruling was <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> as <b>martens and polecats [<i>bardelas</i>] are common there,</b> it is likely that the body was dragged away before the priest arrived at the pit.

### Part 2
The Gemara concludes its objection: <b>And here,</b> in this case, <b>where</b> it is <b>certain</b> that the woman <b>cast</b> the <b>non-viable newborn</b> into the pit, and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether an animal <b>dragged it</b> away and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>no</b> animal <b>dragged it</b> away, the Sages nevertheless ruled that <b>an uncertainty comes and overrides a certainty.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara rejects this interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Do not say that</b> the woman certainly <b>cast a non-viable newborn into a pit; rather, say</b> that <b>she cast</b> an object <b>similar to a non-viable newborn into a pit.</b> Perhaps it was not the body of an infant; it might have merely been congealed blood, which does not impart impurity. Therefore, it is a conflict between uncertainty and uncertainty; it is unclear whether the item that was cast into the pit could have rendered the priest ritually impure, and even if it could have, it might have already been dragged away.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>To ascertain whether</b> it was <b>male</b> or <b>whether</b> it was <b>female,</b> indicating that the only uncertainty was with regard to its sex, as it was certainly a non-viable newborn?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> The priest attempted to examine two aspects of the miscarried entity. He sought <b>to ascertain whether</b> the woman <b>miscarried,</b> bearing <b>an amorphous mass,</b> or <b>whether she cast a non-viable newborn</b> into the pit; <b>and if you say</b> that <b>she cast a non-viable newborn,</b> he sought <b>to ascertain whether</b> it was <b>male</b> or <b>whether</b> it was <b>female.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And if you wish, say</b> that there is a different answer: This case is not a conflict between certainty and uncertainty; rather it is a conflict between certainty and certainty. <b>Since martens and polecats are common there, they certainly dragged</b> the body away. Consequently, the ruling in this case does not contradict the principle that an uncertainty does not override a certainty.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara returns to the dispute with regard to an idol that broke. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Reish Lakish from the mishna: If one <b>found</b> an object in <b>the figure of a hand</b> or in <b>the figure of a foot, these are forbidden, as</b> objects <b>similar to those are worshipped.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan asks: <b>Why</b> are they forbidden? <b>Aren’t they fragments,</b> which according to Reish Lakish should be permitted?

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t Shmuel interpret</b> the mishna as referring to a case <b>where</b> these objects <b>are standing on their pedestals,</b> which shows that they were designed this way initially?

### Part 9
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> the opinion of Reish Lakish from a mishna (52b): <b>A gentile can revoke</b> the idolatrous status of <b>his</b> own object of <b>idol worship or that of another</b> gentile, <b>but a Jew cannot revoke</b> the status of <b>a gentile’s</b> object of <b>idol worship.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan asks: <b>Why</b> can’t a Jew revoke the status of a gentile’s idol according to Reish Lakish? <b>Let it be</b> treated <b>like</b> an object of <b>idol worship that broke on its own,</b> which Reish Lakish deems permitted.

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said:</b> That mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the Jew <b>bent</b> the idol out of shape without actually breaking it. The Gemara asks: <b>And if he</b> merely <b>bent</b> the idol out of shape, <b>what of it? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (53a) that if one <b>bent</b> an idol, changing its shape, <b>even if he did not remove</b> any <b>part of it,</b> he thereby <b>revoked</b> its status as an object of idol worship?

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>This statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where a gentile bent</b> the idol, changing its shape; <b>but</b> in a case <b>where a Jew bent it,</b> changing its shape, its status as an object of idol worship <b>is not revoked.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And Rava said</b> a different answer: <b>Actually,</b> the basic <i>halakha</i> is that in a case <b>where a Jew bent it,</b> changing its shape, its status as an object of idol worship <b>is also revoked. But</b> the Sages issued <b>a decree</b> that such an idol retains its idolatrous status, <b>lest</b> a Jew first <b>lift it up and then</b> attempt to <b>revoke</b> its status. In this case the idol’s status is not revoked, as when a Jew lifts an idol he acquires it, <b>and it becomes</b> an object of <b>idol worship in a Jew’s possession, and any</b> object of <b>idol worship in a Jew’s possession can never</b> have its idolatrous status <b>revoked.</b> Therefore, only when an idol breaks on its own does Reish Lakish maintain that its status is revoked.

### Part 13
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> the opinion of Reish Lakish from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a gentile who brought stones from</b> stone heaps that were used in the worship of the deity <b>Mercury [<i>HaMarkulis</i>], and</b> who then <b>paved roads and</b> built <b>theaters [<i>vetarteiot</i>] with them,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to derive benefit from them, as the gentile revoked their idolatrous status. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a Jew who brought stones</b> that were used in the worship of <b>Mercury and</b> who then <b>paved roads and</b> built <b>theaters with them,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to derive benefit from them. Rabbi Yoḥanan asked: According to Reish Lakish, <b>why</b> does a stone such as this retain its idolatrous status? <b>Let it be</b> treated <b>like</b> an object of <b>idol worship that broke on its own,</b> which Reish Lakish deems permitted.

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: <b>Here too,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s question may be answered <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava</b> that the Sages issued a decree that an object of idol worship retains its idolatrous status when a Jew attempts to revoke it, lest the Jew lift and acquire the idol, which would make it impossible to subsequently revoke its status.

### Part 15
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> the opinion of Reish Lakish from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a gentile who shaved down</b> an object of <b>idol worship for his</b> own <b>sake,</b> as he needed the shavings, the idol itself <b>and its shavings are</b> then <b>permitted.</b> If he did it <b>for the sake of</b> the idol, to improve its appearance, the idol <b>is forbidden, but its shavings are permitted. But</b> in the case of <b>a Jew who shaved down</b> an object of <b>idol worship, whether</b> he did it <b>for his</b> own <b>sake or for the sake of</b> the idol, the idol itself <b>and its shavings are forbidden.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan asked: According to Reish Lakish, in a case where a Jew shaved the idol for his own sake, <b>why</b> are the shavings forbidden? <b>Let it be</b> treated <b>like</b> an object of <b>idol worship that broke on its own.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: <b>Here too,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s question may be answered <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava</b> that the Sages issued a decree that an object of idol worship retains its idolatrous status when a Jew attempts to cause it to be revoked.

### Part 17
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> the opinion of Reish Lakish from a mishna (43a): <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> When one encounters an idol, he should <b>grind</b> the idol <b>and throw</b> the dust <b>to the wind or cast</b> it <b>into the sea.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> What is the good of that? <b>That also</b> gives a Jew benefit from the idol, as it <b>becomes fertilizer</b> for his crops, <b>and</b> deriving any kind of benefit is prohibited, as <b>it is written:</b> “And <b>nothing of the proscribed items shall cleave to your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:18). Rabbi Yoḥanan asked: According to Reish Lakish, <b>why</b> is this prohibited? <b>Let it be</b> treated <b>like</b> an object of <b>idol worship that broke on its own.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara answers: <b>Here too,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s question may be answered <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava</b> cited above, that the Sages issued a decree with regard to this matter.

### Part 19
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> the opinion of Reish Lakish from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Yasian says:</b> If one <b>found</b> an object in <b>the figure of a dragon [<i>derakon</i>] with its head severed,</b> but it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>a gentile severed it</b> and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>a Jew severed it,</b> the object is <b>permitted.</b> But if it is <b>certain</b> that <b>a Jew severed it,</b> it is <b>forbidden.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan asked: According to Reish Lakish, <b>why</b> is it forbidden? <b>Let it be</b> treated <b>like</b> an object of <b>idol worship that broke on its own.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara answers: <b>Here too,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s question may be answered <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava</b> that the Sages issued a decree with regard to this matter.

### Part 21
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised</b> another <b>objection to</b> the opinion of Reish Lakish from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that one may <b>not even</b> plant <b>vegetables in the rainy season</b> under a tree worshipped as an idol, <b>as foliage may fall on them,</b> serving as fertilizer. Rabbi Yoḥanan asked: According to Reish Lakish, <b>why</b> should a leaf from such a tree retain its idolatrous status? <b>Let it be</b> treated <b>like</b> an object of <b>idol worship that broke on its own.</b>

### Part 22
The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as the main</b> object of <b>idol worship,</b> the tree, still <b>exists</b> fully intact.
