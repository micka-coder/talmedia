### Part 1
<b>Bring this produce</b> designated as second tithe <b>to Jerusalem for me</b> in exchange <b>for a share</b> of the produce, of which you may partake in Jerusalem. This is considered payment and is tantamount to conducting commerce with the tithe. <b>But he may say to him: Bring it</b> to Jerusalem <b>to eat it and drink it in Jerusalem,</b> as long as he does not specify that it is payment; <b>and</b> once in Jerusalem <b>they may give one another unrequited gifts.</b> This indicates that what may not be given as payment may be given as a gift, and therefore the donkey drivers may be compensated with Sabbatical-Year produce.

### Part 2
<b>And Rava says: Actually,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan means <b>that</b> the produce with which the drivers are paid is <b>sacred with the sanctity</b> of <b>Sabbatical</b>-Year produce, <b>and</b> as for <b>that which</b> poses <b>a difficulty for you</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>laborer</b> cited in the mishna, which states that his wage is not sacred, that difficulty can be resolved as follows: There is a distinction between <b>a laborer, whose wage is not great,</b> and therefore <b>the Sages did not penalize him</b> by decreeing that his wage is sacred, and <b>donkey drivers, whose wages are great,</b> and therefore <b>the Sages penalized them. And</b> with regard to <b>the mishna</b> that deems forbidden even the laborer’s wage in the case of one who produces wine designated for libation, <b>the stringency of wine</b> used for <b>a libation is different,</b> and it is treated more stringently than Sabbatical-Year produce.

### Part 3
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a gentile <b>hired</b> a Jew <b>to</b> work with him in the production of <b>nondescript wine</b> of gentiles, i.e., wine that was not used for libation, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since the prohibition</b> of deriving benefit from nondescript wine of gentiles is <b>as stringent as</b> the prohibition <b>of</b> deriving benefit from <b>wine</b> used for a <b>libation, his wage is also forbidden, or perhaps</b> should it be reasoned that <b>since</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>its</b> capacity for imparting <b>ritual impurity</b> to one who comes into contact with it is more <b>lenient</b> than the <i>halakha</i> with regard to wine used for a libation, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>its wage</b> is <b>also</b> more <b>lenient?</b>

### Part 4
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution: It is related <b>that</b> there was <b>a certain man who rented out his ship for</b> transporting <b>nondescript wine</b> of gentiles, and the gentiles <b>gave him wheat in payment. He came before Rav Ḥisda</b> to determine the status of the wheat. Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: Go burn it and bury it in a graveyard.</b> Evidently, payment for working with nondescript wine of gentiles is forbidden.

### Part 5
The Gemara raises an objection to the method of eradication of the wheat in Rav Ḥisda’s ruling. <b>But let him say to</b> the ship owner: <b>Scatter it.</b> The Gemara responds: If he scatters it, people might <b>be caused a mishap by it</b> if they find kernels of the scattered wheat and gather them for eating. The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> then <b>let him burn it and scatter it.</b> Why should it be buried? The Gemara answers: <b>Perhaps</b> people will <b>fertilize</b> their fields <b>with it.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges: <b>But let him bury</b> the wheat <b>in its unadulterated form. Didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the instruments used for imposing capital punishment: <b>The stone with which</b> a condemned person is <b>stoned, and the tree on which</b> his corpse is <b>hung</b> after his execution, <b>and the sword with which</b> he is <b>killed, and the scarf with which</b> he is <b>strangled, all</b> of them <b>are buried</b> together <b>with him,</b> as it is prohibited to derive benefit from them. The <i>baraita</i> does not require that they be burned before they are buried.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>There, since they are buried in the court</b> graveyard, <b>the matter is clear</b> to all <b>that these were executed by the court,</b> so everyone knows that using the instruments of execution is prohibited. <b>Here, the matter is not clear</b> to all, as one might <b>say</b> to himself that <b>a person stole</b> the wheat <b>and brought</b> it and <b>buried</b> it <b>here,</b> and he might thereby come to use it.

### Part 8
§ The Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai borrowed Sabbatical-</b>Year <b>produce from the poor and repaid them in the eighth</b> year. Others <b>came</b> and <b>said</b> this <b>to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> out of concern that by doing so they violated the prohibition against engaging in commerce with Sabbatical-Year produce. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to them: They are acting properly,</b> as this is not considered commerce.

### Part 9
<b>And in the corresponding</b> case concerning <b>payment</b> to a prostitute for services rendered, it is <b>permitted</b> to sacrifice such an animal as an offering. Although the Torah prohibits the sacrifice of an animal used as a prostitute’s payment (see Deuteronomy 23:19), in a case similar to this one, it is permitted; <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the man <b>gave</b> the prostitute payment <b>but did not engage in intercourse with her,</b> or if <b>he engaged in intercourse with her but did not give her</b> payment, it is <b>permitted</b> for <b>her payment</b> to serve as an offering.

### Part 10
The Gemara discusses difficulties with the wording of the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he gave her</b> payment <b>but did not engage in intercourse with her,</b> isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that it is permitted? <b>Since he did not engage in intercourse with her, it is merely a gift that he has given her,</b> and there is no reason for it to be forbidden. Why does the <i>baraita</i> need to state this? <b>And furthermore,</b> with regard to the case in the <i>baraita</i> where <b>he engaged in intercourse with her but did not give her</b> payment, <b>he did not give her anything, and since he did not give her</b> payment, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the statement that <b>her payment</b> is <b>permitted?</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If <b>he gave her</b> payment <b>and afterward,</b> after some time elapsed, <b>he engaged in intercourse with her, or</b> if <b>he engaged in intercourse with her and afterward,</b> after some time elapsed, <b>he gave her</b> payment, <b>her payment is permitted,</b> because the payment was not given proximate to the intercourse. This is also the <i>halakha</i> in the case of borrowing Sabbatical-Year produce, i.e., paying for it after time has elapsed is not considered commerce.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: If the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where <b>he gave her</b> payment <b>and afterward engaged in intercourse with her,</b> then <b>when he engaged in intercourse with her,</b>
