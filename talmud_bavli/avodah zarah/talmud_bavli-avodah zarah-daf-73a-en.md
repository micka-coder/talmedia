<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna himself drank from a <i>kenishkanin</i>.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Wine</b> used for <b>a libation</b> is <b>forbidden, and any amount</b> of it <b>renders</b> other wine <b>forbidden</b> if they are mixed together. <b>Wine</b> used for a libation that became mixed <b>with wine, or water</b> that was used for an idolatrous libation that became mixed <b>with</b> ordinary <b>water,</b> renders the mixture forbidden <b>with any amount</b> of the forbidden wine or water; but <b>wine</b> used for a libation that became mixed <b>with water, or water</b> used for a libation that became mixed <b>with wine</b> renders the mixture forbidden only if the forbidden liquid is sufficient <b>to impart flavor</b> to the mixture, i.e., for the wine to flavor the water or for the water to dilute the wine to an extent that can be tasted.

### Part 3
<b>This is the principle: A substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance</b> renders the mixture forbidden <b>with any amount</b> of the forbidden substance, <b>but</b> a substance in contact <b>with a different</b> type of <b>substance</b> renders the mixture forbidden only <b>in</b> a case where it <b>imparts flavor</b> to it.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he reported that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of <b>one who pours wine</b> used for <b>a libation from a barrel into</b> a wine <b>cistern, even</b> if he does this <b>all day long,</b> the forbidden wine is <b>nullified little by little</b> upon contact with the wine in the cistern, and the wine is consequently permitted.

### Part 5
The Gemara raises an objection to the <i>halakha</i> reported by Rav Dimi from that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Wine</b> used for <b>a libation is forbidden, and any amount</b> of it <b>renders</b> other wine <b>forbidden. What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where the forbidden substance fell into the permitted substance,</b> as in the case of Rav Dimi’s statement? The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where the permitted substance fell into the forbidden substance.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a further objection to the <i>halakha</i> reported by Rav Dimi from the continuation of the mishna: <b>Wine</b> that became mixed <b>with water</b> renders the mixture forbidden if it is sufficient <b>to impart flavor</b> to it. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where forbidden wine fell into permitted water,</b> and contrary to Rav Dimi’s statement, the wine is not nullified but instead renders the mixture forbidden the moment there is a sufficient amount of it to impart flavor? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where permitted wine fell into forbidden water,</b> and as long as the water influences the flavor of the wine, it is forbidden.

### Part 7
The Gemara challenges: <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that the first clause</b> is referring <b>to forbidden water,</b> by inference, <b>the latter clause also</b> dealing <b>with forbidden water, and the latter clause teaches: Water</b> that became mixed <b>with wine</b> renders the mixture forbidden <b>in</b> a case where it <b>imparts flavor</b> to it. The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Dimi</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>the entire mishna</b> is dealing with <b>permitted substances</b> falling <b>into forbidden substances, and the first clause</b> is dealing with a case <b>where permitted wine fell into forbidden water,</b> while <b>the latter clause</b> is dealing with a case <b>where permitted water fell into forbidden wine.</b>

### Part 8
<b>When Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he reported that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of <b>one who pours wine</b> used for <b>a libation from a small canteen into</b> a wine <b>cistern, even</b> if he did so <b>all day long,</b> the forbidden wine is <b>nullified little by little</b> in the permitted wine. <b>And</b> this applies <b>specifically</b> to <b>a small canteen, whose stream is not significant. But</b> if one pours wine from <b>a barrel, whose stream is significant,</b> this does <b>not</b> apply.

### Part 9
§ <b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation that fell into</b> a wine <b>cistern, and</b> where <b>a pitcher of water</b> also <b>fell there, one considers the permitted</b> wine <b>as though it is nonexistent,</b> and it is not rendered forbidden by the wine used for a libation; <b>and</b> with regard to <b>the rest,</b> i.e., the wine used for a libation, the volume of the <b>water is greater than</b> the volume of the wine <b>and nullifies it.</b>

### Part 10
<b>When Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda came</b> from Eretz Yisrael he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <b>only</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> the <b>pitcher of water fell</b> in <b>first, but</b> if the <b>pitcher of water did not fall</b> in <b>first,</b> the wine used for a libation <b>has found its</b> own <b>type,</b> i.e., the wine in the cistern, <b>and been awakened.</b> In other words, the wine used for a libation renders the wine in the cistern forbidden, causing the volume of the wine that is forbidden to become larger, and the water that subsequently falls in is not sufficient to nullify all of the wine.

### Part 11
The Gemara comments: <b>There are those who teach this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the mishna,</b> which states that <b>wine</b> used for a libation that became mixed <b>with</b> permitted <b>wine</b> renders it forbidden with <b>any amount. Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> this <b>only</b> with regard to a case <b>where a pitcher of water did not</b> also <b>fall</b> into the permitted wine; <b>but</b> if <b>a pitcher of water fell there, one considers the permitted</b> wine <b>as though it is nonexistent,</b> and it is not rendered forbidden by the wine used for a libation, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>the rest,</b> i.e., the wine used for a libation, the volume of the <b>water is greater than</b> the volume of the wine <b>and nullifies it.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the one <b>who teaches</b> this <b>about the mishna and</b> the one <b>who teaches it about</b> the statement <b>of Ravin?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>The one who teaches it about the mishna does not need</b> for the pitcher of water to have fallen in <b>first;</b> in any event the water nullifies the forbidden wine. <b>But the one who teaches it about</b> the statement <b>of Ravin</b> adds to Ravin’s statement, and so he <b>needs</b> the pitcher of water to have fallen in <b>first.</b>

### Part 13
§ <b>It was stated</b> that in a case of <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation that fell into</b> a wine <b>cistern, and</b> where <b>a pitcher of water</b> also <b>fell there,</b>
