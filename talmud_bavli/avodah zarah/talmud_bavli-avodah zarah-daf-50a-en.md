### Part 1
Furthermore, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>also</b> in the case of stones that are <b>near</b> the stone pile dedicated to Mercury, with regard to <b>which</b> it <b>can be said</b> that they <b>fell from it, they are prohibited.</b> Rabbi Yishmael and the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> only <b>when</b> the stones are <b>distant.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the stones are <b>at</b> the <b>side of Mercury,</b> indicating that they are nearby. The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is meant by the term: <b>At</b> the <b>side</b> of Mercury? It means <b>at</b> the <b>side of its four cubits.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara clarifies the dispute: <b>Rabbi Yishmael holds</b> that at times, idol worshippers initially <b>construct a small</b> stone pile dedicated to <b>Mercury at</b> the <b>side of a large</b> stone pile dedicated to <b>Mercury.</b> Therefore, <b>three</b> stones, <b>which resemble</b> a complete pile dedicated to <b>Mercury, are prohibited. Two</b> stones, which do not resemble a stone pile dedicated to Mercury, <b>are permitted.</b> Conversely, <b>the Rabbis hold</b> that idol worshippers <b>do not construct a small</b> stone pile dedicated to <b>Mercury at</b> the <b>side of a large</b> stone pile dedicated to <b>Mercury.</b> Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> <b>is not different</b> in a case where there are <b>three</b> stones, <b>and</b> it <b>is not different</b> in a case where there are <b>two</b> stones. In both cases those stones that <b>can be seen</b> together <b>with</b> the pile dedicated to Mercury <b>are prohibited,</b> as they may have fallen from it, whereas those <b>that cannot be seen</b> together <b>with</b> the stone pile <b>are permitted.</b>

### Part 4
§ <b>The Master said: In</b> a case where <b>it is known that</b> these stones <b>fell from it, everyone agrees</b> that <b>they are prohibited. And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement from his statement presented in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>stones that fell from</b> a pile dedicated to <b>Mercury,</b> those that <b>can be seen</b> together <b>with it are prohibited;</b> those <b>that cannot be seen</b> together <b>with it are permitted. And Rabbi Yishmael says: Three</b> stones <b>are prohibited,</b> but <b>two</b> stones <b>are permitted.</b> The <i>baraita</i> indicates that Rabbi Yishmael and the Rabbis also disagree where it is known that the stones fell from the stone pile. <b>Rava said: Do not say</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: Stones <b>that fell</b> from a pile. <b>Rather, say:</b> Stones <b>that were found</b> adjacent to the pile. There is no certainty that they fell from the pile.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> actually <b>hold</b> that <b>two</b> stones that are found adjacent to the pile <b>are permitted? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: Two</b> stones that are found <b>in</b> the <b>area of</b> the pile dedicated to Mercury <b>are prohibited. Three</b> stones <b>are prohibited, even</b> if they are found <b>at a distance.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, it is referring to a case <b>where</b> both the pile and the adjacent stones <b>are in the same area,</b> in which case the stones are forbidden. <b>There,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, it is referring to a case <b>where</b> they <b>are in two</b> adjacent <b>areas,</b> in which case they are permitted. <b>And what is considered</b> two adjacent areas? This is referring to a case <b>where there is an elevated</b> area <b>between them,</b> and evidently the stones did not fall from the pile.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And are</b> stones that are merely adjacent to each other <b>in this way</b> considered a pile dedicated to <b>Mercury? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These are</b> the <b>stones of a place of</b> worship dedicated to <b>Mercury: One</b> stone is situated <b>on</b> one <b>side and one</b> is situated <b>on</b> the other <b>side, and one</b> is situated <b>atop of them,</b> but not where the stones are merely adjacent to each other? <b>Rava said: When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is <b>with regard to the main</b> pile of stones dedicated to <b>Mercury,</b> but the stones that are added to it are not necessarily arranged in this way.

### Part 8
§ The Gemara relates: <b>The house of King Yannai was destroyed,</b> and <b>gentiles came</b> and <b>placed</b> stones dedicated to <b>Mercury in it.</b> Later, <b>other gentiles who did not worship Mercury came</b> and <b>took those</b> stones <b>and paved paths and streets with them. There</b> were <b>Rabbis who withdrew</b> from these paths, <b>and there</b> were other <b>Rabbis who did not withdraw</b> from these paths.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The son of holy ones walks on them. Should we withdraw from them?</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the person referred to as <b>the son of holy ones?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>Rabbi Menaḥem, son of Rabbi Simai. And why did they call him the son of holy ones?</b> They did so <b>because</b> Rabbi Menaḥem <b>would not even gaze at</b> the <b>form on a coin,</b> as it was sometimes an idolatrous symbol.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of the one who withdraws</b> from those paths? <b>He holds in accordance with that which Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that with regard to an offering</b> brought in <b>idolatrous worship,</b> there can <b>never</b> be any <b>nullification</b> of its prohibited status? This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “They joined themselves to Baal of Peor, and ate the offerings to the dead”</b> (Psalms 106:28). <b>Just as</b> the prohibited status of <b>a corpse has no nullification,</b> and it is <b>forever</b> prohibited to derive benefit from it, <b>so too,</b> the prohibited status of <b>an offering</b> brought in <b>idolatrous worship has no nullification ever.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And the one who does not withdraw</b> from those paths <b>says:</b> In order for idol worship to prohibit an offering <b>I require</b> the offering to be <b>like</b> those offerings sacrificed <b>inside</b> the Temple, <b>and there is no</b> parallel to this offering in the Temple service, as stones are not brought as offerings.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Yosef bar Abba said: Rabba bar Yirmeya happened</b> to come <b>to our locale, and</b> when <b>he came he brought</b> the following <b><i>baraita</i> with him:</b> In the case of <b>a gentile who brought stones from</b> a pile dedicated to <b>Mercury and paved paths and theaters with them,</b>
