### Part 1
the area <b>is treated</b> as <b>half and half</b>  with regard to withdrawing into his property before rebuilding the wall; he may build the wall four cubits from the middle of that space.

### Part 2
<b>The stones of</b> the fallen wall, <b>its wood, and its dust, transmit impurity like a creeping animal,</b> i.e., one who touches them becomes impure like one who touches a creeping animal, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, and be accursed like it; <b>you shall detest it [<i>shakketz teshakketzennu</i>],</b> and you shall abhor it; for it is a proscribed item” (Deuteronomy 7:26). The term <i>shakketz</i> is used in a different form, <i>shekketz</i>, with regard to creeping animals.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Those items transmit impurity <b>like a menstruating woman, as it is stated: “You will put them far away as a menstruating woman; you shall say to it: Go away”</b> (Isaiah 30:22). <b>Just as a menstruating woman transmits impurity by carrying,</b> as one who moves a menstruating woman, even without touching her, becomes impure, <b>so too,</b> objects of <b>idol worship transmit impurity by carrying.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one must rebuild his wall at a distance from the house of idol worship. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> how may one do so? <b>Isn’t he creating more space for the</b> house of <b>idol worship? Rav Ḥanina of Sura said:</b> This is not a problem, <b>as he converts</b> the empty space into <b>a bathroom.</b>

### Part 5
Since the mishna teaches that no wall may be built in that space, the bathroom is apparently not enclosed. The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> a bathroom <b>need</b> to be in a place of <b>modesty?</b> The Gemara answers: This is not a problem, <b>as he converts it</b> into <b>a bathroom for nighttime,</b> when no one can see him.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t the master say</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Who is a modest person? One who defecates at night in</b> the same <b>place that he defecates during the day,</b> i.e., in a place where no one can see him? <b>And although we interpreted</b> the <i>baraita</i> as referring not to location but to conduct, teaching that one must conduct himself at night <b>in the same manner,</b> i.e., with the same degree of modesty, as he does during the day with regard to removing his clothing when defecating (see <i>Berakhot</i> 62a), <b>nevertheless,</b> it can be inferred from here that even at night one <b>is required to observe</b> the dictates of <b>modesty.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: This is not a problem, <b>as he converts it</b> into a bathroom <b>for children,</b> who are not required to observe the same level of modesty.

### Part 8
The Gemara suggests a different answer to the problem of enlarging the space used for idolatry: <b>Alternatively,</b> one can answer <b>that he fences</b> in the four-cubit space <b>with thorns and shrubs,</b> thereby preventing its use.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to idol worship <b>there are three</b> types of <b>houses,</b> each with its own <i>halakhot</i>. <b>A house that one built initially for</b> the purpose of <b>idol worship is forbidden,</b> i.e., it is prohibited to derive benefit from such a house. If one <b>plastered</b> a house <b>or cemented it for</b> the purpose of <b>idol worship, and he</b> thereby <b>added</b> a layer to the walls of the house, one <b>removes that which he added,</b> and the rest of the house is permitted. If one <b>brought</b> an object of <b>idol worship into</b> a house temporarily <b>and</b> then <b>removed it,</b> the house <b>is</b> then <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav says: One who bows to a house has rendered it forbidden.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>Evidently,</b> Rav <b>holds</b> that an item that was <b>detached and</b> that <b>one subsequently attached is considered as</b> if it were still <b>detached.</b> Consequently, a house, which is attached to the ground but was built with materials that were detached from the ground, can become forbidden through worship. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that if a house was initially <b>built</b> for the purpose of idol worship, it is forbidden? This indicates that the house becomes forbidden only when it is initially constructed for idolatrous purposes.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers that there are two cases where the house is rendered forbidden: If one <b>built it</b> for purposes of idol worship, <b>even if he did not bow to it,</b> or if <b>he bowed to it, even if he did not build it</b> for purposes of idol worship; it is forbidden in either case. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why does the mishna list only <b>these three</b> types of houses, when <b>there are</b> really <b>four?</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>Since with regard to</b> the <b>revocation</b> of their idolatrous status there is no difference between a house that one <b>built</b> for idolatrous purposes <b>and</b> a house that one <b>bowed</b> down to, the mishna <b>considers them</b> as <b>one.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to idol worship <b>there are three</b> types of <b>stones,</b> each with its own <i>halakhot</i>. <b>A stone that</b> one <b>initially hewed for</b> use in <b>a platform [<i>bimos</i>]</b> for an idol <b>is forbidden.</b> If one <b>plastered</b> a stone <b>or cemented it for the sake of idol worship, one removes that which he plastered or cemented and</b> the stone <b>is permitted.</b> If one <b>erected</b> an object of <b>idol worship upon</b> a stone <b>and</b> subsequently <b>removed it,</b> the stone <b>is</b> then <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one may not derive benefit from a stone plastered or cemented for the sake of idol worship. <b>Rabbi Ami says: And</b> that <b>is</b> the <i>halakha</i> provided <b>that one plastered or cemented within the stone itself,</b> by carving or engraving into it. If the plaster or cement was merely appended to the outside of the stone as an external ornament, the stone is not forbidden.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna the <i>halakha</i> with regard to stones immediately following the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a house utilized for idol worship? This indicates that the <i>halakha</i> of a stone is <b>similar to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a house. And</b> in the case of <b>a house</b> that was rendered forbidden when it was plastered or cemented for idol worship, that plastering was <b>not</b> done <b>within the house itself,</b> but on the exterior of its walls, <b>and</b> even so it is <b>rendered forbidden.</b> Accordingly, even external plastering should render the stone forbidden. The Gemara answers: In the case of <b>a house</b> it can <b>also</b> be explained that the plaster or cement was added to the house itself, as <b>there is</b> space <b>in between the bricks</b> that can be filled in.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: As the mishna does not specify, <b>are we not dealing</b> even with a house <b>that one plastered</b> with no idolatrous purpose <b>and</b> then <b>plastered again</b> on top of that layer for the sake of idol worship, rendering the house forbidden even without affecting the house itself?

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Ami was not explaining at what point a stone plastered for idolatry becomes forbidden; <b>rather, when Rabbi Ami’s</b> statement <b>was stated, it was stated with regard to revocation</b> of the stone’s idolatrous status, <b>and</b> he taught that <b>even if one plastered or cemented within the stone itself, when one removes that which was added,</b> it is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara explains Rabbi Ami’s ruling: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>since one plastered or cemented within the stone itself, it is equivalent to a stone that one initially hewed for idol worship, and</b> there-fore the <b>entire</b> stone is <b>forbidden,</b> Rabbi Ami <b>teaches us</b> that the stone can become permitted by the removal of the additional layer of plaster.
