### Part 1
<b>This vinegar</b> made <b>of Aramean beer is prohibited, as they mix in it yeast of wine</b> used for <b>a libation. Rav Ashi said: But</b> vinegar <b>from a storeroom is permitted, since</b> if another substance is <b>mixed with it, it would spoil</b> over time.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And Hadrianic earthenware</b> is prohibited. The Gemara asks: <b>What is Hadrianic</b> earthenware? <b>Rav Yehuda says that Shmuel says:</b> It is <b>earthenware of Emperor Hadrian. When Rav Dimi came, he said: There was</b> an expanse of <b>virgin soil that no man</b> had <b>ever tilled</b> before, and Hadrian <b>tilled it and planted</b> grapevines in <b>it,</b> which yielded wine of the highest quality. <b>And</b> they <b>placed</b> this <b>wine in white jugs, and</b> the jugs <b>absorbed the wine. And they</b> would <b>break</b> the jugs into <b>shards and carry</b> the shards <b>with them, and anywhere that they stopped, they soaked</b> these shards in water <b>and drank</b> the water. The Gemara notes that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: And our first-</b>rate wine <b>is like</b> the wine produced by the <b>third</b> usage of <b>their</b> Hadrianic earthenware.

### Part 3
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if one wishes to use such shards <b>to support the legs of a bed with them?</b> Is one who <b>desires</b> a prohibited item’s continued <b>existence</b> in order <b>to</b> use it for <b>another matter,</b> i.e., not for the prohibited purpose, <b>permitted</b> to use it <b>or prohibited</b> from doing so? In this case, no benefit whatsoever is derived from the wine absorbed within the shards, but the shards themselves are being used to support the bed.

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma, <b>as Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> engaged in a dispute in this case: <b>One prohibited</b> using the shards in such a fashion, <b>and one permitted</b> this practice. The Gemara adds: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of the Sage <b>who prohibited</b> it.

### Part 5
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> to the Sage who deems it permitted: With regard to <b>the jugs [<i>dardurin</i>] and flagons [<i>rokva’ot</i>] of gentiles</b> that have <b>a Jew’s wine contained in them,</b> one is <b>prohibited from drinking</b> the wine, <b>but</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it. The Gemara notes that <b>Shimon ben Guda testified before the son of Rabban Gamliel with regard to Rabban Gamliel that he drank from it in Akko, but</b> the Sages <b>did not concede to</b> the ramifications of his testimony.

### Part 6
Concerning <b>wineskins</b> that <b>belong to gentiles, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Kefusai:</b> It is <b>prohibited to fashion from them</b> items such as <b>blankets to</b> cover <b>a donkey,</b> as one derives benefit from them. The Gemara explains the objection: <b>And here,</b> in the case of wineskins used as donkey covers, <b>he desires its</b> continued <b>existence for another matter, and</b> yet the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to use it for this purpose.

### Part 7
The Gemara retorts: <b>And according to your reasoning, it should be prohibited to sell jugs belonging to gentiles,</b> and yet Jews sell them frequently; <b>what is different</b> about <b>wineskins,</b> from which one may not derive indirect benefit, <b>and what is different</b> about <b>jugs,</b> which may be sold for indirect benefit? The Gemara answers that <b>Rava says:</b> There is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> that one may not sell wineskins of gentiles <b>lest his</b> own <b>wineskin break</b> open, <b>and</b> to repair it <b>he would take</b> the gentile’s wineskin <b>and sew it onto his wineskin.</b> This would cause the wine absorbed in the gentile’s wineskin to mix with the wine of the Jew and render it forbidden.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that someone who <b>desires</b> the continued <b>existence of</b> a prohibited item <b>for another matter is prohibited</b> from using the item in this way, <b>what is different</b> about <b>jugs that</b> purchasing them is <b>permitted?</b> The Gemara explains that this Sage could have <b>said to you: There,</b> with regard to the jugs, <b>there is no substantive prohibited</b> entity, whereas <b>here,</b> in the case of Hadrianic earthenware, <b>there is a substantive prohibited</b> entity, as the wine is recognizable in the earthenware.

### Part 9
§ It was stated that Shimon ben Guda provided testimony, <b>but</b> the Sages <b>did not concede</b> to its ramifications. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction:</b> With regard to <b>wine that comes in the flagons of gentiles,</b> one is <b>prohibited from drinking</b> the wine, <b>but</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it. <b>Shimon ben Guda testified before the son of Rabban Gamliel with regard to Rabban Gamliel that he drank from it in Akko, and they conceded to him.</b> This directly contradicts the episode cited above.

### Part 10
The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the sentence: <b>But they did not concede to</b> the ramifications of his testimony, <b>which was stated there,</b> in the first account? The meaning is that the rest of <b>his entire company,</b> i.e., the Sages, did not concede, <b>but his son did concede to him. If you wish, say</b> instead that <b>Guda</b> with the letter <i>alef</i>, as stated in the first episode, is <b>discrete, and Guda</b> with an <i>ayin</i>, in the second account, is <b>discrete,</b> i.e., the two incidents are not referring to the same individual.

### Part 11
§ The mishna further teaches: <b>And hides</b> with a tear opposite the <b>heart</b> are prohibited. <b>The Sages taught: What is</b> considered <b>a hide</b> with a tear opposite the <b>heart? Any</b> hide <b>that is torn opposite the heart and incised</b> in a shape <b>similar to an aperture,</b> and which <b>has a trace of</b> coagulated <b>blood on it,</b> is <b>prohibited.</b>
