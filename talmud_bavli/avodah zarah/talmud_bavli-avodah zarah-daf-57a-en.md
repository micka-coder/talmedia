### Part 1
I should delay my ruling, <b>as if I find a <i>tanna</i> who prohibits</b> the wine <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan, I will prohibit even</b> deriving <b>benefit from it;</b> this is difficult. Rabbi Natan prohibits one from deriving benefit from wine that was touched by a gentile, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a gentile <b>measured</b> a Jew’s wine, <b>whether</b> he measured it <b>with</b> his <b>hand or with</b> his <b>foot, it may be sold. Rabbi Natan says:</b> If he measured it <b>with</b> his <b>hand</b> it is <b>prohibited,</b> but if he measured it <b>with</b> his <b>foot</b> it is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara explains why the suggestion that Shmuel delayed his ruling because of the opinion of Rabbi Natan is difficult: <b>Say that Rabbi Natan said</b> that the wine is forbidden when the gentile measured it <b>with</b> his <b>hand. Did he say</b> that the wine is forbidden if he measured it <b>with</b> his <b>foot? Rather,</b> Shmuel delayed ruling on the matter <b>because</b> he thought to himself: <b>If I find</b> another <b><i>tanna</i> who permits</b> the wine <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that if a gentile touches wine without intending to render it a libation, it is permitted, <b>I will permit</b> the wine <b>even for drinking.</b>

### Part 3
<b>There was a certain incident in Biram that</b> occurred as follows: There was <b>a certain gentile who was climbing a palm tree and he brought</b> down with him <b>a palm branch. While he was descending</b> from the tree <b>he unintentionally touched</b> some <b>wine with the tip of the palm branch. Rav permitted</b> the owners <b>to sell</b> the wine <b>to gentiles.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav: But wasn’t it</b> you, <b>Master, who said:</b> If a gentile <b>baby</b> who is <b>one day old</b> touches wine, <b>he renders</b> it <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation,</b> even though he lacks any intent? Rav <b>said to them: Say that I said</b> that the baby renders the wine prohibited <b>for drinking. Did I say</b> that it is prohibited <b>to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it? It is therefore permitted to sell the wine.

### Part 5
§ The Gemara cites Rav’s statement in order to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav says:</b> If a gentile <b>baby</b> who is <b>one day old</b> touches wine, <b>he renders</b> it <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation,</b> even though he lacks any intent.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya raised an objection to</b> the statement of <b>Rav</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who purchases from the gentiles slaves who have been circumcised but have not immersed</b> in a ritual bath, <b>and also</b> with regard to <b>the sons of the</b> gentile <b>maidservants who</b> grew up in a Jew’s home and <b>were circumcised but did not immerse</b> in a ritual bath, their conversion is not yet valid. They have the legal status of gentiles, who transmit impurity like a <i>zav</i>, a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge. <b>Their spittle and objects upon which they tread,</b> even if they are found <b>in the marketplace,</b> are <b>ritually impure. But some say</b> that they are <b>ritually pure.</b>

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>their wine,</b> the <b>adults render</b> the wine that they touch <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation,</b> but the <b>minors do not render</b> the wine that they touch <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation. And which</b> slaves <b>are</b> considered <b>adults, and which</b> slaves <b>are</b> considered <b>minors?</b> The <b>adults</b> are those who <b>know</b> the <b>nature of idol worship and its accessories,</b> and the <b>minors</b> are those who do <b>not know</b> the <b>nature of idol worship and its accessories.</b>

### Part 8
<b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that with regard to <b>adults, yes,</b> the wine they touch is rendered prohibited, but with regard to <b>minors, no,</b> the wine they touch is not rendered prohibited. This contradicts the statement of Rav. The Gemara replies: <b>Interpret</b> the distinction between adults and minors as referring <b>to</b> the <b>sons of maidservants.</b> Since they were raised in a Jewish home, there is less reason for concern lest they render the wine an idolatrous libation, and therefore the Sages did not prohibit wine touched by minors. This distinction does not apply in the case of slaves that were purchased from gentiles.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>Doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> applies to slaves purchased from gentiles <b>and also</b> to the sons of gentile maidservants, indicating that there is no differentiation between them? The Gemara replies: The <i>baraita</i> equates the two cases only <b>with regard to</b> the impurity of <b>their spittle and</b> of the <b>objects upon which they tread.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that their spittle and the objects upon which they tread are <b>impure. But according to the one who says</b> that they are <b>pure, what can be said?</b> If the spittle of the slaves and the objects upon which they tread are pure, clearly the <i>halakha</i> is the same in the case of the sons of maidservants, and it is unnecessary to state this. One may therefore conclude that the <i>baraita</i> equated the two cases with regard to the status of the wine that they touch.

### Part 11
The Gemara replies: Even if the <i>baraita</i> is equating the two cases with regard to the status of the wine that they touch, it is not equating them with regard to the distinction between adults and minors. Rather, <b>this teaches us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>slaves</b> is <b>similar to</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>sons of maidservants. Just as</b> in the case of the <b>sons of maidservants, it is</b> only those who were <b>circumcised but did not immerse who render</b> the wine that they touch <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation,</b> but those who were <b>circumcised and immersed</b> do <b>not; so too</b> in the case of <b>slaves,</b> once they have immersed in a ritual bath they do not render wine prohibited.

### Part 12
This <i>halakha</i> is <b>to the exclusion of that</b> which <b>Rav Naḥman</b> says that <b>Shmuel says, as Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> In the case of <b>one who purchases slaves from the gentiles, even though</b> the slaves were <b>circumcised and immersed</b> in a ritual bath, they still <b>render</b> the wine that they touch <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation,</b> as they are accustomed to idolatrous practices, <b>until</b> reference to <b>idol worship disappears from their mouths.</b> The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> their wine is <b>not</b> prohibited.

### Part 13
§ The Gemara cites the aforementioned statement in order to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> In the case of <b>one who purchases slaves from the gentiles, even though</b> the slaves were <b>circumcised and immersed</b> in a ritual bath, they still <b>render</b> the wine that they touch <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation,</b> as they are accustomed to idolatrous practices, <b>until</b> reference to <b>idol worship disappears from their mouths. And how much</b> time does this take? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> One does not assume that the slave has forgotten his idolatrous worship <b>until twelve months</b> have passed.

### Part 14
<b>Rabba raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who purchases from the gentiles slaves that have been circumcised but have not immersed</b> in a ritual bath, <b>and also</b> with regard to <b>the sons of the</b> gentile <b>maidservants who</b> grew up in a Jew’s home and <b>were circumcised but did not immerse</b> in a ritual bath, their conversion is not valid and they have the legal status of gentiles. <b>Their spittle and objects upon which they tread,</b>
