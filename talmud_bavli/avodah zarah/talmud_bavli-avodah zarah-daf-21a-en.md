### Part 1
<b>one may rent houses to</b> gentiles, <b>but</b> one may <b>not</b> rent <b>fields. And outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>one may sell houses and rent fields to</b> gentiles; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says: In Eretz Yisrael one may rent houses to</b> gentiles <b>but</b> one may <b>not</b> rent <b>fields. And in Syria one may sell houses to them and rent fields, and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>one may sell</b> both <b>these,</b> houses, <b>and those,</b> fields.

### Part 2
<b>Even in a place</b> with regard to <b>which</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that it is permitted for a Jew <b>to rent</b> a house to a gentile, <b>they did not say</b> that one may rent it <b>for</b> use as <b>a residence, because</b> the gentile will <b>bring</b> objects of <b>idol worship into it, as it is stated: “You shall not bring an abomination into your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26), and this is still considered the house of a Jew. <b>And</b> for the same reason, <b>in every place, one may not rent a bathhouse to</b> a gentile, <b>since it is called by the name of</b> the owner, and onlookers will think that the Jew is operating it on Shabbat.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What</b> is the meaning of the mishna’s statement: <b>Needless to say</b> one may not allow gentiles to rent <b>fields?</b> Why is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to fields more obvious than the <i>halakha</i> of houses? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>because</b> allowing a gentile to rent a field <b>entails two</b> problems, <b>one</b> of which is aiding gentiles in <b>encamping</b> in the <b>land, and</b> the other <b>one</b> is <b>that</b> doing so <b>releases</b> the land <b>from</b> the mitzva of separating <b>tithe,</b> this cannot be correct.

### Part 4
The Gemara explains why that cannot be the reason: <b>If that is so,</b> the same can be said about the prohibition against renting <b>houses,</b> as it <b>also involves two</b> problems: <b>One</b> is aiding gentiles in <b>encamping</b> in the <b>land, and</b> the other <b>one</b> is <b>that</b> it <b>releases</b> the house <b>from</b> the mitzva of <b><i>mezuza</i>. Rav Mesharshiyya says</b> in response: Affixing <b>a <i>mezuza</i> is the obligation of the resident,</b> rather than an obligation that applies to the house. Therefore, if no Jew lives in a house, it is not subject to the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>. This means that by renting a house to a gentile one is not removing the right to perform the mitzva from the house.

### Part 5
The mishna teaches: <b>In Syria one may rent</b> houses but not fields to gentiles. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>selling</b> houses <b>that</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted to sell houses in Syria? The Gemara answers that it is prohibited <b>due to</b> a concern that this will ultimately result in the <b>selling</b> of houses <b>in Eretz Yisrael.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>If that is so, let us also issue a decree</b> prohibiting <b>renting</b> houses to gentiles in Syria, lest it lead to renting to gentiles in Eretz Yisrael. The Gemara explains: The prohibition against renting houses to gentiles in Eretz Yisrael <b>is itself</b> a rabbinic <b>decree</b> lest one come to sell the houses, <b>and shall we arise and issue</b> one <b>decree to</b> prevent the violation of another <b>decree?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> the prohibition against <b>renting a field that is in Syria is</b> also <b>a decree</b> whose purpose is <b>to</b> prevent the violation of another <b>decree,</b> as the prohibition against allowing a gentile to rent one’s field in Eretz Yisrael is a rabbinic decree, <b>and</b> yet <b>we</b> still <b>issue the decree.</b> The Gemara explains: According to Rabbi Meir, <b>there,</b> with regard to selling houses and fields in Syria to gentiles, the prohibition <b>is not</b> merely <b>a decree</b> intended to prevent the violation of the decree with regard to Eretz Yisrael. Rather, Rabbi Meir <b>holds</b> that the <b>conquest of an individual is called a conquest.</b> Once Syria was conquered by King David, who is considered an individual in this regard, the sanctity of Eretz Yisrael applied to it.

### Part 7
Therefore, <b>concerning a field, which has two</b> problems, as one releases the land from the mitzva of separating tithes and aids gentiles in acquiring land in Eretz Yisrael, <b>the Sages issued a decree</b> as a preventative measure, prohibiting the renting of fields just as in Eretz Yisrael. But <b>concerning houses, which do not have two</b> problems, <b>the Sages did not issue</b> such <b>a decree.</b>

### Part 8
The mishna teaches that according to Rabbi Meir, <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael one may sell houses and rent fields, but one may not sell fields to gentiles. The Gemara explains: <b>Concerning a field, which has two</b> problems when it is in Eretz Yisrael, <b>the Sages issued a decree</b> preventing its sale even outside of Eretz Yisrael. <b>Concerning houses, which do not have two</b> problems, <b>the Sages did not issue a decree</b> prohibiting their sale.

### Part 9
The mishna further teaches that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: In Eretz Yisrael one may rent houses</b> but not fields <b>to</b> gentiles. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that one may rent houses but not fields? <b>Concerning fields, which have two</b> problems, <b>the Sages issued a decree</b> as a preventive measure prohibiting the renting of fields in Eretz Yisrael. But <b>concerning houses, which do not have two</b> problems, <b>the Sages did not issue a decree</b> prohibiting renting houses to gentiles.

### Part 10
The mishna teaches that Rabbi Yosei rules: <b>And in Syria one may sell</b> houses and rent fields to gentiles, but one may not sell fields. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that one may sell houses but not fields? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yosei <b>holds</b> that the <b>conquest of an individual is not called a conquest,</b> and therefore there is no prohibition by Torah law against selling houses in Syria. <b>And concerning a field, which has two</b> problems, <b>the Sages issued a decree</b> as a preventive measure prohibiting the sale of fields in Syria. <b>Concerning houses, which do not have two</b> problems, <b>the Sages did not issue a decree</b> prohibiting their sale.

### Part 11
The mishna continues: <b>And outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>one may sell</b> houses and fields. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> this land <b>is at a distance</b> from Eretz Yisrael, the Sages <b>do not issue a decree,</b> unlike Syria, which is near Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 12
In conclusion, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> that it is permitted to sell houses outside of Eretz Yisrael to gentiles. <b>Rav Yosef says: And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>provided that one does not make it</b> into a gentile <b>settlement. And how many</b> people constitute <b>a settlement?</b> The Sage <b>taught:</b> There is <b>no settlement</b> that consists of <b>fewer than three people.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara challenges: <b>But let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps this Jew will go and sell to one gentile, and the other</b> owners of the adjacent houses <b>will go and sell to two</b> other gentiles, resulting in a gentile settlement. <b>Abaye said: We are commanded about</b> placing a stumbling block <b>before</b> the blind (see Leviticus 19:14), but <b>we are not commanded about</b> placing a stumbling block <b>before</b> someone who may place it <b>before</b> the blind. In other words, this prohibition applies only when one causes another to sin by his direct action, not in a situation such as this, where the prohibition is two stages removed from the Jew’s action.

### Part 14
§ The mishna teaches that <b>even in a place</b> with regard to <b>which</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that it is permitted for a Jew <b>to rent</b> a house to a gentile, they did not say that one may rent it for use as a residence. The Gemara points out: <b>By inference,</b> this means <b>that there is a place where one may not rent</b> any house to a gentile.
