### Part 1
<b>to</b> a gentile named <b>Avidarna on their festival day.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said: I know of him that he does not worship idols,</b> so he is not considered a gentile with regard to the prohibition against giving a gift to a gentile on their festival. <b>Rav Yosef said to him: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Who is a <i>ger toshav</i>?</b> It is <b>anyone who has accepted upon himself before three <i>ḥaverim</i> to not worship idols.</b> Avidarna had not accepted this upon himself before three Jews. Rav Yehuda replied to him: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is with regard to the mitzva <b>to sustain him.</b>

### Part 2
Rav Yosef further objected: <b>But doesn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A <i>ger toshav</i></b> for <b>whom twelve months passed without</b> him <b>circumcising</b> himself <b>is considered as a heretic of the gentiles,</b> and certainly this Avidarna is not circumcised. Rav Yehuda replied: <b>There,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring to a case <b>where</b> the gentile who desired to become a <i>ger toshav</i> <b>took it upon himself to become circumcised, but</b> he recanted and <b>did not circumcise</b> himself, and in such a case it is assumed that he did not circumcise himself due to apostasy. Generally, in the case of a <i>ger toshav</i> who did not take this upon himself, this is not required of him.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates: <b>Rava brought a gift to</b> a minister named <b>bar Sheshakh on their festival day.</b> Rava <b>said: I know of him that he does not worship idols.</b> Rava <b>went</b> to him and <b>found him sitting up to his neck in rose</b> water, <b>and naked prostitutes were standing before him.</b> Bar Sheshakh <b>said to him: Do you have</b> anything as fine <b>as this in the World-to-Come?</b> Rava <b>said to him: Ours is better than this.</b> Bar Sheshakh <b>said to him: Is there</b> anything <b>finer than this?</b> Rava <b>said to him: You have the fear of the government upon you; we will not have the fear of the government upon us</b> in the World-to-Come. Bar Sheshakh <b>said to him:</b> As for <b>me, in any event, what fear of the government is there upon me?</b> I am a powerful man.

### Part 4
<b>While they were sitting, a certain royal officer [<i>peristaka</i>] came</b> and <b>said to</b> bar Sheshakh: <b>Rise, as the king requires you</b> to appear before him. <b>As he was going out, he said to</b> Rava: May any <b>eye that wishes to see evil upon you burst,</b> as it is clear that you were correct. <b>Rava said to him: Amen.</b> And then <b>bar Sheshakh’s eye burst.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Pappi said:</b> Rava <b>should have said</b> a response <b>to him from this verse: “Kings’ daughters are among your favorites; at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir”</b> (Psalms 45:10), indicating that in the World-to-Come, the daughters of kings will serve the Jewish people. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: He should have said</b> a response <b>to him from here:</b> The reward of the Jewish people will be such that <b>“no eye has seen it, God, aside from You, Who will do for those who await Him”</b> (Isaiah 64:3).

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches: If the gentile <b>hired him to do other work with him,</b> even if he said to him while he was working with him: Transport the barrel of wine used for a libation for me from this place to that place, his wage is permitted, i.e., it is permitted for the Jew to derive benefit from the money. The Gemara notes that this formulation of the mishna indicates that this wage is permitted <b>even if</b> the gentile <b>did not say to him</b> to transport the barrel of wine <b>toward evening,</b> i.e., toward the end of his workday.

### Part 7
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who hires a laborer, and toward evening</b> the employer <b>said to him: Transport</b> this <b>barrel of wine</b> used for <b>a libation from</b> this <b>place to</b> that <b>place, his wage</b> is <b>permitted.</b> By inference, <b>the reason</b> for this ruling is <b>that</b> the employer <b>said</b> it <b>to him toward evening,</b> and therefore <b>yes,</b> it is permitted, as it is clear that he has completed the labor for which he is being paid and the wage is not for moving the barrel. But if this happened during <b>the entire day,</b> not toward evening, this would <b>not</b> be permitted.

### Part 8
<b>Abaye said: When we learned</b> this in <b>the mishna as well, we learned</b> this with regard to the case <b>where</b> the employer <b>said</b> this <b>toward evening. Rava said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> case, where the wage is forbidden if it was not toward evening, is a case <b>where</b> the employer <b>said to him: Transport one hundred barrels for me for one hundred <i>perutot</i>,</b> in which case moving all of the barrels is considered a single task, and if one of the barrels was wine used for a libation, the entire wage is forbidden. <b>That</b> case, in which the wage is permitted in any event, is a case <b>where</b> the employer <b>said to him: Transport each barrel for me for one <i>peruta</i>,</b> such that each barrel is its own task.

### Part 9
<b>And</b> so <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who hires a laborer and said to him: Transport one hundred barrels for me for one hundred <i>perutot</i>, and a barrel of wine</b> used for <b>a libation was found among them, his wage</b> is <b>forbidden.</b> But if the employer said to him: Transport <b>each barrel for one <i>peruta</i>, and there was a barrel of wine</b> used for <b>a libation among them, his wage</b> is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to a gentile <b>who rents</b> a Jew’s <b>donkey to carry wine</b> used for <b>a libation on it, its</b> rental <b>fee</b> is <b>forbidden.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>this additional</b> clause? <b>This is</b> the same as <b>the first clause,</b> as the principle is the same; only the example is different. The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary to</b> teach <b>the latter clause</b> in order to teach that if the gentile <b>rented</b> the donkey <b>to sit upon it, even if the gentile placed his jug</b> of wine used for a libation <b>on it, its</b> rental <b>fee</b> is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that it is not the legal right</b> of the renter <b>to place a jug</b> upon the donkey, and therefore placing the jug on the donkey was not included in the rental?

### Part 12
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who rents a donkey</b> to ride on, the <b>renter may place on it his garment, his water jug, and his food for that journey. Beyond those</b> items, the <b>donkey driver,</b> who would take the renter on the journey, <b>may prevent him</b> from placing anything on the animal by saying that he does not wish to further burden the donkey. The <b>donkey driver may place on it barley and hay</b> for the donkey <b>and his food for that</b> first <b>day</b> alone. <b>Beyond those</b> items, the <b>renter may prevent him</b> from placing anything on the animal, on the grounds that it will inhibit its progress.

### Part 13
<b>Abaye said: Granted that it is the legal right</b> of the renter <b>to place a jug</b> upon the donkey, but <b>in any event, if he does not place it</b> on the donkey, <b>can we say to</b> the driver: <b>Deduct the fee of his jug</b> from the rental? Since the donkey driver will not deduct any amount from the rental fee if he does not place the jug on the donkey, therefore, even if he does place it, the rental fee is not forbidden.

### Part 14
With regard to the main point of the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> locations in which one is able <b>to purchase</b> provisions on the way <b>are common,</b> the <b>donkey driver can also prevent</b> the renter from putting provisions on the donkey for the entire journey, <b>and if</b> locations in which one is able <b>to purchase</b> provisions along the way <b>are uncommon,</b> the <b>renter cannot prevent</b> the driver from taking his provisions for the journey <b>either.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rav Pappa said: No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case <b>where</b> locations in which one is able <b>to go to the trouble of purchasing</b> provisions <b>are common between station and station,</b> i.e., one can find locations to purchase provisions along the way, but only with difficulty. <b>A donkey driver is accustomed to troubling himself to purchase</b> provisions along the way, so it is not permitted for him to pack provisions for the entire journey on the donkey. <b>A renter is not accustomed to troubling himself to purchase</b> provisions along the way, so he is allowed to pack all of his provisions.

### Part 16
The Gemara relates: <b>The father of Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika,</b>
