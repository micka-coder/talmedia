### Part 1
<b>neither with regard to</b> the prohibitions concerning <b>Sabbatical</b>-Year produce, <b>nor with regard to</b> restrictions on the consumption of <b>tithe, nor with regard to</b> the prohibition against consumption of <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation.</b> This is because whatever food or drink that they acquire, they acquire it of their own volition, and the employer does not bear responsibility for their actions.

### Part 2
<b>But if he said to them: Go and eat and I will reimburse</b> you, or: <b>Go and drink and I will reimburse</b> you, <b>he must be concerned with regard to</b> the possibility that his workers will transgress a prohibition with the money, whether with regard to prohibitions concerning <b>Sabbatical-</b>Year produce, <b>or with regard to</b> restrictions on the consumption of <b>tithe, or with regard to</b> the prohibition against consuming <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation.</b> This is because if they acquire forbidden food or drink, it is tantamount to his acquiring these items and giving them to the laborers.

### Part 3
Rav Sheshet infers: <b>Apparently, when he pays</b> his laborers after some time has elapsed, it is considered as though <b>he is paying money for forbidden</b> items, even though the forbidden items no longer exist. <b>Here too,</b> when people borrow Sabbatical-Year produce with the intent of paying for it afterward, <b>when one pays, he is paying for a forbidden</b> purchase.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ḥisda interpreted</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to a storekeeper who</b> regularly <b>gives credit to</b> the employer, so <b>that</b> the employer <b>incurs the debt to him</b> at the moment the storekeeper gives the food or drink to the laborers. This is <b>because, since it is his custom to give him credit,</b> it is considered as though the storekeeper <b>acquires the dinar from him</b> at that moment. Therefore, if the laborers bought from him Sabbatical-Year produce, it is considered as though the employer paid his laborers with Sabbatical-Year produce, which is prohibited. Therefore, this case is not comparable to the case of the Sages who borrowed Sabbatical-Year produce.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a storekeeper who does not give credit to</b> the employer, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is it <b>permitted</b> for the employer to send his laborers to buy food, committing to reimburse them afterward? <b>If so, rather than</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaching</b> that if the employer says: <b>Go and eat with this dinar,</b> or: <b>Go and drink with this dinar,</b> he does need to be concerned that they will buy forbidden food, <b>let him distinguish and teach</b> the distinction <b>within the</b> case <b>itself</b> where he says: Go and eat and I will reimburse you.

### Part 6
The <i>tanna</i> could teach as follows: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> i.e., that if the employer says: I will reimburse you, he cannot allow his laborer to buy forbidden food? It is stated <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>a storekeeper who</b> regularly <b>gives credit to</b> the employer, such <b>that</b> the employer <b>incurs the debt to him</b> at the moment the storekeeper gives the food or drink to the laborers. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a storekeeper who does not give credit to</b> the employer, it is <b>permitted</b> for the employer to instruct his laborers in this manner.

### Part 7
<b>And furthermore,</b> there is another difficulty with this interpretation: In the case of <b>a storekeeper who does not give credit to</b> the employer, <b>does he not incur the debt</b> to him? <b>But doesn’t Rava say</b> that in the case of <b>one who says to another: Give one hundred dinars to so-and-so and all of my property will be transferred to you, he acquires</b> it <b>by the <i>halakha</i> of a guarantor?</b> Just as a guarantor for another person’s loan renders himself liable to pay for someone else’s debt, so too, the owner of the property renders himself liable to give the property in exchange for the one hundred dinars that the acquiring party gives that so-and-so. Here too, the employer renders himself liable to pay the storekeeper when the storekeeper gives food to his laborers at his request.

### Part 8
<b>Rather, Rava says:</b> There <b>is no difference</b> whether the storekeeper <b>gives him credit, and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> whether <b>he does not give him credit.</b> Any commitment to pay causes a liability. But <b>although he incurs a debt to him, since he does not designate</b> specific coins as payment for <b>his debt</b> the employer’s conduct is <b>not prohibited.</b> Therefore, the Sages of the school of Rabbi Yannai acted in a permitted manner.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>But here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>why</b> does the employer need to <b>be concerned with regard to</b> the prohibitions concerning <b>Sabbatical-</b>Year produce? <b>He does not designate</b> specific money as payment for <b>his debt here. Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the employer <b>first</b> paid the storekeeper <b>a dinar</b> for the food he would provide to the laborers, before they actually purchased food. Therefore, the employer is considered to have acquired forbidden items and paid his laborers’ wages with them.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Kahana said: I stated</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> before Rav Zevid of Neharde’a. He said to me: If so,</b> if the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> is understood as referring to a case where the employer paid the storekeeper a dinar in advance, <b>rather than teaching</b> a case where the employer said to his laborers: <b>Go and eat, go and drink, and I will reimburse</b> you, the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> taught a case where he said: <b>Go and eat, go and drink, and I will calculate</b> the amount that should be deducted from the dinar I gave him. Rav Kahana <b>said to him:</b> That is not difficult; <b>teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> as stating: <b>Go, and I will calculate</b> the amount that should be deducted from the dinar I gave him.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the employer <b>took</b> the food and drink from the storekeeper <b>and gave</b> it to the laborers <b>with</b> his own <b>hand. Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi: If that is so, rather than teaching</b> that the employer said: <b>Go and eat, go and drink,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> taught a case where he said: <b>Take and eat, take and drink.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> as stating: <b>Take and eat, take and drink.</b>

### Part 12
§ <b>Rav Naḥman and Ulla and Avimi bar Pappi were sitting, and Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami,</b> who was studying with them, <b>was sitting among them, and they were sitting and a dilemma was raised before them:</b> If one <b>hired</b> a person <b>to break</b> barrels of <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation</b> so the wine will spill out, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since he has an interest in the preservation of</b> the barrels until he breaks them, so that he can be paid for breaking them, his wage is <b>forbidden, or perhaps</b> should it be reasoned that <b>any</b> action that one performs <b>to reduce impropriety [<i>tifela</i>] is permitted,</b> even if he is paid for the actual breaking?

### Part 13
<b>Rav Naḥman said: He may break</b> them, <b>and let a blessing come upon him.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that a <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> his opinion: <b>One may not hoe together with a gentile in</b> a field that contains a forbidden mixture of <b>diverse kinds,</b>
