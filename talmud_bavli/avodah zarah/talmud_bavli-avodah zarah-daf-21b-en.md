### Part 1
<b>And</b> this <b>unattributed</b> opinion in the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. As, if</b> you say that this ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> that cannot be, since he holds that <b>in every place one may rent</b> a house to a gentile, including Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And in every place, one may not rent</b> a bathhouse to a gentile, as it is called by the name of the owner. The Gemara notes that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A person may not rent his bathhouse to a gentile, because it is called by the name of</b> the owner, <b>and this gentile uses it for performing</b> prohibited <b>labor on <i>Shabbatot</i> and on Festivals.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: It is prohibited to rent one’s bathhouse to a gentile, <b>but</b> with regard <b>to a Samaritan, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? It can be inferred from the lack of mention of a Samaritan that it is <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: Why not <b>say</b> that <b>a Samaritan</b> will <b>perform work in</b> the bathhouse <b>during the intermediate days of a Festival?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>During the intermediate days of a Festival we too perform work</b> and heat bathhouses.

### Part 4
The Gemara further infers: It is prohibited to rent one’s bathhouse to a gentile; <b>but</b> with regard to renting <b>one’s field to a gentile, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Evidently, it is <b>permitted. What is the reason</b> for this? People know that a gentile <b>sharecropper works for his tenancy,</b> not for the Jewish owner. The Gemara asks: But if so, in the case of <b>a bathhouse as well,</b> why not <b>say</b> that the gentile <b>sharecropper works for his tenancy,</b> and therefore a Jew should be permitted to rent them to gentiles. The Gemara answers: <b>People do not</b> usually <b>make</b> this type of arrangement whereby a second party works as <b>a sharecropper of a bathhouse.</b> Consequently, it will be assumed that the gentile is a hired worker who is working for the Jew.

### Part 5
The Gemara cites a similar discussion. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: A person may not rent his field to a Samaritan, since it is called by the name of</b> the owner <b>and this Samaritan</b> will <b>perform work in it during the intermediate days of a Festival.</b> The Gemara infers: It is prohibited to rent one’s field to a Samaritan, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>a gentile, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Evidently, it is <b>permitted, as we say</b> that the gentile <b>sharecropper works for his tenancy</b> and not for the Jewish owner. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> in the case of <b>a Samaritan as well,</b> why not <b>say</b> that the <b>sharecropper works for his tenancy?</b>
