### Part 1
<b>internal injury, one may not be treated by them.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the two versions of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement? <b>There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to the case of one who was injured on <b>the back of the hand or the back of the foot. As Rav Adda bar Mattana says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> Injuries to <b>the back of the hand and the back,</b> i.e., the top, <b>of the foot are like an internal injury, and one may desecrate Shabbat for</b> their treatment.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Zutra bar Toviyya says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>any injury that requires</b> a medical <b>evaluation</b> to determine whether or not it is fatal, <b>one may desecrate Shabbat for</b> its treatment. <b>Rav Shemen bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And a burning fever is similar to an internal injury, and</b> therefore <b>one may desecrate Shabbat for</b> its treatment.

### Part 3
The Gemara inquires: <b>From what point</b> on the body is a wound considered <b>an internal injury? Rabbi Ami explained: From the lips inward. Rabbi Eliezer raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to afflictions located in the <b>gums [<i>kakhei</i>] or teeth, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Do we say that <b>since they are</b> located in <b>firm</b> parts of the body, <b>they are similar to external injuries, or perhaps</b> we say that <b>since they are situated within</b> the mouth, <b>they are similar to internal injuries?</b>

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 111a): <b>One who is concerned</b> about pain <b>in his teeth may not sip vinegar through them</b> on Shabbat for medicinal purposes, as it is generally prohibited by rabbinic law to perform acts of healing on Shabbat. Abaye infers: <b>It is</b> only when he is merely <b>concerned</b> about pain in his teeth <b>that he may not</b> treat them, which indicates that if <b>it hurts him greatly,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to seek treatment. The Gemara rejects this inference: <b>Perhaps</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> also characterizes</b> a situation <b>where it hurts one greatly</b> as one of mere <b>concern.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests a different proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following incident: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan suffered</b> from the illness <b><i>tzafdina</i>,</b> which affects the teeth and gums. <b>He went to a certain</b> gentile <b>matron</b> who was a well-known healer. <b>She prepared</b> a medicine for him on <b>Thursday and Friday.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to her: What</b> shall I do <b>tomorrow,</b> on Shabbat, when I cannot come to collect the medicine from you? <b>She said to him: You will not need</b> it. Rabbi Yoḥanan asked her: <b>If I do need</b> it, <b>what</b> shall I do? <b>She said to him: Take an oath to me that you will not reveal</b> the remedy, and I will tell you, so that you can prepare it yourself should you need it. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>took an oath to her: To the God of the Jews, I will not reveal it. She revealed</b> the remedy <b>to him. On the following day</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>went out and taught it publicly,</b> revealing the secret of the remedy.

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>took an oath to her</b> that he would not reveal her secret. The Gemara explains that his vow meant: <b>I will not reveal it to the God of the Jews,</b> which indicates: <b>But I will reveal it to His people, the Jews.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> even so, <b>isn’t there a desecration of God’s name,</b> as the matron now thinks that a great man of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s stature violated his vow? The Gemara answers <b>that he revealed</b> it <b>to her at the outset.</b> As soon as she disclosed the remedy to him, he informed her that his vow would not prevent him from publicizing it.

### Part 7
With regard to the issue at hand, the Gemara infers: <b>Apparently,</b> an affliction that affects the gums <b>is similar to an internal injury,</b> as it was permitted for Rabbi Yoḥanan to prepare the remedy on Shabbat. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: <i>Tzafdina</i> is different, since it begins in the mouth, and ends in the intestines,</b> i.e., the disease spreads until it infects one’s intestines, and therefore it is considered an internal affliction even while it is only in the mouth. Consequently, the incident involving Rabbi Yoḥanan affords no proof, and Rabbi Eliezer’s dilemma remains unresolved.

### Part 8
The Gemara inquires: <b>What are the symptoms of</b> <i>tzafdina</i>? If <b>one places an item between</b> his <b>teeth, blood flows from the rows</b> of teeth. <b>From what does it</b> result? It results <b>from</b> the consumption of <b>very cold wheat</b> foods, <b>and from very hot barley</b> foods, <b>and from remains of fried fish [<i>kasa deharsena</i>].</b> With <b>what</b> remedy <b>did</b> the gentile matron <b>treat</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan? <b>Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rava, said:</b> It was <b>water</b> in which <b>leaven</b> was steeped, <b>olive oil, and salt. And Mar bar Rav Ashi said:</b> She smeared <b>goose fat</b> over his gums <b>with a goose feather.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Abaye said: I prepared all of these</b> medicines <b>and was not cured</b> from this ailment <b>until a certain Arab told me</b> the remedy for it: <b>Take olive seeds that are less than one-third ripe, and burn them</b> in a fire <b>on top of a new hoe, and stick them along the row</b> of gums. <b>I did this and was cured.</b>

### Part 10
§ It was stated above that Rabbi Yoḥanan sought the medical attention of a gentile. The Gemara asks: <b>And how could Rabbi Yoḥanan do so? But doesn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>any injury for which Shabbat is desecrated, one may not be treated by</b> gentiles. <i>Tzafdina</i> is a disease for which Shabbat is desecrated, and yet Rabbi Yoḥanan was treated by a gentile. The Gemara answers: <b>An important person</b> such as Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>is different,</b> as gentiles would not dare to kill him.

### Part 11
The Gemara questions this: <b>But Rabbi Abbahu was an important person, and</b> yet <b>Ya’akov the heretic placed upon his leg a salve</b> that was actually a poison. <b>And if</b> it were <b>not</b> for <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, who licked his leg</b> to remove the poison, <b>his leg</b> would have had to be <b>amputated.</b> Apparently, Ya’akov the heretic attempted to kill Rabbi Abbahu despite the fact that Rabbi Abbahu was an important person.

### Part 12
The Gemara explains: The healer <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan was an expert physician</b> who would not jeopardize her reputation by harming him. The Gemara rejects this explanation: But the healer <b>of Rabbi Abbahu was also an expert physician.</b> The Gemara answers: The case involving <b>Rabbi Abbahu is different, as heretics establish within themselves</b> the attitude of: <b>“Let me die with the Philistines”</b> (Judges 16:30), i.e., heretics are willing to risk their lives in order to hurt Jews, due to their religious disputes. By contrast, gentiles will not jeopardize their own reputation for this purpose, and therefore it was permitted for Rabbi Yoḥanan to be treated by the matron.

### Part 13
§ The Gemara lists a series of afflictions and their remedies. <b>Shmuel said: This gash</b> caused by a sword <b>is</b> considered <b>a danger</b> to one’s life, <b>and one may desecrate Shabbat for</b> its treatment. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>the remedy</b> for this wound? To <b>stop the blood</b> flow one should consume <b>cress</b> soaked <b>in vinegar.</b> To cause flesh <b>to emerge</b> over the gash, one applies a salve made of <b><i>yavla</i> scrapings and thornbush scrapings, or</b> a salve made from <b>the worms of the trash.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rav Safra said: These grapelike</b> boils <b>are the forerunners [<i>parvanka</i>] of the Angel of Death,</b> i.e., they often precede one’s death. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the remedy?</b> The remedy is either <b>a <i>tigna</i></b> plant soaked <b>in honey or parsley</b> soaked <b>in wine. In the meantime,</b> while the plants are soaking, one <b>should bring a grape of the same size and rub it on</b> the boil, <b>a white</b> grape <b>for a white</b> boil, <b>and a black</b> grape <b>for a black</b> boil.

### Part 15
<b>Rava said: This abscess [<i>simta</i>] is the forerunner of fever.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>the remedy?</b> One <b>should snap [<i>itkutlei</i>]</b> the boil <b>sixty times</b> with his fingers, i.e., click one’s fingers on the boil, <b>and</b> then he <b>should tear it vertically and horizontally.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And this statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where the head of</b> the abscess <b>has not whitened, but</b> if <b>its head has whitened, we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> i.e., it is in the process of healing, and it does not pose any danger.
