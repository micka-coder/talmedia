<b>he will cleave to it</b> and <b>go</b> to worship idolatry <b>once again.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that with regard to <b>a Jew who goes to a festival of idolatry, whether</b> he is <b>on the way</b> there <b>or returning</b> from it, it is <b>prohibited</b> to engage in business with him? The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Ashi said: When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is <b>in</b> reference to <b>an apostate Jew, who</b> will <b>certainly go</b> to the festival, and will certainly not change his mind.

### Part 3
<b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile who goes to a fair,</b> where goods and idols are bought and sold, <b>whether</b> he is <b>on the way</b> there <b>or returning</b> from it, it is <b>permitted</b> to engage in business with him. With regard to <b>a Jew who goes to a fair,</b> when he is <b>on the way</b> there, it is <b>permitted</b> to engage in business with him, but if he is <b>returning</b> from it, it is <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>a Jew that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to engage in business with him when he is <b>returning?</b> The Gemara answers that this is in accordance with that <b>which</b> the Sages <b>say: He sold</b> objects of <b>idol worship,</b> and therefore <b>money</b> gained from <b>idol worship is in his possession.</b> Since the money in his possession is assumed to have been gained through objects of idolatry, it is prohibited to engage in business with the Jew. The Gemara challenges: But with regard to <b>a gentile, also, let us say: He sold</b> objects of <b>idol worship,</b> and therefore <b>money</b> gained from <b>idol worship is in his possession.</b> Why is it prohibited to do business only with the Jew?

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather,</b> with regard to <b>a gentile, we say: He sold clothing</b> or <b>he sold wine,</b> but not idols. The Gemara questions this: Then with regard to <b>a Jew, also, let us say:</b> One should <b>say</b> that <b>he sold clothing</b> or <b>he sold wine,</b> but not idols. The Gemara explains: <b>If he had</b> only wine or clothing to sell, <b>he would have sold</b> them <b>here</b> instead of going to the fair. The fact that he exerted himself to travel to a fair of gentiles indicates that he intended to sell idols.

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>those who are coming</b> from a festival of idolatry, it is <b>permitted</b> to engage with them in business. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <b>only</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> those returning <b>are not attached to one another,</b> i.e., they are not traveling in groups. <b>But</b> where <b>they are attached to one another</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to engage in business with them, as <b>I say:</b> The gentile <b>intends to return</b> to the festival with his companions.

### Part 7
§ The mishna further teaches: <b>Wineskins and jugs</b> that belong <b>to gentiles</b> and that have a Jew’s wine contained in them are prohibited. <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>wineskins of gentiles,</b> if they are <b>stripped</b> and free from tar, and <b>new, they are permitted,</b> but <b>old and tarred</b> containers <b>are prohibited.</b> Nevertheless, if <b>a gentile pitched them [<i>ribbevan</i>] and lined them and added wine to them</b> to negate the flavor of the tar while <b>a Jew stands over him,</b> one need <b>not</b> be <b>concerned</b> for a prohibition.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But once</b> we have established <b>that a gentile places wine in</b> the containers, <b>what of</b> the fact that <b>a Jew stands over him?</b> Why does this affect the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains: <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If <b>a gentile pitched</b> the containers <b>and lined them, and a Jew</b> then <b>placed wine in them while another Jew stood over him,</b> one need <b>not</b> be <b>concerned</b> that it is prohibited.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>But since a Jew</b> is the one who <b>places wine in them, why do I</b> need <b>another Jew</b> to <b>stand over him?</b> The Gemara answers: It is necessary as <b>perhaps due to</b> the Jew’s <b>preoccupation</b> with pouring the wine, the gentile will manage to <b>libate</b> the wine, <b>and</b> the Jew will be <b>unaware</b> of it.

### Part 10
The Gemara presents an alternative interpretation. <b>Rav Zevid said: Actually,</b> it should be <b>as you initially said,</b> that the gentile himself pours the wine. <b>And here, when he pours</b> the wine into the container, <b>he is considered as one who splashes water in clay</b> and does not intend to use it as a libation. <b>Rav Pappi said: Conclude from</b> the statement <b>of Rav Zevid</b> that with regard to <b>this</b> incident involving <b>a gentile who casts wine into the salt receptacle of a Jew,</b> the salt is <b>permitted,</b> as the gentile has no intention of using the wine as a libation.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ashi objects to this: Are</b> the two cases <b>comparable? There,</b> with regard to the pitched container, the flavor of the wine <b>is going to</b> be <b>lost,</b> due to the tar. But <b>here,</b> in the case of the salt receptacle, the flavor of the wine <b>is not going to</b> be <b>lost.</b> Therefore there is no reason to rule that the salt is permitted.

### Part 12
The Gemara relates a relevant incident. <b>Bar Adi the Arab seized certain wineskins from Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef, placed wine in them</b> for an extended period of time, <b>and</b> then <b>returned them to him.</b> Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef <b>came</b> and <b>asked</b> in <b>the study hall</b> what course of action he should take. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to him: This</b> is what <b>Rabbi Ami instructed</b> me to do in terms of <b>practical <i>halakha</i>:</b> One <b>fills</b> the skins with <b>water</b> for <b>three days,</b> so that the water will absorb the flavor of the wine, <b>and</b> then <b>pours</b> the water <b>out. And Rava says:</b> In addition, one <b>must pour out</b> the water in <b>them</b> every <b>twenty-four-hour period</b> and then refill them. Once this has been performed, the wineskins will be permitted.

### Part 13
It was <b>understood from</b> the above incident that <b>this matter,</b> i.e., that one may fill the wineskins with water for three days to render them permitted, applies only to <b>our</b> wineskins that were taken by gentiles. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>their</b> own wineskins, it does <b>not</b> apply, as they are permanently prohibited. <b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: Both ours and theirs</b> can be rendered permitted in this manner. Similarly, <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, thought to say before Rav Ashi: This matter</b> applies only to <b>wineskins, but not</b> to <b>jugs. Rav Ashi said to him:</b> There is <b>no difference</b> between <b>wineskins and jugs,</b> as both can be rendered permitted in this manner.

### Part 14
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the halakhic status of various wineskins. <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>wineskins of gentiles,</b> if they are <b>new</b> and <b>stripped</b> free from tar, <b>they are permitted,</b> but <b>old and tarred</b> containers <b>are prohibited.</b> If <b>a gentile places wine in them,</b> the <b>Jew</b> should <b>put water in them.</b> Additionally, if <b>a gentile places wine in them,</b> the <b>Jew may put brine and fish stew in them</b> immediately, <b>and</b> he need <b>not</b> be <b>concerned.</b>

### Part 15
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages:
