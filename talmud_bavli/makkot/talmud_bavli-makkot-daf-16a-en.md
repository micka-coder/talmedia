### Part 1
<b>because it is a prohibition that does not involve an action.</b> He violates the oath by failing to perform an action, rather than by performing an action, <b>and</b> the principle is: With regard to <b>any prohibition that does not involve an action, one is not flogged for its</b> violation. <b>Reish Lakish says: He is not flogged, because</b> the forewarning in this case <b>is an uncertain forewarning.</b> One cannot properly forewarn him before he takes the oath, because as long as time remains in the day he can still eat the loaf at a later time and fulfill the oath; <b>and any uncertain forewarning is not characterized as forewarning.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara adds: <b>And both</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“And you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning, and that which remains of it until the morning</b> you shall burn in fire” (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to position</b> the <b>positive mitzva</b> of burning the leftover flesh <b>after</b> the <b>prohibition</b> against leaving over the flesh, <b>to say that one is not flogged for its</b> violation; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yoḥanan inferred this</b> from the statement of Rabbi Yehuda: <b>The reason</b> he is not flogged is <b>that the verse comes</b> and positions the mitzva after the prohibition; <b>but</b> if <b>the verse</b> had <b>not come</b> and positioned the mitzva after the prohibition, he would have been <b>flogged. Apparently, uncertain forewarning is characterized as forewarning,</b> as he can be forewarned not to leave over the flesh of the offering, even though he would not be flogged were he to burn it.

### Part 3
<b>And Reish Lakish inferred this: The reason</b> he is not flogged is <b>that the verse comes</b> and positions the mitzva after the prohibition; <b>but</b> if <b>the verse</b> had <b>not come</b> and positioned the mitzva after the prohibition, he would have been <b>flogged. Apparently, one is flogged</b> even <b>for</b> violating <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action,</b> as he violates the prohibition without performing an action.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish too, this is certainly</b> a case of <b>uncertain forewarning;</b> why, then, does he not conclude based on Rabbi Yehuda’s statement that uncertain forewarning is characterized as forewarning?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the other <i>tanna</i></b> in the name <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman was divorced and remarried soon after, and a son was born seven months after her remarriage and nine months after her divorce, it is unclear whether he is the son of the first husband or of the second husband. In that case, if this son <b>struck this</b> husband of his mother, <b>and then struck that</b> husband, or if he <b>cursed this</b> husband <b>and then cursed that one,</b> and likewise if <b>he struck both of them simultaneously or cursed both of them simultaneously,</b> he is <b>liable</b> for striking or cursing his father. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he cursed or struck both of them <b>simultaneously</b> he is <b>liable,</b> but if he cursed or struck them <b>one after the other,</b> even if he was forewarned prior to cursing or striking each one, he is <b>exempt.</b> Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda is of the opinion that one is not flogged after uncertain forewarning; since in this case it is impossible to determine which of them is the father, inevitably the forewarning is uncertain.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan too, this is certainly</b> a case of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action.</b> Why, then, does he not conclude based on Rabbi Yehuda’s statement that one is flogged for violating a prohibition of that kind?

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>holds in accordance with that which</b> was cited in his name, as <b>Rav Idi bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rav Amram says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili:</b> With regard to <b>any prohibition in the Torah,</b> if it is <b>a prohibition that involves an action, one is flogged for its</b> violation; if it is <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action, one is not flogged for its</b> violation, <b>except for one who takes</b> a false <b>oath, one who substitutes</b> a non-sacred animal for a sacrificial animal, saying: This animal is substituted for that one, <b>and one who curses another invoking the name</b> of God. In those three instances, the perpetrator is flogged even though he performed no action.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: Although the difficulties that were raised with regard to the opinions of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish were answered, the apparent contradiction from one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda to</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> is <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara cited contradictory statements of Rabbi Yehuda with regard to lashes both in the case of a prohibition that does not involve an action and in the case of uncertain forewarning.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it is according <b>to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> the contradiction may be resolved with the explanation that the two sources reflect the opinions of <b>two <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> who disagree <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda. If</b> it is according <b>to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> the contradiction is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> reflects <b>his</b> opinion, that one is flogged for violating a prohibition that involves an action, and <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> reflects the opinion <b>of his teacher,</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who holds that one is not flogged for violating a prohibition that involves an action.

### Part 10
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (17a): With regard to <b>one who takes</b> the <b>mother</b> bird <b>with</b> her <b>fledglings,</b> thereby violating the Torah prohibition: “You shall not take the mother with her fledglings; you shall send the mother, and the fledglings you may take for yourself” (Deuteronomy 22:6–7), <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He is <b>flogged</b> for taking the mother bird, <b>and</b> he <b>does not send</b> the mother, <b>and the Rabbis say: He sends</b> the mother <b>and is not flogged,</b> as <b>this is the principle:</b> With regard to <b>any prohibition that entails</b> a command to <b>arise</b> and <b>perform</b> a mitzva, <b>one is not liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for its</b> violation. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: We have only this</b> mitzva <b>and another</b> where one would be flogged if not for the relevant mitzva.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Elazar said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Which</b> is that other mitzva? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> You will know <b>when you discover it</b> yourself. Rabbi Elazar <b>went out, examined</b> the matter, <b>and discovered</b> the answer, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a rapist who divorced</b> the woman he raped, <b>if he is a non-priest, he remarries</b> her, <b>and he is not flogged</b> for violating the prohibition: “He may not send her away all his days” (Deuteronomy 22:29). <b>And if he is a priest,</b> he is <b>flogged</b> for violating the prohibition, <b>and he does not remarry</b> her.

### Part 12
The Gemara states: <b>This works out well according to the one who teaches</b> that the criterion for determining whether one is flogged for violating a prohibition that entails fulfillment of a positive mitzva is whether <b>he fulfilled</b> the mitzva <b>or did not fulfill</b> the mitzva, and if he does not fulfill the mitzva immediately when he is instructed to do so, he is flogged when he fails to do so.

### Part 13
<b>But according to the one who teaches</b> that the criterion for determining whether one is flogged in that case is whether <b>he nullified</b> the mitzva <b>or did not nullify</b> the mitzva, and one is flogged only if he performed an action that renders it impossible to fulfill the mitzva, <b>granted, with regard to</b> the <b>sending</b> away of the mother bird from <b>the nest, you</b> can <b>find</b> a situation where he nullifies the mitzva, e.g., if he killed the mother bird. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a rapist,</b> if the criterion is whether <b>he nullified</b> the mitzva <b>or he did not nullify it, how can you find</b> a situation where the man is flogged because he nullified any possibility of remarrying her?

### Part 14
<b>If</b> he cannot remarry her because <b>he killed her,</b> he will be executed, not flogged, based on the principle: <b>He receives the greater</b> punishment. <b>Rav Shimi of Meḥoza said:</b> He nullifies the possibility of remarriage in a case <b>where he received, on her</b> behalf, the money for <b>betrothal from another,</b> thereby ensuring that his own remarriage to her is no longer an option. <b>Rav said:</b> That is not a viable solution; <b>if</b> his ex-wife <b>designated him as an agent</b> to receive the money of betrothal on her behalf, it is <b>she who nullifies</b> the possibility of fulfilling the mitzva <b>for him,</b> as a woman is betrothed only with her consent, and he is not liable at all. <b>If she did not designate him as an agent, is it in his</b> power to accept betrothal on behalf of a woman who did not designate him to do so? His action <b>is nothing,</b> and the betrothal does not take effect.

### Part 15
<b>Rather, Rav Shimi of Neharde’a said:</b> He nullifies the possibility of remarriage in a case <b>where he vowed in public</b> that it is prohibited for him to derive benefit from <b>her,</b> and it is consequently prohibited for him to marry her. The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>a vow that was taken in public has no nullification;</b> he is flogged, since by taking that vow he has rendered remarriage impossible. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that even a vow taken in public <b>has</b> the possibility of <b>nullification, what can be said?</b> He can nullify the vow and remarry her. The Gemara answers: The reference is to a case <b>where he vows on</b> the basis of <b>the consent of the public</b> that it is prohibited for him to derive benefit from <b>her, as Ameimar says</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is: <b>A vow that was taken in public has</b> the possibility of <b>nullification;</b> a vow that was taken <b>on</b> the basis of <b>the consent of the public has no nullification.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara questions Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: <b>And</b> are there <b>no more</b> prohibitions that entail fulfillment of a positive mitzva for which one is flogged? <b>But aren’t there others?</b> Before stating its challenges, the Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the cases that it will cite: <b>Robbery, collateral, and <i>pe’a</i>.</b> The Gemara elaborates: Isn’t there the case of <b>robbery, where the Merciful One states: “You shall not rob”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), and also states: <b>“And he shall return the stolen item”</b> (Leviticus 5:23)? Isn’t there the case of <b>collateral, where the Merciful One states: “You shall not come into his house to fetch his pledge”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:10), and He then states: <b>“You shall return to him the pledge when the sun sets”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13)?

### Part 17
The Gemara continues: <b>And you find</b> that one is liable to receive lashes <b>in</b> those cases both if the criterion is whether <b>he fulfilled</b> the mitzva <b>or did not fulfill</b> the mitzva, <b>and</b> if the criterion is whether <b>he nullified</b> the mitzva <b>or he did not nullify it.</b> According to the first criterion, he is flogged if he fails to return the stolen item or the collateral; according to the second criterion, he is flogged if he destroys the stolen item or the collateral. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in both those cases, he is not flogged, <b>since he is liable to</b> remit monetary <b>payment</b> for the stolen item or the collateral, as the principle is: <b>One is not</b> both <b>flogged and</b> liable to <b>pay</b> restitution for one transgression.

### Part 18
<b>Rabbi Zeira objects to this: But isn’t there</b> a case where he is not liable to pay, e.g., if he appropriated <b>the collateral of a convert and the convert died</b> with no heirs. In that case, there is no payment, and nevertheless, he is not flogged.
