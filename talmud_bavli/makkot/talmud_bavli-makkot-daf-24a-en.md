### Part 1
<b>is 611,</b> the number of mitzvot that were received and taught by Moses our teacher. In addition, there are two mitzvot: <b>“I am</b> the Lord your God” and: <b>“You shall have</b> no other gods” (Exodus 20:2, 3), the first two of the Ten Commandments, that <b>we heard from the mouth of the Almighty,</b> for a total of 613.

### Part 2
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the biblical figures cited in the course of the discussion that follows: <b><i>Dalet</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>kuf</i>; <i>samekh</i>, <i>kuf</i>;</b> representing David, Micah, Isaiah, Amos, Habakkuk, Amos, and Ezekiel.

### Part 3
Rabbi Simlai continued: King <b>David came and established</b> the 613 mitzvot <b>upon eleven</b> mitzvot, <b>as it is written: “A Psalm of David. Lord, who shall sojourn in Your Tabernacle? Who shall dwell upon Your sacred mountain? He who walks wholeheartedly, and works righteousness, and speaks truth in his heart. Who has no slander upon his tongue, nor does evil to his neighbor, nor takes up reproach against his relative. In whose eyes a vile person is despised, and he honors those who fear the Lord; he takes an oath to his own detriment, and changes not. He neither gives his money with interest, nor takes a bribe against the innocent. He who performs these shall never be moved”</b> (Psalms, chapter 15). Eleven attributes that facilitate one’s entry into the World-to-Come appear on this list.

### Part 4
The Gemara analyzes these verses: <b>“He who walks wholeheartedly”; this</b> is referring to one who conducts himself like our forefather <b>Abraham, as it is written</b> concerning him: <b>“Walk before Me and be wholehearted”</b> (Genesis 17:1).

### Part 5
<b>“Works righteousness”;</b> this is referring to one <b>such as Abba Ḥilkiyyahu,</b> a laborer who would not pause from his labor even to greet people; he righteously continued working.

### Part 6
<b>“And speaks truth in his heart”;</b> this is referring to one <b>such as Rav Safra,</b> who was reciting <i>Shema</i> when a person approached him to purchase an item. He intended to accept the man’s offer, but he was unable to respond because it is prohibited to interrupt the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. The buyer misinterpreted Rav Safra’s silence and concluded that Rav Safra demanded a higher price, so he raised his offer. Rav Safra insisted on selling him the item for the sum that he was offered initially.

### Part 7
<b>“Who has no slander upon his tongue”; this</b> is referring to one who conducts himself like <b>our forefather Jacob,</b> who did not want to mislead his father in order to receive his blessings, <b>as it is written: “Perhaps my father will feel me, and I will be in his eyes like a fraud”</b> (Genesis 27:12).

### Part 8
<b>“Nor does evil to his neighbor”;</b> this is referring to one <b>who did not infringe upon another’s trade,</b> constituting illegal competition.

### Part 9
<b>“Nor takes up reproach against his relative”; this</b> is referring to <b>one who draws his relatives near,</b> and does not distance them when they embarrass him.

### Part 10
<b>“In whose eyes a vile person is despised”; this</b> is referring to one who conducts himself like <b>King Hezekiah, who dragged the bones of his</b> evil <b>father,</b> King Ahaz, <b>in a bed of ropes,</b> because he despised those considered vile by God.

### Part 11
<b>“And he honors those who fear the Lord”; this</b> is referring to one who conducts himself like <b>Jehoshaphat, king of Judea, who when he would see a Torah scholar would arise from his throne and hug him and kiss him, and call him: My father, my father, my teacher, my teacher, my master, my master.</b>

### Part 12
<b>“He takes an oath to his own detriment, and changes not”;</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the conduct of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> would <b>say</b> in the form of a vow when seeking to refrain from eating in another’s home: <b>I shall fast until I will come to my house.</b> He would fulfill that vow and refrain from eating, even though he took the vow only to avoid eating in that place.

### Part 13
<b>“He neither gives his money with interest”;</b> meaning he does not lend money <b>with interest even</b> to <b>a gentile,</b> which is permitted by Torah law.

### Part 14
<b>“Nor takes a bribe against the innocent”;</b> this is referring to one <b>such as Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> who refused to sit in judgment in a case involving his sharecropper. Since the latter would bring him a basket of fruit, he was concerned that he might unconsciously favor him.

### Part 15
At the conclusion of the verses, <b>it is written: “He who performs these shall never be moved.”</b> The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabban Gamliel would reach this verse he would cry,</b> and <b>he said:</b> It is <b>one who performed all</b> these actions <b>who shall never be moved; but</b> if he performed only <b>one of them, he shall be moved.</b>

### Part 16
The Sages <b>said to him: Is it written: He who performs all these?</b> Rather, the phrase <b>“he who performs these” is written,</b> indicating that one is blessed <b>even in</b> a case where he performed <b>one of them. As if you do not say so,</b> compare that to <b>a different verse</b> that <b>is written</b> with regard to severe transgressions punishable by <i>karet</i>: <b>“Do not impurify yourselves with all these”</b> (Leviticus 18:24). Would you say that <b>there too</b> it means that it is <b>one who comes into contact with all these who becomes impure,</b> but <b>one who comes into contact with one of these, no,</b> he does not become impure? <b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> that the phrase “with all these” means: <b>With one of all these? Here too</b> it means that one who performs <b>one of all these</b> has a place in the World-to-Come.

### Part 17
Rabbi Simlai’s exposition continues: <b>Isaiah came and established</b> the 613 mitzvot <b>upon six, as it is written: “He who walks righteously, and speaks uprightly; he who despises the gain of oppressions, who shakes his hands from holding of bribes, who stops his ears from hearing blood, and shuts his eyes from looking upon evil”</b> (Isaiah 33:15).

### Part 18
The Gemara elaborates: <b>“He who walks righteously”; this</b> is referring to one who conducts himself like <b>our forefather Abraham, as it is written</b> concerning him: <b>“For I have known him, that he will command</b> his children…to perform righteousness and justice” (Genesis 18:19).

### Part 19
<b>“And speaks uprightly”; this</b> is referring to <b>one who does not shame another in public.</b>

### Part 20
<b>“He who despises the gain of oppressions”;</b> this is referring to one <b>such as Rabbi Yishmael ben Elisha,</b> who refused to sit in judgment in a case involving one who gave him priestly gifts, to avoid the appearance of impropriety.

### Part 21
<b>“Who shakes his hands from holding of bribes”;</b> this is referring to one <b>such as Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> who, as explained above, refused to sit in judgment in a case involving his sharecropper.

### Part 22
<b>“Who stops his ears from hearing blood”;</b> this is referring to one <b>who</b> would <b>not hear derision of a Torah scholar and remain silent, such as Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who was well known for this.

### Part 23
<b>“And shuts his eyes from looking upon evil”</b> is to be understood <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: This</b> is referring to one <b>who does not look at women when they stand over the laundry</b> at the river. The women would lift the garments they were wearing to keep them out of the water, and thereby expose part of their bodies.

### Part 24
<b>And it is written</b> with regard to one who performs these matters: <b>“He shall dwell on high;</b> his fortress shall be the munitions of rocks; his bread shall be given, his waters shall be sure” (Isaiah 33:16).

### Part 25
<b>Micah came and established</b> the 613 mitzvot <b>upon three, as it is written: “It has been told to you, O man, what is good, and what the Lord does require of you; only to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God”</b> (Micah 6:8).

### Part 26
The Gemara elaborates: <b>“To do justly,” this</b> is <b>justice; “to love mercy,” this</b> is an allusion to <b>acts of loving-kindness; “and to walk humbly with your God,” this</b> is an allusion to <b>taking the</b> indigent <b>dead out</b> for burial <b>and accompanying</b> a poor <b>bride</b> to her wedding canopy, both of which are to be performed without fanfare glorifying the doer. The Gemara notes: <b>And are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>? If,</b> with regard to <b>matters that tend to be conducted in public,</b> e.g., funerals and weddings, <b>the Torah states “walk humbly”</b> when doing them, then in <b>matters that tend to be conducted in private,</b> e.g., charity and Torah study, <b>all the more so</b> should they be conducted <b>in private.</b>

### Part 27
<b>Isaiah then established</b> the 613 mitzvot <b>upon two, as it is stated: “So says the Lord: Observe justice and perform righteous-ness”</b> (Isaiah 56:1). <b>Amos came and established</b> the 613 mitzvot <b>upon one, as it is stated: “So says the Lord to the house of Israel: Seek Me and live”</b> (Amos 5:4). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak objects to this:</b> There is no proof that the verse in Amos is establishing all the mitzvot upon one; <b>say</b> that Amos is saying: <b>Seek Me throughout the entire Torah,</b> as the verse does not specify the manner in which one should seek the Lord. <b>Rather,</b> say: <b>Habakkuk came and established</b> the 613 mitzvot <b>upon one, as it is stated: “But the righteous person shall live by his faith”</b> (Habakkuk 2:4).

### Part 28
§ <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: Moses our teacher issued four decrees upon the Jewish people,</b> and <b>four prophets came and revoked them. Moses said: “And Israel dwells in safety, the fountain [<i>ein</i>] of Jacob alone”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:28), indicating that the Jewish people will dwell in safety only when they reach a lofty spiritual level similar to [<i>me’ein</i>] that of Jacob our forefather. <b>Amos came and revoked it, as it is stated:</b> “Lord God, <b>cease, I beseech You; how shall Jacob stand,</b> as he is small” (Amos 7:5), <b>and</b> immediately afterward <b>it states: “The Lord regretted this;</b> it too shall not be, says the Lord God” (Amos 7:6).

### Part 29
<b>Moses said: “And among these nations you shall have no repose”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:65). <b>Jeremiah came</b> and revoked it, <b>and said: “Even Israel, when I go to cause him to rest”</b> (Jeremiah 31:1), indicating that the Jewish people will find rest even in exile.

### Part 30
<b>Moses said: “He visits the transgression of the fathers upon the sons”</b> (Exodus 34:7). <b>Ezekiel came and revoked it: “The soul that sins, it shall die”</b> (Ezekiel 18:4), and not the children of that soul.

### Part 31
<b>Moses said: “And you shall be lost among the nations”</b> (Leviticus 26:38). <b>Isaiah came</b> and revoked it, <b>and said: “And it shall be on that day the great shofar shall be sounded,</b> and those lost in the land of Assyria shall come” (Isaiah 27:13).

### Part 32
<b>Rav says: I am afraid of that verse: “And you shall be lost among the nations.” Rav Pappa objects to this: Perhaps</b> it means that the Jewish people will be <b>like a lost item that is sought</b> by its owner, and God will restore those lost in exile, <b>as it is written: “I have gone astray like a lost lamb; seek Your servant”</b> (Psalms 119:176). <b>Rather,</b> Rav was afraid <b>from</b> that which is written in <b>the latter</b> portion <b>of that verse,</b> where it is written: <b>“And the land of your enemies shall consume you.” Mar Zutra objects to this: Perhaps</b> it means <b>like the consumption of cucumbers and gourds,</b> which are not consumed in their entirety. Some is left over, from which additional plants can grow.

### Part 33
§ Apropos tribulations of exile and hope for redemption, the Gemara relates: <b>And it once was that Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, Rabbi Yehoshua, and Rabbi Akiva were walking along the road</b> in the Roman Empire, <b>and they heard the sound of the multitudes of Rome from Puteoli at a distance of one hundred and twenty <i>mil</i>.</b> The city was so large that they were able to hear its tumult from a great distance. <b>And</b> the other Sages <b>began weeping and Rabbi Akiva</b> was <b>laughing. They said to him: For what</b> reason <b>are you laughing?</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to them: And you, for what</b> reason <b>are you weeping? They said to him: These gentiles, who bow to false gods and burn incense to idols, dwell securely and tranquilly</b> in this colossal city, <b>and</b> for <b>us, the House of the footstool of our God,</b> the Temple, <b>is burnt</b>
