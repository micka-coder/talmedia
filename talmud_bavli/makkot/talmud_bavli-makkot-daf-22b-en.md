### Part 1
<b>and</b> then <b>they assessed</b> him again and concluded <b>that he cannot receive forty</b> lashes and survive, he is <b>exempt</b> from the additional lashes. If the doctors initially <b>assessed</b> concerning <b>him</b> that he is able <b>to receive</b> only <b>eighteen</b> lashes, <b>and once he was flogged</b> eighteen times <b>they assessed that he is able to receive forty,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from receiving additional lashes.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara begins with a discussion of the number of lashes. <b>What is the reason</b> that the Rabbis said that he receives forty lashes less one? <b>If it had been written: Forty by number, I would say</b> that it means <b>forty as</b> a precise <b>sum; now that it is written: “By number, forty,”</b> the reference is to <b>a sum that approaches forty.</b> Likewise, <b>Rava said: How foolish</b> are <b>the rest of the people who stand before a Torah scroll</b> that passes before them, <b>and</b> yet <b>they do not stand before a great man,</b> when a Sage passes before them; <b>as in a Torah scroll, forty is written and the Sages came</b> and <b>subtracted one,</b> establishing the number of lashes as thirty-nine. Apparently, the authority of the Sages is so great that they are able to amend an explicit Torah verse.

### Part 3
The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He is flogged with <b>a full forty</b> lashes, with the additional lash administered between his shoulders. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “And one shall say to him: What are these wounds between your arms? Then he shall answer: Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends”</b> (Zechariah 13:6). Rabbi Yehuda understands that this verse is referring to one with wounds from lashes administered between his arms, indicating that there is one lash administered between the shoulders. <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that one is flogged only thirty-nine lashes, explain this verse? They explain that <b>this</b> verse <b>is written with regard to schoolchildren</b> struck by their teacher for laxity in their studies, and is not referring to lashes administered by the court.

### Part 4
The mishna teaches: <b>One assesses</b> the number of lashes that the one being punished is capable of withstanding <b>only with</b> a number of <b>lashes fit</b> to be divided into three equal groups. If doctors assessed concerning him that he is able to receive forty lashes and survive, and he is then flogged some of those forty lashes, and they then assessed him again and concluded that he cannot receive forty lashes and survive, he is exempt from any additional lashes. If the doctors initially assessed concerning him that he is able to receive only eighteen lashes, and once he was flogged with eighteen lashes they assessed that he is able to receive forty, he is exempt from receiving further lashes. The Gemara infers: If <b>he was flogged</b> in practice, <b>yes,</b> he is exempt; if <b>he was not flogged, no,</b> he is not exempt from the rest of the forty lashes.

### Part 5
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If doctors <b>assessed</b> concerning <b>him</b> that he is able <b>to receive forty</b> lashes and survive, <b>and they then assessed</b> him again and concluded <b>that he cannot receive forty</b> lashes and survive, he is <b>exempt.</b> If the doctors initially <b>assessed</b> concerning <b>him</b> that he is able <b>to receive</b> only <b>eighteen</b> lashes, <b>and they then assessed that he is able to receive forty,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> Apparently, even if he did not receive any lashes, if the assessment changes, it is as though he was flogged.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> case in the mishna is one <b>where</b> doctors <b>assessed his</b> fitness to receive lashes <b>for</b> that <b>day,</b> and there was no change in his condition; rather, it was discovered that the initial assessment was mistaken. He is exempt only if he was already flogged; if not, another assessment is performed. <b>That</b> case in the <i>baraita</i> is one <b>where</b> doctors <b>assess his</b> fitness to receive lashes <b>for</b> the <b>next day or for a different day.</b> In that case, the initial assessment was accurate; it is his condition that changed. Therefore, if it is determined that he is unable to receive lashes, he is exempt.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one performed a transgression that involves two prohibitions,</b> and <b>they assessed</b> concerning <b>him a single assessment</b> of the number of lashes that he could withstand in punishment for both transgressions, <b>he is flogged</b> in accordance with their assessment <b>and</b> is <b>exempt</b> from any additional lashes. <b>And if not,</b> if he was assessed with regard to the lashes that he could withstand for one transgression, <b>he is flogged and</b> is allowed to <b>heal, and then is flogged</b> again for violating the second prohibition.

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The case in the mishna is one where there is one assessment performed for two sets of lashes. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One does not perform one assessment for two prohibitions?</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> This is <b>not difficult; this</b> ruling in the <i>baraita</i> that one does not perform a single assessment for two prohibitions is in a case <b>where</b> doctors <b>assessed</b> concerning <b>him</b> that he is able <b>to</b> receive <b>forty-one</b> lashes, two lashes beyond a full set. Since those two additional lashes are not divisible by three, which is a requirement based on the previous mishna, he receives only thirty-nine lashes. That constitutes just one set of lashes. He remains liable to receive another set of lashes after he recovers, requiring another assessment and another set of lashes. <b>That</b> ruling in the mishna that one performs a single assessment for two prohibitions is in a case <b>where</b> doctors <b>assessed</b> concerning <b>him</b> that he is able <b>to</b> receive <b>forty-two</b> lashes. In that case, it is possible to ascribe thirty-nine lashes to one prohibition and three additional lashes to the second prohibition. That is tantamount to two separate assessments, although in practice only one assessment was performed.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>How do they flog him? He ties</b> the <b>two hands</b> of the person being flogged <b>on this</b> side <b>and that</b> side <b>of a post, and the attendant of the congregation takes hold of his garments</b> to remove them. <b>If they were ripped</b> in the process, <b>they were ripped, and if they were unraveled, they were unraveled,</b> and he continues <b>until he bares his chest. And the stone</b> upon which the attendant stands when flogging <b>is situated behind</b> the person being flogged. <b>The attendant of the congregation stands on it with a strap in his hand.</b> It is a strap <b>of calf</b> hide, and is <b>doubled, one into two, and two into four, and two straps of donkey</b> hide <b>go up and down</b> the doubled strap of calf hide. The length of <b>its handle</b> is <b>one handbreadth,</b> and the <b>width</b> of the straps is <b>one handbreadth, and</b> the strap must be long enough so that <b>its end reaches the top of his abdomen,</b> i.e., his navel, when he is flogged from behind.

### Part 11
<b>And</b> the attendant <b>flogs him</b> with <b>one-third</b> of the lashes <b>from the front of him,</b> on his chest, <b>and two</b> one-third <b>portions from behind him,</b> on his back. <b>And he does not flog him</b> when the one receiving lashes is <b>standing, nor</b> when he is <b>sitting; rather,</b> he flogs him when he is <b>hunched, as it is stated: “And the judge shall cause him to lie down,</b> and strike him” (Deuteronomy 25:2), which indicates that the one receiving lashes must be in a position that approximates lying down.

### Part 12
<b>And the</b> attendant <b>flogging</b> the one receiving lashes <b>flogs [<i>makeh</i>] him with one hand with all his strength, and the</b> court <b>crier recites</b> the verses: <b>“If you do not observe to perform</b> all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name, the Lord your God. <b>And the Lord will make your plagues [<i>makkotekha</i>] outstanding, and the plagues</b> of your descendants, and even great plagues, and of long continuance, and severe sicknesses, and of long continuance” (Deuteronomy 28:58–59). <b>And</b> then <b>he returns to the beginning of the verse.</b> He also recites: <b>“And you shall observe the matters of this covenant,</b> and do them, that you may make all that you do to prosper” (Deuteronomy 29:8), <b>and concludes</b> with the verse: <b>“And He is merciful and shall atone for transgression, and destroys not;</b> and many a time does He turn His anger away, and does not stir up all His wrath” (Psalms 78:38), <b>and</b> then <b>returns to the beginning of the verse</b> that starts: “If you do not observe to perform.”

### Part 13
<b>If</b> the one being flogged <b>dies at</b> the <b>hand</b> of the attendant, the latter is <b>exempt,</b> because he acted at the directive of the court. If the attendant <b>added for him an additional</b> lash with <b>a strap and he died,</b> the attendant <b>is exiled</b> to a city of refuge <b>on his account,</b> as an unwitting murderer. <b>If</b> the one being flogged involuntarily <b>sullies himself,</b> due to fear or pain, <b>whether with excrement or with urine,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from further lashes. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the threshold of shame for men and women is different: <b>The man</b> is exempted if he sullies himself <b>with excrement, and the woman</b> is exempted even <b>with urine.</b>
