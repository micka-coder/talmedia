### Part 1
<b>Rather,</b> say that he created five bald spots <b>with one forewarning; is one liable</b> in that case? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (21a): <b>A nazirite who was drinking wine all day is liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes; if onlookers <b>said to him: Do not drink, do not drink,</b> forewarning him several times, <b>and he drinks</b> after each forewarning, he is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for each and every</b> drink. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is necessary only</b> with regard to one <b>who,</b> after one forewarning, <b>smeared his five fingers</b> in a <b>depilatory</b> agent <b>[<i>nasha</i>] and</b> then <b>placed</b> his fingers <b>simultaneously</b> on his hair, thereby creating five bald spots, <b>as</b> in that case, <b>it is</b> tantamount to <b>a forewarning for each and every</b> bald spot that he created. The novel element is that each bald spot is an independent transgression.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara asks: <b>And how much is the measure of a bald spot</b> for which one is liable? <b>Rav Huna says:</b> It must be of <b>sufficient</b> size so <b>that</b> bald skin <b>will be visible on his head. Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon:</b> It is the size of <b>a Cilician bean [<i>kigeris</i>].</b> The Gemara comments: This amoraic dispute is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: And how much is the measure of a bald spot?</b> It is the size of <b>a Cilician bean. <i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> It must be of <b>sufficient</b> size so <b>that</b> bald skin <b>will be visible on his head.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yehuda bar Ḥaviva said</b> that there are <b>three <i>tanna’im</i></b> who <b>disagree concerning</b> this matter. <b>One says:</b> A spot the size of <b>a Cilician bean; and one says:</b> A spot of <b>sufficient</b> size so <b>that</b> bald skin <b>will be visible on his head; and one says:</b> A spot that is the measure <b>of two hairs. And there is one who removed</b> the opinion that it is the measure of <b>two hairs, and inserted</b> an opinion that it is the size <b>of a lentil. And your mnemonic</b> to remember the different opinions is from a mishna with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of leprosy (<i>Nega’im</i> 6:5): The measure of impurity for <b>a snow-white leprous mark [<i>baheret</i>]</b> is <b>a Cilician bean, and</b> the measure of impurity for the <b>raw</b> flesh that grows within the <i>baheret</i> is <b>a lentil.</b>

### Part 4
In a related <i>halakha</i>, the Sages <b>taught: One who removes a scissorsful [<i>melo pi hazug</i>]</b> of hair from his head <b>on Shabbat is liable. And how much is a scissorsful? Rav Yehuda says: Two</b> hairs. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For a bald spot</b> the measure is <b>two</b> hairs, from which it may be inferred that the measure with regard to labor on Shabbat is different than for a bald spot. The Gemara answers: Emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>say: And likewise with regard to a bald spot</b> the measure is <b>two</b> hairs, indicating that the measure for Shabbat and the measure for a bald spot are the same.

### Part 5
<b>That is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who removes a scissorsful</b> of hair <b>on Shabbat is liable. And how much is a scissorsful?</b> It is <b>two</b> hairs. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One</b> hair. <b>And the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Eliezer in</b> the case of <b>one who removes white</b> hairs <b>from black</b> ones, <b>even</b> if he removes <b>one</b> hair, <b>that he is liable.</b> Since his intent was to remove that particular hair, its removal constitutes a complete action. The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> for a man, <b>that matter is prohibited even during the week, due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated: “Neither shall a man don a woman’s garment”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:5). Removal of white hairs for the purposes of beautification is characteristic of women, and it is prohibited for a man to perform those actions.

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And one who rounds the edge of his head</b> is flogged. <b>The Sages taught: The edge of his head</b> is <b>the extremity of his head. And what is the extremity of his head? This is</b> a reference to <b>one who levels</b> the hairline of <b>his temples to</b> the hairline <b>behind his ear and to</b> the hairline of <b>his forehead.</b> There is no hair behind the ears or on the forehead. One who removes the hair from the temples so that they are like those areas violates the prohibition against rounding the edges of his head.

### Part 7
<b>The <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Ḥisda: Both one who rounds</b> the edges of his head <b>and one</b> for <b>whom</b> the edges of his head <b>are rounded</b> are <b>flogged.</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: Is one who eats dates</b> that are <b>in a sieve [<i>arbeila</i>] flogged?</b> By analogy, if a person rounded the edges of another’s head, why should the person whose head was rounded receive lashes? He performed no action. Rav Ḥisda proceeded to explain to the <i>tanna</i>: In response to one <b>who says to you: Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>? Say that <b>it is Rabbi Yehuda, who says:</b> In the case of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action, one is flogged for its</b> violation.

### Part 8
<b>Rava says:</b> This <i>baraita</i> can be explained as referring <b>to one who rounds</b> the edges of his head <b>for himself,</b> and he is liable both for rounding the edges of his head and for having the edges of his head rounded; <b>and everyone agrees</b> that he is flogged because he performed an action. <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> This <i>baraita</i> can be explained as referring to a case <b>where</b> the one for whom the edges of his head are being rounded <b>assists</b> the person rounding his head, by repositioning his head to facilitate that rounding, <b>and everyone agrees</b> that he is flogged.

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And one who mars the edge of his beard</b> is flogged. <b>The Sages taught: The edge of his beard</b> is <b>the extremity of his beard. And what is the extremity of his beard?</b> It is <b>the stalk of his beard,</b> i.e., the five edges of the beard enumerated in the mishna where hair collects in one spot, like grain on stalks.

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And one who cuts one incision</b> in a display of mourning <b>over the dead</b> is flogged. <b>The Sages taught</b> a halakhic midrash on the verse: “And an incision for the soul you shall not place in your flesh” (Leviticus 19:28). Had the verse stated only: <b>“And an incision,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that this prohibition applies to any incision cut in sorrow, <b>even</b> if he <b>cut</b> an incision in sorrow <b>over his house that collapsed, or over his ship that sunk at sea.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For the soul,”</b> from which it is derived that <b>he is liable</b> for an incision in mourning <b>only for the dead alone. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that one who cuts five incisions</b> in mourning <b>over one dead</b> person <b>is liable for each and every</b> incision? <b>The verse states: “And an incision” to render</b> him <b>liable for each and every incision.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: From where</b> is it derived <b>concerning one who cuts one incision</b> in mourning <b>over five dead</b> people, <b>that he is liable for each and every</b> person for whom he cut that incision? <b>The verse states: “For the soul,” to render</b> him <b>liable for each and every dead</b> person.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you</b> already <b>derive</b> from the term “for the soul” an exemption for one who cut an incision in sorrow <b>over his house that collapsed, or over his ship that sunk at sea?</b>
