### Part 1
to teach <b>only with regard to one who partakes</b> of the flesh <b>of a burnt-offering after</b> the <b>sprinkling, even inside</b> the courtyard, <b>that he is flogged.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rava says</b> with regard to Rabbi Shimon’s statement in the <i>baraita</i>: With regard to anyone <b>whose mother is bearing</b> a child who is <b>like Rabbi Shimon, she should bear</b> that child, <b>and if not,</b> it is preferable that <b>she does not bear</b> him at all. Rava was so impressed by Rabbi Shimon’s statement that he praised him and characterized him as the model of a wise man. Rava added: <b>And</b> I say this <b>even though there is a refutation for</b> each of his conclusions. What are the refutations?

### Part 3
<b>What</b> is the <b>stringency of first fruits vis-à-vis</b> second-<b>tithe</b> produce? It is <b>that</b> first fruits <b>are forbidden to non-priests,</b> who are permitted to eat second-tithe produce. That can be refuted; <b>on the contrary,</b> second-<b>tithe</b> produce is more <b>stringent</b> than first fruits, in <b>that</b> it is <b>forbidden to an acute mourner,</b> i.e., one whose close relative died that day, which is not the case with regard to first fruits according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon (see <i>Yevamot</i> 73b).

### Part 4
<b>And what</b> is the <b>stringency of a thanks-offering and a peace-offering vis-à-vis</b> second-<b>tithe</b> produce? It is <b>that</b> the thanks-offering and the peace-offering <b>require the placement of blood and sacrificial portions upon the altar.</b> That can be refuted; <b>on the contrary,</b> second-<b>tithe</b> produce is more <b>stringent</b> than the thanks-offering and the peace-offering, in <b>that</b> the redemption of second-tithe produce <b>requires money minted</b> into a coin. A disqualified thanks-offering and peace-offering, like other disqualified offerings, may be redeemed with any object of equal value.

### Part 5
<b>And what</b> is the <b>stringency of a firstborn</b> offering <b>vis-à-vis a thanks-offering and a peace-offering?</b> It is <b>that</b> the <b>sanctity of</b> the firstborn takes effect <b>from the womb,</b> while the other offerings are consecrated by their owners. That can be refuted; <b>on the contrary, a thanks-offering and a peace-offering are more stringent,</b> in <b>that they require placing hands</b> on the head of the offering before its sacrifice, <b>and libations, and the waving of the breast and the thigh,</b> which is not the case with regard to a firstborn offering.

### Part 6
<b>And what</b> is the <b>stringency of a sin-offering and a guilt-offering vis-à-vis a firstborn</b> offering? It is <b>that</b> a sin-offering and a guilt-offering are <b>offerings of the most sacred order.</b> That can be refuted; <b>on the contrary, a firstborn</b> offering <b>is more strin-gent,</b> in <b>that its sanctity</b> takes effect <b>from the womb,</b> not from consecration by its owner.

### Part 7
<b>And what</b> is the <b>stringency of the burnt-offering vis-à-vis a sin-offering and a guilt-offering?</b> It is <b>that</b> it is burnt in its <b>entirety</b> upon the altar, and no part of it is given to the priests. That can be refuted; <b>on the contrary, the sin-offering and the guilt-offering are</b> more <b>stringent,</b> in <b>that they atone</b> for one’s sins, and a burnt-offering is brought as a gift offering.

### Part 8
<b>And all</b> of those matters listed in the <i>baraita</i> are more <b>stringent than the burnt-offering because there are two consumptions with regard to</b> each of these matters, as they are consumed upon the altar and consumed by their owner and the priests, whereas the burnt-offering is consumed in its entirety upon the altar.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning of this statement of praise: With regard to anyone <b>whose mother is bearing</b> a child who is <b>like Rabbi Shimon,</b> she should bear that child, and if not, it is preferable if she does not bear him at all? Ultimately, all of his derivations can be refuted. The Gemara answers: The praise is based on the fact <b>that</b> in order <b>to</b> arrive at <b>what he himself holds, he transposes the verse and interprets it.</b> Rabbi Shimon does not interpret the verse from beginning to end; rather, he begins with the final case of first fruits, in order to arrive at the desired conclusion. Rava was impressed with Rabbi Shimon’s interpretation.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks with regard to Rabbi Shimon, who derived prohibitions not written in the Torah by means of <i>a fortiori</i> inferences: <b>And does one</b> derive <b>a prohibition from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference? But even according to the one who says</b> that if there is a prohibition written explicitly in the Torah, <b>one administers punishment</b> based <b>on</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference, one does not</b> derive <b>a prohibition from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference.</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon does not derive prohibitions for which one is flogged from those inferences; rather, he derives <b>a mere prohibition.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rava say:</b> With regard to <b>a non-priest who ate</b> the flesh <b>of a burnt-offering before sprinkling</b> its blood, <b>outside the walls, according to Rabbi Shimon</b> he <b>is flogged</b> with <b>five</b> sets of lashes: One because he is a non-priest; one for eating a burnt-offering; one for eating the flesh of an offering before its blood was sprinkled; one for eating offerings of the most sacred order outside the Temple courtyard; and one for eating sacrificial food outside of Jerusalem. Apparently, Rabbi Shimon holds that all these are actual prohibitions for which one is flogged. The Gemara answers: It does not mean that one is actually flogged; rather, it means that <b>they are five prohibitions.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>And these are</b> the people <b>who are flogged</b> by Torah law? Among them is a priest who eats first fruits before the recitation of the accompanying Torah verses, and the Gemara established that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.
