### Part 1
<b>But doesn’t Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Yosef, say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and Rabbi Yehuda ben Roetz, and Beit Shammai, and Rabbi Shimon, and Rabbi Akiva all hold</b> that the <b>vocalization</b> of the Torah <b>is authoritative,</b> not the manner in which it is written? How can Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi ascribe Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s ruling to the contrary opinion? The Gemara answers: <b>That is</b> the reason <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>And furthermore.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to them: If the tradition of the manner in which the verses in the Torah are written is authoritative, that supports my interpretation of the verse; if not, there is an additional proof.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> In the case of <b>one who cast a clod</b> of earth <b>onto a palm tree, and he severed dates</b> from the tree, <b>and the dates went</b> upon a person <b>and killed him, we have arrived at the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and the Rabbis</b> in a case where one was splitting wood and a wood chip flew through the air and killed a person In that case, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi deems him liable to be exiled, and the Rabbis deem him exempt from exile. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The cases are identical. What novel element is Rav Pappa introducing? The Gemara answers: The parallel between the cases drawn by Rav Pappa is necessary. <b>Lest you say</b> that these severed dates were not propelled by the force of his action but <b>are like</b> an item propelled by <b>a force</b> generated by the <b>force of his</b> action, and even Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would concede that in that case he is exempt from exile, Rav Pappa <b>teaches us</b> that the dates are considered to have been severed by the force of his action.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>how can you find</b> circumstances of <b>a force</b> generated by the <b>force of his</b> action where he would be exempt from exile? The Gemara answers: It can be found in a case <b>where one cast a clod</b> of earth <b>and it struck a branch</b> of the palm tree, <b>and the branch,</b> propelled by the clod, <b>proceeded to strike a cluster of dates [<i>likhevasa</i>] and severed</b> the <b>dates</b> from the branch they were on <b>and</b> the <b>dates proceeded to kill</b> a person.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who threw a stone into the public domain and killed</b> a person <b>is exiled. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: If after the stone left his hand the other</b> person <b>placed his head out</b> into the public domain <b>and received</b> a blow from the stone, <b>he is exempt,</b> as when he cast the stone into the public domain there was no one there.

### Part 5
In the case of one who <b>threw the stone into his courtyard and killed</b> a person, <b>if the victim had permission to enter into there,</b> the murderer is <b>exiled, but if not, he is not exiled, as it is stated</b> with regard to the cities of refuge: <b>“And as one who goes with his neighbor into the forest”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:5), from which it is derived: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a forest, the victim and the assailant</b> both <b>have</b> equal <b>permission to enter there, so too,</b> with regard to <b>all</b> places that <b>the victim and the assailant have permission to enter there,</b> the killer is liable. This serves <b>to exclude</b> the <b>courtyard of the homeowner, where the victim and the assailant do not</b> both <b>have permission to enter there.</b> Since the victim had no right to enter his courtyard, the unintentional murderer is exempt from exile.

### Part 6
<b>Abba Shaul says:</b> Another <i>halakha</i> can be derived from that verse: <b>Just as the cutting of wood</b> that is mentioned in the verse is <b>optional, so too, all</b> those liable to be exiled are examples of cases where the unintentional murderer was engaged in an activity that is <b>optional.</b> This serves <b>to exclude a father who strikes his son, and a teacher who oppresses his student, and an agent of the court</b> deputized to flog transgressors. If, in the course of performing the mitzva with which they are charged, they unintentionally murdered the son, the student, or the person being flogged, respectively, they are exempt.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: One who threw a stone into the public domain and killed a person is exiled. The Gemara asks: If he threw the stone <b>into the public domain,</b> why is he exiled? <b>He is an intentional</b> murderer. He knows that there are generally people in the public domain and is aware that he is likely to harm someone with the stone. <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak says:</b> The reference in the mishna is not to one who threw a stone for no reason; rather, it is a case <b>where one is demolishing his wall,</b> and one of the stones struck a person. The Gemara counters: That too is intentional, as <b>he should have examined</b> the other side of the wall to determine if there was anyone there. The Gemara answers: It is a case <b>where one is demolishing his wall at night,</b> when passersby are scarce. The Gemara asks: <b>At night too he is required to examine</b> the other side of the wall to determine if there is anyone there, as although it is uncommon, people are apt to walk through a public domain at all hours.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: The reference in the mishna is to a case <b>where one demolishes his wall into a scrap heap,</b> where there is no reasonable expectation to find anyone there, as it is located out of the way. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances of this scrap heap? If it is frequented by the multitudes</b> because it is utilized as a bathroom, <b>he is negligent; if it is not frequented by the multitudes,</b> although it is a public domain in the sense that it is not private property, <b>he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control,</b> as there was no reason to consider the possibility that someone was there.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> <b>only in</b> the case of <b>a scrap heap that is utilized</b> for people <b>to defecate there at night but is not utilized</b> for people <b>to defecate there during the day, but it happens</b> on occasion that one <b>will sit</b> there and defecate during the day. One who demolishes his wall into the scrap heap during the day <b>is neither negligent, as</b> the scrap heap <b>is not utilized</b> for people <b>to defecate there during the day, nor is he a victim of circumstances beyond his control, as it happens</b> on occasion that one <b>will sit</b> there and defecate during the day, which he should have considered. Therefore, his status is that of an unintentional murderer who is liable to be exiled.

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> If after the stone left his hand the other person placed his head out into the public domain and received a blow from the stone, he is exempt. The Gemara cites a related <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Sages taught</b> that it is written: “And the blade displaces from the wood and finds his neighbor and he dies” (Deuteronomy 19:5), from which it is inferred: <b>“And finds”;</b> this serves <b>to exclude</b> one who <b>presents himself</b> and is thereby killed by the stone. <b>From here Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: If after the stone left his hand the other</b> person <b>placed his head out</b> into the public domain <b>and received</b> a blow from the stone, the murderer is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: Is that <b>to say that</b> the term <b>“and finds” indicates</b> an item that was there <b>initially,</b> prior to the incident in question? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from that which is written with regard to one who seeks to redeem an ancestral field that he sold: “And he acquires the means and finds sufficient funds for his redemption” (Leviticus 25:26). The term <b>“and finds”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> one who, in order to accrue funds to redeem his field, sells a field that was <b>found</b> in his possession when he originally sold the field. It means <b>that he may not sell</b> land that he owns <b>in a distant</b> place <b>and redeem</b> land that he owns <b>in a proximate</b> place, or sell <b>a low-quality</b> tract of land <b>and redeem with</b> the funds accrued from that sale <b>high-quality</b> land. One may not exploit his right to redeem his land for his own advantage. This <i>baraita</i> indicates that the term “and finds” indicates an item that was not there at the time but presents itself later.

### Part 12
<b>Rava said:</b> This is not difficult, as <b>here,</b> with regard to exile, the term is interpreted in keeping <b>with the context of the verse, and there,</b> with regard to the redemption of land, the term is interpreted in keeping <b>with the context of the verse. There,</b> the term is interpreted in keeping <b>with the context of the verse.</b> The term <b>“and finds”</b> is <b>similar to</b> the phrase that precedes it: <b>“And he acquires the means.” Just as</b> the meaning of the phrase <b>“he acquires the means”</b> is that he acquires the means <b>from now,</b> as had he possessed the means beforehand he would not have sold his ancestral field at all, <b>so too,</b> the meaning of the term <b>“and finds”</b> is <b>also</b> that he finds sufficient funds <b>from now</b> and no earlier. <b>Here,</b> with regard to exile, the term is interpreted in keeping <b>with the context of the verse,</b> as the term <b>“and finds”</b> is <b>similar</b> to <b>a forest: Just as a forest</b> is <b>an entity that is there initially, so too,</b> the term <b>“and finds” also</b> is referring to <b>an entity that is there initially.</b>

### Part 13
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One who throws a stone, etc.</b> Abba Shaul derives from the verse: “And as when one goes with his neighbor into the forest” (Deuteronomy 19:5): Just as the cutting of wood mentioned in the verse is optional, so too, all those liable to be exiled are in cases where the unintentional murderer was engaged in an activity that is optional. <b>One of the Sages said to Rava: From where</b> do you know <b>that</b> the derivation is <b>from the cutting of wood</b> for a purpose <b>that</b> is <b>optional? Perhaps</b> the derivation is <b>from the cutting of wood for</b> the purpose of building <b>a <i>sukka</i> or from cutting wood for the arrangement</b> of wood on the altar, both of which are obligatory, since they are mitzvot, <b>and even so the Merciful One states: Let him be exiled.</b> Rava <b>said to him: Since if one found</b> wood already <b>cut he does not cut</b> other wood, as in that case it is <b>not a mitzva</b> to cut, <b>now,</b> when there is no wood cut <b>as well,</b> although he is cutting wood to facilitate fulfillment of a mitzva, the act of cutting the wood itself is <b>not a mitzva.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Ravina raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava</b> from clause of the mishna that states that the example of the forest serves <b>to exclude a father who strikes his son, and a teacher who oppresses his student, and an agent of the court. Let us say</b> with regard to a father who strikes his son: <b>Since if</b> the son was <b>learned,</b> it is <b>not a mitzva</b> to strike him, <b>now,</b> in a case where the son is not learned and the father strikes him to facilitate his education <b>too,</b> it is <b>not a mitzva,</b> and therefore he should be exiled. Rava replied: <b>There, even though</b> the son <b>is learned,</b> it is <b>a mitzva</b> to strike him from time to time, <b>as it is written: “Chastise your son, and he will give you rest; and he will give delight to your soul”</b> (Proverbs 29:17).

### Part 15
<b>Rava then said: That which I said is nothing,</b> as there is a different proof that the verse is not referring to cutting wood in fulfillment of a mitzva. It is written: <b>“And as when one [<i>ve’asher</i>] goes with his neighbor into the forest.”</b> Based on the term <i>asher</i>, which indicates that the entering into the forest may or may not occur, <b>what</b> is the nature of the <b>forest</b> mentioned in the verse? It is a place <b>where if one wants</b> to, <b>he enters</b> the forest, <b>and if one wants</b> to, <b>he does not enter. And if it enters your mind</b> that the verse is referring to one who cuts wood to fulfill <b>a mitzva, would it suffice if he did not enter</b> the forest? He must enter the forest to fulfill the mitzva.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said to Rava:</b> Is it so that <b>wherever</b> the term <b><i>asher</i> is written</b> in the Torah it is a case <b>where if he wants</b> to he does so, and it is not referring to a mitzva or an obligation? <b>If that is so,</b> that which is written: <b>“And a man who [<i>asher</i>] becomes impure and does not purify himself,</b> and that soul shall be excised…as he has impurified the Sanctuary of God” (Numbers 19:20), can be referring only to a case where <b>if he wants</b> to <b>he becomes impure,</b> and <b>if he wants</b> to, <b>he does not become impure.</b> But in the case of <b>a corpse with no one to bury it [<i>met mitzva</i>], where it would not suffice for him not to become impure</b> in the process of burying it, would you say: <b>So too, he is exempt</b> from the punishment of <i>karet</i> if he enters the Temple in a state of impurity?

### Part 17
Rava replied: <b>There it is different, as the verse states</b> with regard to one impure with impurity imparted by a corpse:
