### Part 1
§ With regard to the mishna itself, the Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said</b> that <b>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that one may carry a ladder from one dovecote to another</b> to take doves; <b>they disagree only</b> after one has finished at the second dovecote, whether it is permitted <b>to replace</b> the ladder to its original spot at the first dovecote, <b>as Beit Shammai say: One may not replace</b> the ladder, <b>and Beit Hillel say: One may even replace</b> it.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? With regard to a dovecote ladder,</b> which clearly serves the purpose of taking doves. <b>However,</b> in the case <b>of an attic ladder,</b> which has a variety of uses, <b>everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>prohibited,</b> as this will raise suspicions. <b>Rabbi Dosa says: One may tilt it from one window to another</b> in the same dovecote. <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say in the name of Rabbi Dosa: One may even shift</b> the ladder from one place to another by shuffling its legs.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates: <b>The sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya went out to the villages</b> to attend to their business. <b>When they came</b> back, <b>their father said to them: Did any incident</b> requiring a ruling of <i>halakha</i> <b>come to your</b> notice? <b>They said to him:</b> The issue of carrying an attic <b>ladder</b> to a dovecote <b>came to our</b> notice, <b>and we permitted it.</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to them: Go out and prohibit that which you permitted.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara explains: Rabbi Ḥiyya’s sons <b>thought</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>do not disagree with regard to an attic ladder,</b> this proves <b>by inference that</b> the <b>first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>they</b> do <b>disagree.</b> Consequently, Rabbi Ḥiyya’s sons thought that according to the first <i>tanna</i>, Beit Hillel permit even the use of a loft ladder, and they ruled in accordance with this opinion. <b>But that is not so,</b> as <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> does not disagree with him, but rather <b>he explains</b> the <b>reason of the first <i>tanna</i>.</b>

### Part 5
<b>From where</b> can this be inferred? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the first <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: One may carry a ladder from one dovecote to another. And if it enters your mind</b> to say that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>disagree with regard to an attic ladder,</b> if so, <b>this</b> phrase: <b>One may carry a ladder from one dovecote to another,</b> is inexact, as he <b>should</b> have said: <b>One may carry a ladder to a dovecote. Rather, isn’t this what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>said:</b> With regard to <b>a dovecote</b> ladder, <b>yes,</b> it is permitted to move it; however, in the case of <b>an attic</b> ladder, <b>no,</b> one may not use it.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And the others,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya’s sons, what is their reasoning? The Gemara answers that they would reply: <b>Is it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>A dovecote ladder?</b> It <b>teaches: From one dovecote to another, and</b> this simply means that it is permitted to do so <b>even</b> with regard <b>to several dovecotes.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Some say</b> a slightly different version of this incident. Rabbi Ḥiyya’s sons <b>said to him: The tilting of an attic ladder came to our</b> notice, <b>and we permitted it.</b> We were asked whether an attic ladder positioned near a dovecote before the Festival may be moved from one window to another in the same dovecote, and we allowed it. Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to them: Go out and prohibit that which you permitted.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>they thought: That which the first <i>tanna</i> prohibits,</b> i.e., moving an attic ladder, <b>Rabbi Dosa permits,</b> i.e. Rabbi Dosa is more lenient than the first <i>tanna</i> and permits moving even an attic ladder from one window to another. <b>And that is not so.</b> Rather, <b>that which the first <i>tanna</i> permits,</b> moving a dovecote ladder, <b>Rabbi Dosa prohibits.</b> He is more stringent and maintains that even a dovecote ladder may be moved only by tilting rather than in the usual manner.

### Part 8
§ The mishna taught: <b>However,</b> everyone agrees that <b>one may tilt</b> a dovecote ladder <b>from one window to another</b> in the same dovecote. The Gemara infers: <b>Apparently, with regard to rejoicing on the Festival,</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai is stringent, and</b> that of <b>Beit Hillel is lenient.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the first mishna of the tractate (2a): With regard to <b>one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a fowl on a Festival, Beit Shammai say: He may dig</b> earth <b>with a shovel and cover</b> the blood, <b>and Beit Hillel say: He may not slaughter</b> an undomesticated animal or a fowl, <b>unless he had earth prepared</b> for that purpose <b>while it was still day.</b> This indicates that it is Beit Shammai who are concerned for the honor and joy of the Festival, and they are therefore lenient with regard to covering the blood; whereas Beit Hillel do not share the same concern and are stringent about covering the blood, despite the fact that their ruling might adversely affect the joy of the Festival.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The</b> attribution of the <b>opinions</b> of the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>is reversed.</b> The opinion attributed to Beit Hillel is actually that of Beit Shammai, and vice versa. The Gemara rejects Rabbi Yoḥanan’s answer: <b>From where</b> do you infer that this extreme conclusion is necessarily the case? A different explanation is possible: <b>Perhaps Beit Shammai say</b> their opinion, that it is permitted to cover the blood, <b>only there, where there is</b> already <b>a shovel embedded</b> in the earth ready for this purpose, and therefore there are grounds for a lenient ruling. <b>However, where there is no embedded shovel,</b> they did <b>not</b> permit it.

### Part 11
<b>Alternatively,</b> it is possible to say that <b>Beit Hillel say</b> their opinion, that an act is permitted for the sake of the joy of the Festival, <b>only here, where his dovecote,</b> the place where he ultimately positions the ladder, <b>proves</b> with regard <b>to him</b> that he intended to use his ladder for a permitted purpose; <b>but there,</b> where there is no equivalent proof, they were <b>not</b> lenient. This shows that there is no clear contradiction between the rulings in the two cases.

### Part 12
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara retracts the previous version and suggests that Rabbi Yoḥanan issued his statement with regard to a different issue: <b>If</b> the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>is difficult, this is</b> what is <b>difficult:</b> It was taught in a different mishna (10a): <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not take</b> fledgling doves on a Festival <b>unless he shook</b> them, as an act of preparation, <b>while it was still day. And Beit Hillel say:</b> It is indeed necessary to perform some act of preparation to permit the taking of fledglings on a Festival, but this does not have to be done by shaking them. Rather, it is enough if one <b>stands</b> the day before <b>and says: I</b> will <b>take this</b> dove <b>and that</b> one.

### Part 13
<b>Apparently, with regard to rejoicing on the Festival,</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai is stringent and</b> that of <b>Beit Hillel is lenient. And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> as above: With regard to <b>one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a fowl on a Festival,</b> Beit Shammai are lenient and allow one to dig with a shovel to cover the blood, due to the joy of the Festival, whereas Beit Hillel do not permit one to slaughtering at all, unless there was a shovel ready from the day before. It was with regard to this contradiction that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The</b> attribution of <b>the opinions is reversed.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>But perhaps that is not so,</b> as a different explanation is possible: <b>Beit Shammai only state</b> their lenient opinion, that it is permitted to cover the blood, <b>where there is an embedded shovel.</b>
