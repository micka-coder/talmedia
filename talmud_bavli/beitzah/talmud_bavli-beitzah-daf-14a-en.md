<b>from the joints of his fingers and above,</b> i.e., he does not place the kernels mixed with chaff in his palm but on his fingers, which is an unusual way to hold them.

### Part 2
<b>They laughed at this</b> explanation <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, saying: <b>Since he alters</b> his behavior from the usual method, doing so <b>even with</b> his <b>entire hand</b> should be permitted <b>as well. Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is as <b>Rav Elazar said: One may blow</b> while holding the grain <b>with one hand</b> but not two, <b>and</b> he may even do so <b>with all his strength,</b> as this is not considered similar to a prohibited labor at all.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: Spices may be pounded</b> on a Festival in a slightly unusual manner, <b>with a wooden pestle, and salt</b> may be pounded only <b>with</b> an earthenware <b>flask or with a wooden pot ladle,</b> in a manner very different from that of a weekday. <b>And Beit Hillel say: Spices may be pounded in their</b> usual <b>manner,</b> even <b>with a stone pestle, and</b> as for <b>salt,</b> although it must be pounded in an irregular manner, a slight modification such as pounding it <b>with a wooden pestle</b> is enough to render the act permitted.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>In any event, everyone,</b> both Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, <b>agrees</b> that the pounding of <b>salt requires a change;</b> it may not be performed in the regular weekday manner. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda</b> disputed this issue. <b>One</b> of them <b>said:</b> Everyone knows that <b>all dishes require salt,</b> and therefore one should prepare salt the day before the Festival. Since he failed to do so, this task may be performed on the Festival only in an unusual manner. <b>But not all dishes require spices,</b> and therefore it is possible that on the day prior to the Festival, one was not aware that he would require spices on the Festival.

### Part 5
<b>And</b> the other <b>one said</b> a different reason: <b>All spices lose their flavor</b> and cannot be prepared ahead of time, <b>and salt does not lose its flavor,</b> which means one could have prepared it the day before. Since he neglected to do so, he may prepare salt on the Festival only in an unusual manner.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical <b>difference between</b> these two reasons? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them is</b> in a case <b>where one knew</b> beforehand <b>which</b> type of <b>dish he wants to cook</b> on the Festival. Since he knew which spices he would require, he could have prepared them the day before, and which case spices are no different from salt, and one should be required to prepare them in an unusual manner. However, if the reason is that spices lose their flavor, the fact that he knew which dishes he planned to prepare is of no relevance. <b>Alternatively,</b> there is a practical difference in the case <b>of saffron,</b> whose flavor does not dissipate over the course of a single day. Consequently, one who knows what dish he will prepare on the Festival could have prepared the saffron the day before.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: All</b> foods <b>that must be pounded</b> before being eaten may be <b>pounded in their</b> usual <b>manner, and</b> this applies <b>even</b> to <b>salt.</b> The Gemara challenges this: <b>But didn’t you say</b> that everyone agrees that <b>salt requires a change</b> in its manner of preparation? The Gemara answers: He <b>said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree in</b> the case of foods <b>that are</b> regularly <b>pounded.</b> They both maintain <b>that they may be pounded in their</b> usual <b>manner, and salt</b> can be pounded together <b>with them.</b>

### Part 8
<b>They disagreed only</b> about whether it is permitted <b>to pound</b> salt <b>by itself, as Beit Shammai say: Salt may be</b> pounded <b>with a flask and with a wooden pot ladle for roasting,</b> i.e., in small quantities, as one does not require much salt for roasting meat, <b>but</b> it may <b>not</b> be pounded in the large quantities required to salt meat <b>for</b> a cooked <b>pot. And Beit Hillel say:</b> It may be pounded <b>by anything.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this last statement: <b>By anything? Can this enter your mind?</b> How can Beit Hillel say that one may pound salt in any manner, when it has been established that everyone agrees that this may be performed only in an unusual manner? <b>Rather, say:</b> Salt may be pounded <b>for anything,</b> whether it is a small quantity for roasting or a large quantity for salting meat.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Aḥa Bardela said to his son: When you pound</b> salt, <b>tilt it</b> a little <b>to the side and</b> then <b>pound,</b> so that it will at least be performed in a slightly different manner on a Festival. The Gemara similarly relates: <b>Rav Sheshet heard the sound of a pestle</b> pounding salt on a Festival. <b>He said</b> to himself: <b>This</b> sound <b>is not</b> coming <b>from inside my house,</b> as I have instructed the members of my household not to do so.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps they tilted it</b> and pounded in a permitted manner? The Gemara answers: This could not have been the case, <b>as</b> Rav Sheshet <b>heard that it was a clear sound,</b> unlike the one produced when a pestle is tilted. The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps they were</b> pounding <b>spices,</b> which may be pounded in the regular fashion on a Festival? The Gemara answers: <b>The sound</b> produced by pounding <b>spices</b> is distinctive, <b>like a bark,</b> which he would have recognized.

### Part 11
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: On a Festival <b>one may not prepare groats [<i>tisanei</i>],</b> a dish comprised of grains of wheat crushed into quarters, which involves great effort, <b>nor may one grind</b> grain <b>with a mortar and pestle.</b> The Gemara expresses puzzlement: These are <b>two</b> contradictory rulings. The <i>tanna</i> first stated that groats alone may not be prepared, as this involves hard work, implying that other items may be ground. He subsequently states that one may not grind with a mortar and pestle at all. The Gemara answers: <b>This is what he said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> should be amended to read as follows: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>one may not prepare groats? Because one may not grind with a mortar and pestle.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> simply <b>say: One may not grind with a mortar and pestle,</b> from which it can be inferred that groats may not be prepared. The Gemara explains that <b>if he teaches</b> only: <b>One may not grind with a mortar and pestle, I would have said</b> that <b>this applies only to a large mortar and pestle,</b> whose use has the appearance of a weekday activity; <b>but with a small mortar and pestle,</b> one might <b>say it seems well,</b> and one may prepare even groats with this mortar and pestle. The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that groats may not be prepared in any manner.

### Part 13
The Gemara challenges this: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>one may not grind with a large mortar and pestle, but one may grind with a small mortar and pestle? Abaye said: Also, when</b> the first <b><i>baraita</i> was taught, it was taught</b> with regard to <b>a large mortar and pestle,</b> not a small one. In other words, the <i>baraita</i> is stating two <i>halakhot</i>, not one, as claimed previously. The <i>tanna</i> first rules that one may not prepare groats even with a small mortar and pestle, and he subsequently states that one may not use a large mortar and pestle for any purpose.
