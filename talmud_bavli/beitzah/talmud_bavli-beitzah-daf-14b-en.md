### Part 1
<b>Rava said:</b> This is <b>not difficult;</b> the <i>baraitot</i> do not contradict one another. <b>This</b> ruling, which permits a small mortar and pestle, <b>is for us,</b> the residents of Babylonia, who do not have servants, <b>and that</b> statement <b>is for them,</b> the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael, who have many servants. Since servants might treat the prohibition lightly, by using a large mortar and pestle and claiming they had used only a small one, they are prohibited from pounding in all cases.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Pappi happened to come</b> on a Festival <b>to the house</b> of <b>Mar Shmuel. He brought to him porridge,</b> made from wheat groats, <b>but he did not eat</b> it, out of concern that the wheat might have been pounded on the same day. The Gemara asks: <b>And perhaps they performed</b> the pounding <b>with a small mortar and pestle,</b> in a permitted manner? The Gemara answers: This cannot be the case, <b>as he observed that it was well ground,</b> which cannot be achieved by means of a small mortar and pestle.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And perhaps they prepared it the day before,</b> on the Festival eve? The Gemara answers: This cannot be the case, <b>as he observed that the husks</b> of the groats <b>were bright,</b> an indication that they had been prepared recently. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that he refrained from eating for another reason, because <b>the house</b> of <b>Mar Shmuel is different, as</b> he had slaves, and <b>slaves</b> are <b>lax</b> with regard to prohibitions. Therefore, Mar Shmuel ought to have prohibited all forms of grinding in his house, to ensure that no one grind anything in an inappropriate manner.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who selects legumes on a Festival</b> by separating the edible and inedible portions, <b>Beit Shammai say: He may select food and eat</b> it immediately, while leaving the refuse. <b>And Beit Hillel say: He may select in his</b> usual <b>manner, in his lap, with a tray, or with a large vessel, but he may not</b> do so <b>with a tablet, nor with a winnow, nor with a sieve,</b> as these vessels are specially designed for selecting, which gives his action the appearance of a weekday activity. <b>Rabban Gamliel says: One may even wash</b> the legumes in water <b>and skim off</b> the refuse floating on top.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Gamliel said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> Under what circumstances did Beit Hillel permit the removal of the refuse in the weekday manner of selecting? In a case <b>where the</b> quantity of the <b>food is greater than the</b> quantity of the <b>refuse. However, if</b> the quantity of <b>refuse is greater than the</b> quantity of <b>food, everyone agrees</b> that <b>one must remove the food and leave the refuse.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: If the quantity of <b>refuse is greater than the</b> quantity of <b>food, is there an opinion that permits</b> it? Since the smaller amount of food is nullified by the refuse, the entire mixture is considered <i>muktze</i> and may not be moved. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> the removal of the refuse <b>is greater in</b> terms of <b>effort, and</b> yet it is <b>smaller in size.</b> In other words, there is actually more food than refuse, but since greater effort is required to remove the refuse, it is preferable to remove the food.

### Part 7
The mishna taught that <b>Rabban Gamliel says: One may even wash</b> the legumes in water <b>and skim off</b> the refuse floating on top. <b>It is taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Beitza</i> 1): <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, said: This was the custom of the house of Rabban Gamliel, that they would bring a bucket full with lentils and pour water in it, and then</b> the <b>food</b> would sink <b>down and the refuse</b> would float <b>up,</b> which spared them from having to separate the lentils from the refuse manually.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t the opposite taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>, that the food rose to the top while the refuse sunk below? The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which says the refuse sinks down, is referring <b>to</b> refuse in the form of <b>earth,</b> which sinks below the lentils; <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, where it is stated that the refuse rises, speaks <b>of straw,</b> which floats on water.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: One may send only portions</b> of prepared food <b>on a Festival,</b> but not any other gifts. <b>And Beit Hillel say: One may</b> even <b>send</b> gifts of <b>domesticated animals, undomesticated animals, and fowl, whether alive or slaughtered.</b> Similarly, <b>one may send wines, oils, and</b> vessels of <b>flour, and</b> even <b>legumes, but not grain,</b> which is unfit for use, as one may not grind it on the Festival. <b>And Rabbi Shimon permits</b> sending gifts even in the case <b>of grain,</b> as it can be made into porridge without being ground.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yeḥiel teaches: And</b> one may send these items <b>provided that he does not do it by</b> means of <b>a convoy</b> of people, as they would look as though they were transporting merchandise to the marketplace. It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A convoy</b> consists of <b>no less than three people;</b> if there are fewer than three, it is not called a convoy and is permitted. <b>Rav Ashi raised a dilemma:</b> In a case of <b>three people and three</b> different <b>types</b> of food, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this considered a convoy, or does the fact that there are three different types of food mean that each of them is considered a separate item? The Gemara answers: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved, as no answer was found.

### Part 11
The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Shimon permits</b> the sending <b>of grain. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon permits</b> the sending <b>of grain, for example: Wheat to prepare from it <i>ludiyot</i>,</b> a type of cookie; <b>barley to place before his animal;</b> or <b>lentils to prepare from them <i>resisin</i>,</b> a dish made from crushed lentils.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may send clothes, whether</b> they are <b>sewn or whether they are unsewn, and even if they contain diverse kinds,</b> a prohibited mixture of wool and linen [<i>sha’atnez</i>]. <b>But</b> one may do so only if <b>they</b> serve <b>the purposes of the Festival. However, one may not</b> send <b>a spiked sandal,</b> which has nails fixed to it, as the Sages decreed that one may not wear a sandal of this kind on a Shabbat or Festival, <b>nor an unsewn shoe,</b> which is not suitable for a Festival. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not even</b> send <b>a white shoe,</b> which people do not usually wear, <b>because</b> it <b>requires an artisan</b> to paint it black. <b>This is the</b> general <b>principle:</b> Anything <b>that one may use on a Festival, one may send it.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks a question: <b>Granted,</b> it is permitted to send <b>sewn</b> clothes, as they are <b>suitable for wearing.</b> With regard to clothes <b>that are not sewn as well, they are</b> at least <b>suitable for covering</b> oneself. <b>But</b> in the case of clothes than contain <b>diverse kinds, for what</b> use <b>are they suited?</b> Since these clothes may not be used on the Festival, why is it permitted to send them?

### Part 14
<b>And if you say</b> that clothes of diverse kinds <b>are suited for one to place underneath himself, but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Neither shall there come upon you</b> a garment of diverse kinds” (Leviticus 19:19)? This verse teaches that one may not wear this garment, <b>but</b> by Torah law <b>you may spread it beneath you. However, the Sages said: It is prohibited to do so, lest a thread [<i>nima</i>] wind itself around his flesh.</b> This shows that the Sages prohibited even spreading underneath oneself a cloth that contains a mixture of wool and linen.

### Part 15
<b>And if you say that</b> the allowance of cloth of diverse kinds is referring to a case where <b>there is something separating between them,</b> i.e., one may place a garment of diverse kinds beneath another object, <b>but didn’t Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said, in the name of the sacred congregation in Jerusalem: Even</b> in a case of <b>ten mattresses</b> placed <b>one on top of the other and</b> a cloth of <b>diverse kinds underneath them, it is prohibited to sleep on them, as it is stated: “Neither shall there come upon you”</b> (Leviticus 19:19).

### Part 16
<b>Rather,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to a curtain [<i>vilon</i>]</b> of diverse kinds, which may be hung up, as it is not an item of clothing. The Gemara challenges this: <b>But didn’t Ulla say: For what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that <b>a curtain is ritually impure,</b> i.e., that it can contract the impurity of a vessel despite the fact that it is not directly used by people? <b>Because the attendant warms himself with it.</b> Since attendants use curtains as makeshift blankets when they are cold, a curtain may not be made from a mixture of wool and linen.
