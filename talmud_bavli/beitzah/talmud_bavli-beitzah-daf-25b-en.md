### Part 1
merely <b>teaches us</b> proper <b>etiquette,</b> even though no prohibition is involved.

### Part 2
§ The Sages teach proper manners unconnected to any prohibition, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person</b> should <b>not eat garlic or onions</b> from the side of <b>its head,</b> i.e., its roots, <b>but</b> rather <b>from</b> the side of <b>its leaves. And if he did eat</b> in that manner, <b>he</b> gives the appearance of being <b>a glutton. Similarly, a person</b> should <b>not drink his cup</b> of wine all <b>at once, and if he did drink</b> in this manner, <b>he</b> gives the appearance of being <b>a</b> greedy <b>drinker. The Sages taught</b> in this regard: <b>One who drinks his cup</b> all <b>at once is a</b> greedy <b>drinker;</b> if he does so <b>in two</b> swallows, this is proper <b>etiquette;</b> in <b>three</b> swallows, he is <b>of haughty spirit,</b> as he presents himself as overly delicate and refined.

### Part 3
Apropos the previous discussion, the Gemara notes that <b>Rami bar Abba</b> also <b>said: The sea squill,</b> a plant from the lily family whose roots project deep into the ground, will <b>cut off the feet of the wicked</b> in the future on the Day of Judgment. It was customary to plant sea squill on the edges of fields as boundary markers because their roots grow straight down without spreading out. Those who overstepped boundaries and infringed upon their neighbor’s property should have heeded the markers and desisted.

### Part 4
Similarly, <b>young trees will cut off the feet of butchers and those who have relations with menstruating women.</b> After a tree is planted, one must wait three years before eating its fruit. This should serve as a lesson for those butchers who hasten to eat of the animal’s meat before removing its hide, and for those who have relations with their menstruating wives and do not wait for them to achieve ritual purification.

### Part 5
<b>The lupine [<i>turmus</i>],</b> an extremely bitter legume that is edible only after an extensive process, <b>will cut off the feet of the enemies of the Jewish people,</b> a euphemism for the Jewish people themselves. <b>As it is stated: “And the children of Israel continued to do evil in the eyes of the Lord, and served the Baalim and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Aram and the gods of Zidon and the gods of Moab and the gods of the children of Ammon and the gods of the Philistines, and they forsook the Lord and did not serve Him”</b> (Judges 10:6).

### Part 6
<b>By inference from</b> that <b>which is stated: “And they forsook the Lord,” do I not know that they did not serve Him? Rather,</b> for <b>what</b> purpose <b>does the verse state</b> the seemingly unnecessary words <b>“and did not serve Him”? Rabbi Elazar said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: My children did not treat Me even like this lupine, which,</b> because it is inedible as it is, must be <b>cooked</b> in water <b>seven times</b> in order to temper its bitter taste <b>and</b> is eventually made so sweet that <b>one eats it as a dessert</b> after <b>a meal.</b> They worshipped all seven types of idolatry listed in the verse, and even after I punished them for each and every one of them, they still refused to repent from their evil ways. Instead, they remained rebellious and did not serve Me.

### Part 7
The Gemara considers another aspect of the character of the Jewish people. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in the name of Rabbi Meir: For what reason was the Torah given to the Jewish people?</b> It is <b>because they are impudent,</b> and Torah study will weaken and humble them. A Sage <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> the following with regard to the verse: <b>“From His right hand went a fiery law for them”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2); <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said:</b> Based on their nature and character, <b>these</b> people, the Jews, are <b>fit to be given a fiery law,</b> a hard and scorching faith. <b>Some say</b> a different version of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>The ways</b> and nature <b>of these</b> people, the Jews, <b>are</b> like <b>fire, as, were it not for</b> the fact that <b>the Torah was given to the Jewish people,</b> whose study and observance restrains them, <b>no nation or tongue could withstand them.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And this is</b> the same as <b>what Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: There are three impudent ones: The Jewish people among the nations;</b> the <b>dog among animals;</b> and the <b>rooster among birds. And some say: Also</b> the <b>goat among small cattle. And some say: Also</b> the <b>caper bush among trees.</b>

### Part 9
§ It is taught in the mishna: If <b>one slaughtered</b> an animal on a Festival <b>in the field, he may not bring it</b> to his house <b>on a pole,</b> as this appears similar to a weekday activity. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A <b>blind person may not go out</b> on a Festival <b>with his cane, nor a shepherd with his satchel. And one may not go out on a chair</b> borne on poles by other people, <b>neither a man nor a woman.</b> All of these are considered weekday activities, the performance of which would display disrespect for the Festival.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi send</b> the following <i>halakha</i> from Eretz Yisrael: <b>There was an old man in our neighborhood who would go out</b> on a Festival <b>in his litter [<i>gelodki</i>], and they came and asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi,</b> the preeminent authority of the time, whether this was permitted. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said</b> to them: <b>If many</b> people <b>need</b> the man to come and lecture them on Torah matters, <b>it is permitted</b> to transport him to the study hall in that manner.

### Part 11
Similarly, <b>our Sages relied on the statement of Aḥi Shakkaya, who said: I</b> once <b>brought Rav Huna</b> on a Festival <b>from</b> the town of <b>Hinei to</b> the town of <b>Shilei and from Shilei</b> back <b>to Hinei</b> on a chair of this kind. <b>And Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: I</b> once <b>brought Mar Shmuel</b> on such a seat on a Festival <b>from the sun into the shade and from the shade into the sun.</b> All of these incidents indicate that it is in fact permitted to use such a chair on a Festival. The Gemara answers: These cases pose no difficulty, <b>as there, it is in accordance with the reason that</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>stated: If many</b> people <b>need him, it is permitted.</b> However, one who is not needed by the public may not go out in such a chair.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Naḥman said to Ḥama bar Adda, emissary of</b> the talmudic academies in <b>Zion,</b> who would regularly travel back and forth from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia: <b>When you go up there,</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>take a roundabout</b> route, i.e., do not travel by the shortest path; <b>and go to the Ladder of Tyre, and go to Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi,</b> who lives in Tyre, <b>and raise</b> this <b>dilemma before him: What do you say with regard to a chair</b> borne on poles; may one go out in such a chair on a Festival?

### Part 13
<b>By the time he arrived there, Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi had</b> already <b>passed away.</b> However, <b>when he went up</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>he found Rabbi Zerika</b> and <b>said to him: What do you say with regard to a chair</b> borne on poles; what is your opinion on this topic? <b>He said to him: Rabbi Ami said as follows:</b> It is permitted <b>provided that he is not carried on the shoulders,</b> on the chair. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>Provided that he is not carried on the shoulders? Rav Yosef, son of Rabba, said:</b> It means <b>on poles [<i>alunkei</i>]</b> that are used to carry burdens on the shoulders of two people. This mode of transportation is highly conspicuous and has the appearance of a weekday activity, the performance of which displays disrespect for the Festival. Instead, the poles on which the chair is borne should be held in the bearers’ hands, so the seat will be closer to the ground and less noticeable.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Naḥman permit</b> his wife <b>Yalta to go out</b> on a Festival <b>on</b> a chair borne on <b>poles</b> that rested on the shoulders of the bearers? The Gemara answers: <b>Yalta is different, as she was afraid</b> of falling and therefore required this special arrangement.

### Part 15
The Gemara relates that <b>Ameimar and Mar Zutra would be carried</b> to their places in the study hall <b>on the shoulders</b> of their students for the public lecture delivered <b>on</b> the <b>Shabbat of the Festival.</b> They would be carried in that manner <b>due to</b> their <b>fear</b> of falling. <b>And some say</b> the reason was <b>due to the pushing of the crowd,</b> as these Sages were afraid of being crushed by the large number of people attending the lecture.

### Part 16
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A male firstborn of cattle, sheep, or goats belonging to a Jew is sanctified from birth and must be given to a priest to be sacrificed on the altar in the Temple. If a firstborn animal acquired a physical blemish that disqualifies it from being sacrificed as an offering, it still must be given to a priest, but it may be redeemed, slaughtered, and eaten as non-sacred meat. If <b>a firstborn</b> animal <b>fell into a cistern</b> on a Festival, and there is concern that it might die there, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: An expert</b> in these matters <b>goes down</b> into the cistern <b>and examines</b> the animal.
