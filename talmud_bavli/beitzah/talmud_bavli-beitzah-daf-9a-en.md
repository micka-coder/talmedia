### Part 1
If <b>one kneaded dough on a Festival eve,</b> i.e., the day before the Festival, <b>he may separate its <i>ḥalla</i> on the Festival.</b> In general, one may not separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes on a Festival. However, since it is permitted bake bread on the Festival for the requirements of the day, and because bread may not be eaten unless <i>ḥalla</i> has first been separated from it, separating <i>ḥalla</i> is considered a necessary stage in the preparation of bread, and the Sages permitted it. <b>Shmuel’s father said: Even</b> if <b>one kneaded dough on a Festival eve, he may not separate its <i>ḥalla</i> on the Festival,</b> as he should have separated <i>ḥalla</i> then. The mitzva of separating <i>ḥalla</i> goes into effect at the time of the kneading of the dough.

### Part 2
The Gemara comments: <b>Let us say that Shmuel disagrees with his father, as Shmuel said:</b> With regard <b>to <i>ḥalla</i> from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, where the separation of <i>ḥalla</i> is a rabbinic obligation, <b>one may proceed to eat</b> the bread <b>and afterward separate</b> the <i>ḥalla</i> from the remainder of the dough. This statement indicates that the separation of <i>ḥalla</i> outside of Eretz Yisrael is not required to render the bread permitted, in contrast to the separation of <i>teruma</i> and tithes from produce. Consequently, separating <i>ḥalla</i> is permitted on a Festival, as it does not involve a significant change. This contradicts the opinion of Shmuel’s father, who prohibited separating <i>ḥalla</i> that could have been separated before the Festival.

### Part 3
<b>Rava said:</b> This is not necessarily the case. <b>Doesn’t Shmuel concede that if one designated</b> a piece of dough <b>as</b> <i>ḥalla</i> outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>it is prohibited to non-priests?</b> This proves that even Shmuel admits that a certain measure of sanctity applies to the <i>ḥalla</i>. Therefore, he might also agree with his father that it is prohibited to separate <i>ḥalla</i> on a Festival even outside of Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not carry a ladder,</b> which was used for reaching doves, <b>from one dovecote to another. However,</b> one may move it slightly so that <b>he tilts it from one window to another</b> in the same dovecote. <b>And Beit Hillel permit</b> even carrying a ladder from one dovecote to another.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Ami said:</b> This <b>dispute</b> applies only in a case where one moves the ladder <b>in the public domain, as Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>one who sees</b> someone carrying his ladder will <b>say</b> to himself: <b>He</b> must <b>need</b> the ladder <b>to plaster his roof,</b> to prevent rainwater from dripping into his house. In other words, an onlooker will suspect him of performing prohibited labor on the Festival. <b>And Beit Hillel hold</b> that <b>his dovecote proves about him</b> that he is not moving the ladder for the purpose of a transgression, as it is evident that he is placing the ladder alongside the second dovecote, and everyone will understand his intention. <b>However, in the private domain,</b> where one will not be observed by strangers, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is permitted.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav said: Wherever the Sages prohibited</b> an action <b>due to the appearance</b> of prohibition, <b>even</b> if one performs the act <b>in</b> his <b>innermost chamber,</b> where no one will see it, it is <b>prohibited.</b> The Gemara answers: This <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One whose clothes fell into water on Shabbat or a Festival <b>may spread them out</b> to dry <b>in the sun, but he may not</b> do so <b>opposite the masses,</b> i.e., in a place where people can see him, lest they suspect him of laundering on Shabbat. However, <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</b> doing so even in private.

### Part 7
<b>Some say</b> a different version of this discussion. <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Ami said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> applies <b>to the private domain, as Beit Shammai are of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with that which <b>Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said,</b> and therefore Beit Shammai apply the decree to the private domain. <b>And Beit Hillel,</b> by contrast, <b>are of</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>not</b> in accordance with that which <b>Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said. However, in the public domain, everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>prohibited</b> to move the ladder.

### Part 8
The Gemara challenges this interpretation: <b>Should we say</b> that Rav <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> that of <b>Beit Shammai?</b> According to Rav Ḥanan bar Ami, only Beit Shammai maintains that anything prohibited by the Sages due to appearances may not be performed even in private.

### Part 9
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: No, <b>it is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If clothes fell into water on Shabbat or a Festival, <b>one may spread them out in the sun but not opposite the masses. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</b> doing so. Rav Ḥanan bar Ami accepts the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> in the <i>baraita</i>, who rejects Rav’s principle. According to the opinion of that <i>tanna</i>, it can be claimed that Beit Hillel also rejected Rav’s principle, and they permitted moving the ladder in private but not in public. Rav, on the other hand, follows the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon in interpreting the opinion of Beit Hillel.
