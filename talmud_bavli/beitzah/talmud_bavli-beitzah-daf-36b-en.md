### Part 1
<b>but rather say</b> the following: <b>Provided he does not make it a trap</b> as he covers it, i.e., as long as he takes care not to cover all the openings. The Gemara questions this: But it is <b>obvious</b> that it is prohibited to directly trap bees on Shabbat; why would the <i>baraita</i> mention it? The Gemara responds: It does inform us of something that is not obvious: <b>Lest you say:</b> An animal <b>whose type is</b> generally <b>trapped</b> and hunted by people for some purpose is <b>prohibited</b> to be trapped on Shabbat, whereas an animal <b>whose type is not</b> generally <b>trapped,</b> such as a bee, is <b>permitted</b> to be trapped even <i>ab initio</i>, as this is not considered to be the normal manner of hunting. The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that one may not in fact trap bees.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> a different elucidation: <b>Is it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>In the summer, and: In the rainy season?</b> No, <b>it is taught: In the sun due to the sun and in the rain due to the rain.</b> The <i>baraita</i> speaks not of the summer and the rainy season, but <b>of the</b> spring <b>days of Nisan and the</b> autumn <b>days of Tishrei, when there is</b> sometimes <b>sun and there is</b> sometimes <b>rain, and</b> when <b>there is</b> also <b>honey</b> in the hive. It is possible, then, that the <i>baraita</i> permits covering the hive during these seasons because of the honey that is in it, as initially proposed.

### Part 3
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And one may place a vessel beneath a leak</b> in order to catch the water <b>on Shabbat.</b> A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If the vessel became full</b> with the leaking water, <b>he may pour out</b> its contents, place the vessel back under the leak, <b>and repeat</b> the entire process if necessary, <b>and</b> he need <b>not refrain</b> from doing so.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates: <b>Abaye’s millhouse</b> once <b>developed a leak</b> on Shabbat. Abaye was concerned about the potential damage to the millstones, which were made partly of clay and which would become ruined from the leaking water, and he did not have enough buckets to catch all the water without emptying and refilling them. But the water was unfit for drinking and was therefore <i>muktze</i> and could not be removed. Abaye <b>came before Rabba</b> to ask him how to proceed. Rabba <b>said to him: Go</b> and <b>bring your bed into</b> the millhouse, <b>so that</b> the dirty water <b>will be</b> considered <b>like a container of excrement,</b> which, despite being <i>muktze</i>, may be removed from one’s presence due to its repulsive nature, <b>and</b> then <b>remove</b> the water.

### Part 5
<b>Abaye sat</b> and examined the matter <b>and posed a difficulty: And may one initiate</b> a situation of <b>a container of excrement,</b> i.e., may one intentionally place any repulsive matter into a situation which will bother him and will then have to be removed, <b><i>ab initio</i>? In the meantime,</b> as he was deliberating the issue, <b>Abaye’s millhouse collapsed. He said: I had</b> this <b>coming to me for having gone against the words of my master,</b> Rabba, by not following his ruling unquestioningly.

### Part 6
<b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>a container of excrement and a container of urine, it is permitted to remove them</b> on Shabbat <b>to a garbage heap. And when he returns</b> the container to the house <b>he must place water in it</b> first <b>and</b> then <b>return it,</b> for it is prohibited to carry these containers alone, as their foul odor makes them <i>muktze</i> due to their repulsive nature.

### Part 7
Some Sages at first <b>understood from</b> the wording of Shmuel’s statement that with regard to removing <b>a container of excrement on account of the vessel,</b> i.e., along with its vessel: <b>Yes,</b> this is permitted; but to remove the excrement <b>by itself,</b> without a vessel containing it: <b>No,</b> this is prohibited. The Gemara counters this conclusion with the following story: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that a certain</b> dead <b>mouse was discovered in Rav Ashi’s storeroom</b> for <b>spices</b> [<b><i>isparmekei</i></b>]. <b>Rav Ashi said to them: Take hold of it by its tail and remove it.</b> This shows that repulsive matter may be removed even directly.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Any act for which one is liable due to a rabbinic decree</b> made to enhance the character of Shabbat as a day of <b>rest [<i>shevut</i>];</b> or if it is notable <b>because it is optional,</b> i.e., it involves an aspect of a mitzva but is not a complete mitzva; or if it is notable <b>because it is</b> a full-fledged <b>mitzva,</b> if it is prohibited <b>on Shabbat, one is liable for it on a Festival</b> as well.

### Part 9
<b>And these are</b> the acts prohibited by the Sages <b>as <i>shevut</i>: One may not climb a tree</b> on Shabbat, <b>nor ride on an animal, nor swim in the water, nor clap</b> his hands together, <b>nor clap</b> his hand on the <b>thigh, nor dance.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And the following</b> are acts that are prohibited on Shabbat and are notable <b>because they are optional,</b> i.e., which involve an aspect of a mitzva but are not complete mitzvot: <b>One may not judge, nor betroth</b> a woman, <b>nor perform <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> which is done in lieu of levirate marriage, <b>nor perform levirate marriage.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And the following</b> are prohibited on Shabbat despite the fact that they are notable <b>because of the</b> full-fledged <b>mitzva</b> involved in them: <b>One may not consecrate, nor take a valuation vow</b> (see Leviticus 27), <b>nor consecrate</b> objects for use by the priests or the Temple, <b>nor separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes</b> from produce.

### Part 12
The Sages <b>spoke</b> of <b>all these</b> acts being prohibited even <b>with regard to a Festival; all the more so</b> are they prohibited <b>on Shabbat.</b> The general principle is: <b>There is no</b> difference <b>between a Festival and Shabbat, except for</b> work involving preparation of <b>food alone,</b> which is permitted on a Festival but prohibited on Shabbat.

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies the reasons for each of these <i>halakhot</i>: <b>One may not climb a tree.</b> This is <b>a decree</b> that was made <b>lest one detach</b> branches or leaves as he climbs, thereby transgressing the prohibited labor of reaping.

### Part 14
<b>Nor ride on an animal:</b> This is <b>a decree</b> that was made <b>lest one go beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit</b> on the animal. The Gemara asks: Can one then <b>learn from here</b> that the prohibition against venturing beyond <b>the</b> Shabbat <b>limits,</b> which applies also to Festivals, <b>is by Torah law?</b> If the prohibition with regard to the Shabbat limit were rabbinic, the Sages would not have reinforced it with the additional decree against riding an animal. It is known that this is a matter of dispute; in light of this explanation of the mishna it would be a proof that Shabbat boundaries are of Torah origin. <b>Rather,</b> give a different reason for the prohibition: It is <b>a decree</b> that was made <b>lest one cut off a branch</b> to use as a riding switch, and thereby perform the labor of reaping, which is prohibited by Torah law.

### Part 15
<b>Nor swim in the water:</b> This is <b>a decree</b> that was made <b>lest one make a swimmer’s barrel,</b> i.e., an improvised flotation device used to teach beginners how to swim.

### Part 16
<b>Nor clap</b> one’s hands together, <b>nor clap his hand on the thigh, nor dance:</b> All of these are prohibited due to <b>a decree</b> that was made <b>lest one assemble put together a musical instrument</b> to accompany his clapping or dancing.

### Part 17
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And the following</b> are acts that are prohibited on Shabbat and are notable <b>because they are optional,</b> i.e., which involve an aspect of a mitzva but are not complete mitzvot: <b>One may not judge.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t one perform</b> a full-fledged <b>mitzva</b> by acting as a judge in a court? Why is it categorized as optional rather than as a full-fledged mitzva? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to categorize it as optional, as it is speaking of a case <b>where there is</b> another person <b>who is more</b> qualified <b>than he.</b> Since the other person can judge even better, it is not considered an absolute mitzva for the first one to judge.

### Part 18
§ <b>Nor betroth</b> a woman: The Gemara asks: Why is this categorized as optional, indicating that it is not a full-fledged mitzva? <b>But doesn’t one perform a</b> full-fledged <b>mitzva</b> when he marries, as this enables him to fulfill the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to categorize it as optional,
