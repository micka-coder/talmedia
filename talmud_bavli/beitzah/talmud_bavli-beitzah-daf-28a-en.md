### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A person</b> selling meat on a Festival who wishes to know its weight in order to determine its price may not weigh it against regular weights in the ordinary weekday manner, but he may <b>weigh</b> the <b>meat against</b> a <b>vessel or against</b> a <b>cleaver [<i>kofitz</i>]</b> and then calculate the weight of the meat by weighing the vessel or cleaver later. <b>And the Rabbis say: One</b> may <b>not look at the pans of a</b> balance <b>scale at all,</b> meaning that they may not be used for weighing in any manner or for any other purpose.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: One may not look at the pans of a scale <b>at all? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Even</b> if one has meat and he wishes <b>to protect it from mice,</b> he may not put it on a scale, since it would look as if he were weighing it. <b>Rav Idi bar Avin said: And this</b> ruling applies only <b>where</b> the scale <b>is hanging on the ring</b> used for balancing it. However, if the scale is hanging in such a manner that it is not fit for weighing, one may use it as he would use any other vessel.

### Part 3
<b>And Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: It is prohibited for an expert butcher to weigh meat</b> on a Festival even <b>by hand</b> because he can arrive at its precise weight using this method, and so it is prohibited like weighing with a scale. <b>And</b> likewise, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: It is prohibited for an expert butcher to weigh meat</b> on a Festival even <b>in water.</b> Butchers would calculate the weight of a slab of meat by placing it into a tub of water and measuring the amount of water that it displaces with the help of markings on the container. Since this procedure enables the butcher to determine the precise weight of the meat, it may not be performed on a Festival.

### Part 4
<b>And Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said: It is prohibited to make</b> a hole to serve as <b>a handle in meat</b> on a Festival, since this is a weekday act. <b>Ravina said: But it is permitted</b> to make such a handle <b>by hand,</b> rather than with a knife or some other implement, since this is an atypical manner of making a hole.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Huna said: It is permitted to make a sign on meat</b> even on a Festival, so that it not be mistaken for the meat of another person. This is <b>like that which Rabba bar Rav Huna</b> would do when he sent meat by means of a messenger to his house; he would <b>cut it into triangles</b> as a sign that the meat was his and it was fit to be eaten.

### Part 6
The Gemara relates an incident in connection to the basic <i>halakha</i> of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, would <b>weigh</b> one <b>portion against</b> another <b>portion on a Festival</b> in order to divide the meat between them. The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did they do so? This seems to be <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda nor in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> in the mishna. As, <b>if</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, didn’t he say: A person</b> may <b>weigh meat against a vessel or against a cleaver,</b> from which it may be inferred: <b>Against a vessel</b> or a cleaver, <b>yes,</b> one may do so; but <b>against anything else, no,</b> he may not. And <b>if</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, didn’t they say: One</b> may <b>not look at the pans of a scale at all?</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara explains: Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: One may weigh</b> one <b>portion against</b> another <b>portion on a Festival. Rav Yosef said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, since we learned</b> in a mishna <b>in</b> tractate <b><i>Bekhorot</i></b> (31a) <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion.

### Part 8
<b>As we learned</b> there: With regard to <b>consecrated animals that have become disqualified</b> because of a blemish, all <b>the benefit</b> that accrues <b>from their</b> sale belongs <b>to the</b> Temple treasury of <b>consecrated</b> property. <b>And one</b> may <b>weigh</b> one <b>portion</b> of meat <b>against</b> another <b>portion</b> of meat <b>in</b> the case of a <b>firstborn</b> that developed a blemish. Although the meat of a firstborn may not be sold by weight in the manner of non-sacred meat, one may weigh one portion against another portion in order to determine its price. This indicates that even in a case where it is prohibited to weigh an item in the ordinary manner, one may still weigh one portion of it against another portion.

### Part 9
<b>Abaye said to him: Perhaps that is not so,</b> and the two cases are not similar. It is possible that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua stated</b> his opinion that one may weigh one portion against another <b>only here,</b> on a Festival, <b>where</b> the action does <b>not</b> involve a show of <b>degradation of sacred</b> items; <b>but there,</b> in the case of a firstborn, <b>where</b> the weighing involves a display of <b>degradation of sacred</b> items, perhaps he did <b>not</b> permit weighing of any kind.

### Part 10
<b>Alternatively,</b> it is possible that <b>the Rabbis stated</b> their opinion that one may weigh one portion against another <b>only there,</b> in the case of a firstborn, <b>because it does not look like a weekday activity; but here,</b> on a Festival, <b>where it looks like a weekday activity,</b> perhaps they would <b>not</b> have permitted it. It is therefore possible that even the Rabbis would prohibit this action on a Festival.

### Part 11
With regard to the incident involving Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that they were particular with each other</b> with regard to such matters, to the extent that they had to weigh one portion against another so that their portions would be exactly equal? <b>But wasn’t</b> there the incident of <b>the seven fish that were brought to the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and five of them were</b> later <b>found in the house</b> of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who had taken them from Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi; <b>and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>was not particular</b> about this, as they treated each other like family?

### Part 12
<b>Rav Pappa said: Cast a person between them.</b> In other words, a third party must have been involved in the incident. How so? <b>Either</b> the two who divided the meat between themselves were <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, or</b> else they were <b>Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and bar Kappara.</b> Although these pairs of scholars were colleagues, they were exacting with each other in monetary matters. Consequently, they weighed one portion of meat against the other to ensure that they would each receive the same amount.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One</b> may <b>not sharpen a knife on a Festival</b> in the ordinary weekday manner. <b>However, one</b> may do so in an unusual fashion, e.g., to <b>run</b> one knife <b>over another,</b> thereby sharpening the blade.

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna said: They taught</b> that one may not sharpen a knife on a Festival <b>only</b> if he does so in the typical manner, <b>with a stone</b> knife <b>sharpener, but</b> if he does so <b>with a wooden</b> knife <b>sharpener, it is permitted,</b> as this is an unusual way of sharpening knives. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>that which you said,</b> that <b>a stone</b> sharpener <b>is prohibited, we said</b> this <b>only where</b> one’s intention is <b>to sharpen</b> the knife, <b>but</b> if he merely means <b>to remove the</b> accumulated <b>fat</b> by scraping it off with the stone, <b>it is permitted.</b> This proves <b>by inference that with</b> a sharpener made <b>of wood, even</b> if his intention is <b>to sharpen</b> the knife, <b>it is permitted.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Some teach</b> the statement of Rav Yehuda as referring <b>to the latter clause</b> of Rav Huna’s statement, where he says: But if he uses a sharpener made <b>of wood, it is permitted. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>that which you said,</b> that <b>with a wooden</b> sharpener it <b>is permitted, we said</b> this <b>only where</b> one’s intention is <b>to remove its fat, but</b> if he does so in order <b>to sharpen it, it is prohibited.</b> This proves <b>by inference that</b> with a sharpener made <b>of stone, even</b> if he intended merely <b>to remove its fat, it is prohibited.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Some teach</b> the statement of Rav Yehuda as referring <b>to the mishna</b> itself, which teaches: <b>One</b> may <b>not sharpen a knife on a Festival. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: They taught</b> that this is prohibited <b>only</b> where one’s intention is <b>to sharpen</b> the knife, <b>but</b> if his aim is merely <b>to remove its fat, it is permitted.</b> This proves <b>by inference that</b> running one knife <b>over another is permitted even</b> if his intention is <b>to sharpen</b> the knife.

### Part 17
<b>And some teach</b> the statement of Rav Yehuda as referring <b>to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which teaches: <b>However, one</b> may <b>run</b> one knife <b>over another. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> where one’s intention is <b>to remove its fat, but</b> if he does so <b>to sharpen it, it is prohibited.</b> This proves <b>by inference that with a sharpener, it is prohibited even to remove its fat.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who holds <b>that with a sharpener it is</b> entirely <b>prohibited? Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This <i>tanna</i> does <b>not</b> hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The</b> difference <b>between a Festival and Shabbat is only</b> with regard to the preparation of <b>food,</b> as it is permitted to perform labor for the purpose of food preparation on a Festival, but not on Shabbat; <b>Rabbi Yehuda permits even</b> actions that <b>facilitate preparation of food</b> on a Festival, e.g., repairing utensils with which food is prepared on the Festival.

### Part 19
<b>Rava said to Rav Ḥisda: We teach in your name</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. He said to him: May it be</b> God’s <b>will that you teach in my name all outstanding matters like this.</b> In other words, Rav Ḥisda was pleased that this teaching was attributed to him, as he too agreed with it.

### Part 20
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Neḥemya, son of Rav Yosef, said: I was</b> once <b>standing before Rava, and he was</b>
