### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The</b> aforementioned <b>pepper mill</b> is a composite vessel, and each of its parts must be considered independently with respect to ritual impurity. It <b>is susceptible to ritual impurity because of</b> each of the <b>three vessels</b> of which it is comprised: It is susceptible to impurity <b>because</b> it is a wooden <b>receptacle,</b> it is susceptible to impurity <b>because</b> it is <b>a metal vessel, and</b> it is susceptible to impurity <b>because</b> it is <b>a sieve.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A Sage <b>taught:</b> The <b>lower</b> section of the mill is susceptible to impurity <b>because</b> it is viewed as <b>a receptacle,</b> since the ground pepper descends into it. <b>The middle</b> section is susceptible to impurity <b>because</b> it is <b>a sieve,</b> as it serves to filter the pepper. Finally, the <b>upper</b> part, in which the pepper is actually ground, is susceptible to impurity <b>because</b> it is <b>a metal vessel.</b> Although it is not a receptacle, it is nevertheless susceptible to impurity, since it is made of metal.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A child’s wagon,</b> with which he plays and upon which he also sits, <b>is susceptible to ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading.</b> It is considered a fixed seat of the child, so that if the child is a <i>zav</i> and he sits on the wagon, it contracts the ritual impurity imparted by the treading of a <i>zav</i>. <b>And</b> this wagon <b>may be handled on Shabbat,</b> as it is considered a vessel. <b>And it may be dragged</b> on the ground on Shabbat <b>only upon cloth,</b> a stone pavement, or the like, as otherwise it would create a furrow when dragged, and one would be liable due to the prohibited labor of plowing.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> For this reason, <b>no vessels may be dragged</b> on the ground on Shabbat <b>except for a wagon,</b> which is permitted <b>because</b> its wheels do not make a furrow in the ground but merely <b>press</b> the earth down. Since no earth is moved from its place, this is not considered digging or plowing on Shabbat.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is taught in the mishna that <b>a child’s wagon is susceptible to ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>treading.</b> Why? It is <b>because he leans on it.</b> The mishna also teaches that this wagon <b>may be handled on Shabbat.</b> Why? It is <b>because it has the status of a vessel,</b> and one may handle a vessel on Shabbat.

### Part 6
The mishna further teaches that a child’s wagon <b>may be dragged</b> on Shabbat <b>only upon cloth.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>Upon cloth, yes,</b> it is permitted; but directly <b>on the ground, no,</b> it is not permitted. <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? It is <b>because he creates a furrow</b> in the ground when he drags the wagon across it. The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said: An unintentional act,</b> i.e., a permitted action from which an unintended prohibited labor ensues on Shabbat, <b>is prohibited,</b> even though the person performing it does not have the prohibited labor in mind.

### Part 7
<b>As, if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, didn’t he say: An unintentional act is permitted,</b> since there was no intention to perform the prohibited action? <b>As we learned</b> explicitly in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: A person may drag a bed, a chair, or a bench</b> on the ground, <b>provided that he does not intend to make a furrow.</b> Even if one forms a furrow unwittingly, he need one need not be concerned, as this was not his intention.

### Part 8
The Gemara raises a difficulty: If so, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna as follows: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: No vessels may be dragged</b> on the ground <b>on Shabbat except for a wagon, because it</b> merely <b>presses</b> the earth down. This is not prohibited as plowing because it does not create a furrow. This indicates that a wagon may be dragged on the ground on Shabbat <b>because, yes, it presses</b> the earth down, <b>but it does not make a furrow.</b> Since it has already been established that the first section of the mishna is also in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, and there it appears that a wagon dragged along the ground makes a furrow, Rabbi Yehuda seems to contradict himself.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: It must be explained that this is a dispute between <b>two <i>tanna’im</i></b> who hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> but differ with regard to the content of that opinion. The first <i>tanna</i> holds that even a wagon makes a furrow, whereas the other <i>tanna</i> maintains in the name of Rabbi Yehuda that a wagon does not make a furrow.
