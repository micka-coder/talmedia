### Part 1
However, placing them <b>on</b> a scalding fragment of <b>earthenware is permitted,</b> as there is no concern of extinguishing or kindling.

### Part 2
<b>And Rabba said:</b> Placing the spices <b>on</b> a hot piece of <b>earthenware is also prohibited, because it produces</b> a new <b>scent</b> in the earthenware, and one may not create new things on a Festival. The Gemara notes that similarly, <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both said</b> the following: <b>It is prohibited to overturn a cup</b> containing perfume <b>onto silk garments on a Festival. What is the reason</b> for this prohibition? It is <b>because it produces</b> a new <b>scent</b> in the garment.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the case discussed in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may press</b> a piece of aromatic wood between his fingers <b>and smell it, and one may</b> also <b>snip off</b> a piece of it in order to release its fragrance <b>and smell it?</b> In those cases too he produces a scent. The Gemara answers: <b>There, the scent exists in any case, and he</b> merely <b>adds to the fragrance,</b> as his pressing or snipping causes the smell to be stronger. <b>Here,</b> on the other hand, where he overturns a cup of perfume on clothing, <b>he produces</b> a new <b>scent. Rava,</b> however, <b>said:</b> It is <b>even permitted</b> to sprinkle the aromatic spices <b>on</b> the <b>coals</b> themselves, <b>just as it is</b> permitted to place <b>meat on coals</b> for roasting.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Geviha from Bei Katil</b> once <b>taught at the entrance to the house of the Exilarch</b> that <b><i>ketura</i> is permitted</b> on a Festival; but he did not add any further clarification. <b>Ameimar said to him: What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>ketura</i>? If</b> it means <b>tying</b> [<b><i>ketura</i></b>] ornamental knots <b>by hand,</b> this is the <b>act of a craftsman</b> and is therefore certainly prohibited on a Festival. <b>And</b> if it is referring <b>to burning</b> incense [<i>ketoret</i>], this too is <b>prohibited, as he extinguishes</b> some of the coals when he sprinkles the aromatic powder on them. <b>Rav Ashi said to him: Actually,</b> it is referring <b>to burning</b> incense, which is permitted, <b>just as it is</b> permitted to place <b>meat on coals</b> for roasting.

### Part 5
<b>Some say</b> a slightly different version of this story, in which <b>Ameimar said to</b> Rav Geviha: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>ketura</i>? If</b> it means <b>tying</b> ornamental knots <b>by hand,</b> this is <b>the act of a craftsman,</b> which is prohibited. <b>If</b> it is referring <b>to burning</b> incense, this too is prohibited, <b>as he produces a</b> new <b>scent. Rav Ashi said: I said</b> this <i>halakha</i> to Rav Geviha, <b>and I said</b> it <b>in the name of a great man,</b> Rava, that <b>actually</b> it is referring <b>to burning</b> incense, which is permitted, <b>just as it is</b> permitted to place <b>meat on coals</b> for roasting.

### Part 6
§ It is taught in the mishna that one of Rabban Gamliel’s three leniencies was that <b>one may prepare a whole [<i>mekulas</i>] kid</b> goat, meaning a goat roasted whole, with its entrails over its head, on the night of Passover. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in this regard that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Theodosius [<i>Todos</i>] of Rome,</b> leader of the Jewish community there, <b>instituted the custom for the Roman</b> Jews <b>to eat whole kids on the night of Passover,</b> in commemoration of the practice followed in the Temple. The Sages <b>sent</b> a message <b>to him: Were you not Theodosius,</b> an important person, <b>we would have decreed ostracism upon you, as you are feeding the Jewish people consecrated</b> food, which may be eaten only in and around the Temple itself, <b>outside</b> the Temple.

### Part 7
The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>Can it enter your mind</b> that the Sages really meant that Theodosius was feeding the Jewish people <b>consecrated</b> food outside the Temple? These goats are certainly not consecrated animals. <b>Rather, say</b> that he was feeding the Jewish people something <b>similar to consecrated</b> food, which people might mistake for a Paschal offering.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <b>three things</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya permits and the Rabbis prohibit: His cow</b> would <b>go out</b> on Shabbat <b>with</b> a decorative <b>strap between its horns.</b> Rabbi Elazar holds that such a strap is considered an ornament for the cow rather than a burden, whereas the Sages view it as a burden.

### Part 9
<b>And one may comb [<i>mekardin</i>] an animal</b> with a fine comb <b>on a Festival</b> in order to remove ticks and dirt from its hair; the Rabbis prohibit this due to a concern that he might thereby come to wound or bruise the animal. <b>And one may grind pepper</b> needed on the Festival even <b>in its</b> own <b>mill,</b> although this appears similar to a weekday labor.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not comb an animal</b> to remove ticks and dirt from its hair <b>on a Festival because</b> this certainly <b>creates a wound, but one may brush</b> it with a wooden comb, as its blunt teeth do not wound the animal. <b>But the Rabbis say: One may not comb, nor may one even brush.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya’s cow would go out on Shabbat with a strap between its horns, the Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya had</b> only <b>one cow? But didn’t Rav say, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya would tithe from his herds thirteen thousand calves each and every year,</b> which means that he had ten times that number of calves alone. Why, then, does the mishna speak of his cow? The Gemara answers that <b>it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: This cow <b>was not his; rather, it was his neighbor’s. And because he did not protest her</b> conduct and tell her that it is prohibited to do so, the cow <b>was called by his name</b> to his discredit, as if it were his.

### Part 12
§ It is taught in the mishna that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya holds that <b>one may comb an animal on a Festival. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> considered <b>combing and what is brushing? Combing</b> is performed with <b>a small</b>-toothed comb <b>and makes a wound; brushing</b> is done with <b>a large</b>-toothed comb <b>and does not make a wound.</b>

### Part 13
<b>And there are three disputes with regard to</b> this <b>matter. Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>an unintentional act,</b> a permitted action from which an unintended prohibited labor ensues on Shabbat, <b>is prohibited,</b> as in his opinion it is prohibited to perform an action that involves a prohibited labor on Shabbat even if one has a permitted action in mind and does not intend to perform the labor in question. Therefore, one may not comb an animal in a manner that will cause a wound, even unintentionally. <b>However,</b> he differentiates between the cases: Although he prohibits <b>combing</b> with <b>a small</b>-toothed comb that <b>makes a wound,</b> he permits <b>brushing</b> with <b>a large</b>-toothed comb that <b>does not make a wound, and we do not issue a decree</b> and prohibit <b>brushing due to combing,</b> as there is no concern that people will err and come to permit even combing in the prohibited manner.

### Part 14
<b>And the Rabbis also hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard to the fundamental issue that <b>an unintentional act is prohibited.</b> However, they maintain that <b>we issue a decree</b> and prohibit <b>brushing due to combing.</b> On the other hand, <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya holds in accordance with</b> the dissenting opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who said</b> that <b>an unintentional act is permitted.</b> Therefore, <b>both combing and brushing are permitted,</b> as even if the combing or brushing bruises the animal, there is no transgression of a prohibition, as there was certainly no intention to cause the animal a wound.

### Part 15
<b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> this teaching <b>himself:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> that an unintentional act is permitted on Shabbat, <b>as Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya agrees with him. Rava said to Rav Naḥman: And let the Master say</b> the opposite, that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as the Rabbis agree with him.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> Fundamentally <b>I hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon;</b> I am merely adding <b>another</b> reason for doing so, which is <b>that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya agrees with him.</b>
