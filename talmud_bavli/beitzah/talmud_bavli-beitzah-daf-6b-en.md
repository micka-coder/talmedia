### Part 1
<b>Now,</b> we know that food <b>prepared,</b> i.e., fit, <b>for human</b> consumption that became spoiled <b>is not</b> automatically considered <b>prepared for dogs, as we learned</b> in a mishna (see 2a): <b>One may cut pumpkins before an animal</b> to facilitate their consumption, <b>and</b> likewise one may cut up an <b>animal carcass,</b> even of an animal that died on Shabbat, <b>before dogs. Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> the animal <b>was not</b> already <b>a carcass,</b> i.e., it was not dead and fit for dogs, <b>prior to Shabbat, it is prohibited, because it is not in the</b> category of items considered <b>prepared</b> for use on Shabbat. This shows that although this animal was fit for human consumption while alive, it does not automatically become prepared for dogs once it dies. If so, can food <b>prepared for dogs</b> be considered <b>prepared for humans?</b>

### Part 2
<b>He said to him: Yes.</b> It is not surprising that something <b>prepared</b> and fit <b>for humans is not</b> considered fit and <b>prepared for dogs, as that which is fit for a person, one does not throw it to dogs,</b> and he has therefore removed that animal from his mind. However, something <b>that is prepared for dogs</b> is also considered fit and <b>prepared for humans, as a person’s mind is on anything fit to</b> be eaten by <b>him.</b> One does not completely remove from his mind even food meant for dogs, if it is kosher and edible. Consequently, one has in mind the possibility that he might eat the calf of a cow that is a <i>tereifa</i> once it is born, since at that point it will be kosher and edible.

### Part 3
With regard to the dispute itself, the Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav; and it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, and some say</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara elaborates: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav: A calf born on a Festival is permitted; a chick born on a Festival is prohibited. And what is the difference between this</b> case <b>and that one? This one,</b> the calf, <b>is prepared on account of its mother by slaughter; and that one,</b> the chick, <b>is not prepared on account of its mother.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara further explains: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, and some say</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan: A calf born on a Festival is permitted, and a chick born on a Festival is</b> likewise <b>permitted. What is the reason? This one,</b> the calf, <b>is prepared on account of its mother; and that one,</b> the chick, <b>is itself rendered permitted through slaughter.</b>

### Part 6
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A chick born on a Festival is prohibited. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Even on a weekday,</b> the chick <b>is prohibited</b> on the day it hatched <b>because its eyes have not</b> yet <b>opened.</b> A small chick of this kind is not yet considered a bird fit for consumption; rather, it is similar to a creeping animal.

### Part 7
The Gemara comments: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which is taught:</b> The verse that states: <b>“Even all creeping animals that creep upon the earth,</b> you shall not eat them, for they are a detestable thing” (Leviticus 11:42) comes <b>to include</b> in the list of prohibited creeping animals even <b>chicks that have not</b> yet <b>opened their eyes. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b>

### Part 8
§ <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: An egg is fully</b> formed <b>upon its emergence;</b> i.e., it is not considered an egg until it is laid. The Gemara inquires: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the statement: An egg <b>is fully formed upon its emergence?</b> To which issue is Rava referring? <b>If we say</b> he meant an egg <b>is fully formed</b> and called an egg only <b>upon its emergence, and</b> at this stage <b>it is permitted to eat it with milk,</b> this indicates that while an egg is still <b>inside its mother,</b> even if it is fully formed, it is considered meat and it is <b>prohibited to eat it with milk. But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who slaughters a chicken and finds fully</b> formed <b>eggs inside it, it is permitted to eat them with milk?</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> Rav’s statement should be explained as follows: An egg <b>is fully formed upon its emergence</b> in that it is <b>permitted to eat it on a Festival</b> only if the entire egg emerged on a weekday. The Gemara expresses surprise at this claim: This indicates that if an egg is found <b>inside its mother, it is prohibited to eat it on a Festival. But isn’t it taught:</b> With regard to <b>one who slaughters a chicken and finds fully</b> formed <b>eggs inside it, it is permitted to eat them on a Festival?</b>

### Part 10
<b>And if you say: The <i>baraita</i> teaches us that which the mishna did not</b> explicitly <b>teach us,</b> and Rav stated the <i>halakha</i> accordingly; however, <b>this we</b> already <b>learned</b> in the mishna here, as it says in the mishna: With regard to <b>an egg laid on a Festival, Beit Shammai say it may be eaten, and Beit Hillel say it may not be eaten. And Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree only with regard to</b> an egg that was already <b>laid, but</b> concerning eggs <b>inside their mothers, all agree</b> that they <b>are permitted.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And if you say</b> that the mishna should be explained in the opposite manner, as <b>Beit Hillel also prohibit</b> eggs <b>inside their mothers, and</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches: Laid,</b> is <b>to convey the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> that <b>they permit even</b> an egg that <b>was laid. However,</b> consider <b>that which is taught</b> in the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who slaughters a chicken and finds inside it fully formed eggs, it is permitted to eat them on a Festival.</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? It is the opinion <b>neither</b> of <b>Beit Shammai nor</b> of <b>Beit Hillel.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rather,</b> Rav certainly did not prohibit an egg that has not yet been laid. Instead, his statement should be explained as follows: An egg <b>is fully formed upon its emergence, and it produces chicks,</b> i.e., an egg laid in the regular manner can be incubated and a chick will hatch from it. By contrast, an egg that remained <b>inside its mother cannot produce chicks.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the practical</b> halakhic <b>difference</b> of this observation? The Gemara answers: It is relevant <b>for buying and selling.</b> In other words, the difference between the types of eggs has ramifications for terms of commerce. This is <b>like</b> that incident involving <b>a certain</b> individual <b>who</b> would <b>say to</b> the general public: <b>Eggs</b>
