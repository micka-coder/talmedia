### Part 1
One <b>Sage,</b> Beit Shammai, <b>holds</b> that <b>we issue a decree</b> and prohibit <b>a hinge in the middle due to a hinge on the side; and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Beit Hillel, <b>holds</b> that <b>we do not issue</b> this <b>decree.</b> Since placing a hinge of this type does not constitute the prohibited labor of building, it is permitted.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: One may carry out</b> on a Festival <b>neither a minor</b> child, <b>nor a <i>lulav</i>, nor a Torah Scroll into the public domain,</b> as none of these are required for the preparation of food; <b>and Beit Hillel permit</b> it.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The <i>tanna</i></b> who reviews <i>mishnayot</i> <b>teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi: One who slaughters a gift offering on a Festival is flogged</b> for transgressing the prohibition: “No manner of work shall be done on them” (Exodus 12:16). Since this slaughtering was not performed for the purpose of eating, the action constitutes a prohibited labor on a Festival.

### Part 4
Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi <b>said to</b> that <i>tanna</i>: <b>Who</b> could have <b>said</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>to you? It is</b> evidently in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, who say</b> that <b>we do not say: Since carrying out was permitted</b> on a Festival <b>for the purpose</b> of food preparation, it <b>was also permitted not for that purpose. For if you say</b> the <i>baraita</i> is accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, they say: Since carrying out was permitted for the requirements</b> of food preparation, <b>it was also permitted not for</b> these <b>requirements. Here, too,</b> with regard to the prohibited labor of slaughtering, <b>since slaughter was permitted for the requirements</b> of food preparation, <b>it was also permitted not for</b> these <b>requirements.</b> It was permitted for any purpose that benefits people, whether directly or indirectly.

### Part 5
<b>Rabba strongly objects to this</b> reasoning: <b>From where</b> do you infer <b>that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree over this</b> issue? <b>Perhaps they disagree</b> about the following: The <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i> and</b> the prohibition against <b>carrying out</b> apply <b>to Shabbat,</b> but <b>there are no</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i> nor</b> a prohibition against <b>carrying out</b> on a Festival.

### Part 6
The Gemara clarifies the dispute according to this explanation: One <b>Sage,</b> Beit Shammai, <b>holds</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i></b> and the prohibition against <b>carrying out</b> apply <b>to Shabbat, and</b> similarly the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i></b> and <b>carrying out</b> apply <b>to a Festival.</b> The only difference is that, on a Festival, carrying, like other types of prohibited labor, is permitted for the sake of food preparation.

### Part 7
<b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Beit Hillel, <b>holds</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i></b> and the prohibition against <b>carrying out</b> apply <b>to Shabbat,</b> but <b>there are no</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i></b> nor a prohibition against <b>carrying out on a Festival, as it is written: “Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the Shabbat day”</b> (Jeremiah 17:22), from which Beit Hillel inferred: <b>On Shabbat, yes,</b> carrying from one domain to another is indeed prohibited; <b>on a Festival, no,</b> it is not prohibited. According to this explanation, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about whether a prohibited labor that is permitted for the purpose of food preparation on a Festival is also permitted when it does not serve that purpose.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Yosef strongly objects to this</b> explanation of Rabba: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> that the dispute is whether the prohibition against carrying out applies on a Festival, Beit Hillel should permit one to move <i>muktze</i> objects, as the prohibition of handling <i>muktze</i> is an extension of the prohibition against carrying out. Consequently, <b>let them differ with regard to</b> whether or not it is permitted to carry out <b>stones</b> on a Festival. <b>Rather, from</b> the fact that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>do not disagree with regard to stones</b> but concerning objects that serve some sort of purpose, <b>conclude from this:</b> Everyone agrees that carrying out is prohibited on a Festival, and the Torah permitted it only when it is necessary for sustenance.

### Part 9
Instead, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>disagree with regard to carrying out</b> that is <b>not for the purpose</b> of food preparation. According to the opinion of Beit Hillel, since carrying out is permitted for the sake of sustenance, it is entirely permitted. According to Beit Shammai, the Sages permitted only labor that serves the purpose of food preparation.

### Part 10
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan also holds</b> that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>disagree with regard to</b> the principle: <b>Since carrying out is permitted</b> on a Festival <b>for the purpose</b> of food preparation, it <b>was also permitted not for</b> this <b>purpose,</b> as <b>the <i>tanna</i> teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan: One who cooks the sciatic nerve in milk on a Festival and eats it is flogged</b> for violating <b>five</b> distinct prohibitions.

### Part 11
How so? (1) <b>He is flogged due to</b> the prohibition of <b>cooking</b> the sciatic <b>nerve,</b> which is prohibited because the sciatic nerve is unfit for consumption; (2) <b>and he is flogged due to</b> the prohibition of <b>eating</b> the sciatic <b>nerve,</b> which is explicitly prohibited by the Torah; (3) <b>and he is flogged due to</b> the prohibition of <b>cooking meat in milk;</b> (4) <b>and he is flogged due to</b> the prohibition of <b>eating meat</b> cooked <b>in milk;</b> (5) <b>and</b> lastly, <b>he is flogged</b>
