### Part 1
It is <b>a decree lest</b> one <b>climb</b> the tree <b>and pick</b> the fruit, as this would constitute the prohibited labor of harvesting. If so, the prohibition against eating fruit <b>is itself</b> due to <b>a decree. And will we arise and issue a decree to</b> prevent violation of another <b>decree?</b> Rav Yosef responded: That is not so; rather, when the Sages issued the initial decree, they enacted the prohibitions against both fruit that fall and a laid egg, as <b>all</b> the prohibitions <b>are</b> components of <b>one decree.</b> In other words, the similar cases of the fruit and the egg were both included in the original decree.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> a different reason: An egg that was laid on a Festival is prohibited as <b>a decree due to liquids that seeped</b> from the fruit (<i>Eiruvin</i> 39b), which is prohibited on that day. The legal status of an egg that was laid on a Festival is like that of liquids that seeped from a fruit on a Festival.

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> With regard to <b>liquid that seeped</b> from fruit, <b>what is the reason</b> that the Sages prohibited it? It is <b>a decree lest one</b> purposely <b>squeeze</b> the fruit, and thereby perform the prohibited labor of threshing. However, the prohibition against consuming this juice <b>is itself</b> a rabbinic <b>decree. And will we arise and issue a decree to</b> prevent violation of another <b>decree?</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak replied: <b>All</b> the prohibitions <b>are</b> components of <b>one decree.</b> When the Sages prohibited this juice, they banned the eating of an egg laid on a Festival for the same reason, as the actions are similar.

### Part 4
As various explanations have been offered for this mishna, the Gemara seeks to clarify why each Sage was dissatisfied with the other explanations and suggested an alternative. The Gemara says: <b>All of them,</b> Rabba, Rav Yosef, and Rabbi Yitzḥak, <b>did not state</b> their explanations <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman, as</b> stated in <b>our</b> previously stated <b>objection</b> to Rav Naḥman’s explanation. The other Sages <b>also did not state</b> their explanations <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba,</b> as they <b>do not</b> accept that there is a Torah prohibition of using items whose <b>preparation</b> was from Shabbat to a Festival or from a Festival to Shabbat.

### Part 5
<b>However,</b> the following question arises: Since <b>Rav Yosef</b> provides an explanation that is similar to that of Rabbi Yitzḥak, <b>what is the reason</b> that he <b>did not state</b> his explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak?</b> The Gemara answers that Rav Yosef could have <b>said to you: An egg is food, and fruit is food,</b> i.e., an egg is comparable to fruits that fall. This observation would serve <b>to exclude juice, which is not food</b> but drink. Consequently, an egg is not comparable to juice and would not be included in the same decree.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks the reverse question: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, what is the reason</b> that he <b>did not state</b> his explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef?</b> The Gemara answers: He could have <b>said to you</b> that the case of an egg is more similar to juices that seep from fruit. How so? <b>An egg is enclosed</b> inside a chicken before it is laid, and likewise <b>juice is enclosed</b> inside the fruit. This observation serves <b>to exclude fruits</b> that fall from a tree, <b>which are standing exposed</b> on the tree. Therefore, the comparison between fruits that fall and an egg is weaker than the comparison between liquid that seeped from fruit and an egg.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara notes: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan also holds</b> that the prohibition against eating an egg laid on a Festival is <b>a decree due to liquid that seeped</b> from fruit. What proof can be cited for this? It is proven <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan raised a contradiction</b> between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> and a different statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, and he resolved</b> the apparent contradiction in a manner that indicates his own opinion.

### Part 8
The Gemara elaborates on the previous statement. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 143b): <b>One may not squeeze fruits to extract liquids from them</b> on Shabbat, <b>and if</b> the liquids <b>seeped out on their own, it is prohibited</b> to use them on Shabbat, lest he come to squeeze fruits intentionally. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> the fruit is designated <b>for eating,</b> e.g., apples, the liquid <b>that seeps from them is permitted.</b> Since there is no concern that one might squeeze the fruit, there is no reason to prohibit its liquid. <b>And if</b> the fruit was originally designated <b>for liquids,</b> such as grapes for wine, there are grounds for concern that one might squeeze them, and therefore the liquid <b>that seeps from them is prohibited.</b>

### Part 9
From the fact that Rabbi Yehuda said that liquid from fruit intended for eating is permitted, one can infer that, <b>apparently, all food</b> that comes out of another food <b>is</b> classified as <b>food that was separated, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Food that was separated is not considered a new food, but part of the food that previously existed.

### Part 10
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> against this from a different source: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda said further,</b> concerning untithed fruit, which may not be rendered fit to be eaten on a Festival by separating <i>teruma</i> and tithes from it (<i>Eiruvin</i> 39a): <b>A person may stipulate a condition with regard to a basket of</b> untithed <b>fruit on the first day of a Festival,</b> and say: If today is the true Festival day, the second Festival day is actually a weekday. Therefore, this fruit is permitted, once I separate tithes from it, as on any other weekday. And vice versa: If today is, in fact, a weekday, and tomorrow is the Festival, I hereby separate its tithes today.

### Part 11
Likewise, on the following day, he should again stipulate: If today is a weekday and yesterday was holy, I hereby separate tithes from the fruit now; if today is holy and yesterday was a weekday, separating the tithes yesterday was sufficient. <b>And he</b> may then <b>eat</b> the produce <b>on</b> the <b>second</b> Festival day, as in either case no prohibition is involved. <b>And similarly, an egg laid on</b> the <b>first</b> Festival day may <b>be eaten on</b> the <b>second</b> day, regardless of which day is the actual Festival.

### Part 12
Rabbi Yehuda’s statement indicates that <b>on the second</b> day, <b>yes,</b> it is permitted to partake of the egg; but if the egg was laid <b>on the first</b> day, <b>no,</b> one may not eat it. If so, Rabbi Yehuda apparently contradicts himself, as he said previously that liquid from food prepared for eating has the same status as the food itself, and that its emergence is considered to be nothing more than the separation of two foods from each other. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan resolves</b> the difficulty: <b>The</b> attribution of the <b>opinions</b> with regard to the second day of the Festival <b>is reversed</b> (<i>Berakhot</i> 17b), so that Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion corresponds with his ruling above.

### Part 13
The significance of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement for the issue at hand is as follows: <b>Since</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised a contradiction between</b> the cases of an egg and liquid that oozed, one may <b>conclude from this that it is the same reason</b> in both cases, i.e., an egg is prohibited on a Festival due to the rabbinic decree against liquid that oozed from fruit.
