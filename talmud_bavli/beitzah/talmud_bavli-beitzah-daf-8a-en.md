### Part 1
Here it is referring <b>to loose earth</b> that does not require further crushing.

### Part 2
The Gemara challenges this: <b>But</b> even in the case of loose earth, <b>one makes a hole</b> by the very act of removing the earth or the shovel from that place. The Gemara answers: This ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abba, as Rabbi Abba said: One who digs a hole on Shabbat,</b> but he <b>needs only its earth</b> and has no interest in forming a pit, <b>is exempt for</b> that act. Since he has no interest in the hole, he is considered to have performed a destructive act, and the <i>halakha</i> is that one who commits a destructive act is not liable for the performance of prohibited labor on Shabbat and Festivals.

### Part 3
ยง The mishna states: <b>That the ashes of a stove are prepared.</b> The Gemara express puzzlement at this statement: <b>The ashes of a stove, who mentioned anything about it?</b> Why does the mishna suddenly speak about the ashes of a stove when it had not previously discussed or even mentioned them? <b>Rabba said: This is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>said: And the ashes of a stove are prepared.</b> In other words, everyone agrees that in addition to prepared earth, the ashes of a stove are also considered prepared, and one may cover the blood with them. It is not necessary to prepare these ashes especially for this purpose the day before.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: They only taught</b> that the ashes of a stove are considered prepared if the stove <b>was ignited on the Festival eve,</b> so that the ashes had already formed at the start of the Festival. <b>However,</b> if <b>it was ignited on the Festival</b> itself, the ashes are <b>prohibited. And if</b> the ashes are still hot and <b>fit to roast an egg in them,</b> they are not considered <i>muktze</i>, and therefore it is <b>permitted</b> to use them for covering as well.

### Part 5
The Gemara comments: <b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When they said</b> that <b>the ashes of a stove are prepared, they said</b> so <b>only when it was ignited on the Festival eve; however,</b> if <b>it was ignited on the Festival,</b> they are <b>prohibited. And if</b> the ashes are still hot and <b>fit to roast an egg in them,</b> they are <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara further states: If before the Festival <b>one brought earth into his garden or his ruin</b> to use for various needs, <b>it is permitted to cover</b> blood <b>with it. And Rav Yehuda</b> likewise <b>said: A person may bring in a basketful of earth</b> the day before the Festival <b>and use</b> both the basket and the earth it contains <b>for all his needs</b> on the Festival.

### Part 7
With regard to this case, <b>Mar Zutra</b> added and <b>taught</b> in public <b>in the name of Mar Zutra the Great</b> that the application of this <i>halakha</i> is limited: <b>And that is</b> the case only <b>if one designated a corner for this</b> earth, thereby demonstrating that he intends to use it for all his requirements, rather than merely bringing earth in to scatter over the floor of the house. In that case, the dirt is nullified. It is considered part of the floor, which means that it is once again classified as <i>muktze</i>.

### Part 8
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against this from a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 4:9): In the case of <b>a <i>koy</i>,</b> a kosher animal with characteristics of both domesticated and non-domesticated animals, <b>one may not slaughter it on a Festival,</b> as it is uncertain whether or not its blood requires covering. <b>And if one did slaughter it, he may not cover its blood. And if it is so,</b> that one may use his basket of earth as he wishes, as claimed by Rav Yehuda, even if a <i>koy</i> is definitely a domesticated animal, <b>let him cover it, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara expresses surprise at this objection: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> one could equally suggest: <b>Let him cover</b> the blood of the <i>koy</i> <b>with ashes of a stove or with</b> earth dug up with <b>an embedded shovel. Rather,</b> this mishna must be referring to a situation <b>where one does not have</b> prepared earth to use for covering the blood; <b>here too,</b> one can say <b>that he does not have</b> a basket of earth ready for all his needs.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if the mishna is referring to a situation where one does not have prepared earth, <b>why</b> discuss <b>specifically</b> the case of a <i>koy</i>, where there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether there is a mitzva to cover its blood? <b>Even</b> in the case of an undomesticated animal, whose blood must <b>certainly</b> be covered, slaughter should <b>also not</b> be permitted, as the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel that one may not slaughter if he does not have prepared earth.

### Part 11
The Gemara explains that this <i>baraita</i> <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> as follows: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>definite</b> undomesticated animals and birds, <b>that</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted <b>to slaughter</b> them; <b>however,</b> with regard to <b>an uncertainty,</b> one might <b>say: Due to the joy of the Festival let one slaughter</b> it <b>and not cover</b> its blood, as there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether there is a mitzva to cover its blood, and therefore it is overridden by the mitzva to rejoice on a Festival. The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that one should not slaughter it <i>ab initio</i> if he does not have something prepared with which to cover the blood.
