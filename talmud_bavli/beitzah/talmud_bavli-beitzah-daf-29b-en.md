### Part 1
it is reasonable to conclude that <b>Shmuel came to teach us the practical <i>halakha</i>.</b> Knowing that a <i>baraita</i> permits the practice, Shmuel found it necessary to state that the <i>halakha</i> is otherwise.

### Part 2
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> may <b>not</b> sift <b>flour a second time on a Festival,</b> as this involves unnecessary extra effort. <b>They said in the name of Rabbi Papeyyas and Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira: One</b> may sift flour <b>a second time. However, they</b> all <b>agree that if a pebble or a wood chip fell into</b> the flour after it had been sifted the previous day, one may sift it <b>a second time</b> in order to remove the items.

### Part 3
<b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Ravina: One</b> may <b>not</b> sift <b>flour a second time on a Festival, but</b> if <b>a pebble or a wood chip fell</b> into the flour after the first sifting, <b>he</b> may <b>remove it with his hand.</b> Ravina <b>said to him: All the more so</b> is the latter procedure <b>prohibited, as it is similar to</b> the prohibited labor of <b>selecting.</b> It is therefore preferable to sift the flour with a sieve, and the unwanted items will thereby be removed.

### Part 4
<b>Rava bar Rav Huna the Short taught at the entrance to Neharde’a: One</b> may sift <b>flour a second time on a Festival. Rav Naḥman said to</b> the students standing before him: <b>Go out and say to Abba,</b> i.e., to Rava bar Rav Huna, as Rava is a shortened form of Rav Abba: <b>Your good has been removed and cast upon thorns,</b> meaning that your teachings are not needed. <b>Go out and see how many sieves circulate in Neharde’a,</b> as all the women already know that this is permitted.

### Part 5
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Yosef’s wife was</b> once <b>sifting flour</b> in an unusual manner <b>on the reverse</b> side <b>of a sieve. He said to her: Look, I want good-quality bread,</b> hinting that she need not invert the sieve but may sift the flour in her regular fashion. The Gemara likewise relates that <b>Rav Ashi’s wife was</b> once <b>sifting flour onto a table,</b> rather than into a bowl in the usual manner. <b>Rav Ashi said: This</b> one <b>of ours,</b> my wife, is <b>the daughter of Rami bar Ḥama, and Rami bar Ḥama is a master of</b> good <b>deeds</b> who is meticulous in his performance of mitzvot. <b>Had</b> my wife <b>not observed</b> this practice <b>in her father’s house, she would not have acted</b> in this manner. Therefore, one can learn the <i>halakha</i> in practice from her actions.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person</b> may <b>go</b> on a Festival <b>to a grocer</b> from <b>whom he is accustomed</b> to buy <b>and say to him: Give me eggs and nuts of</b> such-and-such <b>a number, as it is the manner of a homeowner to count</b> this way <b>in his</b> own <b>house.</b> Counting eggs or nuts is not considered a commercial activity, as people regularly mention the number of eggs and nuts that they need.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>A person</b> may <b>go</b> on a Festival <b>to a shepherd</b> with <b>whom he is accustomed</b> to deal <b>and say to him: Give me one kid, or one lamb.</b> Similarly, one may go on a Festival <b>to a butcher</b> from <b>whom he is accustomed</b> to buy <b>and say to him: Give me one foreleg</b> of an animal, <b>or one thigh.</b> Likewise, one may approach <b>one who deals in fattened</b> fowl from <b>whom he is accustomed</b> to buy <b>and say to him: Give me one dove or one pigeon.</b> He may also visit <b>a baker</b> from <b>whom he is accustomed</b> to buy <b>and say to him: Give me one loaf or one cake [<i>geluska</i>].</b>

### Part 8
<b>And</b> one may go on a Festival <b>to a grocer</b> from <b>whom he is accustomed</b> to buy <b>and say to him: Give me twenty eggs, or fifty nuts,</b> or <b>ten peaches, or five pomegranates, or one <i>etrog</i>, provided that he does not mention any measure.</b> In other words, he must not specify a unit of measurement, e.g., a <i>kav</i>; rather, he must state a number, which is not the usual manner of making a purchase. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> This is permitted, <b>provided that he does not mention the amount of</b> the <b>purchase,</b> meaning that he must not mention the sum of money that he is spending, but rather he must take what he needs and after the Festival they will calculate how much he owes.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who brings wine jugs from</b> one <b>place to</b> another <b>place may not bring</b> a large number of <b>them in a basket or in a tub</b> in the usual weekday manner on a Festival, as this is disrespectful of the Festival; <b>but he may bring</b> one or two barrels <b>on his shoulder or</b> carry them <b>in front of himself. Similarly, one who brings straw</b> for kindling or for feeding animals <b>may not place the tub behind him</b> while carrying it, as this is the usual weekday manner; <b>but he may transport it</b> in front of him <b>in his hand,</b> in an unusual fashion. <b>And one may begin</b> taking straw for kindling
