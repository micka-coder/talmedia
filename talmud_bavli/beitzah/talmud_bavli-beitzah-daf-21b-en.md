### Part 1
indicating <b>for you, but not for dogs;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> When the verse states “every soul,” it comes to teach that <b>even the soul of an animal is included. If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “for you”?</b> It means <b>for you, but not for gentiles.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you <b>to include dogs</b> among those on whose behalf one is permitted to perform a labor on a Festival, <b>and to exclude gentiles?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>I include dogs because</b> the responsibility for <b>their sustenance is</b> incumbent <b>upon you,</b> as one is obligated to feed the animals in his possession; <b>and I exclude gentiles because</b> the responsibility for <b>their sustenance is not</b> incumbent <b>upon you.</b>

### Part 3
With regard to this <i>baraita</i>, <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: And according to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who said</b> that the verse indicates: <b>“For you,” but not for dogs, how</b> are <b>we</b> permitted to <b>cast date stones to animals on a Festival?</b> Since date stones are not fit for human consumption, they should be considered <i>muktze</i>, and therefore it should be prohibited to handle them.

### Part 4
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Since they are fit for fuel,</b> they may be handled, and therefore they may also be given to animals. Abaye objected: This works out <b>well in</b> the case of <b>dry</b> date stones; but <b>in</b> the case of <b>moist ones,</b> which are not suited for fuel, <b>what is there to say? He said to him: They are fit for a large fire,</b> which dries them out, after which they burn well.

### Part 5
Abaye raised another objection: This works out <b>well in</b> the case of <b>a Festival,</b> when it is permitted to fuel a fire, but <b>in</b> the case of <b>Shabbat, what is there to say?</b> Why should one be permitted to handle date stones on Shabbat? Rav Yosef answered: <b>We carry them along with bread.</b> We place the date stones upon a loaf of bread and move them together with it. This is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Shmuel, as Shmuel said: A person may perform all his needs with bread;</b> as long as the bread remains edible, he need not be concerned that he is treating the bread contemptuously.

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> the ruling of Rav Huna that one is permitted to bake for gentiles on a Festival if they allow a Jew to eat of the bread <b>differs from</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One may invite a gentile</b> for a meal <b>on Shabbat,</b> as he will certainly not cook for him on Shabbat, and it is permitted to give a gentile food that was prepared the day before. <b>But one may not invite a gentile</b> for a meal <b>on a Festival;</b> this is prohibited as <b>a preventive measure lest he</b> come to cook <b>more for</b> the gentile’s <b>sake.</b> This indicates that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi holds that one may not prepare more for a gentile, even if the meal is primarily meant for Jews.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: Even on Shabbat as well,</b> one may <b>not</b> invite a gentile for a meal <b>due to the</b> wine <b>remnants in the cups.</b> Once a gentile has drunk wine from a cup, whatever remains in the cup may not be used and is therefore considered <i>muktze</i>. Therefore, a Jew may not host a gentile on Shabbat lest he come to handle the <i>muktze</i> wine remnants on Shabbat. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, our</b> cups <b>should also</b> be prohibited, as they too contain wine remnants that have no use whatsoever and should therefore be considered <i>muktze</i>. The Gemara answers: The remnants in <b>our</b> cups <b>are fit for chickens.</b> The Gemara objects: If so, the remnants in <b>their</b> cups <b>are also fit for chickens.</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: The remnants in <b>their</b> cups are <b>items</b> from which it is <b>prohibited</b> to derive any <b>benefit</b> whatsoever; consequently, they may not be handled at all.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And let him move</b> what remains of the wine <b>on account of the cup,</b> which is a vessel that may be handled, as the wine remnants should be considered nullified in relation to the cup. <b>Didn’t Rava say: One may move a coal pan [<i>kannuna</i>] on account of the ashes</b> that can be used to cover filth, <b>even though there are broken pieces of wood on it</b> that have no use? This indicates that one may move something that is <i>muktze</i> along with something else that one is permitted to handle.

### Part 9
The Gemara rejects this argument: There is a difference between the two cases. <b>There,</b> the broken sticks <b>are not items from which</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to derive any <b>benefit</b> but are merely <i>muktze</i>, whereas <b>here,</b> what remains of the wine in the gentile’s cup <b>is an item from which</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to derive any <b>benefit,</b> and therefore the prohibition is more stringent.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: But let it be like a chamber pot for feces,</b> which may be removed from a room because it is repulsive. One should likewise be permitted to discard the remnants of these cups, since it is unseemly to leave them on the table. Ravina <b>said to him:</b> If the cups contain such remnants, they may be removed, but may <b>one make a chamber pot for feces <i>ab initio</i>?</b> The Sages ruled that one may not invite a gentile for a meal on Shabbat so as to avoid such complications.

### Part 11
In summary of this <i>halakha</i>, the Gemara states that <b>Rava authorized</b> the Sage <b>Mar Shmuel,</b> from the house of the Exilarch, to deliver a public lecture, <b>and</b> the latter <b>taught: One may invite a gentile</b> for a meal <b>on Shabbat, but one may not invite a gentile</b> for a meal <b>on a Festival</b> as <b>a preventive measure, lest he</b> come to cook <b>more for his sake.</b> It is related about <b>Mareimar and Mar Zutra</b> that <b>when a gentile would happen</b> to come <b>to their</b> house <b>on a Festival, they would say to him: If you are satisfied with</b> the food <b>that we have prepared for ourselves, good; and if not, we will not go to</b> any <b>extra trouble on your account.</b>

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: A person may not heat water</b> on a Festival in order <b>to</b> wash <b>his feet unless it is</b> also <b>fit for drinking,</b> as they hold that kindling a fire on a Festival is permitted only for the sake of preparing food, but not for washing. <b>But Beit Hillel permit</b> one to kindle a fire on a Festival even for washing. <b>A person may kindle</b> a large <b>fire and warm himself at it.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a fire, who taught it?</b> Is <b>it a statement</b> accepted by <b>all,</b> including Beit Shammai, <b>and Beit Shammai differentiate between benefit</b> affecting <b>one’s entire body and benefit</b> affecting <b>a single limb,</b> so that they agree that kindling a fire to heat one’s entire body is similar to kindling a fire for food and is therefore permitted, while heating water to wash one’s feet remains prohibited? <b>Or perhaps Beit Hillel taught it, but Beit Shammai do not differentiate</b> between the two cases, and they permit kindling a fire on a Festival only for the purpose of preparing food.

### Part 14
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from an explicit <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say: A person may not make a fire and warm himself at it, but Beit Hillel permit</b> it. It is clear from here that the latter clause of the mishna was taught only in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel.

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabban Gamliel was stringent</b> about <b>three things in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai: One may not insulate hot food on a Festival</b> for Shabbat <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> but rather one ought to do so on the eve of the Festival; <b>and one may not set up</b> a metal <b>candelabrum</b> that fell <b>on a Festival; and one may not bake thick loaves</b> on a Festival <b>but only thin ones,</b> due to the great effort entailed in preparing the former. <b>Rabban Gamliel said: From the days of my father’s household they would never bake thick loaves</b> on a Festival, <b>but</b> only <b>thin ones.</b> The Sages <b>said to him: What shall we do for your father’s household, who were stringent with themselves</b> but <b>lenient with all of the Jewish people, to</b> allow them to <b>bake thick loaves and cakes baked on coals.</b>

### Part 16
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement that Rabban Gamliel would not permit the insulation of hot water on a Festival <i>ab initio</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he prepared a joining of cooked foods [<i>eiruv tavshilin</i>], what is the reason that Beit Shammai</b> prohibit it? <b>And if</b> it speaks of a case <b>where he did not set aside an <i>eiruv tavshilin</i>, what is the reason for</b> the lenient ruling of <b>Beit Hillel? Rav Huna said: Actually,</b> I will <b>say to you</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where one did not prepare an <i>eiruv tavshilin</i>,</b> but Beit Hillel hold that <b>the Sages</b> nevertheless <b>permitted him</b> to prepare what he needs for <b>his</b> basic <b>sustenance.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rav Huna</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to <b>one who did not prepare an <i>eiruv tavshilin</i></b> on the eve of a Festival, others <b>may bake one loaf</b> of bread <b>for him, and cook one pot</b> of food <b>for him,</b>
