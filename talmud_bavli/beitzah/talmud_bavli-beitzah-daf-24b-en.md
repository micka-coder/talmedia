### Part 1
<b>One may slaughter</b> animals <b>from</b> pens containing <b>pools</b> of drinking water <b>on a Festival, but not from</b> those found caught in <b>nets or</b> in <b>traps,</b> as they may have been caught on the Festival itself. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> If <b>he came and found</b> the nets and traps <b>out of order on the eve of the Festival,</b> which indicates that an animal had been caught in them, then <b>it is known that</b> the animals <b>were caught on the eve of the Festival, and they are</b> therefore <b>permitted.</b> However, if he checked the nets and traps shortly before the onset of the Festival and found them intact, and <b>he</b> later <b>came and found them out of order on the Festival, it is known that</b> the animals <b>were caught on the Festival, and they are</b> therefore <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara poses a question: The <i>baraita</i> <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult</b> because it contains an internal contradiction between its clauses: <b>You</b> first <b>said</b> that if <b>he came and found them out of order on the eve of the Festival, it is known that they were caught on the eve of the Festival. The reason</b> is <b>that he came and found them out of order, but</b> if there is <b>uncertainty,</b> the animals <b>are prohibited.</b> But <b>say</b> now <b>the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he came and found them out of order on the Festival, it is known that they were caught on the Festival. The reason</b> is <b>that he came and found them out of order, but</b> in a case of <b>uncertainty,</b> the assumption is that <b>they were caught on the eve of the Festival and are permitted.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara explains: <b>This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: If he came and found them out of order on the eve of the Festival, it is known that they were caught on the eve of the Festival, and they are permitted. But</b> in a case of <b>uncertainty, it is considered as if they were caught on the Festival, and they are prohibited.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar.</b> All these versions of Shmuel’s ruling are basically in agreement: In a case of uncertainty as to whether or not an item was prepared before the Festival, it is prohibited.

### Part 5
§ It was stated in the mishna that Rabban Gamliel <b>said</b> that the fish brought to him on the Festival by the gentile <b>are permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Permitted for what</b> purpose? <b>Rav said: They are permitted to be received</b> and moved, but they may not be eaten. <b>Levi said: They are</b> even <b>permitted to be eaten.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav said: A person should never prevent himself from</b> attending <b>the study hall for even one moment,</b> and the proof is from this issue; <b>as Levi and I were before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>when he stated this <i>halakha</i>. In the evening he said: They are permitted to be eaten,</b> but <b>the</b> following <b>morning he said: They are permitted</b> only <b>to be received. I, who was in the study hall</b> in the morning as well, <b>retracted</b> what I said, and taught the matter in accordance with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s second opinion. <b>Levi, who was not in the study hall</b> in the morning, <b>did not retract</b> his statement.

### Part 7
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a gentile brought a gift [<i>doron</i>] to a Jew</b> on a Festival, <b>even moist [<i>mefulamin</i>] fish or produce from that</b> same <b>day, they are permitted. Granted, according to the one who said they are permitted to be received, it is well;</b> the <i>halakha</i> is understandable. <b>However, according to the one who said they are permitted to be eaten, is produce from that</b> same <b>day permitted to be eaten?</b> If it was picked from the tree on that day, it is subject to the prohibition of <i>muktze</i>.

### Part 8
The Gemara responds with a counter-question: <b>And according to your reasoning, is produce</b> picked <b>on that</b> same <b>day permitted to be moved?</b> Why, then, is it obvious to you that the produce is permitted to be received? <b>Rather,</b> it must be explained that <b>we are dealing with fish whose</b> gills <b>are</b> still <b>red and</b> with <b>produce that is preserved in greens,</b> not with produce that was actually picked on that day. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>is it called</b> produce <b>of that</b> same <b>day? Because it is</b> fresh and <b>similar to</b> produce picked <b>on that</b> same <b>day.</b> Such produce is permitted not only to be moved, but even to be eaten.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> in this regard <b>is</b> as follows: In the case of <b>a gentile who brought a gift to a Jew on a Festival, if there is of that species</b> still <b>attached</b> to a tree or the ground, <b>it is prohibited</b> to be eaten, as it may be assumed that the gentile picked it that same day. <b>And in the evening as well,</b> after the conclusion of the Festival, <b>it is prohibited for</b> the period of <b>time</b> needed <b>for its preparation,</b> i.e., the period of time necessary to detach it from the tree or the ground, as one may not derive benefit from a prohibited labor that was performed on a Festival on behalf of a Jew.

### Part 10
<b>And if none of that species is</b> still <b>attached</b> to the ground, then if the gift was brought from <b>within the limit,</b> i.e., the distance one may travel on a Festival, <b>it is permitted,</b> as no prohibited labor has been performed.
