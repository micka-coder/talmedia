### Part 1
<b>of a live</b> chicken, <b>who has?</b> He sought to purchase eggs of this kind. <b>They gave him eggs of a slaughtered</b> chicken. <b>He came before Rabbi Ami,</b> claiming he had been cheated. Rabbi Ami <b>said to</b> the sellers: This <b>is a mistaken transaction, and it is rescinded;</b> the sale is void.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious</b> that the transaction is void, as he specified exactly what he wanted. The Gemara answers: The ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>this</b> individual <b>wants them for food</b> rather than for chicks, <b>and that which he said,</b> that he is looking for eggs <b>of a live</b> chicken, he said only <b>because they are hard-shelled,</b> mature eggs. <b>What is the practical difference,</b> i.e., what is this man claiming from the seller according to this rejected interpretation? He is merely demanding <b>to refund him the difference</b> in value <b>between the two</b> types of eggs. Rabbi Ami therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the sale involved a fundamental error, as the eggs of a slaughtered chicken are unfit for incubation. The transaction is therefore void.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <b>A certain person said to</b> vendors: Does <b>anyone</b> have <b>eggs of</b> a chicken that has had relations with <b>a rooster?</b> Does <b>anyone</b> have <b>eggs of a rooster? They gave him eggs</b> that a hen had <b>absorbed from the ground,</b> i.e., which had not been fertilized by a rooster. <b>He came before Rabbi Ami</b> claiming that he had been cheated. Rabbi Ami <b>said to them:</b> This <b>is a mistaken transaction, and it is rescinded.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara again asks: It is <b>obvious</b> that this is the case. The Gemara explains: The ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>this</b> person <b>wants</b> the eggs <b>for food, and that which he said,</b> that he wants eggs <b>of a rooster,</b> he said only <b>because they are fatter. What is the practical difference;</b> i.e., what is this man claiming from the seller according to this rejected interpretation? He is merely demanding <b>that they should refund him the difference</b> in value <b>between the two</b> types. Rav Ami therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case; rather, the sale is void.

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests another explanation of Rav’s statement. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the claim: <b>An egg is fully formed upon its emergence?</b> It means that <b>it is fully formed with the emergence of most of it, in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan. As Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is taught in a <i>baraita</i> that in the case of <b>an egg, most of which emerged</b> from the chicken <b>on a Festival eve, and</b> the egg <b>returned</b> inside the mother and was finally laid on the Festival itself, it <b>is permitted to eat</b> this egg <b>on the Festival.</b> Since most of the egg had emerged before the Festival began, it is considered to have been laid the day before.

### Part 6
<b>And some say</b> the following explanation: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the expression: <b>Fully formed upon its emergence?</b> It means that <b>it is fully formed upon the emergence of all of it.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>Upon the emergence of all of it, yes,</b> it is fully formed at this stage; <b>however,</b> if only <b>most of it</b> came out the day before, <b>no,</b> it is not considered fully formed. <b>And</b> this reading serves <b>to exclude</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> In any case, Rav’s statement can correspond to this statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan.

### Part 7
§ Apropos the halakhic status of eggs found inside a slaughtered chicken, the Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself:</b> In the case of <b>one who slaughters a chicken and finds inside it fully formed eggs, it is permitted to eat</b> these eggs <b>with milk. Rabbi Ya’akov says: If</b> the eggs <b>were</b> still <b>attached by sinews, it is prohibited</b> to eat them with milk, as they are considered meat.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>taught this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who eats</b> one of the following parts <b>of the unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird: From a cluster of eggs</b> that are still attached to it by sinews, or <b>from</b> its <b>bones, or from the sinews, or from meat that has been detached from a live</b> animal, is <b>ritually pure</b> because none of these are considered part of the meat of the bird, and therefore they do not impart the ritual impurity of an animal carcass.

### Part 9
However, if one ate <b>from the ovary of</b> its <b>eggs,</b> which contains very small eggs that do not possess any of the regular characteristics of eggs, or if he took a piece <b>of the craw or the intestines, or if he melted the fat</b> of a dead bird <b>and swallowed it,</b> he is <b>ritually impure</b> from the impurity imparted by the unslaughtered carcass of a bird.

### Part 10
<b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>taught</b> that if one ate <b>from a cluster of eggs he is pure,</b> which indicates that eggs still attached by sinews to the chicken are not considered part of the meat of the bird? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This ruling is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov. For if</b> you say it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov, didn’t he say: If</b> the eggs <b>were attached by sinews</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to eat them with milk, indicating that he considers these eggs meat of the chicken.

### Part 11
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>From where</b> do you draw this conclusion? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Ya’akov stated</b> that these eggs are part of the chicken <b>only there, with regard to</b> the <b>prohibition</b> against eating the eggs with milk; <b>however,</b> perhaps <b>with regard to ritual impurity</b> he did <b>not</b> say that these eggs are considered part of the chicken.

### Part 12
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>with regard to</b> ritual <b>impurity let us also issue a decree</b> and be stringent in a case of uncertainty and therefore rule that these attached eggs should be considered part of the chicken, <b>this</b> would serve to <b>proliferate impurity, and we do not proliferate impurity</b> that is <b>by rabbinic law.</b> One does not declare an item ritually impure by rabbinic law merely because uncertainty has arisen with regard to its status.

### Part 13
<b>And some say</b> a different version of this discussion, according to which the question is: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>taught</b> that if one eats <b>from the ovary of</b> its <b>eggs he is ritually impure? Rav Yosef said: It is Rabbi Ya’akov, who said: If</b> the eggs <b>were attached by sinews, they are prohibited. Abaye said to him: From where</b> do you know <b>that</b> the term <b>ovary</b> means: <b>From these</b> eggs <b>that are hanging from the ovary; perhaps</b> it is referring to the <b>ovary itself,</b> the part of the flesh of the bird where the eggs develop?

### Part 14
<b>And if you say:</b> If it is referring to <b>the ovary itself, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this? It is obvious that the ovary itself is meat. One can answer as follows: <b>Just as it is in</b> the case of <b>the craw and the intestines, that even though they are meat</b> according to all opinions, <b>since there are people who do not eat</b> them, <b>it was necessary to teach us</b> that they have the status of meat; <b>here, too,</b> with regard to an ovary, <b>since there are people who do not eat</b> it, <b>it was necessary to teach us</b> that it may not be eaten with milk. Therefore, this argument does not prove that this version of the discussion is incorrect.

### Part 15
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Any</b> species <b>whose intercourse</b> occurs only <b>in the</b> hours of the <b>day</b> is <b>born</b> only <b>by day; any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs</b> only <b>at night is born</b> only <b>by night; any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs either by day or by night is born either by day or by night.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs by day is born by day, this</b> is referring to <b>a chicken. Any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs by night is born by night, this is a bat. Any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs either by day or by night,</b> this means <b>a human</b> being <b>and all that are similar to him.</b>

### Part 16
<b>The Master said: Any</b> species <b>whose intercourse occurs by day is born by day, this is a chicken.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <b>practical</b> halakhic <b>difference</b> of this statement? The Gemara answers: The halakhic difference is with regard <b>to that which Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana</b> said, <b>as Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana said:</b> If one <b>examined a chicken’s nest on a Festival eve and did not find an egg in it, and the following day,</b> on the Festival, <b>he rose early and found an egg in it,</b> the egg is <b>permitted,</b> as it can be assumed it was not laid that night.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t he examine</b> the nest before the Festival and fail to find an egg there? If so, the egg must have been laid on the Festival. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that <b>he did not examine very carefully. And even</b> if <b>he did examine carefully,</b> you can <b>say</b> that <b>most of</b> the egg <b>emerged</b> on the eve of the Festival <b>and returned</b> inside its mother, and this ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> This <i>baraita</i> shows that the <i>halakha</i> does not take into account the possibility that a chicken could lay an egg at night.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul say</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If <b>one examined a chicken’s nest on a Festival eve and did not find an egg in it, and the following day he rose early and found an egg in it, it is prohibited?</b> This indicates that a chicken might indeed lay an egg at night. The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> it is referring <b>to</b> an egg <b>that</b> the chicken <b>absorbed from the earth,</b> i.e., one that was not formed by male fertilization. An egg that is not produced by intercourse can be laid at night as well.

### Part 19
The Gemara challenges this: <b>If so,</b> in <b>Rav Mari’s</b> case <b>too,</b> you can <b>say that</b> the chicken <b>absorbed from the earth</b> and laid the egg during the night of the Festival. How, then, could Rav Mari permit the egg? The Gemara answers: There it is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where there is a male with it.</b> The Gemara asks: Even <b>where there is a male with it,</b> one can <b>also say that it absorbed from the earth</b> rather than from the male. The Gemara answers that <b>Ravina said:</b> It is <b>learned</b> as a tradition that <b>anywhere that a male is present,</b> a chicken <b>does not absorb from the earth.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>Until where</b> exactly is it considered to have a male with it; How near must a rooster be for this principle to come into effect? <b>Rav Gamda said in the name of Rav:</b> The male must be <b>any place</b>
