### Part 1
<b>it is necessary to test them</b> to ensure that they do not burst when heated. If they are heated for the first time on a Festival, he will be thereby testing them, which is a prohibited labor. <b>And some say: Because it is necessary to harden them</b> by overheating them the first time to make them fit for use, which is considered preparing a vessel for use and is prohibited on a Festival.

### Part 2
In relation to the above, the Gemara cites the following teaching: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there:</b> If one <b>trampled</b> fowl with his foot, <b>or threw it</b> against a <b>wall, or if an animal crushed it,</b> and it is <b>twitching</b> but cannot stand; <b>if</b> the animal <b>waited,</b> i.e., remained alive, <b>from</b> the <b>time</b> of the injury <b>until</b> the same <b>time</b> twenty-four hours later, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>slaughtered it, it is kosher,</b> provided no other defect is found in it that would have caused it to die within twelve months, which would render it a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Yannai said in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Antigonus: It requires examination</b> after slaughtering, to make sure it does not have a defect.

### Part 3
In relation to the same issue, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya inquired of Rabbi Zeira: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to slaughtering it on a Festival? Do we assume on a Festival</b> that it has <b>a flaw or not?</b> In other words, may one rely on the assumption that a typical chicken has no defect? Or perhaps, since there is concern with regard to this particular bird and it requires examination, one should refrain from slaughtering it lest it turn out to be a <i>tereifa</i>. If so, he will have performed labor for no purpose.

### Part 4
<b>He said to him</b> in response: <b>We</b> already <b>learned</b> that <b>one may not whiten tiles</b> in order to <b>roast on them. And we discussed it: What does he</b> thereby <b>do? And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Here we are dealing with new tiles,</b> and the Sages prohibited heating them <b>because</b> one first <b>needs to test them,</b> and they might crack when heated. If they were heated for the first time on a Festival and cracked, it would show that they were unfit for use, in which case heating them would have been an unnecessary labor. This indicates that one may not take a chance on a Festival with regard to something that might be flawed, and therefore a possible <i>tereifa</i> should be similarly prohibited.

### Part 5
<b>He said to him:</b> This is no proof; <b>we learned</b> that the reason for <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> is <b>because it is necessary to harden them</b> in order to make them into proper vessels. Therefore, there is no connection between making a vessel and conducting an examination. Consequently, there is no reason to prohibit the slaughter of such a chicken on a Festival.

### Part 6
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is possible for several people to perform a single act of cooking on Shabbat, and all will be liable. How so? <b>One brings the fire, and one brings the wood, and one places the pot</b> on the stove, <b>and one brings the water</b> for the pot, <b>and one puts spices into</b> the food, <b>and one stirs</b> the pot; <b>they are all liable</b> for cooking. The Gemara wonders at this: <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i> that <b>the last one is liable and all</b> the rest <b>are exempt?</b> The Gemara responds: This <b>is not difficult. This</b> case, where all are liable, is referring to a situation <b>in which he brought fire at the outset,</b> and therefore each of them performed part of the act of cooking; <b>that</b> case, where only the last one is liable, is referring to a situation <b>in which he brought fire at the end.</b> In that case, none of the earlier people performed any aspect of cooking at all, as the labor of cooking begins only from when fire is brought.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, all of them performed an action</b> that constitutes a prohibited labor, and they are therefore partners in a prohibited act and the desecration of Shabbat. <b>But</b> the <b>one who places the pot</b> on the stove, <b>what</b> prohibited labor <b>has he performed? Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Here we are dealing with a new pot, and due to whitening tiles they applied</b> the same prohibition to <b>it.</b> This means that one is not liable for cooking the food in the pot but for strengthening the pot itself, as is the case with heating tiles.

### Part 8
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>New ovens and stoves are similar to all vessels that</b> may be <b>carried in a courtyard</b> on a Festival, as one can place items on them. <b>However, one may not anoint them with oil, nor rub them with a rag, nor cool them with cold</b> liquids to <b>harden them</b>, as all these actions are considered preparing the vessel for use, which may not be done on a Festival. <b>And if</b> one did so <b>in order to bake</b> in the oven on the Festival itself, <b>this is permitted.</b>

### Part 9
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: During a Festival <b>one may scald the head and the feet</b> of a slaughtered animal with hot water in order to remove the hairs from them, <b>and one may singe them in fire</b> for this purpose, <b>but one may not smear them with clay, nor earth, nor lime</b> in order to remove the hairs because this involves great effort, and it appears as though he is processing the skin. <b>And one may not shear</b> those hairs <b>with scissors,</b> as it appears as though he is performing the labor of shearing in an effort to obtain the hairs themselves.

### Part 10
Similarly, <b>one may not trim</b> the top of the leaves connected to <b>the vegetable with its</b> special <b>shears, but one may prepare <i>kundas</i> and <i>akaviyot</i>,</b> bitter vegetables that can be eaten only after extensive cooking, although this involves great effort. <b>And one may kindle</b> fire <b>and bake in a large baker’s oven [<i>purnei</i>], and one may heat water in an <i>antikhi</i>,</b> a kind of large urn, <b>but one may not bake in a new baker’s oven lest it break.</b> If the oven cracks when heated because it was not properly made, one will have performed unnecessary work on a Festival.

### Part 11
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> similarly in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One may not blow</b> a fire <b>with bellows,</b> because this is the manner of a weekday activity, <b>but one may blow</b> a fire <b>with a tube,</b> in an unusual manner. <b>And one may not mend a skewer nor sharpen it. The Sages</b> further <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One may not break a reed</b> in order to make a kind of skewer upon which <b>to roast salted</b> fish, <b>but one may crack a nut</b> covered <b>with a rag, and there is no concern lest it tear,</b> for even if this occurs, no prohibited labor has been performed.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And Rabbi Eliezer further stated</b> the following leniency: <b>A person may stand over</b> objects in <b>storage,</b> such as produce that he has for some reason previously set aside from use,
