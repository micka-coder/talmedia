### Part 1
<b>Rather,</b> it is referring <b>to hard</b> clothes, upon which it is permitted to sit even if they are a mixture of wool and linen. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>that Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> With regard to <b>this hard felt [<i>namta</i>]</b> material produced in the town <b>of Neresh, it is permitted</b> to sit or recline on it, and one need not be concerned about the fact that it is a mixture of wool and linen.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> With regard to <b>felt socks [<i>ardalayin</i>], there is no</b> prohibition of <b>diverse kinds regarding them,</b> as they are hard. <b>Rava said: These bundles for coins,</b> comprised of hard fabric or felt, <b>there is no</b> prohibition of <b>diverse kinds with regard to them.</b> However, with regard to pouches <b>for</b> holding <b>seeds, there is</b> a prohibition of <b>diverse kinds with regard to them,</b> as they are larger and softer than both felt socks and hard bundles for coins. <b>Rav Ashi said: Both this and that have no</b> prohibition of <b>diverse kinds with regard to them because</b> using <b>these</b> items <b>is not the</b> usual <b>manner of keeping warm.</b> Even if these objects are placed close to one’s skin, this is not the usual way of wearing clothes and warming oneself, and therefore they are permitted.

### Part 3
§ The mishna taught: <b>However, one may not</b> send <b>a spiked sandal</b>on a Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>A spiked sandal, what is the reason</b> that it may <b>not</b> be worn? The Gemara answers: It is <b>due to an incident that occurred.</b> A great tragedy resulted when people wore spiked sandals on Shabbat, which led the Sages to decree that these sandals may not be worn on a Shabbat or Festival.

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said:</b> With regard to <b>a spiked sandal, it is prohibited to wear it</b> on Shabbat, <b>but it is permitted to move it.</b> He clarifies: <b>It is prohibited to wear</b> a spiked sandal, <b>due to</b> the <b>incident that occurred. And it is permitted to move it, from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches: One may not send. For if it enters your mind</b> that <b>it is prohibited</b> even <b>to move</b> a spiked sandal, <b>now</b> consider: If <b>it were prohibited to move it,</b> is the mishna <b>required</b> to state that <b>one may send it?</b> Rather, it must certainly be permitted to move a spiked sandal inside the house, despite the fact that one may not wear it.

### Part 5
The mishna further teaches: <b>Nor</b> may one send <b>an unsewn shoe</b> on a Festival. The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious,</b> as these shoes are unfit for wearing. The Gemara answers: This statement <b>was necessary</b> only to teach <b>that although</b> the shoe <b>is attached with pins</b> and can be worn, it may not be sent on a Festival. Since it not properly sewn, it is not usually worn.

### Part 6
The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not even</b> send <b>a white shoe. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda permits</b> the sending <b>of a black</b> shoe <b>but prohibits</b> the sending <b>of a white one because</b> a white one <b>requires a lump of chalk</b> to color it properly. <b>Rabbi Yosei prohibits</b> the sending <b>of a black</b> shoe <b>because one needs to polish it.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara comments: <b>And they do not disagree</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i>, as this <b>Sage</b> ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the custom <b>of his locale, and</b> this <b>Sage</b> ruled differently, <b>in accordance with</b> the custom of <b>his locale. In the place of</b> this <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, the leather was made so that the side of the hide facing the <b>flesh</b> is on the <b>underneath,</b> facing the inside of the shoe, and therefore it does not require polishing; whereas <b>in the place of</b> that <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, the leather was made so that side of the hide facing the <b>flesh</b> is <b>above,</b> facing the outside of the shoe. That side is often cracked and uneven and requires smoothing and polishing.

### Part 8
§ The mishna taught that <b>this is the</b> general <b>principle:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> article <b>that one may use on a Festival,</b> one may send it. The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Sheshet permitted the Sages to send phylacteries on a Festival. Abaye said to him: But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: With regard to <b>any</b> article <b>that one may use on a Festival, one may send it?</b> Phylacteries are not worn on Festivals. The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> article <b>that one may use on a weekday, one may send it on a Festival.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Abaye said:</b> With regard to <b>phylacteries, since</b> this topic <b>has come before us</b> in the previous discussion, <b>let us say</b> a novel <b>matter about it:</b> If someone <b>was coming on the road</b> on the eve of a Shabbat or Festival, <b>and</b> he had <b>phylacteries on his head,</b> as the practice then was to don phylacteries the entire day, but not at night, <b>and the sun set</b> before <b>he</b> arrived at his destination, signaling the beginning of the Shabbat or Festival, when phylacteries may not be worn or even moved, <b>he places his hand upon them</b> to cover them so that people will not see them <b>until he reaches his house,</b> at which point he removes them. If <b>he was sitting in the study hall with phylacteries on his head, and the day</b> of Shabbat or the Festival <b>was sanctified, for</b> which <b>he</b> was unprepared, <b>he places his hand upon them until he reaches his house.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Ika, raised an objection</b> from the following teaching: If <b>one was coming on the road with phylacteries on his head, and the day was sanctified</b> before <b>he</b> arrived at his destination, <b>he places his hand upon them until he reaches the house nearest the wall,</b> where he removes them and leaves them there. <b>If he was sitting in the study hall,</b> outside the city, <b>and the day was sanctified, for</b> which <b>he</b> was unprepared, <b>he places his hand upon them until he reaches a house that is near the study hall,</b> where there are people who can guard the phylacteries. This shows that one may not bring phylacteries all the way to his house, but only to the nearest place within the city boundary.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that one places the phylacteries in the house nearest the wall, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the phylacteries can be <b>safeguarded</b> there, whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that he may bring them all the way to his house, deals with a situation <b>where they are not safeguarded</b> in the nearest house.

### Part 12
The Gemara challenges this: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the phylacteries are <b>not safeguarded, why</b> discuss <b>specifically</b> the case of phylacteries that were <b>on his head? Even</b> if one was not donning them but found them <b>placed on the ground,</b> he should <b>also</b> be required to don them and bring them to the house, <b>for didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Eiruvin</i> 95a): <b>One who finds phylacteries</b> lying in a field outside of the city on Shabbat should don them and <b>bring them into</b> the city <b>one pair at a time?</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, where it was taught that one need not don the phylacteries if they were not already on his head, is referring to a situation <b>where they are safeguarded from thieves and</b> also <b>from dogs. That</b> mishna, which stated that even if one found them on the ground, he must put them on and bring them into the city, is referring to a case <b>where they are safeguarded from dogs but are not safeguarded from thieves.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara clarifies the novel element of the mishna’s ruling. <b>Lest you say: Since most thieves [<i>listim</i>] are Jews, who would not treat</b> phylacteries <b>with contempt,</b> one should not be allowed to carry them because there is no danger that they will be desecrated if they are left in their place, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> takes the minority of cases into account. It is therefore appropriate to don the phylacteries and bring them into the city.
