<b>in two</b> separate <b>houses,</b> and consequently the two outer courtyards do not join together and become as one.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Rav Sheshet state that an <i>eiruv</i> placed in two houses, even within the same courtyard, does not join the houses together? He must have said this in accordance <b>with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>five</b> people who <b>collected their <i>eiruv</i> and placed it in two</b> separate <b>utensils,</b> even in a single house, <b>Beit Shammai say: Their <i>eiruv</i> is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>,</b> as the two parts of the <i>eiruv</i> have not been deposited in the same place, <b>and Beit Hillel say: Their <i>eiruv</i> is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i></b> as long as the entire <i>eiruv</i> was deposited in a single domain.

### Part 3
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Even if you say</b> that this is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Beit Hillel, Beit Hillel</b> may have <b>stated</b> their opinion <b>only there, with regard to two utensils</b> that are located <b>in one house</b> and consequently, they join together. <b>However,</b> if the two utensils are located <b>in two</b> separate <b>houses,</b> even Beit Hillel agree that the <i>eiruv</i> is <b>not</b> valid.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Aá¸¥a, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi:</b> The explanation <b>of Rav Yehuda is difficult</b> and the explanation <b>of Rav Sheshet is difficult.</b> The explanation of <b>Rav Yehuda is difficult, as he said</b> that it is speaking <b>about a case where the middle</b> courtyard <b>put its</b> first <b><i>eiruv</i> in the one</b> courtyard <b>and its</b> second <b><i>eiruv</i> in the other</b> courtyard. <b>However, once the middle</b> courtyard <b>establishes an <i>eiruv</i> with</b> one of the <b>outer ones, they are</b> regarded <b>as one,</b> so that <b>when it later establishes an <i>eiruv</i> with the other</b> outer courtyard, <b>it acts</b> also <b>on behalf</b> of the first outer courtyard, as both of them are treated like a single courtyard.

### Part 5
<b>And</b> the explanation <b>of Rav Sheshet is difficult.</b> Since the two outer courtyards placed their respective <i>eiruvin</i> in the middle courtyard, all are regarded as residents of the middle courtyard. And since each of the outer courtyards placed its <i>eiruv</i> in a different house, the case <b>should be</b> treated <b>like</b> that of <b>five</b> people <b>who lived in the same courtyard, one of whom forgot and did not join the <i>eiruv</i>, where they</b> all <b>prohibit one another</b> to carry in the courtyard. Similarly in this case, all should be prohibited to carry in the middle courtyard, the residents of the middle courtyard as well as the residents of the outer courtyards.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ashi said to him: It is not difficult</b> according to the explanation <b>of Rav Yehuda and it is not difficult</b> according to the explanation of <b>Rav Sheshet. It is not difficult</b> according to the explanation of <b>Rav Yehuda, since the</b> residents of the <b>middle</b> courtyard <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> with</b> each of <b>the</b> two <b>outer</b> courtyards, <b>and the</b> residents of the <b>two outer</b> courtyards <b>did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with one another.</b> The residents of each of the outer courtyards <b>indicated that it desired</b> to join <b>with</b> the middle courtyard, <b>but did not desire</b> to join <b>with</b> the other outer courtyard. Since the residents of the outer courtyards demonstrated that that they did not want to join together and form a common <i>eiruv</i>, they cannot be forced to do so.

### Part 7
<b>And it is not difficult</b> according to the explanation <b>of Rav Sheshet. If they said</b> that the people living in the outer courtyards are considered as <b>residents</b> of the middle courtyard <b>as a leniency,</b> so that they should be permitted to carry in the middle courtyard, does this mean that <b>they will say</b> that they are considered <b>residents</b> of the middle courtyard also <b>as a stringency,</b> so that they should be prohibited from carrying in the middle courtyard as if they live there?

### Part 8
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: This</b> statement in the mishna, that objects may be carried from either of the outer courtyards into the middle courtyard and also from the middle courtyard into either of the outer courtyards, <b>is the statement of,</b> i.e., in accordance with the opinion of, <b>Rabbi Shimon. But the Rabbis say: One domain serves two domains.</b> That is to say, it is permitted to carry objects from either of the outer courtyards into the inner one, as no prohibition is imposed upon the outer courtyards, given that both established an <i>eiruv</i> with the middle courtyard. <b>But two domains do not serve one domain,</b> meaning that it is prohibited to carry objects from the middle courtyard into either of the two outer courtyards. The utensils of the middle courtyard are drawn after the other two, meaning that were he to bring them into one of the outer courtyards, he would be regarded as having removed them from the other.

### Part 9
Rav Yehuda relates: <b>When I recited</b> this teaching <b>before Shmuel, he said to me:</b>
