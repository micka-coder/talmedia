### Part 1
<b>that they are not precisely</b> a cubit. <b>Granted, according to Rava,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means: <b>So that these,</b> the cubits of diverse kinds of seeds, <b>should be</b> measured with <b>expansive</b> handbreadths, <b>and those,</b> the cubits of <i>sukka</i>, should be measured with <b>depressed</b> handbreadths. <b>However, according to Abaye,</b> it is <b>difficult.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> Emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>say: The cubit of diverse kinds</b> of seeds mentioned by the Sages <b>is</b> measured <b>with a cubit of six</b> handbreadths, not the other cubits.

### Part 3
The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>However, from</b> the fact <b>that it is taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: All the cubits that the Sages mentioned with regard to diverse kinds</b> of seeds are measured <b>with cubits of six</b> handbreadths, <b>provided that they are not</b> measured with <b>exact</b> handbreadths? This proves <b>by inference</b> that <b>the</b> anonymous <b>first <i>tanna</i> is speaking of all cubits,</b> and not only those in the case of diverse kinds of seeds.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers that <b>Abaye</b> could have <b>said to you: Isn’t there Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who holds in accordance with my</b> opinion? <b>I stated</b> my opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara comments: <b>According to Abaye,</b> the issue of large and small cubits <b>is certainly</b> subject to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as his ruling can only be in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. <b>According to Rava,</b> however, <b>must it be said</b> that <b>this is</b> subject to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: This is not necessarily the case, as <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you: Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> does not dispute the basic teaching of the anonymous first <i>tanna</i> that all the cubits mentioned by the Sages are cubits of six handbreadths. Rather, he <b>came to teach us this: One</b> should <b>not reduce the cubit of diverse kinds</b> of seeds, i.e., one should not measure it with depressed handbreadths.

### Part 7
The Gemara raises an objection. <b>And</b> if that is the case, <b>let him say: One must not reduce the cubit of diverse kinds</b> of seeds. <b>What does</b> the phrase: <b>A cubit</b> consisting <b>of six</b> handbreadths come <b>to exclude? Does it not</b> come <b>to exclude the cubit of a <i>sukka</i> and the cubit of an alleyway,</b> which are measured with cubits of five handbreadths?

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects this argument. <b>No,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s formulation comes <b>to exclude the cubit of the base</b> of the altar, which is the bottom level of the altar, one cubit high with a ledge one cubit wide, <b>and the cubit of the surrounding ledge</b> of the altar, which is five cubits above the base, six cubits above the ground, and one cubit wide. Everyone agrees that those cubits are small cubits of five handbreadths.

### Part 9
<b>As it is written: “And these are the measures of the altar by cubits; the cubit is a cubit and a handbreadth, the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and its border by its edge round about shall be a span: And this shall be the higher part of the altar”</b> (Ezekiel 43:13). And the Sages explained this verse as follows: <b>“The bottom shall be a cubit,” this is the base</b> of the altar; <b>“and the breadth a cubit,” this is the surrounding ledge</b> of the altar; <b>“and its border by its edge round about,” these are the horns</b> of the altar, i.e., extensions of the corners of the altar; <b>“and this shall be the higher part of the altar,”</b> this refers to <b>the golden altar</b> that stood inside the Sanctuary and was also measured by small cubits.

### Part 10
Since the Gemara discussed measurements, it proceeds to cite that which <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said: The measures</b> relating to mitzvot in the Torah, and the <i>halakhot</i> governing <b>interpositions</b> that invalidate ritual immersions, and the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>partitions are</b> all <b><i>halakhot</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b> These <i>halakhot</i> have no basis in the Written Torah, but according to tradition they were orally transmitted by God to Moses together with the Written Torah.

### Part 11
The Gemara questions this assertion: Are <b>measures</b> a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai? <b>They are</b> written <b>in the Torah, as it is written: “A land of wheat, and barley,</b> and vines, and figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” (Deuteronomy 8:8), <b>and Rav Ḥanan said: This entire verse was stated for</b> the purpose of teaching <b>measures</b> with regard to different <i>halakhot</i> in the Torah.

### Part 12
<b>Wheat</b> was mentioned as the basis for calculating the time required for one to become ritually impure when entering a house afflicted with leprosy, <b>as that which we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One who enters a house afflicted with leprosy</b> of the house (see Leviticus 14), <b>and his clothes</b> are draped <b>over his shoulders, and his sandals and his rings are in his hands,</b> both <b>he and they,</b> the clothes, sandals, and rings, <b>immediately</b> become <b>ritually impure.</b> However, if <b>he was dressed in his clothes, and his sandals were on his feet, and his rings were on his fingers, he immediately</b> becomes <b>ritually impure, but they,</b> the clothes, sandals, and rings, <b>remain pure until he stays</b> in the house <b>long enough to eat half a loaf</b> of bread. This calculation is based on <b>wheat bread,</b> which takes less time to eat, <b>and not</b> on <b>barley bread,</b> and it relates to one who is <b>reclining and eating</b> it together <b>with relish,</b> which hastens the eating. This is a Torah measurement connected specifically to wheat.

### Part 13
<b>Barley</b> is also used as a basis for measurements, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>A bone</b> from a corpse the size <b>of a</b> grain of <b>barley imparts</b> ritual <b>impurity through contact and by being carried,</b> but <b>it does not impart impurity</b> by means <b>of a tent,</b> i.e., if the bone was inside a house, it does not render all the articles in the house ritually impure.

### Part 14
The halakhic measure determined by a <b>vine is the quantity of a quarter-<i>log</i> of wine for a nazirite.</b> A nazirite, who is prohibited to drink wine, is liable to be flogged if he drinks that measure.
