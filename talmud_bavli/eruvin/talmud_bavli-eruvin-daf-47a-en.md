### Part 1
The excluded area need not be so large; rather, <b>three courtyards</b> each <b>containing two houses</b> are sufficient for this purpose. <b>And Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon; and who disagrees with</b> Rabbi Shimon on this matter? It is <b>Rabbi Yehuda. Didn’t you say:</b> In a case where <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon</b> disagree, the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b> This teaches that one should not rely on these principles.

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this argument as well: <b>What is the difficulty</b> here? <b>Perhaps here, too, where it is stated</b> explicitly that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabbi Shimon, <b>it is stated,</b> but <b>where it is not stated</b> explicitly, <b>it is not stated,</b> and the principle that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda applies.

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> the proof is <b>from that which we learned</b> elsewhere in a mishna: With regard to <b>one who left his house</b> without making an <i>eiruv</i> of courtyards, <b>and established residence</b> for Shabbat <b>in a different town, whether</b> he was <b>a gentile or a Jew,</b> his lack of participation <b>prohibits the</b> other <b>residents of the courtyards</b> in which he has a share to carry objects from their houses to the courtyard, because he did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with them, and failure to include a house in the <i>eiruv</i> imposes restrictions upon all the residents of the courtyard. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: His</b> lack of participation <b>does not prohibit</b> the others to carry, since he is not present there. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> Lack of participation in an <i>eiruv</i> by <b>a gentile</b> who is away <b>prohibits</b> the others to carry, because he might return on Shabbat; but lack of participation by <b>a Jew</b> who is not present <b>does not prohibit</b> the others to carry, <b>as it is not the way of a Jew to return on Shabbat</b> once he has already established his residence elsewhere. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even if he left his house and established residence</b> for Shabbat <b>with his daughter in the same town, his</b> lack of participation <b>does not prohibit</b> the residents of his courtyard to carry, even though he is permitted to return home, <b>because he has already removed it,</b> i.e., returning, <b>from his mind.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. And who disagrees with him?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Yehuda. Didn’t you say:</b> When there is a dispute between <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b> This teaches that one cannot rely upon these principles.

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects this argument again: <b>What is the difficulty</b> here? <b>Perhaps here, too, where it is</b> explicitly <b>stated</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, <b>it is stated;</b> but <b>where</b> such a ruling <b>is not stated, it is not stated,</b> and the principle that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda is relied upon.

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> the proof is <b>from that which we learned</b> in the mishna. <b>And that is what</b> the Sages meant when <b>they said: A pauper can establish an <i>eiruv</i> with his feet;</b> that is to say, he may walk to a place within his Shabbat limit and declare: Here shall be my place of residence, and then his Shabbat limit is measured from that spot. <b>Rabbi Meir says: We</b> apply this law <b>only to a pauper,</b> who does not have food for two meals; only such a person is permitted to establish his <i>eiruv</i> by walking to the spot that he wishes to acquire as his place of residence.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This allowance applies <b>both to a pauper and to a wealthy person.</b> Indeed, <b>they said</b> that <b>one can establish an <i>eiruv</i> with bread only in order to</b> make placing an <i>eiruv</i> <b>easier for a wealthy person, so that he</b> need <b>not</b> trouble himself and <b>go out and establish an <i>eiruv</i> with his feet,</b> but the basic <i>eiruv</i> is established by walking to the spot one will acquire as his place of residence.

### Part 9
<b>And Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi</b> once <b>taught</b> this law to <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav in the presence of Rav,</b> saying: This allowance applies <b>both to a pauper and to a wealthy person, and Rav said to him:</b> When you teach this law, <b>conclude also with</b> this ruling: The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I need a second</b> ruling? <b>Didn’t you</b> already <b>say:</b> When there is a dispute between <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The fact that Rav needed to specify that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda on this matter indicates that he does not accept the general principle that when there is a dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.

### Part 11
The Gemara rejects this reasoning: <b>What is the difficulty</b> here? <b>Perhaps Rav does not accept these principles,</b> but the other Sages accept them.

### Part 12
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara brings a proof <b>from that which we learned</b> in another mishna with regard to a woman waiting for her brother-in-law, i.e., a woman whose husband died without children but who is survived by a brother. The brother-in-law is obligated by Torah law either to perform levirate marriage with his deceased brother’s widow, or to free her to marry others by participating in <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>The woman waiting for her brother-in-law may neither participate in <i>ḥalitza</i> nor undergo levirate marriage until three months have passed</b> following her husband’s death, due to concern that she may be pregnant from him, in which case she is exempt from levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>. After the three-month waiting period it will become clear whether she is pregnant from her husband.

### Part 13
<b>And similarly, all other women may not be married or</b> even <b>betrothed until three months have passed</b> following their divorce or the death of their husbands, <b>whether</b> they are <b>virgins or non-virgins, whether</b> they are <b>widows or divorcees,</b> and <b>whether</b> they became widowed or divorced when they were <b>betrothed or married.</b> In all cases, the woman may not marry for three months. Otherwise, if she is within the first three months of her pregnancy from her first husband, and she gives birth six months later, a doubt would arise as to the identity of the father. The Sages did not differentiate between cases where this concern is applicable and where it is not; rather, they fixed a principle that applies universally.

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> A woman who had been <b>married</b> when she became widowed or divorced <b>may be betrothed</b> immediately, as couples do not have relations during the period of their betrothal. However, she may not marry until three months have passed, in order to differentiate between any possible offspring from the first and second husband.

### Part 15
A woman who had only been <b>betrothed</b> when she became widowed or divorced <b>may be married</b> immediately, as it may be assumed that the couple did not have relations during the period of their betrothal. This is <b>except for a betrothed woman in Judea, because</b> there the bridegroom’s <b>heart is bold,</b> as it was customary for couples to be alone together during the period of betrothal, and consequently there is a suspicion that they might have had relations, in which case she might be carrying his child. However, no similar concern applies in other places.

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: All the women</b> listed above <b>may be betrothed</b> immediately, because the decree applies only with regard to marriage; this is <b>except for a widow,</b> who must wait for a different reason, <b>because</b> of the <b>mourning</b> for her deceased husband.

### Part 17
<b>And we said</b> with regard to this: It once happened that <b>Rabbi Eliezer did not come to the study hall. He met Rabbi Asi, who was standing,</b> and <b>said to him: What did they say</b> today <b>in the study hall? He said to him</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> Rabbi Eliezer asked: <b>By inference,</b> can it be inferred from the fact that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his opinion that only <b>a single</b> authority <b>disagrees with him?</b>

### Part 18
Rabbi Asi answered: <b>Yes, and</b> so <b>it was taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> a woman <b>was eager to go to her father’s house</b> and did not remain with her husband during his final days, <b>or</b> if she <b>was angry with her husband</b> and they separated, <b>or</b> if <b>her husband was elderly or sick</b> and could not father children, <b>or</b> if <b>she was sick,</b> or <b>barren,</b> or <b>an elderly woman,</b> or <b>a minor, or a sexually underdeveloped woman</b> who is incapable of bearing children, <b>or a woman who was unfit to give birth</b> for any other reason, <b>or</b> if <b>her husband was imprisoned in jail,</b> or if <b>she had miscarried after the death of her husband,</b> so that there is no longer any concern that she might be pregnant from him, <b>all</b> these women <b>must wait three months</b> before remarrying or even becoming betrothed; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that this decree applies to all women, even when the particular situation renders it unnecessary. In all these cases <b>Rabbi Yosei permits</b> the woman <b>to be betrothed and to marry immediately.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara resumes its question: <b>Why do I need</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan to state that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabbi Yosei? <b>Didn’t you say:</b> In a dispute between <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> and therefore the <i>halakha</i> should be in accordance with him here as well? This implies that the principle is not to be relied upon.

### Part 20
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>What is the difficulty</b> here? <b>Perhaps</b> this ruling <b>comes to exclude</b> what <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> Although there are many cases in which the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, nonetheless, the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabbi Meir with respect to his decrees,</b> i.e., in those cases where he imposed a restriction in a particular case due to its similarity to another case. For this reason Rabbi Yoḥanan had to say that the <i>halakha</i> here is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, notwithstanding its opposition to Rabbi Meir’s decree.

### Part 21
<b>Rather,</b> the proof that these principles do not apply is <b>from that which was taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may go to a fair of</b> idolatrous <b>gentiles and buy animals, slaves, and maidservants from them,</b> as the purchase raises them to a more sanctified state; and he may buy <b>houses, fields, and vineyards</b> from them, due to the mitzva to settle Eretz Yisrael; <b>and he may write</b> the necessary deeds <b>and confirm</b> them <b>in their</b> gentile <b>courts</b> with an official seal, even though this involves an acknowledgement of their authority, <b>because it is as though he were rescuing</b> his property <b>from their hands,</b> as the court’s confirmation and stamp of approval prevents the sellers from appealing the sale and retracting it.

### Part 22
<b>And if he is a priest, he may become ritually impure</b> by going <b>outside Eretz</b> Yisrael, where the earth and air are impure, in order <b>to litigate</b> with them <b>and to contest</b> their claims. <b>And just as</b> a priest <b>may become ritually impure</b> by going <b>outside Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>so may he become ritually impure</b> for this purpose by entering <b>into a cemetery.</b>

### Part 23
The Gemara interrupts its presentation of the <i>baraita</i> to express surprise at this last ruling: <b>Can it enter your mind</b> to say that a priest may enter <b>a cemetery?</b> This would make him <b>ritually impure by Torah law.</b> How could the Sages permit a priest to become ritually impure by Torah law?

### Part 24
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>an area where there is uncertainty with regard to the location of a grave or a corpse [<i>beit haperas</i>],</b> owing to the fact that a grave had been unwittingly plowed over, and the bones may have become scattered throughout the field. Such a field imparts ritual impurity only <b>by rabbinic law.</b>

### Part 25
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> a priest <b>may</b> likewise <b>become ritually impure</b> and leave Eretz Yisrael in order <b>to marry a woman or to study Torah</b> there. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> does this allowance apply? When <b>he cannot find</b> a place <b>to study</b> in Eretz Yisrael. <b>But</b> if the priest can find a place <b>to study</b> in Eretz Yisrael, <b>he may not become ritually impure</b> by leaving the country.

### Part 26
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even when he can find</b> a place <b>to study</b> Torah in Eretz Yisrael, <b>he may also</b> leave the country and <b>become ritually impure, because</b>
