### Part 1
The Gemara explains: Rav Ḥinnana <b>maintains that from</b> the fact that <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna, was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> it can be inferred that <b>the first clause</b> was <b>likewise</b> taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. But</b> in fact <b>that is not so: The latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, while the first clause</b> is in accordance with that of <b>the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 2
We learned in the mishna: One may move objects in a public domain when he is standing in a private domain, <b>provided that he does not carry</b> them <b>beyond</b> four cubits in the public domain. The Gemara infers: This teaching indicates that if <b>he carried</b> them beyond four cubits, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>this</b> ruling <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, as Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>one who carries an object</b> in a public domain <b>from the beginning of four</b> cubits <b>to the end of</b> those <b>four</b> cubits, even if he <b>carried it above his head,</b> i.e., he lifted the object above his head so that it passed through an exempt place, <b>he is</b> nonetheless <b>liable</b> for carrying four cubits in a public domain. Here, too, although he is standing in an elevated private domain and carries the object at that elevated height, he is still liable.

### Part 3
The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>Is</b> the mishna <b>teaching</b> that <b>if he carried</b> the object beyond four cubits <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering? Perhaps</b> the mishna means: <b>If he carried</b> the object beyond four cubits, he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a sin-offering, <b>but it is</b> nevertheless <b>prohibited</b> by rabbinic decree to do so.

### Part 4
<b>Some say</b> a different version of the previous discussion: The Gemara’s initial inference was actually that if <b>he carried</b> the object beyond four cubits he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a sin-offering, <b>but it is prohibited</b> by rabbinic decree to do so. The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let us say</b> that this <b>is a conclusive refutation of Rava’s</b> opinion, <b>as Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>one who carries</b> an object in a public domain <b>from the beginning of four</b> cubits <b>to the end of</b> those <b>four</b> cubits, even if he <b>carried it above his head, he is liable.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Is</b> the mishna <b>teaching</b> that <b>if he took</b> it beyond four cubits he is <b>exempt, but it is prohibited</b> to do so? <b>Perhaps</b> the <i>tanna</i> means that <b>if he carried</b> it beyond four cubits, he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b>

### Part 5
The mishna states: <b>A person</b> may <b>not stand in a private domain</b> and urinate or spit into the public domain. <b>Rav Yosef said: One who urinated or spat</b> in this manner is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> for an act of carrying to be considered a prohibited Shabbat labor that entails liability, <b>we require</b> that the <b>lifting and placing</b> of the object be performed <b>from atop an area four</b> by four handbreadths, the minimal size of significance with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of carrying on Shabbat. <b>And</b> that is <b>not</b> the case here, as one’s mouth, which produces the spittle, is not four by four handbreadths in size.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: One’s <b>intent renders it an area</b> of significance, i.e., as one certainly considers his mouth a significant area, it is regarded as four by four handbreadths in size. <b>As, if you do not say so,</b> that the size of an area is not the sole criterion, but that a person’s thoughts can also establish a place as significant, there is a difficulty with <b>that</b> which <b>Rava said:</b> If <b>a person threw</b> an object <b>and it landed in the mouth of a dog or in the mouth of a furnace,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering. But don’t we require</b> that the object be <b>placed on an area of four</b> by four handbreadths? <b>And</b> that is <b>not</b> the case here.

### Part 8
<b>Rather,</b> the person’s <b>intent</b> to throw the object into the dog’s mouth <b>renders it an area</b> of significance. <b>Here too, his intent renders</b> his own mouth <b>a</b> significant <b>area.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rava raised a dilemma:</b> If <b>one</b> is standing <b>in a private domain, and the opening of his</b> male <b>member is in the public domain,</b> and he urinates, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? How should this case be regarded? Do <b>we follow</b> the domain where the urine is <b>uprooted</b> from the body, i.e., the bladder, which is in the private domain? <b>Or</b> do <b>we follow the</b> point of the urine’s actual <b>emission</b> from the body, and since the urine leaves his body through the opening of his member in the public domain, no prohibition has been violated? Since this dilemma was not resolved, the Gemara concludes: <b>Let it stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 10
The mishna states: <b>And likewise, one</b> may <b>not spit</b> from one domain to another. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Once a person’s spittle is gathered in his mouth, he may not walk four cubits in the public domain until he removes it. The Gemara asks: Does this teaching mean that it is prohibited to do so <b>even if he has not turned</b> the spittle <b>over</b> in his mouth, i.e., after he has dredged up the saliva but before he has rolled it around in his mouth in preparation to spit it out?

### Part 11
<b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna the <i>halakha</i> of one who <b>was eating a dried fig</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>with unwashed hands?</b> By Torah law, only food that has come into contact with a liquid is susceptible to ritual impurity, and no liquid had ever fallen on this fig. The significance of the fact that his hands are unwashed is that by rabbinic law, unwashed hands have second degree ritual impurity status and therefore invalidate <i>teruma</i>. If this person <b>inserted his hand into his mouth to remove a pebble, Rabbi Meir deems</b> the dried fig <b>impure,</b> as it had been rendered liable to contract impurity by the spittle in the person’s mouth, and it subsequently became impure when it was touched by his unwashed hand. <b>And Rabbi Yosei deems</b> the fig <b>ritually pure,</b> as he maintains that spittle which is still in one’s mouth is not considered liquid that renders food liable to contract impurity; the spittle does so only after it has left the mouth.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that there is a distinction between the cases: If <b>he turned</b> the spittle <b>over</b> in his mouth, it is like spittle that has been detached from its place, and therefore its legal status is that of a liquid, which means the fig is <b>impure.</b> However, if <b>he</b> had <b>not</b> yet <b>turned</b> the spittle <b>over</b> in his mouth, the fig is <b>pure.</b> This indicates that according to Rabbi Yehuda, spittle that has not yet been turned over in one’s mouth is not considered detached.

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The</b> attribution of the <b>opinions is reversed,</b> as the opinion attributed to Rabbi Yehuda is actually that of a different <i>tanna</i>, while Rabbi Yehuda himself maintains that the fig is ritually impure in either case.

### Part 14
<b>Reish Lakish said: Actually, do not reverse</b> the opinions, <b>and</b> the apparent contradiction can be reconciled in accordance with the original version of the text: <b>With what we are dealing here</b> in the mishna? We are dealing <b>with his phlegm</b> that is expelled through coughing.

### Part 15
The Gemara raises a difficulty against this resolution. <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If <b>one’s phlegm was detached,</b> he may not walk four cubits in the public domain with it in his mouth? <b>What, is it not</b> the case that this <i>halakha</i> refers to <b>spittle that was detached?</b> The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>No,</b> this ruling applies only to <b>one’s phlegm that was detached.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If <b>one’s phlegm was detached, and likewise,</b> if <b>his spittle was detached, he</b> may <b>not walk four cubits</b> in the public domain <b>before he spits</b> it out, even if he has not yet turned it over. <b>Rather, it is clear as we originally answered,</b> that the opinions in the mishna with regard to spittle and ritual impurity must be reversed.

### Part 16
Having mentioned phlegm, the Gemara cites a related teaching: <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> One who expelled <b>phlegm in front of his master</b> has acted in a disrespectful manner and is <b>liable for</b> the punishment of <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>as it is stated: “All they who hate Me love death”</b> (Proverbs 8:36). <b>Do not read it</b> as: <b>“They who hate [<i>mesanai</i>] Me”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>“Those who make themselves hateful [<i>masniai</i>] to Me,”</b> i.e., those who make themselves hateful by such a discharge.

### Part 17
The Gemara expresses surprise at this ruling: <b>But doesn’t he</b> do so <b>involuntarily,</b> as no one coughs and emits phlegm by choice; why should this be considered a transgression? The Gemara answers: <b>We are speaking</b> here of someone who had <b>phlegm</b> in his mouth <b>and spat</b> it out, i.e., one who had the opportunity to leave his master’s presence and spit outside.

### Part 18
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person</b> may <b>stand in a private domain</b> and extend his head <b>and drink in a public domain,</b> and he may stand <b>in a public domain and drink in a private domain, only if he brings his head and most of his</b> body <b>into the domain</b> in <b>which he drinks. And the same</b> applies <b>in a winepress,</b> as will be explained in the Gemara.

### Part 19
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara registers surprise at the mishna: It would seem that <b>the first clause,</b> i.e., the previous mishna, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that a person located in one domain is permitted to move objects in another domain, <b>whereas the latter clause,</b> i.e., this mishna, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that it is prohibited for a person in one domain to move objects in a different domain.

### Part 20
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This mishna is referring <b>to objects that one needs, and</b> the ruling is accepted by <b>all.</b> In this case, even the Rabbis concede that it is prohibited to move objects in another domain, lest one absent-mindedly draw the objects to him and thereby violate a Torah prohibition.

### Part 21
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one of the domains is a <b><i>karmelit</i>, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Abaye said: This</b> case <b>is</b> equal <b>to that</b> case, i.e., in this situation a <i>karmelit</i> is governed by the same <i>halakha</i> that applies to a domain defined by Torah law. Just as the Sages prohibited one in the private domain from drinking from the public domain and vice versa, so too, they prohibited one in a <i>karmelit</i> from drinking in the same manner. <b>Rava said:</b> How can you say so? The prohibition against carrying to or from a <i>karmelit</i> is <b>itself</b> a rabbinic <b>decree. And will we</b> then <b>proceed to issue a decree to</b> prevent violation of another <b>decree?</b>

### Part 22
<b>Abaye said</b> in explanation of his opinion: <b>From where do I say that</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it is taught</b> in the mishna:
