### Part 1
If <b>one ate a <i>putita</i>,</b> a certain water insect, <b>he is given four</b> sets of <b>lashes,</b> as he has transgressed four separate negative Torah commandments, two that relate to creeping animals in general and two that relate to water insects in particular. If he ate <b>an ant, he is given five</b> sets of <b>lashes</b> for violating the two general prohibitions and another three negative commandments stated with regard to insects that creep upon the earth. If he ate <b>a hornet, he is given six</b> sets of <b>lashes,</b> for in addition to the prohibitions applying to an ant, he has transgressed a prohibition stated with regard to flying insects. <b>And if it is</b> correct that something that lives in water is considered as growing from the ground, one who eats <b>a <i>putita</i> should also be given lashes for</b> violating the following prohibition: “And <b>every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth</b> is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41). Rather, fish must certainly not be considered as growing from the ground, and therefore this explanation is to be rejected.

### Part 2
<b>Rather, Ravina said: There is</b> a practical difference <b>between</b> the two <i>baraitot</i> with regard to <b>fowl. According to the one who said</b> that one may use second-tithe money only to purchase food which is <b>the produce of produce and grown from the ground, these</b> fowl <b>are also</b> regarded as having <b>grown from the ground.</b> However, <b>according to the one who said</b> that we apply it to that which is <b>the offspring of the offspring of the earth, these fowl were created from mud</b> and not from the ground, and consequently they are not included among the items that may be bought with second-tithe money.

### Part 3
These two distinct opinions are both based upon the exegetical principle of a generalization and a detail. The Gemara now asks: <b>What is the reason of the one who includes fowl, and what is the reason of the one who excludes fowl?</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara explains: <b>The one who includes fowl holds</b> that when there is a generalization, a detail, and another generalization, <b>the latter generalization is primary.</b> Therefore, the rule is similar to that governing <b>a detail</b> followed by <b>a generalization,</b> which maintains that <b>the generalization is considered an addition to the detail, and all</b> other <b>items are included.</b> However, <b>the first generalization is effective in excluding anything that is not similar to</b> it <b>in two respects,</b> as it is nonetheless a case of a generalization, a detail, and a generalization. Therefore, he excludes anything that does not grow from the ground and is not the produce of produce.

### Part 5
<b>And the one who excludes fowl holds</b> that <b>the first generalization is primary.</b> Therefore, a generalization, detail, and generalization is similar to a single <b>generalization</b> that is followed by <b>a detail,</b> with regard to which we maintain that <b>the generalization only includes that which is</b> spelled out <b>in the detail.</b> Therefore, with regard to <b>these</b> items mentioned in the verse, <b>yes,</b> one may purchase them with second-tithe money. With regard to <b>something else, no,</b> one may not. However, <b>the latter generalization is effective to include anything that is similar to it in three respects,</b> namely, it is the produce of produce, grows from the ground, and is offspring of the offspring of the earth, to the exclusion of fowl.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat,</b> who said <b>in the name</b> of <b>Rav: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> with cheap and unimportant produce such as <b>cress, purslane, and sweet clover, but</b> one may <b>not</b> establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with green grain or with unripe dates.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But may one establish an <i>eiruv</i> with sweet clover? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to <b>sweet clover</b> that <b>those who have many children may eat</b> it, but <b>those without children may not eat</b> it, as it is harmful to one’s reproductive capacity; <b>and if it was hardened into seed,</b> i.e., if it became very hard and already fit to be planted, <b>even those who have many children may not eat</b> it? Therefore, we see that it is prohibited to eat sweet clover. How can it possibly be used to establish an <i>eiruv</i>?

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>Interpret</b> Rav’s statement as referring to sweet clover <b>that was not</b> yet <b>hardened into seed, and</b> its use for establishing an <i>eiruv</i> is limited to <b>those who have many children</b> and are therefore permitted to eat it.

### Part 9
<b>And if you wish,</b> you can <b>say</b> instead that <b>actually,</b> sweet clover is fit for an <i>eiruv</i> even <b>for those without children because it is fit</b> to be eaten by <b>those who have many children.</b> The food used for an <i>eiruv</i> must be edible, but it does not need to be edible for the particular person using it as his <i>eiruv</i>. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for a nazirite with wine, and for an Israelite with <i>teruma</i>? Apparently,</b> these items may be used as an <i>eiruv</i> <b>even though</b> they <b>are not fit for this</b> person, because they are <b>fit for that</b> other person. <b>Here too, even though</b> the sweet clover <b>is not fit for this</b> person, it may be used because <b>it is fit for that</b> other person.

### Part 10
<b>And if you wish,</b> you can <b>say</b> instead: <b>When Rav said</b> that sweet clover may be used for an <i>eiruv</i>, he was referring to <b>Median clover,</b> which is of superior quality and is not harmful.

### Part 11
The Gemara considers the continuation of Rav’s statement: <b>And</b> may one <b>not</b> establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with green grain? Didn’t Rav Yehuda say that Rav said:</b> In the case of <b>dodder and green grain, one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with them; and</b> when eating <b>them one recites the blessing: Who creates the fruit of the ground?</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> first statement, according to which green grain may not be used for an <i>eiruv</i>, was made <b>before Rav came to Babylonia. That</b> second statement was made <b>after Rav came to Babylonia</b> and saw that people there ate green grain, at which point he ruled that it is fit to be used for an <i>eiruv</i>.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>Is Babylonia the majority of the world?</b> Laws are established according to the custom prevalent in most of the world. <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>beans, barley, and fenugreek that</b> one <b>planted</b> in order to use <b>as an herb,</b> e.g., as animal fodder, <b>his opinion is rendered irrelevant by the opinions of all other people?</b> Since most people do not act this way, we do not consider this particular person’s intention to be significant. <b>Therefore, one is obligated</b> to tithe <b>their seeds, and their herbs are exempt.</b> When one harvests these plants in their green state, before their seeds have matured, they are regarded as not having fully ripened. However, in the case of <b>cress and arugula,</b> which are commonly eaten both in their green state and as seeds, if <b>one planted them</b> in order to use them <b>as herbs, they are tithed</b> both <b>as herbs and as seeds;</b> if <b>one planted them for</b> their <b>seeds, they are tithed as seeds and as herbs,</b> no matter how they are eaten. In any case, the first part of the <i>baraita</i> teaches that the law is determined in accordance with the common custom of most of the world and not with the practice in one particular place.

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: <b>When Rav said</b> that green grain may be used for an <i>eiruv</i>,
