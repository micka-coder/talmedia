### Part 1
<b>And the Rabbis</b> hold that <b>there,</b> the first day is not observed as a Festival by Torah law but due to rabbinic decree, <b>so that</b> people <b>will not demean</b> the day in future years and end up desecrating the Festival should the witnesses come on time. However, by Torah law it is an ordinary weekday, and therefore one can establish two separate <i>eiruvin</i> for the two days.

### Part 2
We learned in the mishna that in addition to his ruling with regard to <i>eiruvin</i> for the two days of Rosh HaShana, <b>Rabbi Yehuda said further</b> that the two days can be split with regard to a basket of <i>tevel</i> produce and an egg laid on the first day of the Festival.

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: <b>And it</b> was <b>necessary</b> to teach us all three laws, as they could not have been derived from one another. <b>As, if he had</b> only <b>taught us</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to establishing an <i>eiruv</i> for the two days of <b>Rosh HaShana,</b> one might have said that only <b>in this</b> case does <b>Rabbi Yehuda say</b> his ruling <b>because</b> in this case <b>one does not</b> actually <b>do anything</b> on the Festival itself. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a basket, where it appears as though one is rendering <i>tevel</i> fit</b> on a Festival, <b>say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>concedes to the Rabbis</b> that it is decreed prohibited.

### Part 4
<b>And had he taught us</b> only <b>these two</b> <i>halakhot</i>, we might have said that Rabbi Yehuda is lenient <b>because there is no</b> reason <b>to issue a decree</b> prohibiting <b>them,</b> as the potential prohibitions involved are not so severe. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>an egg</b> that was laid on the first day of a Festival, <b>where there is</b> reason <b>to issue a decree</b> prohibiting <b>it,</b> as explained in tractate <i>Beitza</i>, <b>because of fruit that fall</b> from a tree or <b>due to liquids that oozed</b> from fruit on a Festival, both of which the Sages prohibited as a safeguard against violating Torah prohibitions, <b>say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>concedes to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> which maintains that this egg may not be eaten even on the second day of the Festival. It was therefore <b>necessary</b> to teach us all three cases.

### Part 5
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How</b> is one to carry out what <b>Rabbi Yehuda said,</b> that <b>a person</b> may <b>make a condition</b> with regard to <b>a basket</b> of <i>tevel</i> produce <b>on the first day of the Festival and</b> then <b>eat</b> the produce <b>on the second</b> day? If <b>there were two baskets of <i>tevel</i></b> produce <b>before him, he says</b> as follows: <b>If today is</b> an ordinary <b>weekday and tomorrow is sanctified, let this</b> basket <b>be <i>teruma</i> for that</b> basket; <b>and if today is sanctified and tomorrow</b> is an ordinary <b>weekday, my statement has no</b> significance. <b>And he bestows upon</b> the basket <b>the name</b> of <i>teruma</i>, <b>and sets it aside.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And on the next day he says</b> as follows: <b>If today is</b> an ordinary <b>weekday, let this</b> basket <b>be <i>teruma</i> for that</b> basket; <b>and if today is sanctified, my statement has no</b> significance. <b>And He bestows upon</b> the basket <b>the name</b> of <i>teruma</i>, <b>and</b> he may then <b>eat</b> the produce in the other basket, as <i>teruma</i> has definitely been separated on a weekday. <b>Rabbi Yosei prohibits</b> this. <b>And, so too, Rabbi Yosei would prohibit</b> this procedure even <b>on the two Festival days of the Diaspora,</b> even though the second day is only observed because of a doubt as to the proper day on which to observe the Festival.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates that <b>a particular young deer was brought to the house of the Exilarch.</b> The deer <b>was trapped</b> by a gentile <b>on the first day of a Festival</b> observed <b>in the Diaspora and slaughtered on the second day of the Festival.</b> The question arose whether it was permitted to eat it, based on the fact that one of these two days was certainly an ordinary weekday.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Naḥman and Rav Ḥisda ate</b> from it, but <b>Rav Sheshet did not eat</b> from it. <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> in a jesting manner: <b>What can I do for Rav Sheshet, who does not eat deer meat? Rav Sheshet said to him: How can I eat</b> it, <b>as Isi taught, and some say</b> that this should be read as a question: <b>Didn’t Isi teach: And, so too, Rabbi Yosei would prohibit</b> this procedure even <b>on the two Festival days of the Diaspora?</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rava said: What is the difficulty? Perhaps this is what he said: And, so too, Rabbi Yosei would prohibit</b> this procedure even <b>on the two Festival days of Rosh HaShana in the Diaspora,</b> but with regard to the two days of other Festivals observed in the Diaspora, he too would agree with Rabbi Yehuda and permit it. They said to him: <b>If so,</b> the phrase <b>of the Diaspora</b> is inappropriate. <b>It should have</b> said <b>in the Diaspora.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rav Asi said: What is the difficulty? Perhaps this is what he said: And so too, Rabbi Yosei would treat the prohibition</b> of such a procedure <b>on the two Festival days of the Diaspora as on the two Festival days of Rosh HaShana, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who permit</b> it. In any case, the proof from this <i>baraita</i> is inconclusive.

### Part 11
The Gemara further relates that afterward <b>Rav Sheshet met Rabba bar Shmuel</b> and <b>said to him: Has the Master learned anything with regard to</b> the two <b>sanctities</b> of a Festival and the like? Rabba bar Shmuel <b>said to him: We have learned</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei concedes with regard to the two Festival days of the Diaspora.</b> Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: If you</b> happen to <b>meet</b> Rav Naḥman and Rav Ḥisda, who disagreed with me and ate the deer in the Exilarch’s house, <b>do not tell them anything</b> of what you just told me, lest they use this <i>tannaitic</i> source to embarrass me about my refusal to eat.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Ashi said: Ameimar told me that the deer was not trapped</b> on the Festival;
