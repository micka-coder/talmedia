### Part 1
<b>the inhabitants of Tiberias</b> are considered <b>like one</b> who does so in order <b>not to neglect his</b> usual <b>work.</b> Most of them are ordinary laborers. It can be assumed that if they rose early to bring home straw or stalks in which to store their produce, they did so only to save work time.

### Part 2
The Gemara turns to the third activity that Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya permitted for the inhabitants of Tiberias: <b>And they may dry themselves with a towel. What is</b> this <i>halakha</i>? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person</b> who washed himself in cold water on Shabbat or a Festival <b>may dry himself with a towel and place it on a window,</b> as there is no concern that he perform the prohibited labor of wringing out the towel. <b>And he may not give</b> the towel <b>to the bathhouse attendants [<i>olayerin</i>] because they are suspected with regard to that matter,</b> as they might wring out the towel before giving it to other bathers. Furthermore, one may not bring the towel home because if he does so, he might forget and wring it out. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: He may even bring</b> the towel <b>in his hand to his house,</b> as there is no concern lest he wring it.

### Part 3
<b>Rabba bar Rav Huna: They taught</b> the leniency of partitions surrounding a hole in a balcony <b>only</b> with regard <b>to drawing</b> water through the hole; <b>but to pour</b> waste water down the hole, it is <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Sheizvi raised an objection against this</b> <i>halakha</i>: <b>And what is</b> the difference <b>between this</b> case of a hole in the balcony <b>and</b> that of <b>a pit [<i>uka</i>]</b> used in a courtyard for waste water? The Sages rule in the next mishna below that one who digs a pit with a capacity of two <i>se’a</i> in a small courtyard that is less than four cubits may pour waste water into the courtyard on Shabbat, even if the pit was full before Shabbat. He need not be concerned that this will cause water to flow out of the courtyard into the public domain on Shabbat.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>These</b> waters, which are poured out into the courtyard, <b>are</b> likely to be <b>absorbed</b> into the ground, and it is therefore uncertain that the water will indeed leave the courtyard. <b>But these,</b> the water poured through the hole into the body of water under the balcony, <b>will not be absorbed.</b> Therefore, one knows with certainty that the water will flow out beyond the permitted boundary.

### Part 6
<b>Some say</b> that <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna</b> actually <b>said: You should not say that it is</b> only <b>drawing</b> water through the hole in the balcony <b>that is permitted,</b> while <b>pouring</b> waste water through it <b>is prohibited; rather, pouring</b> waste water through the hole <b>is also permitted. Rav Sheizvi said:</b> This is <b>obvious,</b> as <b>this is</b> exactly the same as the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>pit</b> discussed in the next mishna. The Gemara rejects this argument: It is necessary to specify both <i>halakhot</i>, <b>lest you say</b> there is a difference between the cases, as <b>these,</b> the water poured in the courtyard, <b>are</b> likely to be <b>absorbed</b> into the ground, <b>whereas these,</b> the water poured through the hole in the balcony, <b>will not be absorbed.</b> Rabba bar Rav Huna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that we do not distinguish between the two cases.

### Part 7
We learned in the mishna: <b>And likewise,</b> if there are <b>two balconies, one</b> above the other, and a partition is erected for the upper balcony but is not erected for the lower one, it is prohibited for residents of both balconies to draw water through the upper one, unless they establish a joint <i>eiruv</i> between them. <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: They taught</b> that one balcony renders it prohibited for residents of the other <b>only where</b> the one balcony <b>is near</b> the other, i.e., horizontally within four handbreadths. <b>But</b> if each balcony is <b>separated</b> by four handbreadths from the other, so that the residents of each balcony can use the other only by means of the air, the residents of <b>the upper</b> balcony <b>are permitted</b> to draw water, while the residents of the lower one are prohibited from doing so.

### Part 8
<b>And Rav</b> follows <b>his</b> regular line of <b>argument</b> here, <b>as Rav said: One person does not impose restrictions upon another person by way of the air.</b> Since the lower balcony is far from the higher one, it does not prohibit it, although it can make use of it by means of the vacant airspace between them, albeit with difficulty.

### Part 9
<b>Rabba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said, and Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of <b>stealing applies to Shabbat</b> domains, <b>and a ruin must be returned to its owner.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara registers surprise: <b>This</b> ruling <b>itself is difficult,</b> i.e., it is self-contradictory. <b>You</b> first <b>said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>stealing applies to Shabbat</b> domains, which at this point is understood by the Gemara as referring to the following case: A person’s house adjoins the ruin of another, and he observes that the ruin has been left deserted by its owner. If this person uses the ruin during the week, on Shabbat he may treat it as though it were his own, by carrying objects from his own house into the ruin and vice versa. <b>From here</b> we can infer that a stolen place <b>is acquired</b> for the purpose of Shabbat domains, although it does not belong to the person for other purposes. However, you subsequently said that <b>a ruin must be returned to its owner,</b> and <b>from here</b> we can infer that a ruin <b>is not acquired</b> for the purpose of Shabbat domains by the person who used it during the week, and therefore he may not carry objects from his own house into the ruin.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: We should not understand this statement as suggested above, but rather <b>this is</b> what Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Oshaya <b>are saying: The <i>halakha</i> of</b> returning <b>stolen</b> property <b>applies to Shabbat</b> domains. <b>How so?</b> This means <b>that a ruin must be returned to its owner.</b> In other words, one who uses a ruin during the week does not acquire it even for the purpose of Shabbat domains.

### Part 12
<b>Rabba said: And we</b> ourselves <b>raised an objection</b> against <b>our</b> own <b>teaching,</b> as we learned in the mishna. <b>And likewise,</b> if there are <b>two balconies, one above the other,</b> they prohibit one another. <b>But if you say</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> against <b>stealing applies on Shabbat,</b> which means one may not use the domain of another, and he acquires no rights to it if he does so, <b>why</b> are the two balconies <b>prohibited</b> from using it. The lower one has no right to make use of the upper one.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Sheshet said: We are dealing here with</b> a situation <b>where, for example,</b> the residents of the upper balcony and the residents of the lower balcony <b>jointly erected a partition</b> for the upper balcony. Consequently, the residents of the lower balcony share the right to use it with the residents of the upper one.

### Part 14
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> in a case <b>where they erected</b> a separate partition <b>for the lower</b> balcony, the residents of the upper balcony should <b>likewise</b> be prohibited to use it. As the residents of the lower one are partners in the upper one, they should prohibit its residents from using it.

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: <b>Since they erected</b> a separate partition <b>for the lower</b> balcony, <b>they</b> each thereby <b>revealed their intention</b> to the residents of the upper balcony <b>that: It is not my wish to be</b> partners <b>with you.</b> Consequently, they no longer prohibit the residents of the upper balcony from using it.

### Part 16
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a courtyard that is less than four cubits</b> by four cubits in area, <b>one may not pour</b> waste <b>water into it on Shabbat, unless a pit was fashioned</b> to receive the water, and the pit <b>holds two <i>se’a</i></b> in volume <b>from its edge below.</b>

### Part 17
This <i>halakha</i> applies <b>whether</b> the pit was fashioned <b>outside</b> the courtyard <b>or</b> whether it was dug <b>inside</b> the courtyard itself. The <b>only</b> difference is as follows: <b>If</b> the pit was dug <b>outside</b> in the adjoining public domain, <b>it is necessary to arch over</b> it, so that the water will not flow into the public domain. If it was dug <b>inside</b> the courtyard, <b>it is not necessary to arch over</b> it.

### Part 18
<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> In the case of a drainage <b>ditch whose</b> first <b>four cubits are arched over in the public domain, one may pour</b> waste <b>water into it on Shabbat. And the Rabbis say: Even</b> if <b>a roof or a courtyard</b> is <b>a hundred cubits</b> in area, <b>one may not pour</b> water directly <b>onto the mouth of the</b> drainage <b>ditch. However, he may pour</b> it <b>upon the roof,</b> from which <b>the water spills into the drain</b> of its own accord.

### Part 19
<b>A courtyard and a portico,</b> a roofed but unwalled structure in front of a house, <b>combine for the four cubits</b> by virtue of which it is permitted to pour water even into a courtyard that lacks a pit. <b>And likewise,</b> with regard to <b>two upper stories [<i>deyotaot</i>], one opposite the other</b> in the same small courtyard, if the residents of <b>one</b> of them <b>fashioned a pit</b> in the courtyard, <b>and</b> the residents of <b>the other did not fashion a pit, those who fashioned a pit are permitted</b> to pour their waste water into the courtyard, whereas <b>those who did not fashion a pit are prohibited</b> to do so.

### Part 20
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that a courtyard four by four cubits in area does not require a pit? <b>Rabba said: Because a person ordinarily uses two <i>se’a</i> of water a day,</b> and with regard to a courtyard <b>of</b> at least <b>four cubits</b> by four cubits, <b>a person wants to sprinkle</b> the water on the ground to prevent any dust from rising. Consequently, even if in practice the water does flow out of the courtyard, this effect is not necessarily his intention.
