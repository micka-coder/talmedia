### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: Does this mean that in <b>a place where he extended</b> the limit, <b>yes,</b> the surveyor’s measurements are accepted, but in <b>a place where he reduced</b> the limit, <b>no,</b> his measurements are not accepted? If his extended measurement is accepted, his shortened measurement should certainly be accepted as well. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the mishna means that the surveyor’s measurements are accepted <b>even</b> in <b>a place where he extended</b> the limit, without concern that he might have erred (<i>Tosafot</i>), and that the surveyor’s measurements are certainly accepted in places where he reduced the Shabbat limit.

### Part 2
We learned in the mishna: If the surveyor <b>extended</b> the limit <b>for one and reduced</b> it <b>for another,</b> one accepts the extended measurement. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I need this as well? This</b> clause <b>is the same as that</b> previous clause in the mishna. The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>said:</b> If two surveyors measured the Shabbat limit and <b>one extended</b> the Shabbat limit <b>and one reduced</b> it, <b>one accepts</b> the measurements of <b>the</b> surveyor <b>who extended</b> it.

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said:</b> The measurements of the surveyor who extended the limit are accepted only <b>as long as he does not extend</b> the limit <b>more than</b> the difference between <b>the measure</b> of the Shabbat limit <b>of the city</b> calculated <b>as a diagonal</b> line from the corner of the city and as calculated as a straight line from the side of the city. If, however, the difference in measurements exceeds that amount, the Shabbat limit must be measured again.

### Part 4
We learned in the mishna: <b>As the Sages did not state the matter,</b> the laws of Shabbat limits, <b>to be stringent, but</b> rather <b>to be lenient.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t</b> the opposite <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Sages did not state the matter,</b> the laws of Shabbat limits, <b>to be lenient but</b> rather <b>to be stringent?</b>

### Part 5
<b>Ravina said</b> that there is no contradiction between these two statements: The very institution of Shabbat limits was enacted <b>not to be</b> more <b>lenient</b> than <b>Torah law,</b> but <b>rather to be stringent</b> beyond <b>Torah law.</b> Nonetheless, since <b>Shabbat limits are rabbinic law,</b> the Sages permitted certain leniencies with regard to how the Shabbat limits are measured.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Although this chapter as a whole deals with <i>halakhot</i> governing the joining of Shabbat boundaries, this mishna returns to the <i>halakhot</i> governing a joining of courtyards. If <b>a private city,</b> which does not have many residents, grows and <b>becomes</b> a heavily populated <b>public</b> city, <b>one may establish a joining of the courtyards for all of it,</b> as long as it does not include a public domain as defined by Torah law.

### Part 7
<b>And</b> if <b>a public</b> city loses residents over time and <b>becomes a private</b> city, <b>one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for all of it unless one maintains</b> an area <b>outside</b> the <i>eiruv</i> that is <b>like</b> the size of <b>the city of Ḥadasha in Judea, which has fifty residents.</b> Carrying within the <i>eiruv</i> is permitted, but it remains prohibited to carry in the area excluded from the <i>eiruv</i>. The reason for this requirement is to ensure that the laws of <i>eiruv</i> will not be forgotten. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The excluded area need not be so large; rather, it is sufficient to exclude <b>three courtyards</b> with <b>two houses</b> each.

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>a private city</b> that <b>becomes a public</b> city? <b>Rav Yehuda said: For example, the Exilarch’s village [<i>de’iskarta</i>]</b> was a small village set aside for the Exilarch’s family and attendants; since it was frequented by many people, it turned into a public city.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Naḥman said to him: What is the reason</b> for bringing this example? <b>If you say</b> that <b>because</b> large numbers of people <b>are to be found at</b> the residence of <b>the governor [<i>harmana</i>]</b> in order to request licenses and authorizations, and <b>they remind each other</b> of the reason it is permissible to establish an <i>eiruv</i> there, and consequently they will not arrive at mistaken conclusions with regard to other places, then every city should have the same status, as <b>the entire Jewish people are also found together on Shabbat morning</b> when they come to pray. <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said: For example, the village of Natzu’i</b> was a private city belonging to a single individual before a large influx of residents turned it into a public city.

### Part 10
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a private city becomes public, and</b> a bona fide <b>public domain passes through it, how does one establish an <i>eiruv</i> for it? He places a side post from here,</b> one side of the public domain, <b>and side post from there,</b> the other side; <b>or,</b> he places a cross <b>beam from here,</b> one side of the public domain, <b>and</b> another cross <b>beam from there,</b> the other side. <b>He may</b> then <b>carry</b> items <b>and place</b> them <b>between</b> these symbolic partitions, as the public domain is now considered like one of the courtyards of the city. <b>And one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for half</b> the city; <b>rather,</b> one may establish <b>either</b> one <i>eiruv</i> for <b>all of it or</b> separate ones for <b>each alleyway separately</b> without including the other sections of the city.

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If <b>it was</b> originally <b>a public</b> city, <b>and it</b> remains <b>a public</b> city,
