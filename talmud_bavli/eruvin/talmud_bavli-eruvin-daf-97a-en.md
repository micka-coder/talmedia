### Part 1
and <b>whether</b> the phylacteries are <b>new or old;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda prohibits</b> carrying <b>new</b> phylacteries <b>but permits</b> carrying <b>old ones. Apparently,</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>a person exerts</b> himself to fashion an amulet that looks like phylacteries, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that <b>a person does not exert</b> himself for this purpose, and therefore something that has the appearance of phylacteries must be phylacteries.

### Part 2
<b><i>Shin</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>tzadi</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>ayin</i>, <i>tzadi</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>yod</i></b> is a <b>mnemonic</b> for the statements that follow. The Gemara adds: <b>And now that the father of Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak has taught</b> that <b>these are</b> deemed <b>old</b> phylacteries: <b>Any that have straps that</b> are permanently <b>tied</b> in the manner of phylacteries, and <b>new</b> phylacteries are those <b>that have straps that are not tied,</b> the conclusion is <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>a person does not exert</b> himself to fashion an amulet similar to phylacteries or string-like ritual fringes. They disagree with regard to new phylacteries that are not tied properly and cannot be donned in a manner typical of a weekday. The reason is that tying a permanent knot on Shabbat is prohibited by Torah law. Therefore, these phylacteries may not be donned, and Rabbi Zeira’s opinion is accepted.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion that new phylacteries may not be brought into town because they lack a permanent knot: Why must one tie the phylacteries with a knot? <b>Let him</b> simply <b>tie a bow,</b> which is not prohibited on Shabbat, and place the phylacteries on his head and arm in that manner. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: That is to say</b> that <b>a bow is invalid for phylacteries,</b> as a proper knot is required.

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said:</b> This is not the correct interpretation. Rather, <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> conforms to <b>his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he said: A bow is a full-fledged knot,</b> and it is prohibited to tie it on Shabbat by Torah law.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>The reason</b> that it is prohibited to tie a bow is <b>that a bow is a full-fledged knot.</b> If <b>that were not so,</b> one could <b>tie</b> the phylacteries <b>with a bow. But didn’t Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, say in the name of Rav:</b> The form of the permanent <b>knot of phylacteries is a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai; and Rav Naḥman said: And their decorative</b> side, the side of the knot where the shape of the letter appears, must face <b>outward.</b> Apparently, a bow does not suffice for phylacteries, as an actual knot is required.

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects this contention: It is referring to a case <b>where one tied a bow similar</b> in form <b>to a</b> permanent <b>knot,</b> without actually tying a permanent knot.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Rav said: One who purchases</b> a large quantity of <b>phylacteries from one who is not an expert,</b> i.e., a person who has not proven to be a reliable manufacturer of phylacteries, the purchaser <b>examines two</b> phylacteries <b>of the arm and one of the head, or two of the head and one of the arm,</b> to see if they are valid and the individual reliable. If the three phylacteries are found to be valid upon examination, the seller is considered an expert and the rest of the phylacteries are presumed valid as well.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Whichever way you look at it,</b> this ruling is problematic: <b>If</b> the buyer <b>purchased</b> all of the phylacteries <b>from one person,</b> who acquired them from somebody else, <b>let him examine three</b> phylacteries <b>of the arm or three of the head,</b> in accordance with the principle that presumptive status is established after three instances.

### Part 9
<b>If he purchased</b> the phylacteries <b>from two</b> or <b>three people, each and every one</b> of the phylacteries <b>should require examination.</b> The presumptive status of one pair of phylacteries does not apply to the others, as they might have been produced by a different person. The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> this refers to a case where the buyer <b>bought</b> the phylacteries <b>from one person, and we require</b> that the seller prove himself <b>to be an expert with regard to</b> both the phylactery <b>of the arm and</b> the phylactery <b>of the head.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rabba bar Shmuel teach</b> that <b>with</b> regard to <b>phylacteries one examines three of the arm and</b> three <b>of the head? What, is it not</b> that he examines <b>either three</b> phylacteries <b>of the arm or three of the head?</b> The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>No,</b> it means that he examines <b>three</b> phylacteries in total, <b>among them</b> phylacteries <b>of the arm and among them</b> phylacteries <b>of the head,</b> as stated by Rav Ḥisda in the name of Rav.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rav Kahana teach</b> that <b>with</b> regard to <b>phylacteries one examines two of the arm and</b> two <b>of the head?</b> This statement certainly contradicts Rav’s opinion. The Gemara explains: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said: Presumptive status is</b> established <b>by two times.</b> Although most Sages maintain that it takes three instances to establish a presumptive status, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi rules that two cases suffice. Consequently, in the case of phylacteries, it is sufficient to examine two.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> this ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>say the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>And</b> he must <b>likewise</b> examine <b>the second bundle</b> of phylacteries, <b>and likewise the third bundle. And if it is</b> in accordance with <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion, <b>is he of</b> the opinion that <b>a third</b> examination is necessary? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi does not require a third examination to establish a presumptive status, as he maintains that the examination of two bundles suffices.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>concedes with regard to bundles, as one buys</b> them <b>from two</b> or <b>three</b> different <b>people.</b> It can be assumed that the various bundles of phylacteries were not all manufactured by the same person. Consequently, the validity of one bundle does not establish a presumption with regard to another. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, even</b> the <b>fourth</b> bundle must be examined <b>as well, and even</b> the <b>fifth as well.</b> If the bundles were bought from different manufacturers, every one of them requires examination, not only the third.

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so;</b> this is how one must proceed. <b>And</b> the reason <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>teaches three</b> bundles rather than four or five is <b>to exclude</b> the third bundle <b>from its presumptive status.</b> By stating that the third bundle must be examined, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi indicates that in this case two examinations do not establish a presumption; rather, all of the bundles must be checked. <b>And actually, even</b> the <b>fourth and fifth</b> bundles require examination <b>as well.</b>

### Part 15
It was stated in the mishna that if <b>one finds</b> phylacteries <b>tied in bundles or in wrapped piles,</b> he sits there and waits with them until dark and then brings them in. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>bundles</b> in this context, <b>and what is</b> meant by <b>wrapped piles? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The same types of objects <b>are</b> called <b>bundles, and they are</b> also called <b>wrapped piles,</b> i.e., both contain more than one pair of phylacteries. <b>Bundles</b> consist of many pairs of phylacteries arranged <b>in pairs [<i>zuvei</i>]</b> of a head phylactery with an arm phylactery, whereas <b>wrapped piles</b> indicates <b>that many</b> phylacteries <b>are wrapped together</b> in no particular arrangement.

### Part 16
We learned in the mishna that one sits there and <b>waits with them until dark and</b> then <b>brings them</b> in. The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> must he do that? <b>Let him bring them in pair</b> by <b>pair. Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, said:</b> This matter <b>was explained to me</b> personally <b>by</b> my <b>father</b> as follows: <b>Any</b> instance where there are few enough phylacteries <b>that were he to bring them in pair</b> by <b>pair he would finish before sunset, he brings them</b> in <b>pair</b> by <b>pair. But if not,</b> i.e., if there are so many pairs of phylacteries that were he to bring them in one pair at a time he would not bring them all in before sunset, <b>he waits</b> there <b>with</b> all of <b>them until dark and</b> then <b>brings them</b> in.

### Part 17
It was stated in the mishna that <b>in</b> a time of <b>danger one covers</b> the phylacteries <b>and proceeds on his</b> way. The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>And in</b> a time of <b>danger he carries them less than four cubits</b> at a time? The Gemara answers that <b>Rav said:</b> It is <b>not difficult.</b> In <b>this</b> mishna, which states that the finder covers the phylacteries, it is referring <b>to the danger</b> posed <b>by gentiles,</b> where the gentile authorities decreed against donning phylacteries and the finder is afraid to be seen carrying them. However, in <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that one may carry them less than four cubits at a time, it is dealing <b>with the danger</b> posed <b>by bandits [<i>listim</i>].</b> In that case he is afraid to remain there until dark, but he is not worried about taking the phylacteries with him. Consequently, he may carry them less than four cubits at a time.
