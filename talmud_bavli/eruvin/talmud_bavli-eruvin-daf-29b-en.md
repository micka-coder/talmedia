in a case where the bulb <b>has not grown</b> to the size of <b>a span,</b> the distance between the thumb and the little finger of a hand that is spread apart, because at that stage the leaves are very toxic; <b>however, if it has grown</b> to the size of <b>a span, we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Pappa said: We only stated</b> this concern about eating onion leaves in a case where <b>one did not drink beer</b> afterward; <b>however, if he drank beer</b> afterward, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>

### Part 3
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person should not eat onion because of</b> the <b>toxins in it. There was an incident with Rabbi Ḥanina, who ate half an onion and half of its toxins, and he fell deathly ill, and his colleagues prayed for mercy for him, and he survived.</b> He was rescued only <b>because the time needed him,</b> as his generation was in need of his teaching, but otherwise he would not have recovered.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Zeira said that Shmuel said: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with beer, and it invalidates a ritual bath with</b> a measure of <b>three <i>log</i>,</b> similar to drawn water. <b>Rav Kahana strongly objects to this:</b> This is <b>obvious, for what is the difference between this and dye-water? As we learned</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Dye-water invalidates a ritual bath with</b> a measure of <b>three <i>log</i>,</b> like regular drawn water. <b>They said:</b> There is a difference between the two cases, as <b>there,</b> the liquid <b>is called dye-water; here, it is called beer.</b> Therefore, it might have been possible to argue that beer is not considered like water at all, in which case it would only invalidate a ritual bath if it changed the color of the water, and so Shmuel’s novel teaching was necessary.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> beer is needed to <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i>? Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Yosef, thought to say before Rav Yosef</b> as follows: <b>Two-quarters</b> of a <i>log</i> <b>of beer.</b> Rav Aḥa’s reasoning is now spelled out in detail. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: If <b>one carries out wine</b> on Shabbat from a private domain to a public domain, he is liable if he carries out <b>enough</b> wine <b>for diluting a cup,</b> i.e., enough undiluted wine to fill a cup after it has been diluted with water. <b>And</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught about</b> this mishna: <b>Enough</b> wine <b>for diluting a fine cup.</b> They inquired: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>a fine cup?</b> They answered: <b>A cup of blessing. And Rav Naḥman said that Rabba bar Avuh said: A cup of blessing must contain a quarter of a quarter-</b><i>log</i> of wine, <b>so that</b> after one <b>dilutes</b> the wine with water, <b>it amounts to a</b> full <b>quarter-</b><i>log</i>. <b>And</b> this measure is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rava</b> with regard to the strength of wine, <b>as Rava said: Any wine that is not</b> strong enough to require that it be <b>diluted</b> with <b>three</b> parts <b>water to one</b> part wine <b>is not</b> proper <b>wine.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And we learned in the latter clause</b> of the aforementioned mishna: <b>And</b> one is liable for carrying out <b>all other liquids, and</b> similarly <b>all waste water,</b> in the measure of <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i>. Now, Rav Aḥa argues as follows: <b>Since there,</b> with respect to liability for carrying on Shabbat, the ratio is <b>one to four,</b> as one is liable for carrying out a quarter of a quarter-<i>log</i> of wine, and one is only liable for carrying out other liquids if one carries out a quarter-<i>log</i>; <b>here, too,</b> with respect to making an <i>eiruv</i>, the ratio of <b>one to four</b> should be maintained. Therefore, since Rav said that two-quarters of a <i>log</i> of wine are required for an <i>eiruv</i>, the minimum amount of beer one may use should be two full <i>log</i>.

### Part 7
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>And this is not so. There,</b> with regard to carrying on Shabbat, we require four times as much beer as wine because <b>less than that</b> amount, i.e., less than a quarter-<i>log</i> of beer, <b>is insignificant. However, here,</b> with regard to establishing an <i>eiruv</i>, this is <b>not</b> relevant, <b>as it is common for people to drink a cup</b> of beer <b>in the morning and a cup</b> of beer <b>in the evening, and they rely on them</b> as their meals, as beer is satisfying even in such quantities. Therefore, we should require only two-quarters of a <i>log</i> of beer for an <i>eiruv</i>.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>How many dates</b> are needed to establish an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The minimal amount of <b>dates</b> one may use is <b>a <i>kav</i>. Rav Yosef said: From where do I say this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one inadvertently <b>ate dried figs</b> of <i>teruma</i>, <b>and paid dates</b> in compensation, <b>may a blessing come upon him.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara proceeds to clarify this ruling: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If you say</b> that one paid <b>according to the value</b> of the figs he ate, e.g., <b>he ate a <i>zuz</i></b> worth of figs <b>and he paid a <i>zuz</i></b> worth of dates, <b>what is</b> the reason it says: <b>May a blessing come upon him? He ate a <i>zuz</i> and paid a <i>zuz</i>. Rather, is it not</b> that he paid <b>in accordance with the measure</b> of the figs eaten, e.g., that <b>he ate a <i>se’a</i> of dried figs worth one <i>zuz</i>, and he paid a <i>se’a</i> of dates worth four</b> <i>zuz</i>. <b>And it says: May a blessing come upon him. Apparently, dates are superior</b> to dried figs. Accordingly, since we learned above that one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with a <i>kav</i> of dried figs, a <i>kav</i> of dates should certainly suffice for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i>.

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: No proof can be brought from here. It can be argued that <b>he actually ate a <i>zuz</i></b> worth of figs <b>and he paid a <i>zuz</i></b> worth of dates. <b>And what</b> is the reason it says: <b>May a blessing come upon him? For he ate something that buyers are not eager</b> to buy, <b>and he paid him something that buyers are eager</b> to buy. Even though they are equal in value, the priest benefits, for it is easier for him to sell dates than to sell dried figs.

### Part 11
With regard to <b><i>shetita</i>,</b> a dish made of roasted flour and honey, <b>Rav Aḥa bar Pineḥas said: Two large spoonfuls</b> are needed for an <i>eiruv</i>. With regard to <b><i>kisanei</i>,</b> a type of roasted grain, <b>Abaye said: Two Pumbeditan <i>bunei</i>,</b> the name of a particular of measurement.

### Part 12
Having mentioned roasted grain, the Gemara tangentially relates that <b>Abaye said: Mother,</b> actually his foster mother, <b>told me: These roasted grains are good for the heart and drive away</b> worrisome <b>thoughts.</b>

### Part 13
<b>And Abaye said: Mother told me</b> about another remedy. <b>One who suffers from weakness of the heart should</b> go and <b>bring the meat of the right thigh of a ram, and</b> also <b>bring the dung of grazing cattle from</b> the month of <b>Nisan, and if there is no cattle dung he should bring willow twigs, and</b> then <b>roast</b> the meat on a fire made with the dung or twigs, <b>and eat</b> it, <b>and drink afterward</b> some <b>diluted wine.</b> This will improve his condition.

### Part 14
Returning to the matter of quantities of food required for an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The minimum quantity for <b>anything that serves as a relish</b> is <b>enough to eat</b> two meals <b>with it,</b> i.e., enough to serve as a relish for the bread eaten in two meals. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>anything that is not a relish,</b> but rather is a food in its own right, one must use <b>enough to eat</b> two meals <b>of it.</b> The minimum quantity of <b>raw meat</b> is <b>enough to eat</b> two meals <b>of it. Roasted meat</b> is the subject of a dispute: <b>Rabba said: Enough to eat</b> the bread of two meals <b>with it.</b> That is to say, roasted meat is not a food in itself, but rather it serves as relish for other foods. <b>And Rav Yosef said: Enough to eat</b> two meals <b>of it,</b> as it is a food in its own right.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Yosef said: From where do I say this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>For these Persians eat pieces of</b> roasted <b>meat [<i>tabahakki</i>] without bread,</b> which shows that meat itself is a food. <b>Abaye said to him: But are the Persians a majority of the world?</b> The <i>halakha</i> follows the customary practice of most of the world and not that of particular locales. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> the following in a <i>baraita</i>? <b>Clothing of the poor,</b> i.e., pieces of cloth measuring three by three fingerbreadths, contracts impurity when in the possession of any <b>poor people</b> because poor people attach importance even to scraps of cloth of such small size. <b>Clothing of the wealthy</b> measuring at least three by three handbreadths contracts impurity in all cases, whether or not it is owned by <b>the wealthy.</b>
