### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> is referring <b>to</b> a beet <b>that was</b> only <b>partially cooked,</b> which is dangerous.

### Part 2
<b>There are</b> some <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna said: One may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with raw beets,</b> as <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Raw beet kills a healthy person.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Don’t we see</b> people <b>eating it and they do not die?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a beet <b>that was</b> only <b>partially cooked,</b> which is dangerous.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: A cooked dish of beets is beneficial for the heart, good for the eyes, and all the more so</b> beneficial <b>for the intestines. Abaye said: That is</b> specifically when the dish <b>sits on the stove and makes a <i>tukh tukh</i></b> sound, i.e., it is cooked thoroughly enough to produce a boiling sound.

### Part 4
<b>Rava</b> once <b>said</b> when he was in an especially good mood: <b>Behold, I am like</b> the intellectually sharp <b>ben Azzai,</b> who would regularly expound <b>in the markets of Tiberias.</b> I, too, am ready to answer any question posed to me. <b>One of the Sages said to Rava: How many apples</b> are needed to establish an <i>eiruv</i>? Rava <b>said to him: Does one establish an <i>eiruv</i> with apples?</b>

### Part 5
The other Sage responded: <b>And</b> is it <b>not</b> permissible to establish an <i>eiruv</i> with them? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>All foods combine to disqualify the body</b> of a priest who eats <b>half of a half-loaf</b> of ritually impure food, <b>and</b> to complete the measure of <b>food</b> required for <b>two meals for</b> the purpose of <b>an <i>eiruv</i>, and</b> to complete the measure of <b>an egg-bulk</b> required for a food to be able <b>to contract the</b> ritual <b>impurity of foods?</b> An apple is a kind of food, so it should be included in the items that may be used to establish an <i>eiruv</i>.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the refutation? If you say</b> it is <b>because it was taught</b> using the term <b>all foods, and these</b> apples <b>are fit for eating,</b> how can an objection be raised from such a general term? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> already <b>say: One may not learn from general statements</b> using the word all, <b>even in a place where it says except,</b> since no rule exhausts all cases?

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>because it taught: And</b> all foods combine to complete the measure of <b>food</b> required for <b>two meals for</b> the purpose of <b>an <i>eiruv</i>, and</b> to complete the measure of <b>an egg-bulk to contract the</b> ritual <b>impurity of foods; and these</b> apples <b>are also susceptible to the</b> ritual <b>impurity of foods.</b> Therefore, there is clear proof that the mishna is referring to apples as well.

### Part 8
Having established that an <i>eiruv</i> may be established with apples, the Gemara returns to the question raised above: <b>How many</b> apples are needed to establish an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> The minimum measure of <b>apples</b> that must be used for an <i>eiruv</i> is <b>a <i>kav</i>.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> When distributing poor man’s tithe, one must give each individual poor person at least <b>an <i>ukla</i>,</b> an eighth of a <i>log</i>, <b>of spices, a liter of vegetables, ten nuts, five peaches, two pomegranates,</b> or <b>one citron,</b> as these are worthy amounts for distribution. <b>And Gursak bar Darei said in the name of Rav Menashya bar Sheguvlei,</b> who said <b>in the name of Rav: And similarly,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>.</b> Now, it can be asked: <b>These</b> apples <b>should also be like peaches,</b> as they are similar in size, and it should be enough to use five apples for an <i>eiruv</i>.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers that there is a distinction between them: <b>These</b> peaches <b>are important,</b> and therefore five of them are a significant amount, <b>but these</b> apples <b>are not important,</b> and therefore one must use the larger measure of a <i>kav</i>.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Yosef said: May his Master,</b> God, <b>forgive Rav Menashya bar Sheguvlei,</b> for he erred and caused others to err. <b>I stated before him</b> a ruling in the name of Rav <b>concerning a mishna, and he stated it concerning the <i>baraita</i>,</b> which led to the error. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One may not give a pauper</b> receiving poor man’s tithe <b>at the threshing floor less than half a <i>kav</i> of wheat or</b> less than <b>a <i>kav</i> of barley. Rabbi Meir says:</b> He must be given at least <b>half a <i>kav</i> of barley.</b> Similarly, he must be given no less than <b>a <i>kav</i> and a half of spelt, a <i>kav</i> of dried figs, or a <i>maneh</i> of pressed figs. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Not a <i>maneh</i>, but <b>half</b> a <i>maneh</i>. He must be given at least <b>half a <i>log</i> of wine. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Half that amount, <b>a quarter</b> <i>log</i>. <b>And</b> similarly, he must be given <b>a quarter</b> <i>log</i> <b>of oil. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Half that amount, <b>an eighth</b> of a <i>log</i>. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all other fruit, Abba Shaul said:</b> He must be given <b>enough to sell them and buy food</b> that suffices <b>for two meals with</b> the proceeds of <b>their</b> sale. <b>And</b> with regard to this mishna, <b>Rav said: And similarly,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara poses a question with regard to Rav Yosef’s harsh reaction to Rav Menashya bar Sheguvlei’s statement: <b>What is the strength of this over that?</b> The mishna and <i>baraita</i> seem to share the same content, so why should Rav’s ruling be more applicable to one than the other? <b>If you say</b> it is <b>because</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>spices was</b> also <b>taught in this</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>and spices are not fit for eating</b> on their own but only when added as a flavoring to other foods, and therefore Rav could not have been referring to the <i>baraita</i> when he said that the same law applies to an <i>eiruv</i>; <b>wasn’t</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>wheat and barley taught here</b> in the mishna, <b>and they</b> too <b>are not</b> immediately <b>fit for eating</b> until they are processed further.

### Part 13
<b>Rather, it is because it was taught</b> in the mishna that one must give <b>half a <i>log</i> of wine. And Rav said: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with two-quarters</b> of a <i>log</i> <b>of wine,</b> which is equal to half a <i>log</i>. <b>Since we require so much</b> wine, <b>learn from here</b> that <b>when Rav said: And similarly,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>, he said it about this mishna</b> and the measures mentioned therein. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from this</b> that this is the proper understanding of Rav’s statement.

### Part 14
The Gemara further examines the mishna cited earlier. <b>The Master said: And</b> all foods combine to complete the measure of <b>food</b> required <b>for two meals for</b> the purpose of <b>an <i>eiruv</i>. Rav Yosef thought to say</b> that an <i>eiruv</i> may not be established <b>unless there is</b> a complete <b>meal of this</b> kind of food <b>and</b> a complete <b>meal of that</b> kind of food, meaning that an <i>eiruv</i> may only be established if each meal consists of a single type of food. <b>Rabba said to him:</b> An <i>eiruv</i> may be established with the amount of food required for two meals <b>even</b> if each type of food made up only <b>half, a third, or a quarter</b> of a meal.

### Part 15
The Gemara now examines Rav’s statement <b>itself,</b> which was cited in the course of the previous discussion. <b>Rav said: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with two-quarters</b> of a <i>log</i> <b>of wine.</b> The following question may be raised: <b>Do we</b> really <b>need so much? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> The minimal amount of <b>wine</b> required for an <i>eiruv</i> is <b>enough to eat</b> bread <b>with it,</b> i.e., enough to soak the bread in to enable one to eat it? Additionally, the minimal amount of <b>vinegar</b> that may be used to establish an <i>eiruv</i> is <b>enough to dip</b> the food <b>in it,</b> and the minimal amount of <b>olives and onions</b> is <b>enough to eat them</b> together with the bread. All of these quantities are calculated on the basis of <b>two meals.</b> This <i>baraita</i> clearly indicates that an <i>eiruv</i> may be established with much less than two-quarters of a <i>log</i> of wine.

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to cooked wine,</b> which is very strong, and therefore even a small amount suffices.

### Part 17
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that the minimal amount of <b>vinegar</b> that may be used for an <i>eiruv</i> <b>is enough to dip</b> food <b>in it. Rav Giddel said that Rav said: Enough to dip in it the food of two meals</b> consisting <b>of vegetables. Some say</b> that <b>Rav Giddel said that Rav said:</b> Enough to dip in it the <b>vegetables that are eaten in two</b> ordinary <b>meals,</b> which is less than the amount consumed in two meals consisting entirely of vegetables.

### Part 18
<b>The Master</b> also <b>said</b> that the minimum measure of <b>olives and onions</b> that may be used for an <i>eiruv</i> is enough <b>to eat them</b> with <b>the food of two meals.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>May one establish an <i>eiruv</i> with onions? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Rabbi Meir once spent Shabbat in</b> the town of <b>Ardiska, and a certain person came before him</b> and <b>said to him: Rabbi, I made an <i>eiruv</i></b> of Shabbat borders [<i>eiruv teḥumin</i>] <b>with onions,</b> so that I might walk to the town of <b>Tiv’in.</b> Ardiska was located between the man’s <i>eiruv</i> and his destination of Tiv’in, which was beyond his Shabbat limit as measured from his hometown. <b>And Rabbi Meir made him remain within his four cubits.</b> He forbade him to leave his four cubits, as he held that an <i>eiruv</i> made with onions is not an <i>eiruv</i>, and therefore the person had left his Shabbat limit without an <i>eiruv teḥumin</i>.

### Part 19
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> ruling, which states that onions may not be used for an <i>eiruv</i>, is referring <b>to</b> onion <b>leaves,</b> which are harmful; whereas <b>that</b> ruling, which states that onions may be used for an <i>eiruv</i>, is referring <b>to</b> onion <b>bulbs,</b> which are edible. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>ate an onion and died early</b> the next morning, <b>we need not ask from what he died,</b> as his death was certainly caused by the onion. <b>And Shmuel said: They only taught</b> this <b>with regard to the leaves; but with regard to</b> onion <b>bulbs, we have no</b> problem <b>with it. And even with regard to the leaves, we only stated</b> this concern
