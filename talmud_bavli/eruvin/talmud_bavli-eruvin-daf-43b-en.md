### Part 1
<b>However, he is prohibited to drink wine on all weekdays,</b> in case the Messiah has come and he has not yet been informed.

### Part 2
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Granted, if you say that</b> the prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits applies</b> above ten handbreadths, <b>that is</b> why <b>on Shabbat and Festivals he is permitted</b> to drink wine, for the Messiah will certainly not arrive from outside the Shabbat limit on those days. <b>But if you say that</b> the prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits does not apply</b> above ten handbreadths, <b>why is he permitted</b> to drink wine <b>on Shabbat and Festivals?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there, as the verse stated: “Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet,</b> before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord; and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers” (Malachi 3:23–24). This verse teaches that Elijah will arrive the day before the coming of the Messiah. <b>Since Elijah did not come the previous day,</b> the Messiah will not come today, and therefore he may drink.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>If so, on weekdays, too, he should be permitted</b> to drink wine <b>each and every day, as Elijah did not arrive the previous day. Rather,</b> the reason for the prohibition on weekdays must be that <b>we say</b> that Elijah may already have <b>arrived at the Great Court,</b> but it has not yet become a matter of public knowledge. Likewise, <b>here too we should say</b> that Elijah already <b>arrived</b> the previous day <b>at the Great Court,</b> on the eve of Shabbat or a Festival.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>It has already been promised to the Jewish people that Elijah will not come either on the eve of Shabbat or on the eve of a Festival, due to the trouble,</b> lest people go out to greet him and not have time to complete all their preparations for the sacred day.

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: <b>It might enter your mind</b> to say that <b>since Elijah will not come</b> on Shabbat eve due to the trouble involved, the <b>Messiah will also not come</b> then, and if so, <b>on Shabbat eve he should</b> also <b>be permitted</b> to drink wine. However, this reasoning is rejected: It is only <b>Elijah</b> who <b>will not arrive</b> on Shabbat eve, but the <b>Messiah</b> himself <b>may arrive,</b> for <b>once the Messiah comes, all</b> the nations <b>will be subservient to the Jewish people,</b> and they will help them prepare whatever is needed for Shabbat.

### Part 7
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>He should be permitted</b> to drink wine <b>on a Sunday,</b> for if Elijah cannot come on Shabbat, the Messiah will not come on a Sunday. <b>Let us resolve from here</b> that the prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits does not apply</b> above ten handbreadths, <b>as if</b> the prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits applies</b> above ten handbreadths, <b>on Sunday he should be permitted</b> to drink wine, <b>as Elijah cannot come on Shabbat.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>This <i>tanna</i> was uncertain whether there is</b> a prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits</b> above ten handbreadths <b>or</b> there is <b>no</b> prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits.</b> Therefore, he ruled <b>stringently</b> in this regard concerning Sunday.

### Part 9
The Gemara poses a question: <b>When did</b> the person who took the vow of naziriteship <b>arise</b> and <b>take</b> his <b>vow? If you say he arose</b> and took his vow <b>on a weekday, since</b> the vow of <b>naziriteship</b> already <b>took effect, how can Shabbat come and annul it?</b> Naziriteship cannot take effect one day and be annulled on the next; rather, once it applies, it remains in effect for the entire period of his vow.

### Part 10
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>he arose on Shabbat and took</b> his <b>vow, or</b> else he arose <b>on a Festival and took</b> his <b>vow, and</b> it is only on <b>that day that he is permitted</b> to drink wine, as the Messiah will not come; but <b>from that day on he is prohibited</b> to drink wine, for once the naziriteship takes effect on a weekday, it remains in effect from that point onwards, even on Shabbat and Festivals.

### Part 11
It was taught in the mishna: On <b>one occasion, they did not enter the port</b> until after nightfall on Shabbat eve, and they asked Rabban Gamliel whether they were permitted to alight from the boat. He told them that they were permitted to alight, for he had been watching, and he knew that they had entered within the city’s limit before nightfall, and therefore they may walk throughout the city.

### Part 12
In order to clarify this issue, the Gemara cites that which was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Gamliel had a</b> special <b>tube through which he would look and see</b> a distance of <b>two thousand cubits on land, and</b> also determine <b>a corresponding</b> distance of <b>two thousand cubits at sea.</b>

### Part 13
In general, <b>one who wishes to know the depth of a valley can bring</b> such <b>a tube and look through it, and he will know the depth of the valley.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara cites another statement with regard to measurements: <b>One who wishes to know the height of a palm tree,</b> but does not want to actually climb the tree to measure it, <b>can measure his</b> own <b>height, and</b> the length of <b>his</b> own <b>shadow, and</b> the length of <b>the shadow of the height</b> of the palm tree, and calculate the proportions, <b>and he will know the height of the palm tree.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara cites related advice: If, out of honor for the dead, <b>one wishes that a wild beast should not rest in the shade of a grave, he should insert a reed</b> into the ground <b>at</b> the end of <b>the fourth hour of the day,</b> roughly ten o’clock in the morning, when it is hot in the sun and cooler in the shade, and beasts begin to seek shelter in the shade. <b>And</b> he should <b>observe in which direction the shadow</b> of the reed <b>inclines,</b> and then <b>slant</b> the gravestone <b>upwards and downwards</b> until he finds an angle at which it casts no shadow at that hour, and the beasts will not come to rest at the grave during the heat of the day.

### Part 16
The Gemara relates that <b>Neḥemya, son of Rav Ḥanilai, was</b> once so <b>engrossed in</b> his <b>learning</b> that he did not notice that <b>he was going out beyond</b> his Shabbat limit. <b>Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Naḥman: Your student Neḥemya is in distress,</b> as he is outside the Shabbat limit and cannot enter. What can we do for him?

### Part 17
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Establish a human partition for him,</b> i.e., people who are permitted to go out there should line up and form human walls, through which he is permitted to walk and thereby <b>reenter</b> the Shabbat limit.

### Part 18
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak sat behind Rava, and Rava sat</b> in the first row <b>before Rav Naḥman. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: What</b> precisely <b>was Rav Ḥisda’s dilemma</b> that he addressed to Rav Naḥman with regard to Neḥemya’s distress?

### Part 19
The Gemara explains: <b>If you say</b> that <b>we are dealing with</b> a case where the space between Neḥemya and the Shabbat limit could be <b>filled with people</b> who had established an <i>eiruv</i> and were permitted to go out beyond the Shabbat limit and establish a human partition for Neḥemya, <b>and</b> then it can be argued that <b>the dilemma</b> that <b>he raised</b> was: Is <b>the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel</b> that a person may walk throughout an enclosed area, although he had not established residence there before Shabbat while it was still day, and the same applies to a human partition of this kind;
