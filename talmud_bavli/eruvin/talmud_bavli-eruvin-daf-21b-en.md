<b>that are first ripe, and the other basket [<i>dud</i>] had very bad figs, so bad they could not be eaten”</b> (Jeremiah 24:1–2).

### Part 2
<b>Good figs, these are</b> the <b>full-fledged righteous</b> people; <b>bad figs, these are</b> the <b>full-fledged wicked</b> people. <b>And lest you say that the hope</b> of the wicked <b>is lost and their prospect is void, the verse states,</b> interpreting the word <i>duda’im</i> homiletically: <b>“The baskets [<i>duda’im</i>] yield a fragrance”</b> (Song of Songs 7:14), meaning that <b>both of them,</b> the righteous and the wicked, <b>will eventually yield a fragrance.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rava interpreted</b> the verse cited above <b>homiletically</b> as follows: <b>What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “The mandrakes [<i>duda’im</i>] yield a fragrance, and at our doors are all manner of choice fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved” (Song of Songs 7:14)? <b>“The mandrakes [<i>duda’im</i>] yield a fragrance,” these are the young men of Israel who have never tasted the taste of sin.</b>

### Part 4
<b>“And at our doors [<i>petaḥeinu</i>] are all manner of choice fruits [<i>megadim</i>],” these are the daughters of Israel who inform [<i>maggidot</i>] their husbands about their passageway [<i>pit’ḥeihen</i>],</b> i.e., they tell them when they are menstruating. <b>Another version</b> of this interpretation is: <b>They bind [<i>ogedot</i>] their passageway</b> and save it <b>for their husbands,</b> and do not have relations with others.

### Part 5
<b>“New and old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved,” the Congregation of Israel said before the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> and continued: <b>Master of the Universe, I have decreed many decrees upon myself</b> through the enactments and ordinances of the Sages, <b>more than what You decreed upon me</b> in the Torah, <b>and I have fulfilled them.</b> These are the new laws which were added to the old ones stated in the Torah.

### Part 6
It was related that <b>Rav Ḥisda said to one of the Sages who would arrange the</b> traditions of the <b><i>aggada</i> before him: Did you hear what</b> the meaning of: <b>New and old</b> is? <b>He said to him: These,</b> the new, <b>are the</b> more <b>lenient mitzvot, and these,</b> the old, <b>are the</b> more <b>stringent mitzvot.</b>

### Part 7
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him:</b> This cannot be so, <b>for was the Torah given on two</b> separate <b>occasions,</b> i.e., were the more lenient and more stringent mitzvot given separately? <b>Rather, these,</b> the old, <b>are</b> mitzvot <b>from the Torah, and these,</b> the new, <b>are from the Sages.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rava expounded</b> another verse in similar fashion: <b>What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And more than these, my son, be careful: of making many books [<i>sefarim</i>]</b> there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh” (Ecclesiastes 12:12)? <b>My son, be careful</b> to fulfill <b>the words of the Sages [<i>soferim</i>]</b> even <b>more than the words of the Torah. For the words of the Torah include positive and negative</b> commandments, and even with regard to the negative commandments, the violation of many of them is punishable only by lashes. <b>Whereas</b> with respect to <b>the words of the Sages, anyone who transgresses the words of the Sages is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty, as it is stated: “And whoever breaches through a hedge, a snake shall bite him” (Ecclesiastes 10:8), taking hedges to refer metaphorically to decrees.

### Part 9
<b>Lest you say: If</b> the words of the Sages <b>are of substance</b> and have such great importance, <b>why were they not written</b> in the Torah, therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of making many books there is no end,”</b> meaning that it is impossible to fully commit the Oral Torah to writing, as it is boundless.

### Part 10
What is the meaning of the words: <b>“And much study [<i>lahag</i>] is a weariness of the flesh”? Rav Pappa, son of Rav Aḥa bar Adda, said in the name of Rav Aḥa bar Ulla: This teaches that whoever mocks [<i>malig</i>] the words of the Sages will be sentenced to boiling excrement,</b> which results from the weariness of the flesh of man.

### Part 11
<b>Rava strongly objects to this</b> explanation: <b>Is it written: Mock [<i>la’ag</i>]? “<i>Lahag</i>” is</b> the word that is <b>written. Rather,</b> the verse must be understood in the opposite manner: <b>Whoever meditates [<i>hogeh</i>] upon them,</b> the words of the Sages, <b>experiences</b> enjoyment as if it had <b>the taste of meat.</b>

### Part 12
Concerning the significance of observing the words of the Sages, the Gemara relates: <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It once happened that Rabbi Akiva was incarcerated in a prison, and Rabbi Yehoshua HaGarsi would</b> come to the prison to <b>attend to his</b> needs. <b>Every day</b> his disciples <b>would bring him water in a measured</b> quantity. <b>One day the prison guard met</b> Rabbi Yehoshua HaGarsi and <b>said to him:</b> The amount of <b>your water today is more</b> than usual; <b>perhaps you need</b> it <b>in order to</b> soften the walls and thus <b>undermine the prison. He</b> then <b>poured out half</b> the water, <b>and gave him</b> the other <b>half</b> to take in to Rabbi Akiva.

### Part 13
<b>When</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>came to Rabbi Akiva,</b> and the latter saw the small amount of water he had brought, <b>he said to him: Yehoshua, do you not know that I am old, and my life depends on your life?</b> No one else brings me water, so if you bring me less than I need, my life is endangered.

### Part 14
After Rabbi Yehoshua <b>related to him the entire incident,</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: Give me water so that I may wash my hands.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him:</b> The water that I brought <b>will not suffice for drinking;</b> how <b>will it suffice for washing your hands? He said to him: What can I do; for</b> transgressing the words of the Sages and eating without first washing hands <b>one is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty. And if so, it is <b>better that I should die my own death</b> by thirst, <b>rather than transgress the opinion of my colleagues</b> who enacted that one must wash hands before eating.

### Part 15
<b>They said</b> that <b>he would not taste anything until</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>brought him water and he washed his hands. When the Sages heard about this, they said: If in his old age</b> and weakened state he is still <b>so</b> meticulous in his observance of the mitzvot, <b>how much more so</b> must he have been <b>in his youth.</b> And <b>if in prison</b> he is <b>so</b> scrupulous in his behavior, <b>how much more so</b> must he have been <b>when not in prison.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: At the time that</b> King <b>Solomon instituted</b> the ordinances of <b><i>eiruv</i></b> of courtyards <b>and</b> of <b>washing hands</b> to purify them from their impurity, which are added safeguards to the words of the Torah, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said</b> in his praise: <b>“My son, if your heart is wise, My heart will be glad, even Mine”</b> (Proverbs 23:15). <b>And it states</b> with regard to him: <b>“My son, be wise and make My heart glad, that I may respond to he who taunts Me”</b> (Proverbs 27:11).

### Part 17
The Gemara cites additional teachings that <b>Rava interpreted homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages. Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine has flowered, if the grape blossoms have opened, if the pomegranates are in flower; there will I give you my loves”</b> (Song of Songs 7:12–13)?

### Part 18
With regard to the words: <b>“Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field,” the Congregation of Israel said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, do not judge me like those who reside in large cities where there is robbery and licentiousness, and vain oaths and false oaths,</b> but rather: <b>“Let us go forth into the field,” come and I will show You Torah scholars who</b> work the land but nonetheless <b>engage in Torah</b> study, <b>in</b> poverty and in <b>distress.</b>

### Part 19
With regard to the words, <b>“Let us lodge in the villages,” do not read</b> the phrase as: <b>In the villages [<i>bakefarim</i>], but rather</b> as: <b>By the deniers [<i>bakoferim</i>],</b> meaning, <b>come and I will show You</b> the nations of the world, <b>whom You showered with good, but</b> yet <b>they have denied You.</b>

### Part 20
<b>“Let us get up early to the vineyards,” these are the synagogues and houses of study. “Let us see if the vine has flowered,” these are the masters of Bible,</b> who are proficient in the first stage of Torah study. <b>“If the grape blossoms have opened,” these are the masters of Mishna. “If the pomegranates are in flower,” these are the masters of Gemara. “There will I give you my loves,”</b> means <b>I will show You my glory and my greatness, the praise of my sons and daughters,</b> how they adhere to sanctity.

### Part 21
The Gemara expounds further concerning King Solomon. <b>Rav Hamnuna said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And he spoke three thousand proverbs, and his poems were a thousand and five”</b> (i Kings 5:12)? This <b>teaches that Solomon pronounced three thousand proverbs for each and every word of the Torah,</b> and <b>one thousand and five reasons for each and every word of the Scribes.</b>

### Part 22
<b>Rava</b> also <b>taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And besides being wise, Koheleth also taught the people knowledge; and he weighed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:9). Rava interpreted homiletically: <b>He taught the people knowledge,</b> meaning <b>he taught it with the accentuation marks</b> in the Torah, <b>and</b> he <b>explained</b> each matter <b>by means of</b> something <b>similar to it.</b>

### Part 23
With regard to: <b>“And he weighed [<i>izzen</i>], and sought out, and set in order many proverbs,” Ulla said</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: At first the Torah was like a basket without handles [<i>oznayim</i>], until Solomon came and made handles for it.</b> By means of his explanations and proverbs he enabled each person to understand and take hold of the Torah, fulfill its mitzvot, and distance himself from transgressions.

### Part 24
With regard to the verse, “His head is as the most fine gold, <b>his locks [<i>kevutzotav</i>] are wavy [<i>taltalim</i>],</b> and black as a raven” (Song of Songs 5:11), <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Mar Ukva said:</b> This <b>teaches that it is possible to expound from each and every stroke [<i>kotz</i>]</b> of the letters in the Torah <b>mounds upon mounds [<i>tilei tilim</i>] of laws.</b>

### Part 25
<b>Black [<i>sheḥorot</i>] as a raven [<i>orev</i>]</b> means: <b>In whom do you find</b> the words of Torah? <b>In him</b>
