### Part 1
<b>If so, you have abolished</b> the halakhic <b>category of <i>eiruv</i> from that alleyway.</b> Since from a halakhic perspective it is considered as though only one person lives in that alleyway, there is no need for an <i>eiruv</i>. Consequently, when the residents carry in it without an <i>eiruv</i>, observers will mistakenly think that it is permitted to carry in an alleyway even without an <i>eiruv</i>.

### Part 2
Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, replied: It is required <b>that they establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> anyway, as a reminder of the laws of <i>eiruvin</i>, even though it serves no halakhic purpose. Rava retorted that this in turn results in a different problem: Observers will then <b>say</b> that <b>an <i>eiruv</i> is effective</b> even <b>in the place of a gentile,</b> even if he does not rent out his domain, which is against the <i>halakha</i>. He replied: <b>We make an announcement</b> to the effect that they are not carrying because of the <i>eiruv</i>, and that it only serves as a reminder.

### Part 3
Rava rejected this option as well: Can we make <b>an announcement for the children?</b> Even if it is assured that all adults present will hear the announcement, how will the children, who do not hear or understand the announcement, know the <i>halakha</i> later in life? Recalling that their fathers established an <i>eiruv</i> in this alleyway, they will think that an <i>eiruv</i> is effective even in the place of a gentile. Therefore, one cannot rely on Abaye’s solution.

### Part 4
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the gentile’s Jewish neighbors should proceed as follows: <b>Let one of them go and become friendly with</b> the gentile, <b>and ask him</b> for permission to make use of <b>a place</b> in his domain, <b>and set something down there, thus becoming like</b> the gentile’s <b>hired laborer or harvester. And Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> Not only can the gentile himself rent out his domain for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i>, but <b>even his hired laborer, and even his harvester,</b> if he is a Jew, <b>may</b> rent out the space and <b>contribute to the <i>eiruv</i></b> on his behalf, <b>and this is enough.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: If there were five hired laborers or five harvesters there, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the presence of more than one of these, if they are all Jews, entail a stringency, such that they are all required to join in the <i>eiruv</i> or that they are all required to rent out his domain? Rav Yosef <b>said to him: If</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that the gentile’s <b>hired laborer or harvester</b> stands in his place <b>as a leniency, would they say that his hired laborer or harvester</b> stands in his place <b>as a stringency?</b> This law was stated only as a leniency with regard to the laws of renting for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i>, not in order to introduce more stringencies.

### Part 6
The Gemara proceeds to examine the ruling cited in the course of the previous discussion. Returning to <b>the matter itself, Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Even</b> the gentile’s <b>hired laborer, and even his harvester, may contribute to the <i>eiruv</i></b> in his stead, <b>and this is enough. Rav Naḥman said: How excellent is this <i>halakha</i>.</b> Even Rav Naḥman agreed with this statement, and viewed it as correct and substantiated.

### Part 7
However, Rav Naḥman did not give his approval to all of Rav Yehuda’s rulings, as <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: If one drank a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of wine, he may not issue a</b> halakhic <b>ruling,</b> as the wine is liable to confuse his thinking. With regard to this second statement, <b>Rav Naḥman said: This <i>halakha</i> is not excellent, as</b> concerning <b>myself, as long as I have not drunk a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of wine, my mind is not clear.</b> It is only after drinking wine that I can issue appropriate rulings.

### Part 8
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>the Master said this,</b> making a statement that praises one <i>halakha</i> and disparages another? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina say: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “But he who keeps company with prostitutes</b> [<b><i>zonot</i></b>] <b>wastes his fortune”</b> (Proverbs 29:3)? It alludes to the following: <b>Anyone who says: This teaching is pleasant</b> [<b><i>zo na’a</i></b>] <b>but this is not pleasant, loses the fortune of Torah.</b> It is not in keeping with the honor of Torah to make such evaluations. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: I retract,</b> and I will no longer make such comments concerning words of Torah.

### Part 9
On the topic of drinking wine, <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: One who has drunk</b> wine <b>must not pray, but if he</b> nonetheless <b>prayed, his prayer is a prayer,</b> i.e., he has fulfilled his obligation. On the other hand, <b>one who is intoxicated</b> with wine <b>must not pray, and if he prayed, his prayer is an abomination.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara poses a question: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which a person is considered <b>one who has drunk</b> wine; <b>and what are the circumstances</b> in which a person is considered <b>one who is intoxicated</b> with wine? The Gemara answers that one can learn this from <b>the following</b> event: <b>As Rabbi Abba bar Shumni and Rav Menashya bar Yirmeya from Gifti were taking leave of each other at the ford of the Yofti River, they said: Let each one of us say something that his fellow</b> scholar <b>has not</b> yet <b>heard, for Mari bar Rav Huna said: A person must take leave of his fellow only in the midst of</b> a discussion of <b>a matter of <i>halakha</i>, as due to this he will remember him.</b>

### Part 11
<b>One</b> of them <b>opened</b> the discussion <b>and said: What are the circumstances</b> where a person is considered <b>one who has drunk</b> wine, <b>and what are the circumstances</b> where a person is considered <b>one who is intoxicated</b> with wine? <b>One who has drunk</b> wine refers to <b>anyone</b> who has drunk wine but whose mind remains clear enough <b>that he is able to talk in the presence of a king. One who is intoxicated</b> refers to <b>anyone</b> who is so disoriented by the wine he has drunk <b>that he is not able to talk in the presence of a king.</b>

### Part 12
<b>The other one</b> then <b>opened</b> a different discussion <b>and said:</b> With regard to <b>one who took possession of a convert’s property, what should he do so that it remains in his hands?</b> The property of a convert who died without children is regarded as ownerless, and is acquired by the first person to perform a valid act of acquisition upon it. Since in this case the one who took possession of the property did not acquire it through his own labor, his ownership is tenuous, and he is liable to lose it unless he uses it for the purpose of a mitzva. One in this situation <b>should buy a Torah scroll with</b> part of the revenue, and by the merit of this act, he will retain the rest. <b>Rav Sheshet said: Even</b>
