### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Abaye bar Avin and Rav Ḥinana bar Avin were sitting, and Abaye was sitting beside them, and they sat and said: Granted,</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> the author of the unattributed mishna, is clear, as <b>he holds</b> that <b>the residence of a gentile is considered a</b> significant <b>residence.</b> In other words, the gentile living in the courtyard is considered a resident who has a share in the courtyard. Since he cannot join in an <i>eiruv</i> with the Jew, he renders it prohibited for the Jew to carry from his house to the courtyard or from the courtyard to his house. Consequently, the case of <b>one</b> Jew living in the courtyard is <b>no different</b> from the case of <b>two</b> Jews living there. In both cases, the gentile renders it prohibited for carrying.

### Part 2
<b>But Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, what does he hold? If</b> you say <b>he holds</b> that <b>the residence of a gentile is considered a</b> significant <b>residence, he should prohibit</b> carrying <b>even</b> when there is only <b>one</b> Jew living in the courtyard. <b>And if it is not considered a</b> significant <b>residence, he should not prohibit</b> carrying <b>even</b> when there are <b>two</b> Jews living there.

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said to them:</b> Your basic premise is based on a faulty assumption. <b>Does Rabbi Meir</b> actually <b>hold</b> that <b>the residence of a gentile is considered a</b> significant <b>residence? Wasn’t it taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>The courtyard of a gentile is like the pen of an animal,</b> i.e., just as an animal pen does not render it prohibited to carry in a courtyard, so too, the gentile’s residence in itself does not impose restrictions on a Jew.

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> this explanation must be rejected, and the dispute in the mishna should be understood differently: <b>Everyone agrees</b> that <b>the residence of gentile is not considered a</b> significant <b>residence, and here they disagree about a decree</b> that was issued <b>lest</b> the Jew <b>learn from</b> the gentile’s <b>ways.</b> The disagreement is with regard to whether this decree is applicable only when there are two Jews living in the courtyard, or even when there is only one Jew living there.

### Part 5
The disagreement should be understood as follows: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov holds</b> that <b>since a gentile is suspected of bloodshed,</b> it is unusual for a single Jew to share a courtyard with a gentile. However, it is not unusual for two or more Jews to do so, as they will protect each other. Therefore, in the case of <b>two</b> Jews, <b>who commonly live</b> together with a gentile in the same courtyard, the Sages <b>issued a decree</b> to the effect that the gentile renders it prohibited for them to carry. This would cause great inconvenience to Jews living with gentiles and would thereby motivate the Jews to distance themselves from gentiles. In this manner, the Sages sought to prevent the Jews from learning from the gentiles’ ways. However, in the case of <b>one</b> Jew, for whom <b>it is not common</b> to live together with a gentile in the same courtyard, <b>the Sages did not issue a decree</b> that the gentile renders it prohibited for him to carry, as the Sages do not issue decrees for uncommon situations.

### Part 6
On the other hand, <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>sometimes it happens that</b> a single Jew <b>lives</b> together with a gentile in the same courtyard, and hence it is appropriate to issue the decree in such a case as well. <b>Therefore, the Sages said: An <i>eiruv</i> is not effective in a place</b> where <b>a gentile</b> is living, <b>nor is the renunciation of rights</b> to a courtyard in favor of the other residents <b>effective in a place</b> where <b>a gentile</b> is living. Therefore, carrying is prohibited in a courtyard in which a gentile resides, <b>unless</b> the gentile <b>rents</b> out his property to one of the Jews for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i> regardless of the number of Jews living there. <b>And</b> as <b>a gentile</b> would <b>not</b> be willing <b>to rent</b> out his property for this purpose, the living conditions will become too strained, prompting the Jew to move.

### Part 7
The Gemara poses a question: <b>What is the reason</b> that a gentile will not rent out his property for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>If you say</b> it is <b>because</b> the gentile <b>thinks</b> that <b>perhaps they will</b> later <b>come to take possession of his property</b> based on this rental, <b>this works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>we require a full-fledged rental,</b> i.e., that rental for the purpose of an <i>eiruv</i> must be proper and valid according to all the <i>halakhot</i> of renting.

### Part 8
<b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>we require</b> only <b>a flawed,</b> symbolic <b>rental,</b> i.e., all that is needed is a token gesture that has the appearance of renting, <b>what is there to say?</b> The gentile would understand that it is not a real rental, and therefore he would not be wary of renting out his residence. <b>As it was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disputed this issue as follows: <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that we require a <b>full-fledged rental, and Rav Sheshet said: A flawed,</b> symbolic <b>rental</b> is sufficient.

### Part 9
Having mentioned this dispute, the Gemara now clarifies its particulars: <b>What is</b> a <b>flawed</b> rental, and <b>what is</b> a <b>full-fledged</b> one? <b>If you say</b> that a <b>full-fledged</b> rental refers to a case where one gives another person <b>a <i>peruta</i></b> as rent, whereas in a <b>flawed</b> rental he provides him with <b>less than the value of a <i>peruta</i>,</b> this poses a difficulty. <b>Is there anyone who said</b> that renting <b>from a gentile for less than the value of a <i>peruta</i></b> is <b>not</b> valid? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Ya’akov bar Giyorei, send in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: You should know that one</b> may <b>rent from a gentile even for less than the value of a <i>peruta</i>?</b>

### Part 10
<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A Noahide,</b> i.e., a gentile who stole <b>is executed</b> for his crime, according to the laws applying to Noahides, even if he stole <b>less than the value of a <i>peruta</i>.</b> A Noahide is particular about his property and unwilling to waive his rights to it, even if it is of minimal value; therefore, the prohibition against stealing applies to items of any value whatsoever. <b>And</b> in the case of Noahides, the stolen item <b>is not returnable,</b> as the possibility of rectification by returning a stolen object was granted only to Jews. The principle that less than the value of a <i>peruta</i> is not considered money applies to Jews alone. With regard to gentiles, it has monetary value, and therefore one may rent from a gentile with this amount.

### Part 11
<b>Rather,</b> the distinction between a full-fledged rental and a flawed rental should be explained as follows: <b>A full-fledged</b> rental refers <b>to</b> one that is confirmed <b>by legal documents [<i>moharkei</i>]</b> and guaranteed by <b>officials [<i>aburganei</i>];</b> and <b>a flawed</b> rental means one that is <b>not</b> confirmed <b>by legal documents and</b> guaranteed by <b>officials,</b> an agreement that is unenforceable in court. Based on this explanation, the Gemara reiterates what was stated earlier with regard to the gentile’s concern about renting: <b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>we require a full-fledged rental,</b> as it is clear why the gentile would refuse to rent out his property.

### Part 12
<b>But according to the one who said</b> that <b>we require</b> only <b>a flawed rental, what is there to say</b> in this regard? Why shouldn’t the gentile want to rent out his residence? The Gemara answers: <b>Even so, the gentile is concerned</b> about <b>witchcraft,</b> i.e., that the procedure is used to cast a spell on him, <b>and</b> therefore he <b>does not rent out</b> his residence.

### Part 13
The Gemara examines the ruling in the <i>Tosefta</i> cited in the previous discussion. Returning to <b>the matter itself: The courtyard of a gentile is like the pen of an animal, and it is permitted to carry in and carry out from the courtyard to the houses and from the houses to the courtyard,</b> as the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>eiruvin</i> do not apply to the residences of gentiles.

### Part 14
<b>But if there is one Jew</b> living <b>there</b> in the same courtyard as the gentile, the gentile <b>renders it prohibited</b> for the Jew to carry from his house to the courtyard or vice versa. The Jew may carry there only if he rents the gentile’s property for the duration of Shabbat. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Actually,</b> the gentile <b>does not render it prohibited</b> for the Jew to carry <b>unless there are two Jews</b> living in the same courtyard who themselves would <b>prohibit one another</b> from carrying if there were no <i>eiruv</i>, and the presence of the gentile renders the <i>eiruv</i> ineffective.
