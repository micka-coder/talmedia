### Part 1
<b>And one said:</b> In the case <b>of wine, everyone agrees that two are required,</b> both a merging of alleyways and a joining of courtyards. <b>When they disagree</b> is in a case where an <i>eiruv</i> was established <b>with bread:</b> Rabbi Meir maintains that both a merging of alleyways and a joining of courtyards are required, whereas the Rabbis say that one is sufficient.

### Part 2
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the <i>baraita</i> itself. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> One may <b>either establish an <i>eiruv</i> or a merging</b> of alleyways. <b>What,</b> does it <b>not</b> mean that one <b>either establishes an <i>eiruv</i> in the courtyard with bread or a merging in the alleyway with wine,</b> which indicates that they also disagreed in a case where a merging of alleyways was established with wine?

### Part 3
<b>Rav Giddel said that Rav said</b> that the Rabbis were <b>saying as follows:</b> One may <b>either establish an <i>eiruv</i> in the courtyard with bread, and</b> it would <b>be</b> rendered <b>permitted</b> to carry both <b>here,</b> in the courtyard, <b>and there,</b> in the alleyway, <b>or</b> one may <b>establish a merging</b> of alleyways <b>in the alleyway with bread, and</b> it would <b>be</b> rendered <b>permitted</b> to carry both <b>here,</b> in the courtyard, <b>and there,</b> in the alleyway.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. And Rav Huna said:</b> No clear halakhic ruling was issued in his favor, but <b>the custom is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> Therefore, if someone asks, he should be instructed to act accordingly. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is not even a custom established by the Sages. Rather, <b>the people were accustomed</b> to act <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> and we do not tell them they have acted inappropriately.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>five groups</b> of people <b>who spent Shabbat in one hall [<i>teraklin</i>]</b> that was subdivided by partitions into separate rooms, each of which had a separate entrance to a courtyard that was shared with other houses, <b>Beit Shammai say: An <i>eiruv</i></b> is required <b>for each and every group,</b> i.e., each group must contribute separately to the <i>eiruv</i> of the courtyard, as each is considered a different house. <b>And Beit Hillel say: One <i>eiruv</i></b> suffices <b>for all of them,</b> as the partitions do not render the different sections separate houses.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> Beit Hillel <b>concede</b> that <b>when some of them occupy</b> separate <b>rooms or upper stories, they require</b> a separate <b><i>eiruv</i> for each and every group,</b> and the fact that they are in the same building does not render them one unified group.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> applies only where they divided the hall <b>with a partition of pegs [<i>mesifas</i>]. However,</b> if they divided it <b>with</b> a sturdy <b>partition ten</b> handbreadths high, <b>all agree</b> that a separate contribution to the <b><i>eiruv</i></b> is required <b>for each and every group,</b> as this certainly divides the hall into separate living quarters. <b>Some say</b> a different version of the previous passage, according to which <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> as follows: <b>Even</b> where they merely divided the room <b>with a partition of pegs,</b> there is a <b>dispute</b> about whether this is considered a full-fledged partition.

### Part 8
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>disagreed about</b> this issue. <b>One</b> of them <b>said:</b> This <b>dispute is with regard to partitions that reach the ceiling, but</b> with regard to <b>partitions that do not reach the ceiling, all agree</b> that <b>one <i>eiruv</i></b> suffices <b>for all of them,</b> as the partitions do not turn the compartments into separate houses. <b>And one said:</b> This <b>dispute is with regard to partitions that do not reach the ceiling, but</b> with regard to <b>partitions that reach the ceiling, all agree</b> that the compartments are considered separate living quarters, and <b>they require</b> a separate contribution to the <b><i>eiruv</i> for each and every group.</b>
