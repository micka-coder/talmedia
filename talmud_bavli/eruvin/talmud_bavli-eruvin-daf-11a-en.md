### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in <b>the opposite</b> situation? Does an opening in the form of a doorway also serve to permit carrying in an alleyway that is more than twenty cubits high?

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the answer to this question, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the cross beam placed over the entrance to <b>an alleyway is higher than twenty cubits, one must diminish</b> its height, <b>but if</b> the entrance <b>has an opening in the form of a doorway, he need not diminish it.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the effect of <b>a cornice with</b> regard to the need to diminish the alleyway’s <b>width?</b> Does the cornice render the alleyway fit for one to carry within it, even if the entrance is more than ten cubits wide? The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the cross beam placed over the entrance to <b>an alleyway is higher than twenty cubits, one must diminish</b> its height, <b>and</b> if the alleyway is <b>wider than ten</b> cubits, <b>one must diminish</b> its width. <b>However, if</b> the entrance to the alleyway <b>has an opening in the form of a doorway, he need not diminish it, and,</b> similarly, <b>if it has a cornice, he need not diminish it.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara explains the proof it wishes to adduce from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What, is</b> this statement with regard to the cornice <b>not</b> referring <b>to the latter</b> clause, i.e., the case of an alleyway that is wider than ten cubits, proving that a cornice can render an alleyway otherwise too wide fit for one to carry within it? The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>No,</b> this statement is referring <b>to the first</b> clause of the <i>baraita</i>, that a cornice is effective for an alleyway more than twenty cubits high, but it tells us nothing about one that is more than ten cubits wide.

### Part 5
With regard to the same issue, <b>Rav Yehuda would teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> to <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav before Rav</b> as follows: If the entrance to an alleyway that is wider than ten cubits has an opening in the form of a doorway, <b>he need not diminish</b> its width. Rav <b>said to him: Teach him</b> that the correct version of the <i>baraita</i> is: <b>He must diminish</b> its width.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Yosef said: From the statement of our teacher,</b> Rav, who said that the entrance to an alleyway must be diminished even if it has an opening in the form of a doorway, <b>we will learn</b> that with regard to <b>a courtyard,</b> the walls of <b>which are mostly entrances and windows, it is not permitted</b> to carry within it even <b>by</b> having an opening in <b>the form of a doorway.</b> Even if the entrances have an opening in the form of a doorway, this does not render a mostly breached courtyard wall into a closed wall.

### Part 7
<b>What is the reason? Since</b> an opening of <b>more than ten</b> cubits <b>renders it prohibited</b> for one to carry <b>in an alleyway, and</b> likewise when the <b>breached</b> segment of a wall that <b>is greater than its standing</b> segment <b>renders it prohibited</b> for one to carry <b>in a courtyard,</b> the following claim can be made: <b>Just as,</b> according to Rav, in the case of an opening <b>more than ten</b> cubits wide <b>that renders it prohibited</b> for one to carry <b>in an alleyway,</b> carrying in the alleyway <b>is not permitted by the form of a doorway</b> in the opening, <b>so</b> too a case where <b>breached</b> segment of a wall <b>is greater than its standing</b> segment <b>that renders it prohibited</b> for one to carry <b>in a courtyard,</b> carrying in the courtyard <b>is not permitted by the form of a doorway</b> in the opening.

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>What</b> is the basis for comparison to an opening that is <b>more than ten</b> cubits wide <b>that renders it prohibited</b> for one to carry <b>in an alleyway?</b> It is not permitted by having an opening in the form of a doorway <b>because you did not permit</b> an opening of that size <b>with regard to</b> the case of upright <b>boards surrounding a well, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> Can <b>you say</b> the same <b>in a</b> case where the <b>breached</b> segment of a wall is <b>greater than the standing</b> segment <b>that renders it prohibited</b> for one to carry <b>in a courtyard,</b> that carrying in the courtyard will not be permitted by the form of a doorway? That situation is clearly not as severe a problem, <b>as you permitted</b> carrying <b>with regard to</b> upright <b>boards surrounding a well according to everyone.</b> Consequently, no comparison can be made between the case of an opening wider than ten cubits in an alleyway and a partition in which the breached segment is greater than the standing segment in a courtyard.

### Part 9
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> this opinion that the form of a doorway is ineffective in a case where the breached segments of a wall are greater than its standing segments: With regard to the area enclosed by <b>these walls that most of them</b> consist of <b>entrances and windows,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to carry on Shabbat therein, <b>provided that the standing</b> segments <b>are greater than the breached</b> segments.

### Part 10
The Gemara first analyzes the wording of the <i>baraita</i>: The Gemara analyzes the formulation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Can it enter your mind that</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where most of</b> the walls are entrances and windows? If so, the standing segments are not greater than the breached segments. <b>Rather,</b> emend the <i>baraita</i>: Carrying in the area enclosed by these walls <b>to which he added</b> many <b>entrances and windows is permitted, provided that the standing</b> segments <b>are greater than the breached</b> segments. Apparently, if the breached segments are greater than the standing segments, carrying is not permitted even if the breaches are in the form of doorways.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Kahana said</b> that his is not an absolute proof: <b>When this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught,</b> it was taught <b>with regard to broken entrances</b> [<i>pitḥei shima’ei</i>] that lack the proper form of doorways.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What are broken entrances? Rav Reḥumei and Rav Yosef disagreed</b> on the matter. <b>One said that they do not have</b> proper <b>doorposts, and</b> the other <b>one said that they do not have lintels</b> above the openings.

### Part 13
The Gemara comments: <b>And even Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that</b> opinion <b>of Rav,</b> that an opening in the form of a doorway does not permit carrying if the opening is more than ten cubits wide. <b>As Ravin bar Rav Adda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a person from the valley of Beit Ḥortan who stuck four poles</b> [<b><i>kunddeisin</i></b>] into the ground <b>in the four corners of</b> his <b>field, and stretched a vine over them,</b> creating the form of a doorway on each side. He intended to seal the area so that he would be permitted to plant a vineyard in close proximity without creating a forbidden mixture of diverse kinds in a vineyard. <b>And the case came before the Sages, and they permitted him</b> to consider it sealed <b>with regard to diverse kinds.</b>

### Part 14
<b>And Reish Lakish said: Just as they permitted him</b> to consider it sealed <b>with regard to diverse kinds, so</b> too <b>they permitted him</b> to consider it sealed <b>with regard to Shabbat,</b> i.e., they permitted carrying within this area. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: With regard to diverse kinds, they permitted him</b> to consider it sealed, however, <b>with regard to Shabbat, they did not permit him</b> to do so.

### Part 15
The Gemara clarifies: <b>With what</b> case <b>are we dealing</b> here? <b>If you say</b> that he draped the vines on the posts <b>from the side,</b> rather than on top of them, <b>didn’t Rav Ḥisda say</b> with regard to Shabbat: If <b>one constructed</b> an opening in <b>the form of a doorway from the side, he has done nothing?</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that he set the vines <b>on top of</b> the posts. <b>And in what</b> circumstances did Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish disagree? <b>If you say</b> that the posts were set at a distance <b>of ten</b> cubits from each other, <b>would Rabbi Yoḥanan say in that</b> case that <b>with regard to Shabbat,</b> they did <b>not</b> permit him to consider the area sealed? Everyone agrees that the form of a doorway is effective for an entrance that is only ten cubits wide.

### Part 17
<b>Rather, isn’t</b> it referring to a case <b>where</b> the posts were <b>more than ten</b> cubits apart? Apparently, Rabbi Yoḥanan agrees with Rav, that an opening in the form of a doorway does not permit carrying if the original opening is wider than ten cubits.

### Part 18
The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>No, actually</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the posts were <b>ten</b> cubits apart, <b>and</b> the person attached the vines to the posts <b>from the side. And</b> Reish Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>disagree with regard to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda.</b> Reish Lakish maintains that the form of a doorway is effective even when the horizontal cross beam is attached to the vertical posts from the side, and Rabbi Yoḥanan agrees with Rav Ḥisda that a form of a doorway is ineffective for the purpose of carrying on Shabbat when constructed in such a manner.

### Part 19
The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> it is possible to <b>raise a contradiction</b> between this statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan; and</b> it is possible to <b>raise a contradiction</b> between this statement <b>of Reish Lakish and</b> another statement <b>of Reish Lakish. As Reish Lakish said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥanina:</b>
