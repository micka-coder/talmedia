### Part 1
<b>as there are partitions. And Shmuel said: One may move</b> an object <b>in it only within four cubits,</b> as <b>the partitions</b> of the ship are not considered full-fledged partitions; they <b>are erected</b> only <b>to keep water out,</b> not to render it a residence.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef said to Shmuel:</b> Is <b>the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with your</b> opinion <b>or</b> is <b>the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav?</b> Shmuel <b>said to him: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> as his rationale is more convincing.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef said: And Rav concedes that if one overturned</b> the ship <b>onto its mouth,</b> and it is more than ten handbreadths high, <b>that one may move</b> an object <b>on it only within four cubits.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> purpose <b>was</b> the ship <b>overturned? If you say</b> it was overturned so <b>that</b> one may <b>reside beneath it, what is the difference</b> between it and <b>an isolated roof?</b> The legal status of the overturned ship should in every sense be that of a house, and therefore it should be permitted to carry throughout the entire ship.

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> it must be <b>that he overturned it to tar it,</b> i.e., to add a fresh coat to its underside. In that case, the boat certainly does not serve as a residence, and its sides are not considered full-fledged partitions.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Ashi teaches</b> Shmuel’s acceptance of Rav’s opposing view (Ritva) with regard <b>to a ship,</b> as stated above; <b>and Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, teaches it</b> with regard <b>to a portico, as it was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to <b>a portico</b> located <b>in a field.</b> A portico has a roof and either incomplete walls or no walls. Consequently, in the case of a portico located in a valley, which is a <i>karmelit</i>, it remains to be determined whether or not it is permitted to carry in it. <b>Rav said: It is permitted to move</b> an object <b>throughout the entire</b> portico, as it is a private domain. <b>And Shmuel said: One may move</b> an object <b>in it only within four</b> cubits.

### Part 6
The Gemara elaborates. <b>Rav said: It is permitted to move</b> an object <b>throughout the entire</b> portico, as <b>we say: The edge of the roof descends</b> to the ground <b>and seals</b> the portico on all sides, rendering it a private domain. <b>And Shmuel said: One may move</b> an object <b>in it only within four</b> cubits, as <b>we do not say: The edge of the roof descends</b> to the ground <b>and seals</b> the portico.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to <b>Rav’s</b> statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir</b> that one is permitted to carry from one roof to another if they are level, it should also be permitted <b>to carry from a roof to a courtyard.</b> Why then does Rabbi Meir rule that roofs and courtyards are separate domains and that carrying between them is prohibited? The Gemara answers: It is prohibited because Rabbi Meir issued <b>a decree, due to</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi.</b> As stated previously, Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi rules that one may not transfer objects between two halakhically equivalent but physically distinct domains ten or more handbreadths high. This is a decree lest one standing in a public domain adjust a burden on a mound ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide, which is a private domain, an act prohibited by Torah law.

### Part 8
The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> according to <b>Shmuel’s</b> statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> that the legal status of an isolated roof greater than two <i>beit se’a</i> is that of a <i>karmelit</i>, it should be permitted <b>to move</b> an object <b>from</b> an isolated <b>roof to an enclosure</b> within four cubits of the roof, as the legal status of the enclosure is also that of a <i>karmelit</i>. Why then do the Rabbis rule that roofs and enclosures are separate domains and carrying from one to the other is prohibited? <b>Rava bar Ulla said:</b> It is prohibited because the Rabbis issued <b>a decree lest the</b> area of the <b>roof diminish</b> to less than two <i>beit se’a</i>, in which case it would assume the status of a private domain, as it is prohibited to carry between a private domain and an enclosure.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, one should also not</b> be permitted to <b>move</b> an object <b>from one enclosure to</b> another <b>enclosure,</b> due to the concern that <b>perhaps</b> the area of one of the enclosures will <b>diminish</b> and become a private domain, <b>and he</b> will <b>come</b> to <b>move</b> an object from one to the other as before. The Gemara answers: <b>There, if</b> the enclosure <b>is diminished, the matter is conspicuous,</b> as its walls are clearly visible. <b>Here,</b> however, <b>if</b> the roof <b>is diminished, the matter is not conspicuous,</b> as the roof does not have walls.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> After careful analysis, <b>you will find</b> that you can <b>say</b> that <b>according to the statement of Rabbi Meir, roofs are a domain in and of themselves,</b> and one may carry from one roof to another; and likewise <b>courtyards are</b> considered <b>a domain in and of themselves,</b> and one may likewise carry from one courtyard to another.
