### Part 1
<b>One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> for a priest who is</b> ritually <b>pure with <i>teruma</i> that is</b> ritually <b>pure</b> and resting <b>on a grave,</b> even though the location is impure and he cannot reach it. <b>How does he go</b> there? <b>In a carriage, crate, or cupboard,</b> which shield him from the ritual impurity.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> it true that <b>once</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>was placed</b> directly on the grave, the <i>teruma</i> <b>became defiled,</b> and ritually impure <i>teruma</i> is not fit to be eaten by anyone? The Gemara answers: We are dealing here with a case <b>where</b> the <i>teruma</i> <b>had not yet been rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, as it had not yet come into contact with a liquid. Produce that has yet to come into contact with a liquid does not contract impurity. <b>Or</b> we are dealing with bread <b>that was kneaded with fruit juice,</b> which is not one of the seven liquids that render a food susceptible to ritual impurity.

### Part 3
The Gemara now asks: <b>How can he bring it</b> from where it is resting on the grave in order to eat it? The Gemara answers: <b>With flat wooden utensils</b> that are not shaped as receptacles and therefore <b>do not contract</b> ritual <b>impurity.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>Doesn’t</b> the utensil <b>cover</b> the grave? The Sages decreed that anyone who holds a utensil that is a handbreadth wide over a corpse or grave is ritually impure. The Gemara answers: <b>He may bring it on the edge</b> of the utensil while holding the utensil sideways so that it does not form a cover that is a handbreadth wide over the grave.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> that is <b>so,</b> and there is a way for the <i>teruma</i> to remain ritually pure and for the priest to access it, <b>what is the reason</b> the Sages disagreed with Rabbi Yehuda and did not allow an <i>eiruv</i> to be established for a priest on a grave? The Gemara answers: <b>They hold</b> that <b>it is prohibited to acquire a home with items from which benefit is prohibited.</b> It is prohibited to derive benefit from a grave. Since one acquires a place of residence for Shabbat by means of the <i>eiruv</i>, it would be as if the priest acquired a home for himself with something from which he may not derive benefit.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: If so, does this prove <b>by inference that Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>it is permitted</b> to acquire a home with items from which benefit is prohibited? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> that <b>mitzvot were not given for benefit.</b> The fulfillment of a mitzva is not in itself considered a benefit. Since the acquisition of a place of residence by means of an <i>eiruv</i> is a mitzva, as one may establish an <i>eiruv teḥumin</i> only for the sake of a mitzva, it is even permitted to establish one’s <i>eiruv</i> in a place from which it is prohibited to benefit.

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests: <b>But</b> if so, with regard to <b>that which Rava said: Mitzvot were not given for benefit, let us say</b> that <b>he stated his <i>halakha</i></b> only <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of one side in a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you: If they hold that one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> only for the sake of a mitzva, all would agree</b> that the <i>eiruv</i> may be placed on a grave because <b>mitzvot were not given for benefit.</b> However, the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Sages centers on a different aspect of the issue. <b>Here, they disagree with regard to this: One Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> only for the sake of a mitzva.</b> Since mitzvot do not constitute forbidden benefit, it is therefore permitted to make use of the grave. <b>And one Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> even for a voluntary matter.</b> Establishing a Shabbat residence on the site of a grave by means of an <i>eiruv</i> made for a voluntary matter is regarded as forbidden benefit, and therefore it is prohibited.

### Part 8
The Gemara suggests: <b>But</b> if so, with regard to <b>that which Rav Yosef said</b> as a general principle: <b>One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> only for the sake of a mitzva, let us say</b> that <b>he stated his <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> one side in a dispute between the <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yosef</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> In fact, <b>all agree</b> that <b>one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> only for the sake of a mitzva, and all agree</b> that <b>mitzvot were not given for benefit, and they disagree with regard to this: One Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds: Once</b> he <b>acquired his</b> Shabbat residence at twilight by means of the <b><i>eiruv</i>, he is indifferent to its safeguarding,</b> as his main goal has already been achieved. He has no further need for the food used for the <i>eiruv</i>, and therefore, he receives no benefit from its placement on the grave. <b>And one Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds: It is pleasing to him that</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>is safeguarded, for if he needs</b> it the next day, <b>he can eat it.</b> According to this opinion, he would be making prohibited use of the grave to preserve his meal for the following day, and therefore the Sages prohibited placing an <i>eiruv</i> on a grave.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with <i>demai</i>,</b> produce purchased from one who may not have separated the required tithes, <b>and</b> similarly, one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with</b> the <b>first tithe whose <i>teruma</i> has been taken</b> in order to be given to a priest, <b>and with</b> the <b>second tithe and consecrated articles that have been redeemed; and priests</b> may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> the portion of dough that must be given to a priest.

### Part 11
<b>However,</b> one may <b>not</b> establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with <i>tevel</i>,</b> produce from which the priestly dues [<i>teruma</i>] and other tithes have not been separated, <b>nor with first tithe whose <i>teruma</i>,</b> which must be given to a priest, <b>has not been taken, nor with</b> the <b>second tithe or consecrated articles that have not been redeemed.</b>

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: How can one establish an <i>eiruv</i> with <b><i>demai</i>? Isn’t it unfit for him?</b> Since it is prohibited to eat <i>demai</i>, how can it be used as an <i>eiruv</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Since if he wants, he could declare his property ownerless, and he would be a poor</b> person, <b>and</b> the <i>demai</i> would then <b>be fit for him,</b> as a poor person is permitted to eat <i>demai</i>, <b>now too,</b> even though he has not renounced ownership of his property, <b>it is</b> considered <b>fit for him</b> to use as an <i>eiruv</i>. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One may feed the poor <i>demai</i>,</b>
