### Part 1
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>If</b> the roof in the covered section of the <i>karpef</i> <b>were made like an enclosed veranda</b> whose roof is level, <b>indeed,</b> both Rava and Rabbi Zeira would agree that the edge of the roof descends to the ground and closes up the area. <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case where the roof <b>is made like a hammock,</b> i.e., slanted, and therefore one cannot say that the edge of the roof descends to the ground and encloses the area.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: I agree</b> with Rava <b>with regard to a <i>karpef</i> that is fully breached into a courtyard,</b> meaning the entire wall between them is breached, <b>that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to carry in it. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Because the</b> additional <b>space of the courtyard</b> joins to the <i>karpef</i> and <b>renders it in excess</b> of two <i>beit se’a</i>. Consequently, it is prohibited to carry in it.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yosef strongly objects to this</b> explanation: <b>Does a space</b> in <b>which it is permitted to</b> carry, the courtyard, <b>render</b> the <i>karpef</i>, <b>prohibited?</b> Given that it had been permitted beforehand to carry from the courtyard to the <i>karpef</i>, why say that now that the partition between them is breached, the additional space, which was itself permitted, should render it prohibited to carry in the <i>karpef</i>?

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said to him: In accordance with whose</b> opinion do you say this? Apparently, it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that one is permitted to carry from a courtyard to a <i>karpef</i>. But <b>even according to Rabbi Shimon, there is the space where the walls</b> that are now breached had once stood. This space had not been fit for carrying from the outset, even according to Rabbi Shimon; therefore, if the <i>karpef</i> had been at first exactly the area of two <i>beit se’a</i>, it would be prohibited to carry in the entire <i>karpef</i> due to the additional space of the fallen walls.

### Part 5
This is <b>as Rav Ḥisda said</b> with regard to <b>a <i>karpef</i> that is fully breached into a courtyard:</b> In <b>the courtyard</b> one is <b>permitted</b> to carry <b>and</b> in <b>the <i>karpef</i></b> he is <b>prohibited</b> to carry.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: As for the <b>courtyard, what is the reason</b> that this is permitted? Is it <b>because it has the remnants</b> of the original walls on either side of the breach, which allow the breach to be treated like an entrance? <b>But at times you find</b> just <b>the opposite;</b> if the courtyard was narrower than the <i>karpef</i> and the partition between them was fully breached, it is the <i>karpef</i> that retains the remnants of the original walls on either side of the breach, while the courtyard is breached in its entirety.

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>because we say</b> that with regard to <b>this</b> one, the <i>karpef</i>, which was not enclosed for the purpose of residence and where one is permitted to carry only if it is no more than two <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>the space of the</b> fallen <b>walls renders it in excess</b> of two <i>beit se’a</i>. However, with regard to <b>that</b> one, the courtyard, which was enclosed for the purpose of residence and where there is no size limit above which it is prohibited to carry, <b>the space of the</b> fallen <b>walls does not render it in excess of</b> any limit.

### Part 8
The Gemara cites a related incident: <b>A certain orchard [<i>bustana</i>] was adjacent to the wall of a mansion [<i>apadna</i>].</b> The orchard was larger than two <i>beit se’a</i> and was enclosed for the purpose of residence by a wall, part of which was the wall of the mansion. One day <b>the outer wall of the mansion,</b> which also served as a wall for the orchard, <b>collapsed. Rav Beivai thought to say</b> that <b>we can rely upon</b> one of <b>the</b> mansion’s <b>inner walls</b> to serve as a partition for the orchard and thereby permit one to carry there in the future as well.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Pappi said to him: Because you come from truncated [<i>mula’ei</i>] people,</b> as Rav Beivai’s family traced their lineage to the house of Eli, all of whose descendants were destined to be short-lived (see i Samuel 2:31), <b>you speak truncated [<i>mulayata</i>] matters,</b> as the inner wall cannot be relied upon at all. That is because <b>these walls were made for the inside</b> of the mansion, and <b>they were not made for the outside;</b> that is, they were not designed from the outset to serve as partitions for the orchard.

### Part 10
The Gemara relates: <b>The Exilarch had a</b> banqueting <b>pavilion [<i>abvarneka</i>] in his orchard</b> that was larger than two <i>beit se’a</i> and that had not been enclosed from the outset for the purpose of residence. The Exilarch <b>said to Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana: Let the Master make</b> some <b>arrangement so that tomorrow,</b> on Shabbat, <b>we may eat bread there,</b> i.e., so that we may be permitted to carry food and utensils from the house to the pavilion via the orchard.

### Part 11
Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana <b>went and erected</b> a fence of <b>reeds,</b> each reed separated from the next by <b>less than three</b> handbreadths. That is to say, he erected two such partitions between the house and the pavilion with a passageway between them, through which the Exilarch and his men could carry whatever they needed, as the partitions were constructed in the proper manner for the purpose of residence. <b>Rava,</b> however, <b>went</b>
