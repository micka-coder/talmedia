<b>what he gains</b> in distance through his <i>eiruv</i> on one side of the city <b>he loses</b> on the other side.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It</b> might <b>enter your mind</b> to say that when the mishna states that one was standing <b>to the east,</b> it means that he was standing <b>to the east of his house</b> and that he had instructed his son to establish an <i>eiruv</i> to the west of his house. Similarly, when it states that he was standing <b>to the west,</b> it means that he was positioned <b>to the west of his house</b> and that he had instructed his son to establish an <i>eiruv</i> to the east of his house. In such a case, the person’s house is located between him and his <i>eiruv</i>.

### Part 3
If so, the question arises: <b>Granted,</b> the mishna’s case where there is a distance of <b>two thousand cubits from his</b> current location <b>to his house, and</b> the distance <b>to his <i>eiruv</i> is greater than this, you can find, as</b> it is possible <b>that he can reach his house</b> without traveling two thousand cubits <b>and he cannot reach his <i>eiruv</i>. But where do you find</b> a case where there is a distance of <b>two thousand cubits between him and his <i>eiruv</i>, and</b> the distance <b>to his house is greater than this?</b> The person’s house is located between him and his <i>eiruv</i>.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Do you think</b> that <b>to the east</b> means that he was standing <b>to the east of his house, and to the west</b> means that he was standing <b>to the west of his house? No, to the east</b> means <b>to the east of his son,</b> who is depositing his <i>eiruv</i> for him, and <b>to the west means to the west of his son.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rava bar Rav Sheila said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that <b>to the east</b> means <b>to the east of his house and to the west</b> means <b>to the west of his house,</b> the mishna can be understood as referring to <b>a case where his house stood</b> along <b>a diagonal</b> line in relation to the person and his <i>eiruv</i>. In that case, although he is to the west of his house and the <i>eiruv</i> is located to its east, he can still be closer to his <i>eiruv</i> than he is to his house.

### Part 6
We learned in the mishna: <b>One who places his <i>eiruv</i> within the outskirts</b> of the city has not accomplished anything. However, if he places it outside the city limits, it is effective. The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>Can it enter your mind</b> that the mishna is dealing with a case where one placed his <i>eiruv</i> <b>outside the</b> Shabbat <b>limit?</b> If the <i>eiruv</i> is outside the Shabbat limit as measured from his physical location at the onset of Shabbat, he cannot access it on Shabbat; it is therefore ineffective in establishing his Shabbat residence. <b>Rather,</b> correct it and <b>say</b> as follows: If one placed his <i>eiruv</i> <b>outside</b> the city’s <b>outskirts,</b> i.e., beyond the area of slightly more than seventy cubits surrounding the city, the <i>eiruv</i> is effective in establishing his Shabbat residence at that location.

### Part 7
We learned in the next clause of the mishna concerning one who places his <i>eiruv</i> even one cubit beyond the city’s boundary: <b>That which he gains</b> on one side of the city <b>he loses</b> on the other. The Gemara expresses surprise: Does that mean that only <b>that which he gains</b> on one side he loses on the other, <b>and no more? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who places his <i>eiruv</i> within the outskirts of the city, he has not done anything;</b> if, however, <b>he placed it outside the outskirts of the city, even one cubit</b> outside, <b>he gains that cubit and loses the entire city because the measure of the city is included in the measure of his</b> Shabbat <b>limit?</b> If one’s Shabbat residence had been in the city, the two thousand cubits of his Shabbat limit would have been measured from the edge of the city’s outskirts; now that he has established his Shabbat residence outside the city, the city itself is included in the two thousand cubits, and he may lose far more on that side than he will gain on the other side.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where his measure</b> of two thousand cubits <b>terminated in the middle of the city;</b> whereas <b>there</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where his measure terminated at the</b> far <b>end of the city.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion stated by <b>Rabbi Idi, as Rabbi Idi said that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> If one <b>was measuring</b> the two thousand cubits of his Shabbat limit from the location of his Shabbat residence outside the city, <b>and his measure terminated in the middle of the city, he has only half the city,</b> i.e., he may walk only to the end of his two thousand cubits. If, however, <b>his measure terminated at the</b> far <b>end of the city, the entire city is regarded as four cubits, and he completes the rest</b> of the Shabbat limit on the other side of the city.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Idi said: These are nothing more than words of prophecy,</b> i.e., I do not see the logic behind this statement. <b>What</b> difference is it <b>to me</b> if the measure <b>terminated in the middle of the city, or</b> if it <b>terminated at the</b> far <b>end of the city?</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rava said:</b> They are not words of prophecy, as <b>both</b> cases <b>were taught</b> in the following mishna: <b>The residents of a large city may walk through an entire small city</b> that is fully included within its Shabbat limit; the small city is considered as though it were four cubits, and the rest of the Shabbat limit is measured from the other side of the city.
