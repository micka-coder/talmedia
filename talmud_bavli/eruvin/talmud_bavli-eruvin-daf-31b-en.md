<b>and</b> one may also feed <b>soldiers <i>demai</i>.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Huna said: It was taught</b> that <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not feed the impoverished <i>demai</i>. And Beit Hillel say: One may feed the impoverished <i>demai</i>.</b> The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel.

### Part 3
We learned in the mishna: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with first tithe</b> whose <i>teruma</i> <b>has been taken.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>It is obvious</b> that if the <i>teruma</i> was already taken there is no problem. Why is it necessary to state it may be used for an <i>eiruv</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>It is only necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> in a case where the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest while the grain was still <b>on the stalks,</b> i.e., the Levite took his tithe before the grain was threshed and before the priest took the <i>teruma</i>; <b>and the <i>teruma</i> of the tithes was taken from it</b> but <b><i>teruma gedola</i> was not taken from it.</b> Therefore, since the <i>teruma</i> is generally separated first, a portion of the first tithe that the Levite took should have been separated as <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 4
<b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion that <b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> said that <b>Reish Lakish said, as Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Reish Lakish said: First tithe,</b> in a case <b>where</b> the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest while the grain was still <b>on the stalks, is exempt from <i>teruma gedola</i>, as it is stated: “And you shall set apart from it a gift for the Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe”</b> (Numbers 18:26), from which the following inference is made: <b>A tenth part of the tithe,</b> i.e., the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, <b>I told you,</b> the Levite, to separate. <b>And</b> I did <b>not</b> tell you to separate <b><i>teruma gedola</i> and the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe.</b>

### Part 5
With regard to this matter, <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: If so, even</b> if the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest after the kernels of grain were removed from the stalks and placed <b>in a pile,</b> the Levite should still not have to separate <i>teruma gedola</i>. Abaye <b>said to him: With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states: “From all that is given to you, you shall set apart that which is the Lord’s <i>teruma</i>”</b> (Numbers 18:29). The inclusive phrase “from all” indicates that <i>teruma gedola</i> must be separated even from the first tithe in the case where the Levite precedes the priest after the grain has been collected in a pile.

### Part 6
Rav Pappa asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you to expound one verse as exempting the Levite from separating <i>teruma gedola</i> from first tithe that has been separated while the grain was on the stalks, and to expound another verse as requiring <i>teruma gedola</i> to be separated when the Levite took his first tithe after the grain was collected in a pile? Abaye answers: <b>This</b> produce, which has been threshed and placed into piles, is completely processed and <b>has become grain, and that</b> produce, which remained on the stalks, <b>did not</b> yet <b>become grain.</b> The wording of the biblical verses indicates that the requirement to separate <i>teruma</i> applies only to grain, whereas the produce is not considered grain until it has been threshed.

### Part 7
The mishna also stated that one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with</b> the <b>second tithe and consecrated</b> food <b>that have been redeemed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>It is obvious</b> that these foods may be used to establish an <i>eiruv</i>. The Gemara answers: This ruling <b>was only needed</b> for a case <b>where one</b> redeemed the second tithe or consecrated food and <b>paid the principle but did not pay the</b> additional <b>fifth</b> of their value, which must be paid when they are redeemed. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the failure to pay <b>the</b> additional <b>fifth does not invalidate</b> the redemption. Once the principle is paid, even if payment of the additional fifth is still outstanding, the article is regarded as redeemed and may be used for mundane purposes.

### Part 8
The mishna further states: <b>But</b> one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with <i>tevel</i>,</b> produce from which the priestly dues and other tithes have not been separated. The Gemara asks: This too is <b>obvious,</b> as it is prohibited to eat or derive any benefit from <i>tevel</i>. The Gemara answers: This ruling <b>is only needed with regard to <i>tevel</i> that is considered <i>tevel</i> by rabbinic decree.</b> What is included in this category? <b>For example, if one planted</b> seeds <b>in an imperforated container,</b> one is exempt by Torah law from separating <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the resulting produce because Torah law does not consider produce grown in such a container to have grown from the ground.

### Part 9
The mishna stated that one may <b>not</b> establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with first tithe whose <i>teruma</i> has not been taken.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>It is obvious,</b> as such produce is <i>tevel</i>. The Gemara answers: This ruling <b>is only needed</b> for a case where the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest and took first tithe from <b>the pile, and</b> only <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe was taken from it,</b> but <b><i>teruma gedola</i> was not taken from it,</b> and the produce is therefore still <i>tevel</i>.

### Part 10
<b>Lest you say</b> the <i>halakha</i> in that case is <b>as Rav Pappa said to Abaye,</b> and the Levite is exempt from separating <i>teruma gedola</i>, and therefore the food may be used for an <i>eiruv</i>, the mishna <b>teaches us as</b> Abaye <b>responded to</b> Rav Pappa: If the Levite takes grain after it had been gathered in a pile, he must separate <i>teruma gedola</i>. Until he does so the produce may not be eaten.

### Part 11
We also learned in the mishna that one may <b>not</b> establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with</b> the <b>second tithe or consecrated</b> food <b>that have not been redeemed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>It is obvious</b> that these items may not be used.

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: This ruling <b>is only needed</b> for a case <b>where he redeemed them,</b> but <b>did not redeem them properly,</b> e.g., in the case of <b>second tithe that was redeemed with an unminted coin [<i>asimon</i>]. And the Torah says</b> with regard to the redemption of the second tithe: <b>And bind up [<i>vetzarta</i>] the money</b> in your hand” (Deuteronomy 14:25). This is expounded to mean that the second tithe may only be redeemed with <b>money that has a form [<i>tzura</i>]</b> engraved <b>upon it;</b> however, unminted coins are not considered money for the purpose of redeeming the second tithe.

### Part 13
With regard to <b>consecrated property,</b> the reference is to a case <b>where one redeemed it</b> by exchanging it <b>for land</b> instead of money, <b>as the Torah states: “He will give the money and it shall become his.”</b> Since the verse speaks of giving money, it may be inferred that consecrated property cannot be redeemed by giving the Temple treasury land of equivalent value.

### Part 14
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one sends his <i>eiruv</i> in the hands of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor,</b> all of whom are regarded as legally incompetent, <b>or in the hands of one who does not accept</b> the principle of <b><i>eiruv</i>, it is not</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> But <b>if one told another</b> person <b>to receive it from him</b> at a specific location and set it down in that spot, <b>it is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> The critical point in the establishment of an <i>eiruv</i> is that it must be deposited in the proper location by a competent person; but it is immaterial how the <i>eiruv</i> arrives there.

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Is a minor not</b> fit to set down an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>Didn’t Rav Huna say: A minor may collect the</b> food for an <b><i>eiruv</i></b> from the residents of a courtyard and establish an <i>eiruv</i> on their behalf even <i>ab initio</i>? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>here,</b> where the mishna invalidates an <i>eiruv</i> placed by a minor, it is referring <b>to an <i>eiruv</i> of</b> Shabbat <b>borders.</b> These laws are relatively stringent, as they require that one establish a new place of residence, which a minor cannot do. <b>There,</b> where Rav Huna said that a minor may collect the food for an <i>eiruv</i>, he was referring <b>to an <i>eiruv</i> of courtyards.</b> This type of <i>eiruv</i> is more lenient and may be established even by a minor, as all that is necessary is to join together domains that already exist.

### Part 16
We learned in the mishna: <b>Or</b> if one sends his <i>eiruv</i> <b>in the hands of one who does not accept</b> the principle of <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is this? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: A Samaritan [<i>Kuti</i>],</b> who does not accept the laws of the Sages with regard to <i>eiruv</i>.

### Part 17
The mishna also states: <b>And if he told another</b> person <b>to receive</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>from him, it is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> The Gemara challenges this statement: <b>Let us be concerned that perhaps</b> the minor or other incompetent person will <b>not bring</b> the <i>eiruv</i> to the other person. The Gemara responds: This may be answered <b>as Rav Ḥisda said</b> with regard to a different statement, that it was referring to a case <b>where he stands and watches him. Here, too,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the person sending the <i>eiruv</i> <b>stands and watches him</b> from afar until the <i>eiruv</i> reaches the person designated to receive it.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: But nonetheless, <b>let us be concerned that perhaps</b> the other person will <b>not take</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>from</b> the deaf-mute, imbecile, or minor and deposit it in the designated place. From a distance, one cannot see exactly what is happening. He only saw that the messenger arrived at his destination. The Gemara answers this question <b>as</b> follows: <b>Rav Yeḥiel said</b> in a different context that there is a legal <b>presumption</b> that <b>an agent fulfills his agency. Here, too,</b> there is a legal <b>presumption</b> that the <b>agent</b> appointed to accept the <i>eiruv</i> <b>fulfills his agency.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>Where were</b> these principles of <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rav Yeḥiel stated?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They were stated with regard to</b> the following, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one gave</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>to</b> a trained <b>elephant, and it brought it</b> to the place where he wanted the <i>eiruv</i> deposited, or if he gave it <b>to a monkey, and it brought it</b> to the proper location, <b>it is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>. But if he told another</b> person <b>to receive it from</b> the animal, <b>it is</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> the animal <b>will not bring</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>to</b> the person appointed to receive it? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> the person sending the <i>eiruv</i> <b>stands and watches it</b> from afar until it reaches the person designated to receive the <i>eiruv</i>. The Gemara asks further: But <b>perhaps</b> the person appointed to receive the <i>eiruv</i> <b>will not accept it from</b> the elephant or monkey. <b>Rav Yeḥiel said:</b> There is a legal <b>presumption</b> that <b>an agent fulfills his agency.</b>

### Part 20
<b>Rav Naḥman said: With regard to Torah</b> laws, we do <b>not</b> rely on the <b>presumption that an agent fulfills his agency;</b> rather, one must actually see the agent performing his mission.
