### Part 1
that the <i>baraita</i> teaches <b>two types of tree; here too,</b> then, you can say that it teaches <b>two types of fence,</b> and therefore no proof can be brought from this <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 2
<b>And Abaye</b> further <b>inquired of Rabba:</b> With regard to <b>a courtyard, the</b> open <b>end of which interposed between the boards</b> surrounding a well, <b>what is</b> the law <b>with regard to carrying from inside</b> the courtyard <b>to</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards, and from</b> the area <b>between the boards into</b> the courtyard? Rabba <b>said to him: It is permitted.</b>

### Part 3
Abaye then asked him: And if <b>two</b> adjacent courtyards interposed between the boards surrounding a well, <b>what</b> is the law? Is it permitted to carry from inside them to the area between the boards, and vice versa? Rabba <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>It is prohibited.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Huna said:</b> In the case of <b>two</b> courtyards, it <b>is prohibited</b> to carry, <b>even if</b> the residents of the two courtyards <b>made an <i>eiruv</i></b> together. This is because of <b>a decree lest they</b> come to <b>say</b> that <b>an <i>eiruv</i> is effective for</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards. Rava,</b> however, disagreed and <b>said:</b> If <b>they made an <i>eiruv</i></b> together, it <b>is permitted</b> to carry between the courtyards and the area between the boards, and vice versa; with the preparation of the <i>eiruv</i>, the two courtyards are regarded as one.

### Part 5
<b>Abaye said to Rava:</b> What <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>supports your</b> opinion, for the <i>baraita</i> states: In the case of <b>a courtyard, one end of which interposes between the</b> upright <b>boards</b> surrounding a well, <b>it is permitted to carry from inside</b> the courtyard <b>to</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards, and from</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards into</b> the courtyard, <b>but</b> if there were <b>two</b> adjacent courtyards, <b>this is prohibited. With regard to which case was this statement made?</b> The statement applies <b>where</b> the residents of the two courtyards <b>did not make an <i>eiruv</i></b> together; <b>but if they made an <i>eiruv</i></b> together, it <b>is permitted</b> to carry between the courtyards and the area between the boards, and vice versa.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>this is a refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Huna,</b> for the <i>baraita</i> explicitly contradicts his opinion? The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Rav Huna</b> could have <b>said to you: There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case where the two courtyards <b>later became joined</b> by means of the wall that separated them being breached, and it is clear to all that it is a single courtyard, so that there is no concern that people will say that an <i>eiruv</i> is effective for the area between the boards.

### Part 7
<b>Abaye asked Rabba</b> yet another question: If <b>the water</b> in the cistern <b>dried up on Shabbat, what is</b> the law? Is it still permitted to carry between the boards? Rabba <b>said to him:</b> The boards <b>are considered</b> a valid <b>partition only on account of the water;</b> since <b>there is no</b> longer any <b>water here, there is</b> also <b>no</b> longer a valid <b>partition here.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Ravin raised a dilemma: If the water</b> in the well <b>dried up on Shabbat, and</b> then <b>on</b> the same <b>Shabbat</b> it rained and other water <b>came</b> in its place, <b>what is</b> the law? Is the original allowance to carry restored? <b>Abaye said to him:</b> The case where the water <b>dried up on Shabbat should not be a dilemma for you, for I</b> already <b>raised this dilemma before my Master,</b> Rabba, <b>and he resolved for me that it is prohibited to</b> carry in the enclosed area.

### Part 9
The case where other water <b>came</b> on Shabbat <b>should also not be a dilemma for you, for</b> this <b>is</b> a case of <b>a partition erected on Shabbat, and it was</b> already <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Any partition erected on Shabbat, whether</b> it was erected <b>unwittingly, or whether intentionally, whether by unavoidable accident, or whether willingly, it is called</b> a valid <b>partition.</b> The fact that it was erected in a prohibited manner, in violation of prohibitions related to building, does not negate its effectiveness.

### Part 10
Ravin raised a difficulty: <b>Was it not stated with regard</b> to this <i>halakha</i> that <b>Rav Naḥman said: They only taught</b> that such a partition is called a partition as a stringency; it is prohibited by Torah law <b>to throw</b> objects from an area enclosed by such a partition into the public domain and vice versa, <b>but to carry in it</b> as a full-fledged private domain is <b>not</b> permitted by the Sages?

### Part 11
The Gemara refutes this objection: <b>Rav Naḥman’s statement applies</b> only in a case where the partition was erected <b>intentionally.</b> Since the partition was erected intentionally on Shabbat, the Sages imposed a penalty that it is prohibited to carry within the enclosed area. However, in the case of a partition that was erected unwittingly or that arose by itself, no such penalty was imposed, and it is permitted to carry there.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: One who throws</b> an object from the public domain <b>into</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards surrounding a well is liable.</b> The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious,</b> for <b>were it not</b> a valid <b>partition, how could he be permitted to draw</b> water from the well? This shows that it is a full-fledged private domain.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Elazar’s ruling <b>is only necessary</b> to teach that in the case <b>where one arrange</b> an enclosure <b>similar to the</b> upright <b>boards surrounding a well in the public domain,</b> in a place where there was no well, <b>and threw</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain, <b>he is liable.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Isn’t this obvious as well?</b> As, <b>were it not</b> regarded as <b>a partition in general, how could he be permitted to carry in</b> the case of <b>a cistern?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>It is only necessary</b> to teach you that <b>even though</b> such a partition does not bar entry and <b>many</b> people <b>pass through it,</b> it is nonetheless considered a partition in regard to Shabbat.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is he teaching us</b> by this statement, <b>that the</b> passage of <b>many</b> people <b>does not come and negate</b> the effectiveness of <b>a partition? But Rabbi Elazar stated</b> this idea <b>once</b> before.

### Part 16
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> the following with regard to the upright boards surrounding a well: <b>If the path of the public domain</b> passes through the area of the wells and the posts and <b>obstructs them, he</b> must <b>divert it to the sides,</b> or else the partition is invalid. <b>And the Rabbis say: He need not</b> divert the path of the public domain, for even if many people pass through there, the partition is valid. With regard to this mishna, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both said: Here,</b> the Rabbis <b>informed you of the strength of partitions.</b> Therefore, we see that Rabbi Elazar already expressed his opinion that the validity of a partition is not canceled by the passage of many people through it.

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it was derived <b>from there</b> alone, <b>I would have said</b> that what Rabbi Elazar meant is that <b>here</b> the Rabbis informed you of the strength of partitions, <b>but he,</b> Rabbi Elazar, <b>does not agree</b> with them. <b>He</b> therefore <b>teaches us</b> in his present ruling that what he meant is that <b>here</b> they informed you of this law <b>and he agrees</b> with them.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>say this</b> ruling that one who throws an object into the area enclosed by upright boards is liable, <b>and he would not have need to</b> make his <b>other</b> comment that here the Rabbis informed you of the strength of partitions. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Elazar did not in fact make two statements, but rather <b>one was stated by inference from the other.</b> He only made one of these statements explicitly; the other was reported by his students in his name based on an inference from what he had said.

### Part 19
We learned in the mishna: <b>It is permitted to bring</b> the upright boards <b>closer to the well,</b> provided that the enclosed area is large enough for a cow to stand in and drink, with its head and most of its body inside the partitioned space. Similarly, <b>we learned there</b> in a mishna: <b>A person may not stand in a public domain and drink in the private domain,</b> and likewise he may not stand <b>in the private domain and drink in a public domain, unless he brings his head and most of his</b> body <b>into the place where he is drinking.</b>
