<b>and whose fruit they do not taste.</b> This tree is evidently consecrated to the cult.

### Part 2
<b>And Shmuel said: For example, if they say: These dates are for the beer of the temple of Nitzrefei, which they drink on the day of their festival,</b> then this is enough to establish the tree as an <i>asheira</i>. <b>Ameimar said: And the elders of Pumbedita said to me</b> with regard to this issue: The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara returns to Rav Yehuda’s ruling that the barrel used for merging the alleyway must be raised a handbreadth from the ground. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How does one merge an alleyway? One brings a barrel of wine, or oil, or dates, or dried figs, or any other type of produce</b> for merging the alleyway.

### Part 4
<b>If</b> one contributed a barrel <b>of his own, he must confer possession</b> to all the other residents by means of another person who acquires it on their behalf. <b>And if</b> the barrel <b>is theirs, he must</b> at least <b>inform</b> them that he is merging the alleyway. <b>And</b> the one acquiring it on behalf of the others <b>raises</b> the barrel <b>a minimal amount from the ground.</b> Apparently, the barrel need not be raised a handbreadth. The Gemara answers: Here <b>too, what is</b> this <b>minimal amount of which</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>spoke?</b> This expression means <b>a handbreadth,</b> but no less.

### Part 5
<b>It is stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to the acquisition of a <b>merging of alleyways. Rav said: It is not necessary to confer possession</b> of the food used in merging the alleyway to all the residents of the alleyway; <b>and Shmuel said: It is necessary to confer possession</b> to them. They likewise disagreed with regard to a <b>joining of</b> Shabbat <b>boundaries,</b> but the opinions are reversed. <b>Rav said: It is necessary to confer possession</b> of the food to all those who wish to be included in the <i>eiruv</i>, <b>and Shmuel said: It is not necessary to confer possession</b> to them.

### Part 6
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> his reasoning is clear, as <b>here,</b> with regard to a merging of the alleyways, <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that he must confer possession, <b>whereas there,</b> with regard to a joining of Shabbat boundaries, <b>we did not learn</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i>. <b>However, according to Rav, what is the reason</b> that he differentiates between the cases in this manner?

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> the subject of a dispute between <b>the <i>tanna’im</i>, as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving</b> the <b>daughter-in-law of Rabbi Oshaya, who went</b> before Shabbat <b>to the bathhouse,</b> which was located beyond the Shabbat boundary, <b>and it grew dark</b> before <b>she</b> was able to return, <b>and her mother-in-law established a joining</b> of Shabbat boundaries for her so that she could return home.

### Part 8
<b>And the incident came before Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> for a ruling as to whether the <i>eiruv</i> is valid, <b>and he</b> ruled that it was not valid and <b>prohibited</b> her return. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said to him: Babylonian, are you so stringent with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>? This</b> is what my <b>father said: Any</b> case <b>where you have</b> the ability <b>to be lenient with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>, be lenient.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And a dilemma was raised</b> before the Sages: Did the mother-in-law <b>establish the <i>eiruv</i> for</b> her daughter-in-law <b>with the mother-in-law’s</b> food, and Rabbi Ḥiyya prohibited it <b>because she did not confer possession to her,</b> i.e., she merely prepared the <i>eiruv</i> but did not confer possession of the food, and an <i>eiruv</i> of this kind is not effective? <b>Or perhaps she established the <i>eiruv</i> for her with the</b> daughter-in-law’s <b>own</b> food, but the <i>eiruv</i> was invalid <b>because</b> it was prepared <b>without her knowledge?</b>

### Part 10
<b>One of the Sages, named Rabbi Ya’akov, said to them: It was</b> personally <b>explained to me by Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that the mother-in-law <b>established the <i>eiruv</i> for her with the mother-in-law’s</b> food, <b>and</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya prohibited it <b>because she did not confer possession</b> of the food <b>to her.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Ya’akov, son of the daughter of Ya’akov: When you go there,</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>take a roundabout</b> route, i.e., do not travel by the shortest path, <b>and go to the Ladder of Tyre and raise</b> this <b>dilemma before Rav Ya’akov bar Idi.</b>

### Part 12
Rabbi Ya’akov did so and <b>raised a dilemma before him:</b> With regard to that incident, did the mother-in-law <b>establish the <i>eiruv</i> for</b> her daughter-in-law <b>from the mother-in-law’s</b> food, <b>and</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya prohibited it <b>because she did not confer possession</b> of the food <b>to her? Or perhaps she established the <i>eiruv</i> for her with</b> the daughter-in-law’s <b>own</b> food, but the <i>eiruv</i> was invalidated <b>because</b> it was prepared <b>without her knowledge?</b>

### Part 13
Rav Ya’akov bar Idi <b>said to him:</b> The mother-in-law <b>established the <i>eiruv</i> for her with the mother-in-law’s</b> food, and Rabbi Ḥiyya prohibited it <b>because she did not confer possession</b> of the food <b>to her.</b> Like his master and uncle, Rabbi Ḥiyya, Rav also maintains that possession of the food must be conferred upon those who wish to be included in a joining of Shabbat boundaries.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Naḥman said: We hold based on tradition that</b> with regard to <b>all</b> of them, <b>joining of</b> Shabbat <b>boundaries, joining of courtyards, and merging of alleyways, it is necessary to confer possession.</b> After issuing this statement, <b>Rav Naḥman raised a dilemma</b> concerning an issue that was not sufficiently clear to him: With regard to <b>a joining of cooked foods</b> [<b><i>eiruv tavshilin</i>],</b> which must be prepared in order to permit cooking for Shabbat on a Festival that occurs on a Friday, <b>is it necessary to confer possession, or is it not necessary to confer possession?</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rav Yosef said: What is his dilemma?</b> Did <b>he not hear that which Rav Naḥman bar Rav Adda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>a joining of cooked foods, it is necessary to confer possession? Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: It is <b>obvious that he did not hear</b> that ruling, <b>as had he heard it, why would he have raised this dilemma?</b>

### Part 16
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Didn’t Shmuel say,</b> with regard to a <b>joining of</b> Shabbat <b>boundaries,</b> that <b>it is not necessary to confer possession, and</b> Rav Naḥman nonetheless <b>said</b> that <b>it is necessary to confer possession?</b> Perhaps here too Rav Naḥman did not accept Shmuel’s ruling.

### Part 17
Abaye replied: <b>How can you compare</b> the two cases? <b>Granted, there,</b> with regard to a merging of alleyways and a joining of Shabbat boundaries, <b>Rav and Shmuel disagree, and</b> Rav Naḥman <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance <b>with the stringency of</b> this <b>master and the stringency of</b> that <b>master,</b> i.e., his ruling is based on both opinions. <b>However, here,</b> with regard to a joining of cooked foods, <b>if it is so,</b> if <b>he</b> actually <b>heard</b> Shmuel’s ruling, <b>is there anyone who disputes</b> it? If one of his teachers issued an uncontested ruling, it is presumably an established <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 18
<b>A certain</b> gentile <b>superintendent [<i>turzina</i>] lived in Rabbi Zeira’s neighborhood.</b> The neighbors <b>said to him: Rent your domain to us</b> so that we may carry on Shabbat. However, <b>he would not rent</b> it <b>to them. They came before Rabbi Zeira and asked him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if we seek <b>to rent</b> the domain <b>from his wife</b> without her husband’s knowledge?

### Part 19
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to them: Reish Lakish said as follows in the name of a great man, and who is</b> this great man? It is <b>Rabbi Ḥanina.</b> He stated: <b>A man’s wife may establish an <i>eiruv</i> without his knowledge.</b> According to this principle, the superintendent’s wife could indeed rent out the domain without his knowledge.

### Part 20
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <b>A certain superintendent lived in the neighborhood of Rav Yehuda bar Oshaya.</b> The neighbors <b>said to him: Rent your domain to us</b> so that we may establish an <i>eiruv</i> and carry on Shabbat, but <b>he would not rent</b> it <b>to them. They came before Rav Yehuda bar Oshaya</b> and <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if we seek <b>to rent</b> it <b>from his wife? He did not have</b> a ready answer <b>at hand. They</b> subsequently <b>came before Rav Mattana,</b> and <b>he</b> too <b>did not have</b> an answer <b>at hand. They came before Rav Yehuda,</b> who <b>said to them</b> that <b>Shmuel said as follows: A man’s wife may establish an <i>eiruv</i> without his knowledge,</b> and the same applies to renting out his property.

### Part 21
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Women who joined</b> the courtyards <b>or merged the alleyways without the knowledge of their husbands, their <i>eiruv</i> is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>, and their merging</b> of alleyways <b>is not a</b> valid <b>merging.</b> How can Shmuel rule against an explicit <i>baraita</i>?

### Part 22
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.</b> In <b>this</b> case, where Shmuel said that a wife may establish an <i>eiruv</i> without her husband’s knowledge, he was referring to a situation where the husband <b>would prohibit</b> his neighbors from carrying if he did not join their <i>eiruv</i>, and the <i>halakha</i> is therefore lenient, as a wife may establish an <i>eiruv</i> on his behalf. However, in <b>that</b> case, the <i>baraita</i>, which states that his wife may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> without his knowledge, is referring to a situation where <b>he would not prohibit</b> his neighbors from carrying.

### Part 23
The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that this is the correct interpretation, <b>as if</b> you do not say <b>this,</b> there is <b>a contradiction between</b> this ruling <b>of Shmuel and</b> another ruling <b>of Shmuel. As Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>one of the residents of an alleyway who was accustomed to join in a merging of alleyways with the</b> other <b>residents of</b> the <b>alleyway, but</b> one Shabbat <b>he did not join in a merging of alleyways</b> with them, <b>the</b> other <b>residents of the alleyway</b> may <b>enter his house and take</b> his contribution to <b>their merging of alleyways from him</b> even <b>against his will.</b>

### Part 24
The Gemara infers: If he was <b>accustomed</b> to join in their merging of the alleyway, <b>yes,</b> they may enter his house to collect his contribution, but if he was <b>not accustomed</b> to do so, <b>no,</b> they may not do so. Clearly, it is not possible in all cases to compel a person to participate in a merging of alleyways against his will. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from it</b> that it is so.

### Part 25
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports him.</b> The residents of an alleyway may <b>compel</b> anyone who lives in the alleyway <b>to erect a side post and a</b> cross <b>beam for the alleyway.</b> This teaching indicates that with regard to these Shabbat enactments, a person’s wishes are not taken into account; rather, others may act on his behalf even against his will.
