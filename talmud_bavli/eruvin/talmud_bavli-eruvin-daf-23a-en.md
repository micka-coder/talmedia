### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava. And Rav Yosef</b> also <b>said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> Upright <b>boards</b> surrounding a <b>well were permitted only in</b> the case of <b>a well</b> containing potable, running <b>spring water.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara comments: <b>And it was necessary</b> to cite both of these statements, even though their content appears to be the same. <b>As had</b> he <b>taught us</b> only that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava</b> that upright boards may only be set arranged for a well, <b>I would have said</b> that with regard to water belonging to <b>the public,</b> upright boards are permitted not only in the case of spring water, but <b>even</b> in the case of water <b>collected</b> in a cistern.

### Part 3
<b>And that which was taught:</b> One may only arrange boards for <b>a public well,</b> that was <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva</b> that upright boards may be arranged even for a private well, but not to allow us to infer that boards may not be arranged for a public cistern filled with collected water. Therefore, Shmuel <b>teaches us</b> that <b>boards</b> surrounding a <b>well were permitted only</b> in the case of <b>a well of spring water.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And</b> in the opposite direction, <b>had</b> he <b>taught us</b> that upright boards may only be arranged for <b>a well</b> containing potable, running <b>spring water, I would have said</b> that <b>there is no difference</b> whether it is a <b>public</b> well <b>and there is no difference</b> whether it is a <b>private</b> well. Shmuel therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava,</b> who says that upright boards may be arranged only for a public well, but not for one that belongs to an individual.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava said:</b> With regard to <b>a garden or a <i>karpef</i>,</b> an enclosed courtyard used for storage, <b>that is</b> not more than <b>seventy cubits and a remainder,</b> a little more, as will be explained below, <b>by seventy cubits and a remainder, and is surrounded by a wall ten handbreadths high, one may carry inside it,</b> as it constitutes a proper private domain. This is <b>provided that it contains a watchman’s booth or a dwelling place, or it is near the town</b> in which its owner lives, so that he uses it and it is treated like a dwelling.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This is not necessary, for <b>even if it contains only a</b> water <b>cistern, an</b> elongated water <b>ditch, or a cave,</b> i.e., a covered pit containing water, <b>one may carry inside it,</b> as the water bestows upon it the status of a dwelling. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Even if it has none of these one may carry inside it, provided that it measures</b> not more than <b>seventy cubits and a remainder by seventy cubits and a remainder.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If its length is greater than its breadth, even by one cubit, one may not carry inside it,</b> even though its total area does not exceed an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>, because in an area that was enclosed not for the purpose of residence, carrying is only permitted if the area is perfectly square. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even if its length is double its breadth, one may carry inside it,</b> and there is no need to be particular about a square shape.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Elai said: I heard from Rabbi Eliezer</b> that one is permitted to carry in a garden or <i>karpef</i>, <b>even</b> if the garden <b>is</b> an area of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>,</b> i.e., thirty times larger than the area of a <i>beit se’a</i>.

### Part 9
Incidentally, he adds: <b>And I also heard from him</b> another <i>halakha</i>: If <b>one of the residents of a courtyard forgot and did not join in an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the other residents when they established an <i>eiruv</i>, and on Shabbat he ceded ownership of his part in the courtyard to the other residents, then it <b>is prohibited for him,</b> the one who forgot to establish an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>to bring in</b> objects <b>or take</b> them <b>out</b> from <b>his house</b> to the courtyard; <b>however, it is permitted to them,</b> the other residents, to bring objects from their houses to that person’s house via the courtyard, and vice versa. We do not say that the failure of one resident to join in the <i>eiruv</i> nullifies the validity of the <i>eiruv</i> for the entire courtyard.

### Part 10
<b>And I also heard from him</b> another <i>halakha</i>, <b>that one may fulfill his obligation</b> to eat bitter herbs <b>on Passover with <i>arkablin</i>,</b> a certain bitter herb. With regard to all three rulings, <b>I circulated among all</b> of Rabbi Eliezer’s <b>disciples, seeking a colleague</b> who had also heard these matters from him, <b>but I could not find</b> one.

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara first analyzes the wording of this mishna: <b>What was taught</b> previously, <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> in this mishna: <b>And furthermore</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava said, which implies a continuation of the previous mishna?

### Part 12
<b>If you say</b> that <b>because he</b> first <b>taught one stringency</b> concerning the upright boards surrounding a well, <b>and</b> then <b>he teaches another</b> stringency about an enclosure, and <b>for that reason</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches: And furthermore,</b> then there is a difficulty. <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yehuda</b> also <b>teach one stringency and</b> then <b>teach another</b> stringency, <b>and</b> yet the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>does not teach: And furthermore</b> Rabbi Yehuda said?

### Part 13
The Gemara answers that the cases are different: <b>There, the Rabbis interrupted</b> Rabbi Yehuda’s statements in order to disagree with him, and hence it is not possible to say: And furthermore Rabbi Yehuda said. <b>Here,</b> however, <b>the Rabbis did not interrupt him,</b> as the two statements of Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava immediately follow one another.

### Part 14
The Gemara raises a difficulty: Does this mean that <b>wherever the</b> disputing <b>Rabbis interrupt</b> their colleague, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: And furthermore? But</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> in a mishna <b>in</b> tractate <b><i>Sukka</i></b> (27a), <b>where the Rabbis interrupted his</b> statements, nonetheless the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: And furthermore.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: It is not the same; <b>there, they interrupted</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>with</b> a ruling with regard to <b>his</b> own <b>topic; here,</b> however, <b>they interrupted</b> Rabbi Yehuda with a ruling with regard to <b>an</b> altogether <b>different matter.</b> Consequently, his first statement had already been forgotten, and it is not the Mishna’s style to join together statements where the sequential link between them has already been severed.

### Part 16
We learned in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Akiva said: Even</b> if the courtyard <b>has none of these</b> elements that indicate dwelling stipulated by the other Rabbis, <b>one may carry inside it,</b> provided that it measures no more than seventy cubits and a remainder by seventy cubits and a remainder.
