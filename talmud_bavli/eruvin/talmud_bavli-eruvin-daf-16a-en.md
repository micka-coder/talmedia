or <b>with</b> saddle <b>cushions [<i>avitin</i>],</b> or <b>with wheat sheaves,</b> or <b>with boards,</b> or <b>with stalks [<i>kolaḥot</i>], one may carry within</b> the enclosed area, <b>provided that there is no camel-length</b> gap <b>between one camel and another, or a saddle-length</b> gap <b>between one saddle and another, or a cushion-length</b> gap <b>between one cushion and another.</b> Apparently, from this <i>baraita</i> it can be understood that if the breach is equal to the standing segment, it is not a valid enclosure.

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this conclusion. <b>Here, too,</b> it is referring to gaps through which the various objects can easily <b>be inserted and extracted,</b> so that the breached segment is in fact slightly greater than that of the standing segment.

### Part 3
The Gemara cites yet another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in the <i>Tosefta</i> in tractate <i>Kilayim</i>: <b>Ultimately, you say that there are three measures for partitions.</b> These partitions form a barrier that demarcates between vines and seeds. They are needed to render permitted the sowing of a field with diverse kinds of seeds. In the case of <b>any</b> partition consisting of boards that are each <b>less than three</b> handbreadths wide, <b>it is necessary that there will not be</b> a gap of <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>between this</b> board <b>and that, so that a goat would not</b> be able to <b>leap headlong</b> through it unimpeded. If the gap is wider than three handbreadths, i.e., wide enough that a goat can leap through it, the boards are not considered joined and it is not considered a partition.

### Part 4
In the case of <b>any</b> partition that consists of boards that are <b>three</b> handbreadths wide, <b>as well as</b> boards <b>from three to four</b> handbreadths wide, the gap between the boards may be greater than three handbreadths. Nonetheless, <b>it is necessary that there will not be</b> a gap equal to <b>the full width</b> of a board <b>between one</b> board <b>and the next, so that the breached</b> segment <b>will not equal the standing</b> segment. <b>And if the breached</b> segment <b>is greater than the standing</b> segment, <b>it is prohibited</b> to sow another species, <b>even</b> in the area <b>opposite the standing</b> segment, as the breached segment invalidates the entire partition.

### Part 5
With regard to <b>any</b> partition that consists of boards that are <b>four</b> handbreadths wide, <b>as well as</b> boards <b>from four</b> handbreadths <b>to ten cubits</b> wide, <b>it is necessary that there not be</b> a gap <b>the full</b> width of a board <b>between one</b> board <b>and the next, so that the breached</b> segment <b>will not equal the standing</b> segment. <b>And if the breached</b> segment <b>equals the standing</b> segment, then in the area <b>opposite the standing</b> segment, <b>it is permitted</b> to sow other species, as there is a partition there; however, in the area <b>facing the breached</b> segment <b>it is prohibited. And if the</b> sum of the <b>standing</b> segments <b>is greater than the</b> sum of <b>the breached</b> segments, sowing other species <b>is permitted, even</b> in the area <b>opposite the breached</b> part.

### Part 6
However, if, the partition was <b>breached more than ten</b> cubits, sowing diverse kinds <b>is prohibited,</b> as a breach of more than ten cubits invalidates the entire partition. <b>But if there were pronged stakes stuck</b> in the ground <b>there, and one made them a braid [<i>pe’a</i>]</b> of straw <b>above</b> them in the form of a doorway, <b>even if</b> the stakes were set <b>more than ten</b> cubits apart, sowing <b>is permitted.</b> The form of a doorway renders the partition valid, even if there is a breach wider than ten cubits.

### Part 7
The Gemara explains how the passage from the <i>Tosefta</i> of tractate <i>Kilayim</i> supports the opinion of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, contrary to that of Rav Pappa. <b>In any case, the first clause</b> of the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches</b> that if each of the boards that make up the partition is <b>from three to four</b> handbreadths wide, sowing other species is permitted, <b>provided that there is not</b> a gap <b>the full</b> width of a board <b>between one</b> board <b>and the next.</b> This is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion of <b>Rav Pappa,</b> who permits carrying when the breach equals the standing segment of the partition.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Pappa</b> could have <b>said to you: What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean by a gap <b>the full</b> width of a board? It means a gap through which the board could easily be <b>inserted and extracted,</b> which is a gap slightly wider than the board itself.

### Part 9
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it stands to reason, from</b> the fact that the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches</b> later: <b>If the breached</b> segment <b>is greater than the standing</b> segment, <b>it is prohibited</b> to sow another species, <b>even</b> in the area <b>opposite the standing</b> portion. By inference, <b>if</b> the breached segment <b>equals the standing</b> segment, sowing other species <b>is</b> in fact <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> proof for the opinion of Rav Pappa.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say that this</b> conclusion <b>is a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua.</b> The Gemara rejects this: Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, could have <b>said to you: And according to your reasoning, say the latter clause</b> of the <i>Tosefta</i> as follows: <b>If the sum of the standing</b> segment <b>is greater than the sum of the breached</b> segment, sowing other species <b>is permitted even</b> in the area <b>opposite the breached</b> segment. This clause indicates that if the breached segment <b>equals the standing</b> segment, sowing other species <b>is prohibited.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara points out that that analysis of the <i>baraita</i> leads to the conclusion that <b>the latter clause poses a difficulty for Rav Pappa’s</b> opinion; <b>the first clause poses a difficulty for</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>The latter clause poses no difficulty to Rav Pappa. Since the first clause taught</b> the expression: If <b>the</b> sum of <b>the breached</b> segment <b>is greater than the</b> sum of the <b>standing</b> segment, <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> the parallel expression: If <b>the</b> sum of the <b>standing</b> segment <b>is greater than</b> the sum of <b>the breached</b> segment, even though the latter formulation is imprecise, as the same <i>halakha</i> applies even if the two are equal.

### Part 13
Similarly, the Gemara explains that <b>the first clause does not pose a difficulty to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua. Since</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>sought to teach</b> the expression <b>in</b> the <b>latter clause:</b> If the sum of <b>the standing</b> segments <b>is greater than the</b> sum of the <b>breached</b> segments, in <b>the first clause taught</b> the parallel expression: If the sum of <b>the breached</b> segments <b>is greater than</b> the sum of <b>the standing</b> segments, even though this formulation is imprecise, as the same <i>halakha</i> applies even if the two are equal.

### Part 14
The Gemara continues: <b>Granted, according to Rav Pappa,</b> who permits carrying in the case where the breaches equal the standing segments, the <i>baraita</i> makes sense, as <b>for that</b> reason the <i>tanna</i> <b>did not combine</b> the case of boards less than three handbreadths wide with the case of boards three handbreadths wide <b>and teach them</b> in a single clause. According to Rav Pappa, there is a significant difference between the two situations. In a case where the boards are less than three handbreadths wide, the partition is invalid if there is a gap of three handbreadths between one bar and the next. However, if the boards are precisely three handbreadths wide, the partition is valid unless there is a gap of more than three handbreadths between them.

### Part 15
<b>However, according to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> who considers a partition invalid when its breached segments are equal to its standing segments, the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have combined</b> the case of boards less than three handbreadths wide with the case of boards exactly three handbreadths wide <b>and taught them</b> in the following single clause: <b>Any</b> partition made of boards <b>less than three</b> handbreadths wide <b>or</b> exactly <b>three</b> handbreadths wide, <b>it is necessary that there not be</b> a gap of <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>between one</b> board <b>and another.</b> According to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, if a partition with boards three handbreadths wide is to be valid, the gap must be less than three handbreadths.

### Part 16
The Gemara explains why the two cases were not combined according to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua. It is <b>because the disqualification in the first clause is not similar to the disqualification in the latter clause.</b> The reason for <b>the disqualification in the first clause</b> is because a valid partition must be constructed <b>so that a goat would not</b> be able <b>to jump</b> through the gap <b>in one</b> leap; the reason for <b>the disqualification in the latter clause,</b> where the boards are three handbreadths wide, is <b>so that the breached</b> segments <b>will equal the</b> combined <b>standing</b> segments. In practice, just as in the case of boards less than three handbreadths wide, the gap must be less than three handbreadths, so too, in the case of boards three handbreadths wide, the gap must also be less than three handbreadths. However, in terms of underlying reasoning, the case of boards three handbreadths wide must be categorized in the second grouping in the <i>Tosefta</i>, not the first. Therefore, no proof can be cited from here, neither in support of the opinion of Rav Pappa nor in support of the opinion of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua.

### Part 17
The Gemara briefly discusses the ruling cited in the <i>Tosefta</i> that a breach of <b>less than three</b> handbreadths does not invalidate a partition. In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is that ruling? It is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who <b>say:</b> In the case of a gap <b>less than three</b> handbreadths, <b>we say,</b> i.e., we apply, the principle of <b><i>lavud</i>,</b> and the partitions are considered joined; however, if the gap is <b>three</b> handbreadths, <b>we do not say <i>lavud</i>.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Say the latter clause</b> with regard to a partition of boards as follows: In the case of any partition whose boards are <b>three</b> handbreadths wide, <b>and</b> any partition whose boards are <b>from three to four</b> handbreadths wide,
