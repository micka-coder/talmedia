### Part 1
<b>provided he does not</b> thereby <b>go out beyond the</b> city’s Shabbat <b>limit,</b> as those watching the surveyor might mistakenly think the limit extends to that point.

### Part 2
<b>If,</b> due to the width of the canyon or hill, <b>he cannot span it, with regard to this</b> situation <b>Rabbi Dostai bar Yannai said in the name of Rabbi Meir: I heard that one may pierce hills.</b> In other words, one measures the distance as if there were a hole from one side of the hill to the other, so that in effect, he measures only the horizontal distance and ignores the differences in elevation.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that the Shabbat limit must be measured with a rope fifty cubits long, derived? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> They are derived from <b>that</b> which <b>the verse states: “The length of the courtyard shall be one hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty by fifty”</b> (Exodus 27:18). <b>The Torah states: Measure with a rope of fifty cubits,</b> i.e., the length and breadth of the courtyard must be measured “by fifty,” with a rope fifty cubits long.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> repetitive usage of the word fifty <b>is necessary</b> to teach us something else, namely, that the area of a courtyard is equivalent to a square the size of the Tabernacle’s courtyard. To this end, the Torah states: <b>Take</b> a square of <b>fifty</b> cubits by fifty cubits, <b>and surround</b> it with the remaining <b>fifty</b> cubits in order to form a square, each side of which is just over seventy cubits long.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let the verse state: Fifty, fifty,</b> which would have sufficed to teach us the size and shape of a courtyard. <b>What is</b> the significance of the phrase: <b>Fifty by fifty? Conclude from this</b> that the verse comes to teach <b>two</b> things, both the matter of the square courtyard and that the length of the rope used to measure the Shabbat limit should be fifty cubits long.

### Part 6
We learned in the mishna: One may measure a Shabbat limit only with a rope fifty cubits long, <b>not less and not more. It was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>No less, because</b> a shorter rope improperly <b>increases</b> the Shabbat limit, as the rope is likely to be stretched. <b>And no more, because</b> a longer rope <b>reduces</b> the limit, as the rope is likely to sag due to its weight.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Asi said: One may measure only with a rope of <i>afsakima</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>afsakima</i>? Rabbi Abba said:</b> It is the <b><i>nargila</i></b> plant. This name was also not widely known, and therefore the Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>nargila</i>? Rabbi Ya’akov said: A palm tree</b> that has only <b>one fibrous vine</b> wrapped around it. <b>Some say</b> a different version of the previous discussion, according to which the Gemara asked: <b>What is <i>afsakima</i>? Rabbi Abba said:</b> It is the <b><i>nargila</i></b> plant. <b>Rabbi Ya’akov</b> disagreed and <b>said:</b> It is <b>a palm tree</b> with <b>one fibrous vine.</b>

### Part 8
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya said: You have nothing better for measuring than iron chains,</b> as they do not stretch. <b>But what shall we do, as the Torah states:</b> “I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold a man <b>with a measuring rope in his hand”</b> (Zechariah 2:5), from which it is derived that measurements must be made with a rope.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it</b> also <b>written: “And in the man’s hand a measuring reed</b> of six cubits long, of one cubit and a handbreadth each” (Ezekiel 40:5), which indicates that reeds may also be used for measuring? The Gemara answers: <b>That is</b> used <b>for</b> measuring <b>gates,</b> which are too narrow to be measured with lengthy ropes.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Yosef taught</b> that <b>there are three</b> kinds of <b>rope,</b> each required by <i>halakha</i> for a different purpose: A rope <b>of <i>magag</i>,</b> a kind of bulrush reed; a rope <b>of <i>netzer</i>,</b> made from fibrous palm vines; <b>and</b> a rope <b>of flax.</b>

### Part 11
They are used for the following purposes: A rope <b>of <i>magag</i></b> is utilized <b>for</b> the burning of <b>the</b> red <b>heifer, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>They would bind</b> the heifer <b>with a rope of <i>magag</i> and place it on its woodpile,</b> where it would be burned after it was slaughtered. A rope <b>of <i>netzer</i></b> was required <b>for a <i>sota</i>,</b> a woman suspected of adultery, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: Before the <i>sota</i> is compelled to drink the bitter waters, her clothes are torn. <b>And after that</b> a priest <b>brings a <i>mitzri</i> rope,</b> i.e., a rope made of reeds [<i>netzarim</i>], <b>and binds it above her breasts,</b> so that her garments will not fall. A rope <b>of flax</b> is used <b>for measuring.</b>

### Part 12
It was stated in the mishna: If <b>he was measuring</b> the limit <b>and he reached</b> a canyon or a fence, he spans the area as if it were completely flat and then resumes his measurement. The Gemara comments: <b>From</b> the fact that <b>it taught</b> that <b>he resumes his measurement,</b> it may be derived <b>by inference that if he cannot span it</b> because it is too wide, <b>he goes to a place where</b> it is narrower so that <b>he can span it. And he spans it, and he</b> then <b>looks</b> for the spot at the same distance that is <b>aligned with his</b> original <b>measurement, and he resumes</b> his measurement from there.

### Part 13
The Gemara comments that <b>we have</b> indeed <b>learned this, as the Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who was measuring</b> the Shabbat limit <b>and the measurement reached a canyon, if he can span</b> the canyon <b>with a rope of fifty cubits,</b> i.e., if the canyon is less than fifty cubits wide, <b>he spans it. And if not,</b> i.e., if the valley is more than fifty cubits wide, <b>he goes to a place where</b> it is narrower so that <b>he can span it, and he spans it, and he</b> then <b>looks</b> for the spot at the same distance that aligns with his original measurement, <b>and he resumes his measurement</b> from there.

### Part 14
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If the canyon was curved</b> so that it surrounds the city on more than one side, and it cannot be spanned on the side where he wishes to measure the limit, <b>he pierces and ascends, pierces and descends,</b> thereby measuring the canyon’s width bit by bit. If <b>he reached a wall, we do not say that he should pierce the wall</b> so that it can be precisely measured; <b>rather, he estimates</b> its width <b>and</b> then <b>leaves</b> and continues on.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: If he reached a canyon or fence, <b>he spans it and</b> then <b>resumes his measurement?</b> Why is a precise measurement required there, whereas in the case of a wall, an estimate is sufficient? The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> in the mishna, we are dealing with a place whose <b>use is convenient,</b> i.e., where the slope is relatively gentle so that the area can be crossed. Therefore, the area must actually be measured. However, <b>here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, the wall’s <b>use is not convenient.</b> Since one cannot walk through the wall, an estimate of its width is sufficient.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: They taught</b> the method of piercing <b>only where a plumb line does not drop straight down,</b> i.e., where the canyon has a slope.
