### Part 1
If <b>a cistern</b> in a small alleyway <b>between two courtyards is separated</b> by <b>four</b> handbreadths <b>from the wall</b> of one courtyard <b>and</b> by <b>four</b> handbreadths <b>from the wall</b> of another courtyard, the resident of <b>this</b> courtyard <b>may extend a ledge of minimal size</b> from his window in the direction of the cistern, as a sign that he is not using the domain of the other, <b>and he may</b> subsequently proceed to <b>draw</b> water from the cistern through the window. <b>And the</b> resident of the <b>other</b> courtyard <b>may</b> likewise <b>extend a ledge of minimal size and draw</b> water from the cistern through his window. <b>And Rav Yehuda himself said:</b> An actual ledge is unnecessary, as it is enough <b>even</b> if one merely extends <b>a</b> simple <b>reed.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: This</b> ruling <b>of Rav Yehuda,</b> that some minimal sort of adjustment is required, <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of his teacher, <b>Shmuel. Since if</b> he holds in accordance with the opinion <b>of</b> his other teacher, <b>Rav,</b> this would present a difficulty, <b>as didn’t</b> Rav <b>say: One person does not render it prohibited for another person</b> to perform an action <b>by way of the air,</b> if the place he is using is four handbreadths away from him? Consequently, not even a reed is required.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it ascertained that this is the opinion <b>of Shmuel? If you say</b> we learn it <b>from that</b> teaching <b>which Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to a low <b>roof adjacent to a public domain, there must be a fixed ladder</b> from the courtyard to the roof in order <b>to permit</b> the use of the roof to the residents of the courtyard, it might be inferred from here that the people in the public domain render it prohibited to use the roof because they can use it through the air, by throwing. However, this proof is inconclusive. <b>Perhaps,</b> this <i>halakha</i> can be understood <b>in accordance with the opinion of Rav Pappa:</b> Here we are dealing with a roof upon which people in the public domain place their hats and shawls when in need of rest. That would mean that this <i>halakha</i> does not involve use of the airspace at all.

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> Shmuel’s opinion is learned <b>from this</b> statement: <b>This</b> one, the resident of one courtyard, <b>may extend a ledge of minimal size and draw</b> water from the cistern through his window; <b>and the</b> resident of the <b>other</b> courtyard <b>may</b> also <b>extend a ledge of minimal size and draw</b> water through his window. <b>The reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i> <b>is that one extended</b> a ledge, <b>but</b> if <b>he did not extend</b> a ledge, <b>we say</b> that <b>one person renders it prohibited for another person by way of the air.</b> One resident would be prohibited to draw water from the cistern due to the other resident, who has equal access to the water in the cistern by way of the air.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is the opinion <b>of Rav</b> learned, that one person does not render it prohibited for another by way of the air? <b>If you say</b> it is derived <b>from that</b> which was taught in a mishna: If <b>two balconies</b> extend over a body of water, <b>one above the other,</b> and the residents <b>erected a partition for the upper</b> balcony <b>but they did not erect a partition for the lower one,</b> residents of <b>both</b> balconies <b>are prohibited</b> to draw water, <b>unless they established an <i>eiruv</i></b> together.

### Part 6
The Gemara continues. <b>And Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: They taught</b> that the residents of one balcony render it prohibited for the residents of the other balcony to draw water <b>only when</b> one balcony <b>is near</b> the other, i.e., horizontally within four handbreadths. <b>But</b> if each balcony is <b>four</b> handbreadths <b>removed</b> from the other, so that each can use the other only by means of the air, <b>the upper</b> balcony <b>is permitted</b> to draw water, <b>while the lower one is prohibited</b> to do so. This teaching indicates that one person does not render it prohibited for use by another by way of the air.

### Part 7
However, this proof is inconclusive, as <b>perhaps it is different here, since for the</b> residents of <b>this</b> lower balcony, their use of the area is relatively inconvenient, as they can use it only <b>by</b> way of <b>hoisting and lowering.</b> The residents of the lower balcony must hoist the bucket from the lower balcony to the upper one before lowering it from there to draw water; <b>whereas for</b> the residents of <b>the other one,</b> i.e., the upper balcony, use of the water is convenient, as they can utilize it <b>by</b> way of <b>lowering alone.</b> Consequently, this case <b>is similar to</b> that of an area that can be used by the residents of <b>one</b> courtyard only <b>by throwing and</b> by the residents of <b>another</b> courtyard <b>as an entrance.</b> Since it is easier for the upper balcony to draw water, the lower balcony does not render it prohibited for the upper balcony in this particular case.

### Part 8
<b>Rather,</b> we can learn that this is the opinion of Rav <b>from that</b> teaching, <b>which Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If there are <b>two houses with three ruins between them,</b> the resident of <b>this</b> house <b>may use</b> the ruin <b>adjacent to him by means of throwing</b> into the ruin through his windows that open out to that ruin, <b>and</b> the resident of <b>the other</b> house <b>may use</b> the ruin <b>adjacent to him by means of throwing</b> through his windows,
