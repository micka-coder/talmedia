### Part 1
<b>And the other Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>maintains:</b> He <b>intends</b> to bring <b>a large offering</b> of eighty loaves, and therefore none of the loaves are consecrated.

### Part 2
<b>Abaye said: They only taught</b> Rav’s ruling that one cannot establish residence beneath a tree without precisely defining a particular location, <b>with regard to a tree beneath which there are</b> at least <b>twelve cubits. However, with regard to a tree</b> beneath <b>which there are not twelve cubits,</b> he can establish residence there, <b>as</b> at least <b>part of his residence is conspicuous.</b> In that case, there is a partial overlap between the middle four cubits beneath the tree and the four cubits nearest him and the four cubits farthest from him, and consequently each necessarily contains at least part of his residence.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, strongly objects to this: From where</b> is it ascertained <b>that he designates</b> his residence <b>in the four middle</b> cubits, so that there is a partial overlap with both the nearest and the farthest cubits; <b>perhaps he designates</b> it in <b>the four</b> cubits <b>on this side or</b> in <b>the four</b> cubits <b>on the other side?</b> Since he does not know which location he designated as his residence, he did not establish residence anywhere beneath the tree.

### Part 4
<b>Rather, Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> Abaye’s statement must be emended. <b>They taught</b> this <b>only with regard to a tree that</b> has at least <b>eight cubits beneath it. However, with regard to a tree that</b> has only <b>seven cubits beneath it,</b> even if one did not establish a particular location, he acquires residence, <b>as</b> at least <b>part of his residence is conspicuous,</b> as any four cubits must include at least one cubit of his residence.

### Part 5
With regard to the dispute between Rav and Shmuel, the Gemara notes that one <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav</b> and another <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara elaborates. A <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav:</b> With regard to <b>one who was coming along the way</b> on Shabbat eve, <b>and it grew dark</b> while <b>he</b> was traveling, <b>and he was familiar</b> with <b>a tree or a fence</b> within two thousand cubits of his current location, <b>and he said: My residence is beneath</b> that tree, <b>he has not said anything</b> of legal consequence. <b>However, if he said: My residence is in such-and-such place, he walks until he reaches that place.</b> Once <b>he reached that place</b> that he established as his residence, <b>he walks</b> through <b>all of it and</b> another <b>two thousand cubits beyond it.</b>

### Part 7
<b>In what</b> case <b>are these matters,</b> that he establishes four cubits as his residence, and another two thousand cubits in each direction, <b>stated?</b> In a case where he selected <b>a</b> well-<b>defined,</b> clearly demarcated <b>place,</b> i.e., a case <b>where he established</b> residence <b>on a mound ten handbreadths high, and its</b> area ranges <b>from</b> a minimum of <b>four cubits to</b> a maximum of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And, likewise,</b> that is the <i>halakha</i> when he establishes residence on <b>a plain ten</b> handbreadths <b>deeper</b> than the surrounding area, <b>and its</b> area ranges <b>from</b> a minimum of <b>four cubits to</b> a maximum of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>. However,</b> if he selected <b>a place that is not defined,</b> e.g., in the middle of a plain, he does not establish residence, and accordingly <b>he has only four cubits</b> in which to move.

### Part 9
<b>If two</b> people <b>were</b> walking together, <b>one</b> of whom is <b>familiar</b> with a particular location in the distance, <b>and one</b> of whom is <b>not familiar</b> with it, <b>the one who</b> is <b>not familiar</b> with it <b>entrusts</b> his right to designate <b>his</b> residence <b>to the one</b> who is <b>familiar</b> with it, <b>and the one who</b> is <b>familiar</b> with it <b>says: My residence is in such-and-such place.</b>

### Part 10
<b>In what</b> case <b>are these matters,</b> that he acquires four cubits as his residence and another two thousand cubits in each direction, <b>stated?</b> In a case <b>where he defined</b> the <b>four cubits that he</b> seeks to <b>establish</b> as his residence. <b>However,</b> if <b>he did not define</b> the <b>four cubits that he</b> seeks to <b>establish</b> as his residence, <b>he may not move from his</b> current <b>place,</b> as neither did he seek to establish residence there, nor did he acquire it in the location he sought to establish residence. This <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rav that one who fails to designate the four cubits he seeks to establish as residence has no residence at all.

### Part 11
Gemara poses a question: <b>Let us say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is a <b>conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel?</b> The Gemara answers: There is no difficulty, as <b>Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with a</b> special <b>case, where from the place he is standing to the trunk</b> of the tree <b>there is</b> a distance of <b>two thousand and four cubits, so that if you were to establish</b> residence <b>on the other side of the tree, it would be situated outside</b> his Shabbat limit.

### Part 12
Consequently, <b>if he designated</b> his <b>four cubits</b> on the near side of the tree <b>he may go</b> there; <b>and if not, he may not go</b> from the place he is standing. In other words, since he did not establish residence in a particular location, the concern is that he sought to establish it beyond his two thousand cubit limit.

### Part 13
A <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel. If one erred and established an <i>eiruv</i> in two directions</b> at once, for example, if in his ignorance <b>he imagined that</b> it is permitted to <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i> in two directions,</b> that he may extend the distance that he may walk on Shabbat in two opposite directions, <b>or if he said to his servants: Go out and establish an <i>eiruv</i> for me,</b> without specifying the direction, and <b>one established an <i>eiruv</i> for him to the north, and one established an <i>eiruv</i> for him to the south, he may walk to the north as</b> far as he is permitted go based on <b>his <i>eiruv</i> to the south,</b> and he may walk <b>to the south as</b> far as he is permitted go based on <b>his <i>eiruv</i> to the north.</b> In other words, the assumption is that he established residence in both directions based on the <i>eiruv</i> in each direction, and he must therefore take both into consideration before moving.

### Part 14
<b>And</b> consequently, <b>if</b> each <i>eiruv</i> was placed two thousand cubits in opposite directions <b>placing him in the middle of the limit, he may not move from his</b> current <b>location,</b> as it is prohibited to venture beyond either limit. Apparently, even if one did not establish residence in a particular location, as in this case he has acquired residence in both places, nonetheless, the <i>halakha</i> is that residence has been established in his current location, in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel.

### Part 15
The Gemara poses a question: <b>Let us say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is a <b>conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav?</b> The Gemara answers: This <i>baraita</i> indeed differs with Rav’s ruling. Nevertheless, his opinion is not disqualified, as <b>Rav himself</b> had <b><i>tanna</i></b> status and therefore, unlike later <i>amora’im</i>, could <b>disagree </b>with opinions of <i>tanna’im</i>.

### Part 16
We learned in the mishna that if, however, <b>he said: My residence is at</b> the <b>trunk</b> of the tree, he established residence there, and he <b>may walk from the place that he is standing to the trunk</b> of the tree, up to <b>two thousand cubits, and from the trunk</b> of the tree <b>to his house</b> another <b>two thousand cubits. Ultimately, he may walk after nightfall</b> a total distance of <b>four thousand cubits.</b>
