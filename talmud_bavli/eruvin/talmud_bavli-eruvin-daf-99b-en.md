### Part 1
<b>And the same</b> applies <b>in a winepress.</b> This winepress cannot be a private domain, as the first clause of the mishna already dealt with a private domain. The winepress must therefore be a <i>karmelit</i>, which proves that it is prohibited to drink from a <i>karmelit</i> while standing in a public domain.

### Part 2
<b>And Rava said:</b> This proof is not conclusive, as the words: The same applies in a winepress, do not refer to Shabbat but <b>to the matter of</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>tithes,</b> as explained below. <b>And similarly, Rav Sheshet said</b> that the statement that <b>the same</b> applies <b>in a winepress</b> refers <b>to the matter of tithes.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara clarifies this statement. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One</b> may <b>drink</b> grape juice directly <b>on the winepress</b> <i>ab initio</i> without tithing, <b>whether</b> the juice was diluted <b>with hot</b> water, even though he will then be unable to return the leftover wine to the press, as it would ruin all the wine in the press, <b>or whether</b> the juice was diluted <b>with cold</b> water, in which case he could return the leftover wine without ruining the rest, <b>and he is exempt.</b> Drinking that way is considered incidental drinking, and anything that is not a fixed meal is exempt from tithing. That is the <b>statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> This is the <b>statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Eliezer bar Tzadok deems</b> one <b>obligated</b> to tithe in both cases.

### Part 4
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> There is a distinction between these two cases. When the juice is diluted <b>with hot</b> water, since one cannot return what is left of the juice to the press, <b>he is obligated</b> to tithe it, as this drinking is like fixed drinking for which one is obligated to tithe. However, when the juice is diluted <b>with cold</b> water, <b>he is exempt</b> from tithing it, <b>because he</b> can <b>return the leftover</b> juice to the press. Therefore, it is considered incidental drinking, which is exempt from tithing. The teaching of the mishna: The same applies to a winepress, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, as it teaches that that the leniency to drink without separating tithes applies only if the drinker’s head and most of his body are in the winepress.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person</b> standing in a public domain on Shabbat may <b>catch</b> water in a vessel <b>from a gutter</b> running along the side of a roof, if it is <b>less than ten handbreadths</b> off the ground, which is part of the public domain. <b>And from a pipe</b> that protrudes from the roof, <b>one</b> may <b>drink in any manner,</b> i.e., not only by catching the water in a vessel, but even by pressing his mouth directly against the spout.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A careful reading of the mishna indicates that to <b>catch, yes,</b> one may catch the water from a distance, <b>but</b> to <b>press</b> his hand or mouth to the gutter, <b>no,</b> that is prohibited. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this distinction? <b>Rav Naḥman said: Here, we are dealing with a gutter within three</b> handbreadths <b>of the roof,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the principle that <b>anything within three</b> handbreadths <b>of a roof is considered like the roof</b> itself, based on the principle of <i>lavud</i>, according to which two solid surfaces are considered joined if there is a gap of less than three handbreadths between them. Since the roof of the house is a private domain, one would be carrying from a private domain to a public domain, which is prohibited.

### Part 7
<b>That</b> ruling, that there is a distinction between catching water falling from a gutter and pressing one’s hand or mouth to it, <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person</b> may <b>stand in a private domain and raise his hand above ten handbreadths,</b> until it is <b>within three</b> handbreadths <b>of the roof, and catch</b> any water falling from his neighbor’s roof in a vessel, <b>provided that he does not press</b> his hand or mouth to the roof.

### Part 8
<b>It was</b> likewise <b>taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person</b> may <b>not stand in a private domain and raise his hand above ten handbreadths, to within three</b> handbreadths <b>of the roof, and press</b> his hand to the gutter, <b>but he</b> may <b>catch</b> water falling from the gutter <b>and drink.</b>

### Part 9
It was stated in the mishna: <b>But from a pipe one</b> may <b>drink in any manner,</b> as it protrudes more than three handbreadths from the roof. A Sage <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>If the pipe</b> itself <b>is four by four</b> handbreadths wide, <b>it is prohibited</b> to stand in the public domain and press one’s hand or mouth to the water, <b>because he is like</b> one who <b>carries from one domain to</b> another <b>domain,</b> as the pipe is considered a domain in its own right.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a cistern in a public domain, with an embankment ten handbreadths high,</b> i.e., the embankment constitutes a private domain by itself, if there is <b>a window above</b> the cistern, i.e., the window of an adjacent house is situated above the cistern, <b>one</b> may <b>draw</b> water <b>from</b> the cistern <b>on Shabbat</b> through the window, as it is permitted to carry from one private domain to another.

### Part 11
Similarly, with regard to <b>a garbage dump in a public domain</b> that is <b>ten handbreadths high,</b> which means it has the status of a private domain, if there is <b>a window above</b> the pile of refuse that abuts the garbage dump, <b>one</b> may <b>throw water</b> from the window <b>onto</b> the dump <b>on Shabbat,</b> as it is permitted to carry from one private domain to another.

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>With what are we dealing</b> here? <b>If you say</b> we are dealing <b>with</b> a cistern that is <b>adjacent</b> to the wall of the house, i.e. the cistern and wall are separated by less than four handbreadths, <b>why do I</b> need the cistern’s <b>embankment</b> to be <b>ten</b> handbreadths high? Presumably the cistern is ten handbreadths deep, which makes it a private domain, and as it is too close to the house for the public domain to pass between them, one should be permitted to draw water from the cistern through the window, regardless of the height of the embankment.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Huna said: With what we are dealing here?</b> With a case where the cistern or garbage dump is <b>four</b> handbreadths <b>removed from the wall</b> of the house, i.e., a public domain separates the house from the cistern or heap. It is prohibited to carry from one private domain to another by way of a public domain. However, if the cistern’s embankment is ten handbreadths high, the one drawing the water transfers it by way of an area that is more than ten handbreadths above the public domain, which is an exempt domain.

### Part 14
<b>And the reason</b> that drawing the water is permitted is <b>that there is an embankment of ten</b> handbreadths; but <b>if there is no embankment of ten</b> handbreadths, it is prohibited, as this would involve <b>moving</b> objects <b>from one private domain to another by way of the public domain.</b>

### Part 15
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The above explanation is unnecessary. <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that we are dealing <b>with</b> a cistern that is <b>adjacent</b> to the wall of the house, the mishna comes to <b>teach us that a cistern and its embankment combine to</b> complete the <b>ten</b> handbreadths required for a private domain, and it is not necessary that the embankment itself reach a height of ten handbreadths.

### Part 16
The mishna states: With regard to <b>a garbage dump in a public domain</b> that is ten handbreadths high, if there is a window above the heap, one may throw water from the window onto the heap on Shabbat. The Gemara asks: <b>Aren’t we concerned that the</b> entire <b>garbage dump</b> or part of it <b>might be removed,</b> turning the area into a public domain, and people will continue to throw water onto it on Shabbat?

### Part 17
<b>But didn’t Ravin bar Rav Adda</b> say that <b>Rav Yitzḥak said: An incident</b> occurred <b>involving a certain alleyway, one of whose sides terminated in the sea,</b> which closed it off on one side, <b>and the other side</b> of which <b>terminated in a garbage dump. And the incident came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi for his ruling as to whether the alleyway has the status of an alleyway closed on both sides, <b>and he did not say</b> anything <b>about it, either prohibition or permission.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara clarifies: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>did not say about it</b> that carrying in the alleyway is <b>permitted, as we are concerned lest the garbage dump be removed</b> from its present spot, leaving one side of the alleyway open, <b>and</b> we are likewise concerned that perhaps <b>the sea will throw up sediment</b> and recede. These sedimentary deposits will intervene between the end of the alleyway and the sea, thereby depriving the alleyway of one its partitions.

### Part 19
Similarly, <b>he did not say about it</b> that carrying in the alleyway was <b>prohibited, as</b> its <b>partitions,</b> the sea and the garbage dump, indeed <b>exist,</b> and it was certainly permitted at that time to carry in the alleyway. Apparently, there is indeed a concern that a garbage dump might be removed; why, then, does the same concern not apply to the case in the mishna?

### Part 20
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.</b> In <b>this</b> case, with regard to the alleyway between the garbage dump and the sea, we are concerned, as we are dealing <b>with a private</b> garbage dump, whose owner might change his mind and remove it; whereas in <b>that</b> case, i.e., the case in the mishna, it is referring <b>to a public</b> heap, which will certainly remain fixed in place.

### Part 21
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a tree that was hanging over the ground,</b> i.e., its branches hung down on all sides like a tent so that it threw a shadow on the ground, <b>if</b> the tips of <b>its branches are no higher than three handbreadths from the ground, one</b> may <b>carry under it.</b> This applies even if the tree is planted in a public domain, as the branches form partitions which turn the enclosed area into a private domain.

### Part 22
If <b>its roots</b> were <b>three handbreadths higher than the ground, one</b> may <b>not sit on them,</b> as it is prohibited to use a tree on Shabbat. Any part of a tree that is three handbreadths above the ground has the status of a tree with regard to this prohibition.

### Part 23
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: One</b> may <b>not move</b> objects in the area <b>under</b> the tree if it is <b>more than two <i>beit se’a</i>. What is the reason</b> for this prohibition?
