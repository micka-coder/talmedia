### Part 1
<b>Why</b> must one actually bring the <i>eiruv</i> to the place where he wishes to establish his residence? <b>Let us say: Since if he wished to bring</b> the <i>eiruv</i> there <b>he could bring it, even though he did not bring it, it is considered as though he did bring it</b> there. This follows the same reasoning proposed by Rav Yirmeya in the case of the basket: Since one can tilt it. The fact that this reasoning is not employed here indicates that the potential to do something is insufficient; rather, the deed must actually be done.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The fact that one must bring his <i>eiruv</i> the day before to the spot that he wishes to establish as his place of residence, and the potential to bring it there does not suffice, is <b>a decree due to a Festival that occurs after Shabbat.</b> In that case, the <i>eiruv</i> is valid for the Festival only if it was brought there before Shabbat, for it cannot be carried there on Shabbat. Since one cannot actually bring the <i>eiruv</i> there, it cannot be said: It is considered as though he did bring it there because had he wished to bring the <i>eiruv</i> he could have. Consequently, the Sages decreed that in all cases, the <i>eiruv</i> is only valid if it was actually brought to the designated spot, lest one come to think that even on a Festival that occurs after Shabbat it need not be brought there.

### Part 3
Rav bar Shabba <b>raised</b> another <b>objection</b> from a different <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who <b>intended to establish his Shabbat residence in the public domain and placed his <i>eiruv</i> in a wall</b> that is more than four cubits away from that location; if he placed the <i>eiruv</i> <b>below</b> a height of <b>ten handbreadths</b> above the ground, <b>his <i>eiruv</i> is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>;</b> but if he placed it <b>above ten handbreadths, his <i>eiruv</i> is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i></b> because he is in a public domain while his <i>eiruv</i> is in a private domain. If <b>one intended to establish his Shabbat residence on top of a dovecote or on top of</b> a large <b>cupboard,</b> if he placed the <i>eiruv</i> in the dovecote or cupboard <b>above ten handbreadths</b> from the ground, <b>his <i>eiruv</i> is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i></b> because both he and his <i>eiruv</i> are in a private domain; but if he placed it <b>below ten handbreadths,</b> the area in which he placed his <i>eiruv</i> is considered a <i>karmelit</i>, and <b>his <i>eiruv</i> is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i></b> because he cannot transport his <i>eiruv</i> from there to his own domain on Shabbat.

### Part 4
<b>Why</b> should this be so? <b>Here too, let us say</b> that his <i>eiruv</i> should be valid even if it was placed below ten handbreadths, <b>since one can tilt</b> the cupboard <b>and bring it to within ten</b> handbreadths from the ground, in which case he and his <i>eiruv</i> would be in the same domain. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: Here, we are dealing with a cupboard that is nailed</b> to the wall so that it cannot be tilted.

### Part 5
<b>Rava said: Even if you say</b> that it is referring to <b>a cupboard that is not nailed</b> to the wall, <b>here, we are dealing with</b> a very <b>tall cupboard,</b> such <b>that were one to tilt it a little</b> in order to bring the top of the cupboard within ten handbreadths from the ground, the top of the cupboard <b>would project beyond</b> the <b>four cubits</b> that constitute one’s Shabbat residence.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What,</b> exactly, <b>are the circumstances? If</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the cupboard <b>has a window, and</b> one has <b>a rope</b> at hand, <b>let him bring it by means of the window and rope.</b> In other words, let him lower the rope through the cupboard’s window and bring the <i>eiruv</i> with it, and he will not have to move the entire cupboard. The Gemara answers: Here we are dealing with a case <b>where it does not have a window, and</b> he does not have <b>a rope</b> at hand.

### Part 7
We learned in the mishna: <b>If one placed</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>in a pit, even</b> if <b>it is a hundred cubits deep,</b> his <i>eiruv</i> is a valid <i>eiruv</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>This pit, where is it situated? If you say that it is situated in the private domain,</b>
