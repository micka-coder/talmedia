### Part 1
<b>Make way</b> even more <b>for one</b> who possesses <b>two hundred <i>maneh</i>. Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said before him: My teacher,</b> Bonyas, <b>father of this</b> one, <b>has a thousand ships out at sea and, corresponding to them, a thousand towns on land.</b> He should be granted pride of place due to his exorbitant wealth. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: When you reach</b> his <b>father, tell him: Do not send him to me in these garments.</b> Dress him in accordance with his wealth and status, so that he will be honored accordingly.

### Part 2
In explanation of this story, the Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi would <b>honor the wealthy,</b> and <b>Rabbi Akiva would</b> likewise <b>honor the wealthy, in accordance with Rava bar Mari’s interpretation</b> of the verse: <b>“May he be enthroned before God forever; appoint mercy and truth, that they may preserve him”</b> (Psalms 61:8). <b>When may he be enthroned before God forever? When he appoints</b> [<b><i>man</i></b>] <b>mercy and truth that they may preserve him.</b> Rava bar Mari explains the word <i>man</i> as referring to portions of food and interprets the verse as follows: If one provides food to others, he deserves to be enthroned before God, to be shown honor and respect. Consequently, it is proper to honor the wealthy who bestow such kindnesses.

### Part 3
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said:</b> What is considered a right of usage? <b>For example,</b> if the homeowner stores <b>the pin of a plough</b> in his tenant’s quarters. The tenant is prohibited to remove this pin from his residence on Shabbat due to its being set aside from use [<i>muktze</i>], and the homeowner therefore enjoys a fixed right of usage there.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> A Sage <b>of the school of Shmuel taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: If the homeowner stores <b>an object that can be moved on Shabbat</b> with his tenant, the tenant’s residence <b>renders</b> the other residence <b>prohibited</b> if he neglected to join the <i>eiruv</i>. This is not considered a right of usage. If the <b>object</b> being stored is one <b>that cannot be moved on Shabbat,</b> the tenant’s residence <b>does not render it prohibited for</b> them to use the courtyard.

### Part 5
The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if the tenant <b>has untithed produce</b> that may not be moved on Shabbat; or if <b>he has lumps</b> of glass or iron; <b>or anything</b> else <b>that may not be moved on Shabbat</b> that the homeowner deposited with him, the tenant <b>does not render it prohibited for</b> the other residents to use the courtyard.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who leaves his house,</b> which is located in a shared courtyard, <b>and goes to spend Shabbat in a different town, whether</b> he is <b>a gentile or a Jew, he renders it prohibited</b> for the other residents to use the courtyard as though he were still at home; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: He does not render it prohibited for</b> them, as he left behind him an empty residence.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: A gentile renders it prohibited</b> but <b>a Jew does not render it prohibited,</b> as <b>it is not the manner of a Jew to come</b> home <b>on Shabbat.</b> A Jew will not return home, therefore his empty residence does not render it prohibited. By contrast, a gentile might return over the course of Shabbat. Therefore, he is not considered to have fully uprooted himself from his house, and he renders it prohibited.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even</b> if the Jew <b>left his house and went to spend Shabbat with his daughter</b> who lived <b>in the same town, he does not render it prohibited.</b> Although he can return home at any time, it is assumed <b>that he has already removed from his mind</b> any thought of going back there and has established his Shabbat residence away from his home.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> if one went to <b>his daughter’s</b> house; <b>but</b> if he went to <b>his son’s</b> house, <b>no,</b> this is not the <i>halakha</i>. One cannot be sure that he will be able to stay at his son’s house, for his daughter-in-law might object to his presence and force him to return home. <b>As people say: If a dog barks at you, enter; if a female dog barks at you, leave.</b> In other words, the objections of a female, such as one’s daughter-in-law, who will certainly not be opposed by her husband, are more powerful than those of a male, such as one’s son-in-law.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a cistern that is</b> located <b>between two courtyards,</b> situated partly in each courtyard, <b>one may not draw</b> water <b>from it on Shabbat,</b> lest the residents of one courtyard draw water from the domain of the other courtyard, <b>unless a partition ten handbreadths high was erected for it</b> as a separation between the domains. This partition is effective <b>whether</b> it is <b>below,</b> in the water, <b>or whether it is within the</b> airspace of the cistern below the <b>rim,</b> above the surface of the water.

### Part 11
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said:</b> This is the subject of an early dispute of <i>tanna’im</i>, as <b>Beit Shammai said</b> that the partition, which permits drawing water, must be placed <b>below; and Beit Hillel said</b> it should be positioned <b>above. Rabbi Yehuda said: A partition is no better than the wall between them.</b> A wall dividing the two courtyards passes over the cistern, therefore it is not necessary to erect an additional partition in the cistern’s airspace.

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna said:</b> When Beit Shammai said <b>below,</b> they meant <b>actually below,</b> near the water; the partition need not touch the water itself. When Beit Hillel said <b>above,</b> they meant <b>actually above,</b> higher than the water and near the rim of the cistern. <b>And both of these</b> are within the airspace of the <b>cistern. And Rav Yehuda said: Below</b> means <b>below the water,</b> so that part of the partition is inside the water; whereas <b>above</b> means <b>above the water,</b> in such a manner that the partition does not come into contact with the water.

### Part 13
<b>Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye:</b> With regard to <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda said: Below</b> means <b>below the water, what is different</b> about a case where the partition is <b>actually below,</b> in the airspace cistern near the water, that led Rav Yehuda to say that one may <b>not</b> draw water in that case? It is <b>because</b> he was concerned lest <b>the water</b> of the two courtyards <b>become intermingled</b> beneath the partition. In a case where the partition is located <b>below the water,</b> near the bottom of the cistern, <b>as well, won’t the water</b> of the two courtyards <b>become intermingled</b> above it?

### Part 14
Abaye <b>said to him: Didn’t you hear that which Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, and some arrived at</b> this statement <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya: The tops of the reeds</b> of the partition <b>must be visible a handbreadth above</b> the surface of <b>the water?</b> This will ensure that there is a full partition between the two sides of the cistern.

### Part 15
<b>And</b> Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan <b>further</b> asked: With regard to <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda said: Above</b> means <b>above the water,</b> we can inquire: <b>What is different</b> about a case where the partition is <b>actually above,</b> i.e., near the rim of the cistern that led Rav Yehuda to say that one may <b>not</b> draw water in that case? It is <b>because</b> he was concerned lest <b>the water</b> of the two courtyards <b>become intermingled</b> beneath the partition. However, even if the partition is <b>above the water</b> below the rim of the cistern, <b>the water</b> of the two courtyards will <b>also become intermingled</b> beneath it. Abaye <b>said to him: Haven’t you heard that which Ya’akov from Karḥina taught: The ends of the reeds</b> of a partition <b>must be immersed</b> at least <b>a handbreadth</b> into the <b>water,</b> so that they divide the water in the cistern?

### Part 16
<b>But</b> the Gemara raises a further question. <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> If there is a cross <b>beam of four</b> handbreadths, it <b>permits</b> one to carry underneath it <b>in a ruin.</b> If a crossbeam four handbreadths wide is laid across the walls of a ruin, its edges are viewed as though they descended to the ground on each side, thereby forming partitions that permit one to carry under the cross beam. <b>And Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b>
