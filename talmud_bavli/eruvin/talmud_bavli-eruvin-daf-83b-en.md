### Part 1
What is the quantity of dough from which <i>ḥalla</i> must be separated? <b>The amount of “your dough.” And how much is “your dough”?</b> This amount is left unspecified by the verse. The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the amount of the dough of the wilderness.</b> The Gemara again asks: <b>And how much is the dough of the wilderness?</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara responds: The Torah states that the manna, the dough of the wilderness, was “an <i>omer</i> a head” (Exodus 16:16). A later verse elaborates on that measure, <b>as it is written: “And an <i>omer</i> is the tenth part of an <i>eifa</i>”</b> (Exodus 16:36). An <i>eifa</i> is three <i>se’a</i>, which are eighteen <i>kav</i> or seventy-two <i>log</i>. An <i>omer</i> is one-tenth of this measure. <b>From here,</b> this calculation, Sages <b>said</b> that dough prepared from <b>seven quarters</b> of a <i>kav</i> of <b>flour and more is obligated in <i>ḥalla</i>. This is equal to six</b> quarter-<i>kav</i> of the <b>Jerusalem</b> measure, <b>which is five</b> quarter-<i>kav</i> of the <b>Tzippori</b> measure.

### Part 3
<b>From here</b> the Sages also <b>said: One who eats roughly this amount</b> each day, <b>is healthy,</b> as he is able to eat a proper meal; <b>and</b> he is also <b>blessed,</b> as he is not a glutton who requires more. One who eats <b>more than this</b> is <b>a glutton,</b> while one who eats <b>less than this has damaged bowels</b> and must see to his health.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If both <b>the residents of</b> houses that open directly into <b>a courtyard and the residents of</b> apartments that open onto <b>a balcony</b> from which stairs lead down to that courtyard <b>forgot and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> between them, <b>anything</b> in the courtyard <b>that is ten handbreadths high,</b> e.g., a mound or a post, is part <b>of the balcony.</b> The residents of the apartments open to the balcony may transfer objects to and from their apartments onto the mound or post. Any post or mound that is <b>lower than this</b> height is part <b>of the courtyard.</b>

### Part 5
A similar <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>an embankment</b> that surrounds <b>a cistern or a rock:</b> If the embankments that surround a cistern or rock are <b>ten handbreadths high,</b> they belong <b>to the balcony;</b> if they are <b>lower than this,</b> they may be used only <b>by</b> the inhabitants of <b>the courtyard.</b>

### Part 6
<b>In what</b> case <b>are these matters,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that anything higher than ten handbreadths belongs to the balcony, <b>stated?</b> When the mound or embankment is <b>near</b> the balcony. <b>But in</b> a case where the embankment or mound is <b>distant</b> from it, <b>even</b> if it is <b>ten handbreadths high,</b> the right to use the embankment or mound goes <b>to</b> the members of <b>the courtyard. And what is</b> considered <b>near? Anything that is not four handbreadths removed</b> from the balcony.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: It is <b>obvious</b> that if the residents of two courtyards established separate <i>eiruvin</i>, and the residents of both courtyards have convenient access to a certain area, the residents of <b>this</b> courtyard <b>through an entrance, and</b> the residents of <b>that</b> courtyard <b>through</b> another <b>entrance, this is</b> similar to the case of <b>a window between two courtyards.</b> If the residents did not establish a joint <i>eiruv</i>, the use of this window is prohibited to the residents of both courtyards.

### Part 8
It is similarly obvious that if a place can be used by the residents <b>of this</b> courtyard only <b>by throwing</b> an object onto it <b>and</b> by the residents <b>of that</b> courtyard only <b>by throwing,</b> but it cannot be conveniently used by either set of residents, then <b>this is</b> equivalent to the case of <b>a wall between two courtyards.</b> If there is a wall between two courtyards, it may not be used by either courtyard. Likewise, if a place can be used by the residents <b>of this</b> courtyard only <b>by lowering</b> an object down to it <b>and</b> by the residents <b>of that</b> courtyard <b>by</b> a similar act of <b>lowering, this is</b> comparable to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a ditch between two courtyards,</b> which may not be used by the residents of either courtyard.

### Part 9
It is likewise obvious that in a place that can be conveniently used by the residents <b>of this</b> courtyard <b>through an entrance but</b> can be used by the residents of <b>that</b> courtyard only <b>by throwing</b> an object onto it, <b>this is</b> governed by the ruling <b>of Rabba bar Rav Huna,</b> who said that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This place may be used only by those who have access to the area by way of an entrance. Likewise, a place that can be conveniently used by the residents <b>of this</b> courtyard <b>through an entrance but</b> can be used by the residents <b>of that</b> courtyard only <b>by lowering</b> an object down to it, <b>this is</b> governed by the ruling <b>of Rav Sheizvi,</b> who said <b>that Rav Naḥman said:</b> This place may be used only by those who have convenient access to it.

### Part 10
The ruling in each of the aforementioned cases is clear. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> concerning a place that can be used by the residents <b>of this</b> courtyard only <b>by lowering</b> an object down to it <b>and by</b> the residents <b>of that</b> courtyard only <b>by throwing</b> an object on top of it? In other words, if an area is lower than one courtyard but higher than the other, so that neither set of residents has convenient access to it, which of them is entitled to use it?

### Part 11
<b>Rav said:</b> It is <b>prohibited</b> for <b>both</b> sets of residents to use it. As the use of the area is equally inconvenient to the residents of both courtyards, they retain equal rights to it and render it prohibited for the other group to use. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> The use of the area <b>is granted to those who</b> can reach it <b>by lowering, as</b> it is relatively easy <b>for them</b> to lower objects to it, and therefore <b>its use is</b> more <b>convenient;</b> whereas <b>for the others,</b> who must throw onto it, <b>its use is</b> more <b>demanding. And</b> there is a principle concerning Shabbat: <b>Anything whose use is convenient for one</b> party <b>and</b> more <b>demanding for another</b> party, <b>one provides it to that</b> one <b>whose use</b> of it <b>is convenient.</b>

### Part 12
In order to decide between these two opinions, the Gemara attempts to adduce a proof from the mishna: If <b>the residents of</b> houses that open directly into <b>a courtyard and the residents of</b> apartments that open onto <b>a balcony</b> from which stairs lead down to that courtyard <b>forgot and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> between them, <b>anything</b> in the courtyard <b>that is ten handbreadths high</b> belongs <b>to the balcony,</b> while anything that is <b>less than this</b> height belongs <b>to the courtyard.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara first explains: <b>It might have entered your mind</b> to say: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the <b>balcony</b> mentioned in the mishna?
