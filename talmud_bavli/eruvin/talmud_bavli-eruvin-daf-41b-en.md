### Part 1
<b>as, if it should enter your mind</b> to say that Rav Yehuda said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis with regard <b>to all</b> the cases in the mishna, including that of the Ninth of Av that occurs on Shabbat eve, there is a difficulty: <b>Didn’t Rabba raise a dilemma before Rav Yehuda</b> with regard to this issue, <b>and he did not answer him?</b> This demonstrates that he did not have a decisive ruling on this subject.

### Part 2
The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your opinion,</b> that the issue had not been resolved, there is a difficulty with <b>that</b> which <b>Mar Zutra expounded in the name of Rav Huna:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one fasts and completes</b> the fast on Shabbat eve. <b>Didn’t Rabba</b> also <b>raise</b> this <b>dilemma before Rav Huna, and he</b> too <b>did not answer him?</b> How could Mar Zutra have reported this halakhic ruling in the name of Rav Huna?

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> you must say that <b>this</b> dilemma that Rabba raised to Rav Huna was <b>before</b> Rav Huna <b>heard</b> Rav’s ruling on the subject; whereas <b>this,</b> i.e., Rav Huna’s statement as cited by Mar Zutra, was made <b>after he heard</b> Rav’s ruling on the matter, and the problem was resolved for him. <b>Here, too,</b> with regard to Rav Yehuda, we can say that <b>this</b> dilemma that Rabba raised before Rav Yehuda was <b>before</b> Rav Yehuda <b>heard</b> Rav’s ruling on the topic, and therefore he did not know how to answer Rabba; whereas <b>this,</b> i.e., Rav Yehuda’s statement in the name of Rav, was made <b>after he heard it.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara repeats the statement cited above in passing: <b>Mar Zutra expounded in the name of Rav Huna:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one fasts and completes</b> the fast on the eves of Shabbat and Festivals.
