### Part 1
<b>as, if it should enter your mind</b> to say that Rav Yehuda said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis with regard <b>to all</b> the cases in the mishna, including that of the Ninth of Av that occurs on Shabbat eve, there is a difficulty: <b>Didn’t Rabba raise a dilemma before Rav Yehuda</b> with regard to this issue, <b>and he did not answer him?</b> This demonstrates that he did not have a decisive ruling on this subject.

### Part 2
The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your opinion,</b> that the issue had not been resolved, there is a difficulty with <b>that</b> which <b>Mar Zutra expounded in the name of Rav Huna:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one fasts and completes</b> the fast on Shabbat eve. <b>Didn’t Rabba</b> also <b>raise</b> this <b>dilemma before Rav Huna, and he</b> too <b>did not answer him?</b> How could Mar Zutra have reported this halakhic ruling in the name of Rav Huna?

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> you must say that <b>this</b> dilemma that Rabba raised to Rav Huna was <b>before</b> Rav Huna <b>heard</b> Rav’s ruling on the subject; whereas <b>this,</b> i.e., Rav Huna’s statement as cited by Mar Zutra, was made <b>after he heard</b> Rav’s ruling on the matter, and the problem was resolved for him. <b>Here, too,</b> with regard to Rav Yehuda, we can say that <b>this</b> dilemma that Rabba raised before Rav Yehuda was <b>before</b> Rav Yehuda <b>heard</b> Rav’s ruling on the topic, and therefore he did not know how to answer Rabba; whereas <b>this,</b> i.e., Rav Yehuda’s statement in the name of Rav, was made <b>after he heard it.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara repeats the statement cited above in passing: <b>Mar Zutra expounded in the name of Rav Huna:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one fasts and completes</b> the fast on the eves of Shabbat and Festivals.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one whom gentiles</b> forcibly <b>took him out</b> beyond the Shabbat limit, <b>or</b> if <b>an evil spirit</b> took him out, i.e., he was temporarily insane, and found himself outside the Shabbat limit, he <b>has only four cubits</b> that he may walk from where he is standing.

### Part 7
If the gentiles <b>returned him,</b> or if he came back while still under the influence of the evil spirit, <b>it is as though he had never left</b> his Shabbat limit, and he may move about within his original limit as before.

### Part 8
If the gentiles <b>brought him to a different city</b> that was surrounded by walls, or if they <b>put him into a pen or a stable,</b> i.e., animal enclosures, the Sages disagree. <b>Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya say: He may walk</b> about <b>the entire</b> city, as the whole city is considered like four cubits. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva say: He has only four cubits</b> from where he was placed.

### Part 9
The mishna relates: There was <b>an incident where</b> all of these Sages <b>were coming from Pelandarsin,</b> an overseas location, <b>and their boat set sail on the sea</b> on Shabbat, taking them beyond their Shabbat limit. <b>Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya walked</b> about <b>the entire</b> boat, as they hold that the entire boat is considered like four cubits, while <b>Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva did not move beyond four cubits, as they sought to be stringent with themselves.</b>

### Part 10
The mishna further relates that on <b>one occasion, they did not enter the port [<i>namel</i>] until after nightfall</b> on Shabbat eve. The others <b>said to Rabban Gamliel: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>alighting</b> from the boat at this time? In other words, were we already within the city’s limit before Shabbat commenced?

### Part 11
<b>He said to them: You are permitted</b> to alight, <b>as I was watching, and</b> I observed that <b>we were</b> already <b>within the</b> city’s <b>limit before nightfall.</b> We acquired our resting place in the city during the twilight period. Therefore, it is permitted to walk throughout the city even after nightfall.

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Since the Gemara discussed one who stepped beyond the Shabbat limit due to an evil spirit, the Gemara cites a related <i>baraita</i>, in which <b>the Sages taught: Three matters cause a person to act against his</b> own <b>will and the will of his Maker,</b> and <b>they are: Gentiles, and an evil spirit, and the depths of</b> extreme <b>poverty.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical halakhic <b>difference</b> that emerges from this statement? The Gemara answers: It is significant as it teaches one <b>to request mercy for</b> people who suffer from those problems.

### Part 14
The Gemara cites a related teaching: <b>Three</b> classes of people <b>do not see the face of Gehenna,</b> because the suffering that they bear in this world atones for their sins, and <b>they are:</b> Those suffering <b>the depths of</b> extreme <b>poverty,</b> those afflicted <b>with intestinal disease, and</b> those oppressed by <b>creditors. And some say: Even one who has an evil wife</b> who constantly harasses him.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why don’t <b>the other</b> Sages include one with an evil wife among those who will not be punished in Gehenna? The Gemara answers: They maintain that <b>it is a mitzva to divorce an evil wife.</b> Therefore, that source of distress can be remedied.

### Part 16
<b>And</b> why do <b>the other</b> Sages include an evil wife? The Gemara answers: <b>Sometimes</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract is</b> very <b>large,</b> and consequently he cannot divorce her since he cannot afford to pay it. <b>Alternatively, he has children from her,</b> and he cannot raise them himself, <b>and</b> therefore he <b>cannot divorce her.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical halakhic <b>difference</b> that emerges from this statement? The Gemara answers: It is significant as it teaches one <b>to accept</b> those afflictions <b>with love,</b> knowing that they will exempt him from the punishment of Gehenna.

### Part 18
It was similarly taught: <b>Three</b> classes of people are liable to <b>die while conversing</b> with others, i.e., to die suddenly, although they appear to be in good health and are capable of engaging in conversation, <b>and they are: Those</b> afflicted <b>with intestinal sickness, and a woman in childbirth, and</b> one who is sick with <b>edema [<i>hidrokan</i>].</b>

### Part 19
Once again the Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical halakhic <b>difference</b> that emerges from this statement? The Gemara answers: It is significant as it teaches one <b>to prepare shrouds for them,</b> in case they need them suddenly.

### Part 20
The Gemara proceeds to analyze the mishna: <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: If one knowingly went out</b> beyond the Shabbat limit, <b>he has only four cubits</b> that he may walk. The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious. Now,</b> if with regard to <b>one whom gentiles</b> forcibly <b>took out</b> beyond the Shabbat limit, <b>he has only four cubits,</b> with regard to <b>one who knowingly went out, is it necessary</b> to teach that he has no more than four cubits within which he may walk?

### Part 21
<b>Rather, say</b> that Rav Naḥman’s statement means: If <b>he returned knowingly</b> to within the Shabbat limit after having been taken out by gentiles, <b>he has only four cubits</b> within which he may walk, but no more.

### Part 22
The Gemara asks: <b>This, too, we learned</b> from a precise reading of the mishna: If the gentiles <b>returned him</b> to within the Shabbat limit <b>it is as though he had never left</b> the Shabbat limit, and he may move about as before. By inference, <b>it is</b> specifically when the gentiles themselves <b>returned him that it is as though he never left</b> his Shabbat limit. <b>However, if gentiles took him out, and</b> then he <b>returned knowingly</b> to his Shabbat limit, it is as though he left knowingly, and he <b>has only four cubits</b> within which he may walk.

### Part 23
<b>Rather, say</b> Rav Naḥman’s statement as follows: If <b>he knowingly went out</b> beyond the Shabbat limit, <b>and was</b> later forcibly <b>returned by gentiles</b> to within his limit, <b>he has only four cubits</b> that he may walk, although he was restored to within his limit against his will.

### Part 24
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>This, too, we learned from</b> a precise reading of the mishna: If gentiles forcibly <b>took him out and</b> later <b>returned him, it is as though he never left.</b> By inference, <b>it is</b> specifically when the gentiles themselves forcibly <b>took him out and</b> then themselves <b>returned him</b> that <b>it is as though he never left</b> the Shabbat limit. <b>However, if he knowingly went out, no,</b> that is not the <i>halakha</i>, even if he was later forcibly returned by gentiles.

### Part 25
The Gemara answers: Rav Naḥman’s statement is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that perhaps the mishna is not referring to one specific case, but rather <b>it is teaching disjunctively,</b> i.e., referring to two separate cases, as follows: <b>One who was</b> forcibly <b>taken out</b> beyond the Shabbat limit <b>by gentiles and</b> later <b>returned knowingly has only four cubits</b> within which to walk. <b>But if he knowingly went out</b> beyond the Shabbat limit <b>and was</b> later forcibly <b>returned by gentiles, it is as though he had never left,</b> and he may move within his original limit as before. Therefore, Rav Naḥman <b>teaches us</b> that if he willingly went out beyond the Shabbat limit and was later forcibly returned by gentiles, it is considered as though he had returned knowingly, so that he has only four cubits within which to walk.

### Part 26
<b>They raised a dilemma before Rabba:</b> If a person who is restricted to an area of four cubits <b>needed to relieve himself</b> and no secluded spot is available, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>He said to them:</b> The Sages established a principle that <b>great</b> is <b>human dignity, which</b> even <b>supersedes a negative precept of the Torah,</b> and therefore a person is permitted to overstep the Shabbat limit fixed by the Sages in order to relieve himself modestly.

### Part 27
The Sages <b>of Neharde’a said: If</b> this person <b>is clever, he will enter</b> into his original Shabbat limit, <b>and since he</b> was permitted to <b>enter</b> it, <b>he entered,</b> and may remain there.

### Part 28
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> With regard to <b>produce that was taken out beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit and was</b> later <b>returned, even if</b> this was done <b>intentionally,</b> the produce <b>has not lost its place;</b> rather, it may still be carried within the entire limit. <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? It is that the produce did not go out willingly, but was taken <b>due to circumstances beyond its control.</b>

### Part 29
<b>Rav Yosef bar Shemaya raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Pappa</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov say:</b> It <b>is actually prohibited</b> to carry the produce beyond four cubits, <b>unless it was returned to its place unwittingly.</b> By inference, if it was returned <b>unwittingly, yes,</b> it is permitted, but if it was returned <b>intentionally,</b> it is <b>not.</b>

### Part 30
The Gemara answers: This <b>is</b> subject to a dispute between <b>the <i>tanna’im</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>produce that was taken out beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit,</b> if it was taken out <b>unwittingly, it may be eaten;</b> but if it was taken out <b>intentionally, it may not be eaten.</b>
