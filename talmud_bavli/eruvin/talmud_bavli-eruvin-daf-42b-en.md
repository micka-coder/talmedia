### Part 1
If a person <b>was measuring</b> the two thousand cubits of his Shabbat limit from the spot where he deposited his <i>eiruv</i>, <b>and his measuring ended in the middle of the city, he is permitted to carry throughout the city, provided that he does not overstep the limit by foot,</b> i.e., that he does not walk beyond his permitted limit in the middle of the city. If he cannot walk about on foot, <b>how can he carry</b> throughout the city? Is it <b>not by means of throwing?</b> This presents a difficulty for Rav Huna, who prohibits carrying by means of throwing in a place where it is prohibited to walk.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Huna said: No,</b> it means that he may carry in the city <b>by means of pulling,</b> i.e., he is permitted to pull objects from the other side of the city to the side where he is permitted to walk, for in this manner there is no concern that he might be drawn after the object, since he is bringing the object to him.

### Part 3
Similarly, <b>Rav Huna said:</b> If a person <b>was measuring</b> the two thousand cubits of his Shabbat limit from the spot where he deposited his <i>eiruv</i>, <b>and his measuring ended in the middle of a courtyard, he has only half the courtyard</b> in which to walk.

### Part 4
The Gemara raises a difficulty: It is <b>obvious</b> that he is not permitted to walk beyond his Shabbat limit. The Gemara answers: <b>Read</b> Rav Huna’s statement as follows: <b>He has half a courtyard,</b> i.e., Rav Huna addresses a different aspect of the issue; namely, he permits carrying in half the courtyard.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: However, <b>this too is obvious,</b> for why should it be prohibited for him to carry in a private domain where he is permitted to walk? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>we should be concerned that</b> if he is permitted to carry in half the courtyard, <b>he might come to carry in the entire</b> courtyard. <b>Consequently,</b> Rav Huna <b>teaches us</b> that this concern is not taken into account.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> Rav <b>Huna agrees with me</b> that carrying is not prohibited in a comparable case, out of concern that the person be drawn after the object he is carrying: If a person <b>was measuring</b> the two thousand cubits of his Shabbat limit from the spot where he deposited his <i>eiruv</i>, <b>and his measuring ended at the edge of the roof</b> of a house, most of which stood outside his Shabbat limit, <b>he is permitted to carry throughout the house</b> by means of throwing.

### Part 7
<b>What is the reason</b> that Rav Huna agrees in this case? <b>Because</b> the edge of <b>the roof of the house</b> is regarded as if it <b>presses</b> down vertically at the end of his Shabbat limit, thus creating a partition, and so there is no concern that he might pass beyond this partition and be drawn after his object.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said:</b> The dispute between Shmuel and Rav Huna is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> recorded in the mishna: If the gentiles <b>brought him to a different city</b> beyond his Shabbat limit, <b>or if they put him in a pen or a stable,</b> the Sages disagree. <b>Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya say: He may walk about the entire</b> stable or pen. Since they are enclosed by a partition, their entire area is considered like only four cubits. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva say: He has only four cubits</b> from where he was deposited.

### Part 9
<b>Is it not</b> the case that <b>Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, who said: He may walk about the entire</b> area, <b>do not prohibit walking in a pen or a stable due to walking in a field</b> where one is limited to four cubits? Rather, they say that since the stable is surrounded by partitions, it is not similar to a field, in which a person may not leave his four cubits.

### Part 10
<b>And since they did not prohibit walking</b> in a pen or a stable <b>due to</b> the limits imposed on <b>walking</b> in a field, <b>they would</b> certainly <b>not prohibit carrying</b> in a pen <b>due to</b> the limits imposed on <b>walking</b> in a field. Rather, they would permit a person to carry in a field that had been enclosed on Shabbat by gentiles, and even to throw into the part lying beyond his two thousand cubits, parallel to the opinion of Shmuel who did not decree against this.

### Part 11
<b>And</b> is it not the case that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva, who say</b> that <b>he has only four cubits, prohibit walking in a pen or a stable due to</b> the limits imposed on <b>walking in a field? And since they prohibit walking</b> in a pen or a stable <b>due to</b> the limits imposed on <b>walking</b> in a field, <b>they would also prohibit carrying</b> past the two thousand cubit limit by means of throwing <b>due to</b> the limits imposed on <b>walking</b> past there, in accordance with Rav Huna’s opinion.

### Part 12
The Gemara rejects this comparison: <b>From what</b> do you infer that this is the case? <b>Perhaps Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya did not prohibit walking in a pen or a stable due to</b> the limits imposed on <b>walking in a field,</b> but <b>this applies</b> only <b>there, because they are two</b> distinct <b>places.</b> In other words, the pen and stable are enclosed by partitions, while the field is not, and there is no reason to prohibit walking in one place out of concern that one might come to act improperly in a different place.

### Part 13
<b>However,</b> as for the prohibition of <b>carrying due to</b> the limits imposed on <b>walking,</b> where <b>it is</b> all <b>one place,</b> might we <b>also</b> say <b>that</b> even Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya <b>would decree</b> against carrying <b>as a preventive measure, lest the person be drawn after his object</b> and come to walk in a place prohibited to him.

### Part 14
The comparison can also be rejected from another angle: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva too, from what</b> can it be inferred <b>that</b> they prohibit walking beyond four cubits <b>due to a decree? Perhaps</b> it is <b>because they hold</b> that <b>when we say that the entire house is considered like four cubits,</b> this <b>applies only where one acquired his place of residence within the airspace of</b> the <b>partitions</b> of the house <b>while it was still day,</b> i.e., prior to the onset of Shabbat.

### Part 15
<b>However, where he did not acquire his place of residence within the airspace of</b> the <b>partitions</b> of the house <b>while it was still day,</b> the house, and all the more so the stable or pen, is <b>not</b> considered as four cubits; rather, it is measured based on the actual number of cubits it contains. Based on this explanation, this ruling indicates nothing with regard to the issue of throwing beyond the two-thousand cubit limit. Consequently, the Gemara rejects the link between the dispute of the <i>tanna’im</i> in the mishna and that of Rav Naḥman and Rav Huna.

### Part 16
<b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel with regard to a pen, a stable, and a boat. And Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel with regard to a boat, but not with regard to a stable or a pen.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara poses a question: <b>At any rate, all agree,</b> i.e., both Rav and Shmuel, <b>that</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel with regard to a boat. What is the reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is different in this case than in the other cases?

### Part 18
<b>Rabba said:</b> This is <b>since he acquired his place of residence within the partitions</b> of the boat <b>while it was still day,</b> in which case it is reasonable to say that the entire boat is considered as if it is only four cubits.

### Part 19
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> This is <b>since the boat</b> constantly moves the person out of his four cubits, <b>lifting him from the beginning of four</b> cubits <b>and placing him at the end of four</b> cubits. Since in any case he cannot restrict himself to any particular four cubits, even if he wished to do so, it is reasonable to say that he is permitted to walk about the entire boat.

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these two explanations? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to a case where <b>the walls of the boat were breached,</b> so that the person is no longer located between its partitions. <b>Alternatively,</b> there is a difference <b>with regard to</b> a case <b>where</b> the person <b>jumped from one boat to another,</b> so that he is no longer on the boat where he had acquired his place of residence. In both of these cases, Rabba’s reason no longer applies, but Rabbi Zeira’s reason does.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: As for <b>Rabbi Zeira, what is the reason</b> that he <b>did not state</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba,</b> whose explanation is more straightforward? The Gemara answers: He could have <b>said to you: The sides</b> of a boat are not regarded as proper partitions,
