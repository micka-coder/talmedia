### Part 1
<b>so that</b> the total width of six oxen <b>is approximately ten</b> cubits; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda said</b> the following, in accordance with his own opinion that the gap may be the size of two teams of four oxen each: The total width is <b>approximately thirteen cubits or approximately fourteen cubits.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: Why does the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> say: <b>Approximately ten</b> cubits in Rabbi Meir’s statement? <b>Isn’t it</b> exactly <b>ten</b> cubits? The Gemara answers: <b>Since he wanted to teach: Approximately thirteen, in the last clause,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda’s statement, he therefore also taught: Approximately ten, in the first clause.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: But how could he say: <b>Approximately thirteen,</b> when <b>it is more?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since he wanted to teach: Approximately fourteen,</b> he therefore also teaches: Approximately thirteen. The Gemara continues this line of questioning: <b>But they are not approximately fourteen,</b> but rather are less. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is a third of a cubit <b>more than thirteen</b> cubits, <b>and</b> it does <b>not reach fourteen</b> cubits.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Pappa said: With regard to</b> a water <b>cistern</b> whose own width is <b>eight</b> cubits, <b>everyone agrees,</b> both Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Meir, <b>that there is no need</b> to position <b>upright</b> boards between the double posts. In such a case, the width of the enclosed area, which is the width of the cistern together with the space required for the cows, i.e., two cubits on each side, is twelve cubits. Since the width of each double post is one cubit, the gap between the double posts is ten cubits, and a gap of this size is permitted even according to Rabbi Meir.

### Part 5
<b>With regard to a cistern</b> whose width is <b>twelve</b> cubits, <b>everyone agrees that there is a need for upright</b> posts. In this case, even if only two cubits are added on each side for the cows, the enclosed area will be sixteen cubits, and the gap between the double posts will be fourteen cubits, which must be closed off even according to Rabbi Yehuda.

### Part 6
<b>Where they disagree</b> is in the case of a cistern whose width is <b>between eight</b> and <b>twelve</b> cubits. <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, one must</b> add <b>upright</b> posts, whereas <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, one need not</b> add <b>upright</b> posts.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is Rav Pappa teaching us? We</b> already <b>learned</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that according to Rabbi Meir the gap may not be more than ten cubits, whereas according to Rabbi Yehuda it may be up to thirteen and a third cubits.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: Indeed, for us nothing new is being taught here; however, <b>Rav Pappa did not hear</b> this <b><i>baraita</i>, and he taught us</b> on his own <b>as</b> was taught in the <b><i>baraita</i>.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Extended, more, in a mound, a barrier of, a courtyard, that dried up;</b> this is a <b>mnemonic</b> containing key words in a series of issues raised by Abaye before Rabba. <b>Abaye raised a dilemma before Rabba:</b> If the gaps between the double posts were more than ten cubits, and <b>one extended the double posts,</b> that is, he widened each arm of the corner pieces, adding <b>the measure of an upright</b> board, i.e., another cubit, on each side, so that the gaps were no longer more than ten cubits, <b>what</b> is the law <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir?</b> Do we say that this suffices and it is no longer necessary to arrange upright boards between the two double posts, or must upright boards be positioned in the gaps?

### Part 10
Rabba said <b>to him: We</b> already <b>learned it</b> in the mishna: <b>Provided that he increases the boards. Does</b> this <b>not</b> mean <b>that he extends the double posts,</b> increasing them in width? Abaye refutes this: <b>No,</b> perhaps it means <b>that he makes more upright</b> boards, increasing them in number.

### Part 11
Rabba said to him: <b>If so, this</b> wording: <b>Provided that he increases the boards,</b> is imprecise, for it implies that one increases the boards themselves, and instead <b>it should have</b> stated: <b>Provided that he increases the</b> number of upright <b>boards.</b> Abaye answered: There is no need to be particular about this. <b>Teach: Provided that he increases</b> the number of upright <b>boards.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara cites an alternative version of the previous discussion: <b>There are</b> some <b>who say</b> that Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye as follows: <b>We</b> already <b>learned it: Provided that he increases the boards. Does</b> this <b>not</b> mean <b>that he makes more upright</b> boards, increasing them in number? Abaye refutes this: <b>No,</b> perhaps it means <b>that he extends the double posts,</b> increasing them in width.

### Part 13
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to say this, <b>from the fact that</b> the mishna <b>teaches: Provided that he increases the</b> upright <b>boards,</b> which implies that he extends the width of the boards themselves, in accordance with the second version. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that this is the correct understanding.

### Part 14
<b>Abaye raised</b> another <b>dilemma before Rabba:</b> If the gaps are <b>more than thirteen and a third cubits, what</b> is the law <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? Does he bring upright</b> boards and position them between the double posts, <b>or does he extend the double posts,</b> increasing them in width?

### Part 15
Rabba <b>said to him: We</b> already <b>learned</b> the law in a similar case, for it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How close</b> may the double posts be to the well? They can be <b>as</b> close as the length of <b>the head and most</b> of the body <b>of a cow. And how far</b> may they be from the well? If one wishes, the enclosed area may be expanded <b>even</b> to the area of <b>a <i>kor</i> and even</b> to <b>two <i>kor</i>,</b> provided that one increases the number of upright boards adequately to keep the gaps under the allowable limit.

### Part 16
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Up to an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>, it is permitted</b> to enclose the area in this manner; but expanding the enclosed area so it is <b>more than</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i> is prohibited.</b> The other Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Yehuda: Do you not agree with regard to a pen, and stable, and a backyard, and a courtyard that even</b> an area <b>of five <i>beit kor</i> and even of ten <i>beit kor</i> is permitted</b> for use?

### Part 17
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to them:</b> There is a significant difference between these cases, for <b>this</b> one, i.e., the wall surrounding the courtyard and the like, <b>is a</b> proper <b>partition, whereas these are</b> merely upright <b>boards.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks with regard to Rabba’s statement: <b>And if it is so</b> that one extend the double posts, this means that he makes a proper partition of increasingly wider double posts in the area surrounding the well, this is equivalent to the partitions of a courtyard, <b>he,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>should have</b> said: <b>This is a partition and that is a partition.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara answers: No proof can be brought from here, for Rabbi Yehuda <b>is saying as follows: This</b> one, the walls of a courtyard, are governed by <b>the laws of a partition, and</b> therefore <b>its breaches</b> must not be more than <b>ten</b> cubits. <b>Whereas these,</b> which surround the well, are governed by <b>the laws of</b> upright <b>boards, and their breaches</b> may be up to <b>thirteen and a third cubits.</b> Consequently, only an area of two <i>beit se’a</i> can be enclosed in this manner. Therefore, no proof can be brought from this <i>baraita</i> to Abaye’s dilemma.

### Part 20
<b>Abaye raised</b> another <b>dilemma before Rabba: Can a mound that rises</b> to a height of <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>within</b> an area of <b>four</b> cubits <b>serve as a double post or can it not serve as a double post?</b>

### Part 21
Rabba <b>said to him: We</b> already <b>learned this</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> If <b>a square stone was present, we see</b> the stone as if it were altered: <b>Wherever it can be divided</b> in such a way that <b>there would remain a cubit here</b> in one direction <b>and a cubit there</b> at a right angle to it, <b>it can serve as a double post; but if not, it cannot serve as a double post.</b>

### Part 22
<b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> If <b>a round stone was present, we see</b> the stone as if it were altered: <b>Wherever it could be chiseled</b> down into a square, <b>and then divided</b> in such a way that <b>there would remain a cubit here</b> in one direction <b>and a cubit there</b> at a right angle to it, <b>it can serve as a double post; but if not, it cannot serve as a double post.</b> In any case, it is learned from these two statements that anything can serve as a double post if it is of the requisite size and shape.

### Part 23
With regard to the <i>baraita</i> itself, the Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> these two <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara explains that one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, <b>holds</b> that <b>we say: We see, once.</b> However, <b>we do not say: We see, twice.</b> That is to say, while the stone can be considered as if it were divided, it cannot also be considered as though it were chiseled down into a square. <b>And</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, <b>holds</b> that <b>we even say: We see, twice.</b> Since a mound is similar to a round stone, it can therefore serve as a double post.

### Part 24
<b>Abaye raised</b> another <b>dilemma before Rabba:</b> With regard to <b>a barrier of reeds</b> in the shape of a double post, where <b>each reed is less than three</b> handbreadths apart from the next, so that they are considered connected by the principle of <i>lavud</i>, <b>can it serve as a double post or not?</b>

### Part 25
Rabba <b>said to him: We</b> already <b>learned this</b> law in a <i>baraita</i> that states: If <b>a tree, or a fence, or a barrier of reeds was present, it serves as a double post. Does</b> this <b>not</b> refer to a barrier of reeds where <b>each reed is less than three</b> handbreadths from the next?

### Part 26
The Gemara refutes this: <b>No,</b> it may perhaps refer to <b>a thicket of reeds</b> planted close together, forming a kind of post. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, it is</b> equivalent to <b>a tree,</b> and the <i>tanna</i> would not repeat the same case twice.

### Part 27
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>What, then?</b> Would you say that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a barrier of reeds where <b>each reed is less than three</b> handbreadths apart? If so, <b>it is a fence. Rather, what must you say</b> is that the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches two types of fence; here too,</b> then, you can say that it teaches <b>two types of tree,</b> and therefore no proof can be brought from this <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 28
The Gemara cites an alternative version of the previous discussion: <b>There are</b> some <b>who say</b> that the question was posed differently, and the <b>dilemma</b> Abaye <b>raised before</b> Rabba was about whether or not a dense <b>thicket of reeds</b> can serve as a double post. Rabba <b>said to him: We</b> already <b>learned this</b> law in the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a tree, or a fence, or a barrier of reeds was present, it can serve as a double post. Does</b> this <b>not</b> refer to <b>a thicket of reeds?</b>

### Part 29
The Gemara refutes this: <b>No,</b> it may perhaps refer to a barrier of reeds where <b>each reed is less than three</b> handbreadths apart from the next. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, it is</b> exactly <b>a fence.</b>

### Part 30
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>What, then?</b> Would you say that the <i>baraita</i> refers to <b>a thicket of reeds?</b> If so, <b>this is a tree. Rather, what must you say</b> is
