### Part 1
<b>and did not establish</b> a joint <b><i>eiruv</i>, if there is a partition four</b> handbreadths wide <b>in front of</b> the entrance to the balcony, the balcony <b>does not prohibit</b> the residents of the courtyard from carrying, as each area is considered to be independent. <b>And if not,</b> the balcony <b>prohibits</b> the residents of the courtyard from carrying in the courtyard. This indicates that a ladder between two courtyards is always considered an entrance, even when that policy leads to a stringent ruling, unless the two areas are separated by a partition.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here? With</b> a case where <b>the balcony is not ten</b> handbreadths <b>high</b> from the ground. Consequently, it does not constitute a domain in its own right, and it is part of the courtyard.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>If the balcony is not ten</b> handbreadths <b>high</b> and is therefore part of the courtyard, <b>when one places a partition, what of it?</b> The balcony should nevertheless be considered part of the courtyard. The Gemara answers: We are dealing here <b>with</b> a balcony that is entirely <b>fenced off</b> except for a section <b>up to ten cubits</b> wide, which serves as an entrance. In that case, <b>since</b> the residents of the balcony <b>place a partition</b> at this entrance, <b>they</b> thereby <b>remove themselves</b> entirely <b>from</b> the courtyard.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>a wall that one lined with ladders, even</b> along a length of <b>more than ten</b> cubits, <b>it</b> still retains <b>the status of a partition.</b> The ladders do not constitute an opening that is more than ten cubits wide, which would cause the wall to be regarded as breached and would invalidate the wall as a partition.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Beruna raised a contradiction to Rav Yehuda in the winepress at Rav Ḥanina’s house: Did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say</b> that such a wall <b>has the status of a partition? Didn’t Rav Naḥman say</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>the residents of a balcony and the residents of a courtyard who forgot and did not establish</b> a joint <b><i>eiruv</i>, if there is a partition</b> four handbreadths wide <b>in front</b> of the entrance to the balcony, the balcony <b>does not prohibit</b> the residents of the courtyard to carry; <b>and if not, it prohibits</b> the residents of the courtyard from carrying? This indicates that a ladder is considered an entrance, as the courtyard and the balcony are considered connected.

### Part 6
Rav Yehuda replied in the same manner as above: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with</b> a case where <b>the balcony is not ten</b> handbreadths <b>high,</b> and that is why it is regarded as connected to the courtyard. The Gemara asks: <b>If the balcony is not ten</b> handbreadths <b>high, when he places a partition, what of it?</b> The balcony should nevertheless be considered part of the courtyard. The Gemara answers: We are dealing here <b>with</b> a balcony that is entirely <b>fenced off</b> except for a section <b>up to ten cubits</b> wide, which serves as an entrance. In that case, <b>since</b> the residents of the balcony <b>place a partition</b> at this entrance, <b>they</b> thereby <b>remove themselves</b> entirely <b>from</b> the courtyard.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates that <b>certain residents of</b> the city of <b>Kakunya came before Rav Yosef</b> and <b>said to him: Provide us with someone who will establish an <i>eiruv</i> for our city.</b> The city had originally been a public city and had turned into a private one, requiring that part of the city be excluded from the <i>eiruv</i>. Rav Yosef <b>said to Abaye: Go, establish an <i>eiruv</i> for them, and see</b> to it <b>that there is no outcry against it in the study hall,</b> i.e., make sure the <i>eiruv</i> is valid beyond any doubt. <b>He went</b> and <b>saw</b> that <b>certain houses opened to the river</b> and not to the city. <b>He said: Let these</b> houses serve as <b>the section excluded</b> from the <i>eiruv</i> <b>for the city.</b>

### Part 8
Abaye subsequently <b>retracted</b> and <b>said:</b> This cannot be done, as <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for all of it; by inference, if they wanted to establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> for the entire city, <b>they would have been able to establish</b> such <b>an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> if not for the requirement to exclude a section of the city from the <i>eiruv</i>. However, these houses, which do not open to the city, could not have joined in an <i>eiruv</i> with the rest of the city in any case, and therefore they cannot serve as the excluded section. <b>Rather, I will create windows for them</b> between the courtyards of their houses and the rest of the city, <b>so that if they want to establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the rest of the city <b>by way of the windows, they can establish</b> such <b>an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> and then these houses will be fit to serve as the excluded section.

### Part 9
<b>He</b> subsequently <b>retracted</b> again and <b>said:</b> This <b>is not necessary, as Rabba bar Avuh established an <i>eiruv</i> for the entire</b> city of <b>Meḥoza,</b> which was a public city that had become a private one, <b>neighborhood by neighborhood, due to the</b> fact that the neighborhoods were separated by <b>ditches</b> from which <b>the cattle</b> would feed. In other words, Rabba bar Avuh established a separate <i>eiruv</i> for each neighborhood without excluding any of them, <b>as</b> he maintained that <b>each one was an excluded section for the other. And although</b> the neighborhoods <b>would not have been able to establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> together even <b>if they wanted</b> to, due to the ditches separating them, the neighborhoods were still able to serve as excluded areas for each other.

### Part 10
<b>He</b> subsequently <b>retracted</b> once again and <b>said:</b> The two cases <b>are not</b> really <b>comparable. There,</b> in Meḥoza, <b>if they wanted,</b> they could have <b>established</b> a single <b><i>eiruv</i> by way of the roofs;</b> but <b>these</b> houses <b>cannot establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the other houses of the city, and <b>therefore we must create windows</b> for them.

### Part 11
<b>He</b> subsequently <b>retracted</b> yet again and <b>said: Windows are also not necessary. As, that storehouse of straw which belonged to Mar bar Pofidata from Pumbedita was designated as the section excluded from</b> the <i>eiruv</i> arranged for the city of <b>Pumbedita,</b> which proves that it is not necessary for the excluded section to be one that could have been included in an <i>eiruv</i> with the rest of the city.

### Part 12
Abaye <b>said</b> to himself: <b>This is what the Master</b> meant when he <b>said to me: See</b> to it <b>that there is no outcry against it in the study hall.</b> Abaye now understood the many factors that had to be considered and how wary one must be of reaching a hasty conclusion.

### Part 13
The mishna stated that if a public city becomes a private city, one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for all of it <b>unless he maintains</b> an area <b>outside</b> the <i>eiruv</i> which is <b>like</b> the size of <b>the city of Ḥadasha</b> in Judea. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: There was a certain city in Judea and its name was Ḥadasha, and it had fifty residents</b> including <b>men, women, and children. And the Sages would use it to measure</b> the size of the section that must be excluded from an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>and it</b> itself was <b>the excluded section</b> of the <i>eiruv</i> of a larger city that was adjacent to it.

### Part 14
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: As for <b>Ḥadasha, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it permissible to establish an <i>eiruv</i> for Ḥadasha itself without excluding a section of the city from the <i>eiruv</i>? The Gemara answers: With regard to <b>Ḥadasha, just as it was the excluded section of the larger</b> city, <b>the larger</b> city <b>was also the excluded section of the smaller</b> city.

### Part 15
<b>Rather,</b> the question pertains to a small city <b>like Ḥadasha</b> that stands by itself, not in proximity to a larger city: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does a small city require an excluded section or not? <b>Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda</b> disagreed about this issue. <b>One said: It requires an excluded section; and one said: It does not require an excluded section.</b>

### Part 16
It is stated in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The excluded area must be large enough to include at least <b>three courtyards</b> with two houses each. <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> However, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Even one house and one courtyard</b> suffice. The Gemara expresses surprise at the wording of this statement: <b>Can it enter your mind</b> that <b>one courtyard</b> even without a house is sufficient? <b>Rather,</b> correct it and <b>say</b> as follows: <b>One house in one courtyard.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Is that</b> ruling <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> based on oral <b>tradition or</b> his own <b>logic?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: What</b> practical <b>difference</b> does Rabbi Yitzḥak’s source make <b>to us?</b> Abaye <b>said to him,</b> quoting a well-known adage: When you <b>study Talmud is it</b> merely <b>a song?;</b> Is the material you study like the lyrics of a song that you do not understand? It is proper to investigate all aspects of the statements of the Sages, regardless of the practical ramifications.

### Part 18
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who was to the east</b> of his home when Shabbat began, <b>and he had said to his son</b> before Shabbat: <b>Establish an <i>eiruv</i> for me to the west;</b> or, if he was <b>to the west</b> of his home <b>and he had said to his son: Establish an <i>eiruv</i> for me to the east,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: <b>If there is</b> a distance of <b>two thousand cubits from his</b> current location <b>to his house, and</b> the distance <b>to his <i>eiruv</i> is greater than this, he is permitted</b> to walk <b>to his house,</b> and from there he may walk two thousand cubits in every direction, <b>but it is prohibited</b> for him <b>to</b> walk to the spot where his son had deposited <b>his <i>eiruv</i>.</b>

### Part 19
If the distance from one’s current location <b>to his <i>eiruv</i> is two thousand cubits,</b> and the distance <b>to his house is greater than this, he is prohibited</b> from walking to his house, <b>and he is permitted to</b> walk to the spot of <b>his <i>eiruv</i>,</b> and from there he may walk two thousand cubits in every direction. In other words, with regard to the Shabbat limit, one’s place of residence for Shabbat cannot be more than two thousand cubits from his physical location when Shabbat begins.

### Part 20
<b>One who places his <i>eiruv</i> in the outskirts of the city,</b> i.e., within an area of slightly more than seventy cubits surrounding the city, it is as though <b>he has not done anything.</b> The two thousand cubits of one’s Shabbat limit are measured from the edge of the outskirts of the city even if there is no <i>eiruv</i>, and one therefore gains nothing from placing an <i>eiruv</i> within this area.

### Part 21
If, however, <b>he placed</b> his <i>eiruv</i> <b>outside the</b> city’s <b>boundary, even</b> if he placed it only <b>one cubit</b> beyond the city,
