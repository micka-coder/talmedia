### Part 1
<b>don’t you</b> at least <b>concede</b> that we must be concerned that <b>perhaps the</b> leather <b>flask will burst, and retroactively this</b> person would have been <b>drinking <i>tevel</i>?</b> Rabbi Meir <b>said to them: When it bursts,</b> I will consider the matter, but now I am not concerned about this possibility.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>a Festival adjacent to Shabbat, whether before it,</b> on a Friday, <b>or after it,</b> on a Sunday, <b>a person</b> may <b>establish two <i>eiruvin</i></b> of Shabbat borders [<i>teḥumin</i>] <b>and say</b> as follows: <b>My <i>eiruv</i> on the first</b> day shall be <b>to the east, and on the second</b> day <b>to the west.</b> Alternatively, one may say: <b>On the first</b> day it shall be <b>to the west and on the second</b> day <b>to the east.</b> Similarly, one may say: <b>My <i>eiruv</i></b> shall apply <b>on the first</b> day, <b>but on the second</b> day I shall be <b>like</b> the rest of <b>the inhabitants of my town,</b> or: <b>My <i>eiruv</i></b> shall apply <b>on the second</b> day, <b>but on the first</b> day I shall be <b>like</b> the rest of <b>the inhabitants of my town.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And the Rabbis</b> disagree and <b>say</b> that such a split is impossible. Rather, <b>he either establishes an <i>eiruv</i> in one direction</b> for both days, <b>or he establishes no <i>eiruv</i> at all; either he establishes an <i>eiruv</i> for</b> the <b>two days, or he establishes no <i>eiruv</i> at all.</b>

### Part 4
<b>What does one do</b> to establish an <i>eiruv</i> that will be valid for both the Festival and Shabbat? <b>He</b> or his agent <b>brings</b> the <i>eiruv</i> to the location that he wishes to establish as his residence <b>on</b> the eve of <b>the first</b> day, <b>and he stays</b> there <b>with it until nightfall,</b> the time when the <i>eiruv</i> establishes that location as his residence for the Festival, <b>and</b> then <b>he takes it</b> with him <b>and goes away,</b> so that it will not become lost before the following evening, in which case he would not have an <i>eiruv</i> for the second day. <b>On</b> the eve of the <b>second</b> day, he takes it back to the same place as the day before, and <b>he stays</b> there <b>with it until nightfall,</b> thereby establishing his residence for Shabbat, and then he may <b>eat</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>and go away,</b> if he so desires. <b>Consequently, he benefits</b> in that he is permitted to <b>walk</b> in the direction that he desires, <b>and he benefits</b> in that he is permitted to eat <b>his <i>eiruv</i>.</b>

### Part 5
However, if the <i>eiruv</i> <b>was eaten on</b> the <b>first</b> day, <b>his <i>eiruv</i></b> is effective <b>for</b> the <b>first</b> day, <b>and his <i>eiruv</i> is not</b> effective <b>for the second</b> day.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to them:</b> If so, <b>you agree with me that</b> Shabbat and a Festival <b>constitute two</b> distinct <b>sanctities,</b> as if not, the <i>eiruv</i> that went into effect during the twilight period on the eve of the first day should have remained in effect for both days, even if it was eaten during the first day. This being the case, you should also agree with me that one can make two separate <i>eiruvin</i> for the two days in two different directions.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the wording employed by the Rabbis: First, the Rabbis state that one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>in one direction. What does this</b> mean? He must establish an <i>eiruv</i> in that direction <b>for two days.</b> Then they state that he may establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>for two days. What does this</b> mean? He must establish an <i>eiruv</i> for the two days <b>in one direction.</b> If so, <b>this is</b> exactly the same as <b>the first</b> clause.

### Part 8
The Gemara explains: <b>This is what the Rabbis said to Rabbi Eliezer: Don’t you concede that</b> in the case of <b>one day, one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for half</b> the day <b>to the north and</b> for <b>half of it to the south?</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: Indeed,</b> I agree. They then said to him: <b>Just as one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for one day, half</b> the day <b>to the north and half</b> the day <b>to the south, so too, one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for two</b> consecutive <b>days</b> of sanctity, <b>one day to the east and one day to the west.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> respond? He holds as follows: <b>There,</b> one day constitutes <b>one sanctity,</b> and it is impossible to impossible to divide the day such that the <i>eiruv</i> applies to one direction for one half of the day and to another direction for the other half of the day. <b>Here,</b> where Shabbat and a Festival fall out on consecutive days, they are <b>two</b> separate <b>sanctities,</b> and therefore one can establish separate <i>eiruvin</i> for the two days.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>Don’t you concede that if one established an <i>eiruv</i> with his feet</b> by actually going to the place where he desires to establish an <i>eiruv</i> <b>on</b> the eve of <b>the first day</b> and remaining there during the twilight period, as opposed to depositing food there beforehand, he nonetheless must <b>establish</b> another <b><i>eiruv</i> with his feet on</b> the eve of <b>the second day,</b> and one <i>eiruv</i> does not suffice; similarly, if <b>his <i>eiruv</i> was eaten on the first day, he may not</b> rely <b>on it</b> and <b>go out</b> beyond the limit permitted to the rest of the inhabitants of his town <b>on the second day?</b>

### Part 11
The Rabbis <b>said to him: Indeed,</b> that is correct. Rabbi Eliezer then <b>said to them:</b> Then <b>isn’t it</b> correct that <b>they are two</b> distinct <b>sanctities,</b> and therefore one should be permitted to establish two separate <i>eiruvin</i> for the two days? <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> respond? <b>They are in doubt</b> about this issue, <b>and</b> therefore their ruling <b>here is stringent</b> and prohibits establishing separate <i>eiruvin</i> for the two days in different directions, in case the two days are considered a single sanctity; <b>and</b> their ruling <b>here is stringent</b> and they require a separate <i>eiruv</i> for each day, in case the two days are considered distinct sanctities.

### Part 12
The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Eliezer: Don’t you concede that one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> initially on a Festival for Shabbat,</b> i.e., if a Festival occurs on a Friday and one forgot to establish an <i>eiruv</i> on the eve of the Festival, he may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> for Shabbat on the Festival itself? Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: Indeed,</b> that is correct. They said to him: Then <b>isn’t it</b> correct that the two days constitute <b>one sanctity?</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara responds that <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> holds that <b>there,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is so not because the two days constitute a single sanctity, but <b>due to</b> the prohibition of <b>preparation</b> on a Festival for Shabbat, which includes establishing an <i>eiruv</i>.

### Part 14
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If one established an <i>eiruv</i> with his feet</b> by going to the place he wished to establish as his residence <b>on</b> the eve of <b>the first day</b> and remaining there during the twilight period, <b>he must</b> nevertheless <b>establish</b> another <b><i>eiruv</i> with his feet on</b> the eve of <b>the second day.</b> Similarly, if he had established an <i>eiruv</i> by depositing food in the place he wished to establish as his residence, and <b>his <i>eiruv</i> was eaten on the first day, he may not</b> rely <b>on it</b> and <b>go out</b> beyond the limit permitted to the rest of the inhabitants of the town <b>on the second day.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b>
