### Part 1
<b>with regard to a wall that is not inclined,</b> the following distinction applies: If the end of the scroll is <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>above</b> the ground, <b>he</b> may <b>roll it</b> back <b>to himself;</b> but if it is <b>below three</b> handbreadths from the ground, it is considered as though the scroll is on the ground, and <b>he must</b> therefore <b>turn it</b> facedown <b>onto the writing.</b>

### Part 2
It was stated in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> if the scroll <b>is removed only</b> a needle breadth <b>from the ground,</b> one rolls it back to himself. The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yehuda maintains <b>that</b> in order for an object to be deemed at rest, <b>we require</b> that it <b>rest atop something.</b> Consequently, a scroll that is not actually touching the ground is not considered resting and may be rolled back.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> consider <b>that</b> which <b>Rava said</b> with regard to an object located <b>within three</b> handbreadths of the ground. Rava said that according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Akiva and claim that something in the air is not considered to be at rest, nevertheless, for one to incur liability <b>it is necessary</b> for the object to <b>rest</b> on a surface. <b>Let us say</b> that <b>he stated his <i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> only one of <b>the <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> but not in accordance with all of them. This is an unacceptable conclusion.

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects the previous explanation in favor of the following one: The mishna <b>is all</b> in accordance with <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and it is incomplete and is teaching</b> the following: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that once the end of the scroll is within ten handbreadths of the ground it may not be rolled back <b>said?</b> It was said in the case of <b>an inclined wall. But with regard to a wall that is not inclined, even</b> if the end of the scroll is <b>less than three handbreadths</b> from the ground, <b>one</b> may <b>roll it</b> back <b>to himself, as Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> if the scroll <b>is removed only a needle breadth from the ground, he rolls it</b> back <b>to himself.</b>

### Part 5
<b>What is the reason</b> for this ruling? The reasoning is that for an object to be considered at rest, <b>we require</b> that it <b>rest atop some</b> surface. Consequently, if the scroll is not actually touching the ground, it is not considered at rest, even if it is less than three handbreadths from the ground.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a ledge in front of a window,</b> that is ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide, <b>one</b> may <b>place</b> objects <b>upon it or remove</b> them <b>from it on Shabbat</b> via the window.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies: <b>This ledge, to where does it protrude? If you say</b> that the ledge <b>protrudes into a public domain,</b> one should be prohibited to place an object on it, as <b>we should be concerned lest</b> the object <b>fall and he</b> will forget and <b>come to bring it in</b> from the public domain to a private domain. <b>Rather,</b> it must be <b>that</b> the ledge <b>protrudes into a private domain;</b> but if so, it is <b>obvious</b> that it is permitted to place objects on it and to remove them.

### Part 8
<b>Abaye said: Actually,</b> the mishna is dealing with a case <b>where it protrudes into a public domain, and what</b> is the meaning of <b>that</b> which <b>it teaches: One</b> may <b>place</b> objects <b>upon it?</b> This refers to <b>fragile utensils,</b> which would break instantly if they fell. Consequently, there is no concern that one might then bring them in from the public domain to the private domain.

### Part 9
The Gemara comments: <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a ledge in front of a window that protrudes into a public domain, one</b> may <b>place on it bowls, cups, small cups [<i>kitoniyot</i>], and saucers.</b> All of these utensils are made of fragile glass or earthenware, which supports Abaye’s opinion.

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And one</b> may <b>use</b> this ledge along the <b>entire</b> length of <b>the wall,</b> if the ledge spans its length, whether in close proximity to the window or removed from it, <b>until the lower ten</b> handbreadths of the wall, but not if the ledge is lower than that. <b>And if there is one</b> other <b>ledge below it</b> but still ten handbreadths above the ground, <b>one</b> may <b>use</b> the lower ledge along the entire length of the wall; <b>but with regard to the upper</b> ledge, <b>one</b> may <b>use it only opposite his window.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> upper <b>ledge, what are its circumstances? If it is not four</b> handbreadths deep, although <b>it is an exempt domain</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, which means it does not pose a problem in itself, <b>one should</b> nonetheless <b>not</b> be permitted to <b>use</b> it <b>even opposite his window,</b> as anything placed on this narrow ledge is likely to fall. Consequently, it is as though he has thrown the object directly to the ground. <b>And if it is four</b> handbreadths deep, <b>let him use</b> the ledge along the <b>entire</b> length of the ledge along <b>the wall.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Abaye said:</b> We are dealing with a case where <b>the lower</b> ledge <b>is four</b> handbreadths deep <b>and the upper</b> ledge <b>is not four</b> handbreadths deep, but the <b>windowsill</b> on the inside <b>completes it to</b> form a surface <b>four</b> handbreadths deep. Accordingly, <b>one</b> may <b>use</b> the part of the upper ledge <b>opposite the window, as it is</b> considered <b>an extension of the window,</b> but the parts <b>to this side or to that side</b> of the window are <b>prohibited,</b> as they are less than four handbreadths deep.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person</b> may <b>stand in a private domain and move</b> objects that are <b>in a public domain,</b> as there is no concern that he might mistakenly bring them into the private domain. Similarly, one may stand <b>in a public domain and move</b> objects <b>in a private domain, provided that he does not carry</b> them <b>beyond four cubits</b> in the public domain, which is prohibited on Shabbat.

### Part 14
However, <b>a person</b> may <b>not stand in a private domain and urinate into a public domain,</b> nor may one stand <b>in a public domain and urinate into a private domain. And likewise, one</b> may <b>not spit</b> in such a manner that the spittle passes from a private domain to a public domain or vice versa.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even once</b> a person’s <b>spittle is gathered in his mouth, he</b> may <b>not walk four cubits</b> in the public domain <b>until he spits</b> it out, for he would be carrying the accumulated spittle in his mouth, which is akin to carrying any other object.

### Part 16
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Shelamiya would teach</b> this mishna <b>to Ḥiyya bar Rav before Rav</b> as follows: <b>A person</b> may <b>not stand in a private domain and move</b> objects that are <b>in a public domain.</b> Rav <b>said to him:</b> Have <b>you abandoned</b> the majority opinion of <b>the Rabbis and followed</b> the solitary dissenting opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who is stringent in this regard?
