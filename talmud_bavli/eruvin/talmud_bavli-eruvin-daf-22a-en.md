### Part 1
<b>who, for</b> the Torah’s <b>sake, gets up early</b> in the morning [<i>shaḥar</i>] <b>and stays late</b> in the evening [<i>erev</i>] <b>in the study hall. Rabba said: In him who, for</b> the Torah’s <b>sake, blackens his face like a raven,</b> i.e., who fasts and deprives himself for the sake of Torah study.

### Part 2
<b>Rava said: In him who makes himself cruel to his sons and</b> other <b>members of his household like a raven</b> for the sake of Torah. This <b>was the case with Rav Adda bar Mattana,</b> who <b>was</b> about to <b>go to the study hall</b> to learn Torah, and <b>his wife said to him: What shall I do for your children?</b> How shall I feed them in your absence? <b>He said to her: Are all the rushes [<i>kurmei</i>] in the marsh</b> already <b>gone?</b> If there is no other bread, let them eat food prepared from rushes.

### Part 3
The Gemara proceeds to interpret a different verse homiletically: <b>“And He repays them that hate Him to His face to destroy them;</b> He will not be slack to him that hates Him, He will repay him to his face” (Deuteronomy 7:10). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Were the verse not written</b> in this manner, <b>it</b> would <b>be impossible to utter it,</b> in deference to God, for it could be understood, <b>as it were, like a person who bears a burden on his face, and wishes to throw it off.</b> Written slightly differently, the verse could have been understood as implying that God is unable, as it were, to bear the situation, but must punish the wicked immediately.

### Part 4
With regard to the words <b>“He shall not be slack to him that hates Him,” Rabbi Ila said: He will not be slack</b> in bringing punishment <b>to him that hates Him, but He will be slack</b> in rewarding <b>those who are absolutely righteous,</b> as the reward of the righteous does not arrive immediately, but only in the World-to-Come.

### Part 5
<b>And that</b> is <b>what Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And you shall keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments <b>which I command you today to do them”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:11)? It means: <b>Today</b> is the time <b>to do them,</b> in this world, <b>and tomorrow</b> is <b>not</b> the time <b>to do them,</b> as there is no obligation or opportunity to fulfill mitzvot in the World-to-Come. Furthermore, it means: <b>Today</b> is the time <b>to do them,</b> but only <b>tomorrow,</b> in the ultimate future, is the time <b>to receive reward for</b> doing <b>them.</b>

### Part 6
In a similar vein, <b>Rabbi Ḥaggai said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed: The Lord, the Lord, merciful and gracious, <b>long-suffering [<i>erekh appayim</i>],</b> and abundant in love and truth” (Exodus 34:6)? Why does it say “<i>erekh appayim</i>,” using a plural form? <b>It should have</b> said <b><i>erekh af</i>,</b> using the singular form.

### Part 7
What this means is that God is long-suffering in two ways: He is <b>long-suffering toward the righteous,</b> i.e., He delays payment of their reward; and He is also <b>long-suffering toward the wicked,</b> i.e., He does not punish them immediately.

### Part 8
The mishna stated that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The area may be expanded <b>up to</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> an area of five thousand square cubits. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages in clarification of this statement: <b>Did he speak</b> of the area of <b>the cistern</b> itself <b>and</b> that enclosed by <b>the</b> upright <b>boards,</b> that the total area enclosed by the upright boards may be expanded up to, but may not exceed, an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>? <b>Or perhaps he spoke</b> of the area of <b>the cistern without</b> that enclosed by <b>the</b> upright <b>boards,</b> that the cistern itself may be expanded up to an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>? In that case, the total area enclosed by the boards could exceed an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>.

### Part 9
The underlying rationale of each side of this dilemma is as follows: Does one <b>fix his eyes on his cistern,</b> keeping in mind that the partition is made because of it, <b>and</b> therefore, since the area of the cistern is not greater than an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>we do not decree lest he come to carry</b> also <b>in an enclosure [<i>karpef</i>],</b> an enclosed storage space behind the house that was not originally surrounded by a fence for the purpose of residence, even when it is <b>more than</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>?</b>

### Part 10
<b>Or perhaps a person fixes his eyes on his partition,</b> and does not pay attention to the cistern, but only to the area enclosed by the partition. <b>And</b> in this case <b>we</b> do <b>decree, lest he come to confuse</b> this case <b>with</b> that of <b>a <i>karpef</i></b> that is <b>larger than</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> and come to carry there, because of the similarity between them.

### Part 11
In order to resolve this question, the Gemara cites a proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How close</b> may the boards be to the well? They may be <b>as</b> close as the length of <b>the head and most</b> of the body <b>of a cow. And how far may they be</b> from the well? The enclosed area may be expanded <b>even</b> to the area of <b>a <i>beit kor</i> and even two <i>beit kor</i>,</b> provided that one adds more upright boards or increases their size so as to reduce the size of the gaps between them. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Up to an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>, it is permitted</b> to enclose the area in this manner; <b>more than</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>, it is prohibited.</b>

### Part 12
The other Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Yehuda: Do you not concede with regard to a pen, a stable, a backyard, and a courtyard, that even one</b> the size <b>of five <i>beit kor</i> and</b> even <b>of ten <i>beit kor</i> is permitted</b> for use?

### Part 13
Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to them:</b> A distinction can be made between the cases, for <b>this,</b> the wall surrounding the pen, the stable or the yard, is a proper <b>partition,</b> and hence it is permitted to carry in them even if they are more than an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>. However, <b>these are</b> only upright <b>boards,</b> and they only allow one to carry if the area they enclose is not more than an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>.

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: A cistern</b> the length of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i> by</b> the width of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i> is permitted, and they only said to distance</b> the upright boards from the cistern <b>as</b> much as the length of <b>the head and most</b> of the body <b>of a cow.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara tries to draw an inference from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar spoke</b> only <b>of the cistern</b> itself <b>and not</b> of the upright <b>boards,</b> we can <b>infer</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda spoke of</b> both <b>the cistern</b> itself <b>and</b> the area enclosed by <b>the</b> upright <b>boards.</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: It is <b>not so.</b> When <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> said that the area may be expanded up to an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>he was,</b> in fact, <b>speaking of</b> the area of <b>the cistern without</b> that which is enclosed by <b>the</b> upright <b>boards.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, that is</b> exactly what <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> said. The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical halakhic difference <b>between them</b> in a case where the enclosed area is <b>long and narrow.</b> Rabbi Yehuda permits using it, whereas Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar requires that the area be square.

### Part 17
The Gemara adds: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar stated a principle:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> enclosed <b>space that is used as a dwelling, such as a pen, a stable, a backyard, or a courtyard,</b> even if it lacks a roof and <b>even</b> if the structure has the area of <b>five <i>beit kor</i> and</b> even <b>ten <i>beit kor</i>, it is permitted</b> to carry in it.

### Part 18
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>any dwelling that is used for the space</b> outside it, i.e., whose partitions were arranged not so that it could be lived in, but for the sake of the field or yard outside, <b>such as field huts,</b> if its area was <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>, it is permitted</b> to carry in it; but if its area was <b>more than two <i>beit se’a</i>, it is prohibited</b> to do so.

### Part 19
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If the path of the public domain passes through</b> the area of the upright boards surrounding a well <b>and obstructs it, one must divert</b> the path <b>to the sides,</b> so that the public will circumvent the enclosed area; otherwise, the partition is invalid and the enclosed area cannot be regarded as a private domain. <b>And the Rabbis say: One need not</b> divert the path of the public domain, for the partition is valid even if many people pass through it.

### Part 20
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both said: Here,</b> the Rabbis <b>informed you of the strength of partitions;</b> although a path of the public domain passes through the partitions and the partitions do not constitute effective barriers, they are still strong enough to allow one to carry.

### Part 21
The Gemara wishes to clarify the meaning of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: Did he mean <b>here</b> that the Rabbis expressed this idea, <b>and he agrees</b> with them that a public thoroughfare does not invalidate a partition? <b>Didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>Jerusalem,</b> even though it is walled, <b>were it not for the fact that its doors are locked at night, one would be liable for</b> carrying in <b>it</b> on Shabbat <b>because</b> its thoroughfares are regarded <b>as the public domain?</b> Apparently, Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that a partition is not strong enough to overcome the passage of many people.

### Part 22
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement must be understood as follows: <b>Here,</b> the Rabbis expressed this idea, although <b>he does not agree</b> with them.

### Part 23
The Gemara <b>raised a contradiction between</b> this statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> and another statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and raised a contradiction</b> between this statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> and another statement of <b>the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 24
The other statements are <b>as it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> If <b>one had two houses on the two sides of the public domain,</b> and he wishes to carry from one house to the other on Shabbat via the public domain, <b>he may place a side post from here,</b> perpendicular to the public domain, <b>and</b> an additional <b>side post from here,</b> on the other side of the public domain, <b>or</b> he may place a cross <b>beam from here,</b> from one end of one house to the end of the house opposite it, <b>and</b> another cross <b>beam from here,</b> from the other side of the house, <b>and carry</b> objects <b>and place</b> them <b>in</b> the area <b>between them</b> because the two added partitions turn the area in the middle into a private domain. The Rabbis <b>said to him: One cannot make the public domain fit</b> for carrying <b>by</b> means of <b>an <i>eiruv</i> in this manner,</b> i.e., by means of a side post alone, when many people continue to walk through the public thoroughfare in the middle.

### Part 25
Consequently, there is <b>a contradiction between</b> one statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and</b> the other statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and there is also <b>a contradiction between</b> one statement of <b>the Rabbis and</b> the other statement of <b>the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 26
The Gemara answers: Between one statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and</b> the other statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> there is <b>no contradiction,</b> because one can differentiate between them. <b>There,</b> in the case of the two houses, <b>there are two proper partitions,</b> for the houses are real partitions, and two partitions suffice to establish a separate domain. However, <b>here,</b> in the case of the upright boards, <b>there are not two proper partitions,</b> for the upright boards are not real partitions.

### Part 27
Between one statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> and the other statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> there is <b>also no contradiction,</b> as <b>here,</b> with regard to the upright boards, <b>there is a nominal</b> set <b>of four partitions;</b> on all four sides side there are at least two cubits of some form of partition, so the cistern is regarded as enclosed by four partitions. However, <b>there,</b> with regard to the two houses, <b>there is not a nominal</b> set <b>of four partitions.</b>

### Part 28
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Yosef said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> In <b>Eretz Yisrael one is not liable for</b> carrying in <b>the public domain. Rav Dimi sat and recited this <i>halakha</i>. Abaye said to Rav Dimi: What is the reason</b> underlying this ruling?
