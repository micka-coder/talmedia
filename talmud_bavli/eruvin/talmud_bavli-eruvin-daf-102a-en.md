### Part 1
it is <b>in</b> a case <b>where it cannot be picked up by its rope,</b> as it is too thin to bear the weight of the bolt. <b>As</b> this <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, <b>maintains: Since it has a knob at its end, it has the status of a vessel,</b> and one is therefore permitted to secure the door with it. <b>And</b> this <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>maintains: Since it cannot be picked up by its rope, no,</b> it is not considered a proper vessel merely because of the knob, and consequently, its use is prohibited on Shabbat.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a bolt that</b> is attached to the door, but owing to the length of the rope, it does not hang from the door but <b>drags</b> along the ground, <b>one</b> may <b>lock</b> a door <b>with it in the Temple</b> on Shabbat, as this is prohibited only by rabbinic decree, issued to enhance the character of Shabbat as a day of rest, and rabbinic decrees are not in effect in the Temple. <b>However,</b> one may <b>not</b> lock a door with this bolt <b>in the country</b> outside the Temple.

### Part 3
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>one that</b> is not tied at all but <b>rests</b> entirely on the ground, it <b>is prohibited in both</b> places, in and outside the Temple, as the use of this bolt is considered building. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One that rests</b> entirely on the ground <b>is permitted in the Temple, and one that drags</b> along the ground is permitted even <b>in</b> the rest of <b>the country.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which is the bolt that drags</b> along the ground <b>with which one</b> may <b>lock</b> a door on Shabbat <b>in the Temple but not in the</b> rest of the <b>country? Any that is tied</b> to the door <b>and suspended</b> from it, <b>while one end</b> of the bolt <b>reaches the ground. Rabbi Yehuda says: This</b> type of bolt <b>is permitted even in</b> the rest of <b>the country. Rather, which is</b> the <b>bolt with which one</b> may <b>lock</b> a door <b>in the Temple but not in</b> the rest of <b>the country? Any that is neither tied</b> to the door <b>nor suspended</b> from it, <b>but which one removes</b> after use <b>and places in a corner.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to</b> a bolt <b>that is dragged.</b> It is permitted to use this bolt on Shabbat even outside the Temple, but it is prohibited to use a bolt that rests on the ground, even in the Temple.

### Part 6
<b>Rava said: And that is</b> the case only <b>if</b> the bolt <b>is tied to the door</b> itself. The Gemara is surprised by this ruling: <b>Is that</b> really <b>so? But didn’t Rabbi Tavla happen</b> to come <b>to Meḥoza and he saw a certain</b> bolt <b>that was suspended from the side of the door, and he did not say anything to</b> the people there with regard to a prohibition? The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>That</b> bolt <b>was one that could be picked up by its rope.</b> Everyone agrees that a bolt of this kind may be used for locking a door on Shabbat even if it is not tied to the door itself.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Avya</b> once <b>happened</b> to come <b>to Neharde’a</b> and <b>saw a certain person tying</b> a bolt to a door <b>with a reed. He said: This</b> door may <b>not be locked</b> on Shabbat, as the bolt is not adequately fastened to it.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Zeira raised</b> the following <b>dilemma:</b> If the bolt <b>was pressed</b> into the ground through a hole in the threshold, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the use of this bolt considered building? <b>Rav Yosef said: What is</b> Rabbi Zeira’s <b>dilemma?</b> Has <b>he not heard that which was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: If the bolt <b>was</b> altogether <b>detached</b> from the rope to which it had been tied, <b>it is prohibited;</b> but <b>if it was pressed</b> into the ground, <b>it is permitted; and Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> If it <b>was pressed</b> into the ground, <b>even though it was not</b> entirely <b>detached</b> from its rope, <b>it is prohibited?</b>

### Part 9
<b>And Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to</b> a bolt <b>that was pressed</b> into the ground. The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that the Sages prohibited the use of a bolt <b>that was pressed</b> into the ground? <b>Abaye said:</b> They prohibited its use <b>because it appears like building,</b> as the bolt enters all the way into the ground.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Neḥumei bar Zekharya raised a dilemma before Abaye:</b> If <b>one produced a handle for</b> the bolt in order to hold it, but it was not tied to the door, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Abaye <b>said to him: A pestle, you say?</b> If it has a handle it is a proper utensil, which may be freely used according to all opinions. This teaching <b>was stated</b> also in the form of a direct statement: <b>Rav Neḥumei bar Adda said:</b> If <b>he produced a handle for</b> the bolt, <b>it is permitted.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara relates that <b>there was a certain</b> cross <b>beam in the house of Rabbi Pedat that</b> was so heavy it took <b>ten</b> people <b>to lift it, and they would place it against the door</b> at night in order to secure it. <b>And</b> Rabbi Pedat <b>did not say anything to them</b> with regard to a possible prohibition. <b>He said:</b> I permit it because <b>it has the status of a utensil.</b> It appears like a utensil and it serves a distinct purpose; therefore, it may be used on Shabbat.

### Part 12
The Gemara further relates that <b>there was a certain mortar in the house of Mar Shmuel that had a capacity of an <i>adriva</i>,</b> which is equal to half a <i>kor</i>. <b>Mar Shmuel permitted</b> them <b>to place it against the door</b> to secure it. He <b>said: It</b> falls into the halakhic <b>category of a utensil,</b> and it may therefore be used to secure the door, as this is not regarded as building.

### Part 13
<b>Rami bar Yeḥezkel sent</b> a request <b>to Rav Amram: Let the Master tell us</b> some <b>of those outstanding matters that you told us in the name of Rav Asi</b> with regard to <b>the arches of a boat</b> upon which mats are draped as protection against the elements. Rav Amram <b>sent</b> back <b>to him</b> that <b>Rav Asi said as follows:</b> With regard to <b>the arches of a boat, when they are a handbreadth</b> wide, or <b>even if they are not a handbreadth</b> wide <b>but there is less than three</b> handbreadths <b>between them,</b> in which case the intervening space is regarded as filled in based on the principle of <i>lavud</i>, <b>on the following day,</b> i.e., on Shabbat, <b>one</b> may <b>bring a mat and spread</b> it <b>over them.</b>

### Part 14
<b>What is the reason</b> for this leniency? The reason is that <b>this is</b> considered <b>adding to a temporary tent,</b> and therefore one may <b>well</b> spread a mat over the arches. They themselves constitute a tent. Therefore, one who spreads a mat over them is merely adding to the temporary tent.

### Part 15
The Gemara further relates that <b>Rav Huna had certain rams that required shade during the day and required air at night.</b> He therefore sought a way for the pen to be covered by day but not at night, even on Shabbat. <b>He came before Rav</b> to seek his advice.

### Part 16
Rav <b>said to him: Go, roll up</b> the <b>mats [<i>budeya</i>]</b> that were spread out there for shade, but <b>leave</b> one <b>handbreadth</b> covered. <b>On the following day, unroll</b> the entire mat, which is considered <b>adding to a temporary tent</b> and <b>which is permitted.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Rav said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya:</b> With regard to <b>a curtain</b> put up for privacy, <b>one is permitted to spread it out, and one is</b> also <b>permitted to dismantle it on Shabbat.</b> As it is not a tent but merely a temporary wall, akin to a door, one does not violate a prohibition if it is not fixed firmly in place.

### Part 18
With regard to <b>a bridal canopy,</b> a curtain that is suspended over a bed and inclines outward in both directions, <b>it is permitted</b> both <b>to dismantle it and to spread it on Shabbat. Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, said: We said</b> that this is permitted <b>only where</b> the curtain extends over the bed and falls on both sides in such a manner that <b>the top</b> of the curtain, the apex of the canopy, <b>is less than a handbreadth</b> wide. <b>However, if its top is a handbreadth</b> wide, i.e., if the curtain does not rise to a sharp point but extends horizontally for a handbreadth, after which it falls to the side, this handbreadth is regarded as a tent and is therefore <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 19
<b>And</b> even <b>where its</b> horizontal <b>top is not a handbreadth</b> wide, <b>we said</b> this leniency <b>only if</b> its width <b>is less than a handbreadth within three</b> handbreadths <b>from</b> its <b>top. However, if</b> its width <b>is a handbreadth within three</b> handbreadths <b>from</b> its <b>top,</b> this handbreadth is considered a tent and it is therefore <b>prohibited</b> to spread it on Shabbat.

### Part 20
And even <b>where it is less than a handbreadth</b> wide <b>within three</b> handbreadths <b>of</b> its <b>top, we said</b> this leniency <b>only where</b>
