### Part 1
<b>a person does not merit to learn from everyone,</b> and it is possible that the only suitable teacher for him lives outside of Eretz Yisrael. <b>And Rabbi Yosei reported</b> in support of his position: <b>It once happened that Yosef the priest went to his teacher in Tzeidan,</b> outside Eretz Yisrael, <b>to learn Torah,</b> although the preeminent Sage of his generation, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, lived in Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 2
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> about this: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> was it necessary for Rabbi Yoḥanan to issue this ruling? <b>Didn’t you say:</b> In disputes between <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> and so it should be obvious that this <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his opinion? Apparently, this principle is not accepted.

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said: It was</b> nonetheless <b>necessary</b> to issue this ruling, <b>it</b> could have <b>entered your mind to say</b> that <b>this</b> principle <b>applies</b> only with regard to disputes <b>in the Mishna. But</b> with regard to disputes <b>in a <i>baraita</i>, say no,</b> the principle does not apply. Therefore, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>is teaching us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei in this case as well.

### Part 4
Since no proof has been found to support Rav Mesharshiya’s statement that there are no principles for issuing halakhic rulings, the Gemara emends his statement. <b>Rather, this</b> is what Rav Mesharshiya <b>is saying: These principles were not accepted by all</b> authorities, <b>as</b> in fact <b>Rav did not accept these principles,</b> as demonstrated above.

### Part 5
The Gemara returns to addressing acquisition of residence. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Objects belonging to a gentile do not acquire residence</b> and do not have a Shabbat limit, either on their own account or due to the ownership of the gentile. Accordingly, if they were brought into a town from outside its limits, a Jew may carry them two thousand cubits in each direction.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion was this statement made? <b>If you say</b> that it was made <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> it is <b>obvious. Now,</b> if <b>unclaimed objects, which do not have owners, do not acquire residence, is it necessary</b> to say that <b>a gentile’s objects, which have an owner,</b> do not acquire residence?

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> this statement must have been made <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, and</b> Shmuel <b>is teaching us</b> that when we <b>say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri said</b> that objects <b>acquire residence, this applies only</b> to <b>unclaimed objects, which have no owners; but</b> it does <b>not</b> apply to <b>objects</b> belonging <b>to a gentile, which have owners.</b>

### Part 8
<b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> With regard to a Jew <b>who borrowed a utensil from a gentile on a Festival, and similarly</b> with regard to a Jew <b>who lent a utensil to a gentile on the eve of a Festival and</b> the gentile <b>returned it to him on the Festival, and</b> likewise <b>utensils or bins that acquired residence within the</b> city’s Shabbat <b>limit,</b> in all these cases the utensils <b>have,</b> i.e., can be moved, <b>two thousand cubits in each direction. But if a gentile brought</b> the Jew <b>produce from outside</b> the Shabbat <b>limit,</b> the Jew <b>may not move it from its place.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Granted if you say that Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri holds</b> that <b>objects that belong to a gentile acquire residence,</b> one can say that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion? <b>It</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri,</b> that even a gentile’s objects acquire residence.

### Part 10
<b>However, if you say that Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri holds</b> that <b>objects belonging to a gentile do not acquire residence,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>? It is <b>neither</b> in accordance with that of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri nor</b> that of <b>the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> say that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri holds</b> that <b>a gentile’s objects acquire residence,</b> and that <b>Shmuel,</b> who said that they do not acquire residence, <b>spoke in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. And</b> with regard to <b>that which you said,</b> that <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that a gentile’s objects do not acquire residence, so this ruling need not have been stated at all. The Gemara answers: That is incorrect, as <b>you might have said</b> that the Sages should issue a <b>decree</b> in the case of <b>gentile owners</b> that his objects acquire residence in his location and that they may not be carried beyond two thousand cubits from that spot, lest people carry objects belonging to <b>a Jewish owners</b> beyond their two-thousand-cubit limit. Therefore, it <b>is teaching us</b> that no decree was issued.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin,</b> however, <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Objects that belong to a gentile</b> indeed <b>acquire residence,</b> due to the aforementioned <b>decree</b> issued in the case of <b>gentile owners due to</b> the case of <b>Jewish owners.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara relates that <b>certain rams were brought to</b> the town of <b>Mavrakhta</b> on Shabbat. <b>Rava permitted the residents of Meḥoza to purchase them</b> and take them home, although Mavrakhta was outside the Shabbat limit of Meḥoza and could be reached by the residents of Meḥoza only by way of an <i>eiruv</i> of Shabbat limits.

### Part 14
<b>Ravina said to Rava: What is your reasoning</b> in permitting these rams? You must rely upon that which <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Objects belonging to a gentile do not acquire residence,</b> and so they are permitted even if they were brought to Meḥoza from outside the Shabbat limit.

### Part 15
<b>Isn’t</b> the principle, in disputes between <b>Shmuel and Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan? And Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin</b> already <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Objects that belong to a gentile acquire residence,</b> based on <b>a decree</b> in the case of <b>a gentile owner, due to</b> the case of <b>a Jewish owner.</b> The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his opinion.

### Part 16
<b>Rava reconsidered and said: Let</b> the rams <b>be sold</b> only <b>to the residents of Mavrakhta.</b> Although the rams acquired residence, and may be moved only four cubits as they were taken beyond their Shabbat limit, the legal status of <b>all Mavrakhta is like four cubits for them.</b> However, they may not be sold to the residents of Meḥoza, as the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan.

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A water-filled ditch [<i>ḥerem</i>] that</b> lies <b>between</b> two <b>Shabbat limits requires</b>
