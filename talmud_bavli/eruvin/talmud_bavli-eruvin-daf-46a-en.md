### Part 1
The Gemara raises a difficulty: If the water was previously not in its current state, <b>all the more so should it be</b> considered as something that <b>came into being [<i>nolad</i>]</b> on the Festival, and consequently it is <b>prohibited</b> to carry it. Something that came into being or assumed its present form on Shabbat or Festivals is considered set-aside [<i>muktze</i>] and may not be handled on Shabbat or Festivals.

### Part 2
<b>Rather,</b> we should say: <b>The water in clouds</b> is <b>in</b> constant <b>motion</b> and therefore does not acquire residence there. The Gemara comments: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> answer, <b>the ocean should also not be difficult for you,</b> as the <b>water in the ocean is also in</b> constant <b>motion. And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Flowing rivers and streaming springs are like the feet of all people,</b> as their waters do not acquire residence in any particular place. The same law also applies to clouds and seas.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri,</b> that one who was asleep at the beginning of Shabbat may travel two thousand cubits in every direction. <b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi:</b> Did <b>you hear</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>explicitly</b> from Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, <b>or did you understand it by inference</b> from some other ruling that he issued? Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi <b>said to him: I heard</b> it <b>explicitly</b> from him.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: From <b>what</b> other teaching could this ruling <b>be inferred?</b> The Gemara explains: From that <b>which Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the lenient</b> opinion <b>with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I need both?</b> Why was it necessary for Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to state both the general ruling that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the lenient opinion with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>, and also the specific ruling that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri on this issue?

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Both rulings <b>were necessary, as had he informed us</b> only that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, I would have said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with him <b>whether this is a leniency,</b> i.e., that a sleeping person acquires residence and may walk two thousand cubits in every direction, <b>or</b> whether <b>it is a stringency,</b> i.e., that ownerless utensils acquire residence and can be carried only two thousand cubits from that place. <b>Consequently, he teaches us</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the lenient</b> opinion <b>with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> so that we rule in accordance with Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri only when it entails a leniency.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Let him state</b> only that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the lenient</b> opinion <b>with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>. Why do I need</b> the statement that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri?</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: This ruling <b>was necessary</b> as well, for had he informed us only that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the lenient opinion with regard to an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>it might have entered your mind to say</b> that <b>this statement applies only</b> to disputes in which <b>a single</b> authority disagrees <b>with</b> another <b>single</b> authority, <b>or several</b> authorities disagree with <b>several</b> other authorities. <b>But</b> when <b>a single</b> authority maintains a lenient opinion against <b>several</b> authorities who maintain a more stringent position, you might have <b>said</b> that we do <b>not</b> rule in his favor. Hence, it was necessary to state that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri although he disputes the Rabbis.

### Part 9
<b>Rava said to Abaye: Now, since</b> the laws of <b><i>eiruvin</i> are rabbinic</b> in origin, <b>what</b> reason is there for <b>me</b> to differentiate between a disagreement of <b>a single</b> authority <b>with a single</b> authority and a disagreement of <b>a single</b> authority <b>with several</b> authorities?

### Part 10
<b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: Is there no difference with regard to rabbinic</b> laws <b>between</b> a disagreement of <b>a single</b> authority <b>with a single</b> authority, <b>and</b> a disagreement of <b>a single</b> authority with <b>several</b> authorities?

### Part 11
<b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Any woman who passed three</b> expected menstrual <b>cycles</b> without experiencing bleeding is presumed not to be menstruating. If afterward she sees blood, <b>it is enough</b> that she be regarded as ritually impure due to menstruation <b>from the time</b> that she examined herself and saw that she had a discharge, rather than retroactively for up to twenty-four hours. The Rabbis, however, maintain that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to an older woman or to a woman after childbirth, for whom it is natural to stop menstruating, but not to a normal young woman for whom three periods have passed without bleeding.

### Part 12
<b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It once happened that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>ruled</b> that the <i>halakha</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar. After he remembered</b> that Rabbi Elazar’s colleagues disagree with him on this matter and that he had apparently ruled incorrectly, <b>he</b> nonetheless <b>said: Rabbi Elazar is worthy to rely upon in exigent circumstances.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara comments: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>After he remembered? If you say</b> that it means <b>after he remembered</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar but</b> rather <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> then <b>how could he rule in accordance with him</b> even <b>in exigent circumstances,</b> given that the <i>halakha</i> had been decided against him?

### Part 14
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> had <b>not been stated</b> on this matter, <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, nor in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. And after he remembered that it was not a single</b> authority who <b>disagreed with</b> Rabbi Elazar, <b>but</b> rather <b>several</b> authorities who <b>disagreed with him, he</b> nonetheless <b>said: Rabbi Elazar is worthy to rely upon in exigent circumstances.</b> This demonstrates that even with a dispute that involves a rabbinic decree, such as whether a woman is declared ritually impure retroactively, there is room to distinguish between a disagreement of a single authority and a single authority, and a disagreement of a single authority and several authorities.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Mesharshiya said to Rava, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> who said <b>to Rava: Is there no difference with regard to rabbinic</b> laws <b>between</b> a disagreement of <b>a single</b> authority <b>with a single</b> authority, <b>and</b> a disagreement of <b>a single</b> authority <b>with several</b> authorities?

### Part 16
<b>Wasn’t it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a person receives <b>a proximate report</b> that one of his close relatives has died, <b>he practices</b> all the customs of the intense <b>seven</b> day mourning period as well as the customs of the <b>thirty</b> day mourning period. But if he receives <b>a distant</b> report, <b>he practices</b> only <b>one day</b> of mourning.

### Part 17
<b>What is</b> considered a <b>proximate</b> report, <b>and what is</b> considered a <b>distant</b> report? If the report arrives <b>within thirty</b> days of the close relative’s passing, it is regarded as <b>proximate,</b> and if it arrives <b>after thirty</b> days it is considered <b>distant;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. But the Rabbis say: Both</b> in the case of <b>a proximate report and</b> in the case of <b>a distant report,</b> the grieving relative <b>practices</b> the <b>seven-</b>day mourning period <b>and</b> the <b>thirty-</b>day mourning period.

### Part 18
<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Wherever you find</b> that <b>a single</b> authority <b>is lenient</b> with regard to a certain <i>halakha</i> <b>and several</b> other authorities <b>are stringent, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the words of the stringent</b> authorities, who constitute <b>the majority, except for here, where despite</b> the fact that the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva is lenient and the</b> opinion of the <b>Rabbis is</b> more <b>stringent, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 19
<b>And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>holds like Shmuel, as Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the lenient</b> opinion <b>with</b> regard to <b>mourning</b> practices, i.e., wherever there is a dispute with regard to mourning customs, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the lenient opinion.

### Part 20
From here the Gemara infers: <b>It is</b> only <b>with regard to mourning</b> practices <b>that the Sages were lenient, but in general,</b> with regard to other areas of <i>halakha</i>, <b>even in the case of rabbinic</b> laws <b>there is a difference</b> between a disagreement of <b>a single</b> authority <b>with a single</b> authority and a disagreement of <b>a single</b> authority <b>with several</b> authorities. This being the case, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi did well to rule explicitly that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, even though he is a single authority who ruled leniently in dispute with the Rabbis.
