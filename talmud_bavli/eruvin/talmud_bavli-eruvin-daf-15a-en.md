### Part 1
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about <b>a side post that stands by itself,</b> i.e., a side post at the entrance to an alleyway that was not put there for the express purpose of permitting one to carry on Shabbat. <b>Abaye said: It is a</b> valid <b>side post. Rava said: It is not a</b> valid <b>side post.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara first narrows the scope of the dispute: In a place <b>where</b> the inhabitants of the alleyway <b>did not rely on it from yesterday,</b> e.g., the alleyway had another side post that fell down on Shabbat, <b>all agree that it is not a</b> valid <b>side post. Where they disagree is</b> in a case <b>where they relied on it from yesterday. Abaye said: It is a</b> valid <b>side post, as they relied on it from yesterday. Rava said: It is not a</b> valid <b>side post; since it was not originally erected for this purpose, it is not</b> considered <b>a</b> valid <b>side post.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: It might <b>enter your mind</b> to say that <b>just as they disagree with regard to a side post, they also disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>a partition</b> that was not erected to serve that function is considered a valid partition.

### Part 4
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof based upon what we learned in the following mishna: With regard to <b>one who makes his <i>sukka</i> among the trees, and the trees serve as its walls, it is</b> a <b>valid</b> <i>sukka</i>. This proves that the trees function as partitions even though they were not erected for this purpose. The Gemara responds: <b>With what are we dealing here,</b> in this mishna? To a case <b>where he planted</b> the trees <b>from the outset for this</b> purpose. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the trees constitute valid walls. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> the Sages <b>should issue a</b> decree to prohibit using a <i>sukka</i> with trees as its walls, due to a concern that <b>perhaps one will come to use the tree</b> on the Festival and detach a branch or leaf in the process, the mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that no such decree was made and the <i>sukka</i> is permitted.

### Part 5
The Gemara tries to present another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>there was a tree there, or a fence, or a barrier of reeds</b> that are interconnected and form a hedge, <b>it is judged</b> to be <b>a</b> valid <b>double post,</b> i.e., it qualifies as a partition suitable to enclose a public well, as will be explained below. This indicates that a partition not constructed to serve as a partition is nonetheless valid.

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Here, too, with what are we dealing?</b> With a case <b>where one constructed them from the outset for this</b> purpose. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what does it teach us;</b> is it not obvious that it is a valid double post? The Gemara answers: <b>It teaches us</b> that <b>a barrier of reeds</b> is a valid partition if the distance between <b>one reed and the next is less than three handbreadths, as Abaye raised</b> this <b>dilemma to Rabba,</b> and the <i>baraita</i> teaches that it is valid.

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following mishna: With regard to <b>a tree</b> whose branches <b>hang over</b> from a height of greater than ten handbreadths and reach almost to <b>the ground, if</b> the ends of <b>its branches are not higher than three handbreadths from the ground, one may carry under it;</b> the branches constitute partitions all around, and it is therefore permissible to carry in the enclosed area. The Gemara responds: <b>Here, too, with what are we dealing?</b> With a case <b>where he planted</b> the tree <b>from the outset for this</b> purpose.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, it should</b> be permitted to <b>carry in all of it</b> no matter how large the area. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>did Rav Huna, the son of Rav Yehoshua, say: One may only carry</b> under the tree if its branches enclose an area no larger than <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> i.e., five thousand square cubits? If the area is larger, it is not considered a courtyard, and carrying there is prohibited. This indicates that the branches are not considered full-fledged partitions.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: The reason that carrying is permitted only if the enclosed area is less than this size is <b>because it is a dwelling whose use is for</b> the open <b>air</b> beyond it, i.e., it is used by guards who are watching the fields beyond it, rather than as an independent dwelling place, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>any dwelling whose use is for</b> the open <b>air</b> beyond it is that <b>one may carry in it only if</b> its area is no larger than <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara suggests another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one</b> who <b>established his Shabbat</b> abode <b>on a mound that was ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and</b> its area was anywhere <b>from four cubits to</b> the <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>; and similarly,</b> one who established his Shabbat abode <b>in a</b> natural <b>cavity</b> of a rock <b>that is ten</b> handbreadths <b>deep and</b> its area was anywhere <b>from four cubits to two <i>beit se’a</i>;</b> and similarly, one who established his Shabbat abode in a field of <b>reaped grain, and</b> rows of <b>stalks</b> ten handbreadths high that have not been reaped <b>surround it,</b> serving as a partition enclosing the reaped area, <b>he may walk in the entire</b> enclosed area, <b>and outside it</b> an additional <b>two thousand cubits.</b> This indicates that a partition not specifically constructed to serve as a partition is nonetheless valid.

### Part 11
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>here, too,</b> it is a case <b>where he made it from the outset for this</b> purpose, there is a difficulty. <b>Granted,</b> in the case of the <b>grain,</b> this answer is <b>all right; but</b> with regard to <b>a mound and a cavity, what can be said?</b> They were there from time immemorial and were not constructed to serve as partitions.

### Part 12
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara rejects its previous argument and explains: <b>With regard to partitions, all agree that</b> a partition that stands by itself <b>is a partition,</b> despite the fact that it was not erected for that purpose. <b>Where they disagree</b> is <b>with regard to a side post. Abaye follows his</b> usual line of <b>reasoning, as he said</b> that <b>a side post</b> serves <b>as a partition, and a partition that stands by itself is a</b> valid <b>partition. And Rava follows his</b> usual line of <b>reasoning, as he said</b> that <b>a side post</b> serves <b>as a conspicuous marker.</b> Therefore, <b>if it was made with</b> a person’s <b>hands</b> for that purpose, <b>it is</b> considered <b>a conspicuous marker; and if not, it is not</b> considered <b>a conspicuous marker.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara now attempts to prove which side is correct according to this version of the dispute. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the <i>Tosefta</i>: With regard to <b>stones of a wall that protrude from the wall</b> and are <b>separated from each other</b> by <b>less than three</b> handbreadths, <b>there is no need for another side post</b> in order to permit carrying in the alleyway; the protruding stones join together to form a side post. However, if they are separated by <b>three</b> handbreadths, <b>there is a need for another side post.</b> This indicates that a side post is valid even if it was not erected for that purpose.

### Part 14
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Here, too,</b> we are dealing with a case <b>where one built them from the outset for this</b> purpose. The Gemara comments: <b>If so, it is obvious</b> that the side post is valid. The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that it was only <b>in order to connect the building</b> to another building that <b>he built</b> the wall with protruding stones, <b>it teaches us</b> that it is a valid side post. We are not concerned that onlookers might assume that the wall was not originally built as a side post.

### Part 15
The Gemara suggests another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following <i>Tosefta</i> <b>taught by Rabbi Ḥiyya: A wall, one side of which is more recessed than the other, whether</b> the indentation <b>is visible from the outside and</b> the wall looks <b>even from the inside, or</b> it <b>is visible from the inside and</b> the wall looks <b>even from the outside, it is considered a side post.</b> This indicates that a side post is valid even if it was not erected for that purpose.

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: <b>Here, too,</b> it is a case <b>where one fashioned it from the outset for this</b> purpose, to serve as a side post. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what does it teach us?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us</b> that a side post that <b>is visible from the outside and</b> looks <b>even</b> with the wall <b>from the inside is considered a side post,</b> although this view is not universally accepted.

### Part 17
The Gemara suggests another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following story: <b>Rav was sitting in a certain alleyway,</b> and <b>Rav Huna was sitting before him. He said to his attendant: Go, bring me a</b> small <b>pitcher of water. By the time he came</b> back with the water, <b>the side post</b> at the entrance to the alleyway <b>had fallen.</b> Rav <b>signaled to him with his hand</b> that he should stop, and the attendant <b>stood in his place. Rav Huna said to</b> Rav: <b>Doesn’t the Master hold</b> that it is permissible <b>to rely on the palm tree</b> located at the entrance to this alleyway as a side post? Rav <b>said: This scholar,</b> Rav Huna, <b>is comparable to one who does not know the teachings</b> of the Sages. <b>Did we rely on</b> the palm tree <b>from yesterday?</b> Since we did not, carrying in the alleyway is not permitted.

### Part 18
Based on Rav’s response, the Gemara argues as follows: <b>The reason</b> that the palm tree could not serve as a side post is <b>because we did not rely</b> on the palm tree from yesterday. This indicates that <b>had we relied</b> on it, <b>it would be a</b> valid <b>side post,</b> thus proving that a side post that was not erected for that purpose is nonetheless valid, in accordance with the opinion of Abaye.

### Part 19
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Abaye and Rava disagree</b> only in a case <b>where they did not rely on it</b> before Shabbat, but in a case <b>where they did rely on it,</b> all agree <b>it is a</b> valid <b>side post?</b> The Gemara answers: This <b>should not enter your mind, as there was a certain balcony [<i>barka</i>] that was in the house of Bar Ḥavu that Abaye and Rava disagreed about their entire lives.</b> The residents of the alleyway began relying on a pillar upon which the balcony rested as their side post. Since Abaye and Rava disagreed about this case, it is clear that their disagreement applies even when the residents had relied on the item as a side post from before Shabbat.

### Part 20
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may construct side posts from anything, even a living creature,</b> provided that it was properly attached to the entrance of the alleyway, <b>and Rabbi Meir prohibits</b> using a living creature as a side post. The mishna continues with a similar dispute: Even a living creature <b>imparts ritual impurity</b> if it used as the <b>covering of a grave.</b>
