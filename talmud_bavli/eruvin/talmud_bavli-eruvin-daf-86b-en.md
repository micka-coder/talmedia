### Part 1
A cross <b>beam of four</b> handbreadths laid across a cistern located between two courtyards <b>permits</b> one to draw <b>water</b> from that cistern.

### Part 2
With this in mind, the following difficulty arises: The <b>bucket</b> he uses to draw the water <b>might drift</b> under the cross <b>beam to the other side</b> of the cistern <b>and bring</b> water from the other courtyard. The Gemara answers: <b>The Sages have established that a bucket does not drift more than four handbreadths</b> from the point where it was lowered, and it will therefore stay on its original side of the partition.

### Part 3
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Nonetheless, the water becomes intermingled under the</b> cross <b>beam,</b> and consequently the bucket will bring up water from the other courtyard. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that the reason for the leniency is not that the cross beam actually prevents the flow of the water, but <b>because the Sages were lenient with regard to water.</b> They allowed a partition suspended above the water to be considered as though it blocked the flow of the water. <b>As Rav Tavla asked of Rav:</b> With regard to <b>a suspended partition, does it permit</b> carrying <b>in a ruin?</b> Do we say that the remnants of the walls suspended in the air are considered as though they descended to the ground and closed off the area, thereby rendering it a private domain? Rav <b>said to him: A suspended partition</b> of this kind <b>permits</b> carrying <b>only</b> in the case <b>of water,</b> as <b>the Sages were lenient with regard to water.</b>

### Part 4
The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There is no need for a partition in the cistern, as <b>a partition</b> inside a cistern <b>is no</b> better than the wall above it. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Yehuda stated this in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, who said: A suspended partition permits</b> carrying <b>even on land,</b> as it is considered as though it descended to the ground and sealed off the area. Accordingly, there is no need to erect a partition inside the airspace of a cistern.

### Part 5
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One who lowers</b> <i>sukka</i> <b>walls from above</b> going <b>downward, when</b> the walls <b>are three handbreadths higher than the ground,</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>is invalid,</b> as they are not considered partitions; but if he constructed walls <b>from below</b> going <b>upward, if they are ten handbreadths high</b> the <i>sukka</i> <b>is valid,</b> even if they do not reach the roofing.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> however, <b>says: Just as</b> with regard to walls constructed <b>from below</b> going <b>upward, ten</b> handbreadths suffice, <b>so</b> too, in the case of walls built <b>from above</b> going <b>downward, ten</b> handbreadths are enough for it to be considered a whole wall, even if it more than three handbreadths above the ground. Similarly, Rabbi Yehuda maintains that a partition suspended above a cistern is considered as though it descended and sealed off the area.

### Part 7
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>But this is not so,</b> for we can distinguish between the two opinions and claim that <b>neither Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> in accordance <b>with Rabbi Yosei, nor does Rabbi Yosei hold</b> in accordance <b>with Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rabbi Yehuda does not</b> necessarily <b>hold</b> in accordance <b>with Rabbi Yosei,</b> as a distinction can be made between the two cases. <b>Rabbi Yehuda stated</b> his opinion <b>only with regard to the joining of courtyards,</b> which are required <b>by rabbinic law, but</b> in the case of <b>a <i>sukka</i>, which</b> is required <b>by Torah law, no,</b> he did not say that we can rely on suspended partitions.

### Part 9
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>Rabbi Yosei does not</b> necessarily <b>hold</b> in accordance <b>with Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as <b>Rabbi Yosei stated</b> his opinion <b>only with regard to a <i>sukka</i>,</b> which <b>is a prohibition</b> stated in the Torah <b>from a positive commandment.</b> The prohibition is not written as a negative commandment, but it can be inferred from a positive commandment. Neglect of the positive commandment of <i>sukka</i> is not punishable by the court, therefore we are not stringent in this regard. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat,</b> which is <b>a prohibition</b> punishable <b>by stoning,</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>did not state</b> his opinion. Consequently, Rabbi Yosei might agree that we must be very stringent with regard to all <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, even those that are rabbinic in origin.

### Part 10
<b>And if you ask: That incident, which occurred in Tzippori,</b> when they relied on suspended partitions on land for Shabbat, <b>on whose authority was it performed?</b> It was done <b>not on the authority of Rabbi Yosei, but</b> rather <b>it was performed on the authority of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> who maintains that a suspended partition renders it permitted to carry even if it is over land and even on Shabbat.

### Part 11
The incident transpired in the following manner. <b>As when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said:</b> It <b>once</b> happened that the people <b>forgot and did not bring a Torah scroll</b> to the synagogue on Friday <b>while it was still day,</b> which meant they were left without a scroll from which to read on Shabbat. <b>On the following day,</b> Shabbat, <b>they spread a sheet over the pillars</b> positioned between the house where the scroll was kept and the synagogue, thereby forming a corridor with partitions suspended on each side. <b>And</b> in this manner <b>they brought the Torah scroll</b> to the synagogue <b>and read from it.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara expresses surprise at the wording of this account: Did they actually <b>spread</b> sheets on Shabbat? <b>Is it permitted</b> to do so <b><i>ab initio</i>? But doesn’t everyone agree that one may not erect a temporary tent on Shabbat</b> <i>ab initio</i>? Spreading sheets over pillars is considered constructing a temporary tent.

### Part 13
<b>Rather,</b> what happened was that <b>they found sheets spread over the pillars,</b> which they used as partitions, <b>and</b> in this manner <b>they brought the Torah scroll</b> to the synagogue <b>and read from it.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rabba said: Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya said the same thing.</b> Both were very lenient with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of a partition over water. The ruling of <b>Rabbi Yehuda is that which we</b> just <b>said,</b> that the wall of the courtyard permits a cistern. The ruling of <b>Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya is as we learned: Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya says:</b> In the case of <b>a balcony that contains four cubits by four cubits,</b> which is suspended over water,
