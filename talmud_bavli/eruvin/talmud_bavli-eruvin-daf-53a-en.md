<b>and bridges and monuments</b> over graves <b>in which there is a residence, one extends the measure</b> of that side of the city as though there were other structures <b>opposite them</b> in the adjacent corner of the city. <b>And</b> prior to measuring the Shabbat limit, <b>one renders</b> the city <b>like a square tablet so that it gains the corners,</b> although there are actually no houses in those corners.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara cites a dispute with regard to the mishna’s terminology. <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed: <b>One taught</b> that the term in the mishna is <b><i>me’abberin</i>,</b> with the letter <i>ayin</i>, <b>and one taught</b> that the term in the mishna is <b><i>me’abberin</i>,</b> with the letter <i>alef</i>.

### Part 3
The Gemara explains: <b>The one who taught <i>me’abberin</i></b> with an <i>alef</i> explained the term in the sense of <b>limb</b> [<b><i>ever</i></b>] by <b>limb.</b> Determination of the city’s borders involves the addition of limbs to the core section of the city. <b>And the one who taught <i>me’abberin</i></b> with an <i>ayin</i> explained the term in the sense of <b>a pregnant woman</b> [<b><i>ubbera</i></b>] whose belly protrudes. In similar fashion, all the city’s protrusions are incorporated in its Shabbat limit.

### Part 4
Apropos this dispute, the Gemara cites similar disputes between Rav and Shmuel. With regard to <b>the Machpelah Cave,</b> in which the Patriarchs and Matriarchs are buried, <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed. <b>One said:</b> The cave consists of <b>two rooms, one</b> farther <b>in</b> than <b>the other. And one said:</b> It consists of <b>a room and</b> a second <b>story above it.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> this is understandable <b>according to the one who said</b> the cave consists of <b>one</b> room <b>above the other,</b> as <b>that is</b> the meaning of <b>Machpelah, double. However, according to the one who said</b> it consists of <b>two rooms, one</b> farther <b>in</b> than <b>the other,</b> in <b>what</b> sense is it <b>Machpelah?</b> Even ordinary houses contain two rooms.

### Part 6
Rather, it is called Machpelah in the sense <b>that it is doubled with</b> the Patriarchs and Matriarchs, who are buried there <b>in pairs.</b> This is similar to the homiletic interpretation of the alternative name for Hebron mentioned in the Torah: <b>“Mamre</b> of <b>Kiryat Ha’Arba,</b> which is Hebron” (Genesis 35:27). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> The city is called Kiryat Ha’Arba, the city of four, because it is <b>the city of the four couples</b> buried there: <b>Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca,</b> and <b>Jacob and Leah.</b>

### Part 7
They disagreed about this verse as well: <b>“And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel”</b> (Genesis 14:1). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> both identified Amraphel with Nimrod. However, <b>one said: Nimrod was his name. And why was his name called Amraphel?</b> It is a contraction of two Hebrew words: <b>As he said [<i>amar</i>]</b> the command <b>and cast [<i>hippil</i>] our father Abraham into the fiery furnace,</b> when Abraham rebelled against and challenged his proclaimed divinity. <b>And one said: Amraphel was his name. And why was his name called Nimrod? Because he caused the entire world to rebel [<i>himrid</i>]</b> against <b>God during his reign.</b>

### Part 8
They also disagreed about this verse: <b>“There arose a new king over Egypt,</b> who knew not Joseph” (Exodus 1:8). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed. <b>One said:</b> He was <b>actually</b> a <b>new</b> king, <b>and one said:</b> He was in fact the old king, but <b>his decrees were new.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara explains. <b>The one who said</b> he was <b>actually</b> a <b>new</b> king based his opinion on the fact <b>that it is written</b> in the verse that he was <b>new. And the one who said that his decrees were new</b> derived his opinion <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is not written: And</b> the king <b>died, and</b> his successor <b>reigned,</b> as it is written, for example, with regard to the kings of Edom (Genesis 36).

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who said that his decrees were new, isn’t it written: “Who knew not Joseph”?</b> If it were the same king, how could he not know Joseph? The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“Who knew not Joseph”?</b> It means <b>that he</b> conducted himself <b>like one who did not know Joseph at all.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara cites a <b>mnemonic</b> of key words from a series of traditions cited below: <b>Eighteen and twelve we studied, with regard to David, and he will understand.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I spent eighteen days with Rabbi Oshaya the Distinguished [<i>Beribbi</i>], and I learned from him only one matter in our Mishna.</b> In the phrase: <b>How does one extend cities,</b> the word <i>me’abberin</i> is spelled <b>with an <i>alef</i>.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this so? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Rabbi Oshaya the Distinguished had twelve students, and I spent eighteen days among them, and I learned the heart of each and every one,</b> i.e., the nature and character of each student, <b>and the</b> extent of the <b>wisdom of each and every one?</b> How could Rabbi Yoḥanan say that he learned only one matter?

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: It is possible that <b>he learned the heart of each and every one and the wisdom of each and every one,</b> but <b>he did not learn</b> substantive <b>tradition.</b> And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>From</b> the students <b>themselves he learned</b> many things; <b>from</b> Rabbi Oshaya <b>himself he did not learn</b> anything beyond that one matter. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: Rabbi Yoḥanan meant to <b>say</b> that he learned only one matter <b>in our Mishna</b> from Rabbi Oshaya, but he learned other matters from him based on <i>baraitot</i> and other sources.

### Part 15
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> about that period: <b>When we were studying Torah with Rabbi Oshaya,</b> it was so crowded with students that <b>we would sit four in each</b> square <b>cubit.</b> Similarly, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: When we were studying Torah with Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua, we would sit six in each</b> square <b>cubit.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> about his teacher: <b>Rabbi Oshaya the Distinguished</b> was as great <b>in his generation as Rabbi Meir</b> was <b>in his generation: Just as</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Meir, in his generation his colleagues were unable to fully grasp</b> the profundity of <b>his thinking</b> due to the subtlety of his great mind, <b>so</b> it was with <b>Rabbi Oshaya; his colleagues were unable to fully grasp</b> the profundity of <b>his thinking.</b>

### Part 17
Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The hearts,</b> i.e., the wisdom, <b>of</b> the <b>early</b> Sages were <b>like the doorway to the Entrance Hall</b> of the Temple, which was twenty by forty cubits, <b>and</b> the hearts <b>of</b> the <b>later</b> Sages <b>were like the doorway to the Sanctuary,</b> which was ten by twenty cubits. <b>And we,</b> i.e., our hearts, <b>are like</b> the <b>eye of a fine needle.</b>

### Part 18
He explains: The term <b>early</b> Sages is referring to <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> and the term <b>later</b> Sages is referring to his student, <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua. Some say</b> that the term <b>early</b> Sages refers to <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua</b> and that the term the <b>later</b> Sages refers to <b>Rabbi Oshaya the Distinguished. And we are like</b> the <b>eye of a fine needle.</b>

### Part 19
On the topic of the steady decline of the generations, <b>Abaye said: And we,</b> as far as our capabilities are concerned, <b>are like a peg in the wall with regard to</b> Torah <b>study.</b> Just as a peg enters a wall with difficulty, our studies penetrate our minds only with difficulty. <b>Rava said: And we are like a finger in wax [<i>kira</i>] with regard to logical reasoning.</b> A finger is not easily pushed into wax, and it extracts nothing from the wax. <b>Rav Ashi said: We are like a finger in a pit with regard to forgetfulness.</b> Just as a finger easily enters a large pit, similarly, we quickly forget our studies.

### Part 20
The Gemara continues the discussion relating to study and comprehension, and cites that which <b>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>the people of Judea, who were particular in their speech</b> and always made certain that it was both precise and refined, <b>their Torah</b> knowledge <b>endured for them;</b> with regard to <b>the people of the Galilee, who were not particular in their speech, their Torah</b> knowledge <b>did not endure for them.</b>

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> this <b>matter at all dependent on</b> being <b>particular</b> with one’s language? <b>Rather,</b> with regard to <b>the people of Judea, who were precise in their language and</b> who <b>would formulate mnemonics</b> for their studies, <b>their Torah</b> knowledge <b>endured for them;</b> with regard to <b>the people of the Galilee, who were not precise in their language and</b> who <b>would not formulate mnemonics, their Torah</b> knowledge <b>did not endure for them.</b>

### Part 22
Furthermore, with regard to <b>the people of Judea,</b> who <b>studied from one teacher, their Torah</b> knowledge <b>endured for them,</b> as their teacher provided them with a consistent approach; however, with regard to <b>the people of the Galilee, who did not study from one teacher,</b> but rather from several teachers, <b>their Torah</b> knowledge <b>did not endure for them,</b> as it was a combination of the approaches and opinions of a variety of Sages.

### Part 23
<b>Ravina said:</b> With regard to <b>the people of Judea, who would</b> publicly <b>disclose the tractate</b> to be studied in the coming term so that everyone could prepare and study it in advance (<i>ge’onim</i>), <b>their Torah</b> knowledge <b>endured for them;</b> with regard to <b>the people of the Galilee, who would not disclose the tractate</b> to be studied in the coming term, <b>their Torah</b> knowledge <b>did not endure for them.</b>

### Part 24
The Gemara relates that King <b>David would disclose the tractate</b> to be studied in advance, whereas <b>Saul would not disclose the tractate</b> to be studied. <b>With regard to David, who would disclose the tractate, it is written: “Those who fear You will see me and be glad”</b> (Psalms 119:74), since all were prepared and could enjoy his Torah. <b>With regard to Saul, who would not disclose the tractate</b> to be studied, <b>it is written: “And wherever he turned himself</b>
