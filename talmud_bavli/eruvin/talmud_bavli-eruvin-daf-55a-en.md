### Part 1
<b>And this</b> idea, that one must exert great effort to retain one’s Torah knowledge, <b>is</b> in accordance with <b>what Avdimi bar Ḥama bar Dosa said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “It is not in heaven…nor is it beyond the sea”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:12–13)? <b>“It is not in heaven”</b> indicates <b>that if it were in heaven, you would have to ascend after it, and if it were beyond the sea, you would have to cross after it,</b> as one must expend whatever effort is necessary in order to study Torah.

### Part 2
Expounding the verse differently, <b>Rava said: “It is not in heaven”</b> means that Torah <b>is not to be found in someone who raises his mind over it, like the heavens,</b> i.e., he thinks his mind is above the Torah and he does not need a teacher; <b>nor is it to be found in someone who expands his mind over it, like the sea,</b> i.e., he thinks he knows everything there is to know about the topic he has learned.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “It is not in heaven”</b> means that Torah <b>is not to be found in the haughty,</b> those who raise their self-image as though they were in heaven. <b>“Nor is it beyond the sea”</b> means that <b>it is not to be found among merchants or traders</b> who are constantly traveling and do not have the time to study Torah properly.

### Part 4
After the lengthy aggadic digression, the Gemara returns to the topic of the mishna, extending the outskirts of a city. <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>How does one extend</b> the boundaries of <b>cities?</b> If the city is <b>long,</b> in the shape of a rectangle, the Shabbat limit is measured from the boundary <b>as it is.</b> If the city is <b>round, one creates</b> simulated <b>corners for it,</b> rendering it square, and the Shabbat limit is measured from there. If it is <b>square, one does not create</b> additional <b>corners for it.</b> If the city <b>was wide on one side and narrow on the other side, one regards it as though</b> the two sides <b>were</b> of <b>equal</b> length, adding to the narrow side to form a square.

### Part 5
If <b>one house</b> in a row of dwellings <b>was protruding like a turret, or</b> if <b>two houses</b> were <b>protruding like two turrets, one regards them as though a cord is stretched over their</b> outer edge along the length of the city, <b>and one measures two thousand cubits</b> beginning <b>from there.</b> If the city <b>was shaped like a bow or like</b> the Greek letter <b><i>gamma</i>, one regards it as though</b> the interior space were <b>full of houses and courtyards, and one measures two thousand cubits</b> beginning <b>from there.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara proceeds to analyze the <i>Tosefta</i>. <b>The Master said:</b> If the city is <b>long,</b> the Shabbat limit is measured from the boundary <b>as it is.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise: That is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> the city is <b>long and narrow. Lest you say: Let us give its breadth</b> the dimension <b>of its length</b> and regard the city as if it were square, <b>it teaches us</b> that we do not do so.

### Part 7
The <i>Tosefta</i> stated: If the city is <b>square, one does not create</b> additional <b>corners for it.</b> Once again the Gemara asks: That is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> the shape of the city <b>is square but</b> that <b>square is not</b> aligned with the <b>four</b> directions <b>of the world,</b> i.e., north, south, east, and west. <b>Lest you say: Let us</b> align the <b>square with the four</b> directions of the <b>world, it teaches us</b> that this is not done.

### Part 8
The <i>Tosefta</i> also stated: If <b>one house</b> in a row of dwellings <b>was protruding like a turret, or</b> if <b>two houses</b> were <b>protruding like two turrets,</b> one regards them as though a cord is stretched over their outer edge along the length of the city, and one measures two thousand cubits beginning from there. The Gemara asks: <b>Now,</b> if with regard to <b>one house, you said</b> to extend the city’s boundaries, with regard to <b>two houses, is it necessary</b> to say so?

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to a case where the two houses were protruding <b>on two</b> different <b>sides</b> of the city. <b>Lest you say:</b> When a house protrudes <b>from one side, we say</b> that the city is extended even due to a single house, but if houses protrude <b>from two sides we do not say</b> so; therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> to regard the city as though it is extended on both sides.

### Part 10
The <i>Tosefta</i> stated: If the city <b>was shaped like a bow or like</b> the Greek letter <b><i>gamma</i>, one regards it as if</b> the interior space were <b>full of houses and courtyards, and one measures two thousand cubits</b> beginning <b>from there. Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to <b>a city that is shaped like a bow,</b> the following distinction applies: <b>If there are less than four thousand cubits between</b> the <b>two ends</b> of the bow, so that the Shabbat limits measured from the two ends of the city overlap, the interior space of the bow is regarded as if it were filled with houses, and <b>one measures</b> the Shabbat limit of the city <b>from the</b> imaginary <b>bowstring</b> stretched between the two ends of the bow. <b>But if</b> that is <b>not</b> the case, and the distance between the two ends of the bow is four thousand cubits or more, <b>one measures</b> the Shabbat limit <b>from the bow</b> itself.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>Did Rav Huna</b> actually <b>say</b> that the distance between two sections of a single city that renders them separate entities is four thousand cubits? <b>Didn’t Rav Huna say:</b> With regard to <b>the wall of a city that was breached,</b> even if there is a gap between two sections of the city, the city is still considered a single entity if the breach is no more than <b>141⅓</b> cubits? However, if the breach is wider, the two sections are considered separate entities. Apparently, a distance of 141⅓ cubits suffices to separate between two sections of a city and to render them separate entities.

### Part 12
<b>Rabba bar Ulla said:</b> That is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where Rav Huna speaks of four thousand cubits, he is referring to a case where the gap is <b>on</b> only <b>one side,</b> as the other side, the bow, is inhabited; but <b>there,</b> where he speaks of 141⅓ cubits, he is referring to a case where the breach is <b>from two sides,</b> which truly renders the city two separate entities.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>what is</b> Rav Huna <b>teaching us</b> in the case of the breached city wall, that <b>one allocates a <i>karpef</i>,</b> an area measuring slightly more than seventy cubits, <b>to this</b> section of the city <b>and a <i>karpef</i> to that</b> section of the city? <b>Didn’t Rav Huna</b> already <b>say</b> this <b>on one occasion? As we learned</b> in a mishna:
