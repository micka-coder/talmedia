### Part 1
<b>A</b> cross <b>beam four</b> handbreadths wide <b>renders</b> carrying <b>in a ruin</b> that is breached into a public domain <b>permitted,</b> as the edge of the cross beam is considered to descend and seal the breach. <b>And</b> that which <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: A</b> cross <b>beam four</b> handbreadths wide <b>renders</b> carrying <b>in water permitted</b> like a partition. In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion were these rulings stated?

### Part 2
The Gemara explains: <b>According to this version that you stated,</b> that Rav and Shmuel <b>agree with regard to</b> an opening no wider than <b>ten</b> cubits, here it is referring <b>to</b> a cross beam that is no longer than <b>ten</b> cubits, <b>and everyone,</b> both Rav and Shmuel, <b>agrees</b> with these rulings. <b>According to that</b> other <b>version that you stated,</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to</b> an opening no wider than <b>ten</b> cubits, these rulings are <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav</b> alone.

### Part 3
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>Abaye and Rava are disagreeing with regard to the</b> point that was the subject of a <b>dispute between Rav and Shmuel. As it was stated:</b> If one <b>placed roofing on top of a portico that has doorposts,</b> i.e., pillars that form the beginnings of partitions, <b>it is a valid <i>sukka</i>.</b> If, however, he placed the roofing atop a portico that <b>has no doorposts,</b> there is a dispute. <b>Abaye said: It is a valid <i>sukka</i>. And Rava said: It is invalid.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Abaye said: It is valid.</b> As <b>he said: The edge of a roof descends and seals.</b> Since the portico is roofed, it is considered to have partitions as well. <b>And Rava said: It is invalid,</b> as <b>he did not say: The edge of a roof descends and seals. Let us say</b> that <b>Abaye</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, and Rava</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, everyone,</b> including Abaye, <b>agrees</b> that this <i>sukka</i> is invalid. <b>Where they disagree</b> is <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav. Abaye</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav</b> in a straightforward manner. <b>And Rava</b> claims: <b>Rav stated</b> his opinion, that the edge of the portico descends and seals, <b>only there, where those partitions</b> formed by the roof <b>were built for the portico,</b> and they are therefore viewed as sealing it. <b>However, here, where these partitions were not built for</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>, no,</b> even Rav would agree that the partitions are not sufficiently significant to utilize for the purpose of this mitzva.

### Part 6
We learned in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yosei says: If they are permitted</b> to carry there on that Shabbat, they are likewise permitted to do so in the future, and if they are prohibited from carrying there in the future, they are also prohibited from carrying there on that Shabbat <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Did <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> intend <b>to prohibit</b> carrying even on that Shabbat, <b>or to permit</b> carrying even in the future?

### Part 7
<b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> His intention was <b>to prohibit</b> carrying even on that Shabbat. <b>And similarly, Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> His intention was <b>to prohibit</b> carrying even on that Shabbat. <b>This</b> opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: Just as they are prohibited</b> from carrying <b>in the future, so are they prohibited</b> from carrying <b>on that Shabbat.</b>

### Part 8
<b>It was stated: Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, while Shmuel said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>But did Shmuel</b> really <b>say this? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: In what</b> case <b>are these matters,</b> that an <i>eiruv</i> may be established for a person only with his knowledge, <b>stated?</b> It is <b>with regard to a joining of</b> Shabbat <b>boundaries, but with regard to a joining of courtyards, one may establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> for another person <b>both with his knowledge and without his knowledge, because one may act in a person’s interest</b> even when <b>not in his presence, but one may act to</b> his <b>disadvantage only in his presence.</b> One may take unilateral action on another’s behalf when it is to that other person’s benefit. However, if it is to that person’s disadvantage, or when the action entails both benefits and disadvantages, he may act on the other person’s behalf only if he was explicitly appointed as his agent. A joining of courtyards is always to a person’s benefit, and therefore it can be established even without his knowledge. However, with regard to a joining of Shabbat boundaries, any distance that a person gains in one direction he forfeits in the opposite direction. Consequently, this type of <i>eiruv</i> may be established only with his knowledge.

### Part 10
<b>And Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. And furthermore, anyplace where Rabbi Yehuda taught with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>eiruv</i>, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his</b> opinion.

### Part 11
<b>And Rav Ḥana of Baghdad said to Rav Yehuda:</b> Did <b>Shmuel state</b> this ruling <b>even with regard to an alleyway whose</b> cross <b>beam or side post was removed</b> during Shabbat? <b>And</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: I spoke to you with regard to</b> the acquisition of <b>an <i>eiruv</i>, and not with regard to partitions.</b> The Gemara asks: How, then, could Shmuel rule that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda in this case, after explicitly stating that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with his opinion in the case of fallen partitions?

### Part 12
<b>Rav Anan said:</b> This matter <b>was explained to me</b> personally <b>by Shmuel</b> himself: <b>Here,</b> where Shmuel rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, it is in a case <b>where</b> the courtyard <b>was breached into a <i>karmelit</i>.</b> In that case the <i>halakha</i> is lenient, as there is no concern lest one transgress a Torah prohibition. <b>There,</b> where Shmuel states that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, it is in a case <b>where</b> the courtyard <b>was breached into a public domain,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is therefore stringent, due to the concern lest one transgress a Torah prohibition.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who builds an upper story atop two houses</b> on opposite sides of a public domain that passes beneath it, <b>and likewise bridges with a thoroughfare</b> beneath them that rest on walls on opposite sides of a public domain, <b>one</b> may <b>carry beneath</b> the upper story and beneath the bridge <b>on Shabbat.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that these areas are considered private domains. <b>And the Rabbis prohibit</b> carrying in these areas.

### Part 14
<b>And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said: One</b> may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> even <b>for an alleyway that is open</b> at both ends, with no need for any additional measures, <b>and the Rabbis prohibit</b> doing so.

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabba said: Do not say this is Rabbi Yehuda’s reason; that he maintains</b> that <b>by Torah law two partitions</b> constitute a private domain, i.e., the areas beneath the upper story and the bridge are considered private domains, as each has two partitions, one on each side of the public domain. Rather, the reason for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is <b>because he maintains</b> that <b>the edge of a roof descends and seals.</b> The edges of the upper story and the bridge are considered to seal the areas beneath them.

### Part 16
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rabba from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> With regard to <b>one who has two houses on two sides of a public domain</b> and seeks to carry from one house to the other on Shabbat via the public domain, <b>he places a side post from here,</b> adjacent to one of the houses, <b>and</b> another <b>side post from there,</b> adjacent to the other house, <b>or</b> he places <b>a</b> cross <b>beam from here and</b> another cross <b>beam from there, and he may</b> subsequently <b>carry</b> objects <b>and place</b> them <b>in the middle</b> of the area, as he transformed it into a private domain. His colleagues <b>said to him: One cannot establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> to transform a <b>public domain</b> into a private domain <b>in this manner.</b> Clearly, the rationale for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion in that case is not that the edge of the roof descends and seals, as the area is not covered. Rather, he apparently holds that by Torah law, two walls suffice to form a private domain.

### Part 17
Rabba <b>said to him: From that</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>yes,</b> it is indeed possible to arrive at this conclusion. But <b>from this,</b> the mishna, <b>nothing can be learned from this</b> source, as there could be a different reason for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion.

### Part 18
<b>Rav Ashi said: The mishna is also precise</b> in its wording, as it indicates that the rationale for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is that the edge of a roof descends and seals. <b>As</b> the mishna <b>teaches: And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said: One</b> may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> even <b>for an alleyway that is open</b> at both ends, <b>and the Rabbis prohibit</b> doing so.

### Part 19
<b>Granted, if you say</b> that the reason for Rabbi Yehuda’s leniency with regard to carrying beneath an upper story and a bridge is <b>that he maintains</b> that <b>the edge of a roof descends and seals, that is</b> why the mishna <b>states: And furthermore,</b> to introduce the ruling for an alleyway. In other words, the <i>tanna</i> of our mishna is saying that the ruling applies not only to a roofed area, but also to an unroofed alleyway, despite the fact that the reason there is that two partitions suffice to create a private domain by Torah law.

### Part 20
<b>However, if you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda permitted the first case as well <b>because he maintains</b> that <b>by Torah law two partitions</b> suffice to create a private domain, <b>what</b> is the need for the introduction: <b>And furthermore?</b> The rationale for the second ruling is no different from the rationale for the first. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is correct.

### Part 22
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who finds phylacteries</b> outside the city on Shabbat, where they are in danger of becoming lost or damaged, <b>brings them in</b> to his house <b>pair</b> by <b>pair</b> by donning them in the manner in which they are typically donned for the mitzva. <b>Rabban Gamliel says:</b> He brings them in <b>two</b> pairs by <b>two</b> pairs. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that one is permitted to carry phylacteries inside <b>said?</b> It is <b>with regard to old</b> phylacteries, which have already been used and are designated for the mitzva. <b>However, with regard to new</b> ones, as it is unclear whether they are phylacteries or merely amulets in the form of phylacteries, he is <b>exempt</b> from performing the task.

### Part 23
If <b>one finds</b> phylacteries <b>tied in bundles or in wrapped piles,</b> in which case he is unable to carry them in pairs, <b>he</b> sits there and <b>waits with them until dark,</b> guarding them until the conclusion of Shabbat, <b>and</b> then <b>brings them in</b> to his house.
