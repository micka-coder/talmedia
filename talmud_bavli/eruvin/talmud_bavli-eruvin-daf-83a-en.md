### Part 1
A Sage <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>And half of one half of its half,</b> one-eighth of this loaf, is the minimum measure of food that <b>contracts the</b> ritual <b>impurity of foods.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And our <i>tanna</i>,</b> in the mishna, for <b>what reason</b> did <b>he did not teach</b> the measure of <b>the impurity of foods?</b> The Gemara answers: He did not state this <i>halakha</i> <b>because their measures are not</b> precisely <b>identical.</b> The measure for the impurity of foods is not exactly half the amount of ritually impure food that disqualifies one from eating <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 2
<b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How much is half a <i>peras</i>? Two eggs minus a little;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: Two large eggs,</b> slightly larger ones than average. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>measured</b> the amount of half a <i>peras</i> after calculating the number of <i>kav</i> in the <i>se’a</i> brought before him, and found it to be <b>a little more than two eggs.</b> The <i>tanna</i> asks: <b>How much</b> is this <b>little more? One-twentieth of an egg.</b>

### Part 3
<b>In contrast, concerning the impurity of foods, it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Dosa said</b> that the measure of <b>an egg-bulk, which</b> the Sages <b>said</b> is the amount that contracts the impurity of foods, is <b>equivalent to it,</b> i.e., the egg, <b>and its shell. And the Rabbis say:</b> It is <b>equivalent to it without its shell.</b> These amounts are not precisely half of any of the measurements given for half a <i>peras</i>.

### Part 4
As for the issue itself, <b>Rafram bar Pappa said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said: This</b> <i>baraita</i> that clarifies the measure of half a <i>peras</i> is in accordance with <b>the statements of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei,</b> a measure that is identical to that of Rabbi Shimon in the mishna. <b>But the Rabbis say: One and one half large egg-bulks. And who are</b> these <b>Rabbis? Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara registers surprise: This is <b>obvious,</b> as Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka maintains that half a loaf is three egg-bulks, half of which is an egg-bulk and one half. The Gemara explains: The novel aspect of this teaching is not the amount itself; rather, <b>he came to teach us</b> that the measurement is performed with <b>large eggs.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said:</b> A person named <b>Bonyos sent Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>a measure [</b><i>modya</i><b>] of a <i>se’a</i> from</b> a place called <b>Na’usa,</b> where they had a tradition that it was an ancient and accurate measure (Ritva). <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>measured</b> it and found it contained <b>217 eggs.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>This <i>se’a</i>, from where</b> is it, i.e., on what measure is it based? <b>If</b> it is based on <b>the wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i>, the standard measure used by Moses in the wilderness, which is the basis for all the Torah’s measurements of volume, the difficulty is that a <i>se’a</i> is composed of six <i>kav</i>, where each <i>kav</i> is equivalent to four <i>log</i> and each <i>log</i> is equivalent to six egg-bulks. This means that a <i>se’a</i> <b>is</b> equivalent to a total of <b>144</b> egg-bulks.

### Part 8
<b>And if</b> it is <b>the Jerusalem</b> <i>se’a</i>, then the <i>se’a</i> <b>is</b> only <b>173</b> egg-bulks, as they enlarged the measures in Jerusalem by adding a fifth to the measures of the wilderness.

### Part 9
<b>And if</b> it is a <i>se’a</i> <b>of Tzippori,</b> as the measures were once again increased in Tzippori, where another fifth was added to the Jerusalem measure, the <i>se’a</i> <b>is 207</b> egg-bulks. The <i>se’a</i> measured by Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi does not correspond to any of these measures of a <i>se’a</i>.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> this measure is based <b>on the</b> <i>se’a</i> <b>of Tzippori,</b> but you must <b>bring</b> the amount of <b>the <i>ḥalla</i></b> given to a priest, <b>and add it to them.</b> That is to say, although this measure is slightly larger than a <i>se’a</i>, if it is used for flour and you deduct the amount due as <i>ḥalla</i>, you are left with exactly one <i>se’a</i>, or 207 egg-bulks.

### Part 11
The Gemara raises an objection: The amount of <b><i>ḥalla</i>, how many</b> egg-bulks <b>is it?</b> Approximately <b>eight</b> egg-bulks, one-twenty-fourth of 207. Yet in that case, <b>it remains less</b> than 217 egg-bulks, for even if we were to add another eight egg-bulks for <i>ḥalla</i> to the 207 egg-bulks, we would have only 215 egg-bulks, almost 216 to be more precise, which is still less than 217.

### Part 12
<b>Rather,</b> you must <b>bring</b> the <b>excess</b> amounts of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, the little more he included in his measure, <b>and add</b> these <b>to them.</b> In Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s calculations, he did not factor in the <i>ḥalla</i> that had to be separated. Instead, the egg-bulks he used to measure the <i>se’a</i> were small egg-bulks. Consequently, one-twentieth of an egg-bulk must be added for each egg-bulk. Since one-twentieth of 207 egg-bulks is roughly ten, the total amount equals 217 egg-bulks.

### Part 13
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>If so, it is</b> still slightly <b>more</b> than 217 egg-bulks, by seven-twentieths of an egg-bulk, to be precise. The Gemara answers: <b>Since it is not</b> more than 217 egg-bulks by <b>a</b> whole <b>egg, he did not count it.</b>

### Part 14
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A Jerusalem <i>se’a</i> is larger than a wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i> <b>by one-sixth, and that of Tzippori is larger than a Jerusalem</b> <i>se’a</i> <b>by one-sixth. Consequently,</b> a <i>se’a</i> <b>of Tzippori is larger than a wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i> <b>by one-third.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara inquires: <b>One-third of which</b> measurement? <b>If you say</b> it means <b>one-third of a wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i>, <b>now</b> you must consider: <b>One-third of a wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i>, <b>how much is it? Forty-eight</b> egg-bulks, and <b>yet the difference</b> between the wilderness <i>se’a</i> and the Tzippori <i>se’a</i> is <b>sixty-three</b> egg-bulks. As stated above, a Tzippori <i>se’a</i> is 207 egg-bulks, whereas a wilderness <i>se’a</i> is only 144 egg-bulks.

### Part 16
<b>But rather,</b> this one-third mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>one-third of a Jerusalem</b> <i>se’a</i>, which is 173 egg-bulks, as stated above. The Gemara again examines the calculation: <b>One-third of that</b> <i>se’a</i>, <b>how much is it? Fifty-eight less one-third,</b> and <b>yet the difference</b> between the wilderness and the Tzippori <i>se’a</i> is <b>sixty-three. Rather,</b> you must say that it is referring to one-third of a <b>Tzippori</b> <i>se’a</i>. <b>One-third of that</b> <i>se’a</i>, <b>how much is it? Seventy less one-third,</b> and <b>yet the difference</b> between the wilderness <i>se’a</i> and the Tzippori <i>se’a</i> is <b>sixty-three</b> egg-bulks. The difference between the measures is not exactly one-third according to any of the known <i>se’a</i> measurements.

### Part 17
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> that <b>this is</b> what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: Consequently, a <i>se’a</i> of Tzippori is larger than a wilderness <i>se’a</i></b> by sixty-three egg-bulks, which is <b>close to one-third of</b> a Tzippori <i>se’a</i> of sixty-nine egg-bulks. <b>And one-third of it,</b> sixty-nine egg-bulks, <b>is close to half of a wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i> of seventy-two egg-bulks.

### Part 18
<b>Ravina raised an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Does</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>state</b> either: <b>Close</b> to one-third of a Tzippori <i>se’a</i> or: <b>Close</b> to half of a wilderness <i>se’a</i>? The wording of the <i>baraita</i> indicates an exact amount. <b>Rather, Ravina said</b> that <b>this is</b> what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: Consequently, one-third of a Tzippori</b> <i>se’a</i> together <b>with the excess</b> amounts <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>is greater than half</b> of <b>a wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i> of seventy-two egg-bulks by only <b>one-third of an egg.</b> In other words, a Tzippori <i>se’a</i> of 207 egg-bulks added to the excess amounts of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi of one-twentieth of an egg-bulk for each egg-bulk amounts to a total of 217 egg-bulks, one-third of which is seventy-two and one-third egg-bulks.

### Part 19
<b>Our Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “You shall set apart a cake of <b>the first of your dough</b> as a gift; like the gift of the threshing floor, so shall you set it apart” (Numbers 15:20).
