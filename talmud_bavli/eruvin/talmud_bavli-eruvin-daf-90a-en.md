### Part 1
<b>that he built</b> the upper story <b>to protect the garden [<i>tarbitza</i>],</b> not to access the roofs.

### Part 2
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raised a dilemma:</b> According to Rav, who holds that one may carry only within four cubits on each roof, if he carries an object <b>two cubits on a roof and</b> another <b>two cubits on a pillar</b> ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide adjacent to the roof, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabba said:</b> With regard to <b>what</b> matter <b>is he raising a dilemma?</b> Is it with regard to <b>a <i>karmelit</i> and a private domain</b> that <b>he is raising a dilemma?</b> The roof is a <i>karmelit</i> and the pillar is a private domain; certainly carrying from one to the other is prohibited.

### Part 3
The Gemara explains that this was not in fact the dilemma, <b>and Rami bar Ḥama, due to his keen</b> mind, <b>did not analyze</b> the dilemma carefully and was imprecise in its formulation. <b>Rather, this is</b> the <b>dilemma he is raising:</b> If one carries an object <b>two cubits on the roof</b> of a house, <b>and</b> another <b>two cubits on</b> the slanted roof of <b>a portico,</b> a roofed structure without walls, before a house belonging to someone else, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 4
The Gemara elaborates on Rami bar Ḥama’s dilemma: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since neither this</b> roof <b>is fit for residence, nor is this</b> portico roof <b>fit for residence, it is</b> regarded as <b>one domain,</b> and therefore carrying between them is permitted? <b>Or perhaps since</b> carrying <b>from a roof to</b> another <b>roof is prohibited,</b> carrying <b>from a roof to a portico is likewise prohibited,</b> as the latter is also a domain in and of itself.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye raised a</b> similar <b>dilemma:</b> If one carries <b>two cubits on the roof</b> of a house <b>and</b> another <b>two cubits</b> on the roof <b>of a ruin</b> belonging to someone else, one side of which was completely open to a public domain, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 6
<b>Rav Kahana said: Is that not</b> precisely the same dilemma raised <b>by Rami bar Ḥama</b> with regard to a portico? <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye said: And did I come late</b> [<b><i>me’aḥer</i></b>] merely <b>to quarrel,</b> and meddle in other people’s questions? That is not the case, as the two dilemmas are not identical. <b>A portico is not fit for residence, while a ruin is fit for residence.</b> Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> might differ in each case.

### Part 7
The Gemara is surprised by this explanation: <b>And now that it is fit for residence, what dilemma is he raising?</b> The situation is comparable to the case of two standard roofs. The Gemara answers: Rav Beivai was unaware of the resolution to the dilemma raised by Rami bar Ḥama, and therefore, <b>he states</b> the dilemma employing the style: <b>If you say. If you say</b> that <b>a portico is not fit for residence,</b> and therefore carrying is permitted, it can be argued that as <b>a ruin is fit for residence,</b> the legal status of its roof should be like that of a standard roof. <b>Or perhaps</b> that is not the case, as <b>now in any event there are no residents in</b> the ruin, and therefore its roof is not comparable to a standard roof. No resolution was found for these dilemmas, and they <b>stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 8
The Gemara discusses a different question. With regard to <b>roofs that are level,</b> i.e., with a height disparity of less than ten handbreadths, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, or an isolated roof</b> that does not border other roofs, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, Rav said: It is permitted to move</b> an object <b>throughout the entire</b> roof; <b>and Shmuel said: One may move</b> an object <b>in it only within four</b> cubits.

### Part 9
The Gemara seeks to clarify the conflicting opinions. <b>Rav said</b> that <b>it is permitted to move</b> objects <b>throughout the entire</b> roof. This is <b>difficult,</b> as there is an apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Rav and</b> another statement <b>of Rav.</b> With regard to level roofs, Rav said that according to the Rabbis one may carry on each roof only within four cubits. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of a roof among roofs, <b>the</b> inner <b>partitions</b> between the houses <b>are not conspicuous,</b> and therefore, are not taken into consideration. <b>Here,</b> however, <b>the</b> outer <b>partitions</b> of a single house or group of houses <b>are conspicuous,</b> meaning that they are considered to extend upward and delineate the edge of the roof.

### Part 10
The Gemara returns to discuss Shmuel’s ruling. <b>And Shmuel said: One may carry only within four</b> cubits. Once again, it is <b>difficult,</b> as there is an apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Shmuel and</b> another statement <b>of Shmuel,</b> who said that in the case of level roofs, according to the Rabbis one may carry throughout each separate roof. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the area of the roof <b>is no greater than two <i>beit se’a</i>;</b> whereas <b>here,</b> the area <b>is greater than two <i>beit se’a</i>. And these partitions</b> of the house <b>were erected</b> for use <b>below</b> as partitions for the residence itself; <b>they were not erected to</b> serve as partitions for use on the roof <b>above.</b> Consequently, even if the walls are viewed as extending upward so that they constitute surrounding partitions for the roof, the legal status of the roof is <b>like</b> that of <b>an enclosure greater than two <i>beit se’a</i> that was not enclosed</b> from the outset for the purpose of <b>residence; and</b> the principle is that with regard to <b>any enclosure greater than two <i>beit se’a</i> that was not enclosed</b> from the outset <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>residence, one may move</b> an object <b>in it only within four cubits.</b>

### Part 11
<b>It was</b> further <b>stated</b> that these same <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to <b>a</b> large <b>ship. Rav said: It is permitted to move</b> an object <b>throughout</b> the entire ship, as it is all one domain; <b>and Shmuel said: One may move</b> an object <b>in it only within four</b> cubits. The Gemara proceeds to clarify their respective opinions. <b>Rav said: It is permitted to move</b> an object <b>throughout</b> the boat,
