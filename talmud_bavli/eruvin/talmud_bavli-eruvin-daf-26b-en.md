### Part 1
<b>This,</b> the mishna here, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, while that,</b> the other mishna, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 2
Rav Sheshet adds: <b>When you examine</b> the matter closely, you will find that <b>according to the statement of Rabbi Eliezer, one who renounces</b> his <b>authority over his</b> share in the <b>courtyard</b> to the other residents of the courtyard also <b>renounces</b> his <b>authority over his</b> own <b>house.</b> However, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, one who renounces</b> his <b>authority over his</b> share in the <b>courtyard</b> to the other residents <b>does not renounce</b> his <b>authority over his</b> own <b>house</b> to them.

### Part 3
The Gemara expresses surprise at this comment: But it is <b>obvious</b> that this is the point over which the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>Raḥava said:</b> Both <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana and I explained:</b> Rav Sheshet’s explanation <b>was necessary only with regard to</b> the case of <b>five</b> people <b>who lived in the same courtyard, one of whom forgot to join in an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the others.

### Part 5
<b>According to the statement of Rabbi Eliezer, when he renounces his authority, he need not renounce it to each and every one</b> of the residents, as we already know that Rabbi Eliezer holds that one who renounces authority does so in a generous manner, renouncing authority not only of his share in the courtyard, but also of his own house. Consequently, if he is required to renounce authority to many people, we assume that he does so even if this is not explicitly stated.

### Part 6
In contrast, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, when he renounces his authority,</b> it does not suffice that he renounces it in favor of one person; rather, <b>he must</b> explicitly <b>renounce it to each and every one,</b> as we cannot presume that he renounces authority in a generous manner.

### Part 7
The Gemara continues: <b>In accordance with which</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>is</b> the ruling <b>that was taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>? If <b>five</b> people <b>lived in the same courtyard, and one of them forgot and did not join in an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the other residents, <b>when he renounces his authority, he need not renounce his authority to each and every one</b> of the residents. The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is it? It is <b>in accordance with Rabbi Eliezer,</b> as explained above.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Kahana taught</b> the passage <b>this way,</b> as cited above, that it was Raḥava and Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana who applied Rav Sheshet’s explanation to the case of the five people living in the same courtyard. <b>Rav Tavyomei,</b> on the other hand, <b>taught</b> it <b>as follows,</b> that it was Rav Sheshet himself who applied it to that case: <b>In accordance with which</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>is</b> the ruling <b>that was taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>? If <b>five</b> people <b>lived in the same courtyard, and one of them forgot and did not join in an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the other residents, <b>when he renounces his authority, he need not renounce his authority to each and every one</b> of the residents. This statement is <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion? <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: In accordance with whom? In accordance with Rabbi Eliezer.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> which presumes that one renounces his authority over his house as well, <b>if one</b> who forgot to join in an <i>eiruv</i> with the other residents of the courtyard explicitly <b>stated: I am not renouncing</b> authority of my house, <b>and</b> likewise, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, if he</b> explicitly <b>stated: I am renouncing</b> authority of my house, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in such cases?

### Part 10
The Gemara clarifies: Is <b>Rabbi Eliezer’s reason because he maintains</b> in general that <b>one who renounces authority over his</b> share in a courtyard to the other residents presumably also <b>renounces</b> to them <b>authority over his</b> own <b>house, but</b> that since <b>this</b> person explicitly <b>stated: I am not renouncing</b> authority of my house, he therefore maintains his authority?

### Part 11
<b>Or perhaps Rabbi Eliezer’s reason</b> is <b>because people do not</b> generally <b>live</b> in <b>a house without a courtyard,</b> and therefore anyone who renounces authority over his share in a courtyard automatically renounces authority over his own house regardless of what he says. Therefore, <b>when he says: I am not renouncing</b> authority over my house, it is <b>not in his power</b> to do so, <b>as even though he says: I</b> will continue <b>to live</b> in and retain authority over my house, <b>he has said nothing.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And</b> the question likewise arises <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. If one</b> explicitly <b>stated: I am renouncing</b> authority of my house as well, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is <b>the reason</b> for the opinion of <b>the Rabbis because they maintain</b> that <b>one who renounces authority over his</b> share in a <b>courtyard</b> to the other residents presumably <b>does not renounce authority over his</b> own <b>house</b> to them, <b>but</b> since <b>this</b> person explicitly <b>stated: I am renouncing</b> authority over my house, the other residents should be permitted to carry?

### Part 13
<b>Or perhaps the reason</b> for the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> is <b>because one does not usually remove himself entirely from a house and courtyard, making himself like a guest among</b> his neighbors. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>when he states: I am renouncing</b> authority over my house, it is <b>not in his power</b> to do so, and his statement is disregarded.

### Part 14
Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa in answer to his question: <b>Both according to the Rabbis and according to Rabbi Eliezer, once one has revealed his wishes, he has revealed</b> them, and everything follows his express wishes.

### Part 15
The mishna records yet another teaching handed down by Rabbi Elai: <b>And I also heard from</b> Rabbi Eliezer another <i>halakha</i>, <b>that one may fulfill his obligation</b> to eat bitter herbs <b>on Passover with <i>arkablin</i>,</b> a certain bitter herb. The Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>arkablin</i>? Reish Lakish said:</b> It is <b><i>Atzvata ḥaruziyata</i>,</b> a type of fiber that wraps itself around a date palm.
