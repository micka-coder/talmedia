### Part 1
<b>One allocates a <i>karpef</i> to</b> every <b>city,</b> i.e., an area of slightly more than seventy cubits is added to the boundary of a city and the Shabbat limit is measured from there; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say: They spoke of</b> the measure of <b>a <i>karpef</i> only</b> with regard to the space <b>between two</b> adjacent <b>cities,</b> i.e., if adjacent cities are separated by a shorter distance than that, they are considered one city.

### Part 2
<b>And it was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disputed this issue. <b>Rav Huna said: A <i>karpef</i></b> is added <b>to this</b> city <b>and</b> another <b><i>karpef</i></b> is added <b>to that</b> city, so that as long as the cities are not separated by a distance of slightly more than 141 cubits, they are considered one entity. <b>And Ḥiyya bar Rav said: One allocates only one <i>karpef</i> to the two of them.</b> Accordingly, Rav Huna has already stated that the measure of a <i>karpef</i> is added to both cities in determining whether they are close enough to be considered a single entity.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>It is necessary</b> for Rav Huna to state this <i>halakha</i> in both instances, <b>as, had he taught it to us</b> only <b>here,</b> in the case of the breached wall, one might have said that a <i>karpef</i> is allocated to each city only in that case <b>because it had an aspect of permissibility from the outset,</b> namely, the two sections originally formed one city. <b>But there,</b> with regard to the two cities, <b>say</b> that this is <b>not the case</b> and the two cities are only considered as one if they are separated by less than the measure of a single <i>karpef</i>.

### Part 4
<b>And had he taught it</b> to <b>us</b> only <b>there,</b> with regard to the two cities, one might have said that only in that case is a <i>karpef</i> allocated to each city <b>because</b> one <i>karpef</i> would be too <b>cramped for the use</b> of both cities. <b>But here,</b> in the case of the breached wall, <b>where</b> one <i>karpef</i> <b>would not be</b> too <b>cramped for the use of</b> both sections, as the vacant space is inside the city, in an area that had not been used in this fashion before the wall was breached, <b>say</b> that this is <b>not</b> the case and a single <i>karpef</i> is sufficient. Therefore, <b>it was necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in both cases.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> distance may there be <b>between</b> the imaginary <b>bowstring and</b> the center of the <b>bow</b> in a city that is shaped like a bow? <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: Two thousand cubits. Rava, son of Rabba bar Rav Huna, said: Even more than two thousand cubits.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Abaye said: It stands to reason in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, son of Rabba bar Rav Huna, as if one wants, he can return and go</b> anywhere within the bow <b>by way of the houses.</b> Since one can always walk to the end of the city, and from there he is permitted to walk down the line of the imaginary bowstring, he should also be permitted to walk from the middle of the bow to the bowstring, even if the distance is more than two thousand cubits.

### Part 7
We learned in the mishna: If <b>there were remnants</b> of walls <b>ten handbreadths high</b> on the outskirts of a city, they are considered part of the city, and the Shabbat limit is measured from them. The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> these <b>remnants? Rav Yehuda said: Three partitions that do not have a roof over them,</b> which are considered part of the city despite the fact that they do not comprise a proper house.

### Part 8
<b>The dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In the case of <b>two partitions</b> that <b>have a roof over them, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this structure also treated like a house? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>These</b> are the structures <b>that are included in</b> the city’s <b>extension: A monument [<i>nefesh</i>]</b> over a grave <b>that is four cubits by four cubits; and a bridge or a grave in which there is a residence; and a synagogue in which there is a residence for the sexton</b> or synagogue attendant, and which is used not only for prayer services at specific times; <b>and an idolatrous temple in which there is a residence for the priests; and</b> similarly, horse <b>stables and storehouses in the fields in which there is a residence; and</b> small <b>watchtowers in</b> the fields; <b>and</b> similarly, <b>a house on</b> an island in <b>the sea</b> or lake, which is located within seventy cubits of the city; all of <b>these</b> structures <b>are included in the</b> city’s boundaries.

### Part 9
<b>And these</b> structures <b>are not included in</b> the boundaries of a city: <b>A tomb that was breached on both sides,</b> from <b>here</b> to <b>there,</b> i.e., from one side all the way to the other; <b>and</b> similarly, <b>a bridge and a grave that do not have a residence; and a synagogue that does not have a residence for the sexton; and an idolatrous temple that does not have a residence for the priests; and</b> similarly, <b>stables and storehouses in fields that do not have a residence,</b> and therefore are not used for human habitation; <b>and a cistern, and an</b> elongated water <b>ditch, and a cave,</b> i.e., a covered cistern, <b>and a wall, and a dovecote in</b> the field; <b>and</b> similarly, <b>a house on a boat</b> that is not permanently located within seventy cubits of the city; all of <b>these</b> structures <b>are not included in the</b> city’s boundaries.

### Part 10
<b>In any case, it was taught</b> that <b>a tomb that was breached on both sides,</b> from <b>here</b> to <b>there,</b> is not included in the city’s boundaries. <b>What,</b> is this <b>not</b> referring to a case where <b>there is a roof</b> on the tomb, and the two remaining walls are not included in the city’s boundaries even though they have a roof? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> is referring to a case <b>where there is no roof</b> on the tomb.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>A house on</b> an island in <b>the sea, what is</b> it <b>suitable for</b> if it is not actually part of the inhabited area? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is referring to <b>a house used to move a ship’s utensils</b> into it for storage.

### Part 12
The Gemara raises another question with regard to the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>And is a cave</b> on the outskirts of a city really <b>not included in its extension? Didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A cave is included in its extension? Abaye said:</b> That statement applies <b>when there is a structure</b> built <b>at its entrance,</b> which is treated like a house on the outskirts of the city.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: If there is a structure at the entrance to the cave, why is the cave mentioned? <b>Let him derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that it is treated like a house <b>because of the structure itself.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No, it is necessary</b> only in a case where the cave serves <b>to complete</b> the structure, i.e., where the area of the structure and cave combined are only four by four cubits, which is the minimum size of a house.

### Part 14
The discussion with regard to measuring Shabbat limits has been referring to a properly built city. <b>Rav Huna said: Those who dwell in huts,</b> i.e., in thatched hovels of straw and willow branches, are not considered inhabitants of a city. Therefore, <b>one measures</b> the Shabbat limit <b>for them only from the entrance to their homes;</b> the huts are not combined together and considered a city.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Ḥisda raised an objection:</b> The Torah states with regard to the Jewish people in the desert: <b>“And they pitched by the Jordan, from Beit-HaYeshimot</b> to Avel-Shittim in the plains of Moab” (Numbers 33:49), <b>and Rabba bar bar Ḥana said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I myself saw that place, and it is three parasangs [<i>parsa</i>],</b> the equivalent of twelve <i>mil</i>, <b>by three parasangs.</b>

### Part 16
<b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When they would defecate</b> in the wilderness, <b>they would not defecate in front of themselves,</b> i.e., in front of the camp, <b>and not to their sides,</b> due to respect for the Divine Presence; <b>rather,</b> they would do so <b>behind</b> the camp. This indicates that even on Shabbat, when people needed to defecate, they would walk the entire length of the camp, which was considerably longer than two thousand cubits, which equals one <i>mil</i>. It is apparent that the encampment of the Jewish people was considered to be a city despite the fact that it was composed of tents alone. How, then, did Rav Huna say that those who live in huts are not considered city dwellers?

### Part 17
<b>Rava said to him: The banners of the desert, you say?</b> Are you citing a proof from the practice of the Jewish people as they traveled through the desert according to their tribal banners? <b>Since it is written with regard to them: “According to the commandment of the Lord they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of the Lord they journeyed”</b> (Numbers 9:20), <b>it was considered as though it were a permanent</b> residence <b>for them.</b> A camp that is established in accordance with the word of God is regarded as a permanent settlement.

### Part 18
<b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Rav Kahana said that Rav Ashi said: If there are three courtyards of two</b> properly built <b>houses</b> among a settlement of huts, <b>they have been established</b> as a permanent settlement, and the Shabbat limit is measured from the edge of the settlement.

### Part 19
On the topic of people who dwell in huts, <b>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: Those who dwell in huts,</b> such as shepherds who pass from one place to another and stay in a single location for only a brief period, <b>and desert travelers, their lives are not lives,</b> i.e., they lead extremely difficult lives, <b>and their wives and children are not</b> always <b>their</b> own, as will be explained below.

### Part 20
<b>That was also taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Eliezer of Biriyya says: Those who dwell in huts are like those who dwell in graves. And with regard to</b> one who marries <b>their daughters,</b> the verse <b>says: “Cursed be he who sleeps with any manner of beast”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:21).

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this harsh statement with regard to the daughters of those who dwell in huts or travel in deserts? <b>Ulla said: They do not have bathhouses,</b> and therefore the men have to walk a significant distance in order to bathe. There is concern that while they are away their wives commit adultery, and that consequently their children are not really their own. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Because they sense when one another immerses.</b> Similarly to the men, the women must walk a significant distance in order to immerse in a ritual bath. Since the settlement is very small and everyone knows when the women go to immerse, it is possible for an unscrupulous man to use this information to engage in adulterous relations with them by following them and taking advantage of the fact that they are alone.

### Part 22
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical difference <b>between</b> the explanations of Ulla and Rabbi Yoḥanan? The Gemara explains: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> in a case where there is <b>a river that is adjacent to the house,</b> and it is suitable for immersion but not for bathing. Consequently, the women would not have to go far to immerse themselves, but the men would still have to walk a significant distance in order to bathe.

### Part 23
Having mentioned various places of residence, the Gemara cites what <b>Rav Huna said: Any city that does not have vegetables, a Torah scholar is not permitted to dwell there</b> for health reasons. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that vegetables are beneficial</b> to a person’s health? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Three</b> things <b>increase one’s waste, bend</b> his <b>stature, and remove one five-hundredth of the light of a person’s eyes; and they are</b>
