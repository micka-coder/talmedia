### Part 1
<b>They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> the residents of the two upper stories <b>did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> together, <b>but if they established a</b> joint <b><i>eiruv</i>, they are</b> all <b>permitted</b> to pour water into the courtyard.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And where they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>, what is the reason</b> that the residents who did not dig a pit may <b>not</b> pour water into the courtyard? <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is <b>a decree, lest</b> people <b>come to take out vessels</b> filled with water <b>from</b> their <b>houses into</b> the courtyard, to pour into the pit. In the absence of an <i>eiruv</i>, this practice is prohibited.
