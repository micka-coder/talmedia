### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s ruling concerning the foods which may or may not be used for an <i>eiruv</i> and to merge alleyways, the Gemara poses a question: This ruling is apparently superfluous, as we have already <b>learned</b> it <b>once</b> before in another mishna: <b>One</b> may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i> and a merging of alleyways with all</b> kinds of food, <b>except for water and salt.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabba said:</b> This addition comes <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua</b> in the mishna, who <b>said</b> that <b>a loaf, yes,</b> it may be used for an <i>eiruv</i>; but <b>anything else, no,</b> other foods may not be used. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that an <i>eiruv</i> may be established <b>with all</b> kinds of food, not only bread.

### Part 3
<b>Abaye raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> may <b>establish a joining of courtyards with all</b> kinds of food, <b>and</b> likewise <b>one may establish a merging of alleyways with all</b> kinds of food. <b>They said</b> that <b>one</b> must <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i> with bread only with regard to</b> an <i>eiruv</i> of <b>a courtyard. Who did you hear that said</b> that <b>bread, yes,</b> it may be used for an <i>eiruv</i>, but <b>anything else, no,</b> it may not be used? It was <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, and</b> yet the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: With all</b> kinds of food. This proves that the phrase: One may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with all kinds of food, does not necessarily exclude Rabbi Yehoshua’s opinion.

### Part 4
<b>Rather, Rabba bar bar Ḥana said:</b> It comes <b>to exclude</b> a different aspect of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, as</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said: A whole</b> loaf, <b>yes,</b> it is fit to be used as an <i>eiruv</i>, but <b>a broken</b> loaf, <b>no,</b> it is not suitable for this purpose. The mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that one may prepare an <i>eiruv</i> <b>with all</b> kinds of bread, even a broken loaf.

### Part 5
The Gemara analyzes Rabbi Yehoshua’s position itself: <b>And</b> with regard to a <b>broken</b> loaf of bread, <b>what is the reason</b> that it may <b>not</b> be used for an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> The reason is <b>due to</b> potential <b>enmity</b> between neighbors. To avoid a situation where one person says to the other: You contributed a mere slice of bread, while I donated an entire loaf, the Sages instituted that each person should provide a whole loaf.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> If <b>they all established</b> the <b><i>eiruv</i> with broken</b> loaves of bread, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? In this case there is no cause for enmity. Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> There is nonetheless a concern <b>lest the problem recur,</b> as one of them might give an entire loaf and proceed to complain about his neighbor who donated only a partial loaf.

### Part 7
A portion of dough, known as <i>ḥalla</i>, must be set aside and given to the priests. If <i>ḥalla</i> was not set aside from the dough, it must be separated from the baked bread. Moreover, if one part <i>teruma</i> fell into a hundred parts non-sacred produce, a proportionate amount must be removed from the mixture and given to a priest, after which the remainder may be eaten. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Shaul said: If one removed from</b> the loaf <b>as much as</b> must be set aside for <b>its <i>ḥalla</i>, or as much as</b> must be separated <b>from a mixture</b> of <i>teruma</i> and non-sacred produce, <b>he</b> may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i> with</b> that loaf. The reason is that in this case people would not complain that he did not give a whole loaf, as they would assume the loaf had a small part missing because <i>ḥalla</i> had been separated from it, or because <i>teruma</i> had fallen into the dough, which necessitated the separation of a certain portion. However, if more than this amount was missing, people would suspect him of eating from the <i>eiruv</i>.

### Part 8
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Wasn’t it was taught</b> otherwise in a <i>baraita</i>: If a loaf was missing <b>as much as</b> must be removed <b>from a mixture</b> of <i>teruma</i> and non-sacred produce, <b>one may establish an <i>eiruv</i> with it,</b> but if it was missing <b>as much as</b> must be removed for <b>its <i>ḥalla</i>, one may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with it?</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as the two sources are not dealing with the same amounts. In <b>this</b> case, where the <i>tanna</i> permitted a loaf that was missing the amount that must be removed for <i>ḥalla</i>, he is referring <b>to a baker’s <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> which is a smaller amount and is therefore not considered a significant reduction of the loaf. However, in <b>that</b> case, where the <i>tanna</i> did not permit a loaf that was lacking the amount that must be removed for <i>ḥalla</i>, it is referring <b>to an</b> ordinary <b>homeowner’s <i>ḥalla</i>.</b> This <i>ḥalla</i> portion is larger in size, and consequently the loaf may not be used for an <i>eiruv</i> if it is missing such a large amount.

### Part 10
The Gemara explains that this is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>The measure of <i>ḥalla</i></b> fixed by the Sages is <b>one twenty-fourth</b> of the dough. Consequently, <b>one who prepares dough for himself or dough for his son’s</b> wedding <b>feast,</b> the measure for <i>ḥalla</i> is <b>one twenty-fourth.</b> However, <b>a baker who prepares</b> dough <b>for sale in the market, and likewise a woman who prepares</b> dough <b>for sale in the market,</b> is required to separate only <b>one forty-eighth</b> of the dough, as the Sages were lenient with those who sell their wares so that they should not suffer loss.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> With regard to <b>one who connected</b> the two portions of a broken loaf <b>with a</b> wood <b>chip, one</b> may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i> with it,</b> as it looks whole. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a case of this kind that <b>one</b> may <b>not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with it?</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as in <b>this</b> case, where it may not be used for an <i>eiruv</i>, we are dealing with a situation <b>where the seam is conspicuous;</b> however, in <b>that</b> case, where it may be used for an <i>eiruv</i>, the reference is to a situation <b>where the seam is not conspicuous.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: One</b> may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> even <b>with rice bread or with millet bread. Mar Ukva said:</b> This ruling <b>was explained to me by Mar Shmuel</b> himself. <b>With rice bread one</b> may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i>, but with millet bread one</b> may <b>not establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> as it is difficult to bake edible bread out of millet.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rav said: One</b> may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i> with lentil bread.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Is that so?</b> Is such bread edible? <b>But there was that</b> lentil bread <b>in the days of Mar Shmuel, which he threw to his dog, and</b> even <b>it would not eat it.</b> Clearly, lentil bread is not fit for human consumption.

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> bread which the dog refused to eat <b>was</b> a mixture of <b>various types</b> of grain. It was baked in order to discover the taste of a bread of mixed ingredients and was similar to that which the prophet Ezekiel was commanded to eat, as it is written: <b>“Take you for yourself wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt,</b> and put them in one vessel, and make them for yourself into bread” (Ezekiel 4:9). This bread is unfit for human consumption, as even a dog at times will not eat it. However, bread prepared from lentils alone is edible.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Pappa said: That</b> bread of Ezekiel’s <b>was roasted in human excrement, as it is written:</b> “And you shall eat it as barley cakes, <b>and you shall bake it with human excrement, in their sight”</b> (Ezekiel 4:12).

### Part 16
Having mentioned this verse, the Gemara asks a related question: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>“And you shall eat it as barley [<i>seorim</i>] cakes”? Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The verse means that he should eat it <b>in</b> small <b>measures [<i>leshiurim</i>],</b> not as a satisfying meal. <b>Rav Pappa said: Its preparation</b> must be <b>like the preparation of barley</b> bread, coarse bread with regard to which one invests little effort, <b>and not like the preparation of wheat</b> bread.

### Part 17
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person</b> may <b>give a <i>ma’a</i></b> coin <b>to a grocer or a baker,</b> if they live in the same alleyway or courtyard, <b>so that</b> the grocer or baker <b>will confer upon him possession</b> of wine or bread <b>for</b> a merging of the alleyway or <b>an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> if other residents come to them to purchase these products for that purpose. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b>

### Part 18
<b>And the Rabbis say: His money did not confer possession on him,</b> as the transfer of money alone is not a valid mode of acquisition and cannot confer possession. One must perform a valid mode of acquisition, e.g., pulling an article into one’s possession, to transfer ownership.
