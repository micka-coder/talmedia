### Part 1
if its protrusion is <b>less than four cubits, it is deemed a side post</b> that renders it permitted to carry in the alleyway, <b>and no other side post is required to render it permitted.</b> However, if it protrudes <b>four cubits,</b> that section <b>is deemed an alleyway, and another side post is required to render it permitted to</b> carry in it.

### Part 2
The Gemara poses a question: <b>That side post,</b> which is added in order to permit carrying within the alleyway that was formed by the four-cubit side post, <b>where does one position it</b> such that one may carry within the alleyway? The Gemara clarifies its difficulty: <b>If one positions it alongside</b> the first side post as an addition to it, it looks as if <b>he is</b> merely <b>extending</b> the original side post, and it is not noticeable that an extra side post is present.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Pappa said: He should position it,</b> the extra side post, <b>on the other side</b> of the alleyway, near the opposite wall. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: Even if you say that he positions it alongside</b> the first side post, it is valid, so long as <b>he adds to it or diminishes from it</b> in thickness or height, so that it will be noticeable that it is a side post of its own.

### Part 4
The Gemara limits the application of Rami bar Ḥama’s ruling: <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: We stated</b> this halakha with regard to a side post protruding four cubits into the alleyway <b>only in</b> the case of <b>an alleyway</b> that is at least <b>eight</b> cubits wide. <b>However, in</b> the case of <b>an alleyway</b> that is only <b>seven</b> cubits wide, it is <b>permitted</b> to carry within the alleyway without an additional side post, not because the original side post functions as a side post but rather because it sufficiently seals off the entrance to the alleyway such that the <b>standing</b> segment <b>is greater than the breached</b> segment. The alleyway is now closed off from all four sides, and the remaining opening to the public domain is regarded as an entrance, as most of that side is closed and only a small part of it is open.

### Part 5
<b>And</b> this is derived by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference from a courtyard: Just as</b> in <b>a courtyard, which is not</b> rendered a <b>permitted</b> domain <b>by</b> means of <b>a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam,</b> but actual partitions are required, it <b>is</b> nevertheless rendered a <b>permitted</b> domain even if there are gaps in the partitions, as long <b>as the standing</b> segment <b>is greater than the breached</b> segment in <b>an alleyway,</b> with regard to which the Sages were lenient, <b>as</b> it <b>is</b> rendered a <b>permitted</b> domain <b>by</b> means of <b>a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam, is it not right</b> that it <b>is</b> rendered a <b>permitted</b> domain <b>when the standing</b> segment of the partition is <b>greater than the breached</b> segment?

### Part 6
The Gemara refutes this <i>a fortiori</i> inference that was based on the fact that the legal status of a courtyard is more lenient than that of an alleyway, as it is in fact more stringent than that of an alleyway in at least one respect. With regard to <b>what</b> is true of <b>a courtyard, that</b> as long as <b>its breach is</b> less than <b>ten</b> cubits it remains a permitted domain, can <b>you say</b> the same <b>of an alleyway,</b> which is more stringent, as in a case where <b>its breach is</b> only <b>four</b> handbreadths it is not permitted to carry in the alleyway? Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> of an alleyway cannot be derived from the <i>halakha</i> of a courtyard.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, holds</b> that <b>the breach of an alleyway</b> is <b>also ten</b> cubits. The Gemara raises a difficulty: But <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>did we state</b> this <i>a fortiori</i> inference? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna. But doesn’t Rav Huna</b> himself <b>hold that the breach</b> of an alleyway is <b>four</b> handbreadths.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> did not come to explain Rav Huna’s position. Rather, he <b>stated his own view,</b> and he does not accept Rav Huna’s opinion with regard to the law of a breach in an alleyway.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Ashi</b> went further than Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, and <b>said: Even if you say</b> that the law with regard to a side post protruding four cubits into the alleyway applies <b>in</b> the case of <b>an alleyway</b> that is exactly <b>eight</b> cubits wide, in that it <b>too does not require an</b> additional <b>side post. Whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it, you are forced to arrive at this conclusion: <b>If</b> you say that the <b>standing</b> segment <b>is greater,</b> then the alleyway <b>is permitted,</b> because its <b>standing</b> segment <b>is greater than the breached</b> segment; <b>and if</b> you say that the <b>breached</b> segment <b>is greater,</b> then the protrusion is <b>deemed a side post,</b> as its width must be less than four cubits.

### Part 10
<b>What</b> might <b>you say</b> that would require an additional side post? Would you suggest that there is yet another possibility, <b>that the two are</b> exactly <b>equal,</b> the standing portion and the breach? <b>This is an uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>rabbinic law,</b> as carrying in an alleyway is forbidden only by rabbinic law, <b>and</b> the principle is that where there is <b>an uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>a rabbinic law,</b> one may assume the <b>lenient</b> position, as opposed to an uncertainty arising with respect to a Torah law, where one assumes the stringent position.

### Part 11
The Gemara considers a new case: <b>Rav Ḥanin bar Rava said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>an alleyway that was breached,</b>
