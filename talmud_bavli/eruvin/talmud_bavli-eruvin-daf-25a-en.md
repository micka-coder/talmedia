### Part 1
<b>The</b> Sage <b>who permits</b> doing so holds that it is permitted since in the yard itself <b>there are no residents,</b> and a place without residents cannot prohibit carrying in another, adjacent domain. <b>And the</b> Sage <b>who prohibits</b> doing so holds that it is prohibited because <b>sometimes there are residents in it</b> who can prohibit carrying in the other domain, <b>and</b> people <b>might</b> unwittingly <b>come to carry</b> from the yard to the town in their usual manner, even though it is prohibited.

### Part 2
With regard to <b>a <i>karpef</i></b> that measures <b>more than two <i>beit se’a</i></b> and <b>that had not been fenced in</b> from the outset <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>residence, and one came to reduce it</b>s size, if <b>he reduced it by</b> planting <b>trees</b> in a section of the space, <b>it is not a</b> valid <b>reduction,</b> because trees are commonly found in a <i>karpef</i> designed for dwelling; therefore, they are not considered something out of the ordinary that would reduce its size.

### Part 3
But <b>if he built up a column ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide, it is an</b> effective <b>reduction,</b> i.e., if the <i>karpef</i> is thereby reduced to the area of two <i>beit se’a</i>, one is permitted to carry within it. However, if the column is <b>less than three</b> handbreadths wide, <b>it is not an</b> effective <b>reduction.</b> And if it is <b>between three to four</b> handbreadths wide, there is a dispute between <i>amora’im</i>. <b>Rabba said: It constitutes an</b> effective <b>reduction, and Rava said: It does not constitute an</b> effective <b>reduction.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara explains the two opinions. <b>Rabba said</b> that <b>it constitutes an</b> effective <b>reduction because</b> it is large enough <b>to be excluded from the principle of <i>lavud</i>,</b> namely, that solid surfaces with gaps between them less than three handbreadths are considered joined. Since the column stands independently, it reduces the size of the <i>karpef</i>. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>it does not constitute a</b> valid <b>reduction because as it is not a place</b> of at least <b>four</b> handbreadths, <b>it is not significant.</b> An area of less than four handbreadths is not considered independent.

### Part 5
It was further stated: <b>If one distanced</b> himself <b>four</b> handbreadths <b>from the wall</b> of the <i>karpef</i> <b>and erected an</b> additional <b>partition</b> for the sake of dwelling, <b>it is effective</b> in permitting one to carry in the fenced-off inner area. But if the distance is <b>less than three</b> handbreadths, <b>it is not effective,</b> as the new wall is considered attached to the first by means of the principle of <i>lavud</i>, and it is like one partition built on top of another. And if the distance is <b>between three to four</b> handbreadths, that is the topic of the dispute among the <i>amora’im</i>, in which <b>Rabba said: It is effective,</b> and <b>Rava said: It is not effective.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara explains the two opinions. <b>Rabba said: It is effective, as it</b> is far enough away <b>to be removed from the principle of <i>lavud</i>. Rava</b> disagreed and <b>said: It is not effective, because as it is not a place of</b> at least <b>four</b> handbreadths, <b>it is not significant.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Simi would teach a</b> more <b>lenient</b> version of the dispute between Rabba and Rava. <b>If one plastered</b> the walls of a <i>karpef</i> larger than two <i>beit se’a</i> <b>with plaster, and</b> the plaster <b>can stand on its own,</b> all agree that <b>it is an</b> effective <b>reduction,</b> as it is considered as if he has made a new partition. But if the plaster <b>cannot stand on its own,</b> and it only stays in place because it is attached to the existing wall, there is an amoraic dispute in which <b>Rabba said: It is an</b> effective <b>reduction,</b> and <b>Rava said: It is not an</b> effective <b>reduction.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara explains the two opinions. <b>Rabba says: It is an</b> effective <b>reduction,</b> because for <b>now, in any case, it stands. Rava says: It is not an</b> effective <b>reduction, because as it cannot stand on its own, it is nothing,</b> i.e., it is insignificant.

### Part 9
<b>If one distanced</b> himself <b>four</b> handbreadths <b>from a mound</b> ten handbreadths high that stands in a <i>karpef</i> larger than two <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>and</b> he <b>erected a partition</b> for the sake of dwelling, <b>it is effective</b> to permit one to carry.

### Part 10
But if he erected the partition <b>less than three</b> handbreadths from the mound <b>or on the edge of the mound</b> itself, so that it is like a partition built on top of another partition, this is a dispute between <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rav Hamnuna. One</b> of them <b>said: It is effective,</b> and <b>the other one said: It is not effective.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara seeks to clarify which of the Sages held which opinion. <b>Conclude that</b> it was <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> who <b>said it is effective, for it was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about the following: If <b>one erected a partition on top of an</b> existing <b>partition, Rav Ḥisda said:</b> With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat,</b> e.g., if the first partition was not erected for the purpose of residence, the second partition <b>is effective.</b>

### Part 12
However, <b>with regard to the property of a convert, he does not acquire</b> it. The property of a convert who dies without heirs is regarded as ownerless unless he had transferred it to someone as a gift during his lifetime. Whoever first implements a valid mode of acquisition upon such property acquires it. For example, one may acquire property by performing an act of taking possession, such as construction of a partition around it. But if one erects a partition around the property of a deceased convert on top of an existing partition, he does not acquire the property in this manner.

### Part 13
<b>And Rav Sheshet said: Even with regard to Shabbat it is not effective.</b> The Gemara comments: Indeed, <b>conclude</b> that it is Rav Ḥisda who maintains that one partition built on top of another is effective for Shabbat.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: Rav Sheshet agrees with me that if one erected a partition on the mound,</b> rather than merely adjacent to it, <b>that it is effective</b> to permit one to carry on the mound itself, even though, according to him, it is prohibited to carry in the rest of the <i>karpef</i>.

### Part 15
<b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Since he dwells in the space</b> between <b>the upper partitions,</b> he utilizes these new partitions and they serve a function. Although in relation to one positioned below the mound these are partitions built on top of the pre-existing partitions of the mound, and therefore they do not allow him to carry in the <i>karpef</i>, they are nonetheless effective in allowing him to carry on the mound itself.

### Part 16
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana raised a dilemma: If the lower partitions were swallowed up,</b> e.g., if they sank in boggy ground, and <b>the upper</b> partitions that he had erected still <b>stand, what is</b> the law?

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> issue was this dilemma raised? <b>If</b> it was raised <b>with regard to</b> acquiring <b>the property of a convert, this</b> is precisely the same as the ruling cited by <b>Yirmeya Bira’a, as Yirmeya Bira’a said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> If <b>one sowed turnip</b> seeds <b>in cracks</b> which he found <b>in land</b> that had belonged to <b>a convert, and another Jew came</b> and <b>plowed</b> the ground <b>a little, the latter one,</b> the one who plowed, <b>acquires</b> the property, and <b>the first one does not acquire</b> it.

### Part 18
<b>What is the reason</b> that the first one who sowed the seeds does not acquire the property? <b>At the time that he sowed,</b> the land <b>was not improved</b> by his sowing. <b>When it did improve,</b> with the growth of the turnips, <b>it improved on its own.</b> That is to say, the act of sowing alone is not a sufficiently noticeable action that changes and improves the property at the time. Although the sowing later proves to have been beneficial, this is seen as an improvement of the land that comes on its own. Therefore, an action that will only provide benefit in the future cannot serve as an act of acquisition.

### Part 19
<b>Rather,</b> you must say that the dilemma was raised <b>with respect to Shabbat,</b> in which case it is <b>a partition that was made on Shabbat;</b> beforehand it was not a valid partition, and the upper ones acquired the status of a partition only after the lower partitions sank into the ground.

### Part 20
<b>And it was</b> already <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Any partition made on Shabbat, whether unwittingly or intentionally, is called a</b> valid <b>partition.</b> Consequently, the upper partitions should be regarded as valid partitions that allow one to carry in the <i>karpef</i>.

### Part 21
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Wasn’t it stated about this</b> law that <b>Rav Naḥman said: They taught</b> that such a partition is called a partition <b>only</b> as a stringency, in that it is prohibited <b>to throw</b> from an area enclosed by such a partition into the public domain and vice versa; <b>but to carry</b> within it as a full-fledged private domain <b>is prohibited.</b> This implies that these are not proper partitions.

### Part 22
The Gemara refutes this objection: <b>When</b> that statement of <b>Rav Naḥman was stated, it was stated</b> with regard to a case where one erected the partition <b>intentionally.</b> Since one intentionally violated Shabbat when he erected the partition, the Sages imposed a penalty that he is prohibited to carry within the enclosed area. But if the partition was made unwittingly or came about by itself, no such penalty was imposed, and one is permitted to carry.

### Part 23
The Gemara cites a related incident: <b>A certain woman erected a partition on top of</b> another <b>partition in the property of a</b> deceased <b>convert. A certain man</b> then <b>came</b> and <b>plowed</b> the ground <b>a little.</b> The man <b>came before Rav Naḥman, who established the</b> property <b>in his possession.</b> The woman then <b>came and cried out before</b> Rav Naḥman. <b>He said to her: What can I do for you, as</b> you <b>did not take possession</b> of the property <b>in the manner that people take possession.</b>

### Part 24
With regard to <b>a <i>karpef</i></b> the size of <b>three</b> <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>and one roofed</b> one <b><i>beit se’a</i></b> of <b>it,</b> the <i>amora’im</i> disputed whether or not the area of <i>karpef</i> is two <i>beit se’a</i>, in which case it is permitted to carry there, or three <i>beit se’a</i>, in which case it would be prohibited. <b>Rava said: Its roofed space renders it in excess</b> of two <i>beit se’a</i>, meaning that the roofed area is not considered separate from the rest, and so it is prohibited to carry in the <i>karpef</i>. <b>And Rabbi Zeira said: Its roofed space does not render it in excess</b> of two <i>beit se’a</i>, and it is permitted to carry there.

### Part 25
The Gemara comments: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>Rava and Rabbi Zeira dispute the</b> same point that was the subject of <b>dispute between Rav and Shmuel.</b> These <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about the following, <b>as it was stated:</b> With regard to <b>an enclosed veranda [<i>akhsadra</i>],</b> which is a roofed structure without walls or with incomplete walls, <b>in a field</b> that has the status of a <i>karmelit</i>, <b>Rav said: One is permitted to carry in the entire</b> enclosed veranda, as it is considered a private domain. <b>And Shmuel said: One may carry only</b> a distance of <b>four cubits.</b>

### Part 26
The Gemara explains the two opinions: <b>Rav said: One is permitted to carry in the entire</b> enclosed veranda, since <b>we say</b> that <b>the edge of the roof descends</b> to the ground <b>and closes up</b> the enclosed veranda on all sides; consequently, it is considered a separate private domain. <b>And Shmuel said: One may carry only</b> a distance of <b>four cubits,</b> as <b>we do not say</b> that <b>the edge of the roof descends and closes up</b> the enclosed veranda.
