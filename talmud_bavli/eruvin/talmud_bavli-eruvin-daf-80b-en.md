### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there, as there are no partitions.</b> That alley is breached, and it is therefore fitting to compel its residents to establish some sort of partition, if only for the sake of protection. However, if there are partitions, one is not obligated to join in a merging of alleyways.

### Part 2
<b>Another version</b> of this explanation: <b>From the side it is different,</b> i.e., the preparation of an <i>eiruv</i> does not involve an adjustment to the alleyway itself, but rather it is a side issue. Consequently, an individual cannot be forced to participate in its preparation (<i>Meir Netiv</i>).

### Part 3
<b>It is stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disputed this issue. <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said: One</b> may <b>build a side post</b> from the wood of <b>an <i>asheira</i>.</b> Although it is prohibited to benefit from the tree and it must be burned, setting up a side post is a mitzva, and mitzvot were not given for benefit, i.e., the fulfillment of a mitzva is not in itself considered a benefit. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: One</b> may <b>build a</b> cross <b>beam</b> from the wood of <b>an <i>asheira</i>.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara clarifies their opinions: With regard to <b>the one who said</b> that one may build <b>a</b> cross <b>beam</b> from the wood of an <i>asheira</i>, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, <b>all the more so</b> he would permit <b>a side post</b> to be prepared from an <i>asheira</i>. <b>And the one who said</b> that one may build a <b>side post</b> from an <i>asheira</i>, Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi, spoke only of a side post; <b>but</b> as for <b>a</b> cross <b>beam, no,</b> he did not permit one to build it from an <i>asheira</i>. The reason is that an <i>asheira</i> must be burned, and it is therefore as though <b>its size has</b> already <b>been crushed.</b> Consequently, a cross beam, which must be at least a handbreadth in size, may not be prepared from an <i>asheira</i>. With regard to a side post, by contrast, a minimum width suffices, which means that even wood from an <i>asheira</i> is fit, despite the fact that it is viewed as burned.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>If the food</b> in the barrel for the merging of the alleyway <b>diminished</b> and was less than the requisite measure, <b>one</b> may <b>add</b> a little of his own <b>and confer possession</b> to the others, <b>and he need not inform</b> them of his addition. However, if new residents <b>were added to</b> the residents of the alleyway, <b>he may add</b> food on behalf of those residents <b>and confer possession</b> to them, <b>and he must inform</b> the new residents of their inclusion in the merging of alleyways.

### Part 6
<b>What is the measure</b> of food required for a merging of the alleyways? <b>When</b> the residents of the alley <b>are numerous, food for two meals</b> is sufficient <b>for all of them; when they are few,</b> less than a certain number, <b>a dried fig-bulk for each and every one of them</b> is enough.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yosei said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to the beginning of an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> when it is initially established. <b>However, with regard to the remnants of an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> e.g., if the <i>eiruv</i> decreased in size on Shabbat, it remains valid if even <b>any amount</b> remains.

### Part 8
<b>And</b> in general <b>they said</b> that it is necessary <b>to join the courtyards,</b> even though a merging of the alleyways was already in place, <b>only so that</b> the halakhic category of <i>eiruv</i> <b>will not be forgotten by the children,</b> i.e., so that the next generation should be aware that an <i>eiruv</i> can be established for a courtyard, for otherwise they would be entirely unaware of this halakhic category.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna stated: If the food in the barrel for the merging of the alleyway diminished and was less than the requisite measure, one may add to it without informing the others. The Gemara poses a question: <b>With what</b> case <b>are we dealing</b> here? <b>If you say</b> that he added <b>the same type</b> of food that had initially been used for the merging of the alleyway, <b>why specify</b> this particular case where the food <b>decreased</b> in measure? <b>Even if</b> the food <b>was</b> entirely <b>finished,</b> he should <b>likewise</b> not be obligated to inform them.

### Part 10
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps it is referring <b>to two types</b> of food, i.e., one added a different kind of food that had not been used beforehand. If so, <b>even if it</b> only <b>decreased</b> in measure, <b>no,</b> he should <b>also</b> not be permitted to add to the merging of the alleyway without informing them. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If the food</b> of a merging of the alleyway <b>was</b> entirely <b>finished,</b> and he added <b>the same type</b> of food to it, <b>he need not inform</b> the other residents; however, if the amount he added was <b>from two types</b> of food, i.e., if the added food was different from the original, <b>he must inform</b> them. The Gemara assumes that the same <i>halakha</i> is in effect even if the food of the merging of the alleyway only decreased in measure.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the mishna is referring to a case where his addition was <b>from the same kind</b> of food, <b>and if you wish, say</b> instead that it was <b>from two kinds.</b> The Gemara clarifies the previous statement: <b>If you wish, say</b> that it is referring to a case where his addition was <b>from the same kind</b> of food, and <b>what</b> is the meaning of <b>decreased?</b> It means that the food entirely <b>crumbled away,</b> so that nothing at all remained.

### Part 12
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the mishna is referring to a case where his addition was <b>from two kinds</b> of food, for if the <i>eiruv</i> <b>was</b> entirely <b>finished,</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is different.</b> That is to say, the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> that he must inform the others is in effect only if the food was entirely finished, but if any of it remains there is no need to inform them of his addition, and he may confer possession of even a different kind of food.

### Part 13
We learned in the mishna: If other residents <b>were added to</b> the residents of the alleyway, <b>he may add</b> food for those residents <b>and confer possession</b> to them, but he must inform the new residents of their inclusion in the merging of the alleyway. <b>Rav Sheizvi said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said: That is to say,</b> i.e., we can infer from the mishna, that <b>Rabbi Yehuda’s colleagues disagree with him.</b>

### Part 14
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that an <i>eiruv</i> may be established for a person only with his knowledge, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to a joining of</b> Shabbat <b>boundaries; however, with regard to a joining of courtyards, one</b> may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> for another person either <b>with his knowledge or without his knowledge.</b> Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion conflicts with that of the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna, who does not permit a person to be included in a joining of courtyards without his knowledge. The Gemara is surprised at this statement: <b>It is obvious</b> that <b>they disagree;</b> why did Rav Ḥisda find it necessary to teach us something so evident?

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: It was nonetheless necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>this</b> ruling, i.e., that he must inform them, <b>applies only to a courtyard that is</b> situated <b>between two alleyways,</b> in which case the residents of the courtyard may join in a merging of alleyways with whichever alleyway they prefer. Consequently, he must inform them with which alleyway he prepared the merging, in case they preferred to join the other alleyway. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a courtyard</b> that opens into only <b>one alleyway,</b> the merging of the alleyway only benefits them and does not harm them in any way, and you might therefore <b>say no,</b> that even the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna concedes that it is not necessary to inform them. Rav Ḥisda therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna maintains that he must inform them in all cases, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.

### Part 16
The mishna continues: <b>What is the measure</b> of food required for a merging of the alleyways? It then specifies different amounts when the residents of the alley are numerous and when they are few. The Gemara asks: <b>How many are numerous,</b> and how many are considered few? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Eighteen people</b> are considered numerous. The Gemara registers surprise: <b>Eighteen and no more?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Say: From eighteen upward.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is</b> the significance of the number <b>eighteen</b> that <b>he cited?</b> Why this figure in particular? The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, said: It was explained to me</b> personally <b>by my father,</b> Rav Yehuda: <b>Any</b> case where, <b>if</b> one were to <b>divide</b> the food of <b>two meals between them and it does not amount to</b> the measure of <b>a dried fig for each and every one of them, these are the very ones</b> the <i>tanna</i> called <b>numerous, and</b> in this case <b>food for two meals suffices</b> for all of them. <b>And if not, these are the very ones</b> the <i>tanna</i> termed <b>few,</b> which means food in the measure of a dried fig is required for each of them.

### Part 18
And Rav Yehuda <b>incidentally teaches us that</b> food for <b>two meals consists of</b> a measure equal to <b>eighteen dried figs.</b> Consequently, if there were numerous residents in the alley, then eighteen dried figs, which is food sufficient for two meals, is enough for them.

### Part 19
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One</b> may <b>join</b> courtyards <b>and merge</b> alleyways <b>with all</b> types of food, <b>except for water and salt,</b> as they are not considered foods. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> that a different limitation applies: A whole <b>loaf</b> may be used for <b>an <i>eiruv</i>.</b> With regard to <b>a baked</b> product even the size <b>of a <i>se’a</i>, if it</b> consists of <b>pieces, one</b> may <b>not join</b> courtyards <b>with it.</b> However, with regard to <b>a loaf,</b> even one the size of <b>an <i>issar</i>, if it is whole, one</b> may <b>join</b> courtyards <b>with it.</b>
