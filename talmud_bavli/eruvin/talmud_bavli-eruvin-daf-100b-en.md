### Part 1
<b>where one does not commit a transgression</b> by refraining from action. <b>However, here, where one commits a transgression</b> every additional moment he remains in the tree, <b>indeed, he</b> should <b>descend</b> from it.

### Part 2
The Gemara cites an apparent contradiction: <b>It was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>both a green tree and a dry tree</b> are included in the prohibition against climbing a tree, whereas <b>it was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>are these matters,</b> that one may not climb a tree, <b>stated? With regard to a green</b> tree. <b>But in</b> the case of <b>a dry</b> one, <b>it is permitted</b> to climb it.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> It is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that includes a dry tree in the prohibition is referring to a tree whose <b>stump sends out new</b> shoots when cut; whereas <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that excludes a dry tree from the prohibition is referring to one whose <b>stump does not send out new</b> shoots.

### Part 4
The Gemara expresses surprise at this answer: <b>You call</b> a tree whose <b>stump sends out new</b> shoots <b>dry?</b> This tree is not dry at all. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>not difficult,</b> as both <i>baraitot</i> deal with a dry tree whose stump will not send out any new shoots. However, <b>here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that permits climbing a dry tree, is referring <b>to the summer,</b> when it is evident that the tree is dead; whereas <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that prohibits climbing the tree is referring <b>to the rainy season,</b> when many trees shed their leaves and it is not obvious which remain alive and which are dead.

### Part 5
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>In the summer, the fruit</b> of the previous year left on the dry tree <b>will fall off</b> when he climbs it, and climbing the tree should therefore be prohibited lest he come to pick the fruit. The Gemara answers: We are dealing here with a case <b>where there is no fruit</b> on the tree. The Gemara asks: <b>But small branches will fall off</b> when he climbs the tree, and once again this should be prohibited in case he comes to break them off. The Gemara answers: We are dealing here <b>with a tree that has</b> already <b>been stripped</b> of all its small branches.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that</b> really <b>so? But Rav arrived at</b> a place called <b>Apsetaya and prohibited</b> its residents from climbing even <b>a tree that had</b> already <b>been stripped of</b> all <b>its branches.</b> The Gemara answers: In truth, no prohibition was involved, but <b>Rav found</b> an unguarded <b>field,</b> i.e., a place where transgression was widespread, <b>and fenced it in.</b> He added a stringency as a safeguard and prohibited an action that was fundamentally permitted.

### Part 7
<b>Rami bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Asi said: It is prohibited for a person to walk on grass on Shabbat, due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated: “And he who hastens with his feet sins”</b> (Proverbs 19:2). This verse teaches that mere walking occasionally involves a sin, e.g., on Shabbat, when one might uproot the grass on which he walks.

### Part 8
The Gemara cites another apparent contradiction: <b>It was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>it is permitted to walk on grass on Shabbat, and it was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>it is prohibited</b> to do so. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to green</b> grass, which one might uproot, thereby transgressing the prohibition against reaping on Shabbat. <b>That</b> other <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to dry</b> grass, which has already been cut off from its source of life, and therefore the prohibition of reaping is no longer in effect.

### Part 9
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>both</b> <i>baraitot</i> are referring <b>to green</b> grass, <b>and</b> yet <b>there is no difficulty: Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that prohibits walking on grass is referring <b>to the summer,</b> when the grass includes seeds that might be dislodged by one’s feet, whereas <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that permits doing so is referring <b>to the rainy season,</b> when this problem does not exist.

### Part 10
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>both</b> <i>baraitot</i> are referring <b>to the summer, and</b> it is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which permits walking on grass, is referring to a case <b>where one is wearing his shoes,</b> whereas <b>that</b> other <i>baraita</i>, which prohibits it, deals with a situation <b>where one is not wearing his shoes,</b> as the grass might get entangled between his toes and be uprooted.

### Part 11
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>both</b> <i>baraitot</i> are referring to a case <b>where one is wearing his shoes, and</b> nevertheless this is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>baraita</i> prohibits walking on grass, as it involves a case <b>where</b> one’s shoe <b>has a spike</b> on which the grass might get caught and be uprooted, whereas <b>that</b> other <i>baraita</i> permits it, because it deals a case <b>where</b> one’s shoe <b>does not have a spike.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>both</b> are referring to a case <b>where</b> the shoe <b>has a spike,</b> and it is not difficult: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which prohibits walking on grass, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the grass is <b>long and entangled,</b> and it can easily get caught on the shoe, whereas <b>that</b> other <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the grass <b>is not long and entangled.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara concludes: <b>And now, when we maintain</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with the opinion</b> of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who maintains that there is no liability for a prohibited act committed unwittingly during the performance of a permitted act, <b>all of these</b> scenarios <b>are permitted,</b> as here too, one’s intention is merely to walk and not to uproot grass on Shabbat.

### Part 14
The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i> derived from the verse mentioned in the previous discussion. <b>Rami bar Ḥama said</b> that <b>Rav Asi said: It is prohibited for a man to force his wife in the</b> conjugal <b>mitzva,</b> i.e., sexual relations, <b>as it is stated: “And he who hastens with his feet sins”</b> (Proverbs 19:2). The term his feet is understood here as a euphemism for intercourse.

### Part 15
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Anyone who forces his wife to</b> perform <b>the</b> conjugal <b>mitzva will have unworthy children</b> as a consequence. <b>Rav Ika bar Ḥinnana said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>“Also, that the soul without knowledge is not good”</b> (Proverbs 19:2). If intercourse takes place without the woman’s knowledge, i.e., consent, the soul of the offspring will not be good.

### Part 16
<b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Also, without knowledge the soul is not good”; this is one who forces his wife to</b> perform <b>the</b> conjugal <b>mitzva. “And he who hastens with his feet sins”; this is one who has intercourse</b> with his wife <b>and repeats</b> the act in a manner that causes her pain or distress.

### Part 17
The Gemara is surprised by this teaching: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rava say: One who wants all his children to be males</b> should <b>have intercourse</b> with his wife <b>and repeat</b> the act? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> where Rava issued this advice, he was referring to a husband who acts <b>with</b> his wife’s <b>consent. There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that condemns this behavior is referring to one who proceeds <b>without</b> her <b>consent.</b>

### Part 18
Apropos relations between husband and wife, the Gemara cites that <b>Rav Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Any woman who demands</b> of <b>her husband that</b> he fulfill his conjugal <b>mitzva will have sons the likes of whom did not exist even in Moses’ generation. With regard to Moses’ generation, it is written: “Get you, wise men, and understanding, and well-known from each one of your tribes, and I will make them head over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:13), <b>and it is</b> later <b>written: “So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and well-known,</b> and made them heads over you” (Deuteronomy 1:15). <b>However,</b> men possessing <b>understanding,</b> which is a more lofty quality than wisdom, Moses <b>could not find</b> any of these.

### Part 19
<b>While with regard to Leah, it is written: “And Leah went out to meet him, and said, You must come in to me, for indeed I have hired you</b> with my son’s mandrakes” (Genesis 30:16). Her reward for demanding that Jacob fulfill the conjugal mitzva with her was the birth of Issachar, <b>and it is written: “And of the children of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred, and all their brethren were at their commandment”</b> (I Chronicles 12:33).

### Part 20
The Gemara poses a question: <b>Is that so?</b> Is it proper for a woman to demand her conjugal rights from her husband? <b>But didn’t Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi say: Eve was cursed with ten curses,</b> due to the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, as <b>it is written:</b> “To the woman He said, I will greatly multiply your pain and your travail; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and yet your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you” (Genesis 3:16)?

### Part 21
Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi <b>proceeds to</b> explain this verse. <b>“To the woman He said: I will greatly multiply [<i>harba arbe</i>]”; these are</b> the <b>two drops of blood</b> unique to a woman, which cause her suffering, <b>one the blood of menstruation and</b> the other <b>one the blood of virginity. “Your pain”; this is the pain of raising children. “And your travail”; this is the pain of pregnancy. “In sorrow you shall bring forth children”; in accordance with its</b> plain <b>meaning,</b> i.e., the pain of childbirth.

### Part 22
<b>“And yet your desire shall be to your husband” teaches that the woman desires her husband,</b> e.g., <b>when he sets out on the road; “and he shall rule over you” teaches that the woman demands</b> her husband <b>in</b> her <b>heart</b> but is too shy to voice her desire, <b>but the man demands</b> his wife <b>verbally.</b> Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi adds: <b>This is a good trait in women,</b> that they refrain from formulating their desire verbally. Apparently, it is improper for a woman to demand her conjugal rights from her husband.

### Part 23
The Gemara answers: <b>When we say</b> that a woman who demands her conjugal rights from her husband is praiseworthy, it does not mean she should voice her desires explicitly. Rather, it means <b>that she</b> should <b>make herself pleasing to him,</b> and he will understand what she wants on his own.

### Part 24
The Gemara analyzes the above statement with regard to Eve’s ten curses: Are they in fact ten? <b>They are</b> only <b>seven. When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that the other curses are: A woman is <b>wrapped like a mourner,</b> i.e., she must cover her head; and she is <b>ostracized from all people and incarcerated within a prison,</b> as she typically spends all her time in the house.

### Part 25
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the meaning of ostracized from all people? If you say</b> this is <b>because it is forbidden for her to seclude herself</b> with a man, <b>it is also forbidden</b> for a man <b>to seclude himself</b> with women. <b>Rather,</b> it means <b>that it is forbidden</b> for her <b>to</b> marry <b>two</b> men, whereas a man can marry two women.

### Part 26
<b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i></b> that the three additional curses are: <b>She grows</b> her <b>hair</b> long <b>like Lilit,</b> a demon; <b>she sits and urinates, like an animal; and serves as a pillow for her husband</b> during relations.

### Part 27
<b>And</b> why doesn’t <b>the other</b> Sage include these curses? The Gemara answers: He maintains that <b>these are praise for her,</b> not pain, either because they are modest practices, e.g., urinating in a seated position, or because they add to her comfort, e.g., her bottom position during relations.

### Part 28
<b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Who teaches us by the beasts of the earth, and makes us wiser by the birds of the sky”</b> (Job 35:11)? He explains: <b>“Who teaches us by the beasts of the earth”; this is the female mule, which crouches and urinates</b> and from which we learn modesty. <b>“And makes us wiser by the birds of the sky”; this is the rooster, which</b> first <b>cajoles</b> the hen <b>and then mates</b> with it.

### Part 29
Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even if the Torah had not been given, we would</b> nonetheless <b>have learned modesty from the cat,</b> which covers its excrement, <b>and</b> that <b>stealing</b> is objectionable <b>from the ant,</b> which does not take grain from another ant, <b>and forbidden relations from the dove,</b> which is faithful to its partner, <b>and proper relations from the rooster, which</b> first <b>appeases</b> the hen <b>and then mates</b> with it.

### Part 30
<b>What does</b> the rooster do to <b>appease</b> the hen? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> Prior to mating, it spreads its wings as if to <b>say this: I will buy you a coat that will reach</b> down to <b>your feet. After</b> mating, the rooster bends its head as if to <b>say this: May the crest of this rooster fall off if he has</b> the wherewithal <b>and does not buy you one.</b> I simply have no money to do so.
