### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>the door to a rear court,</b> i.e., a door that opens from a house to the courtyard situated behind it, which is typically not a proper door but merely a wooden board without hinges that closes off the doorway; <b>and</b> likewise <b>bundles of thorns</b> that seal <b>a breach; and</b> reed <b>mats, one</b> may <b>not close</b> an opening <b>with them</b> on Shabbat. This would be considered building or completing a building, <b>unless they</b> remain <b>above the ground</b> even when they are open.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a door, or a mat, or a lattice [<i>kankan</i>] that drag</b> along the ground and are used for closing up openings, <b>when they are tied and suspended</b> in place <b>one</b> may <b>close</b> an opening <b>with them on Shabbat; and needless to say</b> this is permitted <b>on a Festival.</b> According to the <i>baraita</i>, the critical factor is apparently that they must be tied and suspended, not that they have to be held up above the ground.

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> ones <b>that have a hinge.</b> As they are considered proper doors, closing them does not appear like building. <b>Rava said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring even <b>to</b> doors <b>that</b> once <b>had a hinge,</b> even though they no longer have one. These partitions also bear the clear form of a door, and therefore one’s action does not have the appearance of building.

### Part 4
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a door, or a mat, or a lattice that drag</b> along the ground, <b>when they are tied and suspended</b> in place <b>and</b> they are held <b>above the ground even by</b> as little as <b>a hairbreadth, one</b> may <b>close</b> an opening <b>with them. However, if</b> they are <b>not</b> raised in this manner, <b>one</b> may <b>not close</b> an opening <b>with them.</b> Clearly, these doors must indeed be raised above the ground as well.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye reconciles</b> the objection <b>in accordance with his reasoning, and Rava reconciles</b> the objection <b>in accordance with his reasoning.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Abaye reconciles</b> the objection <b>in accordance with his reasoning</b> by adding to the <i>baraita</i>: They must <b>either have a hinge or</b> be held <b>above the ground. Rava</b> likewise <b>reconciles</b> the objection <b>in accordance with his reasoning,</b> as he reads: They must <b>have had a hinge or</b> else be held <b>above the ground.</b>

### Part 6
<b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>branches of thorn bushes or bundles</b> of wood <b>that were arranged</b> so that they sealed off <b>a breach in a courtyard, when they are tied and suspended</b> in place, <b>one</b> may <b>close</b> an opening <b>with them on Shabbat; and needless to say,</b> this is permitted <b>on a Festival.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a widowed door that drags</b> along the ground, <b>one</b> may <b>not close</b> an opening <b>with it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>a widowed door? Some say</b> it refers to a door built <b>from a single plank,</b> which does not look like a door, <b>and others say</b> it is <b>a door that does not have a lower doorsill</b> (<i>ge’onim</i>) and that touches the ground when closed.

### Part 8
With regard to activities that are prohibited because of their similarity to building, the Gemara cites a teaching that <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> When arranging a pile of wood for <b>a fire</b> on a Festival, if the logs are arranged <b>from the top down,</b> i.e., the upper logs are temporarily suspended in the air while the lower logs are inserted below them, <b>it is permitted.</b> However, if the wood is placed from <b>the bottom up, it is prohibited,</b> as the arrangement of wood in the regular manner is a form of building.

### Part 9
<b>And the same</b> applies to <b>eggs</b> that are to be arranged in a pile, <b>and the same</b> applies to <b>a cauldron</b> that is to be set down on a fire by means of supports, <b>and the same</b> applies to a <b>bed</b> that will be placed on its frame, <b>and the same</b> applies to <b>barrels</b> arranged in a cellar. In all these cases, the part that goes on top must be temporarily suspended in the air while the lower section is inserted beneath it.

### Part 10
With regard to bundles of thorns used to seal a breach, the Gemara cites a related incident: <b>A certain heretic</b> once <b>said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: Man of thorns! For it says about you: “The best of them is as a brier”</b> (Micah 7:4), which indicates that even Israel’s best are merely thorns. <b>He said to him: Fool, go down to the end of the verse: “The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge,”</b> a derogatory expression meant as praise. <b>Rather, what is</b> the meaning of <b>the best of them is as a brier?</b> It means that <b>just as these thorns protect a breach, so the best among us protect us. Alternatively: The best of them is as a brier [<i>ḥedek</i>]</b> means <b>that they grind [<i>mehaddekin</i>] the nations of the world into Gehenna, as it is stated: “Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs brass, and you shall beat in pieces [<i>vahadikot</i>] many peoples;</b> and you shall devote their gain to God, and their substance to the God of the whole earth” (Micah 4:13).

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person</b> may <b>not stand in the private domain and open</b> a door located <b>in the public domain</b> with a key, lest he inadvertently transfer the key from one domain to the other. Likewise, one may not stand <b>in the public domain and open</b> a door <b>in the private domain</b> with a key, <b>unless</b> in the latter case <b>he erected a partition ten handbreadths high</b> around the door and stands inside it. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 12
The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> There was <b>an incident at the poultry dealers’ market in Jerusalem,</b> where they would fatten fowl for slaughter (Rabbeinu Ḥananel), <b>and they would lock</b> the doors to their shops <b>and place the key in the window that was over the door,</b> which was more than ten handbreadths off the ground, and nobody was concerned about the possible violation of any prohibition. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> That place <b>was a market of wool dealers.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> those <b>Rabbis,</b> who cited the case of the poultry dealers of Jerusalem to rebut Rabbi Meir’s opinion, <b>Rabbi Meir spoke</b> to them about unlocking a door in a private domain while standing <b>in the public domain, and they responded</b> with an incident involving <b>a <i>karmelit</i>. As Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>Jerusalem, were it not</b> for the fact that <b>its doors are locked at night, one would be liable for</b> carrying in <b>it</b> on Shabbat, <b>because</b> its thoroughfares have the status of <b>the public domain.</b> However, since Jerusalem’s doors are typically locked, it is considered one large <i>karmelit</i>, which is subject to rabbinic prohibitions. How, then, could a proof be cited from the markets of Jerusalem with regard to the transfer of objects between a public domain and a private domain, which is prohibited by Torah law?

### Part 14
<b>Rav Pappa said: Here,</b> in the statement of Rabbi Yohanan, Jerusalem was considered a <i>karmelit</i> during the period <b>before breaches were made in its</b> walls. Its doors did not turn it into a public domain, as they were locked. Whereas <b>there,</b> the Rabbis in the mishna are referring to the time <b>after breaches had been made in</b> the walls, and it therefore acquired the status of a public domain.

### Part 15
<b>Rava said: In the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>we came to</b> a different issue, i.e., the final section of the mishna is not designed to counter Rabbi Meir’s statement with regard to the public domain. Rather, it refers <b>to</b> the <b>gates of a garden</b> with an area greater than two <i>beit se’a</i> in size, whose legal status is that of a <i>karmelit</i>. Consequently, the mishna <b>is saying as follows: And likewise,</b> one may <b>not stand in the private domain and open</b> a door <b>in a <i>karmelit</i>;</b> neither may one stand <b>in a <i>karmelit</i> and open</b> a door <b>in the private domain,</b>
