### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> If the produce was returned and is now <b>in its</b> original <b>place, it may be eaten;</b> but if it is <b>not in its</b> original <b>place,</b> i.e., if it is still beyond the Shabbat limit, <b>it may not be eaten.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> meant by: <b>In its place? If you say</b> that the produce was returned to <b>its place intentionally,</b> there is a difficulty, <b>as it was explicitly taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov say:</b> It <b>is actually prohibited</b> to carry the produce beyond four cubits, <b>unless it was returned to its place unwittingly.</b> By inference, only if it was returned <b>unwittingly</b> is it <b>indeed</b> permitted, but if it was returned <b>intentionally,</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted.

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> does it <b>not</b> mean that the produce was returned <b>to its place unwittingly, and</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and it teaches the following:</b> With regard to <b>produce that was taken out beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit,</b> if it was taken out <b>unwittingly, it may be eaten;</b> but if it was taken out <b>intentionally, it may not be eaten.</b>

### Part 4
<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> In a case where the produce is <b>not in its</b> original <b>place,</b> i.e., it is still beyond the Shabbat limit. <b>But</b> if it was returned and is now <b>in its</b> original <b>place, even</b> if it was returned <b>intentionally, it may be eaten. And Rabbi Neḥemya came to say: Even</b> if the produce was returned and is now <b>in its</b> original <b>place,</b> a distinction applies. If it was returned <b>unwittingly, yes,</b> it is permitted; but if it was returned <b>intentionally,</b> it is <b>not.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>No,</b> this is not necessarily the case, as the <i>baraita</i> can also be explained as follows: If the produce was returned <b>intentionally to its place, everyone agrees,</b> i.e., both the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Neḥemya, that <b>it is forbidden. However, here they disagree with regard to</b> produce that was <b>unwittingly</b> taken out beyond the Shabbat limit and was not returned, so that it is <b>not in its</b> original <b>place. The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that if the produce was taken out <b>unwittingly, it is permitted</b> to be eaten, even if it is <b>not in its</b> original <b>place.</b> However, <b>Rabbi Neḥemya holds</b> that <b>even</b> if the produce was taken out <b>unwittingly,</b> if it was returned <b>to its</b> original <b>place,</b> it <b>is</b> permitted; but if it was not returned <b>to its</b> original <b>place,</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted.

### Part 6
The Gemara objects to this reading: <b>However, since the latter clause</b> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov say: Actually,</b> carrying the produce beyond four cubits <b>is prohibited, unless it was returned to its place unwittingly,</b> and by inference, only if it was <b>unwittingly</b> returned is it <b>indeed</b> permitted; however, if it was returned <b>intentionally,</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted. And since Rabbi Neḥemya maintains that produce that was intentionally returned to its place is forbidden, <b>by inference, the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that even if it was returned <b>intentionally, it is also permitted.</b> If so, the preceding explanation cannot be accepted, and the Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that Rav Pappa’s opinion is supported by the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> If <b>one was walking</b> in a certain place <b>and does not know</b> where <b>the Shabbat limit</b> lies, <b>he may take two thousand medium strides</b> in each direction from the spot he acquired as his place of residence, <b>and this is the Shabbat limit,</b> for a medium stride is approximately a cubit.

### Part 8
<b>And Rav Naḥman</b> also <b>said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> If <b>one established residence in a valley, and gentiles surrounded</b> the entire area <b>with a partition</b> for the purpose of residence <b>on Shabbat, he may walk</b> only <b>two thousand cubits</b> in each direction, as he cannot rely on partitions that were not present when he acquired his place of residence. However, <b>he may carry in the entire</b> partitioned area, as in any other private domain, even in the part that is beyond his two thousand cubits, but only <b>by means of throwing,</b> as he himself cannot accompany the object past two thousand cubits.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Huna said: He may walk two thousand cubits;</b> however, even within this area <b>he may carry</b> objects only a distance of <b>four cubits,</b> as in a <i>karmelit</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>And let him</b> be permitted to <b>carry in the entire</b> partitioned area <b>by means of throwing.</b> Although he himself is limited in where he may walk, the partitions render it a private domain, and he should be permitted to carry in the entire area.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: The Sages prohibited this as a preventive measure, <b>lest he be drawn after his object.</b> It is prohibited for him to leave the two thousand cubit limit, but were he permitted to carry by means of throwing, he might follow his object and go out beyond his permitted limit.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>Within two thousand</b> cubits, <b>at any rate, let him carry</b> the object <b>in his usual manner.</b> Since he may traverse this area, there should be no concern that he might come to be drawn after the object.

### Part 12
The Gemara answers that this is prohibited due to another aspect of the laws of <i>eiruvin</i>, namely <b>because this is similar</b> to the case of <b>a partition that is breached in its entirety,</b> leaving the space open <b>to a place into which it is prohibited</b> to carry. Since he may not carry more than two thousand cubits, and the enclosed area is larger than two thousand cubits, the area that is permitted to him is breached in its entirety, left open to an area that is prohibited to him. Consequently, carrying is prohibited in the entire area, even by means of throwing.

### Part 13
However, <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav said:</b> In that case, <b>he may walk two thousand cubits, and he may</b> also <b>carry</b> objects <b>within</b> these <b>two thousand cubits.</b> The Gemara poses a question: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Ḥiyya bar Rav issue his ruling? It is <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman, nor in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna,</b> while this dispute would appear to leave no place for a third opinion.

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: <b>Read</b> Ḥiyya bar Rav’s ruling as follows: <b>He may carry</b> objects only a distance of <b>four</b> cubits. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, this is</b> the same as the opinion <b>of Rav Huna.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Read</b> it then as follows: <b>And similarly, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Rav said.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rav Naḥman said to Rav Huna: Do not argue with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel</b> as cited by Rav Naḥman with regard to a field surrounded by a partition on Shabbat, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:
