### Part 1
and <b>removed</b> the reeds, as he maintained that they were unnecessary; he regarded the entire orchard as having been enclosed for the purpose of residence, owing to the banqueting pavilion. <b>Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, went after him and collected</b> the reeds, so as to prevent Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana from restoring the partitions, as they were Rava’s students and wanted to enforce his ruling.

### Part 2
<b>On the following day,</b> on Shabbat, <b>Ravina raised an objection to Rava’s</b> opinion from a <i>baraita</i> which states: In the case of <b>a new town, we measure</b> the Shabbat limit <b>from its settled</b> area, from where it is actually inhabited; <b>and</b> in the case of <b>an old</b> town, we measure the Shabbat limit <b>from its wall,</b> even if it is not inhabited up to its wall.

### Part 3
<b>What is a new</b> town, <b>and what is an old</b> town? <b>A new</b> town is one <b>that was</b> first <b>surrounded</b> by a wall, <b>and</b> only <b>afterward settled,</b> meaning that the town’s residents arrived after the wall had already been erected; <b>an old</b> town is one <b>that was</b> first <b>settled, and</b> only <b>afterward surrounded</b> by a wall. Ravina raised his objection: <b>And this</b> orchard <b>should also be considered like</b> a town <b>that was</b> first <b>surrounded</b> by a wall <b>and</b> only <b>afterward settled,</b> as it had not been enclosed from the outset for the purpose of residence. Even if a dwelling was later erected there, this should not turn it into a place that had been enclosed for the purpose of residence.

### Part 4
Seeing that an additional objection could be raised against his teacher’s position, <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: Didn’t Rav Asi say</b> that <b>the</b> temporary <b>screens</b> erected by <b>architects</b> to serve as protection against the sun and the like <b>are not deemed</b> valid <b>partitions? Apparently, since it was erected</b> only <b>for privacy,</b> and not for the purpose of permanent dwelling, <b>it is not considered a</b> valid <b>partition. Here too,</b> then, with regard to the fence around the orchard, <b>since it was erected</b> only <b>for privacy, it should not be considered a</b> valid <b>partition.</b>

### Part 5
And <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rava: Didn’t Rav Huna say</b> that <b>a partition made for resting</b> objects alongside it and thereby providing them with protection <b>is not considered a</b> valid <b>partition?</b>

### Part 6
This is <b>as Rabba bar Avuh</b> did, when he <b>constructed an <i>eiruv</i></b> separately for each <b>row of houses in the whole</b> town <b>of Meḥoza, due to the ditches</b> from which <b>the cattle</b> would feed that separated the rows of houses from one another. <b>Shouldn’t</b> such <b>cattle ditches be considered like a partition made for resting</b> objects alongside it? Such a partition is invalid. All these proofs indicate that Rava was wrong to remove the reed fences erected by Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana, for those fences were indeed necessary.

### Part 7
With regard to the resolution of this incident, <b>the Exilarch recited</b> the following <b>verse about</b> these Rabbis: <b>“They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge”</b> (Jeremiah 4:22), as on Friday they ruined the arrangement that Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana had made to permit carrying from the house to the pavilion, and the next day all they could do was prove that they had acted improperly the day before and that it was prohibited to carry in the orchard.

### Part 8
We learned in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Elai said: I heard from Rabbi Eliezer</b> that one is permitted to carry in a garden or <i>karpef</i>, <b>even</b> if the garden <b>is</b> the size of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>,</b> thirty times larger than a <i>beit se’a</i>. The Gemara notes that all agree that what the mishna taught was <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Ḥananya says:</b> One is permitted to carry <b>even if it</b> is the size of <b>forty <i>beit se’a</i>, like the court of a king.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Both</b> Rabbi Elai and Ḥananya <b>derived</b> their opinion <b>from the same verse, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into the middle courtyard,</b> that the word of the Lord came to him, saying” (ii Kings 20:4). In the biblical text, <b>it is written: “The city [<i>ha’ir</i>],” and we read</b> it as: “The middle <b>courtyard [<i>ḥatzer</i>],”</b> as there is a difference in this verse between the written word and how it is spoken. <b>From here</b> it is derived that <b>royal courts were</b> as large <b>as intermediate-</b>sized <b>cities.</b> Consequently, there is no contradiction, as the central courtyard of the royal palace was itself like a small town.

### Part 10
The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabbi Elai and Ḥananya <b>disagree?</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elai, <b>maintains: Intermediate-</b>sized <b>towns are</b> the size of a field that had an area of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>; and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Ḥananya, <b>maintains: They are</b> the size of <b>forty <i>se’a</i>.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks about the Biblical narrative cited above: <b>What did Isaiah need</b> to do <b>there</b> in the middle court, i.e., why was he there? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This teaches that Hezekiah took ill, and Isaiah went and established a</b> Torah <b>academy at his door,</b> so that Torah scholars would sit and occupy themselves with Torah outside his room, the merit of which would help Hezekiah survive.

### Part 12
<b>Based on this,</b> it is derived, <b>with regard to a Torah scholar who took ill, that one establishes an academy at</b> the <b>entrance</b> to <b>his</b> home. The Gemara comments: <b>This,</b> however, <b>is not a</b> proper <b>course</b> of action, as <b>perhaps they will come to provoke Satan against him.</b> Challenging Satan might worsen the health of a sick person rather than improve it.

### Part 13
The mishna cites another statement made by Rabbi Elai in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: <b>And I also heard from him</b> another <i>halakha</i>: If <b>one of the residents of a courtyard forgot and did not join in an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the other residents, and on Shabbat he ceded ownership of his share in the courtyard to the other residents, it <b>is prohibited</b> for him, the one who forgot to establish an <i>eiruv</i>, to bring in objects or take them out from <b>his house</b> to the courtyard; but it is permitted to the other residents to bring objects from their houses to that other person’s house via the courtyard, and vice versa.

### Part 14
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: It <b>is prohibited</b> for the one who forgot to establish an <i>eiruv</i> to bring in objects or take them out from <b>his house</b> to the courtyard, <b>and for</b> the other residents who did make an <i>eiruv</i>, <b>to take out</b> objects from the house to the courtyard <b>or to bring</b> them into the house from the courtyard.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> This is <b>not difficult.</b>
