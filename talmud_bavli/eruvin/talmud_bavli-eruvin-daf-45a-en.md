### Part 1
<b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If a person left his Shabbat limit by walking <b>two</b> cubits beyond it, <b>he may reenter</b> his original limit; but if he left his Shabbat limit by walking <b>three</b> cubits beyond it, <b>he may not reenter. What,</b> is it <b>not that Rabbi Eliezer follows his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, in</b> that he <b>said</b> with regard to the four cubits a person is allotted wherever he is, he is set <b>in the middle of them,</b> i.e., he may walk two cubits in each direction?

### Part 2
The Gemara explains that <b>the four cubits that the Sages gave</b> a person <b>are regarded</b> here <b>as being subsumed</b> within his original limit, <b>and</b> it is for this reason that <b>he said: He may reenter</b> his original limit. <b>Apparently</b> he is of the opinion that <b>the subsuming of</b> one Shabbat limit within another <b>is something</b> significant.

### Part 3
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said to Abaye: Do you raise an objection against our Master,</b> Rabba, <b>from</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Eliezer?</b> But isn’t the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer? Abaye <b>said to him: Yes, as I heard from our Master</b> himself that <b>the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer only</b> with regard to one who went beyond his limit <b>for a voluntary matter, but</b> with regard to one who went out <b>for a mitzva matter, they agree with him</b> about the subsuming of limits, i.e., that if one limit is subsumed in another, it is permitted to pass between them. This demonstrates that the <i>halakha</i> recognizes the principle of the subsuming of limits.

### Part 4
The mishna teaches: <b>All who go out to save</b> lives <b>may return to their</b> original <b>locations</b> on Shabbat. The Gemara asks: Does this mean that he may return to his original place <b>even</b> if he went out <b>more</b> than two thousand cubits beyond his limit? <b>Didn’t the first clause say</b> that a person who was permitted to travel beyond his Shabbat limit is allotted <b>two thousand cubits, and no more?</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> What this means is <b>that they may return with</b> their <b>weapons to their</b> original <b>locations,</b> provided they are within two thousand cubits. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the difficulty</b> with returning home in this situation? <b>Perhaps</b> in the case where people went out <b>to</b> fight and <b>save</b> lives the law <b>is different,</b> and they are allowed to go home even if they went more than two thousand cubits beyond the limit.

### Part 6
<b>Rather, if there is a difficulty, this is the difficulty: As we learned</b> in a mishna in tractate <i>Rosh HaShana</i>, <b>at first</b> they would take the witnesses who had come to Jerusalem from a distant place on Shabbat to testify that they had seen the new moon, and bring them into a special courtyard, <b>and they would not move from there the entire day.</b> This was in accordance with the law governing one who was permitted to go out beyond his limit, as once he fulfilled his mission, he was no longer permitted to move beyond four cubits.

### Part 7
However, <b>Rabban Gamliel the Elder instituted that they</b> should <b>have two thousand cubits in each direction,</b> so that witnesses not refrain from coming to testify. <b>And</b> it is <b>not only these</b> whom the Sages <b>said</b> are given two thousand cubits in the place that they have reached, <b>but even a midwife who comes to deliver</b> a child, <b>and one who comes to rescue</b> Jews <b>from</b> an invasion of gentile <b>troops or from a river or a collapsed building or a fire; they are like the inhabitants of the town</b> at which they arrive, <b>and they have two thousand cubits in each direction.</b>

### Part 8
The question may be raised: Are they given <b>no more</b> than two thousand cubits? <b>Didn’t it say</b> in the mishna: <b>All who go out to save</b> lives <b>may return to their</b> original <b>locations</b> on Shabbat, which indicates that they may walk <b>even more</b> than two thousand cubits?

### Part 9
In response, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> We must not infer from the mishna that they may go home even if they went out more than two thousand cubits from their limit, but rather <b>that they may return with</b> their <b>weapons to their</b> original <b>locations,</b> provided that they are within two thousand cubits. <b>As it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>At first</b> those returning from a rescue mission <b>would place their weapons in</b> the first house that they encountered upon their return, i.e., <b>the house nearest the wall,</b> to avoid carrying on Shabbat any more than necessary.

### Part 10
<b>Once,</b> their <b>enemies noticed that they</b> were no longer carrying their weapons, <b>and</b> they <b>chased after them; and</b> the defenders <b>entered</b> the house <b>to take up their weapons</b> and fight, <b>and</b> their <b>enemies entered after them,</b> causing great confusion. In the chaos, the defenders began to <b>push one another, and</b> they <b>killed more of each other than</b> their <b>enemies killed</b> of them. <b>At that time</b> the Sages <b>instituted that they should return to their locations,</b> i.e., their destinations, <b>with their weapons.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara cites an alternate resolution that <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the mishna in <i>Rosh HaShana</i> where they only permitted two thousand cubits, it is referring to a situation <b>where the Jews defeated the nations of the world,</b> i.e., the gentiles, in battle; in such a case there is no concern and they need not return to their original locations. Whereas <b>here,</b> in the mishna which indicates that the Sages permitted even more than two thousand cubits, it is referring to a situation <b>where the nations of the world defeated themselves,</b> i.e., the Jews, whom the Gemara refers to euphemistically as themselves; in such a case the Sages allowed the defeated soldiers to return to their original locations.

### Part 12
Since the Gemara discussed war on Shabbat, the Gemara cites <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> who <b>said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>gentiles who besieged Jewish towns, they may not go out</b> to fight <b>against them with their weapons, nor may they desecrate Shabbat</b> in any other way <b>due to them,</b> but rather they must wait until after Shabbat.

### Part 13
<b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with a caveat: With regard to <b>gentiles who besieged, etc. In what</b> case <b>is this said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where</b> the gentiles <b>came</b> and besieged the town <b>with regard to monetary matters,</b> i.e., banditry. <b>However, if they came with regard to lives,</b> i.e., there is concern that the gentiles will attack, <b>they may go out against them with their weapons, and they may desecrate Shabbat due to them.</b>

### Part 14
<b>And with regard to a town that is</b> located <b>near the border, even if</b> the gentiles <b>did not come with regard to lives, but</b> rather <b>with regard to matters of hay and straw,</b> i.e., to raid and spoil the town, <b>they may go out against them with their weapons, and they may desecrate Shabbat due to them,</b> as the border must be carefully guarded, in order to prevent enemies from gaining a foothold there.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Yosef bar Manyumi said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said: And Babylonia is considered like a town</b> located <b>near the border,</b> and war may be waged there on Shabbat even if the gentiles came for financial gain. <b>And this means</b> the city of <b>Neharde’a,</b> which was located near the border.

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Dostai</b> of the town <b>of Biri expounded: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “And they told David, saying: Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Ke’ila, and they rob the threshing floors”</b> (i Samuel 23:1), after which David asked God how he should respond.

### Part 17
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ke’ila was a town</b> located <b>near the border,</b> and the Philistines <b>came only with regard to matters of hay and straw, as it is written: “And they rob the threshing floors.” And</b> in the next verse <b>it is written: “Therefore David inquired of the Lord, saying: Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said to David: Go and smite the Philistines, and save Ke’ila”</b> (i Samuel 23:2), which indicates that war may be waged in a border town on Shabbat, even with regard to monetary matters.

### Part 18
The Gemara refutes this proof by asking: <b>What is</b> David’s <b>dilemma? If you say</b> that he had a halakhic question and was in doubt <b>whether it was permitted or prohibited</b> to fight the Philistines on Shabbat, it is possible to respond: <b>But the court of Samuel from Rama was</b> then <b>in existence,</b> and rather than inquire by way of the <i>Urim VeTummim</i> he should have inquired of the Great Sanhedrin.

### Part 19
<b>Rather,</b> he asked: <b>Will he succeed or will he not succeed</b> in his war? The Gemara comments: <b>This is also precise</b> in the language of the verse, <b>as it is written</b> in the response to David’s query: <b>“Go and smite the Philistines, and save Ke’ila.” Learn from this,</b> from the assurance that God gave David of his victory, that this was the subject of his inquiry.

### Part 20
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a person who was sitting along the road</b> on Shabbat eve toward nightfall, unaware that he was within the city’s Shabbat limit, <b>and</b> when <b>he stood up</b> after Shabbat had already commenced, <b>he saw that he was near the town,</b> i.e., within its limit, <b>since he had not intended</b> to acquire his place of residence in the town, <b>he may not enter</b> it, but rather he measures two thousand cubits from his place; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 21
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He may enter</b> the town. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: It once happened that Rabbi Tarfon entered</b> a town on Shabbat <b>without intention</b> from the beginning of Shabbat to establish residence in the city.

### Part 22
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: It once happened that Rabbi Tarfon was walking along the way</b> on Shabbat eve, <b>and night fell upon him, and he spent the night outside the town. In the morning, cowherds</b> who came to graze their cattle outside the town <b>found him</b> and <b>said to him: Master, the town is before you; enter. He entered and sat in the study hall and taught the entire day.</b> This indicates that one is permitted to enter.

### Part 23
The other Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: Do you bring <b>proof from there? Perhaps he had it in mind</b> the day before to acquire residence in the city, <b>or</b> perhaps <b>the study hall was subsumed within his</b> Shabbat <b>limit.</b> If the study hall was within two thousand cubits of the spot where he established residence, all agree that he may enter there.

### Part 24
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who was sleeping along the road</b> on Shabbat eve <b>and did not know that night had fallen, he has two thousand cubits in each direction;</b> this is the statement of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri,</b> who maintains that knowledge and awareness are not necessary for one to acquire residence, but rather, a person’s presence in a given location establishes residence there.

### Part 25
<b>But the Rabbis say: He has only four cubits,</b> as since he did not knowingly acquire residence, he did not establish a Shabbat limit. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> He has only four cubits total <b>and he is in the middle of them,</b> i.e., he has two cubits in each direction.

### Part 26
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He may walk</b> four cubits <b>in any direction he wishes. But Rabbi Yehuda agrees that if he selected for himself</b> the direction in which he wants to walk those four cubits, <b>he cannot retract</b> and walk four cubits in a different direction.

### Part 27
With regard to a case where <b>there were two</b> people in this situation, positioned in such a way that <b>part</b> of <b>the</b> four <b>cubits of one were subsumed within the</b> four <b>cubits of the other, they may</b> each <b>bring</b> food <b>and eat</b> together in the shared area <b>in the middle,</b>
