### Part 1
The Gemara answers: This mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said</b> that in order to permit carrying in a courtyard that was breached, <b>we require two</b> upright <b>boards,</b> one on either side of the breach. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a courtyard</b> was breached and opens into the public domain, and the width of the breach does not exceed ten cubits, it <b>becomes permitted</b> to carry there, even <b>with</b> only <b>one</b> upright <b>board</b> remaining on one side of the breach. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It is permitted only <b>with two</b> upright <b>boards</b> remaining, one on each side of the breach.

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this entire explanation: <b>What is this</b> comparison? <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the legal status of a side post that is <b>visible from the outside but</b> appears to be <b>even</b> with the wall <b>from the inside is not considered</b> like that of <b>a side post; and</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> that a side post or an upright board in a courtyard must be at least three handbreadths wide; <b>and that</b> the explanations of the mishna offered earlier by <b>Rabbi Zeira and Ravina are not</b> accepted; <b>that is why</b> there is significance to the fact that the <b>small</b> courtyard is <b>ten</b> cubits wide and the <b>large one is eleven</b> cubits wide. It is <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> Since Rabbi Yosei holds that a side post must be three handbreadths wide, we require that the two upright boards together measure six handbreadths, i.e., one cubit, which is the minimal difference in size between the two courtyards.

### Part 3
<b>However, if you say</b> that the legal status of a side post that is <b>visible from the outside but</b> appears to be <b>even</b> with the wall <b>from the inside is considered</b> like that of <b>a side post; and</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira’s and Ravina’s</b> explanations <b>are</b> accepted as <i>halakha</i>; and that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>does not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>Rabbi Yosei, why do I</b> need to explain that the <b>large</b> courtyard measures <b>eleven</b> cubits?

### Part 4
<b>Whichever way</b> you look at it, there is a difficulty: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is coming to permit</b> one to carry in <b>the large</b> courtyard, then a width <b>of ten</b> cubits <b>and two handbreadths suffices.</b> These two handbreadths can be considered the upright boards that render the courtyard fit for one to carry within it. <b>And if it is coming to</b> teach a novel <i>halakha</i> according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and <b>prohibit</b> one to carry in <b>the small</b> courtyard, <b>it should teach us</b> a case where the walls of the two courtyards are much <b>farther removed</b> from each other, rather than a case where they are only one cubit apart. Therefore, the second explanation cannot be accepted.

### Part 5
<b>Rather, can we not conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that a side post that is <b>visible from the outside but</b> appears to be <b>even</b> with the wall <b>from the inside is not considered</b> to have the legal status of <b>a side post?</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from this.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Yosef said: I did not hear this <i>halakha</i></b> of Rabba bar Rav Huna from my teachers. Rav Yosef had become ill and forgotten his learning, which is why he could not recall the <i>halakha</i> that a side post that is visible from the outside is considered to have the legal status of a side post.

### Part 7
His student <b>Abaye said to him: You</b> yourself <b>told us</b> this <i>halakha</i>, <b>and</b> it was <b>with regard to this</b> that <b>you told</b> it to <b>us. As Rami bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to <b>a side post that extends along the wall of an alleyway</b> and beyond, in which case it appears from the inside to be a continuation of the wall but due to its narrow width it is clearly visible as a side post from the outside, if that side post is <b>less than four cubits</b> long <b>it is considered</b> to have the legal status <b>of a side post. And one may use</b> the alleyway <b>up to the inner edge</b> of the side post. However, if the side post itself extends <b>four cubits,</b> the alleyway has no side post and <b>it is considered to</b> have the legal status <b>of an alleyway, and it is prohibited to utilize the entire</b> alleyway.

### Part 8
<b>And you said to us about this: Learn from this</b> statement <b>three</b> <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <i>eiruvin</i>. <b>Learn from it</b> that in the area <b>between the side posts it is prohibited</b> to carry, as Rav Huna rules that one may use the alleyway only up to the inner edge of the side post. <b>And learn from it</b> that the minimal <b>length of an alleyway is four</b> cubits. <b>And learn from it</b> that a side post that is <b>visible from the outside but</b> appears to be <b>even</b> with the wall of the alleyway <b>from the inside is considered</b> to have the legal status <b>of a side post.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara concludes: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b> is that a side post that is <b>visible from the outside but</b> appears to be <b>even</b> with the wall <b>from the inside is considered</b> to have the legal status <b>of a side post.</b> The Gemara asks: It is possible that there is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of this opinion, <b>and</b> it is also <b>the <i>halakha</i>?</b> This opinion was refuted earlier. Can the <i>halakha</i> then be decided in accordance with it?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> it can <b>because Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with it.</b> Although the deductive analysis of the statements of other <i>tanna’im</i> led to different conclusions, the <i>halakha</i> relies on Rabbi Ḥiyya’s explicit statement.

### Part 11
The opening mishna states: If the entrance to an alleyway is <b>wider than ten</b> cubits, <b>one must diminish</b> its width. <b>Abaye said</b> that a Sage <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: If the entrance to an alleyway <b>is wider than ten</b> cubits, <b>one must diminish</b> its width. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He need not diminish it.</b> The question arises: <b>Until what</b> width does Rabbi Yehuda still permit carrying in the alleyway?

### Part 12
Initially, <b>Rav Aḥai thought to say before Rav Yosef: Up to thirteen and a third cubits. And</b> he derived this figure through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> argument <b>from</b> upright <b>boards surrounding a well.</b> Rabbi Yehuda maintains that if one placed upright boards up to thirteen and a third cubits apart from one another, he may consider the partitioned area around the well as a private domain and therefore carry within it.

### Part 13
Rav Aḥai explains: <b>Just as</b> in the case of upright <b>boards surrounding a well, where you permitted</b> carrying, even though the boards form a partition where the <b>breached</b> segment <b>is greater than the standing</b> segment, <b>you did not permit</b> carrying <b>within them</b> if the gap between the boards is <b>more than thirteen and a third cubits</b> wide; in the case of <b>an alleyway, where you did not permit</b> carrying if the <b>breached</b> segment of its walls <b>is greater than the standing</b> segment, <b>is it not right that you will not permit</b> carrying <b>within it</b> if there is a gap <b>more than thirteen and a third cubits</b> wide?

### Part 14
<b>But that</b> reasoning <b>provides</b> support for a contrary conclusion as well. Just as in the case of upright <b>boards surrounding a well, where you permitted</b> carrying <b>within them,</b> even though the boards form a partition where the <b>breached</b> segment <b>is greater than the standing</b> segment, <b>you will not</b> extend the leniency and <b>permit</b> carrying <b>within them,</b> when the gap between the boards is <b>more than thirteen and a third cubits;</b> in <b>an alleyway, where you</b> were stringent and <b>did not permit</b> carrying when the <b>breached</b> segment <b>is greater than the standing</b> segment, in a case where most of the walls are standing, <b>you will</b> certainly <b>permit</b> carrying, even when the gap is <b>more than thirteen and a third cubits.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Alternatively,</b> one may argue <b>to the contrary.</b> One should be more stringent in the case of an alleyway. In the case of upright <b>boards surrounding a well, with regard to which you were lenient</b> and issued <b>one leniency, be lenient and</b> issue <b>another leniency</b> and maintain that a gap of up to thirteen and a third cubits still be considered an entrance. However, in the case of <b>an alleyway,</b> you should <b>not</b> be lenient <b>at all.</b> Therefore, there is no way to determine Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion with regard to the width of an alleyway entrance.

### Part 16
<b>Levi taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> with regard to reducing the width of an alleyway in order to render it fit for one to carry within it. If <b>an alleyway is twenty cubits wide, one may stick a reed in</b> the <b>center</b> of its entrance <b>and</b> that is <b>sufficient</b> to create two separate alleyways, each ten cubits wide. <b>He taught</b> this <i>baraita</i>, <b>and he said</b> about <b>it that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with that teaching,</b> as the insertion of a reed is not effective in reducing the width. <b>Some say</b> that <b>Shmuel said in the name of Levi: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with that teaching.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, how should one act</b> in order to render an alleyway of that sort fit for one to carry within it? <b>Shmuel said in the name of Levi:</b>
