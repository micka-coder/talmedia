### Part 1
if it was breached <b>from its side,</b> the side wall of the alleyway, carrying within the alleyway is prohibited if the breach is <b>ten</b> cubits wide. But if it was breached <b>from its front,</b> the wall that faces the public domain, carrying within the alleyway is prohibited even if the breach is only <b>four</b> handbreadths wide.

### Part 2
The Gemara poses a question: <b>What is the difference</b> such that carrying is prohibited due to a breach <b>from the side</b> only if the breach is <b>ten</b> cubits? This is <b>because</b> you <b>say</b> that up to ten cubits <b>it is</b> deemed <b>an entrance.</b> If the breach is <b>in the front, let us also say it is an entrance,</b> and carrying should be permitted if the breach is less than ten cubits.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> We are dealing with <b>a case where the breach is in a corner.</b> Since <b>people do not make an entrance in a corner,</b> a breach of this kind cannot be viewed as an entrance, and if the breach is larger than four handbreadths it must be sealed.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Huna</b> disagreed with Rav Ḥanin bar Rava and <b>said:</b> There is no distinction between the side and the front, for in <b>both this</b> case <b>and that,</b> a breach of up to <b>four</b> handbreadths is allowed. <b>And so Rav Huna said to Rav Ḥanan bar Rava: Do not dispute me, as Rav</b> himself <b>arrived at</b> a place called <b>Damḥarya and performed an action,</b> i.e., issued a practical ruling, <b>in accordance with my</b> opinion. Rav Ḥanan bar Rava <b>said</b> in response <b>to him:</b> No proof can be brought from that incident, for in that case <b>Rav found an</b> unguarded <b>valley and fenced it in,</b> i.e., Rav saw the need to add a safeguard and was therefore stringent in this case. His ruling, however, was not generally applied.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Rav Huna’s opinion stands to reason, as it was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagree about the following issue: With regard to <b>a crooked,</b> L-shaped <b>alleyway</b> that opens onto the public domain at both ends, <b>Rav said: Its law is like</b> that of an alleyway that is <b>open</b> on two opposite sides, and it must be treated in a manner suitable for such an alleyway, i.e., an opening in the form of a doorway must be constructed at both ends, or else such an opening must be constructed at the point where the two arms of the alleyway meet and a side post or a cross beam must be placed at each end. <b>And Shmuel said: Its law is like</b> that of an alleyway that is <b>closed</b> on one side, and all that is necessary is a side post or a cross beam at each end.

### Part 6
The Gemara clarifies the particular circumstances of the case: <b>With what are we dealing? If you say</b> that the width of the alleyway at the point of the turn is <b>more than ten</b> cubits wide, <b>in this</b> case, <b>would Shmuel say that its law is like</b> that of an alleyway that is <b>closed</b> on one side? With an opening of that size, it must be considered like an alleyway that is open on both ends.

### Part 7
<b>Rather, are we not</b> dealing with a case where the width of the alleyway at the point of the turn is <b>ten</b> cubits or less, <b>and Rav</b> nonetheless <b>said</b> that <b>the law</b> of such an alleyway <b>is like that of</b> an alleyway that is <b>open</b> on both ends. <b>Apparently, a breach in the side</b> wall <b>of an alleyway</b> renders it prohibited to carry even if it is only <b>four</b> handbreadths wide, in accordance with the opinion of Rav Huna.

### Part 8
<b>And Rav Ḥanan bar Rava</b> argues that the cases cannot be compared: <b>It is different there,</b> in the case of the L-shaped alleyway, <b>for many people cross through</b> the opening from one arm to the other. Since in practice the alleyway is open to regular traffic, the ruling is stringent even with regard to a small breach.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: Can it be <b>inferred</b> from this <b>that Rav Huna holds</b> that <b>even if many people</b> do <b>not cross through</b> the opening, a breach of four handbreadths still prohibits carrying? <b>What is the difference</b> between this case and the case of the ruling of <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> cited earlier, that an upright board of four handbreadths suffices in order to allow a breach of up to ten cubits?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>There, there are remnants of a wall</b> that render it difficult to pass through the breach, and therefore that breach does not annul the partitions. However, <b>here, there are no remnants of a wall.</b>

### Part 11
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How does one render a public thoroughfare fit</b> for carrying <b>by</b> means of <b>an <i>eiruv</i>? He constructs an</b> opening in the <b>form of a doorway from here,</b> on one side of the thoroughfare, <b>and a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam from here,</b> on the other side. <b>Ḥananya</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> This is the subject of an early dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>, for <b>Beit Shammai say: He constructs a door from here,</b> on one side, <b>and a door from here,</b> on the other side, <b>and when he exits and enters, he must lock</b> the door. It is not sufficient to construct a symbolic door; rather, there must be a door that actually closes. And <b>Beit Hillel say: He constructs a door from here,</b> on one side, <b>and a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam from here,</b> on the other side.

### Part 12
The Gemara raises a fundamental question: <b>Can a public domain be rendered fit</b> for carrying <b>by</b> means of <b>an <i>eiruv</i>? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said:</b>
