### Part 1
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the residents of</b> houses that open directly into <b>a courtyard and the residents of</b> upper stories that open onto <b>a balcony</b> from which stairs lead down to that courtyard, <b>who forgot and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> between them, <b>anything ten handbreadths high</b> in the courtyard, e.g., a mound or a pillar, is attributed <b>to the balcony</b> in terms of its use on Shabbat. The residents of the balcony may move objects between the mound or pillar and their apartments. Anything <b>lower than that</b> is attributed <b>to the courtyard. In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that it is prohibited for the residents of the courtyard to carry to the balcony and vice versa, <b>stated?</b> It is in a case <b>where</b> the residents of the courtyard <b>were many, and</b> the residents of the balcony were <b>many, and these established an <i>eiruv</i> for themselves, and those established an <i>eiruv</i> for themselves; or</b> if the courtyard and the balcony were occupied by <b>individuals who need not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> for themselves.

### Part 2
<b>However,</b> if the residents of the courtyard and the balcony <b>were many, and they forgot and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> for their courtyard or balcony, in that case <b>roof, and courtyard, and portico, and balcony are all one domain,</b> and it is permitted to carry from one to another any vessels that were located in any one of them when Shabbat began.

### Part 3
The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that carrying between them is permitted is <b>that they did not</b> each <b>establish</b> their own <b><i>eiruv</i>;</b> however, if <b>they</b> each <b>established</b> their own <b><i>eiruv</i>, no,</b> it is prohibited to carry between them. This inference supports Rav and poses a difficulty for Shmuel. The Gemara answers: <b>Whose</b> opinion is represented by <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> that of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that roofs and courtyards form a single domain, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. The Rabbis indeed issued a decree that carrying is prohibited if each group established a separate <i>eiruv</i>.

### Part 4
The Gemara comments: The language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise, as it is not teaching</b> the cases of <b>an enclosure and an alleyway,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, but only the cases of a roof and a courtyard, in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that this is the correct understanding.

### Part 5
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>five courtyards that are open to each other and are</b> also <b>open to an alleyway, and</b> the residents of <b>all</b> the courtyards <b>forgot and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>, it is prohibited to carry in or carry out, from a courtyard to the alleyway or from the alleyway to a courtyard. And</b> with regard to <b>vessels that were in the courtyard</b> when <b>Shabbat</b> began, <b>it is permitted to carry them in the courtyard, but in the alleyway it is prohibited</b> to carry them.

### Part 6
<b>And Rabbi Shimon permits</b> doing so, <b>as Rabbi Shimon would say: Whenever</b> the courtyards <b>are</b> in the possession <b>of many</b> people, <b>and they forgot and did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> the <b>roof, and courtyard, and portico, and balcony, and enclosure, and alleyway are all one domain.</b> These areas are all classified as private domains, and therefore, it is permitted to carry from one to the other.

### Part 7
The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that carrying between them is permitted is <b>that they did not</b> each <b>establish</b> their own <b><i>eiruv</i>;</b> however, if <b>they</b> each <b>established</b> their own <b><i>eiruv</i>, no,</b> it is prohibited to carry between them. This inference supports Rav and poses a difficulty for Shmuel. The Gemara answers: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>They did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>?</b> It means that the residents of the <b>courtyards did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with each other; however, the</b> residents of each <b>courtyard established an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the residents of <b>the houses</b> inside it, and it is nevertheless permitted to carry between them, in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel.

### Part 8
The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>But doesnâ€™t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>state: They did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> indicating that they did not establish any <i>eiruv</i> at all, either with the residents of the other courtyard or within each courtyard? The Gemara rejects this argument. <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>They did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>?</b> It means that <b>they did not merge</b> the courtyards facing the alleyway.

### Part 9
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Rabbi Shimon is speaking to the Rabbis in accordance with their</b> own <b>opinion,</b> not enumerating the leniencies inherent in his own ruling. His statement should therefore be understood as follows: <b>According to my own</b> opinion, <b>there is no difference</b> if <b>they established an <i>eiruv</i> and there is no difference</b> if <b>they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>. However, according to your</b> opinion, <b>agree with me at least that</b> in a case <b>where they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> it is</b> all considered <b>one domain.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And the Rabbis said to him: No,</b> although we agree with you in the cases of a roof, courtyard, portico, and balcony, in the cases of an enclosure and an alleyway we disagree, as <b>they are two domains</b> and therefore it is prohibited to carry from one to the other.

### Part 11
<b>The Master said</b> above in the <i>baraita</i>: Vessels that were in a courtyard at the start of Shabbat may be carried within the courtyard, <b>but in the alleyway it is prohibited.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that this <b>supports that</b> which <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav said, as Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> In <b>an alleyway in which they did not merge</b> the courtyards facing it, <b>one may carry only within four cubits.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion. <b>Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means: <b>But to an alleyway it is prohibited,</b> i.e., it is prohibited to carry from the courtyard to the alleyway; however, within the alleyway itself it is permitted to carry.

### Part 12
The Gemara raises a difficulty. If so, <b>that is</b> identical to <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>. The <i>tanna</i> would not have taught the very same thing twice. The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> apparently <b>superfluous teaching was necessary, lest you say: When the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Shimon, it is only</b> in a case <b>where they established an <i>eiruv</i>, but</b> in a case <b>where they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> the Rabbis <b>concede to</b> Rabbi Meir that it is all considered one domain and carrying is permitted. The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Shimon in both cases, as they prohibit carrying in the alleyway even if the residents did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>.

### Part 13
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b>
