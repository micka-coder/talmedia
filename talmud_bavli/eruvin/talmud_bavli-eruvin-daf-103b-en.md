### Part 1
<b>What is</b> the source for this idea? <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a priest grew a wart,</b> which temporarily disqualifies him from performing the service, <b>his fellow</b> priest may <b>cut it off for him</b> on Shabbat <b>with his teeth.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>With his teeth, yes,</b> this is permitted; but <b>with an instrument, no,</b> he may not do so. Likewise, for <b>his fellow</b> priest, <b>yes,</b> he may cut off his wart; but <b>he</b> himself, <b>no,</b> he may not cut off his own wart.

### Part 2
The Gemara inquires: According to <b>whose</b> opinion was this <i>baraita</i> taught? <b>If you say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and</b> the leniency is based on the principle that a rabbinic prohibition does not apply <b>in the Temple, since the Rabbis say in general</b> that biting off even one’s own nails or wart, and certainly those of another, is prohibited <b>due to rabbinic decree,</b> then in this case <b>here, what is</b> the difference <b>to me</b> whether it is the priest <b>himself</b> who cuts off the wart, or <b>what is</b> the difference <b>to me</b> whether it is <b>another</b> priest who cuts it off?

### Part 3
<b>Rather, wasn’t</b> it taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who <b>said</b> that <b>in general</b> one <b>is liable to</b> bring <b>a sin-offering</b> for biting off his own nails or wart? <b>And here, even though</b> he maintains that <b>preparations</b> for a <b>mitzva override</b> the prohibitions of <b>Shabbat,</b> and it should therefore be permitted for him to cut off his own wart with an instrument, nevertheless, <b>as much as it is possible to alter</b> the procedure so that it does not entail the violation of a Torah prohibition, <b>one alters,</b> and biting off another person’s wart is prohibited due to rabbinic decree, not Torah law.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>No,</b> this is not necessarily the case. <b>Actually,</b> this <i>baraita</i> can be explained in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, <b>and if</b> the wart <b>grew on his abdomen,</b> or anywhere else easily removable by hand, <b>so too,</b> it is clear that according to the Rabbis there is no difference between himself and his fellow priest, and he may remove it himself.

### Part 5
However, <b>here, we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where,</b> the priest <b>received a bite</b> that developed into a wart <b>on his back or on his elbow,</b> from <b>where he</b> himself <b>cannot remove it,</b> but someone else can.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But if</b> the <i>baraita</i> reflects the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> the other priest should be permitted to <b>remove</b> the wart <b>from him by hand,</b> rather than with an instrument, <b>and</b> therefore one should <b>resolve</b> the dilemma in accordance with the teaching of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar said: The dispute</b> between the Rabbis and Rabbi Eliezer with regard to the removal of one’s nails is limited to one who removed them <b>by hand, but</b> if he removed them <b>with an instrument, everyone agrees</b> that <b>he is liable</b> to bring a sin-offering.

### Part 7
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>And according to your reasoning, Rabbi Eliezer</b> should <b>also</b> agree <b>that he</b> should be permitted to <b>remove it for him by hand.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this comment: <b>What is</b> the nature of <b>this</b> contention? <b>Granted, if you say</b> that it was taught in accordance with <b>Rabbi Eliezer, this is</b> why removing the wart <b>by hand was decreed</b> prohibited <b>due to</b> a preventive measure, lest he remove it with <b>an instrument,</b> as he maintains that removing a wart with an instrument is prohibited by the Torah. <b>However, if you say it</b> is according to the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, he</b> should be permitted to <b>remove it for him by hand. And nothing more</b> need be said, as it is clear that the <i>baraita</i> was taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a priest who was injured on his finger</b> on Shabbat, <b>he</b> may temporarily <b>wrap it with a reed</b> so that his wound is not visible while he is serving in the Temple. This leniency applies <b>in the Temple, but not in the country,</b> as it also heals the wound, and medical treatment is prohibited on Shabbat due to rabbinic decree. <b>If</b> his intention <b>is to draw blood</b> from the wound or to absorb blood, <b>it is prohibited in both</b> places.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, said: They taught</b> that <b>only a reed</b> is permitted. <b>However, a small sash is</b> prohibited, as it would be <b>considered an extra garment,</b> and it is prohibited for a priest to add to the priestly garments prescribed by the Torah.

### Part 10
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They said</b> that donning an <b>extra garment</b> is prohibited <b>only</b> if it is worn <b>in a place</b> on the priest’s body where the priestly <b>garments</b> are worn. <b>But in a place</b> where those <b>garments</b> are <b>not</b> worn, e.g., on his hand or the like, a sash that is tied there <b>is not considered an extra garment.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And let him derive</b> that both the reed and the sash are prohibited <b>as an interposition.</b> As the reed and sash interpose between the priest’s hand and the holy vessel, they should invalidate the service. The Gemara rejects this contention: Perhaps the wound is <b>on</b> the priest’s <b>left</b> hand, while the entire service is performed exclusively with his right hand. Consequently, a bandage on his left hand is not an interposition.

### Part 12
<b>Alternatively,</b> it is possible that the wound is <b>on</b> the priest’s <b>right</b> hand, <b>but not in a place</b> used in the <b>service,</b> which means the bandage does not interpose between his hand and the holy vessels used in the Temple service.

### Part 13
And this conclusion <b>disputes</b> the opinion <b>of Rava, as Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said: In a place</b> on the priest’s body where the priestly <b>garments</b> are worn, <b>even one</b> extra <b>thread interposes</b> and is prohibited, whereas <b>in a place</b> where the priestly <b>garments</b> are <b>not</b> worn, if the fabric was <b>three</b> fingerbreadths <b>by three</b> fingerbreadths, <b>it interposes,</b> but if it was <b>less than three</b> fingerbreadths <b>by three</b> fingerbreadths, <b>it does not interpose.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara comments: This teaching <b>certainly disagrees with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> as he maintains that the prohibition against interpositions does not apply at all in a place on the priest’s body where the priestly garments are not worn. However, <b>shall we say that it</b> also <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who prohibits even a sash smaller than three by three fingerbreadths?

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: Nothing can be proven from here, as <b>a small sash is different, since it is significant,</b> and it is therefore considered a garment even if it is less than three by three fingerbreadths.

### Part 16
According to <b>another version, they reported</b> this dispute as follows: <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, said</b> that <b>they taught</b> this leniency <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a reed, but</b> that <b>a small sash interposes.</b>

### Part 17
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They said</b> that there is <b>interposition with regard to</b> an article that is <b>less than three by three</b> fingerbreadths <b>only in a place</b> where the priestly <b>garments</b> are worn. <b>However, in a place</b> where the priestly <b>garments</b> are <b>not</b> worn, the following distinction applies:
