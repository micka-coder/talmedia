### Part 1
<b>Ameimar said: This</b> ruling <b>applies only if</b> the water <b>is fit for</b> its regular <b>use,</b> i.e., for drinking, because in that case it provides for the needs of residence. <b>However,</b> if the water <b>is not fit for use,</b> then it is <b>not</b> considered like planted trees. Therefore, the <i>karpef</i> is no longer considered enclosed for the purpose of residence, and it is prohibited to carry in the <i>karpef</i>.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Ashi said: And</b> even where the water <b>is fit for use, this</b> ruling <b>applies only if</b> the water <b>is not</b> ten handbreadths <b>deep</b> over an area <b>greater than two <i>beit se’a</i>; but if</b> the water is ten handbreadths <b>deep</b> over an area <b>greater</b> than <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> it <b>is prohibited</b> to carry in it, as in such a case the <i>karpef</i> is no longer considered enclosed for the sake of dwelling.

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: <b>And it is not so, just as</b> it is <b>in</b> the case of <b>a pile of fruit,</b> as even if the pile of fruit is very large, the <i>karpef</i> does not lose its status as having been enclosed for the purpose of residence.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates: <b>There was a certain yard in</b> the town of <b>Pum Nahara</b> that was larger than two <i>beit se’a</i> and that had not been enclosed for the purpose of residence. <b>One of its sides opened to</b> an alleyway in <b>the town, and the other opened to a</b> walled <b>path between the vineyards, and</b> that <b>vineyard path led to the bank of a river</b> ten handbreadths high, which is considered a partition.

### Part 5
<b>Abaye said: What shall we do</b> to permit carrying in the yard, which is a <i>karmelit</i>, without having to make a breach in one of its walls wider than ten cubits and then fence it up again? <b>Shall we construct a partition for it on the river bank,</b> so that the vineyard path is surrounded by partitions on all sides? This is not a viable solution, as <b>one cannot construct an</b> effective <b>partition on top of another</b> partition that already exists, and the river bank is considered a partition relative to the river.

### Part 6
<b>Shall we arrange a doorframe at the mouth of the vineyard path?</b> That is also not an effective solution in this case, for <b>the camels</b> that walk down this path in order to drink water from the river <b>will come and knock it over.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rather, Abaye said: We should arrange a side post at the opening of the vineyard path</b> to the yard, <b>since as it is effective for the vineyard path,</b> to allow one to carry on the path, as it is no longer breached into a <i>karmelit</i>, <b>it is also effective for the yard,</b> and the side post will be considered an additional partition that renders it permitted to carry in the yard.

### Part 8
<b>Rava said to him:</b> If so, people <b>will say</b> that <b>a side post is effective</b> in permitting one to carry in <b>a vineyard path generally,</b> and this will cause the public to err, as vineyard paths are usually open at both ends and do not lead to a river or the like.

### Part 9
<b>Rather, Rava said: They should arrange a side post at the opening</b> of the yard <b>to the town, as since the side post is effective</b> and is considered a partition <b>for the town, it is also effective for the yard,</b> to permit one to carry within it.

### Part 10
<b>Therefore,</b> in summary, <b>it is permitted to carry within the town itself</b> and <b>to carry within the yard itself.</b> However, with regard to carrying <b>from the town to the yard or from the yard to the town, Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree: One prohibits</b> doing so <b>and the other permits</b> it.
