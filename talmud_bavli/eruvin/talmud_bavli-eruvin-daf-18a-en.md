### Part 1
<b>to distance</b> the boards from the well and expand the enclosed area by <b>any amount,</b> i.e., as much as one wishes, <b>provided that he increases the</b> number of upright <b>boards</b> between the double posts. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The partitioned area may be expanded <b>up to</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> which is an area of five thousand square cubits.

### Part 2
The Rabbis <b>said to him: They only spoke of</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i> with regard to a garden or an enclosure</b> used for storing wood, scrap, and the like <b>[<i>karpef</i>]. But if it was a pen [<i>dir</i>], or a stable [<i>sahar</i>], or a backyard, or a courtyard</b> in front of the house, <b>even</b> if it had an area of <b>five <i>beit kor</i></b> or <b>even ten <i>beit kor</i>, it is permitted. And it is permitted to distance</b> the boards and expand the enclosed area <b>by any amount, provided that one increases the</b> upright <b>boards</b> between the double posts.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may arrange</b> upright <b>boards around a</b> water <b>cistern and ropes around a caravan. Ḥananya</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> One may set up <b>ropes for a cistern, but not</b> upright <b>boards.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Even if you say</b> that the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Ḥananya, a cistern</b> of collected rain water has a <b>discrete</b> law, as the water will eventually be consumed and the upright boards will become unnecessary; and <b>a well</b> of spring <b>water</b> has a <b>discrete</b> law, as the water is constantly renewed and the upright boards will remain useful.

### Part 5
<b>Some say</b> a different version of the previous passage: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>does not teach: Ḥananya says: One may set up ropes around</b> a water <b>cistern and boards around a well, by inference, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya, there is no difference between a cistern and a well.</b> In both cases, <b>ropes</b> are <b>indeed</b> permitted, whereas upright <b>boards are not. Let us say the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Even if you say</b> that the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Ḥananya,</b> he was only replying <b>to that which the first <i>tanna</i> had said;</b> since the first <i>tanna</i> had spoken only of a cistern, there was no need for Ḥananya to fully clarify his own position and distinguish between a cistern and a well.

### Part 7
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Let us say the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. As we learned</b> in a mishna: In <b>each of</b> the cases of <b>a public well, a public cistern, and a private well, one may arrange</b> upright <b>boards for them, but</b> in the case of <b>a private cistern, one must establish</b> a proper <b>partition for it ten handbreadths high;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Whereas here</b> in the mishna <b>it teaches:</b> One may arrange upright boards <b>for a well,</b> from which one may infer that <b>for a well, yes,</b> it is permitted to use posts, but <b>for a cistern, no,</b> it is not permitted. This is opposed to Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, which maintains that posts may be arranged for a public cistern.

### Part 9
The Gemara rejects this argument as well: <b>Even if you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> the case of <b>a well of spring water, which he</b> can teach in <b>a distinct</b> manner because <b>there is no difference</b> whether it belongs to <b>the public and there is no difference</b> whether it belongs <b>to an individual,</b> as it is always permitted. However, <b>he did not teach</b> the case of <b>a cistern</b> containing <b>collected</b> rain water, <b>which he</b> could <b>not</b> teach in a <b>distinct</b> manner because there is a difference between a public cistern and a private one. However, it cannot be proven from here that he disagrees with Rabbi Akiva.

### Part 10
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Let us say the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava says: One may only arrange</b> upright <b>boards for a public well, whereas here</b> the mishna <b>states: For wells.</b> The plural term implies that <b>there is no difference</b> if the well belongs to <b>the public, and there is no difference</b> if the well belongs <b>to an individual.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara also rejects this line of reasoning: <b>Even if you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava,</b> to <b>what</b> is the mishna referring when it says <b>wells?</b> It is referring to <b>wells in general,</b> but the <i>tanna</i> means to include only public wells.

### Part 12
The mishna had mentioned double posts [<i>deyomadin</i>]: The Gemara asks: <b>What are <i>deyomadin</i>? Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar said: Two [<i>deyo</i>] posts [<i>amudin</i>],</b> which are put together to create a single corner piece.

### Part 13
Having cited Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar’s statement with reference to the prefix <i>deyo</i>, the Gemara cites other statements of his. <b>Two, to</b> one who was <b>ostracized, praise, nourishment, ruin, attribute, three,</b> are <b>mnemonics</b> for the following statements by Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar.

### Part 14
<b>We learned there</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: All inferior figs are exempt</b> from being tithed, even if they are of doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>], as even if the seller is an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, he must certainly have already separated tithes from them, since the loss incurred by tithing is negligible, <b>except for <i>deyufra</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>deyufra</i>? Ulla said: A tree that yields two [<i>deyo</i>]</b> harvests <b>of fruit [<i>peirot</i>] each year.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar</b> also <b>said: Adam</b> was first created with <b>two [<i>deyo</i>] faces,</b> one male and the other female. <b>As it is stated: “You have formed me behind and before,</b> and laid Your hand upon me” (Psalms 139:5). Similarly, <b>it is written: “And the <i>tzela</i>, which</b> the Lord, God, had taken from the man, <b>He made</b> a woman, and brought her unto the man” (Genesis 2:22). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree over the meaning of the word <i>tzela</i>: <b>One said:</b> It means a female <b>face,</b> from which God created Eve; <b>and one said:</b> Adam was created with <b>a tail [<i>zanav</i>],</b> which God removed from him and from which He created Eve.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <i>tzela</i> means <b>face;</b> it is understandable <b>that it is written: “You have formed me [<i>tzartani</i>] behind and before.” However, according to the one who says</b> that <i>tzela</i> means <b>tail, what is</b> meant by the verse: <b>“You have formed me [<i>tzartani</i>] behind and before”?</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara answers that this verse is to be understood as bearing a moral message, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ami, as Rabbi Ami said: Behind</b> means Adam was created at the end of <b>the act of creation; and before</b> means that he was first <b>for punishment.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> it is understandable that Adam was <b>behind,</b> or last, <b>in the act of creation,</b> meaning that <b>he was not created until</b> the sixth day, <b>Shabbat eve. However, before,</b> or first, <b>for punishment, what</b> does <b>this</b> mean? <b>If you say</b> that he was punished first <b>because of the curse</b> pronounced in the wake of the sin involving the Tree of Knowledge, there is a difficulty. <b>Wasn’t the snake was cursed first, and afterward Eve was cursed, and</b> only <b>at the end was Adam cursed?</b>

### Part 19
<b>Rather,</b> this refers <b>to</b> the punishment of the <b>Flood, as it is written: “And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle,</b> creeping things and fowl of the heaven” (Genesis 7:23). This indicates that the punishment began with man.

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was originally <b>a face</b> or side of Adam; it is understandable <b>that it is written:</b> “Then the Lord God <b>formed [<i>vayyitzer</i>]</b> man” (Genesis 2:7). <i>Vayyitzer</i> is written with <b>a double <i>yod</i>,</b> one for Adam and one for Eve. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was created from <b>a tail, what is</b> conveyed by spelling <b><i>vayyitzer</i></b> with a double <i>yod</i>?

### Part 21
The Gemara responds: This is interpreted homiletically, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, as Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said:</b> This comes to emphasize that which one says to himself in every circumstance: <b>Woe unto me from my</b> evil <b>inclination [<i>yetzer</i>]</b> if I perform the will of my Maker, <b>and woe to me from my Maker [<i>Yotzri</i>]</b> if I perform the will of my inclination.

### Part 22
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was <b>a face,</b> it is understandable <b>that it is written: “Male and female, He created them,</b> and blessed them, and called their name Man in the day when they were created” (Genesis 5:2), which indicates that from the very beginning of their creation, He fashioned two faces, one for the male and the other for the female. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was created from <b>a tail, what is</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“Male and female, He created them”?</b>

### Part 23
The Gemara answers: It can be explained <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abbahu, as Rabbi Abbahu raised a contradiction</b> between the verses: On the one hand <b>it is written: “Male and female, He created them,”</b> in the plural, <b>and</b> on the other hand <b>it is written:</b> “So God created man in His own image, <b>for in the image of God He created him”</b> (Genesis 1:27), in the singular. <b>At first, the thought entered</b> God’s mind <b>to create two, and ultimately, only one was</b> actually <b>created.</b>

### Part 24
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was <b>a face,</b> it is understandable <b>that it is written:</b> “And He took one of his sides <b>and closed up the flesh in its place”</b> (Genesis 2:21). <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was created from <b>a tail, what is</b> meant by the verse: <b>“And He closed up the flesh in its place”?</b>

### Part 25
<b>Rav Zevid said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yirmeya, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak: It was necessary</b> to say that the fleshed closed up <b>only with regard to the place of the incision.</b>

### Part 26
The Gemara challenges the other opinion: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was created from <b>a tail;</b> it is understandable <b>that it is written: “And</b> the Lord God <b>built</b> the <i>tzela</i>” (Genesis 2:22), as it was a completely new building. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that Eve was a complete <b>face</b> or side, <b>what is</b> the meaning of: <b>“And He built”?</b> What needed to be built?

### Part 27
The Gemara responds: This must be interpreted homiletically, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya, as Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya interpreted homiletically</b> the verse: <b>“And the Lord God built the <i>tzela</i>.”</b> This verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, braided for Eve</b> her hair, <b>and</b> then <b>brought her to Adam, as in the coastal towns, they call braiding</b> hair <b>building.</b>

### Part 28
<b>Alternatively,</b> the verse: <b>“And the Lord God built,”</b> can be understood as a description of Eve’s basic shape, as <b>Rav Ḥisda said, and some say it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> This verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, built Eve like the structure</b>
