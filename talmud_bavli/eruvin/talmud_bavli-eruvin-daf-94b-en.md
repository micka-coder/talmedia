### Part 1
<b>and</b> with a case <b>where</b> the courtyard <b>was breached in a corner,</b> so that it is breached on two sides. Although the opening is no more than ten cubits wide, it cannot be considered an entrance, <b>as people do not build an entrance in a corner.</b> It is therefore clear that this is a breach that negates the partition.

### Part 2
We learned in the mishna: <b>And likewise,</b> with regard to <b>a house that was breached</b> on Shabbat <b>from two of its sides</b> into a public domain, the residents are permitted to carry in the house on that Shabbat, but not a future Shabbat. The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> a breach <b>on one side different?</b> The difference is due to the fact <b>that we say: The edge of the roof descends and seals</b> the house, as if there were a full-fledged partition there. <b>So too,</b> when it is breached <b>on two sides, let us say: The edge of the roof descends and seals.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> Sages of the <b>school of Rav said in the name of Rav:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the house <b>was breached in a corner, and its roofing was inclined, as</b> in that case, <b>one cannot say: The edge of the roof descends and seals,</b> as the edge of an inclined roof does not appear to be the beginning of a partition.

### Part 4
<b>And Shmuel said:</b> The mishna is referring to a breach that is <b>even wider than ten</b> cubits. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why did the mishna cite a case where it is breached from two sides? It should be prohibited to carry there <b>even</b> if it were breached <b>from one side.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: The reason that it is prohibited only if it is breached from two sides is <b>due to</b> the fact that it is <b>a house.</b> In the case of a courtyard, the same <i>halakha</i> would apply even if it were breached on only one side. However, the mishna sought to teach the <i>halakha</i> of a house as well, in which case, it is prohibited to carry only if it is breached on two sides. If it is breached on one side, the edge of the roof descends and seals, and carrying is permitted.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a house itself should pose a difficulty</b> according to this explanation. In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> a breach <b>on one side different?</b> It is due to the fact <b>that we say: The edge of the roof descends and seals</b> the house, as if there were a full-fledged partition there. <b>So too,</b> when it is breached <b>on two sides, let us say: The edge of the roof descends and seals.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And furthermore: Is Shmuel of</b> the opinion that there is a principle: <b>The edge of a roof descends and seals? But wasn’t it stated</b> that there is an amoraic dispute with regard to a <b>portico</b> located <b>in a valley,</b> which has the status of a <i>karmelit</i>. <b>Rav said:</b> It <b>is permitted to carry in the entire</b> portico, as he maintains that the edge of the roof of the portico descends and seals, rendering it a private domain. <b>And Shmuel said: One may carry only within four cubits.</b> Apparently, Shmuel does not accept the principle: The edge of a roof descends and seals.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not a difficulty. Where</b> Shmuel <b>is not of</b> the opinion that this principle is applied, it is <b>with regard to</b> a structure where walls on all <b>four</b> sides are formed in that manner. <b>However, with regard to</b> a structure where only <b>three</b> sides are formed in that manner and the fourth side is an actual wall, <b>he is of</b> the opinion that the principle is applied.

### Part 9
The Gemara comments: <b>In any case,</b> this is <b>difficult.</b> Although the contradiction between the two statements of Shmuel was resolved, the question remains: Why do we not apply the principle: The edge of a roof descends and seals, to two sides of the house?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: The reason is <b>as the</b> Sages of the <b>school of Rav said in the name of Rav:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the house <b>was breached in a corner, and its roofing was inclined,</b> as in that case, one cannot say: The roof of the house descends and seals. <b>Here too,</b> Shmuel’s opinion can be explained in a similar manner: The mishna is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the house <b>was breached in a corner, and its roof is</b> at a distance <b>of</b> at least <b>four</b> handbreadths from the breach, and is uneven. In that case, the principle: The edge of a roof descends and seals, would have to be applied to four corners, and Shmuel is of the opinion that it may not be applied in that case.

### Part 11
The Gemara explains: <b>Shmuel did not say</b> his explanation of the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, as</b> the mishna <b>does not teach</b> that the roof was <b>slanted,</b> which is the crux of Rav’s explanation. <b>And Rav did not say</b> his explanation of the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> as <b>if so,</b> even if the roof was breached on several sides, <b>its</b> legal status would be that of <b>a portico, and Rav</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he said:</b> With regard to <b>a portico, it is permitted to carry throughout the entire</b> portico.

### Part 12
The Gemara proceeds to cite the dispute between Rav and Shmuel in a more comprehensive manner. <b>As it was stated</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> It <b>is permitted to carry in the entire</b> portico as it is considered sealed. <b>And Shmuel said: One may carry only within four cubits.</b> As the portico does not have actual partitions it is subsumed into the field, and shares its status of a <i>karmelit</i>.

### Part 13
The Gemara elaborates on their respective opinions. <b>Rav said: It is permitted to carry in the entire</b> portico, as he maintains that <b>we say: The edge of the roof descends and seals</b> the portico to form a partition. As there is a roof over the portico, it is considered sealed with partitions on all four sides. <b>And Shmuel said: One may carry only within four cubits,</b> as <b>we do not say: The edge of the ceiling descends and seals.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara elaborates further: If the openings on the sides of the portico are no wider than <b>ten</b> cubits, <b>everyone agrees</b> that they are considered sealed, as the status of even an unroofed breach of ten cubits or less is that of an entrance, and one is permitted to carry throughout the entire domain. <b>They disagree</b> only in a case <b>where</b> the openings are <b>more than ten</b> cubits wide.

### Part 15
<b>And some say:</b> On the contrary, if the openings are <b>more</b> than ten cubits wide, <b>everyone agrees</b> that they are considered breaches, and the principle: The edge of the roof descends and seals, is not applied. <b>They disagree</b> only in a case <b>where</b> the openings are no wider than <b>ten</b> cubits.

### Part 16
<b>And that which Rav Yehuda said:</b>
