### Part 1
<b>its incline does not extend a handbreadth</b> from the center to each side. <b>However, if its incline extends a handbreadth</b> from the center to the side, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>the inclines of tents are considered like tents,</b> and it is therefore prohibited to suspend them.

### Part 2
<b>And Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> With regard to a stiff <b>felt hat [<i>sayna</i>], it is permitted</b> to wear it on Shabbat. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that wearing this hat <b>is prohibited?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which prohibits wearing a felt hat, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the hat extends <b>a handbreadth</b> from the person’s head and is therefore regarded as a tent; whereas <b>that</b> statement by Rav Sheisha, who permits doing so, is referring to a case <b>where it does not</b> extend <b>a handbreadth</b> from one’s head.

### Part 3
The Gemara is surprised at this answer: <b>But if that is so,</b> one who <b>pulled his cloak a handbreadth</b> beyond his head, <b>is it also prohibited</b> for him to do so? This is unreasonable, as it is an article of clothing, not a tent.

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> the previous explanation must be rejected, as the issue with regard to a felt hat is not whether it is considered a tent, but whether there is concern that one might come to carry it in the public domain if it falls from his head. This is <b>not difficult; this</b> statement of Rav Sheisha, which permits it, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the hat <b>fits snugly</b> on his head. There is no concern lest the hat fall and one will come to carry it; therefore it is permitted to wear it. Conversely, <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which prohibits wearing this hat, is referring to a case <b>where it does not fit snugly</b> on his head. It is therefore liable to fall, and one might come to carry it in the public domain.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One</b> may <b>restore</b> the <b>lower hinge pin</b> of the door of a carriage, box, or cupboard that becomes dislocated to its place on Shabbat <b>in the Temple,</b> as this action is prohibited by rabbinic decree, which is not in effect in the Temple; <b>but</b> it may <b>not</b> be restored to its place <b>in</b> the rest of <b>the country. And</b> restoring <b>the upper</b> hinge pin <b>is prohibited in both</b> places, as this is considered building, a labor prohibited by Torah law, which applies everywhere. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Restoring <b>the upper</b> hinge pin to its place is permitted <b>in the Temple, while</b> one may restore <b>the lower one</b> to its place even <b>in</b> the rest of <b>the country.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the lower <b>hinge pin of the door of a carriage, box, or cupboard, one</b> may <b>restore</b> it to its place <b>in the Temple; in the</b> rest of the <b>country one</b> may only push it <b>back</b> into place, provided that it did not come out of its socket entirely. As for <b>the upper</b> hinge, <b>one</b> may <b>not restore</b> it <b>in either</b> place. This is prohibited as <b>a preventive measure, lest</b> one come to <b>bang</b> it in forcefully, thereby performing an actual labor prohibited by Torah law. <b>And if he</b> actually <b>banged</b> it in, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering,</b> as his action is considered building.

### Part 7
With regard to the hinge pin of the door of <b>a pit, cistern, or an extension</b> to a building, <b>one</b> may <b>not restore</b> it to its place at all. <b>And if</b> one <b>restored</b> it to its place, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> The above distinction applies only to movable utensils, whereas anything attached to the ground may certainly not be fixed in place, as this is regarded as prohibited building.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One</b> may <b>return</b> to its place <b>a bandage</b> that became detached from a wound on Shabbat <b>in the Temple.</b> In the Temple, this is not prohibited as a preventive measure, lest one come to spread the ointment and thereby perform the prohibited labor of smoothing. <b>However,</b> one may <b>not</b> return a bandage to its place <b>in</b> the rest of <b>the country. If</b> one sought to apply the bandage <b>for the first time</b> to an untreated wound on Shabbat, <b>it is prohibited in both</b> places.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a <b>bandage that became detached from a wound, one</b> may <b>return</b> it to its place <b>on Shabbat</b> in all cases. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If <b>it slipped downward, one</b> may <b>push it upward;</b> if it slipped <b>upward, one</b> may <b>push it</b> downward. <b>One</b> may also <b>uncover part of the bandage and clean the opening of the wound</b> on one side, <b>and then uncover another part of the bandage</b> on the other side <b>and clean the opening of the wound</b> on that side.

### Part 10
However, <b>one</b> may <b>not clean the bandage itself, because</b> that would involve <b>spreading</b> the ointment, which is a subcategory of the prohibited labor of smoothing, <b>and if one spread</b> the ointment <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> Actually restoring a bandage that was completely detached from the wound is prohibited in all cases.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that it is permitted to restore the bandage to the wound <b>only where it became detached</b> and fell <b>onto a utensil,</b> in which case one may immediately pick it up and replace it. <b>However,</b> if <b>it became detached</b> and fell <b>onto the ground, everyone agrees it is prohibited,</b> as this is considered as though one were bandaging the wound for the first time.

### Part 12
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said: I was standing before Father,</b> and his bandage <b>fell onto a pillow and he replaced it. I said to him: Doesn’t the Master hold that which Rav Ḥisda said: The dispute</b> is restricted to a case <b>where</b> the bandage <b>became detached</b> and fell <b>onto a utensil, but if it became detached</b> and fell <b>onto the ground,</b> everyone agrees that <b>it is prohibited; and</b> furthermore, <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> that it is prohibited to replace even a bandage that fell onto a utensil?

### Part 13
<b>He said to me: I did not hear this</b> teaching; <b>that is to say, I do not agree</b> with Rav Ḥisda’s interpretation that the dispute is only in a case where the bandage fell onto a utensil. Rather, they disagree even if it fell onto the ground, and the <i>halakha</i> is that the bandage may be restored to the wound.

### Part 14
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One</b> may <b>tie up</b> on Shabbat <b>a string [<i>nima</i>]</b> that came loose from a harp used <b>in the Temple, but not in</b> the rest of <b>the country. And</b> tying the string to the harp for <b>the first time is prohibited</b> both <b>here and there.</b>

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a harp string broke, one would not tie it up</b> with a knot, <b>but fashion a bow.</b> This teaching indicates that tying up a harp string is prohibited even in the Temple. The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult; this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which prohibits tying, was taught <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis; and that</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara clarifies this answer: <b>According to Rabbi Eliezer, who said</b> that <b>the preparations</b> that enable the performance <b>of a mitzva override</b> the prohibitions of <b>Shabbat,</b> one may <b>tie</b> even the broken harp string, as this is for the purpose of the mitzva of accompanying the Temple service with music. However, <b>according to the Rabbis, who say</b> that preparations for a mitzva <b>do not override</b> Shabbat prohibitions, <b>one</b> may only <b>fashion a bow.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If</b> in fact the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who permits facilitating performance of a mitzva even when it involves desecration of Shabbat, <b>even</b> in a case where the string did not break and one is tying it <b>for the first time,</b> this <b>too</b> should be permitted, as he is acting for the purpose of a mitzva.

### Part 18
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara provides a different resolution of the contradiction: It is <b>not difficult. This,</b> the mishna that permits tying the broken string, was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that making a bow is considered tying, and there is no difference between the two actions; <b>and that,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that prohibits it, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who rule that fashioning a bow is not prohibited by Torah law, and therefore it is permitted to fashion a bow.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda, in accordance with whose</b> opinion did he express his view?
