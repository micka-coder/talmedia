### Part 1
<b>I can</b> make an argument that <b>exempts the entire world from judgment, from the day that the Temple was destroyed until now. As it is stated: “Therefore, hear now this, you afflicted and drunken, but not from wine”</b> (Isaiah 51:21), which teaches that in the wake of the destruction of the Temple, all Jews are considered intoxicated and are not responsible for any sins they commit.

### Part 2
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this argument from the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who is <b>intoxicated, his acquisition is a</b> binding <b>acquisition;</b> that is, he cannot retract the transaction when he is sober, <b>and</b> similarly, <b>his sale is a</b> binding <b>sale.</b> Moreover, <b>if he committed a transgression for which</b> he is liable to receive the <b>death</b> penalty, <b>he is executed;</b> and if the offense is punishable by <b>lashes, he is flogged. The principle is</b> that <b>he is like a sober person in all matters, except that he is exempt from prayer.</b> Therefore, even if the people of Israel are considered drunk, they are nonetheless responsible for their actions.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers that even Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya did not mean that they should be exempt from liability for all their sins. Rather, <b>what is</b> the meaning of <b>his statement: I can exempt?</b> He, <b>too,</b> meant that he could exempt them <b>from the judgment of prayer,</b> i.e., Jews cannot be held liable for praying without the proper intentions.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: They taught</b> that an intoxicated person is responsible for all his actions <b>only</b> in a case where <b>he did not reach the</b> state of <b>intoxication of Lot; however, if he reached the</b> state of <b>intoxication of Lot,</b> so that he is altogether unaware of his actions, <b>he is exempt from all</b> liability.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Whoever passes a shield</b> over himself <b>at a time of arrogance,</b> i.e., whoever suppresses his evil inclination as though it were covered with a shield when he is arrogant, e.g., when he is intoxicated or the like (Rabbeinu Ḥananel), <b>troubles will be closed and sealed from him, as it is stated: “The channels of [<i>afikei</i>] his scales are his pride, closed together as with a tight [<i>tzar</i>] seal”</b> (Job 41:7). The verse is interpreted homiletically: When at a time of arrogance a person passes a shield [<i>mapik</i>] over his evil inclination, his troubles [<i>tzarot</i>] will be closed and sealed before him.

### Part 6
The Gemara poses a question: <b>From where may it be inferred that</b> the meaning of <b>this</b> word <b><i>afik</i> is a formulation</b> denoting <b>passing [<i>aborei</i>]?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “My brothers have dealt deceitfully like a wadi, like the channel [<i>afik</i>] of brooks that pass by [<i>ya’avoru</i>]”</b> (Job 6:15). This implies that the term <i>afik</i> is synonymous with the verb <i>ya’avoru</i>, which refers to something that travels and passes by.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is not the correct interpretation; rather, <b>it was stated</b> that <b>whoever does not</b> cover, but <b>draws out [<i>mapik</i>]</b> a shield at a time of arrogance, troubles will be closed and sealed from him. In other words, a person must draw his weapons and shield in order to fight his evil inclination when it tries to overpower him (Rabbeinu Ḥananel).

### Part 8
The Gemara poses a question: <b>From where may it be inferred that this</b> word <b><i>mapik</i> is a formulation</b> denoting <b>revealing?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “The channels of [<i>afikei</i>] waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare”</b> (Psalms 18:16).

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>Now, since the verses may be interpreted both in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of</b> this <b>Master and in accordance with</b> the opinion of the other <b>Master, what is</b> the practical difference <b>between them?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> practical difference <b>between them is</b> with regard to the following practice of <b>Rav Sheshet, as Rav Sheshet gave</b> the responsibility for monitoring <b>his sleep to his attendant,</b> instructing the attendant to wake him when the time for prayer arrived. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the practice of <b>Rav Sheshet</b> is correct, as Rabbi Ḥanina maintains that if one is in great need of sleep, it is better to nap for a while and then wake up with renewed vigor. <b>And one Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>is not of</b> the opinion that the practice of <b>Rav Sheshet</b> is correct. He holds that a person must marshal his strength and pray, rather than succumb to the need for sleep.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said: Anyone whose mind is unsettled should not pray, as it is stated: When distressed, one should not issue decisions.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, on a day that he was angry,</b> would <b>not pray,</b> as <b>he said that it is written: When distressed, one should not issue decisions.</b> The Gemara similarly relates that <b>Mar Ukva, on a day of a south wind, would not venture out to the court,</b> for this hot and harsh wind would disturb his usual clarity of mind.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The study of <b><i>halakha</i> requires clarity, as</b> on <b>a day</b> when <b>a north wind</b> blows and clears the skies. <b>Abaye said</b> similarly that <b>if my stepmother says to me: Bring</b> me a dish of <b><i>kutaḥ</i>, I can no</b> longer <b>study</b> Torah in my usual fashion, as even a simple task such as this troubles me and distracts me from my Torah study.

### Part 12
Similarly, <b>Rava said: If I am bitten by a louse, I can no</b> longer <b>learn</b> in my usual manner. The Gemara relates that <b>the mother of Mar, son of Ravina, would prepare seven garments for him for the seven days</b> of the week, so that he would not be bitten by the lice found in old clothes (Rabbeinu Ḥananel).

### Part 13
<b>Rav Yehuda said: Night was created only for sleep. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: The moon was created only for</b> Torah <b>study</b> by its light. When people <b>said to Rabbi Zeira: Your teachings are</b> exceedingly <b>sharp, he said to them: They were</b> formulated <b>during the daytime</b> hours. This teaches that Torah study during the day is most beneficial to clarity of the mind.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Ḥisda’s daughter said to</b> her father, <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who would spend his nights in study: <b>Doesn’t the Master wish to sleep a little?</b> He <b>said to her: Days that are long</b> in quantity <b>but short</b> in the opportunity to study Torah and perform mitzvot <b>will soon arrive, and we will sleep a lot.</b> After I die, there will be more than enough time for sleep.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: We,</b> Torah scholars, <b>are day workers,</b> as our study is performed primarily during the day. The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov</b> would <b>borrow and repay,</b> i.e., if for some reason he neglected to study during the day, he would use the night hours to compensate for the missed time.

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: One who returns</b> home <b>from a journey should not pray for three days</b> while recovering from the hardship of being on the road, <b>as it is stated: “And I gathered them together at the river that runs to Aḥava, and we encamped there for three days, and I inspected the people”</b> (Ezra 8:15), after which it is stated: “Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Aḥava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of Him a safe journey for us” (Ezra 8:21), which teaches that they rested three days before praying.

### Part 17
The Gemara relates that <b>Shmuel’s father, when he would return</b> home <b>from his journey, would not pray</b> for <b>three days,</b> as he would have to rest from his journey. <b>Shmuel</b> himself <b>would not pray in a house that contained an alcoholic beverage,</b> as the scent of the alcohol would disturb his concentration during prayer. Similarly, <b>Rav Pappa would not pray in a house that contained small</b> fried <b>fish,</b> due to their smell.

### Part 18
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Whoever is appeased by his wine,</b> i.e., whoever becomes more relaxed after drinking, <b>has in him</b> an element of <b>the mind-set of his Creator,</b> who acted in a similar fashion, <b>as it is stated: “And the Lord smelled the sweet savor,</b> and the Lord said in His heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake” (Genesis 8:21). As it were, God acted more favorably toward His creatures after He was appeased with the smell of the burnt offerings. Smell can be as potent as drinking or eating itself.

### Part 19
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said: Anyone who remains settled</b> of mind <b>after</b> drinking <b>wine,</b> and does not become intoxicated, <b>has</b> an element of <b>the mind-set of seventy Elders.</b> The allusion is: <b>Wine [<i>yayin</i></b> spelled <i>yod</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>nun</i>] <b>was given in seventy letters,</b> as the numerological value of the letters comprising the word is seventy, as <i>yod</i> equals ten and <i>nun</i> equals fifty. Similarly, the word <b>secret [<i>sod</i></b> spelled <i>samekh</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>dalet</i>] <b>was given in seventy letters,</b> as <i>samekh</i> equals sixty, <i>vav</i> equals six, and <i>dalet</i> equals four. Typically, when <b>wine entered</b> the body, <b>a secret emerged.</b> Whoever does not reveal secrets when he drinks is clearly blessed with a firm mind, like that of seventy Elders.

### Part 20
<b>Rabbi Ḥanin said: Wine was created only in order to comfort mourners</b> in their distress, <b>and to reward the wicked</b> in this world so they will have no reward left in the World-to-Come, <b>as it is stated: “Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish,</b> and wine to the bitter of soul. Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more” (Proverbs 31:6). “Him that is ready to perish” refers to the wicked, who will perish from the world, while “the bitter of soul” denotes mourners.

### Part 21
<b>Rabbi Ḥanin bar Pappa said: Anyone in whose house wine does not flow like water is not</b> yet <b>included</b> in the Torah’s <b>blessing, as it is stated: “And He shall bless your bread and your water”</b> (Exodus 23:25). The water mentioned in this verse actually refers to wine, as learned in the following manner: <b>Just as bread</b> is something <b>that may be purchased with</b> second-<b>tithe money,</b> i.e., one is permitted to buy bread with money used to redeem second-tithe, <b>so</b> too the word <b>water</b> in the verse is referring to a liquid <b>that may be purchased with</b> second-<b>tithe money. And what is that?</b> It is <b>wine,</b> as one may buy wine with second-tithe money, but one may not buy water; <b>and</b> nevertheless, the verse <b>calls it “water.”</b>
