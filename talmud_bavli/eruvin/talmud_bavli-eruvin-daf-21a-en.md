<b>must climb up</b> and <b>climb down</b> into the well, and drink there.

### Part 2
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Is that so?</b> Is the allowance of upright boards for animals alone? <b>Didn’t Rav Yitzḥak say</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> Upright <b>boards surrounding wells were permitted only</b> where the <b>wells</b> contain potable, running <b>spring water? If</b> the allowance is only <b>for animals, what is</b> the difference <b>to me</b> if it is <b>spring</b> water <b>and what is</b> the difference <b>to me</b> if it is <b>collected</b> water? Granted, collected water is inferior to spring water, but it is still suitable for animals to drink. The Gemara answers: <b>We require something that is fit for humans.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara examines the <i>baraita</i> cited in the course of the previous discussion. Returning to <b>the matter itself,</b> the statement quoted above: Upright <b>boards surrounding wells were permitted only for cattle, but a person must climb up</b> and <b>climb down</b> into the well and drink there. <b>But if</b> the wells <b>were</b> too <b>wide</b> for him to climb, <b>they are</b> permitted <b>for a person as well. A person may not fill</b> a bucket with <b>water and hold</b> it <b>before his animal on Shabbat, but he may fill</b> it <b>and pour</b> it <b>out</b> into a trough, <b>and</b> the animal <b>drinks of its own accord.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Anan strongly objects to this</b> explanation: <b>If so, what purpose do the boards surrounding a well serve?</b> The Gemara immediately expresses its surprise: How can he ask <b>what purpose do they serve?</b> They allow people <b>to draw</b> water <b>from</b> the wells, which would otherwise be prohibited.

### Part 5
<b>Rather,</b> Rav Anan’s question should be understood as follows: <b>What purpose is served</b> in requiring that the enclosed area be large enough for <b>the cow’s head and most of its</b> body, if in any case the cow may not be given to drink straight from the bucket?

### Part 6
<b>Abaye said:</b> In fact, it is permitted to give the animal to drink in any manner in the area enclosed by the boards surrounding the well. <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a special case, <b>with a manger</b> or trough <b>that stands in the public domain,</b> and is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide,</b> i.e., it constitutes a private domain, <b>and</b> one <b>end of it interposes into</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards</b> surrounding a well. In such a case, the Sages prohibited one to fill a bucket with water in the area enclosed by the upright boards and hold it before his animal; they were concerned that the manger might become damaged, and one might come to carry the bucket from the private domain into the public domain or vice versa while fixing the damaged manger.

### Part 7
It is prohibited to walk more than two thousand cubits from a city on Shabbat. However, if there are small watchmen’s huts [<i>burganin</i>] outside the city that are relatively close together, they are considered part of the city, and consequently the two thousand cubit limit is measured from the last such hut. <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The law with regard to these <b>huts [<i>burganin</i>] does not apply in Babylonia, nor does</b> the allowance with regard to upright <b>boards surrounding a well apply outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.

### Part 8
The Gemara explains: The law with regard to <b>huts does not</b> apply <b>in Babylonia because floods are common</b> there; and since the huts are liable to be swept away by the floodwaters, they are not regarded as dwellings. The allowance with regard to upright <b>boards surrounding a well does not</b> apply <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>because <i>yeshivot</i> are not common</b> there, and the allowance was only granted to those traveling for the sake of a mitzva such as Torah study. <b>But we do</b> say <b>the opposite,</b> i.e., we apply the law of huts outside of Eretz Yisrael and we apply the allowance of upright boards surrounding a well in Babylonia.

### Part 9
The Gemara cites an alternative version of the previous discussion. <b>Some say</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The laws with regard to <b>huts and</b> upright <b>boards surrounding a well</b> apply <b>neither in Babylonia</b> specifically, <b>nor outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael generally. The Gemara explains: The law with regard to <b>huts does not apply in Babylonia, because floods are common</b> there. It <b>also does not</b> apply <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>because thieves</b> who steal from such huts <b>are common</b> there; therefore, people do not regard the huts as dwellings.

### Part 10
The allowance with regard to upright <b>boards surrounding a well</b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>in Babylonia, because water is common</b> there. Babylonia has many rivers and canals, and therefore wells are not essential there. <b>Outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael in general it <b>also does not</b> apply, <b>because <i>yeshivot</i> are not common</b> there.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to Marei, son of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yirmeya bar Abba:</b> People <b>say</b> that <b>you walk from</b> the city of <b>Barnish to Daniel’s synagogue, which is</b> a distance of <b>three parasangs [<i>parsei</i>], on Shabbat. Upon what do you rely?</b> Do you rely <b>on the huts</b> located at the city’s outskirts that extend the Shabbat boundary toward the synagogue? <b>Didn’t your father’s father say in the name of Rav:</b> The law of <b>huts does not</b> apply <b>in Babylonia?</b>

### Part 12
Marei then <b>went out and showed</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>certain</b> ruins of <b>towns that were subsumed within</b> a distance of <b>seventy cubits and a remainder,</b> two-thirds of a cubit, of each other. He relied upon the ruins, rather than upon the huts, to be permitted to walk the entire distance from Barnish to Daniel’s synagogue.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: Mari bar Mar interpreted homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I have seen a limit to every purpose; but Your commandment is exceedingly broad”</b> (Psalms 119:96)? <b>This</b> idea with regard to the breadth of the Torah <b>was stated by David, but he did not explain it;</b> it was <b>stated by Job, but he</b> too <b>did not explain it;</b> it was <b>stated by Ezekiel, but he</b> also <b>did not explain it, until Zechariah,</b> son of Berechiah, <b>son of Iddo, came and explained it.</b>

### Part 14
Rav Ḥisda explains: This idea was <b>stated by David, but he did not explain it, as it is written: “I have seen a limit to every purpose; but Your commandment is exceedingly broad,”</b> i.e., he stated that the Torah is exceedingly broad, but he did not explain how broad. And likewise this idea was <b>stated by Job, but he</b> too <b>did not explain it, as it is written: “Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea”</b> (Job 11:9).

### Part 15
And similarly, it was <b>stated by Ezekiel, but he</b> also <b>did not explain it, as it is written: “And He spread it,”</b> the scroll, <b>“before me, and it was written inside and outside; and in it was written lamentations, and melody [<i>hegeh</i>], and woe [<i>vahi</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 2:10).

### Part 16
The Gemara explains: <b>“Lamentations,” this</b> refers to <b>the punishment of the righteous in this world, and so it is stated: “It is a lamentation and they shall make lament with it”</b> (Ezekiel 32:16). <b>“And melody [<i>hegeh</i>],” this</b> refers to <b>the reward of the righteous in the World-to-Come, and</b> the proof that this word is an expression of joy is the verse that <b>states:</b> “Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the harp, <b>to the melody [<i>higayon</i>] of a lyre”</b> (Psalms 92:4). <b>And “woe [<i>vahi</i>],” this is the punishment of the wicked in the World-to-Come, and so it states: “Calamity [<i>hova</i>] shall follow upon calamity”</b> (Ezekiel 7:26).

### Part 17
But nonetheless, Ezekiel did not explain the extent of the Torah, <b>until Zechariah,</b> son of Berechiah, <b>son of Iddo, came and explained it, as it is written: “And he said to me: What do you see? And I said: I see a flying [<i>afa</i>] scroll; the length of it is twenty cubits, and the breadth of it is ten cubits”</b> (Zechariah 5:2). Since the scroll was flying, the implication is that it had two equal sides, <b>so that when you open it, it is twenty by twenty</b> cubits. <b>And it is written: “And it was written inside and outside,”</b> i.e., on both sides. <b>And when you peel them apart</b> and separate the two sides, <b>how much is it?</b> Its entire area <b>amounts to forty by twenty</b> cubits, or eight hundred of God’s cubits.

### Part 18
In order to determine the measure of God’s cubit, the Gemara cites a verse that describes the size of the span between God’s thumb and little finger, in a manner of speaking. <b>And it is written: “Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out heaven with the span,</b> and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure” (Isaiah 40:12). If the entire world measures one square span, which is a quarter of one square cubit, <b>we find</b> according to this calculation that <b>the entire world is one</b> part <b>in three thousand and two hundred of the Torah.</b>

### Part 19
<b>And Rav Ḥisda</b> further <b>said: Mari bar Mar interpreted homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “The Lord showed me, <b>and behold two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the Lord,</b> after Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah, son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and the princes of Judah with the craftsmen and the smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. <b>One basket [<i>dud</i>] had very good figs, like the figs</b>
