### Part 1
as that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna, with regard to the unfitness of a <i>sukka</i> higher than twenty cubits, is referring to the interior <b>space of the <i>sukka</i>;</b> and that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna, that a cross beam spanning an alleyway that is more than twenty cubits must be lowered, is referring to the <b>space</b> at the entrance <b>of the alleyway</b> beneath the cross beam.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Pappa said to Rava:</b> A <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught that supports your</b> opinion: If the cross beam spanning the entrance of <b>an alleyway is higher than twenty cubits</b> off the ground, <b>greater than the entrance of the Sanctuary, one must diminish its</b> height. <b>And the space of the</b> entrance of the <b>Sanctuary itself was twenty</b> cubits high, and its roof was higher than twenty cubits. Apparently, the twenty cubits mentioned with regard to a <i>sukka</i> and an alleyway refers to the space beneath the roofing and the cross beam.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Shimi bar Rav Ashi raised an objection to Rav Pappa</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>How</b> precisely <b>would he do it? He places the</b> cross <b>beam from the edge of twenty</b> cubits <b>and below.</b> Apparently, the entire cross beam must be within twenty cubits of the ground, and if any part of it rises above twenty it is unfit.

### Part 4
Rav Pappa replied: Emend the <i>Tosefta</i> and <b>say:</b> From the edge of twenty cubits <b>and above.</b> Rav Shimi retorted: <b>But isn’t it taught:</b> And <b>below?</b> What justification is there to completely reverse the meaning of the <i>Tosefta</i>?

### Part 5
Rava explained that there is no need to emend the language of the <i>baraita</i>, but merely to reinterpret it. The <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching us the following:</b> The <i>halakha</i> <b>below is like</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>above. Just as above,</b> with regard to the maximum height of the cross beam, it is the <b>space</b> beneath the cross beam that may not be more than <b>twenty</b> cubits, <b>so</b> too <b>below,</b> with regard to the minimum height of the cross beam, it is the <b>space</b> beneath the cross beam that may not be less than <b>ten</b> handbreadths. However, a cross beam placed within ten handbreadths of the ground is unfit and does not render it permitted to carry within the alleyway.

### Part 6
The Gemara considers the measure of the cubit mentioned in the mishna and elsewhere. <b>Abaye said in the name of Rav Naḥman: The cubit</b> mentioned with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of <i>sukka</i> and the cubit</b> mentioned in connection with the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of an alleyway</b> is <b>a</b> small <b>cubit</b> consisting <b>of five</b> handbreadths. In contrast, <b>the cubit of</b> a forbidden mixture of <b>diverse kinds</b> of seeds is <b>a</b> large <b>cubit</b> consisting <b>of six</b> handbreadths. Apparently, Rav Naḥman rules stringently in all cases.

### Part 7
The Gemara elaborates: <b>The cubit of an alleyway is a cubit</b> consisting <b>of five</b> handbreadths. <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> does this ruling apply? It applies <b>to</b> the issue of the height of the cross beam spanning an alleyway that may not be more than twenty cubits high, <b>and to the breach of an alleyway</b> that may not be more than ten cubits wide.

### Part 8
The Gemara poses a question: <b>But isn’t there</b> also the issue of <b>the</b> minimal <b>length of an alleyway?</b> For carrying in an alleyway to be rendered permissible by means of a side post or a cross beam, it must be at least <b>four cubits</b> long. In that case, measuring the alleyway with small cubits will lead <b>to a leniency.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara resolves this difficulty: Rav Naḥman holds <b>in accordance with the one who said</b> that the length of an alleyway need only be <b>four handbreadths.</b> However, a cubit mentioned in the context of an alleyway is always a small cubit, which is a stringency.

### Part 10
The Gemara proposes an alternative solution: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that actually Rav Naḥman holds in accordance with the opinion that the length of an alleyway must be <b>four cubits,</b> and in that case, the alleyway is measured with large cubits of six handbreadths as a stringency. When he is saying that the cubit of an alleyway is a cubit of five handbreadths, <b>he is speaking of most,</b> but not all, <b>cubits</b> mentioned in the context of an alleyway.

### Part 11
Rav Naḥman said that <b>the cubit of a <i>sukka</i></b> is <b>a</b> small <b>cubit</b> consisting <b>of five</b> handbreadths. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> does this ruling apply? It applies <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>its height,</b> i.e., that a <i>sukka</i> may not be more than twenty cubits high, <b>and to the</b> <i>halakha</i> of <b>a curved wall.</b> A <i>sukka</i> is considered valid if there are up to four cubits of invalid roofing, provided that this roofing is adjacent to one of the walls of the <i>sukka</i>. In that case, the invalid roofing is considered an extension of the wall, i.e., the wall is considered to be curved, and consequently, the entire <i>sukka</i> is valid. With regard to both <i>halakhot</i>, the ruling is stringent and distance is measured with small cubits.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> also the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the</b> minimal <b>length of a <i>sukka</i>,</b> which must be at least <b>four cubits</b> long? If it is measured with small cubits, <b>that</b> will lead <b>to a leniency. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say, any <i>sukka</i> that does not</b> have <b>in it</b> an area of at least <b>four cubits by four cubits is invalid.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara resolves this difficulty: Rav Naḥman holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say:</b> A <i>sukka</i> is valid <b>even if it holds only one’s head, most of his</b> body, <b>and his table.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara suggests another solution: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> Rav Naḥman’s statement holds true even if <b>it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi that a <i>sukka</i> must be at least four cubits long. Indeed, the <i>sukka</i> is measured with large cubits consisting of six handbreadths, which is a stringency. <b>And</b> when he says that the cubit of a <i>sukka</i> is a cubit of five handbreadths, <b>he is speaking of most,</b> but not all, <b>cubits</b> mentioned with regard to <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 15
The Gemara continues: As stated above, Rav Naḥman said that <b>the cubit of a</b> forbidden mixture of <b>diverse kinds</b> of seeds <b>is a cubit</b> consisting <b>of six handbreadths.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> does this ruling apply? It applies <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a clearing in a vineyard and to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the perimeter of a vineyard.</b>

### Part 16
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna in tractate <i>Kilayim</i>: With regard to <b>a clearing in a vineyard, Beit Shammai say:</b> Its measure is <b>twenty-four cubits, and Beit Hillel say: Sixteen cubits.</b> With regard to <b>the perimeter of a vineyard, Beit Shammai say: Sixteen cubits, and Beit Hillel say: Twelve cubits.</b>

### Part 17
The mishna explains: <b>What is a clearing in a vineyard?</b> It is referring to <b>a vineyard whose middle</b> section <b>was laid bare</b> of vines. If <b>there are not sixteen cubits</b> across in the clearing, <b>one may not bring</b> foreign <b>seeds</b> and sow them <b>there,</b> due to the Torah prohibition against sowing other crops in a vineyard (Deuteronomy 22:9). If <b>there were sixteen cubits</b> across in the clearing, <b>one provides</b> the vineyard with <b>its</b> requisite <b>work area,</b> i.e., four cubits along either side of the vines are left unsown to facilitate cultivation of the vines, <b>and he sows the rest</b> of the cleared area with foreign crops.

### Part 18
The mishna continues: <b>What is the perimeter of a vineyard?</b> It is the vacant area <b>between the vineyard and the fence</b> surrounding it. If <b>there are not twelve cubits</b> in that area, <b>one may not bring</b> foreign <b>seeds</b> and sow them <b>there.</b> If <b>there were twelve cubits</b> in that area, <b>he provides</b> the vineyard, with <b>its</b> requisite <b>work area,</b> four cubits, <b>and he sows the rest.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t there</b> also the <i>halakha</i> of vines that planted <b>consecutively, within four cubits</b> of each other, with regard to <b>which</b> measuring the distance with large cubits would lead <b>to a leniency? As we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>a vineyard that was planted</b> in consecutive rows <b>with less than four cubits</b> between them, <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Since the rows are planted so closely together, <b>it is not</b> considered <b>a vineyard,</b> and if one plants other crops there he is not liable. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> It is <b>a vineyard, and one regards the middle</b> vines, those planted between two appropriately spaced rows, <b>as if they are not</b> there. One who plants other crops there is indeed liable. According to Rabbi Shimon’s opinion, measuring the distance between the rows with large cubits leads to leniency.

### Part 20
The Gemara resolves the difficulty: Rav Naḥman made his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that a densely planted vineyard <b>is a vineyard. And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> Rav Naḥman’s statement holds true even if <b>it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> that a densely planted vineyard is not a vineyard, and the distance between the rows is measured with small cubits consisting of five handbreadths as a stringency. When he says that the cubit of diverse kinds of seeds is a cubit consisting of six handbreadths, <b>he is speaking of most,</b> but not all, <b>cubits</b> mentioned with regard to a forbidden mixture of diverse kinds of seeds.

### Part 21
The above was based on the ruling of Rav Naḥman according to Abaye. <b>But Rava said in the name of Rav Naḥman: All cubits</b> mentioned in measurements by the Sages consisted of a large <b>cubit of six</b> handbreadths. <b>However, these,</b> the cubits mentioned with regard to diverse kinds of seeds, <b>are</b> measured with <b>expansive</b> handbreadths, with the fingers spread apart, <b>whereas those,</b> the cubits mentioned with regard to an alleyway and a <i>sukka</i>, <b>are</b> measured with <b>compressed</b> handbreadths, with the fingers held together.

### Part 22
<b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All cubits that were mentioned by the Sages are cubits of six</b> handbreadths, <b>provided</b>
