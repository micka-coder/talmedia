### Part 1
<b>This</b> measurement <b>applies</b> only <b>to a circle</b> and the ratio between its circumference and diameter, <b>but with regard to a square</b> that must fit entirely within that circle, <b>we require</b> a circle with a <b>larger</b> circumference. In order for a square of four by four handbreadths to be entirely contained within a circle, the circumference of the circle must measure more than twelve handbreadths

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Now, how much larger is a square than a circle?</b> It is larger by <b>one quarter.</b> If so, a circle <b>with</b> a circumference of <b>sixteen</b> handbreadths at most should <b>suffice.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> statement that a square is larger than a circle by a quarter <b>applies</b> only <b>to a circle circumscribed by a square, but</b> with regard to <b>a square circumscribed by a circle, we require more,</b> and the difference between the square and the circle is greater. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>due to the projection of the corners</b> of the square, as the distance from the center of the square to its corners is greater than the distance from the center to its sides.

### Part 4
The Gemara further objects: <b>Since every cubit in</b> the side of <b>a square</b> is <b>a cubit and two-fifths in the diagonal,</b> a square of four by four handbreadths has a diagonal of five and three-fifths handbreadths. And since the diameter of a circle equals the diagonal of the square that it encompasses, the circle circumscribing a square of four by four handbreadths has a diameter of five and three-fifths handbreadths. If that measure is multiplied by three to arrive at the circumference of that circle, the result is that a circle with a circumference of <b>seventeen handbreadths minus a fifth is sufficient</b> to circumscribe a square of four by four handbreadths. Why, then, does Rabbi Yoḥanan say that a circular window must have a circumference of twenty-four handbreadths?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan spoke in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the judges of Caesarea, and some say in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Sages of Caesarea, who say: A circle</b> that is circumscribed <b>within a square</b> is smaller than it by <b>one quarter;</b> with regard to <b>a square</b> that is circumscribed <b>within a circle,</b> the difference between them is equal to <b>half</b> the square. According to this explanation, Rabbi Yoḥanan calculated as follows: Since a square of four by four handbreadths has a perimeter of sixteen handbreadths, the circumference of the circle that encompasses it must be fifty percent larger, or twenty-four handbreadths.

### Part 6
It was taught in the mishna: If a window is <b>less than four by four</b> handbreadths, or if it is above ten handbreadths from the ground, the residents of the two courtyards may not establish one joint <i>eiruv</i> but must instead establish two independent ones. <b>Rav Naḥman said: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> of a window within ten handbreadths of the ground <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a window between two courtyards. But</b> with regard to <b>a window between two houses, even</b> if it is <b>above ten</b> handbreadths <b>as well, if they wish to establish an <i>eiruv</i>, they establish one <i>eiruv</i>. What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? It is that <b>a house is considered as though it</b> were <b>filled,</b> and therefore there is no difference between below and above ten handbreadths with regard to a window in a house.

### Part 7
<b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> from that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A window between two courtyards, and a window between two houses, and a window between two attics, and a window between two roofs, and a window between two rooms are all one and the same to me; they all</b> must be <b>four by four</b> handbreadths and <b>within ten</b> handbreadths from the ground. This directly contradicts Rav Naḥman’s opinion.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>Explain</b> that this <i>halakha</i> of ten handbreadths mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> is referring only to <b>courtyards.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>Doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach: Are all one and the same to me,</b> indicating that they are all equal in this regard? Rather, <b>explain</b> that they are all equal in that the window must be the size of <b>four by four</b> handbreadths, but not that all must be within ten handbreadths of the ground.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Abba raised a dilemma before Rav Naḥman:</b> With regard to <b>an aperture that opens from</b> the ceiling of <b>a house</b> occupied by one person <b>to an attic</b> occupied by another, <b>must a permanent ladder</b> be positioned in the opening <b>to render</b> carrying from one level to the other <b>permitted</b> by turning the two into a single residence? <b>Or, is a permanent ladder not necessary to render it permitted?</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara clarifies the two sides of the question: <b>When we say</b> that <b>a house is considered as though it</b> were <b>filled,</b> does <b>this apply</b> only to a window positioned <b>on the side, but not</b> to a window <b>in the middle?</b> In that case, the opening would not be viewed as near the full part of the house, and a permanent ladder would be required. <b>Or perhaps there is no difference,</b> and since the house is considered filled, no ladder is necessary.

### Part 11
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: It is not necessary.</b> The Sages <b>understood from</b> this response that he meant that <b>a permanent ladder is not required, but a temporary ladder is required.</b> However, <b>it is stated</b> in this regard: <b>Rav Yosef bar Manyumi said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said: Neither a permanent ladder nor a temporary ladder is required,</b> as the fact that the opening is located within the house is sufficient to render it permitted to carry from the house to the attic.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>a wall between two courtyards is ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide,</b> the residents of the courtyard <b>establish two <i>eiruvin</i>,</b> a separate one for each courtyard, <b>but they</b> may <b>not establish one <i>eiruv</i>.</b>

### Part 13
<b>If there was produce on top</b> of the wall, <b>these</b> residents of one courtyard <b>may ascend from this side and eat</b> from it, <b>and those</b> residents of the other courtyard <b>may ascend from that side and eat</b> from it, <b>provided that they do not lower</b> the produce <b>down</b> from on top of the wall to one of the courtyards.

### Part 14
<b>If the wall was breached,</b> the following distinction applies: If the breach was <b>up to ten cubits</b> wide, <b>they establish two <i>eiruvin</i>, and if they desire, they</b> may <b>establish one <i>eiruv</i>, as it is similar to an entrance,</b> like any opening less than ten cubits wide. If the breach was <b>more than this, they establish one <i>eiruv</i>, and they</b> may <b>not establish two,</b> as a breach of this size nullifies the partition and joins the two courtyards into a single domain.

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: If this wall <b>is not four</b> handbreadths in width, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav said:</b> In this case, <b>the air of two domains controls it.</b> Since the wall is not broad enough to be regarded a domain of its own, the top of the wall is seen as belonging to both courtyards and is then prohibited to both of them. Accordingly, <b>one may not move</b> anything <b>on</b> top of the wall, <b>even</b> as much as <b>a hair’s breadth.</b>
