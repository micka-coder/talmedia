### Part 1
<b>that</b> instance of the term Temple <b>is</b> not written with regard to the Tabernacle; rather, it is <b>written with regard to the ark</b> and the other sacred objects in the Tabernacle, as the sons of Kehat carried only the sacred vessels and not the Tabernacle itself. <b>Rather,</b> it is derived <b>from here: “And let them make Me a Temple that I may dwell among them”</b> (Exodus 25:8), where the reference is to the Tabernacle.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Both according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, let them derive</b> the maximum width of a doorway <b>from the doorway of the gate of the courtyard</b> of the Tabernacle. <b>As it is written: “The length of the courtyard shall be one hundred cubits and the breadth fifty everywhere, and the height five cubits”</b> (Exodus 27:18). <b>And it is written: “The hangings on one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits;</b> their pillars three and their sockets three” (Exodus 27:14). <b>And it is written: “And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and on that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits;</b> their pillars three and their sockets three” (Exodus 38:15). If the hangings on both sides of the gate covered thirty of the courtyard’s total width of fifty cubits, apparently, the gate of the courtyard was twenty cubits wide and five cubits high. Therefore, <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the Tabernacle, an entrance <b>five</b> cubits high <b>by twenty</b> cubits <b>wide</b> is considered a doorway, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>eiruv</i>, an entrance <b>five</b> cubits high <b>by twenty</b> cubits <b>wide</b> should be considered a doorway.

### Part 3
The Gemara rejects this assertion: There is no proof from there, as that entrance <b>is called the doorway of the gate of the courtyard,</b> but <b>it is not called a doorway, unmodified.</b> Consequently, the dimensions of a doorway mentioned without qualification cannot be derived from that doorway.

### Part 4
The Gemara offers an alternative answer: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>when it is written: “The hangings on one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits,”</b> it is referring <b>to the height</b> of the hangings. The width of the hangings, however, is not specified in the Torah at all, and therefore the width of the doorway of the gate of the courtyard is unknown.

### Part 5
The Gemara raises an objection: Could it be that the <b>height</b> of the hangings was fifteen cubits? <b>Isn’t it written</b> explicitly in the verse: <b>“And the height five cubits”?</b> The Gemara answers: The verse is stating that the height of the hangings was five cubits, measured <b>from the edge of the altar and above.</b> The altar itself was ten cubits high, while the hangings of the courtyard were fifteen cubits high, five cubits higher than the altar.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>Did Rabbi Yehuda</b> actually <b>derive</b> his opinion <b>from the doorway of the Entrance Hall? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that if the entrance to an alleyway is <b>wider than ten cubits, one must diminish</b> its width? <b>And Rabbi Yehuda does not dispute</b> this ruling. Wasn’t the doorway of the Entrance Hall wider than ten cubits?

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said:</b> In fact, Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagrees</b> with the unattributed opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> <b>in a <i>baraita</i>. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the entrance to an alleyway is <b>wider than ten cubits, he must diminish</b> its width; <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> disagrees and <b>says: He need not diminish it.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks further: If so, <b>let him disagree in the mishna.</b> Why is Rabbi Yehuda’s dispute cited only in the <i>baraita</i>, and not in the mishna? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagrees</b> in the mishna <b>with regard to</b> an entrance’s <b>height, but the same applies to its width.</b> His statement: He need not reduce it, is referring both to the entrance’s height and to its width.

### Part 9
The Gemara poses a question: <b>And still,</b> is it possible that <b>Rabbi Yehuda derived</b> his opinion <b>from the doorway of the Entrance Hall? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a cross beam spanning the entrance to <b>an alleyway that is higher than twenty cubits, one must diminish</b> its height; <b>and Rabbi Yehuda deems it fit up to forty and fifty cubits. And</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>, <b>bar Kappara taught</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda: It is fit <b>up to a hundred</b> cubits.

### Part 10
The Gemara clarifies its question: <b>Granted, according to bar Kappara,</b> the phrase: Up to a hundred, can be understood as <b>an exaggeration,</b> not as an exact number. All that Rabbi Yehuda meant to say is that it is permitted to carry in the alleyway even if the cross beam is significantly higher than twenty cubits. <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda</b> in the name of Rav, <b>what exaggeration</b> is there? He certainly meant precisely what he said. <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>forty</b> cubits, <b>Rabbi Yehuda derived</b> it <b>from the doorway of the Entrance Hall. However,</b> with regard to <b>fifty</b> cubits, <b>from where does he derive</b> it? Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda did not derive the dimensions of an entrance from the doorway of the Entrance Hall. He derived them from a different source.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It was <b>this <i>baraita</i></b> that <b>misled Rav</b> and led him to explain that Rabbi Yehuda derived the measurements of an entrance from the doorway of the Entrance Hall. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a cross beam spanning the entrance to <b>an alleyway that is higher than twenty cubits, higher than the doorway of the Sanctuary, one must diminish</b> its height. Rav <b>maintains: From</b> the fact <b>that the Rabbis derived</b> the dimensions of an entrance <b>from the doorway of the Sanctuary, Rabbi Yehuda</b> must have <b>derived</b> those dimensions <b>from the doorway of the Entrance Hall. But that is not so.</b> Rather, <b>Rabbi Yehuda derived</b> the dimensions of an entrance <b>from the entrance of kings,</b> whose regular practice was to erect their entrances exceedingly high and wide.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And,</b> according to <b>the Rabbis, if they derived</b> their opinion <b>from the doorway of the Sanctuary, let them require doors</b> in order to render an alleyway fit for one to carry within it, <b>just as</b> there were doors in <b>the Sanctuary. Why</b> then <b>did we learn</b> in the mishna: With regard to the method of <b>rendering an alleyway fit</b> for carrying within it, <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Both <b>a side post</b> placed adjacent to one of the sides of the alleyway’s entrance <b>and a</b> cross <b>beam</b> over the entrance to the alleyway are required. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> Either <b>a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam</b> is sufficient. However, not even according to the more stringent opinion of Beit Shammai are doors required.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>The Sanctuary doors were made solely for</b> the purpose of <b>privacy,</b> but served no practical function. The doorway of the Sanctuary did not require doors to be considered an entrance. It was a full-fledged entrance even without them.

### Part 14
The Gemara raises another question: <b>But if so,</b> that the Rabbis derive their opinion from the entrance to the Sanctuary, <b>the form of a doorway,</b> i.e., two vertical posts on the two sides, with a horizontal cross beam spanning the space between them, <b>should not be effective</b> if the alleyway is more than ten cubits wide, <b>as the Sanctuary had the form of a doorway, and even so, it was</b> no more than <b>ten cubits wide. Why</b> then <b>did we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>If</b> the entrance <b>has the form of a doorway,</b> then <b>even if it is wider than ten cubits, he need not diminish</b> its width?

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: <b>As that is the reason only according to Rav,</b> who holds that the Rabbis derive their opinion from the doorway of the Sanctuary. <b>Didn’t Rav Yehuda teach</b> this mishna to <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav before Rav,</b> saying that if the entrance had the form of a doorway <b>he need not diminish it, and Rav said to him</b> to <b>teach</b> a different version: <b>He must diminish it.</b> Apparently, according to Rav himself, the form of a doorway does not render it permitted to carry within the alleyway if its entrance is wider than the doorway of the Sanctuary, and therefore the question about the form of a doorway poses no difficulty to his opinion.

### Part 16
The Gemara raises an additional difficulty: <b>However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b>
