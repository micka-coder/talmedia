### Part 1
If one <b>placed roofing on top of a portico that has doorposts,</b> i.e., a portico with two parallel walls that are valid for a <i>sukka</i>, as well as posts in the corners supporting the portico and protruding like doorposts, which are considered as sealing the other two sides of the portico, it is a <b>valid</b> <i>sukka</i>. However, <b>if he evened the doorposts</b> by constructing walls adjacent to the existing walls, obscuring the posts so that they do not protrude, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>invalid.</b> This teaching indicates that the creation of a partition can cause prohibition.

### Part 2
<b>Abaye said to him: In my opinion,</b> with regard to that case of a portico, the <i>sukka</i> is <b>valid.</b> However, even <b>according to your opinion,</b> this <b>is</b> another instance of <b>the removal of partitions.</b> Evening the doorposts does not render the <i>sukka</i> invalid through the establishment of new partitions, but because it negates the original partitions of the <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 3
<b>Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye: And didn’t we find</b> that <b>a partition</b> causes <b>prohibition? But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a house, half of which is roofed and half unroofed,</b> if there are <b>vines here,</b> under the roofed section of the house, <b>it is permitted to sow</b> crops <b>there,</b> in the open section. The reason is that it is as though the edge of the roof descends to the ground and forms a partition between the two sections of the house.

### Part 4
<b>And if he evened its roofing,</b> by extending the roof to cover the entire house, it would be <b>prohibited</b> to sow other crops there. It is evident that the very placement of a partition, in this case a roof, causes prohibition. Abaye <b>said to him: There</b> too <b>it is</b> an instance of <b>the removal of partitions.</b> It is prohibited to sow not due to the added roofing; rather, it is prohibited due to the negation of the imaginary partition.

### Part 5
<b>Rava sent</b> a different proof to <b>Abaye by means of Rav Shemaya bar Ze’eira,</b> with regard to the same issue. <b>And didn’t we find a partition</b> causes <b>prohibition? But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There is</b> an element <b>in the partitions of a vineyard</b> that causes <b>leniency</b> with regard to diverse kinds of seeds <b>and</b> an element that causes <b>stringency. How so?</b> With regard to <b>a vineyard that is planted until the</b> very <b>base of a partition, one sows</b> crops <b>from the base of</b> the other side of <b>the partition onward.</b> This is a leniency, <b>as were there no partition there,</b> he would be required to <b>distance</b> himself <b>four cubits</b> from the last vine <b>and</b> only then <b>sow</b> there. <b>And this is</b> an element in <b>partitions of a vineyard</b> that causes <b>leniency.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And</b> as for an element in partitions that causes <b>stringency, how so?</b> If the vineyard <b>was distanced eleven cubits from a wall, one may not bring</b> the <b>seeds</b> of other crops <b>there,</b> between the vineyard and the wall, and sow that area. This is a stringency, <b>as were there no partition,</b> it would suffice to <b>distance</b> himself <b>four cubits</b> from the last vine, <b>and sow</b> there. <b>This is</b> an element of <b>partitions in a vineyard</b> that causes <b>stringency,</b> a clear situation of a partition that causes prohibition.

### Part 7
Abaye <b>said to him: And according to your reasoning</b> that this presents a difficulty, <b>raise an objection against our</b> opinion <b>from a mishna,</b> rather than a less authoritative <i>baraita</i>, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>a clearing in a vineyard, Beit Shammai say:</b> Its measure is <b>twenty-four cubits, and Beit Hillel say: Sixteen cubits.</b> With regard to <b>the perimeter of a vineyard, Beit Shammai say: Sixteen cubits, and Beit Hillel say: Twelve cubits.</b>

### Part 8
The mishna explains: <b>And what is a clearing in a vineyard?</b> It is referring to <b>a vineyard whose middle</b> section <b>was laid bare</b> of vines. If <b>there are not sixteen cubits</b> across in the clearing, <b>one may not bring</b> foreign <b>seeds</b> and sow them <b>there,</b> due to the Torah prohibition against sowing other crops in a vineyard (Deuteronomy 22:9). If <b>there were sixteen cubits</b> across in the clearing, <b>one provides</b> the vineyard with <b>its</b> requisite <b>work area,</b> i.e., four cubits along either side of the vines are left unsown to facilitate cultivation of the vines, <b>and he sows the rest</b> of the cleared area with foreign crops.

### Part 9
The mishna continues: <b>What is the perimeter of a vineyard?</b> It is the vacant area <b>between the vineyard and the fence</b> surrounding it. If <b>there are not twelve cubits</b> in that area, <b>one may not bring</b> foreign <b>seeds</b> and sow them <b>there.</b> If <b>there are twelve cubits</b> in that area, <b>he provides</b> the vineyard with <b>its</b> requisite <b>work area,</b> four cubits, <b>and he sows the rest.</b> However, were the vineyard not surrounded by a fence, all he would need to do is distance himself four cubits from the last vine. It is clear from this <i>halakha</i> that the partition causes prohibition.

### Part 10
<b>Rather,</b> the objection was not raised from there because <b>there, isn’t this the reason</b> that the partition is not considered to cause prohibition? It is <b>because the entire</b> area of <b>four cubits alongside a vineyard is</b> considered <b>the vineyard’s work area,</b> and is therefore an actual part of it. Likewise, with regard to the four cubits <b>alongside the fence</b> surrounding the vineyard, <b>since they cannot</b> easily <b>be sown</b> due to the wall, <b>he renounces ownership over</b> the area. With regard to the space <b>in between, if it is four</b> cubits, <b>it is</b> deemed <b>significant</b> in its own right, <b>and if not, it is not significant</b> and is nullified relative to the rest, and it is prohibited to sow there. A similar reasoning applies to the <i>baraita</i>. The stringency is not due to the fact that the partition causes prohibition, but because the partition impedes cultivation of the vineyard.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> If there are <b>three enclosures alongside one another, and the two outer</b> ones <b>protrude,</b> i.e., they are wider than the middle one, so that there are partitions on both sides of the breach between them and the middle enclosure, <b>and the middle one does not protrude,</b> and there are no partitions between it and the outer enclosures, as it is totally breached, <b>and there is one</b> person <b>in this</b> one <b>and one</b> person <b>in that</b> one and yet another person in the third enclosure, the people in the enclosures are considered as though they are all living in one large enclosure. Consequently, the legal status of the group <b>becomes like</b> that of <b>a caravan, and one provides them</b> with <b>all</b> the space <b>that they require.</b> In other words, they may use the entire enclosure even if it is very large, just as there are no limits to the size of the enclosed area in which members of a caravan may carry.

### Part 12
However, if the <b>middle</b> enclosure <b>protruded, and the two outer ones did not protrude,</b> i.e., they were narrower than the middle enclosure, so that their entire width was breached into it, <b>and there is one</b> person <b>in this</b> one <b>and one</b> person <b>in that</b> one and yet another in the third, <b>one provides them only</b> an area of <b>six <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of individuals in a field, who may enclose an area of only two <i>beit se’a</i> per person. As the middle enclosure is larger than the two outer ones, it determines their status, in accordance with the principle stated above, not the other way around. Consequently, the person in the middle enclosure is regarded as though he established residence in only one of the outer enclosures, constituting a group of no more than two, which does not have the legal status of a caravan.

### Part 13
Based on these assumptions, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If there is <b>one</b> person <b>in this</b> outer enclosure, <b>and one person in the other</b> outer enclosure, <b>and two</b> people <b>in the middle</b> enclosure, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the ruling that <b>if</b> the pair <b>exit to here,</b> one of the outer enclosures, <b>they are three</b> people in one place, <b>and if they exit to there,</b> the other outer enclosure, <b>they are three</b> people in one place, and three people are considered a caravan and provided with all the space they require, as stated above?

### Part 14
<b>Or perhaps,</b> as <b>one may exit to here and the other may exit to there,</b> in which case there would be no more than two people in each enclosure, they are provided with only two <i>beit se’a</i> per person.

### Part 15
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>one may exit to here and one may exit to there,</b> if there were <b>two</b> people <b>in this</b> outer enclosure, <b>and two</b> people <b>in that</b> outer enclosure, <b>and one</b> person <b>in the middle</b> enclosure, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is the ruling that <b>here, certainly, if he exits to here they are three, and if he exits to there they are</b> likewise <b>three,</b> and consequently they should be provided with all the space they require in any case? <b>Or perhaps,</b> in this case too there is uncertainty, as <b>say</b> that <b>he</b> might <b>exit to here, and say</b> that <b>he</b> might <b>exit to there.</b> As the direction in which he will leave his enclosure is undetermined, they should be provided with only two <i>beit se’a</i> each.

### Part 16
These dilemmas were essentially left unresolved, <b>but</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is</b> that <b>these dilemmas</b> are decided <b>leniently, and</b> they are provided with all the space they require in these cases.
