### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here</b> in this <i>baraita</i>? It is a case <b>where</b> the wall has not been fully breached, but rather <b>remnants of the wall</b> remain on each side (Rabbeinu Ḥananel; Rif).

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> If several courtyards open onto a common alleyway, the residents of the houses in the courtyards are prohibited to carry in the alleyway, unless the alleyway is rendered fit for one to carry within it by placing a side post or a cross beam at its entrance, and by the inhabitants of each courtyard placing food in a common area for the duration of Shabbat, symbolically converting the entire alleyway into a single household. It is prohibited to carry in <b>an alleyway</b> that the residents <b>did not merge.</b> Nevertheless, if the alleyway <b>was rendered fit by</b> means of <b>a side post</b> placed at its entrance, <b>one who throws</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain <b>is liable;</b> the side post functions as a partition, and the alleyway is deemed a full-fledged private domain. If, however, the alleyway <b>was rendered fit by</b> means of a cross <b>beam, one who throws</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain <b>is exempt;</b> the cross beam functions only as a conspicuous marker. It is not considered a partition that renders the alleyway a private domain.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Sheshet strongly objects to this</b> due to the following: <b>The reason</b> that one is exempt in the latter case is due to the fact the residents of the alleyway <b>did not merge.</b> By inference, <b>if they did</b> in fact <b>merge, one would be liable even if</b> the alleyway <b>was rendered fit by</b> way of a cross <b>beam.</b> This, however, is difficult. One can ask: <b>Does this loaf,</b> through which the residents joined together to form a single household, <b>render</b> the alleyway <b>a private domain or a public domain?</b>

### Part 4
<b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Courtyards</b> shared <b>by many and alleyways that are not open</b> on two opposite sides, <b>whether</b> the residents <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> or did not establish an <i>eiruv</i>, one who throws</b> an object <b>into them</b> from the public domain <b>is liable.</b> This seems to contrary to Rav Yehuda’s statement.

### Part 5
<b>Rather, if it was stated, it was stated as follows. Rav Yehuda said:</b> In the case of <b>an alleyway that is not fit for merging,</b> i.e., an alleyway that is open on two opposite sides, if the alleyway <b>was rendered fit</b> for one to carry within it <b>by</b> means of <b>a side post, one who throws</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain <b>is liable.</b> In that case, the side post is considered a third partition, and since the alleyway is closed on three sides it is deemed a private domain. If, however, the alleyway <b>was rendered fit</b> for one to carry within in <b>by</b> means of a cross <b>beam, one who throws</b> an object <b>into it is exempt.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Apparently,</b> Rav Yehuda <b>holds</b> that <b>a side post</b> functions <b>as a partition, whereas a</b> cross <b>beam</b> functions <b>as a conspicuous marker</b> but is not considered a partition. <b>And, so too, Rabba said: A side post</b> functions <b>as a partition, whereas</b> a cross <b>beam</b> functions <b>as a conspicuous marker. But Rava said: Both this,</b> the side post, <b>and that,</b> the cross beam, function <b>as a conspicuous marker.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Abba raised an objection to Rava</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who throws</b> an object from the public domain <b>into an alleyway, if</b> the alleyway <b>has a side post, he is liable; if it does not have a side post he is exempt.</b> This shows that a side post is considered a proper partition.

### Part 8
Rava replied: <b>This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If the alleyway is closed on one side such that <b>it requires only a side post</b> in order to permit carrying within in, <b>one who throws</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain <b>is liable</b> because the alleyway already has three partitions and is therefore a proper private domain according to Torah law. However, if the alleyway requires <b>a side post and something else</b> in order to permit carrying within it, <b>one who throws</b> an object <b>into it</b> from the public domain <b>is exempt</b> because the alleyway has only two partitions and is therefore not considered a private domain.

### Part 9
<b>He raised an</b> additional <b>objection</b> to Rava from the following <i>baraita</i>. <b>Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is as follows with regard to <b>one who has two houses</b> opposite each other <b>on two sides of the public domain,</b> if he chooses, <b>he may</b> create a private domain for himself in the area of the public domain. He may <b>place a</b> ten-handbreadth high <b>side post from here,</b> perpendicular to the public domain. This creates a symbolic wall which, in the <i>halakhot</i> of alleyways, has the legal status of a wall. <b>And,</b> he may place <b>an</b> additional <b>post from here,</b> on the other side, and that has the same legal status as if he closed the public domain on all of its sides. <b>Or,</b> he can implement a different solution appropriate for alleyways by placing <b>a beam</b> extending <b>from here,</b> from one end of one house, to the end of the house opposite it. This creates a symbolic partition across the width of the street. <b>And,</b> he may place <b>a beam</b> extending <b>from here,</b> from the other side of the house. According to Rabbi Yehuda, in that way, one is permitted to <b>carry</b> objects <b>and place</b> them <b>in</b> the area <b>between</b> the symbolic partitions, as he would in a private domain.

### Part 10
The Rabbis <b>said to him: One may not place an <i>eiruv</i> in the public domain in that</b> way. One who seeks to transform a public domain into a private domain must place actual partitions. Apparently, according to Rabbi Yehuda, the side posts function as partitions in the public domain, creating a private domain between the two houses. It follows from this that a side post is in fact deemed a proper partition, contrary to Rava’s statement.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: This is not the reason behind Rabbi Yehuda’s statement. Rather, <b>there Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>by Torah law two partitions</b> suffice to constitute a private domain, and he requires side posts only as a conspicuous marker. Therefore, Rava’s position cannot be disproved from this source either.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said:</b> Unlike other alleyways, carrying within <b>an alleyway whose length is equal to its width is not permitted by</b> means of <b>a side post of minimal</b> width. Like a courtyard, carrying within it is permitted only by means of an upright board four handbreadths wide. <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said in the name of Rav:</b> Carrying within <b>an alleyway whose length is equal to its width is not permitted by</b> a cross <b>beam</b> with the width <b>of a handbreadth.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: How precise are the traditions of the Elders.</b> He explains: <b>Since the length</b> of the alleyway <b>is equal to its width, it is</b> regarded like <b>a courtyard, and</b> carrying within <b>a courtyard is not permitted by</b> means of <b>a side post or</b> a cross <b>beam, but</b> only <b>by</b> means of <b>an</b> upright <b>board of four</b> handbreadths.

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Nonetheless, <b>if</b> this issue <b>is difficult for me</b> to understand, <b>this is my difficulty: Let this side post be</b> considered <b>like</b> an upright <b>board of minimal</b> width <b>and permit</b> carrying within the alleyway, just as an upright board permits carrying in a breached courtyard.

### Part 15
The Gemara explains that this is incorrect, as <b>that which Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said escaped</b> Rabbi Zeira’s <b>attention: The</b> upright <b>boards of a courtyard must be four</b> handbreadths wide, whereas a side post may be of minimal size.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Naḥman said: We have a tradition</b> that states: <b>What is the</b> type of <b>alleyway</b> in <b>which</b> carrying <b>is permitted by</b> means of <b>a side post or</b> a cross <b>beam? Any</b> alleyway <b>whose length is greater than its width and has houses and courtyards opening into it. And what is the</b> type of <b>courtyard</b> in <b>which</b> carrying <b>is not permitted by</b> means of <b>a side post or</b> a cross <b>beam, but by</b> an upright <b>board of four</b> handbreadths? <b>Any</b> courtyard <b>that is square.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara wonders: If it is <b>square,</b> then <b>yes,</b> is it considered a courtyard? If it is <b>round, no,</b> is it not considered a courtyard? The Gemara makes a correction: <b>This is</b> what <b>it is saying: If its length is greater than its width, it is</b> considered <b>an alleyway, and</b> for <b>an alleyway a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam suffices; but if</b> its length is <b>not</b> greater than its width, i.e., it is square, <b>it is</b> considered <b>a courtyard.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> by <b>how much</b> must its length exceed its width so that it can be considered an alleyway? <b>Shmuel thought</b> at first <b>to say:</b> It is not considered an alleyway <b>unless</b> its length <b>is double its width,</b> until <b>Rav said to him: My uncle</b> [<b><i>ḥavivi</i></b>], Rav Ḥiyya, <b>said this: Even</b> if its length is greater than its width by only <b>a minimal amount,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of an alleyway apply to it.

### Part 19
We learned in the mishna: <b>A certain disciple said</b> before Rabbi Akiva <b>in the name of Rabbi Yishmael, etc.</b>
