### Part 1
<b>but</b> later <b>reconsidered</b> and did not divorce her, <b>and a resident of his city found him and said: Your name is</b> the same <b>as my name, and your wife’s name is</b> the same <b>as my wife’s name,</b> and we reside in the same town; give me the bill of divorce, and I will use it to divorce my wife, then this document <b>is invalid to divorce with it?</b> Apparently, a man may not divorce his wife with a bill of divorce written for another woman, and the same should apply to the scroll of a <i>sota</i>.

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>How can you compare</b> the two cases? <b>There,</b> with regard to a bill of divorce, <b>it is written: “And he shall write for her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), and therefore <b>we require writing</b> it <b>in her name,</b> specifically for her; whereas <b>here,</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>, <b>it is written: “And he shall perform with her</b> all this ritual” (Numbers 5:30), and therefore <b>we require performance in her name.</b> In <b>her</b> case, the <b>performance is erasure;</b> however, writing of the scroll need not be performed specifically for her.

### Part 3
On the topic of Rabbi Meir and his Torah study, the Gemara cites an additional statement. <b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina said: It is revealed and known before the One Who spoke and the world came into being that in the generation of Rabbi Meir there was no</b> one of the Sages who is <b>his equal. Why</b> then <b>didn’t</b> the Sages <b>establish the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with his</b> opinion? It is <b>because his colleagues were unable to ascertain the profundity of his opinion.</b> He was so brilliant that he could present a cogent argument for any position, even if it was not consistent with the prevalent <i>halakha</i>. <b>As he</b> would <b>state with regard to</b> a ritually <b>impure</b> item that it is <b>pure, and display justification</b> for that ruling, and likewise he would state <b>with regard to</b> a ritually <b>pure</b> item that it is <b>impure, and display justification</b> for that ruling. The Sages were unable to distinguish between the statements that were <i>halakha</i> and those that were not.

### Part 4
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir was not his name; rather, Rabbi Nehorai was his name. And why was he called</b> by the <b>name Rabbi Meir?</b> It was <b>because he illuminates [<i>meir</i>] the eyes of the Sages in</b> matters of <b>the <i>halakha</i>. And Rabbi Nehorai was not the name</b> of the <i>tanna</i> known by that name; <b>rather, Rabbi Neḥemya was his name, and some say: Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh was his name. And why was he called</b> by the <b>name Rabbi Nehorai?</b> It is <b>because he enlightens [<i>manhir</i>] the eyes of the Sages in</b> matters of <b>the <i>halakha</i>.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> The fact <b>that I am</b> more <b>incisive than my colleagues is</b> due to the fact <b>that I saw Rabbi Meir from behind,</b> i.e., I sat behind him when I was his student. <b>Had I seen him from the front, I would be</b> even more <b>incisive, as it is written: “And your eyes shall see your teacher”</b> (Isaiah 30:20). Seeing the face of one’s teacher increases one’s understanding and sharpens one’s mind.

### Part 6
And the Gemara stated that <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Meir had a disciple, and his name was Sumakhus, who would state with regard to each and every matter of ritual impurity forty-eight reasons</b> in support of the ruling of <b>impurity, and with regard to each and every matter of ritual purity forty-eight reasons</b> in support of the ruling of <b>purity.</b>

### Part 7
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There was a distinguished disciple at Yavne who could</b> with his incisive intellect <b>purify the creeping animal,</b> explicitly deemed ritually impure by the Torah, adducing <b>one hundred and fifty reasons</b> in support of his argument.

### Part 8
<b>Ravina said: I</b> too <b>will deliberate and purify it</b> employing the following reasoning: <b>And just as a snake that kills</b> people and animals <b>and</b> thereby <b>increases ritual impurity</b> in the world, as a corpse imparts impurity through contact, through being carried, and by means of a tent, <b>is ritually pure</b> and transmits no impurity, <b>a creeping animal that does not kill and</b> does not <b>increase impurity</b> in the world, <b>all the more so</b> should it be pure.

### Part 9
The Gemara rejects this: <b>And it is not so;</b> that is not a valid <i>a fortiori</i> argument, as it can be refuted. A snake <b>is performing a mere act of a thorn.</b> A thorn causes injury and even death; nevertheless, it is not ritually impure. The same applies to a snake, and therefore this <i>a fortiori</i> argument is rejected.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: For three years Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagreed. These said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with our</b> opinion, <b>and these said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with our</b> opinion. Ultimately, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and proclaimed:</b> Both <b>these and those are the words of the living God. However, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>Since both these and those are the words of the living God, why were Beit Hillel privileged to</b> have <b>the <i>halakha</i> established in accordance with their</b> opinion? The reason is <b>that they were agreeable and forbearing,</b> showing restraint when affronted, and when they taught the <i>halakha</i> they would <b>teach</b> both <b>their</b> own <b>statements and the statements of Beit Shammai. Moreover,</b> when they formulated their teachings and cited a dispute, <b>they prioritized the statements of Beit Shammai to their</b> own <b>statements,</b> in deference to Beit Shammai.

### Part 12
<b>As</b> in the mishna <b>that we learned:</b> In the case of <b>one whose head and most of his body were in the <i>sukka</i>, but his table was in the house, Beit Shammai deem</b> this <i>sukka</i> <b>invalid; and Beit Hillel deem it valid. Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: Wasn’t there an incident in which the Elders of Beit Shammai and the Elders of Beit Hillel went to visit Rabbi Yoḥanan ben HaḤoranit, and they found him sitting</b> with <b>his head and most of his body in the <i>sukka</i>, but his table was in the house? Beit Shammai said to them: From there</b> do you seek to adduce <b>a proof?</b> Those visitors, <b>too, said to him: If that was</b> the manner in which <b>you were accustomed</b> to perform the mitzva, <b>you have never fulfilled the mitzva of <i>sukka</i> in</b> all <b>your days.</b> It is apparent from the phrasing of the mishna that when the Sages of Beit Hillel related that the Elders of Beit Shammai and the Elders of Beit Hillel visited Rabbi Yoḥanan ben HaḤoranit, they mentioned the Elders of Beit Shammai before their own Elders.

### Part 13
This is <b>to teach you that anyone who humbles himself, the Holy One, Blessed be He, exalts him, and anyone who exalts himself, the Holy One, Blessed be He, humbles him. Anyone who seeks greatness, greatness flees from him, and,</b> conversely, <b>anyone who flees from greatness, greatness seeks him. And anyone who</b> attempts to <b>force the moment</b> and expends great effort to achieve an objective precisely when he desires to do so, <b>the moment forces him</b> too, and he is unsuccessful. <b>And</b> conversely, <b>anyone who</b> is patient and <b>yields to the moment, the moment stands</b> by <b>his</b> side, and he will ultimately be successful.

### Part 14
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>For two and a half years, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagreed. These say: It would have been preferable had man not been created than to have been created. And those said: It is preferable for man to have been created than had he not been created.</b> Ultimately, <b>they were counted and concluded: It would have been preferable had man not been created than to have been created.</b> However, <b>now that he has been created, he should examine his actions</b> that he has performed and seek to correct them. <b>And some say: He should scrutinize his</b> planned <b>actions</b> and evaluate whether or not and in what manner those actions should be performed, so that he will not sin.

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The</b> cross <b>beam, which</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> may be used to render an alleyway fit for one to carry within it, must be <b>wide enough to receive</b> and hold <b>a small brick. And</b> this <b>small brick</b> is <b>half a large brick,</b> which measures <b>three handbreadths,</b> i.e., a handbreadth and a half. <b>It is sufficient that the</b> cross <b>beam will be a handbreadth in width,</b> not a handbreadth and a half, <b>enough to hold a small brick across its width.</b>

### Part 16
And the cross beam must be <b>wide enough to hold a small brick</b> and also <b>sturdy enough to hold a small brick</b> and not collapse. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If it is <b>wide</b> enough to hold the brick, <b>even though it is not sturdy</b> enough to actually support it, it is sufficient. Therefore, even if the cross beam <b>is</b> made <b>of straw or reeds, one considers it as though it were</b> made <b>of metal.</b>

### Part 17
If the cross beam is <b>curved,</b> so that a small brick cannot rest on it, <b>one considers it as though it were straight;</b> if it is <b>round, one considers it as though it were square.</b> The following principle was stated with regard to a round cross beam: <b>Any</b> beam <b>with a circumference of three handbreadths is a handbreadth in width,</b> i.e., in diameter.
