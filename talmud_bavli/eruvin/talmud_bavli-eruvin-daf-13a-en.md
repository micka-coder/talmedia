### Part 1
The mishna relates that a student recited a <i>halakha</i> before Rabbi Akiva, and he did not accept the student’s version of the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, as <b>Rabbi Akiva said: They disagree about this,</b> an alleyway less than four cubits wide, <b>and about that,</b> an alleyway more than four cubits wide.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: In that case, the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> is identical with the opinion <b>first <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna, as he too holds that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree in all cases, irrespective of the width of the alleyway. The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> stated by <b>Rav Aḥlai, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Yeḥiel,</b> that an alleyway less than four handbreadths wide requires no corrective action. However, their respective opinions <b>are not defined;</b> which <i>tanna</i> accepts the view of Rav Aḥlai and which <i>tanna</i> rejects it cannot be determined.

### Part 3
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva said: Rabbi Yishmael did not state this matter,</b> as it is unlikely that Rabbi Yishmael would err in this manner; <b>rather,</b> it was <b>that disciple who stated that matter</b> on his own, <b>and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that disciple.</b>

### Part 4
With regard to that <i>baraita</i> the Gemara asks: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself is difficult. You stated</b> initially that <b>Rabbi Yishmael did not state this matter; apparently the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of the disciple. <b>And then you said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that disciple.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Rabbi Akiva said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with that disciple <b>only to sharpen</b> the minds of <b>his students with</b> his statement. Seeking to encourage his students to suggest novel opinions, he praised that disciple before them but did not actually rule in accordance with the disciple’s opinion.

### Part 6
<b>And Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said,</b> in another attempt to resolve the contradiction: The statement of the disciple <b>appears</b> to be reasonable <b>was stated.</b> Although Rabbi Yishmael himself did not make that statement, the statement of the disciple is reasonable.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Anywhere that you find</b> a statement introduced with: <b>A certain disciple said before Rabbi Akiva in the name of Rabbi Yishmael, it is none other than Rabbi Meir,</b> who was the student <b>who served</b> both <b>Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 8
<b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir said: When I was</b> a student <b>with Rabbi Yishmael, I used to put iron sulfate [<i>kankantom</i>] into the ink</b> with which I wrote Torah scrolls, <b>and he did not say anything to me. When I came</b> to study <b>with Rabbi Akiva, he prohibited me</b> from doing <b>so.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara challenges this statement: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Shmuel said in the name of Rabbi Meir: When I studied with Rabbi Akiva</b> as his disciple, <b>I used to put iron sulfate into the ink, and he did not say anything to me. But when I came</b> to study <b>with Rabbi Yishmael, he said to me: My son, what is your vocation? I replied: I am a scribe [<i>lavlar</i>]</b> who writes Torah scrolls. <b>He said to me: My son, be careful in your vocation, as your vocation is heavenly service,</b> and care must be taken <b>lest you omit a single letter or add a single letter</b> out of place, <b>and you will end up destroying the whole world in its entirety.</b> Addition or omission of a single letter can change the meaning from truth [<i>emet</i>] to death [<i>met</i>].

### Part 10
<b>I said to him: I have one substance called iron sulfate, which I place into the ink,</b> and therefore I am not concerned. <b>He said to me: May one place iron sulfate into the ink? Didn’t the Torah state</b> with regard to <i>sota</i>: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall write</b> these curses in a book, <b>and he shall blot them out</b> into the water of bitterness” (Numbers 5:23)? The Torah requires <b>writing that can be blotted out.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara clarifies elements of the conversation: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>saying to</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>and what is he answering him?</b> Rabbi Meir’s response with regard to iron sulfate does not seem to address Rabbi Yishmael’s comments with regard to omissions and additions.

### Part 12
The Gemara explains that <b>this is</b> what Rabbi Meir <b>is saying to</b> Rabbi Yishmael: <b>There is no need</b> to mention <b>defective and plene</b> words, <b>as I am an expert; however, even with regard to the concern that a fly might come and land on the crown of</b> the letter <b><i>dalet</i> and blot it out and render it a <i>reish</i>,</b> thereby changing the meaning of the word, I am not concerned, as <b>I have a substance called iron sulfate that I place into the ink</b> so that it will not be erased.

### Part 13
Nevertheless, <b>there is a difficulty between service and service,</b> as one source states that Rabbi Meir initially served Rabbi Akiva, whereas the other source states that he served Rabbi Yishmael first. <b>There is a difficulty between</b> the words <b>he prohibited it</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, which is referring to Rabbi Akiva, <b>and he prohibited it</b> in the statement of Rav Yehuda, which is referring to Rabbi Yishmael.

### Part 14
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, there is no difficulty between</b> the accounts in the two sources with regard to <b>service and service,</b> as it can be suggested as follows: Rabbi Meir <b>initially came</b> to study <b>before Rabbi Akiva, and since he was unable to comprehend</b> the teachings <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion, <b>he came before Rabbi Yishmael and studied the tradition, and again came before Rabbi Akiva and studied logical</b> analysis. After studying the basic principles from Rabbi Yishmael, he was able to understand the more complex teachings of Rabbi Akiva.

### Part 15
Having reconciled the first difficulty, the Gemara continues: <b>However, the difficulty with regard to</b> whether Rabbi Akiva <b>prohibited</b> iron sulfate or Rabbi Yishmael <b>prohibited</b> it remains <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara notes: It indeed remains <b>difficult;</b> no answer was found.

### Part 16
The Gemara continues the discussion of iron sulfate. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: One may place iron sulfate into the ink</b> that is to be used <b>for all</b> sacred writings, <b>except for</b> the writing of <b>the</b> Torah <b>passage</b> with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i>,</b> as it must be possible to erase that writing. <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says in his name: Except for</b> the writing of <b>the</b> Torah <b>passage</b> with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i></b> used <b>in the Temple</b> in the ordeal to determine the guilt or innocence of the wife suspected of adultery.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between their</b> opinions, i.e., what is their point of dispute? The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yirmeya said:</b> The difference <b>between their</b> opinions <b>is</b> whether it is permissible <b>to erase</b> the passage of a <i>sota</i> <b>from a Torah</b> scroll. The <i>tanna’im</i> of the <i>baraita</i> disagree whether or not a section taken from a Torah scroll may be used for this purpose, or whether a special scroll must be written for use in the ordeal of the <i>sota</i>.

### Part 18
<b>And those <i>tanna’im</i></b> disagree in the same dispute <b>as these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A scroll that was written for one woman suspected of infidelity but was not used, <b>her scroll is not fit</b> to prepare the water <b>to give to another <i>sota</i> to drink.</b> However, <b>Rabbi Aḥai bar Yoshiya said: Her scroll is fit</b> to be used to prepare the water <b>to give another <i>sota</i> to drink.</b> The legal status of a Torah scroll, which is not written for a particular <i>sota</i>, should be the same.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Pappa said: Perhaps that is not</b> the case, as the two circumstances are not comparable. <b>The first <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>stated</b> his opinion that one woman’s scroll may not be used for another woman <b>only there; since it had</b> originally <b>been designated in the name of</b> one woman, e.g., <b>Rachel, it cannot then be designated in the name of</b> another woman, e.g., <b>Leah. However, in the case of a Torah</b> scroll, <b>which is written with no particular</b> person in mind, he <b>too</b> may say that <b>we</b> may <b>erase</b> it to be used for another woman, and it is not disqualified because it was not written in her name.

### Part 20
Furthermore, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> in another attempt to resolve the matter: <b>Perhaps it is not so,</b> as an additional distinction exists between the two cases: <b>Rabbi Aḥai bar Yoshiya stated</b> his opinion that the first woman’s scroll may be used for another woman <b>only there because at least,</b> in that case, <b>it was written for a</b> particular <b><i>sota</i> in the world. However, in the case of a Torah</b> scroll, <b>which was written for study,</b> he <b>too</b> would agree that <b>we do not erase</b> it.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Aḥai bar Yoshiya not hold</b> in accordance with <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>If one wrote a bill of divorce to divorce his wife,</b>
