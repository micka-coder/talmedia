### Part 1
<b>but</b> if the two breaches <b>are opposite one another,</b> you might <b>say</b> that it is <b>not</b> considered a private domain even with regard to Shabbat. Rav therefore teaches us that even if the breaches of the courtyard line up with each other, carrying is nonetheless permitted therein.

### Part 2
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And according to Rabba, who said</b> that where the alleyway terminates in a backyard and the breaches <b>are one opposite another,</b> carrying <b>is prohibited, how does</b> he <b>construe Rav’s</b> case? Rav’s ruling must refer to a case where the breaches <b>are not one opposite another,</b> and if so, <b>why do I</b> need <b>two</b> rulings? The essence of this <i>halakha</i>, that the yard is deemed a private domain with regard to Shabbat, was already stated in the <i>Tosefta</i>, so why did Rav need to teach another <i>halakha</i> with regard to the very same issue?

### Part 3
The Gemara explains that there is a novelty in Rav’s teaching: <b>If one</b> learned the <i>halakha</i> <b>from there,</b> the <i>Tosefta</i>, alone, <b>I would have said</b> that this ruling that the courtyard is a private domain with regard to Shabbat <b>only applies</b> to the issue <b>of throwing,</b> i.e., that one who throws from the public domain into this courtyard is liable, since it is considered a private domain according to Torah law. <b>But</b> to allow <b>carrying</b> in it like a proper private domain, you might <b>say no,</b> that the Sages forbade carrying in it, owing to the many people passing through it. Rav therefore <b>teaches us</b> that we are not concerned about this, and that carrying in the yard is permitted, even by rabbinic law.

### Part 4
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagree about the following matter: With regard to <b>an alleyway</b> that is <b>shaped like a centipede,</b> i.e., a long alleyway that opens to the public domain but with a series of small alleyways branching off of it on both of its sides, all of which also open to the public domain, <b>Abaye said:</b> An opening in <b>the form of a doorway is made for the large</b> alleyway, <b>and all the</b> small alleyways <b>are permitted by</b> means of <b>a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rava said to him: According to whom</b> do you state this <i>halakha</i>? Apparently according to the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> of</b> a crooked L-shaped alleyway <b>is like</b> that of an alleyway that is <b>closed</b> at one side. For in this case of an alleyway that is shaped like a centipede, when each of the smaller alleyways connects to the larger alleyway, it forms a crooked L-shaped alleyway. However, if the <i>halakha</i> is indeed in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel, <b>why is the form of a doorway</b> needed <b>for it?</b> According to Shmuel, an alleyway of this kind only requires a side post or a cross beam at each end in order to permit carrying within it. <b>And furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>the crooked,</b> L-shaped <b>alleyway in Neharde’a,</b> which was Shmuel’s place of residence, <b>didn’t they take into consideration</b> the position <b>of Rav?</b> This indicates that the <i>halakha</i> in practice follows Rav as opposed to Shmuel.

### Part 6
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> An alleyway made like a centipede can be rendered fit for one to carry within it as follows: An opening in <b>the form of a doorway is made for all of</b> the small alleyways <b>on this</b> one of their <b>sides, and the other side is permitted by</b> means of <b>a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara considers a new case: <b>Rav Kahana bar Taḥalifa said in the name of Rav Kahana bar Minyumi,</b> who said <b>in the name of Rav Kahana bar Malkiyu,</b> who said <b>in the name of Rav Kahana, the teacher of Rav; and some say</b> that <b>Rav Kahana bar Malkiyu is Rav Kahana, the teacher of Rav:</b> With regard to <b>an alleyway that</b> opens into the public domain, <b>its one side</b> being <b>long and its other side</b> being <b>short,</b> i.e., one side juts out into the public domain more than the other, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If the difference in length between the two sides is <b>less than four cubits, the</b> cross <b>beam is placed diagonally</b> across the opening between the ends of the two walls of the alleyway. If, however, the difference is <b>four cubits</b> or more, <b>the</b> cross <b>beam is placed</b> straight <b>across</b> the alleyway at the end <b>of the short</b> side, i.e., at the end of the short side straight across toward the corresponding spot on the longer wall such that the beam is perpendicular to both walls, and no use may be made of the portion of the alleyway that lies beyond the cross beam. <b>Rava</b> disagreed and <b>said:</b> In <b>both this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, <b>the</b> cross <b>beam is placed</b> straight <b>across</b> the alleyway at the end <b>of the short</b> side.

### Part 8
Rava added: <b>I will state my reason, and I will state their reason. I will state my reason: What is the reason for a</b> cross <b>beam?</b> To function <b>as a conspicuous marker</b> that separates the alleyway from the public domain, so that the residents of the alleyway should know the boundary within which carrying is permitted, <b>and</b> when placed <b>diagonally,</b> the cross beam <b>is not</b> sufficiently <b>conspicuous.</b> Those who see people carrying in the section extending past the short side will think that one is generally permitted to carry in a public domain.

### Part 9
<b>I will state their reason</b> as well: <b>What is the reason for a</b> cross <b>beam? To</b> function <b>as a partition,</b> that is to say, the cross beam is considered as though it descended to the ground, creating a fourth wall for the alleyway. Hence, <b>even</b> when placed <b>diagonally, it is</b> considered <b>a partition.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rav Kahana said: Since this</b> involves <b><i>halakhot</i> of</b> Sages named <b>Kahana,</b> I too <b>will say something</b> with regard <b>to it: That which you said,</b> that <b>the</b> cross <b>beam is placed diagonally</b> across the alleyway, this <b>was only said</b> in a case <b>where the diagonal is no more than ten</b> cubits. <b>But if the diagonal is more than ten</b> cubits, then even if the width of the alleyway itself is less than ten cubits, <b>all agree that</b> the cross beam <b>must be placed</b> straight <b>across</b> the alleyway at the end of <b>the short</b> side, for an entrance wider than ten cubits cannot be permitted by a cross beam, and here the entire length under the cross beam is considered an entrance.

### Part 11
<b>A dilemma was raised</b> before the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>utilizing</b> and carrying in the area <b>beneath the</b> cross <b>beam</b> spanning the opening of an alleyway, which the beam permits carrying? Opinions differ on the matter. <b>Rav, Rabbi Ḥiyya, and Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is permitted to utilize</b> the area <b>beneath the</b> cross <b>beam. Shmuel, Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi, and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: It is prohibited to utilize</b> the area <b>beneath the</b> cross <b>beam.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara suggests a way to understand this dispute: <b>Shall we say</b> that these <i>amora’im</i> <b>argue over the following</b> issue, <b>that Master,</b> representing those who permit it, <b>holds: A</b> cross <b>beam serves</b> in an alleyway <b>as a conspicuous marker</b> that separates it from the public domain, <b>and Master,</b> representing those who prohibit it, <b>holds: A</b> cross <b>beam serves as a partition.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No, everyone</b> might <b>agree</b> that <b>a</b> cross <b>beam serves as a conspicuous marker, but here they argue over the following: Master,</b> representing those who forbid it, <b>holds</b> that <b>the conspicuous marker</b> is intended for those situated <b>inside</b> the alleyway, and hence the area outside the inner edge of the cross beam may not be used; <b>and Master,</b> representing those who permit it, <b>holds</b> that <b>the conspicuous marker</b> is intended for those <b>outside</b> in the public domain, and it is therefore permitted to carry up to the outer edge of the cross beam.

### Part 14
The Gemara proposes an alternative explanation: <b>And if you wish,</b> you can <b>say that everyone</b> agrees that a cross beam permits carrying <b>as a partition, and here they argue over the following</b> issue: <b>As</b> one <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>the inner edge</b> of the cross beam <b>descends</b> to the ground <b>and seals off</b> the alleyway, and therefore under the cross beam is not within the closed-off area; <b>and the</b> other <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>the</b> cross <b>beam’s outer edge descends</b> to the ground <b>and seals off</b> the alleyway, and therefore it is permitted to carry even in the area beneath the cross beam. Consequently, there is no need to connect the dispute with regard to utilizing the area beneath the cross beam to the dispute with regard to the nature of the cross beam.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: All concede</b> that utilizing the area <b>between the side posts</b> placed at the entrance to an alleyway to permit carrying <b>is prohibited,</b> for a side post functions as a partition, and therefore one may only use the space up to its inner edge, but no further.

### Part 16
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raised a dilemma before Rav Ḥisda: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in a case where a person <b>inserted two pegs in the two alleyway walls,</b> one in each wall, <b>on the outside</b> of the entrance facing the public domain, <b>and he placed a</b> cross <b>beam on top of</b> the pegs, such that the beam is attached to the front of the alleyway walls instead of on top of them? Does this cross beam permit carrying within the alleyway?

### Part 17
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: According to the statement of</b> the one <b>who permits</b> utilizing the area beneath the cross beam, carrying within the alleyway <b>is prohibited,</b> for he holds that the cross beam’s outer edge is the critical one, and here this outer edge is positioned outside the alleyway and therefore cannot permit it. Whereas <b>according to the statement of</b> the authority <b>who prohibits</b> utilizing the area beneath the cross beam, carrying in the alleyway <b>is permitted,</b> for the cross beam’s inner edge is attached to the entrance of the alleyway.

### Part 18
<b>Rava,</b> however, disagreed and <b>said: Even according to the opinion of</b> the one <b>who prohibits</b> utilizing the area beneath the cross beam, carrying in the alleyway <b>is prohibited, for we require</b> that <b>the</b> cross <b>beam</b> that permits the alleyway be placed <b>on top of</b> the walls of <b>the alleyway, and</b> it <b>is not.</b> A cross beam that merely touches the alleyway from the outside does not permit it.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Adda bar Mattana raised an objection to Rava</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If the</b> cross <b>beam</b> being used to render an alleyway permitted for carrying <b>is</b>
