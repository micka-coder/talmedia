### Part 1
But if the courtyard is <b>less than four cubits</b> by four cubits in area, <b>one</b> simply <b>pours</b> the water out, as the place is not fit for sprinkling. Therefore, <b>if one fashioned a pit, it is permitted</b> to pour out water; but if <b>not, it is prohibited</b> to do so, as one certainly intends for the water to flow outside.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Zeira</b> offered a different reason and <b>said:</b> In a courtyard of <b>four cubits</b> by four cubits, the water is likely to be <b>absorbed</b> into the ground. If it is <b>less than four cubits</b> in size, the water <b>will not be absorbed</b> but will flow out.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical <b>difference between</b> these two explanations? <b>Abaye said: There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to a <b>long and narrow</b> courtyard. As the area of this courtyard is also sixteen square cubits, it likewise absorbs the water. Rabbi Zeira would therefore rule that it does not require a pit. However, as this courtyard is not in need of sprinkling, it requires a pit according to Rabba.

### Part 4
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>A courtyard and a portico combine for the</b> requisite <b>four cubits,</b> permitted the pouring of water into a courtyard that lacks a pit. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zeira,</b> this <b>works out well,</b> as the total area is large enough to absorb the water. <b>However, according to Rabba it is difficult,</b> for when the courtyard is joined with the portico it is no longer in the shape of a square, and it is therefore unfit for sprinkling.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Zeira explained</b> the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba,</b> by saying that it is referring <b>to a portico that extends along the entire courtyard,</b> so that it adds to its width alone. Consequently, the courtyard and the portico together form a square of four by four cubits, an area that is fit for sprinkling.

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i> that can decide this dispute. With regard to <b>a courtyard that is not four cubits by four cubits</b> in area, <b>one may not pour water into it on Shabbat.</b> The Gemara assumes that the <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that one may pour water only into a courtyard that it is four by four cubits, is precise in its wording. <b>Granted, according to Rabba,</b> this <b>works out well,</b> as he maintains that it is prohibited to pour water into a long and narrow courtyard. <b>However, according to Rabbi Zeira,</b> who maintains that the critical factor is the area of the courtyard, this is <b>difficult.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> can <b>say to you:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> at the end of the mishna, who maintain that the area of the courtyard is of no importance, <b>whereas our</b> unattributed <b>mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> according to whom the area is the decisive factor.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And what forced Rabbi Zeira to establish the mishna in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov? Rava said: The mishna was difficult for him. Why</b> did the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically teach</b> his ruling with respect to <b>a courtyard that is less</b> than four cubits, from which it can be inferred that if it has an area of four by four cubits it is permitted to pour water, even if it is not square in shape? <b>Let</b> the mishna <b>teach: A courtyard that is not four cubits by four cubits,</b> i.e., one that is not square shaped, even if it includes an area of sixteen square cubits.

### Part 9
<b>Rather, shouldn’t one conclude from this</b> argument that the unattributed section of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov?</b> The Gemara summarizes: Indeed, <b>conclude from this</b> that it is so.

### Part 10
The Gemara raises a difficulty with this conclusion: <b>But from</b> the fact that <b>a latter clause</b> of the mishna explicitly cites the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> it can be inferred that <b>the first clause</b> does <b>not</b> represent the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara rejects this argument: In fact, <b>the entire</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, and</b> as for its problematic style, the mishna <b>is incomplete and it teaches the following:</b> With regard to <b>a courtyard that is less than four cubits</b> in area, <b>one may not pour</b> waste <b>water into it on Shabbat. Consequently,</b> if it is <b>four cubits</b> in area, <b>one may pour</b> water into it, <b>as Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> If the first <b>four cubits of a</b> drainage <b>ditch were arched over in the public domain, one may pour</b> waste <b>water into it on Shabbat.</b>

### Part 12
We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> If the first four cubits of a drainage <b>ditch were arched over</b> in the public domain, it is permitted to pour waste water into it on Shabbat. However, the Rabbis say: One may pour water only upon the roof, from which it will spill into the drain of its own accord.

### Part 13
The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna</b> was <b>not</b> taught <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya. For it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Ḥananya says: Even</b> with regard to <b>a roof one hundred cubits</b> in area, <b>one may not pour</b> water onto it, <b>because a roof is not apt to absorb</b> the water. <b>Rather, it</b> causes it <b>to run off.</b> Consequently, pouring water onto this roof is equivalent to pouring it directly outside.

### Part 14
A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught: In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that a pit is required, <b>said? In the summer, but in the rainy season, one may pour and repeat, and</b> he need <b>not hold back. What is the reason? Rava said: A person is</b> equally <b>willing for the water to be absorbed on the spot,</b> i.e., as there is abundant water in the courtyard during the rainy season, it will remain muddy in any case, and he therefore does not care whether the added waste water remains in the courtyard or if it flows out.

### Part 15
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> With regard to <b>waste</b> water poured into a drainage ditch, <b>that a person wants it to be absorbed</b> in the ditch itself, rather than flow out, <b>and</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches</b> that <b>one may not pour</b> water into the ditch.

### Part 16
Rava <b>said to him: There,</b> during the rainy season, there is no reason to prohibit the practice, for <b>with regard to what need we be concerned? If</b> you say he wants the water to flow out into the public domain <b>because</b> he is concerned about <b>spoiling</b> and sullying <b>his courtyard,</b> it is <b>already spoiled</b> by the rainwater. <b>And if</b> you say it should be prohibited <b>due to a decree lest</b> people <b>say</b> that <b>so-and-so’s gutter is flowing with water</b> on Shabbat, which might lead them to think he is watering his garden or violating some other prohibition, and they might act likewise even in the summer, this is not a relevant concern. As <b>gutters ordinarily flow</b> with water in the rainy season, people do not entertain this suspicion.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Naḥman said: In the rainy season,</b> with regard to <b>a pit that holds two <i>se’a</i>, we grant him</b> permission to pour <b>two <i>se’a</i></b> of water into it. If it <b>holds</b> only <b>one <i>se’a</i>, we grant him one <i>se’a</i>.</b> However, <b>in the summer,</b> if the pit has a capacity of <b>two <i>se’a</i>, we grant him two <i>se’a</i>;</b> if it holds only <b>one <i>se’a</i>, we do not grant him</b> permission to pour any water <b>at all.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>In the hot season as well,</b> if the pit <b>holds one <i>se’a</i>, let us grant him one <i>se’a</i>,</b> for if he pours only this amount of water, it will not flow out into the public domain. The Gemara answers: This is prohibited due to <b>a decree lest he come to put two <i>se’a</i> into it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so, in the rainy season let us also apply the</b> same <b>preventive measure.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the rainy season, there is no reason to prohibit the practice, for if one pours more water into a pit than it can take, <b>about what need we be concerned? If</b> you say he wants the waste water to flow out into the public domain <b>because</b> he is concerned about <b>spoiling</b> his courtyard, <b>it is already spoiled</b> by the rainwater. <b>If</b> you say it should be prohibited due to <b>a decree lest</b> people <b>say</b> that <b>so-and-so’s gutter is flowing with water</b> on Shabbat, <b>gutters ordinarily gush</b> with water in the rainy season, as stated above.

### Part 20
<b>Abaye said: Therefore,</b> in accordance with this reasoning, one can pour <b>even a <i>kor</i> and even two <i>kor</i></b> of waste water into a small pit. As all gutters flow with water in the rainy season, there is no cause for any concern.

### Part 21
We learned in the mishna: <b>And likewise,</b> with regard to <b>two upper stories, one opposite the other</b> in the same courtyard, the residents of the one who dug a pit in the courtyard may pour water into it, while the residents of the other one who did not dig a pit in the courtyard are prohibited from doing so. <b>Rava said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even if</b> the residents of the two upper stories <b>established an <i>eiruv</i></b> together.

### Part 22
<b>Abaye said to him: What is the reason</b> for this ruling? <b>If you say</b> it is <b>due to the increase</b> in the amount <b>of water,</b> as two upper stories pour out more water than one, <b>wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The same</b> <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>a pit, and the same</b> applies to <b>a cracked</b> earthenware <b>vessel</b> used as a receptacle for water, or a small <b>pond, or a basin: Even though they were</b> already <b>filled with water on Shabbat eve, one may pour water into them on Shabbat.</b> It is evident from here that as long as the pit is the requisite size, there is no concern about the amount of water that will flow out from it.

### Part 23
<b>Rather, if it was stated it was stated as follows. Rava said:</b>
