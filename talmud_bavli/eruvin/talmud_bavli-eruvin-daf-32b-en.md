### Part 1
<b>holds: That <i>ḥaver</i>,</b> who heard the first <i>ḥaver</i> speaking to the <i>am ha’aretz</i>, <b>may</b> immediately <b>eat</b> from the basket, <b>and he is not required to tithe</b> the produce, <b>as the first <i>ḥaver</i> certainly separated tithes for</b> the person who picked the figs, as he would not have caused an <i>am ha’aretz</i> to eat <i>tevel</i>. <b>And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> That <i>ḥaver</i> <b>may not eat</b> of the fruit <b>until he has tithed</b> them, <b>for <i>ḥaverim</i> are not suspected of separating</b> <i>teruma</i> and tithes <b>from</b> produce that is <b>not adjacent</b> to the produce they seek to exempt. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: It is better that <i>ḥaverim</i> should be suspected of separating</b> <i>teruma</i> and tithes <b>from</b> produce that is <b>not adjacent</b> to the produce they seek to exempt, <b>and they should not feed <i>amei ha’aretz</i></b> produce that is <b><i>tevel</i>.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds: It is preferable to a <i>ḥaver</i> that he commit a minor transgression,</b> namely separating tithes from produce that is not adjacent to the produce they seek to exempt, so that <b>an <i>am ha’aretz</i> will not commit</b> the <b>major transgression</b> of eating <i>tevel</i> on his account. <b>And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds: It is preferable to a <i>ḥaver</i> that an <i>am ha’aretz</i> commit a major transgression, and that he</b> himself <b>not commit even a minor transgression.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one placed</b> his <i>eiruv</i> <b>in a tree above ten handbreadths</b> from the ground, <b>his <i>eiruv</i> is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>;</b> if it is <b>below ten handbreadths, his <i>eiruv</i> is</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b> If <b>he placed</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>in a pit, even</b> if <b>it was a hundred cubits deep, his <i>eiruv</i> is</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba sat, and</b> with him sat <b>Rabbi Asi and Rava bar Natan, and Rav Naḥman sat beside them, and they sat and said: This tree</b> mentioned in the mishna, <b>where does it stand? If you say it stands in the private domain, what</b> is the difference <b>to me</b> whether the <i>eiruv</i> is placed <b>above</b> ten handbreadths or <b>below</b> ten handbreadths? <b>The private domain ascends to the sky,</b> and there is no difference whether an object is above or below ten handbreadths.

### Part 5
<b>Rather,</b> say <b>that</b> the tree <b>stands in the public domain;</b> but in that case the question arises: <b>Where</b> did the person <b>intend to establish his Shabbat residence? If you say that</b> he <b>intended to</b> establish his <b>Shabbat residence</b> in the tree <b>above, he and his <i>eiruv</i> are in one place.</b> Consequently, the <i>eiruv</i> should be valid, even if is at a height of more than ten handbreadths. <b>Rather,</b> say that he <b>intended to establish his Shabbat residence</b> on the ground <b>below;</b> but <b>isn’t he making use of the tree</b> if he accesses his <i>eiruv</i>? It is prohibited to make use of a tree on Shabbat, and therefore his <i>eiruv</i> should invalid even if it is less than ten handbreadths above the ground because it is inaccessible to him.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> we can accept the latter assumption <b>that</b> the tree <b>stands in the public domain, and that he intended to establish his Shabbat residence</b> on the ground <b>below,</b> in the public domain. <b>And</b> with regard to the prohibition against making use of a tree, this mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said: Anything that is</b> prohibited on Shabbat not by Torah law, but rather <b>due to a rabbinic decree [<i>shevut</i>],</b> the Sages <b>did not issue the decree</b> to apply <b>during twilight,</b> which is neither definitively day nor definitively night. Since using a tree is only prohibited due to a <i>shevut</i>, it is permitted to make use of the tree and remove one’s <i>eiruv</i> from it during the twilight period, which is when the <i>eiruv</i> establishes the person’s Shabbat residence. Therefore, the <i>eiruv</i> is valid, provided that it is below ten handbreadths. If, however, the <i>eiruv</i> is above ten handbreadths, it is invalid. At that height, removing the <i>eiruv</i> from the tree entails violation of the Torah prohibition of carrying from a private domain to a public domain, which is prohibited even during twilight.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Naḥman said to them: Well</b> said, <b>and Shmuel said similarly</b> with regard to this issue. <b>They said to him: Have you,</b> the Sages of Babylonia, <b>gone so far in your explanation</b> of the mishna? The Gemara asks: Why were the Sages of Eretz Yisrael so surprised? <b>They, too, explained</b> the mishna <b>in this</b> manner. <b>Rather, this is what they said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>Have you established this</b> explanation <b>as part of your</b> regular <b>study</b> of the mishna? <b>He said to them: Yes.</b> Indeed, <b>it was also</b> explicitly <b>stated</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Here, we are dealing with a tree standing in the public domain,</b> and the tree is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide.</b> It thereby constitutes a private domain, <b>and</b> one <b>intended to establish his Shabbat residence below</b> in the public domain. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said: Anything that is</b> prohibited on Shabbat not by Torah law, but rather <b>due to a rabbinic decree,</b> the Sages <b>did not issue the decree</b> to apply <b>during twilight.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rava said</b> in continuation of this discussion: <b>They only taught</b> this law <b>with regard to a tree that stands beyond the outskirts of the city,</b> i.e., outside a radius of seventy and two-thirds cubits around the city. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a tree that stands within the outskirts of the city, even</b> if the <i>eiruv</i> was placed <b>above ten</b> handbreadths, <b>it is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>, as the city is considered as though it were filled in</b> with earth, so that anything located at any height within the town itself or its outskirts is regarded as being in the same domain. Even though the person intended to establish his Shabbat residence below the tree in the public domain, we view the ground as raised to the height of the <i>eiruv</i>, and his <i>eiruv</i> is therefore valid even though he cannot actually remove it from the tree during the twilight period.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if the tree stood <b>beyond the outskirts of the town,</b> there should <b>also</b> be no difference whether the <i>eiruv</i> is above or below the height of ten handbreadths. <b>Since Rava</b> himself <b>said: One who places his <i>eiruv</i></b> in a particular location <b>has four cubits</b> surrounding him that are considered as a private domain, here too, the area should be considered <b>a private domain; and a private domain rises to the sky.</b> Since the tree stands within this area, all parts of the tree should be regarded as a private domain regardless of their height.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Mesharshiya, said: Here, we are dealing with a tree that leans out</b> horizontally <b>beyond four cubits</b> from its trunk, and one placed the <i>eiruv</i> on a section that is beyond four cubits,
