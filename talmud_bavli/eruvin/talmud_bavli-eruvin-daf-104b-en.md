### Part 1
<b>they were soaking flax</b> in the water, <b>he prohibited them</b> from drawing water by means of a wheel, so that they should not draw water for prohibited purposes.

### Part 2
We learned in the mishna that water may be drawn on a Festival <b>from the Heker Well.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the Heker Well? Shmuel said:</b> It is <b>a cistern with regard to which they advanced</b> [<b><i>hikru</i></b>] <b>arguments and permitted</b> drawing water from <b>it</b> on a Festival, by proving that the Torah permits doing so.

### Part 3
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>They did not permit all Heker wells, but only this one. And if you say</b> it was named because it is a cistern <b>with regard to which they put forward arguments</b> and permitted it, <b>what is</b> the meaning of Heker wells in the plural, and what does <b>only this one</b> mean? If it was named because of a particular announcement, how could other wells, about which no announcement was issued, bear the same name?

### Part 4
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The term Heker well denotes <b>a well of living water, as it is stated: “As a well keeps its water fresh</b> [<b><i>hakir</i></b>], so she keeps fresh her wickedness” (Jeremiah 6:7), i.e., it is a well of spring water.

### Part 5
Returning to <b>the matter itself,</b> the Gemara cites the above <i>baraita</i> in full: <b>They did not permit all Heker wells, but only this one. And when the exiles ascended</b> from Babylonia, <b>they encamped by it, and the prophets among them,</b> Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, <b>permitted</b> it <b>to them. And it was not</b> really <b>the prophets among them</b> who permitted them to draw water from this well on a Festival, <b>but</b> rather, it was <b>a customary practice</b> that was handed down <b>to them from their forefathers,</b> a practice the prophets permitted them to continue.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to the carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> of one of the eight species of reptile or rodent listed in Leviticus 11:29–30, one of the primary sources of ritual impurity <b>that is found in the Temple, a priest</b> should <b>carry it out</b> on Shabbat <b>in his girdle,</b> which was one of the priestly garments. Although the girdle will be defiled by the carcass of the creeping animal, this is the best way to proceed, <b>so as not to delay</b> the removal of <b>the impurity</b> from the Temple. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The creeping animal carcass should be removed <b>with wooden prongs, so as not to increase the impurity,</b> as a wooden prong is not susceptible to impurity.

### Part 7
It is obvious that on a weekday the creeping animal carcass is removed from wherever it is found in the Temple, but <b>from where does one remove it</b> on Shabbat? <b>From the Sanctuary, from the Entrance Hall, and from</b> the area in the courtyard <b>between the Entrance Hall and the altar,</b> the most sanctified precincts of the Temple. However, it need not be removed from the rest of the courtyard. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Akiva says: Any place where one is liable to</b> be punished with <b><i>karet</i></b> if he <b>intentionally</b> enters there in a state of ritual impurity, <b>and</b> is liable to bring a <b>sin-offering</b> if he does so <b>unwittingly, from there one</b> must <b>remove it.</b> This includes the entire area of the Temple courtyard. <b>And</b> as for <b>the rest of the places</b> in the Temple, <b>one covers</b> the creeping animal carcass <b>with a bowl [<i>pesakhter</i>]</b> and leaves it there until the conclusion of Shabbat.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that this is the principle: <b>Wherever the Sages permitted</b> something <b>to you, they granted you</b> only <b>from your own, as they permitted to you only</b> activities that are prohibited <b>due to rabbinic decree,</b> not labors prohibited by Torah law.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Tavi bar Kisna said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>one who brings into the Temple</b> an object that was <b>defiled by a creeping animal</b> carcass, <b>he is liable,</b> but if he brings in the carcass of <b>a creeping animal itself, he is exempt. What is the reason</b> for this distinction? <b>The verse said: “Both male and female shall you put out,</b> without the camp shall you put them; that they defile not their camp, in the midst whereof I dwell” (Numbers 5:3). This verse teaches that the obligation to send out of the camp applies only to <b>one who has</b> the option of <b>purification in a ritual bath,</b> i.e., the male and female mentioned by the Torah; this <b>excludes</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal, which has no purification.</b> Consequently, one who brings the carcass of a creeping animal into the Temple is exempt, as he did not transgress the Torah’s commandment to send away the impure.

### Part 11
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that a <i>baraita</i> <b>supports him: “Both male and female shall you put out”;</b> this <b>excludes an earthenware vessel.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. What is the reason</b> for this? Is it <b>not because</b> an earthenware vessel <b>does not have purification in a ritual bath,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rav Tavi bar Kisna?

### Part 12
The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>No,</b> the reason is that only <b>something that can become a primary source of ritual impurity,</b> i.e., a human being or a metal utensil, must be sent out of the camp. This <b>excludes an earthenware vessel, which cannot become a primary source of ritual impurity.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this issue, whether or not there is liability for bringing a creeping animal carcass into the Temple, is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as we learned in the mishna: With regard to <b>a creeping animal</b> carcass <b>that is found in the Temple, a priest</b> should <b>carry it out</b> on Shabbat <b>in his girdle, so as not to delay</b> the removal of <b>the impurity.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. Rabbi Yehuda says: He</b> should <b>remove it with wooden prongs, so as not to increase the impurity.</b>

### Part 14
<b>What, isn’t it</b> the case <b>that this</b> is the matter with regard to which the two <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree: The one who said</b> we should <b>not delay</b> the removal of the impurity <b>maintains</b> that <b>one who brings a creeping animal</b> carcass <b>into the Temple is liable,</b> and therefore every effort must be made to remove it immediately. <b>And the one who said</b> we should <b>not increase impurity maintains</b> that <b>one who brings a creeping animal</b> carcass <b>into the Temple is exempt.</b> As no special command is in effect, the correct procedure is to prevent any additional impurity.

### Part 15
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>No, everyone agrees</b> that one who brings a creeping animal carcass itself into the Temple <b>is liable, and here, this</b> is the matter with regard to which <b>they disagree: The</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, <b>holds: Delaying</b> removal of the <b>impurity</b> is the consideration that <b>takes precedence.</b> Consequently, it is permitted even to defile the priestly garments to prevent any delay in the removal of the impurity from the holy place. <b>Whereas the</b> other <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds: Increasing impurity</b> is the consideration that <b>takes precedence,</b> and therefore the impurity should be removed only by means of wooden prongs.

### Part 16
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara suggests that this issue is the subject of a dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>, as we learned</b> in that same mishna: <b>From where does one remove</b> the creeping animal carcass? Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas and Rabbi Akiva disagree whether it is removed only from the Sanctuary, the Entrance Hall, and the area of the courtyard between the Entrance Hall and the altar, or from the entire area of the courtyard as well.

### Part 17
<b>Isn’t it</b> the case <b>that</b> the two <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree about the following: The one who said</b> we do <b>not</b> remove it <b>from the</b> Temple <b>courtyard maintains</b> that <b>one who brings a creeping animal</b> carcass <b>into the Temple is exempt,</b> and there is therefore no obligation to remove it from the courtyard on Shabbat. <b>And the one who said that</b> it must be removed <b>from the entire courtyard maintains</b> that one who brings a creeping animal carcass into the Temple <b>is liable.</b>
