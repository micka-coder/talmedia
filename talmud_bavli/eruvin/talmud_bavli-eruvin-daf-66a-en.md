### Part 1
<b>You acted well when you rented.</b> The Sages <b>of Neharde’a wondered</b> at this teaching: <b>Did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> just the opposite: <b>Renting</b> from a gentile <b>is like establishing an <i>eiruv</i>? What, is</b> he <b>not</b> to be understood as imposing a stringency: <b>Just as one</b> who <b>establishes an <i>eiruv</i></b> may do so only <b>while it is still day, so</b> too, <b>one</b> who <b>rents</b> a gentile’s property must do so <b>while it is still day?</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> his statement was intended as a leniency: <b>Just as one who establishes an <i>eiruv</i></b> may do so <b>even with less than the value of a <i>peruta</i>, so</b> too, <b>one who rents</b> a gentile’s property may rent it for <b>less than the value of a <i>peruta</i>. And just as</b> the <b>one who establishes an <i>eiruv</i></b> need not be the owner himself, but <b>even his hired laborer or harvester</b> may do so, <b>so</b> too, <b>one who rents</b> a gentile’s property need not rent from the landlord himself, <b>but</b> may rent <b>even</b> from <b>his hired laborer or harvester</b> who are acting on his behalf.

### Part 3
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>one who establishes an <i>eiruv</i>,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that if <b>five</b> people <b>live in the same courtyard, one</b> of them may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> with the residents of a different courtyard <b>on behalf of them all, so</b> too, with regard to <b>one who rents</b> a gentile’s property; if <b>five</b> people <b>live in the same courtyard</b> together with a gentile, <b>one</b> of them may <b>rent</b> the gentile’s property <b>on behalf of them all.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Elazar wondered</b> at Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling that the Sages had acted well when they rented the gentile’s property on Shabbat and then they renounced their rights to that one, so that at least it would be permitted to use the courtyard. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: What</b> was the reason for <b>Rabbi Elazar’s wonder? Rav Sheshet said:</b> Can it be that <b>such a great person as Rabbi Zeira did not know what</b> was the source <b>of Rabbi Elazar’s wonder? He had difficulty with</b> a statement <b>of his teacher, Shmuel.</b>

### Part 5
<b>As Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>any place where</b> the residents <b>render it prohibited for</b> each other to carry <b>but</b> where <b>they</b> may <b>establish a</b> joint <b><i>eiruv</i></b> if they so desire, in order to permit carrying, each may <b>renounce</b> his property rights for the other if they failed to establish an <i>eiruv</i> before Shabbat. However, in a place <b>where</b> the residents may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> together <b>but they do not render it prohibited</b> for each other for carrying, or where <b>they render it prohibited for</b> each other for carrying <b>but they</b> may <b>not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> together, in such situations <b>they</b> may <b>not renounce</b> their property rights for each other.

### Part 6
The Gemara clarifies the above teaching: With regard to <b>any place where</b> the residents render it <b>prohibited</b> for each other to carry <b>but</b> where <b>they</b> may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i>, they may renounce</b> their rights for each other, <b>such as</b> in the case of <b>two courtyards, one within the other.</b> The residents of the two courtyards render each other prohibited to carry between the courtyards, but they may establish a joint <i>eiruv</i> in order to permit carrying. In such a case, the residents may renounce their property rights for each other if they failed to establish an <i>eiruv</i> before Shabbat.

### Part 7
In a place <b>where</b> the residents may <b>establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> together <b>but they do not render</b> each other <b>prohibited</b> to carry, <b>they</b> may <b>not renounce</b> their property rights for each other, in a case <b>where two courtyards</b> both opening to an alleyway <b>that have a single opening between them.</b> Even though the two courtyards may establish a joint <i>eiruv</i> and be considered a single courtyard, they do not render it prohibited for each other to carry if they did not do so, because neither needs to make use of the other. Consequently, there is no option of renouncing rights in favor of the other courtyard.

### Part 8
In a place <b>where they render</b> each other <b>prohibited</b> from carrying <b>but they</b> may <b>not establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> together, <b>what</b> does this come <b>to include?</b> In reference to which case did Shmuel make this statement? <b>Wasn’t it</b> meant to <b>include a gentile</b> who shares a courtyard with two Jews? The Jewish residents of the courtyard render each other prohibited from carrying in such a case, but they may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> due to the presence of the gentile.

### Part 9
The Gemara further analyzes the case: <b>Now, if</b> it is referring to a situation <b>where</b> the gentile <b>arrived on the previous day,</b> i.e., before Shabbat, <b>let him rent</b> the property from the gentile <b>on the previous day.</b> Before Shabbat, both options were available: They could have either established an <i>eiruv</i> or one Jew could have renounced his rights in favor of the other. Therefore, it would not have been considered a situation in which they render each other prohibited to carry but cannot establish an <i>eiruv</i>.
