### Part 1
<b>One prepares a board ten</b> handbreadths <b>high with a length of four cubits and stands it lengthwise</b> down the middle <b>of the alleyway,</b> and thereby forms two small alleyways at the entrance to the alleyway, neither of which is more than ten cubits wide.

### Part 2
<b>Alternatively,</b> one can act <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> as <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> If <b>an alleyway is fifteen cubits wide,</b> how does one reduce its width? <b>He distances</b> himself <b>two cubits</b> from one of the walls of the alleyway <b>and prepares a board three cubits</b> wide, thereby leaving an opening of only ten cubits.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> must one reduce the width in this manner? <b>One</b> could also <b>prepare a board a cubit and a half</b> wide, <b>and distance</b> himself <b>two cubits, and</b> then <b>prepare</b> another board <b>a cubit and a half</b> wide, leaving the alleyway with an opening of only ten cubits. Apparently, one may <b>conclude from</b> the fact that Rav Yehuda did not suggest <b>this</b> possibility that if the <b>standing</b> segment of a wall is <b>greater than the breached</b> segment only when one combines the standing segments <b>from two directions,</b> i.e., both sides of the breach, it <b>is not considered</b> as though the <b>standing</b> segment were greater.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Actually, I would say to you</b> that ordinarily <b>it is considered</b> as <b>standing</b> even when one must combine the standing segments on the two sides of the breach. <b>However, it is different here, as the air,</b> i.e., the two cubit opening, <b>of this</b> one <b>side</b> of the far board <b>and the air,</b> i.e., the ten cubit opening, <b>of this</b> other <b>side</b> of the board <b>come</b> together <b>and negate it.</b> Therefore, in this case, the board that is farther from the wall cannot serve to close off the alleyway.

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>And one</b> could instead <b>prepare a board</b> one <b>cubit</b> wide <b>and distance</b> himself one <b>cubit, and prepare</b> another <b>board</b> of <b>a cubit and distance</b> himself one <b>cubit, and prepare</b> a third <b>board</b> of one <b>cubit,</b> thus ensuring that the open space is not greater than the standing segment on both sides. Apparently, since Rav Yehuda did not suggest this possibility, one may <b>conclude from this</b> that if the <b>standing</b> segment of a wall <b>is equal to the breached</b> segment, carrying in the alleyway <b>is prohibited.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects this assumption: <b>Actually, I would say to you</b> that ordinarily carrying <b>is permitted</b> in that case. <b>But here it is different, since the air,</b> the opening, <b>on this side</b> of the board <b>and the air,</b> the opening, <b>on that side</b> of the board <b>come</b> together <b>and negate</b> the effectiveness of the board.

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests: <b>And</b> one could <b>distance</b> himself <b>one cubit</b> from the wall, <b>and prepare a board</b> of <b>a cubit and a half, and distance</b> himself another <b>cubit, and prepare</b> another <b>board</b> of <b>a cubit and a half.</b> In this manner, one could diminish the width of the entrance of the alleyway to ten cubits.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so;</b> this would work equally as well. <b>But the Sages did not burden him this much,</b> requiring him to prepare two boards where one suffices.

### Part 9
The Gemara raises a new issue: <b>But let us be concerned lest one abandon</b> use of <b>the larger entrance,</b> which is ten cubits wide, <b>and</b> begin to <b>enter</b> the alleyway <b>through the smaller entrance,</b> which has a width of two cubits. This would negate the larger opening’s status as an entrance and render the alleyway unfit for one to carry within it, as it would no longer have an entrance with a side post. <b>Rav Adda bar Mattana said:</b> The <b>presumption</b> is that <b>a person does not abandon a larger entrance and enter</b> instead <b>through a smaller entrance.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way is this <b>different</b> from the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi,</b> who maintain that in the case of an alleyway that is breached on its side wall close to its entrance, if the breach is large enough for one to enter through it, carrying in the alleyway is prohibited? There, too, such a breach should not be problematic, as a person does not abandon a larger entrance to enter through a smaller one.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, the smaller entrance <b>reduces</b> his <b>walking</b> distance. If one approaches the alleyway from the side, the smaller entrance provides a shortcut, and therefore one might enter through it as well. However, <b>here,</b> in the case of the two entrances one two cubits and one ten cubits, <b>it does not reduce</b> his <b>walking</b> distance, as both openings are situated at the front of the alleyway.

### Part 12
The Gemara returns to the issue of the standing segment that is greater than the breached segment. <b>We learned</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>there,</b> in tractate <i>Kelim</i>: <b>The leather</b> covering <b>of a stool</b> [<b><i>asla</i></b>] <b>and its hole join</b> together <b>to</b> complete <b>a handbreadth</b> with regard to ritual impurity imparted by a tent over a corpse. Any person, vessel, or food that is beneath a covering that is at least a handbreadth in size together with a portion of a corpse of at least an olive-bulk becomes ritually impure with impurity imparted by a corpse. The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the leather covering of a stool and its hole combine to complete the measure of a handbreadth.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the leather</b> covering <b>of a stool</b> referred to in the <i>Tosefta</i>? <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rav Yoḥanan said: The leather covering of a bathroom.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>And how large</b> can the hole be and still combine with the leather covering to complete the handbreadth? <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: Two fingers</b> of leather <b>from here,</b> on one side, <b>and two fingers</b> of leather <b>from here,</b> on the other side, <b>and a space of two fingers</b> for the hole <b>in the middle.</b> However, <b>when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: A finger and a half</b> of leather <b>from here, and a finger and a half</b> on the leather <b>from here, and a space of</b> a single <b>finger</b> for the hole <b>in the middle.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Abaye said to Rav Dimi: Do</b> the two of <b>you,</b> yourself and Ravin, <b>disagree</b> in principle? Rav Dimi <b>said to him: No,</b> rather <b>this,</b> Ravin’s statement, <b>is referring to the large</b> finger, i.e., the thumb, and <b>this,</b> my own statement, <b>is referring to the small</b> finger, the pinkie, <b>and we do not disagree.</b> Both were describing one handbreadth, which equals the width of four thumbs or six pinkies.

### Part 16
Abaye <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>not so</b> [<b><i>la’ei</i></b>]. <b>You disagree, and you disagree with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> in a case where the <b>standing</b> segment of a wall is <b>greater than the breached</b> segment only when one combines the standing segments <b>from two directions,</b> i.e., both sides of the breached segment. <b>According to you,</b> this wall <b>is considered as standing,</b> even when one must combine the standing segments <b>from two directions. According to Ravin,</b> if the standing segment <b>on one side</b> of the breach is greater, the wall <b>is considered as standing;</b> however, if the standing segment is greater only after combining the standing segments <b>from the two directions,</b> it <b>is not considered as standing.</b>

### Part 17
Abaye continues: <b>For if it should enter your mind</b> to say that <b>you do not disagree,</b> but simply refer to the same measures by different names, <b>to</b> express his opinion, <b>Ravin should have said as follows: A finger and a third</b> of leather <b>from here, and a finger and a third</b> of leather <b>from here, and</b> a space of <b>a finger and a third</b> for the hole <b>in the middle.</b> In this case, there would still be a handbreadth in total, but each side of leather alone would not be larger than the space in the middle. The fact that Ravin presented a case where the hole in the middle is smaller than the width of the leather on either side indicates that his dispute with Rav Dimi is a fundamental one.

### Part 18
Rav Dimi responds: <b>Rather, what</b> do you wish to say, that <b>we disagree?</b> If so, <b>to</b> express the opinion attributed to <b>me, I should have said as follows: A finger and two thirds</b> of leather <b>from here, and a finger and two thirds</b> of leather <b>from here, and a space of two fingers and two thirds in the middle.</b> This would provide a more striking case where, despite the fact that the breach is much greater than the standing segments on either of its sides, the two standing segments combine together so that the standing segments are considered greater than the breached segment.

### Part 19
<b>Rather, if there is</b> room <b>to say that we disagree,</b> our dispute relates to a different point, and <b>we argue</b> in the case where <b>the breached</b> segment <b>is</b> exactly <b>equal to the standing</b> segment on each side. According to Ravin, it is considered breached; while according to Rav Dimi, it is considered standing.

### Part 20
The Gemara returns to the mishna: <b>If</b> the entrance to the alleyway <b>has</b> an opening in the <b>form of a doorway,</b> then, <b>even if it is wider than ten</b> cubits, <b>one need not diminish</b> its width. The Gemara comments: <b>We find</b> that an opening in the <b>form of a doorway is effective</b> to permit carrying in an alleyway <b>with</b> regard to <b>its width,</b> i.e., when its entrance is more than ten cubits wide, <b>and</b> that <b>a cornice is effective with</b> regard to <b>its height,</b> i.e., when it is more than twenty cubits high.
