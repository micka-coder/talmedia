is <b>a domain in and of itself.</b> This indicates that each roof constitutes a discrete domain, and one may carry throughout this entire domain. <b>Granted according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> this works out <b>well, but according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> it is <b>difficult.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara answers that the Sages of the <b>school of Rav said in the name of Rav:</b> The ruling in the mishna is not a leniency permitting one to carry throughout the entire roof; rather, it is a stringency, ruling <b>that one may not move</b> an object <b>two cubits on this roof and two cubits on that roof.</b> The <i>tanna</i> rules that even the allowance to carry within four cubits is restricted to a single roof.

### Part 3
The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>But didn’t Rabbi Elazar say: When we were in Babylonia we</b> would <b>say</b> that the Sages of <b>the school of Rav said in the name of Rav: One may move</b> an object <b>on</b> each roof <b>only within four cubits, and those</b> Sages of <b>the school of Shmuel taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> in accordance with their opinion: <b>They have only their</b> own <b>roof.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara seeks to clarify this <i>baraita</i>. <b>What is</b> the meaning of the statement: <b>They have only their</b> own <b>roof?</b> Is it <b>not that they are permitted to move</b> an object <b>throughout</b> each <b>entire</b> roof? This <i>baraita</i> poses a difficulty to Rav. The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>And is</b> this <i>baraita</i> any <b>stronger</b> a proof <b>than our mishna, which we established</b> as a stringency, <b>that one may not move</b> an object <b>two cubits on this roof and two cubits on that roof? So too,</b> this <i>baraita</i> is teaching that one may not carry <b>two cubits on this roof and two cubits on that roof.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yosef said,</b> after an illness had caused him to forget his knowledge: <b>I have not heard this <i>halakha</i></b> of Shmuel’s with regard to roofs. His student <b>Abaye said to him: You</b> yourself <b>said it to us, and it was about this</b> that <b>you said it to us:</b> With regard to <b>a large roof that is adjacent to a small one,</b> carrying on <b>the large</b> one <b>is permitted,</b> as its partitions are distinct where it extends beyond the small one, <b>and</b> carrying on <b>the small one is prohibited,</b> as it is breached along its entire length into the other roof, onto which it is prohibited to carry.

### Part 6
<b>And you said to us about it: Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: They only taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where there are residents on this</b> roof <b>and residents on that</b> roof, <b>as</b> the extended, virtual partition <b>of the small</b> roof is considered <b>a trampled partition.</b> The residents trample this virtual partition as they move from one roof to the other, and the entire length of the small roof is considered breached into the large one.

### Part 7
<b>However,</b> if <b>there are no residents on this</b> roof <b>and</b> none <b>on that</b> one, carrying on <b>both</b> roofs is <b>permitted.</b> Presumably, Shmuel’s reasoning is that in this case the walls of the houses below extend upward and form partitions between the roofs, in accordance with the principle: Extend and raise the partitions.

### Part 8
Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> I remember it now. <b>I said to you as follows: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that carrying is prohibited on the small roof, <b>only</b> with regard to a case <b>where there was an</b> actual <b>partition on</b> all sides of <b>this</b> roof <b>and an</b> actual <b>partition on</b> all sides of <b>that</b> roof, not only between the two roofs. In <b>that</b> case, carrying on <b>the large</b> roof <b>is permitted by</b> means of <b>the remnants</b> of the partition on either side of the opening, <b>and</b> carrying on the <b>small</b> roof <b>is</b> prohibited because it is <b>fully breached</b> into the larger one. <b>However, if there is no partition, neither on</b> all sides of <b>this</b> roof <b>nor on</b> all sides of <b>that</b> roof, carrying on <b>both of them is prohibited.</b>

### Part 9
Abaye raised a difficulty: <b>But didn’t you speak to us</b> of <b>residents?</b> Rav Yosef replied: <b>If I spoke to you</b> of <b>residents, this</b> is what <b>I said to you: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that carrying is prohibited on the small roof, <b>only</b> in a case <b>where there is an</b> actual <b>partition</b> that renders the area <b>fit for residence on</b> all sides of <b>this</b> roof, <b>and an</b> actual <b>partition</b> that renders the area fit <b>for residence on</b> all sides of <b>that</b> roof, as carrying on <b>the large</b> roof <b>is permitted by</b> means of <b>the remnants</b> of the partition on either side of the opening, <b>and</b> carrying on the <b>small</b> roof <b>is</b> prohibited because it is <b>fully breached</b> into the larger one.

### Part 10
<b>However,</b> if <b>there is a partition</b> that renders the area fit <b>for a residence on</b> all sides of <b>the large</b> roof, <b>but</b> there is <b>no</b> partition that renders the area fit for <b>a residence on the small</b> roof, carrying <b>even</b> on <b>the small</b> roof <b>is permitted for the residents of the large</b> roof. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Since</b> the residents of the small roof <b>did not erect a partition</b> around their roof, <b>they</b> thereby <b>removed themselves from here</b> and transferred the right to their domain to the residents of the large roof.

### Part 11
This is <b>in accordance with that which Rav Naḥman said:</b> If one <b>affixed a permanent ladder to his roof,</b> while the owners of the neighboring roofs did not do so, it <b>is permitted for him to</b> carry on <b>all the roofs.</b> The failure of the other owners to erect a ladder indicates that they relinquished the right to their roofs to the one who affixed the permanent ladder.

### Part 12
<b>Abaye said:</b> If a person <b>built an upper story atop his house,</b> by surrounding the roof with walls, <b>and erected before its</b> entrance <b>a small partition [<i>dakka</i>] four</b> cubits high that opens to other roofs, <b>it is permitted</b> for him <b>to</b> carry on <b>all the roofs.</b> His construction of the partition is indicative of his plans to utilize the other roofs, while the failure of the other owners to do so indicates that they conceded use of their roofs to him.

### Part 13
<b>Rava said: Sometimes the small partition</b> leads <b>to prohibition. What are the circumstances</b> of this case? It is a case <b>where</b> the partition <b>was erected</b> facing <b>toward the garden of his house</b> and the sides facing the other roofs were sealed. The reason is <b>that</b> through his actions <b>he said</b>
