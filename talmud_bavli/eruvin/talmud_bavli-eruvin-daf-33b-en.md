### Part 1
<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and he</b> also <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara clarifies: <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said</b> the following in the case of an arched gateway in which the lower, straight-walled section is three handbreadths high, and the entire arch is ten handbreadths high: Even if, at the height of ten handbreadths, the arch is less than four handbreadths wide, one considers it as if he <b>carves out</b> the space <b>to complete</b> it, i.e., the arch has the legal status as though it were actually enlarged to a width of four handbreadths. Similarly, in our case the basket is taken into account and enlarges the tree to a width of four handbreadths.

### Part 3
<b>And he</b> also <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said: We require</b> that the <b><i>eiruv</i></b> rest <b>on a place</b> that is <b>four</b> by four handbreadths wide, <b>and</b> here <b>there is not</b> a width of four handbreadths without taking the basket into account.

### Part 4
The Gemara now asks: <b>What is</b> the source of the ruling of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If one stuck a</b> cross <b>beam</b> into the ground <b>in the public domain and placed his <i>eiruv</i> upon it,</b> if the cross beam is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide,</b> so that it has the status of a private domain, <b>his <i>eiruv</i> is a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>; but if not, his <i>eiruv</i> is not a</b> valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>On the contrary,</b> if the cross beam is not ten handbreadths high, why shouldn’t his <i>eiruv</i> be valid? <b>He and his <i>eiruv</i> are in the same place,</b> i.e., in the public domain. <b>Rather, this is what he said:</b> If the cross beam is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>high, it is necessary that its top be four</b> handbreadths wide, so that it can be considered its own domain; but if it is <b>not ten</b> handbreadths <b>high, it is not necessary that its top be four</b> handbreadths wide because it is considered part of the public domain.

### Part 6
The Gemara poses a question: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Ravina offer his explanation, which maintains that we are dealing with a basket that completes the dimension of the tree to four handbreadths and yet it is not treated as a private domain? <b>It is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> If <b>one stuck a reed</b> into the ground <b>in the public domain, and placed a basket [<i>teraskal</i>]</b> four by four handbreadths wide <b>on top of it, and threw</b> an object from the public domain, <b>and it landed upon it, he is liable</b> for carrying from a public domain to a private domain. According to Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, if a surface of four by four handbreadths rests at a height of ten handbreadths from the ground, this is sufficient for it to be considered a private domain. Ravina’s explanation of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s position, however, does not appear to accept this assumption.

### Part 7
The Gemara refutes this and claims that this proof is not conclusive: <b>Even if you say</b> that Ravina’s explanation is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> a distinction can be made: <b>There,</b> in the case of the basket resting on a reed, the sides of the basket constitute <b>partitions</b> that <b>surround</b> the reed on all sides, and we can invoke the principle of: Lower the partition, according to which the partitions are viewed as extending down to the ground. Consequently, a kind of private domain is created within the public domain. <b>Here,</b> in the case of the basket hanging from the tree, the <b>partitions</b> of the basket <b>do not surround</b> the tree, and so they do not suffice to create a private domain.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> that the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi in the <i>Tosefta</i> can be explained in an entirely different manner: <b>A basket is different, since one can tilt it and</b> in that way <b>bring it to within ten</b> handbreadths of the ground. Without moving the entire basket, one can tilt it and thereby remove the <i>eiruv</i> in order to eat it, without carrying it from one domain to another.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Pappa sat and recited this <i>halakha</i>. Rav bar Shabba raised an objection to Rav Pappa</b> from the following mishna: <b>What does one do</b> if a Festival occurs on Friday, and he wishes to establish an <i>eiruv</i> that will be valid for both the Festival and Shabbat? <b>He brings</b> the <i>eiruv</i> to the location that he wishes to establish as his residence <b>on</b> the eve of the <b>first</b> day, i.e., the eve of the Festival, <b>and stays</b> there <b>with it until nightfall,</b> the time when the <i>eiruv</i> establishes that location as his residence, <b>and</b> then <b>he takes it</b> with him <b>and goes away,</b> so that it does not become lost before Shabbat begins, in which case he would not have an <i>eiruv</i> for Shabbat. <b>On</b> the eve of the <b>second</b> day, i.e., on Friday afternoon, he takes it back to the same place as the day before, and <b>stays</b> there <b>with it until nightfall,</b> thereby establishing his Shabbat residence; and then he may then <b>eat</b> the <i>eiruv</i> <b>and go away,</b> if he so desires.
