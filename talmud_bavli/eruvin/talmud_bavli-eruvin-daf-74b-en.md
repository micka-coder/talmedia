### Part 1
Following Shmuel’s death, <b>Rav Anan came and threw</b> the side post down, thus indicating to Ivut bar Ihi that it is prohibited to carry in the alleyway, as a side post is effective only for an alleyway that has at least two courtyards containing at least two houses each. Ivut bar Ihi <b>said</b> with resentment: <b>The alleyway in which I have been living and walking</b> based on a ruling <b>in the name of Master Shmuel, shall Rav Anan bar Rav come</b> now and <b>throw</b> its side post away <b>from</b> me? The Gemara comments: <b>Learn from</b> the fact that this side post remained intact throughout Shmuel’s lifetime that he <b>did not accept</b> Rabbi Elazar’s objection.

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this proof. <b>Actually, you can say</b> that Shmuel <b>accepted</b> Rabbi Elazar’s objection and retracted his opinion, <b>and here there was</b> a synagogue <b>attendant [<i>ḥazzana</i>] who would eat bread in his</b> own <b>house</b> that was located elsewhere, <b>but</b> would <b>come and sleep in the synagogue,</b> which was open to the alleyway.

### Part 3
<b>And Ivut bar Ihi holds</b> that <b>the place</b> where a person eats his <b>bread determines</b> his place of residence. Therefore, he did not consider the synagogue a residence, as the attendant would eat elsewhere, and Ivut bar Ihi thought that Shmuel had permitted him to set up a side post for his alleyway even though he lived there by himself. In fact, however, this was not the case, as <b>Shmuel followed his</b> regular line of <b>reasoning, as he said: The place</b> where a person <b>sleeps determines</b> his place of residence. Since the attendant would sleep in the synagogue, it was considered a residence. Consequently, the alleyway contained two houses and courtyards, and could be made permitted for carrying by means of a side post or a cross beam.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>an alleyway, one side of which</b> was occupied by <b>a gentile and one side of which</b> was occupied by <b>a Jew,</b> and the house of the Jew was connected to the houses of other Jews via windows but not via doors, and those other houses open directly into the public domain, the residents of the houses on the side of the alleyway where the Jews live <b>may not establish an <i>eiruv</i> through the windows</b> in order <b>to render</b> it <b>permitted</b> for the residents of the other houses to carry <b>through the doors</b> of the house leading <b>to the alleyway.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef:</b> Did <b>Rav say</b> this <b>even with regard to a courtyard,</b> one side of which was occupied by a gentile and the other side of which was occupied by a Jew whose house was connected through windows to the houses of other Jews? <b>He said to him: Yes, as</b> even <b>if he did not say</b> so, <b>what</b> would be the difference? It is the exact same principle.

### Part 6
Abaye responded: <b>I would have said</b> that <b>the rationale for</b> the opinion of <b>Rav is because he holds</b> that <b>an alleyway cannot be rendered permitted</b> for carrying within it <b>with a side post and</b> a cross <b>beam unless there are houses and courtyards opening into it.</b>

### Part 7
Rav Yosef said: If that were the reason, <b>why</b> would <b>I need two</b> rulings regarding the same issue? Rav already stated that an alleyway can be rendered permitted for carrying within it only if it has houses and courtyards opening into it. Abaye explained that both rulings are <b>necessary. As, if</b> Rav had taught this <i>halakha</i> only <b>from that</b> general ruling,
