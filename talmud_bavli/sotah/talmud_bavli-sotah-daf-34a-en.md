### Part 1
<b>And once the feet of the priests were immersed in the water</b> of the Jordan River, <b>the water flowed backward, as it is stated: “And when those carrying the Ark came to the Jordan</b> and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the brink of the water, for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest; <b>and the waters that came down from above stood, and rose up in one heap”</b> (Joshua 3:15–16). <b>And what was the height of the water? Twelve <i>mil</i> by twelve <i>mil</i>, parallel to</b> the size of <b>the camp of the Jewish people</b> who were passing through the Jordan. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, said to him: According to your statement,</b> does <b>a person</b> move <b>faster or</b> does <b>water</b> move <b>faster? You must say</b> that <b>water</b> moves <b>faster</b> than a person. <b>If</b> that is <b>so,</b> then before the camp of Israel crossed the river <b>the water would come and drown them,</b> as, after the water rose up to a height of twelve <i>mil</i> it then began flowing normally again.

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> this <b>teaches that the water gathered and rose in heaps upon heaps</b> to a height of <b>more than three hundred <i>mil</i>, until all the kings of the East and West saw it, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, that were by the sea, heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel, until they were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them anymore, because of the children of Israel”</b> (Joshua 5:1).

### Part 4
<b>And even Rahab the prostitute said to Joshua’s messengers: “For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea before you”</b> (Joshua 2:10). <b>And it is written: “And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did there remain any more</b> spirit in any man, because of you” (Joshua 2:11). Evidently, the Canaanites were still terrified due to the splitting of the Red Sea, although that had taken place years earlier and in a distant location. It is understood from here how terrified they became when a similar miracle occurred close to where they lived.

### Part 5
While the Jewish people <b>were still in the Jordan, Joshua said to them: Know for what</b> purpose <b>you are crossing the Jordan.</b> It is <b>in order to drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, as it is stated: “And you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you”</b> (Numbers 33:52). <b>If you</b> will <b>do so,</b> then all is <b>well, but if not, water will come and drown <i>otikhem</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the word <b><i>otikhem</i>?</b> The Gemara explains: It is a combination of the words <b>me [<i>oti</i>] and you [<i>etkhem</i>].</b>

### Part 6
While <b>they were still in the Jordan, Joshua said to them: “Pick up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel”</b> (Joshua 4:5). <b>And it is written: “That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask in time to come, saying: What do you mean by these stones?”</b> (Joshua 4:6). This will be <b>a sign for the children that</b> their <b>ancestors crossed the Jordan.</b>

### Part 7
While <b>they were still in the Jordan, Joshua said to them: “Take out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood, twelve stones made ready, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging place, where you shall lodge this night”</b> (Joshua 4:3). One <b>might</b> have thought that they were required to place these stones <b>at each and every lodging place</b> where they stayed. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Where you shall lodge this night,”</b> meaning only on that night.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Abba Ḥalafta, and Rabbi Eliezer ben Matya, and Ḥananya ben Ḥakhinai stood on those same stones</b> that the Jewish people took from the Jordan, <b>and</b> they <b>measured them</b> and found that <b>each and every one weighed about forty <i>se’a</i>. And</b> it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that a load that one can lift onto his shoulders is one-third of</b> the weight of the <b>load</b> that he can carry when others load it onto him.

### Part 9
<b>From here you can calculate</b> the size of <b>the cluster</b> of grapes that the spies carried together from Eretz Yisrael, <b>as it is stated: “And they carried it upon a pole between two”</b> (Numbers 13:23). <b>From the fact that it is stated</b> that they carried the cluster of grapes <b>“on a pole” do I not know that</b> it was carried <b>by two</b> people? That is the only way it can be carried on a pole. <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Between two”?</b> It means that the spies carried it <b>on two poles,</b> and four people carried the cluster of grapes together. From here it can be deduced that the weight of the cluster was 480 <i>se’a</i>.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> They were configured like upper rods of <b>scales [<i>turtanei</i>]</b> that are balanced on the lower rods of <b>scales,</b> i.e., there were not two but four poles. <b>How so? Eight</b> of the spies <b>carried</b> the <b>cluster</b> of grapes, <b>one</b> of them <b>carried a pomegranate, and one carried a fig. Joshua and Caleb did not carry anything.</b> Why did Joshua and Caleb not carry anything? <b>If you wish, say</b> that it is <b>because they were</b> more <b>prominent</b> than the others and it was beneath their dignity to carry such a load. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that they</b> did <b>not</b> take part <b>in the</b> wicked <b>counsel</b> of the spies, as the cluster of grapes was brought by the spies to scare the people.

### Part 11
§ <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa disagree with regard to</b> the dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i> as to the height of the water when the Jewish people crossed the Jordan. <b>One says: According to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> that the water stood at the height of twelve <i>mil</i>,
