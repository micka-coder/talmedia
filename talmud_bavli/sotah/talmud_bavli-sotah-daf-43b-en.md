### Part 1
<b>because of sins that he has.</b> According to this interpretation, one who stole another’s real estate should return home from war because of his guilt, which would seem to contradict the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that this ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov still needs to exclude one in possession of a stolen house, as in a case <b>where one repented and gave money</b> to the owners of the house that he stole. Although in such a case he is not considered a criminal, the house was originally stolen, and therefore he must remain among the military ranks. The Gemara challenges this: <b>If so,</b> i.e., he repaid the owners, <b>he is</b> now a legal <b>purchaser</b> of the house <b>and he should return</b> from the military ranks. The Gemara answers: <b>Since initially</b> it <b>entered his possession with the status of stolen</b> property, he does <b>not</b> return.

### Part 3
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of those who return from the ranks. <b>“And what man is there that has planted a vineyard,</b> and has not used the fruit thereof<b>”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:6). <b>The Sages taught:</b> From the phrase <b>“that has planted,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that it applies to one who actually <b>planted</b> a vineyard. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the military exemption likewise includes one who <b>purchased</b> it, one who <b>inherited</b> it, <b>and</b> one <b>to whom</b> it <b>was given as a gift? The verse states: “And what man is there that has planted.”</b> By not merely stating: One that has planted, but using the expanded “what man is there that has planted,” the verse includes any of these circumstances.

### Part 4
From the specific term <b>“vineyard,” I have</b> derived <b>only a vineyard; from where</b> do I derive that it comes <b>to include five fruit trees even from other species? The verse states: “That has planted,”</b> to include different types of trees. <b>Might I</b> include even <b>one who plants</b> only <b>four fruit trees and</b> one who plants <b>five</b> or more <b>non-fruit bearing trees? The verse states: “Vineyard.”</b> The term excludes a quantity of trees that is too few to qualify as a vineyard, as well as trees that do not yield fruit at all.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> The word <b>“vineyard”</b> is to be understood <b>as it indicates,</b> and it is referring only to a grape vineyard. And since the verse does not state merely: <b>“And has not used</b> the fruit,” but rather: <b>“And has not used</b> the fruit <b>thereof,”</b> it <b>excludes one who layers</b> the vine or branch <b>and one who grafts</b> different trees onto one another. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: He is released if he is <b>one who plants, or</b> if he is <b>one who layers, or</b> if he is <b>one who grafts</b> trees? <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the case where one does not return from the ranks, the man has performed <b>forbidden grafting; there,</b> in the case where one does return from the ranks, he has performed <b>permitted grafting.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>this permitted grafting, what are the circumstances? If we say</b> that it is <b>a young</b> tree grafted together <b>with</b> another <b>young</b> tree, then <b>let him derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that one must return</b> from the ranks <b>due to the first young</b> tree. One should be exempt because of his first tree, which is young, and the grafted tree is irrelevant. <b>Rather,</b> it is a case in which <b>a young</b> tree is grafted with <b>an old</b> tree. The Gemara objects: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Abbahu say:</b> With regard to <b>a young</b> tree <b>that was entangled,</b> i.e., grafted, <b>with an old</b> tree, <b>the young</b> one <b>is negated by the old</b> one, <b>and the law of <i>orla</i></b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>to it.</b> Therefore, the grafted tree should likewise lose its status as a young tree, and one in this situation should not return from the ranks.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: Actually,</b> one returns home if he grafts <b>a young</b> tree <b>with</b> another <b>young</b> tree, <b>and</b> it is a case <b>in which he planted this first</b> one <b>for a fence or for beams,</b> so that he is exempt from battle only because of the second tree, which he grafts for fruit. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 1:1): In a case of <b>one who plants</b> a tree <b>for a fence or</b> to yield wood <b>for beams,</b> the tree is <b>exempt from the</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>orla</i>.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> about the case of <b>a young</b> tree paired <b>with an old</b> tree such <b>that</b> the young tree <b>is negated, and what is different</b> about the case of a <b>young</b> tree being planted for fruit paired <b>with a young</b> tree planted for wood such <b>that</b> the fruit tree <b>is not negated?</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of an older tree, <b>if one changes his mind about it</b> and wants it to be a young tree obligated in <i>orla</i>, <b>it cannot return</b> to its previous state, as he has grafted it. Therefore, it is exempt from the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>orla</i>. <b>Here,</b> when a tree is planted for wood, <b>if he changes his mind</b> and decides to grow it for fruit, <b>it can return</b> to its default state of being planted for fruit, <b>because initially it stands</b> to be used <b>for fruit.</b> Therefore, it is not exempt from the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>orla</i>. This ruling is <b>just as it is concerning</b> trees that <b>grew by themselves,</b> which are subject to <i>orla</i> although they were not consciously planted for their fruit. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 1:2): Fruit trees that <b>grew by themselves are obligated in <i>orla</i></b> although the landowner did not plant them himself.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: Why is there a need to establish the mishna as discussing a case where one planted the first tree for a fence or for beams? <b>But let</b> the mishna <b>be established</b> as referring <b>to a vineyard belonging to two partners,</b> where the two trees involved in the grafting were co-owned by partners, and both trees were young. <b>As</b> in this case <b>this</b> one man <b>returns due to his</b> tree <b>and that</b> other man <b>returns due to his</b> tree. <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> Since the Gemara avoids the scenario of the vineyard belonging to partners in favor of discussing a case where one planted the first tree for a fence or for beams, <b>that is to say</b> if there is <b>a vineyard belonging to two partners,</b> evidently <b>they do not return for</b> the vineyard <b>from the ranks of</b> soldiers waging <b>war.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> the case of partners <b>different from</b> the following case: If there are <b>five brothers and one of them dies in the war,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that they all return.</b> Just as each brother returns because of his shared responsibility to perform levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i> for the widow, each partner should return for his share in the young tree that was grafted. The Gemara answers: <b>There, each and every one is considered</b> one who must return for <b>his wife,</b> as any of them could readily marry her. However, <b>here, each and every one is not considered</b> one who must return for <b>his vineyard</b> because it does not belong exclusively to either of them.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> In accordance with the <i>baraita</i> mentioned above, one does not normally return for a grafted or layered tree. However, the mishna states that one does return for a grafted or layered tree <b>in</b> a case where <b>one layers a tree</b> and grafts it <b>with a vegetable</b> plant. <b>And</b> that ruling <b>is</b> in accordance with <b>this <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Gamda, as cited in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Kilayim</i> 1:12): With regard to <b>one who layers a tree</b> and grafts it <b>with a vegetable</b> plant, the <i>tanna’im</i> engaged in a dispute concerning whether this kind of breeding is permitted. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> speaking <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Gamda of the village of Akko, permits</b> one to do so, <b>and the Rabbis prohibit</b> it. Therefore, one would return from the ranks for a tree grafted to a vegetable plant, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda ben Gamda, although he would not return for the vegetable itself.

### Part 13
The Gemara offers another alternative resolution to the contradiction over whether one returns for a grafted tree. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> statement, which says that one does not return for a grafted tree? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b> He explains: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov say there</b> in the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier: The word <b>vineyard</b> is to be understood <b>as it indicates,</b> i.e., that the exemption is only for a grape vineyard? <b>Here too,</b> the word <b>planted</b> is to be understood <b>as it indicates;</b> with regard to one who <b>plants, yes,</b> he does return, but <b>one who grafts or layers</b> a tree does <b>not</b> return.

### Part 14
§ After citing Rabbi Yoḥanan’s interpretation of the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, the Gemara cites a string of other rulings that Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov:</b> The Sages decreed that if there is <b>a young</b> grapevine <b>less than</b> one <b>handbreadth</b> tall, it <b>is obligated in <i>orla</i> all its years,</b> even after the three years mandated by the Torah, <b>because it appears like</b> a vine of <b>one year.</b> The Sages were concerned that if they permitted one to eat from such a vine, people would also eat true <i>orla</i>. <b>And this</b> prohibition <b>applies</b> to a very small section of <b>two</b> grapevines <b>opposite two</b> grapevines <b>and one</b> more vine <b>emerging</b> and growing between them, in the formation of <b>a tail. But</b> if the <b>entire vineyard</b> grows so short, <b>it</b> generates <b>publicity,</b> and people know that the vines are old enough to no longer be subject to <i>orla</i>.

### Part 15
<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said <b>in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov: A corpse occupies four cubits</b> with regard <b>to</b> the exemption from <b>the recitation of <i>Shema</i>,</b> so that it is prohibited to recite <i>Shema</i> within this space, <b>as it is written</b> in the verse: <b>“Whoever mocks the poor blasphemes his Maker”</b> (Proverbs 17:5). Because the deceased cannot perform mitzvot, one who performs a mitzva in front of them is considered to be mocking them.

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov:</b> With regard to a man’s <b>stepdaughter who grows up among the brothers</b> from a different marriage, she is eligible to be married to them in principle, because they are not actually her siblings. Nevertheless, she <b>is prohibited to be married to the brothers, because she appears as</b> though she is <b>their sister.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> that <b>is not so;</b> such a marriage is not prohibited because <b>the matter</b> generates <b>publicity,</b> and the public knows that they are not truly related.

### Part 17
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov:</b> With regard to <b>gleanings</b> (Leviticus 19:9, 23:22), <b>forgotten</b> sheaves (Deuteronomy 24:19), <b>or produce in the corner of the field which is given to the poor [<i>pe’a</i>]</b> (Leviticus 19:9, 23:22), three obligatory agricultural gifts that must be given to the poor, if one <b>gathered them into the threshing floor,</b> the produce <b>was</b> thereby <b>rendered</b> obligated <b>for tithes.</b> Although one does not take tithes from produce for the poor, onlookers are likely to presume that this is his own produce. <b>Ulla said: We stated</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> when the granary is <b>in the field, but in the city, the matter</b> generates <b>publicity.</b> People see that the produce was gathered in small quantities from different places, and they know that this produce is for the poor. In that case, one need not separate tithes.

### Part 18
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov:</b> If there is <b>a young</b> grapevine <b>less than</b> one <b>handbreadth</b> tall, it <b>does not render the seeds</b> that are planted next to it <b>forbidden.</b> Normally, diverse kinds of produce may not be planted in close proximity, but this vine is too small to qualify as a prohibited vineyard. The Gemara limits the scope of this statement: <b>And this statement</b> applies to a very small section of <b>two</b> grapevines <b>opposite two</b> grapevines <b>and one</b> more vine <b>emerging</b> and growing between them, in formation of <b>a tail. But</b> if the <b>entire vineyard</b> grows so short, a vine of this size does <b>render</b> the other seeds planted at its side <b>forbidden.</b>

### Part 19
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov:</b>
