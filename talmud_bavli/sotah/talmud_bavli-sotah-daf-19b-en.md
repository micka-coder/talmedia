### Part 1
<b>The Sages taught: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> after the sacrifice of the meal-offering: <b>“And he shall make her drink</b> the water” (Numbers 5:27)? <b>But isn’t it already stated: “And he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink</b> the water of bitterness that causes the curse” (Numbers 5:24)? The <i>baraita</i> answers: The repetition teaches <b>that if the scroll was</b> already <b>erased and</b> then the woman <b>says: I will not drink, she is forced [<i>me’arerin</i>] to drink against her will.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “And the priest shall take a handful of the meal-offering, as the memorial part of it, and burn it upon the altar, <b>and afterward he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink</b> the water” (Numbers 5:26)? <b>But isn’t it already stated</b> previously: <b>“And he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink”</b> (Numbers 5:24)? <b>Rather,</b> this verse indicates that the <i>sota</i> is given the bitter water to drink only <b>after all the actions that are stated above</b> are performed, i.e., erasing the scroll, sacrificing the meal-offering, and administering the oath. Therefore, this verse <b>teaches</b> that <b>three matters preclude her</b> from drinking: She does not drink <b>until the handful is sacrificed, and until the scroll is erased, and until she accepts the oath upon herself.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara elaborates: She does not drink <b>until the handful is sacrificed. Rabbi Shimon</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning</b> stated earlier, <b>as he says</b> that the priest <b>sacrifices her meal-offering and afterward forces her to drink.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara questions the second condition: She does not drink <b>until the scroll is erased.</b> Why does the <i>baraita</i> need to state this? <b>But what</b> could <b>he give her to drink</b> if the scroll was not yet erased into the water? <b>Rav Ashi says: No,</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is necessary for</b> an instance <b>where</b> the scroll was erased, but <b>the impression</b> of the ink <b>is</b> still <b>discernible</b> on the parchment. The woman does not drink until the scroll is totally erased.

### Part 5
The Gemara discusses the third condition: She does not drink <b>until she accepts the oath upon herself.</b> One might infer from this statement that <b>it is</b> only <b>that</b> she <b>does not drink</b> before she accepts the oath; <b>however,</b> the scroll <b>is written for her</b> before she accepts the oath. <b>But didn’t Rava say:</b> With regard to <b>a scroll of a <i>sota</i> that was written before she accepted the oath upon herself,</b> whoever wrote it <b>did nothing,</b> and the scroll is rendered invalid. The Gemara responds: <b>This was cited for no reason,</b> as in fact the scroll is not even written before she accepts the oath upon herself, and nothing should be inferred.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> the Rabbis and Rabbi Shimon <b>disagree</b> in the mishna? The Gemara answers: <b>Three verses are written</b> which pertain to drinking the bitter water: <b>The first</b> occurrence of the term is in the verse: <b>“And he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink”</b> (Numbers 5:24); the second: <b>“And afterward he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink</b> the water” (Numbers 5:26); and <b>the last</b> occurrence of the term is in the verse: <b>“And he shall make her drink”</b> (Numbers 5:27).

### Part 7
<b>The Rabbis hold</b> that <b>the first</b> occurrence of the term: <b>“And he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink,”</b> is written <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>itself,</b> i.e., <b>that</b> the priest first <b>forces her to drink and afterward sacrifices her meal-offering.</b> The second instance: <b>“And afterward he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink,” is necessary</b> to teach <b>that</b> as long as <b>the impression</b> of the writing <b>is</b> still <b>discernible,</b> the <i>sota</i> is not given the bitter water to drink. The third verse, <b>the last</b> occurrence of the term: <b>“And he shall make her drink,”</b> teaches <b>that if the scroll was erased and</b> then the woman <b>says: I will not drink, she is forced to drink against her will.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that the second verse: <b>“And afterward he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink</b> the water” (Numbers 5:26), is written <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>itself,</b> i.e., <b>that</b> the priest first <b>sacrifices her meal-offering and afterward forces her to drink. The first</b> occurrence of the term: <b>“And he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink,”</b> teaches <b>that if he forced her to drink and</b> only <b>afterward sacrificed her meal-offering,</b> the offering <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>valid. The last</b> occurrence of the term: <b>“And he shall make her drink,”</b> teaches <b>that if</b> the <b>scroll was erased and</b> then <b>she said: I will not drink, she is forced to drink against her will.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara explains the Rabbis’ opinion: <b>And the Rabbis</b> would respond to Rabbi Shimon that the <b>verse does not begin</b> the discussion <b>with</b> a <i>halakha</i> that is applicable only <b>after the fact,</b> and therefore the initial mention of the drinking is referring to the proper time for the ritual.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Akiva</b> in fact <b>hold</b> that the woman is <b>forced to drink against her will? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:3) that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A hook [<i>kelabus</i>]</b> made <b>of iron is</b> forcibly <b>placed into her mouth,</b> so <b>that if the scroll was erased and she said: I will not drink, she is forced to drink against her will. Rabbi Akiva said:</b> It is not necessary to force her to drink. <b>Don’t we need</b> to force her to drink the water <b>only</b> in order <b>to evaluate her</b> fidelity? <b>And isn’t she established as</b> having been <b>evaluated</b> when she refuses to drink, as she is essentially admitting her guilt? <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Akiva’s statement should be understood as follows: <b>Until the handful is sacrificed she can retract</b> her decision to drink the bitter water; however, <b>once the handful is sacrificed she cannot retract</b> her decision to drink.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to your reasoning</b> in explanation of Rabbi Akiva’s statement, <b>this</b> explanation <b>itself should pose a difficulty for you.</b> Why <b>can’t she retract</b> her decision <b>once the handful is sacrificed? And isn’t she established as</b> having been <b>evaluated</b> when she refuses to drink?

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; this</b> case, where she is forced to drink, is referring to a situation <b>where she retracts</b> her decision to drink <b>due to fear,</b> as her refusal is not viewed as an admission of guilt, and it is possible that if she drinks she will be found undefiled. <b>And that</b> case, where she does not drink, is referring to a situation <b>where she retracts</b> her decision <b>in a state of</b> good <b>health.</b> Since she does not appear to be afraid, her refusal is viewed as an admission of guilt.

### Part 13
<b>And this is what</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>is saying:</b> In <b>any</b> case where she retracts her decision to drink <b>in a state of</b> good <b>health, she does not drink at all.</b> With regard to a <i>sota</i> who retracts her decision <b>due to fear,</b> if she retracts her decision <b>before the handful is sacrificed, when the scroll has not yet been erased; or</b> even if the <b>scroll was</b> already <b>erased,</b> since <b>the priests acted incorrectly when they erased</b> it beforehand; <b>she can retract</b> her decision. <b>Once the handful is sacrificed, in which</b> case the <b>priests acted correctly when they erased</b> the scroll, <b>she cannot retract</b> her decision, and she is forced to drink against her will.
