### Part 1
<b>who plunder,</b> i.e., destroy, <b>their fathers’ future judgment.</b> When God sits in judgment of their parents, these children <b>say before Him: Master of the Universe, because You were destined to exact punishment from</b> our fathers in the World-to-Come for their wickedness, <b>why did You blunt their teeth with</b> the death of their children in their lifetimes? In this way, the death of their children atones for the fathers.

### Part 2
§ <b>Rabbi Ile’a bar Yeverekhya says: If it were not for the prayer of David</b> for Israel to have sustenance, <b>all Israel would be sellers of fat [<i>revav</i>],</b> i.e., involved in debased occupations, <b>as it is stated: “Place for them mastery, O Lord”</b> (Psalms 9:21), that is, may God grant them dignity. <b>And Rabbi Ile’a bar Yeverekhya</b> also <b>says: If it were not for the prayer of Habakkuk, two Torah scholars would have to cover themselves with a single cloak</b> due to poverty <b>and engage in Torah study</b> dressed that way, <b>as it is stated: “Lord, I heard Your report and was afraid; O Lord, revive Your work in the midst of the years”</b> (Habakkuk 3:2). <b>Do not read: “In the midst [<i>bekerev</i>] of the years [<i>shanim</i>],” but in the closeness [<i>bikrov</i>] of two [<i>shenayim</i>].</b> In other words, Habakkuk prayed that God would nullify His decree of two Torah scholars having to share a single cloak.

### Part 3
<b>And Rabbi Ile’a bar Yeverekhya says:</b> In the case of <b>two Torah scholars who are walking along the way and there are no words of Torah between them,</b> but they are conversing about other matters, <b>they are deserving of being burned in fire. As it is stated</b> with regard to Elijah and his disciple Elisha: <b>“And it was as they walked along, talking, that behold, there appeared a chariot of fire</b> and horses of fire, which parted them both asunder” (II Kings 2:11). <b>The reason</b> they were not burned by the chariot of fire is <b>that there was speech</b> exchanged between them, which presumably was words of Torah, <b>but if there had been no speech, they</b> would have been <b>deserving of being burned</b> by the chariot.

### Part 4
<b>And Rabbi Ile’a bar Yeverekhya says:</b> If there are <b>two Torah scholars who reside in the same city and they are not pleasant to each other with regard to <i>halakha</i>,</b> but are constantly fighting, <b>one</b> of them will <b>die and</b> the other <b>one</b> will be <b>exiled. As</b> it <b>is stated: “That the manslayer might flee there, who slays his neighbor without knowledge”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:42), <b>and “knowledge”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>Torah, as it is stated: “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge”</b> (Hosea 4:6).

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says:</b> With regard to <b>any Torah scholar who engages in Torah</b> study <b>while experiencing the pressure</b> of poverty, <b>his prayer is listened to, as it is stated: “For, O people that dwells in Zion at Jerusalem, you shall weep no more; He will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry. When He shall hear, He will answer you”</b> (Isaiah 30:19), <b>and after it is written: “And the Lord shall give you sparse bread and scant water”</b> (Isaiah 30:20). This verse indicates that those who sit and study Torah, that is, the people who dwell in Zion, and eat bread sparingly, will have their prayers answered by God.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> A Torah scholar who engages in Torah study despite economic pressures <b>is satiated with the glory of the Divine Presence, as it is stated</b> in the same verse, above: <b>“And your eyes shall behold your Teacher.” Rabbi Aḥa, son of Ḥanina, said: Even the</b> concealing <b>partition</b> [<b><i>pargod</i></b>] before the Divine Presence <b>is not locked before him, as it is stated: “And your Teacher shall not hide Himself anymore”</b> (Isaiah 30:20).

### Part 7
§ The mishna states that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua: From the day that the Temple was destroyed, there is no</b> day that does not include some form of curse. <b>Rava says: Each and every day is more cursed than the previous one, as it is stated</b> in the chapter detailing the curses in the book of Deuteronomy: <b>“In the morning you will say, would that it were evening, and in the evening you will say, would that it were morning”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:67). It is unclear <b>which morning</b> the verse means. <b>If we say</b> that in the evening he will wish it would be <b>the following morning, does he know what will be</b> the outcome of the next morning, which would cause him to yearn for its arrival? <b>Rather,</b> it must mean the morning <b>that has passed;</b> that is, in the evening they will pine for the previous morning, because their situation is continuously worsening.

### Part 8
The Gemara poses a question: <b>But</b> if everything is deteriorating, <b>why does the world</b> continue to <b>exist?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>By the sanctification that</b> is said in the <b>order</b> of prayers, after the passage that begins: And a redeemer shall come to Israel, which includes the recitation and translation of the sanctification said by the angels, <b>and</b> by the response: <b>Let His great name</b> be blessed, etc., which is recited after the study <b>of <i>aggada</i>. As it is stated: “A land of thick darkness, as darkness itself; a land of the shadow of death, without any order”</b> (Job 10:22). <b>Therefore,</b> it can be inferred from this verse that if <b>there are orders</b> of prayer and study, the land <b>shall appear from</b> amidst <b>the darkness.</b>

### Part 9
§ The mishna taught that since the destruction of the Temple, <b>dew has not descended for a blessing, and the taste has been removed from fruit. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> The lost <b>purity has removed the taste and the aroma;</b> the <b>tithes</b> that were not separated <b>have removed the fat of grain.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna found a fragrant date. He took it and wrapped it in his shawl. Rabba, his son, came</b> and <b>said to him: I smell the aroma of a fragrant</b> date. Rav Huna <b>said to him: My son, there is</b> clearly <b>purity in you,</b> as you were able to notice the fragrance. <b>He gave it to him. Meanwhile, Abba,</b> Rabba’s <b>son, arrived.</b> Rabba <b>took</b> the date and <b>gave it to</b> him. Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabba: <b>My son, you have made my heart rejoice</b> with your purity, <b>and you have blunted my teeth,</b> by showing your preference for your own son. The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say: The love of a father is for the sons; the love of the sons is for their own sons,</b> more than for their father.

### Part 11
The Gemara relates another incident: <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov took care of Rav Ya’akov, the son of his daughter,</b> who was an orphan. <b>When</b> the grandchild <b>grew up,</b> his grandfather once <b>said to him: Give me water to drink. He said to him: I am not your son,</b> and I am not obligated in your honor as a son must honor his father. The Gemara again comments: <b>And this</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say: Raise, raise</b> your grandchild, but in the end he will retort: <b>I am the son of your daughter,</b> and I do not have to take care of you.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>In the war [<i>pulemus</i>] of Vespasian</b> the Sages <b>decreed upon the crowns of bridegrooms,</b> i.e., that bridegrooms may no longer wear crowns, <b>and upon the drums,</b> meaning they also banned the playing of drums.

### Part 13
<b>In the war of Titus they</b> also <b>decreed upon the crowns of brides, and</b> they decreed <b>that a person should not teach his son Greek.</b>

### Part 14
<b>In the last war,</b> meaning the bar Kokheva revolt, <b>they decreed that a bride may not go out in a palanquin inside the city, but our Sages permitted a bride to go out in a palanquin inside the city,</b> as this helps the bride maintain her modesty.

### Part 15
The mishna lists more things that ceased: <b>From</b> the time <b>when Rabbi Meir died, those who relate parables ceased; from</b> the time <b>when ben Azzai died, the diligent ceased; from</b> the time <b>when ben Zoma died, the exegetists ceased; from</b> the time <b>when Rabbi Akiva died, the honor of the Torah ceased; from</b> the time <b>when Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa died, the men of</b> wondrous <b>action ceased; from</b> the time <b>when Rabbi Yosei the Small died, the pious were no more. And why was he called the Small? Because he was the smallest of the pious,</b> meaning he was one of the least important of the pious men.

### Part 16
<b>From</b> the time <b>when Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai died, the glory of wisdom ceased; from</b> the time <b>when Rabban Gamliel the Elder died, the honor of the Torah ceased, and purity and asceticism died. From</b> the time <b>when Rabbi Yishmael ben Pavi died, the glory of the priesthood ceased; from</b> the time <b>when Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>died, humility and fear of sin ceased.</b>

### Part 17
gemara <b>The Sages taught: Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir says: From</b> the time <b>when the</b> Second <b>Temple was destroyed, the <i>ḥaverim</i> and free men</b> of noble lineage <b>were ashamed, and their heads were covered</b> in shame, <b>and men of action dwindled, and violent and smooth-talking men gained the upper hand, and none seek, and none ask, and none inquire</b> of the fear of Heaven.

### Part 18
<b>Upon whom</b> is there <b>for us to rely?</b> Only <b>upon our Father in Heaven.</b>

### Part 19
<b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: From the day the</b> Second <b>Temple was destroyed,</b> the generations have deteriorated: <b>Scholars have begun to become like scribes</b> that teach children, <b>and scribes have become like beadles, and beadles have become like ignoramuses, and ignoramuses</b>
