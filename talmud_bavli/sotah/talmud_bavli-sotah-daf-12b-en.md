### Part 1
She placed him in <b>a marsh, as it is written: “The reeds and willows [<i>suf</i> ] shall wither”</b> (Isaiah 19:6).

### Part 2
The verse states: <b>“And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe [<i>lirḥotz</i>] in the river”</b> (Exodus 2:5). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> This <b>teaches that she came down</b> to the river <b>to cleanse</b> herself <b>from</b> the impurity of <b>her father’s idols,</b> as she was immersing herself as part of the conversion process. <b>And similarly it states: “When the Lord shall have washed [<i>raḥatz</i>] away the filth of the daughters of Zion,</b> and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of destruction” (Isaiah 4:4). This washing clearly refers to the purging of spiritual sins, rather than bathing for the sake of cleanliness.

### Part 3
The verse continues: <b>“And her maidens walked</b> along <b>[<i>holekhot</i>]</b> by the riverside” (Exodus 2:5). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This walking</b> is <b>nothing other</b> than the <b>terminology of</b> going toward <b>death, and similarly it states: “Behold, I am going [<i>holekh</i>] to die”</b> (Genesis 25:32).

### Part 4
The verse continues: <b>“And she saw the ark among the willows”</b> (Exodus 2:5). <b>Once</b> her maidens <b>saw that</b> the daughter of Pharaoh <b>was intending to save Moses, they said to her: Our mistress, the custom of the world</b> is that when <b>a king of flesh and blood decrees a decree,</b> even <b>if all the world does not fulfill it,</b> at least <b>his children and members of his household fulfill it, and</b> yet <b>you are violating the decree of your father.</b> After the maidens tried to convince her not to save Moses, the angel <b>Gabriel came and beat them to the ground</b> and they died.

### Part 5
The verse concludes: <b>“And she sent <i>amatah</i> to take it”</b> (Exodus 2:5). <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya</b> disagree as to the definition of the word “<i>amatah</i>.” <b>One says</b> that it means <b>her arm, and one says</b> that it means <b>her maidservant.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>The one who says</b> that it means <b>her arm</b> explained it in this manner, <b>as it is written “<i>amatah</i>,”</b> which denotes her forearm. <b>And the one who says</b> that it means <b>her maidservant</b> explained it in this manner <b>because it does not</b> explicitly <b>write</b> the more common term: <b>Her hand [<i>yadah</i>].</b> Therefore, he understands that this is the alternative term for a maidservant, <i>ama</i>.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that it means <b>her maidservant, didn’t you say</b> earlier: <b>Gabriel came and beat them to the ground</b> and the maidservants died, so how could Pharaoh’s daughter send her? The Gemara answers: It must be <b>that</b> Gabriel <b>left her one</b> maidservant, <b>as it is not proper that a princess should stand alone.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that it means <b>her hand, let</b> the Torah <b>write</b> explicitly: <b>Her hand [<i>yadah</i>].</b> Why use the more unusual term <i>amatah</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> verse <b>teaches us that her arm extended [<i>ishtarbav</i>]</b> many cubits. <b>As the Master said</b> in another context: <b>And similarly you find with regard to the hand of Pharaoh’s daughter</b> that it extended, <b>and similarly you find with regard to the teeth of evildoers, as it is written: “You have broken [<i>shibbarta</i>] the teeth of the wicked”</b> (Psalms 3:8), <b>and Reish Lakish said: Do not read</b> the word as <b><i>shibbarta</i>, rather</b> read it as <b><i>sheribbavta</i>,</b> you have extended.

### Part 8
The next verse states: <b>“And she opened it and saw it [<i>vatirehu</i>], even the child”</b> (Exodus 2:6). The Gemara comments: The verse states: “And she saw it”; <b>it should have</b> stated: <b>And she saw. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> In addition to Moses, <b>she saw the Divine Presence with him.</b> This is indicated by the usage of “saw it.”

### Part 9
The verse states: “And saw it, even the child [<i>yeled</i>]; <b>and behold a lad [<i>na’ar</i>] that wept”</b> (Exodus 2:6). The verse <b>calls him “a child [<i>yeled</i>],” and</b> the same verse <b>calls him “a lad [<i>na’ar</i>].”</b> A Sage <b>teaches: He is</b> the age of <b>a child but his voice</b> is as loud and deep <b>as a lad;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: If</b> that is <b>so, you made Moses our teacher blemished,</b> since his voice was unusually deep. <b>Rather,</b> this <b>teaches that his mother made a canopy of youth,</b> i.e., a small canopy, <b>for him in the ark,</b> as <b>she said: Perhaps I will not merit to</b> see <b>his</b> wedding <b>canopy.</b>

### Part 10
The verse concludes: <b>“And she had compassion on him, and said: This [<i>zeh</i>] is one of the Hebrews’ children”</b> (Exodus 2:6). The Gemara asks: <b>From where did she know</b> that he was a Hebrew child? <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: As she saw</b> that <b>he was circumcised.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara comments: The Pharaoh’s daughter said: <b>“This [<i>zeh</i>]</b> is one of the Hebrews’ children” (Exodus 2:6). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This <b>teaches that she prophesied unknowingly,</b> as the intention of the word “<i>zeh</i>” was: <b>This</b> one <b>falls,</b> i.e., is cast, into the water, <b>but no other</b> will <b>fall</b> by means of water, for on that day Pharaoh’s decree was canceled.

### Part 12
The Gemara explains: <b>And this is what Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And when they shall say to you: Seek unto the necromancers and the diviners, that chirp [<i>metzaftzefim</i>] and that mutter [<i>mahggim</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 8:19)? The explanation of their chirping and muttering is: <b>They see [<i>tzofin</i>], but they do not know what they are seeing; they enunciate [<i>mahggim</i>], but they do not know what they are enunciating.</b> Although necromancers and diviners do have some insight into the future, they do not see clearly enough to understand what they are actually seeing.

### Part 13
The Gemara applies this to Pharaoh: Pharaoh’s astrologers <b>saw that the savior of the Jewish people would be stricken by water.</b> Therefore, <b>they arose and decreed: “Every son that is born you shall cast into the river”</b> (Exodus 1:22); they thought that their vision indicated that Moses would be killed in the water. <b>Once</b> Jochebed <b>cast Moses</b> into the water, although he was protected in an ark, the astrologers <b>said: We no longer see</b> in the stars anything <b>like that sign</b> we saw as to the downfall of the leader of the Jews by water, and therefore at that moment <b>they canceled their decree. But they did not know that</b> what they saw foretold that Moses <b>would be stricken on account of the waters of Meribah.</b> They envisioned a downfall for Moses by water but didn’t fully comprehend their vision.

### Part 14
<b>And this is what Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “These [<i>hemma</i>] are the waters of Meribah, where</b> the children of Israel <b>strove</b> with the Lord, and He was sanctified in them” (Numbers 20:13)? The verse indicates that <b>these are</b> the waters <b>that the astrologers of Pharaoh saw and</b> on account of which they <b>erred. And this is what Moses said:</b> “The people, among whom I am, <b>are six hundred thousand men on foot [<i>ragli</i>];</b> and yet You have said: I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month” (Numbers 11:21). <b>Moses said to the Jewish people: On account of me,</b> which is an alternative meaning of the word ragli, <b>all of you were saved,</b> as the decree to throw all males into the river was canceled on my account.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says: That day</b> that Moses was placed in the river <b>was the twenty-first</b> day of the month <b>of Nisan. The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> should the <b>one who in the future will say</b> the <b>Song at the</b> Red <b>Sea on this day be stricken on this day?</b> As this was also the date on which the Red Sea would be parted during the salvation of the Exodus.

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina says: That day was</b> actually <b>the sixth</b> day of the month <b>of Sivan. The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> should the <b>one who in the future will receive</b> the <b>Torah on Mount Sinai on this day be stricken on this day?</b> As this was also the date on which the Torah was received.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that Moses was placed in the water <b>on the sixth of Sivan, you find</b> that there can be <b>three months</b> during which Moses was hidden after his birth; <b>as the Master said</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:7): Moses <b>died on the seventh of Adar, and Moses was born on the seventh of Adar. And</b> based on this, <b>from the seventh of Adar until the sixth of Sivan</b> there are <b>three months,</b> which correspond to the three months Moses was hidden before being placed in the water. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that it was <b>on the twenty-first of Nisan, how can you find</b> that he was hidden for three months?

### Part 18
The Gemara answers: <b>That year was a leap year</b> in which there were two months of Adar. Moses was hidden <b>most of the first</b> month of the three, from the seventh day of the first Adar when he was born, <b>and most of the last</b> month of the three, i.e., all of Nisan until the twenty-first, <b>and the entire middle one.</b> All of this together is considered as three months.

### Part 19
The Gemara now discusses the next verse in Exodus: <b>“Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter: Shall I go and call you a nurse of the Hebrew women,</b> that she may nurse the child for you?” (Exodus 2:7). The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> that Pharaoh’s daughter would specifically want a nurse <b>of the Hebrew women?</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara answers: This <b>teaches that</b> prior to this, <b>they took Moses around to all the Egyptian</b> wet nurses <b>and he did not</b> agree to <b>nurse</b> from any of them, as <b>he said:</b> Shall <b>a mouth that in the future</b> will <b>speak with the Divine Presence</b> actually <b>nurse something impure? And this is as it is written: “Whom shall one teach knowledge?</b> And whom shall one make understand the message?” (Isaiah 28:9). The prophet is asking: <b>To whom shall</b> God <b>teach</b> the <b>knowledge</b> of the Torah, <b>and to whom shall</b> God <b>make to understand the message</b> of the Torah? The answer is as the verse continues: <b>“Them that are weaned from the milk, them that are drawn from the breasts”</b> (Isaiah 28:9). The conclusion of the verse indicates that the Torah should be taught to the one who did not want to nurse from the milk of a gentile woman, i.e., Moses.

### Part 21
The next verse states: <b>“And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her: Go.</b> And the maiden [<i>ha’alma</i>] went and called the child’s mother” (Exodus 2:8). <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> This <b>teaches that she went quickly like a maiden,</b> i.e., with the strength of one of marriageable age, and not as the young child that she was. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says:</b> The word <b><i>ha’alma</i></b> is related to the word meaning to hide [<i>le’alem</i>], <b>for she hid her words</b> and didn’t tell Pharaoh’s daughter that she was bringing the baby’s mother.

### Part 22
The next verse states what Pharaoh’s daughter said to Jochebed: <b>“And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her: Take this [<i>heilikhi</i>] child away,</b> and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it” (Exodus 2:9). <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> Pharaoh’s daughter <b>is prophesying and she does not know what she is prophesying,</b> as the word <b><i>heilikhi</i></b> means: <b>This is yours [<i>ha shellikhi</i>],</b> i.e., this is your child. The next part of the verse states: <b>“And I will give you your wages.” Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> This teaches that <b>with regard to righteous people, not only</b> is it so <b>that</b> God arranges <b>that their lost items are returned to them, but</b> He <b>also</b> arranges <b>that they get their wages,</b> as the son of Jochebed was returned to her and she also received payment for nursing him.

### Part 23
Elsewhere, the verse states with regard to Miriam: <b>“And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took</b> a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances” (Exodus 15:20). The Gemara asks: Why is Miriam referred to as <b>“the sister of Aaron,” and not the sister of Moses? Rav Amram says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> Miriam already <b>prophesied when she was</b> still <b>the sister of</b> only <b>Aaron,</b> i.e., before Moses was born.
