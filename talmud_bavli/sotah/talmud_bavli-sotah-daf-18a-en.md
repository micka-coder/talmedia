### Part 1
<b>If one wrote</b> the scroll <b>on two</b> unattached <b>pages, it is unfit,</b> as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “Scroll,” in the singular. It must be written on <b>one scroll and not</b> on <b>two or three scrolls.</b>

### Part 2
<b>If one wrote one letter and erased</b> that <b>one letter</b> in water, <b>and</b> he then <b>wrote one</b> more <b>letter and erased</b> that <b>one letter, it is unfit, as it is written: “And the priest shall execute upon her all this law”</b> (Numbers 5:30). The entire passage must be written completely and only then erased, all at once.

### Part 3
§ <b>Rava raised a dilemma: If one wrote two scrolls for two</b> separate <b><i>sota</i> women but</b> then <b>erased</b> both of the scrolls <b>in one cup, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do <b>we require</b> that only the <b>writing</b> be performed <b>for the sake of</b> a specific woman, in which case <b>that is</b> accomplished here? <b>Or perhaps we require</b> that <b>also</b> the <b>erasure</b> be performed <b>for the sake of</b> a specific woman, which is not accomplished here, since both scrolls are erased together?

### Part 4
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>we require</b> that <b>also</b> the <b>erasure</b> be <b>for the sake of</b> each specific woman, then if the priest <b>erased them in two</b> different <b>cups and</b> afterward <b>mixed</b> the water from both together <b>again, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we require</b> that only the <b>erasure</b> be <b>for the sake of</b> a specific woman, in which case <b>that is</b> accomplished here? <b>Or perhaps</b> since <b>this</b> <i>sota</i> <b>does not drink</b> from only <b>her own</b> water <b>and that</b> <i>sota</i> <b>does not drink</b> from only <b>her own</b> water, the water is disqualified?

### Part 5
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>if you say</b> that the water is disqualified because <b>this one does not drink</b> from only <b>her own</b> water <b>and that one does not drink</b> from only <b>her own</b> water, what if after mixing the two cups of water together the priest <b>divided them again</b> into two cups and gave one to each? <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> then? <b>Is there</b> retroactive <b>clarification,</b> in which case one may claim that each woman drank her own water, <b>or is there no</b> retroactive <b>clarification?</b> The Gemara responds: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 6
<b>Rava raised a dilemma: If</b> the priest <b>administered</b> the bitter water to the <i>sota</i> <b>to drink through</b> a palm <b>fiber, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Or if he administered it <b>through a tube, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Is this</b> considered <b>a normal manner of drinking, or is it not</b> considered <b>a normal manner of drinking,</b> in which case the act is invalid? The Gemara responds: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ashi raised a dilemma:</b> If some <b>of the</b> water of the <i>sota</i> <b>spilled</b> out <b>and some of it remained</b> in the cup, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it sufficient for the woman to drink some of the water in which the scroll has been erased or must she drink all of it? The Gemara responds: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 8
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>the two oaths that are stated with regard to the <i>sota</i>:</b> “And the priest shall cause her to swear” (Numbers 5:19), and: “Then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing” (Numbers 5:21), <b>why</b> are they both necessary? <b>One</b> must be administered <b>before the scroll is erased and one</b> must be administered <b>after it is erased.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rava objects to this: Both of the</b> oaths <b>are written</b> in the Torah <b>before</b> any mention of <b>the scroll</b> being <b>erased.</b> What is the basis to claim that one oath was administered afterward? <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> While both oaths are administered before the <i>sota</i> drinks, the two oaths are different: <b>One is an oath that has a curse with it, and one is an oath that does not have a curse with it.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>an oath that has a curse with it?</b> What is the language of this oath? <b>Rav Amram says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The priest says: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> that you are honest in your claim <b>that you were not defiled, as, if you were defiled,</b> all these curses <b>will come upon you.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rava said:</b> This is insufficient, as <b>the curse stands by itself and the oath stands by itself.</b> They are said in separate statements, and it cannot be considered to be an oath with a curse. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The priest says: <b>I administer an oath to you that if you were defiled,</b> all these curses <b>will come upon you.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> Even this is insufficient, as <b>there is a curse</b> but <b>there is no oath</b> that she was not defiled. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said:</b> The priest must say: <b>I administer an oath to you that you were not defiled and</b> that <b>if you were defiled</b> all these curses <b>will come upon you.</b> Here the oath itself includes the curse.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>With regard to what does she say: “Amen, amen”</b> (Number 5:22), twice, as recorded in the verse? The mishna explains that it includes of the following: <b>Amen on the curse,</b> as she accepts the curse upon herself if she is guilty, and <b>amen on the oath,</b> as she declares that she is not defiled. She states: <b>Amen</b> if I committed adultery <b>with this man</b> about whom I was warned, <b>amen</b> if I committed adultery <b>with another man. Amen that I did not stray</b> when I was <b>betrothed nor</b> after I was <b>married,</b>
