### Part 1
<b>and burns it in</b> the <b>service vessel.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Does he</b> really <b>burn it in a service vessel? Rather, say: He brings it up</b> to the altar <b>in a service vessel</b> in order <b>to burn it.</b>

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And he salts it and places it on the fires.</b> The Gemara cites the source: <b>As it is written: “And every meal-offering of yours you shall season with salt”</b> (Leviticus 2:13).

### Part 3
The <i>baraita</i> continues: After <b>the handful is sacrificed, the remainders of</b> the meal-offering <b>are eaten.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written:</b> “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests…<b>and the priest shall make the memorial part thereof smoke</b> upon the altar” (Leviticus 2:2). The memorial part is the handful. <b>And it is written</b> afterward: <b>“But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be for Aaron and his sons”</b> (Leviticus 2:3).

### Part 4
The <i>baraita</i> uses the phrase: After <b>the handful is sacrificed.</b> This phrase can be understood <b>according to</b> one <b>Sage as he holds, and according to</b> another <b>Sage as he holds. As it is stated</b> that there is a dispute between the Sages: <b>From when does the</b> sacrifice of the <b>handful render the remainder</b> of the meal-offering <b>permitted for consumption</b> by the priests? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> It is <b>when the fire takes hold of it,</b> i.e., when it ignites. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>when the fire consumes most of</b> the handful. Each of these <i>amora’im</i> understands the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with his opinion.

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And the priests are permitted to put wine and oil and honey in</b> the remainder of the meal-offering. <b>What is the reason? The verse states</b> with regard to the gifts given to the priests: “And I, behold, I have given you the charge of My <i>terumot</i>…<b>for a consecrated portion”</b> (Numbers 18:8). The phrase “for a consecrated portion” indicates that the gifts are given <b>as</b> a mark of <b>greatness</b> and should be eaten <b>in the manner that the kings eat.</b>

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>And they are prohibited only from allowing</b> the meal-offering <b>to become leavened.</b> The Gemara cites the source: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to meal-offerings: <b>“It shall not be baked with leaven. Their portion</b> I have given it of My offerings made by fire” (Leviticus 6:10). <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> One should read the verse as if the phrase “their portion” is part of the same phrase as the prohibition of baking with leaven. This teaches that <b>even their portion,</b> i.e., the portion given to the priests, <b>shall not be baked with leaven.</b>

### Part 7
§ The mishna states: <b>All</b> other <b>meal-offerings</b> require oil and frankincense. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> do <b>all</b> other <b>meal-offerings</b> actually <b>require oil and frankincense? But isn’t there the meal-offering of a sinner,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states: “He shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon;</b> for it is a sin-offering” (Leviticus 5:11).

### Part 8
The Gemara responds: <b>This is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: All meal-offerings</b> other than that of the <i>sota</i> <b>require oil and frankincense, and they are brought from wheat; and</b> they <b>are</b> also <b>brought from fine flour.</b> However, <b>the meal-offering of a sinner, even though it does not require oil and frankincense,</b> must still be <b>brought from wheat and brought from fine flour.</b> Similarly, <b>the <i>omer</i> meal-offering, even though it is brought from barley, requires oil and frankincense, and it is brought</b> as <b>groats. But this one,</b> the <i>sota</i> meal-offering, <b>requires neither oil nor frankincense, and it is brought from barley and brought</b> as unsifted <b>flour.</b> While the meal-offering of a sinner and the <i>omer</i> meal-offering are similar to other meal-offerings in one of these respects, the <i>sota</i> meal-offering is different in both respects.

### Part 9
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:10) that <b>Rabbi Shimon said: By right,</b> it should have been the <i>halakha</i> <b>that the meal-offering of a sinner requires oil and frankincense, so that a sinner should not</b> stand to <b>gain</b> by not having to pay for them. <b>For what</b> reason <b>does</b> the verse <b>not require</b> them? It is <b>so that his offering will not be</b> of <b>superior</b> quality.

### Part 10
<b>And by right,</b> it should have been the <i>halakha</i> <b>that a sin-offering</b> brought for transgression of a prohibition punishable by <i>karet</i>, e.g., consumption <b>of</b> forbidden <b>fat, requires</b> fine flour and <b>libations</b> of oil, and wine. Just as burnt-offerings and peace-offerings require these, a sin-offering should require them as well <b>so that a sinner should not</b> stand to <b>gain</b> by not having to pay for them. <b>For what</b> reason <b>does it not require</b> them? It is <b>so that his offering will not be</b> of <b>superior</b> quality.

### Part 11
<b>But the sin-offering of a leper and his guilt-offering require libations, as they are not brought on account of a sin.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Leprosy comes on account of seven matters.</b> Leprosy develops on account of sin, so by extension the leper’s offerings are also brought on account of sin. The Gemara answers: <b>There, from</b> the time he contracts <b>his leprosy</b> he <b>gains atonement for</b> his sin through the plague of leprosy itself. Consequently, <b>when he brings the offering, he brings it</b> only <b>in order to permit him</b> to eat <b>sacrificial</b> food.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, then the sin-offering of a nazirite should require libations, because it is not brought on account of a sin.</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar HaKappar, who says: The nazirite is also a sinner,</b> since he denies himself wine unnecessarily.

### Part 13
The mishna states that <b>Rabban Gamliel says: Just as</b> her actions were the actions of an animal, so too, her offering is animal food. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Gamliel said to the Sages: Scribes, permit me, and I will explain it as a type of decorative wreath [<i>ḥomer</i>],</b> i.e., an allegory.
