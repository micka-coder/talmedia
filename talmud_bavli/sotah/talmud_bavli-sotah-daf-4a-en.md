### Part 1
The <i>baraita</i> clarifies: <b>And what is the measure of seclusion,</b> i.e., how is the seclusion of a <i>sota</i> defined? The measure of seclusion is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>defilement,</b> which is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform <b>intercourse,</b> which is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform the <b>initial stage of intercourse.</b>

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> quotes several practical examples of this period of time. This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>circling a palm</b> tree; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>for mixing a cup</b> of wine with water, with the total volume of a quarter-<i>log</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to drink</b> that cup of wine.

### Part 3
The <i>baraita</i> quotes several more examples. <b>Ben Azzai says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to roast an egg. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to swallow it. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to swallow three eggs one after another. Rabbi Elazar ben Yirmeya says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>a weaver [<i>gardi</i>] to tie a string [<i>nima</i>].</b>

### Part 4
<b>Ḥanin ben Pineḥas says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time <b>that</b> a woman <b>may</b> need to <b>extend her hand into her mouth to remove a wood chip</b> from between her teeth. The Sage <b>Peleimu says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time <b>that she may</b> need to <b>extend her hand into a basket</b> in order <b>to take a loaf</b> of bread. He adds: <b>Although there is no</b> explicit <b>proof</b> from a verse <b>for the matter,</b> there is <b>an allusion to the matter</b> from the verse: <b>“For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf of bread”</b> (Proverbs 6:26).

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> stated that the measure of seclusion is equivalent to the time needed for defilement, which is equivalent to the time needed to perform sexual intercourse, which is equivalent to the time needed to perform the initial stage of intercourse, and it added nine practical examples of that length of time. The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>all these</b> times when one should have sufficed?

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: All three <b>are necessary, as if</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> only: <b>Equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>defilement, I would say</b> that the measure is <b>equivalent</b> to the time for <b>her defilement and her appeasement,</b> i.e., the amount of time needed to convince her to engage in sexual intercourse. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the measure is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform <b>sexual intercourse</b> alone.

### Part 7
<b>And if</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> only: The measure of seclusion is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform <b>sexual intercourse, I would say</b> that the measure is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for the <b>completion of</b> the act of <b>intercourse.</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the measure is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform the <b>initial stage of intercourse.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And if</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> only: The measure of seclusion is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform the <b>initial stage of intercourse, I would say</b> that the measure is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform the <b>initial stage of intercourse and her appeasement.</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the measure is <b>equiva-lent</b> to the time needed for <b>defilement,</b> which does not include appeasement. The <i>baraita</i> concludes by offering a practical measure: <b>And what is the measure</b> of the <b>equivalent</b> amount of time needed to perform the <b>initial stage of intercourse?</b> It is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>circling a palm</b> tree. Other Sages then offered their own practical examples.

### Part 9
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a different <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:2): The verse states: <b>“And she was</b> defiled <b>secretly”</b> (Numbers 5:13), <b>and we have not heard what is the measure</b> of <b>seclusion. When it says</b> in that verse: <b>“And she was defiled</b> secretly,” <b>you must say</b> that the measure of seclusion is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>defilement,</b> which is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform <b>sexual intercourse,</b> which is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to perform the <b>initial stage of intercourse,</b> which is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for the <b>returning of a palm</b> tree; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b>

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>mixing a cup</b> of wine with water, with the total volume of a quarter-<i>log</i>. <b>Ben Azzai says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to drink</b> that cup of wine. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to roast an egg. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to swallow it.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara now addresses several contradictions between this <i>baraita</i> and the one quoted earlier. The Gemara first comments: It might <b>enter our mind</b> to say that <b>circling a palm tree is</b> the same as the <b>returning of a palm</b> tree. The Gemara asks: <b>There,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Yishmael says</b> it is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>circling a palm</b> tree <b>and Rabbi Eliezer disagreed with him,</b> while <b>here,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> himself <b>says</b> it is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for the <b>returning of a palm</b> tree; doesn’t this contradict what he stated in the previous <i>baraita</i>?

### Part 12
To resolve this contradiction, <b>Abaye says:</b> These measures are not the same, as <b>circling</b> is referring to the amount of time it takes for one to circle a palm tree <b>by foot,</b> and <b>returning</b> is referring to the amount of time it takes for a palm branch blown <b>by the wind</b> to revert to its prior position.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ashi asks:</b> This <b>returning</b> of the palm branch <b>by the wind,</b> is this the time only <b>so that it goes</b> forward with the wind <b>and returns</b> to its place one time, not including the time it is still moving back and forth due to the wind? <b>Or perhaps</b> it is the time <b>so that it goes</b> forward with the wind <b>and comes back and returns</b> until it <b>settles in its place.</b> The Gemara states: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 14
The Gemara presents another contradiction. <b>There,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>for pouring a cup</b> of wine. <b>Here,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, he says: This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for the <b>returning of a palm</b> tree. The Gemara answers: <b>This and that are one,</b> i.e., the same, <b>measure.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara presents another contradiction. <b>There,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>drinking</b> a cup of wine. <b>Here,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>he says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>mixing a cup</b> of wine. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that he requires both together, i.e., he requires an amount of time <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to</b> both <b>mix and drink</b> a cup of wine. The Gemara asks: Instead of combining the measures, why not <b>let us say</b> that <b>this and that are one measure?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If so, this is</b> the same as the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, with whom Rabbi Yehoshua disagrees.

### Part 16
The Gemara presents another contradiction. <b>There,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>ben Azzai says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to roast an egg. Here,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>he says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to drink</b> a cup of wine. The Gemara answers: <b>This and that are one measure.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara presents another contradiction. <b>There,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to swallow</b> an egg. <b>Here,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>he says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to roast an egg.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that he requires both together, i.e., he requires an amount of time <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to roast an egg and to swallow it.</b> The Gemara asks: Instead of combining the measures, why not <b>let us say</b> that <b>this and that are one measure?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If so, this is</b> the same as the opinion of <b>ben Azzai</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, with whom Rabbi Akiva disagrees.

### Part 18
The Gemara presents another contradiction. <b>There,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to swallow three eggs one after another. Here,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>he says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed <b>to swallow</b> an egg, meaning one egg. The Gemara answers: In the first <i>baraita</i>, he did not state his own opinion, but <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Akiva, who stated</b> that one <b>measures</b> according to the time needed <b>for roasting and swallowing.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua responded: <b>Say</b> instead the <b>measure</b> of the time needed for <b>swallowing alone,</b> i.e., an amount of time <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed to <b>swallow three eggs one after another, which is</b> equal to the amount of time necessary for <b>roasting and swallowing,</b> and therefore Rabbi Akiva would not need to include roasting in the measurement.

### Part 19
The Gemara discusses an opinion cited in the first <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Yirmeya says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time needed for <b>a weaver to tie a string. Rav Ashi asks:</b> Is this speaking of <b>where</b> the ends of the string to be tied <b>are far</b> apart from each other, <b>or</b> is it speaking of <b>where</b> they <b>are near</b> to each other? The Gemara states: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 20
The Gemara discusses another opinion cited in the first <i>baraita</i>. <b>Ḥanin ben Pineḥas says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time <b>that</b> a woman <b>may</b> need to <b>extend her hand into her mouth to remove a wood chip</b> from between her teeth. <b>Rav Ashi asks:</b> Is this speaking of a case <b>where</b> the wood chip <b>is stuck</b> between her teeth, <b>or</b> is it speaking of a case <b>where</b> it <b>is not stuck?</b> The Gemara states: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 21
The Gemara discusses another opinion cited in the first <i>baraita</i>. <b>Peleimu says:</b> This is <b>equivalent</b> to the time <b>that</b> a woman <b>may</b> need to <b>extend her hand into a basket</b> in order <b>to take a loaf</b> of bread. <b>Rav Ashi asks:</b> Is this speaking of an occasion <b>where</b> the loaf <b>adheres</b> to the basket, <b>or</b> is it speaking of a case <b>where</b> it <b>does not adhere?</b> Is this speaking of a case <b>where</b> the basket is <b>new,</b> whereby the tips of the shoots forming the basket might restrain the loaf, <b>or</b> this speaking of <b>where</b> the basket is <b>old</b> and smooth, enabling easy removal? Is this speaking of a case <b>where</b> the loaf is <b>hot</b> and therefore softer and may adhere to the basket, <b>or</b> is this speaking of a case <b>where</b> the loaf is <b>cold</b> and easily removed?
