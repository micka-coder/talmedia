### Part 1
<b>“And he read there before the broad place that was before the Gate of the Water”</b> (Nehemiah 8:3). According to this opinion, the High Priest would read from the Torah in the Temple courtyard. <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> in response: The <i>baraita</i> also means that the reading takes place <b>in the women’s courtyard.</b>

### Part 2
§ It is taught in the mishna that the High Priest receives the Torah scroll <b>and reads</b> the Torah portion beginning with the verse: <b>“After the death”</b> (Leviticus 16:1), <b>and</b> the portion beginning with the verse: <b>“But on the tenth”</b> (Leviticus 23:26). Since these two portions are not adjacent to each other, the High Priest skips the section between the two portions. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Megilla</i> 24a): <b>One may skip</b> sections when reading the <i>haftara</i> <b>in the Prophets, but one may not skip</b> sections when reading <b>in the Torah.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. There,</b> in the mishna in tractate <i>Megilla</i> that teaches that one may not skip, the intention is that one should not skip if the sections are so far apart from one another that the delay caused by doing so will be <b>of such length that the translator</b> who recites the Aramaic translation <b>will conclude</b> his translation before the next section is reached. However, in the case of the mishna <b>here,</b> it is permitted to skip verses because the two passages are in close proximity to one another. The delay caused is <b>of such</b> short <b>length that the translator will</b> still <b>not conclude</b> his translation.

### Part 4
The Gemara challenges this resolution: <b>But isn’t it taught about</b> this mishna in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may skip</b> sections when reading <b>in the Prophets, but one may not skip</b> sections when reading <b>in the Torah. And how much may one skip</b> from one passage to another <b>in the Prophets?</b> One may skip when the section skipped is <b>of such</b> short <b>length that</b> when the furling of the scroll is completed <b>the translator will</b> still <b>not have concluded</b> his translation. <b>By inference,</b> when reading <b>in the Torah</b> one may <b>not</b> skip <b>at all.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> another explanation: This is <b>not difficult.</b> In the mishna <b>here,</b> it is permitted to skip because both passages pertain <b>to a single topic. There,</b> in the mishna in tractate <i>Megilla</i> that teaches that one may not skip, the <i>halakha</i> is referring to a case where the passages pertain <b>to two</b> different <b>topics.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And</b> this is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may skip</b> sections when reading <b>in the Torah</b> when both sections pertain <b>to a single topic, and in the Prophets</b> one may skip from one section to another even if they pertain <b>to two</b> different <b>topics. And</b> both <b>here and there,</b> one may skip only <b>when</b> the section skipped is <b>of such</b> short <b>length that</b> when the furling of the scroll is completed <b>the translator will</b> still <b>not have concluded</b> his translation.

### Part 7
<b>And one may not skip from</b> one book of the <b>Prophets to</b> another book of the <b>Prophets,</b> even if both pertain to the same topic. <b>But among</b> the books <b>of the Twelve Prophets one may skip, provided that one does not skip from the end of the book to its beginning.</b> Rather, if one wishes to read from several of the Twelve Prophets, he must read the passages in the order that they are written.

### Part 8
§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>And he furls the Torah</b> scroll, <b>and places it on his bosom,</b> and says: More than what I have read before you is written here. The Gemara comments: <b>And why</b> must he say <b>all of this?</b> It is <b>so as to not cast aspersions on</b> the <b>Torah scroll,</b> because people might think the portion that he read by heart is not written there.

### Part 9
It is stated in the mishna that <b>he reads by heart</b> the portion beginning with: <b>“And on the tenth,” from the book of Numbers</b> (29:7–11). The Gemara asks: <b>But let him furl the</b> Torah <b>scroll</b> to that portion <b>and read</b> it from the text. <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> This is not done <b>because one may not furl a Torah scroll in public,</b> out of respect for the congregation.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>let them bring another Torah scroll</b> that has previously been furled to that portion <b>and read</b> from it? <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda says:</b> People might then mistakenly think that the second scroll was brought <b>due to a flaw</b> that was found <b>in</b> the <b>first</b> scroll. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> Another scroll is not brought <b>because</b> then the High Priest will need to recite an additional blessing over it, and <b>one may not recite a blessing that is unnecessary.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara questions Rav Huna bar Yehuda’s answer: <b>But are we</b> really <b>concerned that</b> people will think that there is <b>a flaw</b> in the first scroll? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa say:</b> When <b>the New Moon of Tevet,</b> which always occurs during Hanukkah, <b>occurs on Shabbat, one brings three Torah</b> scrolls. <b>And he reads from one</b> scroll <b>the topic of the day,</b> i.e., the weekly portion; <b>and</b> from <b>one</b> scroll the portion <b>of the New Moon; and</b> from <b>one</b> scroll the portion <b>of Hanukkah.</b> It is apparent from the statement of Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa that many Torah scrolls may be used, and there is no concern that people will mistakenly think that one or more has a flaw.

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: When <b>three men</b> read <b>from three scrolls, there is no</b> concern that people will think that one of the scrolls has <b>a flaw,</b> since people assume that it is befitting for each individual to read from his own scroll. However, when <b>one man</b> reads <b>from two</b> different Torah <b>scrolls, there is</b> a concern that people will think that the first scroll has <b>a flaw,</b> and they will not realize that this was done only to avoid forcing the community to wait while the scroll is furled.

### Part 13
§ It is taught in the mishna: <b>And</b> after the reading the High Priest <b>recites eight blessings. The Sages taught</b> that these are the eight blessings: <b>He recites a blessing concerning the Torah in the</b> usual <b>way one recites</b> a blessing in <b>the synagogue, and</b> he recites the three blessings <b>concerning the</b> Temple <b>service, and concerning thanksgiving, and concerning forgiveness for iniquity,</b> and all are recited <b>in accordance with their established forms</b> in the <i>Amida</i> prayer. He recites the blessing <b>concerning the Temple in and of itself,</b> the blessing <b>concerning the priests in and of itself,</b> the blessing <b>concerning the Jewish people in and of itself, and</b> the blessing <b>concerning Jerusalem in and of itself.</b>

### Part 14
With regard to the end of the mishna, which states: <b>And the rest of the prayer, the Sages taught: The</b> text of <b>the rest of the prayer</b> is as follows: <b>A supplication, a song, and a request that Your people, Israel, are in need of redemption. And he concludes</b> the blessing <b>with:</b> Blessed are You, Lord, <b>the One Who hears prayer. From this</b> point <b>forward, each and every person</b> present <b>brings a Torah scroll from his home and reads from it. And why</b> do <b>all these</b> people bring their personal Torah scrolls? Everyone brings his own <b>in order to show its</b> beautiful <b>appearance to the public,</b> as a way of showing fondness for the mitzva.

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>How</b> is <b>the portion of</b> the Torah that is read by <b>the king</b> recited at the assembly, when all the Jewish people would assemble? At <b>the conclusion of the first day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>on the eighth,</b> after <b>the conclusion of the Sabbatical Year, they make a wooden platform for</b> the king <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard, and he sits on it, as it is stated: “At the end of every seven years, in the Festival</b> of the Sabbatical Year” (Deuteronomy 31:10).

### Part 16
<b>The synagogue attendant takes a Torah scroll and gives it to the head of the synagogue</b> that stands on the Temple Mount. <b>And the head of the synagogue gives it to the deputy</b> High Priest, <b>and the deputy</b> High Priest <b>gives it to the High Priest, and the High priest gives it to the king. And the king stands, and receives</b> the Torah scroll, <b>and reads</b> from it while <b>sitting.</b>

### Part 17
<b>King Agrippa arose, and received</b> the Torah scroll, <b>and read</b> from it while <b>standing, and the Sages praised him</b> for this. <b>And when</b> Agrippa <b>arrived at</b> the verse in the portion read by the king that states: <b>“You may not appoint a foreigner over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15), <b>tears flowed from his eyes,</b> because he was a descendant of the house of Herod and was not of Jewish origin. The entire nation <b>said to him: Fear not, Agrippa. You are our brother, you are our brother.</b>

### Part 18
<b>And</b> the king <b>reads from the beginning of</b> Deuteronomy, from the verse that states: <b>“And these are the words”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:1), <b>until</b> the words: <b>“Hear,</b> O Israel” (Deuteronomy 6:4). <b>And</b> he then reads the sections beginning with: <b>“Hear,</b> O Israel” (Deuteronomy 6:4–9), <b>“And it shall come to pass, if you shall hearken”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:13–21), <b>“You shall tithe”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:22–29), <b>“When you have made an end of the tithing”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:12–15), <b>and the passage concerning the</b> appointment of <b>a king</b> (Deuteronomy 17:14–20), <b>and the blessings and curses</b> (Deuteronomy 28), <b>until he finishes the entire portion.</b>

### Part 19
The same <b>blessings that the High Priest recites</b> on Yom Kippur, <b>the king recites</b> at this ceremony, <b>but he delivers</b> a blessing <b>concerning the Festivals in place of</b> the blessing concerning <b>forgiveness for iniquity.</b>

### Part 20
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that the assembly takes place on the eighth. The Gemara asks: Does it <b>enter your mind</b> that the assembly takes place <b>on the eighth</b> day of the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>? The mishna clearly states that the ceremony takes place at the conclusion of the first day of the Festival. Rather, <b>say</b> that it takes place <b>during the eighth</b> year of the Sabbatical cycle.

### Part 21
The verse describes in detail when the assembly takes place: “At the end of every seven years, in the Festival of the Sabbatical Year, in the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 31:10–11). The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>all these</b> details?

### Part 22
The Gemara answers: All of these details <b>are necessary, as, if the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>“at the end</b> of every seven years” (Deuteronomy 31:10), <b>I would have said</b> that <b>we count from now,</b> i.e., from when this was said, <b>and</b> that the tally of years begins from the fortieth year in the wilderness, <b>even though</b> by this calculation the assembly <b>would not occur in the Sabbatical Year.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “The Sabbatical Year.”</b>

### Part 23
<b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> only the phrase: At the end of every seven years of the <b>“Sabbatical Year,” I would have said</b> that it takes place <b>at the end of the Sabbatical Year.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “In the Festival,”</b> and the first Festival following the Sabbatical Year is in the month of Tishrei.

### Part 24
<b>And if</b> the Torah <b>had written</b> only: “At the end of every seven years <b>in the Festival</b> of the Sabbatical Year,” <b>I would have said</b> that it takes place <b>on</b> the festival of <b>Rosh Hashanah,</b> which is on the first day of Tishrei. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One</b> also <b>writes: “In the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>.”</b>

### Part 25
<b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“In the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>,” I would have said</b> that it could refer <b>even</b> to <b>the last</b> day of the <b>Festival.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One</b> also <b>writes: “When all Israel comes”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:11),
