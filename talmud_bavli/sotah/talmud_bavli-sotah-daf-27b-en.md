### Part 1
<b>“And the priest shall stand the woman before the Lord…and place</b> the meal-offering of memorial <b>in her hands”</b> (Numbers 5:18), indicating that if she is unable to stand up straight or if she does not have hands with which to accept the offering, then she does not drink; <b>so</b> too, <b>if</b> the husband <b>were lame or without hands, he would not cause</b> his wife <b>to drink. Mar Bar Rav Ashi says: Just as a mute woman would not drink, as it is written: “And the woman shall say: Amen, Amen”</b> (Numbers 5:22), indicating that she must be able to speak; <b>so</b> too, <b>if</b> the husband <b>were mute,</b> he <b>would not cause</b> his wife <b>to drink.</b>
