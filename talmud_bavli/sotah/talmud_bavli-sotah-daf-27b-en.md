### Part 1
<b>“And the priest shall stand the woman before the Lord…and place</b> the meal-offering of memorial <b>in her hands”</b> (Numbers 5:18), indicating that if she is unable to stand up straight or if she does not have hands with which to accept the offering, then she does not drink; <b>so</b> too, <b>if</b> the husband <b>were lame or without hands, he would not cause</b> his wife <b>to drink. Mar Bar Rav Ashi says: Just as a mute woman would not drink, as it is written: “And the woman shall say: Amen, Amen”</b> (Numbers 5:22), indicating that she must be able to speak; <b>so</b> too, <b>if</b> the husband <b>were mute,</b> he <b>would not cause</b> his wife <b>to drink.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Just as the water evaluates her</b> fidelity, <b>so too, the water evaluates his,</b> i.e., her alleged paramour’s, involvement in the sin, <b>as it is stated: “And</b> the water that causes the curse <b>shall enter</b> into her” (Numbers 5:24), and it is stated again: <b>“And</b> the water that causes the curse <b>shall enter</b> into her and become bitter” (Numbers 5:27). It is derived from the double mention of the phrase “and…shall enter” that both the woman and her paramour are evaluated by the water.

### Part 4
Furthermore, prior to her drinking the water, <b>just as she is forbidden to</b> her <b>husband, so</b> too <b>is she forbidden to</b> her <b>paramour, because</b> in contrast to the verse stating: <b>“Is defiled [<i>nitma’a</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:14), a superfluous conjoining prefix <i>vav</i> is added to a later verse, rendering the phrase: <b>“And is defiled [<i>venitma’a</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:29). The addition indicates another prohibition, that of the woman to her paramour. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: That was how Zekharya ben HaKatzav would interpret</b> it, i.e., he also derived from the superfluous <i>vav</i> that the woman is forbidden to her paramour. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> an alternate source: The <b>two times that</b> the defilement of the wife <b>is stated in the passage,</b> namely: “And he warns his wife, and <b>she is defiled”</b> (Numbers 5:14), and the later verse: “When a wife, being under her husband, goes astray <b>and is defiled”</b> (Numbers 5:29), indicate that her defilement results in two prohibitions. <b>One</b> is that she is forbidden <b>to</b> her <b>husband and one</b> is that she is forbidden <b>to</b> her <b>paramour.</b>

### Part 6
§ <b>On that same day</b> that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya was appointed head of the Sanhedrin, <b>Rabbi Akiva interpreted</b> the verse: <b>“And every earthen vessel into which any of them falls, whatever is in it shall be impure [<i>yitma</i>],</b> and you shall break it” (Leviticus 11:33), as follows: The verse <b>does not state: Is impure [<i>tamei</i>],</b> but <b>rather: “Shall be impure,”</b> in order <b>to</b> indicate that not only does the vessel itself become ritually impure, but it can now <b>render other</b> items <b>ritually impure.</b> This <b>teaches with regard to a loaf</b> that has <b>second-</b>degree ritual impurity status due to its being placed inside an earthenware vessel that had first-degree impurity, <b>that it can render</b> other food with which it comes into contact <b>impure</b> with <b>third-</b>degree impurity status.

### Part 7
After hearing Rabbi Akiva’s statement, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: Who will remove the dirt from your eyes, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai,</b> so that you could live and see this? <b>As you would say:</b> In the <b>future, another generation</b> is destined <b>to deem pure a loaf</b> that contracted <b>third-</b>degree impurity, <b>as there is no</b> explicit <b>verse from the Torah</b> stating <b>that it is impure. But</b> now <b>Rabbi Akiva, your disciple, brings a verse from the Torah</b> indicating <b>that it is impure, as it is stated: “Whatever is in it shall be impure.”</b>

### Part 8
Furthermore, <b>on that same day Rabbi Akiva interpreted</b> the verses with regard to the Levite cities as follows: One verse states: <b>“And you shall measure outside the city for the east side two thousand cubits…</b>this shall be for them the open land outside the cities” (Numbers 35:5), <b>and another verse states:</b> “And the open land around the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall be <b>from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cubits round about”</b> (Numbers 35:4).

### Part 9
<b>It is impossible to say</b> that the area around the cities given to the Levites was only <b>one thousand cubits, as it is already stated: “Two thousand cubits.” And it is impossible to say</b> that <b>two thousand cubits</b> were left for them, <b>as it is already stated: “One thousand cubits.” How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? <b>One thousand cubits</b> are to be set aside as <b>a tract</b> of open land surrounding the city, <b>and</b> the <b>two thousand cubits</b> are mentioned not in order to be given to the Levites, but to indicate the boundary of <b>the Shabbat limit,</b> beyond which it is forbidden to travel on Shabbat. This verse thereby serves as the source for the two-thousand-cubit Shabbat limit.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, says</b> otherwise: <b>One thousand cubits</b> were given to the Levites as an open <b>tract</b> of land, that could not be planted or built upon, <b>and two thousand cubits</b> of additional land were given to the Levites for planting <b>fields and vineyards.</b>

### Part 11
Additionally, <b>on that same day Rabbi Akiva interpreted</b> the verse: <b>“Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to the Lord, and said, saying”</b> (Exodus 15:1), as follows: <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> the word <b>“saying,”</b> because it states the word “said” immediately prior to it, <b>why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> the word <b>“saying”? It teaches that the Jewish people would repeat in song after Moses every single statement</b> he said, <b>as</b> is done when <b>reciting <i>hallel</i>.</b> After Moses would recite a verse, they would say as a refrain: <b>“I will sing to the Lord, for He is highly exalted”</b> (Exodus 15:1). It is <b>for this</b> reason that the word <b>“saying” is stated,</b> in addition to the word “said.”

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Neḥemya says:</b> The people sang the song together with Moses <b>as</b> is done when <b>reciting <i>Shema</i>,</b> which is recited in unison after the prayer leader begins, <b>and not as</b> is done when <b>reciting <i>hallel</i>.</b>

### Part 13
<b>On that same day Rabbi Yehoshua ben Hyrcanus taught: Job served the Holy One, Blessed be He, only out of love, as it is stated: “Though He will slay me, still I will trust in Him”</b> (Job 13:15). <b>And still, the matter is even,</b> i.e., the verse is ambiguous, as there are two possible interpretations of the verse. Was Job saying: <b>I will await Him,</b> expressing his yearning for God; <b>or</b> should the verse be interpreted as saying <b>I will not await</b> Him. As the word “lo” can mean either “to him” or “not,” it is unclear which meaning is intended here. This dilemma is resolved elsewhere, where <b>the verse states</b> a clearer indication of Job’s intent: <b>“Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me”</b> (Job 27:5). This <b>teaches that he acted out of love.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: Who will remove the dirt from your eyes, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai,</b> so that you could live and see this? <b>As you taught all your life that Job worshipped the Omnipresent only out of fear, as it is stated:</b> “And that <b>man</b> was <b>wholehearted and upright, and God-fearing, and shunned evil”</b> (Job 1:1); <b>but</b> now <b>Yehoshua</b> ben Hyrcanus, <b>the disciple of your disciple, has taught that</b> Job <b>acted out of love.</b>

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is stated in the mishna that just as the water evaluates whether the woman was unfaithful, so too, the water evaluates whether <b>he</b> committed this sin. The Gemara asks: <b>To whom</b> does this refer? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring <b>to the husband, what did the husband do</b> that he should be evaluated? <b>And if you would say</b>
