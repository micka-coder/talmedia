### Part 1
<b>as it is written: “This</b> is the law of jealousy.” The word “this” is a restricting term and excludes that possibility. <b>With regard to two</b> different <b>husbands and two</b> different <b>paramours,</b> where her first husband suspected her with regard to one paramour during her first marriage and the second husband suspected her with regard to a different man during the second marriage, <b>everyone agrees that the woman drinks and repeats, as it is written:</b> “This is <b>the law of</b> jealousy,” in all cases of jealousy.

### Part 2
<b>They disagree when</b> there is <b>one husband and two paramours,</b> i.e., where one husband warned her with regard to a second paramour after she survived her first ordeal. They also disagree <b>in</b> a case of <b>two husbands and one paramour,</b> i.e., if her second husband accused her with regard to the same paramour on account of whom she was compelled to drink by her first husband.

### Part 3
The opinions are justified as follows: <b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that the phrase <b>“the law of</b> jealousy” serves <b>to include all of these</b> cases. In almost all cases the woman drinks and repeats. The word <b>“this”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> only the case of <b>one husband and one paramour,</b> in which she does not drink and repeat.

### Part 4
<b>And the Rabbis</b> mentioned <b>later</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>hold</b> that the word <b>“this”</b> serves <b>to exclude all of these</b> cases. The woman almost never drinks and repeats. The phrase <b>“the law of</b> jealousy” serves <b>to include</b> only the case of <b>two husbands and two paramours,</b> in which she does drink and repeat.

### Part 5
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> holds: The word <b>“this”</b> serves <b>to exclude two</b> of the cases, and the phrase <b>“the law of</b> jealousy” serves <b>to include two.</b> The word <b>“this”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> the <b>two</b> cases of <b>one husband and one paramour</b> and <b>one husband and two paramours.</b> In neither of these cases does the woman drink and repeat. The phrase <b>“the law of</b> jealousy” serves <b>to include two</b> cases, i.e., <b>two husbands and one paramour,</b> and all the more so <b>two husbands and two paramours.</b> In both of these cases, the woman must drink and repeat.
