### Part 1
<b>as it is written: “This</b> is the law of jealousy.” The word “this” is a restricting term and excludes that possibility. <b>With regard to two</b> different <b>husbands and two</b> different <b>paramours,</b> where her first husband suspected her with regard to one paramour during her first marriage and the second husband suspected her with regard to a different man during the second marriage, <b>everyone agrees that the woman drinks and repeats, as it is written:</b> “This is <b>the law of</b> jealousy,” in all cases of jealousy.

### Part 2
<b>They disagree when</b> there is <b>one husband and two paramours,</b> i.e., where one husband warned her with regard to a second paramour after she survived her first ordeal. They also disagree <b>in</b> a case of <b>two husbands and one paramour,</b> i.e., if her second husband accused her with regard to the same paramour on account of whom she was compelled to drink by her first husband.

### Part 3
The opinions are justified as follows: <b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that the phrase <b>“the law of</b> jealousy” serves <b>to include all of these</b> cases. In almost all cases the woman drinks and repeats. The word <b>“this”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> only the case of <b>one husband and one paramour,</b> in which she does not drink and repeat.

### Part 4
<b>And the Rabbis</b> mentioned <b>later</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>hold</b> that the word <b>“this”</b> serves <b>to exclude all of these</b> cases. The woman almost never drinks and repeats. The phrase <b>“the law of</b> jealousy” serves <b>to include</b> only the case of <b>two husbands and two paramours,</b> in which she does drink and repeat.

### Part 5
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> holds: The word <b>“this”</b> serves <b>to exclude two</b> of the cases, and the phrase <b>“the law of</b> jealousy” serves <b>to include two.</b> The word <b>“this”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> the <b>two</b> cases of <b>one husband and one paramour</b> and <b>one husband and two paramours.</b> In neither of these cases does the woman drink and repeat. The phrase <b>“the law of</b> jealousy” serves <b>to include two</b> cases, i.e., <b>two husbands and one paramour,</b> and all the more so <b>two husbands and two paramours.</b> In both of these cases, the woman must drink and repeat.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>He would take her meal-offering out of</b> the <b>Egyptian wicker basket</b> made of palm leaves in which it was lying <b>and would put it into a service vessel and</b> then <b>place it on her hand. And</b> the <b>priest</b> would then <b>place his hand underneath hers and wave it</b> together with her. The priest <b>waved</b> it <b>and brought</b> it <b>near</b> to the southwest corner of the altar, <b>removed a handful</b> from it, <b>and burned</b> the handful; <b>and the remainder was eaten by the priests.</b>

### Part 8
The priest <b>would force</b> the woman <b>to drink</b> the bitter water of a <i>sota</i>, <b>and afterward he would sacrifice her meal-offering. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The priest would <b>sacrifice her meal-offering and afterward he would force her to drink, as it is stated:</b> “And the priest shall take a handful of the meal-offering, as the memorial part of it, and burn it upon the altar, <b>and afterward he shall make the woman drink the water”</b> (Numbers 5:26). But Rabbi Shimon concedes that <b>if</b> the priest first <b>forced her to drink and afterward sacrificed her meal-offering,</b> it is still <b>valid.</b>

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Elazar said to Rabbi Yoshiya of his generation,</b> i.e., his contemporary: <b>You shall not sit on your feet until you explain this matter</b> to me: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>the meal-offering of a <i>sota</i> requires waving?</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at the question: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? It is explicitly <b>written with regard to</b> the meal-offering of a <i>sota</i>: “And the priest shall take the meal-offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand, <b>and shall wave</b> the meal-offering before the Lord, and bring it unto the altar” (Numbers 5:25). Rather, the question is as follows: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the waving is performed <b>by the owner,</b> i.e., the woman, and not only by the priest?

### Part 10
Rabbi Yoshiya answered: This is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>“hand”</b> written here and <b>“hand” from</b> the <b>peace-offering:</b> It <b>is written here,</b> with regard to the meal-offering of a <i>sota</i>: <b>“And the priest shall take</b> the meal-offering of jealousy <b>out of the woman’s hand”</b> (Numbers 5:25), <b>and</b> it <b>is written there,</b> with regard to the peace-offering: “He that offers his peace-offerings unto the Lord…<b>His own hands shall bring</b> the offerings…that the breast may be waved before the Lord” (Leviticus 7:29–30).

### Part 11
<b>Just as here,</b> in the case of the <i>sota</i>, the <b>priest</b> waves the offering, <b>so too there,</b> in the case of the peace-offering, the <b>priest</b> waves the offering. <b>And just as there,</b> in the case of the peace-offering, the <b>owner</b> waves the offering, <b>so too here,</b> in the case of the <i>sota</i>, the <b>owner</b> waves the offering. <b>How</b> is <b>this</b> accomplished? The priest <b>places his hand beneath the hands of the owner and</b> then <b>waves</b> the offering with the owner.

### Part 12
§ The mishna states: The priest <b>waved</b> it <b>and brought</b> it <b>near</b> to the southwest corner of the altar, <b>removed a handful</b> from it, and burned the handful. Yet the continuation of the mishna states: The priest <b>would force</b> the woman <b>to drink, and afterward he would sacrifice her meal-offering.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t</b> the mishna state in the previous phrase that the offering <b>was</b> already <b>sacrificed?</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: What was the</b> sacrificial <b>order of meal-offerings</b> in general? The priest <b>waved</b> the meal-offering <b>and brought</b> it <b>near</b> to the southwest corner of the altar, <b>removed a handful</b> from it, <b>and burned</b> the handful, <b>and the remainder was eaten by the priests.</b>

### Part 14
<b>And</b> as <b>for</b> the correct order for sacrificing the meal-offering of the <i>sota</i> and <b>forcing</b> her <b>to drink,</b> this <b>itself</b> is a matter about which <b>Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis disagree, as the Rabbis hold</b> that the priest would <b>force</b> the woman <b>to drink and afterward he</b> would <b>sacrifice her meal-offering; and Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that the priest would <b>sacrifice her meal-offering and afterward he</b> would <b>force her to drink, as</b> it <b>is stated:</b> “And the priest shall take a handful of the meal-offering, as the memorial part of it, and burn it upon the altar, <b>and afterward he shall make</b> the woman <b>drink</b> the water” (Numbers 5:26).

### Part 15
§ The mishna states: <b>But</b> Rabbi Shimon concedes that <b>if</b> the priest first <b>forced her to drink and afterward sacrificed her meal-offering,</b> the offering is still <b>valid.</b>
