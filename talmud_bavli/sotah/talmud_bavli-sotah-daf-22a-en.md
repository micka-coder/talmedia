### Part 1
is one <b>who read</b> the Written Torah <b>and learned</b> the Mishna <b>but did not serve Torah scholars</b> in order to learn the reasoning behind the <i>halakhot</i>. Since he believes himself knowledgeable, he issues halakhic rulings, but due to his lack of understanding he rules erroneously and is therefore considered wicked. His cunning is in his public display of knowledge, which misleads others into considering him a true Torah scholar.

### Part 2
<b>It was stated:</b> With regard to one who <b>read</b> the Written Torah <b>and learned</b> the Mishna <b>but did not serve Torah scholars, Rabbi Elazar says: This</b> person <b>is an ignoramus. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: This</b> person <b>is a boor. Rabbi Yannai says: This</b> person <b>is</b> comparable to <b>a Samaritan,</b> who follows the Written Torah but not the traditions of the Sages.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says: This</b> person <b>is</b> comparable to <b>a sorcerer [<i>magosh</i>],</b> who uses his knowledge to mislead people. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It is reasonable to</b> accept the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov, as people say</b> proverbially: <b>The sorcerer chants and does not know what he is saying;</b> so too, <b>the <i>tanna</i> teaches</b> the Mishna <b>and does not know what he is saying.</b>

### Part 4
§ <b>The Sages taught: Who is an ignoramus [<i>am ha’aretz</i>]?</b> It is <b>anyone who does not recite <i>Shema</i></b> in the <b>morning and evening with its blessings;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> It is <b>anyone who does not don phylacteries. Ben Azzai says:</b> It is <b>anyone who does not have ritual fringes on his garment. Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef said:</b> It is <b>anyone who has sons and does not raise them to study Torah. <i>Aḥerim</i> say: Even if one reads</b> the Written Torah <b>and learns</b> the Mishna <b>but does not serve Torah scholars, he is an ignoramus.</b>

### Part 5
If one <b>read</b> the Written Torah <b>but did not learn</b> the Mishna, <b>he is a boor. With regard to</b> one who <b>did not read and did not learn</b> at all, <b>the verse states:</b> “Behold, the days come, says the Lord, <b>and I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast”</b> (Jeremiah 31:26). One who has not studied at all is comparable to a beast.

### Part 6
The verse states: <b>“My son, fear the Lord and the king; and meddle not with those who are repeating”</b> (Proverbs 24:21). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: These are</b> individuals <b>who repeatedly learn</b> the <b><i>halakhot</i></b> but do not know the reasons behind them. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> that <b>obvious?</b> How else could the verse be understood? The Gemara answers: He states this <b>lest you say</b> that the verse is referring to individuals who <b>repeatedly</b> commit <b>sins, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the words of <b>Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says: Once a person committed a transgression and repeated it,</b> in his eyes <b>it became permitted for him.</b> Since the verse could be interpreted in this manner, Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>teaches us</b> that the verse is referring to those who learn without understanding.

### Part 7
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> who recite the tannaitic sources by rote, <b>are</b> individuals <b>who erode the world.</b> The Gemara is puzzled by this statement: <b>Could</b> it <b>enter your mind</b> that they are individuals <b>who erode the world? Ravina says:</b> This statement is referring to those <b>who issue halakhic rulings based</b> on <b>their</b> knowledge of <b><i>mishnayot</i>. This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: Are they</b> individuals <b>who erode the world? Aren’t they settling the world, as it is stated: “His ways [<i>halikhot</i>] are eternal”</b> (Habakkuk 3:6)? The Sages read the term <i>halikhot</i> as <i>halakhot</i>, inferring that one who learns <i>halakhot</i> attains eternal life. <b>Rather,</b> this is referring to those <b>who issue halakhic rulings based</b> on <b>their</b> knowledge of <b><i>mishnayot</i>.</b>

### Part 8
§ The mishna states that <b>an abstinent woman</b> is among those who erode the world. <b>The Sages taught: A maiden who prays</b> constantly, <b>and a neighborly [<i>shovavit</i>] widow</b> who constantly visits her neighbors, <b>and a child whose months</b> of gestation <b>were not completed,</b> all <b>these are</b> people <b>who erode the world.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: We learned</b> the meaning of <b>fear of sin from a maiden, and</b> the significance of <b>receiving</b> divine <b>reward from a widow.</b> The meaning of <b>fear of sin</b> can be learned <b>from a maiden, as Rabbi Yoḥanan heard a certain maiden who fell on her face</b> in prayer, <b>and she was saying: Master of the Universe, You created the Garden of Eden and You created Gehenna, You created</b> the <b>righteous and You created</b> the <b>wicked. May it be Your will that men shall not stumble because of me</b> and consequently go to Gehenna.

### Part 10
The significance of <b>receiving</b> divine <b>reward</b> can be learned <b>from a widow, as</b> there was <b>a certain widow in whose neighborhood there was a synagogue,</b> and despite this <b>every day she went and prayed in the study hall of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to her: My daughter,</b> is there <b>not a synagogue in your neighborhood? She said to him: My teacher, don’t I attain a reward</b> for all <b>the steps</b> I take while walking to pray in the distant study hall?

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>When it is stated</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that a maiden who prays constantly is one who erodes the world, it is referring, <b>for example,</b> to <b>Yoḥani bat Retivi,</b> who constantly prayed and pretended to be saintly but actually engaged in sorcery.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>a child whose months</b> of gestation <b>were not completed? Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they interpreted this</b> as alluding to an imperfect, incomplete <b>Torah scholar who scorns his teachers.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Abba says: This is a student who has not</b> yet <b>attained</b> the ability <b>to issue</b> halakhic <b>rulings, and</b> yet <b>he issues rulings</b> and is therefore compared to a prematurely born child. This is <b>as Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For she has cast down many wounded; and a mighty host are all her slain”</b> (Proverbs 7:26)? <b>“For she has cast down [<i>hippila</i>] many wounded”; this</b> is referring to <b>a Torah scholar who has not</b> yet <b>attained</b> the ability <b>to issue rulings, and</b> yet <b>he issues rulings. “And a mighty host [<i>ve’atzumim</i>] are all her slain”; this</b> is referring to <b>a Torah scholar who has attained</b> the ability <b>to issue rulings, but does not issue rulings</b> and prevents the masses from learning Torah properly.
