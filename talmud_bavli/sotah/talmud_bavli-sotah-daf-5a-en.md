### Part 1
<b>Even</b> if the one who committed adultery <b>performs charitable</b> deeds <b>secretly,</b> as alluded to in the phrase “hand to hand,” and even if one might think that one who does so will go unpunished, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to charity of this kind: <b>“A gift in secret pacifies wrath”</b> (Proverbs 21:14), nevertheless, <b>he will not be unpunished from the judgment of Gehenna.</b>

### Part 2
§ The Gemara previously discussed the impropriety of the trait of arrogance. Now the Gemara discusses the source of its prohibition. <b>From where is the warning</b> derived, i.e., what is the source prohibiting the behavior <b>of the arrogant? Rava says</b> that <b>Ze’eiri says:</b> The source is from the verse: <b>“Hear, you, and give ear, be not proud,</b> for the Lord has spoken” (Jeremiah 13:15). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> the warning is <b>from here: “Then your heart be lifted up, and you forget</b> the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 8:14), <b>and it is</b> also <b>written</b> in that same passage: <b>“Beware lest you forget the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:11).

### Part 3
The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> these sources are <b>in accordance with</b> a statement <b>that Rabbi Avin</b> says that <b>Rabbi Ile’a says, as Rabbi Avin says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ile’a says: Wherever it is stated</b> in a verse <b>“beware,” “lest,” or “not,”</b> this is <b>nothing other</b> than <b>a prohibition.</b> Since these verses employ these terms in the context of one who is arrogant, they serve as sources for the prohibition.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Avira interpreted</b> the following verse <b>homiletically:</b> “They are exalted for a little while, and they are gone; yes, they are brought low, they are gathered in as all others, and wither as the tops of the husks” (Job 24:24). There were <b>times</b> when <b>he said this</b> interpretation <b>in the name of Rav Asi and</b> there were <b>times</b> when <b>he said it in the name of Rav Ami: Any person who has arrogance within him will ultimately be diminished</b> in standing, <b>as it is stated</b> in the phrase: <b>“They are exalted for a little while,”</b> indicating that one who raises himself above others will be exalted only briefly. <b>And lest you say that</b> even if he is diminished <b>he</b> will still <b>exist in this world</b> and live a full life, <b>the verse states: “And they are gone,”</b> indicating that they die before their time.

### Part 5
He continues the interpretation: <b>But if he repents from</b> his arrogance, <b>he is gathered</b> in death <b>at his proper time like Abraham our forefather, as it is stated: “Yes, they are brought low, they are gathered in as all [<i>kakkol</i>] others”</b> (Job 24:24), indicating that when he repents from his arrogance he will die <b>like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as it is written about them</b> that they were blessed with the term “all,” as in the verse above. With regard to Abraham, the verse states: “And the Lord had blessed Abraham <b>in all</b> things <b>[<i>bakkol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 24:1). With regard to Isaac, the verse states: “And I have eaten <b>of all [<i>mikkol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 27:33). With regard to Jacob, the verse states: “And because I have <b>all [<i>khol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 33:11). <b>And if</b> one does <b>not</b> repent, then, the verse in Job continues: <b>“And wither like the tops of the husk.”</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“and</b> wither <b>like the tops of the husks”? Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda</b> offered differing interpretations. <b>One says</b> that it means: <b>Like the awn</b> of bristle-like growth on the top <b>of the husk, and one says</b> that it means: <b>Like the husk itself.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to the one who says: Like the awn</b> of bristle-like growth on the top <b>of the husk, that is that which is written</b> in the verse: <b>“And</b> wither <b>like the tops of the husks,”</b> since this awn is on the top of the husk. <b>But according to the one who says: Like the husk itself, what</b> is the meaning of the expression <b>“and</b> wither <b>like the tops of the husks”? Rav Asi says, and similarly the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> This can be explained by way of <b>an analogy to a person who enters into his field,</b> as <b>he gathers the taller</b> stalks before the shorter ones. The verse is therefore referring to the tallest stalks, not the tops of the stalks.

### Part 7
The Gemara continues the discussion of arrogance, and its converse, humility. The verse states: “For thus says the High and Lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, <b>also with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit,</b> to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones” (Isaiah 57:15). <b>Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda</b> offered differing interpretations of this verse. <b>One says</b> that the verse means: Together <b>with Me</b> is the person who is <b>contrite</b> and humble. In other words, God elevates the humble. <b>And one says</b> that the verse means: <b>I,</b> God, descend, and am found together <b>with</b> the person who is <b>contrite</b> and humble.

### Part 8
The Gemara comments on this: <b>And</b> it <b>stands to reason</b> that the meaning of the verse is <b>like the one who says: I</b> am <b>with</b> the <b>contrite</b> person, <b>as the Holy One, Blessed be He, disregarded all</b> of the <b>mountains and hills, and rested His Divine Presence on</b> the lowly <b>Mount Sinai, and</b> He <b>did not</b> choose to <b>raise Mount Sinai up</b> toward Him. God chose to give the Torah on Mount Sinai, as it was a symbol of humility due to its lack of height, and He lowered His Divine Presence, as it were, to the mountain.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Yosef says: A person should always learn</b> proper behavior <b>from the wisdom of his Creator, as the Holy One, Blessed be He, disregarded all</b> of the <b>mountains and hills and rested His Divine Presence on the</b> lowly <b>Mount Sinai. And</b> similarly, when appearing to Moses, <b>He disregarded all</b> of the <b>beautiful trees and rested His Divine Presence on the bush</b> (Exodus 3:2).

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> Concerning <b>any person who has arrogance within him,</b> it is <b>fitting to hew him down, as a tree designated for idolatry [<i>asheira</i>]</b> is hewn down, as <b>it is written here</b> with regard to the arrogant: <b>“And the high ones of stature shall be hewn down [<i>gedu’im</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 10:33), <b>and it is written there</b> with regard to trees designated for idolatry: <b>“And hew down [<i>teggade’un</i>] their trees worshipped as part of idolatrous rites [<i>asheireihem</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:5).

### Part 11
<b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> also <b>says:</b> Concerning <b>any person who has arrogance within him, his dust,</b> i.e., his remains in his grave, <b>will not stir</b> at the time of the resurrection of the dead, <b>as it is stated: “Awake and sing for joy, you who dwell in the dust”</b> (Isaiah 26:19). <b>It is not stated: You who lie in the dust,</b> which would indicate that all the dead will be awakened in the future, <b>but rather: “You who dwell in the dust,”</b> indicating that only <b>one who became a neighbor to the dust in his lifetime</b> by living with extreme humility will stir at the time of the resurrection.

### Part 12
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> Concerning <b>any person who has arrogance within him, the Divine Presence wails over him. As it is stated:</b> “For though the Lord is high, yet regards He the lowly, <b>and from the haughty He is pained from afar”</b> (Psalms 138:6).

### Part 13
<b>Rav Avira interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> interpreted as follows: <b>Come and see that the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is not like the attribute of flesh and blood. The attribute of flesh and blood</b> is that the <b>elevated sees the elevated, but the elevated does not see the lowly. But the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is not</b> like <b>that. He is elevated but sees</b> specifically <b>the lowly, as it is stated: “For though the Lord is high, yet regards He the lowly”</b> (Psalms 138:6).

### Part 14
<b>Rav Ḥisda says, and some say</b> that <b>Mar Ukva</b> says: Concerning <b>any person who has arrogance within him, the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: He and I cannot dwell</b> together <b>in the world, as it is stated: “He who slanders his neighbor in secret, him will I destroy; he who is haughty of eye and proud of heart, him will I not suffer [<i>oto lo ukhal</i>]”</b> (Psalms 101:5–6). These verses should be understood as follows: <b>Do not read</b> the verse as: <b>“<i>Oto</i></b> <i>lo ukhal</i>”; <b>rather,</b> read it as: <b><i>Itto lo ukhal</i>,</b> meaning, <b>with him, I cannot</b> bear to dwell. <b>There are</b> those <b>who teach</b> that <b>this</b> was stated <b>with regard to those who speak slander</b> because the beginning of the verse states: <b>“He who slanders his neighbor in secret, him will I destroy.”</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Alexandri says:</b> Concerning <b>any person who has arrogance within him, even a slight wind disturbs him, as it is stated: “But the wicked are like the troubled sea,</b> for it cannot rest” (Isaiah 57:20). <b>And if</b> with regard to the <b>sea,</b> which <b>contains many</b> quantities of <b>quarters</b> of a <i>log</i> of water, yet <b>a slight wind disturbs it,</b> certainly with regard to <b>a person, who has</b> in his body <b>only one quarter-<i>log</i></b> of essential lifeblood, <b>all the more so</b> will a slight wind disturb him.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> Despite the opprobrium assigned to one who exhibits the trait of arrogance, <b>a Torah scholar must have one-eighth of one-eighth</b> of arrogance. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: And</b> this minute measure of arrogance <b>crowns him as the awn</b> of bristle-like growth on the top <b>of the husk. Rava said:</b> A Torah scholar <b>who has</b> arrogance <b>should be excommunicated, and one who does not have</b> arrogance at all <b>should be excommunicated</b> as well. As such, he must have only a minute measure of arrogance.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Even a Torah scholar <b>should not have any</b> arrogance <b>or any part of</b> arrogance, i.e., not even one-eighth of one-eighth. He explains why arrogance should be avoided entirely by asking: <b>Is it a small</b> matter <b>that it is written with regard to</b> arrogance: <b>“Everyone that is proud of heart is an abomination to the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 16:5)?

### Part 18
<b>Ḥizkiyya says: The prayers of a person are heard only if he casts his heart</b> to be <b>like flesh,</b> by being free of arrogance. <b>As it is stated: “And it shall come to pass, that from one New Moon to another,</b> and from one Sabbath to another, <b>shall all flesh come to worship</b> before Me, says the Lord” (Isaiah 66:23).

### Part 19
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Concerning leprosy of the <b>flesh, it is written</b> in the verse <b>with regard to it:</b> “And when the flesh has in the skin thereof a boil, <b>and it is healed”</b> (Leviticus 13:18), but concerning the leprosy of <b>a person, it is not written</b> in the verse <b>with regard to it: And it is healed.</b> Both verses discussing leprosy of a person make no mention of healing (Leviticus 13:2, 13:9). This indicates that one who sees himself as flesh will be cured, but one who holds himself in high regard will not be cured.

### Part 20
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The Hebrew word for person, <i>adam</i>, written: <b><i>Alef</i>, <i>dalet</i>, <i>mem</i>,</b> is an acronym for <b><i>efer</i>,</b> dust; <b><i>dam</i>,</b> blood; and <b><i>mara</i>,</b> bile, alluding to man’s insignificance. Similarly, the Hebrew word for flesh, <i>basar</i>, written: <b><i>Beit</i>, <i>sin</i>, <i>reish</i>,</b> is an acronym for <b><i>busha</i>,</b> shame; <b><i>seruḥa</i>,</b> putrid; and <b><i>rimma</i>,</b> worm, also alluding to his insignificance. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the letter <i>sin</i> of the word <i>basar</i> actually is referring to a different word, <b><i>sheol</i>, the netherworld, as it is written with</b> the Hebrew letter <b><i>shin</i>.</b> The letter <i>sin</i> is phonetically similar to the letter <i>samekh</i>, the first letter of the word <i>seruḥa</i>, but is orthographically similar to the letter <i>shin</i>, the first letter of the word <i>sheol</i>. The dispute is whether the acronym should be based upon the pronunciation or upon the way it is written.

### Part 21
<b>Rav Ashi says: Any person who has arrogance within him will ultimately be diminished</b> in stature, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to different types of leprosy:
