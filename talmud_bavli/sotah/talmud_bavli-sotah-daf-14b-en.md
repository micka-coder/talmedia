### Part 1
that the priest would first <b>give</b> her the water of the <i>sota</i> <b>to drink, and</b> only <b>afterward</b> would he <b>sacrifice her meal-offering.</b> Therefore, <b>if</b> the concern were <b>due to the scroll,</b> it would no longer be applicable, as <b>it was</b> already <b>erased</b> in the water of the <i>sota</i> before the meal-offering was brought. The efforts to fatigue her by making her hold the meal-offering must indicate that the Torah is protective of her.

### Part 2
It was taught in the mishna: <b>All meal-offerings,</b> from their beginning until their end, are placed in service vessels and remain there. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Menaḥot</i> 1:16): <b>What is the procedure for meal-offerings? A person brings his meal-offering from his property in baskets [<i>kelatot</i>] of silver and of gold, and</b> when he reaches the Temple <b>he places it in a service vessel and sanctifies it in</b> the <b>service vessel, and he puts its oil and frankincense on it, and he carries it to the priest. And the priest</b> then <b>carries it to the altar and brings it near to the southwest horn</b> of the altar, <b>opposite the corner of the horn</b> of the altar. <b>And</b> this <b>is sufficient.</b>

### Part 3
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> the priest then <b>removes the frankincense to one side, and he removes a handful from the place where its oil has accumulated</b> and mixed with the flour, <b>and he puts</b> the handful <b>into a service vessel and consecrates it in</b> the <b>service vessel. And he</b> then <b>gathers its frankincense and puts it on top of</b> the handful <b>and brings it up onto the altar. And he brings it up and burns it in</b> the <b>service vessel; and he salts it and places it upon the fires.</b>

### Part 4
The <i>baraita</i> continues: After <b>the handful is sacrificed, the remainders of</b> the meal-offering <b>are eaten. And the priests are permitted to put wine and oil and honey in it,</b> even though it is prohibited to offer honey on the altar. <b>And they are prohibited only from allowing</b> the meal-offering <b>to become leavened.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that the meal-offering is first placed <b>in baskets of silver and baskets of gold</b> brought from one’s home. This seems to contradict the mishna’s statement that all other meal-offerings are initially in service vessels. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The mishna means to <b>say</b> that meal-offerings are placed <b>in vessels</b> of silver and gold, as <b>these are suitable to be service vessels</b> if consecrated.

### Part 6
The Gemara notes: Since the mishna distinguishes in this regard between the meal-offering of the <i>sota</i> and all other meal-offerings, one may learn <b>by inference that an Egyptian wicker basket is not suitable</b> to be a service vessel even if it is consecrated. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this the case? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>service vessels that were made of wood, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems them unfit, and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, deems them fit.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara responds: <b>You</b> can <b>even say that</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda. Say that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says</b> that wooden vessels are deemed fit <b>with regard to</b> those of <b>superior</b> quality; but <b>does he say</b> likewise <b>with regard to</b> vessels of <b>lesser</b> quality, e.g., a basket made of palm branches? <b>Doesn’t Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, hold</b> to the principle articulated in the verse: “And when you offer the blind for a sacrifice, is it not evil! …If you would <b>present it now unto your governor,</b> will he be pleased with you or show you favor?” (Malachi 1:8)? Nothing that is unfit for presentation to a ruler may be brought to the Temple. Therefore, even Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, must agree that a basket made of palm branches cannot be a service vessel.

### Part 8
§ The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>He places it in a service vessel and sanctifies it in</b> the <b>service vessel.</b> The Gemara asks: Can one <b>learn from</b> the unnecessary repetition of the term service vessel, that <b>service vessels can sanctify</b> their contents <b>only with intention?</b> Must one place the meal-offering in the service vessel with express intent to sanctify it? The Gemara answers: <b>Say: He</b> simply <b>places it in the service vessel</b> in order <b>to sanctify it in the service vessel.</b> He need not to intend to sanctify it.

### Part 9
§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches: The owner of the meal-offering <b>puts its oil and frankincense on it.</b> The Gemara cites the source of this <i>halakha</i>: <b>As it is stated:</b> “And when anyone brings a meal-offering unto the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour; <b>and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon”</b> (Leviticus 2:1).

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And he carries it to the priest.</b> The Gemara cites the source: <b>As it is written: “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons,</b> the priests” (Leviticus 2:2).

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And the priest</b> then <b>carries it to the altar.</b> The Gemara cites the source: <b>As it is written:</b> “And you shall bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto the Lord; and it shall be presented unto the priest, <b>and he shall bring it unto the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8).

### Part 12
The <i>baraita</i> states: The priest <b>brings it near to the southwest horn</b> of the altar, <b>opposite the corner of the horn. And</b> this <b>is sufficient.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this?

### Part 13
The Gemara responds: <b>As it is written: “And this is the law of the meal-offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord in front of the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:7). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“Before the Lord,”</b> one <b>might</b> have understood this to mean <b>on the western side</b> of the altar, opposite the Holy of Holies. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In front of the altar.”</b> This must be the south of the altar, where the ramp is located. <b>If</b> the verse had stated only: <b>In front of the altar,</b> one <b>might</b> have understood it to mean specifically <b>on the southern side.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Before the Lord,”</b> indicating the western side. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? The priest <b>brings it near to the southwest corner</b> of the altar, <b>opposite the corner of the horn. And</b> this <b>is sufficient.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> another interpretation: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he offers it up on the western side of the corner or on the southern side of the corner. Say: Anywhere you find two verses, one</b> of which <b>fulfills itself and fulfills the statement of the other, and one</b> of which <b>fulfills itself and nullifies the statement of the other, leave</b> the verse <b>that fulfills itself and nullifies the other, and seize the one that fulfills itself and fulfills the other.</b> The principle is applied as follows: <b>When you say: “Before the Lord,” on the western side, you have nullified</b> the other part of the verse: <b>“In front of the altar,” on the southern side. But when you say: “In front of the altar,” on the southern side, you have</b> also <b>fulfilled: “Before the Lord,” on the western side. How so? He brings it near to the southern side of the corner.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>But where have you fulfilled</b> the phrase “before the Lord”? <b>Rav Ashi said: This <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>the entire altar stands in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard. Therefore, the entire southern side of the altar stood opposite the Holy of Holies in the west, and it can therefore be called: Before the Lord.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is taught by the phrase: <b>And</b> this <b>is sufficient? Rav Ashi said:</b> This phrase <b>was necessary,</b> as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say: Require</b> the priest <b>to bring the meal-offering itself near</b> to the corner of the altar without the use of a vessel. The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so, and one can bring it to the altar in its service vessel.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that this is <b>indeed</b> so? The Gemara responds: <b>The verse states:</b> “And you shall bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto the Lord; <b>and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8); <b>just as presentation to the priest is in a vessel, so too bringing</b> it <b>to the altar</b> must be <b>in a vessel.</b>

### Part 18
The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And he removes its frankincense to one side.</b> The Gemara explains: This is done <b>in order that</b> the frankincense <b>not be removed along with the meal-offering</b> when the priest removes a handful. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 6a): If he <b>removed</b> the <b>handful and a pebble, or a grain of salt, or a crumb [<i>koret</i>] of frankincense came out in his hand, it is invalid.</b> The handful must be entirely fine flour.

### Part 19
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And he removes a handful from the place where its oil has accumulated.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written:</b> “And he shall take from there his handful <b>of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). The Torah also states: “And the priest shall make the memorial part of it smoke, even <b>of the groats thereof, and of the oil thereof”</b> (Leviticus 2:16). The handful should be taken from the area where there is an abundance of oil.

### Part 20
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And he puts</b> the handful <b>into a service vessel and sanctifies it in</b> the <b>service vessel.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need this sanctification? <b>He has</b> already <b>sanctified it once,</b> when he initially brought it to the Temple. The Gemara responds: The sanctification here is <b>just as with</b> the <b>blood</b> of the offerings. <b>Although the knife sanctifies blood</b> by contact with <b>the neck of the animal,</b> since the knife itself is a service vessel, the priest <b>sanctifies it again</b> when he collects it <b>in the service vessel. Here too, it is not different;</b> the meal-offering must be sanctified twice.

### Part 21
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And he gathers its frankincense and puts it on top of</b> the handful. The Gemara cites the source: <b>As it is written:</b> “And he shall take up from his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of the oil thereof, <b>and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:8).

### Part 22
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And he</b> then <b>brings it up</b>
