### Part 1
<b>And Beit Hillel hold</b> that a promissory <b>note that stands to be collected is not considered as</b> though it was already <b>collected.</b> Therefore, the payment of the marriage contract is not considered to be in the wife’s possession, and as this means that she is the claimant, she is not entitled to the money unless she proves that she did not commit adultery.

### Part 2
§ The mishna states (24a): <b>A woman who was pregnant</b> with the child <b>of another</b> man at the time of her marriage…A sexually underdeveloped woman, who is incapable of bearing children [<i>ailonit</i>], and an elderly woman, and a woman who is incapable of giving birth for other reasons, neither collect payment of their marriage contracts nor drink the bitter water. Rabbi Elazar says: He can marry another woman and procreate through her; therefore these are considered permitted marriages, and the women can drink the bitter water. <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Elazar is only <b>in</b> the case of <b>a barren woman and an elderly woman.</b>

### Part 3
<b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a sexually underdeveloped woman, all agree</b> that <b>she neither drinks</b> the bitter water <b>nor collects</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract.</b> This is <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i> who is found to be innocent of adultery: <b>“And she shall be cleared, and shall conceive seed”</b> (Numbers 5:28), indicating that the <i>sota</i> ritual pertains only to <b>one whose way is to bear seed</b> and give birth, <b>excluding this</b> sexually underdeveloped woman, <b>whose way is not to bear seed.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Naḥman’s statement from a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (5:4): With regard to <b>one who issues a warning to his betrothed, or to his</b> <i>yevama</i> while she is a <b>widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i>, if she secluded herself</b> with the other man <b>before</b> her husband <b>consummated</b> the marriage, <b>she neither drinks</b> the bitter water <b>nor collects</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract.</b>
