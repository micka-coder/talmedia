### Part 1
By contrast, the mishna states that the leper must be shaven <b>like a gourd.</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who interprets</b> verses by means of the principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the verse: <b>“And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave off all his hair,”</b> the phrase “all his hair” is an <b>amplification.</b> The phrase that follows: <b>“His head and his beard and his eyebrows,”</b> is a <b>restriction.</b> In the final phrase: <b>“Even all his hair he shall shave off,”</b> the verse <b>then amplified</b> again. The verse is therefore an instance of <b>amplification and restriction and amplification,</b> which <b>includes everything.</b>

### Part 2
<b>What does it include? It includes</b> the hair <b>of all of the body. What does it</b> nevertheless <b>exclude? It excludes nose hairs,</b> which do not need to be shaved. Since the mishna presents only the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, it poses no challenge to Rabbi Yishmael’s list.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about it,</b> i.e., whether ashes may be used instead of dust for the water of the <i>sota</i>? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> evidence from that <b>which Rav Huna bar Ashi says</b> that <b>Rav says: If there is no dust</b> available for the <i>sota</i> water, the priest <b>brings decomposed vegetable</b> matter, <b>and he consecrates</b> the water with it. This indicates that it is permitted to substitute other substances for dust.

### Part 4
The Gemara responds: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so. Decomposed vegetable</b> matter <b>is</b> permitted because it will <b>become dust,</b> but <b>ashes will not become dust.</b>

### Part 5
§ The mishna states: He would take loose dust from underneath the tablet and place it into the vessel with the water, <b>so that</b> the dust <b>would be visible upon the water. The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:8): <b>Three</b> items <b>are required to be seen: The dust of the <i>sota</i></b> must be visible in the water, <b>the ashes of the</b> red <b>heifer</b> must be visible when placed in the waters of purification, <b>and the spittle of a woman whose husband, who has a brother, died childless [<i>yevama</i>]</b> must be visible. The <i>yavam</i>, brother-in-law of the <i>yevama</i>, is bound by Torah law to marry her, and this bond is dissolved through the ritual of <i>ḥalitza</i>, in which she spits before him in the presence of judges. <b>In the name of Rabbi Yishmael they said: Even the blood of the bird</b> used in a leper’s purification ritual is required to be visible in the vessel.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yishmael? As it is written</b> with regard to the process of the purification of a leper: “And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, <b>and dip them in the blood of the slain bird,</b> and in the running water” (Leviticus 14:51). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Had the verse stated only the phrase <b>“in the blood,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that these items must be dipped only <b>in</b> the <b>blood and</b> should <b>not</b> be dipped <b>in</b> the <b>water</b> at all. Therefore, <b>the verse</b> also <b>states: “In the</b> running <b>water.” If</b> the verse had stated only the phrase “in the running <b>water,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought they should be dipped only <b>in</b> the <b>water and not</b> be dipped <b>in</b> the <b>blood</b> at all. Therefore, <b>the verse</b> also <b>states: “In the blood.” How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? One must <b>bring</b> little enough <b>water</b> so <b>that the blood of the bird</b> will still <b>be recognizable within it. And how much</b> water is this? It is <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i>.

### Part 7
<b>And the Rabbis,</b> who do not require that the blood of the bird be visible in the water, how do they understand the verse? <b>That</b> verse is necessary <b>for its own</b> sake, <b>as this is what the Merciful One is saying: Dip</b> the objects both <b>in blood and in water</b> together. The blood need not be visible.

### Part 8
<b>And</b> why does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> reject this straightforward understanding of the verse? It is because <b>if</b> this understanding were <b>so,</b> then <b>the Merciful One should have written</b> simply: <b>And dip in them,</b> i.e., dip the cedar wood, hyssop, scarlet wool, and live bird in the blood and water, as the blood and water have already been mentioned beforehand. <b>Why do I</b> need the verse to list explicitly: “And dip them <b>in the blood</b> of the slain bird, <b>and in the</b> running <b>water”?</b> This is <b>to</b> teach that the blood must be <b>recognizable</b> in the water.

### Part 9
<b>And</b> what would <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this? <b>If the Merciful One had written</b> simply: <b>And dip in them,</b> then <b>I would say</b> the items should be dipped in <b>this</b> liquid <b>separately and</b> in <b>that</b> liquid <b>separately.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes:</b> “And dip them <b>in the blood</b> of the slain bird, <b>and in the</b> running <b>water,” to</b> teach that one must <b>mix them</b> together.

### Part 10
<b>And</b> from where does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> derive that one must <b>mix them</b> together? <b>Another verse is written: “And he shall slaughter one of the birds</b> in an earthen vessel over running water” (Leviticus 14:50). This indicates that the blood of the bird must fall directly into the water below, and the blood and the water will become mixed together.

### Part 11
<b>And</b> why do <b>the Rabbis</b> not learn it from that verse? <b>If</b> one were to learn it <b>from that</b> verse, <b>I would say</b> that one should <b>slaughter</b> the bird <b>adjacent to the vessel</b> holding the water, <b>and</b> one should <b>grasp the</b> opened <b>veins</b> to ensure that no blood escapes immediately <b>and</b> then <b>collect the blood in a different vessel.</b> The blood and water would therefore be in separate vessels. Therefore, <b>this</b> first verse <b>teaches us</b> that the blood and water must be mixed together.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma before Rabbi Zeira:</b> If the bird is <b>big and</b> contains such a large amount of blood that it <b>effaces the water,</b> rendering it indistinguishable, or if the bird is <b>small and</b> contains so little blood that its blood <b>is effaced due to the water</b> and indistinguishable, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 13
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Haven’t I told you not to take yourself out</b> of the bounds <b>of the</b> practical <b><i>halakha</i>?</b> Do not ask questions about impossible eventualities. <b>The Sages measured</b> the ratio of blood to water specifically <b>with regard to a sparrow. There is no</b> sparrow <b>big enough to efface the water, nor is there one small enough to be effaced due to the water.</b>

### Part 14
§ <b>The Rabbis taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Para</i> 6:6): If one <b>places the dust</b> in the vessel <b>before the water,</b> the mixture is <b>unfit; but Rabbi Shimon deems it fit.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon?</b>

### Part 15
It is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the red heifer: <b>“And for the unclean they shall take of the dust of the burning of the purification from sin,</b> and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel” (Numbers 19:17). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon said: Is it dust [<i>afar</i>]</b> that is taken? <b>But isn’t it</b> really <b>ashes [<i>efer</i>]?</b> Evidently <b>the Torah altered its usage</b> and referred to ashes as dust <b>in order to derive a verbal analogy from it. Dust is stated</b> in the verse <b>here, and dust is stated there,</b> with regard to the <i>sota</i>. <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the <i>sota</i>, the verse teaches that the <b>dust</b> must be placed <b>on top of water, so too here,</b> with regard to the red heifer, one learns that the <b>dust,</b> i.e., ashes, must be placed <b>on top of the water.</b>

### Part 16
<b>And</b> likewise, <b>just as here,</b> with regard to the red heifer, if one <b>places the dust</b> in the vessel <b>before the water, it is fit</b> after the fact, <b>so too there,</b> with regard to the <i>sota</i>, if one <b>places the dust</b> in the vessel <b>before the water, it is fit.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to the red heifer, <b>from where do we</b> derive that the mixture is fit even if the dust is placed first? <b>Two phrases are written</b> in the verse. <b>It is written</b> that the water must be put: <b>“Thereto.”</b> Therefore, <b>apparently,</b> the <b>ashes</b> should be placed <b>first. And it is written</b> that the <b>running water</b> must be placed: <b>“In a vessel.” Apparently,</b> the <b>water</b> should be placed in the vessel <b>first,</b> while it is still empty. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? If <b>he desires</b> to place the water first <b>he places it,</b> and if <b>he desires</b> to place the ash first <b>he places it.</b>

### Part 18
<b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis,</b> who deem the mixture unfit, interpret the verse? The verse states: <b>“In a vessel,” specifically.</b> The water must be placed first. When the verse states: <b>“Thereto,”</b> it teaches only that it is required <b>to mix</b> the ashes with the water.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one could just as easily <b>say</b> the opposite: <b>“Thereto”</b> should be understood <b>specifically,</b> and the ashes must be placed first. The phrase “running water shall be put…<b>in a vessel,”</b> should indicate only <b>that</b> the water <b>must run</b> directly <b>into the vessel</b> and that it may not be brought from the spring by means of another vessel.

### Part 20
The Gemara answers: <b>Just as we find in every instance</b> that the <b>facilitating item</b> goes <b>above</b> the primary item, e.g., in the case of a <i>sota</i> the dust goes on top of the water, <b>so too here,</b> in the case of the red heifer, the <b>facilitating item</b> must go <b>above</b> the primary item. The water must be placed first, and only then the ashes.
