### Part 1
<b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that the verse serves to render it prohibited for a priest to become impure to bury a limb, then <b>let the Merciful One write:</b> “And for his sister a virgin, that is near to him, that has had no husband, <b>for her,” and</b> then <b>be silent. Why do I</b> need the verse to write: <b>“May he become impure”? Learn from</b> the additional phrase that making himself impure is mandatory.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> explain the additional phrase? <b>Since</b> the verse <b>wrote: “For her,”</b> it <b>also wrote: “May he become impure,” for</b> the same reason <b>as was taught by the school of Rabbi Yishmael. As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Every passage</b> in the Torah <b>that was stated and repeated, was repeated only for the novel element introduced therein.</b> Therefore, it is possible that the verse serves to teach the <i>halakha</i> that a priest may not become impure in order to bury a limb, and that would account for the repetition of the phrase “may he become impure” as well.

### Part 3
The Gemara discusses the third dispute between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva. The verse states: <b>“Of them may you take your bondmen forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), i.e., the <i>halakha</i> that one keeps his Canaanite slave forever, is <b>optional;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b> One is not enjoined against emancipating a Canaanite slave, but one is permitted to keep a Canaanite slave forever. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is <b>mandatory,</b> and one is prohibited from freeing his Canaanite slave.

### Part 4
<b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yishmael? Since it is written</b> with regard to Canaanites: <b>“You shall save alive nothing that breathes”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:16), <b>it was necessary to write: “Of them may you take your bondmen forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46), <b>as well,</b> in order <b>to permit one from any of the</b> other, non-Canaanite <b>nations who engaged in sexual intercourse with a Canaanite woman and she bore him a child.</b> This verse teaches <b>that you are permitted to purchase</b> the child as a slave, as he is not included in the mitzva “You shall save alive nothing that breathes” that was stated with regard to full-fledged Canaanites. Therefore, this verse cannot be teaching that it is mandatory.

### Part 5
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one from</b> any of <b>the</b> other, non-Canaanite <b>nations who engaged in sexual intercourse with a Canaanite woman, and she bore him a child, that you are permitted to purchase</b> the child <b>as a slave? The verse states: “Moreover, of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them may you buy”</b> (Leviticus 25:45). This verse permits the purchase of slaves from among those individuals who are not members of the Canaanite nations, even if they settle in Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a Canaanite</b> man <b>who engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman from</b> one of <b>the</b> other <b>nations and she bore him a child, that you are permitted to purchase</b> the child <b>as a slave,</b> despite the fact that his father is a Canaanite. Therefore, <b>the</b> same <b>verse states: “Which they have given birth to in your land,”</b> teaching that one is permitted to purchase slaves only <b>from the</b> ones who are <b>born in your land</b> but whose paternal origins are from other lands, <b>but not from the</b> ones who already <b>reside in your land,</b> i.e., ones who have a Canaanite father.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: He <b>derives</b> it <b>from</b> the words in the same verse: <b>“Of them may you buy.”</b> Once the <i>halakha</i> is already taught that one may purchase as a slave the child of a Canaanite woman and a man from another nation, <b>why do I</b> need the verse to state: <b>“Of them may you take your bondmen forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46)? It is stated <b>to</b> teach that it is <b>mandatory</b> to enslave a Canaanite slave forever.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> derive from this verse? The Gemara answers: “Of them may you take your bondmen forever,” teaches that you can enslave <b>“of them,” but not of your brethren,</b> i.e., it is prohibited to enslave a fellow Jew, even a slave, forever.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: The prohibition against enslaving <b>your brethren is derived from the latter</b> phrase <b>of the verse,</b> where it is explicitly stated: <b>“But over your brethren the children of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with rigor”</b> (Leviticus 25:46).

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> derive from this verse? The Gemara answers: He holds that <b>since it is written: “But over your brethren,”</b> which explicitly states that it is prohibited to subjugate a Jew forever, <b>it also writes</b> with regard to Canaanites <b>“of them,”</b> but that phrase does not teach any novel <i>halakha</i>, <b>because of</b> the reason <b>that was taught by the school of Rabbi Yishmael. As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Every passage</b> in the Torah <b>that was stated and repeated, was repeated only for the novel element introduced therein.</b> Therefore, it is possible that the verse serves to teach the <i>halakha</i> that one may enslave a Canaanite forever, and that would account for the ostensibly superfluous phrase “of them.”

### Part 11
§ The Gemara discusses matters related to sin and sexual impropriety. <b>Rav Ḥisda says: Licentious</b> behavior <b>in a home</b> causes damage <b>like a worm [<i>karya</i>]</b> causes damage <b>to sesame [<i>shumeshema</i>]. And Rav Ḥisda says: Anger in a home</b> causes damage <b>like a worm</b> causes damage <b>to sesame.</b> The Gemara comments: Both <b>this and that,</b> i.e., that licentious behavior and anger destroy a home, were said <b>with regard to the woman</b> of the house, <b>but with regard to the man,</b> although these behaviors are improper, <b>we do not have</b> the same extreme consequences <b>with regard to it,</b> as the woman’s role in the home is more significant, resulting in a more detrimental result if she acts improperly.

### Part 12
<b>And Rav Ḥisda says: Initially, before the Jewish people sinned, the Divine Presence resided with each and every one</b> of them, <b>as it is stated: “For the Lord your God walks in the midst of your camp”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:15). <b>Once they sinned, the Divine Presence withdrew from them, as it is stated</b> in that same verse: <b>“That He see no unseemly matter in you, and turn away from you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:15), teaching that when there is an “unseemly matter” among the Jewish people, the Divine Presence no longer resides among them.

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Anyone who fulfills one mitzva in this world,</b> that mitzva <b>precedes him and goes before him to the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And your righteousness shall go before you,</b> the glory of the Lord shall be your reward” (Isaiah 58:8). <b>And anyone who commits one transgression in this world, it shrouds him and goes before him to the Day of Judgment, as it is stated: “The paths of their way do wind, they go up into the waste, and are lost”</b> (Job 6:18).

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The transgression <b>is chained to him</b> and accompanies him <b>like a dog, as it is stated</b> concerning Joseph’s refusal to commit adultery with the wife of Potiphar: <b>“That he listened not to her, to lie by her, or to be with her”</b> (Genesis 39:10), which is understood to mean: If he would agree <b>“to lie by her” in this world,</b> the result would be that he would have <b>“to be with her”</b> forever, as the transgression would accompany him <b>to the World-to-Come.</b>

### Part 15
§ The Gemara returns to its discussion of the number of witnesses necessary for different elements of the process of a woman becoming a <i>sota</i>. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (31a) with regard to the credibility of one witness who testifies concerning a woman’s infidelity: The <i>halakha</i> that one witness is deemed credible concerning defilement needs to be stated, <b>as, by right,</b> it <b>should</b> not <b>have been</b> deemed credible based on the following <i>a fortiori</i> inference:

### Part 16
<b>And just as</b> with regard to <b>the first testimony</b> concerning seclusion, <b>which does not forbid her</b> to her husband with <b>an irrevocable prohibition,</b> as the woman can be found innocent, permitting her again to her husband by drinking the bitter water, it <b>is not established with fewer than two</b> witnesses, as that mishna is written in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua, who stated (2a) that testimony of two witnesses must be provided by two witnesses, then with regard to <b>the final testimony</b> concerning defilement, <b>which forbids her</b> with <b>an irrevocable prohibition, is it not logical that it not be established with fewer than two</b> witnesses?

### Part 17
Therefore, to counter this derivation, <b>the verse states: “And there is no witness against her”</b> (Numbers 5:13), teaching that <b>any</b> testimony <b>that there is against her</b> with regard to her defilement is sufficient, and two witnesses are not required.

### Part 18
The mishna asks: <b>And now</b> that it is established that one witness suffices to testify with regard to defilement, <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference can be made <b>with regard to the first testimony</b> of seclusion: <b>And just as</b> with regard to <b>the final testimony</b> concerning defilement, <b>which forbids her</b> with <b>an irrevocable prohibition,</b> yet it <b>is established with one witness,</b> then with regard to <b>the first testimony, which does not forbid her</b> with <b>an irrevocable prohibition, is it not logical that it should be established with</b> only <b>one witness?</b>

### Part 19
Therefore, to counter this derivation, <b>the verse states:</b> “If a man marries a woman and lives with her and it will be that she not find favor in his eyes, <b>because he has found some unseemly matter [<i>davar</i>] about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and there,</b> in the verses concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of monetary matters, <b>it states: “By the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter [<i>davar</i>] be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15). This teaches that <b>just as</b> the <b>“matter” stated there</b> is established <b>by the mouth of two witnesses, so too here,</b> the “matter” of her seclusion must be established <b>by the mouth of two</b> witnesses.

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: Is <b>this</b> need for two witnesses <b>derived from: “Because he has found some unseemly matter about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1)? <b>It is derived from:</b> “And there is no witness [<i>ed</i>] <b>against her [<i>bah</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:13), which was explained to mean there were not two witnesses, but only one, who testified concerning her defilement (2a). The Gemara above (2b) derives from the term “<i>bah</i>,” which could also be understood as: <b>With regard to it,</b> that in this matter of defilement one witness suffices, <b>but not with regard to</b> the <b>warning.</b> And one also derives: <b>With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>seclusion.</b> Therefore, there must be two witnesses to testify about both the warning and the seclusion. The mishna <b>should have</b> given this inference as the source for requiring two witnesses for seclusion, and not the juxtaposition of “matter” and “matter.”

### Part 21
The Gemara answers: <b>That is also what he is saying.</b> The mishna should read: <b>The verse states:</b> “And there is no witness <b>against her [<i>bah</i>],”</b> teaching that: <b>With regard to it [<i>bah</i>], but not with regard to</b> the <b>warning.</b> And one also derives: <b>With regard to it, but not with regard to</b> the <b>seclusion.</b>

### Part 22
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>defilement in general, without</b> a prior <b>warning and without</b> witnesses to <b>seclusion, from where do we</b> derive <b>that one witness is not deemed credible? Here it is stated: “Because he has found some unseemly matter about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and there it is stated: “By the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15), teaching that <b>just as</b> the <b>“matter” stated there</b> is established by <b>two witnesses, so too here,</b> with regard to defilement it is established by <b>two witnesses.</b>

### Part 23
<b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:1): In the mishna quoted above, <b>which is the first testimony? This</b> is referring to the <b>testimony of seclusion.</b> Which is <b>the final testimony? This</b> is referring to the <b>testimony of defilement.</b>
