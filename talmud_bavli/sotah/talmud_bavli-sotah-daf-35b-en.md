### Part 1
<b>Who angered you,</b> i.e., the Ark, so much <b>that you became</b> so <b>angry</b> that you gave yourself into captivity? <b>And who came to you to appease you?</b>

### Part 2
The verse states: <b>“And He smote of the people seventy men, fifty thousand men”</b> (I Samuel 6:19). <b>Rabbi Abbahu and Rabbi Elazar</b> disagree over the interpretation of the verse. <b>One says</b> that <b>there were seventy men, and each and every one</b> of them <b>was equivalent to fifty thousand</b> men. <b>And one says</b> that <b>there were fifty thousand men, and each and every one was equivalent to</b> the <b>seventy</b> men in the <b>Sanhedrin.</b>

### Part 3
With regard to David’s journey with the Ark to Jerusalem, the verse states: <b>“And when they who carried the Ark of the Lord had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling”</b> (II Samuel 6:13). <b>And it is written</b> elsewhere that he sacrificed <b>“seven oxen and seven rams”</b> (I Chronicles 15:26). <b>Rav Pappa bar Shmuel says: For each and every step</b> David took, he sacrificed <b>an ox and a fatling,</b> and <b>for every six steps</b> that he took, he sacrificed <b>seven oxen and seven rams.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to him: If</b> that is <b>so,</b> and he sacrificed an offering for every step that he took, <b>you have filled all of Eretz Yisrael</b> with <b>altars,</b> as they had to build a new altar for each offering. <b>Rather, Rav Ḥisda said: For every six steps</b> he sacrificed <b>an ox and a fatling,</b> and <b>for every six sets of six steps</b> he sacrificed <b>seven oxen and seven rams.</b>

### Part 5
<b>It is written</b> that Uzzah died “when they came to the threshing floor of <b>Chidon”</b> (I Chronicles 13:9), <b>and</b> elsewhere <b>it is written</b> that it was “the threshing floor of <b>Nacon”</b> (II Samuel 6:6). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: At first</b> the Ark was similar to <b>a javelin [<i>kidon</i>],</b> as it caused Uzzah’s death. <b>But ultimately,</b> after the people asked for forgiveness, it was <b>established [<i>nakhon</i>],</b> i.e., placed, in the house of Obed Edom, where it was a source of blessing.

### Part 6
§ The Gemara returns to the discussion of how the Ark was brought into Eretz Yisrael. <b>You are found saying</b> that <b>there were three sets of stones. One</b> is a set <b>that Moses erected in the land of Moab, as it is stated: “Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses took upon himself to expound [<i>be’er</i>]</b> this law, saying” (Deuteronomy 1:5). <b>And it states there</b> with regard to the mitzva to erect the stones on Mount Ebal: <b>“And you shall write on the stones all the words of this law</b> clearly elucidated [<i>ba’er</i>]” (Deuteronomy 27:8). <b>It is derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the word <b>“<i>be’er</i>”</b> that appears with regard to Moses, and the word <b>“<i>ba’er</i>”</b> that appears with regard to the mitzva to write the Torah on the stones on Mount Ebal that Moses also wrote down the Torah on stones.

### Part 7
<b>And</b> there is <b>one</b> set <b>that Joshua erected in the Jordan, as it is stated: “Joshua also set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan,</b> in the place where the feet of the priests that bore the Ark of the Covenant stood, and they are there to this day” (Joshua 4:9). <b>And</b> there is <b>one</b> set <b>that</b> Joshua <b>erected in Gilgal, as it is stated: “And these twelve stones, which they took</b> out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal” (Joshua 4:20).

### Part 8
<b>The Sages taught: How did the Jewish people write the Torah? Rabbi Yehuda says: They wrote it on stones, as it is stated: “And you shall write on the stones all the words of this law”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:8). <b>And afterward they plastered them</b> over <b>with plaster.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Shimon said to him: According to your statement</b> that they plastered over the writing, <b>how did the nations of the world study Torah? He said to him: The Holy One, Blessed be He, granted them an extra</b> degree of <b>understanding, and they sent their scribes [<i>noteirin</i>], and they peeled off the plaster and copied it</b> down. <b>And on account of this matter their decree</b> to be sent <b>to the pit of destruction was sealed, as</b> once the Torah was in their possession <b>they should have studied</b> it, <b>and they did not study.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> That is not what happened. Rather, the Jewish people <b>wrote</b> the text of the Torah <b>on top of</b> the <b>plaster, and they wrote below for</b> the gentiles to read that the verse commands the Jewish people to destroy the gentile inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael: <b>“Lest they teach you to do like all</b> their abominations” (Deuteronomy 20:18). <b>You derive</b> from the fact that they wrote this verse <b>that if</b> the gentiles who lived in Eretz Israel <b>would have repented,</b> the Jews <b>would have accepted them,</b> i.e., allowed them to live in Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 11
<b>Rava bar Sheila said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon? As it is written: “And the peoples shall be as the burnings of plaster”</b> (Isaiah 33:12). This is homiletically interpreted to mean that the nations were punished <b>on account of matters of plaster,</b> i.e., they did not study the Torah that was written on plaster.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that the Torah was not written on plaster, interpret this verse? The Gemara answers: He explains that the gentiles are <b>like plaster; just as plaster has no remedy but burning,</b> i.e., it is created by burning stone, <b>so too, the nations of the world have no remedy other than burning</b> in Gehenna.

### Part 13
<b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and the Lord your God delivers them into your hands, <b>and you take them captive”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:10), implying that there is no obligation to destroy them, <b>to include</b> not only gentiles who are not Canaanites, but even <b>Canaanites that are</b> living <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>as, if they repent, they are accepted</b> and allowed to live in Eretz Yisrael.
