### Part 1
<b>as it is written</b> in the Torah, i.e., the Tetragrammaton, <b>and in the country</b> they use <b>its substitute name</b> of Lordship. <b>In the country, the priests lift their hands</b> so they are <b>aligned with their shoulders</b> during the benediction. <b>And in the Temple</b> they lift them <b>above their heads, except for the High Priest, who does not lift his hands above the frontplate.</b> Since the Tetragrammaton is inscribed on it, it is inappropriate for him to lift his hands above it. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even the High Priest lifts his hands above the frontplate, as it is stated: “And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them”</b> (Leviticus 9:22).

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> The mitzva given to the priests: <b>“So you shall bless</b> the children of Israel” (Numbers 6:23), is that they bless them <b>in the sacred tongue,</b> Hebrew. Do <b>you say</b> that the benediction must be recited <b>in the sacred tongue, or</b> perhaps it may be recited <b>in any language?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to the Priestly Benediction: <b>“So you shall bless,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the blessings and curses: <b>“These shall stand</b> on Mount Gerizim <b>to bless the people”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:12). There is a verbal analogy between these two usages of the word “bless”: <b>Just as there,</b> the blessings and curses were recited <b>in the sacred tongue,</b> as stated above (33a), <b>so too here,</b> the Priestly Benediction is recited <b>in the sacred tongue.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: It is not necessary</b> to derive this from a verbal analogy, as <b>it says</b> with regard to the Priestly Benediction: <b>“Thus,”</b> which means that it is not recited correctly <b>unless they recite it in this</b> exact <b>language,</b> as it is written in the Torah.

### Part 4
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“So you shall bless,”</b> means <b>while standing.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that the benediction must be recited <b>while standing, or</b> perhaps it may <b>even</b> be recited <b>while sitting? It is stated here: “So you shall bless,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the blessings and curses: <b>“These shall stand</b> on Mount Gerizim <b>to bless.” Just as there,</b> the blessing was recited <b>while standing, so too here,</b> the priests must recite the Priestly Benediction <b>while standing.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Natan says: It is not necessary</b> to derive this from a verbal analogy, as <b>it says</b> in the verse: “At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi to bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord <b>to minister to Him and to bless in His name”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:8). <b>Just as</b> a priest <b>performs the</b> Temple <b>service while standing, so too, he blesses while standing.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that <b>he performs the service itself</b> while standing? <b>As it is written: “To stand to minister</b> in the name of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 18:5).

### Part 6
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“So you shall bless”</b> means <b>with lifted hands.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that the priests must recite the benediction <b>with lifted hands, or</b> perhaps they may recite it <b>without lifted hands? It is stated here: “So you shall bless,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the dedication of the Tabernacle: <b>“And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them”</b> (Leviticus 9:22). <b>Just as there,</b> Aaron blessed the nation <b>with lifted hands, so too here,</b> the Priestly Benediction is recited <b>with lifted hands.</b>

### Part 7
This <i>halakha</i> was <b>difficult for Rabbi Yonatan to understand: If</b> this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the dedication of the Tabernacle, then why not also say: <b>Just as there,</b> the <b>High Priest</b> was the one who recited the blessing, <b>and</b> it was the <b>New Moon, and</b> the offerings that were brought were <b>a communal service, so too here,</b> the Priestly Benediction must be recited only by the <b>High Priest, and</b> on the <b>New Moon, and</b> when performing <b>a communal service?</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Natan says: It is not necessary</b> to derive from a verbal analogy that the Priestly Benediction is recited with lifted hands, as <b>it says</b> with regard to Aaron: “To stand to minister in the name of the Lord, <b>him and his sons forever”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:5). In this verse, <b>his sons are juxtaposed with him. Just as</b> Aaron recited the Priestly Benediction <b>with lifted hands, so too, his sons</b> recite the benediction <b>with lifted hands. And</b> furthermore, <b>it is written “forever,”</b> which indicates that it is referring not only to special occasions. <b>And</b> although the verse is not referring to the Priestly Benediction, the <b>benediction is juxtaposed to</b> the Temple <b>service</b> in another verse: “To minister to Him and to bless in His name” (Deuteronomy 10:8).

### Part 9
<b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“So you shall bless the children of Israel”</b> means the blessing should be recited <b>with the ineffable name.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that the Priestly Benediction must be recited <b>with the ineffable name, or</b> perhaps <b>it is</b> recited <b>with only the substitute name,</b> <i>Adonai</i>? <b>The verse states: “So shall they put My name”</b> (Numbers 6:27), which means <b>My name that is unique to Me.</b>

### Part 10
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even in the outlying areas,</b> outside the Temple, <b>this</b> ineffable name is used. <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to the Priestly Benediction: <b>“So shall they put My name,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the place one must sacrifice offerings: “The place that the Lord your God has chosen out of all your tribes <b>to put His name there”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:5). The verbal analogy teaches that <b>just as there,</b> the expression “to put His name there” is referring to <b>the Temple, so too here,</b> the mitzva of “so shall they put My name” applies <b>in the Temple</b> and not anywhere else.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yoshiya says: It is not necessary</b> to derive this <i>halakha</i> from the verbal analogy, as it can be derived from a verse. <b>It says</b> in the verse: <b>“In every place where I cause My name to be mentioned I will come to you</b> and bless you” (Exodus 20:20). Does it <b>enter your mind</b> that this verse literally means that the Divine Presence will be revealed <b>everywhere? Rather, this verse</b> must be interpreted by <b>transposition.</b> It must be reordered and read as follows: <b>In every place where I will come to you and bless you, there I will cause My name to be mentioned.</b> Rabbi Yoshiya explains that God is stating: <b>And where will I come to you and bless you? In the Temple.</b> Therefore, he derives: <b>There, in the Temple, I will cause My name to be mentioned,</b> but the ineffable name is not mentioned elsewhere.

### Part 12
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“So you shall bless the sons of Israel”</b> (Numbers 6:23). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the <i>halakha</i> to bless <b>the sons of Israel. From where</b> do I derive the <i>halakha</i> of blessing <b>converts, women, and emancipated slaves? The verse states</b> immediately afterward: <b>“You shall say to them,”</b> meaning <b>to all of</b> the Jewish people.

### Part 13
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“So you shall bless,”</b> means that the priests must recite the Priestly Benediction <b>face-to-face</b> with the congregation. Do <b>you say</b> that the Benediction must be recited <b>face-to-face, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> recited with the <b>faces</b> of the priests <b>facing the back of the necks</b> of the congregation? <b>The verse states: “You shall say to them,”</b> face-to-face, <b>like a person who is talking to another.</b>

### Part 14
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“So you shall bless”</b> means that the benediction must be recited <b>out loud. Or,</b> perhaps, <b>is it</b> recited <b>only in a whisper? The verse states: “You shall say to them,” like a person who is talking to another.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Abaye said: We have a tradition</b> with regard to the prayer leader calling the priests to recite the Priestly Benediction: When there are <b>two</b> priests, <b>he calls: Priests, but</b> when there is <b>one</b> priest <b>he does not call: Priest, as it is stated: “You shall say to them,”</b> in plural, meaning <b>to</b> a minimum of <b>two</b> priests. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: We have a tradition</b> that <b>a priest calls: Priests, but an Israelite does not call: Priests, as it is stated: “You shall say to them,”</b> which means that the <b>saying</b>
