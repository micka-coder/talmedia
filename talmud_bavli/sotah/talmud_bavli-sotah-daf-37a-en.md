### Part 1
<b>the tribe of Benjamin and descended into the sea first, as it is stated: “There is Benjamin, the youngest, ruling them [<i>rodem</i>]”</b> (Psalms 68:28). <b>Do not read</b> it as: “<b>Ruling them [<i>rodem</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>Descending [<i>red</i>]</b> into the <b>sea</b> [<b><i>yam</i>]. And the princes of</b> the tribe of <b>Judah were stoning them [<i>rogmim otam</i>]</b> for plunging in first and not in the proper order, <b>as it is stated</b> in the continuation of the verse: <b>“The princes of Judah, their council [<i>rigmatam</i>]”</b> (Psalms 68:28).

### Part 2
<b>Therefore, Benjamin the righteous was privileged to serve as host to</b> the Divine Presence of <b>the Almighty,</b> as the Temple was built in the territory of Benjamin, <b>as it is stated</b> in Moses’ blessing for the tribe of Benjamin: “The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by Him; He covers him all the day, <b>and He rests between his shoulders”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:12).

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> to Rabbi Meir: <b>That is not how the incident</b> took place. <b>Rather, this tribe said: I am not going into the sea first, and that</b> tribe <b>said: I am not going into the sea first.</b> Then, in <b>jumped</b> the prince of Judah, <b>Nahshon ben Amminadab, and descended into the sea first,</b> accompanied by his entire tribe, <b>as it is stated: “Ephraim surrounds Me with lies and the house of Israel with deceit, and Judah is yet wayward toward God [<i>rad im El</i>]”</b> (Hosea 12:1), which is interpreted homiletically as: And Judah descended [<i>rad</i>] with God [<i>im El</i>].

### Part 4
<b>And in this regard, the tradition,</b> i.e., the Writings, <b>explicates</b> Nahshon’s prayer at that moment: <b>“Save me, God; for the waters are come in even unto the soul. I am sunk in deep mire, where there is no standing…let not the water flood overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up”</b> (Psalms 69:2–3, 16).

### Part 5
<b>At that time, Moses was prolonging</b> his <b>prayer. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: My beloved ones are drowning in the sea and you prolong your prayer to me?</b> Moses <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, but what can I do?</b> God <b>said to him: “Speak to the children of Israel that they go forward. And you, lift up your rod and stretch out your hand”</b> (Exodus 14:15–16).

### Part 6
<b>For this reason,</b> because Nahshon and the tribe of Judah went into the sea first, the tribe of <b>Judah merited to govern Israel, as it is stated: “Judah became His sanctuary, Israel His dominion.</b> The sea saw it and fled” (Psalms 114:2–3). The <i>baraita</i> interprets the verses in this manner: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>Judah became His sanctuary and Israel</b> came under <b>His dominion?</b> It is <b>because “the sea saw it and fled.”</b>

### Part 7
§ The Gemara returns to discussing the blessing and curses. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:9) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: It is impossible to say</b> that the tribe of <b>Levi</b> stood <b>below,</b> between the two mountains, <b>as it is already stated</b> that they were <b>above,</b> in the verse: “These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people when you have passed over the Jordan: Simeon and Levi and Judah” (Deuteronomy 27:12). <b>And it is impossible to say</b> that they stood <b>above</b> on the mountain <b>because it is already stated:</b> “And all of Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the Ark and on that side before the priests the Levites” (Joshua 8:33). This shows that the Levites stood <b>below,</b> between the mountains, with the Ark.

### Part 8
<b>How</b> is <b>this</b> possible? Only <b>the Elders of the priesthood and the Levites</b> stood <b>below, and the rest</b> of the Levites stood <b>above</b> on the mountain. <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says: Any</b> Levite <b>who was fit to serve</b> in the Temple stood <b>below,</b> between the mountains, <b>and the rest</b> of the tribe, who were too young or too old to serve in the Temple, stood <b>above</b> on the mountain.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Both</b> the Levites <b>and</b> the Israelites <b>were standing below. They turned to face Mount Gerizim and opened with a blessing,</b> and then they turned <b>toward Mount Ebal and opened with a curse.</b> Therefore, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the verse: “These shall stand <b>on [<i>al</i> ]</b> Mount Gerizim to bless the people” (Deuteronomy 27:12)? <b>“<i>Al</i>”</b> means <b>adjacent to</b> the mountain but not actually on the mountain itself.

### Part 10
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the shewbread: <b>“And you shall put pure frankincense on [<i>al</i> ] each row”</b> (Leviticus 24:7). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: “<i>Al</i>”</b> in this instance means <b>adjacent to.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that <b>“<i>al</i>”</b> means <b>adjacent to, or</b> perhaps it carries <b>only</b> its <b>literal</b> meaning of <b>“on”? When it says</b> in the verse: <b>“And you shall screen the Ark [<i>al haAron</i>]</b> with the curtain” (Exodus 40:3), the word “<i>al</i>” cannot mean on, as the curtain that separated the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies was not placed on top of the Ark, but near it. Therefore, <b>you must say</b> that <b>“<i>al</i>”</b> means <b>adjacent to.</b>

### Part 11
§ It is stated in the mishna: <b>They turned to face Mount Gerizim and opened with a blessing:</b> Blessed be the man who does not make a graven or molten image (see Deuteronomy 27:15), and these people and those people, i.e., the two groups standing on either mountain, answered: Amen. Then they turned to face Mount Ebal and opened with the curse: “Cursed be the man who makes a graven or molten image” (Deuteronomy 27:15), and these people and those people answered: Amen. <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:10): The blessings and curses include <b>a general blessing</b> for one who fulfills the entire Torah, and <b>a particular blessing</b> for each individual statement mentioned in the blessings and curses. Likewise, there is <b>a general curse</b> for one who does not fulfill the entire Torah and <b>a particular curse</b> for each individual statement. And for each of the blessings and curses there is a mitzva <b>to learn and to teach,</b> and <b>to keep and to perform. Consequently,</b>
