### Part 1
<b>as</b> the Torah has already <b>rendered an uncertain</b> case of <b>a woman who has engaged in sexual intercourse with a man forbidden to her by the Torah [<i>zona</i>] as though</b> she is certainly <b>a <i>zona</i>,</b> since a <i>sota</i> is forbidden to her husband after seclusion even though there are no witnesses that she committed adultery, and therefore it should be prohibited for her to marry a priest just like any <i>zona</i>, then with regard to her prohibition against partaking of <b><i>teruma</i> a verse should also not be necessary, as</b> it is prohibited for a <i>zona</i> to partake of <i>teruma</i>. Therefore, the Torah <b>renders an uncertain <i>zona</i> like</b> a certain <b><i>zona</i>.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rather,</b> it must be explained that <b>according to Rabbi Akiva,</b> the equivalent of <b>four verses</b> worthy of exposition <b>are written</b> with regard to the defilement of a <i>sota</i>, as he maintains that an additional <i>halakha</i> should be derived from the superfluous prefix <i>vav</i> in the verse: “And is defiled [<i>venitma’a</i>]” (Numbers 5:29). Therefore, <b>one</b> verse is written to forbid her <b>to</b> her <b>husband, and one</b> is to forbid her <b>to</b> her <b>paramour, and one</b> is to forbid her <b>to</b> marry into the <b>priesthood, and one</b> is to forbid her <b>to</b> partake of <b><i>teruma</i>.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And Rabbi Yishmael</b> disagrees with Rabbi Akiva, as he does not expound on the superfluous <i>vav</i>, and therefore maintains that only <b>three verses are written: One</b> is to forbid her <b>to</b> her <b>husband, and one</b> is to forbid her <b>to</b> her <b>paramour, and one</b> is to forbid her <b>to</b> partake of <b><i>teruma</i>. And</b> her being prohibited to marry into the <b>priesthood is derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, as described in the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where does Rabbi Yishmael</b> derive <b>that the verse was necessary</b> to teach the prohibition of a <i>sota</i> <b>to</b> partake of <b><i>teruma</i>, and</b> her prohibition against marrying into the <b>priesthood is derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? <b>Perhaps</b> the verse <b>was necessary</b> in order to teach that it is prohibited for the woman to marry <b>into</b> the <b>priesthood, but <i>teruma</i> is permitted</b> for her?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yishmael could have <b>said to you: It is reasonable</b> to derive from this verse a prohibition that is <b>similar to</b> the prohibitions derived from the other verses, i.e., that she is forbidden <b>to</b> her <b>husband and</b> her <b>paramour. Just as</b> she is forbidden to her <b>husband and</b> her <b>paramour</b> even <b>during</b> the <b>lifetime</b> of her husband, <b>so too,</b> the prohibition against partaking of <b><i>teruma</i></b> applies <b>also during</b> the <b>lifetime</b> of her husband, <b>to the exclusion of</b> her prohibition against marrying into the <b>priesthood, which</b> is relevant only <b>after</b> the <b>death</b> of her husband. The reason is that if her husband would divorce her it would be prohibited for her to marry a priest anyway.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> respond? The Gemara answers: <b>He is not</b> of the opinion that it is more reasonable to derive a prohibition from the phrase “and is defiled” that is <b>similar to</b> the prohibitions involving her <b>husband and</b> her <b>paramour,</b> and therefore he requires two separate derivations; one for <i>teruma</i> and one for the priesthood.

### Part 7
<b>Or alternatively,</b> perhaps <b>he accepts</b> the opinion that the <i>halakha</i> derived from “and is defiled” should be similar to the prohibitions involving the husband and paramour, but nevertheless, in certain instances with regard to <b>a matter that can be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, the <b>verse</b> nevertheless <b>takes the trouble and writes</b> explicitly. Therefore, although unnecessary, two verses are stated, one for <i>teruma</i> and one for the priesthood.

### Part 8
The Gemara continues discussing the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an entity that has awareness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked and</b> an entity that <b>lacks awareness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked</b> in cases of uncertain ritual impurity <b>is derived from this verse: “And the flesh that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 7:19). This would seem to indicate that specifically food that is <b>impure</b> for <b>certain is</b> that <b>which shall not be eaten, but</b> food for which it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it is <b>impure and uncertain</b> whether it is <b>pure can be eaten.</b>

### Part 9
However, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the verse: <b>“And as for the flesh, every one that is pure may eat the flesh”</b> (Leviticus 7:19), which would seem to indicate that specifically one who is <b>pure</b> for <b>certain is</b> one <b>who shall eat meat, but</b> one for whom it is <b>uncertain</b> whether he is <b>impure and uncertain</b> whether he is <b>pure shall not eat.</b> The two clauses in the verse seem to contradict one another with regard to the status of uncertain purity.

### Part 10
<b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from it</b> that the Torah differentiates between two different types of uncertainty? <b>Here,</b> the latter clause, which discusses “every one that is pure,” is referring to an entity <b>that has awareness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked,</b> e.g., a person, who is considered impure if he is uncertain whether he contracted ritual impurity. <b>There,</b> the former clause which discusses impure meat presents the principle of an entity <b>that lacks awareness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked,</b> where an uncertain case of ritual impurity is deemed pure.

### Part 11
The Gemara explains the need for two separate derivations concerning uncertain contractions of ritual impurity: <b>And</b> the derivation <b>that Rav Giddel</b> said that <b>Rav said was necessary, and</b> it <b>was</b> also <b>necessary to derive</b> the principle of uncertain ritual impurity <b>from <i>sota</i>; since if</b> it were derived only <b>through</b> the derivation <b>of Rav, I would say</b> that it makes no difference <b>whether</b> the uncertain contraction of impurity occurred <b>in the private domain or whether</b> it occurred <b>in the public domain.</b> Therefore, it <b>was necessary to derive from <i>sota</i></b> that uncertain impurity is considered impure only in the private domain.

### Part 12
<b>And if</b> it is derived only <b>from <i>sota</i>, I would say</b> that similar to <i>sota</i>, where both the woman and the paramour possess awareness in order to be asked if they committed the act, so too, items with uncertain impurity should not be deemed impure <b>unless there is awareness</b> on the part of both <b>the one who touches</b> the impure item <b>and the one who causes him to touch,</b> i.e., the agent of impurity and the recipient of impurity are both competent people. Therefore, the derivation of Rav was <b>necessary,</b> as it teaches that in an uncertain case of impurity in the private domain, one is deemed impure even if only the contractor of impurity possesses the awareness to be asked.

### Part 13
§ It is stated in the mishna: <b>On that same day Rabbi Akiva interpreted</b> the phrase “shall be impure” in the verse: <b>“And every earthen vessel</b> into which any of them falls, whatever is in it shall be impure [<i>yitma</i>], and you shall break it” (Leviticus 11:33), as indicating that a loaf that has second-degree ritual impurity can render other food with which it comes into contact impure with third-degree impurity. Rabbi Yehoshua related that Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai had predicted that a future generation would purify a loaf that contracted third-degree impurity, as there is no explicit verse in the Torah stating that this degree of impurity exists.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>But since</b> the loaf <b>does not have</b> an explicit verse stating that it is impure, <b>why</b> did Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai himself maintain that it is <b>impure?</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai maintained that although <b>it has no</b> explicit basis <b>from</b> a verse in <b>the Torah, it has</b> proof for its impurity <b>through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: If</b> even <b>one who immersed</b> in a ritual bath <b>that day</b> and will become completely purified after nightfall, <b>who is</b> therefore <b>permitted to</b> touch <b>non-sacred</b> articles, i.e., he does not transmit impurity to them, <b>disqualifies <i>teruma</i></b> that he touches, then with regard to <b>a loaf</b> that has <b>second-</b>degree impurity as result of contact with an impure item of the first degree, <b>which is disqualified,</b> i.e., it is rendered impure, even if it is <b>non-sacred, isn’t it logical that it should impart third-</b>degree impurity <b>upon <i>teruma</i>?</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara challenges: This <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>can be refuted. What</b> is unique <b>about one</b> who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed <b>is that</b> prior to his immersion, he was <b>a primary source of impurity.</b> He therefore retains his stringent status even after immersion with regard to his capability of disqualifying <i>teruma</i>. The loaf, by contrast, has second-degree impurity from the outset, and should therefore be treated more lightly.

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: <b>Derive</b> this <i>halakha</i>
