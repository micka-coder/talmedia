<b>like</b> a case of <b>certain</b> contact with an impure item? Accordingly, any cases of uncertain ritual impurity should be treated like certain impurity.

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> since the case of <i>sota</i> is the source for the <i>halakha</i> with regard to uncertain ritual impurity, the details of the <i>halakha</i> are also derived from the case of <i>sota</i>. Therefore, <b>from the place that you came</b> from, i.e., from the source, it is derived that <b>just as</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i></b> applies only when the uncertainty arises in <b>the private domain,</b> i.e., when she has secluded herself with the alleged paramour, <b>so too,</b> uncertain contact with the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> renders an item impure only if the contact was in <b>the private domain.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>just as a <i>sota</i> is an entity that has awareness</b> in order for her <b>to be asked</b> whether she actually committed adultery, <b>so too,</b> contact with <b>a creeping animal</b> renders an item impure only if it is <b>an entity that has awareness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked,</b> i.e., a person, or an item that may have contracted impurity in a place where a person was present and could have known.

### Part 4
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>And from here</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> that if <b>an entity that has awareness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked</b> may have contracted impurity <b>in the private domain, its uncertain</b> impurity renders it <b>impure;</b> but if it may have contracted impurity <b>in the public domain, its uncertain</b> impurity leaves it <b>pure. And</b> with regard to an entity <b>that lacks awareness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked, whether</b> the uncertainty arose <b>in the private domain or in the public domain, its uncertain</b> impurity is deemed <b>pure,</b> as it is not similar to a <i>sota</i>.

### Part 5
The Gemara begins its discussion of the <i>baraita</i> by inquiring about the exchange between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva: <b>And</b> what was the intention of <b>Rabbi Yishmael?</b> Apparently, he commented on a statement of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who <b>said</b> that it is prohibited for a <i>sota</i> to partake of <b><i>teruma</i>, and he answered him</b> concerning the matter of the womanâ€™s being prohibited to marry into the <b>priesthood,</b> which was not mentioned by Rabbi Akiva at all.

### Part 6
<b>And furthermore, from where does Rabbi Akiva derive</b> that it is prohibited for a <i>sota</i> to marry into the <b>priesthood? And if you would say</b> that with regard to her prohibition against marrying into the <b>priesthood a verse is not necessary,</b>
