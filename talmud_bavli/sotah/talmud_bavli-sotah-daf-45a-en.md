### Part 1
because <b>he does not learn</b> anything from the letter <b><i>vav</i>.</b> Rather, <b>what is the Merciful One saying</b> in the Torah with the phrase “and your judges”? He is referring to <b>the distinguished that are among your judges.</b> The Gemara raises an objection: <b>However, if that is so,</b> if every plural form in the verse adds another two judges, then when it later states: <b>“And they shall go out,”</b> this should indicate another <b>two.</b> And: <b>“And they shall measure”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:2), should indicate yet another <b>two.</b> This means that <b>according to</b> the reasoning of <b>Rabbi Yehuda there are nine</b> judges enumerated <b>here,</b> while <b>according to</b> the reasoning of <b>Rabbi Shimon there are seven</b> judges enumerated <b>here.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara responds: <b>He requires that</b> verse: “And they shall go out…and they shall measure,” <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And they shall go out,”</b> serves to emphasize that <b>they</b> themselves go out, <b>and not their agents,</b> i.e., they may not appoint an agent to measure the distance but must do it themselves. <b>“And they shall measure,”</b> teaches <b>that even</b> if the corpse <b>was found clearly</b> near <b>to</b> a particular <b>city they would</b> nevertheless <b>measure</b> the distance, <b>as</b> it is <b>a mitzva to engage in</b> this act of <b>measurement.</b>

### Part 3
§ The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: “Your Elders,” this is the Sanhedrin; “your judges,” this is the king and the High Priest.</b> According to Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, the king and the High Priest need to participate in the ritual of breaking the neck of the heifer. From where is it learned that they are called judges? <b>A king</b> is called a judge, <b>as it is written: “A king by justice establishes the land”</b> (Proverbs 29:4). <b>A High Priest</b> is called a judge, <b>as it is written:</b> “If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment…<b>And you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge who shall be</b> in those days” (Deuteronomy 17:8–9).

### Part 4
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is it so that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov disagrees</b> only <b>with regard to a king and a High Priest,</b> contending that they too must be present at the measurement, <b>but</b> that <b>with regard to the Sanhedrin he holds either in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that five Elders are needed <b>or in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> that three suffice? <b>Or, perhaps he also disagrees with regard to the Sanhedrin</b> and claims that the ritual is not performed <b>unless there is the entire Sanhedrin</b> participating.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a rebellious Elder found</b> the Sanhedrin not in the Hewn Chamber, which was their usual place, but <b>in Beit Pagei,</b> near Jerusalem, <b>and he rebelled against them</b> there, by teaching in opposition to their ruling, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>his rebellion should be</b> considered <b>a rebellion,</b> rendering him liable to punishment. <b>The verse</b> therefore <b>states: “And you shall arise and go up to the place”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:8), which <b>teaches that</b> it is <b>the place</b> where the Sanhedrin resides that <b>causes</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a rebellious Elder to take effect.

### Part 6
The Gemara analyzes this statement: In this case, <b>how many</b> members of the Sanhedrin were there <b>who went out</b> to Beit Pagei? <b>If we say that</b> only <b>a minority of them went out,</b> why should he be considered a rebellious Elder? <b>Perhaps those</b> judges <b>who are inside</b> the Hewn Chamber <b>hold in accordance with his</b> opinion, which would mean that the Elder in question ruled with the majority. <b>Rather,</b> it <b>is obvious that they all went out.</b>

### Part 7
The assumption that they all went out leads to the following question: <b>And for what</b> purpose did they all leave the Hewn Chamber? <b>If</b> it was <b>for an optional matter, may they leave? But isn’t it written: “Your navel [<i>shorerekh</i>] is like a round goblet, let no mingled wine be wanting”</b> (Song of Songs 7:3). This verse is interpreted as referring to the Sanhedrin, the ministers [<i>sarei</i>] of Israel who sit in a semicircle, like half of a round goblet. The words “let no mingled wine be wanting” teach <b>that if one of</b> the great Sanhedrin <b>needed to leave,</b> then <b>if there are</b> still present in the Hewn Chamber <b>twenty-three</b> members, <b>corresponding</b> to the number of <b>a lesser Sanhedrin, he may leave; and if not, he may not leave.</b> This indicates that it is prohibited for the entire Sanhedrin to leave for an optional matter.

### Part 8
<b>Rather</b> it <b>is obvious</b> that they left <b>for a matter of a mitzva. For what</b> particular mitzva did they venture out? <b>Is it not for the measurement</b> associated <b>with</b> the ritual of <b>the heifer, and it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov?</b> This would prove that Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov holds that the entire Sanhedrin goes out to measure the distance from the corpse to the nearby cities. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>No,</b> this is not a proof, as <b>perhaps</b> they went out for a different mitzva, <b>to expand the city</b> of Jerusalem <b>or the courtyards</b> of the Temple, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 2a): <b>They may expand</b> the sanctified area of <b>the city</b> of Jerusalem <b>or</b> of <b>the</b> Temple <b>courtyards only with the court of seventy-one.</b>

### Part 9
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef,</b> that Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov disagrees even with regard to the number of judges: If the rebellious Elder <b>found</b> the Sanhedrin <b>in Beit Pagei and rebelled against them, for example, if they went out for the measurement</b> of the ritual <b>of the heifer or to expand</b> the area of <b>the city or</b> that of <b>the courtyards,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>his rebellion should be a rebellion.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the requirement to follow the rulings of the Sanhedrin: <b>“And you shall arise and go up to the place”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:8). This <b>teaches that the place causes</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a rebellious Elder to take effect, indicating that the entire Sanhedrin participates in the measurement of the distance from the corpse to the cities.

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches: If the corpse <b>was found concealed in a pile</b> of stones <b>or hanging on a tree,</b> they would not perform the ritual of the heifer. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that the mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that sheaves of grain forgotten in the fields must be left for the poor: <b>“And you forget a sheaf in the field”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:19). This <b>excludes a concealed</b> sheaf; it is not considered forgotten and it may be collected by the owner, even if he did forget it. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say:</b> The phrase <b>“in the field”</b> serves <b>to include the concealed</b> sheaves, and these must be left for the poor. Rabbi Yehuda holds, like the ruling in the mishna here, that when the verse states “in the field” it excludes a concealed corpse.

### Part 11
<b>Rav said: You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> as <b>here</b> they expound the <i>halakha</i> <b>based on the context of the verse,</b> and <b>there</b> too they expound the <i>halakha</i> <b>based on the context of the verse.</b>

### Part 12
In this case, <b>as it is written: “If one be found slain”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:1), the default assumption is that the <i>halakha</i> applies no matter <b>where it is found.</b> When the verse then states: <b>“In the ground,”</b> it must be serving to <b>exclude</b> a matter, i.e., <b>a concealed</b> corpse. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>there,</b> in the case of forgotten sheaves, they also expound <b>based on the context of the verse, as it is written: “When you reap your harvest in your field, and you forget a sheaf”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:19). This indicates that <b>forgotten</b> sheaves <b>are similar to</b> those <b>of</b> the <b>harvest: Just as</b> the <b>harvest</b> is performed <b>with revealed</b> objects, i.e., the growing grain, <b>so too,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>forgetting</b> pertain <b>to revealed</b> sheaves. Consequently, when <b>the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah <b>“in the field,”</b> it must be in order <b>to include the concealed</b> sheaves.

### Part 13
In light of this explanation, the Gemara asks: <b>According to Rabbi Yehuda as well, let him derive</b> that covered sheaves are not included <b>from</b> the fact that <b>forgotten</b> sheaves <b>are similar to</b> those <b>of</b> the <b>harvest.</b> Why does he have to derive it from the words “in the field”? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so,</b> he does not derive that <i>halakha</i> from the phrase “in the field.”

### Part 14
The Gemara therefore inquires: <b>But</b> then <b>why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“in the field,”</b> which indicates either an exclusion or an inclusion? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires</b> it in order <b>to include the forgotten</b> stalks <b>of standing</b> grain. Produce that one forgot to reap is considered forgotten, even if it is still attached to the ground. The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis, from where</b> do they learn the <i>halakha</i> of <b>forgotten</b> stalks <b>of standing</b> grain? The Gemara answers: <b>They derive</b> it <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“When you reap your harvest in your field,</b> and you forget,” which indicates that the <i>halakha</i> includes one who forgot to harvest part of his field.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> derive from this verse? The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary for him</b> in order <b>to</b> learn <b>that which Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> says, <b>as Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> This verse <b>excludes sheaves that floated</b> through the air from his field <b>into another’s field.</b> Such sheaves are not classified as forgotten and may be retrieved later by the owner. <b>And the Rabbis,</b> from where do they derive this <i>halakha</i>? They derive it <b>from</b> the fact that the verse could have stated: <b>In the field,</b> but instead states <b>“in your field,”</b> to include sheaves situated only in one’s own field. The Gemara continues to ask: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> learn from this phrase? The Gemara answers: <b>He does not learn</b> anything from the difference between: <b>In the field,</b> and <b>“in your field,”</b> as he holds it is not a significant difference.

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>sheaves floated into his field,</b> i.e., if one sheaf landed on another sheaf or on another item, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the <b>airspace of a field considered to be like</b> it is the <b>field</b> itself, in which case one sheaf on top of another meets the legal requirements to be deemed forgotten? <b>Or,</b> is it <b>not considered like</b> the <b>field,</b> in which case one sheaf on top of another does not meet the legal requirements to be deemed forgotten?

### Part 17
<b>Rav Kahana said to Rav Pappi, and some say Rav Kahana</b> said it <b>to Rav Zevid: Let him resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu,</b> who <b>says that Rabbi Elazar says:</b> This <b>excludes sheaves that floated into another’s field.</b> If they floated into <b>another’s field, yes,</b> Rabbi Elazar said that they are not deemed forgotten, <b>but</b> if they floated <b>into his</b> own <b>field,</b> they are <b>not</b> discussed by Rabbi Elazar, and therefore they are deemed forgotten.

### Part 18
The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>And according to your reasoning</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> is limited to the case stated, one could infer: In a case where the sheaves drifted <b>into another’s field,</b> then if <b>they were floating, yes,</b> they are not deemed to be forgotten, but if <b>they were resting</b> directly on the ground in another’s field, <b>no,</b> they are deemed to be forgotten. <b>But</b> this cannot be the <i>halakha</i>, as <b>we require</b> the sheaves to be <b>“in your field,” and</b> these sheaves are <b>not</b> in his field.

### Part 19
<b>Rather,</b> you must admit that the words: <b>Into another’s field,</b> include not only those sheaves which are lying on other items, <b>but even</b> those <b>resting</b> directly on the ground. <b>And</b> the reason <b>that</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>states: Floated,</b> is that <b>you find</b> a situation where sheaves end up in the field of another <b>only in</b> a case where <b>they floated</b> through the air and fell there. Since the term floated was not used to teach a <i>halakha</i>, no inference can be made from this <i>baraita</i> with regard to sheaves that floated in one’s own field.

### Part 20
The Gemara again attempts to resolve the dilemma: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Pe’a</i> 3:7): In the case of <b>a sheaf that had been held</b> by its owner in order <b>to take it to the city, and he placed it on top of another</b> sheaf, <b>and he forgot</b> both sheaves, <b>the lower</b> sheaf is deemed to be <b>a forgotten sheaf, and the upper one is not</b> deemed to be <b>a forgotten sheaf. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: Both of them are not</b> deemed to be <b>forgotten sheaves; the lower one because it is concealed, and the upper one because it is floating</b> and not directly touching the field. The Gemara points out: <b>They disagree only with regard to</b> the <b>lower</b> sheaf, <b>but with regard to</b> the <b>upper</b> one <b>all agree</b> that <b>it is not</b> deemed <b>a forgotten sheaf.</b> This demonstrates that a sheaf located in the airspace of the field is not deemed to be forgotten.

### Part 21
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>There it is different, as, since</b> the owner <b>had held it</b> to take it to the city, <b>he acquired it.</b> The reason it is not deemed to be a forgotten sheaf is not because it is not touching the field but because the owner had already acquired that particular sheaf before forgetting it. The Gemara raises an objection to this explanation: <b>If so, why specifically</b> state the case of a sheaf that was placed <b>on top of another? The same would hold true</b> in a case where one put the sheaf down directly <b>in the field as well,</b> as he has already acquired it. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so, and</b> the reason <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: On top of another,</b> is <b>due to the lower</b> sheaf rather than the upper one, in order to teach the dispute concerning the lower sheaf.

### Part 22
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>said: Because it is floating.</b> How can one then say that the reason for his ruling is because the owner of the field has acquired it? The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> instead: <b>Because it is like</b> it is <b>floating.</b> In other words, it is as though the upper sheaf had not been put down at all, but remains in the owner’s hands.

### Part 23
The Gemara tells of a related incident. On one occasion <b>Abaye said: I am hereby</b> as sharp and expert <b>as ben Azzai,</b> who taught Torah <b>in the markets of Tiberias,</b> and am ready to answer any question that might be posed to me. <b>One of the Sages said to Abaye,</b> with regard to the ritual of the heifer whose neck is broken: If there were <b>two slain people</b> found <b>one on top of the other</b> not precisely aligned, <b>from where does one measure</b> the distance to the surrounding cities?

### Part 24
The various aspects of the dilemma are as follows: <b>Is a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance</b> considered to be <b>concealed, and is a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance not</b> considered to be <b>floating,</b> which would mean that the lower, concealed corpse is ignored because one does not measure the distance from a concealed corpse, as taught in the mishna, <b>and one measures</b> the distance <b>from the upper one? Or perhaps a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance is</b> considered to be <b>floating, and a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance is not</b> considered to be <b>concealed, and he measures</b> the distance <b>from the lower one,</b> because it is not considered to be concealed, but not from the upper one, which is considered to be floating.

### Part 25
<b>Or perhaps a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance is</b> considered to be <b>concealed, and a substance</b> in contact <b>with</b> the <b>same</b> type of <b>substance is</b> considered to be <b>floating, and he</b> therefore <b>does not measure</b> the distance <b>from the lower one nor does he measure</b> the distance <b>from the upper one.</b> According to this last option, in such a situation no measuring is done, and the ritual is not performed.

### Part 26
Abaye <b>said to him:</b>
