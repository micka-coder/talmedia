### Part 1
The names of the tribes were <b>not divided on the stones of the ephod the</b> same <b>way that they were divided in</b> the list found at the beginning of <b>the book of Numbers</b> (Numbers 1:1–15). <b>Rather</b> they were divided <b>the way that they were divided in the second book,</b> i.e., Exodus (Exodus 1:2–4).

### Part 2
<b>How</b> were they written? On one stone, the names of <b>the sons of Leah</b> were written <b>in the order of their</b> birth: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. On the other stone <b>the sons of Rachel</b> were written. <b>One,</b> Benjamin, was written <b>on this side,</b> i.e., at the bottom of the list, <b>and one,</b> Joseph, was written <b>on that side,</b> i.e., at the top of the list. <b>And the children of the handmaids,</b> i.e., Bilhah and Zilpah, who were Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher, were written on the second stone <b>in the middle.</b>

### Part 3
<b>But rather,</b> if their names were not written in the order of their births, then <b>how do I establish</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“According to their birth”</b> (Exodus 28:10)? It means that their names were written <b>according to</b> the <b>names that their father,</b> Jacob, <b>called them, and not according to the names that Moses called them.</b> On the stones it said <b>Reuben, and not Reubenites; Simeon, and not Simeonites; Dan, and not Danites; Gad, and not Gadites.</b> This <i>baraita</i> contradicts Rav Kahana’s opinion, as according to all of the opinions in the <i>baraita</i>, the division of the names on the ephod is not identical to the division of the tribes on Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal. The Gemara confirms: <b>The refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Kahana is</b> in fact <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what</b> is meant by the phrase: <b>“And the half of them</b> facing Mount Ebal” (Joshua 8:33)? It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The use of the definitive article in the verse indicates that the smaller half of the Jewish people was on Mount Ebal. <b>The half that was facing Mount Gerizim was larger than the half on Mount Ebal, because</b> the tribe of <b>Levi</b> was included in the group that was facing Mount Gerizim, and they remained <b>on the bottom</b> between the two mountains.

### Part 5
The Gemara is puzzled by this statement: <b>On the contrary, because</b> the tribe of <b>Levi</b> remained <b>on the bottom they were fewer</b> in number. The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Although</b> the tribe of <b>Levi was on the bottom, the descendants of Joseph were among them,</b> and the tribe of Joseph was numerous, <b>as it is stated: “And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying: Why did you give me a single lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people,</b> forasmuch as the Lord has blessed me thus, <b>and Joshua said to them: If you are a great people, you should go up to the forest”</b> (Joshua 17:14–15).

### Part 6
The Gemara explains that Joshua <b>said to them: Go and hide yourselves in the forests, so that the evil eye will not have dominion over you,</b> as you are such a large number of people. The tribe of Joseph <b>said to him: The evil eye does not have dominion over the offspring of Joseph, as it is written: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain”</b> (Genesis 49:22), <b>and Rabbi Abbahu says: Do not read</b> the verse as saying: <b>“By a fountain [<i>alei ayin</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>Those who rise above</b> the evil <b>eye [<i>olei ayin</i>],</b> teaching that Joseph and his descendants are not susceptible to the evil eye.

### Part 7
The Gemara cites an alternative source for the assertion that the evil eye holds no sway over Joseph and his descendants: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said</b> that it is derived <b>from here:</b> Jacob blessed Joseph’s children and said: <b>“And let them grow [<i>veyidgu</i>] into a multitude in the midst of the earth”</b> (Genesis 48:16). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>fish [<i>dagim</i>] in the sea, waters cover them and the</b> evil <b>eye</b> therefore <b>has no dominion over them, so too,</b> with regard to <b>Joseph’s descendants, the</b> evil <b>eye has no dominion over them.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks with regard to the <i>baraita</i> that contradicts Rav Kahana’s opinion: <b>Are these</b> names of the tribes, which were written on the ephod, composed of a total of <b>fifty letters?</b> There <b>are</b> only <b>forty-nine. Rabbi Yitzḥak says: They added one letter to</b> the name of <b>Joseph [<i>Yosef</i> ]</b> when it was written on the ephod, <b>as it is stated: “He appointed it in Joseph [<i>Yehosef</i> ] for a testimony when He went forth against the land of Egypt”</b> (Psalms 81:6).

### Part 9
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak objects to this: We require</b> the names to be written <b>“according to their birth,”</b> and Joseph was not called <i>Yehosef</i> from birth. <b>Rather,</b> the explanation is as follows: Throughout <b>the entire Torah,</b> the name of <b>Benjamin is written</b> without a second letter <i>yod</i> between the letters <i>mem</i> and <i>nun</i>, <b>and here,</b> where he is born, <b>Benjamin</b> is written <b>in full,</b> spelled with a second <i>yod</i>. <b>As it is written: “But his father called him Benjamin”</b> (Genesis 35:18). Therefore, his name was written on the ephod with a second <i>yod</i>, “according to his birth.”

### Part 10
§ <b>Rav Ḥana bar Bizna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida says: Joseph, who sanctified the name of Heaven in private, had one letter of the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> the letter <i>heh</i>, <b>added to his</b> name. Whereas in the case of <b>Judah, who sanctified the name of Heaven in public [<i>befarhesya</i>]</b> at the Red Sea during the exodus from Egypt, merited that <b>his entire</b> name <b>is called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> as the entire four-letter name of God can be found within Judah’s name.

### Part 11
The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> the situation where <b>Joseph</b> sanctified God’s name in private? <b>As it is written: “And it came to pass on a certain day, when he went into the house to do his work”</b> (Genesis 39:11). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This <b>teaches that both</b> Joseph and Potiphar’s wife stayed in the house, as they <b>intended to</b> perform <b>a matter of sin.</b> With regard to the phrase <b>“when he went into the house to do his work,” Rav and Shmuel</b> engage in a dispute with regard to its meaning. <b>One says:</b> It means that he went into the house <b>to do his work, literally. And one says: He entered</b> the house <b>in order to fulfill his</b> sexual <b>needs</b> with her.

### Part 12
The verse continues: <b>“And there was none of the men of the house</b> there within” (Genesis 39:11). The Gemara asks: <b>Is it possible</b> that in such <b>a large</b> and important <b>house like the house of that wicked man</b> that <b>no one was in there? The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: That day was their festival day and they all went to their house of idol worship; and she told them</b> that <b>she was sick</b> and could not go, as <b>she said</b> to herself: <b>I have no day on which Joseph will attend to me like this day.</b>

### Part 13
The verse states: <b>“And she caught him by his garment, saying:</b> Lie with me” (Genesis 39:12). <b>At that moment his father’s image [<i>deyokeno</i>] came and appeared to him in the window.</b> The image <b>said to him: Joseph,</b> the names of <b>your brothers are destined to be written on the stones of the ephod, and you</b> are to be included <b>among them. Do you desire your name to be erased from among them, and to be called an associate [<i>ro’eh</i>] of promiscuous women? As it is written: “But he who keeps company with harlots wastes his riches”</b> (Proverbs 29:3), as he loses his honor, which is more valuable than wealth.

### Part 14
<b>Immediately: “And his bow abode [<i>teishev</i>] firm”</b> (Genesis 49:24). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> This means <b>that his bow,</b> i.e., his penis, <b>returned [<i>shava</i>] to its strength,</b> as he overcame his desire. The verse about Joseph continues: <b>“And the arms of his hands were made supple”</b> (Genesis 49:24), meaning that <b>he dug his hands into the ground and his semen was emitted between his fingernails.</b>

### Part 15
<b>“By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob”</b> (Genesis 49:24): <b>Who caused his</b> name <b>to be etched onto the stones of the ephod?</b> It was <b>only the might of Jacob. “From there, from the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel”</b> (Genesis 49:24) means: <b>From there,</b> because of Joseph’s ability to withstand this trial, <b>he merited to become a shepherd [<i>ro’eh</i>]</b> of the Jewish people, <b>as it is stated: “Listen, O Shepherd of Israel, who leads like the flock of Joseph”</b> (Psalms 80:2).

### Part 16
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Joseph was deserving of having twelve tribes descend from him,</b> the same <b>as</b> twelve tribes <b>descended from his father Jacob, as it is stated: “These are the generations of Jacob, Joseph”</b> (Genesis 37:2). This implies that everything that happened to Jacob was destined to happen to Joseph. <b>However,</b> he did not merit this because <b>his semen was emitted from between his fingernails. And even so,</b> the offspring that were meant to descend from him <b>descended from his brother Benjamin,</b> who had ten sons. <b>And they were all named after</b> Joseph, <b>as it is stated: “And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel,</b> Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard” (Genesis 46:21).

### Part 17
The Gemara explains how each name relates to Joseph: <b>Bela</b> was named after Joseph, <b>who was swallowed [<i>nivla</i>] among the nations. And Becher</b> received that name because Joseph <b>was the firstborn [<i>bekhor</i>] of his mother,</b> Rachel. <b>And Ashbel</b> received his name <b>because God sent</b> Joseph <b>into captivity [<i>shevao El</i>]</b> in Egypt. <b>Gera</b> was named after Joseph, <b>who dwelled [<i>gar</i>] in a foreign land [<i>akhsaneyut</i>].</b>

### Part 18
<b>And Naaman</b> was called that <b>because</b> Joseph <b>was extremely pleasing [<i>na’im</i>]. Ehi and Rosh</b> received these names, as Benjamin said: Joseph <b>is my brother [<i>aḥi</i>] and my leader [<i>roshi</i>].</b> Benjamin named his sons <b>Muppim and Huppim,</b> as Benjamin said: Joseph <b>did not see my wedding canopy [<i>ḥuppa</i>] and I did not see his wedding canopy. And Ard</b> was named after Joseph, <b>who descended [<i>yarad</i>] to</b> the lands of <b>the nations of the world. Some say</b> that the name <b>Ard</b> means <b>that</b> Joseph’s <b>face was similar</b> in its beauty <b>to a rose [<i>vered</i>].</b>

### Part 19
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: When Pharaoh said to Joseph: “And without you no man shall lift up his hand</b> or his foot in all the land of Egypt” (Genesis 41:44), <b>Pharaoh’s astrologers said: You will appoint a slave whose master bought him for twenty silver</b> coins <b>to rule over us? He said to them: I perceive royal characteristics [<i>ginnunei malkhut</i>] in him</b> and see that he was not initially a slave.

### Part 20
<b>They said to him: If</b> that is <b>so</b> and he is a child of royalty, <b>he should know</b> the <b>seventy languages</b> that all kings’ children learn. The angel <b>Gabriel</b> then <b>came and taught him</b> the <b>seventy languages,</b> but <b>he could not learn</b> all of them. Gabriel then <b>added one letter,</b> the letter <i>heh</i>, to Joseph’s name <b>from the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and</b> then <b>he</b> was able to <b>learn</b> the languages, <b>as it is stated: “He appointed it in Joseph [<i>Yehosef</i>] for a testimony, when he went forth against the land of Egypt, the speech of one that I did not know I heard”</b> (Psalms 81:6). <b>And the next day,</b> when he appeared before Pharaoh, in <b>every language that Pharaoh spoke with him, he answered him.</b>

### Part 21
Joseph then <b>spoke in the sacred tongue,</b> Hebrew, and Pharaoh <b>did not know what he was saying.</b> Pharaoh <b>said to him: Teach me</b> that language. <b>He taught him, but he</b> could <b>not learn</b> it. Pharaoh <b>said to him: Take an oath for my</b> benefit <b>that you will not reveal</b> that I do not know this language. <b>He took an oath for his</b> benefit.

### Part 22
Years later, <b>when</b> Joseph <b>said to</b> Pharaoh: <b>“My father made me swear, saying”</b> (Genesis 50:5) that I would bury him in Eretz Yisrael, Pharaoh <b>said to him: Go request</b> the dissolution <b>of your oath.</b> Joseph <b>said to him: And should I also request</b> dissolution <b>for</b> the oath that I took <b>for your</b> benefit? <b>And</b> consequently, <b>even though</b> Pharaoh <b>was not amenable</b> to letting Joseph go, he worried that Joseph would then request dissolution for the oath that he had taken for his benefit, and Pharaoh therefore <b>said to him: “Go up and bury your father according to what he made you swear”</b> (Genesis 50:6).

### Part 23
§ <b>What</b> was the incident where <b>Judah</b> sanctified God’s name in public? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: When the Jewish people stood at the</b> Red <b>Sea, the tribes were arguing with one other. This one was saying: I am going into the sea first, and that one was saying: I am going into the sea first.</b> Then, in <b>jumped</b>
