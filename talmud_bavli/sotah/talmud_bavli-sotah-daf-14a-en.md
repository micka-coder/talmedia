### Part 1
<b>the garrison [<i>gastera</i>] of Beth Peor</b> and said to them: <b>Show us where Moses is buried.</b> As the men <b>stood above</b> on the upper section of the mountain, <b>it appeared to them</b> as if the grave was <b>below</b> in the lower section. As they stood <b>below, it appeared to them</b> to be <b>above. They divided into two groups,</b> one above and one below. To <b>those who were standing above,</b> the grave <b>appeared to them</b> to be <b>below;</b> to those who were standing <b>below,</b> the grave <b>appeared to them to be above, to fulfill that which is stated: “And no man knows of his grave</b> to this day” (Deuteronomy 34:6).

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: Even Moses our teacher</b> himself <b>does not know where he is buried. It is written here: “And no man knows of his grave,” and it is written there: “And this is the blessing wherewith Moses the man of God blessed</b> the children of Israel before his death” (Deuteronomy 33:1). In other words, even Moses, as he is referred to by the term “man,” does not know his burial place. <b>And Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: For what</b> reason <b>was Moses buried near Beth Peor? In order to atone for the incident</b> that transpired at Beth <b>Peor</b> (Numbers, chapter 25).

### Part 3
<b>And Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “After the Lord your God shall you walk,</b> and Him shall you fear, and His commandments shall you keep, and unto His voice shall you hearken, and Him shall you serve, and unto Him shall you cleave” (Deuteronomy 13:5)? <b>But is it</b> actually <b>possible for a person to follow the Divine Presence? But hasn’t it already been stated: “For the Lord your God is a devouring fire,</b> a jealous God” (Deuteronomy 4:24), and one cannot approach fire.

### Part 4
He explains: <b>Rather,</b> the meaning is <b>that one should follow the attributes of the Holy One, Blessed be He.</b> He provides several examples. <b>Just as He clothes the naked, as it is written: “And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skin, and clothed them”</b> (Genesis 3:21), <b>so too,</b> should <b>you clothe the naked.</b> Just as <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, visits the sick, as it is written</b> with regard to God’s appearing to Abraham following his circumcision: <b>“And the Lord appeared unto him by the terebinths of Mamre”</b> (Genesis 18:1), <b>so too,</b> should <b>you visit the sick.</b> Just as <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, consoles mourners, as it is written: “And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son”</b> (Genesis 25:11), <b>so too,</b> should <b>you console mourners.</b> Just as <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, buried the dead, as it is written: “And he was buried in the valley</b> in the land of Moab” (Deuteronomy 34:6), <b>so too,</b> should <b>you bury the dead.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara discusses the verse: “And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife <b>garments of skin,</b> and clothed them” (Genesis 3:21). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree as to the meaning of the term “garments of skin.” <b>One says</b> that these garments were made of <b>something that comes from the skin, and one says</b> that these garments were <b>something from which the skin benefits.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Samlai taught:</b> With regard to the <b>Torah, its beginning is an act of kindness and its end is an act of kindness. Its beginning is an act of kindness, as it is written: “And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skin, and clothed them”</b> (Genesis 3:21). <b>And its end is an act of kindness, as it is written: “And he was buried in the valley</b> in the land of Moab” (Deuteronomy 34:6).

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Samlai taught: For what</b> reason <b>did Moses our teacher</b> greatly <b>desire to enter Eretz Yisrael? Did he need to eat of its produce, or did he need to satisfy himself from its goodness? Rather, this</b> is what <b>Moses said: Many mitzvot were commanded</b> to the <b>Jewish people, and</b> some of <b>them can be fulfilled only in Eretz Yisrael,</b> so <b>I will enter the land in order that they can all be fulfilled by me.</b>

### Part 8
<b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: Do you seek</b> to enter the land to perform these mitzvot <b>for any</b> reason <b>other than to receive a reward? I will ascribe you</b> credit <b>as if you had performed them</b> and you will receive your reward, <b>as it is stated: “Therefore will I divide him a portion among the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the mighty; because he bared his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors”</b> (Isaiah 53:12).

### Part 9
Rabbi Samlai proceeds to expound the verse <b>“Therefore will I divide him a portion among the great”</b> to mean that he will receive reward. One <b>might</b> have thought that he will receive reward <b>like the later ones and not like the earlier ones,</b> so <b>the verse states: “And he shall divide the spoil with the mighty,”</b> meaning <b>like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were mighty in Torah and in mitzvot. “Because he bared his soul unto death,”</b> meaning <b>he gave himself over to death</b> on behalf of the Jewish people, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Yet now, if You will forgive their sin; <b>and if not, blot me, I pray</b> You, out of Your book that You have written” (Exodus 32:32).

### Part 10
<b>“And was numbered with the transgressors,”</b> meaning <b>that he was counted among those who died in the desert,</b> for, just like them, he did not enter Eretz Yisrael. <b>“Yet he bore the sin of many,” as he atoned for the incident of the Golden Calf. “And made intercession [<i>yafgia</i>] for the transgressors,” as he requested mercy for the sinners of Israel</b> so <b>that they should engage in repentance. And</b> the word <b><i>pegia</i></b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>prayer, as it is stated: “Therefore pray not you for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession [<i>tifga</i>] to Me;</b> for I will not hear you” (Jeremiah 7:16).
