### Part 1
<b>because the beginning of fleeing</b> is <b>a downfall</b> on the battlefield, <b>as it is stated: “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people”</b> (I Samuel 4:17), <b>and</b> likewise <b>it says further on: “And the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain</b> in Mount Gilboa” (I Samuel 31:1).

### Part 2
The mishna adds: <b>In what</b> case <b>are</b> all of <b>these statements,</b> with regard to the various exemptions from war, <b>said?</b> They are said <b>with regard to elective wars. But in wars</b> whose mandate is <b>a mitzva, everyone goes, even a groom from his room and a bride from her wedding canopy. Rabbi Yehuda said: In what</b> case <b>are</b> all of <b>these statements,</b> with regard to the various exemptions from war, <b>said?</b> They are said <b>with regard to wars</b> whose mandate is <b>a mitzva. But in obligatory wars, everyone goes, even a groom from his room and a bride from her wedding canopy.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: With regard to their understanding that the “fearful and fainthearted” is referring to one harboring sins, <b>what</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei and</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili?</b> The Gemara answers: There is a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to <b>a sin</b> which violates a prohibition <b>by rabbinic law.</b> According to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, one who has violated a rabbinic law returns home, whereas Rabbi Yosei maintains that one returns home only if he has violated a Torah law, as in the case of a priest who has married a divorcée.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>spoke between</b> donning the <b>phylactery</b> of the arm <b>and</b> the <b>phylactery</b> of the head, he has <b>a sin on his hands, and due to</b> that sin <b>he returns from the ranks of</b> soldiers waging <b>war. In accordance with whose opinion</b> does this man return? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> who maintains that one returns even due to a minor transgression.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one heard the sound of trumpets and trembled;</b> or he heard <b>the knocking of shields and</b> he <b>trembled;</b> or he heard <b>the sharpening of swords, and urine</b> was <b>trickling down his knees</b> in fear, <b>he returns</b> from the battlefront. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this? <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>it is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who interprets “fearful and fainthearted” literally, <b>and</b> it is <b>not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>In this</b> case <b>even Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> would <b>concede</b> that he should return, <b>because it is written:</b> “What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? Let him go and return…<b>lest his brethren’s heart melt as his heart”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:8). Someone so clearly frightened invariably spreads his fear to those around him.

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches: <b>“And it shall be, when the officers conclude</b> speaking to the people, that captains of legions shall be appointed at the head of the people” (Deuteronomy 20:9), and that the guards have the license to beat the legs of anyone who attempts to turn back and flee from the war, because the beginning of fleeing is a downfall. The Gemara is puzzled by the language of the mishna: <b>This</b> phrase: <b>Because the beginning of fleeing</b> is <b>a downfall,</b> appears to be backward. The mishna <b>should have</b> said the opposite: <b>Because the beginning of the downfall</b> is the act of <b>fleeing.</b> The Gemara concedes: Indeed, <b>say</b> that the mishna means: <b>Because the beginning of the downfall</b> is the act of <b>fleeing.</b>

### Part 7
The mishna teaches: <b>In what</b> case <b>are these statements said?</b> They are said <b>with regard to elective wars,</b> as opposed to obligatory wars or wars whose mandate is a mitzva. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> concerning the various categories of war: The <b>elective</b> war referenced <b>by the Rabbis is</b> the same as a war whose mandate is <b>a mitzva</b> referenced <b>by Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and the war that is <b>a mitzva</b> mentioned <b>by the Rabbis is</b> the same as the <b>obligatory</b> war mentioned <b>by Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda is merely stating that the wars which the Rabbis call elective are to be seen as mandated by a mitzva.

### Part 8
<b>Rava said:</b> With respect to <b>the wars</b> that <b>Joshua</b> waged <b>to conquer</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>all agree</b> that they were <b>obligatory.</b> With respect to <b>the wars</b> waged by <b>the House of</b> King <b>David for</b> the sake of <b>territorial expansion, all agree</b> that they were <b>elective</b> wars. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is with regard to preventative wars that are waged <b>to reduce the gentiles so</b> that they will <b>not come</b> and wage war <b>against them.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>called this</b> type of war <b>a mitzva, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>called</b> it <b>an elective</b> war. There is <b>a practical difference</b> between these opinions with respect <b>to</b> the principle: <b>One who is engaged in a mitzva is exempt from</b> performing another <b>mitzva.</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda, one fighting in this kind of war is exempt from performing another mitzva.
