### Part 1
<b>And with what are we dealing here</b> in the mishna? A case <b>where a woman,</b> who is generally disqualified from bearing witness, <b>came initially,</b> and testified that the woman committed adultery, and two witnesses say that she did not.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> according to this interpretation you must <b>amend the</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Neḥemya</b> so that it reads <b>like this: Rabbi Neḥemya says: Wherever the Torah relies on one witness, follow the majority of opinions. And</b> the Sages <b>established</b> that <b>two women against one woman</b> are <b>like two men against one man. But two women</b> in opposition <b>to one man</b> that is a valid witness, <b>is like half</b> of a pair of witnesses <b>and a half</b> of a pair of witnesses, and the mishna did not address that case.

### Part 3
The Gemara poses a question on these two interpretations of the mishna: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>two</b> cases in the mishna to teach the <i>halakha</i> that the majority opinion of <b>those disqualified from</b> bearing <b>witness</b> is followed? The Gemara explains: It is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>when we follow the majority opinion</b> in the case of invalid witnesses, this is <b>to be stringent</b> to force the woman to drink the bitter water, e.g., if one witness said that she committed adultery and two said that she did not, <b>but to be lenient</b> and absolve her from having to drink the water we do <b>not</b> follow the majority opinion, and she would still drink the water even if there is one witness saying that she did not commit adultery, therefore the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that there is no difference in this regard, and the majority opinion is followed in any case.
