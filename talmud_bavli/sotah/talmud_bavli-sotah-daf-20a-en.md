### Part 1
The Gemara asks: The statement <b>of Rabbi Akiva</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as it is contradicted <b>by</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Akiva: There,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>he said</b> that <b>erasure prevents</b> the authorities from compelling the woman to drink the water if she retracted her decision to drink, <b>and here he says</b> that the sacrifice of the <b>handful prevents</b> the authorities from compelling the woman to drink the water. In other words, according to the first <i>baraita</i> the woman can retract her decision to drink until the scroll is erased, whereas according to the second <i>baraita</i> she can retract her decision until the handful is sacrificed.

### Part 2
The Gemara responds: There is a dispute between <b>two <i>tanna’im</i>, and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva.</b> They disagree with regard to what point in time, according to Rabbi Akiva, is the final moment at which a woman can refuse to drink the bitter water without being forced to do so.

### Part 3
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>she</b> initially <b>said: I will not drink, while in a state of</b> good <b>health, and</b> then <b>she retracted</b> her statement <b>and said: I will drink, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does one say that <b>when she said: I will not drink,</b> it is as if <b>she</b> confessed and <b>said: I am defiled, and since she established herself as defiled she cannot retract</b> her statement? <b>Or perhaps when she said: I will drink, she revealed her thoughts that it</b> was only <b>due to fear that she said</b> she will not drink? The Gemara concludes that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 4
<b>Shmuel’s father says:</b> It is <b>necessary</b> for one <b>to put a bitter</b> substance <b>into the water</b> that the <i>sota</i> drinks. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>as the verse states:</b> “And he shall blot them out into <b>the water of bitterness”</b> (Numbers 5:23), indicating <b>that</b> they <b>are already bitter</b> before the scroll is erased.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>before the scroll was erased she said: I will not drink, the scroll</b> that was written for <b>her is sequestered, and her meal-offering is</b> burned and <b>scattered over</b> the place of <b>the ashes, and her scroll is not fit to give</b> to <b>another <i>sota</i> to drink.</b> If <b>the scroll was erased and</b> afterward <b>she said: I am defiled, the water is poured out, and her meal-offering is scattered in the place of the ashes.</b> If <b>the scroll was</b> already <b>erased and she said: I will not drink, she is forced to drink against her will.</b>

### Part 6
When a guilty woman drinks <b>she does not manage to</b> finish <b>drinking before her face turns green and her eyes bulge, and her</b> skin becomes <b>full of</b> protruding <b>veins, and</b> the people standing in the Temple <b>say: Remove her,</b> so <b>that she does not render the Temple courtyard impure</b> by dying there.

### Part 7
The mishna limits the scope of the previous statement: <b>If she has merit, it delays</b> punishment <b>for her</b> and she does not die immediately. <b>There is a merit</b> that <b>delays</b> punishment for <b>one year, there is</b> a larger <b>merit</b> that <b>delays</b> punishment for <b>two years,</b> and <b>there is a merit</b> that <b>delays</b> punishment for <b>three years. From here Ben Azzai states: A person is obligated to teach his daughter Torah,</b> so <b>that if she drinks</b> and does not die immediately, <b>she will know that</b> some <b>merit</b> she has <b>delayed</b> punishment <b>for her. Rabbi Eliezer says: Anyone who teaches his daughter Torah is teaching her promiscuity [<i>tiflut</i>].</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: A woman desires to</b> receive the amount of <b>a <i>kav</i></b> of food <b>and a sexual relationship [<i>tiflut</i>]</b> rather <b>than</b> to receive <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of food <b>and abstinence. He would say: A foolish man of piety, and a conniving wicked person, and an abstinent woman [<i>perusha</i>], and those who injure</b> themselves out of false <b>abstinence;</b> all <b>these are</b> people <b>who erode the world.</b>

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says in the name of Rabbi Meir: When I was studying Torah before Rabbi Akiva,</b> as his disciple, <b>I used to put iron sulfate into the ink</b> with which I wrote Torah scrolls, <b>and he did not say anything to me</b> in protest. Afterward, <b>when I came</b> to learn Torah <b>before Rabbi Yishmael, he said to me: My son, what is your vocation? I said to him: I am a scribe [<i>lavlar</i>]</b> who writes Torah scrolls. <b>He said to me: My son, be careful</b> in your work, <b>as your work is the work of Heaven, lest you omit a single letter</b> from the Torah scroll <b>or add a single letter,</b> and in this <b>you are found to be destroying the entire world</b> if the mistake alters the meaning of the verse and results in blasphemy.

### Part 10
Rabbi Meir continues: <b>I said to</b> Rabbi Yishmael: <b>I have one substance that I put into the ink, and it is called iron sulfate,</b> which prevents the writing from being erased. <b>He said to me: And may iron sulfate be put into the ink? The Torah</b> clearly <b>said</b> with regard to the scroll of the <i>sota</i>: “And the priest shall write these curses in a scroll, <b>and he shall blot</b> them out into the water of bitterness” (Numbers 5:23). This indicates that the Torah requires <b>writing that can be blotted out.</b>

### Part 11
Since Rabbi Meir’s remark about iron sulfate seems unrelated to Rabbi Yishmael’s previous statement, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>saying to</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>and what is</b> Rabbi Meir <b>replying to</b> Rabbi Yishmael?

### Part 12
The Gemara explains: <b>This is what</b> Rabbi Meir <b>is saying to him: It is not necessary</b> to say that I do not err <b>in omissions and additions, as I am an expert. Rather,</b> there is not <b>even</b> any reason <b>for concern with regard to a fly lest</b> it <b>come and sit on the protrusion of</b> the letter <b><i>dalet</i> and erase it,</b> thereby <b>rendering it</b> the letter <b><i>reish</i>,</b> which could be a critical error. There is no concern of this erasure occurring, since <b>I have a certain substance that I put into the ink</b> and that prevents the writing from being erased, <b>and it is called iron sulfate.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara questions the initial part of Rabbi Meir’s statement: <b>Is that so? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir said: When I was studying Torah before Rabbi Yishmael, I used to put iron sulfate into the ink</b> with which I wrote Torah scrolls, <b>and he did not say anything to me.</b> Afterward, <b>when I came</b> to learn Torah <b>with Rabbi Akiva, he prohibited me</b> from doing <b>so.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara points out that there are two separate contradictions between the two statements: Rav Yehuda’s statement with regard to Rabbi Meir first <b>serving</b> Rabbi Akiva as a disciple is <b>difficult,</b> as it is contradicted <b>by</b> the statement of the <i>baraita</i> with regard to his first <b>serving</b> Rabbi Yishmael. Furthermore, Rav Yehuda’s statement is <b>difficult,</b> since he states that it was Rabbi Yishmael <b>who prohibited</b> the addition of iron sulfate, and this is contradicted <b>by</b> the statement of the <i>baraita</i> that it was Rabbi Akiva <b>who prohibited it.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: <b>Granted,</b> the apparent contradiction between Rav Yehuda’s statement with regard to Rabbi Meir’s <b>serving</b> Rabbi Akiva first, and the statement of the <i>baraita</i> with regard to <b>serving</b> Rabbi Yishmael first, poses <b>no difficulty. Initially, he came before Rabbi Akiva</b> to study, but <b>since he could not comprehend his</b> extremely complicated <b>method</b> of learning, <b>he came before Rabbi Yishmael and learned</b> the oral <b>tradition</b> from him. Afterward, <b>he returned</b> and <b>came before Rabbi Akiva</b> and <b>studied</b> his method of logical <b>reasoning</b> in order to understand the reasons behind the <i>halakhot</i> he had already learned.

### Part 16
<b>However,</b> the contradiction between Rav Yehuda’s statement that it was Rabbi Yishmael <b>who prohibited</b> the addition of iron sulfate and the statement of the <i>baraita</i> that it was Rabbi Akiva <b>who prohibited it</b> still poses a <b>difficulty.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, the matter is <b>difficult.</b>

### Part 17
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: Iron sulfate may be put into the ink</b> that is used <b>for all</b> sacred writings, i.e., Torah scrolls, phylacteries, and <i>mezuzot</i>,
