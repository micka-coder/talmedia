### Part 1
<b>should be from them;</b> one of the priests themselves should call: Priests. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Abaye,</b> that when only one priest is present, the prayer leader does not call: Priest. <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda,</b> as an Israelite may also call: Priests.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara cites <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the statements of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: <b>Desires the benediction, platform, during the service, cup, recognize, derives benefit, from a heifer.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, desires the Priestly Benediction? As it is stated: “So shall they put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them”</b> (Numbers 6:27). This shows that God waits for the priests to bless the people, and only then He Himself blesses them. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Any priest who blesses</b> the people <b>is blessed</b> from Heaven, <b>and one who does not bless</b> the people <b>is not blessed, as it is stated: “And I will bless those who bless you”</b> (Genesis 12:3).

### Part 4
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Any priest who does not ascend the platform</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction <b>violates three positive</b> mitzvot: <b>“So you shall bless,” “And you shall say to them”</b> (Numbers 6:23), and <b>“So shall they put My name”</b> (Numbers 6:27).

### Part 5
<b>Rav says:</b> One need be <b>concerned that</b> a priest who does not ascend to recite the Priestly Benediction <b>is perhaps the son of</b> a priest and <b>a divorced woman, or the son of</b> a priest and <b>a <i>yevama</i> who has performed <i>ḥalitza</i> [<i>ḥalutza</i>].</b> Perhaps he does not ascend to recite the Priestly Benediction because he is disqualified from the priesthood.

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: <b>And they do not disagree. This</b> statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is referring to a case <b>where he ascends periodically.</b> Therefore, there is no reason to believe that he is disqualified from the priesthood, and the assumption is that he violates three positive mitzvot. Whereas <b>that</b> statement of Rav is referring to a case <b>where one does not ascend</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction even <b>periodically,</b> and therefore there is reason to suspect that he is disqualified from the priesthood.

### Part 7
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Any priest who does not ascend</b> the platform <b>during</b> the blessing of <b>the</b> Temple <b>service</b> recited in the <i>Amida</i> prayer <b>may no longer ascend</b> to recite the benediction, <b>as it is stated: “And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings”</b> (Leviticus 9:22). <b>Just as there,</b> in the Tabernacle, Aaron lifted up his hands <b>during the service,</b> as evident from the fact that only after he blessed them does it say that he came down from sacrificing the offerings, <b>so too here,</b> in the <i>Amida</i> prayer, the Priestly Benediction is recited <b>during</b> the blessing of Temple <b>service.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t</b> the priests <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi ascend</b> after the blessing of the service? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi would begin walking</b> to the platform during the blessing of the service, but <b>they would not arrive there</b> until after the conclusion of this blessing. <b>And</b> this is sufficient <b>in accordance with what Rabbi Oshaya taught: They taught</b> that a priest may not recite the benediction if he did not ascend the platform during the blessing of Temple service <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he did not begin walking. But if he began walking</b> before the prayer leader finished the blessing, <b>he may ascend the platform</b> even after he has finished the blessing.

### Part 9
<b>And</b> concerning this issue, <b>we also learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Berakhot</i> 34a): A priest who serves as prayer leader does not recite the Priestly Benediction, but <b>if he is certain that he can lift his hands</b> and recite the benediction, <b>and</b> then <b>resume his prayer</b> without becoming confused, <b>he is permitted</b> to do so. <b>And we discussed it</b> and raised the following difficulty: If <b>he did not begin</b> walking to ascend the platform during the blessing of the service, how is it permitted for him to recite the benediction? <b>Rather,</b> it must be explained <b>that he moved slightly</b> to show that he also wanted to ascend the platform. <b>Here too,</b> the statement of Rabbi Oshaya is referring even to a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>uprooted</b> himself <b>slightly</b> from his place during the blessing of the service.

### Part 10
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: One may give a cup of blessing to recite the blessing</b> of Grace after Meals <b>only to</b> someone with <b>a good eye,</b> i.e., a generous person, <b>as it is stated: “One who has a good eye will be blessed [<i>yevorakh</i>], for he gives of his bread to the poor”</b> (Proverbs 22:9). <b>Do not read</b> it: “<b>Will be blessed.” Rather,</b> read it: <b>Will bless [<i>yevarekh</i>].</b>

### Part 11
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that even birds recognize miserly</b> people and do not eat the food they have set in bird traps? <b>As it is stated: “For in vain the net is spread in the eyes of any bird”</b> (Proverbs 1:17).

### Part 12
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Anyone who derives benefit from miserly people transgresses a prohibition, as it is stated: “Do not eat the bread of one who has an evil eye,</b> and do not desire his delicacies, <b>for as one that has reckoned within himself, so he is. He says to you: Eat and drink,</b> but his heart is not with you” (Proverbs 23:6–7). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: He transgresses two prohibitions,</b> as it says <b>“do not eat” and</b> also <b>“do not desire.”</b>

### Part 13
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> When a person is found slain between two cities and it is not known who killed him, <b>a heifer whose neck is broken is brought.</b> This occurs <b>only because of miserly people.</b>

### Part 14
<b>As it is stated: “And they shall speak and say: Our hands have not shed this blood”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:7). <b>But did it enter our hearts</b> to think <b>that the Elders of the court are murderers?</b> Why it is necessary for them to publicize that they did not kill him? <b>Rather,</b> they must declare: It is <b>not</b> so that this victim <b>came to us and we dismissed him, and</b> it is <b>not</b> so that <b>we saw him and left him.</b> In other words, <b>he did not come to us and we</b> in turn <b>dismissed him without food,</b> and <b>we did not see him and</b> then <b>leave him without an escort.</b> It is miserly people who do not provide others with food and cause them to travel to places where they might be murdered.

### Part 15
§ <b>Adda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Samlai says:</b> In <b>a synagogue that is</b> made up <b>entirely</b> of <b>priests, everyone ascends the platform</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction. The Gemara asks: If the entire congregation is composed of priests, <b>for whom do they utter the blessing? Rabbi Zeira says:</b> They say the blessing <b>for their brethren who are in the fields.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Abba, son of Rav Minyamin bar Ḥiyya, teach</b> that the <b>people who are</b> standing <b>behind</b> the backs of <b>the priests are not included in the</b> Priestly <b>Benediction?</b> The Gemara answers: That is <b>not difficult. This</b> is a case <b>where</b> the people <b>are compelled</b> to be in the fields because of their work, and they are therefore included in the benediction. Whereas <b>that</b> statement is referring to people <b>who are not compelled</b> to be away but still do not stand face-to-face with the priests. Consequently, they are not included in the benediction.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rav Shimi of Birte deShiḥorei teach</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: In <b>a synagogue that is</b> made up <b>entirely</b> of <b>priests, some of them ascend</b> to recite the benediction <b>and some of them answer amen?</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara answers: That is <b>not difficult. That</b> is a case <b>where,</b> if some of the priests recite the benediction, a quorum of <b>ten</b> priests still <b>remains</b> to receive the benediction and answer amen. Therefore, only some of the priests ascend to recite the benediction. By contrast, <b>this</b> case, which Rabbi Simlai was referring to, is a case <b>where</b> a quorum of <b>ten does not remain</b> to answer amen, so it is better for all of the priests to ascend and bless the people working in the fields.

### Part 19
The Gemara returns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> cited above: <b>Abba, son of Rav Minyamin bar Ḥiyya, taught:</b> The <b>people who are</b> standing <b>behind the priests are not included in the benediction.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara raises several questions with regard to this statement: It <b>is obvious</b> that <b>tall people</b> standing <b>in front of short people do not interpose</b> between the priests and the shorter people with regard to the Priestly Benediction. Similarly, <b>a chest</b> or ark containing a Torah scroll <b>does not interpose</b> between the priests and the people. However, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a partition? Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer from <b>what Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Even an iron partition does not interpose between the Jewish people and their Father in Heaven;</b> the people are included in the benediction.

### Part 21
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of people who are standing to <b>the sides</b> of the priests? Are they included in the blessing? <b>Abba Mar bar Rav Ashi said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 12:2) with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of sprinkling the waters of purification on vessels that contracted ritual impurity imparted by a corpse: If one <b>intended to sprinkle</b> the water <b>forward</b>
