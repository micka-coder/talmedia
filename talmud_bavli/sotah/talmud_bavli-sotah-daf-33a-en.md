### Part 1
that <b>the entire Torah may be recited in any language, as, if it should enter your mind</b> to say <b>that</b> the entire Torah <b>may be recited</b> only <b>in the sacred tongue</b> and not in any other language, <b>why do I</b> need <b>that which the Merciful One writes: “And</b> these words, which I command you this day, <b>will be”?</b> If in fact it is prohibited for one to recite any portion of the Torah in a language other than Hebrew, then prohibiting the recitation of <i>Shema</i> in a language other than Hebrew is superfluous. Since the Torah specifically requires <i>Shema</i> to be recited in Hebrew, it must be because the rest of the Torah may be recited in any language.

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: This is not unquestionably so, as the phrase “and these words, which I command you this day, will be” <b>is necessary</b> in this case <b>because “hear” is</b> also <b>written.</b> Had it not said “and these words, which I command you this day, will be,” it would have been derived from the word “hear” that <i>Shema</i> may be recited in any language, in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. Therefore, the phrase “and these words, which I command you this day, will be” is necessary.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>the entire Torah may be recited</b> only <b>in the sacred tongue</b> and not in any other language? <b>As, if it should enter your mind</b> to say <b>that</b> the Torah <b>may be recited in any language, why do I</b> need <b>that which the Merciful One writes: “Hear”?</b> It is permitted for one to recite the entire Torah in any language, rendering a specific requirement with regard to <i>Shema</i> superfluous.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this: The word “hear” <b>is necessary</b> in any case, <b>because “and</b> these words, which I command you this day, <b>will be” is</b> also <b>written.</b> Had it not been for the word “hear,” the Rabbis would have understood that it is prohibited to recite <i>Shema</i> in any other language, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. Therefore, the word “hear” is necessary.

### Part 5
§ It is stated in the mishna that the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer</b> may be recited in any language. The reason for this is that since prayer <b>is</b> a request for divine <b>mercy, one may pray in any way that one desires.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> may <b>prayer</b> really be recited <b>in any language? But didn’t Rav Yehuda say: A person should never request in the Aramaic language</b> that <b>his needs</b> be met, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that with regard to <b>anyone who requests in the Aramaic language</b> that <b>his needs</b> be met, <b>the ministering angels do not attend to him, as the ministering angels are not familiar [<i>makkirin</i>] with the Aramaic language?</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>that</b> statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring <b>to</b> the prayer of <b>an individual,</b> who needs the support of the angels, whereas <b>this</b> statement of the mishna is referring <b>to communal</b> prayer.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And are the ministering angels not familiar with the Aramaic language? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 13:5): <b>Yoḥanan the High Priest heard a Divine Voice</b> emerging <b>from the House of the Holy of Holies that was saying: The youth who went to wage war in Antokhya have been victorious. And</b> there was <b>another incident involving Shimon HaTzaddik, who heard a Divine Voice</b> emerging <b>from the House of the Holy of Holies that was saying: The decree that the enemy intended to bring against the Temple is annulled, and Gaskalgas,</b> Caligula, <b>has been killed and his decrees have been voided. And</b> people <b>wrote</b> down <b>that time</b> that the Divine Voice was heard, <b>and</b> later found that it <b>matched</b> exactly the moment that Caligula was killed. The Gemara concludes: <b>And</b> this Divine Voice <b>was speaking in the Aramaic language.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the <b>Divine Voice is different, as its purpose is to communicate</b> a message, and therefore it also communicates in Aramaic. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>it was</b> the angel <b>Gabriel, as the Master said</b> with regard to Joseph: <b>Gabriel came and taught him seventy languages,</b> as he knows all of the languages, as opposed to the other angels, who do not.

### Part 10
§ It is stated in the mishna that <b>Grace after Meals</b> may be recited in any language. <b>As it is written: “And you shall eat, and be satisfied, and bless the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:10). The word “bless” is homiletically interpreted to mean: <b>In any language that you bless.</b>

### Part 11
It is stated in the mishna that <b>an oath of testimony</b> may be said in any language, <b>as it is written: “And if anyone sins, in that he heard the voice of adjuration”</b> (Leviticus 5:1). The emphasis on hearing in the verse is interpreted to mean that it can be recited <b>in any language that a person hears,</b> i.e., understands.

### Part 12
It is stated in the mishna that <b>an oath on a deposit</b> may be taken in any language. This <b>is derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the word <b>“sins”</b> (Leviticus 5:21) that appears in the portion of an oath on a deposit, and the word <b>“sins”</b> (Leviticus 5:1) that is mentioned in the portion of <b>an oath of testimony.</b>

### Part 13
§ It is stated in the mishna: <b>And these are recited</b> only <b>in the sacred tongue: The recitation of</b> the verses that one recounts when bringing the <b>first fruits</b> to the Temple; <b>and <i>ḥalitza</i>…how</b> is it derived that the <b>recitation</b> when bringing the <b>first fruits</b> is recited specifically in Hebrew? When the Torah discusses this mitzva it states: <b>“And you shall speak and say before the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:5), <b>and below,</b> in the discussion of the blessings and curses, <b>it states: “And the Levites shall speak and say to all the men of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:14). <b>Just as there,</b> in the portion of the Levites, they speak <b>in the sacred tongue, so too here,</b> in the portion of the first fruits, the recitation is <b>in the sacred tongue.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that <b>the Levites themselves</b> answered in Hebrew? The Gemara answers: It is <b>derived from</b> a verbal analogy between the word <b>“voice”</b> that appears here, in the portion of the blessings and curses, and the word <b>“voice”</b> in the verse that relates to <b>Moses. It is written here: “With a loud voice”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:14), <b>and it is written there: “Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice”</b> (Exodus 19:19). <b>Just as there,</b> the Ten Commandments were stated <b>in the sacred tongue, so too here,</b> the Levites spoke <b>in the sacred tongue.</b>

### Part 15
It is stated in the mishna: <b>How</b> is it derived that the recitation at <b>a <i>ḥalitza</i></b> ceremony must be in Hebrew? The verse states: “And she shall speak and say: So shall it be done to the man that doth not build up his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). Rabbi Yehuda derives this <i>halakha</i> from the phrase: “And she shall speak and say: So” (Deuteronomy 25:9). The Gemara asks: <b>And what do the Rabbis do with,</b> i.e., how do they interpret, <b>this</b> word <b>“so”? They require</b> it <b>to</b> teach that any <b>matter</b> detailed in the portion <b>that is an action is indispensable</b> to the <i>ḥalitza</i> ceremony, as the verse states: “So shall it be done.” However, the other aspects of the ritual, e.g., the recitations, are not indispensable, and in their absence the ritual is valid after the fact.

### Part 16
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> derives this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the fact that the verse could have used the shorter form of the word <b>so [<i>ko</i>],</b> and instead uses the longer form of the word <b>so [<i>kakha</i>].</b> He therefore derives both <i>halakhot</i> from this word. <b>And the Rabbis do not learn anything from</b> the difference between <b><i>ko</i></b> and <b><i>kakha</i>.</b>
