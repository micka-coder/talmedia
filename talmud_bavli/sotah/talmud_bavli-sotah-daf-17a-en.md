### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>When</b> the priest <b>comes to write the scroll</b> of the <i>sota</i> that is to be placed in the water, <b>from what place</b> in the Torah passage concerning the <i>sota</i> (Numbers 5:11–31) <b>does he write?</b>

### Part 2
He starts <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“If no man has lain</b> with you, and if you have not gone astray to defilement while under your husband, you shall be free from this water of bitterness that causes the curse” (Numbers 5:19); and continues: <b>“But if you have gone astray while under your husband,</b> and if you are defiled, and some man has lain with you besides your husband” (Numbers 5:20).

### Part 3
<b>And</b> then <b>he does not write</b> the beginning of the following verse, which states: <b>“Then the priest shall cause the woman to swear</b> with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say to the woman” (Numbers 5:21), <b>but he does write</b> the oath recorded in the continuation of the verse: <b>“The Lord shall make you a curse and an oath</b> among your people when the Lord will cause your thigh to fall away, and your belly to swell. <b>And this water that causes the curse shall go into your bowels, and cause your belly to swell, and your thigh to fall away”</b> (Numbers 5:21–22); <b>but he does not write</b> the conclusion of the verse: <b>“And the woman shall say: Amen, amen”</b> (Numbers 5:22).

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: He does not interrupt</b> the verses but rather writes the entire passage without any omissions.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He writes nothing other</b> than curses recorded in the final verses cited above: <b>“The Lord shall make you a curse and an oath</b> among your people when the Lord will cause your thigh to fall away, and your belly to swell. <b>And this water that causes the curse shall go into your bowels,</b> and cause your belly to swell, and your thigh to fall away.” <b>And he does not write</b> the conclusion of the verse: <b>“And the woman shall say: Amen, amen.”</b>

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>With regard to what</b> issue <b>do</b> the Sages in the mishna <b>disagree?</b> What is the source of their disagreement? <b>They disagree concerning the</b> proper interpretation of the <b>verse: “And the priest shall write these [<i>ha’eleh</i>] curses [<i>et ha’alot</i>] in a scroll”</b> (Numbers 5:23).

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Meir,</b> the first <i>tanna</i> of the mishna, <b>reasons:</b> The word <b>“<i>alot</i>,”</b> curses, is referring to <b>actual curses.</b> The prefix <i>ha</i>, meaning: The, in the word <b>“<i>ha’alot</i>”</b> serves <b>to include curses that come on account of</b> the <b>blessings,</b> i.e., the curses that are inferred from the phrase: “You shall be free from this water of bitterness that causes the curse” (5:19). The word <b>“<i>eleh</i>,”</b> meaning these, is a limiting term that serves <b>to exclude the</b> long list of <b>curses that are</b> recorded <b>in <i>Mishne Torah</i>,</b> the book of Deuteronomy (chapter 28). Although these curses are also referred to as “<i>alot</i>,” the priest does not write them. The addition of the definite article in the word <b>“<i>ha’eleh</i>”</b> serves <b>to exclude the commands</b> recorded in the <i>sota</i> passage <b>and the acceptances</b> by the word <b>“amen”</b> recorded there as well. The priest need not write these sections of the passage.

### Part 8
<b>And Rabbi Yosei</b> interprets it: <b>It</b> would <b>all</b> be <b>as you,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>said;</b> however, the additional word <b>“<i>et</i>”</b> in the verse amplifies its scope. It serves <b>to include</b> both <b>commands and acceptances,</b> as they must be written in the scroll as well.

### Part 9
<b>And</b> why does <b>Rabbi Meir</b> disagree? As a rule, he <b>does not interpret</b> the additional word <b><i>et</i></b> as amplifying a verse’s scope.

### Part 10
<b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yehuda, he interprets all of</b> the terms in the verse <b>as exclusionary:</b> The word <b>“<i>alot</i>”</b> is referring specifically to the <b>actual curses</b> recorded in the verses. The definite article in the word <b>“<i>ha’alot</i>”</b> serves <b>to exclude curses that come on account of blessings.</b> The word <b>“<i>eleh</i>”</b> serves <b>to exclude the curses</b> recorded <b>in</b> the <b><i>Mishne Torah</i>.</b> And the definite article in the word <b>“<i>ha’eleh</i>”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> the <b>commands and acceptances</b> recorded in the verses.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to <b>Rabbi Meir, what is different</b> about <b>this</b> letter <b><i>heh</i></b> at the beginning of the word “<i>ha’alot</i>” such <b>that it amplifies</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include curses that come on account of the blessings, <b>and what is different</b> about <b>that</b> letter <b><i>heh</i></b> in the word “<i>ha’eleh</i>” such <b>that it excludes</b> the commands and acceptances by the word “amen”? Why should one amplify while the other excludes?

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: The letter <b><i>heh</i> when</b> written <b>near an amplifier is an amplifier.</b> The word “<i>alot</i>” itself amplifies the <i>halakha</i>, and the definite article extends that amplification; and a <b><i>heh</i> when</b> written <b>near</b> a <b>restrictor is a restrictor.</b> The word “<i>eleh</i>” itself restricts the <i>halakha</i>, and the definite article before it extends that restriction.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>But Rabbi Meir does not</b> accept the principle that <b>from a negative</b> statement <b>you</b> can <b>infer a positive</b> statement. What is to be gained by writing the blessings if one cannot infer the curses from them?

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Tanḥum says: It is written:</b> “If no man has lain with you…<b>you shall be free [<i>hinnaki</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:19). The word “<i>hinnaki</i>” should be interpreted as if it were in fact <i>ḥinnaki</i>, meaning: You shall choke. When read with the beginning of the next verse, it then forms the sentence: You shall choke… if you have gone astray while under your husband. Therefore, Rabbi Meir understands the blessings themselves to have a dimension of a curse.

### Part 15
§ <b>Rabbi Akiva taught:</b> If <b>a man [<i>ish</i>] and woman [<i>isha</i>] merit</b> reward through a faithful marriage, <b>the Divine Presence</b> rests <b>between them.</b> The words <i>ish</i> and <i>isha</i> are almost identical; the difference between them is the middle letter <i>yod</i> in <i>ish</i>, and the final letter <i>heh</i> in <i>isha</i>. These two letters can be joined to form the name of God spelled <i>yod</i>, <i>heh</i>. But if due to licentiousness <b>they do not merit</b> reward, the Divine Presence departs, leaving in each word only the letters <i>alef</i> and <i>shin</i>, which spell <i>esh</i>, fire. Therefore, <b>fire consumes them.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rava said: And</b> the fire <b>that</b> consumes <b>the woman is stronger</b> and more immediate <b>than that</b> which consumes <b>the man. What is the reason</b> for this? The letters <i>alef</i> and <i>shin</i> in the word <i>isha</i> <b>are</b> adjacent, <b>joined</b> together, <b>but</b> in the word <i>ish</i> <b>they are not joined,</b> as the letter <i>yod</i> is written between them.

### Part 17
Additionally, <b>Rava says: For what</b> reason <b>did the Torah say: Bring dust for the <i>sota</i>?</b> It is because if <b>she merits</b> to be proven faith-ful after drinking the water of the <i>sota</i>, <b>a child like our Patriarch Abraham will emerge from her, as it is written with regard to</b> Abraham that he said: “I am but <b>dust and ashes”</b> (Genesis 18:27). But <b>if she does not merit</b> to be proven faithful after drinking the water of the <i>sota</i>, <b>she shall</b> die and <b>return to her dust,</b> the soil from which mankind was formed.

### Part 18
And <b>Rava</b> further <b>taught: As reward</b> for that <b>which our Patriarch Abraham said: “And I am but dust and ashes”</b> (Genesis 18:27), <b>his children merited two mitzvot: The ashes of the</b> red <b>heifer</b> (see Numbers, chapter 19) <b>and the dust of the <i>sota</i>.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>But there is also</b> another mitzva involving dust: <b>The dust</b> used for <b>covering the blood</b> of a slaughtered undomesticated animal or fowl (see Leviticus 17:13).

### Part 20
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the dust <b>does</b> serve as an <b>accessory to the mitzva</b> of covering the blood, but <b>there is no benefit</b> imparted by it. It occurs after the animal has been slaughtered and does not itself render the meat fit for consumption.

### Part 21
<b>Rava</b> further <b>taught: As reward</b> for that <b>which our Patriarch Abraham said</b> to the king of Sodom: <b>“That</b> I will not take <b>a thread nor a shoe strap</b> nor anything that is yours” (Genesis 14:23), distancing himself from anything not rightfully his, <b>his children merited two mitzvot: The thread of sky-blue</b> wool worn on ritual fringes <b>and the strap of phylacteries.</b>

### Part 22
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, the strap of</b> the <b>phylacteries</b> impart benefit, <b>as it is written: “And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon you;</b> and they shall be afraid of you” (Deuteronomy 28:10). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: This is</b> a reference to <b>the phylacteries of the head,</b> upon which the name of God is written. Phylacteries therefore impart the splendor and grandeur of God and are a fit reward.

### Part 23
<b>But what is</b> the benefit imparted by <b>the thread of sky-blue</b> wool? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: What is different about sky-blue from all other colors</b> such that it was specified for the mitzva of ritual fringes?

### Part 24
It is <b>because sky-blue</b> dye <b>is similar</b> in its color <b>to the sea, and the sea is similar to the sky, and the sky is similar to the Throne of Glory, as it is stated: “And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under His feet the like of a paved work of sapphire stone, and the like of the very heaven for clearness”</b> (Exodus 24:10). This verse shows that the heavens are similar to sapphire, <b>and it is written:</b> “And above the firmament that was over their heads was <b>the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone”</b> (Ezekiel 1:26). Therefore, the throne is similar to the heavens. The color of sky blue dye acts as an indication of the bond between the Jewish people and the Divine Presence.

### Part 25
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The priest <b>does not write</b> the scroll of the <i>sota</i> <b>upon</b> a wooden <b>tablet, and not upon paper</b> made from grass, <b>and not upon</b>
