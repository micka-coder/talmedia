### Part 1
<b>her face becomes sallow</b> after drinking the bitter water; <b>she painted her eyes for</b> her paramour, <b>therefore her eyes bulge</b> after she drinks; <b>she braided her hair for</b> her paramour, <b>therefore a priest unbraids her hair</b> and makes it disheveled; <b>she indicated to</b> her paramour <b>with a finger</b> that he should come to her, <b>therefore her fingernails fall off; she girded herself for</b> her paramour <b>with a ribbon</b> as a belt, <b>therefore a priest brings an Egyptian rope and ties</b> it <b>for her above her breasts; she extended her thigh for</b> her paramour, <b>therefore her thigh falls away</b> after drinking.

### Part 2
<b>She received</b> her paramour <b>upon her stomach, therefore her stomach swells; she fed him delicacies of the world, therefore her offering</b> is <b>animal food,</b> as it is from oats; <b>she gave him fine wine to drink in fine cups, therefore a priest gives her bitter water in an earthenware <i>mekeida</i>,</b> a simple clay vessel, <b>to drink.</b>

### Part 3
<b>She acted in secret;</b> therefore, God, referred to in the verse <b>“Who dwell in secret, with the Most High”</b> (Psalms 91:1), <b>turns</b> His <b>face to her, as it is stated: “The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying: No eye shall see me;</b> and the Hidden Face will turn” (Job 24:15). The adulterer acts in the twilight of the night to act in secrecy, and therefore God, Who is concealed, arranges that the matter is revealed in public.

### Part 4
<b>Alternatively, she acted in secret,</b> and therefore <b>the Omnipresent revealed it in the open, as it is stated: “Though his hatred be concealed with deceit, his wickedness shall be revealed before the congregation”</b> (Proverbs 26:26), i.e., concealed acts of sin are ultimately revealed in public.

### Part 5
§ The Gemara questions the need for two verses to indicate that small transgressions are addressed through one significant punishment. <b>And since Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>derives</b> that small transgressions are combined and punished together <b>from:</b> “Behold, this have I found, says Koheleth, <b>adding one thing to another, to find out the account”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:27), <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“For every boot stamped with fierceness”</b> (Isaiah 9:4)? The Gemara answers: This verse serves <b>to</b> teach that even small transgressions are punished <b>by the measure,</b> i.e., with a punishment appropriate to the transgression.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And since he derives it from “for every boot stamped with fierceness,” why do I</b> need <b>“in full measure, when you send her away, you contend with her”</b> (Isaiah 27:8)?

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: This verse serves <b>to</b> teach the statement <b>as</b> taught <b>by Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa, for Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, does not punish a nation</b> deserving of punishment <b>until its time to be banished,</b> i.e., until the time of its final eradication from the world, <b>as it is stated: “In full measure, when you send her away,</b> you contend with her” (Isaiah 27:8).

### Part 8
<b>Is that so? But didn’t Rava say: Why</b> are there specifically <b>three cups</b> of misfortune <b>that are stated with regard to Egypt</b> in the dream of its chief butler (see Genesis 40:11–13)? They are an allusion to three cups of misfortune that would later befall Egypt: <b>One that it drank in the days of Moses</b> during the ten plagues and the Exodus; <b>one that it drank in the days of Pharaoh Neco,</b> the king of Egypt who was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar; <b>and one that it will drink in the future with its companions,</b> i.e., the other nations, when they are punished during the days of the Messiah. This indicates that nations can be punished several times, not only when they are eradicated.

### Part 9
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>those</b> ancient Egyptians, <b>have gone, and these</b> later Egyptians <b>are different ones, but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Kiddushin</i> 4:3): <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Minyamin, an Egyptian convert, was a friend of mine from among the students of Rabbi Akiva,</b> and <b>Minyamin the Egyptian convert said:</b> After I converted <b>I</b> was <b>a first-</b>generation <b>Egyptian</b> convert, <b>and</b> so <b>I married</b> another <b>first-</b>generation <b>Egyptian</b> convert. <b>I will marry off my son,</b> who is <b>a second-</b>generation Egyptian convert, <b>to</b> another <b>second-</b>generation <b>Egyptian</b> convert, <b>in order that my son’s son will be permitted to enter into the congregation.</b> The Torah prohibits Egyptian converts before the third generation to enter into the congregation (see Deuteronomy 23:8–9). By Minyamin’s observance of this prohibition even during the time of Rabbi Akiva, it indicates that Egypt during the tannaitic period was still viewed as biblical Egypt.

### Part 10
<b>Rather, if</b> anything <b>was stated</b> with regard to the delay of punishment, it <b>was stated like this: Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, does not punish</b> a sinful <b>king until his time to be banished, as it is stated: “In full measure, when you send her away, you contend with her”</b> (Isaiah 27:8).

### Part 11
<b>Ameimar teaches that</b> statement <b>of Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa with regard to this: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For I the Lord change not; and you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed”</b> (Malachi 3:6)? <b>“For I the Lord change [<i>shaniti</i>] not”</b> is interpreted to mean: <b>I did not strike a nation and repeat [<i>shaniti</i>]</b> striking <b>it,</b> as a stricken nation never recovers from the initial strike. <b>“And you, sons of Jacob, are not consumed,”</b> is interpreted to mean: Despite the fact that I strike you many times for your sins, I do not let you perish. <b>This is</b> the same <b>as that which is written:</b> “I will heap evils upon them; <b>I will consume My arrows upon them”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:23), which is interpreted to mean: <b>My arrows are consumed</b> and used up, <b>and they,</b> the Jewish people, <b>are not consumed</b> but will continue to endure despite the many calamities that will befall them.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Hamnuna says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, does not punish a person until his <i>se’a</i>,</b> the measure that is suitable for him, <b>is filled, as it is stated: “In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits;</b> the hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him” (Job 20:22). In other words, when the sufficient measure of sin has been reached, then the trouble will overtake him.

### Part 13
Having mentioned Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa, the Gemara quotes another of his interpretations. <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous, praise is comely for the upright [<i>nava tehilla</i>]”</b> (Psalms 33:1)? <b>Do not read</b> the conclusion of the verse as: <b>Praise is comely [<i>nava</i>]; rather,</b> read it as: <b>A house [<i>naveh</i>] of praise. This</b> is referring to <b>Moses and David, whose enemies did not rule over their achievements,</b> as they each built a <i>naveh</i>, a house for the Lord, and this house remained in existence.

### Part 14
With regard to <b>David,</b> the citadel that housed his home and city, was not destroyed, <b>as it is written: “Her gates are sunk into the ground”</b> (Lamentations 2:9), as the gates of Jerusalem built by David were not destroyed by enemies, but sunk into the ground and were buried there. This is also so with regard to <b>Moses, as the Master said: When the first Temple was built, the Tent of Meeting was sequestered,</b> including <b>its boards, its clasps, and its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Where</b> is it sequestered? <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Avimi says: Beneath the tunnels of the Sanctuary.</b>

### Part 15
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (4:16–19): The <b><i>sota</i> placed her eyes,</b> fixed her gaze, <b>on one who is unfit for her,</b> i.e., another man, so this is her punishment: <b>That which she desired,</b> i.e., to be with her paramour, <b>is not given to her,</b> as she becomes forbidden to him forever. <b>And that which she had,</b> i.e., her husband, <b>was taken away from her,</b> as she is now forbidden to him as well. This teaches <b>that anyone who places his eyes on that which is not his is not given what he desires, and that which he had is taken from him.</b>
