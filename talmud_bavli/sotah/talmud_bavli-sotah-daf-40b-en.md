### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> does the practice in the Temple differ <b>so much</b> from outside the Temple? <b>Because one does not answer amen in the Temple,</b> and therefore there is no pause between the blessings.

### Part 2
<b>The Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one does not answer amen in the Temple? As it is stated: “Stand up and bless the Lord, your God, from everlasting to everlasting”</b> (Nehemiah 9:5). This blessing is recited instead of amen in the Temple. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that for each and every blessing</b> in the Temple the people respond with these words of <b>praise? As it is stated: “And let them say: Blessed be Your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise”</b> (Nehemiah 9:5). This verse indicates that <b>for each and every blessing,</b> you should <b>give Him praise.</b> However, those present do not respond amen.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>How</b> are <b>the blessings of the High Priest</b> recited on Yom Kippur? <b>The synagogue attendant takes a Torah scroll and gives it to the head of the synagogue</b> that stands on the Temple Mount, <b>and the head of the synagogue gives it to the deputy</b> High Priest, <b>and the deputy</b> High Priest <b>gives it to the High Priest.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And the High Priest stands; and receives</b> the Torah scroll; <b>and reads</b> the Torah portion beginning with the verse: <b>“After the death”</b> (Leviticus 16:1–34), <b>and</b> the portion beginning with the verse: <b>“But on the tenth”</b> (Leviticus 23:26–32); <b>and furls the Torah</b> scroll; <b>and places it on his bosom; and says: More than what I have read before you is written here. He</b> then <b>reads by heart</b> the portion beginning with: <b>“And on the tenth,” from the book of Numbers</b> (see 29:7–11).

### Part 5
<b>And</b> after the reading the High Priest <b>recites</b> the following <b>eight blessings:</b> A blessing <b>concerning the Torah, and concerning the</b> Temple <b>service, and concerning thanksgiving, and concerning forgiveness for iniquity, and concerning the Temple, and concerning the Jewish people, and concerning the priests, and concerning Jerusalem, and the rest of the prayer.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>You can learn from</b> the fact that the head of the synagogue and the deputy High Priest receive the Torah scroll before the High Priest that <b>honor may be given to a student in the presence of the teacher.</b> Although the High Priest is considered everyone’s teacher and master, honor was nevertheless extended to other individuals in his presence without fear of impugning the High Priest’s honor.

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said:</b> A proof may not be adduced from here. Usually one does not show honor for a student in the presence of the teacher, but here the <b>entire</b> process <b>is for the honor of the High Priest.</b> The passing of the Torah scroll to people of increasing importance demonstrates that the High Priest is considered the most important of all those present.

### Part 8
It is stated in the mishna: <b>And the High Priest stands, and receives</b> the Torah scroll, <b>and reads</b> from it. The Gemara asks: From the fact that he stands, it can be understood <b>by inference</b> that until that point <b>he</b> had been <b>sitting. But didn’t the Master say</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 4:4) that <b>sitting in</b> the Temple <b>courtyard</b> is permitted <b>only for kings from the house of David, as it is stated: “Then King David went in, and sat before the Lord; and he said: Who am I,</b> O Lord God, and what is my house, that You have brought me thus far?” (II Samuel 7:18).

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>As Rav Ḥisda said</b> in a similar context: This took place not in the Israelite courtyard, where the prohibition against sitting applies, but <b>in the women’s courtyard. Here, too,</b> the reading was <b>in the women’s courtyard,</b> where it is permitted to sit, as it does not have the sanctified status of the Temple itself.

### Part 10
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:13): <b>And where does</b> the High Priest <b>read</b> from the Torah scroll? He reads from it <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> He reads from it <b>on the Temple Mount, as it is stated:</b>
