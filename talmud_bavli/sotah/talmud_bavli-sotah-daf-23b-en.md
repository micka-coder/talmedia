### Part 1
<b>And even the Rabbis do not disagree with Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, except with regard to the meal-offering of a sinner</b> who is <b>a priest, as</b> they hold that <b>it is fit to be sacrificed</b> in its entirety without removing a handful. <b>However, in this</b> case, i.e., in the case of the meal-offering of a <i>sota</i> who is married to a priest, <b>even the Rabbis agree</b> that its remainder is scattered on the place of the ashes, since the handful is removed from the offering.

### Part 2
§ The mishna states: In the case of <b>an Israelite woman who is married</b> to a priest, her meal-offering is burned; and in the case of the daughter of a priest who is married to an Israelite, her meal-offering is eaten. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? This is <b>as the verse states: “And every meal-offering of a priest shall be completely burned; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16). One can infer that this applies to <b>a priest, but not</b> to <b>the daughter of a priest.</b>

### Part 3
The mishna states: The <b>daughter of a priest can become disqualified</b> from marrying a priest and from partaking of <i>teruma</i> by engaging in sexual intercourse with someone forbidden to her, but <b>a priest does not become desacralized</b> by engaging in sexual intercourse with a woman forbidden to him. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? It is <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to a priest who marries a woman forbidden to him: <b>“And he shall not disqualify his offspring among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:15), indicating that <b>his offspring</b> from forbidden intercourse <b>are desacralized, but he is not</b> personally <b>desacralized</b> through his actions.

### Part 4
The mishna states: <b>A daughter of a priest may become impure</b> with impurity imparted by a corpse, but a priest may not. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron,</b> and say to them: None shall become impure for the dead among his people” (Leviticus 21:1). The verse indicates that this applies to <b>the sons of Aaron and not</b> to <b>the daughters of Aaron.</b>

### Part 5
The mishna states: <b>A priest may eat from offerings of the most sacred order,</b> but a daughter of a priest may not eat from offerings of the most sacred order. The Gemara explains: This is derived <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the meal-offering, which is an offering of the most sacred order: <b>“Every male among the children of Aaron may eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 6:11).

### Part 6
§ The mishna states: <b>And what</b> are the halakhic differences <b>between a man</b> and a woman? A man lets his hair grow and rends his garments when he is a leper, but a woman does not. <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “He is a leprous <b>man,</b> he is impure” (Leviticus 13:44). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of a confirmed leper apply to <b>a man; from where</b> do I derive that they apply to <b>a woman? When it says</b> in the subsequent verse: <b>“And the leper in whom</b> the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall grow wild and he shall cover his upper lip; and he shall cry: Impure, impure” (Leviticus 13:45), <b>there are two</b> individuals indicated <b>here,</b> as this verse did not need to restate “and the leper,” as the subject of the verse was clear from the previous verse.

### Part 7
<b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> A leprous <b>“man”?</b> This is referring <b>to the matter</b> of rending one’s clothes and letting one’s hair grow wild, <b>which</b> is stated in the verse <b>below,</b> and teaches that <b>a man lets</b> the hair of his head <b>grow</b> and rends his garments, but a woman does not.

### Part 8
The mishna states: <b>A man can vow</b> that <b>his</b> minor <b>son</b> shall <b>be a nazirite, but a woman cannot vow</b> that <b>her son</b> shall <b>be a nazirite. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted orally to Moses from Sinai <b>with regard to</b> the <b>nazirite,</b> and it is not derived from the Bible. The mishna states: <b>A man can shave</b> at the culmination of his naziriteship <b>by</b> using offerings designated for <b>his father’s naziriteship, but a woman cannot shave by</b> using offerings designated for <b>her father’s naziriteship. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted orally to Moses from Sinai <b>with regard to</b> the <b>nazirite,</b> and it is not derived from the Bible.

### Part 9
The mishna states: <b>A man can betroth his daughter</b> to another man while she is a minor, <b>but a woman cannot betroth her daughter.</b> The Gemara explains: This is <b>as it is written:</b> “And the father of the maiden shall say to the elders: <b>I gave my daughter to this man</b> as a wife” (Deuteronomy 22:16), indicating that it is only the father who has the power to betroth his daughter. The mishna states: <b>A man can sell his daughter</b> as a maidservant <b>but a woman cannot sell her daughter.</b> The Gemara explains: This is derived <b>as it is written: “And if a man sells his daughter</b> to be a maidservant” (Exodus 21:7), indicating that only a man can sell his daughter, while a woman cannot.

### Part 10
§ The mishna states: <b>A man is stoned naked,</b> but a woman is not stoned naked. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers: The verse states: <b>“And</b> let the entire congregation <b>stone him”</b> (Leviticus 24:14). <b>What</b> does the term <b>“him”</b> come to exclude? <b>If we say</b> this means that they stone <b>him but not her,</b> i.e., that a woman is not stoned at all, <b>but isn’t it written: “And you shall take out that man or that woman,</b> who did this evil thing, to your gates, that man or that woman; and you shall stone them with stones, and they shall die” (Deuteronomy 17:5). <b>Rather,</b> the term <b>“him”</b> excludes his garment, indicating that he is stoned <b>without his garment. And</b> a woman is excluded from this <i>halakha</i>, as one may infer from the term “him” that they do <b>not</b> stone <b>her without her garment.</b>

### Part 11
The mishna states: <b>A man is hanged, but</b> a woman is <b>not</b> hanged. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The verse states:</b> “And if a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death, <b>and you shall hang him on a tree”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:22). The verse indicates that one should hang <b>“him,”</b> a man, <b>but not her,</b> a woman.

### Part 12
The mishna states: <b>A man is sold for his</b> committing an act of <b>theft, but a woman is not sold for her</b> committing an act of <b>theft.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The verse states:</b> “If the sun rose upon him, there is blood-guilt for him; he shall make restitution; if he has nothing, <b>then he shall be sold for his theft”</b> (Exodus 22:2). The verse indicates that he is sold <b>for his theft, but</b> she is <b>not</b> sold <b>for her theft.</b>
