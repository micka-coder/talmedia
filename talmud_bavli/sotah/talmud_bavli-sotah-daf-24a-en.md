### Part 1
<b>or Gibeonite woman</b> who was married <b>to a Jew</b> of unflawed lineage, <b>or a Jewish woman</b> of unflawed lineage who was married <b>to a <i>mamzer</i> or a Gibeonite,</b> all of these women <b>neither drink</b> the bitter water <b>nor collect</b> payment of their <b>marriage contracts,</b> as the <i>sota</i> ritual applies only to permitted marriages.

### Part 2
<b>And the following</b> women <b>neither drink</b> the bitter water <b>nor collect</b> payment of their <b>marriage contracts:</b> A woman <b>who</b> confesses and <b>says: I am defiled, and</b> a woman <b>with regard to whom witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that she is defiled, and</b> a woman <b>who says: I will not drink</b> the bitter water, even if she does not confess her guilt.

### Part 3
However, a woman whose <b>husband said: I will not have</b> her <b>drink, and</b> a woman <b>whose husband engaged in sexual intercourse with her on the way</b> to the Temple, <b>collect</b> payment of their <b>marriage contracts</b> even though <b>they do not drink</b> the bitter water, as it is due to the husbands that they do not drink.

### Part 4
If <b>the husbands</b> of <i>sota</i> women <b>died before</b> their wives <b>drank</b> the bitter water, <b>Beit Shammai say: They collect</b> payment of their <b>marriage contracts and they do not drink</b> the bitter water. <b>And Beit Hillel say: They either drink</b> the bitter water <b>or they do not collect</b> payment of <b>their marriage contracts.</b>

### Part 5
<b>A woman who was pregnant</b> with the child <b>of another</b> man at the time of her marriage <b>and a woman who was nursing</b> the child <b>of another</b> man at the time of her marriage <b>neither drink</b> the bitter water <b>nor collect</b> payment of their <b>marriage contracts.</b> This is because by rabbinic law they may not marry for twenty-four months after the baby’s birth, and therefore these also constitute prohibited marriages. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: He can separate</b> from <b>her, and remarry her after</b> the <b>time</b> of twenty-four months has elapsed, and therefore these are considered permitted marriages, and the women can drink the bitter water.

### Part 6
<b>A sexually underdeveloped woman</b> who is incapable of bearing children <b>[<i>ailonit</i>], and an elderly woman, and</b> a woman <b>who is incapable of giving birth</b> for other reasons, <b>neither collect</b> payment of their <b>marriage contracts nor drink</b> the bitter water, as marrying a woman who cannot give birth constitutes a violation of the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: He can marry another woman and procreate through her;</b> therefore, these are considered permitted marriages, and women in these categories can drink the bitter water.

### Part 7
<b>And all other women either drink</b> the bitter water <b>or do not collect</b> payment of their <b>marriage contracts. The wife of a priest drinks, and</b> if she is found to be innocent of adultery, she <b>is permitted to her husband. The wife of a eunuch</b> also <b>drinks.</b>

### Part 8
A husband <b>can issue a warning</b> to his wife forbidding her to seclude herself with any man, even <b>with regard to all those</b> men <b>with whom relations are forbidden,</b> e.g., her father or brother, with the <b>exception of a minor and of one who is not a man,</b> i.e., in a situation where a man suspects his wife of bestiality.

### Part 9
<b>And these</b> are the women <b>to whom the court issues a warning</b> in place of their husbands: <b>One whose husband became a deaf-mute or became an imbecile, or was incarcerated in prison.</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that the court warns her <b>not</b> in order <b>to have her drink</b> the bitter water if she disobeys the warning, <b>but</b> in order <b>to disqualify her from</b> receiving payment of <b>her marriage contract. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The court’s warning <b>also</b> serves <b>to have her drink,</b> and <b>when her husband is released from prison he has her drink.</b>

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that a betrothed woman and a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> do not drink the bitter water. The Gemara infers: <b>She does not drink, but</b> the husband or <i>yavam</i> <b>can warn her</b> against secluding herself with another man, and if she violates his warning, she is forbidden to him. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: This is derived <b>as the Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“Speak to the children of Israel and say</b> unto them: If the wife of any man goes astray, and acts unfaithfully against him” (Numbers 5:12). The superfluous phrase “and say unto them” is an amplification, and serves <b>to include a betrothed woman and a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>warning.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And whose</b> opinion is expressed in the <b>mishna? It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And the priest shall cause her to swear, and shall say to the woman: If no man has lain with you, and if you have not gone aside to defilement <b>while under your husband”</b> (Numbers 5:19). This <b>excludes a betrothed woman,</b> who does not yet live with her betrothed, from the ritual of the bitter water. One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I exclude even a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i>;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “If the wife of <b>any man</b> goes astray” (Numbers 5:12). The term “any man” serves to include a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> in the ritual of the bitter water. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> The phrase <b>“while under your husband” excludes a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i></b> from drinking the bitter water. Lest one would say that <b>I will exclude a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> but I will not exclude a betrothed woman, the verse</b> therefore <b>states:</b> “This is the law of jealousy, <b>when a wife, while under her husband, goes astray,</b> and is defiled” (Numbers 5:29). The term “while under her husband” <b>excludes a betrothed woman</b> from drinking the bitter water.

### Part 13
The Gemara explains the dispute: One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yonatan, holds that the bond with the <b>betrothed woman is stronger, as</b> it is <b>his</b> own <b>betrothal,</b> whereas in the case of a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i>, the bond stems from his brother’s betrothal. <b>And</b> furthermore, if the betrothed woman commits adultery, she <b>is stoned due to</b> her bond with <b>him,</b> whereas a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> who engages in sexual intercourse with another man is liable only to receive lashes. Since the bond with the betrothed woman is stronger, Rabbi Yonatan derives from the phrase “while under your husband” that a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> is excluded with respect to the bitter water, whereas a betrothed woman is excluded only because of the phrase “and say unto them.”

### Part 14
<b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoshiya, holds that the bond with the <b>widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> is stronger, as she is not lacking entry into the wedding canopy,</b> as her marriage to the <i>yavam</i> is completed through sexual intercourse alone. Rabbi Yoshiya therefore excludes only a betrothed woman from drinking the bitter water.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yonatan,</b> who excludes both a betrothed woman and a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i> from drinking the bitter water, <b>what does he do with this</b> term <b>“any man”?</b> What does it serve to include? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yonatan <b>requires it</b> in order <b>to include the wife of a deaf-mute and the wife of an imbecile, and the wife of</b>
