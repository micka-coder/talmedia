### Part 1
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>A woman who was pregnant</b> with the child <b>of another</b> man at the time of her marriage <b>and a woman who was nursing</b> the child <b>of another</b> man at the time of her marriage <b>neither drink</b> the bitter water <b>nor collect</b> payment of their <b>marriage contracts,</b> as their marriages were prohibited by rabbinic law. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The reason for this is <b>as Rabbi Meir would say: A man may not marry a woman who is pregnant</b> with the child <b>of another</b> man <b>or a woman who is nursing</b> the child <b>of another</b> man, until twenty-four months pass after the baby’s birth, so as to ensure that the woman will not become pregnant while the child needs to nurse. <b>And if he married</b> her, <b>he must divorce</b> her <b>and may never remarry</b> her, as the Sages penalized him for transgressing the prohibition. <b>And the Rabbis say: He must divorce</b> her, <b>and when his time to marry</b> her <b>arrives,</b> i.e., twenty-four months after the baby’s birth, <b>he can marry</b> her again.

### Part 3
The <i>baraita</i> continues: In <b>the</b> case of a <b>young man who married a barren woman or an elderly woman, and he did not have a wife and children beforehand,</b> the woman <b>neither drinks nor collects</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract,</b> as it is prohibited for him to marry a woman with whom he cannot procreate. <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> This marriage is not forbidden, as <b>he can marry another</b> woman <b>and procreate through her,</b> and therefore she can drink the bitter water.

### Part 4
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>However,</b> in the case of <b>one who issued a warning to his betrothed, or to his</b> <i>yevama</i> while she was a <b>widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i>, and she secluded herself</b> with the other man <b>after he consummated</b> the marriage, <b>she either drinks</b> the bitter water <b>or does not collect</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract.</b> If <b>his own pregnant or nursing</b> wife becomes a <i>sota</i>, then despite the concern that the bitter water may harm the fetus, she <b>either drinks</b> the bitter water <b>or does not collect</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract.</b> In <b>the</b> case of a <b>young man who married a barren woman or an elderly woman, and he</b> already <b>had a wife and children</b> and was therefore permitted to marry his barren or elderly wife, the woman <b>either drinks</b> the bitter water <b>or does not collect</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract.</b>

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: With regard to <b>the wife of a <i>mamzer</i></b> who is married <b>to a <i>mamzer</i></b> in a permitted marriage, <b>and the wife of a Gibeonite</b> who is married <b>to a Gibeonite</b> in a permitted marriage, <b>and the wife of a convert or an emancipated slave, and a sexually underdeveloped woman,</b> if any of these women becomes a <i>sota</i> she <b>either drinks</b> the bitter water <b>or does not collect</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract,</b> as the marriage is permitted. After citing the entire <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>a sexually underdeveloped woman</b> can drink the bitter water if the marriage is permitted, and this is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Naḥman</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> There <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> with regard to this matter, <b>and I state</b> my opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon Ben Elazar says: A sexually underdeveloped woman neither drinks nor collects</b> payment of her <b>marriage contract, as it is stated: “And she shall be cleared, and shall conceive seed”</b> (Numbers 5:28), indicating that the <i>sota</i> ritual pertains only to <b>one whose way is to bear seed</b> and give birth, <b>excluding this</b> sexually underdeveloped woman, <b>whose way is not to bear seed.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, what do they do with this</b> verse: <b>“And she shall be cleared, and shall conceive seed”?</b> Since they hold that a sexually underdeveloped woman drinks the bitter water, what do they derive from the verse? The Gemara answers: <b>They require</b> it <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“And she shall be cleared, and shall conceive seed”</b> (Numbers 5:28), indicates <b>that if she was barren, she will be remembered</b> and conceive a child; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yishmael said to him: If so, all the barren women will seclude themselves</b> with other men, <b>and they will be remembered</b> and conceive after drinking the bitter water and being found innocent; <b>but that</b> virtuous barren woman, who does not transgress the prohibition of seclusion, <b>since she does not seclude herself</b> with other men, <b>she loses</b> the opportunity to receive this blessing.

### Part 8
Rabbi Yishmael continues: <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And she shall be cleared, and shall conceive seed”</b> (Numbers 5:28)? This means <b>that if</b> in the past she <b>would give birth in pain,</b> from then on <b>she will give birth with ease;</b> if she gave birth to <b>females, she will</b> now <b>give birth to males;</b> if her children were <b>short, she will</b> now <b>give birth to tall</b> children; if her children were <b>black, she will give birth to white</b> children.

### Part 9
§ The <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> cited above states: <b>The wife of a <i>mamzer</i></b> who is married <b>to a <i>mamzer</i></b> in a permitted marriage… either drinks the bitter water or does not collect payment of her marriage contract. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> that <b>obvious?</b> Since their marriage is permitted, why should the <i>sota</i> ritual not apply? The Gemara answers: It is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that she should not drink, since if she drinks and is found to be innocent of adultery, she is permitted to her husband. This is undesirable since their offspring are also <i>mamzerim</i>, and <b>we do not cause</b> the number of individuals <b>of flawed lineage to proliferate.</b> The <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not a concern, and the wife of a <i>mamzer</i> is permitted to drink.

### Part 10
The aforementioned <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> states: <b>The wife of a convert or an emancipated slave, and a sexually underdeveloped woman</b> can drink the bitter water. The Gemara asks with regard to the wife of a convert or an emancipated slave, who also has the status of a convert: <b>Isn’t</b> that <b>obvious?</b> Since their marriage is permitted, why should the <i>sota</i> ritual not apply?

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: It is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that she does not drink, as the verse states: <b>“Speak to the children of Israel,</b> and say unto them: If the wife of any man goes astray, and acts unfaithfully against him” (Numbers 5:12). One might have inferred from this verse that the <i>sota</i> ritual applies only to those born as Jews <b>and not</b> to <b>converts;</b> the <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so. The Gemara asks: Why not <b>say</b> that <b>indeed</b> the verse excludes converts? The Gemara answers: The subsequent term: <b>“And say</b> unto them” (Numbers 5:12) <b>is an amplification,</b> which serves to include converts.

### Part 12
§ The mishna states: <b>The wife of a priest drinks</b> the bitter water, and if she is found to be innocent of adultery she is permitted to her husband. The Gemara asks: Why does the mishna state: <b>The wife of a priest drinks? Isn’t</b> that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: It is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that she does not drink, as the verse states: “And a man lay with <b>her…neither was she seized”</b> (Numbers 5:13). This indicates that if the <i>sota</i> was not seized <b>she is forbidden; however,</b> if she was <b>seized,</b> i.e., raped, she is <b>permitted</b> to her husband. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> woman, the wife of a priest, <b>since</b> even if she was <b>seized</b> she is <b>forbidden</b> to her husband, as a priest may not remain married to his wife if she was raped while they were married, one might <b>say</b> that the <i>sota</i> ritual does not apply to her, and she <b>does not drink.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that she does drink.

### Part 13
§ The mishna states: The wife of a priest drinks, <b>and</b> if she is found to be innocent of adultery, <b>she is permitted to her husband.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> that <b>obvious? Rav Huna says:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the woman’s health <b>deteriorates</b> after she drinks the bitter water, and one might have thought that she is defiled. The Gemara asks: In the case of a woman whose health <b>deteriorates, hasn’t the</b> bitter <b>water</b> already <b>evaluated</b> that <b>she</b> was unfaithful? The fact that her health deteriorates indicates that she is defiled and forbidden to her husband, and her death is delayed due to her merit in other matters.

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where her</b> health <b>deteriorates,</b> but not in the manner of a <i>sota</i>, who is afflicted in her belly and thighs (see Numbers 5:27). Rather, she is afflicted <b>by way of</b> other <b>limbs. Lest you say: This</b> woman <b>engaged in licentious intercourse, and</b> the fact <b>that the</b> bitter <b>water did not evaluate her in</b> the <b>usual manner</b> is <b>because she engaged in licentious intercourse under duress, and with regard to a priest,</b> even rape <b>renders her forbidden to her</b> to her husband, the mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the woman’s deteriorating health does not indicate anything.

### Part 15
§ The mishna states: <b>The wife of a eunuch drinks.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> that <b>obvious?</b> Since their marriage is permitted, why should the <i>sota</i> ritual not apply? The Gemara replies: It is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that she does not drink, since <b>the Merciful One states</b> with regard to the <i>sota</i>: “But if you have gone astray while under your husband, and if you are defiled, and some man has lain with you <b>besides your husband”</b> (Numbers 5:20). This indicates that her husband had lain with her, <b>and this</b> husband, the eunuch, <b>is not capable of that.</b> The mishna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the wife of a eunuch does drink the bitter water.

### Part 16
§ The mishna states: A husband <b>can issue a warning</b> to his wife <b>with regard to all those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> e.g., her father or brother. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> that <b>obvious?</b>
