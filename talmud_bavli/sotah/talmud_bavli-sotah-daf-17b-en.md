### Part 1
<b><i>diftera</i>,</b> a hide that is only partially processed, as it is salted and treated with flour but not gallnuts; <b>rather,</b> it must be written only <b>on a scroll</b> of parchment, <b>as</b> it <b>is stated:</b> “And the priest shall write these curses <b>in a scroll”</b> (Numbers 5:23).

### Part 2
<b>And</b> the scribe <b>may not write with gum [<i>komos</i>], and not with iron sulfate [<i>kankantom</i>], nor with any substance that makes a mark</b> and cannot be completely erased, <b>but</b> only <b>with ink</b> made from soot, <b>as it is stated</b> in the continuation of the same verse: <b>“And he shall blot</b> them out into the water of bitterness” (Numbers 5:23). This indicates that the scroll must be written with <b>a writing that can be erased</b> in water.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rava says: A scroll of a <i>sota</i> that one wrote at night is unfit. What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>derived</b> by verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>“law”</b> and another instance of the word <b>“law.” It is written here,</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>: <b>“And the priest shall execute upon her all this law”</b> (Numbers 5:30), <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to judgment: <b>“According to the law, which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment,</b> which they shall tell you” (Deuteronomy 17:11). <b>Just as judgment</b> may be done only <b>by day, so too the scroll of a <i>sota</i></b> may be written only <b>by day.</b>

### Part 4
<b>If one wrote</b> the scroll <b>out of sequence, it is unfit, as it is written: “And</b> the priest <b>shall write these curses</b> in a scroll” (Numbers 5:23). They must be written in the scroll just <b>as they are written</b> in the Torah.

### Part 5
<b>If one wrote</b> the scroll <b>before</b> the <i>sota</i> <b>accepted the oath upon herself,</b> the scroll <b>is unfit, as it is stated: “Then</b> the priest <b>shall cause</b> the woman <b>to swear</b> with the oath of cursing” (Numbers 5:21), <b>and afterward</b> it states: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall write</b> these curses in a scroll” (Numbers 5:23).

### Part 6
<b>If one wrote</b> the scroll <b>as a letter,</b> i.e., without first scoring the lines onto the parchment, <b>it is unfit,</b> as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“In a scroll,”</b> indicating that it must be written like a Torah scroll, in which the parchment must be scored.
