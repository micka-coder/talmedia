### Part 1
<b>“And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on Jeremiah the prophet, saying: You shall fall to the Chaldeans. Then Jeremiah said: It is false; I shall not fall to the Chaldeans”</b> (Jeremiah 37:13–14). <b>And it is</b> then <b>written: “So</b> Irijah <b>laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes”</b> (Jeremiah 37:14). Irijah was the grandson of Hananiah, and Jeremiah was punished by falling into his hands because he had flattered his grandfather.

### Part 2
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Any congregation in which there is flattery is as repulsive as a menstruating woman, as it is stated: “For a flattering congregation shall be desolate [<i>galmud</i>]”</b> (Job 15:34), <b>and in the cities overseas they call a menstruating woman <i>galmuda</i>. What</b> is the meaning of the word <b><i>galmuda</i>?</b> It means <b>separated [<i>gemula</i>] from her husband [<i>mibbala</i>].</b>

### Part 3
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Any congregation in which there is flattery is ultimately exiled. It is written here: “For a flattering congregation shall be desolate [<i>galmud</i>]”</b> (Job 15:34), <b>and it is written there: “Then you will say in your heart: Who has begotten me these, seeing I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary [<i>galmuda</i>], an exile, and wandering?”</b> (Isaiah 49:21). The verse states: “An exile,” as an appositive to “<i>galmuda</i>,” indicating that they are the same.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says: Four classes</b> of people <b>will not greet the Divine Presence: The class of cynics, and the class of flatterers, and the class of liars, and the class of slanderers.</b>

### Part 5
The proof for this statement is as follows: <b>The class of cynics, as it is written: “He draws His hand from cynics”</b> (Hosea 7:5), i.e., God does not want to be in their presence; <b>the class of flatterers, as it is written: “That a flatterer cannot come before Him”</b> (Job 13:16); <b>the class of liars, as it is written: “He who speaks falsehood shall not dwell before My eyes”</b> (Psalms 101:7).

### Part 6
<b>The class of slanderers</b> will not greet the Divine Presence, <b>as it is written: “For You are not a god who has pleasure in wickedness, evil shall not sojourn with You”</b> (Psalms 5:5), which means: <b>You, the Lord, are righteous</b> and <b>evil shall not dwell</b> with You <b>in Your dwelling place.</b> “Evil” here is referring to slanderers, as is evident from the continuation of the chapter, which states: “For there is no sincerity in their mouth; their inward part is a yawning gulf, their throat is an open tomb, they make smooth their tongue” (Psalms 5:10).
