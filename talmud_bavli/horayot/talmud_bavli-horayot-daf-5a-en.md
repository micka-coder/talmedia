### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> They bring <b>thirteen bulls; and for idol worship</b> they bring <b>thirteen bulls and thirteen goats, a bull and a goat for each and every tribe and a bull and a goat for</b> the <b>court.</b>

### Part 2
The mishna continues: If the judges of the <b>court issued a ruling, and</b> at least <b>seven tribes, or a majority of</b> each of those tribes, <b>performed</b> a transgression <b>on the basis of their</b> ruling, the judges <b>bring a bull; and for idol worship they bring a bull and a goat.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The <b>seven tribes that sinned bring seven bulls,</b> i.e., each tribe brings one bull, <b>and</b> each of <b>the rest of the tribes,</b> i.e., those <b>that did not sin, brings</b> one <b>bull on the basis of</b> the sin of the other tribes, <b>as even those who did not sin bring</b> an offering <b>on the basis of</b> the actions of the <b>sinners. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> When seven tribes sin <b>eight bulls</b> are brought as offerings, one bull for each and every tribe and one bull for the court. <b>And for idol worship, eight bulls and eight goats</b> are brought, one <b>bull and</b> one <b>goat for each and every tribe</b> and one <b>bull and</b> one <b>goat for</b> the <b>court.</b>

### Part 3
If the <b>court of one of the tribes issued a ruling and</b> the majority of <b>that tribe performed</b> a transgression <b>on the basis of its</b> ruling, <b>that tribe is liable</b> to bring an offering <b>and the rest of all the tribes</b> are <b>exempt;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say: One is liable</b> to bring an offering for an unwitting communal sin <b>only for rulings of the High Court alone, as it is stated: “And if the entire assembly of Israel shall act unwittingly”</b> (Leviticus 4:13), from which it is derived that there is liability only for a ruling of the assembly, i.e., the court, of the entire people, <b>but not</b> for a ruling of <b>the assembly of that</b> particular <b>tribe.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara elaborates on the dispute cited in the mishna. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where the judges <b>knew that they issued</b> an erroneous <b>ruling, and erred</b> in remembering which erroneous <b>ruling they issued,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would be liable</b> to bring an offering for this. <b>The verse states: “And the sin</b> that they sinned <b>became known,</b> the congregation shall sacrifice” (Leviticus 4:14), indicating that liability is only in a case where the sin became known to the court that issued the erroneous ruling, <b>and not</b> in a case <b>where it became known</b> only <b>to the sinners.</b> In this case, the sinners are certain that they sinned, but the court does not know the sin with regard to which it issued the ruling.

### Part 5
From the phrase <b>“that they sinned”</b> it is derived: If <b>two tribes sinned they bring two bulls,</b> one from each tribe; if <b>three</b> tribes <b>sinned they bring three</b> bulls, one from each tribe. <b>Or</b> perhaps that phrase <b>says only</b> that if <b>two individuals sinned they bring two bulls,</b> one from each individual; if <b>three</b> individuals <b>sinned they bring three</b> bulls, one from each individual. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The congregation,”</b> from which it is derived: <b>The congregation</b> is <b>liable, and each and every congregation</b> is <b>liable. How</b> so? If <b>two tribes sinned they bring two bulls.</b> If <b>seven</b> tribes <b>sinned they bring seven</b> bulls. <b>And each</b> of <b>the rest of the tribes that did not sin brings</b> one <b>bull on the basis of</b> the sin of the other tribes, <b>as even those</b> tribes <b>that did not sin bring</b> an offering <b>on the basis of</b> the actions of <b>the sinners. For that</b> reason <b>“congregation” is stated</b> in the verse, <b>to render each and every congregation liable.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Seven tribes that sinned bring seven bulls, and</b> the <b>court brings</b> one <b>bull on the basis of their</b> actions, <b>as</b> the term <b>“congregation” is stated below:</b> “The congregation shall sacrifice” (Leviticus 4:14), <b>and</b> the term <b>“congregation” is stated above:</b> “And the matter is hidden from the eyes of the congregation” (Leviticus 4:13). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the term <b>“congregation” that is stated above</b> the reference is to the <b>court,</b> i.e., “the eyes of the congregation,” together <b>with “the congregation,” so too,</b> with regard to the term <b>“congregation” that is stated below,</b> with regard to liability to bring an offering the reference is to the <b>court</b> together <b>with the congregation.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> In the case of <b>seven tribes that sinned,</b> the <b>court brings a bull on the basis of their</b> sin <b>and</b> the members of the tribe <b>are exempt,</b> as the term <b>“congregation” is stated below:</b> “The congregation shall sacrifice” (Leviticus 4:14), <b>and</b> the term <b>“congregation” is stated above:</b> “And the matter is hidden from the eyes of the congregation” (Leviticus 4:13). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the term <b>“congregation” that is stated above</b> the reference is to the <b>court and not</b> to the <b>public, so too,</b> with regard to the term <b>“congregation” that is stated below</b> the reference is to the <b>court and not</b> to the <b>public.</b>

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of</b> Rabbi Meir: If <b>six tribes sinned and</b> in terms of population <b>they</b> constitute <b>a majority of</b> the <b>congregation, or</b> if <b>seven</b> tribes, which constitute a majority of the tribes, sinned, <b>even though</b> in terms of population <b>they do not</b> constitute <b>a majority of</b> the <b>congregation,</b> the court <b>brings a bull.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara proceeds to analyze the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said: “And the sin</b> that they sinned <b>became known,”</b> indicating that liability is only in a case where the sin became known to the court that issued the erroneous ruling <b>and not</b> in a case <b>where it became known</b> only <b>to the sinners. Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> whose opinion is expressed here? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rava</b> who said, <b>that</b> this is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that there is a dispute with regard to one who had two pieces before him, one of them prohibited because it is forbidden fat and one of them prohibited because it is left over from an offering after the time allotted for its consumption [<i>notar</i>], and he ate one, but does not know whether he ate the forbidden fat or the <i>notar</i>.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it, he is liable to bring a sin-offering. <b>If</b> it was forbidden <b>fat</b> that <b>he ate</b> he is <b>liable,</b> and if it was <b><i>notar</i></b> that <b>he ate</b> he is <b>liable.</b> Therefore, he must bring an offering. Likewise, in the case in the <i>baraita</i>, since the court issued an erroneous ruling and it is known that the erroneous ruling was with regard to a matter for which it is liable to bring an offering, according to Rabbi Eliezer it should make no difference that they do not know the precise nature of their error, and they should be liable to bring an offering. Nevertheless, the ruling in the <i>baraita</i> is that they are exempt, counter to what one would expect to be the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ashi said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> one can explain the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, it <b>is different, as it is written:</b> “And the sin <b>that they sinned</b> became known” (Leviticus 4:14). The verse underscores that the judges must be aware of the specific sin for which they are liable to bring an offering. The Gemara asks: <b>There too,</b> with regard to an individual sin-offering, <b>isn’t it written:</b> “Or if his sin <b>that he sinned</b> became known to him” (Leviticus 4:23), leading to the same conclusion? The Gemara answers: In the case of the individual sin-offering, <b>that</b> expression <b>is necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>to exclude</b> one who <b>acts unawares.</b> One is liable to bring a sin-offering for an unwitting transgression only if he performs the action with intent.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that even one tribe that sinned is liable to bring an offering? The Gemara answers that <b>he holds:</b> There are <b>four</b> mentions of the term <b>congregation written: Congregation, the congregation, congregation, the congregation.</b> The term “the congregation” appears in both verses. Since the Torah could have written the term: Congregation, in both instances, Rabbi Yehuda derives two matters from each of the two terms, one from the term “congregation” itself, and another from the fact that it is written with the definitive article “the.”

### Part 13
<b>One</b> serves <b>to render each and every congregation liable,</b> as a tribe is also called a congregation; <b>and one</b> serves <b>to</b> establish that the <b>ruling is dependent on</b> the <b>court and</b> the <b>action is dependent on the congregation; and one</b> serves <b>to</b> teach the concept of <b>drawing,</b> i.e., a tribe that did not sin is drawn after a tribe that sinned and is liable to bring an offering; <b>and one</b> serves <b>to</b> teach that <b>a tribe that performed</b> a transgression <b>on</b> the basis of <b>the ruling of</b> its tribal <b>court</b> is liable to bring a bull as an unwitting communal sin-offering.

### Part 14
<b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that seven tribes that sinned bring seven bulls and the court brings one bull? He holds that there are <b>three</b> mentions of the term <b>congregation written.</b> The first two are: <b>The congregation, congregation,</b> which he interprets in the manner that Rabbi Yehuda interpreted. He counts the third and last mention of the term: <b>The congregation,</b> as in the verse: <b>“From the eyes of the congregation.” This is</b> written in <b>the</b> typical <b>manner of the verse, as people say: From the eyes of so-and-so,</b> and the definitive article “the” does not serve to teach another <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 15
Of those three, <b>one</b> serves <b>to render each and every congregation liable,</b> as a tribe is also called congregation, <b>and</b> the <b>other two</b> come so that a verbal analogy can be derived: The term <b>“congregation” is stated below, and</b> the term <b>“congregation” is stated above. Just as</b> with regard to the term “congregation” that is stated <b>there,</b> above, the reference is to the <b>court,</b> i.e., “the eyes of the congregation,” together <b>with the congregation, so too,</b> with regard to the term “congregation” that is stated <b>here</b> concerning liability to bring an offering, the reference is to the <b>court</b> together <b>with the congregation.</b>

### Part 16
<b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who holds that the court brings a bull on the basis of its sin and the members of the tribe are exempt? <b>He does not derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from the difference between the terms <b>“congregation”</b> and <b>“the congregation.”</b> He does not consider the addition of the definite article to be significant. <b>Therefore,</b> he holds that there are <b>two</b> mentions of the term <b>congregation written.</b> They are <b>necessary for him to</b> derive: The term <b>“congregation” is stated below, and</b> the term <b>“congregation” is stated above. Just as</b> with regard to the term “congregation” that is stated <b>there,</b> above, the reference is to the <b>court and not</b> to the <b>public, so too</b> with regard to the term “congregation” that is stated <b>here,</b> below, the reference is to the <b>court and not</b> to the <b>public.</b>

### Part 17
<b>And what is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> who holds that if six tribes sinned and in terms of population they constitute a majority of the congregation, or if seven tribes sinned even though in terms of population they do not constitute a majority of the congregation, the court brings a bull? <b>It is written: “Then it shall be, if</b> it was performed unwittingly, hidden <b>from the eyes of the congregation”</b> (Numbers 15:24). <b>Apparently,</b> the reference is even to <b>a minority</b> of the people, <b>as “from the eyes” is written,</b> indicating: Not all of them, but some of them. <b>And it is written: “As for all the people</b> it was performed <b>unwittingly”</b> (Numbers 15:26), <b>to say that</b> based on the principle: The halakhic status of a majority is like that of the entirety, if <b>the majority</b> of the congregation sinned, then <b>yes,</b> the court is liable to bring an offering. If <b>the minority</b> sinned, then <b>no,</b> the court is not liable.

### Part 18
<b>How so?</b> How can this apparent contradiction be resolved? The Gemara explains: If <b>six</b> tribes <b>sinned and they</b> constitute <b>a majority of</b> the <b>congregation, or</b> if <b>seven</b> tribes sinned, <b>even though</b> in terms of population <b>they do not</b> constitute <b>a majority of</b> the <b>congregation,</b> the court is <b>liable</b> to bring a bull. Although in both cases they are not a majority in every sense, the court is liable, as a reference to the minority is also indicated in the verse.
