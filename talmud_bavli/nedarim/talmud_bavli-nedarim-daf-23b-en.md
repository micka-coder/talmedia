### Part 1
The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>is incomplete and is teaching like this:</b> In the case of <b>one who wants another to eat with him, and he urges him</b> to do so <b>and makes a vow with regard to him, this</b> vow <b>is</b> included in the category of <b>vows of exhortation,</b> which do not require dissolution. <b>And</b> in addition, <b>one who desires</b> that <b>his vows not be upheld</b> for <b>the entire year should stand up on Rosh HaShana and say: Any vow that I take in the future should be void. And</b> this is statement is effective, <b>provided that he remembers at the time of the vow</b> that his intent at the beginning of the year was to render it void.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>If he remembers</b> at the time of the vow that his intent at the beginning of the year was to render it void but still makes the vow, then <b>he has uprooted his stipulation</b> that all his vows are void <b>and has upheld his vow.</b> Why, then, does it state that the vows are void in this case? <b>Abaye said: Teach: And</b> this is statement is effective, <b>provided that he does not remember at the time of the vow</b> that his intention at the beginning of the year was to render it void.

### Part 3
<b>Rava said: Actually,</b> say <b>as we said initially,</b> that he does remember his stipulation at the time of the vow. <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is a case <b>where he stipulated</b> a condition <b>on Rosh HaShana</b> rendering void vows that he would make later in the year, <b>but he did not know with regard to which</b> vows <b>he made the stipulation, and now he makes a vow. If he remembers at the time of the vow and says: I am vowing in accordance with the initial intention,</b> when I stipulated that all vows should be void, <b>his vow has no substance.</b> However, if <b>he did not say: I am vowing in accordance with the initial intention,</b> then <b>he has uprooted his stipulation and upheld his vow.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana intended to teach</b> this topic <b>at</b> the Festival <b>lecture,</b> so that everyone would learn this manner of rendering vows void on Rosh HaShana. <b>Rava said to him:</b> The <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>conceals it</b> and does not say it explicitly, despite the fact that it is studied by Torah scholars, <b>in order that</b> the public <b>not treat vows lightly, and you teach it</b> publicly <b>at</b> the Festival <b>lecture?</b>

### Part 5
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the scholars: Do <b>the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov</b> in the mishna <b>or not? And if you say</b> that <b>they disagree</b> with him, is <b>the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with his</b> opinion <b>or not?</b> The Gemara suggests a proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as we learned</b> in a mishna (63b): <b>One who says to another:</b>
