### Part 1
The Gemara rejects this conclusion as well: <b>Here too,</b> it is a case <b>in which</b> the husband <b>says to</b> the steward: <b>When I hear</b> the vow, then it <b>will be nullified for her.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Let him nullify</b> the vows <b>for her when he</b> actually <b>hears</b> them. Why do so earlier? The Gemara answers: <b>He reasons: Perhaps I will be preoccupied</b> at that moment and will forget to nullify them. The questions pertaining to nullification of vows without hearing them is left unresolved.

### Part 2
§ <b>Rami bar Ḥama asks:</b> With regard to <b>a deaf man, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to his nullifying</b> vows <b>for his wife? If you say</b> that <b>a husband</b> who is not deaf <b>can nullify</b> a vow <b>without hearing</b> it, then perhaps this is <b>because he is capable of hearing. But</b> with regard to <b>a deaf man, who is not capable of hearing,</b> perhaps <b>this is</b> an application of the principle derived from the statement <b>of Rabbi Zeira.</b>

### Part 3
<b>As Rabbi Zeira said:</b> For <b>any</b> amount of flour <b>suitable for mingling</b> with oil in a meal-offering, <b>mingling is not indispensable for it.</b> Even though it is a mitzva to mingle the flour and oil <i>ab initio</i>, if they were not mingled, the meal-offering is still valid. <b>But</b> for <b>any</b> amount of flour <b>not suitable for mingling, mingling is indispensable for it,</b> and such a meal-offering is invalid. The principle is: <i>Ab initio</i> requirements prevent the fulfillment of a mitzva in situations where they are not merely absent but impossible. In this case, the deaf man does not merely not hear the vow, it is impossible for him to do so.

### Part 4
<b>Or perhaps</b> the phrase <b>“and her husband hears it”</b> (Numbers 30:8) <b>does not</b> mean that hearing <b>is indispensable</b> to the nullification of a vow, so that even a deaf man can nullify his wife’s vows. <b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i> interpreting that verse: <b>“And her husband hears it”;</b> this <b>excludes the wife of a deaf man.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that a deaf man cannot nullify his wife’s vows.

### Part 5
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Concerning <b>a husband, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to nullifying</b> vows <b>for his two wives simultaneously?</b> Do the words “but if her husband disallows <b>her</b> on the day that he hears it, and he nullifies her vow which is upon her” (Numbers 30:9), stated in the singular, refer <b>specifically</b> to one wife? <b>Or,</b> perhaps it does <b>not</b> refer <b>specifically</b> to one wife, and a husband can nullify the vows of more than one wife simultaneously.

### Part 6
<b>Ravina said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: In the <i>sota</i> ritual, performed by women suspected by their husbands of having committed adultery, <b>two <i>sota</i> women are not given to drink</b> the bitter waters <b>as one.</b> This is <b>because the heart</b> of each becomes <b>emboldened [<i>gas</i>] in the</b> presence of <b>the other</b> woman, and if one is guilty she will lack the humility to confess.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: This is not for</b> that <b>reason [<i>lo min hashem hu zeh</i>], but because it is stated: “And he shall make her drink”</b> (Numbers 5:27), which indicates <b>her by herself.</b> Similarly, the words “disallows her” (Numbers 30:9) should be read as referring specifically to a single woman, indicating that a man cannot nullify the vows of two wives simultaneously.
