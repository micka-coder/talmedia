### Part 1
<b>Or perhaps</b> the prohibition on replacement produce in the mishna is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that replacements</b> of the produce are viewed as being <b>like that which grows</b> from them? They are both forbidden because they derive from the forbidden produce. If this is the case, it <b>is no different</b> for <b>him and</b> it <b>is no different</b> for <b>another.</b> Neither may derive benefit from the replacements.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Minyumi said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says to his wife: Benefiting from me is <i>konam</i> for you, she may</b> nevertheless <b>borrow</b> money to sustain herself, <b>and the creditors can come and collect</b> her debts from her husband. <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>the creditors can collect</b> from the husband? <b>Is it not because</b> she benefits only indirectly, and it must be <b>that replacements,</b> i.e., the creditors’ money, <b>are not like that which grows</b> from the original item?

### Part 3
<b>Rava said:</b> This is not proof: <b>Perhaps it is</b> the case <b>that one should not</b> benefit from replacements <b><i>ab initio</i>, but if one did</b> it, it is <b>done</b> after the fact. Since the wife lacks any other means to support herself, the case is considered to be after the fact, and it is permitted for her to benefit indirectly. Still, replacements of an item are considered to be like that which grows from it <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 4
<b>Rather, come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from another mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 56b): With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with</b> fruit of <b><i>orla</i>,</b> i.e., fruit of the first three years of a tree’s growth, from which it is forbidden to benefit, <b>she is not betrothed</b> because the fruits have no value. Betrothal can be performed only with an object worth at least one <i>peruta</i>. But if <b>he sold them and betrothed her with the money</b> he received, <b>she is betrothed.</b> Evidently, replacements of a forbidden item are permitted. The Gemara responds: <b>Here also, one should not</b> benefit from the replacement items given in exchange for the <i>orla <b>ab initio</b></i><b>, but if one did</b> it, it is <b>done</b> after the fact. Replacements of an item may still be considered to be like that which grows from it <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If someone says to another: <b>I am hereby</b> forbidden <b>to you</b> like an item <b>dedicated</b> to the Temple, then <b>the one prohibited by</b> the <b>vow is prohibited</b> from benefiting from the possessions of the one who took the vow. If someone says: <b>You are hereby</b> forbidden <b>to me</b> like an item <b>dedicated</b> to the Temple, then <b>the one who took the vow is prohibited</b> from benefiting from the possessions of the other. If he says: <b>I am hereby</b> forbidden <b>to you and you are</b> hereby forbidden <b>to me</b> like an item dedicated to the Temple, <b>both are prohibited</b> from benefiting from the possessions of the other. <b>But</b> it is <b>permitted for both of them</b> to benefit <b>from</b> the <b>objects belonging to those who ascended from Babylonia,</b> i.e., common property of the nation as a whole, which is not considered to be the property of any individual.
