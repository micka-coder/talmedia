### Part 1
<b>that silence ratifies</b> a vow, <b>but silence does not cancel,</b> i.e., nullify, a vow. If the husband <b>ratified</b> a vow <b>in his heart, it is ratified,</b> but if <b>he nullified</b> it <b>in his heart, it is not nullified.</b> The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>If he ratified</b> a vow <b>he can no longer nullify</b> it; and similarly, <b>if he nullified</b> a vow <b>he can no longer ratify</b> it. In any case, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches that silence ratifies</b> a vow. <b>What, is it not</b> referring even <b>to one who is silent in order to annoy</b> his wife?

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <b>No,</b> it is referring <b>to one who is silent in order to sustain</b> the vow. The Gemara asks: If so, <b>this is</b> the same as: <b>If</b> the husband <b>ratified</b> a vow <b>in his heart, it is ratified. Rather,</b> the phrase in the <i>baraita</i>: Silence ratifies a vow, is referring <b>to</b> a case where the husband <b>is silent without specifying</b> his intent.

### Part 3
Relating to the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> how the <i>halakha</i> is more <b>stringent in ratification</b> of vows <b>than in nullification</b> of vows, but <b>where</b> do <b>we</b> find a case <b>in</b> which the <i>halakha</i> is more stringent <b>in nullification than in ratification? Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One can request</b> from a halakhic authority dissolution of <b>the ratification</b> of a vow his wife took, <b>but one cannot request</b> dissolution of <b>the nullification</b> of a vow.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Kahana raised an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina that a husband who is silent about his wife’s vow in order to annoy her can nullify it even several days later. A <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>“But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her</b> from day to day, then he causes all her vows to be ratified” (Numbers 30:15). <b>The verse is speaking of one who is silent in order to annoy</b> his wife. Do <b>you say</b> that the verse is referring <b>to one who is silent in order to annoy</b> her, <b>or it is</b> referring <b>only to one who is silent in order to ratify</b> the vow?

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>When it says,</b> in the continuation of the same verse: “He has ratified them, <b>because he held his peace at her</b> on the day that he heard them” (Numbers 30:15), <b>the verse is speaking of one who is silent in order to ratify</b> the vow. <b>How do I realize</b> the meaning of: <b>“If her husband altogether holds his peace at her”?</b> It must be that <b>the verse is speaking of one who is silent in order to annoy</b> his wife, and that this is also considered an act of ratification. This <i>baraita</i> is <b>a conclusive refutation [<i>teyuveta</i>]</b> of Rabbi Ḥanina’s opinion.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks about this <i>baraita</i>: <b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>interpret this</b> part of the verse as referring <b>to one who is silent in order to ratify</b> the vow, and <b>that</b> part of the same verse as referring <b>to one who was silent without specifying</b> his intent, as the Gemara suggests above in explanation of the <i>baraita</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Superfluous verses are written</b> about silence, leading to the conclusion that whatever the reason for the husband’s silence, the vow is ratified.

### Part 7
<b>Rava raised</b> a further <b>objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina, from a mishna (76b): If <b>she took a vow</b> on Friday <b>with nightfall</b> approaching, her father or husband <b>can nullify</b> the vow only <b>until nightfall, since, if it became dark and he had not</b> yet <b>nullified</b> her vow, <b>he cannot nullify</b> it anymore. <b>Why</b> should this be so? <b>Let</b> the fact that the husband refrained from nullifying the vow out of respect for Shabbat be regarded <b>like one who is silent in order to annoy</b> his wife, who, according to Rav Huna, can still nullify the vow later. The fact that this is not the case is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Ashi</b> also <b>raised an objection</b> to Rabbi Ḥanina’s opinion, from another mishna (87b): If a husband or father said, after failing to nullify a vow on the day he heard it: <b>I know that there are vows, but I do not know that there are those who</b> can <b>nullify</b> vows, i.e., he was unaware that he can nullify a vow, <b>he can nullify</b> it even after the day he heard it. However, if he said: <b>I know there are those who nullify, but</b> I refrained from nullifying the vow because <b>I do not know that this is</b> considered <b>a vow</b> that I could nullify, <b>Rabbi Meir says: He cannot nullify</b> at this point, <b>but the Rabbis say:</b> Even in this case <b>he can nullify</b> the vow when he discovers his error.

### Part 9
Rav Ashi asks rhetorically: <b>But why</b> may he not nullify according to Rabbi Meir’s opinion? <b>Let</b> his silence by mistake be <b>like</b> that of <b>one who is silent in order to annoy,</b> who, according to Rabbi Ḥanina, can nullify the vow at a later stage. This is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of Rabbi Ḥanina’s opinion.
