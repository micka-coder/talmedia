### Part 1
<b>as a man does not divorce the wife of his fellow,</b> so it is obvious that he is writing the bill of divorce to his wife. <b>However, did you hear them</b> state <b>generally</b> that ambiguous intimations are valid intimations?

### Part 2
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based upon the following <i>baraita</i>: If one says with regard to an object lying before him: <b>It is upon me,</b> or: <b>This is hereby upon me,</b> it <b>is forbidden, because it is an intimation</b> that he is rendering the object forbidden to himself like <b>an offering.</b> This <i>baraita</i> indicates that <b>the reason it is forbidden is</b> that <b>he</b> specifically <b>said: Upon me. However,</b> if <b>he did not say: Upon me, no,</b> it is not forbidden, because this expression is an ambiguous intimation. This is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Abaye,</b> who holds that even ambiguous intimations are valid intimations.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>the reason it is forbidden is</b> that he specifically <b>said: Upon me. However,</b> if <b>he said: It is hereby, and did not say: Upon me,</b> his statement is not considered an intimation of a vow at all, as he could have been <b>saying: It is hereby ownerless</b> property, or: <b>It is hereby charity.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that the object is forbidden <b>because</b> his statement <b>is an intimation</b> that he is rendering the object forbidden to himself like <b>an offering.</b> With regard to consecrating an offering, even the statement: This is, without the additional phrase: Upon me, is considered an intimation. Nevertheless, the <i>baraita</i> indicates that if one does not say: Upon me, the vow does not take effect. This must be because an ambiguous intimation is not a vow.

### Part 4
<b>Rather, say</b> the following: <b>The reason is that he</b> specifically <b>said: Upon me;</b> consequently, <b>he is prohibited</b> from benefiting from the object, <b>but another</b> person <b>is permitted</b> to benefit from it. <b>However,</b> if <b>he said: It is hereby,</b> and did not add the expression: Upon me, <b>both of them are prohibited</b> from benefiting from it <b>because perhaps he is saying: It is hereby consecrated</b> property. In other words, there is concern that he may have actually consecrated the object rather than taking a vow that it is forbidden to him as though it were consecrated.

### Part 5
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this on the basis of the following <i>baraita</i>: If one says: <b>This is hereby a sin-offering,</b> or: <b>This is hereby a guilt-offering,</b> then <b>even if he is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering or guilt-offering he has said nothing,</b> as this is an ambiguous intimation. However, if he said: <b>This is hereby my sin-offering,</b> or: <b>This is hereby my guilt-offering,</b> then <b>if he was liable</b> to bring that offering <b>his statement takes effect,</b> because this is an obvious intimation. This is <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that ambiguous intimations are not intimations. The Gemara asks: <b>Wasnâ€™t it Abaye who said: I say</b> that ambiguous intimations are valid intimations <b>even according to</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda? The Gemara answers: <b>He retracted</b> this statement and admitted that Rabbi Yehuda holds that ambiguous intimations are not valid intimations.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But shall we say</b> that just as Abaye retracted his statement that his opinion can be stated even according to Rabbi Yehuda, <b>Rava, who said</b> that ambiguous intimations are not valid intimations, also retracted his initial statement and admitted that his opinion is only <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> and is not in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis?

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you: I say</b> my statement <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. The Rabbis say that we do not require obvious intimations only with regard to a bill of divorce, as a man does not divorce the wife of his fellow,</b> so it is obvious that he is writing the bill of divorce to his wife. <b>However, generally we require obvious intimations.</b>
