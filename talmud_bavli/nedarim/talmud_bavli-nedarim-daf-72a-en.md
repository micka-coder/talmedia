### Part 1
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of the dilemma from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>When did they say</b> that if <b>the husband died</b> the <b>authority</b> to nullify a young woman’s vows <b>reverts to the father? When the husband did not hear</b> the vow; <b>or he heard</b> the vow <b>and nullified</b> it; <b>or heard</b> it, <b>and was silent, and died on that day. And if you say</b> that <b>divorce is like silence, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>also teach</b> with regard to the husband: <b>Or he heard</b> the vow <b>and divorced</b> her. <b>From</b> the fact <b>that he did not teach this</b> case, <b>learn from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>divorce is like ratification.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects the proof from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>State the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But if he heard</b> it <b>and ratified</b> it; <b>or he heard</b> it, <b>and was silent, and died on the following day,</b> then the father <b>cannot nullify</b> the vow. <b>But</b> according to this clause, <b>if you say</b> that <b>divorce is like ratification, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> also <b>teach: And if he heard</b> the vow <b>and divorced</b> her. <b>Rather, from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>does not teach this, learn from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>divorce is like silence.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rather, one cannot learn</b> anything <b>from this</b> <i>baraita</i> about the effect of divorce on her vows. The Gemara explains that the discrepancy between the two clauses is stylistic and can be explained either way: <b>If</b> the cases in <b>the first clause</b> are chosen <b>precisely,</b> allowing for the inference that divorce is like ratification, then one must say that the <i>tanna</i> <b>formulates the last clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> as he does <b>because of the first clause,</b> i.e., in the same style, although it does not add anything. <b>If</b> the cases in <b>the last clause</b> are chosen <b>precisely,</b> allowing for the inference that divorce is like silence, then one must say that the <i>tanna</i> <b>formulates the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> as he does <b>because of the last clause,</b> i.e., in the same style, although it does not add anything.

### Part 4
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a mishna (71a): If <b>she took a vow</b> while <b>she was betrothed, and was divorced, and was betrothed</b> again <b>on the same day, even to one hundred</b> men, <b>her father and her final husband nullify her vows. Learn from</b> this mishna that <b>divorce is like silence, because if</b> it were <b>like ratification, could the final betrothed nullify vows that</b> the <b>first betrothed had</b> already <b>ratified?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>in which the first betrothed man did not hear</b> the vow, and for that reason his divorcing her does not constitute ratification. The Gemara then asks: <b>If so, why</b> mention <b>specifically</b> that the divorce occurred <b>on that day? The same would hold true even after one hundred days as well.</b> Since the first husband never heard the vow, the final husband can nullify it on whichever day he hears it.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: It is referring to a situation <b>in which</b> the <b>betrothed</b> man <b>did not hear</b> the vow <b>but the father heard</b> it. <b>As</b> in that case, <b>it is</b> only <b>on the same day that he can nullify</b> the vow, <b>but he cannot nullify</b> it <b>from this</b> point <b>forward.</b> Once her father has already heard the vow, her betrothed cannot nullify it on a different day. Therefore, one cannot infer from the mishna that divorce is like silence.

### Part 7
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of the dilemma from a mishna (89a): If <b>she took a vow on that day,</b> and <b>he divorced her and remarried her on the same day, he cannot nullify</b> her vow. <b>Learn from</b> the mishna that <b>divorce is like ratification.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Say</b> that <b>here,</b> i.e., in the mishna cited, <b>we are dealing with a married woman, and that is the reason that he cannot nullify</b> the vow. It is not because it has been ratified by divorce but <b>because the husband cannot nullify</b> his wife’s vows <b>that precede</b> their marriage. The dilemma remains unresolved.
