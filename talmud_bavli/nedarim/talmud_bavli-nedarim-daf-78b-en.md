### Part 1
<b>The Festivals of the Lord require sanctification by the court,</b> as the Festival dates are established by the court’s determination of the New Moon, whereas <b>Shabbat,</b> which commemorates <b>Creation, does not require sanctification by the court.</b> Shabbat is sanctified every week independent of any court decision.

### Part 2
As for ben Azzai’s statement, it should be understood as follows: <b>The Festivals of the Lord require an expert,</b> as the start of the month, which is dependent upon the appearance of the new moon, which in turn determines the Festivals, can be established only by a court composed of experts. <b>But the portion on vows does not require an expert,</b> i.e., vows can be dissolved <b>even</b> by <b>a court of laymen.</b> This explanation of the <i>baraita</i> given to Rav Asi bar Natan also serves to explain Beit Shammai’s source for the <i>halakha</i> that three laymen can dissolve vows.

### Part 3
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But in the portion on vows</b> the phrase <b>“the heads of the tribes”</b> (Numbers 30:2) <b>is written.</b> How, then, can it be said that vows can be dissolved by laymen? <b>Rav Ḥisda said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> From “the heads of the tribes,” the Sages derive that vows can be dissolved <b>by a single expert</b> by himself, but three laymen also have that ability.

### Part 4
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> A husband <b>who is silent</b> and does not formally nullify his wife’s vow <b>in order to annoy [<i>lemeikat</i>]</b> her, but intends to nullify it later, <b>can nullify</b> it <b>even from now until ten days</b> later. <b>Rava raised an objection</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When did they say</b> that if <b>the husband</b> of a betrothed young woman <b>dies,</b> the <b>authority</b> to nullify the woman’s vows <b>reverts to the father?</b> The authority reverts to the father <b>when the husband did not hear</b> of her vow, <b>or when he heard and was silent, or when he heard and nullified</b> it <b>and died on the same day. But</b> if <b>he heard and ratified</b> it, <b>or if he heard and was silent and died on the following day, he,</b> the father, <b>cannot nullify</b> the vow.

### Part 5
<b>What, is</b> the phrase: Heard and was silent, <b>not</b> referring even <b>to one who is silent in order to annoy</b> her, and nevertheless nullification is only possible that day, contradicting the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to one who is silent in order to sustain</b> the vow. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, this is</b> the same as: <b>Or he heard and ratified,</b> mentioned earlier in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to one who is silent without any specific</b> intent, as opposed to the husband who is silent in order to annoy his wife, whose intent is to nullify the vow.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ḥisda raised an objection</b> from a different <i>baraita</i>: In some ways the <i>halakha</i> is more <b>stringent in ratification than in nullification, and</b> in other ways it is more stringent <b>in nullification than in ratification.</b> The <b>stringency in ratification</b> of vows is
