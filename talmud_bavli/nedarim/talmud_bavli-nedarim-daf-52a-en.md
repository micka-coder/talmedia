### Part 1
<b>is permitted</b> to eat <b>gravy and sediments of boiled meat [<i>kifa</i>]. But Rabbi Yehuda</b> maintains that he is <b>prohibited</b> from eating them.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There was <b>an incident</b> where one took such a vow <b>and Rabbi Tarfon prohibited us from</b> even <b>eggs that were cooked with</b> meat. The Rabbis <b>said to him: Indeed so,</b> but <b>when</b> is this the <i>halakha</i>? <b>When he says: This meat is</b> forbidden <b>to me,</b> referring to a specific piece of meat. This is <b>because</b> in the case of <b>one who vows</b> that <b>an item</b> is forbidden <b>to</b> him, <b>and it becomes mixed into another</b> item, <b>if</b> the latter <b>contains</b> an amount of the forbidden food <b>that gives</b> it <b>flavor,</b> i.e., the forbidden food can be tasted in the permitted food, the mixture <b>is forbidden.</b> However, if one vows that meat in general is forbidden to him, without specifying a particular piece, only the meat itself is forbidden, not the gravy, sediments, or eggs cooked with that meat.

### Part 3
Likewise, <b>one who vows</b> that <b>wine</b> is forbidden <b>to</b> him <b>is permitted to</b> eat <b>a cooked dish that has the flavor of wine.</b> However, if <b>he said: Wine is <i>konam</i></b> for me, and for <b>that</b> reason <b>I</b> will not <b>taste</b> it, <b>and</b> the wine <b>fell into a cooked dish, if</b> the dish <b>contains</b> an amount of the wine <b>that gives</b> it <b>flavor, it is forbidden.</b>
