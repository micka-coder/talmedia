### Part 1
<b>who travel from Akko to Jaffa, for they are</b> treated like <b>those who dwell on the land. Rather,</b> the term seafarers means he took a vow that deriving benefit <b>from those who customarily depart</b> out to sea is forbidden to him.

### Part 2
<b>And the one who teaches it with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> in <b>this</b> manner: <b>One who takes a vow</b> not to derive benefit <b>from those who dwell on dry land is prohibited from</b> deriving benefit from <b>seafarers, and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>not only with regard to those who travel from Akko to Jaffa,</b> who are certainly not considered seafarers, <b>but even with regard to one who customarily departs</b> to great distances. Why is such a person also considered a dweller on dry land? <b>Since eventually he will go up onto dry land.</b> No one lives his entire life at sea. Eventually, one will reach dry land, so all people are called dwellers on dry land.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who takes a vow</b> not to derive benefit <b>from those who see the sun</b> is <b>prohibited</b> from deriving benefit <b>even from</b> the <b>blind,</b> although they see nothing. This is <b>because he meant only</b> to include all <b>those that the sun sees,</b> i.e., shines upon with light.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara explains why the mishna states that blind people are included: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Since he did not say: From those who see,</b> which would exclude blind people. Instead, he employed the phrase: Those who see the sun, which comes <b>to exclude fish and fetuses,</b> who do not see the sun. Consequently, the vow is interpreted to refer to those who are exposed to the sun, including the blind.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who takes a vow</b> not to derive benefit <b>from</b> those that have <b>dark heads [<i>sheḥorei harosh</i>]</b> is <b>prohibited</b> from deriving benefit <b>from those that are bald,</b> although they have no hair at all, <b>and</b> from the <b>elderly</b> who have white hair. This is because the term is not to be understood in its simple meaning but rather in a broader manner. <b>But</b> he is <b>permitted</b> to derive benefit <b>from women and from children, because only men are called:</b> Those with <b>dark heads.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> that the term dark heads does not exclude those that are bald? <b>Because it does not say: From those with hair.</b>

### Part 7
The mishna states: <b>But</b> he is <b>permitted</b> to derive benefit <b>from women and from children, because only men are called:</b> Those with <b>dark heads.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Men sometimes cover their heads and sometimes uncover their heads.</b> They can be called dark heads since, for the most part, they have dark hair which is often uncovered. <b>But women’s</b> heads <b>are always covered, and children’s</b> heads <b>are always uncovered,</b> and the expression dark heads is referring to men whose hair is sometimes seen.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who takes a vow</b> not to derive benefit <b>from those that are born [<i>yeludim</i>]</b> is <b>permitted</b> to derive benefit from <b>those who will be born [<i>noladim</i>]</b> after the time of the vow. But if one takes a vow not to derive benefit <b>from those who will be born,</b> he is also <b>prohibited</b> from deriving benefit <b>from those that are</b> already <b>born</b> at the time of the vow. <b>Rabbi Meir permits</b> deriving benefit <b>even from those that are</b> already <b>born</b> at the time of the vow because he holds that the one taking the vow was precise in prohibiting only those that will be born. <b>And the Rabbis say: He intended</b> to include with this expression <b>only one whose nature is to be born.</b> Therefore, both those who will be born and those who were already born are included in the vow.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <b>According to Rabbi Meir,</b> in the case of one who takes a vow that deriving benefit from those who will be born is forbidden to him, the <i>halakha</i> is that he is permitted to derive benefit even from those who are already born at the time of the vow. <b>And</b> the mishna’s use of the term: Even, indicates that <b>it is not necessary</b> to say that those who <b>will be born</b> are permitted to him. The Gemara asks: <b>However,</b> if that is the case, <b>from whom is he prohibited</b> to derive benefit? The vow appears to have no effect.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>is incomplete and is teaching like this: One who takes a vow</b> not to derive benefit <b>from those that are born</b> is <b>permitted</b> to derive benefit from <b>those who will be born</b> after the time of the vow. But if one takes a vow not to derive benefit <b>from those who will be born,</b> he is also <b>prohibited</b> from deriving benefit <b>from those that are</b> already <b>born</b> at the time of the vow. <b>Rabbi Meir says: Even one who takes a vow</b> not to derive benefit <b>from those who will be born</b> is <b>permitted</b> to derive benefit <b>from those who are</b> already <b>born, just as one who takes a vow</b> not to derive benefit <b>from those who are born</b> is <b>permitted</b> to derive benefit <b>from those who will be born,</b> because Rabbi Meir claims that the one taking the vow was precise in his words.

### Part 11
With regard to the distinction between the terms in the mishna, <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Is this to say that</b> the word <b><i>noladim</i> means those who will be born</b> in the future? <b>But if that is so,</b> it says in the verse: <b>“Your two sons who were born [<i>noladim</i>] to you in the land of Egypt”</b> (Genesis 48:5), <b>does it also</b> mean <b>those who will be born?</b> The verse is referring to Manasseh and Ephraim, who were already alive.

### Part 12
The Gemara responds: <b>But rather, what</b> should one say; <b>that</b> the expression <b>means those already born? However, if that is so,</b> that <b>which is written: “Behold, a son shall be born [<i>nolad</i>] to the house of David, Josiah by name”</b> (I Kings 13:2), is the meaning <b>also that he is already</b> born? <b>But Manasseh had not yet come</b> into this world, and certainly not his grandson Josiah. <b>Rather,</b> sometimes the word <b>means this,</b> those already born, <b>and</b> sometimes <b>means that,</b> those who are not yet born, <b>and with regard to vows, follow the colloquial language,</b> in which the word <i>noladim</i> is used to mean those who are not yet born, so the vow is interpreted in this manner.

### Part 13
The mishna states: <b>And the Rabbis say: He intended</b> to include with this expression <b>only one whose nature is to be born.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What does</b> this term <b>exclude?</b> The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to exclude fish and birds,</b> which are not born but are hatched from eggs, whereas the word <i>noladim</i> means those born from their mother’s womb.
