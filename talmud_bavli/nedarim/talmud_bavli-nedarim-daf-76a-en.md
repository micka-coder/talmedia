### Part 1
The Gemara rejects this conclusion and refers back to the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Say the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>: <b>They said to Rabbi Eliezer: If one immerses an impure vessel to purify</b> it, <b>shall one immerse a vessel</b> in advance so that <b>when it will become impure it will</b> then <b>be purified? Learn from</b> this clause of the <i>baraita</i> that according to Rabbi Eliezer, vows nullified preemptively <b>take effect</b> momentarily and are then immediately nullified. The Rabbis’ objection is that according to Rabbi Eliezer, prior immersion should purify an item that momentarily became impure.

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this conclusion: One could <b>say</b> that <b>the Rabbis could not determine the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer, and this is what</b> they <b>said to him: What do you hold? If you hold that</b> preemptively nullified vows <b>take effect</b> momentarily <b>and are</b> then <b>nullified,</b> then the example of <b>a vessel will be your refutation,</b> i.e., will serve to refute your opinion. <b>If you do not hold that they take effect,</b> but rather that they do not take effect at all, then the example of <b>a ritual bath will be your refutation.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear: Rabbi Eliezer said to them: And just as ritually impure seeds, once one has sown them in the ground,</b> become <b>pure,</b> then with regard to those which <b>are already sown</b> and then come into contact with impurity, should they <b>not all the more so</b> be pure? Similarly, vows that have been preemptively nullified should be nullified, since a husband can nullify vows after they have been taken. <b>Learn from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that according to Rabbi Eliezer preemptively nullified vows <b>do not take effect</b> at all, just as seeds that were already sown do not become impure at all.

### Part 4
The Gemara comments: <b>And the Rabbis, do they not teach</b> <i>halakhot</i> based upon an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference of this sort? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Can a person sell his daughter</b> as a maidservant <b>when she is a young woman? You</b> can <b>say an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference to show that he cannot: A maidservant who was <b>already sold goes free</b> upon becoming a young woman; with regard to one <b>who has not been sold, is it not logical that she cannot be sold</b> once she already is a young woman? This <i>baraita</i> shows that the Rabbis do utilize similar <i>a fortiori</i> inferences.
