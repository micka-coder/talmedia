### Part 1
<b>but</b> where <b>they are familiar,</b> it is <b>forbidden,</b> even if the person mentioned <i>teruma</i> without specification, and there is still uncertainty with regard to which <i>teruma</i> he was referring.

### Part 2
<b>Rava said</b> that the contradiction can be resolved as follows: <b>With regard to</b> the case of a vow conditioned on the volume of <b>a heap,</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> that <b>wherever uncertainty is more stringent than certainty, one does not enter himself into</b> a state of <b>uncertainty.</b> Uncertain naziriteship is more stringent than definite naziriteship, <b>as while a definite nazirite</b> has a remedy, i.e., at the end of his naziriteship he <b>shaves</b> his hair <b>and brings an offering and it is eaten, one cannot shave</b> his hair <b>for uncertain</b> naziriteship. He cannot bring an offering in case he is not a nazirite, which would render his offering a non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard. Since he cannot bring an offering he may not shave.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda said to Rava:</b> According to your answer, that Rabbi Yehuda holds that he is not a nazirite only because uncertain naziriteship is more stringent than definite naziriteship, if one <b>said:</b> If there are a hundred <i>kor</i> in this heap <b>I am hereby a permanent nazirite, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? In this case, uncertainty is apparently not more stringent than certainty, as the naziriteship will never end even if it is definite.

### Part 4
Rava <b>said to him: Even</b> with regard to <b>a permanent nazirite, his uncertainty is more stringent than certainty</b> with regard to a different <i>halakha</i>: <b>As</b> when <b>the hair of a definite</b> nazirite <b>is</b> too <b>heavy</b> for him <b>he may lighten</b> the hair <b>with a razor and bring</b> the <b>three animal</b> offerings that a nazirite brings when he has completed his term of naziriteship, before continuing to observe naziriteship; <b>whereas</b> in a case of <b>uncertainty</b> he <b>cannot</b> do so. Since it is not certain that he is a nazirite, he cannot bring these offerings and is therefore prohibited from shaving. Therefore, uncertainty is more stringent than certainty with regard to a permanent nazirite as well.

### Part 5
Rav Huna further asked him: If one <b>said:</b> If there are one hundred <i>kor</i> in this heap, <b>I am hereby a nazirite like Samson</b> (Judges, chapters 13–16), i.e., he would be like Samson, whose permanent naziriteship could not be dissolved and who had no remedy at all, even by bringing offerings, and therefore could never shave, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Uncertainty is definitely not more stringent than certainty in this case.

### Part 6
Rava <b>said to him:</b> The concept of <b>a nazirite</b> like <b>Samson is not taught.</b> It was not mentioned at all by the Sages, as the naziriteship of Samson could not have been created through a vow. It was a one-time, divine order that cannot be emulated. Rav Huna <b>said to him: But didn’t Rav Adda bar Ahava say</b> that the concept of <b>a nazirite</b> like <b>Samson is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, which shows that it takes effect? Rava <b>said to him: If</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it <b>is taught,</b> and I cannot take issue with it. Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda acknowledges that in this case even uncertain naziriteship takes effect.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> a different resolution to the contradiction between the statements of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, in which Rabbi Yehuda treats uncertain naziriteship leniently, <b>is</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda in the name of Rabbi Tarfon. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a number of people wager on the truth of a statement, and they stipulate that whoever is correct will be a nazirite, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Tarfon: None of them is a nazirite</b> no matter who is correct, <b>because naziriteship was given</b> to take effect <b>only through explicitness</b> of intent. A vow of naziriteship takes effect only if it is taken unconditionally. Therefore, in the case of the heap, since the speaker was uncertain of its volume at the time the vow of naziriteship was taken, the vow does not take effect.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why</b> is it <b>specifically</b> stated <b>that</b> the heap <b>was stolen or that it was lost?</b> Even if it was still present and measured, the naziriteship would not have taken effect as it was conditioned and was not a clear expression. The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> that detail was established <b>to convey the far-reaching nature</b> of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, that even</b> if it is the case <b>that it was stolen or that it was lost</b> and consequently cannot be measured, nevertheless <b>he holds</b> that <b>a person enters himself into uncertainty,</b> and therefore the vow takes effect.

### Part 9
§ It is stated in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Unspecified <i>teruma</i> in Judea</b> is forbidden, but in the Galilee it is permitted, as the people of the Galilee are unfamiliar with the collection of the Temple treasury chamber. The Gemara infers: Where <b>they are familiar</b> with the collection of the chamber, it is <b>forbidden. Apparently, uncertainty</b> with regard to vows <b>is</b> treated <b>stringently.</b>

### Part 10
However, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Unspecified dedications in Judea are permitted, but in the Galilee they are forbidden, because the people of the Galilee are unfamiliar with dedications allotted to the priests.</b> It may be inferred that where <b>they are familiar</b> with dedications allotted to the priests <b>they are permitted,</b> due to the uncertainty. <b>Apparently, uncertainty</b> with regard to vows <b>is</b> treated <b>leniently.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Abaye said: The latter clause is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok,</b> not of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>unspecified <i>teruma</i> in Judea is forbidden. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says</b> that <b>unspecified dedications in the Galilee are forbidden.</b>
