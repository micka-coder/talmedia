### Part 1
<b>a negative</b> statement <b>you</b> can <b>infer a positive</b> statement? How then can it be inferred that it should be like an offering? <b>And</b> if it is <b>rather</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who disagrees with Rabbi Meir in this matter, the ruling of the mishna is superfluous, as <b>this is</b> identical to the ruling of the mishna in <b>the first clause.</b> The mishna above (10b) already established that a vow that uses the term <i>laḥullin</i> takes effect.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: The ruling is superfluous. However, <b>since</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the vow does not take effect when he says that the food will be <b>like pig meat</b> or <b>like</b> an object of <b>idol worship, it therefore teaches</b> incidentally that this ruling also applies when he says that it will be <b>non-sacred.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Ravina said</b> that <b>this is</b> what the mishna <b>is teaching: And these are</b> the vows that do not take effect at all and therefore the item mentioned in the vow remains <b>permitted:</b> One who said that a certain item will be <b>like non-sacred</b> food, or <b>like pig meat,</b> or <b>like</b> an object of <b>idol worship. And if it did not teach</b> the case of <b>non-sacred</b> food, <b>I would say</b> that although the vow does not take effect, it still <b>requires,</b> by rabbinic law, <b>a request</b> to a halakhic authority for its dissolution.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But is there</b> any reason <b>to consider this</b> interpretation? <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches</b> with regard to a man <b>who says to his wife: You are hereby to me like</b> my <b>mother,</b> that dissolution is <b>broached with him by</b> suggesting <b>a different extenuation, it may be inferred that</b> the vow in <b>the first clause does not necessitate a request</b> to a halakhic authority. <b>Rather,</b> the interpretation of Ravina must be rejected, and <b>it is clear</b> that the case of <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>was cited tangentially</b> to the other cases in the mishna.

### Part 5
§ With regard to the principle that a prohibition cannot be created by associating a permitted item with one forbidden by Torah law, the Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “When a man takes a vow to the Lord”</b> (Numbers 30:3), which indicates that a vow does not take effect <b>until one takes a vow</b> by associating the status <b>of an item that is</b> forbidden by means of <b>a vow</b> with another item. If the item one is using to create the prohibition is forbidden by Torah law, the vow does not take effect.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even</b> if the item in the vow is associated <b>with an item forbidden</b> by Torah law, the vow should <b>also</b> take effect, <b>as</b> following that phrase in the verse <b>it is written: “To bind his soul with a bond [<i>issar</i>],”</b> which indicates that the association can be with an item forbidden [<i>asur</i>] by Torah law. The Gemara answers: The phrase <b>“To bind his soul with a bond” is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (12a): <b>What is the bond mentioned in the Torah.</b> The <i>baraita</i> derives from this phrase that a vow that associates the relevant item with an item whose prohibition was created by a pre-existing vow takes effect, but one whose prohibition is by Torah law does not take effect.

### Part 7
§ It is stated in the mishna that with regard to a man <b>who says to his wife: You are hereby</b> to me <b>like</b> my <b>mother,</b> dissolution is broached with him suggesting a different extenuation, i.e., by rabbinic law it is treated like an actual vow and it requires dissolution by a halakhic authority. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that states that if a man says to his wife: <b>You are hereby to me like the flesh of</b> my <b>mother,</b> or <b>like the flesh of my sister,</b> or <b>like the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting [<i>orla</i>], or like</b> forbidden mixtures of <b>diverse kinds</b> planted <b>in a vineyard,</b> all forbidden items, <b>he has said nothing.</b> This indicates that he does not even have to make a request to a halakhic authority.

### Part 8
<b>Abaye said: He has said nothing by Torah law,</b> as the vow does not take effect. <b>However, he needs</b> to make <b>a request</b> to a halakhic authority <b>by rabbinic law. Rava said: That</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to Torah scholars,</b> who are aware that this vow does not take effect. <b>This</b> mishna, on the other hand, is referring <b>to an ignoramus,</b> with regard to whom a rabbinic ordinance is necessary lest they take vows lightly.

### Part 9
The Gemara comments: <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who takes a vow</b> by associating an item <b>with a Torah</b> scroll <b>has not said anything,</b> i.e., the vow does not take effect. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: But</b> nevertheless, <b>he needs</b> to make <b>a request to a halakhic authority</b> for dissolution of the vow. <b>And Rav Naḥman said: And</b> if he is <b>a Torah scholar</b> he <b>does not need</b> to make <b>a request.</b> The postulation of Rava, which states that with regard to some vows that do not take effect it is necessary to make a request to a halakhic authority only if they are taken by an ignoramus, can be seen from here.
