### Part 1
<b>But if</b> it is a case where the husband of a betrothed young woman <b>heard and ratified</b> the vow, <b>or where he heard, and was silent, and died on the following day,</b> in which case his silence is considered ratification of the vow, then the father <b>cannot nullify</b> the vow.

### Part 2
If <b>her father heard</b> or was made aware of the vow <b>and nullified</b> it <b>for her but the husband did not manage to hear</b> of the vow <b>before the father died, this is what we learned</b> in the same mishna (70a): If <b>the father dies, the authority</b> over her vows <b>does not revert to the husband,</b> i.e., a young womanâ€™s betrothed cannot nullify her vows alone, without the father. If <b>her husband heard</b> the vow <b>and nullified</b> it <b>for her, and the father did not manage to hear</b> of the vow <b>before the husband died, this is what we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>If the husband dies, the authority reverts to the father.</b>

### Part 3
If <b>her husband heard and nullified</b> the vow <b>for her, and the father did not manage to hear</b> of the vow <b>before he died, the husband cannot nullify</b> it, although she no longer has a father, <b>as the husband can nullify</b> vows <b>only in partnership</b> with the father.
