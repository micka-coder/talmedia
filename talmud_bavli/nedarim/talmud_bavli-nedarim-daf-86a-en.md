### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Ila said: And what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>if</b> one person <b>says to another</b> before selling him a field: <b>This field that I am selling to you</b> now, <b>when I will buy it</b> back <b>from you, let it be consecrated? Is</b> the field <b>not consecrated</b> when it is repurchased? In similar fashion, a woman can consecrate her future handiwork, even though the sanctity cannot presently take effect.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya objects to this</b> comparison: <b>Are</b> the two cases <b>comparable?</b> When a person says: Let <b>this field that I am selling to you</b> now be consecrated when I buy it back from you, <b>now</b> at least the field <b>is</b> still <b>in his possession,</b> and he can therefore consecrate it now, stipulating that the consecration should take effect only when it returns to his ownership. As for the <b>woman,</b> however, is it currently <b>in her power to consecrate her handiwork?</b> At present it does not belong to her. <b>This</b> case <b>is comparable only to</b> that of <b>one who said to another:</b> With regard to <b>this field that I sold to you</b> in the past, <b>when I will buy it</b> back <b>from you, let it be consecrated.</b> In such a case, <b>is</b> the field <b>consecrated</b> when it is repurchased?

### Part 3
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this</b> comparison: <b>Are</b> the cases <b>comparable? In</b> the case of <b>the sale</b> of a field, <b>the matter is clear-cut,</b> i.e., it is evident that the field belongs absolutely to its new owner, the buyer. In contrast, <b>in</b> the case of <b>a woman, is the matter clear-cut?</b> Even though the husband has rights to his wife’s handiwork, he does not own her body. Therefore, <b>this</b> case of a woman <b>is comparable only to</b> that of one person <b>who said to another:</b> With regard to <b>this field that I pledged to you, when I will redeem it</b> back <b>from you, let it be consecrated.</b> Here, the owner retains possession of the field itself, but another person enjoys the right to its fruit. In this case, <b>is</b> the field <b>not consecrated</b> when it is redeemed? Here too, a woman retains ownership of her body and she can consecrate her handiwork, stipulating that the consecration should take effect only after she is divorced.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, objects to this</b> comparison: <b>Are</b> the cases <b>comparable?</b> In the case of <b>a field, it is in</b> the owner’s <b>power to redeem it</b> immediately by repaying his debt. But as for <b>a woman,</b> is it <b>in her power to be divorced</b> whenever she chooses? Therefore, <b>this</b> case <b>is comparable only to</b> that of <b>one who said to another:</b> With regard to <b>this field that I pledged to you for ten years, when I will redeem it from you, let it be consecrated.</b> In such a case, even though the owner cannot redeem the field for ten years, <b>is it not consecrated</b> once it is redeemed?

### Part 5
<b>Rav Ashi objects to this</b> comparison: <b>Are</b> the cases <b>comparable? There,</b> in the case of a field, there is a <b>fixed</b> time frame of ten years. But in the case of <b>a woman, is there a fixed</b> time limit, so that she can know in advance when she will be divorced and released from her husband’s jurisdiction?
