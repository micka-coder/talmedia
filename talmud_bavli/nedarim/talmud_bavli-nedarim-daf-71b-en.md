### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>Beit Shammai hold: Even</b> with regard to <b>vows that were disclosed to the betrothed,</b> in the event of his death, his <b>authority reverts to the father.</b> In addition, when the father or husband of a young woman nullifies her vow, <b>he severs</b> his portion of it, enabling the father to nullify her vow on his own after the death of the betrothed. <b>Beit Hillel hold</b> that <b>her father and her final husband</b> together <b>nullify her vows, and he</b> who nullifies her vow <b>does not sever</b> it, but rather weakens its force. Even if the first betrothed was aware of the vow before his death, the father can nullify it in conjunction with another betrothed. This ruling is in accordance with the ruling of Shmuel that her final betrothed can nullify even those vows that she took while betrothed to the first man.

### Part 2
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is a husband’s <b>divorce</b> of his wife after she took a vow considered <b>like silence, or</b> is it considered <b>like ratification</b> of the vow?

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <b>difference</b> between the two possibilities? In any case, he did not nullify her vow before the divorce, and once he has divorced her he can no longer do so. The Gemara answers: There is a difference <b>in</b> a case <b>where she took a vow, and her husband heard</b> the vow, <b>and divorced her, and he remarried her on the same day. If the Master says</b> that divorce is <b>like silence,</b> the husband <b>can</b> now <b>nullify</b> the vow <b>for her,</b> since it is the same day. <b>But if the Master says</b> that divorce is <b>like ratification, he cannot nullify</b> the vow <b>for her,</b> as he has ratified it by divorcing her.
