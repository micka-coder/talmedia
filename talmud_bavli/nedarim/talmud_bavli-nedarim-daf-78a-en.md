### Part 1
<b>“This is the thing”</b> (Numbers 30:2), to teach that the husband nullifies vows and <b>a halakhic authority dissolves</b> vows, <b>but a husband does not dissolve</b> them. It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The phrase <b>“this is the thing”</b> teaches that <b>a husband nullifies</b> vows <b>but a halakhic authority does not nullify</b> vows. <b>As,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Just as a husband, who cannot dissolve</b> vows, nevertheless <b>nullifies</b> them, so too with regard to <b>a halakhic authority, who can dissolve</b> vows, <b>is it not logical that he should</b> also <b>nullify</b> them? Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This is the thing,”</b> to teach us that <b>a husband nullifies</b> vows, <b>but a halakhic authority does not nullify</b> them.

### Part 2
It is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to vows: <b>“This is the thing,” and it is stated elsewhere:</b> “Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them: <b>This is the thing</b> which the Lord has commanded, saying” (Leviticus 17:2), <b>in</b> the verse introducing the prohibition against <b>slaughtering</b> offerings <b>outside</b> of the Temple courtyard. <b>Just as with regard to</b> offerings <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Temple courtyard, the verse is directed to <b>Aaron and his sons and all</b> of <b>Israel, so too, the portion</b> in the Torah <b>about vows</b> is directed to <b>Aaron and his sons and all</b> of <b>Israel. And just as here,</b> with regard to vows, the verse states: “And Moses spoke to <b>the heads of the tribes</b> of the children of Israel” (Numbers 30:2), <b>so too, there,</b> with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Temple courtyard, Moses spoke to <b>the heads of the tribes.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to the</b> Torah <b>portion on vows, for what <i>halakha</i></b> is the verbal analogy between it and slaughtering offerings outside the Temple courtyard taught? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says:</b> The verbal analogy is the source <b>to authorize three laymen</b> to dissolve vows. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t it written: “The heads of the tribes”? Rav Ḥisda said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> From the phrase “the heads of the tribes” the Sages derive that vows can also be dissolved <b>by a single expert.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara then asks the corresponding question about the other passage. The verbal analogy connects <b>“the heads of the tribes” to</b> offerings <b>slaughtered outside</b> of the Temple courtyard. <b>For what <i>halakha</i></b> is this connection made? <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> This connection is made in order <b>to say that there is</b> a concept of <b>requesting</b> dissolution of consecration <b>of consecrated</b> property.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>According to Beit Shammai, who say</b> that <b>there is no</b> possibility of <b>requesting</b> from a halakhic authority to cancel the consecration <b>of consecrated</b> property, the treatment of the verse <b>“the heads of the tribes” as</b> if <b>it were written</b> also <b>about</b> offerings <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Temple courtyard serves <b>to</b> teach <b>what <i>halakha</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Beit Shammai do not have</b> a tradition of interpreting the verses in accordance with this <b>verbal analogy.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: Since Beit Shammai do not use this verbal analogy, <b>for what</b> purpose <b>is “this is the thing,” in the portion on vows, written?</b> The Gemara answers: It is written <b>to say</b> that only <b>a halakhic authority dissolves</b> vows, <b>but a husband does not dissolve</b> them; <b>a husband nullifies</b> vows, <b>but a halakhic authority does not nullify</b> them.

### Part 7
According to Beit Shammai, <b>for what</b> purpose <b>is written</b> the phrase <b>“this is the thing,”</b> found <b>in</b> the portion on offerings <b>slaughtered outside</b> of the Temple courtyard? The Gemara answers: It is written <b>to say</b> that one <b>is liable for slaughtering</b> outside, <b>but</b> one is <b>not liable for pinching</b> the neck of a bird-offering outside the Temple courtyard, although that is the way it would be killed if it were a valid offering in the Temple.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Beit Shammai,</b> who do not accept the verbal analogy between vows and the prohibition against slaughtering offerings outside of the Temple courtyard, <b>from where do we</b> derive the source <b>to authorize three laymen</b> to dissolve vows? The Gemara answers: Beit Shammai <b>derive it from</b> the explanation given to <b>Rav Asi bar Natan.</b>

### Part 9
This is <b>as it is written: “And Moses declared the Festivals of the Lord to the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 23:44). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: The Festivals are stated, but Shabbat,</b> which commemorates <b>Creation, is not stated with them. Ben Azzai says: The Festivals are stated, but the portion on vows is not stated with them.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Asi bar Natan had a difficulty with this <i>baraita</i>. He came to Neharde’a</b> to ask about it <b>before Rav Sheshet, but he did not find him</b> there. <b>He pursued him to Meḥoza</b> and <b>said to</b> him: How can the <i>baraita</i> say that <b>the Festivals of the Lord were stated, but Shabbat,</b> which commemorates <b>Creation, was not stated with them?</b>

### Part 11
<b>But Shabbat is written with them</b> in the portions of the Torah about the Festivals (Leviticus 23:3; Numbers 28:9–10). <b>And furthermore,</b> can it be said that <b>the Festivals of the Lord are stated, but the portion on vows</b> (Numbers, chapter 30) <b>is not stated with them? Isn’t it next to</b> one of the portions in the Torah detailing the <i>halakhot</i> of the Festivals (Numbers, chapters 28–29)? Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: This is what</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s statement in the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching:</b>
