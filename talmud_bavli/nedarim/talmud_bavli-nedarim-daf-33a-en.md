### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t he vow</b> that he is prohibited <b>from</b> partaking of <b>food,</b> and those items are not food items? <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where he says: Benefit from your food is forbidden to me,</b> which includes any benefit associated with food.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Say that</b> the result of a vow formulated in that manner is that <b>he may not chew wheat</b> kernels belonging to the one from whose food benefit is forbidden <b>and place</b> them <b>on his wound,</b> as that is a benefit that results from food. However, that vow does not render items used in the preparation of food forbidden. <b>Rava said</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where he says: Benefit that leads to</b> preparation of <b>your food is forbidden to me.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Borrowing from him <b>a sack</b> in which <b>to bring produce, or a donkey upon which to bring produce, or even merely a basket,</b> each renders <b>benefit that leads to food,</b> and this benefit is forbidden. <b>Rav Pappa raised a dilemma:</b> If he seeks to borrow <b>a horse upon which to</b> ride <b>or a ring with which to be seen</b> when attending a feast, to create the impression that he is wealthy, <b>what is</b> the ruling? Is it prohibited to borrow these items, since having them in one’s possession may indirectly result in his being served before others or being served higher-quality food; and therefore, borrowing those items provides benefit that leads to food? With regard to <b>traversing and walking on his land</b> that facilitates one’s quick return home, enabling him to eat sooner, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 4
The Gemara proposes: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: <b>However, he may lend him a garment, and a cloak, and nose rings, and finger rings.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of that situation? <b>If we say</b> it is a case <b>where</b> it is <b>not</b> the borrower’s intent <b>to be seen with them,</b> and therefore there is no benefit that leads to food, does this <b>need to be said?</b> The vow rendered only food forbidden. <b>Rather, isn’t</b> this <i>halakha</i> stated <b>even</b> in a case where he borrowed those items <b>to be seen with them, and it is taught</b> in the mishna that <b>he may lend</b> it to <b>him?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara refutes this. <b>No, actually</b> the mishna is referring to a case where he borrowed those items with the intention <b>not to be seen</b> with them. In response to the question: Is it necessary to say so, the Gemara answers that it is not necessary to teach this <i>halakha</i>. However, <b>since it is taught</b> in <b>the first clause: He may not lend him,</b> when listing the matters that may not be loaned, the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught the latter clause</b> of the mishna with a parallel formulation: <b>He may lend him.</b> Rav Pappa’s dilemma remains unresolved.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And</b> with regard to <b>any item that one does not use in the preparation of food,</b> in <b>a place where one rents</b> items <b>of that kind,</b> that item is <b>forbidden.</b> Meaning, one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow is prohibited from borrowing this type of item from the one who vowed and imposed the prohibition. This is because one can use the money saved by borrowing the item rather than renting it to purchase food.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara states: <b>By inference,</b> one may conclude <b>that the first clause</b> of the mishna, which states that the one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow is prohibited from deriving benefit from utensils used in the preparation of food, e.g., a sieve or a strainer, applies <b>even if</b> they are a place <b>where one does not rent</b> items of that kind but typically lends them at no cost. The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this mishna? <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said: It is Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who maintains that overlooking is prohibited in the case of one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one prohibited by vow from deriving benefit from another,</b> if that other person chooses, <b>he may contribute the half-shekel</b> to the Temple <b>on his</b> behalf, <b>and repay his debt, and return his lost item to him,</b> and the one prohibited from benefiting is not considered to have benefited from him. In <b>a place where one takes payment</b> for returning a lost item, that <b>benefit should fall into</b> the category of <b>consecrated</b> Temple property.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna allowed one who vowed and imposed the prohibition to pay the financial obligations of the one who is prohibited by vow to derive benefit from him. Based on this, the Gemara concludes: <b>Apparently,</b> repaying his debts is tantamount to <b>merely driving away a lion</b> from him, <b>and</b> it is <b>permitted.</b> He is not actually giving him anything. Rather, he is preventing potential future harm. That is not considered a benefit.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that in performing the actions listed in the mishna one is merely preventing harm? <b>Rav Hoshaya said: This</b>
