### Part 1
<b>And</b> this is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Yehuda.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> this, it does not mean that before she went she was permitted to derive benefit from him <i>ab initio</i>. Rather, it means <b>that if she derived benefit</b> from him after the fact, <b>she is in</b> violation of: <b>He shall not profane his word.</b>

### Part 3
<b>We learn</b> further on (57b) that if the husband said to his wife: <b>Deriving benefit from me until the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> is <i>konam</i> <b>for you if you go to your father’s house until Passover,</b> then, if <b>she went before Passover, she</b> is <b>prohibited from deriving benefit from him until the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, as the vow took effect, <b>and she is permitted to go</b> to her father’s house <b>after Passover.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara infers: Only if <b>she went</b> before Passover is it <b>prohibited for her</b> to derive benefit from him. However, if <b>she did not go</b> it is <b>not</b> prohibited for her to do so. She may derive benefit from him, and there is no concern that she will subsequently go to her father’s house, transgressing the prohibition. This is difficult according to the opinion of Rav Yehuda that one may not perform an action that will be rendered retroactively a violation of a vow if the condition is met.

### Part 5
<b>Rava said: The same is true, that even if she did not go, she</b> is <b>prohibited from</b> deriving benefit from him. The difference is that if <b>she went</b> it is not only <b>prohibited for her</b> to derive benefit from him, <b>but</b> if she does so <b>she is flogged;</b> whereas if <b>she did not go,</b> it is <b>merely prohibited for her</b> to derive benefit from him, lest she violate the vow by going to her father’s house before Passover.

### Part 6
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Yehuda: It is taught in a <i>baraita</i> that if one said: <b>This loaf is</b> forbidden <b>to me today if I go to such and such a place tomorrow,</b> then if <b>he ate</b> the loaf today, <b>he is subject to</b> the prohibition that <b>he shall not go</b> tomorrow. Apparently, he may eat it today, as there is no concern that he will go tomorrow.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: Where is the contradiction? <b>Does</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> that <b>he may eat</b> the loaf <i>ab initio</i>? <b>It teaches</b> only that <b>he ate,</b> i.e., <b>that once he ate, he is subject to</b> the prohibition that <b>he shall not go.</b>

### Part 8
It is further taught in the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he went</b> the next day, <b>he is in</b> violation of: <b>He shall not profane his word.</b> The Gemara infers from the fact that the <i>baraita</i> is referring only to a case in which he went after the fact, that <b>he may not go</b> <i>ab initio</i>. This indicates that he is permitted to eat the loaf, thereby prohibiting himself from going the next day. This accords with the opinion of Rav Naḥman that one may cause a vow to take effect by fulfilling its condition, <b>and</b> it poses <b>a difficulty to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yehuda</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>the same is true, that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>could have taught</b> that <b>he may go.</b> However, <b>since the first clause teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> where <b>he ate</b> the loaf after the fact, <b>as it cannot teach</b> that <b>he may eat</b> it according to Rav Yehuda, who holds that it is prohibited for him to eat it <i>ab initio</i>, <b>the latter clause</b> also <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case where <b>he went,</b> and does not teach that he may go, to maintain a uniform style. In conclusion, neither opinion is refuted.

### Part 10
§ It is taught in the mishna that with regard to <b>one who says to his wife: Engaging in sexual intercourse with you is <i>konam</i> for me,</b> if he violates the vow <b>he is in</b> violation of the prohibition: <b>He shall not profane his word.</b> The Gemara asks: How can one render prohibited engaging in sexual intercourse with his wife? <b>But isn’t he duty bound by Torah law to</b> engage in sexual intercourse with <b>her, as it is written: “Her food, her clothing, and her conjugal rights he may not diminish”</b> (Exodus 21:10)?

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: The vow does not take effect if it is formulated as cited. Rather, the mishna is referring to a case <b>where he says: The pleasure</b> I derive <b>from</b> engaging in <b>sexual intercourse with you is</b> forbidden <b>to me, and sexual intercourse is</b> therefore <b>not amenable to him.</b> Since he is not obligated to experience the pleasure he derives from sexual intercourse with her, he can prohibit himself from experiencing this pleasure. In this manner he can render their sexual intercourse forbidden by means of a vow.

### Part 12
<b>As Rav Kahana said:</b> If a woman vows: <b>Sexual intercourse with me is</b> forbidden <b>to you,</b> the court <b>coerces her to engage in sexual intercourse with him, as she is duty bound to</b> engage in sexual intercourse with <b>him</b> due to his conjugal rights. However, if she vows: <b>The pleasure</b> I derive <b>from</b> engaging in <b>sexual intercourse with you is</b> forbidden <b>to me, it is prohibited</b> for them to engage in sexual intercourse, <b>as</b> she derives pleasure from the sexual intercourse and <b>one may not feed a person that which is forbidden to him.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one says: I take <b>an oath that I will not sleep,</b> or: <b>That I will not speak,</b> or: <b>That I will not walk,</b> this activity is <b>prohibited</b> to him. As taught earlier (10a), one of the primary methods of taking a vow is by invoking an offering. The mishna provides several examples where invoking the term <i>korban</i> is not effective. If one says: <b>An offering [<i>korban</i>] that I will not eat of yours,</b> or: <b>This offering [<i>ha korban</i>] that I will eat of yours,</b> or: That which <b>I will not eat of yours</b> is <b>not an offering [<i>la korban</i>],</b> the food is <b>permitted.</b>
