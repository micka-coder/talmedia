### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>With what are we dealing? If</b> it is a case <b>where the property of the visitor is forbidden to the ill person, even</b> if he is <b>sitting,</b> this should <b>also</b> be permitted. <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where the property of the ill person is forbidden to the visitor, even</b> if he is <b>standing,</b> it should <b>also not</b> be permitted, as one derives benefit from entering the house. <b>Shmuel said: Actually,</b> it is a case <b>where the property of the visitor is forbidden to the ill person, and</b> it is <b>in a place where one takes payment for</b> visiting and <b>sitting</b> with an ill person <b>and one does not take payment for</b> visiting and <b>standing</b> with an ill person. Therefore, by sitting with the ill person the visitor provides him forbidden benefit by sparing him the expense of hiring another person to sit with him.

### Part 2
<b>Why</b> was this distinction stated <b>without qualification?</b> There is no apparent fundamental difference between sitting and standing when visiting the ill. The Gemara answers: It <b>teaches us this: Even in a place where one takes payment</b> for visiting the ill, <b>for sitting, one ought to take</b> payment, but <b>for standing, one ought not to take</b> payment. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the distinction can be explained <b>in accordance with</b> the statement that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim</b> said elsewhere (42a), that one who is prohibited to derive benefit from another due to a rabbinic <b>decree</b> may not enter a field that is owned by the latter, <b>lest he remain standing</b> there longer than permitted. <b>Here too,</b> sitting is prohibited due to a rabbinic <b>decree, lest he remain sitting</b> there longer than is necessary to perform the mitzva of visiting the ill.

### Part 3
<b>Ulla said: Actually,</b> it is a case <b>where the property of the ill person is forbidden to the visitor, and where</b> the ill person <b>did not vow</b> that his property would be forbidden in cases where its use enables the visitor to meet needs pertaining to <b>his</b> continued <b>existence.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even sitting</b> should be permitted <b>as well,</b> since the vow did not prohibit use pertaining to his existential needs. The Gemara answers: <b>Isn’t it possible</b> to meet those needs and visit the ill <b>while standing?</b> Therefore, sitting is not an existential need.

### Part 4
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If he became ill, he enters to visit him; if his son became ill, he inquires</b> about <b>his</b> son’s health <b>in the marketplace</b> but may not enter the house to visit him. <b>Granted, according to Ulla, who said:</b> It is a case <b>where the property of the ill person is forbidden to the visitor and where</b> the ill person <b>did not vow</b> that the property be forbidden in cases pertaining to his continued <b>existence,</b> this works out <b>well,</b> as he excluded his own existential needs from the vow, not his son’s existential needs.

### Part 5
<b>However, according to Shmuel, who said:</b> It is a case <b>where the property of the visitor is forbidden to the ill person, what is different</b> about <b>him and what is different</b> about <b>his son?</b> Why is it prohibited for him to visit when the son is ill? The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you: The mishna</b> is referring to a case <b>where the property of the visitor is forbidden to the ill person; the <i>baraita</i></b> is referring to a case <b>where the property of the ill person is forbidden to the visitor.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> was this distinction between the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> stated <b>without qualification? Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>Shmuel,</b>
