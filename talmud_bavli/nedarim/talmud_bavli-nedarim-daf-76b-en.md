### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, generally they do teach</b> <i>halakhot</i> based upon an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference of this type, <b>but here it is different, as the verse states: “Her husband may ratify it, or her husband may nullify it”</b> (Numbers 30:14). The Rabbis interpret this to mean: <b>That which has become eligible</b> for <b>ratification,</b> i.e., a vow that she has already taken, <b>has become eligible for nullification.</b> However, <b>that which has not become eligible</b> for <b>ratification,</b> i.e., a vow she has not yet taken, <b>has not become eligible for nullification.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The <b>nullification of vows</b> can be performed <b>all day</b> on the day on which the vow was heard. <b>There is in this matter</b> both <b>a leniency,</b> extending the nullification period, <b>and a stricture,</b> curtailing that period.

### Part 3
<b>How so?</b> If a woman <b>took a vow on Shabbat evening,</b> her father or husband <b>can nullify</b> the vow <b>on Shabbat evening, and on Shabbat day until dark.</b> This is an example of extending the nullification period. However, if <b>she took a vow with nightfall</b> approaching, her father or husband <b>can nullify</b> the vow only <b>until nightfall, since, if it became dark and he had not</b> yet <b>nullified</b> her vow, <b>he cannot nullify</b> it anymore. This is an example of a curtailed nullification period.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>nullification of vows</b> can be performed <b>all day</b> on the day on which the vow was heard. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, said:</b> A vow can be nullified <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> from the time it was heard. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for the</b> opinion of the <b>first <i>tanna</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: Since <b>the verse states:</b> “But if her husband make them null and void <b>on the day that he hears them”</b> (Numbers 30:13), he derives that the husband can nullify his wife’s vow only until the end of the day on which he hears the vow.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis,</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>what is their reason?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is written: “From day to day”</b> (Numbers 30:15), which indicates that a vow can be nullified from a particular hour on one day until the same hour on the following day.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the first <i>tanna</i>, isn’t it written: “From day to day”?</b> The Gemara answers: That verse <b>is necessary, as if</b> it had said only <b>“on the day that he hears them,” I would say</b> that <b>during the day, yes,</b> he can nullify vows, but <b>at night</b> he is <b>not</b> able to. Therefore, <b>it is written: “From day to day,”</b> to teach that nullification can be performed even between one day and the next, i.e., night.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who said</b> that <b>“from day to day”</b> indicates a twenty-four-hour period for nullification, <b>isn’t it written: “On the day that he hears them?”</b> The Gemara explains here, too: That verse <b>was necessary, as if</b> it had <b>written</b> only <b>“from day to day,” I would say</b> that he <b>can nullify</b> a vow <b>for her</b> until the same day in the following week, i.e., he can nullify her vow during the entire period <b>from one Sunday to</b> the next <b>Sunday.</b> Therefore, it <b>is written: “On the day that he hears them”</b> to teach that nullification is limited to a period of a single day of twenty-four hours.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with that pair [<i>zug</i>],</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon, who hold that one has an entire twenty-four-hour period to nullify vows. Rather, one can nullify only on that day, as stated in the mishna. The Gemara relates: <b>Levi thought to act in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>those</b> two <b><i>tanna’im</i>. Rav said to him: So said my uncle [<i>ḥavivi</i>],</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with that pair.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara relates that when a case of dissolving a vow was brought before <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav,</b> he <b>would shoot an arrow [<i>gira</i>] and examine</b> the vow at the same time. In other words, he would not examine the case in great depth, but would immediately dissolve it. Similarly, <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna would sit</b> to review the vow <b>and stand</b> immediately, without conducting a comprehensive examination.
