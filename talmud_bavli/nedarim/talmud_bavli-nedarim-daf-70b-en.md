### Part 1
This verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the vows <b>preceding</b> her <b>second</b> instance of <b>being</b> betrothed, i.e., those that she took after her first husband’s death but before her second betrothal, <b>to those</b> vows <b>preceding</b> her <b>first</b> instance of <b>being</b> betrothed. <b>Just as</b> with regard to the vows <b>preceding</b> her <b>first</b> instance of <b>being</b> betrothed, her <b>father nullifies</b> them <b>on his own, so too,</b> with regard to <b>those</b> vows <b>preceding</b> her <b>second</b> instance of <b>being</b> betrothed, her <b>father nullifies</b> them <b>on his own.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Say</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> that the father nullifies vows on his own after the death of the betrothed <b>applies</b> only <b>to vows that were not disclosed to the betrothed,</b> i.e., those that he did not have the opportunity to either ratify or nullify, <b>but with regard to vows that were disclosed to the betrothed,</b> the <b>father cannot nullify</b> them on his own.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the verse is referring only <b>to vows that were not disclosed to the betrothed,</b> it would be unnecessary to teach that <i>halakha</i>, as that <b>is derived from</b> the words <b>“being in her youth, in her father’s house”</b> (Numbers 30:17). As long as the young woman is in her father’s house, even after the death of her betrothed, her father has the authority to nullify her vows.

### Part 4
§ The mishna states: <b>In this</b> matter, <b>the power of the father is enhanced relative to the power of the husband.</b> In another matter, the power of the husband is enhanced relative to the power of the father, as the husband nullifies vows during the woman’s adulthood, whereas the father does not nullify vows during her adulthood. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> under which a husband can nullify his adult wife’s vows?

### Part 5
<b>If we say</b> that the mishna is referring to a cases <b>where he betrothed her when she was a young woman,</b> and she took a vow, <b>and</b> then <b>she reached majority,</b> that cannot be the <i>halakha</i>: <b>After all,</b> both the <b>death</b> of her father <b>removes her</b> from the father’s authority <b>and</b> attaining her <b>majority removes her from the father’s authority,</b> so the <i>halakha</i> in the two cases should be the same. <b>Just as</b> with the <b>death</b> of the father, his <b>authority does not revert to the husband</b> and the woman’s betrothed cannot nullify her vows on his own, <b>so too,</b> upon attaining <b>majority</b> the <b>authority</b> the father possessed when she was a young woman <b>does not revert to the husband.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rather,</b> it is referring to a case in <b>which he betrothed her when she was a grown woman,</b> and then she took a vow. <b>The Gemara asks: Didn’t we</b> already <b>learn</b> that <b>on another occasion,</b> in a later mishna that states (73b): With regard to <b>a grown woman who waited twelve months</b> after her betrothal and then requested that her betrothed marry her, Rabbi Eliezer says: Since her husband is already obligated to provide for her sustenance, as he is obligated to have married her by then, he can nullify her vows by himself, as if he were fully married to her.

### Part 7
The Gemara explains the cited mishna: <b>This</b> cited mishna <b>is itself difficult: You said</b> that <b>a grown woman who waited twelve</b> months is entitled to support. <b>With regard to a grown woman, why do I</b> need <b>a twelve-month</b> waiting period before her betrothed is obligated to marry her? For <b>a grown woman, thirty days suffice for her</b> to prepare what she needs for her marriage after she is betrothed. The Gemara answers: The mishna should be revised. <b>Teach</b> the mishna: <b>A grown woman</b> who waited thirty days <b>and</b> a young woman <b>who waited twelve months.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara returns to the question: <b>In any case,</b> the fact that the mishna here teaches a <i>halakha</i> that is addressed in a different mishna is <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the mishna <b>here</b> is <b>actually</b> the primary source of this <i>halakha</i>, <b>and</b> the reference to <b>a grown woman is taught there because</b> it <b>wants</b> to present how <b>Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis disagree.</b>

### Part 9
Alternatively, <b>if you wish, say</b> that the mishna that begins: <b>A grown woman,</b> is <b>actually</b> the source for this <i>halakha</i>. The mishna here repeats the <i>halakha</i> incidentally, <b>since it needs to cite the first clause: In this</b> matter the power of the father is enhanced relative to the power of the husband, therefore the mishna <b>cites</b> the <b>latter clause</b> as well, by writing: <b>In this</b> other matter, the power of the husband is enhanced relative to the power of the father.
