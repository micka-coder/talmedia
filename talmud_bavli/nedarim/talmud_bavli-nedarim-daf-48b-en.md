### Part 1
There was <b>a certain man who had a son who seized</b> in theft <b>sheaves [<i>keifei</i>] of flax,</b> and the father took a vow <b>prohibiting</b> his son <b>from</b> deriving any benefit <b>from his possessions. They said</b> to the father: <b>And if the son of your son would become a Torah scholar,</b> and you would want him to be able to inherit your possessions, <b>what</b> would you do? <b>He said to them: Let this</b> son of mine <b>acquire</b> the possessions, <b>and</b> only <b>if the son of my son becomes a Torah scholar</b> then <b>let him,</b> my grandson, <b>acquire them</b> from my son. They asked: <b>What</b> is the ruling?

### Part 2
The Sages <b>of Pumbedita say:</b> This is just as if he stated: <b>Acquire</b> the property <b>on the condition that you transfer</b> it to your son. In such a case he has not given anything to the recipient, but has merely made him a conduit to transfer the item to someone else. <b>And</b> in <b>any</b> case where one says: <b>Acquire</b> this item <b>on the condition that you transfer</b> ownership, the recipient <b>does not acquire</b> the item, and the statement has no effect.

### Part 3
<b>But Rav Naḥman said: He does acquire, as an</b> acquisition by means of <b>a cloth is</b> a case of an act of <b>acquisition</b> performed only <b>in order to transfer</b> ownership. In such a case, one gives another a cloth in order to confer ownership of some other item, but the cloth itself does not assume new ownership. Still, this is an effective means of acquisition. So too, the property of the grandfather may be effectively conferred upon the grandson through the son, without the son acquiring it himself.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ashi said: And who will say to us concerning the cloth that if</b> the recipient of the cloth would <b>seize it</b> with the intention of keeping it that it would <b>not</b> be an effective <b>seizure?</b> While the cloth is technically transferred, the recipient does not usually exercise his right to it. <b>And furthermore,</b> an acquisition by means of <b>a cloth</b> is a case where the giver is saying: <b>Acquire</b> only <b>in order to transfer</b> ownership, <b>but acquire from now.</b> However, with regard to <b>these possessions of this</b> one who took the vow, <b>when does</b> the son <b>acquire?</b> Only <b>when his son’s son becomes a Torah scholar. And when he becomes</b> a Torah scholar, <b>the cloth has</b> already been <b>returned to its owner,</b> i.e., the act of acquisition had taken place long before the grandson became a Torah scholar. The initial transfer therefore has no effect.

### Part 5
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: But the gift of Beit Ḥoron</b> discussed in the mishna <b>is</b> an example of an <b>acquisition</b> performed only <b>in order to transfer</b> ownership, <b>and</b> there <b>he did not acquire</b> it at all.

### Part 6
The Gemara recounts: <b>Sometimes</b> when Rav Naḥman was asked this question <b>he said to him:</b> That is <b>because his</b> wedding <b>meal proves about him</b> that he did not truly intend to give the items to the recipient, and not because such an acquisition is invalid per se. <b>And sometimes he said to him</b> that in <b>that</b> case they followed the stringent opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said: Even</b> negligible benefits ordinarily <b>waived</b> are <b>forbidden to one prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit</b> from another. So too, Rabbi Eliezer holds that one cannot rely on an act of acquisition performed merely in order to transfer ownership to a third party.

### Part 7
§ <b>We learned</b> in the mishna (48a): <b>The Sages</b> therefore <b>said: Any gift that is not</b> so absolute so <b>that, if</b> the recipient <b>were to consecrate</b> the gift <b>it would be consecrated, is not a gift.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the word: <b>Any? Is it not adding this matter of</b> one who <b>seized sheaves</b> of flax, and to say that the gift of the father has no effect? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the intent is <b>to add the latter version of the</b> aforementioned <b>statement of Rava,</b> that a gift given as a means of circumventing a vow has no effect, even when the giver mentions the nature of the gift only casually and does not stipulate it as a formal condition.
