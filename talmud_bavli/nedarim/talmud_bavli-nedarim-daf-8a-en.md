### Part 1
<b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may take an oath to fulfill a mitzva?</b> It is <b>as it is stated: “I have sworn and I have confirmed it, to observe Your righteous ordinances”</b> (Psalms 119:106).

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Is he not already under oath from</b> when each Jew took an oath at <b>Mount Sinai</b> to fulfill all the mitzvot? An oath cannot take effect if one is already bound by a different oath. <b>Rather,</b> it <b>teaches us this: It is permitted for a man to motivate himself</b> to fulfill the mitzvot in this manner, although the oath is not technically valid.

### Part 3
<b>And Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said: One who says: I will rise early and study this chapter,</b> or: <b>I will study this tractate, has taken a great vow to the God of Israel.</b> This clearly indicates that the vow takes effect. The Gemara asks: <b>Is he not already under oath</b> due to the general obligation to study Torah? <b>And an oath does not take effect upon a</b> preexisting <b>oath. What is he teaching us?</b> If one claims that Rav Giddel is teaching <b>that</b> such a vow may be made <b>even merely</b> to <b>motivate oneself</b> to study, <b>this is</b> the same as <b>the first</b> statement <b>of Rav Giddel.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: It <b>teaches us this: Since if he desires he can exempt himself</b> from the obligation to study Torah <b>with the recitation</b> of <b><i>Shema</i></b> in the <b>morning and evening, due to that</b> reason <b>the oath takes effect upon him</b> and he is obligated to study the chapter or tractate that he specified.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>one who says to another: Let us rise early and study this chapter,</b> and they agree to do so, <b>it is</b> incumbent <b>upon him to rise early</b> and be the first to arrive, because it was his initiative. There is an allusion to this in a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And He said to me: Arise, go forth into the plain, and there I will speak with you.</b> Then I arose <b>and went forth into the plain; and behold, the glory of the Lord stood there”</b> (Ezekiel 3:22–23). God invited Ezekiel to that place, and His glory arrived before Ezekiel did.

### Part 6
§ <b>Rav Yosef said: One</b> who <b>was ostracized in a dream requires ten people to dissolve</b> the ostracism <b>for him. And</b> the ostracism can be dissolved <b>only</b> by those <b>who have studied <i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., by Torah scholars. <b>However,</b> if they have <b>recited Mishna and have not studied</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>no,</b> they are not fit to dissolve the ostracism. <b>And if there are not</b> ten people <b>who have studied <i>halakha</i>,</b> then <b>even</b> those <b>who have recited Mishna and have not studied</b> <i>halakha</i> are fit to dissolve the ostracism.

### Part 7
<b>And if there are not</b> even ten people who have studied Mishna, <b>let him go and sit at the crossroads and extend</b> a greeting of <b><i>shalom</i>,</b> meaning peace, <b>to ten people,</b> who will respond with a similar greeting, <b>until ten</b> individuals <b>who have studied <i>halakha</i> happen to come to him.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> If <b>he knows who excommunicated him</b> in his dream, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Can that individual <b>dissolve</b> the excommunication <b>for him?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> It is possible that <b>he was appointed</b> by Heaven <b>as an agent to excommunicate him,</b> but <b>he was not appointed as an agent to dissolve</b> the excommunication <b>for him.</b> Consequently, the excommunication can be dissolved only by ten people.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Aḥa said to Rav Ashi:</b> If <b>he was excommunicated and</b> the excommunication was <b>dissolved for him in his dream, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Just as it is impossible for the grain</b> to grow <b>without straw,</b>
