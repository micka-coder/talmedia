### Part 1
<b>If you wish, say</b> instead: <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, in which it is taught that the item does not leave the possession of the owner until it enters the possession of another, is referring to a case <b>where</b> one declared it ownerless <b>before two</b> people; <b>and this</b> <i>baraita</i>, in which it is taught that the item is ownerless when it is declared ownerless, is referring to a case <b>where</b> one declared it ownerless <b>before three</b> people. <b>As Rabbi Yoá¸¥anan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who declares</b> an item <b>ownerless before three</b> people, that item <b>is ownerless;</b> if he does so <b>before two</b> people, <b>it is not ownerless.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: By Torah law, even with one</b> person, the item <b>is ownerless, and what</b> is the <b>reason</b> that the Sages <b>said</b> that ownerless status must be declared <b>with three</b> people? It is <b>so that one will take possession</b> of the item <b>and two</b> will <b>testify</b> that the item was declared ownerless and that it was acquired by that person. It is not a requirement fundamental to the declaration of ownerless status.
