### Part 1
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>shall we say that Shmuel holds</b> that <b>ambiguous intimations are not intimations,</b> i.e., if one employs an incomplete expression to declare a vow and the expression does not state clearly what his intention is, it does not produce a vow? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, Shmuel establishes the mishna in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said: Ambiguous intimations are not intimations.</b>

### Part 2
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 85a–b): <b>The essence of a bill of divorce</b> is the sentence: <b>You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man. Rabbi Yehuda says</b> there is an additional statement that is an essential part of the divorce document: <b>And this shall be to you from me a document of divorce [<i>teirukhin</i>] and a letter of dismissal.</b> This demonstrates that according to Rabbi Yehuda, the wording of the bill of divorce itself must clarify that the husband is divorcing his wife through the bill of divorce.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does <b>Shmuel strain to establish the mishna</b> as being <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> which is a minority opinion? <b>Let him establish it</b> as being <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis that although there are no obvious intimations</b> in one’s statements, they are still considered vows. Consequently, if one said: I am avowed to you, even if he did not add: With regard to that which I eat, the vow takes effect.

### Part 4
<b>Rava said: The mishna was difficult for him. Why does it teach</b> the cases where one adds: <b>That</b> which <b>I eat</b> of <b>yours,</b> and: <b>That</b> which <b>I taste</b> of <b>yours? Let it teach: That</b> which <b>I eat,</b> and: <b>That</b> which <b>I taste,</b> without the additional phrase: Of yours. Since the one taking the vow is addressing another individual, it is clear to whom he is referring even without this phrase. <b>Conclude from this</b> that <b>we require obvious intimations,</b> i.e., the intent of the individual taking the vow must be indicated by his verbal statement and not merely by the context of his statement.

### Part 5
§ The Gemara addresses more fully the issue mentioned in passing in the previous discussion. <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to <b>ambiguous intimations. Abaye said: They are</b> valid <b>intimations, and Rava said: They are not</b> valid <b>intimations. Rava said: Rabbi Idi explained to me</b> the source of this ruling. <b>The verse states:</b> “The vow of a <b>nazirite, to consecrate himself [<i>nazir lehazir</i>] to the Lord”</b> (Numbers 6:2). The verse <b>juxtaposes intimations of naziriteship,</b> derived earlier (3a) from the doubled term “<i>nazir lehazir</i>,” <b>to naziriteship.</b> This indicates that <b>just as</b> accepting <b>nazirite-ship</b> must be expressed <b>with a distinct articulation, so too, intimations of naziriteship</b> must be expressed <b>with a distinct articulation</b> as opposed to ambiguous intimations.

### Part 6
The Gemara proposes: <b>Let us say that</b> these <i>amora’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to the</b> tannaitic <b>dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 85a–b): <b>The essence of a bill of divorce</b> is the sentence: <b>You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man. Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that there is an additional statement that is an essential part of the divorce document: <b>And this shall be to you from me a document of divorce, a bill of release, and a letter of dismissal.</b> One could suggest that <b>Abaye,</b> who holds that ambiguous intimations are valid intimations, <b>said</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and Rava,</b> who holds that ambiguous intimations are not valid intimations, <b>said</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara responds: <b>Abaye</b> could have <b>said to you: I say</b> my statement <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>we require obvious intimations only with regard to a bill of divorce, as we require</b> full <b>severance</b> of the relationship, <b>and there is not</b> full severance unless the bill of divorce clearly states that the husband is divorcing his wife through that document. <b>However, did you hear him</b> state <b>generally</b> that ambiguous intimations are not valid intimations?

### Part 8
<b>And Rava</b> could have <b>said: I say</b> my statement <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. The Rabbis say that we do not require obvious intimations only with regard to a bill of divorce,</b>
