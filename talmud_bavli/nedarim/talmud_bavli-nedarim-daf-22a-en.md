### Part 1
<b>Had her mother not seen inappropriate [<i>aziva</i>] matters</b> or behavior <b>in her</b> that should be stopped, <b>she would not have taken a vow with regard to her for nothing;</b> had you known that the neighbors would say that, <b>would you have taken a vow with regard to her? She said to him: No, and he dissolved</b> the vow <b>for her.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>The son of the daughter of Rabbi Yannai the Elder came before Rabbi Yannai the Elder</b> to dissolve a vow. <b>He said to him: Had you known that</b> when you make a vow <b>they open your record book [<i>pinekas</i>]</b> in heaven <b>and examine your actions, would you have vowed? He said to him: No, and he dissolved</b> the vow <b>for him.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Abba said: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived that taking a vow leads to one’s deeds being examined? It is <b>“And after vows to make inquiry”</b> (Proverbs 20:25). This is interpreted to mean that after one takes a vow, his actions are reviewed in heaven. The Gemara comments: <b>And although Rabbi Yannai broached</b> dissolution <b>with him</b> in this way, <b>we do not broach</b> dissolution <b>in this</b> manner <b>for</b> one who vows, by asking if he regrets it because his actions will be examined in heaven. This is because one might be embarrassed, upon hearing such a question, to say that he does not have regret, and he will claim untruthfully that he is regretful.

### Part 4
<b>And we</b> also <b>do not broach</b> dissolution <b>in this other</b> way, <b>as Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What</b> type of dissolution <b>did Rabban Gamliel broach for a certain elderly man</b> who had taken a vow and came before him for dissolution? He informed him that it is written: <b>“There is one who speaks like the piercing of a sword, but the tongue of the wise is health”</b> (Proverbs 12:18), which is interpreted to mean: <b>Anyone who verbally expresses</b> the language of a vow, it is <b>appropriate to pierce him with a sword, but</b> he has another option: <b>“The tongue of the wise is health,”</b> since the Sages can release him from his vow. Quoting this verse with its interpretation is also not an acceptable method of broaching dissolution.

### Part 5
<b>We</b> also <b>do not broach</b> dissolution <b>using this other</b> method, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan says: One who vows</b> is considered <b>as if he built</b> a personal <b>altar</b> outside the Temple, which is prohibited, <b>and one who fulfills</b> this vow is considered <b>as if he sacrifices an offering on it. With the first clause, we may broach</b> dissolution by informing the one who vowed that vowing is akin to building an altar outside the Temple, but with regard to <b>the latter clause</b> there is a dispute among the Sages. <b>Abaye said: We do broach</b> dissolution by telling someone that fulfilling a vow is like sacrificing an offering on a forbidden altar, while <b>Rava said: We do not broach</b> dissolution with it.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Kahana taught this <i>halakha</i> in this wording,</b> i.e., the wording that was just cited. However, <b>Rav Tavyumei taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> in <b>this way:</b> With regard to what is written <b>in the last clause,</b> all agree that <b>we do not broach</b> dissolution in this way. With regard to what is written <b>in the first clause,</b> there is a dispute among the Sages. <b>Abaye said: We do broach</b> dissolution in this manner, while <b>Rava said: We do not broach dissolution</b> in this manner either. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that <b>we do not broach</b> dissolution using <b>either</b> the language <b>in the first clause or</b> the language <b>in the latter clause.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>we also do not broach</b> dissolution <b>with this</b> statement <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel said:</b> With regard to one who vows, <b>although he fulfills it, he is called wicked. Rabbi Abbahu said: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? It is <b>“But if you refrain [<i>teḥdal</i>] from vowing there will be no sin in you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:23), <b>and he derives</b> the word <b><i>ḥadala</i></b> here from the word <b><i>ḥadala</i></b> elsewhere. <b>It is written here: “But if you refrain [<i>teḥdal</i>] from vowing,” and it is written there: “There the wicked cease [<i>ḥadlu</i>] from troubling”</b> (Job 3:17). The parallel language demonstrates that vowing is an act of the wicked.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Yosef said: We, too, learn</b> in the mishna (9a): If one says he vows <b>like the vows of the virtuous, he has not said anything.</b> If he says: <b>Like the vows of the wicked, he has vowed with regard to</b> becoming <b>a nazirite, or with regard to</b> obligating himself in <b>an offering, or with regard to</b> taking <b>an oath.</b> From here it is also apparent that vowing is an act of the wicked.

### Part 9
§ Apropos the verse “There the wicked cease from troubling,” the Gemara cites a related statement: <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: Anyone who gets angry, all kinds of Gehenna rule over him,</b> because anger causes him to transgress all kinds of severe sins, <b>as it is stated: “Therefore remove vexation from your heart and put away evil from your flesh”</b> (Ecclesiastes 11:10), <b>and the evil</b> mentioned <b>is nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated: “The Lord has made everything for His own purpose and even the wicked for the day of evil”</b> (Proverbs 16:4), which is interpreted to mean that ultimately the day of the evildoer in Gehenna will arrive.

### Part 10
<b>And not only that, but</b> also <b>hemorrhoids will control him, as it is stated: “But the Lord shall give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and languishing of soul”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:65). <b>Which</b> is the <b>matter</b> of sickness <b>that causes failing of the eyes</b> in pain <b>and causes languishing of the soul? You must say this</b> is referring to <b>hemorrhoids.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara relates: <b>Ulla, on his ascent to Eretz Yisrael, had two residents of Ḥozai join him.</b> Because of a brawl between them, <b>one arose</b> and <b>slaughtered the other.</b> The assailant <b>said to Ulla: Did I act properly? He said to him: Yes, and open the place of the slaughter,</b> i.e., cut it more so that he will die faster. <b>When</b> Ulla <b>came before Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> Ulla <b>said to him: Perhaps, Heaven forbid, I strengthened the hands of sinners</b> by commending him, although I did so merely because I was afraid that he would kill me. <b>He said to him: You saved yourself</b> by doing so, as it is permitted for one to say words like this in order to save his own life.

### Part 12
With regard to the narrative itself, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan wondered: Now, it is written</b> in the passage of curses: <b>“But the Lord shall give you there a trembling heart”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:65) and this <b>is written with regard to Babylonia,</b> because in the exile an individual possesses a trembling and angry heart. How is it possible that in Eretz Yisrael a person can get so angry as to murder another? Ulla <b>said to him: At that moment</b> when the incident occurred
