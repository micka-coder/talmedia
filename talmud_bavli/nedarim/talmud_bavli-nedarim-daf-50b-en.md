<b>And</b> Rabbi Akiva also grew wealthy <b>from the wife of Turnus Rufus,</b> who converted and gave him her money, <b>and from Ketia bar Shalom,</b> a Roman minister who bequeathed his fortune to him.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara relates a similar incident: <b>Rav Gamda gave four dinars to sailors to bring</b> him <b>something</b> from overseas in exchange <b>for them.</b> However, they <b>did not find</b> anything of worth, so <b>they</b> bought him <b>a monkey with</b> the coins and <b>brought it to him.</b> The monkey <b>escaped</b> and <b>entered a hole.</b> When <b>they dug after it</b> to retrieve it, <b>they found it crouching over pearls,</b> and <b>they brought all of</b> the pearls <b>to</b> Rav Gamda.

### Part 3
<b>The daughter of the emperor said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya:</b> You are the epitome of <b>magnificent Torah,</b> but it is stored <b>in an ugly vessel,</b> as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya was an unattractive man. <b>He said to her: You may learn</b> the answer to your statement <b>from your father’s house. In what</b> container <b>do</b> you <b>place wine? She said to him: In earthenware vessels. He said to her:</b> Is it conceivable that <b>everyone</b> stores their wine <b>in earthenware</b> vessels, <b>and you</b> also store it <b>in earthenware vessels?</b> Is there no distinction between the emperor and ordinary people? <b>You</b> should <b>place</b> your wine <b>in vessels of silver and gold.</b>

### Part 4
<b>She went and placed the wine in vessels of silver and gold, and it spoiled.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to her: The same is</b> also true of <b>the Torah.</b> It spoils if it is contained in a handsome person. She asked him: <b>But are there not</b> people who are both <b>good</b> looking <b>and learned</b> in Torah? <b>He said to her: If they were ugly they would be</b> even <b>more learned.</b>

### Part 5
<b>A certain woman came before Rav Yehuda of</b> the city of <b>Neharde’a for judgment, and she was found guilty in the judgment</b> of her case. <b>She said to him: Would Shmuel your teacher have judged</b> me <b>in this</b> manner? <b>He said to her: Did you know him? She said to him: Yes.</b> He was <b>short and potbellied.</b> He was <b>dark and his teeth were large. He said to her: Did you come</b> here <b>to disparage him</b> by describing him in this manner? <b>Let that woman be in</b> a state of <b>excommunication.</b> After he excommunicated her, her belly <b>split open and she died,</b> as a punishment for having disparaged a Torah scholar.

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches that if one said: Cooked food is <i>konam</i> for me, and for that reason I will not taste it, he is prohibited from tasting a loose cooked food but is permitted to taste a thick one, <b>and</b> he is likewise <b>permitted to</b> eat <b>a <i>turemita</i> egg.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is a <b><i>turemita</i> egg? Shmuel said: A slave who</b> knows how to <b>prepare it is worth a thousand dinars. And</b> this is how one prepares it: <b>He insets it into hot water a thousand times and in cold water a thousand times, until it shrinks</b> enough <b>so that it can be swallowed</b> whole. <b>And if there is a lesion</b> in one’s intestines, part of the lesion <b>adheres to</b> the egg, <b>and when</b> the egg <b>emerges the doctor knows what medicine</b> the patient <b>requires and with what</b> he <b>can be healed.</b> It is therefore an important dish for medicinal purposes.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates: <b>Shmuel would examine himself with a stalk</b> that he would swallow for this purpose. This would weaken his body and cause him to look faint <b>to such an extent that the members of his household would tear their hairs out for him</b> in grief, as they would think he was dying.

### Part 8
Besides vows, there are other areas of <i>halakha</i> where there is a distinction between different varieties of the same food. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 2:8): A hired worker who <b>was working with <i>keloppasin</i>,</b> a type of fig, <b>may not partake of <i>benot sheva</i>,</b> a different species of fig, during his work. A worker may partake only of the fruit that he is handling at the time (see Deuteronomy 23:25–26). Similarly, if he was working <b>with <i>benot sheva</i> he may not partake of <i>keloppasin</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are <i>keloppasin</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>A type of fig from which compote [<i>lifdei</i>] is made.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who gave a slave to his friend so that</b> the friend would <b>teach him</b> how to prepare <b>a thousand varieties of compote</b> from figs. However, <b>he taught him</b> only <b>eight hundred. He</b> therefore <b>brought</b> his friend <b>for judgment before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: Our forefathers said: We have forgotten prosperity</b> (see Lamentations 3:17). They forgot the opulence they enjoyed in better times, but they at least experienced it. By contrast, <b>we have not even seen</b> it <b>with our eyes.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi had not imagined that so many types of compote could be prepared from figs.

### Part 10
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>made a wedding for Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. Someone <b>wrote on the canopy: 24,000 myriad dinars were expended on this canopy, and</b> nevertheless Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>did not invite bar Kappara</b> to the wedding. The insulted bar Kappara <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>If to those who transgress</b> God’s <b>will,</b> i.e., you who act improperly, their reward is <b>such,</b> as Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was very wealthy, <b>all the more so those who perform His will</b> are to be rewarded. Upon hearing his reaction, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>invited him.</b> Bar Kappara then <b>said:</b> If <b>to those who perform His will</b> their reward is <b>such in this world, all the more so</b> will they be rewarded <b>in the World-to-Come.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara relates additional incidents that occurred between the two scholars. <b>On a day when Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>would laugh, calamity would befall the world,</b> as Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s sufferings would atone for the sins of the Jewish people. <b>He</b> therefore <b>said to bar Kappara: Do not cause me to laugh, and I will give you forty <i>se’a</i> of wheat</b> in return. Bar Kappara <b>said to him:</b> The <b>Master will see</b>
