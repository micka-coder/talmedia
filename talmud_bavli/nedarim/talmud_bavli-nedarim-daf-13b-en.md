### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> case, where the vow does not take effect, is <b>where one said: This offering [<i>ha korban</i>],</b> and <b>that</b> case, where the vow does take effect, is <b>where one said: The offering [<i>hakorban</i>]. What is the reason</b> that the vow does not take effect when he says this offering [<i>ha korban</i>]? It is because <b>he is saying</b> that he is taking a vow by <b>the life of</b> this <b>offering,</b> which is not a valid way to express a vow.

### Part 2
The mishna <b>teaches</b> that if one says: That which <b>I will not eat of yours is <i>lakorban</i>,</b> which indicates <i>la korban</i>, it is not an offering, <b>Rabbi Meir prohibits</b> him from eating food belonging to the other individual. This is because his statement indicates that what he does eat shall be considered an offering. The Gemara asks: <b>Isnâ€™t</b> it true that <b>Rabbi Meir does not hold that from a negative</b> statement <b>you</b> can <b>infer a positive</b> statement? The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Abba said: It is as though he said: It shall be for an offering [<i>lekorban</i>],</b> and <b>therefore I will not eat</b> that which is <b>yours.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who says to another:</b> It is <b><i>konam</i></b> for me for <b>my mouth</b> to <b>speak with you,</b> or: It is <i>konam</i> for me for <b>my hand</b> to <b>work with you,</b> or: It is <i>konam</i> for me for <b>my foot</b> to <b>walk with you, it is prohibited</b> for him to speak with, work with, or walk with the other individual.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: There is a <b>stricture</b> that applies <b>to oaths beyond</b> the strictures that apply <b>to vows, and</b> there is a stricture that applies <b>to vows beyond</b> the strictures that apply <b>to oaths. The stricture</b> that applies <b>to vows is that vows take effect with regard to a mitzva as</b> they do <b>with regard to optional</b> activities, <b>which is not the case with regard to oaths,</b> as one cannot take an oath to neglect a mitzva. <b>And the stricture</b> that applies <b>to oaths is that oaths take effect upon a matter that has substance and a matter that does not have substance, which is not the case with regard to vows,</b> which take effect only upon a matter that has substance. This contradicts the mishna, which states that a vow can apply to speech or actions, which are not physical items that have concrete substance.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to one who says: My mouth shall be forbidden</b> with regard <b>to my speech,</b> or: <b>My hands</b> shall be forbidden with regard <b>to their work,</b> or: <b>My feet</b> should be forbidden with regard <b>to their walking.</b> In these cases the vow applies to a limb, which is a concrete item, and therefore it takes effect. The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise</b> according to this interpretation, <b>as it teaches:</b> For <b>my mouth</b> to <b>speak with you, and it does not teach: That which I speak with you.</b> This indicates that he imposed the vow upon his mouth and not upon the act of speaking.
