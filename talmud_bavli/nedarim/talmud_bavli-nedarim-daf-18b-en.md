### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Unspecified vows</b> are treated <b>stringently, but their specification,</b> if specification is necessary, is treated <b>leniently. How so?</b> If one <b>said: This</b> item is prohibited <b>to me like salted meat,</b> or: This item is prohibited to me <b>like</b> the <b>wine</b> used for <b>libations, if he vowed in reference to</b> meat or libations <b>of a peace-offering,</b> i.e., if he claimed that his intention was that the item will be forbidden to him like the salted meat of an offering, or like wine that is used for libations on the altar, it is <b>forbidden,</b> as he associated the item of the vow with an item forbidden by means of a vow, i.e., the offering.

### Part 2
<b>If</b> he claims that <b>he vowed in reference to</b> meat or libations <b>of idol worship,</b> i.e., that the item will be like the salted meat of an offering for an idol, or like wine that is used for libations as idol worship, it is <b>permitted,</b> as the item of the vow was associated with an item forbidden by the Torah. By enabling the one who took the vow to later clarify his intent, the vow is treated leniently. <b>And if</b> the vow was <b>without specification,</b> i.e., the one who took the vow did not specify whether his intention was to associate the item with an offering for Heaven or to associate the item with idol worship, it is <b>forbidden.</b>

### Part 3
Similarly, if one said: <b>This</b> item is <b>hereby</b> forbidden <b>to me</b> like an item dedicated to the Temple, <b>if</b> his intention was that it would be <b>like a dedication to Heaven,</b> which is a form of consecration, <b>it is forbidden. And if</b> his intention was that it would be <b>like a dedication to priests,</b> whereby one pledges his asset as a gift to priests, <b>it is permitted,</b> as this type of gift is not forbidden at all. <b>And if</b> he said it <b>without specification,</b> it is <b>forbidden.</b>

### Part 4
Likewise, if he said: <b>This</b> item <b>is hereby</b> forbidden <b>to me like tithes, if he took a vow</b> with the intention that it would be <b>like the animal tithe,</b> it is <b>forbidden,</b> as the item of the vow was associated with an item forbidden by a vow. <b>And if</b> his intention was that it will be like the tithe <b>of the granary,</b> i.e., grain that is given to the Levites and has no sanctity, it is <b>permitted. And if</b> he said it <b>without specification,</b> it is <b>forbidden.</b>

### Part 5
Similarly, if he said: <b>This</b> item <b>is hereby</b> forbidden <b>to me like <i>teruma</i>, if he took a vow</b> with the intention that it would be <b>like the collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber [<i>terumat halishka</i>],</b> which is a tax for the communal offerings, it is <b>forbidden,</b> his vow was associated with an item forbidden by a vow. <b>And if</b> his intention was that it would be like <i>teruma</i> <b>of the granary</b> that is given to the priests, it is <b>permitted,</b> as <i>teruma</i> is not an item forbidden by a vow. <b>And if</b> the vow was taken <b>without specification,</b> it is <b>forbidden.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Unspecified <i>teruma</i> in Judea is forbidden.</b> However, <b>in the Galilee it is permitted, as the people of the Galilee are unfamiliar with the collection of the chamber.</b> When they say <i>teruma</i> they are referring to the <i>teruma</i> allotted to the priests, which is familiar to them. Conversely, <b>unspecified dedications in Judea are permitted,</b> but <b>in the Galilee they are forbidden, as the people of the Galilee are unfamiliar with dedications</b> allotted <b>to the priests,</b> so when they say dedication they are referring to dedication to Heaven.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara raises a problem with the principle stated in the mishna that unspecified vows are treated stringently. <b>But didnâ€™t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Taharot</i> 4:12): <b>Uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>naziriteship</b> is treated <b>leniently?</b> And naziriteship is a type of vow.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. That</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> and <b>this</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with him. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who consecrates his undomesticated animal and his domesticated animal has consecrated the <i>koy</i></b> as well, although it is uncertain whether it is an undomesticated or a domesticated animal. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: He has not consecrated the <i>koy</i>.</b>

### Part 9
<b>The</b> Rabbis <b>who said</b> that one <b>puts his possessions into</b> a state of <b>uncertainty,</b> and therefore a <i>koy</i> is included in the aforementioned vow, hold that one <b>enters himself into</b> a state of uncertainty <b>as well.</b> Therefore, uncertainty with regard to naziriteship is treated stringently. <b>And</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>who said</b> that one <b>does not put his possessions into</b> a state of <b>uncertainty,</b> and therefore the phrase: Undomesticated and domesticated animals, refers only to definitely undomesticated and definitely domesticated animals,
