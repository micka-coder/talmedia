### Part 1
<b>He lifted the mat [<i>tzifeta</i>]</b> upon which he was sitting <b>and said to the messenger: See what there is</b> here. The place was miraculously filled with gold dinars. This demonstrated that Rabbi Yehuda could have had plenty of money if he had so desired. He explained: <b>However, it is not amenable to me to derive benefit in this world.</b>

### Part 2
§ In connection to the above incident concerning the poverty of scholars and their potential to become wealthy through remarkable circumstances, the Gemara relates an incident: <b>Rabbi Akiva became betrothed to the daughter of bar Kalba Savua.</b> When <b>bar Kalba Savua heard</b> about their betrothal, he took a vow <b>prohibiting her from</b> eating <b>all of his property.</b> Despite this, <b>she went</b> ahead <b>and married</b> Rabbi Akiva.

### Part 3
<b>In the winter they would sleep in a storehouse of straw,</b> and Rabbi Akiva <b>would gather</b> strands of <b>straw from her hair. He said to her: If I had</b> the means <b>I would place on your</b> head <b>a Jerusalem of Gold,</b> a type of crown. <b>Elijah</b> the prophet <b>came</b> and <b>appeared to them as</b> a regular <b>person and</b> started <b>calling</b> and knocking <b>on the door. He said to them: Give me a bit of straw, as my wife gave birth and I do not have anything on which to lay her. Rabbi Akiva said to his wife: See</b> this <b>man, who does not even have straw.</b> We should be happy with our lot, as we at least have straw to sleep on.

### Part 4
<b>She said to him: Go</b> and <b>be a student</b> of Torah. <b>He went</b> and studied Torah for <b>twelve years before Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua. At the completion of</b> the <b>twelve years, he was coming home</b> when <b>he heard from behind his house that one wicked person was saying to his wife: Your father behaved well toward you.</b> He was right to disinherit you. <b>One</b> reason is <b>that</b> your husband <b>is not similar to you,</b> i.e., he is not suitable for you. <b>And furthermore, he has left you in widowhood in his lifetime all these years. She said to him: If he listens to me, he should be</b> there for <b>another twelve years.</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said: Since she has given me permission</b> through this statement, <b>I will go back</b> and study more. <b>He turned back</b> and <b>went</b> to the study hall, and he <b>was</b> there for <b>another twelve years.</b>

### Part 5
Eventually <b>he came</b> back accompanied <b>by 24,000 pairs of students. Everyone went out to</b> greet <b>him,</b> as he was by then a renowned teacher, <b>and she too arose to go out to</b> greet <b>him. That wicked person said to her: And to where are you</b> going? As she was excessively poor, she was not dressed in a grand manner, as fit for the wife of one so esteemed. <b>She said to him: “A righteous man regards the life of his beast”</b> (Proverbs 12:10); he knows that I am in this state as a result of my dedication to him. <b>She came to present herself before</b> Rabbi Akiva, but <b>the Sages</b> tried to <b>fend her off,</b> as they were unaware of her identity. <b>He said to them: Leave her.</b> Both <b>my</b> Torah knowledge <b>and yours are hers.</b> When <b>bar Kalba Savua heard</b> that the famous man was his son-in-law, <b>he came</b> before halakhic authorities <b>and requested the dissolution of his vow, and it was dissolved.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara adds: <b>Rabbi Akiva became wealthy from six things.</b> First, <b>from</b> the money he received from <b>Kalba Savua</b> after his vow was dissolved. Second, he gained money <b>from the ram of a ship [<i>eila disfineta</i>], as</b> craftsmen would <b>fashion</b> a sculpture of <b>a type of sheep for every ship,</b> which would be placed on its bow, and which would be used to conceal money. On <b>one occasion,</b> the sailors <b>forgot</b> this ram <b>on the seashore,</b> and Rabbi Akiva <b>came</b> and <b>found it</b> with the money stored inside.

### Part 7
<b>And</b> third, he became wealthy <b>from a log [<i>gavza</i>]</b> of wood, <b>as</b> on <b>one occasion he gave four dinars to sailors</b> and <b>said to them: Bring me something</b> worthwhile. <b>And they found only a log</b> of wood <b>on the seashore. They brought it to him</b> and <b>said to him: May our master wait with this</b> until we bring a more worthy item. <b>He found that</b> the log <b>was full of dinars, as</b> on <b>one occasion a ship sunk and all the merchandise,</b> i.e., the money, owned by the people on the ship <b>was placed in that log, and it was found on that occasion</b> by the sailors.

### Part 8
Rabbi Akiva became wealthy <b>from</b> a convoy of <b>Ishmaelites [<i>Serukita</i>]. And</b> he became wealthy <b>from</b> a certain <b>lady.</b> Rabbi Akiva borrowed money from a lady and said that God would be his guarantor. When it came time to return the loan, the king’s daughter became insane and threw a purse of jewelry into the sea, which was found by that lady. She told Rabbi Akiva that his guarantor had paid his debt and she allowed him to keep the loan.
