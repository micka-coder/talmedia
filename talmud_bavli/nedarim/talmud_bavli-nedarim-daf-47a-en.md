### Part 1
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to one <b>who says to another:</b> Entering your house is <i>konam</i> for me, and the owner dies or sells the house, the prohibition is lifted. But if he said: Entering this house is <i>konam</i> for me, he remains prohibited from entering the house even after the owner dies or sells the house. <b>Avimi raises a dilemma:</b> If the owner of a house said: <b>Entering this house is <i>konam</i> for you,</b> and then <b>he died or sold it to another, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do we say that <b>a person</b> can <b>render an item in his possession forbidden</b> even <b>for</b> a time <b>after it will leave his possession, or not?</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 108b–109a): If <b>one says to his son: Benefiting from me is <i>konam</i> for you, and dies,</b> the son still <b>inherits</b> from <b>him.</b> If, however, the father explicitly states that benefit is forbidden both <b>in his lifetime and after his death, and dies,</b> the son <b>does not inherit</b> from <b>him.</b> Rava suggests: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that <b>a person</b> can <b>render an item in his possession forbidden</b> even <b>for</b> a time <b>after it will leave his possession.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that this is so.

### Part 3
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (57a): If one says: <b>This produce is <i>konam</i> upon me,</b> or: <b>It is <i>konam</i> upon my mouth,</b> or: <b>It is <i>konam</i> for my mouth,</b> he is <b>prohibited</b> from eating even <b>its replacements,</b> should they be traded or exchanged, <b>and</b> anything that <b>grows from it</b> if it is replanted.

### Part 4
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>said: This produce is <i>konam</i> for so-and-so, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to their replacements? Do we say: With regard to himself, since a person can render another’s produce forbidden for himself,</b> though it is not presently in his possession, so too, <b>a person can render an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world forbidden to himself?</b> Is this why the replacement produce and anything that grows from it is forbidden to him, even if it did not yet exist when he took the vow? If so, <b>with regard to another, since a person cannot render another’s produce forbidden to another,</b> i.e., to that owner himself, similarly <b>one cannot render an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world forbidden to another.</b> The produce’s replacements would therefore be permitted to him.
