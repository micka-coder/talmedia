### Part 1
The Gemara raises a difficulty with Rabbi Ami’s explanation of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: Just as</b> with regard to <b>a woman he acquired for himself</b> through betrothal, <b>he nullifies her vows,</b> so too with regard to <b>a woman acquired for him from Heaven,</b> i.e., the <i>yevama</i>, <b>isn’t it logical that he should</b> be able to <b>nullify her vows? Now if</b> Rabbi Ami’s interpretation is correct, and the mishna is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> a <i>yavam</i> <b>performed levirate betrothal,</b> then <b>it</b> is actually a case where <b>he acquired</b> a woman <b>for himself</b> by performing levirate betrothal. The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, it is a case <b>where he acquired for himself</b> a woman who was imposed upon him <b>by means of Heaven.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara raises another difficulty with Rabbi Ami’s interpretation, in that if it is correct, <b>you</b> can <b>resolve</b> the dilemma <b>that Rabba raised:</b> Does <b>levirate betrothal, according to Beit Shammai,</b> merely <b>effect betrothal, or does it effect</b> full-fledged <b>marriage?</b> According to Rabbi Eliezer, <b>you</b> can <b>resolve</b> the dilemma by proving <b>that it effects marriage.</b> The proof is as follows: <b>Because if</b> levirate betrothal <b>effects</b> only <b>betrothal,</b> why does the mishna mention only the <i>yavam</i> with regard to nullification of vows? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 66b) that with regard to <b>a betrothed young woman, her father and her husband</b> together <b>nullify her vows?</b> If levirate betrothal renders her betrothed to the <i>yavam</i>, the father should also be mentioned as a partner in the nullification.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This does not resolve the dilemma, as <b>what</b> could be the meaning of <b>nullify</b> in the mishna? It could mean that <b>he nullifies</b> vows <b>in partnership</b> with the father.

### Part 4
The Gemara comments: <b>It is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>that</b> Rabbi Eliezer is addressing a case where levirate betrothal has been performed, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ami:</b> With regard to <b>a widow awaiting her <i>yavam</i>, whether</b> she is waiting for <b>one <i>yavam</i>,</b> if her late husband had only one brother, or for <b>two</b> or more <b><i>yevamin</i>, Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The <i>yavam</i> <b>can nullify</b> her vows, <b>and Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> He can nullify her vows only in a case where she is waiting <b>for one</b> <i>yavam</i>, <b>but not</b> if she is waiting <b>for two. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Nullification is not possible at all, <b>not</b> if she is waiting <b>for one, and not</b> if she is waiting <b>for two</b> or more.

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Eliezer said</b> to his disputants: <b>And just as if</b> one accepts that a man cannot nullify the vows of <b>a woman in whom he has no share until she enters into his jurisdiction</b> through betrothal, yet <b>once she enters into his jurisdiction, she is fully</b> under <b>his</b> authority for the nullification of her vows, so too with regard to <b>a woman</b> in whom <b>he has a share before she enters his jurisdiction,</b> i.e., his <i>yevama</i>, <b>once she enters his jurisdiction, is it not logical that she be fully</b> under <b>his</b> authority for the nullification of her vows?

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: No,</b> your <i>a fortiori</i> inference is refutable. <b>If you spoke of</b> a man having authority over the vows of <b>a woman he acquired for himself</b> through betrothal, <b>that</b> would be different: <b>Just as he has no share in her</b> before betrothal, <b>so</b> too <b>others have no share in her. Will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to a woman</b> who is <b>acquired for him from Heaven,</b> i.e., his <i>yevama</i>, <b>for whom, just as he has a share in her, so do others,</b> i.e., his brothers, also <b>have a share in her,</b> as they also are <i>yevamin</i>?

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: Akiva, your statement</b> fits a situation <b>with two <i>yevamin</i>,</b> but <b>what do you answer for</b> the case of <b>one <i>yavam</i>?</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>replied to him: Did we distinguish between one <i>yavam</i> and two <i>yevamin</i>,</b> regardless of <b>whether he performed levirate betrothal or whether he did not perform levirate betrothal? And</b> just <b>as</b> in <b>other matters</b> there is no such distinction, <b>so</b> too with regard to <b>vows.</b>

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> adds a comment: <b>Ben Azzai stated</b> his response to hearing this <b>discussion in this language: Woe [<i>ḥaval</i>] to you, ben Azzai, that you did not serve Rabbi Akiva</b> properly.

### Part 9
Since this <i>baraita</i> was cited in support of Rabbi Ami’s inter-pretation, the Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way
