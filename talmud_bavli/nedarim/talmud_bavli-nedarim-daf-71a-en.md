### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>she took a vow as a betrothed woman</b> and then <b>was divorced on the same day,</b> and <b>she was</b> again <b>betrothed on the same day</b> to another man, or <b>even to one hundred</b> men, one after the other, on a single day, <b>her father and her last husband nullify her vows. This is the principle:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> young woman <b>who has not left</b> her father’s jurisdiction and entered <b>into her own jurisdiction for</b> at least <b>one moment,</b> through full marriage or reaching majority, <b>her father and her final husband nullify her vows.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> her <b>final betrothed can nullify</b> her <b>vows that were disclosed to the first betrothed? Shmuel said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And if she be to a husband and her vows are upon</b> her…and he nullifies her vow” (Numbers 30:7–9), indicating that he can nullify <b>vows that were upon her already.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Perhaps this statement applies</b> only to vows <b>that were not discerned by the first betrothed, but vows that were discerned by the first betrothed,</b> the <b>final betrothed cannot nullify.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: The phrase <b>“upon her” is a superfluous</b> part of the <b>verse.</b> One can derive from it that all her vows, including those of which an earlier betrothed had been aware, can be nullified by the final betrothed.

### Part 4
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel:</b> With regard to <b>a betrothed young woman, her father and her husband</b> together <b>nullify her vows. How so?</b> If <b>her father heard and nullified</b> the vow <b>for her, and the husband did not manage to hear</b> it <b>before he died, and she was betrothed on the same day</b> to another man, <b>or even one hundred times</b> on the same day, <b>her father and her final husband nullify her vows.</b> If <b>her husband heard and nullified</b> the vow <b>for her, and the father did not manage to hear</b> it <b>before the husband died, the father may go back and nullify</b> the <b>husband’s portion.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Natan said: This is the statement of Beit Shammai,</b> that each of them nullifies half of the betrothed young woman’s vow. <b>However, Beit Hillel say</b> that the father <b>cannot nullify</b> the vow on his own. The Gemara asks: <b>About what</b> do Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>disagree?</b>
