### Part 1
<b>except for by</b> taking of <b>an oath,</b> due to its more stringent nature. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> One may mislead them <b>even by</b> taking <b>an oath.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Beit Shammai say:</b> When negotiating with a robber, <b>one should not initiate by</b> taking <b>a vow for him</b> unless the robber does not believe his claim, in which case he may take a vow to reinforce his words. <b>And Beit Hillel say: He may even initiate</b> by taking a vow <b>to him. Beit Shammai say:</b> One may take a vow only <b>about that which</b> the robber <b>compels him to take a vow</b> but may not add to it. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> One may take a vow <b>even about that which he does not compel him to take a vow.</b>

### Part 3
The mishna explains the previous statement: <b>How</b> so? If the extortionist <b>said to him</b> that he should <b>say: Benefiting from me is <i>konam</i> for my wife</b> if the vow is not true, <b>and he said: Benefiting from me is <i>konam</i> for my wife and my children, Beit Shammai say: His wife is permitted</b> to benefit from him, since the extortionist demanded that he take that vow, <b>but his children,</b> whom he added of his own accord, <b>are prohibited</b> from benefiting from their father. <b>And Beit Hillel say: Both these and those are permitted</b> to benefit from him.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks, concerning the mishna’s statement that one may take a vow to tax collectors: <b>But didn’t Shmuel say: The law of the kingdom is the law,</b> i.e., there is a halakhic principle that Jews must obey the laws of the state in which they live? Since one must pay the tax determined by the kingdom, how did the Sages permit one to lie in order to avoid paying?

### Part 5
<b>Rav Ḥinnana said</b> that <b>Rav Kahana said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to a tax collector who has no fixed amount</b> for collection established by the kingdom, but rather collects the tax arbitrarily. Therefore, this case is not included in the law of the kingdom. A Sage <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai said:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to a tax collector who establishes himself</b> as such <b>independently</b> and was not appointed by the kingdom.

### Part 6
§ The mishna states: He may also take a vow to them <b>that</b> his produce <b>belongs to the house of the king, although it does not belong to the house of the king.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How</b> does he <b>take a vow</b> in this way? <b>Rav Amram said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> This is a case <b>where he said: The produce of the world should be forbidden to me if</b> this produce <b>does not belong to the house of the king.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Since he said</b> that the produce of the world <b>shall be forbidden</b> to him, shouldn’t <b>all the produce of the world is forbidden to him,</b> as this produce did not belong to the house of the king? The Gemara answers: This is a case <b>where he says:</b> They shall be forbidden to me only <b>today.</b> The Gemara wonders: <b>If he says: Today, the tax collector will not accept it</b> as a vow, since it is not difficult to avoid eating produce for one day. Therefore, he may still be suspected of lying.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: This is a case <b>where he says: Today, in his heart but verbalizes</b> the vow in <b>an unspecified</b> manner. <b>And although we hold</b> that unspoken <b>matters that</b> remain <b>in the heart are not</b> significant <b>matters</b> and are not taken into consideration, <b>with regard to circumstances beyond</b> one’s <b>control it is different,</b> and he is permitted to rely on the mental stipulation that he added in order to limit the duration of the prohibition effected by the vow.

### Part 9
§ The mishna states: <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that they may take a vow in such a case <b>using every</b> means of vowing except for an oath, while Beit Hillel say they may take a vow even using an oath. <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> One may vow only <b>about that which</b> the extortionist <b>compels him to take a vow</b> but may not add to it. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> One may take a vow <b>even about that which he does not compel him to take a vow. How</b> so? If the extortionist <b>said to him</b> that he should <b>say: Benefiting from me is <i>konam</i> for my wife</b> if the vow is not true, <b>and he said: Benefiting from me is <i>konam</i> for my wife and my children, Beit Shammai say: His wife is permitted</b> to benefit from him, since the extortionist demanded that he take that vow, <b>but his children,</b> whom he added of his own accord, <b>are prohibited</b> from benefiting from their father. <b>And Beit Hillel say: Both these and those are permitted</b> to benefit from him.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Huna said</b> that a Sage <b>taught: Beit Shammai say</b> that <b>one may not initiate by</b> taking <b>an oath to him</b> unless the extortionist does not believe his claim, <b>and Beit Hillel say: He may even initiate by</b> taking <b>an oath to him.</b> The Gemara asks: A precise analysis of the wording indicates that <b>according to Beit Shammai it is</b> only <b>by</b> taking <b>an oath to him that one may not initiate, but one may initiate by</b> taking <b>a vow to him.</b> Rav Huna asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>Beit Shammai say: He may not initiate by</b> taking <b>a vow to him?</b>

### Part 11
Rav Huna asks another question: <b>And furthermore,</b> a precise analysis of the wording indicates that <b>he may not initiate by</b> taking <b>an oath to him, but he may certainly vow with an oath</b> if the tax collector insists on it; <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>Beit Shammai say: They may take a vow</b> in such a case <b>using every</b> means of vowing in order to mislead them <b>except for by taking an oath,</b> which indicates that one may not take an oath even if he does not initiate with one?

### Part 12
The Gemara resolves the contradiction: <b>The mishna taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>pertains to a vow to convey to you the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> who say that one may not initiate even with a vow. However, <b>the <i>baraita</i> taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>pertains to an oath to convey to you the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel,</b> who maintain that initiating even with an oath is permitted. It is apparent that according to Beit Shammai one may not initiate with a vow and may not take an oath at all. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> cannot be used to infer Beit Shammai’s opinion concerning oaths.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> the following to resolve the contradiction: <b>This is what</b> it <b>is teaching:</b> The <i>baraita</i> does not refer to a vow taken in the case of robbers or tax collectors. Rather, the dispute focuses on an entirely different topic: <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that <b>there is no</b> allowance for <b>a request</b> for dissolution <b>of an oath,</b> and the statement: He may not initiate, relates to a halakhic authority who seeks an opening to dissolve an oath. <b>And Beit Hillel say there is</b> an allowance for <b>a request</b> for dissolution <b>of an oath.</b>

### Part 14
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one sees his property in danger of being destroyed, and takes a vow stating, for example: <b>These saplings are</b> like <b>an offering if they are not cut</b> down, or: <b>This garment is</b> like <b>an offering if it is not burned,</b> these items are consecrated if the saplings remain standing or if the garment is not burned. In addition, <b>they are subject to</b> the possibility of <b>redemption</b> just as other items consecrated for maintenance of the Temple may be redeemed. But if one said: <b>These saplings are</b> like <b>an offering until they are cut</b> down, or: <b>This garment is</b> like <b>an offering until it is burned,</b>
