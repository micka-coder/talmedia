### Part 1
<b>And,</b> so too, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one vows <b>until the New Moon of Adar,</b> the vow remains in effect <b>until the New Moon of the first Adar,</b> and <b>if it was a leap year,</b> it remains in effect <b>until the New Moon of the second Adar.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: Does the latter clause prove <b>by inference that</b> in <b>the first clause, we are not dealing with a leap</b> year? In a regular year there is only one month of Adar, so it is impossible to speak of a first or second Adar. Rather, <b>learn from it</b> that <b>this</b> latter clause is referring to a case <b>where</b> it <b>is obvious to him that the year was extended,</b> and therefore when he refers to the month of Adar he means the second Adar, whereas <b>that</b> first clause is referring to a case <b>where</b> he <b>did not know</b> that it was a leap year, in which case he means the first Adar.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In the case of one who says: <b>Wine is <i>konam</i></b> for me, and for <b>that</b> reason <b>I will not taste</b> it <b>until it will be Passover,</b> it is understood that <b>this</b> individual <b>intended</b> for his vow to apply <b>only until the night of Passover,</b> i.e., <b>until the time when it is customary for people to drink wine</b> in order to fulfill the mitzva of drinking the four cups, but he did not intend to prevent himself from being able to fulfill this mitzva.

### Part 4
Similarly, if he said: <b>Meat is <i>konam</i></b> for me, and for <b>that</b> reason <b>I will not taste</b> it <b>until it will be the fast</b> of Yom Kippur, <b>he is prohibited</b> from eating meat <b>only until the eve of [<i>leilei</i>] the fast.</b> This is <b>because</b> it is understood that <b>this</b> individual <b>intended</b> for his vow to apply <b>only until the time when it is customary for people to eat meat</b> in the festive meal before the fast, and he did not intend to prevent himself from being able to participate in that meal. <b>Rabbi Yosei, his son, says:</b> One who vows: <b>Garlic is <i>konam</i></b> for me, and for <b>that</b> reason <b>I</b> will not <b>taste</b> it <b>until it will be Shabbat, it is prohibited</b> for him to eat garlic <b>only until the eve of Shabbat, as</b> it is understood that <b>this</b> individual <b>intended</b> for his vow to apply <b>only until the time when it is customary for people to eat garlic.</b>

### Part 5
In the case of <b>one who says to another: Benefiting from you is <i>konam</i> for me,</b> i.e., I am prohibited from deriving benefit from you, <b>if you do not come and take for your son one <i>kor</i> of wheat and two barrels of wine</b> as a gift, <b>this</b> other individual <b>can dissolve his vow without</b> the <b>consent</b> of <b>a halakhic authority.</b> This is because <b>he</b> can <b>say to him:</b> Did <b>you say</b> your vow for <b>any</b> reason <b>other than due to my honor,</b> in order to convince me to accept a gift for my son? <b>This is my honor,</b> that I refrain from accepting the gift, and consequently the vow is annulled.

### Part 6
<b>And, so too,</b> in the case of <b>one who says to another: Benefiting from me is <i>konam</i> for you,</b> i.e., you are prohibited from deriving benefit from me, <b>if you do not come and give my son one <i>kor</i> of wheat and two barrels of wine, Rabbi Meir says:</b> It is <b>prohibited</b> for the other individual to benefit from the speaker <b>until he gives</b> the gifts to his son. However, <b>the Rabbis say: Even this</b> individual who took the vow <b>can dissolve his</b> own <b>vow without</b> the <b>consent of a halakhic authority.</b> This is because <b>he</b> can <b>say to him: I hereby</b> consider it <b>as though I have received</b> the gift.

### Part 7
If an individual <b>was urging</b> another <b>to marry the daughter of his sister, and</b> in order to deflect the pressure, the other man <b>said: Benefiting from me is <i>konam</i> for her forever,</b> i.e., she is prohibited from deriving any benefit from me forever, <b>and, so too,</b> if there is <b>one who divorces his wife</b> and <b>says: Benefiting from me is <i>konam</i></b> for <b>my wife forever, these</b> women <b>are permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit from him, as this</b> man <b>intended</b> to take this vow <b>only for the purpose</b> of prohibiting <b>marriage</b> between them, but not to prohibit all forms of benefit.

### Part 8
Similarly, if one <b>was urging another</b> to <b>eat with him,</b> and the latter <b>said: Entering your house</b> is <b><i>konam</i></b> for <b>me,</b> as is <b>tasting</b> even <b>a drop of cold liquid of yours,</b> the individual who took the vow is nevertheless <b>permitted to enter his house and to drink a cold</b> beverage <b>of his.</b> This is <b>because this</b> individual <b>intended</b> to take this vow <b>only for the purpose of eating and drinking</b> a meal, but not to prohibit himself from entering the house entirely or from drinking in small quantities (Commentary on <i>Nedarim</i>).
