### Part 1
<b>is it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ami?</b> The Gemara explains that support for Rabbi Ami’s opinion is found in <b>that which is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, as Rabbi Akiva mentions the following distinction: <b>Whether he performed levirate betrothal or whether he did not perform levirate betrothal.</b> This indicates that Rabbi Eliezer’s statement is referring to a <i>yevama</i> with whom he performed levirate betrothal.

### Part 2
<b>Alternatively,</b> support can be derived <b>from the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>which teaches: Once she enters his jurisdiction, she is fully</b> under <b>his</b> authority. <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a situation <b>where he did not betroth</b> her in levirate betrothal, in <b>what</b> sense is <b>she fully</b> under <b>his</b> authority? <b>Deduce from it</b> that the situation is one <b>in which he has performed levirate betrothal.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara then asks with regard to the <i>baraita</i> itself. <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>And</b> just <b>as</b> in <b>other matters</b> there is no such distinction, <b>so</b> too with regard to <b>vows, that</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>teaches</b> in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>Rava said: This is what</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>is teaching: Do you not concede that</b> one is <b>not liable to</b> be punished with <b>stoning</b> for adulterous relations with a <i>yevama</i> <b>as</b> he would be if she were <b>a betrothed young woman?</b> The status of the relationship is inferior to proper marriage, as one who engages in sexual intercourse with a <i>yevama</i> does not incur the death penalty. Accordingly, the authority of the <i>yavam</i> with regard to vows is also inferior.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ashi said: The mishna</b> (74a) <b>is also precisely</b> formulated to indicate this, as it teaches: <b>A <i>yevama</i> is not her husband’s full-fledged</b> wife <b>in the same manner that a betrothed woman</b> is <b>her husband’s full-fledged</b> wife.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who says to his wife: All vows that you will vow from now until I arrive from such and such a place are hereby ratified, has not said anything,</b> i.e., the vows are not ratified. However, if he states that all vows that she will take until then <b>are hereby nullified, Rabbi Eliezer said:</b> They are <b>nullified, while the Rabbis say:</b> They are <b>not nullified. Rabbi Eliezer said</b> in explanation: <b>If one can nullify vows that have reached the status of a prohibition,</b> i.e., that have already taken effect, <b>shall he not</b> be able to <b>nullify vows that have not reached the status of a prohibition?</b>

### Part 6
The Rabbis <b>said to him</b> in response: The verse <b>states:</b> “Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, <b>her husband may ratify it, or her husband may nullify it”</b> (Numbers 30:14). This teaches: <b>That which has reached the status of</b> eligibility for <b>ratification,</b> i.e., a vow that she has already taken, <b>has reached the status of</b> eligibility for <b>nullification.</b> However, a vow that <b>has not reached the status of</b> eligibility for <b>ratification</b> has <b>not reached the status of</b> eligibility for <b>nullification</b> either, and it cannot be nullified.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>According to Rabbi Eliezer,</b> do the vows that the husband nullifies in advance <b>take effect</b> momentarily <b>and are</b> then <b>canceled</b> immediately after? <b>Or perhaps they do not take effect at all.</b> The Gemara inquires: <b>In what</b> case is there <b>a difference</b> between these possibilities?
