### Part 1
<b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> it can be argued that <b>when Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that it is good to take a vow and fulfill it, he said it <b>with regard to a gift</b> offering, but <b>he did not say</b> it <b>with regard to vows.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t the mishna teaching</b> that according to Rabbi Yehuda, <b>better than</b> both <b>this and that is one who vows [<i>noder</i>] and pays,</b> which indicates that he says this even about vows? The Gemara answers: <b>Teach</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda with the following, emended formulation: Better than both this and that is <b>one who volunteers [<i>nodev</i>]</b> a gift offering <b>and pays</b> it.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different about one who vows,</b> i.e., one who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring an offering, <b>which is not</b> proper to do due to the concern that <b>perhaps he will encounter a stumbling block</b> and not bring <b>it</b> promptly, thereby violating the prohibition against delaying? One should <b>also not</b> designate a particular animal as <b>a gift</b> offering, due to the concern that <b>perhaps he will encounter a stumbling block with it.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he said</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person brings his lamb to</b> the Temple <b>courtyard and consecrates it</b> there, <b>and</b> immediately <b>leans on it and slaughters it.</b> Consequently, there is no concern that he will encounter a stumbling block.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: That <b>works out well</b> with regard to voluntary <b>gifts</b> in the context <b>of offerings,</b> but with regard to the <b>volun-tary</b> acceptance <b>of naziriteship, what is there to say?</b> There is still room for concern that one will not fulfill the obligations incumbent upon him as a nazirite.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: Here, too, <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The early</b> generations of <b>pious</b> men <b>would desire to bring a sin-offering</b> but did not have the opportunity to do so <b>because the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not bring about a stumbling block through them,</b> and they would not sin even unwittingly. <b>What would they do? They would rise and volunteer naziriteship to the Omnipresent in order to be liable</b> to bring a <b>sin-offering</b> of a nazirite <b>to the Omnipresent.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: They did not take a vow of naziriteship. Rather, one who</b> would <b>want to bring a burnt-offering</b> would <b>volunteer and bring</b> it; one who would want to bring <b>a peace-offering</b> would <b>volunteer and bring</b> it; and one who would want to bring <b>a thanks-offering and its four types of bread</b> would <b>volunteer and bring</b> them. <b>However, they did not volunteer naziriteship in order that they not be called sinners.</b> According to Rabbi Shimon, naziriteship involves some element of sin, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall make atonement for him, for that he sinned against the soul”</b> (Numbers 6:11).

### Part 8
§ <b>Abaye said: Shimon HaTzaddik, Rabbi Shimon, and Rabbi Elazar HaKappar are all of the same opinion, that a nazirite is a sinner.</b> The statements of <b>Shimon HaTzaddik and Rabbi Shimon</b> in this regard are <b>that which we</b> already <b>said.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the Distinguished</b> agrees, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the Distinguished says:</b> It is written with regard to the priest who sacrificed the offering of a nazirite: <b>“And he shall make atonement for him, for that he sinned against the soul.” Against which soul did</b> the nazirite <b>sin? Rather,</b> his sin is <b>that he caused himself suffering</b> by refraining <b>from wine. Are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: Just as this</b> nazirite, <b>who causes himself suffering only</b> by refraining <b>from wine, is called a sinner, one who causes himself suffering</b> by refraining <b>from everything</b> is <b>all the more so</b> to be considered a sinner. <b>From here</b> it can be derived that <b>whoever fasts</b> unnecessarily <b>is called a sinner.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara raises a question with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar HaKappar. <b>Isn’t this verse written with regard to a ritually impure nazirite?</b> Consequently, only a nazirite who becomes impure shall be considered a sinner. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Elazar HaKappar holds that the verse uses this terminology with regard to a ritually impure nazirite <b>because he repeated his sin.</b> However, becoming a nazirite is itself considered a sin.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who says to another</b> that a certain object is <b><i>konam</i>, <i>konaḥ</i>,</b> or <b><i>konas</i>, these</b> expressions <b>are substitutes</b> for the term <b>offering [<i>korban</i>],</b> and the vow takes effect. <b><i>Ḥerek</i>, <i>ḥerekh</i></b> and <b><i>ḥeref</i>; these are substitutes</b> for the term indicating a <b>dedication [<i>ḥerem</i>]</b> to the Temple treasury. <b><i>Nazik</i>, <i>naziaḥ</i>,</b> and <b><i>paziaḥ</i>; these are substitutes</b> for the term <b>naziriteship [<i>nazir</i>]. <i>Shevuta</i>, <i>shekuka</i>,</b> or one who <b>vows with</b> the term <b><i>mohi</i>, these are substitutes</b> for the term <b>oath [<i>shevua</i>].</b>

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about <b>substitutes</b> for the language of vows. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They are</b> terms from <b>a language of</b> other <b>nations</b> that mean offering, dedication, naziriteship, or oath. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> These terms employ <b>language that the Sages devised [<i>badu</i>] with which</b> one can <b>take a vow.</b> In order to explain the word <i>badu</i>, he adds: <b>And so it states</b> with regard to Jeroboam: <b>“In the month that he had devised [<i>bada</i>] in his own heart”</b> (I Kings 12:33).

### Part 13
<b>And</b> according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>the Sages established substitutes</b> for the language of vows? The Gemara answers: It is <b>so that one not</b> explicitly <b>say</b> the term <b>offering.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And let him say</b> the term <b>offering;</b> what is wrong with that? The Gemara answers: <b>Perhaps he will say: An offering to the Lord.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And let him say: An offering to the Lord.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Perhaps he will say: To the Lord, and</b> he will then change his mind and <b>not say: An offering, and he will</b> thereby <b>express the name of Heaven in vain.</b>

### Part 14
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b>
