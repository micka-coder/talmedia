### Part 1
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Shabbat</i> 157a): A father or husband <b>may nullify</b> his daughter’s or his wife’s <b>vows on Shabbat and one may request</b> from a halakhic authority <b>to</b> dissolve <b>vows that are for the purpose of Shabbat. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: May one <b>nullify vows on Shabbat</b> only <b>when</b> they are <b>for the purpose of Shabbat, or</b> may one <b>perhaps</b> nullify vows on Shabbat <b>even when they are not for the purpose</b> of Shabbat?

### Part 2
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>that Rav Zuti from the school of Rav Pappi taught: Vows may be nullified</b> on Shabbat <b>only for the purpose of Shabbat. Rav Ashi said: We did not learn that way</b> in the mishna here. The mishna teaches: If <b>she took a vow with nightfall</b> approaching, her father or husband <b>can nullify</b> the vow <b>for her</b> only <b>until nightfall. And if you say</b> that with regard to nullification of vows that <b>are for the purpose of Shabbat, yes,</b> he may nullify those vows, but nullifications <b>that are not for the purpose of Shabbat, no,</b> he may not, <b>why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> <b>specify nightfall?</b> After all, <b>even during the day he may not nullify that</b> which <b>is not for the purpose</b> of Shabbat.

### Part 3
The Gemara rejects this conclusion: Nullification on Shabbat is subject to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: Nullification of vows</b> can be performed <b>all day</b> on the day that the vow was heard. And <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, said:</b> A vow can be nullified <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> from the time it was heard.

### Part 4
<b>According to the one who says all day, yes,</b> one can nullify vows all day, but <b>not more</b> than that; <b>he may nullify</b> on Shabbat <b>even</b> when it is <b>not for the purpose of Shabbat,</b> since otherwise, he could not nullify a vow taken on Shabbat at all. <b>According to the one who says</b> that one can nullify her vows <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> that which is <b>for the purpose of Shabbat, yes,</b> he may nullify, but that which is <b>not necessary for Shabbat,</b> he <b>may not</b> nullify, as he can do so after Shabbat.

### Part 5
§ The mishna from tractate <i>Shabbat</i> teaches: <b>And one may request</b> from a halakhic authority <b>to</b> dissolve <b>vows that are for the purpose of Shabbat. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is this specifically <b>when those</b> who took the vows <b>did not have the opportunity</b> to request dissolution of the vows before Shabbat, <b>or perhaps</b> it is the case even <b>when they did have the opportunity?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> It happened <b>that the Sages attended to</b> the dissolution of the vows of <b>the son of Rav Zutra, son of Rav Zeira,</b> on Shabbat, <b>even for vows that they had the opportunity</b> to dissolve <b>while it was still day,</b> before Shabbat had begun.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Yosef thought to say:</b> With regard to <b>requesting</b> that a halakhic authority dissolve <b>vows on Shabbat, yes,</b> requesting <b>of a single expert</b> is permitted on Shabbat, but requesting <b>of three laymen</b> is <b>not</b> permitted on Shabbat, <b>because it looks like</b> a court <b>judgment,</b> which may not be performed on Shabbat.

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said to him: Since we hold</b> that vows may be dissolved <b>even</b> while the halakhic authority <b>is standing,</b> and <b>even by relatives, and even at night,</b> it <b>does not look like a judgment.</b> Since it is not regarded as an act of a court, vows may be dissolved on Shabbat even by three laymen.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one can nullify vows at night.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But this is</b> already stated in <b>the mishna:</b> If a woman <b>took a vow on Shabbat evening,</b> her father or husband can nullify the vow on Shabbat evening; why would Rav Huna need to state his <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rather, say</b> that Rav’s ruling was as follows: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one can request</b> that a halakhic authority dissolve a vow <b>at night.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Abba said to Rav Huna: Did Rav say that?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him:</b> Rav <b>was silent [<i>ishtik</i>]</b> when this ruling was stated in his presence. Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: Did you say: He was silent [<i>ishtik</i>],</b> indicating that he accepted this ruling, <b>or did you say:</b> He was <b>drinking [<i>shatei</i>],</b> and was therefore preoccupied, so that his silence did not necessarily indicate agreement?

### Part 10
In order to clarify Rav’s opinion on the issue, the Gemara cites <b>Rav Ika bar Avin</b> who <b>said: Rav attended to</b> the dissolution of a vow made by <b>Rabba,</b>
