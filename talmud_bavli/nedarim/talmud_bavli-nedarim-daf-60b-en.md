### Part 1
Abaye <b>said to him: If so,</b> the Sages <b>should</b> likewise <b>decree in the case of</b> one who takes a vow for <b>one day</b> that he must keep the vow until nightfall of the following day, <b>due to</b> the confusion that might be caused in a case where one said that his vow applies <b>today.</b> If the vow expires in the middle of the day, twenty-four hours after he took the vow, people might think that if one takes a vow in the morning and applies it to this day, it also expires in the middle of the day.

### Part 2
Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> A vow taken for <b>this day</b> might be <b>interchanged with</b> a vow taken for <b>one day,</b> and one might erroneously conclude that a vow taken for one day expires at nightfall. However, a vow taken for <b>one day</b> is <b>not interchanged</b> with a vow taken for <b>today,</b> and there is no concern that one who takes a vow for today will erroneously conclude that it expires in the middle of the day.

### Part 3
<b>Ravina said: Mareimar said to me: Your father said as follows, in the name of Rav Yosef: In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this <b><i>halakha</i></b> taught <b>by Rav Yirmeya bar Abba?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan says: Anyone who vows,</b> it is <b>as if he</b> has <b>built</b> a personal <b>altar,</b> which is forbidden because one must bring all offerings to the Temple. <b>And one who fulfills</b> the vow, <b>is as though he burns</b> portions meant for the altar in the Temple <b>upon it,</b> i.e., the personal altar, thereby increasing his sin. Consequently, even after he has fulfilled the vow, it is preferable for him to ask a halakhic authority to annul it entirely, so that it will be as if he never took a vow.

### Part 4
§ The mishna stated that one who says: Wine is <i>konam</i> for me, and for that reason I will not taste it <b>this week,</b> is <b>prohibited</b> from drinking wine <b>for the entire</b> remainder of the <b>week,</b> including Shabbat. The Gemara poses a question: <b>Isn’t</b> it <b>obvious</b> that this is the case? The Gemara answers: It is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>he said the days of the week,</b> i.e., he meant for his vow to apply only on the weekdays. The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the phrase this week includes Shabbat.

### Part 5
The mishna stated: If one says: <b>This month,</b> it is <b>forbidden</b> to him <b>for the entire</b> remainder of the <b>month, and</b> the <b>New Moon</b> is considered part <b>of the next</b> month. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> this <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When it was necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> it was <b>for</b> a New Moon preceding <b>a deficient,</b> twenty-nine-day <b>month.</b> In such a case the New Moon is celebrated for two days, the first of which is the thirtieth day of the previous month and the second of which is the first day of the new month. The case here is one where he took the vow on the first day of the New Moon.

### Part 6
This is <b>lest you say</b> that the first day of <b>the New Moon is</b> part <b>of the previous</b> month, <b>and</b> therefore the vow should expire at the end of that day, <b>and</b> wine <b>should not be forbidden</b> to him during the upcoming month. The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that since <b>people call it the New Moon</b> of the upcoming month, it is viewed as part of the upcoming month, and the vow applies to the new month.

### Part 7
§ The mishna states that if one says: <b>This year,</b> it is <b>forbidden</b> to him <b>for the entire</b> remainder of the <b>year,</b> and that Rosh HaShana is considered part of the upcoming year.

### Part 8
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the scholars: If one <b>said: Wine is <i>konam</i></b> for me, and for <b>that</b> reason <b>I</b> will not <b>taste</b> it for <b>a day, what is the <i>halakha</i></b> in <b>his</b> case? Is it considered <b>as</b> though he said <b>today,</b> and he is prohibited from consuming wine until nightfall, <b>or</b> is it considered <b>as</b> though he said <b>one day,</b> in which case the vow takes effect for a period of twenty-four hours?

### Part 9
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof <b>from the mishna:</b> If one says: <b>Wine is <i>konam</i></b> for me<b>,</b> and for <b>that</b> reason <b>I</b> will not <b>taste</b> it <b>today,</b> he is <b>prohibited</b> from drinking wine <b>only until</b> the conclusion of that day, at <b>nightfall.</b> The Gemara infers that this <i>halakha</i> only applies if he said the word today; <b>therefore,</b> if he said the vow applies for <b>a day,</b> it is considered <b>comparable</b> to a case where he said <b>one day,</b> and the vow is in effect for twenty-four hours.

### Part 10
The Gemara rejects this proof: But <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If <b>he said</b> that wine is forbidden to him for <b>one day,</b> he is <b>prohibited</b> from drinking wine <b>from</b> the <b>day</b> he took the vow <b>to</b> the same time on the following <b>day.</b> This indicates that it is only if he said: One day, that the vow takes effect for twenty-four hours; <b>but</b> if he said it takes effect for <b>a day,</b> it is <b>comparable</b> to a case where he said <b>today,</b> and the vow takes effect only until nightfall. <b>Rather, no</b> inference is <b>to be learned from this</b> mishna.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ashi said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this question from the following mishna (63a): If one vowed: <b>Wine is <i>konam</i></b> for me, and for that reason <b>I</b> will not <b>taste</b> it <b>this year, then</b> if <b>the year was extended,</b> i.e., declared to be a leap year, he is <b>prohibited</b> from drinking wine <b>in it and its intercalated</b> month. The Gemara inquires: <b>What are the circumstances?</b>
