### Part 1
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against the statement by Rabbi Zeira from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>When is the time of the rainfall? The early</b> rainfall occurs <b>on the third</b> of the month of Marḥeshvan; the <b>intermediate</b> rainfall is <b>on the seventh</b> of the month, while the <b>late</b> rainfall is <b>on the twenty-third</b> of the month. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The respective dates are <b>on the seventh, on the seventeenth, and on the twenty-third</b> of Marḥeshvan.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The first two time periods are <b>on the seventeenth and on the twenty-third</b> of Marḥeshvan, <b>and</b> the last period is <b>at</b> the beginning of the <b>month of Kislev. And so too, Rabbi Yosei would say:</b> The learned <b>individuals,</b> who would start to fast due to a drought at an earlier time than the rest of the community, <b>do not</b> start to <b>fast until the New Moon of Kislev arrives</b> and no rain has fallen.

### Part 3
<b>And we say about this: Granted,</b> they disagreed over the time of the <b>first rainfall,</b> as this time is relevant with regard <b>to asking</b> for rain through prayer. The time when the <b>third</b> rainfall is expected is relevant with regard <b>to fasting</b> due to lack of rain. <b>But</b> as for the expected time for the <b>second</b> rainfall, <b>for what</b> purpose did they disagree about its date? <b>And Rabbi Zeira said:</b> It is significant <b>for one who vows</b> until the rain.

### Part 4
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>we say about this: In accordance with whose opinion is that which is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> In the case of <b>rains that fell</b> for <b>seven days, one after another, you count them</b> as <b>the first rainfall and</b> the <b>second. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this statement? <b>In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who is the only <i>tanna</i> who holds that the first and second periods of rainfall span seven days. It is evident from this discussion that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel argues that one who vows until the rain must wait until after the second actual rainfall. This contradicts the statement of Rabbi Zeira that until the rain is referring to the date when rain is supposed to fall.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to one <b>who said: Until the rains,</b> rather than: Until the rain. Consequently, the expiration of his vow is determined by the actual time of rainfall.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of one who said: <b>Wine is <i>konam</i></b> for me, and for <b>that</b> reason <b>I will not taste</b> it <b>for the</b> entire <b>year,</b> if <b>the year was extended,</b> i.e., it was declared to be a leap year, he is <b>prohibited</b> from drinking wine <b>during</b> the year <b>and its intercalated</b> month. If he vowed <b>until the beginning of</b> the month of <b>Adar,</b> the vow remains in effect <b>until the beginning</b> of <b>the first Adar.</b> Similarly, if he says that his vow applies <b>until the end of Adar,</b> the vow remains in effect <b>until the end of the first Adar.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments on the statement in the mishna that if one takes a vow until the beginning of Adar, it remains in effect until the beginning of the first Adar. <b>Apparently,</b> when one <b>says Adar without specification,</b> his statement <b>is</b> understood as a reference to <b>the first</b> Adar.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>the mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In <b>the first</b> month of <b>Adar,</b> when dating a document, one <b>writes</b> that the document was composed in <b>the first Adar.</b> During the <b>second Adar,</b> one <b>writes</b> the name of the month of <b>Adar without specification;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says</b> the reverse: During <b>the first Adar</b> one <b>writes</b> the name of the month <b>without specification,</b> and in the <b>second Adar</b> he <b>writes</b> that the document was composed in the <b>second</b> Adar.

### Part 9
<b>Abaye said: You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> as there is a difference between the cases: In <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, the case is one <b>where</b> the individual who took the vow <b>knew that the year was extended,</b> i.e., declared as a leap year, and the disagreement concerns which Adar is considered the principal one. Conversely, <b>that</b> mishna is referring to a case <b>where he did not know</b> that it is a leap year and that there are two months of Adar. Consequently, when he referred to Adar, all agree that he meant the first Adar.
