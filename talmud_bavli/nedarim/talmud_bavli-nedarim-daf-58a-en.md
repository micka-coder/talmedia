### Part 1
For <b>any item that can become permitted,</b> i.e., a forbidden object whose prohibition can or will lapse, <b>for example, untithed produce</b> that can be permitted through tithing, <b>and second tithe</b> that is permitted through redemption or bringing it to Jerusalem (Deuteronomy 14:24–26), <b>and consecrated items</b> that are also permitted through redemption, <b>and</b> produce of the <b>new</b> crop that is permitted after the sacrifice of the <i>omer</i> offering (Leviticus 23:14), <b>the Sages did not determine a measure for their</b> neutralization, and no mixture with any quantity of permitted items neutralizes their prohibition. <b>And</b> for <b>any item that cannot become permitted, for example, <i>teruma</i>, and <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, and <i>ḥalla</i></b> (Numbers 15:20–21); <b>fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting [<i>orla</i>]; and forbidden food crops in a vineyard</b> (Deuteronomy 22:9), <b>the Sages determined a measure for their</b> neutralization.

### Part 2
The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon: <b>But isn’t Sabbatical-Year</b> produce <b>an item that cannot become permitted, and</b> nevertheless, <b>the Sages did not determine a measure for its</b> neutralization, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 7:7): <b>The Sabbatical-Year</b> produce <b>prohibits</b> permitted produce <b>of its</b> own <b>species</b> with which it is mixed <b>in any amount.</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them: I too said</b> that Sabbatical-Year produce prohibits permitted produce in a mixture and permitted growths that develop from it <b>only</b> with regard <b>to</b> the <b>removal</b> of the produce. Sabbatical-Year produce may be eaten only as long as produce of that species remains in the field, after which it must be removed from one’s possession. Since it is permitted to eat the produce before that time, its legal status during this period is that of an item that can become permitted.

### Part 3
<b>However,</b> with regard <b>to</b> the permissibility of <b>eating</b> Sabbatical-Year produce after the time of removal has passed, when eating that produce is prohibited, the Sages determined a measure for their neutralization. The mixture is forbidden only if the measure of that produce is enough <b>to impart flavor</b> to the mixture. Apparently, permitted growths can neutralize the prohibition of the original item. The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>And perhaps here too,</b> it <b>is different</b> when the ruling <b>is a stringency.</b> In this case, the stringency is that the original item is sacred with the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year. However, here too, there is no proof that the same would be true in cases where the result is a leniency.

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> Yishmael of Kefar Yamma <b>resolved</b> his dilemma <b>from this</b> source, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 6:3): With regard to sixth-year <b>onions upon which rain fell</b> during the Sabbatical Year, <b>and they sprouted, if their leaves were black [<i>sheḥorin</i>],</b> i.e., dark green, an indication of fresh, recent growth, the onions are <b>forbidden</b> as Sabbatical-Year growth. If their leaves <b>turned green [<i>horiku</i>],</b> i.e., lighter and yellower, and appeared withered, the onions are <b>permitted,</b> as they are considered a product of the sixth year.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says:</b> There is a different indicator; <b>if</b> the plants <b>can be uprooted by their leaves,</b> clearly the leaves are fresh and recent, and they are <b>forbidden. And</b> in the <b>parallel</b> situation, if that indicator was discovered in a Sabbatical-Year onion that sprouted <b>at the conclusion of the Sabbatical Year,</b> i.e., during the eighth year, the onions are <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> one may conclude from here that <b>permitted growth neutralizes the prohibition</b> of the original plant? The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <b>And perhaps</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>with regard to crushed [<i>medukhanin</i>],</b> pounded onions, and the reason that the prohibition of the original plant is neutralized is not that the permitted growth neutralizes the prohibition, but that it is no longer fit for consumption.

### Part 6
<b>Rather,</b> the dilemma can be resolved <b>from this</b> source; <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:
