### Part 1
<b>But rather,</b> explain <b>that she said: The benefit of bathing is <i>konam</i> for me forever if I bathe.</b> And it is <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>he may nullify her</b> vow, <b>as what can she do</b> if there is no nullification? If <b>she bathes, the benefit of bathing is</b> thereby <b>forbidden to her.</b> And if <b>she does not bathe, she will</b> suffer temporary <b>disfigurement [<i>nivvula</i>]. And Rabbi Yosei,</b> who maintains that this is not a vow of affliction, <b>maintains</b> that <b>it is possible for her not to bathe,</b> as <b>we are not concerned about</b> her <b>disfigurement.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, let</b> the mishna <b>teach like this: Rabbi Yosei says</b> that <b>this condition does not involve affliction,</b> as the content of the vow itself is irrelevant, since she can fulfill the condition.

### Part 3
The Gemara offers another explanation: <b>Rather,</b> explain <b>that she said: The benefit of bathing is</b> <i>konam</i> <b>for me forever if I bathe today. And Rabbi Yosei maintains</b> that nothing will happen if she refrains from bathing today, as the <b>disfigurement</b> resulting <b>from</b> not bathing for <b>one day is not called disfigurement.</b>
