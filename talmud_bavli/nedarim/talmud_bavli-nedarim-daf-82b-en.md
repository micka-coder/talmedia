### Part 1
<b>And the mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who is more restrictive in his definition of affliction. <b>As Rav Huna said: Our entire chapter is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> Shmuel, on the other hand, rules in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. <b>And what</b> does Rabbi Yosei mean when he says that the husband <b>cannot nullify</b> his wife’s vows? He means that he cannot nullify them <b>as</b> vows of <b>affliction, but he can nullify</b> them as <b>vows that</b> adversely affect the relationship <b>between him and her.</b>

### Part 2
§ <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> In a case where a woman <b>vowed</b> that <b>two loaves</b> are forbidden to her, and if she abstains <b>from one</b> of them she would <b>deprive herself,</b> as it is a fine-quality loaf, <b>and</b> if she abstains <b>from</b> the other <b>one</b> she would <b>not deprive herself,</b> as it is a poor-quality loaf, then, <b>since</b> the husband <b>can nullify</b> the vow <b>with regard to the</b> loaf that would cause her to <b>deprive herself,</b> like any other vow of affliction, <b>he can</b> also <b>nullify</b> the vow <b>with regard to the</b> loaf that would <b>not</b> cause her to <b>deprive herself. And Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The husband <b>can nullify</b> the vow <b>with regard to the</b> loaf that would cause her to <b>deprive herself, but he cannot nullify</b> the vow <b>with regard to the</b> loaf that would <b>not</b> cause her to <b>deprive herself.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And some say</b> a different version of this dispute, according to which <b>Rav Asi raised a dilemma before Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> In a case where a woman <b>vowed</b> not to eat <b>from two loaves</b> of bread, and if she abstains <b>from one</b> of them she would <b>deprive herself, and</b> if she abstains <b>from</b> the other <b>one</b> she would <b>not deprive herself, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> The husband <b>can nullify</b> the vow <b>with regard to the</b> loaf that would cause her to <b>deprive herself, but he cannot nullify</b> the vow <b>with regard to the</b> loaf that would <b>not</b> cause her to <b>deprive herself.</b>

### Part 4
Rav Asi <b>raised an objection</b> against Rabbi Yoḥanan from the following mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 23a): With regard to <b>a woman who vowed</b> to be <b>a nazirite, and she</b> transgressed her vow and <b>drank wine or became impure</b> by coming into contact <b>with the dead,</b>
