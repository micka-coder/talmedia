### Part 1
<b>If you say</b> that since <b>he did not</b> explicitly <b>say to her</b> that the vow is nullified, this means that it remains in force, then if <b>he said to her: It is nullified for you tomorrow, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>on the following day he cannot nullify</b> it, <b>as he has</b> already <b>ratified the vow today,</b> in that he did not nullify it “on the day that he hears it” (Numbers 30:8)? <b>Or perhaps, since he did not</b> explicitly <b>say to her: It is ratified for you today,</b> then <b>when he says to her: It is nullified for you tomorrow, he is</b> actually <b>saying</b> that the nullification begins <b>from today,</b> so that the vow is nullified.

### Part 2
<b>And if you say: Nevertheless, since he ratified it today,</b> as he said that it is nullified only tomorrow, <b>on the following day it is considered</b> already <b>in force</b> and he cannot nullify it, then if <b>he said to her: It is ratified for you</b> for <b>an hour, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that it is <b>like one who said to her: It is nullified for you after an hour</b> has passed? <b>Or perhaps,</b> since <b>he did not say</b> this <b>to her</b> explicitly, it is not nullified?

### Part 3
<b>If you say that</b> since <b>he did not say</b> so <b>to her</b> explicitly, therefore the vow is not nullified after an hour, <b>still,</b> if <b>he</b> explicitly <b>said to her</b> that it is nullified after an hour, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since he has ratified this</b> vow, in that he explicitly withheld nullification for an hour, <b>he has ratified it</b> and can no longer nullify it? <b>Or, perhaps since the entire day is valid for ratification and valid for nullification, when he says: It is nullified for you after an hour,</b> it <b>is effective.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara cites a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 20b) to resolve this last question: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> If a woman said: <b>I am hereby a nazirite, and her husband heard</b> her vow <b>and said: And I,</b> meaning that he intends to become a nazirite as well, <b>he can no</b> longer <b>nullify</b> his wife’s vow. <b>And why</b> not? <b>Let us say that</b> the words: <b>And I, that he said</b> referred <b>to himself, that he should be a nazirite. But her</b> vow of: <b>I am hereby a nazirite,</b> exists for one hour, i.e., the time until the husband took his own vow based on hers. <b>After an hour, if he wants to nullify</b> it, <b>why can he not nullify</b> it? Is it <b>not because once he has ratified it</b> by basing his vow on hers, even for one hour, <b>he has ratified it</b> permanently and can no longer nullify it? The Gemara rejects this suggestion. <b>No,</b> that is not the explanation. The <i>tanna</i> of that mishna <b>holds</b> that <b>anyone</b> who says the words: <b>And I,</b> in response to his wife’s vow, <b>is like one who says: It is ratified for you forever.</b> All the aforementioned questions are therefore left unresolved.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>the father</b> of a betrothed young woman <b>dies,</b> his <b>authority does not revert to the husband,</b> and the husband cannot nullify the young woman’s vows by himself. However, if <b>the husband dies,</b> his <b>authority reverts to the father,</b> who can now nullify her vows on his own. <b>In this</b> matter, <b>the power of the father is enhanced relative to the power of the husband.</b>

### Part 6
<b>In another matter, the power of the husband is enhanced relative to the power of the father, as the husband nullifies</b> vows <b>during</b> the woman’s <b>adulthood,</b> once they are fully married, <b>whereas the father does not nullify</b> her vows <b>during</b> her <b>adulthood.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason,</b> i.e., what is the source for the fact that the authority over the young woman’s vows does not revert to the husband if her father dies? The source is <b>that the verse states: “Being in her youth, in her father’s house”</b> (Numbers 30:17). As long as she is a young woman “in her youth,” she is considered to be “in her father’s house” and under his jurisdiction, even if she is betrothed. Even if her father passes away, she is still considered to be in his house, and her betrothed does not assume authority over her vows.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that if <b>the husband died</b> his <b>authority reverts to the father? Rabba said:</b> We derive it from the fact <b>that the verse states: “And if she be [<i>hayo tihyeh</i>] to a husband, and her vows are upon her”</b> (Numbers 30:7). The phrase <i>hayo tihyeh</i> is a doubled usage of the verb to be. The Gemara understands this as referring to two different instances of being betrothed to a man, e.g., the woman’s first betrothed dies and then she is betrothed to another man.
