### Part 1
<b>If we say</b> that it is exactly <b>as it teaches, why do I</b> need <b>to state</b> this <i>halakha</i>? It is obvious that a year means that entire year, even if it is a leap year. <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> he did not say that the vow applies this year, but rather, <b>he said</b> that it applies for <b>a year,</b> and the mishna teaches that the vow applies for the remainder of that year? <b>Apparently,</b> saying that a vow applies for <b>a year</b> is <b>comparable to</b> saying it applies <b>this year; and</b> similarly, <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> in a case where one accepts a vow for <b>a day</b> should <b>also be like</b> the <i>halakha</i> in a case where one accepts a vow for <b>today.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>No, actually,</b> the case in the mishna is <b>that he said</b> his vow should apply <b>this year, and</b> it was necessary to state this <i>halakha</i> <b>lest you say: Follow the majority of years, which do not have an intercalated</b> month, and his vow should be understood as referring to a twelve month period. The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the phrase this year means that the vow should last until the end of the year.

### Part 3
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one <b>said:</b> Any <b>wine that I taste</b> for <b>a Jubilee</b> is hereby forbidden to me, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is <b>the fiftieth year</b> considered <b>as before fifty,</b> i.e., is it included in the vow, <b>or</b> is it considered <b>as after fifty,</b> in which case it is not included in the vow?

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that there is <b>a dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis:</b> The verse states: <b>“And you shall sanctify the fiftieth year”</b> (Leviticus 25:10), from which it is derived: <b>You count</b> it as <b>the fiftieth year,</b> i.e., the Jubilee Year, <b>but you do not count</b> it as both the <b>fiftieth year and</b> the <b>first</b> year of the next Sabbatical and Jubilee cycles. <b>From here they stated:</b> The <b>Jubilee Year is not included in the counting of the seven-year</b> cycle of the Sabbatical Year. Rather, the year following the Jubilee Year is considered the first year of the next seven-year cycle. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The Jubilee Year is included in the counting of the</b> following <b>seven-year</b> cycle of the Sabbatical Year.

### Part 5
The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Yehuda: Doesn’t</b> the verse <b>state: “Six years you shall sow your field”</b> (Leviticus 25:3)? <b>But</b> according to your opinion <b>there are only five</b> years <b>here,</b> in the Sabbatical cycle following the Jubilee Year, as the first year would be the Jubilee Year, when it is forbidden to sow one’s field.

### Part 6
Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to them:</b> There is a difficulty <b>according to your statement</b> as well. <b>Doesn’t</b> the verse <b>state: “And it shall bring forth produce for the three years”</b> (Leviticus 25:21)? The Torah promises the Jewish people that in the year preceding the Sabbatical Year, the land will bring forth enough produce to last for the duration of that year, for the Sabbatical Year, and for part of the following year, until the new produce grows. However, in the case of the Jubilee, <b>there are four</b> years to account for, as agricultural labor is prohibited in the forty-ninth year, which is a Sabbatical Year, and in the following year, which is the Jubilee Year.

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> you must say that <b>it is possible to establish</b> the verse as referring <b>to the other years of seven-year</b> cycles, i.e., other Sabbatical Years apart from the Sabbatical Year right before the Jubilee Year. With regard to <b>my</b> opinion <b>also, it is possible to establish</b> the verse you presented as a difficulty as referring <b>to the other years of seven-year</b> cycles, i.e., other Sabbatical cycles apart from the cycle immediately following the Jubilee. With regard to the dilemma cited previously, according to the Rabbis, just as the Jubilee Year does not count as part of the ensuing Jubilee cycle because it is considered the end of the previous Jubilee cycle, if one takes a vow and states that it applies for the Jubilee cycle, the Jubilee Year is included in the vow. According to Rabbi Yehuda, the Jubilee Year itself actually begins the next Jubilee cycle, and therefore if one takes a vow for the current Jubilee cycle, the Jubilee Year itself is not included.

### Part 8
§ It was taught in the mishna that if one vows that wine is forbidden to him <b>until Passover,</b> he is <b>prohibited</b> from drinking wine until the Festival arrives. However, if one vows that wine is forbidden to him until before Passover, there is a dispute as to whether the vow remains in effect until the beginning or the end of the Festival. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Rabbi Meir,</b> who holds that it is prohibited only until the beginning of Passover, <b>maintains</b> that <b>a person does not place himself</b>
