### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i></b> to perform levirate marriage, <b>whether</b> she is waiting <b>for one <i>yavam</i>,</b> if her late husband had only one brother, or <b>whether</b> she is waiting <b>for two</b> or more <b><i>yevamin</i>,</b> if he had several brothers, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> A <i>yavam</i> <b>can nullify</b> her vows. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> If she is waiting <b>for one</b> <i>yavam</i>, he can nullify her vows, <b>but not</b> if she is waiting <b>for two. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> A <i>yavam</i> <b>cannot</b> nullify her vows, regardless of whether she is waiting <b>for one</b> <i>yavam</i> <b>or for two</b> or more.

### Part 2
The mishna then elaborates: <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: Just as</b> with regard to <b>a woman he acquired for himself</b> through betrothal, <b>he nullifies her vows,</b> so too with regard to <b>a woman acquired for him from Heaven,</b> i.e., the <i>yevama</i>, <b>isn’t it logical that he should</b> be able to <b>nullify her vows?</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: No, if you say</b> that a husband can nullify the vows of <b>a woman he acquired for himself, over whom others have no authority, shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the case with regard to <b>a woman acquired for him from Heaven, over whom others have authority?</b> If there are two <i>yevamin</i>, each <i>yavam</i> has equal authority with regard to her vows.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: Akiva, your statement applies</b> in a situation <b>with two <i>yevamin</i>,</b> but <b>how do you reply</b> to Rabbi Eliezer <b>in</b> the case of <b>one <i>yavam</i>?</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: A <i>yevama</i> is not the full-fledged</b> wife <b>of the <i>yavam</i> in the in the way that a betrothed woman</b> is <b>her husband’s full-fledged</b> wife, and the <i>yavam</i> is not empowered to nullify vows at all.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The latter two opinions in the mishna <b>make sense: Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that the levirate <b>bond is not substantial.</b> Since the obligation of levirate marriage does not create a marriage-like bond between the <i>yavam</i> and the <i>yevama</i>, a <i>yavam</i> cannot nullify the vows of the <i>yevama</i>. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua holds</b> that the levirate <b>bond is substantial,</b> so that if there is only one <i>yavam</i>, the <i>yevama</i> is considered his wife, allowing him to nullify her vows. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Eliezer, what is his reason?</b> Even <b>if</b> he holds that the levirate <b>bond is substantial, there is,</b> nevertheless, <b>no</b> retroactive <b>designation.</b> Since it has not yet been established which of them will be her husband, how can either of them nullify her vows?

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ami said:</b> It is a case <b>where</b> one <i>yavam</i> has already <b>performed levirate betrothal with her.</b> According to Beit Hillel, levirate betrothal does not have the full force of a regular betrothal, <b>but Rabbi Eliezer holds like Beit Shammai, who say: Levirate betrothal effects a full-fledged acquisition</b> just like a regular betrothal.

### Part 7
<b>But Rabbi Yehoshua</b> would <b>say to you,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, in response: <b>That</b> statement, that <b>levirate</b> betrothal effects a full-fledged acquisition, <b>applies</b> only to a case <b>with one <i>yavam</i>, but with two <i>yevamin</i></b> it is <b>not</b> so. The Gemara explains why it cannot be a full-fledged acquisition where there is more than one <i>yavam</i>: <b>Is there anything</b> like this sort of betrothal that <b>when his brother comes,</b> he <b>can render</b> the betrothed woman <b>forbidden to</b> the one who performed levirate betrothal <b>by</b> engaging in <b>sexual intercourse</b> with the <i>yevama</i>, thereby performing levirate marriage, <b>or by</b> giving her <b>a bill of divorce,</b> thereby disqualifying her from levirate marriage, <b>and</b> nevertheless the betrothed <b>can</b> still <b>nullify</b> her vows? Since this betrothal can in essence be nullified, it cannot be viewed as betrothal with regard to nullification of vows. Rabbi Ami completes his analysis: <b>And Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that the levirate <b>bond is not substantial</b> at all, and there is no marital bond between a <i>yevama</i> and her <i>yavam</i> until the levirate marriage is consummated.

### Part 8
The Gemara challenges Rabbi Ami’s interpretation of the dispute: <b>And according to</b> the <i>amora</i> <b>Rabbi Elazar, who said</b> that <b>levirate betrothal, according to Beit Shammai, does not effect</b> a full-fledged <b>acquisition except</b> in that it <b>removes a rival wife</b> from being considered substantially bound to the <i>yavam</i> while she is a <i>yevama</i>, <b>what can be said?</b> Only the relatives of the betrothed <i>yevama</i> are then forbidden to the <i>yavam</i>.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>stood</b> in court <b>in judgment</b> after the woman demanded that he marry her <b>and he was obligated</b> by the court to provide <b>her sustenance. And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> that which <b>Rav Pineḥas</b> stated <b>in the name of Rava, who said: Any</b> woman <b>who vows,</b> that which <b>she vows</b> is contingent <b>upon her husband’s consent.</b> Since under these circumstances the <i>yavam</i> must provide for the <i>yevama</i> he betrothed, he is authorized to nullify her vows.
