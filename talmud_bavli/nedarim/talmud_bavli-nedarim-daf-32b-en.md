### Part 1
The letters of the term <b>the Satan [<i>haSatan</i>] in numerical value</b> is <b>364,</b> which equals the number of days of the year, except for Yom Kippur, during which he has no power. <b>And Rami bar Abba said: It is written “Abram,” and</b> after he was commanded to perform circumcision <b>it is written “Abraham”</b> (Genesis 17:5). <b>Initially the Holy One, Blessed be He, enthroned him</b> as ruler <b>over 243 limbs,</b> which is the numerical equivalent of the letters of the word Abram. <b>And in the end,</b> after he was circumcised, <b>He enthroned him</b> as ruler <b>over 248 limbs,</b> which is the numerical equivalent of the letters of the word Abraham.

### Part 2
<b>These are</b> the additional limbs: <b>Two eyes, and two ears, and the tip of the sex organ.</b> Following his circumcision, he had total control over them, and they performed only according to his will.

### Part 3
<b>And Rami bar Abba said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “There was a little city and</b> few <b>men</b> in it, and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it. Now there was found in it a man poor and wise, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man” (Ecclesiastes 9:14–15)? <b>“A little city,” this</b> is referring to <b>the body; “and few men in it,” this</b> is referring to <b>the limbs; “and there came a great king against it and besieged it,” this</b> is referring to <b>the evil inclination; “and built great bulwarks against it,” these</b> are <b>sins.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara expounds on the next section of the verse: <b>“Now there was found in it a man poor and wise,” this</b> is referring to <b>the good inclination; “and he by his wisdom delivered the city,” this</b> is referring to <b>repentance and good deeds</b> that are caused by the good inclination. <b>“Yet no man remembered that same poor man”</b> means <b>that when the evil inclination</b> overcomes the good inclination <b>no one remembers the good inclination.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara interprets the following verse in a similar homiletical manner: <b>“Wisdom is a stronghold to the wise man more than ten rulers</b> that are in a city” (Ecclesiastes 7:19). <b>“Wisdom is a stronghold to the wise man,” this</b> is referring to <b>repentance and good deeds. “More than ten rulers,”</b> these are <b>the two eyes, and two ears, and two hands, and two legs, and the tip of the sex organ, and the mouth,</b> which are the limbs that are used by a person to interact with the world.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Zekharya said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: The Holy One, Blessed be He, wanted the priesthood to emerge from Shem,</b> so that his children would be priests, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine; <b>and he was priest of God the Most High”</b> (Genesis 14:18). <b>Once</b> Melchizedek, traditionally identified as Shem, <b>placed the blessing of Abraham before the blessing of the Omnipresent,</b> He had the priesthood <b>emerge from Abraham</b> in particular, and not from any other descendant of Shem.

### Part 7
<b>As it is stated: “And he blessed him and said: Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth, and blessed be God the Most High”</b> (Genesis 14:19–20). <b>Abraham said to him: And does one place the blessing of the servant before the blessing of his master?</b> You should have blessed God first. <b>Immediately</b> the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>gave</b> the priesthood <b>to Abraham, as it is stated: “The Lord says to my lord: Sit at My right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool”</b> (Psalms 110:1), <b>and afterward it is written: “The Lord has sworn, and will not repent: you shall be a priest forever, because you are a king of righteousness [<i>al divrati malki tzedek</i>]”</b> (Psalms 110:4), which is explained homiletically to mean: <b>Due to the</b> improper <b>words [<i>divrati</i>] of Melchizedek,</b> the offspring of Abraham shall be priests of God forever.

### Part 8
The Gemara comments: <b>And this is as it is written: “And he was priest of God the Most High”</b> (Genesis 14:18), which emphasizes that <b>he,</b> Melchizedek, <b>is a priest, but his children</b> will <b>not</b> be <b>priests.</b>

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow [<i>hamuddar hana’a meḥaveiro</i>] and one for whom</b> benefit <b>from his food is forbidden by vow</b> concerns <b>only setting foot</b> on the other person’s property <b>and</b> borrowing from that person <b>utensils that one does not use</b> in <b>preparation of food</b> but for other purposes. Those two benefits are forbidden to the former but permitted to the latter.

### Part 11
Therefore, with regard to <b>one for whom</b> benefit <b>from another’s food is forbidden by vow,</b> that person <b>may not lend him</b> utensils used in the preparation of food, e.g., <b>a sieve, or a strainer, or a millstone, or an oven. However, he may lend him a garment, or a finger ring, or a cloak, or nose rings,</b> as these are not used in the preparation of food. However, he may not lend them to one for whom benefit from him is forbidden by vow.

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who taught this mishna? <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said: It is Rabbi Eliezer, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: Even overlooking [<i>vittur</i>]</b> a matter for which one is typically indifferent to the actions of others, e.g., people setting foot on one’s property, <b>is prohibited in</b> the case of <b>one prohibited by vow from deriving benefit</b> from another.

### Part 13
§ We learned in the mishna: With regard to <b>one for whom</b> benefit <b>from another’s food is forbidden by vow,</b> that person <b>may not lend him</b> utensils used in the preparation of food.
