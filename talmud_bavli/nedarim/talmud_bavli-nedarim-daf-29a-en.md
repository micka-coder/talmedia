### Part 1
<b>Rav Hamnuna said</b> to Ulla: <b>Where did their sanctity go?</b> How can the consecrated saplings become non-sacred without being redeemed? <b>And what</b> would happen <b>if</b> one <b>said to a woman</b> while performing betrothal: <b>Today you are my wife and tomorrow you are not my wife? Would she exit</b> the marriage the next day <b>without a bill of divorce?</b> Likewise, in the mishna, once one consecrated the saplings, how is their sanctity withdrawn without redemption?

### Part 2
<b>Rava said to him:</b> How <b>do you compare sanctity</b> inherent in its <b>value</b> to <b>inherent sanctity? Sanctity</b> inherent in its <b>value departs with nothing</b> being done, since it is conditional. When the condition is fulfilled and the saplings are cut, the sanctity is removed. However, <b>inherent sanctity,</b> which relates to an entity that itself is consecrated, e.g., a betrothed woman, <b>does not depart with nothing</b> being done. An action must be performed in order to remove it.

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> And does <b>inherent sanctity not depart with nothing</b> being done? <b>But isnâ€™t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if one said: <b>This ox</b> is <b>a burnt-offering</b> for <b>all</b> of <b>thirty days and after thirty days</b> it is <b>a peace-offering,</b> for <b>all</b> of <b>thirty days</b> it is <b>a burnt-offering</b> and <b>after thirty days</b> it is <b>a peace-offering.</b> One can ask: <b>Why</b> is this so? <b>These</b> offerings <b>are</b> examples of <b>inherent sanctity, and it departs with nothing</b> being done. After thirty days, it is transformed into a peace-offering without any action being taken.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is a case <b>where</b> one did not consecrate the animal as a burnt-offering or peace-offering but rather <b>he said</b> that he was consecrating it <b>for</b> its <b>monetary value,</b> with which to purchase a burnt-offering or peace-offering. Therefore, there was no inherent sanctity.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, say the latter clause:</b> If he said that <b>after thirty days</b> it should be <b>a burnt-offering, and from now</b> until thirty days it should be <b>a peace-offering,</b> his words are binding. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>one</b> clause is referring <b>to inherent sanctity and one</b> clause is referring <b>to sanctity</b> inherent in its <b>value,</b>
