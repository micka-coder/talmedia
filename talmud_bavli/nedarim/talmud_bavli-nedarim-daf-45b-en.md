### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Partners who vowed</b> not to derive <b>benefit from one another are prohibited from entering into a courtyard</b> that they jointly own, since each one has a portion in it and benefits from the share owned by the other, thereby leading to a violation of the vow. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaâ€™akov says:</b> It is permitted for both to use the courtyard, as it can be said that since each has a portion in the courtyard; <b>this one enters into his own</b> portion <b>and that one enters into his own</b> portion.
