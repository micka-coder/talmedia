### Part 1
The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov and the Rabbis is with regard to a courtyard <b>where there is sufficient</b> area <b>in</b> the courtyard for it to be <b>divided</b> into four square cubits for each partner, so each can be said to have a real portion that can be forbidden to the other. <b>But</b> if <b>there is not sufficient</b> area <b>in it</b> to be <b>divided, everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>permitted</b> to benefit from it, since the entire courtyard is viewed as belonging to both of them and each one can say that he is entering his own portion.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yosef said to</b> Rabba: <b>A synagogue</b> belongs to the entire public and is therefore <b>considered like</b> a courtyard in which <b>there is not sufficient</b> area <b>in it</b> to be <b>divided, and we learned in</b> a mishna later in the chapter (48a) that with regard to two people who vow not to derive benefit from each other, <b>both are prohibited</b> from deriving benefit <b>from an entity belonging to that city</b> such as a synagogue. Evidently, the Rabbis prohibit deriving benefit even from such entities.

### Part 3
<b>Rather, Rav Yosef said: Ze’eiri</b> must have <b>said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> holds <b>where there is not sufficient</b> area <b>in</b> the courtyard for it to be <b>divided, but</b> if <b>there is sufficient</b> area <b>in it</b> for it to be <b>divided, everyone agrees that</b> it is <b>forbidden,</b> since if either enters it he may be entering the other’s portion.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Huna said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. And so too, Rabbi Elazar said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b>

### Part 5
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>one prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from another and he has a bathhouse</b> or an olive press in the city that is leased out and available for public use, the forbidden party may use it only if the owner has forfeited his own right to profits from usage. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> is this <b>right</b> to profits from <b>usage</b> that prohibits the subject of the vow from entering the bathhouse? <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> In cases where he receives <b>one half, one-third, or one-quarter</b> of the profits of the bathhouse. <b>But in</b> a case where he receives <b>less,</b> it is <b>not</b> forbidden. <b>Abaye said: Even in</b> a case where he receives <b>less,</b> it is <b>forbidden.</b> If so, <b>what are the circumstances in which</b> it is <b>permitted</b> and he is not considered to have a right to profits from usage? <b>Where he</b> completely forfeits all profits and <b>receives</b> only <b>an annual rental fee [<i>taska</i>]</b> from a tenant.
