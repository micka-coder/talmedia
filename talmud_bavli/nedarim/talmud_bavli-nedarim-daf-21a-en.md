### Part 1
In this case, one may assume that <b>both want</b> to complete the deal <b>at three dinars,</b> and they did not intend to vow but only exaggerated for purposes of bargaining.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states: <b>The Sages dissolved four</b> types of <b>vows. Rabbi Abba bar Memel said to Rabbi Ami: You said to us in the name of Rabbi Yehuda Nesia: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this mishna of <b>four vows? It</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said in the name of Rabbi Tarfon:</b> With regard to two people who entered into a wager, and each declared that he would become a nazirite if the other was right, then <b>actually neither of them</b> becomes <b>a nazirite, because naziriteship is determined only by explicitness</b> of intent. One cannot become a nazirite unless he vows clearly and with certitude. Here too, since the intent of the wagering parties was not actually to vow, the <i>halakha</i> is that the vow is invalid.

### Part 3
<b>Rava said: You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda. <b>Does</b> the mishna <b>teach: Both wanted</b> the price to be three dinars? <b>It teaches: Both want,</b> in the present tense, demonstrating that they would have been satisfied with that price from the outset and never intended to vow, so the vow is not binding.

### Part 4
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> If the seller <b>said to</b> the buyer in the form of a vow that the price must remain <b>more than a <i>sela</i>, and the other</b> declared in the form of a vow that the price must remain <b>less than a shekel,</b> what is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Is this a vow,</b> where each stands firmly in his position? <b>Or</b> perhaps this <b>is</b> also merely for <b>encouragement?</b>

### Part 5
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: We</b> already <b>learned</b> about a similar case: If one <b>was importuning another that he should eat with him</b> and the other refused <b>and said to him: Entering your house is <i>konam</i> for me,</b> or: <b>A drop of cold</b> water is <i>konam</i> for me, and for <b>that</b> reason <b>I</b> will not <b>taste</b> it with you, <b>it is permitted</b> for him <b>to enter his house and drink cold</b> water <b>since he intended it</b> as a vow <b>only for the purpose of eating and drinking</b> a large amount but did not mean literally that he would not drink anything.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And why</b> is this permitted? <b>But he said: A drop of cold</b> water, so how can you say that the vow is only with regard to drinking a large amount? <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>a person speaks this way</b> in exaggerated terms but does not mean literally what he says. <b>Here also,</b> in the case of the buyer and seller, <b>a person speaks this way.</b> He exaggerates and does not intend the literal meaning of his words, even though he was quite precise in his wording.

### Part 7
Ravina <b>said to him:</b>
