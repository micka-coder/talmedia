### Part 1
then <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that</b> it <b>was necessary for the <i>tanna</i> to teach two</b> clauses: In order to emphasize that this <i>halakha</i> applies in both cases, <b>as</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say: Inherent sanctity does not lapse on its own,</b> but <b>sanctity</b> inherent in its <b>value departs with nothing</b> being done. <b>Because of this, the <i>tanna</i> taught two</b> clauses, to demonstrate that there is no difference between them: Both depart with nothing being done.

### Part 2
<b>But if you say</b> that <b>this</b> clause <b>and that</b> clause refer to <b>sanctity</b> inherent in its <b>value, why do I</b> need <b>to teach two</b> clauses? <b>Now, it can be said</b> that if <b>from the stringent sanctity</b> of the burnt-offering <b>to the less stringent sanctity</b> of a peace-offering, the stringent sanctity <b>departs</b> and the animal becomes like a peace-offering, then <b>from the less stringent sanctity</b> of the peace-offering <b>to the more stringent sanctity</b> of the burnt-offering, <b>need this be said?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara proposes: <b>Let</b> us <b>say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> <b>should be a conclusive refutation of bar Padda, who said: Sanctity does not depart with nothing</b> being done and the trees require redemption, while the <i>baraita</i> demonstrates that even inherent sanctity lapses on its own?

### Part 4
<b>Rav Pappa said: Bar Padda</b> could have <b>said to you: This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If one says: This ox, after thirty days, is a burnt-offering, then <b>if he does not say: From now</b> it is <b>a peace-offering,</b> then <b>after thirty days it is a burnt-offering.</b> But when he adds: From now it is a peace-offering, the sanctity of a peace-offering takes effect upon it and does not depart with nothing being done.

### Part 5
This is <b>just as it is</b> in the case of a man <b>who says to a woman: Be betrothed to me after thirty days</b> with this money that I give you, <b>that</b> she <b>is betrothed</b> after thirty days. <b>And</b> this is so, <b>although the money was squandered away</b> in the meantime and does not exist at the end of thirty days, when the betrothal takes effect. Here as well, the sanctity of a burnt-offering takes effect after thirty days.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: If this is what happened, then it <b>is obvious</b> that it is so. Why, then, does this <i>halakha</i> need to be taught? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where he retracted</b> within these thirty days and did not want the animal to be consecrated at all. Although the sanctity did not actually take effect yet, he may not retract.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> works out <b>well according to the one who said</b> that a woman who is betrothed on the condition that the betrothal takes effect after thirty days <b>may not retract</b> even if she changed her mind within these thirty days, and the betrothal still takes effect after thirty days. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>she may retract, what can be said?</b> Why should the <i>halakha</i> of consecration be any different than for betrothal?

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>Even according to the one who says</b> that <b>there,</b> in the case of betrothal, the woman <b>may retract</b> within thirty days, <b>here,</b> in the case of the burnt-offering, <b>it is different because</b> the legal status of <b>one’s declaration to God is equal to</b> that of <b>his transfer to a common person [<i>hedyot</i>],</b> where the acquisition is consummated at the time of transfer. Since God is not associated with a particular location, a verbal statement is sufficient to establish sanctity immediately. But in the case of the betrothal of a woman, it can be argued that the betrothal takes effect only at the end of thirty days.

### Part 9
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Avin and Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi, sat before Rabbi Yirmeya, and Rabbi Yirmeya was dozing [<i>menamnem</i>].</b> While he was dozing, <b>they sat and said: According to bar Padda, who said</b> that if he <b>redeems them</b> they <b>become consecrated again,</b>
