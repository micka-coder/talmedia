### Part 1
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: In <b>a place where one takes payment</b> for returning a lost item, the <b>benefit</b> that he receives for returning the item <b>should fall into</b> the category of <b>consecrated</b> Temple property. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says that even</b> in a case <b>where the property of the owner of the lost item is forbidden to the one returning</b> the lost item, <b>he returns</b> it to him. <b>This</b> explanation <b>is</b> consistent with <b>that which</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> In <b>a place where one takes payment</b> for returning a lost item, the <b>benefit</b> that he receives for returning the item <b>should fall into</b> the category of <b>consecrated</b> Temple property.

### Part 2
<b>However, according to the one who says</b> that in a case <b>where the property of the owner of the lost item is forbidden to the one returning</b> the lost item, <b>he may not return</b> it to him, and the mishna is referring exclusively to a case where the property of the one returning the lost object is forbidden to the owner of the lost object, <b>why should the benefit fall into</b> the category of <b>consecrated</b> Temple property? It is not prohibited for him to benefit from the property of the owner.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches about</b> only <b>one</b> of the cases: The property of the one returning the lost object is forbidden to the owner, and the one returning the lost object refuses to accept compensation. In that case, the owner of the lost item benefits from the one returning the lost object by allowing him to keep the compensation. Therefore, the benefit is donated to the Temple treasury.

### Part 4
<b>There are</b> those <b>who teach</b> the dispute <b>in this formulation: Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi disagree about this. One said: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where the property of the owner of</b> the <b>lost item is forbidden to</b> the <b>one returning</b> the lost item, <b>and</b> the concern <b>due to</b> the <b><i>peruta</i> of Rav Yosef</b> is not a concern, because it is <b>not common. However,</b> in a case <b>where the property of</b> the <b>one returning</b> the lost item <b>is forbidden to</b> the <b>owner of</b> the <b>lost item, he may not return</b> it <b>to him, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> in doing so <b>he benefits him.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And one said: Even if the property of</b> the <b>one returning</b> the lost item <b>is forbidden to</b> the <b>owner of the lost item,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to return it to him, <b>as when he returns it, he is returning</b> to him <b>something of his own</b> and is not giving him anything new.

### Part 6
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: In <b>a place where one takes payment</b> for returning a lost item, the <b>benefit</b> that he receives for returning the item <b>should fall into</b> the category of <b>consecrated</b> Temple property. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says that even if the property of</b> the <b>one returning</b> the lost item <b>is forbidden to</b> the <b>owner of the lost item he returns</b> it to him, <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that</b> it is necessary to <b>resolve</b> the <i>halakha</i> in <b>a place</b> where one takes payment.

### Part 7
<b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>in</b> a case <b>where the property of</b> the <b>one returning</b> the lost item <b>is forbidden</b> to the owner of the lost item <b>he may not return</b> it to him, <b>how does he explain</b> the <i>halakha</i> taught with regard to <b>a place</b> where one takes payment? Since the mishna is referring to a case where the property of the owner of the lost item is forbidden to the one returning the lost item, why is it prohibited for the owner of the lost item to keep the payment? It is not prohibited for him to benefit from the property of the one returning the lost item. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is <b>difficult.</b>
