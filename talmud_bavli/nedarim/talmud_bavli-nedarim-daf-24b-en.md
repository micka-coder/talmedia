### Part 1
mean <b>that even in the earlier</b> cases, where he did not become irritated, they disagree with regard to vows of exhortation and hold that these vows are indeed valid, <b>and</b> can one <b>conclude from</b> here that <b>the Rabbis disagree with him?</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Conclude from</b> here that this is so.

### Part 2
With regard to the practical conclusion of this dispute, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? Does the <i>halakha</i> follow the opinion of the Rabbis or that of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov? The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that <b>which Rav Huna said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. And so said Rav Adda bar Ahava:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Vows of exaggeration</b> that the Sages dissolved without a request to a halakhic authority, as described in the first mishna in the chapter, include the following examples. If <b>one said</b> concerning a certain item: It is <b><i>konam</i></b> for me <b>if I did not see on this road</b> as many people <b>as those who ascended</b> from <b>Egypt,</b> or if he said: It is <i>konam</i> for me <b>if I did not see a snake</b> as large <b>as</b> the <b>beam of an olive press,</b> in these cases the speaker did not intend to vow but used hyperbole to demonstrate a point, and it is understood by others that the expression is not to be taken literally.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A Sage taught:</b> Items rendered forbidden through <b>vows of exaggeration [<i>havai</i>] are permitted;</b> items rendered forbidden through <b>oaths of exaggeration are forbidden.</b> Since oaths are very severe, one does not take an oath unless he intends it seriously. Therefore, it is not viewed as an oath of exaggeration.

### Part 5
The Gemara clarifies the details: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case of <b>oaths of exaggeration? If we say that</b> it is when one <b>said:</b> I take <b>an oath if I did not see on this road</b> as many people as those who ascended from Egypt, <b>is he saying anything?</b> This statement is not formulated in the form of an oath and therefore has no validity at all, even if he was serious.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye said that</b> in a case <b>where one says:</b> I take <b>an oath that I saw</b> on this road as many people as those who ascended from Egypt, the oath is valid. If he did not see that many people, he has taken a false oath. <b>Rava said to him: If so, why do I</b> need <b>to say</b> this; it is not a novelty? <b>And furthermore,</b> it <b>teaches</b> that the case of an oath is <b>similar to</b> that of <b>a vow:</b> Just as in the case of a vow he speaks of not seeing, so too with regard to an oath he must be speaking of not seeing. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> An oath of exaggeration is <b>where he says:</b> All the <b>produce of the world shall be forbidden to me by an oath if I did not see on this road</b> as many people <b>as those</b> who <b>ascended</b> from <b>Egypt.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: And perhaps this man saw an anthill and called them:</b> Those <b>who ascended</b> from <b>Egypt,</b> because the quantity of ants was so numerous, <b>and he took an oath properly.</b> Why, then, do we say that this is an oath taken in vain?
