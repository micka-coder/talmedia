### Part 1
<b>Are</b> these cases <b>comparable? Concerning</b> the case of <b>cold</b> water, the <b>righteous say little and do much.</b> Therefore, when the host says to the other: Enter my house and drink a drop of cold water, he intended to offer him an entire meal. So too, the one who vows is referring to an entire meal and not literally to a drop of water. Therefore, he may drink a bit of cold water in the host’s house.

### Part 2
But <b>here it is uncertain. Perhaps</b> when the seller <b>says</b> he will only accept more than a <i>sela</i>, he really intends to accept <b>less than a <i>sela</i>, and</b> when the buyer says he will not pay more than a shekel, he really intends to pay <b>more than a shekel; and</b> this <b>is</b> also <b>an exhortation</b> vow. <b>Or, perhaps he meant specifically</b> what he said, <b>and it is a vow,</b> because he did not intend to compromise on the price. The Gemara concludes: <b>The dilemma remains</b> unresolved.

### Part 3
§ <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav Asi said: These four vows</b> that are taught in the mishna still <b>require a request</b> made <b>to a halakhic authority</b> to dissolve them. Rav Yehuda continues: <b>When I said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>before Shmuel, he said: The <i>tanna</i> teaches</b> that <b>the Sages dissolved four vows, and you say they require a request</b> made <b>to a halakhic authority?</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yosef taught this <i>halakha</i> in this manner: Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav Asi said: A halakhic authority is able to dissolve only</b> a vow that is <b>similar to these four vows</b> in that it was not intended to be a vow at all but was simply expressed in the language of a vow. In addition, he can dissolve a vow taken by mistake. The Gemara comments: It can be derived from here that <b>he holds that</b> a halakhic authority <b>does not broach</b> dissolution based <b>on regret.</b> A halakhic authority must search for a factor that, had the one making the vow been aware of it at the time of the vow, he would not have vowed. Simply expressing regret about the vow is an insufficient basis on which to dissolve it.

### Part 5
The Gemara relates an incident that illustrates a different opinion concerning broaching dissolution based on regret. There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who came before Rav Huna</b> to request dissolution of a vow. Rav Huna <b>said to him: Is your heart upon you?</b> Do you still have the same desire that you had when you made the vow? <b>He said to him: No. And</b> Rav Huna <b>dissolved</b> the vow <b>for him.</b> Since Rav Huna dissolved the vow based on regret alone, he evidently holds that one may broach dissolution based on regret.

### Part 6
Similarly, there was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who came before Rabba bar Rav Huna</b> to dissolve his vow. Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>said to him: Had there been ten people who</b> could have <b>appeased you at the time</b> you vowed, <b>would you have made the vow? He said to him: No. And he dissolved</b> the vow <b>for him.</b>

### Part 7
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The halakhic authorities who dissolve the vow <b>say to the person</b> who vowed: <b>Is this heart,</b> i.e., this desire, still <b>upon you? If he says no, they dissolve it. Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, says in the name of his father: They say to the person</b> who vowed: <b>Had there been ten people who</b> could have <b>appeased you at the time, would you have made the vow? If he says no, they dissolve it.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara prefaces the next discussion with <b>a mnemonic</b> device: <b>Asi and Elazar, Yoḥanan and Yannai.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who came before Rabbi Asi</b> to request dissolution of a vow. Rabbi Asi <b>said to him: Do you have regret? He said to him</b> rhetorically: <b>No,</b> do I not have regret? In other words, certainly I have regret. <b>And he dissolved</b> the vow <b>for him.</b> Similarly, there was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who came before Rabbi Elazar,</b> and Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: Did you want to vow?</b> Was this really your desire? <b>He said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>If they had not angered me, I would not have wanted anything. He said to him: Let it be like you want,</b> and the vow is dissolved. In another instance, there was <b>a certain woman who took a vow with regard to her daughter</b> that the daughter may not benefit from her, and she <b>came before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> to dissolve the vow. <b>He said to her: Had you known that your neighbors would say about your daughter:</b>
