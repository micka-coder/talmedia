### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The practice of Torah scholars</b> is to ensure that a woman about to be married should not be encumbered by any vows. A father, <b>before his daughter would leave him</b> through marriage, <b>would say to her: All vows that you vowed in my house are hereby nullified. And similarly, the husband, before she would enter his jurisdiction,</b> i.e., while they were still betrothed, <b>would say to her: All vows that you vowed before you entered my jurisdiction are hereby nullified.</b> This was necessary <b>because once she enters his jurisdiction he cannot nullify</b> the vows she made before that.

### Part 2
gemara <b>Rami bar Ḥama asks:</b> Concerning <b>a husband, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard</b> to his <b>nullifying</b> a vow <b>without hearing</b> it? In other words, can a husband state a general nullification of his wife’s vows without being aware of any particular vow? When the verse states: <b>“And her husband hears</b> it, on the day that he hears it, and holds his peace at her, then her vows shall be ratified” (Numbers 30:8), <b>is</b> that referring <b>specifically</b> to a situation where he actually heard of a vow, and only then he can nullify it? <b>Or is</b> it <b>not specifically</b> referring to such a situation, and the mention of hearing is merely because the ordinary situation is that the husband nullifies a vow once he hears it?

### Part 3
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the mishna: <b>The practice of Torah scholars</b> is that a father, <b>before his daughter would leave him</b> through marriage, <b>would say to her: All vows that you vowed in my house are hereby nullified.</b> Rava points out: <b>But</b> the father <b>did not hear</b> her vows, so it must be that one can nullify vows without knowledge that they were actually made.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this conclusion: The mishna means that the father states a preemptive nullification that <b>when he</b> will <b>hear</b> a particular vow <b>is when he nullifies</b> it. The vow is not actually nullified until he hears it. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, when he has not</b> actually <b>heard</b> those vows yet, <b>why</b> is it necessary <b>for him to state</b> preemptively that the vows will be nullified; why not wait until he actually hears the vow? The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us</b> that it is <b>the practice of a Torah scholar to pursue</b> such matters, in order to prompt his daughter or his betrothed to inform him of vows she took, which will then be nullified when he hears of them.

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear from the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And similarly, the husband, before she would enter his jurisdiction,</b> i.e., while they were still betrothed, <b>would say to her:</b> All vows that you vowed before you entered my jurisdiction are hereby nullified. This implies that he can nullify vows without hearing them. The Gemara responds: <b>Here too,</b> it means <b>that he says to her: When I hear</b> the particular vow, then it will be nullified.

### Part 6
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another mishna to answer the question (<i>Nedarim</i> 75a): <b>One who says to his wife: All vows that you vow until I arrive from such and such a place are hereby ratified, has not said anything,</b> i.e., the vows are not ratified. If he says: All vows that you vow until then <b>are hereby nullified, Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> They are <b>nullified.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>But he did not</b> actually <b>hear</b> the particular vows, so one can infer from this that he need not hear her vows in order to nullify them.

### Part 7
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Here too,</b> one can understand the situation to be <b>that he says: When I hear</b> the particular vow, it will be nullified. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need, i.e., why must the husband state his nullification, <b>from now; let him nullify</b> them <b>for her when he</b> actually <b>hears</b> them. The Gemara answers: <b>He reasons: Perhaps I will be preoccupied at that moment</b> and will forget to nullify them. He therefore nullifies the vows beforehand, so that the nullification will take effect automatically when he hears them.

### Part 8
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who says to a steward [<i>apotropos</i>]</b> appointed to manage his affairs in his absence: <b>All vows that my wife vows from now until I arrive from such and such a place</b> you should <b>nullify, and</b> the steward <b>nullified</b> the vows for <b>her,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would be nullified.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Her husband may ratify it, or her husband may nullify it”</b> (Numbers 30:14). The repetition of “her husband” teaches that it is the husband alone who may nullify his wife’s vows; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Yonatan said to him: We have found everywhere in the Torah</b> that the legal status of <b>a person’s agent is like</b> that of <b>himself.</b> Therefore, a steward can nullify the vows on the husband’s behalf.

### Part 10
The Gemara points out: <b>And even Rabbi Yoshiya says</b> that a steward cannot nullify the wife’s vows <b>only because it is a Torah edict,</b> based upon the words <b>“her husband may ratify it, or her husband may nullify it”</b> (Numbers 30:14). <b>But</b> according <b>to everyone,</b> the principle that the legal status of <b>a person’s agent is like</b> that of <b>himself</b> is generally valid. The only objection to the steward nullifying the vows is the Torah edict. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> these vows <b>were not heard by</b> the steward? This indicates that not having heard the vows is not an obstacle to nullification.
