<b>in</b> a side <b>room [<i>kitona</i>] of the study hall,</b> while <b>standing, alone and at night.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabba said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one can request</b> the dissolution of <b>vows</b> even when the halakhic authority is <b>standing</b> or <b>alone,</b> i.e., without a court of three, as long as he is a halakhic authority, <b>and</b> that one can do so <b>at night, on Shabbat, and by relatives, and even</b> when <b>those</b> requesting dissolution on Shabbat <b>had the opportunity</b> to do so <b>while it was still day,</b> i.e., before Shabbat.

### Part 3
The Gemara raises a difficulty with this ruling: Can a judge dissolve a vow while <b>standing? But it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Gamliel alighted from a donkey, and wrapped himself</b> in his shawl in the customary manner of a judge, <b>and sat, and dissolved</b> a man’s <b>vow for him.</b> If one can dissolve a vow while standing, why did he sit? The Gemara explains: <b>Rabban Gamliel holds</b> that one must <b>broach</b> dissolution based <b>on regret.</b> In other words, a halakhic authority does not dissolve vows directly, but must prompt the one who took the vow to concede that he regrets having taken the vow in the first place. <b>We require that the vow be uprooted, and he needed to examine</b> the case; <b>therefore, he sat down. But Rav Naḥman holds</b> that one need <b>not broach</b> dissolution based <b>on regret, and</b> therefore a halakhic authority can dissolve the vow <b>even</b> while <b>standing.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: Master, see that Sage who came from the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>and</b> who <b>said: The Sages attended to</b> the dissolution of a vow taken by <b>the son of Rav Huna bar Avin, and they dissolved his vow and said to him: Go and request mercy for yourself, for you have sinned</b> by taking a vow. <b>As Rav Dimi, the brother of Rav Safra teaches:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who takes a vow, even if he fulfills it, he is called a sinner. Rav Zevid said: What verse</b> teaches this? It is: <b>“But if you refrain to vow, it will be no sin in you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:23). It may be inferred <b>that</b> if <b>you did not refrain</b> from taking vows, <b>there is sin.</b>

### Part 5
§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who says to his wife: Any vows which you will vow, I do not want [<i>ee efshi</i>] you to vow,</b> or one who wants to nullify a vow and says: <b>This is not a vow, has not said anything,</b> as this is not a valid formula of nullification. If he says: <b>You have done well,</b> or: <b>There are none like you,</b> or: <b>If you had not taken a vow, I, myself, would have taken a vow</b> to obligate <b>you</b> in this, <b>his statement is substantial,</b> and the vow is ratified.

### Part 6
<b>A man should not say to his wife</b> when nullifying her vows <b>on Shabbat: It is nullified for you,</b> or: <b>It is canceled for you, in the manner that he would say to her on weekdays. Rather, he should say to her,</b> if she took a vow to refrain from food or drink: <b>Take</b> this <b>and eat</b> it,or: <b>Take</b> this <b>and drink</b> it, <b>and the vow is canceled on its own. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And he must</b> also <b>cancel</b> the vow <b>in his heart;</b> simply telling her to eat or drink is not sufficient.

### Part 7
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say: On Shabbat he cancels</b> the vow <b>in his heart</b> and <b>on a weekday he articulates</b> the nullification <b>with his lips. And Beit Hillel say: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, i.e., whether on Shabbat or a weekday, it is sufficient if <b>he cancels</b> the vow <b>in his heart, and he need not articulate with his lips.</b>

### Part 8
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A halakhic authority who pronounced</b> his dissolution of a vow <b>with language</b> appropriate to <b>a husband,</b> i.e., he said the word nullified instead of dissolved, <b>or a husband who pronounced</b> his nullification of a vow <b>with language</b> appropriate to <b>a halakhic authority,</b> i.e., he said the word dissolved instead of nullified, <b>has not said anything.</b> Each of them has the authority to cancel a vow only in the particular manner allotted to him.

### Part 9
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse <b>“This is the thing</b> which the Lord has commanded” (Numbers 30:2) indicates that the husband’s nullification, which is the topic of the subsequent verses, must be done specifically in this way. The Sages concluded that <b>a halakhic authority dissolves</b> a vow, <b>but a husband does not dissolve</b> it. <b>As,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>And just as a halakhic authority, who cannot nullify</b> vows, nevertheless <b>dissolves</b> them, so too with regard to <b>a husband, who can nullify</b> vows, <b>is it not logical that he should</b> also <b>dissolve</b> them? Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b>
