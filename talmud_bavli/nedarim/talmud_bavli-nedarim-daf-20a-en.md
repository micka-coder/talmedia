### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who <b>took a vow</b> by associating an item <b>with a dedication [<i>ḥerem</i>],</b> saying: This item is hereby forbidden to me like an item dedicated to the Temple, <b>and</b> then <b>said: I took a vow only with</b> the intention that it would be like <b>a sea net [<i>ḥermo shel yam</i>]</b> that is used to catch fish; or one who took a vow by associating an item <b>with an offering, and</b> then <b>said: I took a vow only with</b> reference to <b>offerings to kings,</b> i.e., a gift for a king, not an offering to God.

### Part 2
Or one who said: <b>I am hereby an offering myself [<i>atzmi</i>], and</b> then <b>said: I took a vow only with</b> reference to <b>a bone [<i>etzem</i>] that I set aside for myself to vow with,</b> as <i>atzmi</i> means both myself and my bone, i.e., he set aside a bone so as to pretend to take a vow upon himself; or one who said: <b>Deriving benefit from me is <i>konam</i> for my wife, and</b> then <b>said: I took a vow only with regard to my first wife whom I divorced,</b> not with regard to my current wife.

### Part 3
<b>For all</b> of the above vows, those who took them <b>do not</b> need to <b>request</b> of a halakhic authority to dissolve <b>them,</b> as the speaker interpreted the vows in a manner that caused them not to take effect at all. <b>However, if they requested</b> dissolution, apparently due to their being uncertain of their explanations, the court <b>punishes them and treats them stringently</b> and the vows are not dissolved. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> These vows are not treated stringently. Rather, dissolution <b>is broached with them by</b> suggesting <b>a different extenuation,</b> i.e., the halakhic authority suggests extenuating circumstances that undermine the vow but do not pertain to its wording. <b>And we teach them</b> that they should not take this kind of vow in the future, <b>in order that they will not take vows lightly.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>This</b> matter <b>is itself difficult.</b> On the one hand, <b>you said they do not</b> need to <b>request</b> to dissolve <b>them, and then it is taught</b> that <b>if they requested</b> dissolution, the court <b>punishes them and treats them stringently,</b> i.e., the vows took effect and the vows are not dissolved.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is teaching: All of these</b> vows <b>do not need a request.</b> However, <b>in what</b> case <b>is this statement said? In</b> the case of <b>a Torah scholar,</b> who knows that these vows do not take effect, and he obviously did not intend for them to take effect in the first place. <b>How-ever,</b> in the case of <b>an ignoramus who comes to request</b> dissolution of the vow, the court <b>punishes him and treats him stringently.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the court <b>treats</b> him <b>stringently</b> in <b>that</b> the halakhic authorities <b>do not broach</b> dissolution <b>with him</b> merely <b>by means of regret;</b> rather, extenuating circumstances must be found. <b>However, what are the circumstances</b> in which the court <b>punishes</b> him?

### Part 8
The Gemara answers that the circumstances are <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who vowed to be a nazirite and violated his naziriteship,</b> the halakhic authority <b>does not attend to him</b> to dissolve his vow <b>until he observes</b> the <b>prohibitions</b> of naziriteship <b>for the same</b> number of <b>days in which he behaved with permissiveness</b> concerning the restrictions of a nazirite. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that he must observe naziriteship for a period of time corresponding to his vow, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>in</b> the case of <b>a short</b> term of <b>naziriteship,</b> which is not longer than the minimum thirty days. <b>However, in</b> the case of a <b>long</b> term of <b>naziriteship it is enough for him</b> to observe it for <b>thirty days,</b> even if he violated it for a greater number of days. This explains the punishment mentioned in the mishna: An ignoramus who requests the dissolution of his vow must first observe the vow for a certain period of time.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Yosef said: Since the Sages say</b> that the halakhic authority <b>does not attend to him, a court that does attend</b> to him and dissolves his vow immediately <b>is not acting properly. Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov says:</b> A halakhic authority who dissolves the vow prematurely <b>is excommunicated.</b>

### Part 10
§ It is stated in the mishna that <b>the Rabbis say:</b> Dissolution <b>is broached with him</b> by suggesting a different <b>extenuation,</b> and he is taught not to take this kind of vow so that he will not take vows lightly. It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Never be accustomed to</b> taking <b>vows, because ultimately you will</b> disregard them, and you will even <b>abuse oaths,</b> which are more grave. <b>And do not regularly be around an ignoramus, because ultimately he will feed you untithed produce,</b> as he is not careful to tithe. <b>Do not regularly be by an ignorant priest, because ultimately he will feed you <i>teruma</i></b> due to his close relationship with you, and <i>teruma</i> is forbidden to a non-priest. <b>And do not talk extensively with a woman, because ultimately you will come to adultery.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rabbi Yoshiya, says: Anyone who watches women will ultimately come to sin, and anyone who looks at the heel of a woman will have indecent children</b> as a punishment. <b>Rav Yosef said: And</b> this <b>relates to</b> all women, including <b>his wife</b> when she has the status of <b>a menstruating woman. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: The heel</b> of a woman <b>that is mentioned</b> is not the heel of the foot, but <b>the place of uncleanliness,</b> i.e., the genitalia, and it is called a heel as a euphemism, <b>as it is situated opposite the heel.</b>

### Part 12
§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“That His fear may be upon your faces”</b> (Exodus 20:17); <b>this</b> is referring to <b>shame,</b> as shame causes one to blush. <b>“That you not sin”</b> (Exodus 20:17) <b>teaches that shame leads to fear of sin. From here</b> the Sages <b>said: It is a good sign in a person that he is one who experiences shame. Others say: Any person who experiences shame will not quickly sin, and</b> conversely, <b>one who does not have</b> the capacity to be <b>shamefaced, it is known that his forefathers did not stand at Mount Sinai.</b>

### Part 13
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Dehavai said: The ministering angels told me four matters: For what</b> reason <b>do lame people come into existence?</b> It is <b>because</b> their fathers <b>overturn their tables,</b> i.e., they engage in sexual intercourse in an atypical way. <b>For what</b> reason <b>do mute people come into existence?</b> It is <b>because</b> their fathers <b>kiss that place</b> of nakedness. <b>For what</b> reason <b>do deaf people come into existence?</b> It is <b>because</b> their parents <b>converse while engaging in sexual intercourse. For what</b> reason <b>do blind people come into existence?</b> It is <b>because</b> their fathers <b>stare at that place.</b>

### Part 14
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction: Imma Shalom,</b> the wife of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, <b>was asked: For what</b> reason
