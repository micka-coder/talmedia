### Part 1
If <b>her father heard and nullified</b> the vow <b>for her, and the husband did not manage to hear</b> of the vow <b>before he died, the father may go back and nullify</b> the <b>husband’s portion,</b> and that will complete the nullification of her vow. <b>Rabbi Natan said: This</b> last ruling <b>is the statement of Beit Shammai,</b> but <b>Beit Hillel say</b> that <b>he cannot nullify</b> only the husband’s share of the vow but must also nullify his own share again.

### Part 2
Having completed its citation of the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara now states its proof: <b>Conclude from this</b> that, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> whoever nullifies the vow first completely <b>severs</b> his half of the vow, and therefore the father needed only to nullify the part left by the husband. However, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel,</b> his nullification <b>weakens</b> the general force of the vow, so the father’s subsequent nullification must address the whole vow. The Gemara rules: <b>Conclude from this</b> <i>baraita</i> that the husband’s nullification weakens the general force of the vow, as the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Beit Hillel.

### Part 3
§ <b>Rava raises a dilemma: Is there</b> the possibility of <b>a request</b> to a halakhic authority <b>about</b> dissolving the <b>ratification</b> of one’s wife’s vow, <b>or is there no</b> possibility of <b>a request</b> to a halakhic authority <b>about</b> dissolving his <b>ratification</b> of one’s wife’s vow? One might seek to dissolve one’s ratification if he now desires to nullify the vow. Furthermore, <b>if you say</b> that there is the possibility of <b>a request to</b> dissolve his <b>ratification, is there</b> the possibility of <b>a request</b> to a halakhic authority <b>about</b> dissolving <b>nullification</b> of his wife’s vow, to allow him to ratify the vow in place of nullifying it? <b>Or is there no</b> possibility of <b>a request to</b> dissolve the <b>nullification</b> of his wife’s vow?

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> A halakhic authority <b>may be requested to</b> dissolve <b>ratification</b> of one’s wife’s vow <b>but may not be requested to</b> dissolve <b>nullification.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabba asks:</b> If, after hearing one’s wife or one’s daughter’s vow, one said: <b>It is ratified for you, it is ratified for you, and</b> then a halakhic authority <b>was requested about the first ratification</b> and dissolved it, but one did not request dissolution of the second ratification, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the second ratification in force, or is it irrelevant, as it was performed on an vow that was already ratified and consequently never took effect?

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that <b>which Rava said</b> with regard to one who said: I take an oath that I will not eat, I take an oath that I will not eat: <b>If</b> a halakhic authority <b>was requested to</b> dissolve <b>the first</b> oath and dissolved it, the <b>second</b> oath <b>goes into effect for him.</b> Similarly, the second ratification goes into effect. <b>Rabba</b> further <b>asks:</b> If he said to her: The vow is <b>ratified for you and nullified for you, and the ratification will not take effect unless the nullification takes effect, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
