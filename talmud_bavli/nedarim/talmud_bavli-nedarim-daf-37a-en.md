### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us that even in a place where one takes payment</b> for teaching, <b>for</b> teaching <b>Bible</b> it is <b>permitted to take</b> payment, but <b>for</b> teaching <b>midrash</b> it is <b>not permitted to take</b> payment.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is midrash different</b> from Bible, <b>that</b> one may <b>not</b> take payment for teaching it? Based on that <b>which is written,</b> which Moses said to the people: <b>“And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you</b> statutes and laws” (Deuteronomy 4:14), <b>and</b> also that which <b>is written: “Behold, I have taught you statutes and laws, as the Lord</b> my God <b>commanded me,</b> that you should do so in the midst of the land where you go in to possess it” (Deuteronomy 4:5), God said: <b>Just as I</b> teach you <b>for free,</b> without payment, <b>so too you also</b> shall teach <b>for free.</b> There should be no difference between Bible and midrash, and <b>Bible too,</b> like midrash, should be taught <b>for free.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav said:</b> As Bible is typically taught to children, one who teaches Bible takes <b>payment</b> for <b>watching</b> the children. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> He takes <b>payment</b> for teaching <b>punctuation</b> of the text with <b>cantillation notes.</b>

### Part 4
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna that one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by a vow, that other person <b>may not teach him Bible. Granted, according to the one who says</b> that the <b>payment</b> is for teaching <b>punctuation</b> of the text with <b>cantillation notes, this is</b> the reason <b>that he shall not teach him Bible,</b> as teaching punctuation is a component of teaching the biblical text. <b>However, according to the one who says</b> it is <b>payment</b> for <b>watching</b> the students, <b>is an adult one who requires watching,</b> and would payment be taken for doing so? Since the teacher typically does not receive payment for teaching adults, there is no benefit when he teaches for free the one for whom benefit is forbidden; why, then, is it prohibited? The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>is teaching</b> about the case <b>of a minor</b> who requires watching and who is prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from the teacher.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is the case <b>of a minor, say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>However, he may teach his sons Bible. Is a minor one</b> who is <b>capable of</b> bearing <b>sons?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The mishna is incomplete, and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching: He may not teach him Bible, in</b> the case of <b>a minor. If</b> the student <b>is an adult, he may teach him and his sons Bible.</b> He may teach him because he does not require watching, and he may teach his son because the payment is for watching his son.

### Part 6
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Children may not read</b> a passage in the Bible <b>for the first</b> time <b>on Shabbat; however, they may review</b> a passage that they already learned <b>once. Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <b>payment</b> for teaching Bible is for teaching <b>punctuation</b> of the text with <b>cantillation notes, this is</b> the reason that <b>children may not read</b> a passage in the Bible <b>for the first</b> time <b>on Shabbat,</b> as it would be necessary to pay the teacher. <b>However, according to the one who says</b> it is <b>payment</b> for <b>watching</b> the children, <b>why may</b> children <b>not read</b> a passage in the Bible <b>for the first</b> time <b>on Shabbat? And why may</b> children <b>review</b> a passage that they already learned <b>once? Isn’t there payment</b> for <b>watching</b> the children <b>on Shabbat</b> in both cases?

### Part 7
The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning, is</b> receiving <b>payment</b> for teaching <b>punctuation prohibited on Shabbat? It is</b> a case of <b>incorporation</b> of the payment for teaching on Shabbat into the teacher’s weekly salary, <b>and incorporation is permitted, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who hires</b> a day <b>laborer to watch a child, to watch a cow,</b> or <b>to guard seeds does not give him payment for Shabbat. Therefore,</b>
