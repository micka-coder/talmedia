### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>They assumed: What is</b> the meaning of the term <b><i>laḥullin</i>?</b> The individual is saying: <b>It shall not [<i>la</i>] be non-sacred [<i>ḥullin</i>]</b> but <b>rather</b> it should have the status of an <b>offering.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara says: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna? If</b> you say it is that of <b>Rabbi Meir, he does not hold</b> that <b>from a negative</b> statement <b>you</b> can <b>infer a positive</b> statement. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that <b>any condition that is not like the condition of the sons of</b> the tribe of <b>Gad and the sons of</b> the tribe of <b>Reuben,</b> when Moses gave them land on the eastern bank of the Jordan River (see Numbers 32:29–30), <b>is not</b> a valid <b>condition.</b> Moses phrased the agreement as a double condition, stating that if they would join the other tribes in battle they would receive their inheritance on the eastern bank of the Jordan River, and if not, they would not receive that territory. Because Rabbi Meir holds that only a condition expressed in this manner is valid, it is clear that he holds that one may not infer a negative statement from a positive one or vice versa.

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The Gemara challenges this statement: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One who says</b> that an item shall be considered <b>Jerusalem has not said anything. From</b> the fact that the <b>latter clause is</b> stated by <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> it is clear that the <b>first clause is not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara responds: <b>The entire</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and this is what</b> it <b>is teaching:</b> Although one who declares an item to be like Jerusalem has taken a vow rendering it forbidden, one who says that an item shall be considered Jerusalem has not taken a vow. This is <b>as Rabbi Yehuda says,</b> that <b>one who says</b> that an item shall be considered <b>Jerusalem has not said anything,</b> since this expression has no meaning.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>When</b> one <b>says</b> that an item should be <b>like Jerusalem, is it prohibited according to Rabbi Yehuda? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One who says</b> that an item shall be considered <b>like Jerusalem has not said anything unless he vows by means of an item that is sacrificed in Jerusalem.</b> Consequently, the first clause of the mishna, which states that one has vowed if he declares an item to be like Jerusalem, cannot be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.

### Part 6
The Gemara responds: <b>The entire</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> the mishna and <i>baraita</i> express the opinions of <b>two <i>tanna’im</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
