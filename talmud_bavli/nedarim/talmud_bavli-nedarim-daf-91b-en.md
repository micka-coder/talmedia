### Part 1
<b>aloe merchants [<i>ahaloyei</i>] who were here</b> just <b>now</b> should be blamed; <b>if</b> it was <b>not you, perhaps</b> it was one <b>of them.</b> The case came before <b>Rav Naḥman,</b> who <b>said:</b> There is reason to suspect that <b>she might have cast her eyes upon another</b> man, <b>and</b> therefore <b>there is no substance to her words.</b> She lacks credibility and her statement is unreliable, and so she remains permitted to her husband.

### Part 2
It is further related that there was <b>a certain woman who was displeased with</b> her <b>man. He said to her: What is different now?</b> What have I done to make you angry? <b>She said to him:</b> I am upset because <b>you never hurt me</b> while we were engaged <b>in proper relations as</b> you did just <b>now. He said to her: This matter did not occur now. She said to him: If so,</b> it may be that <b>one of</b> the <b>gentile oil merchants [<i>naftoyei</i>] who were here</b> just <b>now</b> should be blamed; <b>if</b> it was <b>not you, perhaps</b> it was one <b>of them. Rav Naḥman said to them: Take no notice of her; she has cast her eyes upon another</b> man, and her words are therefore unreliable.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates another incident about <b>a certain man who was secluding</b> himself <b>[<i>meharzeik</i>] in a house, he and a</b> certain married <b>woman.</b> When <b>the owner of the house entered, the adulterer burst through the wall of palm branches and fled. Rava said: The woman is permitted</b> to her husband. The assumption is that she did not sin, for <b>if it is so that</b> the man <b>had committed a transgression, he would have hidden</b> himself in the house instead of revealing his identity by escaping in the open.

### Part 4
The Gemara concludes with one final incident about <b>a certain adulterer who entered</b> the house <b>of a certain</b> married <b>woman.</b> When <b>the man,</b> i.e., her husband, <b>came</b> home, the <b>adulterer went and sat himself behind the door,</b> so that the husband would not know that he was there. <b>There was</b> some <b>cress [<i>taḥlei</i>] lying there</b> in the house, <b>and</b> the adulterer, but not the husband, saw that <b>a snake</b> had come and <b>tasted of it,</b> perhaps thereby contaminating it with its venom. <b>The master of the house wanted to eat from that cress, without the woman’s knowledge. The adulterer said to him: Do not eat from</b> the cress, <b>as a snake has tasted of it.</b>

### Part 5
The case was brought before <b>Rava,</b> who <b>said: His wife is permitted</b> to him, for <b>were it so that</b> the adulterer <b>had committed a transgression, it would have been preferable for him that</b> the husband should <b>eat</b> the cress <b>and die.</b> This is because one who commits adultery is also suspected of bloodshed, <b>as it is written: “For they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands”</b> (Ezekiel 23:45), indicating that adultery leads to murder.

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: It <b>is obvious</b> that this is the case. What then does Rava come to teach us? The Gemara answers: Rava’s ruling is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that the man did in fact <b>commit a transgression</b> with the other man’s wife, <b>and</b> the reason <b>that he said to</b> the husband that he should not eat and saved his life is <b>because it is preferable for him that the husband should not die.</b> This is in order <b>that his wife should be to him</b> as it says in the verse: <b>“Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant”</b> (Proverbs 9:17). That is to say, a person derives greater pleasure from forbidden fruit. Rava therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not a concern. Rather, the assumption is that he had not yet actually sinned and therefore acted in the proper manner.
