### Part 1
<b>in</b> a position of <b>uncertainty, and Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b>a person does place himself in</b> a position of <b>uncertainty?</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the following mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 64b): In the case of <b>one who has two groups</b> of two <b>daughters</b> born to him <b>from two women,</b> e.g., he has two daughters from his first wife, and after his first wife died he remarried and had two daughters with his second wife, <b>and he said: I betrothed my older daughter</b> to someone, <b>but I do not know if</b> I meant the <b>older of the older</b> group of daughters; or <b>if</b> I meant <b>the older</b> daughter <b>of the younger</b> group; <b>or if</b> I meant the <b>younger</b> daughter <b>of the older</b> group, <b>who is</b> nevertheless <b>older than the older</b> daughter <b>of the younger</b> group, then <b>all</b> three of those daughters <b>are prohibited</b> to marry another man due to the uncertainty, as he failed to clarify which daughter was betrothed. This applies to all the daughters <b>apart from the younger</b> daughter <b>of the younger</b> group, who is certainly not betrothed. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: They are all permitted</b> to marry, <b>apart from the older</b> daughter <b>of the older</b> group. This demonstrates that according to Rabbi Meir, one must take into account any of the possible meanings of the imprecise expression: My older daughter, whereas Rabbi Yosei maintains that only the narrowest possible meaning of the phrase is taken into account. This contradicts the mishna here.

### Part 4
In response to this question, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Avdimi said</b> that <b>Rav said: The</b> attribution of the <b>opinions is reversed,</b> i.e., the views stated in the mishna here must be reversed in order to reconcile them with the mishna in <i>Kiddushin</i>. <b>And it is</b> indeed <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>this is the principle:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> vow which specifies <b>a fixed time,</b> i.e., an event that occurs on a particular date, and one <b>said</b> that the vow applies <b>until before</b> that event, <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> the vow applies <b>until</b> the event <b>ends, and Rabbi Yosei says</b> that the vow is in effect only <b>until</b> the event <b>arrives.</b> This is another proof that the opinions in the mishna here must be reversed.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one takes a vow that something is forbidden to him <b>until the grain harvest,</b> or <b>until the grape harvest,</b> or <b>until the olive harvest, it is forbidden</b> to him <b>only until the arrival</b> of that season. <b>This is the principle:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> occasion <b>whose time is fixed, and one said: Until it arrives,</b> it is <b>forbidden</b> to him <b>until</b> the specified occasion <b>arrives.</b> If he <b>said: Until it will be,</b> it is <b>forbidden</b> to him <b>until</b> the specified occasion <b>ends. And</b> with regard to <b>any</b> occasion <b>whose time is not fixed,</b> i.e., it does not fall on a precise date, <b>whether he said: Until it will be,</b> or: <b>Until it arrives,</b> it is <b>forbidden</b> to him <b>only until</b> the specified occasion <b>arrives.</b>

### Part 6
If he said: <b>Until the summer [<i>kayitz</i>],</b> or: <b>Until it will be summer,</b> the vow remains in effect <b>until the people begin to bring</b> fruit <b>into</b> their houses <b>in baskets.</b> If he said: <b>Until the summer has passed,</b> the vow remains in effect <b>until</b> the people <b>set aside [<i>yakpilu</i>] the knives</b> [<b><i>hamaktzuot</i></b>] with which the figs are cut after being harvested, and return them to their place of storage.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sage <b>taught:</b> The <b>basket</b> about which <b>they spoke</b> in the mishna is <b>a basket of figs, and not a basket of grapes,</b> which are gathered later than figs. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who vows</b> that <b>summer [<i>kayitz</i>] produce</b> is forbidden <b>to</b> him <b>is prohibited</b> from partaking <b>only</b> of <b>figs,</b> as the fig harvest is called <i>kayitz</i>. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Grapes are included</b> in the category of the summer produce, along <b>with figs.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of the first <i>tanna</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: He <b>holds</b> that since <b>figs are plucked [<i>mikkatzetzan</i>] by hand,</b> while <b>grapes are plucked not by hand</b> but with tools, it is only figs that are considered summer [<i>kayitz</i>] produce. Conversely, <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds</b> that <b>grapes, too, when they are</b> sufficiently <b>ripe, are plucked by hand.</b> Therefore, they can be considered summer produce as well.

### Part 9
§ The mishna states that if one said: <b>Until the summer has passed,</b> then the vow remains in effect <b>until</b> the people <b>set aside the knives</b> used to cut the figs. It was <b>taught:</b> This means <b>until most</b> people <b>set aside</b> their <b>knives,</b> even if there are still some individuals who have yet to do so.
