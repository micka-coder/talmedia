<b>if their leaves were black,</b> the onions are <b>forbidden.</b> If their leaves <b>turned green,</b> the onions are <b>permitted. And if</b> the leaves <b>are black, why</b> are the onions <b>forbidden? Let us say</b> in this case too: <b>The permitted part,</b> the original onion, <b>to where did it go?</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Rabba: <b>Do you maintain</b> that this <i>halakha</i> <b>is taught about the primary,</b> original onion, that it is prohibited? It <b>is taught with regard to the additional</b> growth that sprouted, and it is those leaves that <b>are forbidden.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what is Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> who apparently disagrees with the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna, <b>coming to say? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: That which grew during</b> a period of <b>liability is liable</b> and is considered Sabbatical-Year produce, and that <b>which grew during</b> a period of <b>exemption is exempt.</b> According to Rav Ḥisda’s explanation, <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> cited in the mishna, <b>also said that.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara explains: This is not difficult, as this <b>entire mishna, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel taught it.</b> In the <i>baraita</i> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is not disagreeing with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> of the mishna; he is merely restating it. <b>And</b> nevertheless, the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> pose no difficulty with regard to the opinion of Rabba, as <b>you heard that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> said that the prohibition of the primary, original part is not neutralized <b>only</b> in a case where <b>he did not exert</b> himself, and the leaves sprouted on their own. <b>However,</b> in the case <b>where he exerted</b> himself, e.g., by sowing or planting, the prohibition of the original onions is <b>neutralized by the majority.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And anywhere that one exerts</b> himself, <b>is</b> the original part <b>nullified by the majority?</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> isn’t there the case of one who sowed <b>a <i>litra</i> of untithed tithe,</b> where <b>he exerts</b> himself to sow it, <b>and it is taught: And that</b> original <b><i>litra</i></b> of untithed first tithe that he sowed, one <b>proportionally tithes for it from</b> produce in <b>a different place,</b> and its prohibition is not neutralized by the growth. The Gemara answers: It <b>is different with regard to tithe, as the verse states: “You shall tithe</b> all the produce of your seed that is brought forth in the field” (Deuteronomy 14:22), indicating that all permitted seeds that are sown must be tithed, since <b>permitted</b> seeds that were tithed, <b>people</b> typically <b>sow. Forbidden</b> seeds that were not tithed, <b>people do not</b> typically <b>sow,</b> but the Sages penalized one who sowed untithed seeds and required him to tithe that which he was originally obligated to tithe and decreed that it is not neutralized by the majority.

### Part 4
§ With regard to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself, Rabbi Ḥanina Tirta’a said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai said:</b> With regard to <b>an onion of <i>teruma</i> that one planted,</b> if <b>its growths exceeded its principal,</b> it <b>is permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that growths</b> that are
