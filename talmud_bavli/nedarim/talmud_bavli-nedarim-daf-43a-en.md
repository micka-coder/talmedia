### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Granted</b> that the person from whom benefit is forbidden <b>may not lend</b> money <b>to</b> the person for whom benefit is forbidden, <b>as he</b> thereby <b>benefits him. However,</b> with regard to the fact that the former <b>may not borrow</b> money <b>from</b> the latter, in <b>what</b> way <b>does he benefit him</b> by borrowing his money? <b>And</b> it could even be said, <b>granted</b> that <b>he may neither borrow</b> money <b>from him nor purchase</b> an item <b>from him, as one benefits</b> in lending money by preserving the value of that money in case the coins deteriorate, and in selling by ridding oneself an item that is difficult to sell. <b>However,</b> with regard to the fact that the person from whom benefit is forbidden <b>may not borrow</b> an item <b>from</b> the person for whom benefit is forbidden, in <b>what</b> way <b>does</b> the lender <b>benefit from him?</b> The borrower returns the same item to the lender.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where they</b> both <b>vowed</b> that <b>benefit from each other</b> is forbidden. Clearly, then, neither of them may lend to the other or borrow from him. <b>Abaye said:</b> It is possible to explain the mishna as it is written, as referring to a case where only one vowed that benefit from the other is forbidden. However, the Sages issued <b>a decree</b> that it is also prohibited for one <b>to borrow</b> from a person for whom benefit from him is forbidden, <b>due to</b> the concern that he might come <b>to lend</b> to him, as reciprocity is common in these matters. <b>And likewise,</b> that is the explanation <b>in all</b> the cases in the mishna; it is prohibited to borrow money, borrow items, and to purchase items from him due to a rabbinic <b>decree,</b> lest he come to benefit him.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One said to</b> another: <b>Lend me your cow.</b> The other person <b>said to him:</b> My cow <b>is not available.</b> The one seeking to borrow the cow responded angrily: <b>Plowing my field with</b> this cow <b>is <i>konam</i> forever. If it was his</b> typical <b>manner to plow</b> the field himself, then it is <b>prohibited</b> for <b>him</b> to plow his field with that cow <b>but</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for <b>every</b> other <b>person. If it is not his</b> typical <b>manner to plow</b> the field himself, and he has others plow for him, it is <b>prohibited</b> for <b>him and</b> for <b>every</b> other <b>person</b> to plow his field with that cow, because his intent was to render benefit from plowing with this cow forbidden.

### Part 4
In the case of <b>one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow and</b> who <b>does not have anything to eat,</b> the one from whom benefit is forbidden <b>goes to the shopkeeper and says</b> to him: <b>So-and-so vowed that benefit from me is forbidden</b> for him <b>and I do not know what I will do.</b> After grasping his intent, the shopkeeper <b>gives</b> food <b>to</b> the one for whom benefit is forbidden, <b>and</b> then the shopkeeper <b>comes and takes</b> payment for the food <b>from that</b> one who spoke to him.

### Part 5
Similarly, if the <b>house</b> of one for whom benefit is forbidden by a vow <b>was to be built, his fence to be erected,</b> or <b>his field to be harvested,</b> and laborers were required but he had no money to hire them, the one from whom benefit is forbidden <b>goes to the laborers and says</b> to them: <b>Benefit from me is forbidden by vow to so-and-so and I do not know what I will do. And</b> the laborers <b>perform</b> those tasks <b>with him, and come and take payment</b> for their labor <b>from that</b> person who approached them.

### Part 6
<b>If</b> the one who vowed to render benefit from him forbidden and the one for whom benefit is forbidden <b>were traveling</b> together <b>along the road and</b> the one for whom benefit is forbidden <b>does not have anything to eat,</b> the one who from whom benefit is forbidden <b>gives</b> food <b>to one</b> other person <b>as a gift, and</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for <b>that</b> person for whom benefit is forbidden to eat the food because it no longer belongs to the one from whom benefit is forbidden. <b>If there is no other</b> person <b>with them,</b> the one who vowed <b>places</b> the food <b>on the</b> nearest <b>rock or on the</b> nearest <b>fence and says: These</b> food items <b>are hereby rendered ownerless</b> and are available <b>to anyone who wants</b> them. Then <b>that</b> person for whom benefit is forbidden <b>takes and eats</b> the food. <b>Rabbi Yosei prohibits</b> doing so.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yosei whether one from whom benefit is forbidden to another can give the other person food by declaring the food ownerless, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei? He holds</b> that the legal status of the process of rendering property <b>ownerless</b> is <b>like</b> that of the acquisition of <b>a gift. Just as</b> acquisition of <b>a gift</b> is not complete <b>until</b> the item <b>comes from the possession of</b> the <b>one</b> who <b>gives</b> the gift <b>into the possession of</b> the <b>one</b> who <b>receives</b> the gift, <b>so too,</b> the process of rendering property <b>ownerless</b> is not complete <b>until</b> the item <b>comes into the possession of</b> the <b>one</b> who <b>acquires</b> it. According to Rabbi Yosei, it is prohibited for the one for whom benefit is forbidden to take the food that was declared ownerless. Since it still belongs to the one from whom benefit is forbidden, by taking the food he derives forbidden benefit from him.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Abba raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> then <b>that</b> person <b>takes and eats</b> the food; <b>and Rabbi Yosei prohibits</b> doing so. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: When</b> is it prohibited to do so? <b>When his vow predates his</b> declaration that the food is <b>ownerless.</b> In that case, the vow took effect on all his possessions, including those that he later declared ownerless.
