<b>permitted neutralize the prohibition? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>The growths of <i>teruma</i> are <i>teruma</i>,</b> indicating that they do not neutralize the prohibition of the original part of the plant? The Gemara answers: <b>We are speaking of the growths of growths.</b> Rabbi Yannai permits the <i>teruma</i>, not due to the majority of direct growths of <i>teruma</i>; he permitted it due to the majority of growths that sprouted from its growths. The Gemara asks: <b>We</b> already <b>learned that too: The</b> status of <b>growths of growths</b> of <i>teruma</i> is that of <b>non-sacred</b> produce. The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us</b> that the growths of growths are permitted <b>even in items whose seeds do not cease,</b> e.g., onions.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>untithed produce, its growths are permitted in items whose seeds cease; however,</b> concerning <b>items whose seeds do not cease, the growths of growths are forbidden.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It teaches us that</b> if <b>the increase of the growths</b> of growths <b>exceeded its primary,</b> original part, that original part is <b>permitted.</b>
