<b>permitted neutralize the prohibition? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>The growths of <i>teruma</i> are <i>teruma</i>,</b> indicating that they do not neutralize the prohibition of the original part of the plant? The Gemara answers: <b>We are speaking of the growths of growths.</b> Rabbi Yannai permits the <i>teruma</i>, not due to the majority of direct growths of <i>teruma</i>; he permitted it due to the majority of growths that sprouted from its growths. The Gemara asks: <b>We</b> already <b>learned that too: The</b> status of <b>growths of growths</b> of <i>teruma</i> is that of <b>non-sacred</b> produce. The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us</b> that the growths of growths are permitted <b>even in items whose seeds do not cease,</b> e.g., onions.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>untithed produce, its growths are permitted in items whose seeds cease; however,</b> concerning <b>items whose seeds do not cease, the growths of growths are forbidden.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It teaches us that</b> if <b>the increase of the growths</b> of growths <b>exceeded its primary,</b> original part, that original part is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one vows: <b>Wine is</b> forbidden to me <b>as if</b> it were <b>an offering [<i>konam</i>],</b> and for <b>that</b> reason <b>I</b> will not <b>taste</b> it <b>today,</b> he is <b>prohibited</b> from drinking wine <b>only until</b> the conclusion of that day at <b>nightfall,</b> and not for a twenty-four hour period. If one vows not to drink wine <b>this week,</b> he is <b>prohibited</b> from drinking wine <b>for the entire</b> remainder of the <b>week. And</b> as <b>Shabbat</b> is considered part of the week <b>that passed,</b> i.e., it is the end of the week, he is prohibited from drinking wine on the upcoming Shabbat. If one vows not to drink wine <b>this month,</b> wine is <b>forbidden</b> to him <b>for the entire</b> remainder of the <b>month; and</b> as <b>the New Moon</b> of the following month is considered part <b>of the next</b> month, he is permitted to drink wine on that day.

### Part 5
If he vowed not to drink wine <b>this year,</b> he is <b>prohibited</b> from drinking wine <b>for the entire</b> remainder of the <b>year; and</b> as <b>Rosh HaShana</b> is considered to be part <b>of the upcoming</b> year, not the current one, he is permitted to drink wine on that day. If he vowed not to drink wine during <b>this seven-year</b> Sabbatical cycle, wine is <b>forbidden</b> to him <b>for the entire</b> remainder of the <b>seven-year</b> cycle; <b>and</b> as <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year is considered part of the cycle <b>that passed,</b> he is prohibited from drinking wine during the upcoming Sabbatical Year.

### Part 6
All this applies if he said that he would not drink wine on this day or this week, <b>but if he said</b> that wine is forbidden to him for <b>one day,</b> or <b>one week,</b> or <b>one month,</b> or <b>one year,</b> or <b>one seven-year</b> cycle, he is <b>prohibited</b> from drinking wine <b>from</b> the <b>day</b> and time he took the vow <b>to</b> the same time the next <b>day,</b> or week, etc.

### Part 7
If he takes a vow that wine is forbidden to him <b>until Passover, it is forbidden</b> to him <b>until</b> Passover <b>arrives.</b> If he said: <b>Until it will be</b> Passover, <b>it is forbidden</b> to him <b>until</b> Passover <b>ends,</b> as he may have intended for the vow to apply as long as it was still Passover (Rosh). If he said: <b>Until before Passover, Rabbi Meir says:</b> It is <b>forbidden</b> to him <b>until</b> Passover <b>arrives. Rabbi Yosei says: It is forbidden</b> to him <b>until it ends.</b>

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that if one says: <b>Wine is</b> forbidden to me <b>as if</b> it were <b>an offering [<i>konam</i>],</b> and for <b>that</b> reason <b>I</b> will not <b>taste</b> it today, he is prohibited from drinking wine only until nightfall. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> Even <b>when darkness falls</b> he is not permitted to drink wine immediately; rather, <b>he is required</b> to <b>request</b> that <b>a halakhic authority</b> dissolve his vow.

### Part 9
The Gemara poses a question: <b>What is the reason</b> that he must request the dissolution of the vow once it has already expired? The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The Sages issued a rabbinic <b>decree</b> in the case of one who said that his vow applies <b>today, due to</b> the confusion that might be caused in a case where one said that his vow applies for <b>one day,</b> and is therefore forbidden to drink wine for twenty-four hours. There is a concern that if one who said that his vow applies today is permitted to drink wine that night, one who took a vow for one day will think that his vow also expires as soon as it is nightfall.
