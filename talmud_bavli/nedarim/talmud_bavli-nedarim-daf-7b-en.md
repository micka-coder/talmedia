### Part 1
They disagree <b>with regard to</b> a case when the language one uses is: <b>I am ostracized from you, as Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>it is a language of distancing</b> and therefore expresses a vow, <b>and the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>it is a language of excommunication,</b> and not the terminology with which people express vows.

### Part 2
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> Rav Pappa <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda, as</b> demonstrated in the following incident: There was <b>a certain man who said: I am excommunicated</b> from <b>the property of the son of Rav Yirmeya bar Abba. He came before Rav Ḥisda</b> to ask whether this statement was effective in generating a prohibition or not. Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: There is no one who,</b> in practice, <b>is concerned for that</b> opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva.</b> Apparently, Rav Ḥisda <b>holds</b> that <b>they</b> also <b>disagree with regard to</b> the phrase: <b>I am excommunicated</b> from you. This indicates that the dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i> is not with regard to specific terms but with regard to the more general question of whether terms of ostracism or excommunication are terms that can also express vows.

### Part 3
§ <b>Rabbi Ila said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If <b>one ostracized</b> another individual <b>in his presence, one</b> may <b>dissolve</b> it <b>for him only in his presence.</b> If <b>one ostracized him not in his presence, one</b> may <b>dissolve it for him in his presence or not in his presence.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ḥanin said</b> that <b>Rav said: One who hears mention of the name</b> of God in vain <b>by another</b> individual <b>must ostracize him</b> for doing so. <b>And if he did not ostracize him, he himself,</b> the listener, <b>shall be ostracized, as wherever mention of God’s name</b> in vain <b>is common, poverty is</b> also <b>common there.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And poverty is</b> so harsh that it is considered <b>like death, as it is stated: “For all the men are dead</b> who sought your life” (Exodus 4:19). The Sages had a tradition that Dathan and Abiram had sought to have Moses killed in Egypt and that they were the men referred to in the quoted verse (see 64b). They were still alive at that time but had become impoverished. <b>And</b> additionally, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Wherever</b> it says that <b>the Sages set their eyes</b> on a particular individual, the result was <b>either death or poverty.</b> This also indicates that death and poverty are equivalent.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Abba said: I was standing before Rav Huna,</b> and <b>he heard a certain woman utter a mention of the name</b> of God <b>in vain. He excommunicated her and immediately dissolved</b> the excommunication <b>for her in her presence.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Learn three things from this. Learn from this</b> that <b>one who hears mention of the name</b> of God in vain <b>by another</b> individual <b>must ostracize him; and learn from this</b> that if <b>one ostracized</b> another <b>in his presence, one</b> may <b>dissolve</b> it <b>for him only in his presence; and learn from this</b> that <b>there is nothing,</b> i.e., no minimum time that must pass, <b>between ostracism and nullification</b> of the ostracism.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said: A Torah scholar</b> can <b>ostracize himself, and he</b> can <b>nullify</b> the ostracism <b>for himself.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> it <b>obvious</b> that he can nullify the ostracism for himself, just as he is able to do for others? The Gemara answers: It states this <b>lest you say,</b> as per the popular maxim: <b>A prisoner cannot free himself from prison,</b> and since he is ostracized he cannot dissolve the ostracism for himself; therefore it <b>teaches us</b> that he can do so.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> where a Torah scholar might ostracize himself? It is <b>like that</b> case involving <b>Mar Zutra Ḥasida. When a student</b> in <b>the academy was liable to</b> receive <b>excommunication,</b> Mar Zutra Ḥasida would <b>first excommunicate himself and then he would excommunicate the student</b> of Torah. <b>And when he would enter his home, he would dissolve</b> the excommunication <b>for himself and then dissolve</b> the excommunication <b>for</b> the student.

### Part 9
<b>And Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b>
