### Part 1
<b>However,</b> if <b>he said only: I am avowed from you, they are both prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from one another. This is <b>like that which Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> If one says: <b>I am avowed from you, they are both prohibited.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (47b) that if one says to another: <b>I am hereby to you</b> like an item <b>dedicated</b> to the Temple, <b>the one to whom the vow was said is prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from the one who made the vow, <b>but the one who made the vow is not</b> prohibited from deriving benefit from the one with regard to whom the vow was said. However, according to Shmuel, both should be prohibited. The Gemara answers: It is referring to a case <b>where he specified</b> this by saying: <b>And you are not</b> like an item dedicated to the Temple <b>for me.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: That mishna also taught that if one says: <b>You are to me</b> like an item <b>dedicated</b> to the Temple, <b>the one who makes the vow is prohibited</b> to derive benefit from the other, <b>but the one to whom the vow was said is not</b> prohibited from deriving benefit from the one who makes the vow. However, according to Shmuel, both should be prohibited. The Gemara answers: Here too, it is referring to a case <b>where he specified</b> this by saying: <b>And I am not</b> like an item dedicated to the Temple <b>for you.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if he stated his vow in an <b>unspecified</b> manner, <b>what, are they both prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from each other? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it teaches in the latter clause</b> that if one says to another: <b>I am hereby to you, and you are to me,</b> like an item dedicated to the Temple, <b>they are both prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from each other, it can be derived that <b>it is in this</b> case <b>both are prohibited, but</b> if one stated his vow in an <b>unspecified</b> manner, <b>he is prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from the other individual <b>and the other is permitted</b> to derive benefit from him. This is not in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel.

### Part 5
<b>Rather, this is</b> how the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, was stated:</b> If one said to another: <b>I am avowed to you, they are both prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from one another. However, if he says: <b>I am avowed from you, he is prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from the other person <b>and the other is permitted</b> to derive benefit from him.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t the mishna teach</b> a case of one who declared: I am avowed <b>from you, and</b> yet <b>we established the mishna, according to Shmuel,</b> as teaching that <b>in all these</b> cases <b>it is only</b> if <b>he says: That</b> which <b>I taste</b> of <b>yours, or: That</b> which <b>I eat</b> of <b>yours, that he is prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from the other person, <b>and the other is permitted? However,</b> if he merely says: <b>I am avowed from you, they are both prohibited.</b> Consequently, Shmuel does not distinguish between the expressions: I am avowed from you, and: I am avowed to you.

### Part 7
<b>Rather, this is how</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel was originally stated: The reason is that he said: That</b> which <b>I eat</b> of <b>yours, or: That</b> which <b>I taste</b> of <b>yours.</b> It is for this reason <b>that he is prohibited only from eating</b> anything belonging to the other person. However, if he said: <b>I am avowed from you,</b> without further specification, <b>he is prohibited even from</b> deriving any form of <b>benefit</b> from the other.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let Shmuel say as follows: And if he said only: That</b> which <b>I eat</b> of <b>yours, or: That</b> which <b>I taste</b> of <b>yours, he is prohibited only from eating</b> an item belonging to his fellow, but he is permitted to derive benefit from it.

### Part 9
<b>Rather, this is</b> how Shmuel’s opinion <b>was stated: The reason is that he said: That</b> which <b>I eat</b> of <b>yours, or: That</b> which <b>I taste</b> of <b>yours; it is</b> in these cases <b>that he is prohibited</b> from eating any item belonging to his fellow. <b>However,</b> if <b>he said</b> simply: <b>I am avowed from you,</b> that statement <b>does not indicate that he said</b> he is <b>prohibited</b> from eating an item belonging to his fellow. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The statement: <b>I am avowed from you, indicates: I am not speaking with you.</b> Similarly, the statement: <b>I am separated from you, indicates: I am not doing business with you.</b> The statement: <b>I am distanced from you, indicates that I will not stand within four cubits of you.</b>
