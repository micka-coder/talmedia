then <b>they are not subject to</b> the possibility of <b>redemption.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara questions the language of the mishna: Why does the mishna utilize the wording: They have redemption and they do not have redemption? <b>Let</b> the mishna <b>teach: They are consecrated and they are not consecrated,</b> since the primary novelty is that they are consecrated, but not completely. The Gemara answers: <b>Since it wanted to teach</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> the phrase: <b>They are not subject to</b> the possibility of <b>redemption,</b> which cannot be expressed as: They are not consecrated, as they are consecrated, <b>it taught also the first clause</b> using the language: <b>They are subject to</b> the possibility of <b>redemption.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara elaborates: <b>How did he take a vow?</b> What was the precise language that he used? <b>Ameimar said: Where he says:</b> These saplings are like an offering <b>if they are not cut</b> down <b>today, and the day passed and they were not cut</b> down. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why do I</b> need <b>to say</b> that they are consecrated? Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that his vow takes effect? The Gemara answers: <b>No, it is necessary</b> in a case <b>where there is a great</b> strong <b>wind</b> and he thought that they would be uprooted by the wind.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t this taught together with</b> the case of <b>a garment,</b> indicating that the two are equivalent, <b>and</b> is <b>a garment ready for burning,</b> i.e., is it assumed that it will burn? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> in a case <b>where there is a fire.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Here also there is a great</b> strong <b>wind, and</b> it <b>enters your mind that one raised in his mind</b> the possibility <b>that</b> the saplings <b>will not be saved, and due to that</b> reason <b>he took a vow.</b> Since in any event he assumes he will lose the saplings, perhaps he did not really intend to consecrate them. The mishna <b>teaches us</b> that in spite of this it is still considered a vow.

### Part 5
§ The mishna states that if he said: <b>These saplings are</b> like <b>an offering</b> until they are cut down, they are not subject to the possibility of redemption. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> are they not subject to redemption <b>forever? Bar Padda said:</b> If he <b>redeemed them, they become consecrated again,</b> as they have not yet been cut down. <b>If</b> he <b>redeemed them</b> again, <b>they become consecrated again, until they are cut</b> down. Once <b>they are cut</b> down, <b>he redeems them once and it is sufficient. And Ulla said: Once they are cut</b> down one does <b>not</b> need to <b>redeem them again</b> because they are no longer consecrated.
