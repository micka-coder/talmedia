### Part 1
<b>so too, it is impossible to dream without idle matter.</b> It is possible that the excommunication was real and the dissolution was not real, and he must have the ostracism dissolved by ten people.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina’s wife had</b> taken <b>a vow</b> that he had not immediately nullified as a husband is entitled to do, and she wished to have it dissolved. Ravina <b>came before Rav Ashi</b> and <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>a husband can become an agent to</b> express <b>his wife’s regret</b> to a court so that they can dissolve her vow? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: If</b> three people who can dissolve the vow <b>were</b> already <b>assembled, yes; if</b> they are <b>not</b> already assembled, <b>no,</b> a husband cannot serve as an agent to express his wife’s regret to the court.

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: <b>Learn from this</b> incident <b>three</b> <i>halakhot</i>: <b>Learn from this</b> that <b>a husband can become an agent to</b> express <b>his wife’s regret. And learn from this</b> that a Sage <b>is not permitted to dissolve a vow in the location of his teacher,</b> which is why Ravina, a distinguished Sage, did not dissolve the vow without consulting Rav Ashi. <b>And learn from this</b> that <b>when</b> three people <b>were</b> already <b>assembled,</b> it <b>seems well</b> for a husband to serve as an agent to express his wife’s regret, but if the three people were not yet assembled he cannot serve as her agent.

### Part 4
The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> one may dissolve <b>excommunication even in the location of his teacher. And an individual</b> Sage who is an <b>expert</b> can <b>dissolve excommunication</b> even without two other judges.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rabbi Shimon bar Zevid said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Tavla said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya Arikha,</b> the tall, <b>of the school of Rabbi Aḥa said</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said</b> that <b>Rabbi Meyasha said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Elai: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “But to you that fear My name shall the sun of righteousness arise</b> with healing in its wings; and you shall go forth and leap as calves of the stall” (Malachi 3:20)? “You that fear My name”; <b>these are people who are afraid to mention the name of Heaven in vain.</b> The verse states that <b>a sun of righteousness with healing</b> will arise to heal them. <b>Abaye said: Learn from this</b> verse that <b>the dust [<i>ḥirga</i>]</b> that is illuminated by the rays of the sun during <b>the day heals,</b> as it states: “With healing in its wings.”

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: Abaye <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> who <b>said: There is no Gehenna in the World-to-Come. Rather, the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> will <b>remove the sun from its sheath [<i>minartika</i>],</b> and <b>the righteous will be healed by it and the wicked will be punished by it.</b> The righteous will be healed by it, <b>as it is stated: “But to you that fear My name shall the sun</b> of righteousness <b>arise</b> with healing in its wings”; <b>and moreover,</b> not only will they be healed by it <b>but they will</b> even <b>be rejuvenated by it, as it is stated: “And you shall go forth and leap as calves of the stall.”</b>

### Part 7
<b>And the wicked will be punished by</b> the same sun, <b>as it is stated: “For behold, the day is coming, it burns as a furnace;</b> and all the proud, and all that work wickedness, shall be stubble; and the day that comes shall set them ablaze” (Malachi 3:19). Consequently, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish holds that the sun heals only in the World-to-Come, whereas Abaye interprets the verse as referring to this world.
