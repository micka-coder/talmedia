### Part 1
<b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion among the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>does Rav’s <i>halakha</i> correspond?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said</b> as a principle that <b>the hand of a woman is like the hand of her husband.</b> According to Rabbi Meir, a slave has no independent right of acquisition, and anything given to a slave belongs to his master even if it was stipulated otherwise (see <i>Kiddushin</i> 23b). Rav assumes that similarly, a married woman has no independent right of acquisition, but rather, anything that she attempts to acquire for herself is automatically acquired by her husband.

### Part 2
Rabbi Zeira continues: <b>And raise a contradiction</b> from an unattributed mishna (<i>Eiruvin</i> 73b), which presumably follows the opinion of Rabbi Meir: <b>How does one merge</b> the courtyards that open <b>into an alleyway</b> in order to permit its residents to carry on Shabbat from one courtyard to another in the same alley, if a person wishes to act on behalf of all the residents of the alleyway? <b>He places a barrel</b> filled with his own food or wine <b>and says: This is for all the residents of the alleyway.</b> For this gift to be acquired by the others, someone must accept it on their behalf, <b>and</b> the <i>tanna</i> therefore teaches that <b>he may transfer possession to them</b> even <b>by means of his Hebrew slave or maidservant,</b> whom he does not own, <b>and</b> likewise <b>by means of his adult son or daughter, and</b> similarly <b>by means of his wife.</b> These people may acquire the <i>eiruv</i> food on behalf of all the residents of the alleyway.

### Part 3
Rabbi Zeira states the contradiction: <b>And if you say</b> that a woman’s <b>husband acquires</b> anything given to her, <b>the <i>eiruv</i></b> food <b>has</b> consequently <b>not left the husband’s domain</b> when he gives it to his wife, for anything she acquires belongs to him. Rather, it can be seen from here that Rabbi Meir does not extend his principle from a slave to a married woman, in opposition of the ruling of Rav.

### Part 4
<b>Rava said</b> in response: <b>Even though Rabbi Meir said</b> that in general <b>the hand of a woman is like the hand of her husband,</b> in accordance with the ruling of Rav, <b>Rabbi Meir</b> nevertheless <b>concedes with regard to the merging</b> of alleyways <b>that since it</b> is her aim <b>to acquire</b> the <i>eiruv</i> food <b>for others from the hand of her husband,</b> and not to acquire it for herself, <b>she can acquire</b> it from him for this purpose.

### Part 5
<b>Ravina raised an objection to Rav Ashi</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>These are</b> the people <b>who can acquire</b> <i>eiruv</i> food <b>on behalf of</b> others: The <i>eiruv</i> food can be acquired <b>by means of his adult son or daughter, and</b> by means of <b>his Hebrew slave or maidservant. And these are</b> the people <b>who cannot acquire</b> an <i>eiruv</i> <b>on behalf of</b> others: The <i>eiruv</i> food cannot be acquired <b>by means of his minor son or daughter, or</b> by means of <b>his Canaanite slave or maidservant, or</b> by means of <b>his wife.</b> This indicates that a married woman does not have an independent right of acquisition to acquire the <i>eiruv</i> food on behalf of others, in opposition to the ruling of the mishna.

### Part 6
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said:</b> In <b>the mishna</b> in <i>Eiruvin</i>, <b>we are dealing with</b> a woman <b>who possesses a courtyard</b> of her own <b>in that alleyway,</b> i.e., it is a case where the husband had earlier stipulated that she should have property of her own, to which he renounces all his rights. <b>As, since she acquires</b> the <i>eiruv</i> food <b>for herself</b> by virtue of the courtyard that she owns in that alleyway, <b>she</b> likewise <b>acquires</b> it <b>for others.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The Torah states: <b>“But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced,</b> with which she has bound her soul, <b>shall stand against her”</b> (Numbers 30:10). <b>How so?</b> If a widow or divorced woman <b>said: I am hereby a nazirite after thirty days,</b> then <b>even if she was married within thirty days,</b> her new husband <b>cannot nullify</b> her vow.
