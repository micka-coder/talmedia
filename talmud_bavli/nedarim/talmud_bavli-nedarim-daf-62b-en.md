### Part 1
<b>To open</b> the Torah reading <b>first, to recite a blessing first, and to take a fine portion first.</b> When portions are distributed equally, a priest can choose his share first. The verse with regard to the sons of David proves that the same <i>halakha</i> applies to Torah scholars.

### Part 2
Furthermore, <b>Rava said: It is permitted for a Torah scholar to say: I will not pay the head tax [<i>karga</i>], as it is written</b> that the king of Persia wrote to Ezra, with regard to the priests, the Levites, and others who worked in the Temple: <b>“It shall not be lawful to impose <i>minda</i>, <i>belo</i>, and <i>halakh</i> upon them”</b> (Ezra 7:24). <b>And Rabbi Yehuda said: <i>Minda</i>; this is the king’s portion. <i>Belo</i>; this is the money</b> of the <b>head</b> tax. <b>And <i>halakh</i>; this is <i>arnona</i>,</b> a levy on people and their animals to perform physical labor in the service of the ruling authority. Since a Torah scholar is considered equivalent to a priest, as he is also dedicated to a sacred task, this exemption applies to him as well.

### Part 3
<b>And Rava said</b> further: <b>It is permitted for a Torah scholar to say: I am a servant</b> of the priests <b>of fire</b> worship and therefore <b>I will not pay the head tax.</b> Rava maintains that a scholar may issue a statement of this kind in a place where the priests of fire-worshippers are exempt from the head tax, because he actually is declaring himself a servant of God, who is referred to as “a devouring fire” (Deuteronomy 4:24). <b>What is the reason</b> that he is allowed to make this statement? He <b>is saying</b> it merely in order <b>to chase a lion</b> away <b>from him,</b> i.e., to avoid suffering a loss.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ashi had a particular forest,</b> and <b>he sold it</b> for its wood <b>to the temple of fire</b> worship. <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Isn’t there</b> the prohibition: <b>“You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), which prohibits assisting others in committing transgressions? And yet you are providing assistance to an idolatrous cult. <b>He said to him: Most</b> of the <b>wood</b> they use <b>is for kindling,</b> not for their ritual service. Consequently, I need not be concerned that the particular wood that I have sold them will be used for idolatry.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one takes a vow <b>until the harvest,</b> the vow remains in effect <b>until people begin to harvest.</b> This is referring to <b>the wheat harvest but not the barley harvest.</b> As for the exact date of this event, <b>all</b> is determined <b>according to the place</b> where he took <b>his vow. If he was on a mountain,</b> it is assumed that he referred to the time of the harvest on <b>the mountain, and if he was in a valley,</b> it is assumed that he meant the time of the harvest <b>in the valley.</b>

### Part 6
If one takes a vow <b>until the rains,</b> or <b>until there are rains,</b> the vow remains in effect <b>until the second rain</b> of the rainy season <b>falls. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Until the time of the</b> second <b>rainfall arrives,</b> even if rain does not fall. If one takes a vow <b>until</b> the <b>rains end,</b> the vow remains in effect <b>until the entire</b> month of <b>Nisan has ended;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: Until Passover has passed.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who vows until the summer in the Galilee and</b> subsequently <b>descends to the valleys, even if the summer</b> season <b>has</b> already <b>arrived in the valleys,</b> the subject of his vow remains <b>forbidden</b> to him <b>until summer arrives in the Galilee,</b> in accordance with the mishna’s ruling that the duration of a vow is in accordance with the place where it was made.

### Part 8
The mishna states that if one takes a vow <b>until the rains,</b> or <b>until there are rains,</b> he means <b>until the second rain</b> of the rainy season. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> Until the time of the second rainfall arrives. The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> is in a case <b>where</b> one <b>said: Until the rains. However,</b> if <b>he says: Until the rain,</b> everyone agrees that <b>he is saying</b> that the vow should remain in effect <b>until the time of the rains,</b> but not necessarily until the rain actually falls.
