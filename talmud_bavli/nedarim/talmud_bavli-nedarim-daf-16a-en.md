### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna? It is</b> apparently the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. As, if</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> there is a contradiction, because <b>he does not differentiate</b> whether one takes a vow by saying: <b>An offering, and he does not differentiate</b> whether he takes a vow by saying: <b>This offering.</b> In both cases the vow does not take effect, as he did not use the phrase: Like an offering. The mishna, by contrast, indicates that only a vow that is phrased: An offering that I will not eat of yours, or: This offering that I will eat of yours, does not take effect. If it is phrased: An offering I will eat of yours, it takes effect, as it indicates that his eating will be like an offering.

### Part 2
The Gemara continues its analysis: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If he says: That which <b>I will not eat of yours</b> is <b>not an offering,</b> the food is <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (13a) that if one said: That which <b>I will not eat of yours</b> will be <b>for an offering [<i>lekorban</i>], Rabbi Meir forbids</b> the food to him? <b>And Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>it is rendered as one who says:</b> Your food <b>will be</b> to me <b>for an offering; therefore, I will not eat of yours.</b> The mishna appears to be incompatible with the opinion of Rabbi Meir as well.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult. That</b> mishna is referring to one <b>who said: For an offering [<i>lekorban</i>],</b> and the vow therefore takes effect. <b>This</b> mishna is referring to one <b>who said: Not for an offering [<i>la lekorban</i>],</b> where <b>he is saying that it should not be an offering,</b> and therefore the vow does not take effect.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one says: <b>An oath</b> that <b>I will not eat of yours,</b> or: <b>This</b> is <b>an oath that I will eat of yours [<i>she’okhal lekha</i>],</b> or: <b>Not an oath that I will not eat of yours,</b> the food <b>is forbidden.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>By inference</b> from the mishna, it may be derived <b>that</b> the statement: <b>This is an oath that I will eat of yours, indicates that I will not eat. And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Shevuot</i> 19b): There are <b>two</b> basic types of <b>oaths that are</b> in fact <b>four:</b> An oath <b>that I will eat, and: That I will not eat;</b> an oath <b>that I ate, and: That I did not eat. From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>states:</b> That I will eat, in contradistinction to: <b>That I will not eat; that I ate, and</b> in contradistinction: <b>That I did not eat,</b> it may be derived <b>by inference that</b> an oath <b>that I will eat of yours [<i>she’okhal lekha</i>] indicates:</b> An oath <b>that I will eat.</b> This contradicts our mishna.

### Part 6
<b>Abaye said:</b> The phrase: <b>That I will eat [<i>she’okhal</i>], indicates two expressions,</b> depending on the context in which it is used. How so? If <b>they were importuning [<i>mesarevin</i>] him to eat, and he said: I will eat, I will eat, and</b> he <b>furthermore</b> said: <b>An oath that I will eat [<i>she’okhal</i>], it indicates: That I will eat. However,</b> if <b>he said: I will not eat, I will not eat, and he furthermore said: An oath that I will eat [<i>she’okhal</i>], he is saying: That I will not eat.</b> The oath is intended to reinforce his refusal to eat.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the phrase: <b>That I will eat [<i>she’okhal</i>],</b> cited in the mishna <b>with regard to an oath, is</b> actually <b>saying</b> that <b>he said: That I will not eat [<i>she’i okhal</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the prohibition <b>is obvious,</b> as he explicitly took an oath not to eat. <b>What</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>he blundered</b> in properly <b>upholding the wording,</b> i.e., he mispronounced the vow, as his intention was to say: An oath that I will eat [<i>she’okhal</i>], the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that he meant that he will not eat.

### Part 8
<b>Abaye did not state</b> the <b>reason</b> for the ruling of the mishna that was stated <b>by Rav Ashi, as</b> the mishna <b>does not teach</b> the case of: <b>That I will not eat [<i>she’i okhal</i>].</b> Rather, it teaches the case of that I will eat [<i>she’okhal</i>].

### Part 9
<b>And Rav Ashi turned away [<i>nadei</i>] from the reason that Abaye</b> stated, because <b>he held</b> that the phrase: <b>That I will not eat, also indicates two expressions,</b> depending on the context. For example, if <b>they were importuning him to eat and he said: I will not eat, I will not eat, and</b> subsequently <b>he</b> also <b>said: An oath,</b> then, in this case, <b>whether</b> the wording of the oath was: <b>That I will eat, or: That I will not eat, this</b> expression <b>indicates that he is saying: I will eat.</b> The statement: An oath that I will not eat, should be interpreted rhetorically in this context: Did I take an oath that I will not eat? Certainly I did not, as I will eat.

### Part 10
<b>And there is also</b> a way <b>to interpret the expression: An oath that I will not eat,</b> as <b>indicating</b> its straightforward meaning, i.e., that he is <b>saying: An oath that I will not eat.</b> Therefore, the mishna cannot be interpreted in this manner. <b>Rather, the <i>tanna</i></b> in tractate <i>Shevuot</i> clearly <b>established a principle: That I will eat, indicates that I will eat, and: That I will not eat, indicates I will not eat.</b> Therefore, the correct version of the mishna must be: That I will not eat [<i>she’i okhal</i>].

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>This</b> rule, that oaths can render actions, which do not have actual substance, either prohibited or obligatory, <b>is a stringency of oaths vis-à-vis vows,</b> which do not take effect with regard to matters that do not have actual substance. <b>And</b> there is also <b>a stringency of vows vis-à-vis oaths. How so?</b> With regard to one who <b>said: Making a <i>sukka</i> is <i>konam</i> for me,</b> or: <b>Taking a <i>lulav</i> is</b> <i>konam</i> <b>for me,</b> or: <b>Donning phylacteries is</b> <i>konam</i> <b>for me, in</b> the case of <b>vows,</b> the items are rendered <b>forbidden,</b> and he may not perform the mitzva until the vow is dissolved. However, <b>in</b> the case of similar <b>oaths,</b> these items are <b>permitted, as one cannot take an oath to transgress the mitzvot.</b>
