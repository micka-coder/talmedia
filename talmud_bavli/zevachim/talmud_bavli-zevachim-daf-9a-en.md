### Part 1
<b>Offerings that are eaten,</b> in this case the Paschal offering, <b>are diverted</b> when slaughtered not for their sake <b>to</b> serve as other types of <b>offerings that are eaten,</b> such as peace offerings. <b>But offerings that are eaten are not diverted to</b> serve as <b>offerings that are not eaten,</b> such as burnt offerings.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>a sin offering and a guilt offering are not eaten?</b> Why does a Paschal offering receive the status of a peace offering and not that of a sin offering or a guilt offering, which are eaten by the priests?

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> the answer should be emended: <b>Offerings that are eaten by every</b> Jewish <b>person are diverted to</b> serve as <b>offerings eaten by every</b> Jewish <b>person,</b> i.e., peace offerings. <b>But offerings eaten by every</b> Jewish <b>person are not diverted to</b> serve as <b>offerings not eaten by every</b> Jewish <b>person,</b> i.e., sin offerings and guilt offerings, which are eaten only by priests.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Avin, says</b> that there is a different answer: <b>Offerings of lesser sanctity are diverted to</b> serve as <b>offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> i.e., peace offerings. <b>But offerings of lesser sanctity are not diverted to</b> serve as <b>offerings of the most sacred order,</b> i.e., burnt offerings, sin offerings, or guilt offerings.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Savriyu, objects to this</b> answer: If so, <b>say</b> that if one <b>slaughtered</b> a Paschal offering <b>for the sake of</b> the animal <b>tithe, let it be</b> rendered animal <b>tithe,</b> which, like a Paschal offering, is an offering of lesser sanctity. The Gemara adds: <b>For what <i>halakha</i></b> does it matter, practically speaking, that a Paschal offering has been rendered an animal tithe rather than a peace offering? It matters <b>because</b> if it is rendered an animal tithe, <b>it should not require libations. And</b> furthermore, if one sells it, he <b>should be flogged for</b> transgressing the prohibition: <b>“It shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:33), which applies to the animal tithe even after its slaughter.

### Part 6
The Gemara responds: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the animal tithe: <b>“The tenth shall be sacred”</b> (Leviticus 27:32). The definite article indicates that <b>this,</b> the tenth animal, is the <b>tithe, but another</b> animal slaughtered for its sake is <b>not a tithe.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara challenges: Still, <b>say</b> that if one <b>slaughtered</b> a Paschal offering <b>for the sake of a firstborn</b> animal, <b>let it be</b> rendered <b>like a firstborn.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>For what <i>halakha</i></b> does it matter, practically speaking, that it has been rendered a firstborn rather than a peace offering? It matters <b>because</b> if it is rendered a firstborn, <b>it should not require libations. Also,</b> this means <b>that one should give it to the priests.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: With regard to <b>a firstborn too,</b> the verse states: “That you shall set apart [<i>veha’avarta</i>] unto the Lord all that opens the womb” (Exodus 13:12). Since with regard to the animal tithe it is stated: “Whatever passes [<i>ya’avor</i>] under the rod, the tenth shall be holy” (Leviticus 27:32), it is <b>derived</b> by verbal analogy between the <b>passing [<i>avara</i>]</b> stated with regard to a firstborn and the <b>passing [<i>avara</i>]</b> stated with regard to the animal <b>tithe</b> that a Paschal offering cannot become a firstborn either.

### Part 9
The Gemara challenges: <b>But say</b> that if one <b>slaughtered</b> a Paschal offering <b>for the sake of a substitute, let it be</b> rendered <b>a substitute.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>For what <i>halakha</i></b> does it matter, practically speaking, that it has been rendered a substitute rather than a peace offering? The one who slaughtered it <b>should be flogged for</b> transgressing the prohibition of effecting substitution. <b>Also,</b> its sale <b>should be determined to</b> violate the prohibition: <b>“It shall not be sold or redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:28).

### Part 10
<b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, says:</b> It is derived from that which <b>the verse states</b> with regard to substitution: <b>“Then both it and that for which it is changed</b> shall be sacred” (Leviticus 27:33). The verse teaches that only <b>it,</b> the animal substituted, is <b>a substitute, but another</b> animal is <b>not a substitute.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges: <b>But say</b> that if one <b>slaughtered</b> a Paschal offering <b>for the sake of a thanks offering, let it be</b> rendered <b>like a thanks offering.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>For what <i>halakha</i></b> does it practically matter that it has been rendered a thanks offering rather than a peace offering? If so, <b>it should require</b> a meal offering of forty loaves of <b>bread.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>Is there anything,</b> i.e., any situation, comparable to this suggestion <b>that a Paschal offering itself does not require bread, but its leftover,</b> an animal consecrated as a Paschal offering but ultimately not sacrificed on Passover eve, <b>requires bread</b> when slaughtered not for its sake? Such a suggestion is implausible.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, now</b> that a leftover Paschal offering slaughtered for the sake of a peace offering becomes a peace offering, this objection can <b>also</b> be raised: <b>Is there anything</b> comparable to the suggestion <b>that a Paschal offering itself does not require libations, but its leftover requires libations</b> as a peace offering?

### Part 14
The Gemara explains its answer: <b>This</b> is what <b>we are saying: Is there anything</b> comparable to the suggestion <b>that the leftover of a thanks offering itself does not require bread, but</b> the <b>leftover</b> of an offering <b>from</b> some <b>other</b> category <b>requires bread?</b>

### Part 15
§ It was taught that the verse: “And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord is of the flock” (Leviticus 3:6), teaches that a Paschal offering sacrificed not on Passover eve is rendered a peace offering if sacrificed not for its sake. <b>Rav Yeimar, son of Rav Hillel, objects to this: But from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> this verse <b>is written with regard to a leftover Paschal offering? Perhaps it is written with regard to a leftover guilt offering;</b> a guilt offering is also brought only from the flock.

### Part 16
<b>Rava says: The verse states: “And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings</b> unto the Lord <b>is of [<i>min</i>] the flock,”</b> where the term “<i>min</i>” indicates <b>that is</b> brought <b>equally from all</b> species of the <b>flock,</b> i.e., from both sheep and goats. A guilt offering, by contrast, is brought only from rams, i.e., male sheep.

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Avin bar Ḥiyya, and some say Rabbi Avin bar Kahana, objects to this: You say everywhere</b> that the word <b>“<i>min</i>”</b> is stated <b>to exclude</b> items, <b>but here</b> you claim that the word <b>“<i>min</i>”</b> is stated <b>to include</b> all species of the flock? You should say the opposite: The verse indicates an offering that is brought only from some species of the flock, i.e., a guilt offering.

### Part 18
<b>Rabbi Mani says: Here too,</b> the word <b>“<i>min</i>”</b> is stated <b>to exclude</b> certain categories of the flock, <b>as</b> a Paschal offering <b>is not brought</b> from an animal that is <b>in its second year, and is not brought from</b> the <b>female</b> animals of the flock.

### Part 19
The Gemara cites another objection. <b>Rav Ḥana of Baghdad objects to this: How can you say that when this</b> verse <b>is written, it is written with regard to a leftover Paschal offering? But from</b> that <b>which is written</b> in the subsequent verses: <b>“If</b> he brings <b>a lamb”</b> (Leviticus 3:7), and <b>“if</b> his offering is <b>a goat”</b> (Leviticus 3:12), one learns <b>by inference that</b> the passage is <b>not written with regard to a leftover Paschal offering;</b> the Torah states elsewhere, in Exodus 12:5, that a Paschal offering is brought from both lambs and goats, and it is unnecessary to teach this again in Leviticus.

### Part 20
The Gemara answers: <b>Those</b> verses <b>are necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The word <b>“lamb”</b> is written <b>to include the Paschal offering in</b> the requirement that the <b>tail</b> be offered on the altar, which is written subsequently with regard to a peace offering (Leviticus 3:9), since this <i>halakha</i> is not mentioned in the verses concerning the Paschal offering.

### Part 21
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “If</b> he brings <b>a lamb,”</b> it is <b>to include in all the mitzvot of peace offerings a Paschal offering whose</b> first <b>year has passed</b> and is therefore too old to be sacrificed as a Paschal offering, <b>and peace offerings brought due to a Paschal offering.</b> Specifically, this indicates <b>that they require placing hands</b> on the head of the offering, <b>libations, and the waving of</b> the <b>breast and thigh. And when</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “And <b>if</b> his offering is a <b>goat,” it interrupted the</b> previous <b>matter</b> and <b>taught that the</b> sacrificing of <b>a goat does not require</b> that the <b>tail</b> be burned on the altar.

### Part 22
The Gemara asks: <b>But is it derived from here</b> that a Paschal offering that is too old to be sacrificed as a Paschal offering is sacrificed as a peace offering? <b>It is derived from</b> the verse <b>that Shmuel’s father</b> cites, <b>as Shmuel’s father says:</b> The verse: <b>“And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings</b> unto the Lord <b>is of the flock”</b> (Leviticus 3:6), teaches that an offering <b>that is brought</b> only <b>from the flock,</b> i.e., the Paschal offering, <b>will be a sacrifice of peace offerings.</b>

### Part 23
The Gemara responds: <b>But</b> even without the <i>baraita</i>, Shmuel’s father’s statement is <b>still</b> superfluous, as that <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived from that which Rav Naḥman</b> says that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says. As Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a leftover Paschal offering is sacrificed as a peace offering? As it is stated: “And you shall sacrifice the Passover offering unto the Lord, your God, of the flock and the herd”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:2). Why is the herd mentioned? <b>But isn’t a Paschal offering brought only from the lambs and from the goats? Rather,</b> it is derived <b>from here that a leftover Paschal offering should be</b> sacrificed as an offering <b>brought</b> both <b>from the flock and from the herd. And what is that?</b> It is <b>a peace offering.</b>

### Part 24
<b>Rather,</b> none of these derivations are superfluous, as <b>three verses are written</b> that teach the <i>halakha</i> that a Paschal offering that is sacrificed not on Passover eve is sacrificed as a peace offering.
