### Part 1
those bundles <b>must be burned.</b> If the bundles <b>were intermingled with others, and</b> those <b>others</b> were intermingled <b>with others, they all must be burned.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: They can be nullified when</b> the total is <b>201</b> items, i.e., one prohibited item intermingled with two hundred permitted ones.

### Part 2
The mishna continues: Rabbi Meir holds that they all must be burned, <b>as Rabbi Meir would say: Any</b> item <b>whose manner is to be counted renders</b> its mixture <b>prohibited,</b> as it is considered significant and cannot be nullified. <b>And the Rabbis say: Only six items</b> are sufficiently significant to <b>render</b> their mixture <b>prohibited. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> There are <b>seven. And they are: Nuts</b> with <b>brittle</b> shells, <b>and pomegranates from Badan, and sealed barrels</b> of wine, <b>and beet greens, and cabbage stalks, and Greek gourd. Rabbi Akiva adds: Loaves of a homeowner</b> are <b>also</b> in this category.

### Part 3
The mishna continues: Different prohibitions apply to these items. <b>That which is fit</b> to be forbidden due <b>to the prohibition against eating the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting [<i>orla</i>],</b> i.e., nuts, pomegranates, and sealed barrels of wine, prohibit their mixture as <b><i>orla</i>. That which is fit</b> to be forbidden due <b>to diverse kinds</b> planted <b>in a vineyard,</b> i.e., beets, cabbage, and gourd, prohibit their mixture as <b>diverse kinds in a vineyard.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And it was stated</b> that there is a dispute between <i>amora’im</i> <b>with regard to</b> the wording of Rabbi Meir’s opinion in this mishna. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>we learned:</b> Only an item <b>whose manner is</b> exclusively <b>to be counted</b> is significant and cannot be nulli-fied, and it therefore renders its mixture prohibited according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says</b> that <b>we learned: Any</b> item <b>whose manner is</b> also <b>to be counted</b> is significant and cannot be nullified.

### Part 5
The Gemara reiterates its question: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish, but according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, what can be said?</b> According to his opinion, since animals are not sold exclusively by unit, they are not sufficiently significant. Therefore, a prohibited animal should be nullified in a simple majority. <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>this <i>tanna</i>,</b> who says that a prohibited animal cannot be nullified, <b>is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>of</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a <i>litra</i> of dried figs, who says:</b>
