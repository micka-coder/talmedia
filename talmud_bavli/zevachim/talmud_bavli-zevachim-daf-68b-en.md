### Part 1
or if he pinched <b>doves whose time</b> of fitness for sacrifice <b>has not</b> yet <b>arrived,</b> as they are too young to be sacrificed; <b>or if he</b> pinched <b>pigeons whose time</b> of fitness <b>has passed,</b> as they are too old; or if he pinched the nape of a fledgling <b>whose wing was withered,</b> or <b>whose eye was blinded, or whose leg was severed;</b> in all these cases, although the bird’s nape was pinched, <b>it renders</b> one who swallows it <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat.</b>

### Part 2
<b>This is the principle:</b> The meat of <b>any</b> bird that was initially fit for sacrifice and <b>whose disqualification</b> occurred in the course of the service <b>in the sacred</b> Temple courtyard <b>does not render</b> one who swallows it <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat.</b> The meat of any bird <b>whose disqualification did not occur in the sacred</b> area, but rather was disqualified before the service began, <b>renders</b> one <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav says:</b> Pinching with the thumbnail of the <b>left</b> hand <b>and</b> pinching at <b>night do not</b> cause the offering’s meat to <b>render</b> one who swallows it <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat</b> as would the carcass of an unslaughtered bird; but pinching by <b>a non-priest and</b> pinching, i.e., cutting from the nape of the neck, with <b>a knife</b> rather than the fingernail do cause the meat to <b>render</b> one <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara challenges: <b>What is different</b> about the first two cases that prevents the bird from assuming the status of a carcass? Temple service with the <b>left</b> hand <b>has</b> an instance of <b>validity</b> during the service <b>on Yom Kippur,</b> when the High Priest enters the Holy of Holies holding the spoon of incense in his left hand. <b>And</b> Temple service at <b>night has</b> an instance of <b>validity in</b> the burning of <b>limbs and fats</b> of offerings on the altar, which may be burned throughout the night. But <b>a non-priest also has</b> an instance of <b>validity in</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of animal offerings. Why then does Rav rule that pinching by a non-priest renders the bird a carcass? The Gemara answers: <b>Slaughter is not</b> considered a full-fledged sacrificial <b>rite,</b> and therefore it cannot be compared to pinching.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it <b>not</b> a full-fledged rite? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Zeira say</b> that <b>the slaughter of</b> a red <b>heifer by a non-priest is not valid,</b> which indicates that it is a full-fledged rite? <b>And Rav showed</b> a source in the Torah <b>for</b> this <i>halakha</i>: The verses concerning the red heifer mention both <b>Elazar</b> the priest as performing the slaughter <b>and</b> the word <b>“statute,”</b> which is mentioned in the verse: “This is the statute of the law” (Numbers 19:2), teaching that Elazar’s involvement was halakhically required.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: The red <b>heifer is different, as it</b> has the halakhic status of an item <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance</b> rather than for sacrifice on the altar. Therefore, its slaughter cannot teach the <i>halakha</i> concerning an actual offering.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> can <b>it not</b> be inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that slaughter is a sacrificial rite? If animals that have the status of items <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance,</b> which are of lesser sanctity, <b>require</b> slaughter by the <b>priesthood, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that the slaughter of animals <b>consecrated for</b> sacrifice on the <b>altar,</b> which are of greater sanctity, is a sacrificial rite that should require a priest? Apparently, the fact that non-priests may slaughter offerings proves that certain sacrificial rites apply to them.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> The slaughter of a red heifer does not constitute Temple service at all, and therefore it cannot be compared to the slaughter of an offering. The <i>halakha</i> is <b>just as it is with regard to</b> the examination of the <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks, which</b> does <b>not</b> constitute Temple <b>service but requires</b> a declaration of purity or impurity by the <b>priesthood.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>But let us derive from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a private <b>altar,</b> which was a valid medium for sacrificing offerings before the Temple was built, where non-priests were permitted to pinch the napes of bird offerings, that there is a circumstance in which pinching by non-priests is valid. Why then does the bird assume the status of a carcass when the pinching is performed by a non-priest?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>One cannot derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the Temple service <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a private <b>altar,</b> which was considered non-sacred by comparison.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> can one <b>not</b> derive the <i>halakhot</i> of the Temple service from the <i>halakhot</i> of a private altar? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to</b> an item, e.g., the limbs of an offering, which <b>emerged</b> from the Temple courtyard and was thereby rendered unfit for sacrifice upon the altar, <b>that if</b> it nevertheless <b>ascended</b> upon the altar <b>it shall not descend?</b> It is derived from the fact <b>that</b> an item that <b>emerged is valid</b> for sacrifice <b>on</b> a private <b>altar.</b> This indicates that one can learn from the <i>halakhot</i> of a private altar with regard to the Temple service.

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i></b> of that <i>baraita</i> <b>relies on</b> the verse: <b>“This is the law of the burnt offering [<i>ha’ola</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), from which it is derived that any item that ascends [<i>ola</i>] upon the altar shall not descend from it, even if it was disqualified. In other words, the verse is the actual source for the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, whereas the case of a private altar is cited merely in support of this ruling.

### Part 13
Until this point the Gemara has discussed the opinion of Rav, who holds that the pinching of a non-priest renders the bird a carcass with regard to ritual impurity. <b>But Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If <b>a non-priest</b> pinched the nape of a bird offering, the meat <b>does not render</b> one who swallows it <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat;</b> but if a priest pinched it, i.e., cut it from the nape of the neck, with <b>a knife,</b> the meat <b>renders</b> one <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara brings proof for the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan from that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>any</b> of those <b>disqualified</b> for Temple service <b>pinched</b> the nape of a bird offering, <b>their pinching is not valid,</b> but the meat does not render one who swallows it ritually impure when it is in the throat. <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> the word: <b>Any,</b> is written <b>to add</b> that even the pinching of <b>a non-priest</b> does not render the bird a carcass. <b>But according to Rav,</b> who holds that it does render the bird a carcass, <b>what is added</b> by the word: <b>Any?</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: It is written <b>to add</b> pinching with the <b>left</b> hand <b>or</b> pinching at <b>night.</b> The Gemara challenges: The word: Any, is unnecessary with regard to teaching the cases of pinching with the <b>left</b> hand <b>and</b> pinching at <b>night,</b> as <b>they are taught</b> in the mishna <b>explicitly.</b> The Gemara answers: According to Rav, the word: Any, is not meant to add a specific case. Rather the mishna <b>teaches</b> the principle <b>and then explains</b> using specific examples.

### Part 16
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the continuation of the mishna: <b>This is the principle:</b> The meat of <b>any</b> bird <b>whose disqualification occurred</b> during the course of the service <b>in the sacred</b> Temple courtyard <b>does not render</b> the <b>garments</b> of one who swallows it <b>ritually impure</b> when the meat is <b>in the throat. Granted, according to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> the word: <b>Any,</b> is written <b>to add</b> that even the pinching of <b>a non-priest</b> does not render the bird a carcass. <b>But according to Rav,</b> who holds that it does render the bird a carcass, <b>what is added</b> by the word: Any?
