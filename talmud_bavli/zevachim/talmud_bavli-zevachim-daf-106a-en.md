### Part 1
<b>so too here,</b> the bull and goat of Yom Kippur are burned <b>east of Jerusalem.</b>

### Part 2
<b>But according to the Rabbis,</b> then, <b>where</b> outside Jerusalem <b>do they burn them?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Where are</b> the bulls and goats <b>burned?</b> They are burned <b>north of Jerusalem, outside of</b> the <b>three camps. Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: They are burned on the place of the ashes,</b> where the ashes from the altar were poured.

### Part 3
<b>Rava said: Who is the <i>tanna</i> who disagrees with Rabbi Yosei HaGelili? It is Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to bulls that are burned: <b>“Where the ashes are poured out [<i>shefekh hadeshen</i>] shall it be burned”</b> (Leviticus 4:12). This teaches <b>that ashes must be there</b> already when the bulls are burned. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says:</b> This verse teaches <b>that its place should slope [<i>meshupakh</i>]</b> downward so that ashes from the burning will slide downhill.

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>Perhaps they disagree</b> only <b>about</b> whether <b>the place must slope,</b> but Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov agrees that it must be the place where the ashes from the altar were deposited.

### Part 5
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the bull and goat of Yom Kippur: “And he who burns them shall wash his garments” (Leviticus 16:28). This teaches that only <b>the one who burns</b> them <b>renders</b> his <b>garments impure, but the one who kindles the fire does not render</b> his <b>garments impure, and the one who sets up the arrangement</b> of wood <b>does not render</b> his <b>garments impure. And who is</b> considered <b>the one who burns? One who assists at the</b> actual <b>time of burning.</b>

### Part 6
One <b>might</b> have thought that this priest <b>renders</b> his <b>garments impure even after</b> the bull and goat <b>become ash.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he who burns <b>them”</b> (Leviticus 16:28), teaching that <b>they,</b> the whole bull and goat, <b>render garments impure, but they do not render garments impure once they become ash. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The word “them” teaches that <b>they render garments impure,</b> but once <b>the flesh is incinerated they do not render garments impure.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> and the opinion of Rabbi Shimon? <b>Rava said:</b> The difference <b>between them is when he turned it into a charred</b> mass, and the form of the animal has become distorted, but has not actually become ash. The first <i>tanna</i> holds that at this stage the offering still transmits impurity, whereas Rabbi Shimon holds that it does not.
