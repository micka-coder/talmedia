### Part 1
The Gemara responds: The difference <b>between them</b> is that according to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef, if the water is raised at any point throughout the night, it is disqualified for sanctification prior to the day’s services. According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, the water is not disqualified unless the Basin is raised at the break of dawn, but the Sages issued a rabbinic <b>decree of sinking</b> the Basin into its pit all night <i>ab initio</i>, so that it would not be raised at dawn accidentally.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: Does Rabbi Yoḥanan really hold that the Basin must be sunk all night? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say:</b> If a priest <b>sanctified his hands</b> and feet in preparation <b>for the removal of the ashes</b> before dawn, then <b>the next day he does not need to sanctify</b> them again, <b>as he already sanctified</b> them <b>at the beginning of</b> the day’s <b>service?</b> Evidently, the Basin is raised before dawn.

### Part 3
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Granted, according to Rava, who interprets that</b> statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> that sanctification of the hands and feet is not disqualified overnight (see 20a), <b>this</b> statement that the Basin must be sunk all night is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that sanctification of the hands and feet is disqualified at dawn. Accordingly, he holds that the water in the Basin is disqualified as well.

### Part 4
<b>But according to Abaye, who interprets</b> that statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, the first statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi is <b>difficult</b> to reconcile <b>with</b> this other statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>What is different there that</b> one must <b>sink</b> the Basin all night, <b>and what is different here,</b> with regard to sanctification prior to removal of the ashes, <b>that</b> one does <b>not</b> need to <b>sink it?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara responds: There is no contradiction. Prior to removal of the ashes, one <b>raises</b> the Basin <b>and</b> then <b>sinks it again</b> so that it will not remain raised at dawn and render the water disqualified.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why</b> does Rabbi Yoḥanan say that the priest does <b>not sanctify</b> his hands and feet again <b>the next day?</b> If the water has not been disqualified, why would the priest need to avoid sanctifying his hands and feet with it? The Gemara responds: Rabbi Yoḥanan means to say that <b>he does not need to sanctify</b> them again for service on the same day, not that he is prohibited from doing so.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, if one raised the Basin at night and sank it again before dawn, it remains <b>fit for</b> sanctification prior to performing the offering’s <b>permitting factors</b> that day? If so, Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion <b>is</b> the same as that <b>of Rav Ḥisda.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara responds: The difference <b>between them</b> is that according to Rav Ḥisda, there is no <b>mitzva of sinking</b> the Basin into its pit throughout the night, whereas Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that there is a mitzva of sinking the Basin into its pit all night <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 9
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda from a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 28b): The priests <b>would not see</b> the priest performing the removal of the ashes, <b>nor would they hear his voice.</b> Rather, they were unaware of his actions <b>until they would hear the sound of the wood</b> with <b>which ben Katin made a mechanism for</b> sinking <b>the Basin</b> into water during the night. <b>And</b> when they heard the sound of the mechanism, <b>they would say</b> to each other: <b>The time for sanctifying hands and feet from the Basin has come.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What, is it not that</b> they heard the mechanism <b>raising</b> the Basin? <b>Apparently,</b> the mechanism would <b>sink it</b> during the night, in contradiction to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda, who holds that there was no need to sink it overnight.

### Part 10
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> they heard the mechanism <b>sinking</b> the Basin, which had been raised all night. The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the mechanism were <b>sinking it, would its sound be audible?</b> No mechanism is necessary to lower the Basin; it can simply be lowered with a chain. The Gemara responds: The priest would still <b>sink it by</b> using <b>a wheel,</b> which would make a sound.

### Part 11
The Gemara presents <b>another version</b> of the answer: The priest would deliberately <b>sink it by its wheel so that its sound would be audible, and</b> the other priests <b>would hear and come</b> to begin the service. The Gemara asks: <b>But wasn’t there Gevini</b> the <b>crier,</b> who would notify the priests of the beginning of the service? The Gemara responds: <b>They would make two conspicuous markers</b> for the beginning of the service: The sound of the wheel and the crier. Anyone <b>who heard from this</b> marker <b>would come, and</b> anyone who <b>heard from that</b> marker <b>would come.</b>

### Part 12
§ Having mentioned a <i>halakha</i> earlier (19b), the Gemara addresses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> With regard to <b>any Basin that does not contain enough</b> water <b>for four priests to sanctify</b> their hands and feet <b>from it,</b> the priests <b>may not sanctify</b> their hands and feet <b>with it, as it is stated: “That Moses and Aaron and his sons might wash</b> their hands and their feet <b>from it”</b> (Exodus 40:31).

### Part 13
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The priests may <b>sanctify</b> their hands and feet from <b>all vessels, whether they can hold a quarter</b><i>-log</i> of water
