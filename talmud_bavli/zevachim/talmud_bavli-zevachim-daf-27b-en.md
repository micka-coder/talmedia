### Part 1
<b>And our mishna is in accordance with the statement of the one who says: He may not gather it up.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And Rav Ḥisda</b> says that <b>Avimi says: Everyone concedes with regard to</b> the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed below</b> the red line <b>that</b> if <b>one placed it above</b> the red line <b>he may not gather it up</b> again. <b>And all the more so with regard to the</b> blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed above</b> the red line <b>that one placed below</b> the red line, <b>since the blood</b> placed <b>above</b> the red line will eventually run down the side of the altar and <b>reach below</b> the red line. <b>They disagree only with regard to</b> the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>that one placed outside</b> on the external altar, or blood that is to be placed <b>outside that one placed inside, as Rabbi Yosei says: He may gather it up,</b> as though it had spilled on the floor, <b>and Rabbi Shimon says: He may not gather it up,</b> because the blood was nevertheless placed on an altar.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: We learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>as well</b> that if the blood is misapplied on the altar it may not be gathered, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the verse states: <b>“This</b> is the law of the burnt offering: <b>It is that which goes up [<i>ha’ola</i>]</b> on the pyre upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:2), from which it is derived that a disqualified offering that ascended upon the altar shall not descend from it. <b>These</b> terms, i.e., “this,” “it,” and “that,” <b>are</b> three terms of <b>exclusion,</b> which serve <b>to exclude</b> three cases of disqualified offerings from this <i>halakha</i>: An offering that <b>was slaughtered at night,</b> one <b>whose blood was spilled, and</b> one <b>whose blood emerged outside the curtains,</b> i.e., the Temple courtyard. In these cases, even <b>if</b> the offering <b>ascended</b> upon the altar <b>it shall descend.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> From the term <b>“burnt offering [<i>ola</i>]” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a fit burnt offering</b> shall not descend. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>includes</b> an offering <b>that was slaughtered at night, or</b> one <b>whose blood was spilled, or</b> one <b>whose blood emerged outside the curtains, or</b> one <b>that was left overnight, or</b> one <b>that left</b> the courtyard, <b>or</b> one <b>that</b> became <b>impure, or</b> one <b>that was slaughtered</b> with intent to consume it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time or outside its</b> designated <b>area, or</b> an offering for <b>which an unfit</b> person <b>collected and sprinkled its blood, or</b> a case where <b>one placed</b> the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed above</b> the red line <b>below</b> it, <b>or</b> where <b>one placed</b> the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed below</b> the red line <b>above</b> it, <b>or</b> where <b>one placed</b> the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>outside</b> on the external altar, <b>or</b> where <b>one placed</b> the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed outside</b> the Sanctuary <b>inside</b> it, <b>or a Paschal offering or a sin offering that one slaughtered not for their sake? From where</b> is it derived that if these offerings ascended they shall not descend?

### Part 5
<b>The verse states: “The law of the burnt offering [<i>ha’ola</i>],”</b> literally: That which goes up. The verse <b>included</b> under <b>one law all</b> items <b>that ascend</b> upon the altar, teaching <b>that if they ascended</b> the altar, <b>they shall not descend.</b>

### Part 6
One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include even an animal that copulated with a person, or an animal that was the object of bestiality, or</b> an animal <b>that was set aside</b> for idol worship, <b>or</b> an animal <b>that was worshipped</b> as a deity, <b>or</b> an animal that was given as <b>payment</b> to a prostitute <b>or</b> as <b>the price</b> of a dog, <b>or</b> an animal born of a mixture of <b>diverse kinds, or</b> an animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, or</b> an animal <b>born by caesarean section. The verse</b> therefore <b>states: “This,”</b> to exclude these animals from the <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> as the reason <b>to include</b> the former cases <b>and to exclude</b> the latter ones? The Gemara responds: <b>I include these</b> former cases, <b>whose disqualification occurred in sanctity,</b> i.e., in the course of the Temple service, <b>and I exclude these</b> latter cases, <b>whose disqualification did not occur in sanctity</b> and were disqualified as offerings from the outset.

### Part 8
Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak continues: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that if <b>one placed</b> the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed below</b> the red line <b>above</b> it, <b>or</b> if <b>one placed</b> the blood that is to be placed <b>above</b> the red line <b>below</b> it, the offering does not descend from the altar. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda does not disagree,</b> even though he holds that if the blood spilled on the ground the offering descends from the altar. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Is it <b>not because</b> even if the blood was misapplied, <b>the altar has absorbed</b> the blood and it is not considered to have been spilled on the floor? <b>Conclude from it</b> that if blood was misapplied on the altar, the priest <b>may not gather it up</b> again, in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan.

### Part 9
§ Pursuant to the discussion of disqualified offerings that do not descend from the external altar, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The inner altar,</b> i.e., the golden altar inside the Sanctuary, <b>sanctifies disqualified</b> offerings such that if they ascended onto it, they do not descend.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this statement <b>teaching us? We</b> already <b>learn</b> this in the above <i>baraita</i>: If one placed the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed inside</b> the Sanctuary outside on the external altar, or if one placed the blood that is to be placed outside the Sanctuary inside it, on the golden altar, the offering does not descend.

### Part 11
The Gemara responds: <b>If</b> one were to learn the <i>halakha</i> only <b>from there, I would say: This matter</b> applies only to <b>blood</b> mistakenly placed on the golden altar, <b>as it is fit to</b> be placed on that altar in certain contexts, i.e., the blood of the bull and goat sin offerings on Yom Kippur; <b>but</b> with regard to <b>a handful</b> from a meal offering, <b>which is not fit to</b> be placed on the golden altar in any context, <b>I will say</b> that it is <b>not</b> sanctified when placed on it. Rabbi Eliezer therefore <b>teaches us</b> that even a handful from a meal offering does not descend from it.

### Part 12
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>strange incense,</b> i.e., incense that it is prohibited to burn on the golden altar, <b>ascended onto the altar, it shall descend, as only the external altar sanctifies disqualified</b> offerings that are <b>suited for it.</b> One can infer that the <b>external</b> altar <b>does</b> sanctify disqualified offerings, but the <b>inner</b> altar does <b>not.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara responds: <b>Answer like this:</b> The <i>baraita</i> means that if <b>strange incense ascended onto the external altar, it shall descend, as the external altar sanctifies only disqualified</b> offerings <b>that are suited for it. But the inner</b> altar sanctifies everything, <b>whether it is suited for it or it is not suited for it. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>This,</b> the external altar, is considered part of the <b>floor,</b> since it is fixed to the floor of the Temple, <b>and that,</b> the inner altar, is considered <b>a service vessel</b> with a higher level of sanctity.

### Part 14
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who slaughters the offering</b> with intent <b>to sprinkle its blood outside</b> the Temple <b>or</b> to sprinkle <b>part of its blood outside</b> the Temple, <b>to burn its sacrificial portions outside</b> the Temple <b>or</b> to burn <b>part of its sacrificial portions outside</b> the Temple, <b>to partake of its meat outside</b> the Temple <b>or</b> to partake of <b>an olive-bulk of its meat outside</b> the Temple, <b>or to partake of an olive-bulk of the skin of the tail outside</b> the Temple, in all of these cases the offering is <b>disqualified, and there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i> for</b> one who partakes of it.

### Part 15
But if one had intent <b>to sprinkle its blood the next day</b> or <b>part of its blood the next day, to burn its sacrificial portions the next day or</b> to burn <b>part of its sacrificial portions the next day, to partake of its meat the next day or</b> to partake of <b>an olive-bulk of its meat the next day, or to partake of an olive-bulk of the skin of the tail the next day,</b> the offering is <b><i>piggul</i>, and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> burning or partaking of <b>it.</b>

### Part 16
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The students <b>assumed</b> that <b>the skin of the tail</b>
