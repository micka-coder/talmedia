### Part 1
The Gemara returns to Ulla’s statement in the name of Reish Lakish (32b) that an impure individual who inserted his hand into the Temple courtyard is flogged, as partial entry is considered entry. An objection was then raised from the case of the leper, where he is not liable to be punished with <i>karet</i> for partial entry, and Ulla offered one answer. <b>Ravina says</b> that there is another answer: It <b>was stated</b> only <b>with regard to lashes,</b> teaching that one is flogged for partially entering the courtyard while ritually impure. Reish Lakish agrees that there is no punishment of <i>karet</i> for partial entry as there is for a full entry.

### Part 2
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that the statement of Reish Lakish with regard to this verse <b>was stated with regard to a ritually impure</b> individual <b>who touched sacrificial</b> food, and not with regard to partial entry into the courtyard, as Ulla had said.

### Part 3
This is <b>as it was stated:</b> There is an amoraic dispute with regard to <b>an impure person who touched sacrificial</b> food. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> He is <b>flogged. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He is not flogged.</b> The Gemara elaborates. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> He is <b>flogged,</b> as it is written: <b>“Every consecrated item she shall not touch”</b> (Leviticus 12:4). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He is not flogged,</b> as <b>that</b> verse <b>is written with regard to</b> touching <b>the portion of the produce designated for the priest [<i>teruma</i>].</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> does <b>Reish Lakish</b> actually hold that <b>this verse comes to</b> teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>He requires this</b> verse to teach <b>a prohibition for</b> a ritually impure person <b>who eats sacrificial meat. As it was stated: From where</b> is <b>the prohibition for</b> a ritually impure person <b>who eats sacrificial meat</b> derived? <b>Reish Lakish says</b> it is derived from the verse: <b>“Every consecrated item she shall not touch,”</b> which the Gemara will explain is referring to eating.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The Sage <b>Bardela teaches</b> that this prohibition is <b>derived from</b> a verbal analogy of the term <b>“his impu-rity [<i>tumato</i>]”</b> written with regard to one who eats sacrificial meat while impure (Leviticus 7:20), and the term <b>“his impurity [<i>tumato</i>]”</b> written with regard to one who <b>enters</b> the <b>Temple</b> while impure (Numbers 19:13). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to entering the Temple while impure, the Torah <b>prescribed</b> the <b>punishment</b> of <i>karet</i> <b>and</b> also explicitly <b>prohibited</b> doing so, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to eating sacrificial meat while impure, the Torah <b>prescribed</b> the <b>punishment</b> of <i>karet</i> <b>and</b> also explicitly <b>prohibited</b> doing so. Clearly, Reish Lakish understood this verse as referring to eating sacrificial meat, not merely touching it.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish holds that both can be derived from Leviticus 12:4. The prohibition with regard to <b>a ritually impure</b> individual <b>who touched sacrificial</b> food is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One expressed</b> this prohibition <b>with a term of touching,</b> while <b>the prohibition with regard to one who eats</b> sacrificial food while impure is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the Torah <b>juxtaposed</b> the prohibition of eating <b>sacrificial</b> food while impure <b>to</b> the prohibition of entering the <b>Temple</b> while impure in the verse: “Every consecrated item she shall not touch, and to the Temple she shall not come” (Leviticus 12:4).

### Part 7
The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish.</b> It is written: <b>“Every consecrated item she shall not touch”;</b> this is <b>a prohibition for</b> an impure person who <b>eats</b> sacrificial food. <b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>a prohibition for</b> an impure person who <b>eats</b> sacrificial food, <b>or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> a prohibition <b>for</b> an impure person who <b>touches</b> sacrificial food?

### Part 8
<b>The verse states: “Every consecrated item she shall not touch, and to the Temple she shall not come”</b> (Leviticus 12:4). The verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the matter pertaining to <b>sacrificial</b> food <b>to</b> the matter of entering the <b>Temple</b> while ritually impure. <b>Just as</b> entering the <b>Temple</b> is <b>a matter</b> that entails a punishment <b>that involves</b>
