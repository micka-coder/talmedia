### Part 1
Assuming that these priests had all been serving in the Temple through the night, one can ask: <b>Granted, according to Abaye, who interprets</b> the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>concedes that</b> during the period <b>from the rooster’s crow</b> before dawn <b>until morning,</b> being <b>left overnight does not disqualify</b> sanctification, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that although they served through the night, the previous day’s sanctification was disqualified and they must sanctify their hands and feet again in the morning, but they may do so before dawn.

### Part 2
<b>But according to Rava, who interprets</b> the statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, but</b> who holds that <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, during the period <b>from the rooster’s crow until morning</b> being <b>left overnight disqualifies</b> sanctification, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, then the priests’ sanctification described therein is useless, since being <b>left overnight disqualifies</b> it at dawn. And <b>if</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, doesn’t he say</b> that <b>even</b> if the priest continues to perform rites <b>for the next ten days, he does not need to sanctify</b> his hands and feet again? If so, since the priests were serving throughout the night, they should not require sanctification.

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, and here we are dealing with new priests,</b> who did not serve in the Temple that night. Since they are beginning their service now, they must sanctify their hands and feet.

### Part 4
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>leaving</b> the Temple? Is it <b>effective to</b> disqualify <b>sanctification of</b> the <b>hands and feet</b> such that the priest must sanctify them again when he reenters the Temple? The Gemara elaborates: <b>If you say</b> that being <b>left overnight does not disqualify</b> it, perhaps that is only <b>because he does not separate</b> from the Temple; <b>but</b> when <b>leaving</b> the Temple, <b>where</b> the priest <b>separates</b> from the Temple, it is possible that the priest <b>becomes distracted</b> from the service. If so, he must sanctify his hands and feet again. <b>Or perhaps, since it is in his power to return</b> to the Temple at any point, <b>he does not become distracted,</b> in which case he does not need to sanctify them again.

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If a priest <b>sanctified his hands and feet and</b> his hands then <b>became impure, he may immerse them</b> to purify them, <b>and he does not need to sanctify</b> them again. If he sanctified his hands and <b>they</b> then <b>left</b> the Temple, <b>they retain their sanctity.</b> Apparently, leaving the Temple does not disqualify sanctification.

### Part 6
The Gemara responds: <b>We do not raise the dilemma</b> with regard to a case where only <b>his hands left</b> the Temple. In such a case, he certainly does not need to sanctify them again. <b>When we raise the dilemma,</b> it is with regard to a case where <b>his entire body left</b> the Temple; <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in such a case?

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One whose hands and feet are not washed</b> must <b>sanctify</b> them <b>with a service vessel inside</b> the Temple. If he <b>sanctified</b> them <b>with a service vessel outside</b> the Temple, <b>or with a non-sacred vessel inside, or</b> if <b>he immersed in cave water and performed</b> the <b>service, his service is disqualified.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> his service is disqualified is <b>that he sanctified</b> his hands and feet <b>with a service vessel outside, but</b> if he <b>sanctified</b> them <b>inside and</b> then <b>left, his service is valid.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara responds: <b>Perhaps</b> one can say: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case where one <b>sanctified</b> them <b>with a service vessel outside?</b> It is a case <b>where he removed</b> only <b>his hands</b> and placed them <b>outside</b> the Temple <b>and sanctified</b> them there. <b>Consequently,</b> one can infer only that if <b>he sanctified</b> them <b>inside and</b> then <b>left,</b> i.e., specifically <b>where he removed</b> only <b>his hand</b> and placed it <b>outside,</b> his service is <b>valid. But</b> with regard to a case where <b>his entire body left</b> the Temple, <b>you should raise the dilemma.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Zevid said to Rav Pappa: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from another <i>baraita</i>: In a case where a priest <b>left the boundary of the wall of the Temple courtyard, if</b> he left long enough <b>to remain</b> there for a time, <b>he requires immersion. If</b> he left only <b>for a moment, he requires sanctification of</b> the <b>hands and feet.</b> Apparently, one who leaves even for a brief time requires sanctification.

### Part 10
Rav Pappa <b>said to him: Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>left</b> the Temple <b>to cover his legs,</b> a euphemism for defecating, <b>or to urinate.</b> It is only for this reason that he must sanctify his hands and feet when reentering the Temple.

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> the mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 28a) already <b>teaches it explicitly: Anyone who covers his legs requires immersion</b> afterward; <b>and anyone who urinates requires sanctification of</b> the <b>hands and feet</b> with water from the Basin afterward. The Gemara responds: The redundancy is not difficult. The <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the principle <b>and then explains</b> it again.

### Part 12
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following dispute: With regard to the priest who performs the service of the red <b>heifer,</b> which takes place outside the Temple, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef says:</b> In preparation, he must <b>sanctify</b> his hands and feet <b>with a service vessel inside</b> the Temple, as he must before any other service, <b>and</b> afterward he <b>leaves</b> the Temple to perform the service. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> He may sanctify his hands <b>even outside</b> of the Temple, <b>and even with a non-sacred vessel, and even with an earthenware bowl [<i>bimkeida</i>].</b> Apparently, leaving the Temple does not disqualify sanctification of the hands and feet.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The rite of the red <b>heifer is different, since all of its acts are</b> performed <b>outside</b> the Temple, unlike other rites. Therefore, <b>leaving</b> the Temple <b>does not disqualify</b> sanctification of the hands and feet <b>with regard to it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why do I</b> require <b>that</b> the priest <b>sanctify</b> his hands and feet at all for the service of the red heifer? The Gemara responds: The service of the red heifer must be <b>similar to</b> the <b>service</b> of offerings performed <b>inside</b> the Temple.

### Part 14
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a priest who contracts <b>ritual impurity</b> during the service? Is this <b>effective to</b> disqualify the <b>sanctification of</b> his <b>hands and feet</b> such that he must sanctify them again when he becomes pure? <b>If you say</b> that <b>leaving</b> the Temple <b>does not disqualify</b> sanctification, perhaps this is <b>because the person</b> remains <b>fit</b> to serve; <b>but here, where the person is unfit</b> for service, perhaps <b>he becomes distracted. Or perhaps, since he</b> will become <b>fit again</b> when he becomes pure, <b>he takes care not to become distracted.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If a priest <b>sanctified his hands and feet and they became impure, he</b> may <b>immerse them, and he does not need to sanctify</b> them again.

### Part 16
The Gemara responds: <b>We do not raise the dilemma</b> with regard to a case where only <b>his hands became impure. When we raise the dilemma</b> it is with regard to a case where <b>his entire body became impure.</b> The Gemara challenges: But if <b>his entire body</b> contracted impurity, <b>let me derive</b> that the sanctification is disqualified <b>since he needs to allow the sun to set</b> in order to become pure after immersing, and <b>he</b> certainly <b>becomes distracted</b> in the interim. The Gemara responds: The dilemma concerns a case <b>where he became impure adjacent to sunset,</b> so that he does not need to wait long after immersing and will not become distracted.

### Part 17
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following dispute: With regard to the priest who performs the rite of the red <b>heifer, Rabbi Ḥiyya, son of Rabbi Yosef, says:</b> He must <b>sanctify</b> his hands and feet <b>with a service vessel inside</b> the Temple, <b>and</b> afterward he <b>leaves</b> the Temple to perform the service. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> He may sanctify his hands <b>even outside</b> of the Temple, <b>and even with a non-sacred vessel, and even with an earthenware bowl.</b>
