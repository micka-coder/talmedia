### Part 1
<b>If</b> the verse means that he bears <b>the sin of <i>piggul</i>, it is already stated:</b> “And if any of the flesh of his peace offerings be at all eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, <b>neither shall it be credited</b> to he who offers it” (Leviticus 7:18). <b>If</b> he bears <b>the sin of <i>notar</i>, it is already stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“It shall not be accepted.”</b>

### Part 2
Rather, the frontplate <b>bears only the sin of impurity, whose general prohibition was permitted in</b> cases involving <b>the pub-lic.</b> The verse indicates that the frontplate effects acceptance for individual offerings sacrificed in a state of ritual impurity.

### Part 3
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> is the <b>impurity</b> borne by the frontplate? <b>If we say</b> that it effects acceptance <b>for impurity due to a creeping animal, where</b> does one find that the general prohibition was <b>permitted</b> in cases involving the public? <b>Rather,</b> it must be referring to <b>impurity due to a corpse. And</b> is it <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where the owner</b> of the offerings <b>became impure from a corpse? Evidently,</b> if <b>the owner became impure from a corpse, he may send his offerings</b> for sacrifice, as the frontplate effects acceptance for them.

### Part 4
<b>And to what</b> offering is this statement referring? <b>If</b> it is referring <b>to</b> the offering of <b>a nazirite,</b> doesn’t <b>the Merciful One state: “And if any man die</b> very suddenly <b>beside him,</b> and he defile his consecrated head” (Numbers 6:9)? The passage indicates that even if a nazirite contracts impurity against his will, he still cannot bring his offerings until he is pure. <b>Rather,</b> it must be referring <b>to one who performs</b> the rite of the <b>Paschal offering.</b> This proves the claim of the Elders of the South that one who is impure due to a corpse may send his Paschal offering for sacrifice.

### Part 5
The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> the statement is referring <b>to</b> impurity due to <b>a creeping animal,</b> not due to a corpse. <b>And</b> although the general prohibition with regard to impurity due to a creeping animal was not permitted in cases involving the public, nevertheless, one finds that <b>the category of impurity in general</b> was permitted in such cases.

### Part 6
The Gemara notes: <b>And some infer</b> the opposite <b>and derive like this:</b> The verse states of the frontplate: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead, and Aaron shall bear the sin committed with the sacred items” (Exodus 28:38). That is, it <b>does</b> bear <b>the iniquity of the sacred items,</b> but it does <b>not</b> bear <b>the iniquity of those who consecrate</b> or sacrifice them, i.e., the owners of the offering or the priests involved in its sacrifice. And to <b>what impurity</b> is this verse referring? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring to <b>impurity</b> due to <b>a creeping animal, is</b> such impurity <b>permitted in</b> cases involving the <b>public? Rather, is it not</b> referring to <b>impurity</b> due to <b>a corpse, and</b> the verse indicates that the frontplate <b>does</b> bear <b>the iniquity of</b> the <b>sacred items</b> but does <b>not</b> bear <b>the iniquity of those who consecrate</b> them? This refutes the opinion of the Elders of the South that owners who are impure due to a corpse may send their offerings.

### Part 7
The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> the verse is referring to <b>impurity due to a creeping animal, and</b> although the general prohibition with regard to impurity due to a creeping animal was not permitted in cases involving the public, <b>the category of impurity in general</b> was permitted in such cases.

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches that a priest who is <b>sitting</b> disqualifies the rites that he performs. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: The verse states</b> with regard to the priests: “For the Lord your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, <b>to stand to minister”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:5). The verse indicates that <b>I have chosen him for standing and not for sitting.</b>

### Part 9
<b>The Sages taught: “To stand to minister,”</b> indicates that there is <b>a mitzva</b> to perform the service while standing. <b>When it says:</b> “Then he shall minister in the name of the Lord his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, <b>who stand</b> there before the Lord” (Deuteronomy 18:7), <b>the verse repeats</b> the matter <b>to invalidate</b> rites that are performed while not standing.

### Part 10
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: Now, one who is sitting is considered like a non-priest and desecrates</b> the <b>service.</b> Therefore, <b>I will say: Just as a non-priest</b> who performs a rite is liable <b>to</b> receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>so too one who is sitting</b> should be liable <b>to</b> receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven. If so, <b>why is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>But one who is uncircumcised, an acute mourner,</b> and <b>one who is sitting are not</b> liable <b>to</b> receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven if they performed rites; <b>rather,</b> they simply transgress <b>a prohibition?</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara responds: That is taught <b>because</b> the case of a priest <b>lacking</b> the requisite priestly <b>vestments and</b> that of <b>one whose hands and feet are not washed are two verses that come as one,</b> as the verse states explicitly for each case that if they perform rites they are liable to receive death at the hand of Heaven.
