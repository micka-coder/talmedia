### Part 1
<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, says:</b> Both <b>this and that,</b> i.e., the blood of an inner sin offering and that of an external sin offering, were poured at the <b>western base</b> of the altar. According to this version, Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai agrees with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. The Gemara comments: <b>And your mnemonic</b> to remember this change in opinion is: <b>The men pulled the man.</b> In this case, the numerous students of Rabbi Yishmael claim that Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai agrees with their teacher.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The burnt offering</b> is <b>an offering of the most sacred order. Its slaughter</b> is <b>in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard <b>and the collection of its blood in a service vessel</b> is <b>in the north, and its blood requires two placements that are four, and</b> it <b>requires flaying</b> of its carcass <b>and the cutting</b> of the sacrificial animal into pieces, <b>and</b> it is consumed <b>in its entirety,</b> with the exception of its hide, <b>by the fire</b> of the altar.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> that <b>a burnt offering</b> is <b>an offering of the most sacred order,</b> when the mishna earlier (52b) did not mention that a sin offering is of the most sacred order? The Gemara answers: It is <b>because</b> in the Torah <b>it is not written</b> explicitly <b>with regard to</b> the burnt offering: <b>It is most sacred,</b> as it states concerning the sin offering and the guilt offering in a verse concerning a meal offering: “It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it as their portion of My offerings made by fire; it is most sacred, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering” (Leviticus 6:10). Consequently, the <i>tanna</i> explicitly states that a burnt offering is likewise of the most sacred order.

### Part 4
The mishna teaches: <b>And its blood requires two placements</b> that are four. <b>How does</b> the priest <b>perform</b> the placements? <b>Rav says: He places</b> the blood on one side of the corner of the altar, <b>and places</b> it <b>again</b> on the other side of the corner of the altar. He repeats this on the diagonally opposite corner, so that he places on two corners but on all four sides of the altar. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> He <b>places one placement</b> on each of the two diagonally opposite corners, so that each placement is <b>similar to</b> the shape of the Greek letter <b>gamma,</b> which is bent at a right angle.

### Part 5
The Gemara comments: This dispute between Rav and Shmuel is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that a priest <b>should sprinkle one sprinkling</b> with the blood of a burnt offering. To counter this possibility, <b>the verse states:</b> “And sprinkle the blood <b>around</b> against the altar that is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 1:5). <b>If</b> the blood must be sprinkled <b>around</b> the altar, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should circumscribe</b> the altar <b>as</b> one would do with <b>a thread,</b> and sprinkle the blood all around. To counter this possibility, <b>the verse states:</b> “Shall present the blood, <b>and sprinkle</b> the blood around against the altar” (Leviticus 1:5), and one cannot have the blood circumscribe the altar as a thread would without directly applying it with a finger. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> verses be reconciled? He applies the blood in a shape that is <b>similar to</b> that of the Greek letter <b>gamma, and its blood requires two sprinklings that are four.</b> This opinion accords with the opinion of Shmuel.

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: It is stated here:</b> “Shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood <b>around</b> against the altar” (Leviticus 1:5), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the sin offering sacrificed at the inauguration of the Tabernacle: “And when it was slain, Moses took the blood, and put it upon the corners of the altar <b>around</b> with his finger” (Leviticus 8:15). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the sin offering, the blood was placed <b>discretely and</b> with <b>four placements,</b> one on each corner, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to a burnt offering, it must be placed <b>discretely and</b> with <b>four placements.</b> This opinion accords with the opinion of Rav.

### Part 7
<b>If</b> these offerings are compared to each other, why not say that <b>just as there,</b> the blood of the sin offering must have <b>four placements on</b> the <b>four corners, so too here,</b> the blood of the burnt offering requires <b>four placements on</b> the <b>four corners? You said</b> that <b>a burnt offering requires</b> that the blood be placed on a part of the altar that has <b>a base, and</b> the <b>southeast corner</b> of the altar <b>had no base</b> beneath it. Therefore, the blood had to be placed on the northeast corner and the southwest corner.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that there was no base on the southeast corner of the altar? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Because it was not in the portion</b> of land <b>of the one who tears,</b> i.e., the tribe of Benjamin, as he is described in the following manner: “Benjamin is a wolf that tears apart; in the morning he devours the prey, and in the evening he divides the spoil” (Genesis 49:27). <b>As Rav Shmuel, son of Rav Yitzḥak, says:</b> The <b>altar</b> would <b>consume,</b> i.e., occupy, <b>one cubit of the portion of Judah.</b> The part of the altar in Judah’s portion was the southeast corner of the base, and therefore there was no base on that corner.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Levi bar Ḥama says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: A strip</b> of land <b>emerged from the portion of Judah and entered into the portion of Benjamin,</b> and the southeast corner of the base was on that strip. <b>And</b> the tribe of <b>Benjamin the righteous would agonize over it every day,</b> desiring <b>to take it</b> into its portion, due to its unique sanctity. <b>As it is stated</b> in Moses’ blessing to the tribe of Benjamin:
