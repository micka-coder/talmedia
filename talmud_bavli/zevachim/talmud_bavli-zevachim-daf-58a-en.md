### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> It was taught in the previous chapter that offerings of the most sacred order are to be slaughtered in the northern section of the Temple courtyard. With regard to <b>offerings of the most sacred order that one slaughtered atop the altar, Rabbi Yosei says:</b> Their status is <b>as though they were slaughtered in the north,</b> and the offerings are therefore valid. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> The status of the area <b>from the halfway point of the altar and to the south</b> is <b>like</b> that of <b>the south,</b> and offerings of the most sacred order slaughtered in that area are therefore disqualified. The status of the area <b>from the halfway point of the altar and to the north</b> is <b>like</b> that of <b>the north.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Yosei used to say: The entire altar stands in the north</b> section of the Temple courtyard. The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> is the meaning of Rabbi Yosei’s statement that if one slaughtered offerings of the most sacred order atop the altar it is <b>as though</b> they were slaughtered in the north, which indicates that they were not actually slaughtered in the north? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yosei said this <b>lest you say</b> that <b>we require</b> that the offering be slaughtered <b>“on the side</b> of the altar northward” (Leviticus 1:11), i.e., on the ground beside the altar, <b>and</b> that requirement <b>is not</b> fulfilled when it is slaughtered on top of the altar. Therefore, Rabbi Yosei <b>teaches us</b> that the offering is still valid.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rav Asi:</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan apparently understands that the reason Rabbi Yosei holds that an offering of the most sacred order slaughtered on the altar is valid is because the entire altar is in the northern section of the Temple courtyard. <b>If that is so,</b> shall one <b>also</b> say <b>that according to Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, half of</b> the altar was situated <b>in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard <b>and half of it</b> was situated <b>in the south?</b>

### Part 4
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed</b> that is so, <b>wasn’t it you who said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, concedes that if one slaughtered</b> offerings of the most sacred order <b>on the ground opposite</b> the northern half of the altar, the offering is <b>disqualified?</b> Accordingly, Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, apparently maintains that the altar is not located in the north at all.

### Part 5
Rav Asi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement with regard to Rabbi Yosei’s opinion is an independent statement rather than an inference from the mishna. And with regard to the dispute in the mishna, <b>this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Both of them derived</b> their opinions <b>from one verse:</b> “An altar of earth you shall make for Me, <b>and you shall slaughter upon it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings”</b> (Exodus 20:21).

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yosei maintains</b> that the verse teaches that <b>all of it,</b> i.e., the entire altar, is fit <b>for</b> slaughtering <b>a burnt offering, and all of it</b> is also fit <b>for</b> slaughtering <b>a peace offering. And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, maintains</b> that the verse teaches that <b>half of it</b> is fit <b>for</b> slaughtering <b>a burnt offering and half of it</b> is fit <b>for</b> slaughtering <b>a peace offering.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara explains the reasoning of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda: <b>As if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> that <b>all of it is fit for</b> slaughtering <b>a burnt offering, now</b> that <b>all of it is fit for</b> slaughtering <b>a burnt offering,</b> which must be slaughtered in the northern section of the Temple courtyard (see 53b), <b>is it necessary</b> to teach that it is also fit <b>for</b> slaughtering <b>a peace offering,</b> which may be slaughtered anywhere in the Temple courtyard (see 55a)? The verse therefore must be understood as teaching that half the altar is fit for slaughtering burnt offerings and half is fit for slaughtering peace offerings.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Yosei, respond to this reasoning? The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> for the verse to mention peace offerings. Otherwise, it could <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the verse allows one to slaughter only <b>a burnt offering</b> atop the altar, <b>as the location</b> where <b>it</b> may be slaughtered on the ground is <b>narrow. But</b> with regard to <b>peace offerings, whose location</b> for slaughter on the ground is <b>not narrow, say</b> that <b>no,</b> one may not slaughter them atop the altar. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that peace offerings as well may be slaughtered atop the altar.

### Part 9
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, concedes that if one slaughtered</b> offerings of the most sacred order <b>on the ground opposite</b> the northern half of the altar, the offering is <b>disqualified. Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>On the ground opposite</b> the northern half of the altar? <b>If we say</b> it means that the offering was sacrificed upon the <b>cubit</b>-wide <b>base</b> of the altar or upon the <b>cubit</b>-wide <b>surrounding ledge</b> of the altar, <b>this itself is</b> part of the <b>altar. And furthermore, what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>On the ground opposite</b> the northern half of the altar? The base and ledge are not on the ground.

### Part 10
<b>And if you would say</b> that the case is <b>where one dug tunnels in the ground</b> beneath the altar, <b>and slaughtered</b> the offerings <b>in them, in a case like this would</b> the <b>altar</b> itself <b>be</b> fit for use so that according to Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, one may slaughter the offerings of the most sacred order on the altar but not on the ground? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“An altar of earth you shall make for Me”</b> (Exodus 20:21)? This verse indicates <b>that</b> the altar <b>must be attached to the earth,</b> so <b>that one may not build it on top of tunnels nor on top of arches.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to have the phrase: On the ground opposite the northern half of the altar, in order to teach the <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where one minimized</b> the dimensions of the altar and slaughtered the offerings on the ground where the northern half of the altar had previously stood.

### Part 12
§ The Gemara returns to discuss Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that according to Rabbi Yosei the entire altar was located in the northern section of the Temple courtyard. The Gemara had mentioned that Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is an independent statement, not based on the mishna. <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Is it <b>possible</b> that <b>this</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan is</b> correct <b>and we did not learn it in</b> any <b>mishna?</b>

### Part 13
Rabbi Zeira <b>went out, examined</b> the matter, <b>and discovered</b> a mishna that alludes to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 2:5): The priests <b>selected fine wood of a fig tree from</b> the chamber of firewood, with which <b>to lay out a second arrangement</b> of wood on the altar so that coals from this arrangement could be used <b>for</b> burning the <b>incense.</b> This second arrangement was located <b>opposite</b> the <b>southwest corner</b> of the altar, <b>distanced from</b> the <b>corner northward</b> by <b>four cubits.</b> They would arrange enough wood which, when burned, would produce <b>approximately five <i>se’a</i></b> of <b>coals. And on Shabbat,</b> there was enough wood to produce <b>approximately eight <i>se’a</i></b> of <b>coals, as they would place there the two bowls of frankincense of the shewbread.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the</b> significance of the mishna’s <b>defining</b> the precise location of the arrangement and the fact that this is where the frankincense is burned? The Gemara embarks on a lengthy discussion to answer this question: This mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who holds that this arrangement of wood and the burning of the frankincense must be in that precise location, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:
