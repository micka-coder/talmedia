### Part 1
I might have thought that <b>the priests have no right to its hide.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The hide of the burnt offering,”</b> to teach that <b>in any case</b> where the offering is not disqualified, the priests acquire its hide, even if it did not satisfy the owner’s obligation.

### Part 2
And from the phrase <b>“the hide of the burnt offering” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the priests acquire <b>the hide of the burnt offering. From where</b> do I derive that they acquire <b>the hides of</b> all <b>offerings of the most sacred order? The verse states: “The hide of the burnt offering which he has offered,”</b> which serves to include any offering that the priests sacrifice. If so, one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I include even offerings of lesser sanctity.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Burnt offering,”</b> and not simply: Offering, to teach that <b>just as a burnt offering is an offering of the most sacred order, so too</b> the priests acquire the hides only of <b>all offerings of the most sacred order;</b> they do not acquire the hides of offerings of lesser sanctity.

### Part 3
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yishmael says</b> there is a different derivation. From the phrase <b>“the hide of the burnt offering,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the priests acquire the hide of <b>the burnt offering. From where</b> is it derived that they acquire <b>the hides of</b> all <b>offerings of the most sacred order? It is</b> based on <b>a logical inference: Just as</b> in the case of <b>a burnt offering, for which</b> the priests <b>do not acquire its meat,</b> the priests nevertheless <b>acquire its hide,</b> then in the case of <b>offerings of the most sacred order, for which</b> the priests <b>do acquire its meat, is it not logical that</b> they <b>acquire their hides?</b>

### Part 4
One may counter: Let the <b>altar prove</b> that this is not a valid <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>as it acquires the meat, and</b> still <b>it does not acquire the hide.</b> One may respond: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about the altar?</b> It is notable <b>in that it does not acquire</b> hides <b>in any</b> instance. <b>Will you say</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning the altar should teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>concerning</b> the <b>priests, who acquire</b> hides of <b>some of</b> the offerings, as the Torah explicitly grants them the hides of burnt offerings? Rather say: <b>Since</b> the priests <b>acquire</b> hides of <b>some of</b> the offerings, <b>they acquire</b> the hides of <b>all</b> offerings of the most sacred order.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> There is no need to derive that hides of offerings of the most sacred order go to the priests. <b>We need</b> the verse <b>itself only to</b> teach that this is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the hide of the burnt offering. As</b> the Torah does not generally require that an offering be flayed, <b>in all</b> other <b>cases the hide</b> of the offering <b>follows the flesh</b> of the offering.

### Part 6
For example, <b>bulls that are burned and goats that are burned</b> must be burned <b>themselves, and their hides burned with them,</b> as the Torah states explicitly (see Leviticus 4:11–12). <b>A sin offering, and a guilt offering, and a communal peace offering</b> are given as <b>a gift to the priest</b> (see Leviticus 7:7); if the priests <b>want,</b> they may <b>flay them</b> and use the hides, and if they <b>do not want</b> to use the hides, they may <b>eat</b> the offerings <b>together with their hides. Offerings of lesser sanctity</b> are given <b>to the owners;</b> if they <b>want,</b> they may <b>flay them</b> and use the hides, and if they <b>want,</b> they may <b>eat</b> the offerings <b>together with their hides.</b>

### Part 7
<b>But with regard to a burnt offering it is stated: “And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into its pieces”</b> (Leviticus 1:6). One <b>might</b> have thought that, because all the flesh of the burnt offering is burned on the altar, <b>the priests have no right to its hide.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “The priest shall have to himself <b>the hide of the burnt offering that he has sacrificed”</b> (Leviticus 7:8).

### Part 8
The phrase “the priest <b>shall have to himself”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> a priest <b>who immersed that day and</b> a priest <b>who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering, <b>and an acute mourner,</b> i.e., meaning that they do not receive a share of the hides, just as they do not receive a share of the meat. <b>As</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that although these priests <b>will not acquire the meat,</b> this is <b>because it is for consumption,</b> and they are not permitted to partake of it; but <b>they will acquire the hide, because it is not for consumption.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Shall have to himself,” to exclude</b> a priest <b>who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering, <b>and</b> a priest <b>who immersed that day, and an acute mourner.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>But let the first <i>tanna</i> also derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>logically,</b> as Rabbi Yishmael did. Why did he cite a verse? The Gemara answers: Often when there is <b>a matter that can be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, the <b>verse</b> nevertheless <b>takes the trouble and writes it</b> explicitly.

### Part 10
<b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yishmael, what does he do with this</b> phrase: “The hide of the burnt offering <b>that he has sacrificed,”</b> from which the first <i>tanna</i> derives the <i>halakha</i>? He holds that it serves <b>to exclude</b> a priest <b>who immersed that day, and</b> a priest <b>who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering, <b>and an acute mourner,</b> who do not receive a share in the hides.

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges: <b>But let</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the phrase: <b>“Shall have to himself,”</b> as does Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> that the phrase teaches a different <i>halakha</i>. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> It <b>is stated: “Shall have to himself”</b> (Leviticus 7:8), <b>with regard to a burnt offering, and</b> it <b>is stated:</b> “The priest that makes atonement, <b>he shall have to himself”</b> (Leviticus 7:7), <b>with regard to a guilt offering.</b> The following verbal analogy is derived from here: <b>Just as there,</b> after the blood of a guilt offering is presented, <b>its bones</b> become <b>permitted</b> to the priest for any use, since only the portions intended for consumption on the altar are sacrificed whereas the rest of the animal is given to the priests, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to a burnt offering, <b>its bones</b> that are not attached to the flesh and are therefore not intended for the altar <b>are permitted.</b>

### Part 12
With regard to this verbal analogy the Gemara comments: It must be that those terms <b>are free,</b> i.e., superfluous in their context and therefore available for the purpose of establishing a verbal analogy. <b>As, if they are not free,</b> the verbal analogy <b>can be refuted</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a guilt offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that its meat is permitted</b> to the priests, unlike the flesh of a burnt offering, which is burned upon the altar, and perhaps this is why the bones of a guilt offering are also permitted. Since the phrase: <b>“Shall have it to himself,” is a superfluous</b> term in each <b>verse,</b> the analogy stands, because a verbal analogy based on free terms cannot be refuted logically.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>any offerings</b> of the most sacred order <b>were disqualified prior to their flaying, their hides do not</b> go <b>to the priests;</b> rather, they are burned together with the flesh in the place of burning. If they were disqualified <b>after their flaying, their hides</b> go <b>to the priests. Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy High Priest, said: In</b> all <b>my days, I never saw a hide going out to the place of burning.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Akiva said: From the statement of</b> Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy High Priest, <b>we learned that</b> in a case where <b>one flays the firstborn</b> offering, <b>and</b> the animal is later <b>discovered to have a wound that would have caused it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that the priests may derive benefit [<i>sheye’otu</i>] from its hide. And the Rabbis say:</b> The claim: <b>We did not see, is no proof; rather,</b> if after flaying it is discovered that the animal was unfit before it was flayed, the hide <b>goes out to the place of burning.</b>

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The previous mishna (103a) teaches: In the case of <b>any</b> burnt offering <b>for which the altar did not acquire its flesh,</b> e.g., if it was disqualified prior to the sprinkling of its blood, <b>the priests did not acquire its hide.</b> The mishna does not state any qualification, indicating that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even if</b> the priest <b>flayed the hide before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood on the altar. The Gemara posits: <b>Whose</b> opinion is this? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who says: The blood does not effect acceptance of the hide by itself;</b> i.e., it effects acceptance of the hide only together with the flesh. Since the flesh is disqualified and the sprinkling does not effect its acceptance, the sprinkling does not effect acceptance for the hide either.

### Part 16
The Gemara challenges: <b>Say the latter clause,</b> i.e., the mishna here: If <b>any offerings</b> of the most sacred order <b>were disqualified prior to their flaying, their hides do not</b> go <b>to the priests.</b> If they were disqualified <b>after their flaying, their hides</b> go <b>to the priests.</b> This indicates that once the hides are flayed, they go to the priests even if the flesh was disqualified before the sprinkling of the blood. If so, <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who says: The blood effects acceptance of the hide,</b> i.e., renders the hide permitted to the priests, <b>by itself.</b> Can it be that <b>the former clause</b> of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> and <b>the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi?

### Part 17
<b>Abaye said: Since the latter clause</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, it must be that <b>the former clause is also</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And</b> although Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that in principle the priests should acquire the hides if they are removed before the flesh is disqualified, in any case <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>concedes that</b> the <b>flaying is not</b> done <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling.</b> Since the offering cannot be disqualified before the hide is removed, practically speaking, the priests will never acquire the hides unless the altar acquires the flesh, as taught in the former clause.

### Part 18
<b>Rava said:</b> On the contrary, <b>since the former clause</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> it must be that <b>the latter clause is also</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon.</b> When the mishna states that the priests acquire the hides if the flesh was disqualified after the flaying, it must mean that the flesh was disqualified after the sprinkling. Therefore, <b>what</b> does the mishna mean by the phrase: <b>Before flaying,</b>
