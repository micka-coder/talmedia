### Part 1
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of them,</b> in a case <b>where they collected the blood</b> with the intent to offer it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time or outside its</b> designated <b>area, if there is blood of the soul</b> that remains in the animal, <b>the</b> priest <b>fit</b> for Temple service <b>should again collect</b> the blood and sprinkle it on the altar.

### Part 2
If <b>the</b> priest <b>fit</b> for Temple service <b>collected</b> the blood in a vessel <b>and gave</b> the vessel <b>to an unfit</b> person, that person <b>should return</b> it <b>to the fit</b> priest. If the priest <b>collected</b> the blood in a vessel <b>in his right</b> hand <b>and moved</b> it <b>to his left</b> hand, <b>he should return</b> it <b>to his right</b> hand. If the priest <b>collected</b> the blood <b>in a sacred vessel and placed it in a non-sacred vessel, he should return</b> the blood <b>to a sacred vessel.</b> If the blood <b>spilled from the vessel onto the floor and he gathered it</b> from the floor, it is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 3
If an unfit person <b>placed</b> the blood <b>upon the ramp</b> or on the wall of the altar <b>that</b> is <b>not opposite the base</b> of the altar, or if <b>he placed</b> the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed below</b> the red line <b>above</b> the red line, <b>or</b> if he placed the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed above</b> the red line <b>below</b> the red line, <b>or</b> if he placed the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>outside</b> the Sanctuary <b>or the</b> blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed outside</b> the Sanctuary <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary, then <b>if there is blood of the soul</b> that remains in the animal, <b>the</b> priest <b>fit</b> for Temple service <b>should again collect</b> the blood and sprinkle it on the altar.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the use of the past tense in the mishna: With regard to all those who are unfit for Temple service who <b>slaughtered,</b> that <b>after the fact, yes,</b> the slaughter is valid. But <b><i>ab initio</i>, no,</b> those who are unfit may not slaughter an offering.

### Part 5
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from what was taught in the halakhic midrash <i>Torat Kohanim</i>: The verse states with regard to a burnt offering: <b>“And he shall slaughter</b> the bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:5). The fact that the verse does not stipulate that a priest must slaughter the offering teaches that <b>slaughter is valid</b> if performed <b>by a non-priest,</b> as stated in the mishna: <b>As the</b> sacrificial rite of <b>slaughter is valid</b> when performed <b>by non-priests, by women, by</b> Canaanite <b>slaves, and by ritually impure</b> individuals, <b>and even with</b> regard to <b>offerings of the most sacred order. Or</b> perhaps the term “and he shall slaughter” in the verse is referring <b>only</b> to slaughter <b>by priests?</b>

### Part 6
<b>You</b> can <b>say</b> in response: <b>From where did you come</b> to the idea that the verse is referring only to a priest? It is <b>from the fact that it is stated</b> to Aaron: <b>“And you and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood in everything that pertains to the altar”</b> (Numbers 18:7).

### Part 7
One <b>might</b> have thought that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even with</b> regard to <b>slaughter,</b> that only priests are fit to slaughter an offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he shall slaughter the bull before the Lord, and</b> Aaron’s sons, the priests, <b>shall present [<i>vehikrivu</i>]</b> the blood” (Leviticus 1:5), from which it is inferred that specifically <b>from</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood <b>and onward</b> it is <b>a mitzva</b> exclusively <b>of the priesthood.</b> This <b>teaches about the</b> rite of <b>slaughter that it is valid</b> <i>ab initio</i> if performed <b>by any person.</b> This contradicts the inference from the mishna that slaughter of an offering by a non-priest is valid only after the fact.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>The same is true that even <i>ab initio</i> as well</b> it is permitted for those unfit for Temple service to slaughter an offering, <b>but because</b> the mishna <b>wants to teach</b> with regard to the <b>ritually impure that</b> they may <b>not</b> slaughter an offering <b><i>ab initio</i></b> due to a rabbinic <b>decree lest they touch the flesh</b> and render it ritually impure, therefore the mishna <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> with the expression in the past tense: <b>Who slaughtered,</b> i.e., after the fact.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in the case of <b>a ritually impure</b> individual who performed the slaughter, is it <b>permitted</b> even <b>after the fact? And</b> one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from what is taught in the halakhic midrash: The Torah states two consecutive directives: <b>“And he shall place</b> his hand upon the head of the burnt offering…<b>And he shall slaughter</b> the bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:4–5). This juxtaposition indicates that both directives are referring to the same individual, which teaches that <b>just as placing hands</b> on the head of an offering may be performed only <b>by ritually pure</b> individuals, <b>so too,</b> the <b>slaughter</b> may be performed only <b>by ritually pure</b> individuals. The Gemara answers: <b>By rabbinic law,</b> an impure person is prohibited from slaughtering an offering lest he touch the flesh of the offering, but by Torah law the slaughter is valid.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>placing hands</b> that it can be performed only by those who are ritually pure even by Torah law? It is <b>that it is written: “Before the Lord,”</b> which is referring to the Temple courtyard, and an impure person may not enter the Temple courtyard. With regard to <b>slaughter as well, isn’t it written: “Before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 1:5)? How can a ritually impure person enter the Temple courtyard to slaughter an offering? The Gemara answers: It is <b>possible,</b> in a case <b>where he fashions a long knife,</b> stands outside the Temple courtyard, <b>and slaughters</b> the offering that is inside the courtyard.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>placing hands also, it is possible,</b> in a case <b>where he inserts his hands</b> into the Temple courtyard <b>and places</b> them on the head of the offering. The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>a partial entry,</b> in which only a part of the body enters the Temple courtyard, <b>is called entry.</b> Therefore, an impure individual may not insert even part of his body, such as his hands, into the Temple courtyard.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Ḥisda taught the</b> <i>baraita</i> in the <b>opposite</b> manner: <b>“And he shall place</b> his hand upon the head of the burnt offering…<b>and he shall slaughter</b> the bull” (Leviticus 1:4–5), teaches that <b>just as slaughter</b> may be performed only <b>by ritually pure</b> individuals, <b>so too, placing hands</b> may be performed only <b>by ritually pure</b> individuals. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>slaughter</b> that it may be performed only by those who are ritually pure? It is <b>that it is written</b> with regard to it: <b>“Before the Lord,”</b> which refers to the Temple courtyard, and a ritually impure person may not enter the Temple courtyard.
