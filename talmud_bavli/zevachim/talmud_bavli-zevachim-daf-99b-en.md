<b>and a shovel</b> was <b>in</b> the basket, <b>and he said: I am minding the basket,</b> that it not become impure, <b>but I am not minding the shovel,</b> then <b>the basket is pure, and the shovel is impure.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara challenges the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But</b> wouldn’t <b>the shovel render the basket impure?</b> The Gemara answers: There is a principle that <b>a vessel does not render</b> another <b>vessel ritually impure.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> wouldn’t <b>the shovel render that which is in</b> the basket, e.g., figs, <b>impure? Rava said:</b> The case is <b>where he says: I safeguarded it,</b> the shovel, <b>from anything that</b> would allow it to <b>render</b> another item <b>impure, but I did not safeguard it from anything that would render it</b> itself <b>unfit,</b> i.e., impure.

### Part 3
The Gemara returns to discuss the contradiction between the mishna, which permits an acute mourner to touch sacrificial meat, and the mishna in tractate <i>Ḥagiga</i>, which requires him to immerse. The Gemara relates: <b>The matter circulated and came before Rabbi Abba bar Memel. He said to</b> the Sages before him: <b>Have they not heard that which Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One who partakes of <i>teruma</i></b> that has <b>third-</b>degree impurity, i.e., <i>teruma</i> disqualified through contact with an item with second-degree impurity, <b>is prohibited from partaking</b> of <i>teruma</i>, <b>but permitted to touch</b> <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 4
Rabbi Abba bar Memel continued: <b>Apparently, in</b> a case of <b>partaking, the Sages imposed a higher standard,</b> whereas <b>in</b> a case of <b>touching, the Sages did not impose a higher standard.</b> Similarly, in a case of an acute mourner, the Sages require him to immerse before he may partake of sacrificial meat, as taught in tractate <i>Ḥagiga</i>, but they do not impose this standard for touching the meat, as taught in the mishna here.

### Part 5
§ The mishna teaches with regard to an acute mourner: <b>And he does not receive a share</b> of sacrificial meat in order <b>to partake</b> of it in the evening. The Gemara comments: The mishna indicates only that <b>he may not receive a share</b> of the meat, <b>but when</b> other priests <b>invite him</b> to join in their portions, <b>he may partake</b> of them in the evening.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 91b): <b>An acute mourner immerses and partakes of his Paschal offering in the evening, but</b> he may <b>not</b> partake <b>of</b> other <b>sacrificial</b> meat.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Yirmeya of Difti said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the ruling of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to</b> the first night of <b>Passover,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> in tractate <i>Pesaḥim</i>, the ruling of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to the rest of the days of the year.</b>

### Part 8
What is the reason for the distinction between the two? <b>On</b> the first night of <b>Passover, since he partakes of</b> the <b>Paschal offering, he may also partake of</b> other <b>sacrificial</b> meat. But <b>on the rest of the days of the year, when he is unfit</b> to partake of sacrificial meat, <b>he is unfit. And what</b> does the mishna in <i>Pesaḥim</i> mean when it states: <b>But</b> he may <b>not</b> partake <b>of</b> other <b>sacrificial</b> meat? It means: <b>But</b> he may <b>not</b> partake <b>of sacrificial</b> meat <b>of all</b> of the rest of <b>the year,</b> other than the first night of Passover.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Asi said</b> there is a different resolution to the contradiction between the <i>mishnayot</i>: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the ruling of the mishna in tractate <i>Pesaḥim</i>, which prohibits an acute mourner from partaking of sacrificial meat, it is referring to a case <b>where his</b> relative <b>died on the fourteenth</b> day of Nisan, <b>and he buried him on the fourteenth</b> itself, in which case he is still considered an acute mourner by rabbinic law that evening. <b>There,</b> in the ruling of the mishna in this chapter, it is referring to a case <b>where his</b> relative <b>died on the thirteenth</b> of Nisan, <b>and he buried him on the fourteenth</b> of Nisan. The reason the mourner may partake is that since <b>the day of burial</b> is not the day of death, it <b>does not take hold of its</b> following <b>night by rabbinic law.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that <b>acute mourning</b> the following <b>night</b> is <b>by rabbinic law,</b> as opposed to by Torah law? This <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Acute mourning at night is by Torah law;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> His status as <b>an acute mourner</b> at night <b>is not by Torah law, but by rabbinic law. Know</b> that this so, <b>as</b> the Sages <b>said: An acute mourner immerses and partakes of his Paschal offering in the evening, but</b> he may still <b>not</b> partake <b>of</b> other <b>sacrificial</b> meat. If acute mourning at night were by Torah law, he would not be permitted to partake of the Paschal offering.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Shimon hold</b> that <b>acute mourning at night is by rabbinic law</b> and that consequently an acute mourner partakes of his Paschal offering in the evening? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: An acute mourner does not send his offerings</b> to the Temple to be sacrificed? <b>What, is it not</b> referring <b>even to a Paschal offering?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to all offerings <b>other than a Paschal offering.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara counters: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the verse: “And if his offering be a sacrifice of peace offerings [<i>shelamim</i>]” (Leviticus 3:1), <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The offering is called <b><i>shelamim</i></b> to teach that <b>when</b> a person <b>is whole [<i>shalem</i>],</b> i.e., in a state of contentment, <b>he brings</b> his offering, <b>but he does not bring</b> it <b>when he is an acute mourner. From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> that an acute mourner does not bring even <b>a thanks offering? I include the thanks offering because it is consumed in</b> a state of <b>joy, like a peace offering.</b>

### Part 13
<b>From where</b> is it derived that the verse also serves <b>to include a burnt offering? I include the burnt offering because it comes as a vow</b> offering <b>and as a gift</b> offering, <b>like a peace offering. From where</b> is it derived that the verse also serves <b>to include a firstborn</b> offering, <b>and</b> an animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>and a Paschal offering,</b> which are not brought voluntarily? <b>I include a firstborn</b> offering, <b>and</b> an animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>and a Paschal offering, because they</b> too, like a peace offering, <b>do not come</b> to atone <b>for a sin. From where</b> is it derived <b>to include a sin offering and a guilt offering,</b> which atone for sins? <b>The verse states:</b> “And if his offering be <b>a sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>]</b> of peace offerings,” which teaches that an acute mourner may not sacrifice any slaughtered offering [<i>zevaḥ</i>].

### Part 14
<b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> even <b>the bird offerings, and the meal offerings, and the wine, and the wood, and the frankincense</b> brought for the Temple service? <b>The verse states:</b> “And if <b>his offering</b> be a sacrifice of <b>peace offerings [<i>shelamim korbano</i>],”</b> teaching that for <b>all offerings [<i>korbanot</i>] that</b> a person <b>brings, he brings</b> them <b>when he is whole [<i>shalem</i>], but he does not bring</b> them <b>when he is an acute mourner.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara explains: <b>In any event,</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>teaches</b> that it is prohibited for an acute mourner to bring <b>a Paschal offering,</b> even though he will cease to be an acute mourner that night; this contradicts the first <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The latter <i>baraita</i> mentions <b>a Paschal offering for no purpose.</b> In other words, the <i>halakha</i> that an acute mourner does not bring an offering does not actually apply to a Paschal offering, and the <i>baraita</i> mentions it only out of habit, since a firstborn-animal offering, the animal tithe offering, and a Paschal offering are frequently mentioned together.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Sheshet said: What</b> is meant in this <i>baraita</i> by the term: <b>Paschal offering?</b> It is referring to <b>the peace offerings of Passover,</b> i.e., the peace offering that is sacrificed along with the Paschal offering. The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> that <b>is</b> the same as <b>a peace offering,</b> which Rabbi Shimon already mentioned. The Gemara answers: He <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>peace offerings that come on account of</b> the <b>Paschal offering, and</b> he <b>taught</b> separately the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>peace offerings that come on their own account.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara explains: Rabbi Shimon needed to teach both cases explicitly, <b>because if he did not teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>peace offerings that come on account of</b> the <b>Paschal offering,</b> it would <b>enter your mind to say: Since they come on account of</b> the <b>Paschal offering, they are considered like</b> the <b>Paschal offering itself,</b> and the acute mourner offers them as well. Therefore, Rabbi Shimon <b>teaches us</b> that these peace offerings are also forbidden to an acute mourner.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Mari said</b> a different resolution to the contradiction between the statements of Rabbi Shimon:
