### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him:</b> This inference is not valid, as <b>we find</b> that <b>a leftover sin offering,</b> e.g., one bought with money left over from funds dedicated to the acquisition of a sin offering, <b>is brought</b> as <b>a burnt offering,</b> whereas <b>a leftover burnt offering is not brought</b> as <b>a sin offering.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And</b> according to Rabbi Eliezer’s logic, one should derive <i>a fortiori</i>: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a sin offering, whose leftover is brought</b> as <b>a burnt offering,</b> nevertheless, if one <b>slaughtered it for the sake of a burnt offering</b> it is <b>unfit,</b> so too, with regard to <b>a burnt offering, whose leftover is not brought</b> as <b>a sin offering,</b> if one <b>slaughtered it for the sake of a sin offering, isn’t it logical that it should be unfit?</b> Yet, the <i>halakha</i> is that a burnt offering slaughtered for the sake of a sin offering is fit.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: No, if you said</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a sin offering,</b> that another offering sacrificed for its sake is fit, this is only <b>because</b> a sin offering <b>is fit</b> when sacrificed <b>for its sake all year long. Shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a Paschal offering, which is fit</b> when sacrificed <b>for its sake only at its</b> designated <b>time? Since</b> a Paschal offering <b>is unfit</b> when sacrificed <b>for its sake</b> during the rest of the year, <b>it is logical that other</b> offerings <b>should be disqualified</b> when sacrificed <b>for its sake</b> at its designated time.

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Shimon, brother of Azarya, says</b> that this is the distinction: With regard to all offerings, if one slaughtered them for the sake of an offering whose sanctity is greater than theirs, they are fit; if one slaughtered them for the sake of an offering whose sanctity is less than theirs, they are unfit.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Ashi teaches in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan, and Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, teaches</b> the same statement <b>in the name of Rabbi Yannai: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Shimon, brother of Azarya?</b> It is derived from that <b>which the verse states: “And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they will set apart [<i>yarimu</i>] unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 22:15). The verse is interpreted not as a prohibition but as a halakhic axiom, teaching that offerings <b>are not profaned,</b> i.e., disqualified, <b>by</b> sacrifice for the sake of offerings whose sanctity is <b>more elevated [<i>muram</i>] than theirs; they are profaned</b> only <b>by</b> sacrifice for the sake of offerings whose sanctity is <b>less than theirs.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And does that</b> verse <b>come to</b> teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>But isn’t it necessary for Shmuel’s</b> derivation? <b>As Shmuel says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who eats untithed produce is</b> liable <b>to</b> be punished with <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven? <b>As it is stated: “And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they will set apart unto the Lord.”</b> The term: “Will set apart,” indicates that <b>the verse is speaking of</b> holy items <b>that are to be set apart in the future,</b> i.e., untithed produce, which includes the portion designated for the priest [<i>teruma</i>].

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> if <b>the verse</b> taught only one <i>halakha</i>, the <i>halakha</i> of Shimon, brother of Azarya, it <b>should have written: Which they have set apart. What</b> is the reason the verse states: <b>“Which they will set apart,”</b> in the future tense? <b>Conclude from it</b> that the verse teaches <b>two</b> <i>halakhot</i>: An offering sacrificed for the sake of an offering of greater sanctity is fit, and consumption of untithed produce is punishable by death at the hand of Heaven.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> According to Shimon, brother of Azaria, who says that less sacred offerings sacrificed for the sake of more sacred offerings are fit, perhaps they <b>are fit but do not propitiate</b> God, i.e., they do not fulfill the owner’s obligation, as the Rabbis hold. If so, <b>when</b> Shimon, brother of Azaria, <b>disagrees</b> with the first <i>tanna</i> in the mishna, <b>he disagrees</b> only <b>with regard to one</b> matter, i.e., that more sacred offerings sacrificed for the sake of less sacred ones are disqualified altogether. <b>Alternatively, perhaps</b> Shimon, brother of Azaria, holds that if less sacred offerings are sacrificed for the sake of more sacred offerings they are both <b>fit and propitiate</b> God, <b>and they disagree</b> with the Rabbis <b>about two</b> matters.

### Part 9
<b>Abaye, and some say Rabbi Zerika, said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof that they do not satisfy the owners’ obligation: Shimon, brother of Azarya, elaborated on his opinion in the mishna: <b>A firstborn</b> animal <b>and the</b> animal <b>tithe that one slaughtered for the sake of peace offerings are fit,</b> as the sanctity of peace offerings is greater. <b>Peace offerings that one slaughtered for the sake of a firstborn</b> animal <b>or for the sake of</b> the animal <b>tithe are unfit.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> that offerings sacrificed for the sake of offerings of greater sanctity are both <b>fit and propitiate</b> God, <b>is a firstborn</b> an offering that <b>propitiates?</b> Sacrificing a firstborn does not serve to propitiate God; <b>rather,</b> conclude that such offerings <b>are fit but do not propitiate. And</b> one can infer that <b>since</b> in <b>the latter clause they are fit but do not propitiate,</b> in <b>the former clause as well,</b> concerning all offerings of lesser sanctity slaughtered for the sake of offerings of the most sacred order, <b>they are fit but do not propitiate.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara responds: <b>Are the cases comparable? This</b> case is <b>as it is, and that</b> case is <b>as it is.</b> Perhaps Shimon, brother of Azarya, holds that offerings of lesser sanctity slaughtered for the sake of offerings of the most sacred order propitiate God, but a firstborn animal and animal tithe slaughtered for the sake of peace offerings do not propitiate God.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what is</b> the latter clause concerning a firstborn and animal tithe <b>teaching us,</b> if not that no offerings of lesser sanctity propitiate God when sacrificed for the sake of offerings of greater sanctity? How is the clause not redundant? <b>Does it teach us</b> an example of offerings of <b>higher</b> sanctity <b>and</b> offerings of <b>lower</b> sanctity? <b>We</b> already <b>learn</b> such an example in the former clause, which teaches: <b>How so? Offerings of the most sacred order that one slaughtered for the sake of offerings of lesser sanctity</b> are unfit; offerings of lesser sanctity slaughtered for the sake of offerings of the most sacred order are fit.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: It is stated <b>lest you say that</b> the <i>halakha</i> of offerings of <b>higher</b> sanctity <b>and</b> offerings of <b>lower</b> sanctity <b>applies only</b> when the difference is between <b>offerings of the most sacred order and offerings of lesser sanctity, but</b> with regard to offerings of <b>lesser</b> sanctity <b>and</b> other offerings of <b>lesser</b> sanctity this <i>halakha</i> does <b>not</b> apply, as they are all considered to possess the same level of sanctity. Therefore the mishna adds the example of a firstborn animal and animal tithe slaughtered for the sake of peace offerings, to clarify that one can distinguish between different offerings of lesser sanctity as well.

### Part 14
The Gemara raises an objection to this answer: <b>We</b> already <b>learn this as well,</b> in another mishna (89a): The <b>peace offering precedes</b> sacrifice of <b>the firstborn because</b> the peace offering <b>requires placement</b> of its blood twice so as to be visible on <b>four</b> sides of the altar, <b>placing hands</b> on the head of the offering, <b>libations, and waving of</b> the <b>breast and thigh</b> by the priest and the owner, none of which is required for the firstborn.

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: The <b>primary</b> mention of the distinction is in <b>this</b> mishna; <b>that</b> mishna <b>cites it incidentally,</b> in discussing the order of precedence of offerings.

### Part 16
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>the Paschal offering that one slaughtered</b> on the <b>morning of</b> the <b>fourteenth</b> of Nisan, the day when the Paschal offering should be slaughtered in the afternoon, if he did so <b>not for its sake, Rabbi Yehoshua deems it fit as though it were slaughtered on the thirteenth</b> of Nisan. An animal consecrated as a Paschal offering that was slaughtered not at its designated time for the sake of a different offering is fit for sacrifice as a peace offering. <b>Ben Beteira deems it unfit as though it were slaughtered</b> in the <b>afternoon</b> of the fourteenth.

### Part 17
<b>Shimon ben Azzai said: I received</b> a tradition <b>from seventy-two elders,</b> as the Sanhedrin deliberated and decided <b>on the day that they installed Rabbi Elazar</b> ben Azarya <b>at</b> the head of <b>the yeshiva</b> and ruled <b>that all the slaughtered offerings that are eaten that were slaughtered not for their sake are fit, but</b> these offerings <b>did not satisfy the obligation of the owner, except for the Paschal offering and the sin offering.</b> Based on that version, <b>ben Azzai added</b> to the <i>halakha</i> cited in the first mishna <b>only the burnt offering,</b> which is not eaten, <b>and the Rabbis</b> disagreed and <b>did not concede to him.</b>

### Part 18
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: With regard to a Paschal offering that one slaughtered</b> on the <b>morning of</b> the <b>fourteenth</b> of Nisan <b>for its sake, ben Beteira would deem</b> it <b>fit, as</b> he held that <b>the entire day,</b> not only the afternoon, <b>is its</b> designated <b>time.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> is the reason the mishna states that according to ben Beteira, a Paschal offering slaughtered on the morning of the fourteenth is considered <b>as though</b> it were slaughtered in the afternoon? This language seems to indicate that it does not have the same status as a Paschal offering actually slaughtered in the afternoon.

### Part 20
The Gemara responds: <b>Since Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> the term: <b>As though</b> it were slaughtered on the thirteenth, ben Beteira <b>also says</b> the term: <b>As though</b> it were slaughtered in the afternoon. But in fact he maintains that there is no difference between a Paschal offering slaughtered on the morning of the fourteenth and one slaughtered in the afternoon.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, rather than disagreeing</b> in the mishna <b>with regard to</b> a Paschal offering that was slaughtered on the morning of the fourteenth <b>not for its sake, let them disagree with regard to</b> one slaughtered <b>for its sake;</b> ben Beteira holds that it is fit, and Rabbi Yehoshua holds that it is unfit.

### Part 22
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the mishna were to write only that <b>they disagree with regard to</b> a Paschal offering slaughtered <b>for its sake, I would say: But in</b> a case where it was slaughtered <b>not for its sake, Rabbi Yehoshua concedes to ben Beteira</b> that it is disqualified, even though it was slaughtered in the morning, <b>since</b> at least <b>part of</b> the day, the afternoon, is <b>fit</b> for its sacrifice as a Paschal offering. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that they disagree with regard to this case as well.

### Part 23
The Gemara asks: How can ben Beteira claim that a Paschal offering may be slaughtered in the morning? <b>But isn’t it written:</b> “And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it <b>in the afternoon [<i>bein ha’arbayim</i>]”</b> (Exodus 12:6)?

### Part 24
<b>Ulla, son of Rav Ilai, says:</b> Ben Beteira interprets the phrase <i>bein ha’arbayim</i> literally: <b>Between two evenings,</b> i.e., between the eve of the fourteenth and the night after the fourteenth. Accordingly, the Paschal offering may be sacrificed all day long.

### Part 25
The Gemara asks: If so, with regard to the <b>daily offering, concerning which it is written:</b> “The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer <b><i>bein ha’arbayim</i>”</b> (Numbers 28:4), is <b>the entire day fit</b> for sacrifice <b>also?</b>

### Part 26
The Gemara answers: <b>There, since it is written: “The one lamb you shall offer in the morning,” by inference,</b> the term <b><i>bein ha’arbayim</i></b> is referring to the <b>actual afternoon.</b>

### Part 27
The Gemara counters: <b>Say</b> that <b>one</b> of the lambs should be sacrificed <b>in the morning,</b> and <b>the other</b> one can be sacrificed <b>all day.</b> Why is it evident from the requirement that one be sacrificed in the morning that the other must sacrificed in the afternoon?

### Part 28
The Gemara answers: The clause <b>“One</b> lamb you shall offer <b>in the morning”</b> indicates that <b>two</b> lambs are <b>not</b> sacrificed <b>in the morning;</b> the other must perforce be sacrificed in the afternoon.

### Part 29
The Gemara asks: With regard to the <b>lamps</b> of the Candelabrum, one should say the same, <b>as it is written:</b> “And when Aaron lights the lamps <b><i>bein ha’arbayim</i>”</b> (Exodus 30:8). Is <b>the entire day fit</b> for lighting <b>also,</b> according to the opinion of ben Beteira?

### Part 30
The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as it is written:</b> “To burn <b>from evening to morning”</b> (Exodus 27:21). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase <b>“from evening to morning”</b> indicates that you must <b>allocate</b> the Candelabrum <b>its measure</b> of oil so <b>that it will burn from evening until morning. Alternatively,</b> the same verse can be interpreted as follows: <b>Only this rite is valid from evening until morning,</b> since all other rites must be performed during the day. Therefore, the Candelabrum is lit only at the end of the day.

### Part 31
The Gemara asks: With regard to the <b>incense,</b> one should say likewise, <b>as it is written with regard to it: “<i>Bein ha’arbayim</i></b> he shall burn it” (Exodus 30:8). Is <b>the entire day also fit</b> for burning the incense according to the opinion of ben Beteira?

### Part 32
The Gemara answers: The <b>incense is different,</b>
