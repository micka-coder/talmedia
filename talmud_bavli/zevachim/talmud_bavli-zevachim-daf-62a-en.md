<b>and</b> one may <b>not</b> build it <b>on top of tunnels.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara relates that after reconsidering the reason for the expansion of the altar, <b>Rav Yosef said: Is this not as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And they set the altar upon its bases”</b> (Ezra 3:3), which teaches <b>that</b> in the Second Temple the size of the altar <b>reached its full measure,</b> i.e., that it was the ideal size, whereas in the First Temple it was not the ideal size? The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to the instructions David gave Solomon about how to build the Temple: <b>“All this in writing, as the Lord has made me wise by His hand upon me,</b> even all the works of this pattern” (I Chronicles 28:19), indicating that the design of the First Temple was dictated by God?

### Part 3
<b>Rather, Rav Yosef said:</b> The size of the altar in the First Temple was ideal, but in the Second Temple era there was a need to expand the altar, and they <b>found a verse and interpreted</b> it as follows. The verse states: <b>“Then David said: This is the House of the Lord God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel”</b> (I Chronicles 22:1). The verse juxtaposes the House, i.e., the Temple, with the altar, which indicates that the altar is <b>like</b> the <b>Temple: Just as</b> the <b>House</b> was <b>sixty cubits</b> (see I Kings 6:2), <b>so too,</b> the <b>altar</b> may be extended up to a length of <b>sixty cubits.</b>

### Part 4
§ The Gemara discusses the construction of the altar in the Second Temple. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to the location of the <b>House, its shape</b> was <b>discernable</b> from the vestiges of its foundations; <b>but how did they know</b> the proper location of the <b>altar?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: They saw</b> a vision of the <b>altar</b> already <b>built and Michael the archangel standing and sacrificing</b> offerings <b>upon it. And Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa says: They saw</b> a vision of <b>the ashes of Isaac</b> that were <b>placed in that location. And Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says: From the entire House they smelled the scent of incense,</b> yet <b>from there,</b> the location of the altar, <b>they smelled a scent of</b> burned animal <b>limbs.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Three prophets ascended with them from the exile: One who testified to them about</b> the size and shape of <b>the altar, and one who testified to them about the</b> proper <b>location of the altar, and one who testified to them that one sacrifices</b> offerings <b>even if there is no Temple,</b> provided that there is a proper altar.

### Part 7
It <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i></b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: Three prophets ascended with</b> the Jewish people <b>from the exile: One who testified to them about</b> the size and shape of <b>the altar and about the</b> proper <b>location of the altar, and one who testified to them that one sacrifices</b> offerings <b>even if there is no Temple, and one who testified to them about the Torah</b> and instructed <b>that it be written</b> in <b>Assyrian script [<i>Ashurit</i>]</b> rather than the ancient Hebrew script used in the times of Moses.

### Part 8
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>corner</b> built at each point where the edges of the altar meet, the <b>ramp</b> upon which the priests ascended the altar, the <b>base</b> of the altar, <b>and</b> the requirement that the altar must be exactly <b>square, are</b> all <b>indispensable</b> in order for the altar to be fit for use. But <b>the measurement of its length, and the measurement of its width, and the measurement of its height are not indispensable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Huna says:</b> In reference to each of these characteristics <b>the verse states</b> the term <b>“the altar,”</b> and there is a principle that <b>wherever</b> the term <b>“the altar” is stated,</b> it serves <b>to</b> indicate that the halakhic detail mentioned is <b>indispensable.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then the <b>engraving [<i>kiyyur</i>]</b> that was on the altar <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>or</b> the <b>surrounding ledge</b> of the altar <b>according to Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> should <b>also be indispensable, as it is written: “And you shall put it under the <i>karkov</i> of the altar beneath”</b> (Exodus 27:5). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> the <b><i>karkov</i>? Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: This is</b> the <b>engraving</b> on the altar. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: This is the surrounding ledge.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> the <i>karkov</i> is also indispensable, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: On <b>that day</b> when <i>etrogim</i> were pelted at a Sadducee priest who poured the water libation of <i>Sukkot</i> on his feet rather than on the altar (see <i>Sukka</i> 48b), <b>the corner of the altar was damaged</b> as a result of the pelting and the ensuing chaos. <b>They brought a fistful of salt and sealed</b> the damaged section. They did this <b>not because</b> it rendered the altar <b>fit for the</b> Temple <b>service, but</b> in deference to the altar, <b>so that the altar would not be seen</b> in its <b>damaged</b> state. The reason the altar is disqualified is <b>because any altar that does not have a corner, a ramp, and a base, and</b> any altar that is not <b>square,</b> is <b>disqualified. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: Even the surrounding ledge</b> is indispensable.

### Part 11
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> the <b><i>karkov</i></b> of the altar? It is the area <b>between</b> one <b>corner and</b> the next <b>corner,</b> which is the <b>cubit-</b>wide <b>place</b> on top of the altar where <b>the priests</b> would <b>walk.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>the priests would walk between</b> one <b>corner and</b> the next <b>corner?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, say:</b> The <i>karkov</i> is the cubit-wide area between one corner and the other, <b>and</b> there was an additional <b>cubit</b> that was <b>the place</b> where <b>the priests</b> would <b>walk.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written:</b> “And he made for the altar a grating of network of brass, <b>under the <i>karkov</i> beneath, reaching halfway up”</b> (Exodus 38:4), which indicates that the <i>karkov</i> was on the side of the altar and not on top of it? The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: There were two</b> entities called <i>karkov</i>. <b>One</b> was a slight protrusion above the midway point of the altar <b>for aesthetic</b> purposes, <b>and one</b> was an indentation on top of the altar <b>for</b> the benefit of <b>the priests,</b> to ensure <b>that they</b> would <b>not slip</b> off the top of the altar.

### Part 13
It was taught in a <i>baraita</i> cited above that <b>the measurement of</b> the altar’s <b>length, and the measurement of its width, and the measurement of its height are not indispensable. Rabbi Mani says:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>provided that one does not decrease its</b> size so that it is smaller <b>than</b> the <b>altar constructed by Moses.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And how</b> large was the altar constructed by Moses? <b>Rav Yosef says:</b> One <b>cubit.</b> Those in the study hall <b>mocked</b> Rav Yosef, as it is written explicitly: <b>“Five cubits long and five cubits wide; the altar shall be square”</b> (Exodus 27:1).

### Part 14
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Perhaps the Master is speaking</b> about <b>the area of the arrangement</b> of wood? Since the corners took up one cubit on each side and there was an additional cubit on each side for the priests to walk, only one cubit was left for the arrangement of wood. Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>The Master,</b> i.e., Abaye, <b>who is a great man, knows what I</b> mean to <b>say.</b> Rav Yosef <b>read,</b> i.e., applied, the following verse <b>to those</b> who mocked him:
