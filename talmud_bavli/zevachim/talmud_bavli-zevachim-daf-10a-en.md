### Part 1
With regard to <b>one who slaughters an animal in order to sprinkle its blood for idol worship, or</b> in order <b>to burn its</b> forbidden <b>fat for idol worship, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Deriving benefit from the animal is <b>prohibited,</b> as it is considered an offering to idol worship, even if ultimately its blood was not sprinkled or its fat burned to that effect. This is because <b>one can have intention from</b> one <b>rite to</b> affect another <b>rite;</b> idolatrous intent while slaughtering the animal renders it forbidden, even if the intention pertains not to the slaughter itself but to the sprinkling of the blood or the burning of the forbidden fat. <b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>piggul</i>, as <b>we derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> of idol worship, which are applicable even <b>outside</b> the Temple, <b>from</b> <i>halakhot</i> concerning intent that apply <b>inside</b> the Temple.

### Part 2
<b>Reish Lakish says:</b> Deriving benefit from the animal is <b>permitted. One cannot have intention from</b> one <b>rite to</b> affect another <b>rite, and we do not derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> applicable <b>outside</b> the Temple <b>from</b> <i>halakhot</i> that apply <b>inside</b> the Temple.

### Part 3
Although both disputes are essentially the same, each is necessary. <b>And if</b> the Sages <b>had taught us</b> the dispute only <b>with regard to that</b> issue, namely, an animal slaughtered with idolatrous intent, one would have reasoned that <b>Reish Lakish says</b> his opinion only <b>with regard to that</b> issue, as he maintains that <i>halakhot</i> applicable outside the Temple are not derived from <i>halakhot</i> applicable only inside the Temple. <b>But</b> with regard to an offering that was slaughtered with the intention of sprinkling its blood not for its sake, one might <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that it is disqualified, as <i>halakhot</i> applicable <b>inside</b> the Temple can be derived <b>from</b> other <i>halakhot</i> applicable <b>inside</b> the Temple.

### Part 4
<b>And if</b> the Sages <b>had taught us</b> the dispute only with regard to <b>this</b> issue, namely, an offering that was slaughtered with the intention of sprinkling its blood not for its sake, one might claim that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> his opinion only <b>with regard to this</b> issue, which concerns <i>halakhot</i> applicable inside the Temple. <b>But with regard to that</b> issue, an animal that was slaughtered with idolatrous intent, one would <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> that <i>halakhot</i> applicable outside the Temple are not derived from <i>halakhot</i> applicable only inside the Temple. Therefore, both statements <b>are necessary.</b>

### Part 5
<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, <b>he said: Rav Yirmeya responds</b> to this dispute by eliciting evidence <b>to support</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan; and Rabbi Ila</b> elicits evidence <b>to support</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish.</b>

### Part 6
Rav Dimi elaborated: <b>Rav Yirmeya</b> elicits evidence <b>to support</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> by an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>Just as in</b> the <b>case</b> of improper intent with regard to the offering’s time, <b>where if</b> the one slaughtering the offering <b>said: I am hereby slaughtering</b> it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> it is <b>fit,</b> and nevertheless, if he <b>slaughtered it in order to sprinkle its blood beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> it is <b>unfit,</b> so too, in the <b>case</b> of deviation from the type of offering, <b>where</b> even <b>if he said: I am hereby slaughtering</b> it <b>not for its sake,</b> it is <b>unfit, isn’t it logical that</b> if <b>he slaughtered it in order to sprinkle its blood not for its sake, it should be unfit?</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rava bar Ahilai objects to this</b> inference: One cannot claim that deviation from the type of offering is a more severe transgression than intent to consume it or sprinkle its blood beyond its designated time, since the latter has its own element of stringency. <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> intent <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> one who eats the meat of such an offering is liable to be punished with <b><i>karet</i>,</b> whereas one who eats the meat of an offering disqualified due to deviation from the type of offering is not.

### Part 8
<b>Rather, Rava bar Ahilai says:</b> Rav Yirmeya was actually referring to improper intent with regard to the offering’s designated area, since consumption of an offering thereby disqualified is not punishable by <i>karet</i>. And <b>this</b> is what <b>he is saying: Just as</b> in the <b>case</b> of improper intent with regard to the offering’s designated area, <b>where if</b> the one slaughtering the offering <b>said: I am hereby slaughtering</b> it <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area, it is fit,</b> and nevertheless, if he <b>slaughtered it in order to sprinkle its blood outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> it is <b>unfit,</b> so too, in the <b>case</b> of deviation from the type of offering, <b>where</b> even <b>if he said: I am hereby slaughtering</b> it <b>not for its sake, it is unfit, isn’t it logical that</b> if <b>he slaughtered it in order to sprinkle its blood not for its sake, it should be unfit?</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Ashi objects to this</b> inference: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> intent to sprinkle the blood <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> the disqualification <b>applies to all slaughtered offerings. Can you say</b> that the same <i>halakhot</i> govern the disqualification of an offering sacrificed <b>not for its sake, which applies only to a Paschal offering and a sin offering?</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi says: This</b> is what Rav Yirmeya <b>is saying: Just as in</b> the <b>case</b> of deviation with regard to the owner, <b>where, if</b> the one slaughtering the offering <b>said: I am hereby slaughtering</b> it <b>for the sake of so-and-so, it is fit,</b> and nevertheless, if he slaughtered it in order <b>to sprinkle its blood for the sake of so-and-so,</b> it is <b>unfit,</b> so too, in the <b>case</b> of deviation from the type of offering, <b>where</b> even <b>if he said: I am hereby slaughtering</b> it <b>not for its sake, it is unfit, isn’t it logical that</b> if <b>he slaughtered it in order to sprinkle its blood not for its sake, it should be unfit?</b> The opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan is supported by this logical line of reasoning.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Ila</b> elicits evidence <b>to support</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish,</b> that performance of one rite with improper intent with regard to another rite is of no consequence: The Torah <b>should not have stated</b> the requirement of sacrificing an offering for its own sake <b>with regard to sprinkling</b> of the blood, <b>and</b> rather <b>should have</b> let one <b>derive</b> it <b>by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <b>common</b> element <b>of</b> two other rites, <b>from slaughter and collection</b> of the blood. If so, <b>for what <i>halakha</i> does the Merciful One write</b> this redundant requirement? It is in order <b>to say that one cannot have intention from</b> one <b>rite to</b> affect another <b>rite.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this</b> derivation: <b>But perhaps</b> the requirement is written to teach the opposite, <b>that one can have intention from</b> one <b>rite to</b> affect another <b>rite.</b> A redundant requirement should expand, not reduce, the scope of actions that can disqualify the offering.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>If that were so, let the verse remain silent with regard to</b> sprinkling the blood for the sake of the offering, <b>and one could derive</b> that one can have intention from one rite to affect another rite <b>from Rav Ashi’s</b> aforementioned <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. The verse must be meant to counteract that inference and teach that one cannot have intention from one rite to affect another rite.

### Part 14
<b>And the other</b> <i>amora</i>, Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>would refute</b> Rabbi Ila’s proof <b>like this:</b> It is necessary for the Torah to state the requirement with regard to sprinkling. It cannot be derived from the cases of slaughter and collection of the blood, since these two share an element of stringency that sprinkling lacks. <b>What</b> is notable <b>about these?</b> They are notable <b>in that</b> in offerings of the most sacred order <b>they must</b> be performed in the <b>north</b> of the Temple courtyard. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>they are</b> performed <b>in the</b> sacrifice of <b>inner sin offerings</b> as well as external sin offerings, unlike the sprinkling of the blood on the external altar.

### Part 15
<b>And the other</b> <i>amora</i>, Reish Lakish, would respond that <b>now, in any event, we stand</b> in a discussion <b>with regard to peace offerings,</b> since the requirement of sacrifice for the offering’s sake is derived from the verses concerning peace offerings. Peace offerings are neither offerings of the most sacred order nor inner sin offerings, and therefore the elements of stringency mentioned above are irrelevant.

### Part 16
A parallel dispute <b>was stated:</b> If one <b>slaughtered</b> a sin offering <b>for its sake</b> but with intent <b>to sprinkle its blood not for its sake, Rav Naḥman says</b> that the offering is <b>unfit,</b> and <b>Rabba says</b> that it is <b>fit. And Rabba retracted his</b> opinion, and conceded <b>to Rav Naḥman, due to Rav Ashi’s <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference.

### Part 17
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The guilt offering, too,</b> is unfit when sacrificed not for its sake. With regard to this <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: A sin offering is brought for</b> committing <b>a transgression and a guilt offering is brought for</b> committing <b>a transgression. Just as a sin offering</b> sacrificed <b>not for its sake</b> is <b>unfit, so too, a guilt offering</b> sacrificed <b>not for its sake</b> is <b>unfit.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him:</b> The inference is <b>not</b> valid. <b>If you say</b> this <b>with regard to a sin offering, whose blood</b> is sprinkled <b>above</b> the red line that encircles the altar, should you necessarily say the same with regard to a guilt offering, whose blood is sprinkled below that line, like most animal offerings?

### Part 19
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: A Paschal offering can prove</b> the point, <b>as its blood is</b> sprinkled <b>below</b> the red line, <b>and</b> nevertheless, if one <b>slaughtered it not for its sake</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>

### Part 20
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him:</b> A Paschal offering cannot serve as the source either, since it possesses a unique element of stringency. <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a Paschal offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that its</b> designated <b>time is fixed.</b> A guilt offering does not have a fixed time.

### Part 21
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: A sin offering can prove</b> the point, as it does not have a fixed time, and nevertheless, it is disqualified if sacrificed not for its sake.

### Part 22
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him:</b>
