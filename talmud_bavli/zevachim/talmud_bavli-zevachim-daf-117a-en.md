### Part 1
it would consequently be <b>found</b> that both <b><i>zavim</i> and</b> those who are <b>ritually impure</b> from impurity imparted by <b>a corpse are sent out of one camp,</b> i.e., the camp of the Divine Presence, and both are permitted in the Israelite camp. <b>But the Torah said</b> with regard to sending the ritually impure out of the camp: “Outside the camp you shall put them; <b>that they will not defile their camps”</b> (Numbers 5:3).

### Part 2
The use of the plural “camps” indicates: <b>Give</b> a specific <b>camp to this</b> group, i.e., those who are ritually impure from impurity imparted by a corpse, who may enter the Levite camp but are forbidden to enter the camp of the Divine Presence, <b>and</b> give a specific <b>camp to this</b> group, i.e., those who are <i>zavim</i>, who may enter the Israelite camp but are forbidden to enter the camp of the Divine presence or the Levite camp. If there were no Levite camp in Shiloh, it would follow that both a <i>zav</i> and one who is ritually impure from the impurity imparted by a corpse are sent out of only one camp, and there is no distinction between them.

### Part 3
<b>Rava said to him: Rather, what</b> would you say instead? Would you say that <b>the Israelite camp was not</b> present in Shiloh? If so, it would be <b>found</b> that <b><i>zavim</i> and lepers are</b> both <b>sent to one place,</b> i.e., outside the Levite camp. <b>But the Torah said</b> with regard to the leper: <b>“He shall dwell alone;</b> outside the camp shall his dwelling be” (Leviticus 13:46). The word “alone” teaches <b>that another ritually impure person should not dwell with him.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>actually, all three</b> camps <b>were</b> present in Shiloh, <b>and what</b> is the meaning of that which was taught with regard to Shiloh: <b>There were only two camps?</b> It is <b>with regard to</b> the fact that the Levite camp did not provide <b>refuge</b> to one who unintentionally killed another. The Gemara asks: <b>By inference,</b> does this mean <b>that in the wilderness the Levite camp did provide refuge</b> to those who unintentionally killed others?

### Part 5
The Gemara replies: <b>Yes, and so it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse concerning the cities of refuge. The verse states: “And one who did not lie in wait…<b>and I will appoint for you a place</b> where he may flee” (Exodus 21:13). The phrase “I will appoint for you” teaches that God said to Moses: There will be a place that provides refuge for unintentional murderers even <b>during your lifetime.</b> The term <b>“a place”</b> means that it will be from <b>your place,</b> meaning the Levite camp served as the place that provided refuge in the wilderness. <b>“Where he may flee” teaches that</b> the Jews <b>would exile</b> unintentional murderers <b>in the wilderness</b> as well, before they entered the land. <b>To where did they exile</b> unintentional murderers when they were in the wilderness? They exiled them <b>to the Levite camp,</b> which provided refuge.

### Part 6
<b>From here</b> the Sages <b>said: A Levite who killed</b> unintentionally <b>is exiled from</b> one Levite <b>city to</b> another Levite <b>city. And if he was exiled to</b> another area within <b>his city, he is admitted to his city,</b> i.e., it provides him with refuge.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the verse</b> from which the principle is derived that one who was already exiled to a city of refuge and who then killed another person is exiled to another area in that same city? <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, says</b> that the verse: <b>“For in his city of refuge he shall dwell”</b> (Numbers 35:28), indicates that he can be exiled to <b>a city in which he was already admitted,</b> as the verse is referring to it as his city, and he shall continue to reside there.

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches that when the Jewish people <b>arrived at Gilgal</b> private altars were permitted. The Gemara elaborates: <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Any</b> offering that was brought due to <b>a vow, or contributed</b> voluntarily, <b>was sacrificed on</b> a private <b>altar;</b> and <b>any</b> offering <b>that is neither</b> brought due to <b>a vow nor contributed</b> voluntarily, but rather is compulsory, was <b>not sacrificed on</b> a private <b>altar.</b> Therefore, <b>a meal offering,</b> which is generally brought voluntarily, <b>and</b> offerings of <b>a nazirite,</b> which have the status of vow offerings as no one is compelled to become a nazirite, were <b>sacrificed upon</b> a private <b>altar.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: Only burnt offerings and peace offerings were sacrificed</b> upon <b>a private</b> altar, not meal offerings or offerings of a nazirite.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Any</b> offering <b>that the public or an individual</b> could <b>sacrifice in the Tent of Meeting in the wilderness</b> could also be <b>sacrificed in the Tent of Meeting in Gilgal. What,</b> then, is the difference <b>between the Tent of Meeting in the wilderness and the Tent of Meeting in Gilgal?</b> During the period of <b>the Tent of Meeting in the wilderness</b> private <b>altars were not permitted</b> and offerings could be sacrificed only in the Tabernacle, while during the period of <b>the Tent of Meeting in Gilgal</b> private <b>altars were permitted. But</b> even if one desired to sacrifice an offering upon <b>his</b> private <b>altar on his roof,</b> he could still <b>sacrifice upon it only burnt offerings and peace offerings.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And the Rabbis say: Any</b> offering <b>that the public</b> could <b>sacrifice in the Tent of Meeting in the wilderness</b> could also be <b>sacrificed in the Tent of Meeting in Gilgal, and here,</b> in the Tabernacle in Gilgal, <b>and there,</b> upon private altars, <b>only burnt offerings and peace offerings were sacrificed</b> for <b>an individual. Rabbi Shimon says: Even</b> the <b>public</b> did not sacrifice every type of offering in the Tent of Meeting in Gilgal; they <b>sacrificed only Paschal offerings</b>
