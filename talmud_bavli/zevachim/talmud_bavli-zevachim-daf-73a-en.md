### Part 1
<b>Any item that is counted, even</b> if it is prohibited <b>by rabbinic law,</b> e.g., <i>teruma</i> of fruit, <b>cannot be nullified, and all the more so</b> items prohibited <b>by Torah law,</b> such as animals that are disqualified for the altar, as in the mishna.

### Part 2
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 5:11): The <i>baraita</i> discusses three cases, all of which relate to the tithing of figs, which is an obligation by rabbinic law. The first is the case of <b>a <i>litra</i> of</b> untithed <b>dried figs</b> that were pressed in different vessels and shaped into circles, <b>that</b> one placed into a barrel containing tithed figs, and during the process of producing a circle he <b>pressed</b> the figs <b>onto the opening of</b> one of the <b>circular</b> vessels in which the circles are formed, <b>and he does not know into which circular</b> vessel <b>he pressed it.</b> The second is the case in which he recalls that he pressed it <b>on the opening of a barrel</b> containing tithed figs, <b>but he does not know into which barrel he pressed it.</b> The third case is that he recalls that he pressed it <b>on the opening of</b> a straw <b>receptacle</b> containing tithed figs, <b>but he does not know into which receptacle he pressed it.</b> In all of these cases, there is a dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda as to the details of a dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One views the upper</b> layers of possibly untithed dried figs <b>as though they are separate</b> pieces, rather than one unit. <b>And the lower</b> ones, which were there beforehand and have certainly been tithed, <b>nullify the upper</b> ones, as there are enough circles of figs to nullify the upper layer. One does not need to tithe the figs at the top of any of the containers.

### Part 4
Rabbi Meir continues: By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: If there are one hundred openings</b> of containers present there, the untithed <i>litra</i> of figs on the opening of one of the containers <b>is nullified</b> in a ratio of one part of untithed figs to one hundred parts of similar, tithed figs. <b>But if not,</b> all of <b>the</b> layers of figs at the <b>openings</b> of the containers <b>are prohibited,</b> i.e., viewed as untithed, as one of them certainly contains an untithed <i>litra</i> that has not been nullified. <b>And the</b> figs on the <b>insides</b> of the vessels <b>are permitted,</b> as the untithed figs certainly did not reach there. This is Rabbi Meir’s version of the dispute.

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If there are one hundred openings</b> of containers with tithed figs present <b>there,</b> in addition to the untithed figs, <b>it is nullified</b> in the one hundred. <b>But if not,</b> all of <b>the</b> layers of figs at the <b>openings</b> of the containers <b>are prohibited,</b> i.e., viewed as untithed, as one of them certainly contains an untithed <i>litra</i> that has not been nullified. And the figs on the insides of the vessels are permitted, as the untithed figs certainly did not reach there.

### Part 6
Rabbi Yehuda continues his statement: By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: Even</b> if <b>there are three hundred openings</b> present <b>there,</b> the layer at the top of the container is <b>not nullified.</b> This <i>litra</i> cannot be nullified in any manner, as Rabbi Yehoshua maintains that even an item occasionally sold by unit, such as a circle of dried figs, can never be nullified.

### Part 7
Rabbi Yehuda continues: But if one <b>pressed</b> the <i>litra</i> of dried figs <b>into a circular</b> vessel along with other dried figs, <b>but does not know onto which place,</b> i.e., which side, <b>of the circular</b> vessel <b>he pressed it, whether,</b> e.g., <b>to its northern</b> side <b>or to its southern</b> side, in this case, as the prohibited <i>litra</i> is not located in a defined place and it cannot be distinguished from the others, it is not considered an item of significance, and <b>everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>nullified.</b> Accordingly, the ruling of the mishna that animals that are disqualified from being sacrificed are not nullified is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua as stated by Rabbi Eliezer, that an item occasionally sold by unit is not nullified. Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, that only an item whose manner is exclusively to be counted is significant and cannot be nullified, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Ashi says: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> i.e., Rabbi Meir, who maintains that an item that is not always counted is nullified in a majority. The reason is that <b>living creatures are significant, and</b> therefore <b>they are not nullified.</b>

### Part 9
§ The Gemara raises a difficulty with the ruling of the mishna that all of the animals are prohibited. <b>And let us draw out and sacrifice one</b> animal <b>from</b> the mixture, <b>and say,</b> i.e., apply the principle: <b>Any</b> item <b>that separates</b> from a group is assumed to have <b>separated from the majority.</b> Accordingly, the animal that was sacrificed is presumed to be fit. One can continue in this manner until only two animals from the mixture remain. The Gemara questions this suggestion: Should <b>we draw out</b> an animal from the mixture? But this <b>is</b> the removal of an item from its <b>fixed</b> place,
