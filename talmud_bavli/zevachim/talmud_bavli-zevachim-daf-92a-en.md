### Part 1
<b>but</b> one may <b>not</b> extinguish <b>a wood coal,</b> because extinguishing it is prohibited by Torah law? <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that Shmuel <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> it should be permitted to extinguish <b>even a wood coal.</b> Rabbi Shimon maintains that extinguishing a coal is prohibited by Torah law only when one intends to use the extinguished coal. Otherwise, this constitutes a labor performed on Shabbat which is not necessary for its own sake, which is not prohibited by Torah law.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: Shmuel’s statements are not contradictory, as <b>with regard to an unintentional act,</b> he <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> But <b>with regard to labor not necessary for its own sake, he holds</b> that it is prohibited by Torah law, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 3
§ <b>Rav Huna says:</b> With regard to wine <b>libations that became ritually impure, one prepares for them an arrangement</b> of wood <b>by themselves and burns them</b> there, without removing them from the Temple courtyard. This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated</b> with regard to a disqualified sin offering: <b>“In the sacred place…it shall be burned with fire”</b> (Leviticus 6:23). This requirement of burning in the sacred place applies to all offerings that are meant to be sacrificed on an altar and became disqualified. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the blood, the oil, the meal offerings, and the libations that became ritually impure, one prepares for them an arrangement</b> of wood <b>by themselves and burns them</b> there.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates: <b>Shmuel said to Rav Ḥana of Baghdad: Bring me an assembly of ten</b> men <b>and I will tell you in their presence</b> this <i>halakha</i> that I wish to disseminate: With regard to <b>libations that became ritually impure, one prepares for them an arrangement</b> of wood <b>by themselves and burns them</b> there.
