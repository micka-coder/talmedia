### Part 1
The Gemara responds: Rabba <b>holds</b> that <b>a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>] who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering is still <b>considered</b> to have the impure status of <b>a <i>zav</i>.</b> The impurity of one who has immersed but has not yet brought an atonement offering is therefore considered stronger than that of one who immersed that day but requires no atonement.

### Part 2
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> the matter of whether <b>a <i>zav</i> who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering is still <b>considered a <i>zav</i> is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>an acute mourner or one who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering <b>burned</b> the red heifer, it is <b>fit. Yosef the Babylonian says:</b> If <b>an acute mourner</b> burned it, it is <b>fit,</b> but if <b>one who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering burned it, it is <b>disqualified. What, is it not that they disagree with regard to this:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Yosef the Babylonian, <b>holds</b> that <b>a <i>zav</i> who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering <b>is considered</b> a full-fledged <b><i>zav</i></b> and therefore disqualifies the red heifer, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that a <i>zav</i> who has not yet brought an atonement offering <b>is not considered a <i>zav</i>,</b> but is instead considered like one who immersed that day, who is fit to burn the red heifer?

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: <b>No, everyone</b> agrees that he <b>is considered a <i>zav</i>, and here</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to this</b> matter, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the rite of the red heifer: <b>“And the pure person shall sprinkle”</b> the water of purification (Numbers 19:19). The preceding verse already states that the one performing the service must be ritually pure. Therefore, by stating “pure” this verse emphasizes that he needs be pure enough only to perform the rite of the red heifer specifically. <b>By inference,</b> one derives <b>that he</b> may <b>be impure</b> in some way that disqualifies him for other rites. This <b>teaches that one who immersed that day is fit</b> to participate <b>in</b> the rite of the red <b>heifer.</b>

### Part 4
The <i>tanna’im</i> disagree as to the extent of this <i>halakha</i>: One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that it is referring to any state of <b>impurity</b> mentioned <b>in the entire Torah,</b> i.e., anyone who immersed that day due to any impurity may participate in the rite of the red heifer. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Yosef the Babylonian, <b>holds</b> that it is referring specifically to one who was in the state of <b>impurity</b> mentioned <b>in this passage,</b> i.e., impurity contracted from a corpse, which the red heifer purifies.

### Part 5
<b>Therefore,</b> according to Yosef the Babylonian, with regard to <b>an acute mourner and one who immersed that day</b> after becoming <b>impure</b> due to contact with the carcass of <b>a creeping animal, since</b> they <b>are</b> treated more <b>leniently, they are derived <i>a fortiori</i> from</b> the case of <b>one who immersed that day</b> to remove impurity contracted from <b>a corpse,</b> and they are fit to participate in the rite of the red heifer. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a <i>zav</i> who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering, <b>who</b> is treated more <b>stringently, since</b> his <b>impurity emerges onto him from his body</b> rather than being imparted from without, one does <b>not</b> derive that he is fit to participate in the rite of the red heifer.

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches that a priest <b>lacking</b> the requisite priestly <b>vestments</b> disqualifies the rites he performs. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rabbi Avuh says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and</b> some <b>determined it</b> to be stated <b>in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: As the verse states: “And you shall gird them with belts, Aaron and his sons, and bind mitres on them; and they shall have the priesthood by a perpetual statute”</b> (Exodus 29:9). The verse indicates that <b>when their vestments are on them, their priesthood is upon them,</b> but if <b>their vestments are not on them, their priesthood is not upon them</b> and their rites are disqualified.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is this <i>halakha</i> <b>derived from here? It is derived from there, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if those who drank wine performed</b> sacrificial <b>rites they have desecrated</b> the service? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the priests: <b>“Drink no wine or strong drink,</b> you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the Tent of Meeting, so that you not die; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations. <b>That you may put difference between the holy and the common”</b> (Leviticus 10:9–10). The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>one lacking</b> the requisite <b>vestments and one whose hands and feet are not washed, from where</b> is it derived that their rites are disqualified as well?
