### Part 1
<b>and</b> there is a principle that <b>anything fixed is considered as</b> though it was <b>half and half,</b> i.e., equally balanced, and it remains a case of uncertainty. The Gemara clarifies its suggestion: <b>Rather, let us push</b> the intermingled animals so <b>that they</b> all <b>move</b> from their places, which negates the fixed status of the prohibited item. <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>let us say</b> with regard to each animal: <b>Any</b> item <b>that separates</b> from a group is assumed to have <b>separated from the majority.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rava says: Now that the Sages have said</b> that <b>we do not sacrifice</b> any of them, this is evidently a rabbinic <b>decree, lest ten priests come simultaneously and sacrifice</b> all the animals in the mixture together, not one at a time. Therefore, the fact that there could be a method to permit the animals is immaterial.

### Part 3
<b>One of the Sages said to Rava: If that is so,</b> do you hold that <b>the large basin [<i>megisa</i>]</b> on which the sacrificial portions of the animal are placed is <b>prohibited?</b> In other words, is it possible that these animals, which were slaughtered when they were initially declared permitted after being separated from their places, could later become prohibited again when their sacrificial portions are ready to be burned on the altar?

### Part 4
Rava responded that he did not mean there is a concern that ten priests would sacrifice their sacrificial portions simultaneously. Rather, the decree is <b>due to</b> the concern <b>lest</b> when the animals move, <b>ten priests will come simultaneously and take</b> them from the mixture. As all or most of the animals were separated simultaneously in this case, it is assumed that the prohibited animal is among those that were separated. The Gemara asks: <b>Is it possible</b> for <b>ten priests</b> to take these scattered animals <b>simultaneously? Rather, Rava says</b> that one may not allow the animals to be sacrificed by moving them <b>due to</b> a decree that if this is allowed, one may, in another circumstance, allow them to be sacrificed even when they are taken from <b>a fixed</b> location.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rava said: Now that the Sages say</b> in the mishna that <b>we do not sacrifice</b> any of the animals, <b>if we did sacrifice</b> one of them, the offering <b>does not effect acceptance</b> for the owner. <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda raised an objection to Rava</b> from a mishna (<i>Kinnim</i> 22b): With regard to a bird <b>sin offering that was intermingled with</b> a bird <b>burnt offering, or</b> a bird <b>burnt offering that was intermingled with</b> a bird <b>sin offering, even</b> if the ratio is <b>one in ten thousand, they all must die,</b> as there is no remedy for these birds. It is not known which is which, and their sacrificial rites are performed differently.

### Part 6
The mishna continues: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? In</b> the case of <b>a priest</b> who <b>consulted</b> the court to ask how he should proceed. <b>But in</b> the case of <b>a priest who did not consult</b> the court, but sacrificed them of his own accord, if there was an equal number of bird sin offerings and burnt offerings, and <b>he performed</b> all their sacrificial rites <b>above</b> the red line that circumscribes the altar at its midpoint, as required for a burnt offering, <b>half</b> of the birds are <b>fit,</b> as in any event the burnt offerings were sacrificed properly, <b>and half</b> are <b>unfit.</b>

### Part 7
Likewise, if he performed all of their sacrificial rites <b>below</b> the red line, <b>half</b> are <b>fit,</b> as in any event the sin offerings were sacrificed properly, <b>and half</b> are <b>unfit.</b> If he performed the sacrificial rites of <b>one</b> of the birds <b>below</b> the red line and <b>one</b> of the birds <b>above</b> the red line, <b>they are both unfit, as I say</b> that the <b>sin offering</b> was <b>sacrificed above</b> the red line <b>and</b> the <b>burnt offering</b> was <b>sacrificed below.</b> This mishna proves that an offering that is prohibited to be sacrificed as part of a mixture is fit after the fact, which contradicts the statement of Rava.

### Part 8
<b>Rather,</b> Rava would claim that this matter depends on a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>. <b>This</b> statement of Rava is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that <b>living creatures</b> that become disqualified <b>are</b> permanently <b>rejected</b> from being sacrificed on the altar, and this animal was rejected when it was part of the mixture. <b>That</b> ruling of the mishna in <i>Kinnim</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that <b>living creatures are not</b> permanently <b>rejected</b> from the altar. Therefore, if the animal was sacrificed it is fit.

### Part 9
The Gemara raises a difficulty: But <b>there is</b> the case of <b>slaughtered</b> offerings that are rejected from the altar, concerning <b>which everyone agrees</b> that these <b>are rejected.</b> Even those who say that living creatures generally are not rejected agree that, in this case, they should be rejected.
