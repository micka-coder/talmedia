### Part 1
<b>“And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:25), teaching <b>that</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood <b>must be</b> performed <b>for the sake of a sin offering.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And we found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>slaughter and collection</b> must be performed for the sake of a sin offering. <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood? The Gemara answers: It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “And the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin”</b> (Leviticus 4:26), teaching <b>that</b> the <b>atonement must be</b> effected <b>for the sake of a sin offering,</b> as atonement is effected by the sprinkling of the blood.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the prohibition against <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering. From where do we</b> derive the prohibition against <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner?</b> The Gemara answers: The aforementioned <b>verse states:</b> “And the priest shall make atonement <b>for him,”</b> indicating that the intent must be <b>for him, and not for another.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source <b>for</b> the <b>mitzva</b> to sprinkle the blood for the sake of the owner <i>ab initio</i>. <b>From where do we</b> derive that this is <b>indispensable</b> and disqualifies the offering if not fulfilled? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says</b> with regard to the sin offering of a nazirite: Since the verse could have simply stated: <b>Sin offering,</b> but instead stated: <b>“His sin offering”</b> (Numbers 6:16), it is inferred that the offering must be sacrificed for his, the owner’s, sake. <b>Here too,</b> since the verse could have simply stated <b>“sin,”</b> but states <b>“his sin,”</b> one infers that if the blood of the sin offering is not sprinkled for the sake of its owner, it is disqualified.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the <b>mitzva of</b> sacrificing a sin offering without <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering</b> <i>ab initio</i>, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>sprinkling</b> its blood without <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner</b> concerning <b>both</b> its <b>mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i> <b>and</b> its <b>indispensability. From where do we</b> derive that performing <b>all</b> sacrificial <b>rites</b> without <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering is an indispensable</b> requirement, <b>and</b> that performing <b>all other rites,</b> besides sprinkling the blood, without <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner is both a mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i> <b>and indispensable?</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yona says: It is derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>the sin offering of a nazirite; as it is written</b> concerning a nazirite: <b>“And the priest shall bring them before the Lord, and shall offer [<i>ve’asa</i>] his sin offering, and his burnt offering”</b> (Numbers 6:16). The verse teaches <b>that all of its</b> sacrificial <b>actions [<i>asiyyotav</i>] must be</b> performed <b>for the sake of a sin offering.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that a sin offering must be sacrificed without <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering,</b> and that this requirement is indispensable. <b>From where do we</b> derive that sacrificing it without <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner</b> is also indispensable, even in rites other than the sprinkling of the blood?

### Part 8
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says:</b> Since the verse concerning a nazirite could have simply stated: <b>Sin offering,</b> but instead states: <b>“His sin offering,”</b> one infers that the offering must be sacrificed for the owner’s sake.

### Part 9
<b>Ravina objects to this: If that is so, what do you interpret</b> from the fact that the same verse could have stated: <b>Burnt offering,</b> but instead states: <b>“His burnt offering”?</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Ravina, what do you interpret</b> from the subsequent verse: “The priest shall offer also his meal offering and his libation” (Numbers 6:17)? Why does Ravina not mention that this verse could have stated: <b>Meal offering,</b> but instead states: <b>“His meal offering,”</b> and that it could have stated: <b>Libation,</b> but instead states: <b>“His libation”?</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> language <b>is necessary;</b> it is just like the phrase: <b>“Their meal offering and their libations,”</b> which is mentioned many times in the portion of the Festival offerings (e.g., Numbers 29:37). It teaches that the meal offerings and libations that are brought with the additional animal offerings of the Festivals can be sacrificed even <b>at night</b> after the offering is brought. The phrase: <b>“Their meal offering and their libations,”</b> also teaches that they may be brought <b>even on the following day.</b> Likewise here, when stated with regard to a nazirite, the phrase teaches that they may be brought at night or the day after the offering is sacrificed. <b>But</b> there remains a difficulty: <b>What do you interpret</b> from the fact that the verse could have stated: <b>Burnt offering,</b> but instead states: <b>“His burnt offering”?</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara raises an additional objection to the derivation from a nazirite’s sin offering: <b>And furthermore, can</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a standard sin offering and of a nazirite’s sin offering <b>be derived from one another?</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a sin offering</b> brought for a transgression, e.g., eating forbidden <b>fat, cannot be derived from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a nazirite’s sin offering,</b> due to the unique element of stringency of the latter, <b>since there is other blood,</b> i.e., other offerings are brought, <b>with it.</b> Likewise, the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a nazirite’s sin offering cannot be derived from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a sin offer-ing</b> brought for eating forbidden <b>fat,</b> due to the unique element of stringency of the latter, <b>since</b> it atones for a transgression punishable by <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>].</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rather, Rava says:</b> These <i>halakhot</i> are <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the sin offering of a leper; as it is written: “And the priest shall offer [<i>ve’asa</i>] the sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:19), teaching <b>that all</b> sacrificial <b>actions of [<i>asiyyotav</i>]</b> a sin offering <b>must be</b> performed <b>for the sake of a sin offering.</b>

### Part 14
<b>And we found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that a sin offering must be sacrificed without <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering,</b> and that this is indispensable. <b>From where do we</b> derive that sacrificing a sin offering without <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner</b> is also indispensable? <b>The verse states: “And make atonement for the one that is to be purified</b> of his impurity” (Leviticus 14:19), indicating that the sin offering must be sacrificed <b>for</b> the sake of <b>this</b> person <b>who is being purified, and not for another</b> person <b>who is to be purified.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>But still, can</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a standard sin offering and a leper’s sin offering <b>be derived from one another?</b> This comparison is also problematic. The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a sin offering</b> brought for eating forbidden <b>fat cannot be derived from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a leper’s sin offering, since there is other blood</b> that is brought <b>with</b> the latter, i.e., a burnt offering and a guilt offering; and the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a leper’s sin offering cannot be derived from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a sin offering</b> brought for eating forbidden <b>fat, since</b> the latter atones for a transgression punishable by <b><i>karet</i>.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: Indeed, the <i>halakhot</i> of a sin offering <b>cannot be derived from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>one</b> other type of sin offering alone. But one can <b>derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>one</b> type of sin offering <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the other <b>two.</b> The verses concerning a standard sin offering, that of a leper, and that of a nazirite all contain elements that indicate that the offering must be sacrificed for its own sake. Two of them together are sufficient to teach that this <i>halakha</i> applies to the third case. The third case is therefore apparently extraneous, and it is understood to teach that proper intent in this regard is indispensable for all the offering’s rites.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to which</b> type of sin offering <b>should</b> the Torah <b>not have written</b> this <i>halakha</i>, i.e., which of the three cases should be regarded as the extraneous case? If you say: <b>Let the Merciful One not write</b> it <b>with regard to a sin offering</b> brought for eating forbidden <b>fat, and</b> one can <b>derive</b> it <b>from these</b> other sin offerings, i.e., those of a nazirite and a leper, this can be refuted: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about these</b> other sin offerings? They are notable <b>in that there is other blood</b> brought <b>with them.</b> Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> should apply only to similar sin offerings.

### Part 18
If you say: <b>Let the Merciful One not write</b> it <b>with regard to a nazirite’s sin offering, and</b> one can <b>derive</b> it <b>from these</b> other sin offerings, those of a leper and a sinner, this can also be refuted: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about these</b> other sin offerings? They are notable <b>in that</b> one <b>does not have</b> the option of obtaining an exemption through <b>a request</b> to a halakhic authority. A nazirite, by contrast, can request of a halakhic authority to dissolve his vow of naziriteship, thereby nullifying his obligation.

### Part 19
If you say: <b>Let the Merciful One not write</b> it <b>with regard to a leper’s sin offering, and</b> one can <b>derive</b> it <b>from these</b> other sin offerings, those of a nazirite and a sinner, this can also be refuted: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about these</b> other sin offerings? They are notable <b>in that they cannot be brought</b> from doves instead of sheep if the owner is <b>poor,</b> unlike a leper’s sin offering (see Leviticus 14:21). Therefore, the <i>halakhot</i> of these different sin offerings cannot be derived from one another.

### Part 20
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is derived from that which <b>the verse states: “This is the law of the burnt offering, and of the meal offering,</b> and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the consecration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:37). <b>The verse juxtaposes</b> a sin offering <b>with a peace offering,</b> indicating that <b>just as</b> for <b>a peace offering we require</b> intent <b>for its sake, as a mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i>, <b>both</b> concerning the <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering and</b> concerning <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner, so too,</b> for <b>a sin offering we require</b> intent <b>for its sake as a mitzva, both</b> concerning <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering and</b> concerning <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner.</b>

### Part 21
<b>Therefore,</b> the <b>mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i> is derived <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a peace offering; and those verses</b> mentioned earlier, from which this requirement is derived with regard to each type of sin offering separately, repeat the <i>halakha</i> <b>to</b> teach that it is <b>indispensable.</b>

### Part 22
The Gemara asks: <b>And we found</b> a source for these <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <b>a sin offering</b> brought for eating forbidden <b>fat, as it is written with regard to it:</b> “And slaughter it <b>for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:33), indicating that it must be slaughtered for the sake of a sin offering. Likewise, sources for this <i>halakha</i> with regard to the sin offerings of a nazirite and a leper have also been cited.
