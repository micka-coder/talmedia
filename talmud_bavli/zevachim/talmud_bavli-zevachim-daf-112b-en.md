### Part 1
<b>temporarily blemished, which one sacrificed outside</b> the Temple courtyard, one is <b>exempt. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> For <b>permanently blemished</b> animals one is <b>exempt;</b> for <b>temporarily blemished</b> animals one is <b>liable for</b> violation of <b>a prohibition,</b> but it is not the type of prohibition for which he will receive <i>karet</i>, because ultimately the animal will be fit for sacrifice.

### Part 2
With regard to <b>doves whose time</b> of fitness for sacrifice <b>has not arrived,</b> as they are fit for sacrifice only when they are older, after their wings assume a golden hue; <b>and pigeons whose time</b> of fitness <b>has passed,</b> as they are fit only when they are young and their wings did not yet assume a yellowish tint, <b>that one sacrificed outside</b> the Temple courtyard, he is <b>exempt. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> For <b>pigeons whose time</b> of fitness <b>has passed</b> one is <b>exempt, and</b> for <b>doves whose time</b> of fitness <b>has not</b> yet <b>arrived</b> he is <b>in</b> violation of <b>a prohibition.</b>

### Part 3
With regard to an animal <b>itself and its offspring</b> that were slaughtered on the same day, where one violates a prohibition for slaughtering the second, <b>and</b> an animal <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, if one sacrificed it outside the Temple courtyard he is <b>exempt. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> For an animal whose time has not yet arrived, <b>that</b> person is <b>in</b> violation of a mere <b>prohibition, as Rabbi Shimon says:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> sacrificial animal <b>that is fit to come</b> and be sacrificed <b>after</b> the passage of <b>time,</b> if one sacrificed it outside the courtyard, <b>that</b> person is <b>in</b> violation of <b>a prohibition but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i>. And the Rabbis say: In any</b> case <b>in which there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i> there is no</b> violation of <b>a prohibition.</b>

### Part 4
The mishna adds: An animal is defined as one <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, <b>whether</b> it is <b>intrinsically</b> premature, e.g., doves whose wings have not yet assumed a golden hue or an animal less than seven days old (see Leviticus 22:27), or <b>whether</b> it is premature <b>for its owner.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Which is</b> the animal <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived because it is premature <b>for its owner?</b> It is the animal of <b>a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>], and a woman who experiences a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period [<i>zava</i>], and a woman after childbirth, and a leper</b> whose period of impurity is not yet complete, <b>where</b> these owners, who are ritually impure, <b>sacrificed their sin offerings or guilt offerings outside</b> the Temple courtyard. In this case <b>they are exempt,</b> as they are neither obligated nor permitted to bring those offerings. But if they sacrificed <b>their burnt offerings or their peace offerings outside</b> the courtyard <b>they are liable,</b> as those offerings may be brought as gift offerings even if their owner is ritually impure.

### Part 6
<b>One who offers up</b> outside the Temple courtyard a portion <b>of the meat of a sin offering</b> that is eaten; <b>of the meat of a guilt offering; of the meat of</b> other <b>offerings of the most sacred order</b> that are eaten, e.g., the sheep sacrificed on the festival of <i>Shavuot</i>, or <b>of the meat of offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> is exempt, as all these are eaten by the priests and not sacrificed on the altar. <b>And</b> for the same reason, one who sacrificed a portion of <b>the surplus of the <i>omer</i> offering,</b> a measure of barley brought as a communal offering on the sixteenth of the Hebrew month of Nisan, after the handful was removed; <b>or the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering on <i>Shavuot</i> of two loaves from the new wheat; <b>or the shewbread</b> arranged on the Table each Shabbat in the Sanctuary; <b>or the remainder of meal offerings,</b> is also exempt.

### Part 7
<b>And</b> likewise with regard to <b>one who pours</b> oil onto a meal offering; <b>and one who breaks</b> the loaves of a meal offering into pieces; <b>and one who mixes</b> oil into the flour of a meal offering; <b>and one who salts</b> a meal offering or other offerings; <b>and one who waves</b> a meal offering; <b>and one who brings</b> a meal offering to the corner of an altar, if he performs these actions outside the courtyard; <b>and one who arranges</b> shewbread on <b>the table</b> outside the Sanctuary; <b>and one who removes the ashes</b> from <b>the lamps</b> of the Candelabrum; <b>and one who removes a handful</b> from a meal offering; <b>and one who collects</b> the <b>blood</b> of an offering in a vessel, if he did so <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard: In all of these cases he is <b>exempt.</b> This is because one is liable only if he performs an action similar to sacrifice that completes the sacrificial service, while all of these actions are ones that are normally followed by additional sacrificial rites.

### Part 8
<b>And one is</b> likewise <b>not liable for</b> any of these actions, <b>neither due to</b> the prohibition against <b>a non-priest</b> performing the Temple service, <b>nor due to</b> the prohibition against performing the Temple service in a state of <b>ritual impurity, nor due to</b> the prohibition against a priest <b>lacking</b> the requisite priestly <b>vestments</b> while performing the Temple service, <b>nor due to</b> the prohibition against performing the Temple service <b>without washing</b> one’s <b>hands and feet.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Until the Tabernacle was established,</b> private <b>altars were permitted and</b> the sacrificial <b>service</b> was performed <b>by the firstborn. And from</b> the time <b>that the Tabernacle was established,</b> private <b>altars were prohibited and</b> the sacrificial <b>service</b> was performed <b>by the priests. Offerings of the most sacred order were</b> then <b>eaten within the curtains</b> surrounding the courtyard of the Tabernacle in the wilderness <b>and offerings of lesser sanctity</b> were eaten <b>throughout the camp of Israel.</b> When the Jewish people <b>arrived at Gilgal</b> private <b>altars were permitted, offerings of the most sacred order were</b> then <b>eaten within the curtains, and offerings of lesser sanctity</b> were eaten <b>anywhere.</b>

### Part 10
When <b>they arrived at Shiloh,</b> private <b>altars were prohibited. And there was no roof</b> of wood or stone <b>there,</b> i.e., in the Tabernacle in Shiloh; <b>rather</b> there was <b>only a building of stone below and the curtains</b> of the roof of the Tabernacle were spread <b>above it. And</b> the period that the Tabernacle was in Shiloh <b>was</b> characterized in the Torah as <b>“rest”</b> in the verse: “For you have not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the Lord your God has given you” (Deuteronomy 12:9). <b>Offerings of the most sacred order were</b> then <b>eaten within the curtains</b> in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting, <b>and offerings of lesser sanctity and second tithe</b> were eaten <b>in any</b> place <b>that overlooks</b> Shiloh.

### Part 11
When Shiloh was destroyed (see I Samuel 4:18), the Jewish people <b>arrived</b> with the Tabernacle <b>at Nov, and</b> later at <b>Gibeon,</b> and private <b>altars were permitted. Offerings of the most sacred order were</b> then <b>eaten within the curtains</b> in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting, and <b>offerings of lesser sanctity</b> were eaten <b>in all the cities of</b> Eretz <b>Yisrael.</b>

### Part 12
When the Jewish people <b>arrived at Jerusalem</b> and built the Temple during the reign of Solomon, private <b>altars were prohibited, and</b> private altars <b>did not have</b> a subsequent period when they were <b>permitted. And</b> the Temple in Jerusalem <b>was</b> characterized as <b>“inheritance”</b> in the verse: “For you have not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the Lord your God has given you.” <b>Offerings of the most sacred order were</b> then <b>eaten within the curtains,</b> i.e., in the Temple courtyard, and <b>offerings of lesser sanctity and second tithe</b> were eaten <b>within the walls</b> of the city, whose legal status was that of the Israelite camp in the wilderness.

### Part 13
With regard to <b>all offerings that one consecrated during a period of prohibition of</b> private <b>altars and sacrificed during a period of prohibition of</b> private <b>altars,</b> if he sacrificed them <b>outside</b> their designated area, for <b>these</b> animals he is <b>in</b> violation of both the <b>positive mitzva</b> to sacrifice the offering in the place chosen by God <b>and</b> the <b>prohibition</b> against sacrificing them on a private altar, <b>and he is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> doing <b>it.</b>

### Part 14
If <b>one consecrated</b> the animals <b>during a period of permitting of</b> private <b>altars and sacrificed them during a period of prohibition of</b> private <b>altars, outside</b> their designated area, for <b>these</b> animals he is <b>in</b> violation of <b>a positive mitzva and a prohibition, but he is not liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> sacrificing <b>them.</b> If <b>he consecrated</b> the animals <b>during a period of prohibition of</b> private <b>altars and sacrificed them during a period of permitting of</b> private <b>altars,</b> outside their designated area, for <b>these</b> animals he is <b>in</b> violation of <b>a positive mitzva</b> for failure to bring it to the Tabernacle, <b>but these</b> animals <b>are not subject to a prohibition,</b> as it is permitted to sacrifice on a private altar.

### Part 15
<b>And these are</b> the <b>sacrificial</b> items that <b>are sacrificed</b> only <b>in the Tabernacle</b> even when private altars are permitted: <b>Sacrificial</b> animals <b>that were</b> presumed to be <b>consecrated for</b> sacrifice in <b>the Tabernacle.</b> Therefore, <b>communal offerings are sacrificed in the Tabernacle, but offerings of an individual</b> may be sacrificed <b>on</b> a private <b>altar.</b> In addition, with regard to <b>offerings of an individual that were consecrated</b> expressly <b>for</b> sacrifice in <b>the Tabernacle, one must sacrifice</b> them <b>in the Tabernacle. But if he sacrificed them on</b> a private <b>altar,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 16
<b>And what</b> is the difference <b>between the</b> private <b>altar of an individual and the public altar</b> at the site of the Tabernacle when it was located in Gilgal, Nov, and Gibeon? It is that on a private altar there is no <b>placing</b> of <b>hands</b> on the head of an offering, no <b>slaughter in the north,</b>
