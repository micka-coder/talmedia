### Part 1
<b>there is</b> permanent <b>disqualification</b> even <b>in</b> a case where the animal possesses sanctity that inheres in its <b>monetary</b> value, rather than inherent sanctity.

### Part 2
§ <b>Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>ate</b> forbidden <b>fat and designated an offering</b> to atone for the transgression, <b>and</b> then <b>apostatized,</b> thereby disqualifying himself from bringing an offering, <b>and</b> later <b>recanted</b> his apostasy, <b>since</b> the offering was already <b>disqualified, it shall be disqualified</b> permanently.

### Part 3
<b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>ate</b> forbidden <b>fat and designated an offering</b> to atone for his transgression, <b>and</b> then <b>became an imbecile,</b> who is unfit to bring an offering, <b>and</b> then <b>again became</b> halakhically <b>competent, since</b> the offering was already <b>disqualified, it shall be disqualified</b> permanently.

### Part 4
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> both statements <b>are necessary. As, if</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>had taught us</b> only <b>the first</b> statement, concerning an apostate, one might have reasoned that the offering is permanently disqualified <b>because he disqualified himself by</b> his own <b>action, but here,</b> in the case of one who became an imbecile, <b>where he was disqualified</b> through a process that occurs <b>by itself,</b> when he becomes competent again he may bring his sacrifice, as it is <b>considered as</b> though he were <b>asleep.</b> If one designated an offering and fell asleep, this certainly does not disqualify it.

### Part 5
<b>And if</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>had taught us</b> only the statement <b>here,</b> with regard to one who became an imbecile, one might have reasoned that the offering is permanently disqualified <b>because it is not in his power to return</b> to competence, <b>but here,</b> in the case of an apostate, <b>since it is in his power to recant</b> his apostasy, <b>I would say</b> that the offering is <b>not</b> permanently disqualified. Therefore, both statements are <b>necessary.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>ate</b> forbidden <b>fat and designated an offering</b> for the transgression, <b>and</b> then the <b>court ruled that</b> the type of <b>fat</b> he ate is <b>permitted,</b> thereby rendering the offering unnecessary, <b>and</b> the court subsequently <b>retracted</b> its ruling, in this case, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Is</b> the offering permanently <b>disqualified, or is it not</b> permanently <b>disqualified?</b>

### Part 7
<b>A certain elder [<i>hahu sava</i>] said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>When Rabbi Yoḥanan introduced</b> the topic of permanently <b>disqualified</b> offerings, <b>he introduced</b> it <b>with this</b> case. <b>What is the reason? There,</b> in the case of one who apostatized or became an imbecile, although <b>the person was disqualified,</b> the <b>offering</b> itself <b>was not disqualified.</b> Consequently, it is less evident that the offering will be disqualified permanently. But <b>here,</b> in a case where the court ruled that the fat is permitted, the <b>offering</b> itself <b>was also disqualified,</b> as it was rendered unnecessary. Therefore, this is a more obvious example.

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Shimon ben Azzai said: I received</b> a tradition <b>from seventy-two elders [<i>zaken</i>]</b> that all slaughtered offerings that are eaten, if slaughtered not for their sake, are fit. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need to <b>teach</b> the phrase <b>seventy-two</b> elders using the singular form: <b><i>Zaken</i>,</b> rather than the plural form: <i>Zekenim</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Because they all maintained one opinion,</b> i.e., they all agreed with this <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 9
The mishna continues: <b>Ben Azzai added only the burnt offering</b> to the sin offering and the Paschal offering, which are mentioned in the first mishna as disqualified when sacrificed not for their sake.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Huna said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of ben Azzai?</b> The verse states: <b>“It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a pleasing aroma unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 1:13). The word <b>“it”</b> teaches that if it is sacrificed <b>for its sake,</b> it is <b>fit;</b> if sacrificed <b>not for its sake,</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: Isn’t the word <b>“it” written with regard to a guilt offering as well,</b> in the verse: “It is a guilt offering” (Leviticus 7:5)? Nevertheless, a guilt offering sacrificed not for its sake is not disqualified.

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is written after the burning of</b> the <b>sacrificial portions</b> on the altar. Since the offering is fit even if these portions are not burned at all, it is certainly fit if they are burned not for the sake of a guilt offering.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: Isn’t <b>this</b> mention of the word “it” with regard to a burnt offering <b>also written after the burning of</b> the <b>sacrificial portions</b> on the altar?

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: The word <b>“it” is written</b> with regard to a burnt offering in <b>two</b> places, both in Leviticus 1:13 and in Exodus 29:18. Although both are written after the burning of the portions consumed on the altar, one of them is superfluous, and is therefore interpreted in reference to the main sacrificial rites, performed before the burning of the portions. The verse therefore teaches that the offering is fit only if these rites are performed for its sake.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to a guilt offering as well,</b> isn’t the word <b>“it” written</b> in <b>two</b> places, Leviticus 5:9 and Leviticus 7:5?

### Part 16
<b>Rather, ben Azzai derives</b> his <i>halakha</i> not from a verse, but <b>by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a sin offering, which is not</b> totally <b>consumed</b> on the altar but partially eaten by priests, if <b>one slaughtered it not for its sake</b> it is <b>disqualified,</b> so too, with regard to <b>a burnt offering, which is</b> treated more strictly in that it is totally <b>consumed</b> on the altar, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that if it is slaughtered not for its sake it is disqualified?

### Part 17
The Gemara rejects this inference: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a sin offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that it atones</b> for sin, in contrast to a burnt offering, which is not brought for atonement. Therefore, only a sin offering is disqualified when sacrificed not for its sake.

### Part 18
The Gemara suggests: <b>A Paschal offering can prove</b> the point, as it is not brought for atonement, yet it is disqualified if sacrificed not for its sake.

### Part 19
The Gemara rejects this as well: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a Paschal offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that its time is set</b> at Passover eve, in contrast to a burnt offering, which does not have a designated time.

### Part 20
The Gemara suggests: If so, <b>a sin offering can prove</b> the point, since it has no set time. <b>And the inference has reverted</b> to its starting point. The <i>halakha</i> is derived from the common element of the two sources: <b>The aspect of this</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> case <b>and the aspect of that</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> case. <b>Their common element is that they are offerings, and</b> if one <b>slaughtered them not for their sake,</b> they are <b>disqualified. So too, I shall include a burnt offering</b> in this <i>halakha</i>, <b>as it is an offering, and</b> therefore if one <b>slaughtered it not for its sake,</b> it is <b>disqualified.</b>

### Part 21
The Gemara rejects this as well: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about their common element?</b> It is notable in <b>that they</b> both <b>have an element of <i>karet</i>.</b> A sin offering is brought for a transgression punishable by <i>karet</i> when committed intentionally, and one who refrains intentionally from bringing a Paschal offering is liable to be punished with <i>karet</i>. A burnt offering does not have an element of <i>karet</i>.

### Part 22
The Gemara answers: <b>Ben Azzai</b>
