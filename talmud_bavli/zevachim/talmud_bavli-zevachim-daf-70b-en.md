### Part 1
<b>When one approaches</b> the matter <b>this</b> first <b>way,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that forbidden fat is pure <b>applies</b> specifically <b>to kosher</b> animals, but <b>when one approaches</b> the matter <b>that</b> second <b>way,</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>applies</b> specifically <b>to non-kosher</b> animals. To decide the matter, <b>the verse states:</b> “The fat of <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> may be used for any other service” (Leviticus 7:24), indicating that only the forbidden fat of <b>those</b> animals <b>to whose species</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>tereifa</i> applies,</b> i.e., kosher animals, is ritually pure. The status of <i>tereifa</i> is immaterial to a non-kosher animal as its consumption is prohibited in any event.

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: One might still assume that <b>I will exclude</b> from this <i>halakha</i> only the forbidden fat of a carcass of <b>a non-kosher</b> animal, <b>as</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>tereifa</i> does not apply to its species, but I will not exclude</b> the fat of a carcass of <b>an undomesticated</b> kosher <b>animal, as</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>tereifa</i> applies to its species.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> in conclusion: <b>“But you shall in no way eat of it,”</b> indicating that the reference is only to animals <b>whose fat</b> is <b>forbidden</b> for consumption if slaughtered <b>but whose meat</b> is <b>permitted,</b> i.e., kosher domesticated animals. <b>Excluded</b> are kosher <b>undomesticated animals, whose fat and meat</b> are both <b>permitted</b> for consumption.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Ya’akov bar Abba said to Rava: If that is so,</b> it appears from the <i>baraita</i> that <b>the carcass of a kosher animal imparts impurity,</b> but <b>the carcass of a non-kosher animal does not impart impurity.</b> Rava <b>said to him: How many elders have you caused to err in</b> the interpretation of this <i>baraita</i>? In <b>the latter clause we come to</b> discuss only <b>the carcass of a non-kosher bird,</b> which does not impart impurity. By contrast, carcasses of non-kosher animals are impure.

### Part 4
§ In the mishna, Rabbi Meir states that a bird offering whose nape was pinched and was found to be a <i>tereifa</i> does not impart impurity as would a carcass. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Meir deemed pure only unblemished</b> birds whose napes were pinched, as they are fit to be sacrificed, <b>but</b> he did <b>not</b> deem pure <b>blemished</b> birds, which are not fit to be sacrificed. <b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> Rabbi Meir deemed <b>even blemished</b> birds pure and did not distinguish between the two. <b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rav Beivai says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Rabbi Meir would deem pure blemished</b> birds, <b>and</b> this was his opinion <b>even</b> concerning <b>geese and chickens,</b> species that may not be brought as offerings and as such are never supposed to be pinched.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> According to Rabbi Elazar’s understanding of Rabbi Meir’s opinion, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who <b>broke the neck of a goat?</b> Does the impurity of animal carcasses apply? The breaking of the neck is considered the proper procedure in certain cases, as the Torah commands that a heifer’s neck be broken if a murdered body is found between two cities and the identity of the murderer is unknown (see Deuteronomy 21:4).

### Part 6
One could claim: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>geese and chickens</b> are pure if their napes are pinched? It is <b>because they are species of birds</b> and the napes of some birds are pinched; <b>but a goat is not</b> of the same <b>species</b> as <b>a heifer,</b> as goats are considered small livestock whereas cattle are large livestock. <b>Or perhaps</b> one could claim: Since a goat <b>is</b> still <b>a species of domesticated animal,</b> it is similar enough to a heifer that the breaking of its neck prevents it from imparting impurity as a carcass.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Dimi was sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., this dilemma. <b>Abaye said to him: By inference</b> from this dilemma, it seems that you assume that <b>a heifer whose neck is broken is</b> itself <b>pure</b> and does not impart impurity as would a carcass. Rav Dimi <b>said to him: Indeed,</b> as the Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai say:</b> Since the language of <b>atonement is written with regard to</b> the heifer whose neck is broken, in the verse: “Forgive, Lord, Your people Israel” (Deuteronomy 21:8), just <b>as</b> atonement is written with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, the breaking of the heifer’s neck is equivalent to the pinching of the nape of a bird offering, and breaking its neck prevents the heifer from imparting ritual impurity.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Natan, father of Rav Huna bar Natan, raises an objection</b> based on a <i>baraita</i> concerning the purity of the forbidden fat of a kosher animal, mentioned in the verse: “And the fat of a carcass, and the fat of a <i>tereifa</i>, may be used for any other service; <b>but you shall in no way eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 7:24). <b>I have</b> derived from the verse <b>only</b> that forbidden <b>fat that</b> is <b>forbidden for consumption but from which</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> is <b>permitted</b> is pure. <b>From where</b> is it derived that this <i>halakha</i> also applies to the forbidden <b>fat of an ox that is stoned</b> by the court <b>or</b> the forbidden fat of <b>a heifer whose neck is broken,</b> from both of which one is prohibited from deriving benefit?

### Part 9
<b>The verse states:</b> “You shall eat <b>no fat</b> nor blood” (Leviticus 3:17). The generalization “no fat” indicates that the same <i>halakhot</i> apply to the forbidden fats of all domesticated kosher animals, including those from which one is prohibited from deriving benefit.

### Part 10
Rav Natan concludes his objection: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that the meat of <b>a heifer whose neck is broken is pure,</b> why must the verse teach that its forbidden fat is pure? Could one entertain the possibility that its meat <b>is pure but its</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> is <b>impure?</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara responds: The derivation in the <i>baraita</i> <b>was not necessary for</b> a case <b>where one broke the neck</b> of the heifer. <b>It was necessary</b> for the verse to teach that the forbidden fat is pure even in a case <b>where one slaughtered</b> a heifer whose neck was designated to be broken.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the <b>slaughter</b> itself <b>should be effective in purifying</b> the forbidden fat, as slaughter prevents an animal <b>from</b> assuming the impure status of <b>a carcass,</b> and the derivation is still superfluous. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach that the forbidden fat of a heifer <b>that died</b> before its neck could be broken is pure even though the heifer itself assumes that status of a carcass.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: If the <i>baraita</i> is referring only to a heifer that died before its neck could be broken, and it describes benefitting from it as being prohibited, <b>by inference,</b> is it <b>prohibited</b> to derive benefit from the heifer <b>while</b> it is still <b>alive?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Indeed,</b> as <b>Rabbi Yannai says: I heard</b> the <b>boundary,</b> i.e., stage, beyond which it is forbidden, <b>but I have forgotten</b> what it is, <b>and</b> yet the members of <b>the group</b> of scholars <b>were inclined to say</b> that <b>its descent to a hard valley</b> (see Deuteronomy 21:4), where its neck was broken, is the action that <b>renders it forbidden.</b>

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All the offerings that were intermingled with</b> animals from which deriving benefit is forbidden, e.g., <b>sin offerings</b> left to <b>die, or with an ox that</b> was sentenced to be <b>stoned, even</b> if the ratio is <b>one in ten thousand,</b> deriving benefit from them all is prohibited and <b>they all must die.</b> If the offerings <b>were intermingled with</b> animals whose sacrifice is forbidden but deriving benefit from them is not, the <i>halakha</i> is different. Examples of this are <b>an ox with which a transgression was performed,</b> which disqualifies it from being sacrificed as an offering, <b>or</b>
