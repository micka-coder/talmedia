<b>excluded is water of</b> the <b>Basin, which has a modifier</b> in its name? <b>Rather,</b> since the <i>baraita</i> cannot be referring to the water of the Basin itself, as it is unfit for washing the innards, <b>is it not</b> referring to water <b>that is fit to</b> be <b>water of</b> the <b>Basin? Apparently,</b> the only reason such water could be preferable is because it <b>is flowing water.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara responds: The issue <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>the water of</b> the <b>Basin, Rabbi Yishmael says: It</b> must be <b>spring water,</b> i.e., flowing water, <b>and the Rabbis say: It</b> may be <b>another</b> type of <b>water.</b>

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches that a priest who is <b>uncircumcised</b> disqualifies sacrificial rites he performs. The Gemara elaborates: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Rav Ḥisda says: We did not learn this matter from the Torah of Moses, our teacher;</b> rather, <b>we learned</b> it <b>from the words of</b> the prophet <b>Ezekiel, son of Buzi: “No stranger, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into My Sanctuary to serve Me”</b> (Ezekiel 44:9).

### Part 4
<b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that he desecrates</b> the <b>service</b> after the fact? <b>As it is written: “In that you have brought in strangers, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh, to be in My Sanctuary, to profane My house”</b> (Ezekiel 44:7).

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states <b>“stranger”;</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that this is referring to <b>an actual stranger,</b> i.e., a gentile. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Uncircumcised in heart,”</b> to indicate that it is referring to a priest rather than a gentile. <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Stranger”?</b> It is referring to one <b>whose actions are</b> considered <b>estranged from his Father in Heaven,</b> i.e., an apostate, who sins regularly. <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>one uncircumcised in heart</b> is unfit to serve; <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>one uncircumcised in flesh</b> is unfit as well? <b>The verse states: “Or uncircumcised in flesh.”</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> both phrases in the verse <b>are necessary. As, had the Merciful One written</b> only: <b>“Uncircumcised in flesh,”</b> one might think that only he is unfit <b>because he is disgusting</b> in that he possesses a foreskin, <b>but</b> concerning <b>one uncircumcised in heart, who is not disgusting, I will say</b> that he is <b>not</b> unfit. <b>And had</b> the verse <b>taught us</b> only that one <b>uncircumcised in heart</b> is unfit, one might think that only he is unfit, <b>because his heart is not</b> directed <b>toward Heaven, but one uncircumcised in flesh, whose heart is</b> directed <b>toward Heaven, I will say</b> that he is <b>not</b> unfit. Therefore, both phrases <b>are necessary.</b>

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches that a ritually <b>impure</b> priest is <b>unfit</b> for Temple service and disqualifies rites he performs. <b>The Elders of the South said: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> with regard to one who became <b>impure due to</b> contact with the carcass of <b>a creeping animal. But</b> with regard to a priest who became <b>impure due to</b> contact with <b>a corpse, since he can effect acceptance</b> of his rites <b>for communal</b> offerings <i>ab initio</i> if the majority of the community has contracted impurity from a corpse, <b>he can effect acceptance</b> of his rites <b>for individual</b> offerings <b>as well</b> after the fact.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let</b> it <b>be derived</b> that <b>one impure due to</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> can also effect acceptance for communal offerings in cases of communal impurity <i>ab initio</i>, and for individual offerings after the fact, <b>by <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from one impure due to a corpse: Just as</b> a priest who is <b>impure due to a corpse, who requires sprinkling</b> of the water containing the ashes of the red heifer on the <b>third and seventh</b> day to be purified, still <b>effects acceptance,</b> then with regard to <b>one</b> who is <b>impure due to</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal, who does not require sprinkling</b> on the <b>third and seventh</b> day, <b>is it not right that he</b> should also <b>effect acceptance?</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara responds: <b>The Elders of the South hold</b> that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>those who effect atonement</b> is <b>like those who achieve atonement: Just as</b> with regard to <b>those who achieve atonement</b> through communal offerings, i.e., the community, only if a majority is <b>impure due to a corpse may</b> the offering be sacrificed in a state of impurity, but if they are <b>impure due to</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> it may <b>not, so too</b> with regard to <b>those who effect atonement,</b> i.e., the priests, if they serve when they are <b>impure due to a corpse, yes,</b> their service achieves atonement, but if they serve when they are <b>impure due to the carcass of a creeping animal,</b> it does <b>not.</b>

### Part 10
The response of the Gemara assumes that communal offerings may not be brought when the majority of the community is impure due to a creeping animal. The Gemara therefore asks: <b>What do</b> the Elders of the South <b>hold</b> with regard to the Paschal offering? <b>If they hold</b> that <b>one may not slaughter</b> it <b>nor sprinkle</b> its blood on the altar <b>for</b> an owner who is <b>impure due to a creeping animal,</b> even though he can immerse and become pure in time to eat the offering that night, then one may ask: <b>Why can’t</b> the <b>community perform</b> communal offerings <b>in</b> such a state of <b>impurity? Isn’t</b> it a principle that for <b>any</b> impurity <b>for which an individual</b> may not sacrifice the Paschal offering and <b>is deferred</b> to the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, the <b>community may perform</b> its offerings <b>in</b> such a state of <b>impurity?</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rather, they</b> must <b>hold</b> that <b>one may slaughter</b> the Paschal offering <b>and sprinkle</b> its blood <b>for</b> an owner who is <b>impure due to a creeping animal.</b> Accordingly, the community may not offer the Paschal offering in such a state of impurity.

### Part 12
<b>Ulla says: Reish Lakish shouted [<i>teka</i>] to</b> the Elders <b>of the South: But which power is greater</b> to overcome impurity with respect to offerings, <b>the power of those who effect atonement,</b> i.e., the priests, <b>or the power of those who achieve atonement,</b> the offerings’ owners? Since the Elders of the South hold that the Paschal offering may be sacrificed for an owner who is impure due to a creeping animal, while a priest who is similarly impure may not sacrifice any offering, <b>you must say</b> that <b>the power of those who achieve atonement</b> is greater.

### Part 13
If so, your initial statement that a priest who contracted impurity from a corpse can effect acceptance for individual offerings can be refuted <i>a fortiori</i>: <b>And just as in a case where</b> the <b>owner became impure due to a creeping animal,</b> he <b>may send his offerings</b> for sacrifice, and yet <b>a priest who became impure due to a creeping animal cannot effect acceptance,</b> then in <b>a case where the owner became impure due to a corpse, where he may not send his offerings</b> for sacrifice, <b>is it not right that a priest who became impure due to a corpse cannot effect acceptance?</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara responds: <b>The Elders of the South hold</b> that an owner who is <b>impure due to a corpse may also send his offerings,</b> even though he will not be able to partake of his Paschal offering. Therefore, the <i>a fortiori</i> inference does not stand.

### Part 15
The Gemara protests: <b>But isn’t it written: “If any man of you or of your generations shall be impure</b> by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, <b>he shall perform the Paschal offering</b> to the Lord. <b>In the second month</b> on the fourteenth day at dusk they shall perform it” (Numbers 9:10–11)? Apparently, one impure due to a corpse in the first month must defer his Paschal offering to the second month. The Gemara responds: The verse intends this <b>as a mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i>. But if he sends his offering in the first month, it is accepted, and he is not required to sacrifice a Paschal offering in the second month.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written:</b> “And if the household be too little for a lamb, then shall he and his neighbor next to his house take one according to the number of the souls; <b>a man,</b>
