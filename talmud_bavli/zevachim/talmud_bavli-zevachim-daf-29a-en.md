### Part 1
indicates that to render an offering <i>piggul</i>, the priest <b>does not mix other</b> improper <b>intentions [<i>maḥashavot</i>] with</b> intent of <i>piggul</i>. If he has more than one type of improper intent, the offering is disqualified, but it is not rendered <i>piggul</i>.

### Part 2
When the verse states: <b>“<i>Piggul</i>,” this is</b> referring to an offering that one had intent to consume <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area.</b>

### Part 3
And since the verse states: <b>“It shall be,”</b> and not: They shall be, this <b>teaches that</b> intent to consume half an olive-bulk beyond its designated time and intent to consume half an olive-bulk outside its designated area <b>join together with one another</b> to constitute the minimum measure required to disqualify the offering.

### Part 4
Finally, when the verse states: <b>“And the soul that eats of it</b> shall bear his iniquity,” the term “of it” indicates that only <b>one</b> of the above disqualifications carries the penalty of <i>karet</i>, <b>but not two</b> of them. <b>And which is this?</b> It is intent to consume the offering <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, as</b> one <b>derives</b> by way of verbal analogy between <b>“iniquity”</b> and <b>“iniquity” from <i>notar</i></b> (Leviticus 19:8), that “bear his iniquity” means that one is liable to receive <i>karet</i>. The comparison is apt <b>since</b> <i>notar</i> <b>is similar to</b> intent to consume the offering beyond its designated time <b>in</b> that both prohibitions share the features mentioned above that form the acronym: <b><i>Zayin</i>, <i>beit</i>.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: According to your</b> opinion, in <b>what</b> way do <b>you interpret</b> the reference to the <b>third</b> day (Leviticus 19:7) <b>in the</b> Torah <b>portion</b> that begins: <b>“You shall be holy”?</b> Rava responded: <b>That</b> verse is <b>necessary to</b> teach <b>that</b> a given <b>location</b> is considered to be outside the offering’s designated area only if it <b>is</b> so <b>in three ways,</b> i.e., outside the permitted limits <b>of</b> the <b>blood, of</b> the <b>meat, and of</b> the <b>sacrificial portions.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: Why not <b>let me derive</b> that <i>halakha</i> <b>from the first verse:</b> “And <b>if</b> any of the flesh of his peace offerings <b>be at all eaten</b> on the third day” (Leviticus 7:18), <b>since the Merciful One expresses</b> that verse as well <b>with the term “third”?</b> Since Rava derives the disqualification of intent to consume an offering outside its designated area from this verse, why not let him derive this <i>halakha</i> from the verse as well?

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ashi said: I stated</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> before Rav Mattana,</b> and <b>he said to me: If</b> one were to derive this <i>halakha</i> only <b>from there</b> (Leviticus 7:18), <b>I would say:</b> The term <b>“third”</b> is <b>a detail,</b> and the term <b>“<i>piggul</i>”</b> is <b>a generalization, and</b> whenever a detail is followed by a generalization, <b>the generalization becomes an addition to the detail, and</b> consequently, all <b>other areas are included</b> as well. The additional verse <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> includes only those areas that are outside in three ways.

### Part 8
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And if any of the flesh of his peace offerings be at all eaten</b> on the third day, it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 7:18): <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: Bend your ear to hear</b> the true meaning of the verse: <b>The verse is speaking of one who intends to partake of his offering on the third day. Or</b> perhaps it is referring <b>only to</b> one <b>who</b> actually <b>partakes of his offering on the third day,</b> per the straightforward meaning of the verse? But that cannot be; would <b>you say</b> that <b>after</b> the offering <b>is fit</b> for the first two days, <b>it should then be disqualified</b> retroactively by being eaten on the third day?

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: Yes,</b> it could be disqualified retroactively. After all, <b>we find with regard to a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>], or a woman who experiences a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period [<i>zava</i>], or a woman who observes</b> a clean <b>day for a day</b> when she experiences a discharge, <b>that they</b> all <b>have the presumptive status of purity</b> after immersing. <b>But once they have seen</b> another discharge the same day, <b>they have negated</b> this status retroactively, and everything they had touched after immersing becomes impure. Therefore, <b>you as well should not be surprised about this</b> offering consumed beyond its designated time, <b>that even though it was rendered fit, it may then be disqualified</b> retroactively.

### Part 10
Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: But</b> the same verse <b>says: “He who offers</b> it,” indicating that the offering <b>is disqualified at the time of</b> its <b>offering, and it is not disqualified on the third</b> day. <b>Or</b> perhaps when the verse <b>says: “He who offers</b> it,” <b>this</b> is referring <b>only</b> to <b>the priest who sacrifices</b> the offering, indicating that he is disqualified. But if so, it would have been enough for the verse to state: He who offers shall not be credited. Therefore, <b>when it states</b> instead: “Neither shall it be credited to he who offers <b>it,”</b> this indicates that the verse <b>is speaking of the offering, and it is not speaking of the priest.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Ben Azzai says: Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “It”?</b> It is necessary <b>because</b> elsewhere <b>it is stated:</b> “When you shall vow a vow to the Lord your God, <b>you shall not delay paying it;</b> for the Lord your God will require it from you, and it will be sin in you” (Deuteronomy 23:22). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> one who <b>is late</b> in fulfilling <b>his vow</b> is included <b>in: “It shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 7:18). Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It,”</b> to indicate that <b>it,</b> an offering rendered <i>piggul</i>, <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>“It shall not be accepted,” but</b> the animal of <b>one who is late</b> in fulfilling <b>his vow is not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>“It shall not be accepted.”</b>

### Part 12
<b><i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> One can conclude that the verse (Leviticus 7:18) is referring to improper intention rather than improper consumption from the phrase <b>“neither shall it be credited [<i>yeḥashev</i>],”</b> which indicates that the offering <b>is disqualified by</b> improper <b>intention [<i>maḥashava</i>], and it is not disqualified</b> by consumption <b>on the third</b> day.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And ben Azzai,</b> who interprets the term “it” as excluding vows that were fulfilled late, <b>from where does he</b> derive <b>that the verse is speaking of</b> the <b>offering and not of</b> the <b>priest?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>he derives it from</b> the statement <b>of <i>Aḥerim</i></b> that the verse rules out disqualification on the third day itself. This would be necessary only if the verse is referring to the offering and not the priest. <b>Or, if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it is written: “They shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 22:25), <b>and: “It shall not be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 7:18), it is evident that the verse <b>is</b> referring to <b>an offering,</b> which may be accepted or may not be accepted.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to the statement of <b>ben Azzai</b> that one derives from the word “it” that <b>it,</b> i.e., <i>piggul</i>, is included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>“It shall not be accepted,” but</b> the animal of one who <b>is late</b> in fulfilling <b>his vow is not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>“It shall not be accepted,”</b> is this <i>halakha</i> <b>derived from here? It is derived from</b> the statement <b>of <i>Aḥerim</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a firstborn</b> animal <b>whose</b> first <b>year passed,</b> during which time it ought to have been sacrificed, <b>should be</b>
