### Part 1
when the <b>blood of a sin offering is below and</b> the <b>blood of a burnt offering is above,</b> in a case in which the blood of a burnt offering is sprayed as a second layer on top of the blood of a sin offering that has already been sprayed and absorbed into a garment, the garment <b>requires laundering.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rava asks:</b> When the <b>blood of a burnt offering is below and</b> the <b>blood of a sin offering is above, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Is</b> one required to launder a garment to remove the blood of a sin offering <b>because</b> the blood <b>touches</b> his garment, <b>and</b> in this case, <b>this</b> blood <b>is touching</b> the garment? <b>Or perhaps is</b> one required to launder it <b>because of</b> the <b>absorption</b> of the blood into the garment, <b>and,</b> in this case, since the garment has already absorbed the other blood, <b>this</b> garment <b>did not absorb</b> the blood? Rava <b>then resolves</b> his dilemma, ruling <b>that</b> such garments <b>do not require laundering.</b>

### Part 3
§ In a similar manner, with regard to the immersion of a garment that has become impure, <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>obvious to me</b> that if there is <b>blood on</b> one’s <b>garment,</b> it <b>interposes</b> between the water of immersion and the garment, such that the immersion is ineffective. <b>But if he is a butcher,</b> used to having blood on his garments, a bloodstain <b>does not interpose,</b> and the immersion is effective, since a substance is not considered an interposition if the one immersing is not particular about it. Similarly, if there is a stain of <b>fat [<i>revav</i>] on one’s garment,</b> it <b>interposes. But if he is a fat seller,</b> such a stain <b>does not interpose. Rava asks:</b> If there is both <b>blood and fat on</b> one’s <b>garment</b> when he immerses it, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 4
The Gemara challenges the question: <b>If he is a butcher, let me derive</b> that the stain interposes <b>due to</b> the <b>fat</b> that he is not used to having on his garments; <b>and</b> conversely, <b>if he is a fat seller, let me derive</b> that the stain interposes <b>due to</b> the stain of <b>blood</b> that he is not used to having on his garments. The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> this question is not superfluous; it is <b>necessary</b> with regard to a person <b>who works</b> both as <b>this,</b> a butcher, <b>and</b> as <b>that,</b> a fat seller. In such a case, the question is: Is it that <b>he is not particular with regard to one</b> stain, but <b>he is particular with regard to two</b> stains, so that the immersion is ineffective? <b>Or, perhaps,</b> is it that he is <b>not particular</b> even with regard <b>to two</b> stains, as neither is unusual for him? The Gemara provides no answer, and the question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A priest who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed, <b>and</b> a priest <b>who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering to complete the purification process, e.g., a <i>zav</i> and a leper who did not bring their requisite atonement offerings, who are not yet permitted to partake of sacrificial meat, <b>do not receive a share of sacrificial</b> meat along with the other members of the patrilineal priestly family serving in the Temple that day, in order <b>to partake</b> of it <b>in the evening</b> after the offerings were sacrificed, even though after nightfall he would be permitted to partake of the offerings.

### Part 7
A priest who is <b>an acute mourner,</b> i.e., if one of his relatives for whom he is obligated to mourn died that day, is permitted to <b>touch</b> sacrificial meat, as he is not ritually impure. <b>But he may not sacrifice</b> offerings, <b>and he does not receive a share</b> of sacrificial meat in order <b>to partake</b> of it <b>in the evening.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Blemished</b> priests, <b>whether</b> they are <b>temporarily blemished</b> or <b>whether</b> they are <b>permanently blemished, receive a share and partake</b> of the offerings with their priestly brethren, <b>but do not sacrifice</b> the offerings.

### Part 9
The principle is: <b>Any</b> priest <b>who is unfit for the service</b> that specific day <b>does not receive a share of the</b> sacrificial <b>meat, and anyone who has no</b> share <b>of the meat has no</b> share <b>in the hides</b> of the animals, to which the priests are entitled as well.

### Part 10
<b>Even</b> if the priest was <b>ritually impure</b> only <b>at the time of the sprinkling of the blood</b> of the offering <b>and</b> he was <b>pure at the time of the burning of</b> the <b>fats</b> of that offering, he still <b>does not receive a share of the meat, as it is stated: “He that sacrifices the blood of the peace offerings and the fat, from among the sons of Aaron, shall have the right thigh for a portion”</b> (Leviticus 7:33). One who cannot sprinkle the blood does not receive a share in the meat.
