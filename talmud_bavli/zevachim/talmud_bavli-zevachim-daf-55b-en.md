### Part 1
The Gemara clarifies: <b>With regard to what do they disagree? The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>three verses are written. One</b> verse serves <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>itself, that we require</b> that the slaughter take place at the <b>entrance of the Tent of Meeting. And one</b> verse serves <b>to render fit</b> slaughter at the <b>sides,</b> i.e., the entire length of the Temple courtyard eastward from the entrance, and not only that part which is directly in front of the entrance. <b>And one</b> verse serves <b>to disqualify the sides of the sides,</b> i.e., those parts of the courtyard that are not in front of the entrance at all. <b>And it was not necessary</b> to have <b>a verse</b> teach the fitness of slaughtering in the <b>north,</b> as it can be derived via an <i>a fortiori</i> inference.

### Part 2
<b>And Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that <b>one</b> verse is necessary <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>itself, that we require</b> slaughter at the <b>entrance of the Tent of Meeting. And one</b> verse serves <b>to render fit</b> slaughter in the <b>north</b> of the courtyard. <b>And one</b> verse serves <b>to render fit</b> slaughter at the <b>sides</b> of the courtyard. <b>But</b> according to him, <b>it was not necessary</b> to have <b>a verse</b> teach that the <b>sides of the sides</b> are not fit for the slaughter of the offering.

### Part 3
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What is different here that it is written: “At the entrance to the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), <b>and what is different there that it is written: “Before the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:8, 13)? The Gemara answers: This <b>teaches us</b> a matter <b>in accordance with that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Shmuel says. As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Peace offerings that one slaughtered</b> in the Temple <b>before the doors of the Sanctuary were opened are disqualified, as it is stated</b> with regard to peace offerings: <b>“And he shall slaughter it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), which teaches that it must be slaughtered <b>when</b> the entrance <b>is open</b> and serves as an actual entrance, <b>and not when it is locked.</b> As long as the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, or in the Temple the doors to the Sanctuary, remain closed, one may not sacrifice the peace offerings, and if they are sacrificed, they are disqualified.

### Part 4
<b>It was also stated: Mar Ukva bar Ḥama says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: Peace offerings that one slaughtered before the doors of the Sanctuary were opened are disqualified, as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“He shall slaughter it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2). This means <b>when the entrance of the Sanctuary is open, and not when it is locked.</b>

### Part 5
<b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>like this: Rav Ya’akov bar Aḥa says</b> that <b>Rav Ashi says: Peace offerings that one slaughtered before the doors of the Sanctuary were opened are disqualified. And in the Tabernacle,</b> which had no doors, peace offerings that were slaughtered <b>before</b> the <b>Levites erected the Tabernacle or after</b> the <b>Levites dismantled the Tabernacle are disqualified.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: It is <b>obvious</b> that if the door is <b>closed</b> but not locked it has the same status <b>as if it were locked.</b> The Gemara asks: If there is <b>a curtain</b> covering the entrance, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabbi Zeira says:</b> A curtain <b>itself is made only</b> to be used <b>like an open entrance,</b> and therefore it is not considered as if the entrance is closed.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if <b>a tall</b> item is blocking the entrance? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that a tall item does not render an entrance as closed, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: There were two wickets,</b> i.e., openings, <b>in the Chamber of Knives, and their height</b> was <b>eight</b> cubits. The function of these openings was <b>in order to render fit the entire</b> Temple <b>courtyard for the eating of offerings of the most sacred order, and</b> to render fit all of the Temple courtyard <b>for the slaughter of offerings of lesser sanctity.</b> Due to the openings, the western area of the courtyard was considered to be “before the Tent of Meeting.”

### Part 8
The Gemara explains the inference: <b>What, is</b> the reference to eight cubits <b>not</b> referring to the fact <b>that in front of</b> the wickets there was an obstruction <b>eight</b> cubits high? Nevertheless, the area outside of it is considered open to the Chamber of Knives. The Gemara answers: <b>No, their height</b> was <b>eight</b> cubits, i.e., the wickets themselves were eight cubits high.

### Part 9
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this explanation from a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 35a), which teaches: <b>All the gates that were there,</b> in the Temple, were <b>twenty cubits high and ten cubits wide.</b> If so, how could these wickets be only eight cubits high? The Gemara answers: The <b>wickets are different,</b> and they are not considered gates.

### Part 10
The Gemara questions the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>. How did the wickets render fit the entire Temple courtyard? <b>But there are</b> the <b>sides,</b> i.e., to the north and south of the Chamber of Knives, and the wickets faced only to the west. The Gemara answers <b>that they inserted</b> the wickets <b>in</b> the <b>corner</b> of the Chamber, so that one opened to the northwest, and one to the northeast.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the area <b>behind the Hall of the Ark Cover,</b> i.e., behind the Sanctuary, from where one could not see the entrance of the Temple courtyard or the two wickets? The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rami bar Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: There was a small niche behind the Hall of the Ark Cover,</b> which was <b>eight cubits high.</b> The function of this niche was <b>in order to render fit the entire</b> Temple <b>courtyard for the eating of offerings of the most sacred order, and</b> to render fit all of the Temple courtyard <b>for the slaughter of offerings of lesser sanctity. And this is as it is written:</b> “For the precinct westward, four at the causeway, and <b>two at the precinct”</b> (I Chronicles 26:18). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>“For the precinct [<i>laparbar</i>]”? Rabba bar Rav Sheila said:</b> It is <b>like one who says: Facing outward [<i>kelappei bar</i>].</b>

### Part 12
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> One is <b>liable for</b> entering the Temple courtyard in a state of <b>ritual impurity only with regard to</b>
