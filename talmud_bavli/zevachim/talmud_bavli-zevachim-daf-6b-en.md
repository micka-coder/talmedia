but <b>it did not atone</b> for him <b>before Heaven,</b> i.e., it is not accepted by God as a perfect offering.

### Part 2
<b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna with regard to the purification process of a leper (<i>Nega’im</i> 14:10): The verse states: <b>“And the rest of the oil that is in</b> the priest’s <b>hand</b> he shall put upon the head of the one that is to be purified, <b>to make atonement for him before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 14:18). This teaches that <b>if</b> the priest <b>placed</b> the oil on the leper’s head, <b>it atoned</b> for him, and he is purified, <b>but if he did not place</b> the oil on his head, <b>it did not atone</b> for him; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says:</b> Placement of the oil on the leper’s head <b>is a non-essential mitzva.</b> Therefore, <b>whether</b> the oil <b>was placed</b> on his head or <b>whether it was not placed</b> on his head, <b>it atoned</b> for him, <b>but</b> the verse <b>ascribes</b> the leper blame <b>as though it did not atone</b> for him.

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>As though it did not atone</b> for him? <b>If we say that it is necessary</b> for the leper <b>to bring another offering</b> of oil, <b>didn’t you say</b> that <b>whether</b> the oil <b>was placed</b> on his head or <b>whether it was not placed</b> on his head, <b>it atoned</b> for him? <b>Rather,</b> the meaning of the statement is as follows: <b>It atoned</b> for <b>the person,</b> but <b>did not atone</b> for him <b>before Heaven. Here too,</b> with regard to one who sacrificed an offering without placing hands on its head, the <i>baraita</i> apparently means that the offering <b>atoned</b> for the owner’s transgression, even if it did not atone for him before Heaven.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>There too,</b> with regard to the purification process of a leper, one can explain that the oil atoned for one matter and did not atone for another: It <b>atoned;</b> in other words, the <b>placement</b> of oil on the leper’s right <b>thumb and big toe,</b> which was performed, effected its atonement. But it <b>did not atone,</b> i.e., there still needs to be an atonement effected by <b>placement</b> of oil on <b>the</b> leper’s <b>head,</b> and another <i>log</i> of oil must be brought for the performance of that act.

### Part 5
The Gemara returns to the matter of atonement for transgressions committed after the offering’s designation. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> With regard to the communal peace offering of two <b>lambs</b> that accompanies the two loaves on <b><i>Shavuot</i>, for what</b> sin <b>are they brought?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara interrupts the citation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The</b> two <b>lambs</b> sacrificed on <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> are not brought for a sin; <b>they are peace offerings</b> brought with the annual public offering of two loaves of new wheat. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should be emended as follows: <b>For what</b> sin <b>are the goats</b> sacrificed on <b><i>Shavuot</i></b> as a sin offering <b>brought?</b>

### Part 7
Rabbi Shimon answers: They are brought <b>for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple,</b> by entering it while ritually impure, <b>or</b> for defiling <b>its sacrificial foods,</b> by partaking of them while ritually impure.

### Part 8
Rabbi Shimon continues: Once <b>the blood of</b> the <b>first</b> goat <b>is sprinkled</b> on the altar, thereby atoning for this defilement, <b>for what</b> sin <b>is</b> the <b>second one sacrificed?</b> It is sacrificed <b>for</b> any incident involving <b>impurity that</b> may have <b>occurred between</b> the sacrifice of <b>that</b> first goat <b>and</b> the sacrifice of <b>this</b> second goat. <b>Based on this, say</b> that <b>the Jewish people should have</b> had to <b>sacrifice their offerings at all times and at every moment,</b> as perhaps they sinned in the interim; <b>but the verse spared</b> them of this obligation.

### Part 9
The Gemara infers: <b>And here,</b> where an incident involving impurity occurred between the sacrifice of the two goats, is a case <b>where</b> the <b>positive mitzva</b> of distancing ritually impure people from the Temple was violated <b>after</b> the <b>designation</b> of the offering, as both goats were designated in advance. <b>And</b> nevertheless, the second goat <b>atones</b> for the violation. Evidently, an offering can atone for transgressions committed after its designation.

### Part 10
The Gemara rejects this inference: <b>If</b> both goats were <b>designated simultaneously,</b> this would <b>indeed</b> be evidence to that effect. But <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> they were <b>designated sequentially,</b> and an incident involving impurity may have occurred between their respective designations.

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges this assertion: <b>But shall we stand and say about the verse</b> mandating these two sin offerings <b>that when it is written, it is written</b> specifically with regard to a case <b>where</b> they are designated <b>sequentially?</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> the inference can be rejected for a different reason: <b>Do you say</b> that evidence can be adduced from <b>communal offerings? Communal offerings are different, as</b> the <b>court makes a non-verbal stipulation about them, in accordance with</b> what <b>Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Shmuel says. As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>communal offerings,</b> the slaughtering <b>knife,</b> i.e., the act of slaughter, <b>designates them for what they are.</b> The court stipulates that the second goat be consecrated as it is sacrificed, and it therefore atones for incidents of impurity that occur beforehand. Individual offerings, by contrast, are all designated in advance.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Yosef, son of Rav Shmuel, said to Rav Pappa: But does Rabbi Shimon accept</b> the opinion that <b>the court can make a non-verbal stipulation about</b> communal offerings? <b>Doesn’t Rav Idi bar Avin say</b> that <b>Rav Amram says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to animals designated as <b>daily offerings</b> but <b>which</b> in the end <b>were not necessary for</b> use by <b>the public,</b>
