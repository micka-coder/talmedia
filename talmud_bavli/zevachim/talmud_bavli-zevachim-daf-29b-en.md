<b>like disqualified consecrated</b> animals, <b>and it should be disqualified</b> from being sacrificed, as though it had developed a blemish.

### Part 2
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall eat before the Lord your God,</b> in the place which He shall choose to place His name there, <b>the tithe of your grain,</b> of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborns of your herds, and of your flocks” (Deuteronomy 14:23). The verse <b>juxtaposes a firstborn</b> animal <b>to</b> the <b>tithe</b> of grain to indicate that <b>just as</b> the <b>tithe is not disqualified</b> by being kept over <b>from</b> one <b>year to the next</b> (see Deuteronomy 14:28), <b>so too a firstborn</b> animal <b>is not disqualified</b> by being kept over <b>from</b> one <b>year to the next.</b> If so, one already derives from this verse that an offering is not disqualified even if it is brought late.

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: Nevertheless, the verse cited by ben Azzai <b>was necessary,</b> as without it, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this matter</b> applies only to <b>a firstborn, which is not for acceptance,</b> i.e., it does not serve to atone for any sin and is merely a gift for the priest, <b>but</b> with regard to other <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>that are for acceptance, say</b> that <b>they shall not effect acceptance</b> when brought late. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that even these others are not disqualified when brought late.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks further: <b>But still,</b> isn’t this <i>halakha</i> <b>derived from</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>elsewhere:</b> The verse states: “When you shall vow a vow to the Lord your God, you shall not delay paying it; for the Lord your God will require it from you; <b>and it will be sin in you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:22), indicating that there is sin in you, <b>but</b> there is <b>no sin in your offering,</b> and therefore it is not disqualified due to the delay?

### Part 5
The Gemara responds: <b>Ben Azzai requires that</b> verse to teach a different <i>halakha</i>: The phrase <b>“and it will be sin in you”</b> indicates that there will be sin in you, <b>but</b> there will <b>not</b> be <b>sin in your wife.</b> It might <b>enter your mind to say: Since Rabbi Elazar said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> who said: <b>A man’s wife does not die unless</b> his creditors <b>ask him for money</b> that he owes <b>and he does not have</b> it, <b>as it is stated: “If you do not have with what to pay, why should he take away your bed from under you?”</b> (Proverbs 22:27); therefore, one’s wife <b>also dies for this transgression of</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not delay,</b> since one has failed to fulfill his commitment. Consequently, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that the sin is imputed to him alone.

### Part 6
§ The <i>baraita</i> stated that <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> The phrase “neither shall it be credited” indicates that the offering <b>is disqualified by</b> improper <b>intention, and it is not disqualified</b> by consumption beyond its designated time <b>on the third</b> day. The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who derives this <i>halakha</i> from a different source, <b>what does he do with</b> the phrase <b>“neither shall it be credited”?</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara responds: <b>He requires it for</b> that <b>which Rabbi Yannai</b> says, <b>as Rabbi Yannai says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to intentions that they displace one another,</b> i.e., that an additional improper intention prevents the offering from being rendered <i>piggul</i>? <b>As it is stated: “Neither shall it be credited [<i>yeḥashev</i>],”</b> indicating that an offering is rendered piggul only if the priest does <b>not mix other</b> improper <b>intentions [<i>maḥashavot</i>] with</b> intent of <i>piggul</i>.

### Part 8
<b>And Rav Mari teaches</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who has</b> improper <b>intentions with regard to sacrificial</b> animals <b>is flogged</b> like one who transgressed a prohibition? <b>The verse states: “Neither shall it be credited [<i>lo yeḥashev</i>],”</b> i.e., one reads the verse as if it states: One shall not have improper intention [<i>lo y’ḥashev</i>].

### Part 9
<b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Mari:</b> But <b>it is a prohibition that does not involve an action, and</b> the principle is that <b>for</b> transgressing <b>any prohibition that does not involve an action one is not flogged.</b> Rav Mari <b>said to him: It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says: For</b> transgressing <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action one is flogged.</b>

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>This is the principle:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who slaughters</b> the animal, <b>or who collects</b> the blood, <b>or who conveys</b> the blood, <b>or who sprinkles</b> the blood, with intent <b>to partake of an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>partakes</b> of it, e.g., the meat of the offering, <b>or to burn an item whose</b> typical <b>manner</b> is such that one <b>burns</b> it on the altar, if his intent was to partake of or to burn the measure of <b>an olive-bulk outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> the offering is <b>disqualified, but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i> for</b> burning or partaking of <b>it.</b> If his intent was to do so <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> the offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> burning or partaking of <b>it, provided that the permitting factor,</b> the blood, <b>is sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva.</b>

### Part 11
<b>How</b> is <b>the permitting factor sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva?</b> If one <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>in silence</b> with no specific intent, and <b>he collected and conveyed and sprinkled</b> the blood with intent to burn or partake of the offering <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time; or</b> if one <b>slaughtered</b> it with intent to burn or partake of the offering <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, and he collected and conveyed and sprinkled</b> the blood <b>in silence; or</b> if one <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>and collected and conveyed and sprinkled</b> the blood with intent to burn or partake of the offering <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, that is</b> the case <b>where</b> one <b>sacrifices the permitting factor in accordance with its mitzva.</b>

### Part 12
<b>How</b> is <b>the permitting factor not sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva?</b> If one <b>slaughtered</b> the animal with intent to burn it or partake of it <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> and <b>he collected and conveyed and sprinkled</b> the blood with intent to burn it or partake of it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time; or</b> if one <b>slaughtered</b> the animal with intent to burn it or partake of it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> and <b>collected and conveyed and sprinkled</b> the blood with intent to burn it or partake of it <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area; or</b> if one <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>and collected and conveyed and sprinkled</b> the blood with intent to burn it or partake of it <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> these are cases in which the permitting factor is not sacrificed in accordance with the mitzva.

### Part 13
Similarly, in the case of <b>the Paschal offering and the sin offering that one slaughtered not for their sake, and</b> one <b>collected and conveyed and sprinkled</b> the blood with intent to burn it or partake of it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time; or</b> if one <b>slaughtered</b> the Paschal offering or sin offering with intent to burn it or partake of it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> and <b>he collected and conveyed and sprinkled</b> the blood <b>not for their sake; or that one slaughtered</b> the Paschal offering or sin offering <b>and collected and conveyed and sprinkled their blood not for their sake, that is</b> the case of an offering <b>whose permitting factor is not sacrificed in accordance with its mitzva.</b>

### Part 14
If one performed one of the sacrificial rites with the intent <b>to eat an olive-bulk outside</b> its designated area and <b>an olive-bulk the next day,</b> or <b>an olive-bulk the next day</b> and <b>an olive-bulk outside</b> its designated area, or <b>half an olive-bulk outside</b> its designated area and <b>half an olive-bulk the next day,</b> or <b>half an olive-bulk the next day</b> and <b>half an olive-bulk outside</b> its designated area, the offering is <b>disqualified and there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i> for</b> burning or partaking of <b>it.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>this is the principle:</b> In <b>any</b> case <b>where the intent</b> with regard to <b>the time preceded the intent</b> with regard to <b>the area,</b> the offering is <b><i>piggul</i> and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> burning or partaking of <b>it. And if the intent</b> with regard to <b>the area preceded the intent</b> with regard to <b>the time,</b> the offering is <b>disqualified and there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i> for</b> burning or partaking of <b>it. And the Rabbis say:</b> In both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case, the offering is <b>disqualified and there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i> for</b> burning or partaking of <b>it.</b> If his intent was <b>to eat half an olive-bulk</b> and <b>to burn half an olive-bulk</b> not at the appropriate time or in the appropriate area, the offering is <b>fit because eating and burning do not join together.</b>

### Part 16
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the disagreement between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis concerning a case where one has intent with regard to both time and area, <b>Ilfa says:</b> There is <b>a disagreement</b> only <b>with regard to two</b> sacrificial <b>rites,</b> i.e., where each intent was held during a different rite, <b>but</b> if both were held <b>in</b> the course of <b>one rite, all agree</b> that <b>it constitutes a combination of intentions,</b> and the offering is not rendered <i>piggul</i>. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even</b> if the intentions were both held <b>in</b> the course of <b>one rite,</b> there is still <b>a disagreement.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the mishna is understandable <b>according to Ilfa, since the first clause</b> of the mishna: If one slaughtered the animal in silence with no specific intent and collected…beyond its designated time, etc., is referring to different intentions held <b>in</b> the course of <b>two</b> sacrificial <b>rites,</b> one can assume that <b>the latter clause</b> is referring <b>to two rites as well. But according to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> could it be that <b>the first clause</b> is referring <b>to two rites, and the latter clause</b> is referring <b>to</b> only <b>one rite?</b>
