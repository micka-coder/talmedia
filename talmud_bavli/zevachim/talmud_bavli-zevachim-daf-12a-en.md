### Part 1
<b>as it is juxtaposed with</b> the lighting of the <b>lamps</b> (see Exodus 30:8). Evidently, it is burned in the afternoon as well.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: Just as it is written explicitly that the Candelabrum must be lit in the evening, <b>there too,</b> with regard to a Paschal offering, <b>it is written: “There you shall sacrifice the Passover offering at evening”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:6). How can ben Beteira claim that it may be sacrificed all day long?

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>comes to</b> teach a different <i>halakha</i>, that a certain <b>item should be</b> sacrificed <b>after</b> another item. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the order of precedence between the Paschal offering and the daily afternoon offering: <b>An item,</b> i.e., the Paschal offering, <b>with regard to which</b> both the expressions: <b>“In the evening,” and: “<i>Bein ha’arbayim</i>,”</b> are <b>stated, should be</b> sacrificed <b>after an item,</b> the daily afternoon offering, <b>with regard to which only “<i>bein ha’arbayim</i>” is stated.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But is there anything</b> comparable to ben Beteira’s suggestion, <b>that if one slaughters it in the morning, you say</b> that <b>it is its</b> designated <b>time</b> and it is fit; <b>but when afternoon comes, you say</b> that the <b>item should be</b> sacrificed only <b>after</b> the daily afternoon offering?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> there is a precedent; <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one did not recite the additional prayers of Shabbat, the New Moon, or a Festival, which should be recited in the morning, until it is time for the afternoon prayer, the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that he should first <b>recite the afternoon prayer, and recite the additional prayers thereafter.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the term <b>“<i>bein ha’arbayim</i>”</b> is referring to the entire day, as ben Beteira maintains, <b>why do I</b> need those instances of the expression <b>that</b> are <b>written with regard to</b> burning <b>incense and</b> lighting the <b>lamps,</b> which are not performed all day?

### Part 7
<b>Furthermore,</b> this interpretation of the opinion of ben Beteira is difficult, as <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>responded on behalf of ben Beteira to the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua</b> that a Paschal offering slaughtered not for its sake on the morning of the fourteenth of Nisan is fit, as though it were slaughtered on the thirteenth: <b>No, if you said</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> the <b>thirteenth, as no part of</b> the day is <b>fit</b> for sacrificing the Paschal offering, <b>shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> the <b>fourteenth, part of which</b> is <b>fit</b> for sacrificing the Paschal offering? Since it can be sacrificed in the afternoon of the fourteenth, if it is slaughtered in the morning not for its sake, it is disqualified.

### Part 8
The Gemara concludes: <b>And if it is so</b> that a Paschal offering can be sacrificed throughout the day of the fourteenth, <b>all of it is fit,</b> not only part of it.

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Oshaya’s interpretation of ben Beteira’s opinion is rejected. Instead, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: With regard to a Paschal offering that one slaughtered on the fourteenth in the morning, ben Beteira would deem</b> it <b>unfit, whether</b> it was slaughtered <b>for its sake or not for its sake.</b> It is unfit even if it was slaughtered not for its sake, <b>since part of</b> the day is <b>fit</b> for its sacrifice as a Paschal offering.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Abbahu ridiculed [<i>megaddef</i> ]</b> this interpretation: <b>If so, how can you find a fit Paschal offering according to ben Beteira? If</b> its owner <b>designated</b> an animal <b>now,</b> on the morning of the fourteenth, as a Paschal offering, <b>it is disqualified from the outset,</b> as it cannot be sacrificed at all, either for its sake or not for its sake. <b>And</b> even <b>if</b> its owner <b>designated it the previous day,</b> when it was fit to be sacrificed not for its sake, <b>it was fit and</b> then <b>disqualified</b> the next morning, when it was no longer fit to be sacrificed until the afternoon. Once an offering is disqualified, it can no longer become fit.

### Part 11
<b>Rather, Rabbi Abbahu says: Let</b> the Paschal offering <b>be</b> fit when it is designated on the fourteenth <b>after noon,</b> when it may already be sacrificed as a Paschal offering.

### Part 12
<b>Abaye says: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that it is fit if designated <b>in the morning,</b> as an offering is <b>not</b> disqualified due to the fact that it is an offering <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived if its time will arrive <b>on that same day.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav Pappa says: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that it is fit if designated <b>from</b> the previous <b>night,</b> as an offering that was designated at <b>night</b> and may be sacrificed the following day is <b>not</b> considered an offering <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, <b>as it is taught in the school of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> Although an animal is unfit for sacrifice until its eighth day, on the <b>night</b> before its <b>eighth</b> day it may already <b>enter the den to be tithed.</b>

### Part 14
<b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Appetoriki, as Rabbi Appetoriki raises a contradiction: It is written:</b> “When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born, <b>then it shall be seven days with its mother”</b> (Leviticus 22:27); <b>consequently,</b> on the following <b>night,</b> i.e., the night before the eighth day, <b>it is fit</b> for sacrifice. <b>And it is written</b> subsequently in that verse: <b>“But from the eighth day and on it may be accepted</b> for an offering made by fire unto the Lord”; <b>consequently,</b> on the previous <b>night,</b> i.e., the night before the eighth day, <b>it is not</b> yet <b>fit.</b>

### Part 15
<b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? At <b>night</b> it is fit <b>for consecration, and</b> the following <b>day</b> it is fit <b>for effecting acceptance,</b> i.e., for sacrifice. Apparently, an offering that may be sacrificed the following day can be consecrated the previous night, even though it may not be sacrificed at night, and it is not considered an offering whose time has not yet arrived.

### Part 16
§ Rabbi Abbahu presumes that an animal consecrated before it may be sacrificed is disqualified. With regard to this, <b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Abbahu: Shall we say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan holds</b> that consecrated <b>animals</b> that cannot be sacrificed at any given moment <b>are disqualified</b> from ever being sacrificed?

### Part 17
Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him: Yes, as Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>an animal belonging to two partners,</b> if one of them <b>consecrated</b> the <b>half of it</b> that belongs to him, <b>and then purchased</b> the other <b>half of it</b> from his partner <b>and consecrated it, it is consecrated,</b> despite the fact that it was consecrated piecemeal. <b>But it may not be sacrificed,</b> since when he first consecrated it, the consecration did not extend to his partner’s half. Since the animal was not fit to be sacrificed then, it is disqualified permanently.

### Part 18
<b>But</b> as it is consecrated now, it can <b>render</b> consecrated as <b>a substitute</b> a non-sacred animal that is exchanged for it. If the owner substitutes a non-sacred animal for this one, the second animal becomes consecrated as well. <b>And</b> yet <b>its substitute is like it;</b> it too is consecrated but cannot be sacrificed.

### Part 19
<b>And</b> one can <b>conclude three</b> points <b>from</b> this statement: <b>Conclude from it</b> that <b>animals</b> that cannot be sacrificed <b>are</b> permanently <b>disqualified; and conclude from it</b> that <b>disqualification from the outset,</b> i.e., from the time the offering is consecrated, <b>is</b> permanent <b>disqualification; and conclude from it</b> that
