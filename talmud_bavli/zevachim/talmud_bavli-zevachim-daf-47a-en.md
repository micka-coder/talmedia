### Part 1
<b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who acts unawares</b> in the case <b>of consecrated</b> items, i.e., if one slaughtered an offering without intending to perform the act of slaughter at all, but rather like one occupied with other matters, <b>that</b> the offering <b>is disqualified?</b> Rav Huna said to Shmuel: It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter the young bull before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 1:5), teaching that the mitzva is not performed properly <b>unless the slaughter is for the sake of a young bull,</b> i.e., knowing that he is performing an act of slaughter.

### Part 2
Shmuel <b>said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>We have this</b> as an established <i>halakha</i> already, that it is a mitzva to slaughter the offering for the sake of a bull, but <b>from where</b> is it derived that this requirement is <b>indispensable?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him</b> that the verse states: <b>“With your will you shall slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 19:5), i.e., <b>with your</b> full <b>awareness you shall slaughter</b> it, in the form of a purposeful action.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Because the intent follows only the one performing the</b> sacrificial <b>rite.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, says: I heard that</b> even <b>the owner</b> of an offering <b>can render it <i>piggul</i></b> through improper intention. <b>Rava says: What is the reason of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei? As the verse states: “Then he who sacrifices shall sacrifice</b> his offering to the Lord” (Numbers 15:4). The term “he who sacrifices” is a reference to the owner; since the owner is considered one who sacrifices, he too can render his offering <i>piggul</i> with an improper intention.

### Part 4
<b>Abaye says: Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, and Rabbi Eliezer, and Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar all hold</b> that even in a case involving two people, where <b>this one has intention and that one performs the service, it is</b> the <b>intention</b> that is relevant, i.e., it is as though the one performing the service had the intention. The Gemara explains: The statement of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> is <b>that which we</b> just <b>said,</b> that the owner can render his offering <i>piggul</i> through improper intention despite the fact that it is the priest who performs the service.

### Part 5
The statement of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 38b): With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal on behalf <b>of a gentile, his slaughter is valid</b> and a Jew may eat the meat of this animal. <b>But Rabbi Eliezer deems it unfit,</b> as the intention of the gentile, which is presumably to use the animal for idol worship, invalidates the act of slaughter performed by the Jew.

### Part 6
The statement of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> is <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar stated a principle:</b> In the case of <b>any</b> item <b>that is not fit to be stored, and</b> therefore people do <b>not</b> typically <b>store</b> items <b>like it,</b> but <b>it was deemed fit</b> for storage <b>by this</b> person <b>and he stored it, and another</b> person <b>came and carried out</b> on Shabbat the item that was stored, <b>that</b> one who carried it out <b>is rendered liable by the thought of this</b> one who stored it.

### Part 7
The Gemara notes: <b>These two</b> Sages, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, although their rulings are stated in the context of entirely different matters, <b>accept</b> as <i>halakha</i> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Now</b> that concerning matters <b>outside</b> the Temple, i.e., non-sacred slaughter and carrying on Shabbat, with regard to which the Torah makes no reference to intention, <b>we say</b> that the intention of one person is effective for the action of another, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that the same <i>halakha</i> applies to matters <b>inside</b> the Temple, i.e., offerings, with regard to which it is explicitly stated that intention is effective, as indicated by the verse: “With your will you shall slaughter it” (Leviticus 19:5)?

### Part 8
But <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, does not</b> necessarily <b>accept</b> as <i>halakha</i> the rulings of <b>these two</b> Sages, Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. The Gemara explains: <b>Perhaps</b> it is only concerning <b>inside</b> the Temple <b>that we say</b> that one person’s intention is effective for the action of another, whereas concerning <b>outside</b> the Temple, <b>we do not say</b> this.

### Part 9
The Gemara further differentiates between the opinions of those two Sages themselves. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar accepts</b> as <i>halakha</i> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Eliezer: Now</b> that <b>with regard to Shabbat we say</b> that the intention of one person is effective for the action of another, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that the same applies <b>concerning idol worship,</b> where the actions are somewhat similar to those performed in the Temple?

### Part 10
But <b>Rabbi Eliezer does not</b> necessarily <b>accept</b> as <i>halakha</i> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar: Perhaps it is</b> only <b>with regard to idol worship that you say</b> that one person’s intention is effective for the action of another, as idol worship is somewhat <b>similar to</b> service performed <b>inside</b> the Temple. Consequently, it is reasonable that one person’s intention is effective for the action of another in the case of idolatry, as it does for offerings. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat, the Torah prohibited</b> only <b>planned,</b> constructive <b>labor,</b> i.e., one is liable only for an action that includes the creative intent of the doer, and here the one who took the item out did not intend to perform a labor.
