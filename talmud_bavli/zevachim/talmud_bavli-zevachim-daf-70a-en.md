### Part 1
The Gemara challenges: According to <b>this</b> logic, one can <b>also derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the forbidden fat of the carcass of a non-kosher animal is impure <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“And the fat of a carcass,</b> and the fat of a <i>tereifa</i>, may be used for any other service” (Leviticus 7:24), which teaches that such forbidden fat is ritually pure.

### Part 2
The continuation of the verse: “But you shall in no way eat of it,” indicates that the verse renders pure only fat <b>that</b> is <b>forbidden</b> specifically <b>due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat the</b> forbidden <b>fat of a carcass,</b> i.e., the forbidden fat of kosher animals. This serves <b>to exclude this</b> forbidden fat of a non-kosher animal, <b>which is not forbidden due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat the</b> forbidden <b>fat of a carcass,</b> but <b>rather due to</b> the prohibition against eating <b>a non-kosher</b> animal. Since the verse that states that fats are ritually pure is referring only to kosher animals, the forbidden fat of a carcass of a non-kosher animal must be impure. Rav Sheizevi’s derivation of this <i>halakha</i> from the word <i>tereifa</i> is therefore superfluous.

### Part 3
<b>Rather, this</b> word <b>“<i>tereifa</i>” is necessary to include</b> the forbidden fat of a carcass of a kosher <b>undomesticated animal,</b> to teach that it is ritually pure; as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that only the forbidden fat of carcasses of <b>those</b> animals <b>whose fat is forbidden and whose meat</b> is <b>permitted</b> if slaughtered, i.e., kosher domesticated animals, is ritually pure, and this serves <b>to exclude this</b> forbidden fat of carcasses of those animals <b>whose fat and meat are</b> both <b>permitted</b> if slaughtered, i.e., kosher undomesticated animals, whose fat is impure. To counter this possibility, the word “<i>tereifa</i>” <b>teaches us</b> that the fat of a carcass of any animal that can become a <i>tereifa</i> is ritually pure, including the fat of kosher undomesticated animals.

### Part 4
<b>He said to him:</b> If it is derived from the verse that the forbidden fat of a carcass of a kosher undomesticated animal is pure, <b>what is different</b> about <b>a non-kosher</b> animal that would cause its forbidden fat to be impure? If the difference is <b>that its fat is not distinct from its meat,</b> as both are forbidden for consumption, <b>the fat of</b> a kosher <b>undomesticated animal is also not distinct from its meat,</b> as both are permitted. <b>And furthermore, isn’t it written</b> later in the verse: <b>“But you shall in no way eat of it”</b> (Leviticus 7:24)? This phrase is interpreted (70b) as excluding the fat of undomesticated animals, teaching that it is impure.

### Part 5
<b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> The word <b>“<i>tereifa</i>”</b> in this verse <b>was necessary for its own</b> sake, to teach that the forbidden fat of a carcass of a <i>tereifa</i> of a kosher domesticated animal is pure. The inclusion of the word teaches <b>that you should not say</b> that <b>since a non-kosher</b> animal is <b>forbidden while</b> still <b>alive, and a <i>tereifa</i></b> is <b>forbidden while</b> still <b>alive,</b> therefore <b>just as the</b> forbidden <b>fat of a non-kosher</b> animal is <b>impure, so too the</b> forbidden <b>fat of a <i>tereifa</i></b> is <b>impure.</b> The word “<i>tereifa</i>” therefore teaches that it is pure.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: But <b>if so,</b> i.e., if one could have learned the <i>halakha</i> of the forbidden fat of a <i>tereifa</i> from the <i>halakha</i> of the forbidden fat of a non-kosher animal, then <b>this</b> word “<i>tereifa</i>” in the verse concerning the impurity of a kosher bird carcass (Leviticus 17:15) <b>is also necessary</b> for its own sake, to teach that the carcass of a kosher bird that is a <i>tereifa</i> is impure. It is necessary for this to be written with regard to the carcass of a kosher bird so <b>that you should not say</b> as follows: <b>Since a non-kosher bird</b> is <b>forbidden for consumption, and a <i>tereifa</i></b> is <b>forbidden for consumption,</b> therefore <b>just as a non-kosher bird does not impart impurity, so too a <i>tereifa</i> does not impart impurity.</b> According the Rabbi Yehuda, the word is necessary to include the slaughtered kosher bird that is a <i>tereifa</i>, not a carcass.

### Part 7
<b>And furthermore, is it</b> possible <b>to derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a <i>tereifa</i> from</b> that concerning <b>a non-kosher</b> animal, as suggested? The two cases are incomparable, as <b>a non-kosher</b> animal <b>never had a kosher period</b> before being forbidden, whereas <b>a <i>tereifa</i> had a kosher period</b> before becoming a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And if you would say: What can be said</b> with regard to an animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i> from the womb,</b> which never had a kosher period? <b>In any event, there are</b> kosher animals <b>among its species,</b> i.e., the <i>tereifa</i> is a member of a kosher species, which cannot be said of a non-kosher animal.

### Part 8
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The word <i>tereifa</i> in the verse concerning forbidden fat (Leviticus 7:24) teaches a different <i>halakha</i>. By stating: “But you shall in no way eat of it,” referring to the forbidden fat of a carcass, <b>the Torah states: Let the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a carcass come and take effect</b> where <b>the prohibition of</b> eating forbidden <b>fat</b> already exists. One who eats the forbidden fat of a carcass is liable both for eating forbidden fat and for eating from a carcass. Likewise, the word “<i>tereifa</i>” in the verse teaches: <b>Let the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i> come and take effect</b> where <b>the prohibition of</b> eating forbidden <b>fat</b> already exists, so that one who eats the forbidden fat of a <i>tereifa</i> is liable for transgressing two prohibitions.

### Part 9
<b>And</b> both the word “carcass” and the word “<i>tereifa</i>” <b>are necessary,</b> even though they teach similar <i>halakhot</i>. <b>As, had</b> the verse <b>taught us</b> about additional liability only with regard to the forbidden fat of <b>a carcass,</b> one might have thought that it applies to only a carcass, <b>as it imparts ritual impurity, but</b> with regard to <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> which does not, one might <b>say</b> that the additional liability does <b>not</b> apply. <b>And had</b> the verse <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> only with regard to <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> one might have thought that it applies only to a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>as its prohibition</b> takes effect <b>while</b> it is still <b>alive, but</b> with regard to <b>a carcass,</b> which becomes forbidden only when it dies, one might <b>say</b> that it does <b>not</b> apply. Both words are therefore <b>necessary.</b>

### Part 10
§ The Gemara has established that according to Rabbi Yehuda, the word “<i>tereifa</i>” in the verse concerning the impurity of a kosher bird carcass (Leviticus 17:15) teaches that a slaughtered bird that is a <i>tereifa</i> imparts ritual impurity. The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi Meir,</b> who holds that a slaughtered bird that is a <i>tereifa</i> does not impart ritual impurity, <b>do with this</b> word <b>“<i>tereifa</i>”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is necessary to exclude</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of non-sacred birds <b>that</b> occurs <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, teaching that it does not cause them to impart ritual impurity as would a carcass, even though they are forbidden for consumption.

### Part 11
<b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Another</b> instance of the word <b><i>tereifa</i> is written</b> concerning the ritual impurity of birds: “A carcass, or a <i>tereifa</i>, he shall not eat to become impure with it” (Leviticus 22:8). Rabbi Yehuda derives the <i>halakha</i> from this verse.

### Part 12
<b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Meir</b> interpret the appearance of the word <i>tereifa</i> in both verses? The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> is necessary <b>to ex-clude</b> the <b>slaughter that</b> occurs <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard as mentioned above, <b>and one</b> is necessary <b>to exclude a non-kosher bird,</b> to teach that the carcass of a non-kosher bird does not impart ritual impurity.

### Part 13
<b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> derive that the carcass of a non-kosher bird does not impart ritual impurity? The Gemara answers: He <b>derives it from</b> the word <b>“carcass”</b> in the verse: “A carcass, or a <i>tereifa</i>, he shall not eat to become impure with it” (Leviticus 22:8), which indicates that only carcasses of birds that are forbidden for consumption due to their status as a carcass are impure. Non-kosher birds are forbidden due to their non-kosher status, not due to their status as a carcass.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi Meir do with this</b> word <b>“carcass”?</b> The Gemara answers: Since the verse mentions eating, Rabbi Meir holds that the word “carcass” is written <b>to</b> teach that the minimum <b>measure of consumption</b> of the meat of a bird carcass that renders one impure is <b>an olive-bulk,</b> which is the standard legal measure of consumption for Torah laws in general.

### Part 15
The Gemara challenges: <b>But let him derive</b> this measure <b>from the first verse:</b> “And every soul that eats a carcass…shall be impure” (Leviticus 17:15), <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One expresses</b> this <i>halakha</i> using <b>the language of consumption.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara responds: Both verses are necessary, <b>one to</b> indicate that <b>the measure of consumption</b> that renders one impure is <b>an olive-bulk, and one to</b> indicate that <b>the</b> maximum <b>measure of</b> time for <b>consumption</b> of the olive-bulk is the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread. One who takes longer than this standard measure of time will not contract impurity.

### Part 17
It is necessary for the Torah to indicate this latter <i>halakha</i> as well, as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since</b> the impurity of carcasses of birds <b>is a novelty,</b> as one contracts it by eating rather than by touching or carrying, perhaps its <i>halakhot</i> are unusually stringent and even one who eats an olive-bulk in <b>more than</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread <b>should also contract impurity.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> otherwise.

### Part 18
§ The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> concerning the impurity of the forbidden fat of a carcass. <b>The Sages taught:</b> When the verse: <b>“And the fat of a carcass, and the fat of a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> may be used for any other service” (Leviticus 7:24) teaches that such fat is pure, <b>the verse speaks of the</b> forbidden <b>fat of a kosher animal.</b>

### Part 19
The <i>baraita</i> challenges: <b>Do you say</b> that <b>the verse speaks of the</b> forbidden <b>fat of a kosher animal, or</b> perhaps does it <b>only</b> speak <b>of the</b> forbidden <b>fat of a non-kosher animal?</b>

### Part 20
<b>You</b> may <b>say</b> in response: The Torah <b>renders</b> a slaughtered animal <b>pure</b> of the impurity of a carcass <b>due to the fact</b> that it was ritually <b>slaughtered. And</b> likewise the Torah <b>renders</b> the forbidden fat of a carcass <b>pure, due to the fact</b> that it is forbidden <b>fat.</b> Therefore, the two cases are comparable: <b>Just as when</b> the Torah <b>renders</b> a slaughtered animal <b>pure due to the fact</b> that it was <b>slaughtered,</b> it is referring only <b>to a kosher</b> animal <b>and not to a non-kosher</b> animal, which is impure even when ritually slaughtered, <b>so too, when</b> the Torah <b>renders</b> forbidden fat <b>pure due to the fact</b> that it is forbidden <b>fat,</b> it is referring only <b>to a kosher</b> animal <b>and not to a non-kosher</b> animal.

### Part 21
The <i>baraita</i> challenges: <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>go this way</b> and maintain that since the Torah <b>renders</b> the carcass of a non-kosher animal ritually <b>pure,</b> removing it <b>from the category of a carcass, and</b> likewise the Torah <b>renders</b> the forbidden fat of a carcass <b>pure, due to the fact</b> that it is forbidden <b>fat;</b> therefore, the two cases are comparable: <b>Just as when</b> the Torah <b>renders</b> the carcass of a non-kosher animal <b>pure,</b> removing it <b>from the category of a carcass,</b> it is referring only <b>to a non-kosher</b> animal <b>and not to a kosher</b> animal, the carcass of which imparts impurity, <b>so too, when</b> the Torah <b>renders</b> forbidden fat <b>pure due to the fact</b> that it is forbidden <b>fat,</b> it is referring only <b>to a non-kosher</b> animal <b>and not to a kosher</b> animal.
