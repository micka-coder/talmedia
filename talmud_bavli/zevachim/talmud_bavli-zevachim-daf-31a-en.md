### Part 1
<b>Now</b> that Rabbi Yehuda concedes that even: <b>An olive-bulk and an olive-bulk,</b> is one <b>general</b> term, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to inquire with regard to: <b>An olive-bulk the next day outside?</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara presents <b>another version</b> of this discussion: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi might say that if Rabbi Yehuda maintains that even when one says: <b>An olive-bulk the next day outside,</b> each term is considered <b>separate, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to inquire with regard to: <b>An olive-bulk, an olive-bulk?</b>

### Part 3
§ <b>It was stated:</b> If one had intent to eat <b>half an olive-</b>bulk <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, half an olive-</b>bulk <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area, and</b> another <b>half an olive-</b>bulk <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time, Rava says:</b> In such a case, <b>the <i>piggul</i></b>: <b>“Awaked as one asleep”</b> (Psalms 78:65), i.e., since one had intent to consume two halves of an olive-bulk beyond their designated time, these intentions are joined together. The middle thought is disregarded, since it constitutes only half the requisite measure, and the offering is rendered <i>piggul</i>. <b>And Rav Hamnuna says: It constitutes a combination of</b> improper <b>intentions.</b> The middle thought, although itself insufficient to disqualify the offering, is sufficient to interfere with the intention to consume it beyond its time, and the offering is not rendered <i>piggul</i>.

### Part 4
<b>Rava said: From where,</b> i.e., based on what, <b>do I state</b> my ruling? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 1:5): <b>An egg-bulk of food</b> with <b>first-</b>degree impurity <b>and an egg-bulk of food</b> with second-degree impurity <b>that one mixed together</b> are collectively considered to have <b>first-</b>degree impurity. If one <b>separated them</b> into two portions, each containing a homogenous mixture, <b>this</b> portion is considered to have <b>second-</b>degree impurity <b>and that</b> portion is considered to have <b>second-</b>degree impurity. Since neither of them contains the requisite amount of food with first-degree impurity, each mixture settles to the lower level of impurity between the two foods. Rava reasoned: <b>But</b> if one <b>mixed them again,</b> they revert to <b>be</b> of <b>first-</b>degree impurity.

### Part 5
<b>From where</b> do I know this? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of that mishna <b>teaches:</b> If <b>this</b> portion <b>fell by itself and that</b> portion fell <b>by itself onto a loaf of <i>teruma</i>, it disqualifies it,</b> as would any food with second-degree impurity. But it does not render it impure, since only foods with first-degree impurity impart impurity to other foods. But if <b>they both fell simultaneously</b> onto the loaf, <b>they render it</b> a food with <b>second</b>-degree impurity. Evidently, although the first-degree impurity lay dormant for lack of a requisite measure, it resurfaces when the rest of the measure is added, despite the fact that each portion was previously considered to have second-degree impurity. The <i>halakha</i> would be the same in the case of intent to consume the offering beyond its designated time, i.e., the intent to consume half an olive-bulk outside its area does not interfere with the intent of <i>piggul</i>.

### Part 6
<b>And Rav Hamnuna says:</b> The cases are different. <b>There,</b> in the case of ritual impurity, <b>there is</b> a requisite <b>measure</b> present at the outset, which is divided and then recombined. <b>Here,</b> in the case of the offering, <b>there is no</b> requisite <b>measure</b> present at the outset to render it <i>piggul</i>.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Hamnuna said: From where do I say</b> my opinion? <b>As we learned</b> in another mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 17b): <b>The food that became ritually impure</b> through contact <b>with a primary source of ritual impurity,</b> thereby assuming first-degree impurity, <b>and</b> the food <b>that became ritually impure</b> through contact <b>with a derivative source of ritual impurity,</b> thereby assuming second-degree impurity, <b>join together</b> to constitute the requisite measure of an egg-bulk <b>to impart impurity in accordance with the</b> more <b>lenient of the two,</b> i.e., as a food of second-degree impurity. <b>What, is it not</b> that they retain second-degree impurity <b>even if one makes up</b> the requisite measure <b>again?</b> If so, it can be inferred that the first-degree impurity is lost, and it does not lie dormant or resurface. Here as well, the latter intent of <i>piggul</i> cannot restore the initial intent of <i>piggul</i>, as the intent to consume half an olive-bulk outside its area interfered.

### Part 8
The Gemara responds: <b>Perhaps</b> the mishna is referring specifically to a case <b>where one does not complete</b> the requisite measure <b>again.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara presents similar cases: <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, <b>he said:</b> If one had intent to eat <b>half an olive-bulk outside its</b> designated <b>area, and half an olive-bulk beyond its</b> designated <b>time, and</b> then another <b>half an olive-bulk beyond its</b> designated <b>time, bar Kappara teaches</b> that the offering is rendered <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> since the <b>half an olive-bulk</b> with regard to the area <b>is not effective</b> to interfere <b>where</b> the intent with regard to the time concerns a whole <b>olive-bulk.</b>

### Part 10
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, <b>he stated</b> a different formulation: If one had intent to eat <b>half an olive-bulk beyond its</b> designated <b>time, and</b> then another <b>half an olive-bulk beyond its</b> designated <b>time, and</b> then <b>half an olive-bulk outside its</b> designated <b>area, bar Kappara teaches</b> that the offering is rendered <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> since the <b>half an olive-bulk is not effective</b> to interfere <b>where</b> the intent of <i>piggul</i> concerns a whole <b>olive-bulk.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ashi teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>in this</b> manner: If one had intent to eat <b>half an olive-bulk beyond its</b> designated <b>time, and</b> then intended with regard to a whole <b>olive-bulk</b> to eat <b>half of it outside its</b> designated <b>area and half of it beyond its</b> designated <b>time, bar Kappara teaches</b> that the offering is rendered <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> because the <b>half an olive-bulk is not effective</b> to interfere <b>where</b> the intent of <i>piggul</i> concerns a whole <b>olive-bulk.</b>

### Part 12
§ <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> If one <b>had intent that dogs would eat</b> the offering <b>the next day,</b> it is rendered <b><i>piggul</i>, as it is written: “And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel”</b> (II Kings 9:10). The verse indicates that consumption by dogs is considered eating.

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Ami objects to this: If that is so,</b> then if one <b>had intent that</b> non-sacred <b>fire would consume it the next day, as it is written: “A fire not blown shall consume him”</b> (Job 20:26), <b>this too</b> should be <b><i>piggul</i>. And if you would say</b> that this is <b>indeed</b> so, that is difficult: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: If his intent was <b>to eat half an olive-bulk and to burn half an olive-bulk</b> not at the appropriate time or in the appropriate area, the offering is <b>fit because eating and burning do not join together?</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara responds: <b>If one expressed</b> his intention to burn the offering <b>in terms of consumption,</b> it would <b>indeed</b> join together with intention to eat. But in the mishna <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where he expressed it in terms of burning.</b> The two intentions do not join together <b>since terms of consumption and terms of burning are discrete</b> entities.

### Part 15
§ <b>Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>one had intent that two people</b> would collectively <b>eat an olive-bulk, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we follow</b> the <b>intent,</b> in <b>which</b> case <b>there is</b> the requisite <b>measure</b> of an olive-bulk? <b>Or do we follow those who eat, and neither</b> eats the requisite <b>measure?</b>

### Part 16
<b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: If his intent was <b>to eat half an olive-bulk and to burn half an olive-bulk</b> beyond the designated time or outside the designated area, the offering is <b>fit because eating and burning do not join together.</b>
