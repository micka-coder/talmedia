<b>and it was good in his eyes”</b> (Leviticus 10:20). <b>Moses was not embarrassed</b> and did not attempt to justify himself <b>by saying: I did not hear</b> this <i>halakha</i> until now. <b>Rather,</b> he said: <b>I heard</b> it, <b>and I forgot</b> it.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: According to this opinion, why was the sin offering burned? <b>They should have delayed its</b> consumption <b>and consumed</b> it that <b>night.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Ritual impurity came</b> upon this sin offering <b>due to circumstances beyond</b> the priests’ <b>control,</b> and they were forced to burn it.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the Rabbis,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, <b>this is as it is written:</b> “And if I had consumed the sin offering <b>today,</b> would it have been good in the eyes of the Lord”? The verse indicates that Aaron could have eaten it at night. <b>But according to Rabbi Neḥemya,</b> who holds that Aaron distinguished between the offerings of that particular time and the offerings of all later generations, <b>what</b> did Aaron mean by the word <b>“today”?</b> The Gemara answers: He meant: And if I had eaten the sin offering of the New Moon, which is <b>today’s obligation,</b> would it have been good in the eyes of the Lord?

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Neḥemya, this is as it is written: “Behold, today</b> have they sacrificed their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord,” i.e., they offered it as the obligation of the day. <b>But according to the Rabbis,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, <b>what</b> did Aaron mean by the phrase “<b>behold [<i>hen</i>], today”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what Aaron <b>is saying: Did they [<i>hen</i>],</b> my sons, <b>sacrifice</b> the offering today, which would have been prohibited to them in acute mourning? No, <b>I sacrificed</b> the offering, and as High Priest, I may perform the service in acute mourning.

### Part 5
§ The Gemara continues to analyze the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master says:</b> If the sin offering was burned due to acute mourning, then the priests <b>should have burned</b> all <b>three of</b> the sin offerings offered that day. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by: All <b>three of</b> the sin offerings?

### Part 6
The Gemara responds: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And Moses diligently inquired for the goat of the sin offering,</b> and behold, it was burned” (Leviticus 10:16). When the verse states: “The <b>goat,” this</b> is referring to <b>the goat of Nahshon,</b> son of Amminadav, the prince of the tribe of Judah, who brought the offering on the first day of the Tabernacle’s inauguration (see Numbers 7:12). When the verse states: “The <b>sin offering,” this</b> is referring to the <b>sin offering</b> that the people brought on the <b>eighth</b> day of the inauguration (see Leviticus 9:13). The term <b>“inquired”</b> is referring to the <b>goat</b> sacrificed at every <b>New Moon</b> (see Numbers 28:15). The Tabernacle was erected on the New Moon of Nisan (see Exodus 40:17). These are the three goats that were sacrificed that day.

### Part 7
One <b>might</b> have thought that all <b>three of them were burned.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And Moses diligently inquired for the goat of the sin offering, <b>and, behold, it was burned,”</b> to teach that <b>one</b> of the offerings <b>was burned, but not</b> all <b>three of them were burned.</b> The verse states: “And Moses <b>diligently inquired [<i>darosh darash</i>].” Why</b> were there <b>two inquiries?</b> Moses <b>said to them: For what</b> reason is <b>this sin offering burned, and</b> secondly, for what reason are <b>those left</b> unburned? The <i>baraita</i> comments: Still, <b>I do not know which of them</b> was burned. <b>When it states</b> with regard to the burned goat: <b>“And He has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation”</b> (Leviticus 10:17), <b>you must say: This is the goat of the New Moon,</b> which atones for impurity in the Temple.

### Part 8
The Gemara comments: Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon <b>say well to</b> Rabbi Neḥemya; if the sin offering was burned due to acute mourning, then all three goats should have been burned. How would Rabbi Neḥemya respond? The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Neḥemya</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as he says: Acute mourning does not disqualify offerings of</b> a particular <b>time.</b> Therefore, they burned only the New Moon sin offering, which applies to future generations as well.

### Part 9
<b>The Master says</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: If the sin offering was burned due to acute mourning, why was it burned at all? <b>He should have eaten it in the evening.</b> The Gemara comments: Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon <b>say well to</b> Rabbi Neḥemya in posing this difficulty. How would he respond? The Gemara explains: He <b>holds</b> that <b>acute mourning in the evening</b> is <b>by Torah law,</b> and therefore the priests were not permitted to eat it even then.

### Part 10
Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon also stated: <b>Alternatively, wasn’t Pinehas,</b> son of Elazar the priest, <b>with them?</b> He was not an acute mourner. The Gemara comments: Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon <b>say well to</b> Rabbi Neḥemya. The Gemara explains: <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar. As Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: Pinehas did not become a priest until he killed Zimri,</b> who had engaged in intercourse with a Midianite woman (see Numbers 25:6–8). <b>As it is written</b> only after that incident concerning Pinehas: <b>“And it shall be unto him and to his seed after him the covenant of an everlasting priesthood”</b> (Numbers 25:13). Before that incident, at the time of the inauguration of the Tabernacle, the only priests were Aaron and his sons.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> Pinehas did not become a priest <b>until he made peace among the tribes</b> at the time of the conquest of Eretz Yisrael, when the tribes east of the Jordan River built their own altar and nearly provoked a civil war. Before this, Pinehas was always referred to as: Son of Elazar the priest, but during this incident he is himself referred to as a priest for the first time, <b>as it is stated: “And Pinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, and the heads of the thousands of Israel</b> that were with him, <b>heard</b> the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, and it pleased them well” (Joshua 22:30).

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> for <b>the other</b> Sage, Rav Ashi, <b>as well, isn’t it written: “And it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him,</b> the covenant of an everlasting priesthood”? Apparently, Pinehas became a priest after he killed Zimri. The Gemara responds: <b>When that</b> verse <b>is written,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the <b>blessing that it is written,</b> that his descendants would always be priests. It did not indicate that Pinehas became a priest immediately.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> for <b>the other</b> Sages <b>as well,</b> who hold that Pinehas became a priest immediately after he killed Zimri, <b>isn’t it written: “And Pinehas the priest…heard”?</b> Apparently he became a priest only after the conquest of Eretz Yisrael. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse serves <b>to entitle his descendants after him,</b> that they would continue as High Priests through his merit.

### Part 14
§ <b>Rav says: Moses, our teacher,</b> was <b>a High Priest and would receive a share of offerings</b> consecrated <b>to Heaven, as it is stated:</b> “And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the Lord; <b>it was Moses’ portion of the ram of inauguration,</b> as the Lord commanded Moses” (Leviticus 8:29).

### Part 15
The Gemara <b>raises an objection:</b> In the <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon claim that acute mourning was not the reason the sin offering was burned by asking: <b>Wasn’t Pinehas with them? And if it is so</b> that Moses could partake of sacrificial meat, <b>let them say: Wasn’t Moses, our teacher, with them?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Perhaps Moses is different, since</b> as a prophet, <b>he was preoccupied with the Divine Presence,</b> and was not available. <b>As the Master says: Moses ascended</b> Mount Sinai <b>early in the morning, and</b> he <b>descended early in the morning.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav’s statement from another <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a blemished priest: <b>“He may eat the bread of his God, both of the most sacred, and of the sacred”</b> (Leviticus 21:22). <b>If offerings of the most sacred order are stated,</b> that a blemished priest may eat them, then <b>why</b> are <b>offerings of lesser sanctity</b> also <b>stated? And if offerings of lesser sanctity are stated, why</b> are <b>offerings of the most sacred order stated?</b>

### Part 17
The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>Had offerings of lesser sanctity not been stated, I would have said: It is</b> only <b>offerings of the most sacred order that</b> a blemished priest <b>may eat, as they were permitted</b> both <b>to a non-priest and to</b> the priests, but a blemished priest <b>may not eat offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> which were not permitted to non-priests. <b>And had offerings of the most sacred order not been stated, I would have said:</b> A blemished priest <b>may eat offerings of lesser sanctity, as they are of lesser sanctity,</b> but <b>he may not eat of offerings of the most sacred order,</b> as they are of higher sanctity. <b>Therefore, offerings of the most sacred order are stated, and therefore, offerings of lesser sanctity</b> are <b>stated.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara explains the objection: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: As they were permitted</b> both <b>to a non-priest and to</b> the priests. What non-priest is permitted to eat offerings of the most sacred order? Is this <b>not</b> referring to <b>Moses?</b> This indicates that Moses was not considered a High Priest, contrary to Rav’s statement. <b>Rav Sheshet said: No,</b> this is referring <b>to a non-priest</b> sacrificing <b>on</b> a private <b>altar.</b> Once the Jewish people entered Eretz Yisrael, it was permitted for a time for them to build private altars, on which even non-priests could serve. <b>And</b> although only offerings of lesser sanctity were offered on private altars, this <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with the statement of the</b> Sage who <b>says: There is a meal offering</b> that may be offered <b>on</b> a private <b>altar.</b> Meal offerings are of the most sacred order.

### Part 19
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav’s statement: When <b>Miriam</b> became a leper (see Numbers 12:10), <b>who</b> diagnosed and <b>quarantined her? If you say</b> that <b>Moses quarantined her,</b> that is difficult, as <b>Moses</b> was <b>a non-priest,</b>
