<b>and</b> the offering is therefore <b>disqualified.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of them,</b> in a case <b>where they collected</b> the blood with the intent to offer it beyond its designated time or outside its designated area, if there is blood of the soul that remains in the animal, the priest fit for Temple service should again collect the blood and sprinkle it on the altar. <b>Reish Lakish asked Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If an individual <b>unfit</b> for Temple service presented the blood, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the blood that remains in the animal? Does the fact <b>that he</b> presented some blood <b>render</b> the rest of it <b>a remainder</b> and no longer fit to be presented, or perhaps the presenting performed by an unfit individual is not considered valid, and therefore a priest fit for Temple service may present the blood again?

### Part 3
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> A not valid presenting <b>does not render</b> the rest of the blood <b>a remainder unless</b> it is a case where a priest fit for Temple service presented the blood with the intent to offer it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time or outside its</b> designated <b>area, since</b> it is only in that case that the presenting of the blood <b>effects acceptance,</b> i.e., it is considered a valid presenting, <b>with regard to</b> rendering the offering <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> i.e., an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its designated time.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Zevid teaches</b> the matter in <b>this</b> way: <b>Reish Lakish asked Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> Concerning <b>a cup</b> of <b>disqualified</b> blood, e.g., one which had been taken out of the Temple courtyard and was then nevertheless presented on the altar, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to it <b>rendering</b> the remaining blood <b>a remainder</b> and unfit to be presented? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> In the case of <b>an unfit</b> individual who <b>himself</b> presented the blood, <b>what do you hold</b> to be the <i>halakha</i>? <b>If an unfit</b> individual who presented the blood <b>renders</b> the remaining blood <b>a remainder,</b> then <b>a cup</b> of <b>disqualified</b> blood should <b>also render</b> the remaining blood <b>a remainder. If an unfit</b> individual does <b>not render</b> the remaining blood <b>a remainder,</b> then <b>a cup</b> of <b>disqualified</b> blood should <b>also not render</b> the remaining blood <b>a remainder.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yirmeya of Difti teaches</b> the discussion <b>this</b> way: <b>Abaye asked Rabba:</b> If the blood was collected in more than one cup and the presenting of the blood on the corners of the altar was performed with one <b>cup, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the cup <b>render</b> the blood of <b>the other</b> cup <b>rejected,</b> and it is therefore poured into the drain running through the Temple courtyard, <b>or</b> does it render it <b>a remainder,</b> which is poured on the base of the altar?

### Part 6
Rabba <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>a dispute between Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, and the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the remainder of the blood of the external sin offering: In the verse <b>above,</b> discussing the sin offering of a <i>Nasi</i>, <b>it states:</b> “And <b>he shall pour its blood</b> out at the base of the altar of the burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:25). In the verse <b>below,</b> discussing the sin offering of an individual, <b>it states: “And he shall pour all its blood</b> out at the base of the altar” (Leviticus 4:30).

### Part 7
The discrepancy between the first verse and the second verse, which contains the additional term “all,” is explained as follows: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a sin offering which</b> the priest <b>collected its blood in four cups and placed one placement</b> of blood onto the altar <b>from this</b> cup, <b>and one placement</b> of blood <b>from that</b> cup, and likewise for all four corners of the altar, <b>that</b> the remainder of blood from <b>all</b> the cups <b>are poured</b> out <b>onto the base</b> of the altar? <b>The verse states: “And he shall pour all its blood.”</b>

### Part 8
One <b>might</b> have thought that if <b>he placed four placements</b> of blood of the sin offering <b>from one cup,</b> the blood in <b>all</b> the rest of the cups <b>should be poured onto the base</b> of the altar. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And</b> he shall pour <b>its blood,”</b> and not all of its blood. <b>How so?</b> Only <b>that</b> blood in the cup from which blood was properly presented on the altar <b>is poured onto the base</b> of the altar, <b>and</b> the rest of the cups of blood are rejected and <b>are poured into the</b> Temple courtyard <b>drain.</b>

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a sin offering which</b> the priest <b>collected its blood in four cups and</b> then <b>placed four placements from one cup, that</b> the blood from <b>all</b> the cups <b>are poured</b> out <b>onto the base</b> of the altar? <b>The verse states: “And he shall pour all its blood.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And he shall pour its blood,”</b> which indicates that not all of the blood is poured? <b>Rav Ashi said: That</b> verse serves <b>to exclude</b> the <b>remainder that is in the throat of</b> the <b>animal</b> that was never collected in a vessel to be presented, which is not poured onto the base of the altar but into the Temple courtyard drain.

### Part 10
§ The mishna discussed three similar cases: If <b>the</b> priest <b>fit</b> for Temple service <b>collected</b> the blood in a vessel <b>and gave</b> the vessel <b>to an unfit</b> person, that person should return it to the fit priest. If the priest collected the blood in a vessel in his right hand and moved it to his left hand, he should return it to his right hand. If the priest collected the blood in a sacred vessel and placed it in a non-sacred vessel, he should return the blood to a sacred vessel.

### Part 11
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it was <b>necessary</b> to mention all of these cases, <b>as had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only the case where he gave the blood to <b>an unfit</b> individual, <b>I would say: What</b> does the term: <b>Unfit,</b> mean? It means <b>an impure</b> priest, who is not completely unfit, <b>as</b> he <b>is fit for communal service</b> in the Temple when the priests or the entire community are impure, and that is why the blood is not disqualified; <b>but</b> if the priest moved the blood to his <b>left</b> hand, which under no circumstances may be used to perform the rite of collecting and carrying the blood, it is <b>no</b> longer valid.

### Part 12
<b>And had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only with regard to moving the blood to his <b>left</b> hand that he should return it to his right hand and present it, one would assume that the reason is <b>that</b> the left hand <b>has validity on Yom Kippur,</b> since the High Priest carries the spoon of incense with his left hand, <b>but</b> if he poured the blood into <b>a non-sacred vessel</b> then it is <b>not</b> valid.

### Part 13
<b>And had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only with regard to <b>a non-sacred vessel</b> that the blood is not disqualified, one could suggest that perhaps it is <b>because</b> the vessels <b>are suitable to be consecrated, but</b> with regard to <b>these,</b> i.e., an unfit individual and the left hand, which have no possibility of becoming fit for service, <b>say</b> that the blood does <b>not</b> remain valid. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for all of the cases to be mentioned.

### Part 14
§ The Gemara questions the actual <i>halakha</i>: <b>But let</b> the blood <b>be</b> considered <b>rejected</b> when placed in the hand of the unfit individual, the left hand, or the non-sacred vessel. <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: This is</b> what <b>Rav Yirmeya of Difti says in the name of Rava:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Ḥanan the Egyptian, who does not</b> subscribe to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>rejection,</b> but holds that a sacrifice that was rejected temporarily is not rejected entirely.

### Part 15
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ḥanan the Egyptian says:</b> In the event that the scapegoat of Yom Kippur was lost, <b>even</b> if the <b>blood</b> of its partner that is sacrificed to God has already been collected <b>in the cup,</b> the blood is not rejected, but rather <b>he brings</b> another scapegoat as <b>its counterpart, and pairs it with</b> the goat that has already been slaughtered, and the blood is sprinkled.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Ashi says</b> that there is another explanation to the mishna: <b>Anything that is in his power</b> to rectify <b>is not</b> considered <b>rejected,</b> as in these cases where he can simply return the blood to its proper place.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Shaya said:</b> It <b>is reasonable</b> to explain the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ashi,</b> as <b>whom have you heard who accepts</b> the reasoning of <b>rejection?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 62a): <b>And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> If <b>the blood</b> of the goat sacrificed to God <b>spilled</b> from the cup before it was sprinkled, <b>the scapegoat</b> is left to <b>die.</b> Similarly, if <b>the scapegoat died, the blood</b> of the goat sacrificed to God <b>should be spilled,</b> and two other goats are used. Consequently, Rabbi Yehuda holds that the scapegoat, or in the opposite case, the blood of the goat to be sacrificed to God, is totally rejected.

### Part 18
<b>And</b> yet, <b>we have heard that</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>says: Anything that is in his power</b> to rectify <b>is not rejected. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> A priest <b>would fill one cup with blood of the</b> many Paschal offerings brought that day that was now <b>mixed</b> together on the floor <b>and</b> then <b>sprinkle it</b> with <b>a single sprinkling against the base</b> of the altar. <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Yehuda holds that although the blood originally spilled from the cup, <b>anything that is in his power</b> to rectify <b>is not rejected.</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that it is so.

### Part 19
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> A priest <b>would fill one cup with the mixed blood,</b> so <b>that if one of</b> the cups with the collected blood of one of the Paschal offerings <b>were to spill,</b> it would be <b>found that this</b> cup of the mixed blood that was sprinkled <b>would render</b> the sacrifice <b>valid.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Yehuda: But</b> the mixed blood <b>was not collected in a vessel.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do</b> the Rabbis <b>know</b> that the blood was not collected in a vessel? Perhaps it was collected and it spilled out. <b>Rather,</b> this is what they are saying: <b>Perhaps it was not collected in a vessel.</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to them:</b>
