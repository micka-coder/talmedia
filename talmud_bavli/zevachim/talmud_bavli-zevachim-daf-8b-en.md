### Part 1
<b>From where do we</b> derive these <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <b>a sin offering</b> brought <b>for idol worship,</b> which has unique <i>halakhot</i>, as detailed in Numbers 15:27–31, and with regard to which the term: For a sin offering, is not written? Likewise, from where do we derive them with regard to the sin offerings that are brought <b>for</b> the <b>hearing</b> of <b>the voice, and</b> for <b>an utterance of the lips, and</b> for the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, which also have unique <i>halakhot</i> (Leviticus 5:1–13), and <b>with regard to which</b> the term: For a sin offering, <b>is not written</b> either?

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: With regard to <b>a sin offering</b> brought <b>for idol worship,</b> these <i>halakhot</i> are <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a sin offering</b> brought for eating forbidden <b>fat, as</b> idol worship is also punishable by <b><i>karet</i>, similar to</b> consumption of forbidden fat. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all these</b> other sin offerings, which are brought for transgressions not punishable by <i>karet</i>, these <i>halakhot</i> <b>are derived by</b> analogy from <b>the common element</b> of the aforementioned three sources, namely, a standard sin offering, the sin offering of a nazirite, and the sin offering of a leper.

### Part 3
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> When <b>a Paschal offering</b> is sacrificed <b>at its</b> appointed <b>time,</b> on Passover eve after noon, if it is sacrificed <b>for its sake,</b> it is <b>fit;</b> if it is sacrificed <b>not for its sake,</b> it is <b>unfit,</b> as stated in the mishna. <b>And</b> when an offering consecrated as a Paschal offering is sacrificed <b>during the rest of the days of the year,</b> if it is sacrificed <b>for its sake,</b> it is <b>unfit;</b> if it is sacrificed <b>not for its sake,</b> it is <b>fit.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for the names of the <i>amora’im</i> mentioned in this discussion: <b><i>Shin</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>vav</i>; <i>kuf</i>, <i>beit</i>, <i>alef</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>tzadi</i>, <i>nun</i>; <i>mem</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>reish</i>; <i>beit</i>, <i>tzadi</i>, <i>alef</i>; <i>beit</i>, <i>alef</i>.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, i.e., that if a Paschal offering is sacrificed during the rest of the year it is fit if sacrificed not for its sake? <b>Shmuel’s father says: The verse states: “And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord is of the flock”</b> (Leviticus 3:6), indicating that an offering <b>that is brought</b> only <b>from the flock will be a sacrifice of peace offerings.</b> The Paschal offering fulfills this criterion.

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges: <b>Say</b> that if it is sacrificed for the sake of <b>a peace offering, yes,</b> it is fit, but if it is sacrificed for the sake of <b>some other</b> offering, it is <b>not</b> fit. <b>Rabbi Ila says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The redundant expression <b>“for a sacrifice”</b> in Leviticus 3:6 is stated <b>to include any</b> type of <b>sacrifice.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>say</b> that a Paschal offering <b>should be</b> rendered <b>as any</b> offering for <b>which</b> one <b>slaughters</b> it; for example, if it is slaughtered for the sake of a burnt offering, it should be rendered a burnt offering.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the phrase: <b>For peace offerings and a sacrifice, was written</b> in the verse, it would be <b>as you say. Now that it is written: “For a sacrifice of peace offerings,”</b> it indicates that <b>for whatever</b> type of offering one <b>slaughters it, it will be a peace offering.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara challenges: <b>Say</b> that: <b>“For a sacrifice,”</b> is <b>a generalization</b> and: <b>“Of peace offerings,”</b> is <b>a detail,</b> and according to the principles of biblical hermeneutics, wherever there is <b>a generalization and a detail, the generalization includes only that which is</b> specified <b>in the detail.</b> Accordingly, if the offering is sacrificed for the sake of <b>a peace offering, yes,</b> it is fit; but if it is sacrificed for the sake of <b>another</b> offering, it is <b>not</b> fit.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: With the term: <b>“Unto the Lord,”</b> the verse <b>then generalized</b> again. Therefore, the verse is formulated as a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, as the Gemara will explain.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ya’akov of Nehar Pekod objects to this</b> suggestion: <b>But the latter generalization is dissimilar to the former generalization. The former generalization:</b> “For a sacrifice,” <b>includes</b> only <b>slaughtered offerings and nothing more,</b> whereas <b>the latter generalization: “Unto the Lord,”</b> includes <b>any</b> offering <b>unto the Lord. And</b> accordingly, <b>even</b> if the Paschal offering was sacrificed <b>for</b> the sake of <b>bird</b> offerings, <b>or even for</b> the sake of <b>meal offerings,</b> it should be fit, as these are brought “unto the Lord.”

### Part 12
The Gemara responds to this objection: <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught generalizations and details</b> even in examples <b>like this case.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara explains: Since “unto the Lord” is a second generalization, the verse is formulated as <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> and <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail. Just as</b> the items mentioned in <b>the detail</b> are clearly <b>defined as</b> a case where a Paschal offering was sacrificed <b>not for its own sake, and</b> nevertheless it is <b>fit, so too,</b> in <b>any</b> case <b>where it</b> was sacrificed <b>not for its sake but</b> for the sake of another offering, it is <b>fit.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the verse is referring only to actions similar to the detail, then <b>just as</b> the items mentioned in <b>the detail</b> are clearly <b>defined</b> as a peace offering, which is <b>a matter that is brought as a vow</b> offering <b>or as a gift</b> offering, <b>so too,</b> a Paschal offering should be fit only if it was sacrificed for the sake of <b>any</b> offering <b>that is brought as a vow</b> offering <b>or as a gift</b> offering. Accordingly, if it was sacrificed for the sake of <b>a burnt offering or a peace offering, yes,</b> it is fit, as these are brought as a vow offering or as a gift offering; but if it was sacrificed for the sake of <b>a sin offering or a guilt offering,</b> it is <b>not</b> fit, as these are not brought as a vow offering or as a gift offering.

### Part 15
The Gemara therefore rejects the exegetical method of generalizations and details in favor of that of amplifications and restrictions: <b>Rather,</b> the term: <b>“For a sacrifice,” is</b> not a generalization, but <b>an amplification,</b> which includes any type of offering. Therefore, if a Paschal offering is sacrificed for the sake of any type of offering during the rest of the year, it is fit.

### Part 16
The Gemara challenges: If so, <b>say</b> that it adds that a Paschal offering <b>should be</b> rendered <b>as any</b> offering for <b>which</b> one <b>slaughters</b> it. Why does Shmuel’s father interpret that it is rendered a peace offering specifically?
