### Part 1
<b>I return</b> to my previous claim that a sin offering is unique since its blood is sprinkled above the red line. The discussion is going <b>around [<i>ḥalila</i>]</b> in circles.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Eliezer then presented a different logical inference: With regard to a sin offering,</b> the word <b>“it” is stated concerning slaughter,</b> in the verse: “And slaughter it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the Lord; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). The word “it” teaches that if <b>it</b> is sacrificed <b>for its sake</b> it is <b>fit;</b> if it is sacrificed <b>not for its sake</b> it is <b>unfit. And</b> similarly, <b>with regard to a Paschal offering,</b> the word <b>“it” is stated concerning slaughter [<i>zeviḥa</i>],</b> in the verse: “It is the sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>] of the Lord’s Passover” (Exodus 12:27). Here, the word “it” teaches that if <b>it</b> is sacrificed <b>for its sake</b> it is <b>fit;</b> if it is sacrificed <b>not for its sake</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>

### Part 3
And the word <b>“it” is stated with regard to a guilt offering as well,</b> in the verse: “It is a guilt offering” (Leviticus 7:5). Here too, say that the word “it” teaches that if <b>it</b> is sacrificed <b>for its sake</b> it is <b>fit;</b> if it is sacrificed <b>not for its sake</b> it is <b>unfit.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: With regard to a sin offering,</b> the word <b>“it” is stated concerning slaughter,</b> teaching that if <b>it</b> is sacrificed <b>for its sake</b> it is <b>fit,</b> but if it is sacrificed <b>not for its sake</b> it is <b>unfit. With regard to a Paschal offering</b> too, the word <b>“it” is stated concerning slaughter,</b> likewise teaching that if <b>it</b> is sacrificed <b>for its sake</b> it is <b>fit,</b> but if it is sacrificed <b>not for its sake</b> it is <b>unfit. But with regard to a guilt offering,</b> the word <b>“it” is stated only after the burning of</b> the <b>sacrificial portions. And</b> since the offering <b>itself is fit</b> even if the <b>sacrificial portions were not burned</b> at all, it is certainly fit if they were burned not for the sake of a guilt offering.

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him:</b> A sin offering and a guilt offering are juxtaposed in the verse that <b>states: “As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:7). The verse teaches that <b>just as a sin offering</b> sacrificed <b>not for its sake</b> is <b>unfit, so too, a guilt offering</b> sacrificed <b>not for its sake</b> is <b>unfit.</b>

### Part 6
§ The Gemara discusses the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said: Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: I return</b> to my previous claim, that a sin offering is unique since its blood is sprinkled above the red line. The discussion is going <b>around</b> in circles. The Gemara asks: <b>And let the derivation revert</b> to its starting point, <b>and let</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>derive</b> the point <b>by</b> analogy from <b>the common element</b> of the two sources, a sin offering and a Paschal offering. Together they can prove that a guilt offering sacrificed not for its sake is also unfit, since they share no element of stringency that the latter lacks.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: Even such a derivation is not valid, <b>as it can be refuted: What</b> is notable <b>about their common element?</b> A sin offering and a Paschal offering are notable <b>in that they</b> both <b>have an element of <i>karet</i>.</b> A sin offering is brought for a transgression punishable by <i>karet</i> when committed intentionally, and one who refrains intentionally from bringing a Paschal offering is liable to be punished with <i>karet</i>. A guilt offering, by contrast, has no element of <i>karet</i>.

### Part 8
§ The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him:</b> Your comparison of a guilt offering to a sin offering is <b>not</b> valid. <b>If you say</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a sin offering, whose blood is</b> sprinkled <b>above</b> the red line, should you necessarily say the same with regard to a guilt offering, whose blood is sprinkled below that line? The Gemara challenges: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>say to him</b> another refutation: Your comparison is <b>not</b> valid, as <b>if you say</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a sin offering, whose blood enters the innermost sanctum,</b> i.e., the Holy of Holies, on Yom Kippur, must the same be said for a guilt offering, whose blood never enters the innermost sanctum?

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>We are stating</b> a comparison of a guilt offering to a sin offering specifically <b>with regard to the external sin offerings,</b> whose blood does not enter the innermost sanctum.

### Part 10
The Gemara counters: If so, Rabbi Yehoshua could have refuted the comparison by pointing out another difference between a sin offering and a guilt offering, <b>as, if the blood of</b> an external sin offering <b>enters the innermost sanctum,</b> it is <b>disqualified.</b> This is not so in the case of the blood of a guilt offering.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that <b>a guilt offering</b> whose blood enters the innermost sanctum is <b>also</b> disqualified.

### Part 12
The Gemara counters: Rabbi Yehoshua could have pointed out another distinction, <b>as</b> a sin offering <b>atones for</b> transgressions for which one is <b>liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i></b> if he committed them intentionally.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Eliezer derives the <i>halakha</i> specifically <b>from a sin offering</b> brought <b>for hearing the voice,</b> i.e., for falsely taking an oath that one is unable to testify in another’s case. This transgression is not punishable by <i>karet</i>.

### Part 14
The Gemara counters: Rabbi Yehoshua could have pointed out another distinction, <b>that</b> the blood of a sin offering <b>requires four placements</b> on the altar, whereas the blood of a guilt offering requires only two.

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: Perhaps Rabbi Eliezer holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says</b> that <b>the blood</b> of almost <b>all</b> offerings <b>requires four placements.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara counters: Rabbi Yehoshua could have pointed out another distinction, <b>that</b> a sin offering’s blood <b>requires</b> placement <b>on</b> all <b>four corners</b> of the altar, whereas the blood of a guilt offering, even according to Rabbi Yishmael, is sprinkled on only two corners.

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> why didn’t Rabbi Yehoshua mention other distinctions between a sin offering and a guilt offering? <b>Isn’t there</b> the requirement that a priest place a sin offering’s blood on the altar with his <b>finger? Isn’t there</b> the requirement to place a sin offering’s blood on the <b>corner</b> of the altar? And even according to the opinion that it is not placed on the corner itself, <b>isn’t there</b> the requirement to place it on <b>the edge of</b> the corner? None of these requirements pertain to any offering other than a sin offering. <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>mentioned one of two</b> or <b>three</b> valid <b>claims</b> at his disposal.

### Part 18
§ <b>The Master says: Rabbi Yehoshua said to him:</b> Your comparison is <b>not</b> valid. <b>If you say</b> this with regard to a sin offering, whose blood is sprinkled above the red line, should you necessarily say the same with regard to a guilt offering, whose blood is sprinkled below that line? The Gemara challenges: <b>Let Rabbi Eliezer say to him: The blood of a guilt offering is also</b> sprinkled <b>above</b> the red line, since Rabbi Eliezer holds that the <i>halakhot</i> of a guilt offering and a sin offering are parallel.

### Part 19
<b>Abaye said: You cannot say</b> that <b>the blood of a guilt offering is</b> presented <b>above</b> the red line, due to <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of <b>a burnt offering: Just as</b> in the case of <b>a burnt offering, which is</b> treated stringently in that it is totally <b>consumed</b> on the altar, <b>its blood</b> is presented <b>below</b> the red line, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that in the case of <b>a guilt offering, which is not</b> totally <b>consumed</b> on the altar, its blood is presented below the red line?

### Part 20
The Gemara rejects the inference: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a burnt offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that it does not atone</b> for a sin, unlike a guilt offering. Perhaps this is why its blood is presented below the red line.

### Part 21
The Gemara answers: <b>A bird sin offering can prove</b> the point, as it atones for a sin, and still its blood is presented below the red line.

### Part 22
The Gemara rejects this as well: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a bird sin offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that it is not a type of offering</b> that is <b>slaughtered;</b> it is killed by pinching the nape of its neck. Perhaps this is why its blood is presented below the red line.

### Part 23
The Gemara answers: If so, <b>a burnt offering can prove</b> the point, since it is slaughtered, and its blood is still presented below the red line. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> is derived from a combination of the <i>halakhot</i> of a burnt offering and a bird sin offering: <b>The aspect of this</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> case <b>and the aspect of that</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> case. <b>Their common element is that they are offerings of the most sacred order, and their blood is</b> presented <b>below</b> the red line. <b>So too, I shall include a guilt offering</b> in this <i>halakha</i>, <b>as it is an offering of the most sacred order, and</b> therefore <b>its blood is</b> presented <b>below</b> the red line.

### Part 24
<b>Rava of Parzakya said to Rav Ashi: Let</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>refute</b> this inference: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about the common element of</b> the two cases? It is notable <b>in that neither</b> a burnt offering nor a bird sin offering <b>has a fixed</b> value. Need <b>you say</b> that the same <i>halakhot</i> apply <b>to a guilt offering, which has a fixed</b> value of two silver shekels (see Leviticus 5:15)?

### Part 25
<b>Rather, this is Rabbi Eliezer’s reason</b> for not claiming that the blood of a guilt offering is presented below the red line: <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to the presenting of the blood of a sin offering: <b>“The priest who offers it”</b> (Leviticus 6:19). The word “it” indicates that <b>its blood</b> is presented <b>above</b> the red line, <b>but the blood of another</b> slaughtered offering is <b>not</b> presented <b>above</b> the red line.

### Part 26
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if Rabbi Eliezer accepts that the word “it” indicates exclusivity, <b>let him also say</b> that the verse: “And slaughter <b>it</b> for a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:33), teaches that only <b>a sin offering is fit</b> if slaughtered <b>for its sake,</b> and <b>unfit</b> if slaughtered <b>not for its sake. Consequently, other slaughtered offerings, whether</b> slaughtered <b>for their sake or not for their sake, are fit.</b> Why then does Rabbi Eliezer deem a guilt offering unfit if slaughtered not for its sake?

### Part 27
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> instance of the word <b>“it”</b> does <b>not</b> indicate that the <i>halakha</i> applies <b>specifically</b> to a sin offering and to no other offerings, <b>as</b> the Torah <b>excludes</b> the <b>Paschal offering</b> from such a generalization. A Paschal offering is certainly disqualified if sacrificed not for its sake.

### Part 28
The Gemara counters: If so, <b>here too,</b> with regard to the presenting of the blood above the red line, one must say the word “it” does <b>not</b> indicate that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>specifically</b> to a sin offering and no other offerings, <b>as</b> the Torah <b>excludes a bird burnt offering</b> from such a generalization. The blood of a bird burnt offering is presented above the red line.

### Part 29
The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to</b> offerings that require <b>slaughter, in any event,</b> the Torah <b>excluded nothing</b> from the generalization. Bird offerings are irrelevant, as they are killed by the pinching of the nape.

### Part 30
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that even the blood of a bird burnt offering is presented in a manner different from that of a sin offering. In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> suggestion? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who says: This place</b> where the blood of a sin offering is presented is <b>discrete, and that place</b> where the blood of a bird burnt offering is presented is <b>discrete.</b>

### Part 31
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The blood</b> that must be placed on <b>the lower</b> half of the altar <b>is placed</b> anywhere <b>from the red [<i>hasikra</i>] line and below, and</b> the blood that must be placed on <b>the upper</b> half is placed anywhere <b>from the red line and above. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to a bird burnt offering. But</b> the placement of the blood of <b>an animal sin offering is itself performed only on the actual corner</b> of the altar.

### Part 32
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (81b): <b>As Rabbi Akiva would say: Any blood that</b> should have been sprinkled on the external altar but instead <b>entered to atone in the Sanctuary</b> is <b>unfit. And the Rabbis say:</b> That is the <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to the blood of <b>a sin offering. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The halakhic status of <b>a guilt offering</b> is <b>also</b> like that of a sin offering, <b>as it is stated: “As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 7:7).

### Part 33
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> is understandable, <b>as he states the reason</b> for his opinion. <b>But what is the reason</b> for the opinion of <b>the Rabbis?</b>

### Part 34
<b>Rava said: You cannot say</b> that <b>the blood of a guilt offering that entered into</b> the Sanctuary is <b>disqualified,</b> due to <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of <b>a burnt offering: Just as</b>
