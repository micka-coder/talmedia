### Part 1
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> according to the opinion that earthenware vessels can be cleansed of their absorbed substances by the process of kindling, with regard to <b>pots</b> used in <b>the Temple, why does the Merciful One state</b> in the Torah that <b>they should be broken? Let us</b> simply <b>return them to</b> the <b>kilns</b> in which pots are made to be sure that the pots will be cleansed by the extreme heat of the kilns. <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The pots cannot be returned to kilns <b>because,</b> as taught in a <i>baraita</i> (see <i>Bava Kamma</i> 82b), <b>kilns are not built in Jerusalem</b> because of the great quantity of smoke they produce.

### Part 2
The Gemara presents an objection to Rabbi Zeira’s answer. <b>Abaye said: But</b> if, as the <i>baraita</i> teaches, there are no kilns in Jerusalem, <b>are scrap heaps</b> of earthenware <b>assembled in the Temple courtyard?</b> The same <i>baraita</i> also teaches that there are no scrap heaps in Jerusalem. What, then, is done with the shards of earthenware vessels that must be broken in the courtyard? The Gemara dismisses the question: Abaye raised that objection only because <b>that which Shemaya taught in Kalnevo escaped him;</b> Shemaya taught there: In the Temple, <b>shards of earthenware vessels were</b> miraculously <b>absorbed in their place.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara returns to the topic of kindling earthenware vessels and asks: <b>But</b> if kindling from within cleanses everything absorbed in an earthenware oven, what is the reason for <b>that which Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: The oven in the Temple was</b> fashioned <b>of metal? Let us fashion</b> it <b>of earthenware, as</b> an oven’s <b>kindling is from the inside,</b> and, accordingly, it would be possible to cleanse it?

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: The reason the oven must be fashioned of metal is <b>because there are the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering on <i>Shavuot</i> of two loaves from the new wheat, <b>and the shewbread,</b> i.e., the bread baked each week in a special form and displayed for the duration of one whole week on the table in the Sanctuary, <b>whose baking is</b> done <b>in the oven, and</b> also <b>whose sanctification</b> occurs <b>in the oven.</b> Because these offerings are not kneaded in a service vessel, they are sanctified only by being placed in the oven, and therefore the oven <b>is a service vessel; and we do not make a service vessel of earthenware.</b>
