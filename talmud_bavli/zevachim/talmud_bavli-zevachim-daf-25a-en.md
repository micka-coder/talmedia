### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Shimon, who does not require sanctification of</b> the <b>handful, or according to the one who says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon also requires</b> the <b>sanctification of</b> the <b>handful</b> but that <b>he deems</b> the sanctification <b>fit</b> when performed <b>with</b> the <b>left</b> hand, <b>why do I</b> need the verbal analogy <b>of Rava</b> between <b>“hand”</b> and <b>“hand”?</b>

### Part 2
<b>If</b> one suggests that it is necessary <b>to</b> indicate that the <b>removal of</b> the <b>handful itself</b> must be performed with the right hand, this cannot be, since that is <b>derived from</b> the verse cited by <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya. As Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: What is the reason that Rabbi Shimon</b> does not require that the handful be sanctified in a service vessel? <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to the meal offering: <b>“It is most holy, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:10).

### Part 3
The verse compares the meal offering to a sin offering and a guilt offering. Therefore, if the priest <b>comes to perform</b> the burning of the handful <b>with</b> his <b>hand,</b> then <b>he performs it with</b> his <b>right</b> hand, <b>like a sin offering,</b> whose blood is sprinkled by hand. And if he <b>comes to perform it with a vessel,</b> i.e., if he first sanctifies the handful in a service vessel, then <b>he</b> may <b>perform it with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>like a guilt offering,</b> whose blood is sprinkled from a vessel. Since the removal of the handful is performed by hand, the verse indicates that it must be performed with the right hand, and the verbal analogy is unnecessary.

### Part 4
The Gemara responds: The verbal analogy <b>is necessary only for the handful of a meal offering of a sinner,</b> to teach that it must be removed with the right hand. It might <b>enter your mind to say: Since Rabbi Shimon says</b> that this offering does not require oil and frankincense <b>so that his offering will not be of superior</b> quality, perhaps <b>when he removed the handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, which is an inferior manner, <b>it should be fit as well.</b> The verbal analogy therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the handful must always be removed with the right hand, even in the case of the meal offering of a sinner.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>the blood spilled on the floor</b> before the priest managed to collect it into a vessel, <b>and</b> the priest then <b>collected it</b> from the floor into a vessel, it is <b>disqualified.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And the anointed priest shall take from the blood of the bull [<i>middam happar</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 4:5). This means that the priest shall take <b>from the blood of the soul,</b> i.e., the blood that flows from the place of slaughter as the animal dies, <b>but not from the blood of the skin,</b> which bleeds out when the skin is cut before the slaughter, <b>nor from the blood of exudate,</b> i.e., that exudes from the neck of the animal after the initial spurt of its slaughter concludes.

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> continues: When the verse states: <b>“From the blood of the bull,”</b> it should be interpreted as if it is written: <b>He shall collect the blood from the bull,</b> i.e., if the blood spills onto the floor before it is collected in a service vessel, it is disqualified. <b>As, if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> that <b>“from the blood of the bull”</b> should be interpreted <b>as it is written,</b> i.e., that <b>“from the blood”</b> means that the priest may collect <b>even</b> only <b>a portion of the blood,</b> that is difficult: <b>But doesn’t Rav say: One who slaughters</b> the offering <b>must collect all the blood of</b> the <b>bull, as it is stated: “And all the blood of the bull he shall pour out</b> on the base of the altar” (Leviticus 4:7)? The verse emphasizes that the priest must pour all the blood of the bull, which is possible only if he has collected all of it.

### Part 8
<b>Rather, “from the blood of the bull”</b> means that the priest <b>shall collect</b> the <b>blood from the bull. And</b> this Sage <b>holds</b> that the Sages <b>subtract and add and interpret homiletically,</b> i.e., one may take a letter from one word, insert it into a second word, and explain the phrase in that manner. In this case, the <i>mem</i> of <i>middam</i> is added to <i>happar</i>, so that the verse is interpreted as though it states: <i>Dam mehappar</i>, meaning: Blood from the bull.

### Part 9
§ The Gemara turns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: One who slaughters</b> the offering <b>must collect all the blood of</b> the <b>bull, as it is stated: “And all the blood of the bull he shall pour out</b> on the base of the altar.” The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> this verse <b>written with regard to the remainder</b> of the blood that is poured onto the base of the altar after the sprinkling? How, then, can a <i>halakha</i> with regard to the collection of the blood be derived from it?

### Part 10
The Gemara responds: <b>If</b> this verse <b>is not</b> referring <b>to the matter of the remainder</b> of the blood after sprinkling, <b>as not all of the blood is</b> present for that rite since some of it has already been sprinkled, <b>apply it</b> instead to <b>the matter of collection</b> of the blood from the animal.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: One who slaughters</b> the offering <b>must hold the knife up</b> after slaughter, so that blood that is on the knife does not fall into the service vessel, <b>as it is stated: “And</b> the anointed priest <b>shall take from the blood of the bull,”</b> i.e., <b>and not from</b> a mixture of <b>the blood of the bull and something else,</b> such as the blood from the knife.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And with what does he wipe</b> the <b>blood</b> from the <b>knife? Abaye says:</b> He wipes it <b>with the rim of</b> the <b>bowl</b> used to collect the blood, <b>as it is written</b> of the bowls used to collect the blood: <b>“Atoning-bowls [<i>keforei</i>] of gold”</b> (Ezra 1:10). The root <i>kaf</i>, <i>peh</i>, <i>reish</i> can also mean to wipe.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says: One who slaughters</b> the offering <b>must place</b>
