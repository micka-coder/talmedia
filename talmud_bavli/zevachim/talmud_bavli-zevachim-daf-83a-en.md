<b>and</b> then <b>brought out</b> the blood <b>to the</b> golden <b>altar</b> in the Sanctuary and sprinkled the blood there, as required (see Leviticus 16:18), <b>but</b> subsequently <b>brought</b> the remainder of the blood <b>in</b> toward the Curtain dividing the Sanctuary from the Holy of Holies, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 2
Rava explains the sides of the dilemma: Do we say that <b>here</b> the area of the Curtain and the golden altar <b>is certainly one place,</b> as they are both in the Sanctuary, and therefore the blood should not be disqualified by being brought back toward the Curtain? <b>Or perhaps,</b> since <b>we call</b> the taking of the blood to the golden altar: <b>Going out,</b> in the verse: “And he shall go out unto the altar” (Leviticus 16:18), its return to the Curtain should be considered bringing in, and therefore the blood should be disqualified? No answers were found, and therefore the Gemara states that these dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches that the Sages disagree as to the <i>halakha</i> in a case where the priest carrying the blood of a sin offering whose blood placement is on the external altar <b>entered</b> the Sanctuary <b>to atone</b> through sprinkling, but in practice the priest did not actually sprinkle the blood. According to Rabbi Eliezer the blood is disqualified, whereas Rabbi Shimon maintains that the blood is disqualified only if the priest sprinkles it in the Sanctuary. Concerning this, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It is stated here:</b> “And any sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting <b>to atone in the Sanctuary,</b> shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:23), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the service of the High Priest on Yom Kippur: <b>“And there shall be no man in the Tent of Meeting when he goes in to atone in the Sanctuary,</b> until he comes out” (Leviticus 16:17).

### Part 4
Rabbi Eliezer explains: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to Yom Kippur, the phrase “when he goes in to atone” is referring <b>to</b> the stage <b>when</b> he <b>has not</b> yet <b>atoned, so too here,</b> with regard to the disqualification of blood brought inside the Sanctuary, the phrase “to atone in the Sanctuary” is referring <b>to</b> a situation where the blood enters the Sanctuary at a time <b>when</b> the priest <b>has not</b> yet <b>atoned.</b>

### Part 5
Conversely, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: It is stated here: “To atone”</b> (Leviticus 6:23), <b>and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the conclusion of the service on Yom Kippur: <b>“And the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to atone</b> in the Sanctuary, shall be taken outside the camp, and they shall burn in the fire” (Leviticus 16:27). <b>Just as there,</b> the phrase “to atone” is referring <b>to</b> the stage <b>when</b> he has already <b>atoned,</b> as the bull and goat of Yom Kippur are burned after their blood has been sprinkled, <b>so too here,</b> the phrase “to atone” is referring <b>to</b> a situation <b>where</b> he has already <b>atoned,</b> whereas merely bringing the blood into the Sanctuary does not disqualify it.

### Part 6
The Gemara inquires: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara explains that one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that <b>one derives</b> a case of <b>outside,</b> i.e., the blood of a sin offering whose blood placement is on the external altar, which may not be brought inside the Sanctuary, <b>from</b> another prohibition of <b>outside,</b> the prohibition against entering the Sanctuary; <b>but one does not derive</b> a case of <b>outside from</b> the bull and goat of Yom Kippur, whose blood is brought <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary.

### Part 7
<b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>one derives</b> a <i>halakha</i> involving <b>an animal,</b> i.e., a sin offering whose blood placement is on the external altar, <b>from</b> another <i>halakha</i> involving <b>an animal,</b> the bull and goat of Yom Kippur; <b>but one does not derive</b> a case of <b>an animal from</b> a prohibition involving <b>a person.</b>

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If the priest took the blood into the Sanctuary unwittingly, the blood remains fit for presentation. The Gemara infers: <b>But</b> if his taking of the blood into the Sanctuary was <b>intentional,</b> it is <b>disqualified.</b> The Gemara analyzes this <i>halakha</i>: Is the blood disqualified only <b>in</b> a case <b>where</b> he took the blood into the Sanctuary and <b>atoned,</b> by sprinkling it inside the Sanctuary, as claimed by Rabbi Eliezer in the mishna; <b>or</b> even <b>in</b> a case <b>where</b> he took the blood in and <b>did not</b> yet <b>atone,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon?

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> that one can cite a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it is stated</b> with regard to the Yom Kippur service: <b>“And the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to atone in the Sanctuary,</b> shall be taken outside the camp, and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung; and he who burns them shall wash his clothes” (Leviticus 16:27–28), one can ask the following question: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “And he who burns”?</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara interrupts its citation of the <i>baraita</i> to question its line of inquiry. <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “And he who burns”?</b> One can answer that this term <b>was necessary for itself,</b> to teach that the one who burns the bull and goat of Yom Kippur is thereby rendered ritually impure. <b>Rather,</b> this is what the <i>baraita</i> is saying: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> twice: <b>“Sin offering,” “sin offering,”</b> with regard to the bull and the goat? It could have stated merely: And the bull and the goat of the sin offering.

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> answers <b>that</b> if the term “sin offering” had appeared only once, <b>we</b> would <b>have learned only with regard to</b> the <b>bull and</b> the <b>goat of Yom Kippur that are burned in the place of the ashes</b> that <b>they render ritually impure</b> the <b>garments</b> of the one who carries them. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the same applies to <b>other</b> sin offerings that are <b>burned? The verse states: “Sin offering,” “sin offering,”</b> twice, to include all sin offerings that are burned. This <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Meir says: This</b> derivation from the repeated mention of sin offering <b>is not necessary. Now</b> consider, the verse <b>states: “And the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin offering</b>…shall be taken outside the camp.” <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> with regard to these offerings: “Whose blood was brought in <b>to atone</b> in the Sanctuary,” <b>why</b> must <b>the verse</b> nevertheless <b>state: “To atone”?</b> This <b>teaches with regard to all</b> offerings <b>that atone</b> inside the Sanctuary <b>that one who burns them renders</b> his <b>garments impure.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara notes: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda does not learn</b> anything from the term <b>“to atone.” What is the reason</b> for this? Is it <b>not because he requires</b> this phrase <b>for a verbal analogy,</b> to derive that the blood of an external sin offering that was taken inside the Sanctuary is disqualified only if the priest sprinkled it, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon? This answers the Gemara’s question, as Rabbi Yehuda evidently follows the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.
