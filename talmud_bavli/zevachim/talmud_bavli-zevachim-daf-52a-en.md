### Part 1
such that with regard to an offering for <b>which</b> he sprinkles the blood on the <b>external</b> altar he should pour the remainder of the blood <b>on</b> the <b>inner</b> altar, <b>and</b> this is analogous to the <i>halakha</i> that he pours the remainder <b>of</b> the blood sprinkled on the <b>inner</b> altar <b>on</b> the base of the <b>external</b> altar, this is not possible. <b>But the inner</b> altar <b>itself does not have a base,</b> and therefore it is not possible to pour the remainder of the blood on the base of the inner altar. Therefore, the verse must teach that the remainder of the blood of the burnt offering is poured on the base of the external altar.

### Part 2
The Gemara analyzes the next clause of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Or</b> perhaps it <b>is not</b> so, but <b>rather</b> the verse serves to teach that any sprinkling of blood on the corners of the <b>altar of</b> the <b>burnt offering will be</b> done on a part of the altar where there is <b>a base.</b> The Gemara asks: How can the verse mean that? <b>Is it written: At the base of the burnt offering?</b> This would indicate that the blood of the burnt offering must be placed where there is a base. <b>It is written</b> in the verse: <b>“At the base of the altar of burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:25).

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: Even if the verse were to be speaking about sprinkling the blood of the burnt offering and is not referring to pouring the remainder of the blood, the term “altar of” is necessary, because <b>if it were written: At the base of the burnt offering, I would say</b> that the priest must sprinkle the blood <b>on the upright</b> wall <b>of the base</b> of the altar, i.e., the side of the base, rather than on the upper surface of the base. <b>Now that it is written: “At the base of the altar of the burnt offering,”</b> it means that the blood must be sprinkled <b>on the upper surface of the base.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara explains the next clause of the <i>baraita</i> based on this understanding: <b>Rabbi Yishmael said: Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to teach that the blood must be sprinkled on the <b>upper surface of</b> the <b>base</b> of the altar? <b>It</b> can be derived via <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>Just as the remainder</b> of the blood <b>of a sin offering, which does not effect atonement,</b> nevertheless <b>requires</b> that it must be poured on the <b>upper surface of</b> the <b>base</b> of the altar, with regard to <b>the initial</b> sprinkling of the blood <b>of a burnt offering, which effects atonement, is it not logical that it requires</b> the <b>upper surface of</b> the <b>base</b> of the altar?

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Akiva</b> explained similarly and <b>said: And just as the remainder</b> of the blood <b>of a sin offering, which does not effect atonement and does not come for atonement,</b> nevertheless <b>requires</b> that it must be poured on the <b>upper surface of</b> the <b>base,</b> with regard to <b>the initial</b> sprinkling of the blood <b>of a burnt offering, which effects atonement and comes for atonement, is it not logical that it requires</b> the <b>upper surface of</b> the <b>base</b> of the altar? The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>If so, why</b> must <b>the verse state: “At the base of the altar of burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:25)? It is to teach that you must <b>give a base to the altar of</b> the <b>burnt offering,</b> i.e., that the remainder of any blood sprinkled on the altar must be poured on the base.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the explanations of Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva? <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says:</b> The difference <b>between them</b> is whether failure to pour the <b>remainder</b> of the blood <b>disqualifies</b> the offering, so that all the sprinklings must be done again. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yishmael, <b>holds</b> that failure to pour the remainder of the blood does <b>disqualify</b> the offering. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Akiva, who adds the words: Which does not come for atonement, <b>holds</b> that failure to pour the remainder of the blood does <b>not disqualify</b> the offering.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Pappa says: Everyone</b> agrees that failure to pour the <b>remainder</b> of the blood on the base does <b>not disqualify</b> the offering. <b>But here they disagree with regard to</b> the issue of whether failure to <b>squeeze</b> the blood from <b>a bird sin offering</b> after sprinkling the blood <b>disqualifies</b> the offering or not. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yishmael, <b>holds</b> that it does <b>disqualify</b> the offering, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>holds</b> that it does <b>not disqualify</b> the offering.

### Part 8
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa</b> that even Rabbi Yishmael agrees that failure to pour the remainder of the blood on the base does not disqualify the offering. The verse states: “And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the corners of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord, which is in the Tent of Meeting; <b>and all the remaining blood</b> of the bull <b>he shall pour out</b> at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 4:7). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “of the bull”?</b> This seems superfluous, as the entire passage is referring to the bull. This serves to <b>teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of</b> another bull, i.e., <b>the bull of Yom Kippur, which</b> also <b>requires placement of blood on the base</b> of the external altar. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yishmael said:</b> It is not necessary for the Torah to write that the blood of the bull of Yom Kippur requires placement of blood on the base of the external altar. This is because it can be derived via <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And just as if</b> the bull of the anointed priest, i.e., the sin offering of a High Priest, with regard to <b>which it is not obligatory to bring its blood inside</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., it is not an obligatory offering, as he brings it only if he sins, nevertheless <b>requires</b> sprinkling blood on the <b>base</b> of the altar; with regard to the bull of Yom Kippur, with regard to <b>which it is obligatory to bring its blood inside</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., it must be brought every year, <b>is it not logical that it requires</b> sprinkling of its blood on the <b>base</b> of the altar?

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Akiva said: Just as</b> the bull of a High Priest, with regard to <b>which its blood does not enter the innermost sanctum, whether as</b> a fixed <b>obligation or as a mitzva,</b> nevertheless <b>requires</b> pouring of blood on the <b>base</b> of the altar, concerning the bull of Yom Kippur, with regard to <b>which its blood enters the innermost sanctum</b> as <b>an obligation, is it not logical that it requires</b> pouring of blood on the <b>base</b> of the altar?

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that the reason the Torah writes the phrase “of the bull” is to teach that failure to place the blood on the base of the external altar <b>disqualifies</b> the offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the service of Yom Kippur, after sprinkling the blood in the Sanctuary: <b>“And when he has made an end of atoning for the Sanctuary,</b> and the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat” (Leviticus 16:20). This teaches that once he has sprinkled the blood in the innermost sanctum <b>all the atonements are completed.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>

### Part 12
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From now,</b> i.e., based on this, one can state <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>to</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the bull of</b> the <b>anointed priest from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the goat of</b> the <b>king. Just as</b> the goat sin offering of a king, with regard to <b>which its blood does not enter inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>whether</b> as a fixed <b>obligation or</b> as <b>a mitzva,</b> but is sprinkled, like other individual sin offerings, on the external altar, <b>requires</b> that the blood be poured on the <b>base</b> of the altar (see Leviticus 4:25); with regard to the sin offering of a High Priest, the blood of <b>which enters inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>whether as</b> a fixed <b>obligation or as a mitzva, is it not logical that it should require</b> pouring on the <b>base</b> of the altar?

### Part 13
If so, the verse that states that there is a requirement that the blood of the sin offering of a High Priest is poured on the base of the altar is apparently superfluous. One <b>might</b> have thought that the reason the Torah writes it is to teach that failure to pour the blood there <b>disqualifies</b> the offering. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And the priest shall sprinkle of the blood upon the corners of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord, which is in the Tent of Meeting, <b>and all the remaining blood of the bull he shall pour</b> out at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 4:7).

### Part 14
The <i>baraita</i> explains: Since the verse inverted the terms in the clause, writing: “And all the remaining blood of the bull he shall pour out,” and not: He shall pour out all the remaining blood of the bull, the <b>verse detaches this positive</b> mitzva of pouring the remaining blood from the other mitzvot in the verse. <b>And</b> the verse thereby <b>made</b> this <b>a non-essential mitzva, to tell you</b> that failure to pour the <b>remainder</b> of the blood on the base of the altar does <b>not disqualify</b> the offering. This <i>baraita</i> supports Rav Pappa’s interpretation, that Rabbi Yishmael agrees that failure to pour the remainder of the blood on the base of the altar does not disqualify the offering.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> does <b>Rabbi Yishmael hold</b> that failure to <b>squeeze out</b> the blood of <b>a bird sin offering disqualifies</b> the offering, as Rav Pappa explained? <b>But the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse states: “And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; <b>and the remainder of the blood shall be squeezed out</b> at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:9). This means: <b>And the remainder shall be squeezed out,</b> i.e., it needs to be squeezed out only if some blood remains.
