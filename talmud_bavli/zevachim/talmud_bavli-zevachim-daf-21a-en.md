### Part 1
<b>And</b> in preparation for the rite of the red <b>heifer, we</b> intentionally <b>impart impurity to</b> the priest after he has already sanctified his hands and feet, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 3:7): <b>They would render the priest who burns the heifer ritually impure and immerse him</b> immediately, <b>to remove</b> a misconception <b>from the hearts of</b> the <b>Sadducees</b> by means of a public display of disregard for their ruling. <b>As</b> the Sadducees <b>would say:</b> Only <b>by those for whom the sun set was</b> the heifer ritual <b>performed.</b> The Sadducees believed that it is prohibited for an impure priest who immersed that day to burn the red heifer until sunset, when the purification process is completed. The Gemara concludes: Since this impurity does not disqualify the sanctification of his hands and feet, <b>learn from it</b> that <b>impurity does not disqualify</b> sanctification of the hands and feet in general.

### Part 2
The Gemara responds: The service of the <b>heifer is different, as one who immersed that day is not unfit for</b> performing <b>it,</b> unlike any other rite. Likewise, impurity does not disqualify the sanctification of hands and feet preceding the service of the heifer. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why do I</b> require <b>that</b> the priest <b>sanctify</b> his hands and feet at all for the service of the red heifer? The Gemara responds: <b>We require</b> that the service of the red heifer be <b>similar to</b> the <b>service</b> of offerings performed inside the Temple.

### Part 3
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a priest who wishes <b>to sanctify his hands and feet</b> by dipping them <b>in the Basin</b> rather than letting the water run from it onto them? Must one say that the priest may not do so, since <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet <b>from it”</b> (Exodus 30:19), <b>and not inside it? Or perhaps</b> the priest may <b>even</b> use water still <b>inside it.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Or</b> if a priest <b>immersed in cave water and performed</b> the <b>service, his service is disqualified,</b> since this is not adequate sanctification of the hands and feet. From the <i>baraita</i> one infers: <b>But</b> if he used <b>water from</b> the <b>Basin</b> in a manner <b>similar to cave water,</b> i.e., by immersing his hands, <b>and performed</b> the <b>service, his service is valid.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is possible that immersing one’s hands in the Basin is insufficient as well. Nevertheless, it <b>was necessary for</b> the <i>baraita</i> to mention <b>cave water</b> so <b>that you shall not say:</b> If one <b>may immerse his entire body in</b> cave water to purify himself, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that he may sanctify <b>his hands and feet</b> by immersing them in cave water? The <i>baraita</i> therefore teaches that despite being fit for immersion of the entire body, cave water is unfit for sanctification of the hands and feet.

### Part 6
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef says: The water in</b> the <b>Basin is disqualified</b> by being left out, at different times of day for different rites. <b>For</b> rites that are <b>permitting factors</b> for an offering, i.e., that must be performed before the meat of the offering may be eaten, the water is disqualified at sunset, <b>like</b> the <b>permitting factors</b> themselves, which may be performed only during the day. For example, if a priest wishes to sprinkle an offering’s blood on the altar, he may not sanctify his hands and feet from the Basin unless it was sunk into its pit at sunset on the previous day, preventing the water from being disqualified. Similarly, <b>for</b> the burning of the offering’s <b>limbs</b> on the altar, which may be performed all night, the water in the Basin is disqualified at dawn, <b>like</b> the <b>limbs</b> themselves.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ḥisda says: Even for</b> the performance of <b>permitting factors,</b> the water <b>is disqualified only at dawn, as</b> it is for the burning of the <b>limbs. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Once</b> one <b>has sunk</b> the Basin into its pit at the end of the day’s service, reconnecting the water in the Basin to flowing water to prevent it from being disqualified, <b>he may not raise it up again</b> the entire night.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> if the Basin was not sunk before sunset the water inside is <b>unfit for</b> the <b>night’s service as well? But doesn’t Rabbi Asi say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Ilfa:</b> With regard to <b>a Basin that</b> the priests <b>did not sink</b> into its pit <b>at night,</b> a priest <b>sanctifies</b> his hands and feet <b>from it for the service of</b> that <b>night, and the next day he does not sanctify</b> from it? Apparently, for purposes of the night’s service, the water in the Basin is not disqualified at sunset.

### Part 9
The Gemara responds: <b>What</b> does it mean <b>when it says: He may not raise it up</b> again? It means that he may not raise it to sanctify his hands and feet in preparation <b>for</b> the <b>day’s service; but</b> the water is <b>fit</b> for sanctification <b>for</b> the <b>night’s service.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, this is</b> the same as the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef,</b> i.e., that for purposes of the day’s service the water in the Basin is disqualified at sunset, and for purposes of the night’s service it is disqualified at dawn.
