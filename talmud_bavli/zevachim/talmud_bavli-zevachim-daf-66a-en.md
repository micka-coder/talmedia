### Part 1
It means that the priest <b>does not have to separate</b> it, but not that it is prohibited to do so. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: If that is so,</b> then <b>with regard to a pit</b> in the public domain, <b>where it is written:</b> “And if a man shall open a pit…<b>and does not cover it”</b> (Exodus 21:33), can one claim that this verse <b>also</b> means <b>that he does not have to cover</b> it?

### Part 2
The Gemara responds: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> with regard to a pit, <b>since it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“The owner of the pit shall pay”</b> (Exodus 21:34), it is evident that <b>it is incumbent upon him to cover</b> the pit. <b>But here, since it is written</b> with regard to a bird burnt offering: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall bring it</b> to the altar” (Leviticus 1:15), the term “it” indicates that the verse is referring only to a burnt offering, and <b>the verse has</b> thereby <b>differentiated between a bird sin offering and a bird burnt offering.</b>

### Part 3
Consequently, it is obvious that whereas the priest must completely separate the head of a bird burnt offering, this is not the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a sin offering. <b>Why do I</b> need the verse to state with regard to a bird sin offering: “But <b>shall not separate it”</b> (Leviticus 5:8)? <b>Conclude from</b> this verse that it is not forbidden to separate the head of a bird sin offering from the body, but rather <b>one does not have to separate</b> it.

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches that if the priest squeezed out the blood of the head and did not squeeze out the blood of the body, it is disqualified. If he <b>squeezed out</b> the <b>blood of the body</b> and did not squeeze out the blood of the head, the offering is valid. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In reference to a bird burnt offering, the verse states, seemingly unnecessarily: “It is <b>a burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 1:17). This teaches <b>that even though</b> the priest <b>squeezed out the blood of the body and did not squeeze out the blood of the head,</b> it is valid. One <b>might</b> have thought that if the priest <b>squeezed out the blood of the head and did not squeeze out the blood of the body</b> the offering is still valid. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It is.”</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation</b> for the opinion that the offering is valid if the priest squeezed out only the blood of the body but not if he squeezed out only the blood of the head? <b>Ravina said:</b> There is no conclusive proof from the language of the verse itself, but it <b>stands to reason</b> that this is the case, <b>as most of the blood is found in the body,</b> not the head.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If the priest <b>sacrificed a bird sin offering</b> in its designated place <b>below</b> the red line, and he sacrificed it <b>according to the procedure of a sin offering</b> with pinching, i.e., cutting from the nape with a fingernail, and sprinkling, and he sacrificed it <b>for the sake of a sin offering,</b> the offering is <b>fit.</b> This is the manner in which a priest is to sacrifice a sin offering <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 8
If the priest sacrificed the bird sin offering below the red line in the middle of the altar and <b>according to the procedure of a sin offering,</b> but he sacrificed it <b>for the sake of a burnt offering;</b> or if he sacrificed it <b>according to the procedure of a burnt offering,</b> even if he sacrificed it <b>for the sake of a sin offering;</b> or if he sacrificed it <b>according to the procedure of a burnt offering for the sake of a burnt offering;</b> in all these cases the sin offering is <b>disqualified.</b> If <b>one sacrificed</b> a bird sin offering <b>above</b> the red line <b>according to the procedure of any of</b> the offerings, it is <b>disqualified,</b> because he did not sacrifice it in its designated place.

### Part 9
<b>A bird burnt offering that one sacrificed</b> in its designated place <b>above</b> the red line <b>according to the procedure of a burnt offering</b> and <b>for the sake of a burnt offering</b> is <b>fit.</b> This is the manner in which a priest is to sacrifice a burnt offering <i>ab initio</i>. If he sacrificed a bird burnt offering above the red line <b>according to the procedure of</b> the <b>burnt offering</b> but <b>for the sake of a sin offering,</b> the offering is <b>fit, but it did not satisfy the obligation of its owner.</b>

### Part 10
If the priest sacrificed a bird burnt offering <b>according to the procedure of a sin offering for the sake of a burnt offering,</b> or <b>according to the procedure of a sin offering for the sake of a sin offering,</b> the offering is <b>disqualified.</b> If <b>he sacrificed it below</b> the red line <b>according to the procedure of any of</b> the offerings, it is <b>disqualified,</b> because he did not sacrifice it in its designated place.
