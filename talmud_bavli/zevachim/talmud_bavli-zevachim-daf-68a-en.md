### Part 1
<b>she must bring another five birds</b> and sacrifice them all <b>above</b> the red line as burnt offerings. Since her commitment was not satisfied, she has not fulfilled even part of her vow. She must therefore bring two burnt offerings of each species to ensure that she fulfills her vow, and she must bring another bird to replace the initial obligatory burnt offering and fulfill her commitment to bring them together.

### Part 2
This is the <i>halakha</i> only if both pairs that she brought were <b>of the same species. But</b> if they were <b>of two</b> different <b>species,</b> and the priest does not remember which he sacrificed first as the obligatory pair, <b>she must bring six,</b> two of each species to ensure that she fulfills her vow, and one more of each species to ensure that she properly replaces the original burnt offering of the obligatory pair and fulfills her commitment.

### Part 3
If the woman specified the species of bird for her vow but then forgot which species she specified, and <b>she gave</b> two pairs of birds <b>to the priest but does not know</b> now <b>what</b> species <b>she gave,</b> or even if she gave him one or two species of birds, and <b>the priest went and sacrificed</b> the birds <b>but does not know</b> now <b>what he sacrificed</b> where, in this case, <b>she must</b> bring seven birds, as follows: <b>Four birds,</b> two of each species, <b>for her vow; and two</b> more birds, one of each species, <b>for her obligatory</b> burnt offering, in case the priest sacrificed a sin offering of a certain species and the burnt offering must now match that species; <b>and one sin offering</b> of either species, in case the priest sacrificed them all as burnt offerings.

### Part 4
<b>Ben Azzai says</b> she must bring <b>two sin offerings,</b> one of each species, as he holds that if the priest sacrificed a bird of a certain species specifically as the obligatory burnt offering, the sin offering must now match that species.

### Part 5
The mishna concludes: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said</b> that there is a parable that explains this situation: <b>This is what</b> people <b>say</b> about a sheep: <b>When it is alive it</b> makes <b>one sound, and when it is dead it</b> makes <b>seven sounds.</b> Its two horns become trumpets, its two shinbones become flutes, its skin becomes a drumhead, its large intestines become harp strings, and its small intestines become lyre strings. Here too, because of the uncertainty as to what had occurred, the woman must bring seven extra birds. Since Rabbi Yehoshua summarizes the mishna, the <i>mishnayot</i> in this chapter must be in accordance with his opinion. According to Rav Adda bar Ahava’s explanation of Rabbi Yehoshua’s principle, burnt offerings of birds sacrificed as sin offerings become valid sin offerings. Why then, according to these <i>mishnayot</i>, are they disqualified?

### Part 6
The Gemara responds: Rav Adda bar Ahava’s explanation is not at odds with these <i>mishnayot</i>; while it is reasonable to <b>say,</b> i.e., to explain, <b>that Rabbi Yehoshua said</b> that the offering becomes a sin offering insofar as <b>to exclude</b> one who derives benefit from <b>it from</b> liability for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>did he say</b> that it becomes a sin offering so expansively as <b>to</b> indicate that it would <b>satisfy</b> the owner’s <b>obligation?</b> In the cases in the <i>mishnayot</i> in <i>Kinnim</i>, all burnt offerings that were sacrificed as sin offerings are not subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse of consecrated property, but the women must nevertheless bring replacement offerings.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>any</b> of those people <b>disqualified</b> from performing the Temple service <b>who pinched</b> the nape of a bird offering, <b>their pinching is not valid, but</b> the offering’s meat <b>does not render</b> one who swallows it <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat,</b> as would the meat of a kosher bird that was not ritually slaughtered. If a priest <b>pinched</b> it <b>with</b> the thumbnail of his <b>left</b> hand, <b>or</b> if he pinched it <b>at night,</b> or if <b>he slaughtered a non-sacred</b> bird <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>or a sacrificial</b> bird <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, in all these cases, although it is prohibited to consume these birds, <b>they do not render</b> one <b>ritually impure</b> when they are <b>in the throat,</b> as the halakhic status of pinching is like that of slaughtering.

### Part 8
If <b>he pinched with a knife</b> and not with his thumbnail; or if <b>he pinched a non-sacred</b> bird <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>or a sacrificial</b> bird <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard;
