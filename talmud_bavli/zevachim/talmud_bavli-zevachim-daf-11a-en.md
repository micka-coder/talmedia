### Part 1
with regard to <b>a burnt offering, which is</b> totally <b>consumed</b> by the fire on the altar, nevertheless, even if <b>its blood enters into</b> the Sanctuary it is <b>fit,</b> with regard to <b>a guilt offering, which is not</b> entirely <b>consumed</b> on the altar, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that even if its blood enters the Sanctuary it remains fit?

### Part 2
The Gemara refutes this inference: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a burnt offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that it does not atone</b> for a sin. Perhaps this is why its blood is not disqualified if it enters the sanctuary.

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: <b>The meal offering of a sinner can prove</b> the point, as it is not disqualified by entering the Sanctuary, even though it atones for a sin.

### Part 4
The Gemara interjects: <b>But let us say</b> that <b>a bird sin offering can prove</b> the point, as it too atones for a sin but is not disqualified by entering the Sanctuary. This case is more similar to that of a guilt offering, as a bird has blood, unlike a meal offering. The Gemara answers: It is not certain that <b>a bird sin offering</b> is not disqualified by entering the Sanctuary; this <b>is a dilemma</b> raised <b>by Rabbi Avin.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>But let us refute</b> the above response as follows: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a sinner’s meal offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that it is not a type of slaughtered offering.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: If so, <b>a burnt offering can prove</b> the point, since it is a slaughtered offering, and still if its blood enters the Sanctuary, it is not disqualified. <b>And the inference has reverted</b> to its starting point. The <i>halakha</i> is derived from the <i>halakhot</i> of a burnt offering and a sinner’s meal offering: <b>The aspect of this</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> case <b>and the aspect of that</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> case. <b>Their common element is that they are offerings of the most sacred order, and</b> if they <b>enter into</b> the Sanctuary <b>they are</b> still <b>fit. So too, I shall include a guilt offering</b> and infer that <b>since it is</b> also <b>an offering of the most sacred order,</b> if <b>its blood enters into</b> the Sanctuary it is still <b>fit.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rava of Barnish said to Rav Ashi: But let us refute</b> this inference: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about their common element?</b> It is notable <b>in that neither</b> a burnt offering nor a sinner’s meal offering <b>has a fixed</b> value. <b>Should you say</b> the same <i>halakhot</i> apply <b>to a guilt offering, which has a fixed</b> value?

### Part 8
<b>Rather, this is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis: As the verse states:</b> “And any sin offering, any of <b>whose blood</b> is brought into the Tent of Meeting to atone in the Sanctuary, shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:23). The term “whose blood” teaches that <b>the blood of this</b> offering, i.e., a sin offering, <b>and not the blood of another</b> offering, is disqualified in this manner.

### Part 9
<b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Eliezer, interpret this term? He derives from it that only <b>its blood</b> is disqualified by entering the Sanctuary, <b>but not its flesh.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And</b> from where do <b>the other</b> Rabbis derive that the flesh of a sin offering is not disqualified by entering the Sanctuary? They maintain that both <i>halakhot</i> are derived from this term, as the verse could have simply stated: <b>Blood,</b> but stated: <b>“Whose blood.”</b> The redundancy excludes not only the flesh, but also other offerings.

### Part 11
<b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Eliezer, <b>does not interpret</b> the redundancy indicated by the change from: <b>Blood,</b> to: <b>“Whose blood,”</b> to be significant. Once the word blood is mentioned, it is grammatically necessary for the verse to state “whose blood.”

### Part 12
§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the dispute in the mishna between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis. <b>Granted, according to the Rabbis, who say</b> that <b>a guilt offering that one slaughtered not for its sake</b> is <b>fit, that is why a meal offering is juxtaposed with a sin offering,</b> and <b>a meal offering</b> is also juxtaposed <b>with a guilt offering.</b>

### Part 13
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse states with regard to a meal offering: <b>“It is most sacred, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), teaching that <b>a meal offering of a sinner is like a sin offering. Therefore,</b> if one <b>removed its handful not for its sake,</b> it is <b>disqualified.</b> And the verse also teaches that <b>a voluntary meal offering is like a guilt offering. Therefore,</b> if one <b>removed its handful not for its sake,</b> it is still <b>fit.</b> This accords with the opinion of the Rabbis, that a guilt offering slaughtered not for its sake is fit.

### Part 14
<b>But according to Rabbi Eliezer, for what <i>halakha</i> is a meal offering juxtaposed with a sin offering, and a meal offering</b> juxtaposed <b>with a guilt offering?</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: They are juxtaposed <b>to</b> teach <b>the other</b> <i>halakha</i> derived <b>by Rabbi Shimon</b> from this verse; <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 26a): If the handful of a meal offering is conveyed to the altar <b>not in a service vessel,</b> the offering is <b>unfit. And Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>fit.</b>

### Part 16
<b>And Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon? The verse states</b> with regard to a meal offering: <b>“It is most sacred, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering,”</b> teaching that if a priest <b>comes to perform</b> its sacrificial rites <b>by hand, he must perform</b> them <b>with</b> his <b>right</b> hand, <b>like</b> one performs the rites of <b>a sin offering.</b> And if he performs them <b>with a vessel, he may perform</b> them <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>like</b> one performs the rites of <b>a guilt offering,</b> since Rabbi Shimon maintains this is permitted in the case of a guilt offering.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> himself, <b>does he expound this verse for this</b> purpose, concerning one who if one removes its handful not for its sake, <b>and expound it for that</b> purpose, concerning conveying the handful with one’s hand?

### Part 18
The Gemara answers: <b>The verse comes mainly to</b> teach <b>that which Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> explained. <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that a meal offering of a sinner</b> whose handful was removed <b>not for its sake</b> is <b>unfit is</b> due to <b>another reason: What is the reason a sin offering</b> sacrificed not for its sake is disqualified? The reason is <b>that</b> the word <b>“it” is written with regard to it</b> in the verse: “It is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). Since the word <b>“it” is also written with regard to the meal offering of a sinner,</b> in the verse: “For it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:11), the same applies in that case.

### Part 19
In the mishna, Rabbi Eliezer cites the verse: “As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering” (Leviticus 7:7), as a source for his opinion. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the Rabbis, for what <i>halakha</i> is a guilt offering juxtaposed with a sin offering?</b> The Gemara answers: They are juxtaposed <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as a sin offering requires placing hands</b> on the head of the offering, <b>so too, a guilt offering requires placing hands</b> on the head of the offering.

### Part 20
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Yosef ben Ḥoni says:</b> Other offerings <b>that are slaughtered</b> for the sake of a Paschal offering or a sin offering are unfit. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Yosef ben Ḥoni and Rabbi Eliezer said the same thing,</b> i.e., Rabbi Eliezer agrees with Yosef ben Ḥoni.

### Part 21
<b>Rabba says:</b> Although they agree that other offerings slaughtered for the sake of a Paschal offering are unfit, <b>they disagree with regard to other</b> offerings slaughtered <b>for the sake of a sin offering.</b> Whereas Yosef ben Ḥoni holds that they are unfit, Rabbi Eliezer maintains that they are fit.

### Part 22
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a Paschal offering whose</b> first <b>year has passed,</b> and it must therefore be sacrificed as a peace offering, <b>and one slaughtered it at its</b> designated <b>time</b> on Passover eve <b>for its own sake</b> as a Paschal offering, <b>and likewise,</b> if <b>one slaughtered other</b> offerings <b>for the sake of a Paschal offering at its</b> designated <b>time,</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree as to the status of the offering. <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> it <b>unfit, and Rabbi Yehoshua deems</b> it <b>fit.</b>

### Part 23
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: If, during the rest of the days of the year, when</b> a Paschal offering <b>is not fit</b> if it is slaughtered <b>for its own sake,</b> nevertheless, <b>other</b> offerings that are slaughtered <b>for its sake are fit,</b> then <b>at its</b> designated <b>time, when</b> a Paschal offering <b>is fit</b> if it is slaughtered <b>for its own sake, isn’t it logical that other</b> offerings slaughtered <b>for its sake should be fit?</b>

### Part 24
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: Or conversely, just as during the rest of the days of the year, when</b> a Paschal offering <b>is not fit</b> if it is slaughtered <b>for its own sake, it is fit</b> if slaughtered <b>for the sake of other</b> offerings, so too, <b>at its</b> designated <b>time, when it is fit</b> if slaughtered <b>for its own sake, isn’t it logical that it should be fit</b> if slaughtered <b>for the sake of other</b> offerings? <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>a Paschal offering</b> slaughtered <b>not for its own sake on</b> the <b>fourteenth</b> of Nisan <b>should be deemed fit,</b> which contradicts the <i>halakha</i>. Clearly, this line of reasoning leads to incorrect conclusions.

### Part 25
Furthermore, Rabbi Eliezer refuted Rabbi Yehoshua’s logic as follows: <b>And do you say this</b> derivation? <b>What</b> does it matter <b>to me</b> that <b>other</b> offerings slaughtered <b>during the rest of the days of the year for the sake of</b> a Paschal offering <b>are deemed fit? After all,</b> a Paschal offering slaughtered <b>for the sake of other</b> offerings <b>is</b> also <b>fit. But</b> must you say that <b>other</b> offerings slaughtered <b>at its</b> designated <b>time for its sake should be deemed fit? After all,</b> at its designated time, a Paschal offering slaughtered <b>for the sake of other</b> offerings <b>is unfit.</b>

### Part 26
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: If,</b> as you maintain, other offerings slaughtered on Passover eve for the sake of a Paschal offering are disqualified, <b>you have diminished the force</b> of the requirement that <b>a Paschal offering</b> be sacrificed for its own sake, <b>and you have given</b> more <b>force to</b> the requirement that <b>a peace offering</b> be sacrificed for its own sake. A Paschal offering sacrificed at the proper time, i.e., during the rest of the year, for the sake of a peace offering, is fit, whereas a peace offering sacrificed on Passover eve for the sake of a Paschal offering is unfit.

### Part 27
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Eliezer then presented a different logical inference: We find</b> that <b>a leftover Paschal offering,</b> an animal consecrated as a Paschal offering but ultimately not sacrificed on Passover eve, is <b>brought</b> as <b>a peace offering; but a leftover peace offering,</b> one bought with money left over from funds dedicated toward the acquisition of a peace offering, is <b>not brought</b> as <b>a Paschal offering.</b> A Paschal offering is a potential peace offering, but a peace offering is not a potential Paschal offering.

### Part 28
<b>And</b> if so, one may infer <i>a fortiori</i>: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a Paschal offering, whose leftover</b> offering <b>is brought</b> as <b>a peace offering,</b> and nevertheless, if one <b>slaughtered it at its</b> designated <b>time for the sake of a peace offering</b> it is <b>unfit,</b> so too, with regard to <b>a peace offering, whose leftover</b> offering <b>is not brought</b> as <b>a Paschal offering, if</b> one <b>slaughtered</b> it <b>for the sake of a Paschal offering at its</b> designated <b>time, isn’t it logical that</b> it <b>should be unfit?</b>
