<b>at the level of their elbows.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Ashi says: Huna bar Natan said to me: Once, I was standing before Izgadar, king</b> of Persia, <b>and my belt was raised</b> above its appropriate height, <b>and he lowered it</b> into place <b>and said to me: “A kingdom of priests, and a holy nation”</b> (Exodus 19:6), <b>is written about you;</b> therefore, you should always look dignified. <b>When I came before Ameimar</b> and recounted this incident, <b>he said to me: With regard to you,</b> God’s promise to Israel: <b>“And kings shall be your foster fathers”</b> (Isaiah 49:23), <b>was fulfilled.</b>

### Part 3
§ With regard to the priestly vestments, <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Eiruvin</i> 103b): <b>A priest who was injured on his finger</b> on Shabbat may temporarily <b>wrap it with a reed</b> so that his wound is not visible while he is serving in the Temple. This leniency applies <b>in the Temple, but not in</b> the rest of <b>the country,</b> as the reed also heals the wound, and medical treatment is prohibited on Shabbat by rabbinic decree. <b>But if</b> his intention is <b>to draw blood from</b> the wound, <b>it is prohibited</b> both <b>here and there.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: They taught only</b> that <b>a reed</b> is permitted. <b>But a small sash [<i>tziltzul</i>]</b> as a bandage <b>is</b> considered <b>an extra garment</b> and is therefore forbidden, since it is prohibited for a priest to add to the priestly vestments prescribed by the Torah. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They said</b> that wearing <b>extra garments</b> is prohibited <b>only</b> if the extra garment is worn <b>in a place</b> on the priest’s body where the requisite <b>vestments</b> are worn. <b>But</b> if the sash is <b>in a place</b> on his body where the <b>vestments</b> are <b>not</b> worn, e.g., on his hand, it <b>is not</b> considered <b>an extra</b> garment.

### Part 5
The Gemara challenges: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>derive</b> that a sash is prohibited <b>because</b> it acts as <b>an interposition</b> between the priest’s hand and the sacred vessel he grips, which disqualifies the service. The Gemara rejects this: Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring to a case where the wound is <b>on</b> the priest’s <b>left</b> hand. Since the entire service is performed exclusively with his right hand, a bandage on his left hand is not an interposition. <b>Alternatively,</b> the wound is on the priest’s right hand, but <b>not in a place</b> used for the <b>service,</b> such that the bandage does not interpose between his hand and the sacred vessel.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion <b>of Rava, as Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says: In a place</b> on the priest’s body where the <b>vestments</b> are worn, <b>even one</b> extra <b>thread interposes</b> and is prohibited, whereas <b>in a place</b> on his body where the <b>vestments</b> are <b>not</b> worn, if the fabric is <b>three</b> fingerbreadths <b>by three</b> fingerbreadths <b>it interposes,</b> but if it is <b>less than that it does not interpose.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara notes: Rava <b>certainly disagrees with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who holds that fabric of any size that is in a place on his body where the vestments are not worn is not considered an interposition. <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>he</b> also <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who deems any sash an interposition, even one smaller than three by three fingerbreadths?

### Part 8
The Gemara responds: Even according to Rava, <b>a small sash is different, as it is significant,</b> and it is therefore considered a garment even if it is less than three by three fingerbreadths.

### Part 9
<b>Some say</b> that there is <b>another version</b> of the dispute: <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says</b> that <b>they taught only</b> that <b>a reed</b> is permitted, <b>but a small sash interposes. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They said</b> that an item acts as <b>an interposition when</b> it is <b>less than three by three</b> fingerbreadths <b>only in a place</b> on the priest’s body where the <b>vestments</b> are worn. <b>But in a place</b> on his body where the <b>vestments</b> are <b>not</b> worn, the following distinction applies: If the fabric is <b>three</b> fingerbreadths <b>by three</b> fingerbreadths, <b>it interposes,</b> but if it is <b>less than this, it does not interpose. And this is</b> the same ruling <b>that Rava</b> says that <b>Rav Ḥisda says.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that Rava <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who deems any sash an interposition, even one smaller than three fingerbreadths by three fingerbreadths. The Gemara rejects this: This is not necessarily so, as <b>a small sash is different, since it is significant.</b> It is therefore like a vestment, even if it is smaller than three fingerbreadths by three fingerbreadths.

### Part 11
The Gemara raises a question: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, why</b> does the mishna teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>specifically</b> with regard to <b>a reed? Let</b> the mishna <b>teach us</b> that a priest may wrap his wounded finger with <b>a small sash,</b> since this would teach the greater novelty that although a sash is significant, it does not constitute an interposition. The Gemara responds: <b>It teaches us a matter in passing, that a reed heals.</b>

### Part 12
§ <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If a gust of <b>wind entered</b> the priest’s <b>vestment,</b> raising it slightly off his body, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do <b>we require</b> that the vestment be: <b>“Upon his body”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), in a literal sense, <b>and this</b> is <b>not</b> the case when the wind raises his vestment? <b>Or perhaps</b> the service is valid because <b>this</b> is the normal <b>manner of wearing</b> clothes.

### Part 13
Furthermore, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a louse</b> found under the priest’s vestments? <b>Does it interpose</b> between the vestments and his body, disqualifying the service?

### Part 14
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Do not raise a dilemma</b> with regard to <b>a dead</b> louse, <b>as</b> it <b>certainly interposes,</b> like any other item. Rather, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a live</b> louse? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since it comes and goes,</b> i.e., it moves around on his body, <b>it is</b> like <b>a growth and does not interpose? Or perhaps, since he objects to its</b> presence, <b>it interposes?</b>

### Part 15
Furthermore, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>dirt</b> found under the priest’s vestments? <b>Does it interpose?</b> The Gemara objects: But <b>dirt certainly interposes.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>Rather,</b> the question is: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>dust of dirt,</b> i.e., a minute amount of dust?

### Part 16
Furthermore, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the gap between the underarm of the vestment and the priest’s <b>armpit? Does it interpose?</b> Do <b>we require</b> that the vestment is <b>“upon his body”</b> in a literal sense, <b>and this</b> is <b>not</b> the case? <b>Or perhaps</b> the service is valid since <b>this</b> is the normal <b>manner of wearing</b> clothes.

### Part 17
Furthermore, if the priest <b>inserted his hand into</b> his vestments and touched <b>his chest, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Does his body interpose or not?</b>

### Part 18
Furthermore, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a thread [<i>nima</i>]? Does it interpose?</b> The Gemara interjects: But <b>a thread certainly interposes. Rather,</b> the question is: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a thread</b> that <b>hangs</b> off the vestment itself and will soon fall off? Is such a thread considered as though it has already detached from the vestment, in which case it interposes?

### Part 19
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>his hair emerged</b> from his head and extended <b>into his vestment</b> and separated it from his skin, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Is his hair considered like his body,</b> in which case it does not interpose, <b>or is it not considered like his body?</b>

### Part 20
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>phylacteries? Do they interpose?</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of one who says</b> that <b>night is not</b> an appropriate <b>time</b> to don <b>phylacteries, do not raise the dilemma. Since they interpose</b> at <b>night, they also interpose</b> during the <b>day.</b> Rather, <b>when you raise the dilemma,</b> do so <b>according to the one who says</b> that <b>night is</b> an appropriate <b>time</b> to don <b>phylacteries.</b> According to this opinion, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Does a mitzva</b> that one fulfills <b>with his body interpose, or does it not interpose?</b>

### Part 21
This <b>matter circulated and</b> eventually <b>came before Rabbi Ami,</b> who <b>said to him: It is a settled tradition in our possession</b> that <b>phylacteries interpose.</b>

### Part 22
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Priests in their service; and Levites on their platform</b> in the Temple, where they recite songs; <b>and Israelites at their watches,</b> where they observe the sacrifice of the daily offering, <b>are</b> all <b>exempt from prayer and from</b> donning <b>phylacteries. What, is it not</b> that the term: Exempt, indicates that <b>if they donned</b> phylacteries anyway, <b>they do not interpose?</b> Apparently, priests may wear phylacteries while performing the Temple service. The Gemara responds: <b>No, if they donned</b> phylacteries, <b>they interpose.</b>

### Part 23
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why does the <i>baraita</i> use the word: <b>Exempt? It should have</b> used the word: <b>Prohibited,</b> since wearing phylacteries disqualifies the priests’ service. The Gemara responds: <b>Since there are</b> also <b>Levites and Israelites</b> mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>concerning whom</b> the <i>baraita</i> could <b>not teach</b> the word: <b>Prohibited,</b> as it is permitted for them to don phylacteries, <b>due to that</b> reason the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> the word: <b>Exempt,</b> which is applicable to all.

### Part 24
The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> a priest <b>donned</b> phylacteries <b>they do not interpose?</b> The Gemara responds: That is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that phylacteries interpose is referring to the phylacteries <b>of the hand,</b> whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that they do not is referring to the phylacteries <b>of the head.</b>

### Part 25
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about the phylacteries <b>of the hand</b> that only they interpose? The verse indicates the difference, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the vestments covering the body: <b>“Shall he put upon his body”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), indicating <b>that nothing may interpose between</b> the vestment <b>and his body.</b> The Gemara challenges: But there is <b>also</b> a verse <b>written with regard to the head: “And you shall set the mitre upon his head”</b> (Exodus 29:6), indicating that there must be no interposition between the mitre and the head. If so, the phylacteries of the head should be considered an interposition as well.

### Part 26
The Gemara responds: The Sages <b>taught: The hair of</b> the High Priest <b>was visible between the frontplate and the mitre.</b> The frontplate was set on the forehead, below the hairline, while the mitre was set above it;
