and failure to perform even <b>one placement of their</b> blood <b>disqualifies</b> the offering. As for <b>the remainder of the blood</b> that is left after those sprinklings, a priest <b>would pour</b> it <b>onto the western base of the external altar, but if he did not pour</b> the remainder it does <b>not disqualify</b> the offering. <b>These,</b> the bull and the goat of Yom Kippur, <b>and those,</b> the bulls and the goats that are burned, <b>are</b> then <b>burned in the place of the ashes,</b> a place outside of Jerusalem where the priests would bring the ashes from the altar.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna opens with a principle that the slaughter of offerings of the most sacred order is in the north of the Temple courtyard. The Gemara inquires: <b>And let</b> the mishna <b>also teach</b> as a principle: <b>And the collection of their blood in a service vessel</b> is <b>in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard. Since collecting the blood is an indispensable part of the service, why is it not listed in this clause of the mishna? The Gemara explains: <b>Since there is</b> among the offerings of the most sacred order <b>the guilt offering of a leper,</b> for <b>which the collection of its blood is in the hand,</b> the mishna could not state this as a principle. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>omitted</b> this from the requirements for offerings of the most sacred order.

### Part 3
The Gemara challenges: <b>And</b> is the blood of the guilt offering of a leper <b>not</b> collected in a service vessel? <b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>later</b> (54b): With regard to <b>the guilt offering of a nazirite</b> brought for his purification <b>and the guilt offering of a leper</b> brought for his purification, <b>their slaughter</b> is <b>in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard <b>and collection of their blood in a service vessel</b> is <b>in the north.</b> Apparently, the <i>tanna</i> maintains that the blood of the guilt offering of a leper must be collected in a service vessel.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>Initially,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>held</b> that since <b>collection of the blood of</b> the guilt offering of a leper must also be <b>in the</b> priest’s <b>hand,</b> not exclusively in a service vessel, <b>he omitted it. But since</b> it is the case <b>that it is possible for</b> one to collect some of the blood <b>only in</b> a service <b>vessel,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>subsequently taught it.</b>

### Part 5
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Nega’im</i> 9:2): The Torah states with regard to the guilt offering of a leper: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall take</b> of the blood of the guilt offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him who is to be purified, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the big toe of his right foot” (Leviticus 14:14). One <b>might</b> have thought that he should take it <b>in a vessel;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “And</b> the priest <b>shall put.” Just as putting</b> the blood on the ear, thumb, and big toe must be performed <b>with the priest’s own</b> body, <b>so too, taking</b> of the blood is performed <b>with the priest’s own</b> body, not with a service vessel.

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> with regard to the blood of the leper’s guilt offering that he presents <b>on the altar,</b> like the blood of other guilt offerings, it is <b>so,</b> that he collects the blood in his hand rather than with a vessel. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “For as the sin offering is, so is the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 14:13). This teaches that <b>just as a sin offering requires a vessel</b> for collection of its blood, <b>so too,</b> the blood of <b>a guilt offering requires a vessel</b> for collection of its blood. <b>You consequently say:</b> In the case of <b>a leper’s guilt offering, two priests collect its blood; one</b> collects the blood <b>by hand, and</b> the other <b>one</b> collects the blood <b>in a vessel. This</b> one, <b>who collected</b> the blood <b>in a vessel, comes to the altar</b> and sprinkles some of the blood on it. <b>And that</b> one, <b>who collected</b> the blood <b>by hand, comes to</b> the <b>leper</b> and places some of the blood on his right ear, right thumb, and right big toe.
