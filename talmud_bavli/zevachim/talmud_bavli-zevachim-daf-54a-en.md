### Part 1
<b>“He covers it throughout the day,</b> and He dwells between his shoulders” (Deuteronomy 33:12). The term “covers it” is understood to mean that Benjamin is continually focused upon that site. <b>Therefore, Benjamin the righteous was privileged and became the host of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> as the Holy of Holies was built in his portion. <b>As it is stated: “And He dwells between his shoulders.”</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How</b> was the rite of <b>a bird burnt offering performed?</b> The priest ascended the ramp and turned to the surrounding ledge. When he arrived at the southeast corner, the priest <b>would pinch</b> the bird’s <b>head</b> by pinching <b>at</b> its <b>nape</b> with his thumbnail <b>and sever</b> the bird’s head from its body, <b>and</b> would <b>squeeze out its blood on the wall of the altar.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara states its objection: <b>And if you say</b> that the southeast corner of the altar <b>had no base, is he merely performing</b> the rite <b>in the air,</b> i.e., not within the domain of the altar? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Say</b> that when Eretz Yisrael was apportioned, they <b>made this condition: The airspace</b> of what would become the southeast part of the altar is in the portion of the tribe <b>of Benjamin,</b> so the pinching of the bird offering was performed within the domain of the altar. But the <b>land</b> was in the portion of the tribe <b>of Judah.</b>

### Part 4
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it states that the southeast corner of the altar <b>had no base? Rav says:</b> It is <b>with regard to</b> the fact that it had no base <b>built</b> on those sides. <b>Levi says:</b> It is <b>with regard to</b> the fact that no <b>blood</b> was sprinkled on that side, as the blood was not permitted to be presented there, even though there was a physical base. Based on this dispute, each of them disagreed as to the correct Aramaic translation of the verse: “Benjamin is a wolf that tears apart; in the morning he devours the prey, and in the evening he divides the spoil” (Genesis 49:27). <b>Rav translates</b> this as: <b>In his portion will the altar be built. Levi translates</b> this as: <b>In his portion will the Sanctuary be built,</b> which means: <b>A place sanctified for blood.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara brings proof for each opinion: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for the explanation of Rav from a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 35b): <b>The base</b> of the altar <b>would extend along all of the northern</b> side <b>and along all of the western</b> side. It <b>consumed one cubit on the southern</b> side <b>and one cubit on the eastern</b> side. This indicates that there was no base on most of the southern or eastern sides of the altar. The Gemara comments: Levi would explain: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>Consume?</b> The <i>baraita</i>, <b>as well,</b> is stated <b>with regard to</b> consuming <b>blood</b> of the offerings.

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for the explanation of Levi from that same mishna: <b>The altar was thirty-two</b> cubits <b>by thirty-two</b> cubits. This indicates that there was a base on all four sides, in accordance with the opinion of Levi. Rav could answer: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> the measurement <b>from the side.</b> In other words, only the northern and western sides were thirty-two cubits in length.

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for the explanation of Levi from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It turns out</b> the top of the ramp of the altar would <b>overhang</b> one <b>cubit</b> in the air <b>over</b> the <b>base</b> of the altar <b>and</b> one <b>cubit over</b> the <b>surrounding ledge.</b> This indicates that it had a base on all four sides, as the ramp was on the southern side. Rav could answer: <b>Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means it would overhang <b>toward</b> the place where the <b>base</b> of a <b>cubit</b> would have been, <b>and</b> one <b>cubit over</b> the <b>surrounding ledge.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as Levi teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How does one build the altar?</b> He <b>brings a square</b> wooden frame, <b>which is thirty-two</b> cubits <b>by thirty-two</b> cubits, <b>and its height is one cubit. And he brings pieces of damp [<i>mefulamot</i>] stone, both large and small,</b> which are the main components of the altar, which is described as: “An altar of stone” (Exodus 20:22). <b>And he brings plaster and molten lead and tar, and melts</b> them <b>and pours</b> the mixture into the gaps between the stones. <b>And this is the place of</b> the <b>base</b> of the altar.

### Part 9
<b>And then he brings a square</b> wooden frame, <b>which is thirty cubits by thirty cubits, and its height is five cubits. And he brings pieces of</b> damp <b>stone,</b> both large and small. And he brings plaster and molten lead and tar, and melts them and pours the mixture into the gaps between the stones. <b>And then he brings a square</b> wooden frame, <b>which is twenty-eight</b> cubits <b>by twenty-eight cubits, and its height is three cubits. And he brings pieces of</b> damp stone, both large and small. And he brings plaster and molten lead and tar, and melts them and pours the mixture into the gaps between the stones. <b>And this is the place of the arrangement</b> of wood on the altar.

### Part 10
<b>And then he brings a square</b> wooden frame, <b>which is</b> one <b>cubit by</b> one <b>cubit. And he brings pieces of damp stone, both large and small. And he brings plaster and molten lead and tar, and melts</b> them <b>and pours</b> the mixture into the frame. <b>And this is</b> the <b>corner</b> of the altar. <b>And so</b> he does this <b>for each and every corner.</b> This <i>baraita</i> indicates that the altar had a base around all four sides.

### Part 11
The Gemara comments: <b>And if you would say</b>
