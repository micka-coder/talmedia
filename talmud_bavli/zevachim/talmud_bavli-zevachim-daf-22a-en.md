<b>or they cannot hold a quarter</b><i>-log</i> of water, <b>provided that they are service vessels.</b> Apparently, the Basin need not hold so much water.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Adda bar Aḥa says:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where one drills</b> a hole <b>in</b> the Basin and places a much smaller vessel at the hole as a conduit for the water. Even if that vessel is very small, the priest may sanctify his hands and feet from it, provided that there is enough water in the Basin for four priests.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t the Merciful One state</b> that the priests must wash their hands and feet <b>“from it,”</b> i.e., from the Basin and not from another vessel? The Gemara responds: The following verse repeats the phrase <b>“they should wash,” to include</b> any <b>service vessel.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> then it should be permitted for a priest to use <b>a non-sacred vessel as well. Abaye says: You cannot say</b> that a priest may sanctify his hands and feet from <b>a non-sacred vessel,</b> since the matter may be derived <b>by <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>the base of</b> the Basin: <b>And just as its base, which was anointed along with it</b> (see Exodus 40:11), <b>is</b> still <b>not</b> fit for a priest to <b>sanctify</b> his hands and feet with water from it, then with regard to <b>a non-sacred vessel, which was not anointed along with</b> the Basin, <b>is it not right that it is not</b> fit for a priest to <b>sanctify</b> his hands and feet with water from it?

### Part 5
The Gemara clarifies: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that water from <b>the base of</b> the Basin is unfit? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that water from <b>its base should be</b> fit for priests to <b>sanctify</b> their hands and feet <b>just as</b> water from <b>the Basin</b> itself is fit to <b>sanctify</b> their hands and feet. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall also make a Basin of copper, and the base thereof of copper”</b> (Exodus 30:18). The verse indicates that <b>I have equated</b> the base and the Basin only <b>with regard to</b> the requirement that they both be made of <b>copper, but not for another matter.</b> Rather, the base, unlike the Basin, is unfit for sanctification.

### Part 6
<b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, said to Ravina:</b> The <i>a fortiori</i> inference can be refuted: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about its base?</b> It is notable <b>in that its inside is not made for</b> use, as it is to be used only as a stand. Will <b>you say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is the same <b>for a non-sacred vessel,</b> concerning <b>which its inside is made for</b> use? <b>Rather,</b> one must say that the term <b>“from it”</b> serves <b>to exclude a non-sacred vessel.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> “from it” should exclude <b>a service vessel as well.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>But the Merciful One amplifies</b> the <i>halakha</i> with the term <b>“they should wash,”</b> to include a service vessel.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you to include a service vessel and exclude a non-sacred vessel, rather than the reverse? The Gemara responds: <b>This,</b> a service vessel, <b>requires anointing like</b> the Basin when the Tabernacle is raised (see Exodus, chapter 40), <b>and that,</b> a non-sacred vessel, <b>does not require anointing like</b> the Basin.

### Part 9
§ <b>Reish Lakish says: Any</b> liquid <b>that</b> may be used to <b>complete</b> the requisite measure of <b>water for a ritual bath may complete</b> the requisite measure of <b>water for</b> the <b>Basin.</b> But <b>it may not complete</b> the <b>quarter</b><i>-log</i> required for ritual washing of the hands.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: This statement means <b>to exclude what</b> as unfit for completing the requisite measure for ritual washing of the hands? <b>If we say</b> that it means <b>to exclude liquefied clay,</b> there is a difficulty, as <b>what is</b> this clay <b>like? If</b> it is such <b>that a cow can kneel and drink from it,</b> it is considered water and should be fit <b>even to</b> complete the measure of <b>a quarter</b><i>-log</i> for ritual washing of the hands. <b>And if a cow cannot kneel and drink from it, it should not even</b> be fit to <b>complete</b> the requisite measure for <b>a ritual bath.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rather,</b> say that it means <b>to exclude red gnats</b> that originate and grow in water. This, too, is difficult, as <b>even by themselves</b> they may constitute the entire measure of the ritual bath, not only to complete a deficient measure of water; <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> With regard to <b>anything that originates in the water, one may immerse in it,</b> since it is considered as though it were water. <b>And Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi says: One may immerse</b> even <b>in</b> liquefied <b>fish eye</b> of sufficient volume.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The statement of Reish Lakish means <b>to exclude</b> a case where <b>one added a <i>se’a</i> and removed a <i>se’a</i>, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 7:2): In the case of <b>a ritual bath that contains</b> the minimum measure of <b>exactly forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water, and <b>one added a <i>se’a</i></b> of liquid other than water, <b>and</b> then <b>removed a <i>se’a</i></b> of the mixture, the ritual bath remains <b>fit.</b> The added liquid is considered nullified in the forty <i>se’a</i> of water, so that when one <i>se’a</i> of the mixture is removed, there still remain the requisite forty <i>se’a</i> of fit water. <b>And Rav Yehuda bar Sheila says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>up to the greater part</b> of the measure of the ritual bath. Adding and removing such a liquid to the requisite measure for washing of the hands renders the water unfit.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Pappa says: If one drilled in</b> the wall of a ritual bath, and the sides of the hole can hold <b>a quarter</b><i>-log</i> of liquid, <b>one may immerse</b> small vessels such as <b>needles and hooks in</b> the hole, even though it constitutes a space separate from the ritual bath, <b>since</b> the fitness of the water in the hole <b>derives from the fitness of</b> the water in <b>the ritual bath.</b> This <i>halakha</i> is parallel to the one discussed with regard to the Basin.

### Part 14
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says: Water of a ritual bath is fit to</b> be used as <b>water of</b> the <b>Basin.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> the water in the Basin <b>does not</b> need to be <b>flowing water,</b> i.e., spring water? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse indicates that the innards of an offering must be washed: <b>“With water”</b> (Leviticus 1:9), <b>and not with wine; “with water,” and not with</b> wine <b>mixed</b> with water; <b>“with water,” to include other</b> types of <b>water,</b> even those that are not spring water. <b>And</b> it can be inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that <b>the water</b> used <b>for</b> the <b>Basin</b> may be used to wash the innards. <b>What</b> is the basis of the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that <b>the water</b> used <b>for the Basin</b> may also be used? Is it <b>not that it is</b> from a source of <b>flowing water</b> and therefore obviously fit for washing the innards?

### Part 16
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the <i>a fortiori</i> inference is based on the fact <b>that</b> the water used for the Basin is <b>sanctified</b> for the service. The Gemara asks: <b>But is sanctified</b> water <b>preferable,</b> given that the Torah stipulates simply “water”? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Shmuel teach:</b> The word <b>“water”</b> used in the verse denotes specifically water <b>whose</b> name <b>has no modifier;</b>
