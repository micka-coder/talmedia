### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>both fit sacrificial</b> animals, <b>and unfit sacrificial</b> animals <b>whose disqualification occurred in sanctity,</b> i.e., in the course of the Temple service, <b>and one sacrificed them outside</b> the Temple courtyard, he is <b>liable.</b>

### Part 2
<b>One who offers up outside</b> the courtyard <b>an olive-bulk</b> made up <b>of</b> the flesh of <b>a burnt offering and of</b> its <b>sacrificial portions</b> is <b>liable.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to offering up outside the courtyard: <b>“That offers up a burnt offering or sacrifice,</b> and he will not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, to sacrifice it to the Lord” (Leviticus 17:8–9). From the term “burnt offering” <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable for offering up <b>a burnt offering,</b> which is burned entirely on the altar. <b>From where</b> do I derive <b>to include</b> that one is liable for offering up outside the courtyard <b>the sacrificial portions of a guilt offering, the sacrificial portions of a sin offering, the sacrificial portions of offerings of the most sacred order, or the sacrificial portions of offerings of lesser sanctity? The verse states: “Sacrifice,”</b> which includes the sacrificial portions of all other offerings that are to be burned on the altar.

### Part 4
<b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> that one is liable for offering up outside the courtyard <b>the handful</b> taken from a meal offering; <b>the frankincense</b> that was to be offered with it; <b>the incense,</b> which was offered each day in the Sanctuary; <b>the meal offering of priests; the meal offering of the anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, which he offered daily; <b>and</b> to include as liable <b>one who pours as a libation three <i>log</i> of wine,</b> which is the volume of the smallest wine libation used in the Temple; <b>or</b> one who pours as a libation <b>three <i>log</i> of water</b> that was consecrated to be used as a libation during the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>? <b>The verse states: “And he will not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 17:9), which indicates that with regard to <b>any</b> offering that is fit to be <b>brought to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting</b> to be offered there upon the altar, one is <b>liable for</b> offering it up <b>outside</b> the courtyard.

### Part 5
<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable for offering up <b>fit offerings; from where</b> do I derive <b>to</b> also <b>include</b> liability for <b>unfit</b> offerings whose disqualification occurred in sanctity?

### Part 6
<b>For example:</b> Sacrificial meat <b>that was left overnight, or</b> an offering <b>that went outside</b> the courtyard, <b>or</b> an offering <b>that</b> is <b>impure, or</b> an offering <b>that was slaughtered</b> with intent to consume it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time or outside its</b> designated <b>area, or</b> an offering <b>that an unfit</b> person <b>collected and sprinkled its blood, or</b> if <b>one placed</b> the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed above</b> the red line encircling the altar <b>below</b> it, <b>or</b> if <b>one placed</b> the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed below</b> the red line <b>above</b> it, <b>or</b> if <b>one placed</b> the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>outside</b> on the external altar, <b>or</b> if <b>one placed</b> the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed outside</b> the Sanctuary <b>inside</b> it, <b>or a Paschal offering or sin offering whose</b> blood <b>was placed not for their sake?</b>

### Part 7
Since the disqualification of these offerings occurred in sanctity, if they were to be, albeit unlawfully, placed upon the altar, the altar would render them acceptable such that they should not be removed from upon it. <b>From where</b> is it derived to also include liability for these unfit offerings? <b>The verse states:</b> “And <b>he will not bring it</b> to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, <b>to sacrifice</b> it to the Lord,” which indicates that with regard to <b>any</b> item <b>that is</b> rendered <b>acceptable</b> upon the altar <b>at</b> the <b>entrance of the Tent of Meeting,</b> even if it should not have been brought there <i>ab initio</i>, one is <b>liable for</b> offering <b>it</b> up <b>outside</b> the courtyard.

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One who offers up outside</b> the courtyard <b>an olive-bulk</b> made up <b>of</b> the flesh of <b>a burnt offering</b> and of its sacrificial portions is liable. The Gemara infers: The mishna states that for an olive-bulk combined of the flesh of <b>a burnt offering and</b> of <b>its sacrificial portions, yes,</b> one is liable. By inference, for an olive-bulk combined of the meat of <b>a peace offering and</b> of <b>its sacrificial portions,</b> one is <b>not</b> liable, because its meat is eaten, not burned on the altar.

### Part 9
<b>We learn</b> in the mishna <b>that which the Sages taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Me’ila</i> 1:28): The flesh of <b>a burnt offering and its sacrificial portions combine to</b> form the minimum measure, of <b>an olive-bulk,</b> to render one liable <b>for offering them up outside</b> the courtyard, <b>and to render</b> one <b>liable for</b> eating <b>them due to <i>piggul</i>,</b> i.e., if the sacrificial rites were performed with the intent of sacrificing the offering after its designated time; <b><i>notar</i>,</b> i.e., if its flesh remained after the period in which it was permitted to sacrifice it; <b>or</b> for eating them while he was <b>ritually impure.</b> This <i>baraita</i>, too, states that only the flesh and sacrificial portions of a burnt offering combine. This indicates that the meat and sacrificial portions of a peace offering do not combine.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>offering up</b> outside the courtyard, it is logical that for <b>a burnt offering, which is</b> entirely <b>consumed</b> upon the altar, that <b>yes,</b> everything will combine, and that for <b>peace offerings,</b> whose meat is not burned on the altar, the meat and sacrificial portions will <b>not</b> combine. <b>But</b> with regard to liability for <b><i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, and</b> eating while <b>ritually impure, what is the reason</b> that the <i>baraita</i> differentiates between a burnt offering and a peace offering?

### Part 11
The Gemara compounds its questions: <b>And didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 15a): <b>Anything that is <i>piggul</i> combines</b> together, <b>and anything that is <i>notar</i> combines</b> together, to form the measure of an olive-bulk to render one liable? The mishna indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies to all types of offerings. Accordingly, the Gemara notes: The ruling about <b><i>piggul</i></b> in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>difficult,</b> as it is contradicted <b>by</b> the ruling about <b><i>piggul</i></b> in the mishna, and the ruling about <b><i>notar</i></b> in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>difficult,</b> as it is contradicted <b>by</b> the ruling about <b><i>notar</i></b> in the mishna.

### Part 12
The Gemara resolves the difficulties: That the ruling about <b><i>piggul</i></b> in the <i>baraita</i> is contradicted <b>by</b> the ruling about <b><i>piggul</i></b> in the mishna is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the mishna, the ruling that they combine <b>concerns</b> liability for eating <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, the ruling that only the parts of a burnt offering combine <b>concerns <i>piggul</i> intention.</b> An offering is rendered <i>piggul</i> only if one intends to eat an olive-bulk of it after the designated time for eating it or to sacrifice an olive-bulk of it after the designated time for sacrificing it. The <i>baraita</i> rules that for a burnt offering, if one has such intention for both half an olive-bulk of its meat and half an olive-bulk of its sacrificial portions, that is sufficient for the entire offering to be rendered <i>piggul</i>. For a peace offering, the offering is rendered <i>piggul</i> only if one has such intention about an olive-bulk comprised only of meat or only of sacrificial portions.

### Part 13
The Gemara resolves the second difficulty: That the ruling about <b><i>notar</i></b> in the <i>baraita</i> is contradicted <b>by</b> the ruling about <b><i>notar</i></b> in the mishna is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the mishna, the ruling that they combine <b>concerns</b> liability for eating <b><i>notar</i>,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, the ruling that only the parts of a burnt offering combine <b>concerns</b> a case in <b>which</b> only an olive-bulk combined of both the flesh and the sacrificial portions <b>remained</b> from the offering, the rest having been destroyed, <b>before</b> its <b>blood was sprinkled.</b> Blood may not be sprinkled unless an olive-bulk of the offering remains. And if the blood is not sprinkled, the offering will never be rendered <i>notar</i>. The <i>baraita</i> rules that in the case of a burnt offering, the different parts of it combine to form an olive-bulk to permit the sprinkling of the blood. This does not apply to a peace offering, for which an olive-bulk of only meat or of only sacrificial portions must remain in order to permit the sprinkling of the blood.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>And whose</b> opinion is expressed by the <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> With regard to <b>all the offerings that</b> are mentioned <b>in the Torah from which there remains</b> only <b>an olive-bulk of meat,</b> the rest having been destroyed or rendered impure,
