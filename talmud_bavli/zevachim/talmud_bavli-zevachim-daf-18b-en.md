<b>soiled or ripped, and he performed</b> sacrificial <b>rites, his service is disqualified.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If the vestments are <b>dragging</b> on the ground, <b>they are fit,</b> but if they are <b>raised up</b> above the ground, <b>they are unfit.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the above <i>baraita</i> that even if the vestments were <b>raised up they are fit? Rami bar Ḥama says:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> deems them fit in a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>raised them up by</b> his <b>belt,</b> although they were initially the proper length; <b>there,</b> Shmuel deems them unfit in a case where <b>they do not initially</b> cover the priest’s feet <b>at all.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav says:</b> In <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case, whether they were dragging or raised up, <b>they are unfit.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rav Huna happened</b> to come <b>to Argiza. The son of his innkeeper [<i>oshpizekhaneih</i>] raised a contradiction</b> before <b>him: Did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say</b> that if the vestments are <b>dragging</b> on the ground, <b>they are fit, but</b> if they are <b>raised up</b> above the ground, <b>they are unfit? But isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that even if the vestments were <b>raised up they are fit?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him:</b> Raise a contradiction from any source <b>apart from this</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>as Rami bar Ḥama</b> already <b>answered</b> that <b>it</b> does not contradict Shmuel’s statement, as it applies only to vestments that were initially the proper length.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> doesn’t the <i>baraita</i> pose <b>a difficulty for Rav,</b> who deems the vestments unfit even if they were dragging? <b>And if you would say: What</b> is the meaning of the word: <b>Dragging,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>? It means that they would initially drag but were <b>raised up by a belt</b> to the proper length, <b>and</b> they are fit since the <b>belt</b> effectively <b>trims</b> them, <b>but</b> then the term: <b>Raised up,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> poses <b>a difficulty.</b> Why should the <i>baraita</i> deem raised vestments fit? If the <i>baraita</i> is referring to vestments that were initially the proper length and were then raised up by a belt, then shouldn’t they be unfit as the belt trims them?

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Zeira says: Rav taught</b> the <i>baraita</i> not as referring separately to both dragging and raised vestments, but as <b>one</b> statement referring to vestments that are simultaneously dragging and raised, i.e., <b>dragging</b> vestments <b>that</b> the priest <b>raised up by</b> his <b>belt</b> to the proper height <b>are fit.</b> But if they were above or below their proper height for any reason, they are unfit.

### Part 7
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti says:</b> The case of <b>dragging</b> vestments <b>that</b> the priest <b>did not raise is</b> the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“On the four corners of your garment”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), from which it can be inferred: <b>Four, but not three,</b> i.e., a three-cornered garment is exempt from the obligation of ritual fringes. One may ask: <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> specifying <b>four, but not five? When it says</b> in the same verse: <b>“With which you cover yourself,”</b> a garment <b>of five</b> corners <b>is mentioned</b> as obligated. If so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of: <b>“Four</b> corners”? It means <b>four, but not three. And what did you see</b> that led you <b>to include</b> a garment <b>of five</b> corners <b>and to exclude</b> a garment <b>of three</b> corners? <b>I include</b> a garment <b>of five</b> corners <b>as four is included in five, and I exclude</b> a garment <b>of three</b> corners <b>as four is not included in three.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“On the four corners of your garment,”</b> from which it may be inferred: <b>Four, but not three,</b> and also <b>four, but not five,</b> i.e., only a four-cornered garment is obligated in the mitzva of ritual fringes. Rabbi Yirmeya continues: <b>What, is it not</b> that these <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to this: That</b> one <b>Sage,</b> who deems a five-cornered garment exempt, <b>holds</b> that <b>an extra</b> item <b>is considered as though it exists</b> and cannot be ignored, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> who deems it obligated, <b>holds</b> that it <b>is considered as though it does not exist</b> and the garment has only four corners? Accordingly, the first Sage deems a dragging priestly vestment unfit, since one cannot ignore the extra fabric, while the second Sage deems it fit since the extra fabric is treated as immaterial.

### Part 9
The Gemara responds: <b>No, everyone</b> agrees that an extra piece of a garment <b>is considered as though it exists,</b> and therefore dragging vestments are unfit. <b>And</b> according to the <i>tanna</i> of the second <i>baraita</i>, it <b>is different here,</b> with regard to ritual fringes, <b>as the Merciful One amplifies</b> the <i>halakha</i> to obligate even five-cornered garments with the words <b>“with which you cover yourself.”</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> Sage, who deems five-cornered garments exempt, <b>what does he do with this</b> verse: <b>“With which you cover yourself”?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>He requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And it shall be unto you for a fringe, <b>that you may look upon it”</b> (Numbers 15:39). The phrase: “That you may look upon it,” serves to <b>exclude a night garment</b> from the obligation of ritual fringes, as the fringes on such a garment cannot be seen. One might ask: <b>Or is it only</b> to <b>exclude the garment of a blind person,</b> who is unable to see the ritual fringes? <b>When it states</b> in the verse: <b>“With which you cover yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), the obligation of ritual fringes for <b>the garment of a blind person is mentioned.</b> If so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“That you may look upon it”?</b> It serves to <b>exclude a night garment.</b>

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you <b>to include the garment of a blind person and to exclude a night garment</b> and not the reverse? <b>I include the garment of a blind person because it is</b> at least <b>visible to others, and I exclude a night garment because it is not visible,</b> even <b>to others.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> Sage, who derives that a five-cornered garment requires ritual fringes from the phrase: “With which you cover yourself,” from where does he derive that the garment of a blind person requires ritual fringes? The Gemara responds: <b>He derives it from</b> the word <b>“which”</b> in the phrase, as that term itself connotes an amplification of the <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>the other</b> Sage do with this word? The Gemara responds: <b>He does not interpret</b> the word <b>“which”</b> as an amplification.

### Part 13
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the priestly vestments that the term: “Linen [<i>bad</i> ]” (Leviticus 6:3), used in the verse indicates several properties of the garments: The verse states <b>“linen”</b> to indicate <b>that they</b> must <b>be</b> made <b>of fine linen [<i>butz</i>]; “linen,” that they</b> must <b>be new; “linen,” that</b> their thread must <b>be twisted</b> of several plies; <b>“linen,” that their thread</b> must <b>be folded six</b> times; <b>“linen,” that</b> the priest may <b>not wear non-sacred</b> clothes along <b>with them.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Granted,</b> the statement <b>that they</b> must <b>be of fine linen</b> is understood; <b>this</b> requirement <b>teaches us</b> that if they are of <b>fine linen</b> they <b>are</b> fit, but if they are of <b>something else</b> they are <b>not. But</b> with regard to the statement: <b>Linen, that they</b> must <b>be new,</b> one can infer that if they are <b>new</b> they <b>are</b> fit but if they are <b>frayed</b> they are <b>not. But isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> (18a) that even if they were <b>frayed</b> they <b>are fit?</b>

### Part 15
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: And according to your reasoning</b> that the <i>baraita</i> intends to derive all of these requirements from the word linen, such that all of these requirements are indispensable, how can one understand the requirement: <b>Linen, that their thread</b> must <b>be folded six</b> times? The word <b><i>bad</i></b> itself <b>means each one on its own</b> (see Exodus 30:34). <b>Rather, this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> Those <b>garments with regard to which it is stated: Linen, must be</b> made <b>of fine linen,</b> and they must be <b>new</b> and <b>twisted,</b> and <b>their thread</b> must <b>be folded six</b> times. <b>Some of</b> these requirements constitute <b>a mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i>, and <b>some of them are indispensable.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that this</b> material <b><i>bad</i> is</b> produced from the <b>flax</b> plant? <b>Rabbi Yosef, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> The verse is referring to <b>an item that grows from the ground</b> with <b>each</b> stalk growing <b>on its own [<i>bad bevad</i>],</b> i.e., it does not split into multiple stalks. The flax plant fulfills this criterion.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: Why not <b>say</b> that it is <b>wool?</b> The Gemara responds: The individual <b>wool</b> fibers <b>split</b> into smaller fibers. The Gemara rejects this: But <b>flax also splits.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>It splits</b> only <b>by being struck.</b> Wool, by contrast, splits naturally.

### Part 18
<b>Ravina says</b> that the identity of <i>bad</i> is derived <b>from here:</b> The verse states with regard to the priestly vestments: <b>“They shall have linen [<i>pishtim</i>] crowns upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with <i>yaza</i>”</b> (Ezekiel 44:18). The word <i>pishtim</i> is clearly referring to flax.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Ashi said to Ravina: But before Ezekiel came, from where did we</b> derive the identity of <i>bad</i>? Ravina responded: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> one could ask the same of <b>that which Rav Ḥisda said</b> with regard to the prohibition against Temple service by one who is uncircumcised or an apostate: <b>We did not learn this</b> following <b>matter from the Torah of Moses, our teacher; we learned</b> it <b>from the words of Ezekiel, son of Buzi: “No stranger, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into My Sanctuary to serve Me”</b> (Ezekiel 44:9). <b>Until Ezekiel came, from where did we</b> derive this? <b>Rather,</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is learned as a tradition</b> and therefore was observed for generations, <b>and Ezekiel came and gave it support by</b> writing <b>a verse. Here too, it is learned as a tradition,</b> and Ezekiel came and gave it support by writing a verse.

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase in the verse: <b>“They shall not gird themselves with <i>yaza</i>”? Abaye said: They shall not gird themselves in a place</b> in <b>which</b> people <b>sweat [<i>mezi’in</i>]. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When they gird</b> themselves with the belt, <b>they may not gird</b> themselves <b>below their loins nor above their elbows,</b> but <b>rather</b>
