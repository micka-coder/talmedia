### Part 1
The Gemara replies that Rahab used this phrase euphemistically, to say that their fear was so great <b>that</b> their male organs <b>were not even</b> able to <b>become erect,</b> as “<i>kama</i>” also means rise. The Gemara asks: <b>And how did</b> Rahab <b>know</b> this? The Gemara replies: <b>As the Master said: You do not have any prince or ruler</b> at that time <b>who did not engage in intercourse with Rahab the prostitute.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara adds that the Sages <b>said</b> with regard to Rahab: <b>She was ten years old when the Jewish people left Egypt, and she engaged in prostitution all forty years that the Jewish people were in the wilderness. After</b> that, when she was <b>fifty years</b> old, she <b>converted</b> when the two spies visited her. <b>She said: May</b> all of my sins of prostitution <b>be forgiven me as a reward</b> for having endangered myself with the <b>rope, window, and flax,</b> by means of which I saved Joshua’s two spies. Rahab first concealed the spies in stalks of flax, and later assisted them in exiting her home by lowering them from the window with a rope (see Joshua 2:6 and 2:15).

### Part 3
§ <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that discussed the sacrifice of offerings before the construction of the Tabernacle: <b>And today gentiles are permitted to do so,</b> i.e., to sacrifice offerings outside the Temple courtyard, despite the fact that this is forbidden for the Jews. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> with regard to the verses that prohibit the slaughter of offerings outside the Temple: <b>“Speak</b> to Aaron, and to his sons, and <b>to</b> all <b>the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 17:2). This indicates that only <b>Jews are commanded with regard to</b> offerings <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Temple, <b>but gentiles are not commanded with regard to</b> offerings <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Temple.

### Part 4
<b>Therefore, each and every</b> gentile may, if he desires, <b>construct</b> a private <b>altar for himself, and sacrifice upon it whatever he desires. Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says:</b> Although it is permitted for gentiles to sacrifice offerings outside the Temple courtyard, it is <b>prohibited</b> for a Jew <b>to assist them or to fulfill their agency</b> in this matter, as sacrificing in this manner is forbidden for a Jew. <b>Rabba said: But to instruct them</b> how to sacrifice outside the Temple is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 5
This is <b>similar to that</b> incident in <b>which Ifera Hurmiz, the mother of King Shapur</b> of Persia, <b>sent an offering to Rava,</b> with which <b>she sent</b> this message <b>to him: Sacrifice this for me, for the sake of Heaven.</b> Rava <b>said to Rav Safra and to Rav Aḥa bar Huna: Go, take two</b> gentile <b>youths of the same age,</b> i.e., similar to one another, so that the sacrifice will be performed with maximal beauty, <b>and see where the sea</b> currently <b>raises silt [<i>sirton</i>],</b> which is a place that no one has used before. <b>And take new wood and bring out fire from new vessels, and</b> the two youths will <b>sacrifice</b> the offering <b>for her, for the sake of Heaven.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion was the instruction to sacrifice exclusively with new wood? Was it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua says: Just as</b> the <b>altar</b> is a place <b>that is not used by an ordinary</b> person, <b>so too,</b> the <b>wood</b> that will be used <b>must not be used by an ordinary</b> person. The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua concede</b> that <b>in</b> the case of a private <b>altar</b> the wood need not be new?

### Part 7
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to David’s purchase of the site of the Temple, when he wished to build an altar there at God’s instruction, <b>one verse states: “So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</b> And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings” (I Chronicles 21:25–26). <b>And it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</b> And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings” (II Samuel 24:24–25). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled?

### Part 8
David would <b>collect from each tribe</b> of the twelve tribes <b>fifty</b> shekels, <b>which are</b> a sum of <b>six hundred</b> shekels. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says in the name of Abba Yosei ben Dostai</b> that there is another explanation: David purchased the <b>cattle and</b> the <b>wood and the site of</b> the <b>altar for fifty</b> shekels, <b>and</b> he purchased the site of <b>the entire Temple for six hundred</b> shekels.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua says</b> likewise: David purchased the <b>cattle and</b> the <b>wood and the site of</b> the <b>altar for fifty</b> shekels, <b>and</b> the site of <b>the entire Temple for six hundred</b> shekels, <b>as it is written: “And Araunah said to David: Let my lord the king take and offer that which is good in his eyes; see the cattle for the burnt offering, and the threshing tools, and the implements of the cattle for the wood”</b> (II Samuel 24:22), to which David replied: “No, but I will buy it from you at a price” (II Samuel 24:24). Consequently, according to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua, David purchased the threshing instruments and the furniture of the oxen for use as wood. <b>And Rava</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response: <b>There too,</b> in the case of David, the verse is dealing <b>with new</b> vessels that had not yet been used.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> are <b>“the threshing instruments [<i>morigim</i>]”</b> mentioned in the verse? <b>Ulla said:</b> It is <b>a <i>turbal</i> bed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>a <i>turbal</i> bed? Abaye said:</b> It is <b>a heavy, serrated board [<i>dekurkesa</i>],</b> used <b>for threshing. Abaye said: What is the verse</b> from which the meaning of <i>morigim</i> is derived? <b>“Behold, I have made you a new threshing board [<i>morag</i>] having sharp teeth; you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff”</b> (Isaiah 41:15). This verse indicates that a <i>morag</i> has grooves and teeth, and is used for threshing.

### Part 11
With regard to the contradiction between the verses that relate the sum of shekels paid by David, the Gemara says that <b>Rava</b> was <b>teaching</b> these verses <b>to his son, and raised a contradiction between verses: It is written: “So David gave to Ornan…</b>six hundred shekels of gold by weight” (I Chronicles 21:25), <b>and it is written: “So David bought…</b>fifty shekels of silver” (II Samuel 24:24). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? David would <b>collect from each tribe</b> of the twelve tribes <b>fifty</b> shekels, <b>which are</b> a sum of <b>six hundred</b> shekels.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> these verses <b>are still difficult,</b> as they contradict <b>one another,</b> since <b>there</b> in the book of Samuel it is stated that David paid <b>silver</b> shekels, while <b>here</b> in Chronicles it is stated that he paid <b>gold</b> shekels. The Gemara replies: <b>Rather, this</b> is what the verses are <b>saying:</b> David would <b>collect</b> from each tribe <b>silver</b> shekels that had the value of fifty gold shekels in weight, so that the value of the final sum was equal to <b>six hundred gold</b> shekels.

### Part 13
§ The mishna teaches that once the Tabernacle was established in the wilderness, <b>offerings of lesser sanctity</b> were <b>eaten throughout the camp of Israel. Rav Huna says:</b> This means that offerings of lesser sanctity were eaten <b>in any</b> of the <b>places</b> that <b>an Israelite</b> would be found. <b>But there was no</b> actual <b>camp,</b> outside of which it was prohibited to eat the offerings.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Naḥman raised an objection to Rav Huna: And were there not camps</b> when the Jews were <b>in the wilderness? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (see <i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Kelim Bava Kamma</i> 1:12): <b>Just as</b> there was <b>a camp in the wilderness</b> that was divided into different sections, with each section having particular <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to the consumption of offerings and to the ritually impure individuals who were prohibited from entering there, <b>so too,</b> there is a corresponding <b>camp in Jerusalem:</b> The area <b>from</b> the walls of <b>Jerusalem to the Temple Mount</b> has the status of <b>the Israelite camp.</b> The area <b>from the Temple Mount to Nicanor’s Gate</b> at the entrance to the Temple courtyard has the status of <b>the Levite camp.</b>

### Part 15
<b>From that</b> point <b>onward,</b> i.e., from the entrance to the Temple courtyard, the area has the status of <b>the camp of the Divine Presence; and</b> the Temple courtyard has the same status as the area within <b>the curtains</b> surrounding the courtyard of the Tabernacle <b>in the wilderness.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara replies: <b>Rather, say</b> that Rav Huna meant that when the Tabernacle was in the wilderness, offerings of lesser sanctity could be consumed <b>wherever the Israelite camp</b> was located. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> Wherever the Jews were located in the wilderness was where the Israelite camp was. The Gemara responds: <b>Lest you say</b> that during the periods of travel between encampments the offerings were taken outside the Israelite camp, and <b>were</b> thereby <b>disqualified due to</b> the meat’s <b>leaving</b> the area within the partitions, Rav Huna <b>teaches us</b> that the meat is not disqualified.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that this is <b>indeed so,</b> i.e., that the meat is disqualified because it left the camp? The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “Then the Tent of Meeting,</b> with the camp of the Levites, <b>shall travel</b> in the midst of the camps; as they encamp, so shall they travel” (Numbers 2:17), which indicates that <b>although it traveled</b> from its place <b>it is</b> still <b>the Tent of Meeting.</b> Similarly, the Israelite camp retains its status even while traveling.

### Part 18
§ With regard to the division of Jerusalem into three camps, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: There was an additional</b> camp in Jerusalem, within the area of the Temple Mount, <b>and it</b> was <b>the rampart of the women’s courtyard.</b> The Sages rendered it prohibited for certain ritually impure individuals to enter that area, <b>but they would not punish</b> them <b>for</b> entering <b>it,</b> as by Torah law it does not constitute a distinct section of the Temple Mount but has the status of the Levite camp. The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And</b> when the Tabernacle was <b>in Shiloh there were only two camps.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>Which of</b> the three camps that were present in the wilderness <b>was not</b> present in Shiloh? <b>Rabba said: It stands to reason that the Levite camp was</b> present, but the Israelite camp was not. <b>As, if it enters your mind to say</b> that <b>the Levite camp was not</b> present in Shiloh,
