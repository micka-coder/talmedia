### Part 1
<b>according to his eating,</b> you shall make your count for the lamb” (Exodus 12:4)? This teaches that one may bring the Paschal offering only if he is able to partake of it. The Gemara responds: This requirement is also meant <b>as a mitzva</b> <i>ab initio</i>; it does not disqualify the offering if not fulfilled.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is this requirement <b>not indispensable</b> even after the fact? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the phrase <b>“according to the number of the souls” teaches that the Paschal offering may be slaughtered only for those who registered for it</b> in advance. If the Paschal offering was <b>slaughtered for</b> individuals <b>who did not register for it,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>it would</b> only <b>be like transgressing a mitzva,</b> but the offering would not be disqualified. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall make your count”; the verse repeats</b> the issue of counting <b>to</b> stress that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>indispensable,</b> and if one slaughters the offering for one who is not registered, it is disqualified. The Gemara concludes: <b>And those who eat</b> the offering <b>are juxtaposed to those registered</b> for it, as the verse states: “According to the number of the souls; a man, according to his eating.” Accordingly, if one slaughters the Paschal offering for one who cannot partake of it, the offering is disqualified.

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: <b>The Elders of the South do not juxtapose</b> the phrases, i.e., they do not interpret the verse’s juxtaposition of the two phrases as significant. The Gemara asks: <b>But even if they do not juxtapose</b> the phrases, <b>there is a refutation to</b> their statement <b>from this</b> inference <b>as well: And just as in a case where the owner became impure due to a creeping animal, where he may send his offerings</b> for sacrifice <b><i>ab initio</i>, a priest who became impure due to a creeping animal</b> nevertheless <b>cannot effect acceptance,</b> then in <b>a case where the owner became impure due to a corpse, where he may not send his offerings <i>ab initio</i>, is it not right that a priest who became impure due to a corpse cannot effect acceptance?</b>

### Part 4
Furthermore, the Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 80b): <b>As</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that with regard to <b>a nazirite and one who performs</b> the rite of the <b>Paschal offering, the frontplate effects acceptance for</b> offerings sacrificed in a state of <b>impurity of</b> the <b>blood, but the frontplate does not effect acceptance for</b> offerings sacrificed in a state of <b>impurity of the body</b> of the individual bringing it.

### Part 5
The Gemara continues: <b>To what</b> impurity is it referring? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring <b>to impurity due to a creeping animal, didn’t you say</b> above that according to the Elders of the South, <b>one may slaughter</b> the Paschal offering <b>and sprinkle</b> its blood <b>for</b> an owner who is in a state of <b>impurity due to a creeping animal? Rather,</b> it must be referring to <b>impurity due to a corpse, and</b> the mishna <b>teaches: The frontplate does not effect acceptance. Evidently,</b> if the <b>owner became impure due to a corpse, he may not send his offerings</b> for sacrifice, contrary to the opinion ascribed to the Elders of the South.

### Part 6
The Gemara responds: <b>No, if the owner became impure due to a corpse,</b> the frontplate <b>indeed</b> effects acceptance for the offering. The mishna is not referring to the owners of the offerings at all; rather, <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the officiating <b>priest became impure due to a creeping animal.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If it became known after the offering was brought that he had <b>contracted ritual impurity</b> imparted <b>in the depths,</b> i.e., a source of impurity that had been unknown at the time, <b>the frontplate effects acceptance</b> for the offering. This clause cannot be reconciled with the suggested interpretation of the mishna, since <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches: They stated</b> this <i>halakha</i> of <b>impurity</b> imparted <b>in the depths only with regard to</b> impurity due to <b>a corpse.</b> Now, when he says that it applies only <b>to</b> impurity due to <b>a corpse,</b> he means <b>to exclude what?</b> Does he <b>not</b> mean <b>to exclude impurity</b> imparted by the carcass of <b>a creeping animal in the depths?</b> If so, the mishna cannot be referring to impurity due to a creeping animal.

### Part 8
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya means <b>to exclude impurity</b> imparted <b>by</b> a gonorrhea-like <b>discharge [<i>ziva</i>] in the depths.</b> Impurity due to the corpse of a creeping animal, by contrast, is within the scope of the mishna.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> how is one to understand <b>this dilemma that Rami bar Ḥama raises:</b> With regard to <b>a priest who effects acceptance for the offerings of</b> the nazirite and the Paschal offering, <b>was impurity</b> imparted <b>in the depths permitted for him or was impurity</b> imparted <b>in the depths not permitted for him?</b> According to the Elders of the South, why not <b>resolve</b> the dilemma and conclude <b>that impurity</b> imparted <b>in the depths was permitted for him, since</b> they hold that <b>we interpret</b> the mishna <b>here</b> as referring <b>to</b> an impure <b>priest?</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara responds: The premise of this dilemma <b>of Rami bar Ḥama certainly disagrees</b> with the opinion of the Elders of the South, and Rami bar Ḥama does not interpret the mishna in this manner.

### Part 11
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a verse written about the frontplate: “And it shall be upon Aaron’s forehead, <b>and Aaron shall bear the sin committed with the sacred</b> items, which the children of Israel shall consecrate, even all their sacred gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before God” (Exodus 28:38). <b>And</b> the Sages expounded: <b>Which sin does</b> Aaron <b>bear?</b>
