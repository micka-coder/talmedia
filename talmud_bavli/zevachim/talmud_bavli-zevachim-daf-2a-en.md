### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All slaughtered offerings that were slaughtered not for their own sake,</b> i.e., during the slaughtering the slaughterer’s intent was to sacrifice a different offering, <b>are fit,</b> and one may continue their sacrificial rites and partake of their meat where that applies. <b>But</b> these offerings <b>did not satisfy the obligation of the owner,</b> who is therefore required to bring another offering. This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all offerings <b>except for the Paschal offering and the sin offering.</b> In those cases, if the owner sacrificed them not for their own sake, they are unfit. But there is a difference between the two exceptions. <b>The Paschal offering</b> is unfit only when sacrificed not for its sake <b>at its</b> appointed <b>time,</b> on the fourteenth day of Nisan after noon, while <b>the sin offering</b> is unfit <b>any time</b> that it is sacrificed not for its sake.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The guilt offering too</b> is unfit when sacrificed not for its sake. According to his opinion, the correct reading of the mishna is: <b>The Paschal offering</b> is unfit only <b>at its</b> appointed <b>time,</b> while <b>the sin offering and the guilt offering</b> are unfit <b>at all times. Rabbi Eliezer said</b> in explanation: <b>The sin offering is brought for</b> performance of <b>a transgression and the guilt offering is brought for</b> performance of <b>a transgression. Just as a sin offering is unfit</b> when sacrificed <b>not for its sake, so too, the guilt offering is unfit</b> when sacrificed <b>not for its sake.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Yosei ben Ḥoni says:</b> Not only are the Paschal offering and the sin offering unfit when slaughtered not for their sake, but also other offerings <b>that are slaughtered for the sake of a Paschal offering and for the sake of a sin offering are unfit.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Shimon, brother of Azarya, says</b> that this is the distinction: With regard to all offerings, if <b>one slaughtered them for the sake of</b> an offering whose level of sanctity is <b>greater than theirs, they are fit;</b> if one slaughtered them <b>for the sake of</b> an offering whose level of sanctity is <b>less than theirs, they are unfit.</b>

### Part 5
<b>How so? Offerings of the most sacred order,</b> e.g., sin offerings and burnt offerings, <b>that one slaughtered for the sake of offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> e.g., peace offerings, <b>are unfit. Offerings of lesser sanctity that one slaughtered for the sake of offerings of the most sacred order are fit.</b> Likewise, there is a distinction between different offerings of lesser sanctity. <b>The firstborn</b> animal <b>and the</b> animal <b>tithe that one slaughtered for the sake of a peace offering are fit,</b> as the sanctity of peace offerings is greater. <b>Peace offerings that one slaughtered for the sake of a firstborn</b> animal <b>or for the sake of</b> an animal <b>tithe are unfit.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: All slaughtered offerings that were slaughtered not for their sake are fit, but they did not satisfy the obligation of the owner. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> using the language: <b>But they did not [<i>ella shelo</i>] satisfy</b> the obligation of the owner? <b>Let it teach</b> simply: <b>And they did not [<i>velo</i>] satisfy the obligation of the owner.</b> What does the word: But [<i>ella</i>], add?

### Part 7
The Gemara responds: By adding <b>this</b> word, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the only deficiency with regard to these offerings <b>is that they did not satisfy the obligation of the owner, but they retain their sanctity, and it is</b> still <b>prohibited to deviate</b> from the protocol <b>of their</b> sacrificial process, i.e., the remaining rites must be performed with proper intent.

### Part 8
<b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rava, as Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a burnt offering that one slaughtered not for its sake,</b> it is still <b>prohibited to sprinkle its blood</b> on the altar <b>not for its sake.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara adds: <b>If you wish, propose a logical argument</b> to support this statement, and <b>if you wish, cite a verse</b> as proof. The Gemara elaborates: <b>If you wish, propose a logical argument:</b> Just <b>because</b> one <b>deviated</b> from protocol <b>in its</b> sacrifice once, i.e., in its slaughter, could it be that <b>he should continue to deviate</b> from protocol <b>in all</b> the rest of the sacrificial rites? One deviation does not justify additional deviations.

### Part 10
And <b>if you wish, cite a verse: “That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; according to what you have vowed [<i>nadarta</i>] freely [<i>nedava</i>] to the Lord your God,</b> even that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). The Gemara interprets the words <i>nadarta</i> and <i>nedava</i> exegetically: Can <b>this</b> verse be referring to <b>a gift</b> offering [<b><i>nedava</i></b>]?
