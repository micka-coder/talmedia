### Part 1
<b>He ascended the ramp</b> of the altar <b>and turned</b> right <b>to the surrounding ledge</b> and he continued east, <b>and he came to the southeast corner</b> and sprinkled the blood of the sin offering there and then to the <b>northeast</b> corner and sprinkled the blood there, and then to the <b>northwest</b> corner and sprinkled the blood there, and the <b>southwest</b> corner, where he performed the fourth sprinkling and descended from the altar. <b>He would pour the remainder of the blood on the southern base</b> of the altar. <b>And</b> the meat portions of the offering <b>are eaten within the curtains,</b> i.e., in the Temple courtyard, <b>by the males of the priesthood.</b> And they are eaten prepared <b>in any</b> form of <b>food</b> preparation, <b>on</b> the <b>day</b> the offering is sacrificed <b>and</b> during the <b>night</b> that follows, <b>until midnight.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>How does</b> the priest <b>perform</b> the rite of sprinkling the blood on the corners of the altar? There is a dispute between <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar. One says</b> that the priest <b>places</b> the blood within <b>a cubit on this</b> side <b>or a cubit on that</b> side. He places the blood wherever he wants, provided that it is within one cubit of the corner of the altar. <b>And one says</b> that <b>he sprinkles</b> the blood <b>on the</b> outer <b>edge of</b> the <b>corner</b> of the altar, <b>and</b> it flows <b>down</b> on both sides of the altar.

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that the sprinkling of the blood of a sin offering <b>itself is performed only on the actual corner,</b> the one-by-one-cubit projection above each corner of the altar, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the blood may be sprinkled anywhere on the corner, and this will be a fulfillment of the verse: “And put it upon the corners of the altar of burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:25). <b>When they disagree</b> is only <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that the blood may be sprinkled anywhere above the red line on the edge of the altar. One <b>Sage holds</b> that the blood may be sprinkled on the cubit on either side of the edge, because <b>a cubit on this</b> side <b>and a cubit on that</b> side <b>is</b> still considered to be <b>on</b> the <b>corner. And</b> one <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>on its edge, yes,</b> it is fit, but any <b>further</b> on either side is <b>not.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion that one cubit on either side of the edge is still considered on the edge, from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>communal sin offerings and individual</b> sin offerings, <b>how</b> is <b>the placement of their blood</b> on the altar performed? The priest <b>would ascend the ramp</b> of the altar <b>and turn</b> right <b>to the surrounding ledge</b> and he continued east, <b>and</b> he would <b>come to</b> the <b>southeast corner. And</b> he would then <b>dip with his right [<i>haymanit</i>] finger, the</b> most <b>dexterous [<i>hamyumenet</i>] of the right</b> hand, i.e., the index finger, <b>of the blood that is in the bowl, and</b> would <b>gather</b> the blood <b>with his thumb above and his smallest finger below,</b> so that it would remain on his finger. <b>And</b> he would <b>sprinkle</b> the blood <b>and</b> move his hand <b>down on the</b> outer <b>edge of</b> the <b>corner, until</b> he would <b>finish</b> sprinkling <b>all the blood that</b> was <b>on</b> his <b>finger. And</b> he would act <b>similarly</b> at <b>each and every corner.</b> This <i>baraita</i> states explicitly that the blood must be sprinkled on the actual edge.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> The optimal manner to perform the <b>mitzva</b> is to sprinkle the blood <b>on the edge of</b> the corner. But <b>if he did</b> the sprinkling on the <b>cubit on this</b> side, <b>or</b> the <b>cubit on that</b> side, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> and he has still fulfilled the mitzva.

### Part 6
The Gemara discusses the aforementioned dispute. <b>What</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and what</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon?</b> This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:11): The <b>blood</b> that must be placed on <b>the upper</b> half of the altar, e.g., the blood of a sin offering, <b>is placed</b> anywhere <b>from the red line</b> that circumscribed the middle of the altar <b>and above.</b> The <b>blood</b> that must be placed on <b>the lower</b> half of the altar <b>is placed</b> anywhere <b>from the red line or below it.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon says: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to a bird burnt offering,</b> as its blood may be placed anywhere above the red line. <b>But with regard to an animal sin offering,</b> the placement <b>itself may be performed only on the actual corner</b> of the altar. This is based on the verse that states: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the corners of the altar of burnt offering” (Leviticus 4:25).

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Abbahu says: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>As it is written: “And the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and above</b> there shall be four corners” (Ezekiel 43:15). The Gemara asks: <b>Was</b> the altar only <b>four cubits</b> wide? <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said: And</b> the total <b>area</b> of the four <b>corners,</b> which were each one square cubit, was <b>four</b> cubits. The Gemara asks: <b>Was the area of</b> the <b>corners four</b> square cubits? If the four corners would be placed together the area would be only two square cubits. <b>Rather, say</b> that the <b>domain</b> of the <b>corners</b> is <b>four</b> cubits. In other words, the verse means that the blood may be sprinkled up to four cubits beneath the actual corners of the altar.

### Part 9
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Middot</i> 35b): <b>A red line circumscribed</b> the altar <b>in the middle, to separate between</b> the area for the <b>blood</b> that must be placed on <b>the upper</b> part of the altar <b>and</b> the area for the <b>blood</b> that must be placed on <b>the lower</b> part of the altar. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Ketina said</b> it is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And you shall put it under the ledge round the altar beneath, <b>and the net will reach halfway up the altar”</b> (Exodus 27:5). <b>The Torah provided</b> for <b>a separation</b> on the altar, <b>to separate between</b> the area for the <b>blood</b> placed on <b>the upper</b> part of the altar <b>and</b> the area for the <b>blood</b> placed on <b>the lower</b> part of the altar.

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches: He would pour <b>the remainder of the blood</b> on the southern base of the altar. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Concerning the phrase: <b>“At the base of the altar”</b> (Leviticus 4:30), mentioned with regard to pouring the remainder of the blood of the sin offering of a king, <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>southern base</b> of the altar. The <i>baraita</i> challenges: <b>Do you say</b> that <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>southern base, or is it</b> referring <b>only</b> to the <b>western base?</b>

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> suggests: <b>And</b> one can <b>derive</b> the meaning of this <b>unspecified</b> phrase <b>from</b> the meaning of <b>the explicit</b> phrase, as follows: <b>You said</b> that one can <b>derive</b> the location of the priest’s <b>descent from the ramp</b> of the external altar after sprinkling blood of the sin offering by comparing it <b>to his exit from the Sanctuary</b> with the blood that remained after having sprinkled blood inside the Sanctuary. The verse states with regard to the bull offering of the High Priest: “And all the remaining blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 4:7). <b>Just as</b> upon <b>his exit from the Sanctuary</b> the priest pours the remainder of the blood <b>on</b> the side <b>closest to him,</b> the western side, <b>so too,</b> upon <b>his descent from the ramp</b> of the external altar after sprinkling blood from the sin offering, he pours the blood <b>on</b> the side <b>closest to him,</b> which is the southern side.

### Part 12
<b>It is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: This and that,</b> both the remainder of the blood sprinkled inside the Sanctuary and the remainder of the blood sprinkled on the external altar, are poured on the <b>western base</b> of the altar. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: This and that</b> are poured on the <b>southern base</b> of the altar.

### Part 13
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that the blood is poured on the <b>western base</b> of the altar, it is clear how he derived his <i>halakha</i>. He <b>holds</b> that one can <b>derive</b> the meaning of <b>an unspecified</b> phrase <b>from</b> the meaning of <b>the explicit</b> phrase. Therefore, just as the remainder of the blood sprinkled inside the Sanctuary is poured on the western base of the external altar, the same is done with the remainder of the blood sprinkled on the external altar.

### Part 14
<b>But according to the one who says</b> that the blood is poured on the <b>southern base</b> of the altar, <b>what is the reason? Rabbi Asi said: This <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>the entire</b> external <b>altar stands in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard. Therefore, the southern base is in the center of the courtyard, opposite the entrance to the Sanctuary. This is what the verse is referring to when it states: “At the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 4:7). The Gemara presents <b>another formulation</b> of Rabbi Asi’s explanation: <b>The entire entrance</b> of the Sanctuary <b>stands in the south</b> of the altar. Accordingly, when the priest exits the Sanctuary the southern base is the first one he encounters.
