### Part 1
<b>They disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>a verse is interpreted</b> based on juxtaposition to the language <b>preceding it and</b> to the language <b>following it.</b> According to Rabbi Shimon, a verse is interpreted only based on the language following it. Therefore, when the verse states: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it upon the corners of the altar,” the word “finger” is referring only to the placing of the blood and not its collection. The Rabbis hold that the verse is also interpreted based on the language preceding it. Accordingly, they require that both rites be performed with the right hand.

### Part 2
<b>Abaye says: This</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, diverges from</b> the opinion <b>of his father, and it diverges from</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis: As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says:</b> In <b>every instance</b> in the Torah <b>that</b> the word <b>“finger” is stated with regard to collection</b> of the blood and not with regard to placing of the blood on the altar, if the priest <b>deviated</b> from the proper method <b>of collection</b> and performed it with the left hand, the offering is <b>disqualified,</b> but if he deviated from the proper method <b>of placing</b> the blood, the offering remains <b>fit. And</b> in <b>every instance that</b> the word <b>“finger” is stated</b> only <b>with regard to placing</b> the blood, if the priest <b>deviated</b> from the proper method <b>of placing,</b> the offering is <b>disqualified,</b> but if he deviated from the proper method <b>of collection,</b> the offering remains <b>fit.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And where is</b> the word <b>“finger” stated</b> only <b>with regard to placing? As it is written: “And you shall take of the blood of the bullock and put it upon the corners of the altar with your finger”</b> (Exodus 29:12). <b>And he holds</b> that <b>a verse is interpreted</b> based on juxtaposition to the language immediately <b>preceding it and not</b> to the language <b>before that</b> which immediately <b>precedes it, nor</b> to the language <b>following it.</b>

### Part 4
§ <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In <b>every instance</b> in the Torah <b>that it is stated</b> that an action is performed with <b>a finger and</b> by members of the <b>priesthood,</b> it may be performed <b>only</b> with the <b>right</b> hand.

### Part 5
The Gemara comments: It might <b>enter our mind</b> to say that this means that <b>we require both</b> a finger and the priesthood to be stated together in the verse in order to mandate use of the right hand, e.g., <b>as it is written: “And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger”</b> (Leviticus 4:25). <b>And</b> the fact that this verse is referring to a finger from his right hand <b>is derived from a leper, as it is written: “And the priest shall dip his right finger”</b> (Leviticus 14:16). This cannot be correct, <b>as</b> there is the verse that addresses <b>the removal of a handful</b> from a meal offering, <b>in which only</b> the <b>priesthood is written, and</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 6a): If one <b>removed the handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, the meal offering is <b>disqualified.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rather, Rava says:</b> This statement means that if the verse mentions <b>either a finger or</b> the <b>priesthood,</b> only the right hand may be used.

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: But this is contradicted by the verse discussing <b>the conveyance of</b> the <b>limbs</b> of the daily burnt offering <b>to the ramp</b> of the altar, <b>as priesthood is written with regard to it, as it is written: “And the priest shall sacrifice the whole</b> and make it smoke <b>upon the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:13), <b>and the Master said</b> that <b>this</b> verse is referring to the <b>conveyance of</b> the <b>limbs to the ramp. And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 31b): When the priest conveys the limbs to the ramp, <b>the foot of</b> the <b>right</b> side of the offering is carried <b>in the left</b> hand <b>of</b> the priest, <b>and the place of its skin,</b> i.e., the side of the limb covered in skin, is held facing <b>outward.</b> Clearly, use of the left hand does not disqualify the conveyance of the limbs.

### Part 8
The Gemara responds: <b>When we say</b> that if the verse states <b>either finger or priesthood</b> then the left hand is disqualified, this is only <b>with regard to a matter that precludes atonement,</b> i.e., a rite whose performance is indispensable to the atonement, <b>similar to</b> the sprinkling of the oil on the <b>leper</b> (see Leviticus 14:16). The conveyance of the limbs, by contrast, is not indispensable to atonement.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t there the <b>collection</b> of the blood in a service vessel, <b>about which priesthood is written and</b> which <b>is a matter that precludes atonement? And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>one collected</b> the blood <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, the blood is <b>disqualified</b> for offering, <b>and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>fit.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara responds: <b>Rabbi Shimon requires</b> that <b>both</b> matters appear in the verse, i.e., both finger and priesthood.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>Does Rabbi Shimon</b> really <b>require both? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In <b>every instance</b> in the Torah <b>that</b> the word <b>“hand” is stated,</b> the verse <b>is</b> referring <b>only</b> to the <b>right</b> hand, and whenever the verse mentions <b>“finger,”</b> it <b>is</b> referring <b>only</b> to a finger of the <b>right</b> hand?

### Part 12
The Gemara responds: According to Rabbi Shimon, if the verse mentions only <b>“finger,”</b> then it <b>does not require</b> a mention of the <b>priesthood</b> as well for the limitation to apply. But if the verse mentions only the <b>priesthood,</b> it <b>requires</b> a mention of <b>“finger”</b> for the limitation to apply.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to Rabbi Shimon, if the mention of the priesthood alone does not suffice to disqualify the right hand, then <b>why do I</b> need the superfluous reference to <b>a priest</b> with regard to the collection of the blood? After all, the verse already states that the collection must be performed by the sons of Aaron. The Gemara responds: The additional mention of the priesthood indicates that the priests must perform the collection of the blood <b>in their priestly state,</b> i.e., while wearing the priestly vestments.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t there the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, <b>concerning which only</b> the <b>priesthood is written</b> in the verse, <b>and we learned:</b> If <b>one sprinkled</b> the blood <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand it is <b>disqualified; and Rabbi Shimon does not disagree</b> with this ruling, indicating that Rabbi Shimon holds that a mention of the priesthood does not require a mention of “finger”?

### Part 15
<b>Abaye says: He disagrees</b> with this ruling <b>in a <i>baraita</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one collected</b> the blood <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, it is <b>disqualified, and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>fit.</b> Additionally, if <b>one sprinkled</b> the blood <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, it is <b>disqualified, and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>fit.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>But that which Rava says</b> with regard to the superfluous phrases in the passage discussing a leper: One derives a verbal analogy between <b>“hand”</b> and <b>“hand”</b> mentioned with regard <b>to the removal of a handful</b> from a meal offering, to indicate that the latter must also be performed with the right hand. Additionally, one derives a verbal analogy between <b>“foot”</b> and <b>“foot”</b> mentioned with regard <b>to</b> the <b><i>ḥalitza</i></b> ritual. And one derives a verbal analogy between <b>“ear”</b> and <b>“ear”</b> mentioned with regard <b>to</b> the <b>piercing</b> of a Hebrew slave’s ear with an awl. One may ask: <b>Why do I</b> need the first analogy? The requirement that the handful be removed with the right hand can be <b>derived from</b> the statement <b>of Rabba bar bar Ḥana</b> above, since priesthood is mentioned in the verse describing it.

### Part 17
The Gemara responds: Both derivations are necessary, <b>one for</b> the removal of the <b>handful</b> from a meal offering, <b>and one for the sanctification of</b> the <b>handful,</b> i.e., placing it into a second service vessel. Both must be performed with the right hand.
