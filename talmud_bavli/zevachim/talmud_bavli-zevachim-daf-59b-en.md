### Part 1
<b>But isn’t it already stated</b> with regard to the altar that Moses built: <b>“A thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar”</b> (I Kings 3:4), <b>while with regard to the Eternal House,</b> i.e., the Temple, <b>it states: “And Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to the Lord, two and twenty thousand cattle</b> and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep” (I Kings 8:63)?

### Part 2
<b>And when you arrive at the calculation of burnt offerings and the number of cubits</b> for each altar, <b>this</b> was <b>greater than that,</b> i.e., Solomon sacrificed more offerings per square cubit on Moses’ altar than he did on the altar in the Temple upon its inauguration. Therefore, it is difficult to suggest that the altar in the Temple was not large enough to accommodate the number of offerings that Solomon sacrificed.

### Part 3
Rabbi Yosei presents an alternative understanding of the verse: <b>Rather, what is</b> the meaning of the phrase “because the copper altar…<b>was too small to receive”?</b> It is not referring to the altar built by Solo-mon, but rather to the copper altar built in the time of Moses, which was disqualified from use from the day of the Temple’s inauguration on. Rather than stating outright that the altar became disqualified, the verse employed a euphemism, <b>like a person who says to his friend: So-and-so is a dwarf [<i>nanas</i>], and</b> what he really means to say is that he is <b>disqualified from</b> performing the Temple <b>service.</b> Similarly, rather than stating outright that the altar built in the time of Moses became disqualified, the verse states that it was too small to accommodate the offerings sacrificed in the Temple.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> respond to this claim? <b>Rabbi Yosei is saying well,</b> i.e., his claim is persuasive. The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says</b> that <b>the altar that Moses built was large. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states that the altar built in the time of Moses was: <b>“Five cubits long and five cubits wide”</b> (Exodus 27:1). <b>The matters</b> in the verse are to be understood <b>as they are written;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: It is stated here</b> that the altar built in the time of Moses was: <b>“Square”</b> (Exodus 27:1), <b>and it is stated there,</b> in Ezekiel’s prophetic description of the altar, that it is: <b>“Square”</b> (Ezekiel 43:16). <b>Just as there,</b> in Ezekiel’s vision, <b>he was measuring</b> the distance in each direction <b>from its center, so too here,</b> the verse <b>was measuring</b> the altar that Moses built <b>from its center.</b> Accordingly, the altar built by Moses was ten cubits by ten cubits. As a result, Solomon sacrificed more offerings per square cubit of space on the altar in the Temple than he did on the altar built by Moses. It is therefore possible that the altar in the Temple was not sufficient to accommodate the offerings, and Solomon consecrated the Temple courtyard to serve as an altar.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that the altar mentioned <b>there,</b> in Ezekiel, was measured from its center? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And the hearth shall be twelve cubits</b> long by twelve wide, square, to its four sides” (Ezekiel 43:16). The Gemara asks: Does the verse mean twelve cubits <b>in each direction</b> from the center of the altar, so that in total it was twenty-four by twenty-four cubits? <b>Or</b> perhaps the altar was <b>only</b> a total of <b>twelve by twelve</b> cubits. The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “To its four sides,” it teaches that</b> Ezekiel was <b>measuring from the center</b> of the altar.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> respond to Rabbi Yehuda’s claim? The Gemara answers: <b>When he learns the verbal analogy, he learns it with regard to</b> the altar’s <b>height. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the altar built in the time of Moses: <b>“And its height shall be three cubits”</b> (Exodus 27:1). The <b>matters</b> in the verse are to be understood <b>as they are written,</b> i.e., that the height of the altar was three cubits. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: It is stated here</b> that the altar built in the time of Moses was: <b>“Square”</b> (Exodus 27:1), <b>and it is stated there</b> that the incense altar was: <b>“Square”</b> (Exodus 30:2). The verbal analogy indicates that <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the incense altar, <b>its height</b> was <b>twice its length, so too here,</b> the height of the altar built in the time of Moses was <b>twice its length,</b> i.e., ten cubits.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said to</b> Rabbi Yosei: <b>But isn’t it already stated:</b> “The length of <b>the court shall be a hundred cubits…and the height five cubits”</b> (Exodus 27:18)? Is it <b>possible</b> that the <b>priest</b> would <b>stand atop the altar and</b> hold the items with which he would perform the sacrificial <b>service in his hand, and the whole nation</b> could <b>see him from outside</b> the courtyard? That would constitute a lack of respect for the service in the Tabernacle.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yosei said</b> back <b>to him: But isn’t it already stated: “And the curtains of the court, and the screen for</b> the door of <b>the gate of the court which is by the Tabernacle and by the altar”</b> (Numbers 4:26)? This verse juxtaposes the Tabernacle with the altar to teach that <b>just as</b> the <b>Tabernacle</b> was <b>ten cubits</b> high, <b>so too,</b> the <b>altar</b> was <b>ten cubits</b> high. <b>And</b> another verse <b>states: “The curtains were fifteen</b>
