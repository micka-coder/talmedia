<b>to bring it</b> again. Therefore, the second conveying must also be performed by a priest.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rav Ashi: This</b> is what <b>Rav Yirmeya of Difti said</b> when he stated <b>that it is necessary to bring</b> the blood to the altar again, and that therefore the second conveying is considered a sacrificial rite and must be performed by a priest: He meant that this principle is subject to <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 3
This is <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna (13a): <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>one who conveys</b> the blood <b>in a situation where he is required to convey</b> it, prohibited <b>intent</b> while conveying it <b>disqualifies</b> the offering. If he conveys the blood <b>in a situation where he is not required to convey</b> it, prohibited <b>intent</b> while conveying it <b>does not disqualify</b> the offering.

### Part 4
<b>And Rava says: All</b> of the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>concede</b> that if one <b>collected</b> the blood <b>outside,</b> i.e., at a distance from the altar, <b>and he brought it inside,</b> close to the altar, <b>that is</b> considered <b>necessary conveying.</b> If one <b>collected it inside and took it outside, that is</b> considered <b>unnecessary conveying.</b>

### Part 5
<b>They disagree only</b> with regard to a case <b>where he brought it in and took it out again.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that since <b>it is necessary to bring it</b> back to the altar, it is considered necessary conveying, and prohibited intent while performing it disqualifies the offering. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that since the rite of conveying to the altar was already performed, <b>it is not considered conveying that is necessary for the</b> sacrificial <b>service,</b> and prohibited intent while performing it does not disqualify the offering. Apparently, the same dispute applies to a case where a non-priest conveyed the blood the second time.

### Part 6
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rava’s interpretation from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>one who conveys</b> the blood <b>in a situation where he is required to convey</b> it, prohibited <b>intent</b> while conveying it <b>disqualifies</b> the offering. <b>How so?</b> If one <b>collected</b> the blood <b>outside,</b> at a distance from the altar, <b>and he brought it inside,</b> close to the altar, <b>that is</b> considered <b>necessary conveying.</b> If one <b>collected it inside and took it outside, that is</b> considered <b>unnecessary conveying. And consequently,</b> one infers that if <b>he brought it in again, it is</b> considered <b>necessary conveying</b> even according to Rabbi Eliezer.

### Part 7
Rava <b>said to him: If this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught, it is taught,</b> and I cannot disagree with it.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>all slaughtered offerings,</b> if the one <b>who collected their blood</b> was <b>a non-priest;</b> or a priest who was <b>an acute mourner,</b> i.e., one whose relative has died and has not yet been buried; or <b>one</b> who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed; <b>or one who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering, e.g., a <i>zav</i> or leper after the seventh day of the purification process; <b>or</b> a priest <b>lacking</b> the requisite priestly <b>vestments;</b> or one <b>who did not wash his hands and feet</b> from the water in the Basin prior to performing the Temple service; or <b>an uncircumcised</b> priest; or <b>a ritually impure</b> priest; or if the one who collected the blood was <b>sitting;</b> or if he was <b>standing</b> not on the floor of the Temple but <b>upon vessels,</b> or <b>upon an animal,</b> or <b>upon the feet of another,</b> he has <b>disqualified</b> the offering.

### Part 10
If <b>he collected</b> the blood <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, he <b>disqualified</b> the blood for offering. In this last case, <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>fit.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>a non-priest</b> who performs sacrificial rites disqualifies an offering? <b>As Levi teaches:</b> The verse states: <b>“Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the sacred items of the children of Israel [<i>benei Yisrael</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 22:2). Levi continues: <b>“The children of Israel”</b> serves <b>to exclude what</b> from the prohibition against sacrificing an offering in a state of impurity? <b>If we say</b> that it serves <b>to exclude</b> the offerings of <b>women,</b> and the verse states “<i>benei</i>” in the masculine to indicate sons but not daughters, is it conceivable that <b>an offering of women is sacrificed in</b> a state of <b>impurity?</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps it serves <b>to exclude</b> offerings of <b>gentiles. Now,</b> if the <b>frontplate</b> of the High Priest, which normally effects acceptance for offerings of Jews sacrificed in a state of impurity, <b>does not effect acceptance</b> for the offerings of gentiles, <b>as the Master said: And with regard to</b> an offering of <b>gentiles, whether</b> it was offered in a state of impurity <b>unintentionally or intentionally, it was not accepted;</b> can it be, then, that such an offering <b>is sacrificed in</b> a state of <b>impurity</b> <i>ab initio</i>?

### Part 13
<b>Rather, this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying,</b> i.e., it should be read in the following manner: <b>That they separate themselves from the sacred items; the children of Israel, and that they not profane</b> My holy name. That is, the verse states that they, the priests, must separate themselves from the sacred items when they are ritually impure, and that the children of Israel must separate themselves from performing the sacrificial rites, so that they will not profane, i.e., disqualify, the offerings.

### Part 14
A <i>tanna</i> of the <b>school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of a non-priest who performs the sacrificial rites <b>is derived via an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of <b>a blemished</b> priest: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a blemished</b> priest, <b>who may partake</b> of the meat of offerings, <b>if he performed</b> sacrificial <b>rites</b> he has nevertheless <b>desecrated</b> the service,
