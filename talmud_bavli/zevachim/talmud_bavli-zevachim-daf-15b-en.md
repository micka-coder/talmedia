<b>to bring it</b> again. Therefore, the second conveying must also be performed by a priest.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rav Ashi: This</b> is what <b>Rav Yirmeya of Difti said</b> when he stated <b>that it is necessary to bring</b> the blood to the altar again, and that therefore the second conveying is considered a sacrificial rite and must be performed by a priest: He meant that this principle is subject to <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 3
This is <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna (13a): <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>one who conveys</b> the blood <b>in a situation where he is required to convey</b> it, prohibited <b>intent</b> while conveying it <b>disqualifies</b> the offering. If he conveys the blood <b>in a situation where he is not required to convey</b> it, prohibited <b>intent</b> while conveying it <b>does not disqualify</b> the offering.

### Part 4
<b>And Rava says: All</b> of the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>concede</b> that if one <b>collected</b> the blood <b>outside,</b> i.e., at a distance from the altar, <b>and he brought it inside,</b> close to the altar, <b>that is</b> considered <b>necessary conveying.</b> If one <b>collected it inside and took it outside, that is</b> considered <b>unnecessary conveying.</b>

### Part 5
<b>They disagree only</b> with regard to a case <b>where he brought it in and took it out again.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that since <b>it is necessary to bring it</b> back to the altar, it is considered necessary conveying, and prohibited intent while performing it disqualifies the offering. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that since the rite of conveying to the altar was already performed, <b>it is not considered conveying that is necessary for the</b> sacrificial <b>service,</b> and prohibited intent while performing it does not disqualify the offering. Apparently, the same dispute applies to a case where a non-priest conveyed the blood the second time.

### Part 6
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rava’s interpretation from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>one who conveys</b> the blood <b>in a situation where he is required to convey</b> it, prohibited <b>intent</b> while conveying it <b>disqualifies</b> the offering. <b>How so?</b> If one <b>collected</b> the blood <b>outside,</b> at a distance from the altar, <b>and he brought it inside,</b> close to the altar, <b>that is</b> considered <b>necessary conveying.</b> If one <b>collected it inside and took it outside, that is</b> considered <b>unnecessary conveying. And consequently,</b> one infers that if <b>he brought it in again, it is</b> considered <b>necessary conveying</b> even according to Rabbi Eliezer.

### Part 7
Rava <b>said to him: If this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught, it is taught,</b> and I cannot disagree with it.
