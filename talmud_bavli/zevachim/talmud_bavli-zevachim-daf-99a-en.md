### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that a priest who is unfit for the Temple service does not receive a share of the sacrificial meat. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states</b> about a sin offering: <b>“The priest who effects atonement shall eat it;</b> in a sacred place shall it be eaten, in the court of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 6:19). This teaches that only <b>a priest who effects atonement</b> by performing the rites of the offering <b>shall partake</b> of its meat, but a priest <b>who does not effect atonement does not partake</b> of its meat.

### Part 2
The Gemara challenges: <b>And is</b> this an established <b>principle? But</b> there are <b>all the</b> priests of the <b>priestly watch</b> of that week in the Temple, <b>who do not effect atonement</b> for that offering, because the blood of a specific sin offering is presented by just one priest, <b>and</b> yet they all <b>partake</b> of its meat. The Gemara explains: <b>We</b> mean to <b>say</b> that any priest who is <b>fit for effecting atonement</b> may partake of it, even one who did not participate in the service.

### Part 3
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>a minor, who is unfit for effecting atonement, and</b> who nevertheless <b>partakes</b> of sacrificial meat. The Gemara explains: <b>Rather, what</b> is meant by the term: <b>“Shall eat it”?</b> It means that he <b>shall receive a share of it.</b> The <i>halakha</i> is therefore that a priest who is <b>fit for effecting atonement receives a share</b> of the meat, but a priest <b>who is unfit for effecting atonement does not receive a share</b> of the meat. Minors do not receive a share, though they may partake of meat given to them by others.

### Part 4
The Gemara objects: But there is <b>a blemished priest, who is unfit for effecting atonement, and</b> yet he <b>receives a share</b> of its meat. The Gemara replies: <b>The Merciful One included a blemished</b> priest as an exception, as the verse that states: <b>“Every male among the priests</b> shall eat it” (Leviticus 6:22), serves <b>to include a blemished</b> priest.

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>But say</b> that the phrase <b>“every male”</b> serves <b>to include one who immersed that day,</b> teaching that he may also receive a share in the sacrificial meat. Why should it be understood as referring specifically to a blemished priest? The Gemara replies: <b>It stands to reason</b> that the Torah <b>should include a blemished</b> priest for receiving his own share of the meat, <b>because</b> he may <b>partake</b> of sacrificial meat in any event. By contrast, one who immersed that day is impure and may not touch or partake of sacrificial meat.

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects this: <b>On the contrary,</b> the Torah <b>should include one who immersed that day, because,</b> unlike a blemished priest, <b>in the evening he will be fit</b> to perform the service. The Gemara replies: <b>Now, in any event,</b> the one who immersed himself <b>is not fit.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> another explanation: <b>Now what</b> is meant by the term: <b>“Shall eat it”?</b> It means: He <b>shall receive a share of it.</b> But if so, <b>let the Merciful One write: Shall receive a share of it. What</b> is the reason for writing: <b>“Shall eat it”? Learn from it</b> that only a priest who is <b>fit for partaking</b> of sacrificial meat, which includes a blemished priest, <b>receives a share</b> in the meat; but a priest <b>who is not fit for partaking</b> of sacrificial meat, e.g., one who immersed that day, <b>does not</b> receive a <b>share</b> in the meat.

### Part 8
§ <b>Reish Lakish raises a dilemma:</b> If a priest is <b>blemished and he is impure, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Must the other priests <b>give him a share</b> of the meat? Perhaps we say that <b>since he is not fit</b> to perform the rite as a blemished priest <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>the Merciful One included him</b> to receive a share in the meat, there <b>is no difference: What</b> is the difference <b>to me</b> if he is <b>impure,</b> and <b>what</b> is the difference <b>to me</b> if he is only <b>blemished?</b> In any event he is not fit, yet the Torah allows him to receive a share in the meat. <b>Or perhaps</b> he may not receive a share in the meat, because only a priest who is <b>fit for partaking</b> of sacrificial meat <b>receives a share</b> of the meat, but a priest <b>who is not fit for partaking</b> of sacrificial meat <b>does not receive a share</b> of the meat.

### Part 9
<b>Rabba said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a High Priest</b> is serving in the Temple and one of his immediate relatives dies, <b>he sacrifices</b> offerings even as <b>an acute mourner. But he does not partake</b> of sacrificial meat, <b>and he does not receive a share to partake</b> of it <b>in the evening. Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that in order for the priest to receive a share in sacrificial meat, <b>we require</b> that he be <b>fit for partaking</b> of it, and accordingly, a blemished priest who is impure does not receive a share. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that this is so.

### Part 10
§ <b>Rav Oshaya raises a dilemma:</b> If a priest is <b>impure,</b> then <b>in</b> a case of <b>communal offerings,</b> which may be offered by an impure priest, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do the other priests <b>give him a share</b> of the meat, so that he may partake of it in the evening when he becomes pure? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “The priest <b>who effects atonement,” and</b> therefore any priest who is fit for effecting atonement receives a share, as derived earlier, and <b>this</b> priest <b>is also</b> one who may <b>effect atonement,</b> since this is a communal offering? <b>Or perhaps</b> he may not, due to the principle that only a priest who is <b>fit for partaking</b> of sacrificial meat <b>receives a share</b> of the meat, but a priest <b>who is unfit for partaking</b> of sacrificial meat <b>does not receive a share.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Ravina said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a High Priest</b> is serving in the Temple and one of his relatives dies, <b>he sacrifices</b> offerings even as <b>an acute mourner, but he does not partake</b> of sacrificial meat <b>and he does not receive a share</b> of it <b>to partake in the evening. Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that in order for a priest to receive a share in sacrificial meat, <b>we require</b> that he be <b>fit for partaking</b> of it at the time of the service, without regard to whether he can perform the service. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that this is so.

### Part 12
§ The mishna teaches: A priest who is <b>an acute mourner</b> is permitted to <b>touch</b> sacrificial meat, <b>but he may not sacrifice</b> offerings. The Gemara asks: Is it in fact permitted for <b>an acute mourner</b> to <b>touch</b> sacrificial meat? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another mishna (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 21a): <b>An acute mourner and one who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering, even after their respective disqualifications have expired, <b>require immersion</b> in order <b>to</b> eat <b>sacrificial</b> food. According to that mishna, an acute mourner who did not immerse may not touch sacrificial meat.

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the ruling of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case <b>where</b> the mourner <b>immersed</b> during his day of acute mourning. This is why he is permitted to touch the sacrificial meat. <b>There,</b> the ruling of the mishna in tractate <i>Ḥagiga</i> is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case <b>where</b> the mourner <b>did not immerse.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> even <b>if</b> he <b>immersed, what of it? But</b> doesn’t his <b>acute mourning return to him? As Rabba, son of Rav Huna, says:</b> In a case of <b>an acute mourner who immersed</b> during his day of his acute mourning, <b>his acute mourning returns to him.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. That</b> case, in tractate <i>Ḥagiga</i>, is one <b>where he was distracted</b> from safeguarding his state of purity, so he may not touch sacrificial meat in the event that he is impure. <b>This</b> case, in the mishna here, is one <b>where he was not distracted.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara counters: If the mishna in tractate <i>Ḥagiga</i> is discussing a case of <b>distraction,</b> then his status is like that of one who contracted ritual impurity imparted by a corpse, who <b>requires</b> sprinkling with water of purification on the <b>third and seventh</b> days of his impurity. <b>As Rabbi Yustai, son of Rabbi Matun, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> One who experienced <b>a distraction requires sprinkling</b> with water of purification on the <b>third and seventh</b> days.

### Part 17
The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult. That</b> statement, that he requires sprinkling, is discussing a case <b>where he was distracted</b> and careless <b>about</b> contracting <b>impurity imparted by a corpse. This</b> mishna in tractate <i>Ḥagiga</i>, stating that he requires immersion but not sprinkling, is discussing a case <b>where he was distracted</b> and careless <b>about</b> contracting <b>impurity imparted by</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara counters: One who was careless about becoming <b>impure due to</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal is fully impure,</b> and so he requires not only immersion to become pure, but he also <b>requires sunset. And furthermore,</b> if the mishna in tractate <i>Ḥagiga</i> is discussing this case, the mourner should be prohibited from touching <b>even <i>teruma</i>,</b> not just sacrificial meat. Why does the mishna mention only the latter?

### Part 19
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> The mishna is discussing a case <b>where he says: I safeguarded myself from anything that would render me impure,</b> so I am certain that I did not contract impurity that requires waiting until sunset; <b>but I did not safeguard my-self from anything that would render me unfit</b> for touching sacrificial meat.

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>But is there</b> such a concept of <b>partial care,</b> that one can claim to have safeguarded himself from one form of impurity but not another? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one was carrying a basket, and <b>the basket was still on his head,</b>
