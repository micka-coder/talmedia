### Part 1
<b>If bird</b> offerings, whose <i>halakhot</i> are more lenient in <b>that a blemish does not disqualify them, are</b> nevertheless <b>disqualified by time,</b> then with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>of a small</b> private <b>altar, which are disqualified by a blemish, is it not logical that they</b> should be <b>disqualified by time?</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara questions the inference: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about bird</b> offerings? They are notable <b>in that a non-priest is not fit to</b> sacrifice <b>them. Shall you say</b> the same <b>with regard to</b> offerings sacrificed on <b>a small</b> private <b>altar, where a non-priest is fit?</b> No, and consequently they <b>should not be disqualified by time.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings”</b> (Leviticus 7:11), which equates all peace offerings, <b>to render</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>time</b> with regard to <b>a small</b> private <b>altar identical to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>time</b> with regard to <b>a great</b> public <b>altar.</b>
