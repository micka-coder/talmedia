an area whose <b>length</b> is <b>187</b> cubits <b>by 135</b> cubits in <b>width.</b>

### Part 2
<b>A <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman: The entire</b> Temple <b>courtyard was 187</b> cubits in length <b>by 135</b> cubits in <b>width.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> the <i>tanna</i>: <b>My father said this to me:</b> In an area <b>such as this,</b> the <b>priests enter there and eat offerings of the most sacred order there, and slaughter offerings of lesser sanctity there, and are liable due to</b> entering in a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: These specific dimensions serve <b>to exclude what? If we say</b> they are stated <b>to exclude</b> the <b>windows, doors, and thickness of the wall, we learn</b> the opposite in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 85b): <b>The windows</b> in the wall <b>and the thickness of the wall</b> are considered <b>as though</b> they are <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard.

### Part 4
<b>But rather,</b> they are stated <b>to exclude</b> the <b>chambers</b> in the Temple courtyard. The Gemara asks: <b>And if</b> it is referring to chambers that are <b>built in the non-sacred</b> area, which is outside this designated space, <b>and open to the sacred</b> area, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 3:8): The inside of chambers that are built in the sacred area but are open to the non-sacred area is non-sacred, but their roofs are sacred. If they are built in a non-sacred area and open to a sacred area, <b>their interior</b> is <b>sacred</b> and their roofs are non-sacred? The Gemara answers: They have sanctity <b>by rabbinic law.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> do they <b>not</b> have sanctity <b>by Torah law? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the <b>chambers</b> that are <b>built in the non-sacred</b> area of the Temple Mount <b>and open to the sacred</b> area, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that the priests enter there and eat there offerings of the most sacred order and the remainders of meal offerings? The verse states</b> with regard to a meal offering: “It shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; <b>in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting they shall eat it.”</b> (Leviticus 6:9). The verse could have simply stated: “In a holy place,” which indicates the courtyard. By also stating: “In the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting,” <b>the Torah amplified many courtyards with one</b> type of <b>eating,</b> i.e., of the meal offering. If the chambers do not have sanctity by Torah law, the Sages would not have permitted the priests to eat offerings of the most sacred order there.

### Part 6
<b>Rava said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> <b>concerning eating</b> is <b>different.</b> The Torah specifically includes these chambers in addition to the Temple courtyard itself for eating offerings of the most sacred order. By contrast, with regard to slaughtering offerings of lesser sanctity and the punishment for entering the courtyard in a state of ritual impurity, these chambers are not considered sacred by Torah law.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But with regard to ritual impurity,</b> is one <b>not</b> liable to receive <i>karet</i> for entering these chambers? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the <b>chambers that are built in the non-sacred</b> area <b>and</b> that <b>open to the sacred</b> area, <b>priests enter there and eat offerings of the most sacred order there, but may not slaughter offerings of lesser sanctity there, and are liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>due to ritual impurity</b> if they enter there while ritually impure?

### Part 8
Rava could answer: <b>Did you not say</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>they may not slaughter</b> offerings of lesser sanctity in those chambers? If so, emend the text of the <i>baraita</i> and <b>teach also: They are not liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> for entering in a state of ritual impurity.

### Part 9
The Gemara challenges: <b>Granted,</b> the priests <b>may not slaughter</b> there, because slaughtering an offering <b>requires</b> that it be performed <b>before the entrance</b> of the Temple courtyard, <b>and</b> if he slaughters it inside a chamber, it <b>is not. But why</b> would they <b>not</b> be <b>liable</b> for entering there in a state of ritual impurity?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> when it teaches that they <b>may not slaughter</b> there, <b>are we not dealing</b> even with a case in <b>which there is</b> an act of <b>slaughter</b> performed <b>before the entrance,</b> i.e., the entrance to the chamber directly faced the entrance of the Temple? <b>As if not, for what</b> purpose <b>was</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach this at all? <b>Rather, even though he slaughters</b> the offering <b>before the entrance,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that a priest <b>may not slaughter</b> offerings in the chambers <b>because</b> that area <b>is not sacred.</b> If so, <b>teach also</b> that they <b>are not liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> for entering the chambers in a state of ritual impurity, as they are not sacred.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And for eating</b> an offering, <b>do we not require</b> that this take place <b>before the entrance</b> of the Temple courtyard? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: There were two wickets in the Chamber of Knives,</b> and <b>their height</b> was <b>eight</b> cubits; the function of these openings was <b>in order to render fit the</b> entire Temple <b>courtyard for the eating of offerings of the most sacred order, and</b> to render fit all of the Temple courtyard <b>for the slaughter of offerings of lesser sanctity? Ravina said: Remove from here</b> the clause concerning <b>eating.</b> The eating of offerings does not have to take place before the entrance of the Temple courtyard.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to the offerings brought at the inauguration of the Tabernacle: “And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons: <b>Cook the meat at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting; and eat it there”</b> (Leviticus 8:31). This indicates that the eating of offerings had to be at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. The Gemara answers: <b>Offerings</b> that were sacrificed only one <b>time are different.</b> Since they were specifically commanded for just that time, one cannot derive from there any <i>halakhot</i> with regard to offerings in general.

### Part 13
§ <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the blood</b> of offerings <b>becomes disqualified at sunset</b> and can no longer be presented on the altar? This is <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: “But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a gift offering, <b>it shall be eaten on the day that he sacrifices his offering [<i>zivḥo</i>],</b> and on the morrow” (Leviticus 7:16). This means that <b>on the day that you slaughter [<i>zove’aḥ</i>]</b> the offering <b>you sacrifice</b> it on the altar and present its blood. But <b>on the day that you do not slaughter</b> the offering <b>you may not sacrifice</b> it and present its blood.

### Part 14
The Gemara challenges: But <b>he requires this</b> verse
