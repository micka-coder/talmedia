### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> According to the mishna, a bird sin offer-ing that one sacrificed according to the procedure of a burnt offering is disqualified. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> rite <b>did</b> the priest <b>change</b> the procedure? <b>If we say that he changed</b> the <b>pinching</b> by severing the head completely, as is proper for a burnt offering, shall <b>we say that</b> the mishna <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who says: I heard that</b> the priests would <b>sever</b> the head completely even <b>in</b> the sacrifice of <b>a bird sin offering?</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara responds: <b>And</b> what is wrong with this conclusion? <b>Have we not</b> already <b>explained that</b> the mishna in the previous chapter (65a), with regard to pinching, <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara offers another explanation: <b>No,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>changed</b> the procedure <b>in</b> the rite of <b>sprinkling</b> by squeezing out all the blood at once, as one would do with a burnt offering, rather than first sprinkling the blood on the altar as is proper for a sin offering. Under such circumstances, Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, would also agree that the offering is disqualified.

### Part 4
<b>This, too, stands to reason</b> that the mishna is referring to a change in the sprinkling. This can be inferred <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause:</b> If <b>one sacrificed</b> a bird sin offering <b>above</b> the red line <b>according to the procedure of any of</b> the offerings, it is <b>disqualified, and</b> this applies <b>even</b> if he sacrificed it <b>according to the procedure of a sin offering</b> and <b>for the sake of a sin offering. With regard to what</b> rite <b>did</b> the priest <b>change</b> the location of the procedure? <b>If we say that he changed</b> the <b>pinching,</b> performing it above the red line, <b>didn’t the Master</b> already <b>say</b> with regard to a bird sin offering that <b>pinching is valid anywhere on the altar? Rather, is it not that he changed</b> the location of the <b>sprinkling? And since</b> the ruling of <b>the latter clause</b> is stated <b>with regard to sprinkling,</b> by inference, the ruling of <b>the first clause</b> is <b>also</b> stated <b>with regard to sprinkling.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara responds to this proof: <b>Are the cases comparable? This</b> case is <b>as it is, and that</b> case is <b>as it is.</b> Even if the ruling of the latter clause is stated with regard to a change in the location of the sprinkling, the ruling of the first clause may still be stated with regard to a change in the procedure of the pinching, in which case the mishna would not be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon.

### Part 6
§ According to the mishna, <b>a bird burnt offering</b> that one sacrificed according to the procedure of a sin offering is disqualified. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> rite <b>did</b> the priest <b>change</b> the procedure?

### Part 7
<b>If we say</b> that <b>he changed</b> the <b>pinching</b> of the bird’s nape by leaving the head partially attached, as is proper for a sin offering, then <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause,</b> i.e., the first clause of the next mishna (66b), <b>teaches: All of</b> the offerings enumerated above <b>do not render</b> one who swallows their meat <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat, and</b> one who benefits <b>from them</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, by inference, <b>we</b> must <b>say</b> that the mishna <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua. As, if</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, doesn’t he say</b> later on in that mishna concerning a burnt offering whose nape was pinched according to the procedure of a sin offering: One who derives benefit from it is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property?

### Part 8
<b>Rather,</b> the mishna must be referring to a change <b>in</b> the procedure of <b>squeezing</b> out the blood. Instead of squeezing out the blood, the priest sprinkled it on the wall of the altar as if it were a sin offering. In this case, even Rabbi Yehoshua would concede that one is liable for misusing it.

### Part 9
But <b>say the last clause</b> of the subsequent mishna: In the case of <b>a bird burnt offering that one sacrificed below</b> the red line <b>according to the procedure of a sin offering,</b> and <b>for the sake of a sin offering, Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One who benefits <b>from it</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, as it remains a burnt offering. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> One who benefits <b>from it</b> is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, as the bird assumes the status of a sin offering. Here, <b>with regard to what</b> rite <b>did</b> the priest <b>change</b> the procedure and perform it as if it were a sin offering?

### Part 10
<b>If we say</b> that he changed the <b>squeezing,</b> this poses a difficulty, as it is reasonable to <b>say that Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> that one is not liable for misuse specifically <b>when</b> the priest <b>changed</b> the <b>pinching,</b> as pinching a burnt offering for a bird as though it were a sin offering changes its status; but <b>does he say</b> this <b>in</b> a case where it was pinched properly, and the priest changed the <b>squeezing</b> procedure alone? It is unreasonable to suggest that the offering changes its status at this later stage.

### Part 11
<b>Rather,</b> this final clause must be referring to a change <b>with regard to</b> the <b>pinching.</b> But can it be that <b>the first clause</b> concerning a sin offering sacrificed as a burnt offering <b>and the last clause</b> concerning the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua are both referring to a change <b>with regard to</b> the <b>pinching, but the middle clause</b> concerning a burnt offering sacrificed as a sin offering is referring to a change <b>with regard to</b> the <b>squeezing?</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>Indeed, the first clause and the last clause</b> are referring to a change <b>with regard to</b> the <b>pinching, and the middle clause</b> is referring to a change <b>with regard to</b> the <b>squeezing.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And all of</b> the offerings enumerated in the previous mishna, even those that are disqualified and may not be eaten or sacrificed, still differ from carcasses of unslaughtered kosher birds in that they <b>do not render</b> one who swallows their meat <b>ritually impure</b> when the meat is <b>in the throat.</b> This is because the pinching of the napes of bird offerings, like the slaughter of animals, prevents them from assuming the status of a carcass. <b>But</b> nevertheless, since they are forbidden to the priests, one who derives benefit from any of <b>them</b> is liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property. This is the <i>halakha</i> in all cases <b>except for the bird sin offering that one sacrificed below</b> the red line <b>according to the procedure of</b> the <b>sin offering</b> and <b>for the sake of a sin offering.</b> Since it was sacrificed properly and it is permitted for priests to partake of a fit sin offering, there is no liability for misuse of consecrated property.

### Part 14
In the case of <b>a bird burnt offering that</b> one improperly <b>sacrificed below</b> the red line <b>according to the procedure of</b> the <b>sin offering,</b> and one did so <b>for the sake of a sin offering, Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One who derives benefit from <b>it</b> is liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property, as it remains a burnt offering, whose meat is never permitted to the priests. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> One who derives benefit from <b>it</b> is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property. Since the entire sacrificial process was conducted according to the procedure of a sin offering, the offering assumes the status of a sin offering in this regard.

### Part 15
The mishna recounts the dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i>. <b>Rabbi Eliezer said: And if</b> in the case of <b>a sin offering that</b> was sacrificed <b>for its sake,</b> one is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing it,</b> and nevertheless, <b>when one changed its designation</b> and sacrificed it not for its sake, one is liable for <b>misusing it,</b> then in the case of <b>a burnt offering, where</b> one is liable for <b>misusing it</b> even when it was sacrificed <b>for its sake, when one changed its designation</b> and sacrificed it not for its sake <b>is it not right that</b> he is liable for <b>misusing it?</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: No,</b> that <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not correct, as <b>if you said with regard to a sin offering</b> for <b>which one changed its designation</b> and sacrificed it <b>for the sake of a burnt offering</b> that there is liability for misuse, this is reasonable, <b>because he changed its designation to an item for which there is</b> liability for <b>misuse. Would you say in</b> the case of <b>a burnt offering</b> for <b>which one changed its designation</b> and sacrificed it <b>for the sake of a sin offering</b> that there is liability for misuse, <b>as</b> in that case <b>he changed its designation to an item for which there is no</b> liability for its <b>misuse?</b>
