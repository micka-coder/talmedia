### Part 1
Even if the carcass of a kosher bird <b>has not yet been brought close</b> to being swallowed, it is still <b>not considered as</b> if a necessary <b>action has not yet</b> been performed, and an olive-bulk is sufficient to transmit impurity to food and drink.

### Part 2
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>raised an objection to</b> Rabbi Abba bar Shmuel, based on a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 1:1): <b>Thirteen matters were stated with regard to the carcass of a kosher bird, and this is one of them:</b> In order to be susceptible to impurity as a food, it <b>requires</b> a person’s <b>intention</b> that it be eaten; <b>and it does not need</b> to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to such impurity by contact with liquid; <b>and it transmits ritual impurity of food in</b> the amount of <b>an egg-bulk.</b> In accordance with whose opinion is this mishna? <b>What, is it not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir?</b> If so, he holds that an egg-bulk of a carcass of a kosher bird is necessary to transmit impurity.

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the mishna <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara challenges: <b>But the first clause</b> of that mishna <b>teaches:</b> In order to be susceptible to impurity as a food, it <b>requires</b> a person’s <b>intention</b> that it be eaten <b>and it does not need</b> to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> by contact with liquid. <b>And</b> from <b>whom do you learn this reasoning?</b> From <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> as was taught in the <i>baraita</i> (105a). <b>And since the first clause</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> it follows that <b>the latter clause</b> is <b>also</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara responds: <b>Are the cases comparable?</b> Must both clauses be the opinion of the same <i>tanna</i>? <b>This</b> case is <b>as it is, and that</b> case is <b>as it is.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> one can still infer this <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of that mishna <b>teaches: The slaughter or the pinching</b> of the nape <b>of</b> a bird offering <b>purifies it from its impurity,</b> i.e., prevents it from assuming the impure status of a carcass, even if it is found to <b>have a wound that would have caused it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>].</b> And from <b>whom did you learn this reasoning?</b> From <b>Rabbi Meir</b> (see 67a). Could it be that <b>the first clause and the last clause</b> represent the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and the middle clause</b> represents the opinion of <b>the Rabbis?</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara responds: <b>Yes, the first clause and the last clause</b> represent the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and the middle clause</b> represents the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 8
§ <b>Rav Hamnuna said to Rabbi Zeira: Do not sit down until you tell me</b> the resolution of <b>this matter:</b> In general, when a food touches a primary source of ritual impurity after having been rendered susceptible to impurity by contact with a liquid, it contracts first-degree impurity. If it then touches another food, it imparts to it second-degree impurity. <b>The carcass of a kosher bird, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> transmits impurity to food without being rendered susceptible. Does one <b>count its first and second</b> degrees of impurity when it touches food or drink, treating it like a primary source of impurity? <b>Or</b> perhaps one <b>does not count first and second</b> degrees of impurity, but rather treats it as a food with first-degree impurity, which imparts second-degree impurity?

### Part 9
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Wherever</b> an item <b>can render a person impure through contact,</b> it is considered a primary source of impurity, and one <b>counts its first and second</b> degrees of impurity. And <b>wherever it cannot render a person impure through contact,</b> one <b>does not count its first and second</b> degrees of impu-rity. Since the carcass of a kosher bird does not render a person impure through contact, but only by being swallowed, it is treated as a food with first-degree impurity.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Zeira posed a dilemma to Rabbi Ami bar Ḥiyya, and some say to Rabbi Avin bar Kahana</b> concerning <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 8:8): <b>Connections between foods by liquid,</b> i.e., liquids in contact with two foods, a situation that causes the impurity of one food to be transmitted to the other and their sizes to be combined toward the minimum measure for transmitting impurity, are considered <b>a connection for</b> the <b>lenient impurity</b> of foods, <b>but</b> are <b>not</b> considered <b>a connection for impurity severe</b> enough to be transmitted to a human being. If two pieces of animal carcass are connected by a liquid, they do not combine to form the minimum measure for transmitting their impurity to a person, but they can transmit impurity to food.

### Part 11
Rabbi Zeira asks: If these two pieces of animal carcass come in contact with food, does one <b>count its first and second</b> degrees of impurity and treat the pieces as a primary source of impurity, such that the food will impart second-degree impurity to other food? <b>Or</b> does one <b>not count its first and second</b> degrees of impurity, and treat the animal carcass as food with first-degree impurity?

### Part 12
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Wherever</b> an item <b>can render a person impure,</b> one <b>counts its first and second</b> degrees of impurity. And wherever it <b>cannot render a person impure,</b> one <b>does not count its first and second</b> degrees of impurity. Since the pieces of carcass cannot transmit their impurity to a person, they are treated as food with first-degree impurity.

### Part 13
§ The mishna teaches: When both <b>these</b> priests <b>and those</b> priests <b>emerged,</b> all of their garments were rendered ritually impure. The Gemara explains: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the bull and goat that are burned on Yom Kippur: “They shall be carried forth outside the camp” (Leviticus 16:27). <b>There,</b> elsewhere, the verse <b>states</b> that such bulls and goats are burned <b>outside three camps,</b> those of the Tabernacle, the Levites, and the Israelites, whereas <b>here,</b> the verse states only that they are taken outside <b>one camp,</b> i.e., the Tabernacle. This serves <b>to tell you: Once</b> the offering <b>emerges beyond one camp,</b> one who carries it <b>renders</b> his <b>garments impure,</b> as the next verse states: “And he who burns them shall wash his garments” (Leviticus 16:28).

### Part 14
The Gemara explains further: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>itself,</b> that the bulls and goats are burned outside the three camps? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated about the bull brought as a sin offering of the High Priest: <b>“Even the whole bull shall he carry outside the camp</b> unto a pure place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it” (Leviticus 4:12), meaning that he should take it <b>outside</b> the <b>three camps. Do you say</b> that he takes it <b>outside</b> the <b>three camps, or</b> is he required to take it outside <b>only one camp?</b>

### Part 15
<b>When</b> the verse <b>states with regard to the bull</b> brought as <b>a communal</b> sin offering: “He shall carry the bull <b>outside the camp,</b> and burn it as he burned the first bull” (Leviticus 4:21), it requires explanation, <b>as there is no need</b> for the verse <b>to state</b> “outside the camp,” <b>since it is already stated</b> at the end of that same verse: <b>“And burn it as he burned the first bull,”</b> which indicates that all the <i>halakhot</i> of the bull brought as a sin offering of a High Priest apply to the bull brought as a communal sin offering. What then does the verse mean when it states “outside the camp”? <b>To give it a second camp,</b> i.e., it indicates that it must be removed not only from the camp of the Divine Presence, corresponding to the Temple, but also from the Levite camp, corresponding to the Temple Mount.

### Part 16
And <b>when</b> another verse <b>states with regard to</b> the removal of <b>the ash:</b> “And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes <b>outside the camp</b> to a pure place” (Leviticus 6:4), that verse also requires an explanation, <b>as there is no need</b> for the verse <b>to state</b> this, <b>since it is already stated</b> with regard to the bull brought as a sin offering of a High Priest: “Even the whole bull shall he carry outside the camp to a pure place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; <b>where the ashes are poured out shall it be burned”</b> (Leviticus 4:12). The repetition of “outside the camp” indicates that he is required <b>to give it a third camp,</b> i.e., teaching that it is burned when outside the Israelite camp, corresponding to the land outside the walls of Jerusalem.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi Shimon do with this</b> phrase, stated with regard to the bull and goat of Yom Kippur: <b>“Outside the camp”</b> (Leviticus 16:27), given that he holds that the garments do not become impure until the offering is burning? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for</b> that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It is stated here: “Outside the camp,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the red heifer: “He shall bring it <b>outside the camp”</b> (Numbers 19:3). <b>Just as here,</b> the bull and goat of Yom Kippur are burned <b>outside three camps, so too there,</b> the red heifer is burned <b>outside three camps. And just as there,</b> the red heifer is burned <b>east of Jerusalem,</b> since it must be burned “toward the front of the Tent of Meeting” (Numbers 19:4), opposite the entrance of the Temple, which is to its east,
