### Part 1
But if he <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>and thereafter severed</b> its legs, the offering is <b>disqualified</b> because some of the blood collected is from the legs, which are outside the courtyard.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: If he <b>severed</b> its legs <b>and thereafter slaughtered</b> it, is the offering <b>fit?</b> But isn’t <b>he sacrificing a blemished</b> animal? <b>Rather, say:</b> If one slaughtered the animal while it stood wholly in the courtyard, and afterward its legs moved beyond the edge of the courtyard, and then he <b>severed</b> its legs <b>and thereafter collected</b> the blood, the offering is <b>fit.</b> But if he <b>collected</b> the blood <b>and thereafter severed</b> the animal’s legs, the offering is <b>disqualified,</b> since the blood from the legs is mixed with the other blood of the animal.

### Part 3
The Gemara challenges: If he <b>severed</b> its legs <b>and thereafter collected</b> the blood, is the offering <b>fit? But doesn’t Rabbi Zeira say:</b> If one <b>slits the ear of a firstborn</b> animal with the knife after slaughter, creating a blemish, <b>and thereafter collected its blood</b> from the neck, the offering is <b>disqualified, as it is stated: “And</b> the anointed priest <b>shall take from the blood of the bull”</b> (Leviticus 4:5)? The verse indicates that the <b>bull</b> must be at the time of collection of the blood as <b>it already was</b> before slaughter, without a blemish.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Avimi says:</b> Rabbi Ami is not referring to a case where one severs the entire leg. Rather, one <b>cuts</b> the flesh <b>of the limb until he reaches the bone,</b> leaving the bone intact. This is not considered a blemish, and the animal remains fit for sacrifice.

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: Given that if he <b>collected</b> the blood <b>and thereafter severed</b> the animal’s legs, the offering is <b>disqualified,</b> perhaps <b>you</b> can <b>conclude from it</b> that <b>blood absorbed in the limbs</b> of an animal <b>is</b> considered <b>blood,</b> such that it disqualifies the offering because this blood left the Temple courtyard.

### Part 6
The Gemara responds: <b>Perhaps</b> the offering is disqualified <b>because of</b> the animal’s <b>fat</b> that is mixed with the blood in the legs. This is considered to be like meat of the offering that has left the Temple courtyard, which also disqualifies the offering.

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests: If so, perhaps <b>you</b> can <b>conclude</b> another <i>halakha</i> <b>from it:</b> In the case of <b>meat of offerings of lesser sanctity that left</b> the Temple courtyard <b>before the sprinkling of</b> the <b>blood,</b> the offering is <b>disqualified,</b> even though the meat of such offerings may be eaten outside the Temple after the blood has been sprinkled.

### Part 8
The Gemara responds: <b>Perhaps</b> the <i>halakha</i> was stated only <b>with regard to offerings of the most sacred order,</b> whose meat must be eaten inside the Temple courtyard. It proves nothing about offerings of lesser sanctity.

### Part 9
The Gemara suggests: Come and hear a proof from that which <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>offerings of the most sacred order, their slaughter is in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard, <b>and collection of their blood in a service vessel</b> is <b>in the north.</b> If one <b>stood in the south and extended his hand into the north and slaughtered</b> the offering there, <b>his slaughter</b> is <b>valid.</b> If he <b>collected</b> the blood in a similar manner, <b>his collection</b> is <b>not valid.</b> If <b>he inserted his head and most of his</b> body into the north of the courtyard and collected the blood there, it is <b>as if his entire</b> body <b>entered</b> the north. If he slaughtered the animal and it then <b>convulsed and left</b> the north <b>to the south and</b> then <b>returned</b> to the north, it remains <b>fit.</b>

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, their slaughter is</b> anywhere <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>and collection of their blood in a service vessel</b> is anywhere <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard. If one <b>stood outside and inserted his hand into</b> the courtyard <b>and slaughtered</b> the offering there, <b>his slaughter</b> is <b>valid.</b> If he <b>collected</b> the blood in a similar manner, <b>his collection</b> is <b>not valid. And</b> if he <b>inserted his head and most of his</b> body into the courtyard and collected the blood, it is <b>as if he had not entered</b> it at all. If he slaughtered the animal and it then <b>convulsed and left to the outside</b> of the courtyard <b>and returned,</b> it is <b>disqualified.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>Conclude from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that in cases of <b>meat of offerings of lesser sanctity that left</b> the Temple courtyard <b>before the sprinkling of</b> the <b>blood,</b> the offerings <b>are disqualified.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara responds: <b>Perhaps</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> the <b>tail,</b> the <b>diaphragm, and</b> the <b>two kidneys</b> of offerings of lesser sanctity, which are all burned on the altar. Since these portions are never meant to leave the Temple courtyard, they are disqualified if they leave even momentarily. It may still be that the remaining meat of such offerings is not disqualified.

### Part 12
§ <b>Shmuel’s father raised a dilemma before Shmuel:</b> If the offering was standing <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>and its legs</b> were <b>outside, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? May one slaughter it?

### Part 13
Shmuel <b>said to him: It is written: “That they may bring them to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 17:5), indicating that the offering may not be slaughtered <b>unless all of it is inside.</b>

### Part 14
His father asked him further: If one <b>suspended</b> the animal in the air <b>and slaughtered</b> it, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Shmuel <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>valid.</b> His father <b>said to him: You are mistaken. We require</b> that the <b>slaughter</b> occur <b>on</b> the <b>side</b> of the altar (see Leviticus 1:11), <b>and</b> this is <b>not</b> considered to fulfill that requirement.

### Part 15
His father asked him further: If the one slaughtering the animal <b>was suspended</b> in the air <b>and slaughtered</b> the offering while it was on the ground, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Shmuel <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>not valid.</b> His father <b>said to him: You are mistaken.</b> We require only that the <b>slaughter</b> occur <b>on</b> the <b>side</b> of the altar, <b>but not</b> that the <b>one who slaughters</b> be <b>on</b> the <b>side</b> of the altar.

### Part 16
His father asked him further: If the priest <b>was suspended</b> in the air <b>and collected</b> the blood of the offering in that position, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Shmuel <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>valid.</b> His father <b>said to him: You are mistaken. This is not</b> a normal <b>manner of ministration.</b>

### Part 17
His father asked him further: If the priest <b>suspended</b> the offering in the air after slaughter <b>and collected</b> its blood, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Shmuel <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>not valid.</b> His father <b>said to him: You are mistaken.</b> We require only that the <b>slaughter</b> occur <b>on</b> the <b>side</b> of the altar, <b>but not</b> that <b>collection</b> of the blood occur <b>on</b> the <b>side</b> of the altar.

### Part 18
<b>Abaye said: With regard to offerings of the most sacred order,</b> in <b>all of</b> those cases the offerings <b>are disqualified, except for</b> the case where one <b>was suspended</b> in the air <b>and slaughtered</b> the animal. <b>With regard to offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> in <b>all of</b> those cases the offerings <b>are fit, except for</b> the case where the priest <b>was suspended</b> in the air <b>and collected</b> the blood.

### Part 19
<b>Rava said: What is different</b> about a case where one <b>suspended</b> the animal <b>and collected</b> the blood of an <b>offering of lesser sanctity,</b> such <b>that</b> the offering is <b>fit?</b> Perhaps it is <b>because the air inside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>is considered</b> to be <b>inside</b> the courtyard for purposes of the service. But if so, then <b>with regard to offerings of the most sacred order as well,</b> let one say that <b>air</b> in the <b>north</b> of the Temple courtyard <b>is considered</b> to be in the <b>north</b> for purposes of the service.

### Part 20
<b>Rather, Rava says: Both with regard to offerings of the most sacred order and with regard to offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> they <b>are fit</b> in all of those cases <b>except</b> where one <b>suspended</b> the animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it <b>in</b> the case of <b>offerings of the most sacred order,</b> because the Torah mandates that such offerings be slaughtered on the side of the altar. And the offerings are also disqualified where the priest <b>was suspended</b> in the air <b>and collected</b> the blood, <b>both with regard to offerings of the most sacred order and with regard to offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> since this is not a normal manner of ministration.

### Part 21
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma before Rabbi Zeira:</b> If the priest was <b>inside and his fringes,</b> i.e., his hair, were <b>outside,</b> and he collected the blood, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Did you not say</b> that the verse: <b>“That they may bring them to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 17:5), indicates that an offering may not be slaughtered <b>unless all of it comes inside? Here, too,</b> the verse states with regard to the priests: <b>“When they go into the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Exodus 28:43), indicating that the priest may not perform rites <b>unless all of him comes into the Tent of Meeting.</b>

### Part 22
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If the priest <b>placed</b> the blood <b>upon the ramp</b> leading up to the altar, or if he placed it on the wall of the altar in an area <b>that</b> is <b>not opposite the base</b> of the altar, i.e., in those parts of the altar where there is no foundation; or if <b>he placed</b> the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed below</b> the red line that runs along the middle of the altar, e.g., the blood of a burnt offering, <b>above</b> the red line, <b>or</b> if he placed the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed above</b> the red line, e.g., the blood of a sin offering, <b>below</b> the red line; <b>or</b> if he placed the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed inside</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., on the golden altar or in the Holy of Holies, <b>outside</b> the Sanctuary on the external altar, <b>or</b> if he placed the blood <b>that is</b> to be <b>placed outside</b> the Sanctuary <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary, in all these cases the offering is <b>disqualified.</b> Nevertheless, <b>there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i> for</b> one who partakes of these offerings.
