### Part 1
<b>with regard to hardened</b> limbs that were dried by the fire but have not yet been reduced to ash. The mishna teaches that before midnight, such limbs should be returned to the altar. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived that midnight determines whether or not they shall be returned?

### Part 2
<b>Rav says: One verse states: All night and he shall burn</b> the burnt offering, which indicates that there is a mitzva to burn the limbs of a burnt offering all night, as the verse states: “It is the burnt offering on the pyre upon the altar all night until the morning” (Leviticus 6:2). <b>And one verse states: “All night</b> until the morning…<b>and he shall remove</b> the ashes that the fire has consumed of the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar” (Leviticus 6:2–3), which indicates that one may remove the ashes at any time during the night, including the limbs of a burnt offering that were already hardened by the fire. How can these texts be reconciled?

### Part 3
Rav explains: <b>Divide</b> the night into two parts: <b>Half of</b> the night, i.e., until midnight, is designated <b>for</b> the mitzva of <b>burning,</b> and during this time, that which is dislodged from the altar shall be returned; <b>and half of</b> the night, i.e., after midnight, is designated <b>for removing.</b>

### Part 4
With regard to Rav’s assertion that one may begin to remove the ashes only after midnight, <b>Rav Kahana raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 20a): <b>Every day</b> the priests would <b>remove</b> the ashes from <b>the altar</b> and place them on the east side of the ramp <b>at the rooster’s crow or close to</b> the time of its crowing, whether <b>before it or after it,</b> as there was no insistence on a precise time. <b>On Yom Kippur</b> they would remove the ashes <b>at midnight. On the Festivals</b> the ashes were removed even earlier, <b>at</b> the end of <b>the first watch.</b> Rav Kahana concludes his objection: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that the proper time for removing the ashes <b>by Torah law</b> is <b>from midnight, how do we advance</b> the removal of the ashes on the Festivals, <b>and how do we delay</b> their removal the rest of the year?

### Part 5
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The proper time of the removal of the ashes is based on the following: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> it <b>is stated</b> with regard to the burning of the limbs: <b>“All night”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), <b>don’t I know that</b> he may burn a burnt offering <b>until the morning?</b> If so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Until the morning”?</b> It means: <b>Add</b> another <b>morning to the morning of</b> the <b>night.</b> Arise before dawn, as that is the time for the removal of the ashes. Nevertheless, there is no specific hour fixed for performing this removal, and one may remove the ashes from the beginning of the night.

### Part 6
<b>Therefore, every day,</b> performing the removal <b>at the rooster’s crow is sufficient. On Yom Kippur, due to</b> the <b>weakness of the High Priest,</b> who must perform the entire Temple service on that day, they would hasten to remove the ashes <b>from midnight. On the Festivals,</b> during <b>which</b> there are <b>many offerings</b> on account of the masses of <b>Jewish people</b> in Jerusalem on those days, who, in order to offer their sacrifices, would <b>arrive early</b> at the Temple, they would remove the ashes beginning <b>from</b> the end of <b>the first watch, as</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> (<i>Yoma</i> 20a): <b>The call of the rooster would not arrive</b> on Festivals <b>until the Temple courtyard was filled with Jews.</b>

### Part 7
§ The Gemara previously explained the mishna as saying that limbs that were hardened by the fire but not entirely consumed are not returned to the altar if they were dislodged from it after midnight, since the mitzva of burning has been performed and the limbs are considered to have been entirely consumed. It <b>was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> engage in a dispute concerning the following matter: In the case of limbs that <b>separated</b> from upon the altar <b>before midnight and</b> were <b>returned after midnight,</b> whereby the mitzva of burning was not completed by midnight, <b>Rabba says:</b>
