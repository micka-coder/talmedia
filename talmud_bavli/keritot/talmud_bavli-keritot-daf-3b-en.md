### Part 1
<b>Rather,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where one says</b> to himself that this is <b>permitted.</b> He is under the impression that idol worship is permitted, and his unwitting act was the result of ignorance, not forgetfulness. <b>As, Rava raised a dilemma before Rav Naḥman</b> with regard to Shabbat <b>only</b> so it could be determined <b>whether to deem</b> one who is unaware of both the essence of Shabbat and the specific prohibited labors <b>liable</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin offering, <b>or whether to deem</b> him <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings. <b>But</b> as for the possibility to <b>exempt him completely,</b> he did <b>not raise</b> such <b>a dilemma before him.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Pappa says: You find</b> an act performed unwittingly with regard to idol worship <b>in</b> the case of <b>a child who was taken captive among the gentiles</b> and never taught about the Torah, <b>as</b> he <b>knows that idol worship</b> in general is <b>prohibited, but</b> with regard to <b>these</b> particular objects of <b>idol worship</b> that he is worshipping, he does <b>not know that they are prohibited.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> this ruling is stated <b>with regard to an adult,</b> i.e., one who was not captured by gentiles as a child, and it is speaking of a case <b>where he erred with regard to this verse: “You shall not make with Me gods of silver and gods of gold,</b> you shall not make for yourselves” (Exodus 20:20). This person <b>thinks</b> that <b>when bowing</b> to an idol is <b>prohibited</b> it applies only <b>to</b> an object of <b>idol worship</b> fashioned <b>of silver or gold; but</b> with regard to objects fashioned <b>of other substances,</b> such as wood or stone, it is <b>permitted. And that is</b> a case of an action that is <b>unwitting with regard to idol worship but intentional with regard to</b> the prohibited <b>rites.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said</b> a different interpretation of the mishna <b>in the name of Rav Beivai:</b> The <b><i>tanna</i> teaches the</b> general <b>category of Shabbat and the</b> general <b>category of idol worship,</b> without mentioning the details of how many sin offerings one would be liable to bring for transgressing each prohibition. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> can one infer this is the case? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches: One who engages in intercourse with a woman and her daughter, or with a married woman. But there is</b> the case of <b>one’s daughter from the woman he raped, which</b> the mishna <b>does not teach.</b> The case of a daughter from the woman one raped is included in the category of intercourse with a woman and her daughter, yet it is not taught explicitly. Evidently, it is included in the general category of intercourse with a woman and her daughter.

### Part 5
The Sages <b>say</b> in response to this inference: The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> those prohibitions <b>that are written</b> explicitly in the Torah; he <b>does not teach</b> those prohibitions <b>that are not written</b> explicitly but are derived from the verses. That is the reason he does not teach the case of intercourse with a daughter from the woman one raped; it is not because he is teaching only general categories.

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>But there is</b> the case of <b>one’s wife’s daughter, and the daughter of her daughter, and the daughter of her son, which are written</b> explicitly, <b>and</b> yet the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> them. <b>Rather,</b> you must say that <b>he teaches the</b> general <b>category of</b> intercourse with <b>a woman and her daughter,</b> which includes those cases. <b>So too, he teaches the</b> general <b>category of Shabbat and the</b> general <b>category of idol worship.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, raises a contradiction</b> between one statement <b>of</b> Rav Beivai bar Abaye <b>and</b> another statement <b>of his: Did Rav Beivai bar Abaye</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches the</b> general <b>category of Shabbat and teaches the</b> general <b>category of idol worship? But wasn’t it stated: One who offers up the limbs of</b> an offering slaughtered <b>inside</b> the Temple <b>outside</b> the Temple, i.e., he slaughtered the animal within the Sanctuary in accordance with <i>halakha</i> but sacrificed its limbs on an altar outside the Temple, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering if he did so unwittingly. Likewise, if he sacrifices <b>limbs of</b> an offering slaughtered <b>outside</b> the Temple <b>outside</b> the Temple, he is <b>liable.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And Rav Beivai bar Abaye</b> raised <b>a difficulty: If so,</b> consider <b>that which we learned</b> in the mishna: There are <b>thirty-six</b> cases <b>in the Torah</b> with regard to which one who performs the action intentionally is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i>. They are</b> actually <b>thirty-seven, as there is</b> the case of <b>one who offers up</b> the limbs of an offering slaughtered inside the Temple outside the Temple, <b>and one who offers up</b> limbs of an offering slaughtered outside the Temple outside the Temple. Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, explains the contradiction: If Rav Beivai bar Abaye maintains that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna does not tally all the relevant prohibitions but states general categories, <b>what</b> is <b>difficult to him? Let him answer</b> that <b>he teaches the category of offering up</b> in the clause: One who slaughters offerings and who sacrifices them outside the Temple. The <i>tanna</i> would not then need to list these individual transgressions.

### Part 9
The Gemara responds: <b>Are</b> these cases <b>comparable?</b> In the cases of <b>Shabbat and idol worship</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> their details <b>in their places [<i>abeinekheihon</i>],</b> on <i>Shabbat</i> 73a and <i>Sanhedrin</i> 60b, respectively. Consequently, <b>with regard to <i>karet</i>, where it is necessary</b> to mention them as part of a list of prohibitions that are punishable by <i>karet</i>, Rav Beivai bar Abaye <b>answers</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches the category of Shabbat and teaches the category of idol worship,</b> but he did not need to specify the details in this manner. By contrast, <b>with regard to bringing up</b> an offering, <b>does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach them</b> in <b>their place,</b> so <b>that</b> Rav Beivai bar Abaye can <b>answer</b> in <b>this</b> manner?

### Part 10
§ It was stated earlier that Rabbi Elazar says that Rabbi Oshaya says: Anywhere you find two different prohibitions but only one punishment of <i>karet</i> is stated for both of them you should divide the sin offering between them, i.e., if one transgressed both prohibitions unwittingly he is liable to bring a sin offering for each. In a similar vein, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma before Rabbi Zeira:</b> If there are <b>two</b> punishments of <b><i>karet</i> and</b> only <b>one prohibition</b> written with regard to a certain act, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is one liable to bring a separate sin offering for each act? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Are you saying</b> this in reference to one <b>who slaughters</b> offerings outside the Temple <b>and</b> one <b>who offered up</b> the limbs of offerings outside the Temple? These do not match your description, as <b>these are two</b> separate <b>prohibitions.</b>

### Part 11
Rabbi Zeira elaborates: <b>If</b> one considers the matter <b>according to the one who derives</b> the prohibition <b>from a verbal analogy,</b> it is as though both prohibitions are written explicitly. As <b>it is stated here</b> an expression of <b>bringing:</b> “Or who slaughters it outside the camp, and to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting he did not bring it” (Leviticus 17:3–4), <b>and it is stated there</b> an expression of <b>bringing:</b> “Who sacrifices a burnt offering or sacrifice, and to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting he did not bring it” (Leviticus 17:8–9).

### Part 12
Since there is a verbal analogy linking slaughtering an offering outside the Temple to sacrificing one outside the Temple, it follows that <b>just as there,</b> with regard to sacrificing, the Torah <b>did not</b> prescribe <b>punishment unless</b> it explicitly <b>prohibited</b> the act, as it is written: “Take heed to yourself, lest you sacrifice your burnt offerings in every place that you see” (Deuteronomy 12:13), <b>so too here,</b> with regard to slaughtering, the Torah <b>did not</b> prescribe <b>punishment unless</b> it explicitly <b>prohibited</b> the act as a separate prohibition.

### Part 13
If one considers the matter <b>according to the one who derives</b> the prohibition <b>from a juxtaposition,</b> it is also as though both prohibitions are written explicitly. The juxtaposition is that <b>the verse states: “There you shall sacrifice</b> your burnt offerings <b>and there you shall do</b> all that I command you” (Deuteronomy 12:14). Here the verse <b>juxtaposes slaughtering,</b> in the phrase: “And there you shall do,” <b>to offering up.</b> This teaches that <b>just as there,</b> with regard to offering up, the Torah <b>did not</b> prescribe <b>punishment unless</b> it explicitly <b>prohibited</b> the act, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to slaughtering, the Torah <b>did not</b> prescribe <b>punishment unless</b> it explicitly <b>prohibited</b> the act. Whether one derives the prohibition by verbal analogy or juxtaposition, it is considered as though the Torah explicitly wrote a prohibition with regard to slaughtering, and therefore this would not meet the criteria of Rabbi Yirmeya’s dilemma.

### Part 14
Rabbi Zeira continues to address Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Perhaps you are stating</b> your dilemma with regard to <b>two</b> prohibitions punishable by the <b>death</b> penalty <b>and</b> only <b>one prohibition</b> is written with regard to them, and your dilemma is whether one brings two sin offerings if one transgressed both unwittingly, despite the fact that only one prohibition is written with regard to both acts. <b>What is</b> such a circumstance? This applies in the case of <b>a necromancer,</b> who raises up the spirit of the dead, <b>and a sorcerer,</b> who places a certain bone in his mouth for it to speak of its own accord (see Leviticus 20:6, 27).

### Part 15
Rabbi Zeira further <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: This should not be a dilemma, <b>as this</b> matter is <b>a dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish. As</b> the Sages <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>, where they list those liable to be executed by stoning, <b>in</b> tractate <b><i>Sanhedrin</i></b> (53a): <b>A necromancer and a sorcerer, and</b> the following presents <b>a difficulty to us: And what is different with regard to stonings</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the case of <b>a sorcerer, but</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> the case of <b>a sorcerer with regard to</b> the list of transgressions punishable by <b><i>karet</i>,</b> thereby indicating that one is liable to bring only a single sin offering for both transgressions?

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> in tractate <i>Karetot</i> does not count the case of the sorcerer on its own <b>since both</b> the sorcerer and the necromancer <b>were stated in one prohibition:</b> “Do not turn to the necromancers and the sorcerers” (Leviticus 19:31); therefore, there is no separate obligation to bring an offering for each of them. The Gemara clarifies: <b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>say</b> the case of <b>a sorcerer and let him not say</b> the case of <b>a necromancer,</b> rather than the reverse. The Gemara explains: The <i>tanna</i> <b>maintains</b> that <b>since the verse opened with</b> the case of <b>a necromancer,</b> it is proper to list that transgression and omit the case of a sorcerer.

### Part 17
<b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> The case of the sorcerer is not included in the list of transgressions punishable by <i>karet</i> <b>since it does not involve an action,</b> but only speech, through the use of a bone, and one does not bring a sin offering for a prohibition that does not involve an action. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Reish Lakish, what is the reason he does not state</b> an explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b>

### Part 18
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Reish Lakish disagrees with the explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>because</b> the cases of a necromancer and a sorcerer <b>are divided</b> in the verse <b>with regard to</b> the issue of the <b>death</b> penalty, i.e., one is liable to receive the death penalty for transgressing either prohibition, as it is stated: “And a man also or a woman, who are a necromancer or a sorcerer shall be put to death” (Leviticus 20:27). Consequently, one would be liable to bring a separate sin offering for the unwitting transgression of either prohibition were it not for the fact that sorcery does not involve an action. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>a division of a prohibition is</b> considered <b>a division</b> that leads to separate sin offerings, whereas <b>a division of</b> separate <b>death</b> penalties <b>is not</b> considered <b>a division</b> in this regard.

### Part 19
The Gemara further asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, what is the reason he does not state</b> an explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Reish Lakish,</b> who says the prohibition with regard to a sorcerer is not counted because it does not involve an action? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>maintains: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the list of those liable to receive <b><i>karet</i>? It is Rabbi Akiva, who says: An action is not required</b> for one to be liable to bring a sin offering.

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Reish Lakish,</b> how does he respond to this claim? He could say that <b>although Rabbi Akiva does not require a significant action</b> for one to be liable to bring a sin offering, nevertheless he <b>does require a minor action.</b> The transgression of a sorcerer involves no action, as the voice emerges of its own accord, and therefore even Rabbi Akiva would not hold one liable to bring a sin offering for the unwitting violation of this prohibition.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: In the case of <b>a necromancer, what action is there in</b> this transgression? The Gemara answers: <b>The striking of his arms</b> against each other to raise the spirit of the dead <b>is</b> considered <b>an action.</b> The Gemara further asks: In the case of one who <b>blasphemes,</b> who merely speaks, <b>what action is there in</b> this transgression? Since Rabbi Akiva holds that an unwitting blasphemer is liable to bring a sin offering, this apparently indicates that no action at all is necessary. The Gemara answers: <b>The twisting of his lips</b> while he speaks <b>is</b> considered <b>an action.</b>

### Part 22
The Gemara comments: It <b>enters our mind</b> that <b>the striking of</b> the necromancer’s <b>arms</b> against each other <b>is</b> considered <b>a minor action even according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and they would deem him liable. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to idol worship, one is liable</b> to be punished <b>only for a matter that involves an action, for example where one slaughtered</b> an offering, <b>or burned</b> incense, <b>or poured</b> a libation, <b>or bowed. And</b> the following matter poses <b>a difficulty to us: Bowing does not involve an action.</b>

### Part 23
<b>And Reish Lakish said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says: An action is not required</b> for one to be liable to bring a sin offering for transgressing a prohibition. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> as <b>the bending of his height</b> when he bows <b>is</b> considered <b>an action.</b> One can conclude from here <b>by inference that Reish Lakish maintains</b> that <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis, the bending of his height is not</b> considered <b>an action.</b> If so, can it be said that <b>the striking of his arms</b> against each other, which is less of a movement than bending one’s height, <b>is</b> considered <b>an action?</b>

### Part 24
<b>But rather,</b> you must explain that <b>when Reish Lakish says the striking of his arms</b> against each other <b>is</b> considered <b>a minor action,</b> he is speaking only <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva; but according to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> it <b>is not</b> considered <b>an action.</b>

### Part 25
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> that the Rabbis hold that the necromancer does not perform an action, <b>why</b> does the mishna <b>teach</b> that the Rabbis say: The list in the mishna is <b>excluding</b> one who <b>blasphemes, as he does not perform an action,</b> but rather he sins with speech. <b>Let it teach</b> instead: The list in the mishna is <b>excluding</b> one who <b>blasphemes and a necromancer.</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches one of two</b> examples that the Rabbis could have mentioned.

### Part 26
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But</b> if that is so, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the statement of the Rabbis with regard to <b>a necromancer and let it not teach</b> the statement of the Rabbis with regard to one who <b>blasphemes.</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to mention one who <b>blasphemes,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since its</b> punishment of <b><i>karet</i> is written in the place</b> where the verse discusses <b>an offering</b> (see Numbers 15:28–30), one might <b>say</b> that in this case the Rabbis <b>concede to Rabbi Akiva</b> that one is liable to bring a sin offering despite the fact that no action is involved. To counter this, the mishna specifically mentions the exclusion of one who blasphemes to <b>teach us that</b> this is <b>not</b> the case.

### Part 27
<b>Ulla said:</b> The reason the Rabbis did not state: Excluding one who blasphemes and a necromancer, is that the action of the <b>necromancer that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> is referring <b>to</b> one who <b>burns</b> incense <b>to a demon</b> in order to raise the dead, which is a full-fledged action. <b>Rava objects to this</b> answer from Ulla: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if the necromancer burns incense to a demon, <b>this is</b> the same as <b>an idol worshipper,</b> which is already mentioned in the mishna. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The mishna is referring to one who <b>burns</b> incense <b>to a demon in order to gather it</b> together with other demons, i.e., he does not burn incense to a demon by means of a rite but in a manner of sorcery, to bring the demons to one place to then make use of them.

### Part 28
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>If so, this is</b> the same as <b>a <i>ḥover ḥever</i>,</b> one who gathers together, which is stated in the Torah as a separate prohibition (Deuteronomy 18:11) and which is a prohibition that does not carry the punishment of <i>karet</i>. Rava <b>said to him:</b> It is true that such an individual is also a <i>ḥover ḥever</i>, but <b>the Torah stated: A <i>ḥover ḥever</i> such as this,</b> who gathers demons together, is included in the category of a necromancer and therefore his punishment is death <b>by stoning,</b> and transgressing this prohibition also results in <i>karet</i>. Abaye inquired: <b>But</b> then the case of <b>a <i>ḥover ḥever</i>, which</b> is <b>a prohibition</b> that does not entail <i>karet</i>, <b>what</b> is <b>it?</b>

### Part 29
Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And a <i>ḥover ḥaver</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:11), this is referring to both <b>one</b> who uses sorcery and thereby <b>gathers large</b> beasts into one place, <b>and</b> also to <b>one</b> who <b>gathers small</b> beasts into one place, <b>and even</b> to one who <b>gathers</b> into one place <b>snakes and scorpions;</b> all of these individuals are <b>liable.</b> With regard to this prohibition <b>Abaye says:</b> In the case of <b>this one, who</b> through sorcery <b>wants to gather</b> together <b>a hornet and a scorpion,</b> this is <b>prohibited. But if they are pursuing him</b> and he merely seeks to defend himself, it is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 30
The Gemara objects: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says the bending of one’s height is</b> considered <b>an action, the twisting of</b>
