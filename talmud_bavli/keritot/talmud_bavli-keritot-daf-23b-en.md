### Part 1
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the prohibition against eating sacrificial meat in a state of ritual impurity: “But the soul that eats from the meat of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which belong to the Lord, having his impurity upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20). The phrase <b>“which belong to the Lord”</b> serves <b>to include</b> in the prohibition of an impure person consuming sacrificial food <b>the sacrificial portions,</b> which are meant to be sacrificed upon the altar and not eaten by other people. One who eats this meat while he is impure is liable to receive <i>karet</i>.

### Part 2
The Gemara explains the proof from this <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>sacrificial portions, the prohibition of</b> items that are supposed to <b>ascend</b> upon the altar <b>applies to it, and</b> with regard to the parts of the sacrificial portions that are forbidden <b>fat, the prohibition</b> against eating forbidden fat, which is punishable by <b><i>karet</i>, applies to it. And</b> nevertheless <b>the prohibition of</b> eating sacrificial food in a state of <b>impurity comes and applies</b> in addition to that prohibition. This indicates that with regard to sacrificial meat specifically, a prohibition takes effect where another prohibition already exists.

### Part 3
The Gemara adds: <b>Know that it is so, as Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>maintains</b> in general that <b>a prohibition takes effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, <b>but this statement</b> applies only with regard to a relatively <b>severe prohibition</b> taking effect <b>where</b> a relatively <b>lenient prohibition</b> already exists. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a lenient prohibition taking effect where</b> there is already an existing <b>prohibition, and that</b> original <b>prohibition is</b> more <b>severe</b> than the second one, <b>no,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi does not hold that the second prohibition takes effect. <b>And</b> yet <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> meat, <b>we have heard that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that <b>even a lenient prohibition takes effect where a severe prohibition</b> already exists.

### Part 4
The Gemara cites the source for this claim: <b>As the prohibition of misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>is</b> a relatively <b>lenient</b> prohibition, since according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi it is punishable by <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>and the prohibition</b> against eating <b>sacrificial</b> meat <b>is a severe prohibition,</b> since it is punishable by <b><i>karet</i>,and</b> yet the <b>prohibition</b> punishable by <b>death comes and takes effect where</b> there is already an existing <b>prohibition</b> punishable by <b><i>karet</i>.</b>

### Part 5
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It is stated with regard to peace offerings, which are offerings of lesser sanctity: “And the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a pleasing aroma; <b>all the fat is the Lord’s”</b> (Leviticus 3:16). This verse serves <b>to include the sacrificial portions of offerings of lesser sanctity in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property.

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: <b>And misuse</b> of consecrated property, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>is a prohibition</b> punishable by <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>and</b> yet <b>it takes effect where</b> there is already an existing <b>prohibition</b> of forbidden <b>fat, which is a prohibition</b> punishable by <b><i>karet</i>. Conclude from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> food, <b>the Merciful One revealed</b> that a prohibition takes effect where another prohibition already exists. As stated above, it is for this reason that Rabbi Shimon states in the mishna that one is liable to bring two sin offerings for eating forbidden fat that is <i>notar</i>.

### Part 7
The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The prohibition against eating <b>an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its designated time [<i>piggul</i>] does not</b> apply <b>to</b> items that are supposed to <b>ascend</b> onto the altar, <b>and</b> similarly, the prohibition against eating <b><i>notar</i> does not</b> apply <b>to</b> items that are supposed to <b>ascend</b> onto the altar? This indicates that even with regard to sacrificial meat, a prohibition does not take effect where another prohibition already exists.

### Part 8
The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather,</b> this matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i> with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, as some say</b> that Rabbi Shimon maintains that <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> meat <b>a prohibition takes effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, as indicated in the mishna. <b>And some say</b> that <b>even with regard to sacrificial</b> meat, Rabbi Shimon holds that <b>a prohibition does not take effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists.

### Part 9
The Gemara challenges: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>even with regard to sacrificial</b> meat <b>a prohibition does not take effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, <b>what does he do with</b> the verse: <b>“All the fat is the Lord’s”</b> (Leviticus 3:16), from which it was derived above that the sacrificial parts of offerings of lesser sanctity are included in the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers that <b>he interprets it</b> as referring <b>to</b> the <b>offspring of sacrificial</b> animals, <b>as he holds</b> that the <b>offspring of sacrificial</b> animals become <b>sanctified when they</b> begin to <b>exist,</b> i.e., when they are born. Since the prohibition of forbidden fat also takes effect at that time, <b>both of them,</b> i.e., the prohibitions of forbidden fat and misuse of consecrated property, <b>come</b> into effect <b>simultaneously.</b>
