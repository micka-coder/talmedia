### Part 1
<b>It should teach the opposite,</b> i.e., it should say: They made one who engages in the initial stage of intercourse like one who completes the act, as it is obvious that one who completes the act is liable.

### Part 2
The <i>tanna</i> <b>said to</b> Rav Sheshet: <b>Should I remove</b> this <i>baraita</i>, as it is apparently corrupted? Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: No;</b> do not remove the <i>baraita</i>, as <b>this</b> is what it <b>is teaching:</b> The Sages <b>rendered one who completes an atypical</b> act of intercourse <b>with an espoused maidservant, for which</b> he <b>is not liable, like one who engages in the initial stage</b> of intercourse with her <b>in the typical manner,</b> for which he is also exempt. They derived this from the fact <b>that it is written: “Lies carnally.”</b>

### Part 3
Similarly, they rendered <b>one who</b> engages <b>intentionally</b> in <b>atypical</b> intercourse <b>with a maidservant,</b> for <b>which they are</b> both <b>exempt, like one who does</b> so in a typical manner <b>unintentionally, as it is written: “Lies carnally.”</b> And they also rendered <b>one who</b> engages in intercourse <b>in an atypical manner with</b> an espoused <b>maidservant</b> while he <b>is awake,</b> for <b>which they are</b> both <b>exempt, like one who</b> does so while <b>sleeping. What is the reason?</b> They derived this from the fact <b>that it is written: “Lies carnally.”</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara concludes: It <b>has been determined</b> that <b>one who</b> engages in intercourse <b>intentionally or engages</b> in the <b>initial stage of intercourse with</b> an espoused <b>maidservant is like one who</b> does so <b>unintentionally with all those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> meaning that he is exempt. Similarly, <b>one who</b> engages in intercourse with an espoused maidservant <b>in a typical manner</b> while <b>sleeping is like one who</b> does so, while <b>sleeping, with</b> all <b>those</b> others <b>with whom relations are forbidden,</b> and he is likewise exempt. Furthermore, it has also been <b>determined</b> that <b>one who</b> engages in <b>atypical</b> intercourse <b>with</b> an espoused <b>maidservant</b> while <b>awake is like one who</b> does so <b>with all those with whom relations are forbidden, while sleeping,</b> and he is also exempt.
