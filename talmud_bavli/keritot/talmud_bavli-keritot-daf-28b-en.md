### Part 1
<b>for dessert. They said:</b> Throughout <b>all the days</b> of Yoḥanan ben Nedavai <b>there was never</b> sacrificial meat <b>left over in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> as he would ensure that it was eaten.

### Part 2
<b>The third cry</b> was: <b>Lift your heads, O gates, and let Elishama ben Pikai, the student of Pineḥas,</b> son of Elazar, son of Aaron the priest, <b>enter and serve as High Priest,</b> as he is worthy.

### Part 3
<b>The fourth cry</b> was: <b>Open</b> the <b>gates and expel Yissakhar from the village of Barkai, as he honors himself and desecrates</b> items <b>consecrated</b> to <b>Heaven. What would he do</b> to deserve such a reputation? He would <b>wrap silk [<i>shira’ei</i>] over his hands and perform the</b> Temple <b>service,</b> as he was unwilling to dirty his hands.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> ultimately <b>happened to</b> Yissakhar from the village of Barkai? <b>Yannai the king, and the queen were sitting</b> and discussing food. <b>The king said</b> that <b>goat</b> meat <b>is better</b> food than lamb meat, <b>and the queen said lamb</b> meat is the <b>better</b> food. <b>They said: Let us ask Yissakhar from the village of Barkai, as he is the High Priest and is very familiar with</b> various <b>dishes.</b>

### Part 5
<b>They asked him,</b> and <b>he said to them: If goat</b> meat <b>were better,</b> it would be <b>sacrificed as the daily offering.</b> The fact that the daily offering is lamb proves that its meat is preferable to that of goat. <b>As he spoke, he signaled</b> contemptuously <b>with his hand. The king said to</b> his attendants: <b>Since he signaled</b> contemptuously <b>with his hand, sever his right hand.</b> Yissakhar <b>gave a bribe, and</b> the official <b>severed his left hand</b> instead. <b>The king heard</b> that Yissakhar had deceived him, <b>and said: Let</b> the official <b>sever his right hand as well. Rav Yosef said: Blessed is the Merciful One, who took retribution [<i>lematrapsei</i>] on Yissakhar of the village of Barkai.</b> His punishment fit his crime; since he would not dirty his hands with sacrificial blood, both his hands were severed.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ashi said,</b> with regard to this incident: Yissakhar of the village of Barkai <b>did not study that which we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Lambs precede goats</b> almost <b>everywhere</b> in the Torah that they are both mentioned. One <b>might</b> have thought that it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> sheep <b>are more select than</b> goats. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he shall bring for his offering a goat” (Leviticus 4:28), after which it is written: <b>“And if</b> he bring <b>a lamb</b> as his offering for a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:32), which <b>teaches that both of them are equal.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Ravina said:</b> Yissakhar did <b>not even read the Torah, as it is written</b> with regard to the peace offering: <b>“If</b> he sacrifices <b>a lamb”</b> (Leviticus 3:7), and it further states: <b>“If a goat</b> is his offering” (Leviticus 3:12). These verses indicate that one is permitted to bring whichever animal he wishes, and there is no preference.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is stated: “And all your children [<i>banayikh</i>] shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children [<i>banayikh</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 54:13). The Sages interpreted this verse homiletically: Do not read: Your children [<i>banayikh</i>], but rather: Your builders [<i>bonayikh</i>], referring to the scholars who build the world through their Torah study and performance of mitzvot.
