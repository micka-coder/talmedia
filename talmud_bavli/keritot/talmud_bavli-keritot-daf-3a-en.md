### Part 1
<b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>his sister who is</b> both <b>his father’s daughter and his mother’s daughter,</b> and this serves <b>to say that one does not administer punishment</b> based <b>on</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference.</b> Although the verses state a punishment both for one who engages in intercourse with his half sister who is his father’s daughter and for his half sister who is his mother’s daughter, one cannot learn via an <i>a fortiori</i> inference that he should also be punished for engaging in intercourse with his sister from both parents, as punishments are applied only when the Torah expressly imposes them.

### Part 2
The Gemara notes: <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak,</b> who does not interpret the verses in this manner, <b>maintains</b> that <b>one administers punishment</b> based <b>on</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference. And if you wish, say</b> instead a different reason why Rabbi Yitzḥak does not require this exposition: He <b>derives</b> the <b>punishment</b> of <i>karet</i> for engaging in intercourse with a sister from both parents <b>from</b> the <b>warning,</b> i.e., the prohibition that is stated with regard to her. Just as the verse explicitly prohibited engaging in intercourse with a sister from both parents, so too, the same punishment of <i>karet</i> applies to engaging in intercourse with her as it does to engaging in intercourse with other forbidden relatives.

### Part 3
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Hoshaya says: Anywhere you find two</b> different <b>prohibitions, and</b> only <b>one</b> punishment of <b><i>karet</i></b> is stated for both of them, you should <b>divide</b> the <b>sin offering between them,</b> i.e., if one transgressed both prohibitions unwittingly he is liable to bring a sin offering for each. <b>And what is</b> this case? One who <b>blends the anointing oil</b> according to the specifications of the oil prepared by Moses in the wilderness, for purposes other than use in the Temple, <b>and</b> one who <b>applies</b> this anointing oil to the skin of a person, <b>as it is written: “Upon the flesh of man it shall not be applied,</b> neither shall you make any like it <b>according to its composition”</b> (Exodus 30:32). These are two prohibitions, one for applying the oil and the other for blending it, and <b>one <i>karet</i></b> is stated with regard to both, <b>as it is written: “Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people”</b> (Exodus 30:33).

### Part 4
The Gemara challenges this statement: <b>But</b> accordingly, <b>once</b> there are <b>separate prohibitions</b> stated in the Torah with regard to engaging in intercourse with all forbidden relatives (Leviticus, chapter 18), and at the conclusion of that passage it is written: “For whoever shall do any of these abominations, the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29), it is indicated that the punishments of <i>karet</i> or a sin offering apply to all these prohibitions. If so, <b>why do I</b> need the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> that the Merciful One writes with regard to one’s sister,</b> in a separate passage: “And they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people; he has uncovered his sister’s nakedness” (Leviticus 20:17)?

### Part 5
The Gemara explains: This verse is required to teach one <i>halakha</i> according to the opinion of the Rabbis, and one <i>halakha</i> <b>according to Rabbi Yitzḥak, per his</b> opinion. The Gemara elaborates: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, they require</b> this verse <b>to say that one does not administer punishment</b> based <b>on</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference. According to Rabbi Yitzḥak, he derives</b> that this verse comes <b>to deem</b> one <b>liable</b> to bring three separate sin offerings for unwittingly engaging in intercourse <b>with his</b> own <b>sister who is</b> also <b>his father’s sister and who is</b> also <b>his mother’s sister.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis,</b> from where do they derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: One can say <b>that they derive it from</b> the term <b>“his sister”</b> written <b>in the first clause</b> of the verse: “And if a man shall take his sister” (Leviticus 20:17). <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak holds</b> that one cannot derive a <i>halakha</i> from the term <b>“his sister”</b> written <b>in the first clause,</b> as <b>it is the manner of the verse</b> to describe the case in detail before stating the prohibition that applies to it. <b>And</b> therefore <b>he derives from</b> the term <b>“his sister”</b> written <b>in the latter clause</b> of the verse that this comes <b>to separate</b> between the prohibitions and render one liable to bring three separate sin offerings for engaging in intercourse <b>with his</b> own <b>sister who is</b> also <b>his father’s sister and who is</b> also <b>his mother’s sister.</b>

### Part 7
§ The Gemara returns to Rabbi Elazar’s statement that one who unwittingly blends the anointing oil and applies it to the skin is liable to bring two sin offerings. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: We learn</b> in the mishna <b>as well: And one who blends the</b> anointing <b>oil, and one who blends the incense, and one who applies the anointing oil</b> to his skin.

### Part 8
Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak explains his inference: <b>Why do I</b> need the <i>tanna</i> <b>to teach</b> the clause: <b>One who blends the incense, in the middle,</b> between the two cases concerning the anointing oil? Is it <b>not</b> correct that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>teaches us: Just as</b> blending the <b>incense</b> is <b>an independent prohibition and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for it by itself,</b> and to bring a sin offering for its unwitting transgression, <b>so too,</b> with regard to one <b>who blends</b> the anointing <b>oil and</b> one <b>who applies</b> the anointing oil to his skin, <b>since</b> they are each <b>an independent prohibition, one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> each action <b>by itself,</b> and to bring a sin offering for the unwitting transgression of each of them.

### Part 9
<b>And if you would say</b> the mishna uses this order because <b>it wants to teach</b> the two cases involving <b>blending together, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> those two <i>halakhot</i> in the <b>reverse</b> order: <b>One who blends the incense, and one who blends the</b> anointing <b>oil, and one who applies the anointing oil.</b> In this manner the two clauses addressing blending would be adjacent, and likewise the two clauses addressing the anointing oil would be adjacent. <b>Why</b> did the <i>tanna</i> <b>divide</b> the cases involving <b>the</b> anointing <b>oil</b> by teaching the <i>halakha</i> of one who blends the incense in between them? Is it <b>not</b> correct that <b>this teaches us that there is a separation between</b> the two prohibitions, requiring one to bring two <b>sin offerings?</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that this is the case.

### Part 10
§ The mishna included in its list of those liable to receive <i>karet</i> a male <b>who engages in intercourse with</b> another <b>male</b> or one who copulates with an animal, and a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality. The Gemara asks: <b>According to what</b> criteria <b>does</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>tally</b> the prohibitions in the mishna? Rabbi Yoḥanan explained that the tally stated in the mishna serves to teach that one who violated every prohibition against engaging in forbidden intercourse in a single lapse of awareness is liable to receive punishment for each and every one. Which individual could have committed all these transgressions?

### Part 11
The Gemara elaborates: <b>If</b> he is referring to prohibitions transgressed <b>by men,</b> then one should <b>remove</b> the case of <b>a woman who brings an animal upon her</b> to engage in bestiality, <b>and</b> if so, <b>one</b> case of <i>karet</i> <b>is lacking from</b> the tally. <b>If</b> he is referring to prohibitions transgressed <b>by women,</b> one should <b>remove from them</b> the case of a male <b>who engages in intercourse with</b> another <b>male or with an animal, and</b> if so, <b>two</b> cases of <i>karet</i> <b>are lacking from</b> the tally.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Actually,</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> is referring to prohibitions transgressed by <b>men.</b> One should remove the case of a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality, <b>and</b> instead <b>teach</b> the mishna <b>like this:</b> A male <b>who engages in intercourse with</b> another <b>male, and</b> a male <b>who brings</b> another <b>male upon him</b> to engage in intercourse. <b>And</b> this mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says</b> that one who transgresses both of these prohibitions in a single lapse of awareness is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings.

### Part 13
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches in its latter clause</b> the case of one who <b>blasphemes, and we interpret</b> this clause <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> it may be inferred that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna is <b>also</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara suggests: <b>And if you would say</b> the entire mishna <b>is</b> in fact in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, and with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> listed in <b>the first clause he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> that is not tenable, as <b>doesn’t Rabbi Abbahu say:</b> In the case of a male <b>who engages in intercourse with</b> another <b>male, and</b> a male <b>who brings</b> another <b>male upon him</b> to engage in intercourse, <b>according to</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who derives</b> these prohibitions <b>from two</b> separate <b>verses, from: “And you shall not lie with a man</b> as with a woman” (Leviticus 18:22), <b>and from: “There shall not be a sodomite of the sons of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:18), which is referring to one who engages in homosexual intercourse passively, one who transgresses both of these prohibitions in a single lapse of awareness is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin offerings.

### Part 15
Rabbi Abbahu continues: By contrast, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering, <b>as he derives</b> both prohibitions <b>from one verse: “You shall not lie [<i>tishkhav</i>] with a man,”</b> in the active form, as one can <b>read</b> the verb <b>in</b> this verse, written in the Torah without vowels, as though it stated: <b>Enable your being lain with [<i>tishakheiv</i>],</b> in the passive. Evidently, Rabbi Akiva disagrees with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael with regard to a male who engages in intercourse with another male and a male who brings another male upon him to engage in intercourse.

### Part 16
The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather, the first clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, and with regard to</b> one who <b>blasphemes he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>also teach</b> two additional cases with regard to bestiality: <b>One who copulates with an animal,</b> derived from the verse: “And you shall not lie with any beast” (Leviticus 18:23); <b>and</b> a man <b>who brings an animal upon him</b> for bestiality, derived from: “There shall not be a sodomite of the sons of Israel” (Deuteronomy 23:18), which can be interpreted as applying to all forms of male anal intercourse, including with animals.

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t Abaye say:</b> With regard to <b>one who copulates with an animal, and who brings an animal upon him</b> to engage in bestiality, <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael he is liable to</b> bring <b>only one</b> sin offering, <b>as when the verse:</b> “There shall not be a sodomite,” <b>is written, it is written with regard to men,</b> i.e., the term sodomite does not include one who engages in bestiality. In conclusion, according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, the mishna is listing prohibitions transgressed by men, and therefore one should remove from the tally the case of a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality, and add the case of a man who brings another male upon him to engage in intercourse, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael.

### Part 18
The Gemara cites another interpretation: <b>Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rav:</b> The mishna is listing prohibitions transgressed by men and not women, but one should not remove from the tally the case of a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality. The reason is that the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>teaches thirty-three</b> prohibitions for which a man brings <b>sin offerings, and he teaches</b> another <b>three</b> instances of <b><i>karet</i></b> in order <b>to complete</b> the list of transgressions for which one is liable to be punished <b>with <i>karet</i>.</b> Those three do not meet the same criteria as the other thirty-three, and the case of a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality is one of those three.

### Part 19
What supports this interpretation? <b>As</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause:</b> And one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for failure to fulfill the mitzva of bringing the <b>Paschal offering and</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision,</b> which unlike the cases of prohibitions enumerated in the mishna, are <b>positive mitzvot. Why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> the cases of the <b>Paschal offering and circumcision?</b>

### Part 20
<b>And if you say</b> the mishna mentions these positive mitzvot <b>to</b> teach that <b>one brings an offering for</b> unwittingly failing to perform <b>them, does one</b> in fact <b>bring</b> an offering in such a case? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The entire Torah is juxtaposed to idolatry, as it is written: “You shall have one law [<i>torah</i>] for him that does unwittingly. But the soul that does with a high hand,</b> whether he be home-born or a stranger, he blasphemes the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people” (Numbers 15:29–30).

### Part 21
The phrase “But the soul that does with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a stranger, he blasphemes the Lord” is referring to one who engages in idol worship, and it is derived from here: <b>Just as idol worship</b> is a situation in which the Torah says to a person: <b>Sit and refrain from action,</b> and one who transgresses this prohibition unwittingly must bring a sin offering, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>every</b> transgression in which the Torah says that one must <b>sit and refrain from action,</b> one is liable to bring a sin offering for performing the act. Accordingly, one is not liable to bring an offering for the unwitting failure to perform a positive mitzva, such as bringing the Paschal offering or circumcision.

### Part 22
The Gemara concludes its statement: <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>taught thirty-three</b> prohibitions for which a man brings <b>sin offerings,</b> which apply to <b>one who acts unwittingly, and he taught</b> another <b>three</b> instances of <b><i>karet</i></b> in order <b>to complete</b> the list of transgressions for which one is liable to be punished with <b><i>karet</i>?</b> These three instances are a woman who brings an animal upon her to engage in bestiality, one who fails to bring the Paschal offering, and one who fails to perform circumcision. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that this is the case.

### Part 23
§ The mishna’s list of prohibitions for whose unwitting violation one must bring a sin offering includes <b>one who desecrates Shabbat.</b> The Sages express their surprise at this ruling and <b>say:</b> The primary labors of <b>Shabbat are forty-less-one,</b> and one is liable to bring a sin offering for each primary labor he violates. That alone totals more than the thirty-six cases mentioned in the mishna. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> a case where his action was <b>unwitting with regard to Shabbat,</b> i.e., he was unaware it was Shabbat, <b>and</b> his action was <b>intentional with regard to</b> the prohibited <b>labors,</b> in that he was aware that the acts he performed were labors that are prohibited on Shabbat. In that case, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering, as he committed only a single error.

### Part 24
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: A soul that sins in error, from all the commandments of God that may not be performed, and performs from one of them [<i>me’aḥat mehena</i>]” (Leviticus 4:2). The expression “<i>me’aḥat mehena</i>” is interpreted in several ways. One of them is: There is an instance of <b>“them [<i>hena</i>],”</b> i.e., many unwitting transgressions, <b>which is</b> like <b>“one [<i>aḥat</i>],”</b> a single unwitting transgression, in that one is liable to bring only one sin offering. How so? When one performed many labors where his action was <b>unwitting with regard to Shabbat but</b> his action was <b>intentional with regard to</b> the prohibited <b>labors,</b> he brings only one sin offering. That is the case referred to in the mishna.

### Part 25
The Gemara challenges: <b>But let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> a case where his action was <b>intentional with regard to Shabbat,</b> i.e., he knew it was Shabbat, <b>but</b> his action was <b>unwitting with regard to</b> the prohibited <b>labors,</b> as he was unaware they were prohibited. In that case, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that he is liable</b> to bring <b>forty-less-one</b> sin offerings, one for each primary category of labor.

### Part 26
The Gemara elaborates that this is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And performs from one of them.”</b> This teaches that there are <b>times when</b> one is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>one</b> sin offering <b>for all</b> of his transgressions, <b>and</b> there are <b>times when</b> one is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for each and every</b> transgression. And <b>it is</b> further <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There is <b>“one [<i>aḥat</i>],”</b> i.e., the transgression of one prohibition, <b>which is</b> like <b>“them [<i>hena</i>],”</b> i.e., many unwitting transgressions, in that one is liable to bring multiple sin offerings. How so? When one performs many labors where his action was <b>intentional with regard to Shabbat but</b> his action was <b>unwitting with regard to</b> the prohibited <b>labors,</b> he brings multiple sin offerings.

### Part 27
The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i> prefers</b> to state the case of one who performed many labors where his action was <b>unwitting with regard to Shabbat but</b> it was <b>intentional with regard to</b> the prohibited <b>labors,</b> in order to emphasize <b>that he is not exempt from</b> bringing <b>at least</b> one <b>sin offering,</b> even though he performed the acts of labor intentionally.

### Part 28
The Gemara notes: <b>And likewise, you find</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna taught in this manner <b>with regard to idol worship, as he teaches</b> liability to bring one sin offering, despite the fact that the sinner may have performed four prohibited rites: Slaughtering, burning incense, pouring libations, and bowing. How so? This was a case where, as with Shabbat, his actions were <b>unwitting with regard to idol worship,</b> as he did not know he was worshipping an idol, <b>but</b> they were <b>intentional with regard to</b> the prohibited <b>rites,</b> i.e., he was aware these rites are prohibited.

### Part 29
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of performing an act <b>unwittingly with regard to idol worship? If we say</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he was standing in a house of idol worship and thought</b> that <b>it was a synagogue and bowed</b> there, and it turned out that he bowed toward an idol, in this situation he commits no transgression: Since <b>his heart was</b> directed <b>toward Heaven</b> it is not even an unwitting transgression.

### Part 30
<b>Rather,</b> one might say it is referring to a case <b>where he saw a statue [<i>andarta</i>]</b> in the image of the king <b>and bowed to it.</b> Again, what are the circumstances of this case? <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a situation <b>where</b> he bowed because <b>he accepted</b> that image <b>upon himself as a god,</b> he engaged in idol worship intentionally and therefore <b>he is subject to</b> death by <b>stoning,</b> and he is not required to bring a sin offering. <b>And if he did not accept</b> that image <b>upon himself as a god</b> and bowed merely in deference to the monarch, <b>it is a meaningless</b> act, not idol worship at all.

### Part 31
<b>Rather,</b> it is referring to a case where one bowed <b>out of love</b> for someone who requested that he bow before the statue, <b>or out of fear</b> of someone demanding of him to do so. He was under the impression that unless he wholeheartedly has the intention to worship the idol there is no prohibition involved. This is an unwitting transgression.

### Part 32
The Gemara comments: <b>This works out well according to Abaye, who says:</b> One who bows to an idol out of love or fear is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering. <b>But according to Rava, who says:</b> One who bows to an idol out of love or fear is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a sin offering, <b>what can be said?</b> What are the circumstances of an unwitting transgression with regard to idol worship?
