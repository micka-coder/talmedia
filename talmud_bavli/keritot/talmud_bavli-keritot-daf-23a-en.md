### Part 1
<b>Two</b> people <b>do not bring one guilt offering,</b> as one may not sacrifice atonement offerings conditionally.

### Part 2
If one had <b>a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat and a piece of non-sacred</b> meat, and <b>he ate one of them and does not know which of them he ate, he brings a provisional guilt offering,</b> as perhaps he ate the forbidden fat. If he then <b>ate the second</b> piece, <b>he brings a sin offering,</b> as it is certain that he ate the fat. If <b>one</b> person <b>ate the first</b> piece <b>and another</b> person <b>came and ate the second</b> piece, <b>this</b> person <b>brings a provisional guilt offering and that</b> person <b>brings a provisional guilt offering;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Shimon says: Both of them bring one sin offering</b> as partners, and they stipulate that the sin offering should be credited to the one who ate the fat. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Two</b> people <b>do not bring one sin offering.</b>

### Part 3
If one had <b>a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat and a piece of sacrificial</b> permitted fat and <b>he ate one of them and does not know which of them he ate, he brings a provisional guilt offering,</b> as perhaps he ate the forbidden fat. If he then <b>ate the second</b> piece, <b>he brings a sin offering,</b> as he certainly ate the fat, <b>and a definite guilt offering</b> for misuse of consecrated property. If <b>one</b> person <b>ate the first</b> piece <b>and another</b> person <b>came and ate the second</b> piece, <b>this</b> person <b>brings a provisional guilt offering and that</b> person <b>brings a provisional guilt offering. Rabbi Shimon says: Both of them bring a sin offering and a guilt offering</b> as partners, and they stipulate that each offering should be credited to the one who is liable to bring it. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Two</b> people <b>do not bring one sin offering and</b> one <b>guilt offering.</b>

### Part 4
If one had <b>a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat and a piece of sacrificial</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> and <b>he ate one of them and does not know which of them he ate, he brings a sin offering</b> as he certainly ate forbidden fat. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> He <b>also</b> brings <b>a provisional guilt offering,</b> as perhaps he ate the sacrificial fat, in accordance with his opinion that one brings a provisional guilt offering even in the case of uncertainty with regard to misuse of consecrated property. If he then <b>ate the second</b> piece, <b>he brings two sin offerings,</b> as he ate two pieces of forbidden fat, <b>and a definite guilt offering</b> for misuse of consecrated property.

### Part 5
If <b>one</b> person <b>ate the first</b> piece <b>and another</b> person <b>came and ate the second</b> piece, <b>this</b> person <b>brings a sin offering and that</b> person <b>brings a sin offering. Rabbi Akiva says: This</b> person <b>and that</b> person each <b>bring a provisional guilt offering</b> as well, due to the uncertainty as to which of them ate the sacrificial fat. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: This</b> person <b>brings a sin offering and that</b> person <b>brings a sin offering and both of them bring one guilt offering</b> as partners, and they stipulate that the offering should be credited to the one who ate the sacrificial fat. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The two of them do not bring one guilt offering.</b>

### Part 6
If one had <b>a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat and a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> that is <b><i>notar</i>,</b> an offering whose designated time has passed for which one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> if he ate it intentionally and liable to bring a sin offering if he ate it unwittingly, and <b>he ate one of them and does not know which of them he ate, he brings a sin offering,</b> as he certainly ate forbidden fat, <b>and a provisional guilt offering,</b> due to the possibility that he ate the <i>notar</i>. If he then <b>ate the second</b> piece, <b>he brings three sin offerings,</b> two for the forbidden fat and one for the prohibition against eating <i>notar</i>.

### Part 7
If <b>one</b> person <b>ate the first</b> piece <b>and another</b> person <b>came and ate the second</b> piece, <b>this</b> person <b>brings a sin offering and a provisional guilt offering,</b> as he certainly ate forbidden fat and it is uncertain whether he ate the <i>notar</i>, <b>and that</b> person <b>brings a sin offering and a provisional guilt offering. Rabbi Shimon says: This</b> person <b>brings a sin offering and that</b> person <b>brings a sin offering and both of them bring one</b> additional <b>sin offering</b> as partners, and they stipulate that the offering should be credited to the one who ate the <i>notar</i>. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Two</b> people <b>do not bring any sin offering that comes</b> as atonement <b>for a sin.</b>

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that in a case where there was a piece of forbidden fat and a piece of non-sacred meat and each piece was eaten by a different person, Rabbi Shimon maintains that both of them bring one sin offering by stipulating that the sin offering is credited to the one who ate the fat, whereas Rabbi Yosei says that two people do not bring one sin offering. <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: According to Rabbi Yosei, it is</b> apparently <b>a sin offering that they both do not bring,</b> whereas <b>they do both bring a provisional guilt offering.</b> If so, his opinion <b>is</b> the same as that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who explicitly stated that each of them brings a provisional guilt offering.

### Part 9
<b>And if you would say</b> that there is a difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Rabbi Yosei and the first <i>tanna</i> with regard to the requirement of <b>one piece from two pieces,</b> i.e., according to Rabbi Yosei only the first individual is liable to bring a provisional guilt offering, as he had two pieces before him, whereas the second is exempt, since there was only one piece before him when he ate it, this cannot be correct: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: This</b> person <b>brings a provisional guilt offering and that</b> person <b>brings a provisional guilt offering.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava in response: <b>This</b> is what the mishna <b>teaches us, that who is the first <i>tanna</i>?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b>

### Part 10
§ The mishna discusses the case of <b>a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat and a piece of sacrificial</b> permitted fat, the case of <b>a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat and a piece of sacrificial</b> forbidden <b>fat,</b> and the case of <b>a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat and a piece of</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> that is <b><i>notar</i>.</b> In the final case, if someone ate one of the pieces and then ate the second piece, he brings three sin offerings, two for the forbidden fat and one for the prohibition against eating <i>notar</i>. <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: And let him also bring a definite guilt offering</b> for misuse of consecrated property, <b>as <i>notar</i> is sacrificial</b> food. Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the piece <b>does not have the value of one <i>peruta</i>,</b> and one is not liable for misusing consecrated property of such little value.

### Part 11
Rava raised a difficulty to Rav Naḥman: <b>But at the outset</b> of the mishna <b>we are dealing with</b> a piece <b>that does have the value of one <i>peruta</i>, as</b> it <b>teaches</b> that if one ate both a piece of forbidden fat and a piece of sacrificial permitted fat, he brings <b>a definite guilt offering</b> for misuse of consecrated property. Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>That</b> clause of the mishna <b>is</b> referring to <b>a piece that is not <i>notar</i>,</b> and that piece is <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b> The case of the piece of <i>notar</i> is different. Since it has been left over for a while, most people would not eat it, and it is no longer worth one <i>peruta</i>.

### Part 12
Rava raised another difficulty to Rav Naḥman: <b>But</b> the mishna (13b) states: <b>There is</b> a case where <b>one performs one</b> act of <b>eating</b> and is liable for having violated five transgressions, and that mishna <b>teaches</b> that the case is where a ritually impure person ate forbidden fat that was <b><i>notar</i></b> from sacrificial meat on Yom Kippur, <b>and it teaches</b> that he <b>brings four sin offerings and one guilt offering.</b> Since the guilt offering is for misusing consecrated property, the piece of meat, which is <i>notar</i>, is evidently worth at least one <i>peruta</i>.

### Part 13
Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>That</b> mishna is referring <b>to</b> an act of <b>excessive</b> eating, i.e., to a large piece of meat that is <i>notar</i>, which is worth one <i>peruta</i>, <b>and this</b> mishna here is referring <b>to</b> an act of <b>light</b> eating, i.e., a small piece of meat that is <i>notar</i>, which is not worth one <i>peruta</i>, <b>and</b> therefore it is <b>not difficult.</b> Alternatively, <b>that</b> mishna is referring <b>to</b> <i>notar</i> <b>in the rainy season,</b> when the meat does not spoil so quickly and therefore it is still worth one <i>peruta</i>, and <b>this</b> mishna here is referring <b>to</b> <i>notar</i> <b>in the summer,</b> when it spoils quickly.

### Part 14
§ The mishna further teaches with regard to the case of a piece of forbidden fat and a piece of forbidden fat that is <i>notar</i>, that if <b>one</b> person <b>ate the first</b> piece and another ate the second piece, Rabbi Shimon says: Each brings a sin offering for having eaten forbidden fat, and they bring an additional sin offering for the transgression of eating <i>notar</i>, with the stipulation that the offering is credited to the one who ate the <i>notar</i>. <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman:</b> This indicates that the prohibition of <i>notar</i> takes effect despite the fact that the prohibition of forbidden fat already applied to this piece. <b>And did Rabbi Shimon say</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists?

### Part 15
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: One who</b> unwittingly <b>eats</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass on Yom Kippur is exempt</b> from bringing a sin offering for the sin of eating on Yom Kippur because the prohibition against eating on Yom Kippur does not take effect upon the meat of an animal carcass, which is already prohibited?

### Part 16
<b>Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where he ate a kidney with its</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b> Since the kidney is not forbidden fat, the prohibition against eating <i>notar</i> applies with regard to the kidney. The Gemara asks: <b>But even</b> with regard to <b>a kidney with its</b> forbidden <b>fat, the prohibition of</b> items that are supposed to <b>ascend</b> upon the altar <b>applies to it,</b> i.e., it is already forbidden for consumption because it is supposed to be burned on the altar. Consequently, <b>how does the prohibition of <i>notar</i> come</b> and <b>apply to it?</b>

### Part 17
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon maintains that <i>notar</i> is a severe prohibition, and</b> therefore it <b>applies where</b> the relatively <b>lenient prohibition of</b> items that are supposed to <b>ascend</b> upon the altar has already taken effect, this cannot be correct. The Gemara explains: <b>But</b> the prohibition of eating <b>an animal carcass is a lenient prohibition,</b> as it is punishable merely by lashes, <b>and</b> eating on <b>Yom Kippur is a severe prohibition,</b> as its violation is punishable by <i>karet</i>; <b>and</b> yet according to Rabbi Shimon <b>the prohibition</b> against eating on <b>Yom Kippur, which is severe, does not come</b> and <b>apply where</b> the prohibition of <b>an animal carcass, which is lenient,</b> has already taken effect.

### Part 18
<b>Rather,</b> one must say that specifically <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> food <b>the Merciful One revealed that a prohibition takes effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists.
