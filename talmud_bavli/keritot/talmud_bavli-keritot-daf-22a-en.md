### Part 1
<b>where</b> the blood was <b>separated</b> from a person. By contrast, <b>when Rav</b> Sheshet <b>said</b> that one need not abstain from human blood even <i>ab initio</i>, he was referring to a case <b>where</b> it was <b>not separated</b> from a person. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>blood was on a loaf</b> of bread, one <b>may scrape off</b> the blood <b>and</b> then <b>consume</b> the bread. If blood <b>was between</b> the <b>teeth, he may suck</b> it <b>and swallow</b> it <b>without concern.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Some teach this</b> statement <b>of Rav Sheshet with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>as it is taught:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one who consumes</b> the <b>milk</b> of <b>bipeds would violate a prohibition. And</b> this conclusion could be derived based upon <b>a logical inference: Just as</b> with regard to <b>a non-kosher animal, where you were lenient with regard to its contact,</b> i.e., it cannot render people or items impure through contact when it is alive, <b>you were stringent with regard to its milk,</b> which is prohibited, so too in the case of <b>bipeds, where you were stringent with regard to their contact,</b> as living people can render other people and objects impure, <b>isn’t it logical that you should be stringent with regard to their milk?</b>

### Part 3
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And these are they which are impure to you”</b> (Leviticus 11:29), which indicates that <b>these</b> animals enumerated in that chapter are <b>non-kosher</b> and their milk is forbidden for consumption, <b>but the milk of bipeds is not impure</b> but <b>rather pure,</b> i.e., kosher.

### Part 4
Furthermore, one might have thought that <b>I should exclude</b> only <b>the milk</b> of women from forbidden status, as the forbidden status of milk <b>does not</b> apply <b>equally to all</b> creatures, since the milk of kosher animals is permitted, but <b>I should not exclude</b> human <b>blood</b> from the prohibition against consuming blood, <b>which</b> does apply <b>equally to all</b> creatures, since even the blood of kosher animals is forbidden. Consequently, <b>the verse states: “And these are they which are impure to you,”</b> which indicates that <b>this is impure, but the blood of bipeds is not impure</b> but <b>rather pure,</b> i.e., kosher. It was in this context that <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> With regard to the blood of bipeds, <b>there is not even a command to abstain</b> from consuming it <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 5
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Ḥullin</i> 109a): One who wants to eat <b>the heart</b> of a slaughtered animal <b>tears it and removes its blood,</b> and only then may he cook it and eat it. If <b>he did not tear</b> the heart before cooking it and he ate it, <b>he does not violate</b> the prohibition and is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for consuming blood. The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav says: They taught</b> this <b>only with regard to the heart of a bird, since it does not contain an olive-bulk</b> of blood. <b>But the heart of an animal, which does contain an olive-bulk</b> of blood, <b>is forbidden and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for its</b> consumption.

### Part 6
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> cited above: With regard to <b>blood of the spleen, blood of the heart, blood of the kidneys,</b> and <b>blood of limbs,</b> all <b>these are</b> forbidden for consumption <b>by</b> a regular <b>prohibition,</b> punishable by lashes, but their consumption is not punishable by <i>karet</i>. By contrast, the <b>blood of bipeds,</b> i.e., human beings, and the <b>blood of repugnant creatures and crawling things</b> are <b>forbidden but one is not liable for</b> their consumption. This proves that one is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for consuming the blood of the heart.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers that <b>when</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>one is not liable for</b> consuming the blood of the heart, it is referring <b>to its</b> own <b>blood,</b> i.e., the blood absorbed in the walls of the heart. By contrast, <b>when Rav said</b> that one is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, he was referring to blood <b>that comes from the outside,</b> i.e., from elsewhere in the body, and which is found in the cavity of the heart.

### Part 8
The Gemara challenges: <b>Its</b> own <b>blood is</b> the same as the <b>blood of limbs,</b> which is already included in the list. What is the difference between the blood absorbed in the walls of the heart and blood absorbed in any other limb? The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning, doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the blood of</b> the <b>kidneys, and</b> yet <b>it</b> also <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the blood of limbs? Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the blood of the kidneys, <b>and then teaches</b> the principle with regard to the blood of limbs. <b>Here too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the blood of the heart, <b>and then teaches</b> the principle with regard to the blood of limbs.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>From where does</b> blood <b>come to</b> the heart <b>from outside? Rabbi Zeira said: At the time when the soul departs,</b> i.e., when the animal is dying, the heart <b>draws [<i>sharif</i> ]</b> blood from elsewhere, and one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for consuming this blood.

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>blood</b> that spurted during bloodletting with <b>which the soul departs, one is liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> consuming <b>it</b> intentionally or to bring a sin offering for consuming it unwittingly. <b>It was stated: What</b> is defined as the <b>blood</b> that spurts during <b>bloodletting upon which the soul depends,</b> whose consumption entails <i>karet</i>? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: As long as it is spurting</b> forcefully, it is included in this category of blood. <b>Reish Lakish says: From the</b> last <b>black drop and onward,</b> i.e., even before the blood spurts out forcefully, it is included in this category. The first drops of blood are black, and once these have ended and the first red drops have begun to emerge, it is the blood upon which the soul depends.

### Part 11
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> defined as <b>blood</b> that spurts during <b>bloodletting with which the soul departs? As long as it is spurting</b> forcefully, it is considered this type of blood. This <b>excludes blood of exudate,</b> i.e., that oozes from the animal after the spurt concludes, <b>because</b> at this stage the blood merely <b>flows</b> rather than spurting forcefully. The Gemara infers: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that <b>even</b> with regard to the <b>first and last</b> appearances of blood to emerge, if <b>it flows it is considered as blood of exudate?</b> This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> serves <b>to exclude</b> only <b>black blood; but</b> with regard to the <b>first and last</b> appearances of red <b>blood,</b> which emerge, respectively, after the black blood but before the blood spurts and after the blood is no longer spurting forcefully, <b>even though it flows, this is</b> considered <b>blood</b> with which <b>the soul</b> departs.

### Part 13
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> defined as the <b>first</b> appearance of <b>blood? As long as it is spurting</b> forcefully, it is considered the first appearance of blood. This <b>excludes</b> the <b>first and last</b> appearances of blood, <b>because</b> that blood <b>flows.</b> This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish.</b> The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish could <b>say to you</b> that this matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is the blood</b> with which <b>the soul</b> departs? <b>As long as it is spurting</b> out, it is considered this type of blood; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Elazar. Rabbi Shimon says: From the</b> last <b>black drop and onward</b> it is considered blood with which the soul departs.

### Part 14
The Gemara mentions a related <i>halakha</i> involving blood. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: “And drinks the blood of the slain”</b> (Numbers 23:24). This teaches that the blood that is considered a halakhically recognized liquid, and therefore renders other items susceptible to ritual impurity, is only blood that is exuded after death. This serves to <b>exclude blood</b> that <b>spurts</b> out forcefully at the time of the slaughter, before the animal is actually dead. Consequently, this type of blood <b>does not render seeds susceptible to</b> ritual impurity.

### Part 15
§ The Gemara returns to the prohibition against consuming blood. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma before Rabbi Zeira:</b> If <b>one performed bloodletting upon an animal and received its blood in two cups,</b> from which he drank, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>With regard to the first</b> cup, <b>everyone agrees</b> that he is <b>liable,</b> as it contains blood that spurted forcefully. <b>With regard to the last</b> cup, which does not contain blood that spurted forcefully from the animal, <b>is he liable or not?</b>

### Part 16
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, as it was stated:</b> If <b>one performed bloodletting upon an animal and received its blood in two cups, Reish Lakish says</b> that he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two sin offerings</b> if he drank the contents of the cups in two lapses of awareness, as one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> even for blood that emerges after spurting; <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan says he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering, for the blood in the first cup.

### Part 17
§ The mishna teaches that one is not liable for consuming blood of exudate, i.e., that oozes from the neck of the animal after the initial spurt of blood concludes. <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> one <b>liable in</b> the case of <b>blood of exudate.</b> The Gemara adds that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Rabbi Yehuda concedes with regard to atonement</b> that if one sacrifices an offering and the priest sprinkles the blood of exudate on the corners of the altar, the blood does not atone. This is <b>as it is stated: “For it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the soul”</b> (Leviticus 17:11), which teaches that <b>blood with which the soul departs,</b> i.e., the blood that spurts immediately upon slaughter, <b>atones, but</b> blood <b>with which the soul does not depart,</b> i.e., the blood that drains out after the initial spurt, <b>does not atone.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: We learn</b> this in a <i>baraita</i>, <b>as well, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: “And any man from the house of Israel, or from the stranger who resides among them, who consumes any blood, I will set My face against that soul that consumes blood, and will cut him off from among his people” (Leviticus 17:10). The verse could simply have stated <b>“blood”; what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “any blood”?</b>

### Part 19
The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>Since it is stated: “For it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the soul,” I have</b> derived <b>nothing other than</b> the fact that consuming the <b>blood of sacrificial</b> animals <b>with which the soul departs</b> renders one liable to receive <i>karet</i>, <b>as</b> this blood <b>atones. From where</b> is it derived that the same applies to <b>blood of non-sacred</b> animals <b>and blood of exudate? The verse states: “Any blood.” Who is</b> presumed to be the author of any <b>unattributed</b> <i>baraita</i> found in the <b><i>Sifra</i>,</b> a collection of halakhic midrash on Leviticus, which is the source of this <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is Rabbi Yehuda.</b> This proves that according to Rabbi Yehuda, blood of exudate does not effect atonement.

### Part 20
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> This mishna resumes discussion of the provisional guilt offering addressed in the previous chapter. <b>Rabbi Akiva deems</b> one <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a provisional guilt offering for</b> a case where he is <b>uncertain</b> whether he is guilty of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, a transgression that renders one liable to bring a definite guilt offering (see Leviticus 5:15). <b>And the Rabbis deem him exempt,</b> as one brings a provisional guilt offering only in a case of uncertainty as to whether he is liable to bring a sin offering, not a guilt offering. <b>And Rabbi Akiva concedes that one does not bring</b> payment for <b>his misuse until it becomes</b> definitely <b>known to him</b> that he is guilty of misuse, <b>as</b> then <b>he will bring a definite guilt offering with</b> his payment.

### Part 21
<b>Rabbi Tarfon said: For what</b> purpose <b>does that</b> person <b>bring two guilt offerings,</b> one provisional and one definite? <b>Rather,</b> at the outset <b>one brings</b> the payment for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>and its</b> additional payment of <b>one-fifth,</b> as mandated by Torah law, <b>and he will</b> then <b>bring a guilt offering</b> worth <b>two <i>sela</i> and say: If</b> it is <b>certain</b> that <b>I misused</b> consecrated property, <b>this is</b> payment for <b>my misuse and this is my</b> definite <b>guilt offering. And if</b> it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>I misused</b> consecrated property, <b>the money is a contribution</b> to the Temple fund for the purchase of communal offerings <b>and the guilt offering</b> is <b>provisional, as from the</b> same <b>type</b> of animal <b>that one brings</b> a guilt offering <b>for</b> a case where it is <b>known</b> to him that he is guilty of misuse, he likewise <b>brings</b> a guilt offering <b>for</b> a case where it is <b>unknown</b> to him.

### Part 22
<b>Rabbi Akiva says: The statement of</b> Rabbi Tarfon <b>appears</b> correct <b>in</b> the case of <b>minimal misuse,</b> but in a case <b>where he is confronted with</b> a case of <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>misuse</b> valued at <b>ten thousand dinars, would it not be preferable for him that he will</b> now <b>bring</b> a provisional <b>guilt offering</b> valued <b>at two <i>sela</i> and he will not bring</b> payment now for <b>uncertain misuse</b> valued <b>at ten thousand dinars?</b> The mishna concludes: Apparently, <b>Rabbi Akiva concedes to Rabbi Tarfon in</b> the case of <b>minimal misuse.</b> He agrees that at the outset one brings payment for misuse and its additional payment of one-fifth, and conditionally brings a guilt offering.
