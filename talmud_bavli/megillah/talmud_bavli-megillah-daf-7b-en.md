### Part 1
<b>You have fulfilled</b> two mitzvot <b>through us, our teacher:</b> The mitzva of: <b>“And sending portions one to another,”</b> and the mitzva of: <b>“And gifts to the poor,”</b> as Rabbi Oshaya was poor and this was a substantial gift.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabba sent</b> Purim portions from the house of the Exilarch <b>to Marei bar Mar in the hands of Abaye,</b> who was his nephew and student. The Purim portions consisted of <b>a sack [<i>taska</i>] full of dates [<i>kashva</i>] and a cupful of roasted flour [<i>kimḥa de’avshuna</i>]. Abaye said to him: Now, Mari will say</b> the popular expression: Even <b>if a farmer becomes the king, the basket does not descend from his neck.</b> Rabba was named the head of the yeshiva in Pumbedita, and nevertheless, he continued to send very plain gifts, because he was impoverished.

### Part 3
Marei bar Mar <b>sent back to him a sack full of ginger and a cupful of long peppers [<i>pilpalta arikha</i>],</b> a much more expensive gift. <b>Abaye said</b> to him: <b>The master,</b> Rabba, <b>will now say: I sent him sweet</b> items <b>and he sent me pungent</b> ones.

### Part 4
In describing that same incident, <b>Abaye said: When I left</b> the <b>house of the master,</b> Rabba, to go to Marei bar Mar, <b>I was</b> already <b>satiated.</b> However, <b>when I arrived there</b> at Marei bar Mar’s house, <b>they served me sixty plates of sixty kinds of cooked dishes, and I ate sixty portions from</b> each of <b>them. The last dish was called pot roast, and</b> I was still so hungry that <b>I wanted to chew the plate afterward.</b>

### Part 5
And in continuation <b>Abaye said: This</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say: The poor</b> man <b>is hungry and does not know</b> it, as Abaye was unaware how hungry he had been in his master’s house. <b>Alternatively,</b> there is another appropriate, popular expression: <b>Room</b> in the stomach <b>for sweets</b> can always be <b>found.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara relates that <b>Abaye bar Avin and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Avin would exchange their meals with each other</b> to fulfill their obligation of sending portions on Purim.

### Part 7
<b>Rava said: A person is obligated to become intoxicated</b> with wine <b>on Purim until he</b> is so intoxicated <b>that he does not know</b> how to distinguish <b>between cursed is Haman and blessed is Mordecai.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabba and Rabbi Zeira prepared a Purim feast with each other,</b> and <b>they became intoxicated</b> to the point that <b>Rabba arose and slaughtered Rabbi Zeira. The next day,</b> when he became sober and realized what he had done, Rabba <b>asked</b> God <b>for mercy, and revived him. The next year,</b> Rabba <b>said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: <b>Let</b> the <b>Master come and let us prepare the Purim feast with each other. He said to him: Miracles do not happen each and every hour,</b> and I do not want to undergo that experience again.

### Part 9
<b>Rava said: A Purim feast that one ate at night did not fulfill his obligation. What is the reason? “Days of feasting and gladness”</b> (Esther 9:22) <b>is written,</b> i.e., days and not nights. The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ashi was sitting before Rav Kahana</b> his teacher on Purim, and <b>it grew dark and the Sages</b> who usually came to study with him <b>did not come.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: What is the reason that the Sages did not come</b> today? Rav Kahana answered: <b>Perhaps they are preoccupied with the Purim feast.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Wasn’t it possible</b> for them <b>to eat</b> the feast <b>at night</b> on Purim, instead of being derelict in their Torah study on Purim day? Rav Kahana <b>said to him: Didn’t the master learn that which Rava said: A Purim feast that one ate at night did not fulfill his obligation?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Did Rava say that?</b> Rav Kahana <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rav Ashi then <b>learned it from him forty times until</b> he remembered it so well that <b>it seemed to him as if it were placed in his purse.</b>

### Part 10
mishna The previous mishna concluded with the formula: The difference between…is only, thereby distinguishing between the <i>halakhot</i> in two different cases. The following <i>mishnayot</i> employ the same formula and distinguish between the <i>halakhot</i> in cases unrelated to Purim and the Megilla. The first is: <b>The difference between Festivals and Shabbat</b> with regard to the labor prohibited on those days <b>is only</b> in <b>preparing food alone.</b> It is permitted to cook and bake in order to prepare food on Festivals; however, on Shabbat it is prohibited.

### Part 11
gemara The Gemara infers <b>that with regard to the matter of</b> actions that <b>facilitate preparation of food,</b> e.g., sharpening a knife for slaughter, <b>this,</b> Shabbat, <b>and that,</b> Festivals, <b>are equal,</b> in that actions that facilitate preparation of food are prohibited.

### Part 12
The Gemara comments: If so, <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The difference between Festivals and Shabbat is only</b> is <b>preparing food. Rabbi Yehuda permits even</b> actions that <b>facilitate preparation of food</b> on Festivals.

### Part 13
The Gemara elaborates. <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the first <i>tanna</i>?</b> It is as the <b>verse states:</b> “Except that which every person must eat, only that may be done for you” (Exodus 12:16). <b>“That”</b> is permitted, <b>and not</b> actions that <b>facilitate</b> it. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda says: “For you”</b> means <b>for you, for all your needs.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> for <b>the other,</b> first, <i>tanna</i> <b>too, isn’t it written: “For you”?</b> The Gemara answers: He infers: <b>For you, and not for gentiles; for you, and not for dogs.</b> It is forbidden to perform labors for the sake of gentiles, or for animals, even if it is to feed them.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks further: <b>And</b> for <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yehuda, <b>too, isn’t it written: “That,”</b> which is a restrictive term that limits the application of a particular <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>It is written: “That,”</b> which is restrictive, <b>and it is written: “For you,”</b> which is inclusive. Rabbi Yehuda resolves the conflict between the two: <b>Here,</b> the word: “That,” is referring <b>to</b> actions that <b>facilitate,</b> in <b>which it is possible to perform them on the Festival eve</b> but which are prohibited on the Festival; <b>there,</b> the phrase: “For you,” is referring <b>to</b> actions that <b>facilitate,</b> in <b>which it is impossible to perform them on the Festival eve</b> and which are permitted even on the Festival.

### Part 16
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between Shabbat and Yom Kippur</b> with regard to the labor prohibited on those days <b>is only that</b> in <b>this</b> case, i.e., Shabbat, <b>its intentional</b> desecration is punishable <b>at the hand of Man,</b> as he is stoned by a court based on the testimony of witnesses who forewarned the transgressor; <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, i.e., Yom Kippur, <b>its intentional</b> desecration is punishable at the hand of God, <b>with <i>karet</i>.</b>

### Part 17
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers <b>that with regard to the matter of payment</b> of damages, both <b>this,</b> Shabbat, <b>and that,</b> Yom Kippur, <b>are equal</b> in that one is exempt in both cases. If one performs an action on Shabbat that entails both a prohibited labor and damage to another’s property, since his transgression is punishable by death, he is exempt from paying damages. Apparently, according to the mishna, the same <i>halakha</i> applies to Yom Kippur.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: According to <b>whose</b> opinion is <b>the mishna</b> taught? The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana would render Yom Kippur like Shabbat with regard to payment</b> of damages. <b>Just as</b> in the case of one who intentionally desecrates <b>Shabbat he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty <b>and</b> is therefore <b>exempt from</b> the obligation of <b>payment</b> of damages caused while desecrating Shabbat, <b>so too,</b> in the case of one who intentionally desecrates <b>Yom Kippur, he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty <b>and</b> is therefore <b>exempt from</b> the obligation of <b>payment</b> of damages caused while desecrating Yom Kippur.

### Part 19
<b>We learned there</b> in a mishna (<i>Makkot</i> 23a): <b>All</b> those <b>liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> who were flogged</b> in court <b>were exempted from their <i>karet</i>,</b> which is imposed by heaven. Most transgressors are liable to receive <i>karet</i> for violating prohibitions that are punishable by flogging. If they are flogged, they are exempt from <i>karet</i>, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to one liable to receive lashes: <b>“Then your brother shall be dishonored before you”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:3), indicating that <b>once he was flogged he is like your brother,</b> and his sins have been pardoned; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel’s colleagues disagree with him</b> on this issue.

### Part 20
<b>Rava said</b> that the Sages of <b>the school of Rav said: We learned: The difference between Yom Kippur and Shabbat is only that</b> in <b>this</b> case, Shabbat, <b>its intentional</b> desecration is punishable <b>at the hand of Man; and</b> in <b>that</b> case, Yom Kippur, <b>its intentional</b> desecration is punishable <b>with <i>karet</i>. And if</b> the statement of Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel <b>is so,</b> in both <b>this</b> case, Shabbat, <b>and that</b> case, Yom Kippur, the punishment <b>is at the hand of Man.</b>

### Part 21
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> There is no proof from here that Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel’s colleagues disagree with him, as in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna taught? <b>It is</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, who said: There are no lashes in</b> cases of <b>those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> All <b>those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> in cases of incest <b>were included in</b> the principle: “For whoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the persons that commit them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29). <b>And why was <i>karet</i></b> administered to <b>one’s sister excluded</b> from this verse and mentioned independently (Leviticus 20:17)? It is <b>to sentence her to</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> and not to</b> the punishment of <b>lashes.</b> This serves as a paradigm; wherever one is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, there are no lashes.

### Part 22
<b>Rav Ashi said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is according to the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yitzḥak and hold that there are lashes even in cases where there is liability for <i>karet</i>, there is no proof that Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel’s colleagues disagree with him. The mishna can be understood as follows: In <b>this</b> case, Shabbat, the <b>primary</b> punishment for <b>its intentional</b> desecration is <b>at the hand of Man; and</b> in <b>that</b> case, Yom Kippur, the <b>primary</b> punishment for <b>its intentional</b> desecration is <b>with <i>karet</i>.</b> If, however, he was flogged, he is exempt from <i>karet</i>.
