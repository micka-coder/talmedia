### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that</b> this ordinance is <b>for the benefit of the cities? Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that if the fourteenth <b>occurred on a Monday, the</b> residents of <b>villages and large towns read it on that very day? If it is so,</b> that the ordinance allowing the villagers to sometimes advance their reading of the Megilla is for the benefit of the cities, <b>let</b> the villagers <b>advance</b> their reading <b>to the</b> previous <b>day of assembly</b> even when the fourteenth occurs on a Monday. The Gemara responds: That would mean that Megilla reading <b>for them</b> would take place on <b>the tenth</b> of Adar, <b>and the Sages did not establish the tenth</b> of Adar as a day that is fit to read the Megilla.

### Part 2
The Gemara continues: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a different statement of the mishna: If the fourteenth <b>occurs on a Thursday, the villages and large towns read</b> it <b>on that day,</b> the fourteenth, <b>and the walled cities</b> read it <b>on the next day,</b> the fifteenth. <b>If it is so,</b> that the ordinance is for the benefit of the cities, <b>let</b> the villagers <b>advance</b> their reading of the Megilla <b>to the</b> previous <b>day of assembly,</b> i.e., the previous Monday, as it is <b>the eleventh</b> of Adar. The Gemara responds: <b>We do not defer</b> the reading of the Megilla <b>from</b> one <b>day of assembly to</b> another <b>day of assembly.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara continues: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which was taught in the following mishna (5a): <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> is the Megilla read from the eleventh of Adar and onward? <b>In a place where</b> the villagers generally <b>enter</b> town <b>on Monday and Thursday. However,</b> in a <b>place where they do not</b> generally <b>enter</b> town <b>on Monday and Thursday, one may read</b> the Megilla <b>only in its</b> designated <b>time,</b> the fourteenth of Adar. The Gemara infers: <b>If it enters your mind</b> to say that the ordinance is for <b>the benefit of the cities,</b> would it be reasonable to suggest that <b>because</b> the villagers <b>do not enter</b> town <b>on Monday and Thursday the</b> residents of the <b>cities</b> should <b>lose out</b> and not be provided with food and water?

### Part 4
The Gemara accepts this argument: <b>Do not say</b> that the Sages allowed the villages to advance their reading of the Megilla to the day of assembly <b>so that they</b> can be free to <b>provide water and food to their brethren in the cities</b> on the day of Purim. <b>Rather, say</b> that the Sages were lenient with them <b>because</b> the villages <b>supply water and food to their brethren in the cities.</b> This ordinance was established for the benefit of the villagers so that they should not have to make an extra trip to the cities to hear the reading of the Megilla. However, in a place where the villages do not go to the cities, advancing their reading of the Megilla to the day of assembly will not benefit them, and therefore they must read on the fourteenth.

### Part 5
§ We learned in the mishna: <b>How so?</b> If the fourteenth of Adar <b>occurs on Monday, the villages and large towns read</b> it <b>on that day.</b> The mishna continues to explain the days on which the Megilla is read. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, <b>which employs the order</b> of the dates <b>of the month,</b> i.e., the eleventh of Adar, <b>and the latter clause, which employs the order of the days</b> of the week, i.e., Monday?

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the days of the week <b>would be reversed</b> if the latter clause was organized according to the dates of the month, as the mishna would first have to mention a case where the fourteenth occurs on a Sunday, then a case where it occurs on a Wednesday or Shabbat, and then a case where it occurs on a Friday or Tuesday, the mishna <b>employed the order of the days</b> of the week in order to avoid confusion.

### Part 7
§ We learned in the mishna: If the fourteenth <b>occurs on Shabbat eve,</b> Friday, the villages advance their reading to the day of assembly, i.e., Thursday, and the large towns and walled cities read it on Friday, the fourteenth of Adar. The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in the <b>mishna?</b> It can be <b>either Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>or Rabbi Yosei.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the fourteenth <b>occurs on Shabbat eve, villages and large towns advance</b> their reading <b>to the day of assembly,</b> i.e., Thursday, <b>and walled cities read it on the day</b> of Purim, Friday. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi disagrees and <b>says: I say</b> that <b>the</b> readings in the large <b>towns should not be deferred from their</b> usual <b>date,</b> i.e., the fourteenth of Adar. <b>Rather, both these,</b> the large towns <b>and those,</b> the walled cities, <b>read</b> the Megilla <b>on the day</b> of Purim.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of the first <i>tanna</i>?</b> The Gemara explains that it is <b>as it is written:</b> “To keep these two days, according to their writing and according to their time, <b>in every year”</b> (Esther 9:27), which indicates that Purim must be celebrated every year in similar fashion. <b>Just as</b> in <b>every</b> other <b>year</b> the large <b>towns precede the walled cities</b> by one day, <b>so too here the</b> large <b>towns precede the walled cities</b> by one day. Consequently, since the walled cities cannot read the Megilla on Shabbat and they are required to advance the reading to Friday, the large towns must also advance their reading a day to Thursday.

### Part 10
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Say</b> that the words <b>“in every year”</b> indicate that <b>just as</b> in <b>every</b> other <b>year the</b> Megilla readings in <b>the</b> large <b>towns are not deferred from their</b> usual <b>date</b> and they read the Megilla on the fourteenth, <b>so too here the</b> Megilla readings in <b>the</b> large <b>towns should not be deferred from their</b> usual <b>date</b> and they too should read on the fourteenth. The Gemara answers: <b>Here it is different, as it is not possible</b> for the large towns to fulfill all of the conditions at the same time, i.e., to read on the fourteenth and to read a day before the walled cities.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>what is</b> his <b>reason?</b> The Gemara explains that it is also based upon the words <b>“in every year”; just as</b> in <b>every</b> other <b>year the</b> readings in <b>the</b> large <b>towns are not deferred from their</b> usual <b>date</b> and they read on the fourteenth, <b>so too here, the</b> readings in <b>the</b> large <b>towns are not deferred from their</b> usual <b>date,</b> but rather they read on the fourteenth.

### Part 12
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Say</b> that the words <b>“in every year”</b> indicate that <b>just as every year the</b> large <b>towns precede the walled cities</b> by one day, and read on the fourteenth, <b>so too here the</b> large <b>towns precede the walled cities</b> by one day, and read on the thirteenth. The Gemara answers: <b>Here it is different, as it is not possible</b> to fulfill all of the conditions at the same time, i.e., to read on the fourteenth and to read a day before the walled cities.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the fourteenth <b>occurs on Shabbat eve, the walled cities and villages advance</b> their reading of the Megilla <b>to the day of assembly, and the large towns read</b> it <b>on the day</b> of Purim <b>itself. Rabbi Yosei says: The walled cities never precede the</b> large <b>towns; rather, both these,</b> the large towns, <b>and those,</b> the walled cities, <b>read on that day,</b> i.e., Friday, the fourteenth of Adar.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of the first <i>tanna</i>? As it is written: “In every year”; just as</b> in <b>every</b> other <b>year the</b> large <b>towns</b> read the Megilla <b>on the fourteenth, and the time for this</b> type of settlement to read the Megilla <b>is not the time for that</b> type of settlement to read the Megilla, as the large towns and walled cities never read the Megilla on the same day, <b>so too here, the</b> large <b>towns</b> read the Megilla <b>on the fourteenth, and the time for this</b> type of settlement to read the Megilla <b>is not the time for that</b> type of settlement to read the Megilla. Therefore, the walled cities must advance their reading of the Megilla by two days to the day of assembly, Thursday.

### Part 15
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Say</b> that the words <b>“in every year”</b> indicate that <b>just as</b> in <b>every</b> other <b>year the walled cities do not precede the</b> large <b>towns, so too here, the walled cities do not precede the</b> large <b>towns.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Here it is different, as it is not possible</b> to fulfill all of the conditions at the same time, i.e., that the large towns should read on the fourteenth, the large towns and the walled cities should read on different days, and the walled cities should not precede the large towns.

### Part 16
<b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yosei?</b> It is based upon the words <b>“in every year”; just as</b> in <b>every</b> other <b>year the walled cities do not precede the</b> large towns, <b>so too here, the walled cities do not precede the</b> large <b>towns.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Say</b> that the words <b>“in every year” indicate</b> that <b>just as</b> in <b>every</b> other <b>year, the time for this</b> type of settlement to read the Megilla <b>is not the time for that</b> type of settlement to read the Megilla, <b>so too here, the time for this</b> type of settlement to read the Megilla <b>is not the time for that</b> type of settlement to read the Megilla. Therefore, since the large towns read on the fourteenth, the walled cities read on the thirteenth. The Gemara answers: <b>Here it is different, as it is not possible</b> to fulfill all the conditions. It is clear from these <i>baraitot</i> that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna can either be Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi or Rabbi Yosei, but not either of two anonymous <i>tanna’im</i>.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>Does Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi really <b>hold that one does not defer</b> the reading of the Megilla in large towns <b>to the day of assembly? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the fourteenth <b>occurs on Shabbat, the villages advance</b> their reading of the Megilla <b>to the day of assembly, the large towns read</b> it <b>on Shabbat eve, and the walled cities</b> read it <b>the next day,</b> i.e., on Sunday. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that <b>since the</b> readings in <b>the</b> large <b>towns were</b> already <b>deferred from their</b> usual <b>date,</b> i.e., the fourteenth, <b>they are deferred to the day of assembly,</b> i.e., to Thursday. Consequently, even Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi agrees that the reading in the large towns can be shifted to the day of assembly. Why doesn’t he also hold that large towns read the Megilla on the day of assembly when the fourteenth occurs on a Friday?

### Part 19
The Gemara responds: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, the designated <b>time for them</b> to read the Megilla <b>is Shabbat,</b> but the Megilla is not read on Shabbat, and therefore they must read it on a different day. Therefore, <b>since</b> the readings in the large towns have been <b>deferred, they are deferred</b> an additional day, and take place on Thursday, the day of assembly, at the same time as the readings in the villages. <b>Here, their</b> designated <b>time is Shabbat eve,</b> and there is no reason to move the reading from that day.

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said:</b> When <b>Purim occurs on Shabbat,</b> the reading of the Megilla in <b>all</b> places is <b>deferred to the day of assembly?</b> The Gemara corrects the wording of Rav Huna’s statement: <b>Can it enter your mind</b> to say that the reading of the Megilla in <b>all</b> places is deferred to the day of assembly? <b>Aren’t there walled cities that perform</b> this ceremony <b>the next day,</b> i.e., on Sunday? <b>Rather,</b> Rav Huna’s statement should say as follows: <b>All</b> readings <b>that are deferred are deferred to the day of assembly. In accordance with whose</b> opinion was this stated? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.

### Part 21
<b>In any case,</b> it is apparent from the mishna and the <i>baraitot</i> that <b>everyone agrees that one does not read the</b> Megilla <b>on Shabbat. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rabba said: Everyone is obligated</b> to participate in <b>reading the Megilla</b> on Purim <b>and blowing the <i>shofar</i></b> on Rosh HaShana, <b>and not everyone is proficient in reading the Megilla.</b> Therefore, the Sages issued a rabbinic <b>decree</b> that the Megilla is not read on Shabbat, <b>lest one take</b> the Megilla <b>in his hand and go to an expert to learn</b> how to read it or to hear the expert read it, <b>and,</b> due to his preoccupation, he will <b>carry it four cubits in the public domain,</b> and thereby desecrate Shabbat.

### Part 22
The Gemara comments: <b>And this</b> same concern for the sanctity of Shabbat <b>is the reason</b> that the Sages decreed <b>that the <i>shofar</i></b> is not blown when Rosh HaShana occurs on Shabbat. <b>And this</b> same concern <b>is the reason</b> that the Sages decreed that one may not take <b>the <i>lulav</i></b> on Shabbat.

### Part 23
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> that there is another reason the Megilla is not read on Shabbat: <b>Because the eyes of the poor are raised to the reading of the Megilla.</b> The poor await the day on which the Megilla is read, because on that day gifts are distributed to the poor. If the Megilla is read on Shabbat, it will not be possible to distribute gifts to the poor, who will be deeply disappointed. The Gemara notes that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Even though</b> the Sages <b>said that the villages advance</b> their reading of the Megilla <b>to the day of assembly, they</b> also <b>collect</b> the gifts for the poor <b>on that day, and they distribute</b> them to the poor <b>on that day.</b>

### Part 24
The Gemara is troubled by the wording of this <i>baraita</i>. Does the <i>baraita</i> read: <b>Even though</b> the Sages <b>said? On the contrary,</b> it is <b>because they said</b> that the villages advance their reading to the day of assembly that the gifts must be collected and distributed to the poor on that very day. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should read as follows: <b>Since</b> the Sages <b>said that the villages advance</b> their reading of the Megilla <b>to the day of assembly, they collect</b> the gifts for the poor <b>on that day and they distribute</b> them <b>on that day, because the eyes of the poor are raised to the reading of the Megilla,</b> and they should not be disappointed. <b>However,</b>
