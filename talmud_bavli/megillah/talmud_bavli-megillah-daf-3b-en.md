### Part 1
This <b>teaches that he spent the night in the depths</b> [<b><i>be’umeka</i></b>] <b>of <i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., that he spent the night studying Torah with the Jewish people. <b>And Rav Shmuel bar Unya said: Torah study is greater than sacrificing the daily offerings, as it is stated: “I have come now”</b> (Joshua 5:14), indicating that the angel came to rebuke Joshua for neglecting Torah study and not for neglecting the daily offering. Consequently, how did the Sages of the house of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi determine that the Temple service is more important than Torah study?

### Part 2
The Gemara explains that it is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement, with regard to the story of Joshua, is referring to Torah study <b>by the masses,</b> which is greater than the Temple service. <b>That</b> statement of the Sages of the house of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is referring to Torah study <b>by an individual,</b> which is less significant than the Temple service.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: Is the Torah study <b>of an individual a light</b> matter? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>On</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, women may lament</b> the demise of the deceased in unison, <b>but they may not clap</b> their hands in mourning? <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: Those that are close to the bier may clap. On the New Moon, on Hanukkah, and on Purim,</b> which are not mandated by Torah law, <b>they may</b> both <b>lament and clap</b> their hands in mourning. However, <b>on both</b> groups of days, <b>they may not wail</b> responsively, a form of wailing where one woman wails and the others repeat after her.

### Part 4
<b>And Rabba bar Huna said:</b> All these regulations were said with regard to an ordinary person, but <b>there are no</b> restrictions on expressions of mourning on the intermediate days of <b>a Festival in the presence of a</b> deceased <b>Torah scholar.</b> If a Torah scholar dies on the intermediate days of a Festival, the women may lament, clap, and wail responsively as on any other day, <b>and all the more so on Hanukkah and Purim.</b> This indicates that even the Torah study of an individual is of great importance.

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>You speak of the honor</b> that must be shown <b>to the Torah,</b> and indeed, <b>the honor</b> that must be shown to <b>the Torah</b> in the case of <b>an individual</b> Torah scholar <b>is important;</b> but <b>the Torah study of an individual</b> in itself <b>is light</b> and is less significant than the Temple service.

### Part 6
§ <b>Rava said:</b> It <b>is obvious to me</b> that if one must choose between Temple <b>service and reading the Megilla, reading the Megilla</b> takes <b>precedence, based upon</b> the exposition of <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina</b> with regard to the phrase “every family” (Esther 9:28). Similarly, if one must choose between <b>Torah study and reading the Megilla, reading the Megilla</b> takes <b>precedence, based upon</b> the fact that the Sages of <b>the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>relied</b> on Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina’s exposition to rule that one interrupts Torah study to hear the reading of the Megilla.

### Part 7
Furthermore, it is obvious that if one must choose between <b>Torah study and</b> tending to <b>a corpse with no one to bury it [<i>met mitzva</i>],</b> the task of burying <b>the <i>met mitzva</i></b> takes <b>precedence.</b> This is derived <b>from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One cancels his Torah study to bring out a corpse</b> for burial, <b>and to</b> join a wedding procession and <b>bring in the bride.</b> Similarly, if one must choose between the Temple <b>service and</b> tending to <b>a <i>met mitzva</i>,</b> tending to the <b><i>met mitzva</i></b> takes <b>precedence, based upon</b> the <i>halakha</i> derived from the term <b>“or for his sister”</b> (Numbers 6:7).

### Part 8
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to verses addressing the laws of a nazirite: “All the days that he consecrates himself to the Lord, he shall not come near to a dead body. For his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, he shall not make himself ritually impure for them when they die” (Numbers 6:6–7). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “or for his sister”?</b> The previous verse, which states that the nazirite may not come near a dead body, already prohibits him from becoming impure through contact with his sister. Therefore, the second verse is understood to be teaching a different <i>halakha</i>: One <b>who was going to slaughter his Paschal</b> lamb <b>or to circumcise his son, and he heard that</b> a relative <b>of his died,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he</b> should return and <b>become ritually impure</b> with the impurity imparted by a corpse.

### Part 9
<b>You said: He shall not become impure;</b> the death of his relative will not override so significant a mitzva from the Torah. One <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Just as he does not become impure for his sister, so he does not become impure for a corpse with no one to bury it [<i>met mitzva</i>]. The verse states: “Or for his sister”; he may not become impure for his sister,</b> as someone else can attend to her burial, <b>but he does become impure for a <i>met mitzva</i>.</b>

### Part 10
On the basis of these premises, <b>Rava raised a dilemma:</b> If one must choose between <b>reading the Megilla and</b> tending to <b>a <i>met mitzva</i>, which of them</b> takes <b>precedence?</b> Does <b>reading the Megilla</b> take <b>precedence due to</b> the value of <b>publicizing the miracle, or perhaps</b> burying <b>the <i>met mitzva</i></b> takes <b>precedence due to</b> the value of preserving <b>human dignity? After he raised the dilemma,</b> Rava <b>then resolved it</b> on his own and ruled that attending to a <b><i>met mitzva</i></b> takes <b>precedence, as the Master said: Great is human dignity, as it overrides a prohibition in the Torah.</b> Consequently, it certainly overrides the duty to read the Megilla, despite the fact that reading the Megilla publicizes the miracle.

### Part 11
§ The Gemara examines <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> cited in the course of the previous discussion. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A</b> walled <b>city, and all</b> settlements <b>adjacent to it, and all</b> settlements that can be <b>seen with it,</b> i.e., that can be seen from the walled city, are <b>considered like the</b> walled <b>city,</b> and the Megilla is read on the fifteenth. It was <b>taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a settlement <b>adjacent</b> to a walled city, <b>although it cannot be seen</b> from it, and also a place that <b>can be seen</b> from the walled city, <b>although it is not adjacent</b> to it.

### Part 12
The Gemara examines the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Granted</b> that with regard to a place that <b>can be seen</b> from the walled city, <b>although it is not adjacent</b> to it, <b>you find it where</b> the place <b>is located on the top of a mountain,</b> and therefore it can be seen from the walled city, although it is at some distance from it. <b>However,</b> with regard to a settlement that is <b>adjacent</b> to a walled city <b>although it cannot be seen</b> from it, <b>how can you find these</b> circumstances? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> You find it, for example, <b>where</b> the place <b>is located in a valley,</b> and therefore it is possible that it cannot be seen from the walled city, although it is very close to it.

### Part 13
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A</b> walled <b>city that was</b> initially <b>settled and</b> only <b>later surrounded</b> by a wall <b>is considered a village</b> rather than a walled city. <b>What is the reason? As it is written: “And if a man sells a residential house in a walled city”</b> (Leviticus 25:29). The wording of the verse indicates that it is referring to a place <b>that was</b> first <b>surrounded</b> by a wall <b>and</b> only <b>later settled, and not</b> to a place <b>that was</b> first <b>settled and</b> only <b>later surrounded</b> by a wall.

### Part 14
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A</b> walled <b>city that does not have ten idlers,</b> i.e., individuals who do not work and are available to attend to communal needs, <b>is treated as a village.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is he teaching us? We</b> already <b>learned</b> in a mishna (5a): <b>What is a large city? Any</b> city <b>in which there are ten idlers;</b> however, if there are <b>fewer than that, it is a village.</b> The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, <b>it was necessary</b> for Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a large <b>city,</b> to indicate that <b>even if</b> idlers <b>happen to come there from elsewhere,</b> since they are not local residents, it is still considered a village.

### Part 15
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> also <b>said: A</b> walled <b>city that was destroyed and</b> then <b>later settled is considered a city.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by the term <b>destroyed? If we say</b> that the city’s <b>walls were destroyed,</b> and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi comes to teach us that if it was <b>settled, yes</b> it is treated as a walled city, but if it was <b>not settled,</b> it is <b>not</b> treated that way, there is a difficulty. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer bar Yosei says:</b> The verse states: <b>“Which has [<i>lo</i>] a wall</b> (Leviticus 25:30),” and the word <i>lo</i> is written with an <i>alef</i>, which means no, but in context the word <i>lo</i> is used as thought it was written with a <i>vav</i>, meaning that it has a wall. This indicates that <b>even though</b> the city <b>does not have</b> a wall <b>now,</b> as the wall was destroyed, if it <b>had</b> a wall <b>before,</b> it retains its status as a walled city.

### Part 16
<b>Rather, what is</b> meant by the term <b>destroyed? That it was destroyed</b> in the sense that it no longer has <b>ten idlers,</b> and therefore it is treated like a village. However, once it has ten idlers again, it is treated like a city.

### Part 17
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b>
