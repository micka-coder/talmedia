### Part 1
<b>Now, didn’t they say</b> later in the same <i>baraita</i> that <b>it is not necessary to consecrate</b> them? <b>Rather,</b> this is what the <i>baraita</i> means to say: It is due to the fact that when the exiles ascended from Babylonia <b>they discovered these and enumerated them.</b>

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>And not only these, but</b> in <b>any</b> city with regard to <b>which you receive a tradition from your ancestors that it was surrounded by a wall from the days of Joshua, son of Nun, all these mitzvot are observed in it, due to</b> the fact <b>that the initial consecration sanctified</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>for its time and sanctified</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>forever.</b> This is <b>difficult,</b> as there is a contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yishmael and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: This is a dispute between <b>two</b> later <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> who hold <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei.</b> Each transmitted Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion in a different manner. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that one of the traditions is mistaken, as with regard to <b>this</b> statement, <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Yosei said it, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said</b> that the verse states: <b>“Which has [<i>lo</i>] a wall”</b> (Leviticus 25:30). The word <i>lo</i> is written with an <i>alef</i>, meaning no, that it does not have a wall, but its vocalization is in the sense of its homonym, <i>lo</i> with a <i>vav</i>, meaning that it has a wall. This indicates that <b>even though it does not presently have</b> a wall, as it was destroyed, <b>but it had a wall previously,</b> it retains its status as a walled city. It is Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, who maintains that the first consecration sanctified Jerusalem forever.

### Part 4
§ The Gemara returns to the primary topic of this chapter, the book of Esther. The Gemara cites various aggadic interpretations of the verses of the Megilla. The opening verse of the Megilla states: <b>“And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days of Ahasuerus”</b> (Esther 1:1). <b>Rabbi Levi said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Yonatan</b> who said: <b>This matter is a tradition</b> that <b>we</b> received <b>from the members of the Great Assembly. Anywhere that</b> the word <b><i>vayhi</i> is stated, it is</b> an ominous <b>term</b> indicating <b>nothing other</b> than impending <b>grief,</b> as if the word were a contraction of the words <i>vai</i> and <i>hi</i>, meaning woe and mourning.

### Part 5
The Gemara cites several proofs corroborating this interpretation. <b>“And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days of Ahasuerus”</b> led to grief, as there <b>was Haman. “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] in the days when the judges ruled”</b> (Ruth 1:1) introduces a period when there <b>was famine. “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>], when men began to multiply”</b> (Genesis 6:1) is immediately followed by the verse: <b>“And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth”</b> (Genesis 6:5).

### Part 6
<b>“And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] as they journeyed from the east”</b> (Genesis 11:2) is followed by: <b>“Come, let us build us a city”</b> (Genesis 11:4), which led to the sin of the Tower of Babel. The Gemara cites further examples: <b>“And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel”</b> (Genesis 14:1), about whom it is stated: <b>“These made war”</b> (Genesis 14:2). Another verse states: <b>“And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho”</b> (Joshua 5:13), it was there that he saw an angel <b>“with his sword drawn in his hand”</b> as a warning. It is written: <b>“And the Lord was [<i>vayhi</i>] with Joshua”</b> (Joshua 6:27), and immediately afterward: <b>“But the children of Israel committed a trespass”</b> (Joshua 7:1). It states: <b>“And it came to pass that there was a certain man of Ramathaim”</b> (I Samuel 1:1), and it mentions shortly afterward Hannah’s inability to conceive: <b>“For he loved Hannah, but the Lord had closed up her womb”</b> (I Samuel 1:5).

### Part 7
Similarly, the verse states: <b>“And it came to pass, when Samuel was old”</b> (I Samuel 8:1), and then it is written: <b>“And his sons did not walk in his ways”</b> (I Samuel 8:3). Also, it states: <b>“And it came to pass that David was successful in all his ways, and the Lord was with him”</b> (I Samuel 18:14), and only a few verses prior it is written: <b>“And Saul viewed David with suspicion”</b> (I Samuel 18:9). In another instance, the verse states: <b>“And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house”</b> (II Samuel 7:1). Here King David mentioned his desire to build a temple for God, but it is written elsewhere that he was told: <b>“Yet you shall not build the house”</b> (II Chronicles 6:9).

### Part 8
After citing several verses where <i>vayhi</i> portends grief, the Gemara mentions a number of verses that seem to indicate otherwise. <b>But isn’t it written: “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] on the eighth day”</b> (Leviticus 9:1), which was the day of the dedication of the Tabernacle? <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to that day: <b>On that day there was joy before the Holy One, Blessed be He, similar to</b> the joy that existed on the <b>day on which the heavens and earth were created.</b> The Gemara cites a verbal analogy in support of this statement. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to the dedication of the Tabernacle: <b>“And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] on the eighth day,” and it is written there,</b> in the Creation story: <b>“And it was [<i>vayhi</i>]</b> evening, and it was <b>morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5). This indicates that there was joy on the eighth day, when the Tabernacle was dedicated, similar to the joy that existed on the day the world was created. Apparently, the term <i>vayhi</i> is not necessarily a portent of grief.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: This verse does not contradict the principle. On the day of the dedication of the Tabernacle, a calamity also befell the people, <b>as Nadav and Avihu died.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara cites additional verses where <i>vayhi</i> is not indicative of impending grief: <b>But isn’t it written: “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] in the four hundred and eightieth year”</b> (I Kings 6:1), which discusses the joyous occasion of the building of the Temple? <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>isn’t it written: “And it came to pass [<i>vayhi</i>] when Jacob saw Rachel”</b> (Genesis 29:10), which was a momentous occasion? <b>And isn’t it written: “And it was [<i>vayhi</i>] evening, and it was [<i>vayhi</i>] morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5)? <b>And isn’t there the second</b> day of Creation, <b>and isn’t there the third</b> day, where the term <i>vayhi</i> is used? <b>And aren’t there many</b> verses in the Bible in which the term <i>vayhi</i> appears and no grief ensues? Apparently, the proposed principle is incorrect.

### Part 11
Rather, <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> With regard to <b>every</b> instance of <b><i>vayhi</i></b> alone, <b>there are</b> some that mean <b>this,</b> grief, <b>and there are</b> some that mean <b>that,</b> joy. However, wherever the phrase <b>“and it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>]”</b> is used in the Bible, <b>it is nothing other</b> than <b>a term of</b> impending <b>grief.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara states that <b>there are five</b> instances of <b><i>vayhi bimei</i></b> in the Bible. <b>“And it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Ahasuerus”; “And it came to pass in the days [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] when the judges ruled”; “And it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Amraphel”; “And it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Ahaz”</b> (Isaiah 7:1); <b>“And it came to pass in the days of [<i>vayhi bimei</i>] Jehoiakim”</b> (Jeremiah 1:3). In all those incidents, grief ensued.

### Part 13
§ Apropos the tradition cited by Rabbi Levi above, the Gemara cites additional traditions that he transmitted. <b>Rabbi Levi said: This matter is a tradition</b> that <b>we</b> received <b>from our ancestors: Amoz,</b> father of Isaiah, <b>and Amaziah,</b> king of Judea, <b>were brothers.</b> The Gemara questions: <b>What</b> novel element <b>is this</b> statement <b>teaching us?</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara responds: It is <b>in accordance with that which Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: Any bride who is modest in the house of her father-in-law merits that kings and prophets</b> will <b>emerge from her. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Tamar, as it is written: “When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute; for she had covered her face”</b> (Genesis 38:15). Can it be that <b>because</b> Tamar <b>covered her face he thought her to be a prostitute?</b> On the contrary, a harlot tends to uncover her face.

### Part 15
<b>Rather, because she covered her face in the house of her father-in-law and he was not familiar with her</b> appearance, Judah didn’t recognize Tamar, thought she was a harlot, and sought to have sexual relations with her. Ultimately, <b>she merited that kings and prophets emerged from her. Kings</b> emerged from her <b>through David,</b> who was a descendant of Tamar’s son, Peretz. However, there is no explicit mention that she was the forebear of <b>prophets.</b> This is derived from that <b>which Rabbi Levi said: This matter is a tradition</b> that <b>we</b> received <b>from our ancestors. Amoz,</b> father of Isaiah, <b>and Amaziah,</b> king of Judea, <b>were brothers, and it is written: “The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz”</b> (Isaiah 1:1). Amoz was a member of the Davidic dynasty, and his son, the prophet Isaiah, was also a descendant of Tamar.

### Part 16
<b>And Rabbi Levi said: This matter is a tradition</b> that <b>we</b> received <b>from our ancestors: The place of the Ark</b> of the Covenant <b>is not</b> included <b>in the measurement</b> of the Holy of Holies in which it rested.

### Part 17
The Gemara comments: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Ark crafted by Moses had ten cubits</b> of empty space <b>on each side. And it is written</b> in the description of Solomon’s Temple: <b>“And before the Sanctuary, which was twenty cubits in length,</b> and twenty cubits in breadth” (I Kings 6:20). The place “before the Sanctuary” is referring to the Holy of Holies. It was twenty by twenty cubits. If there were ten cubits of empty space on either side of the Ark, apparently the Ark itself occupied no space. <b>And it is written: And the wing of one of the cherubs was ten cubits and the wing of the other cherub was ten cubits;</b> the wings of the cherubs occupied the entire area. If so, <b>where was the Ark itself standing? Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from it</b> that the Ark <b>stood by means of a miracle</b> and occupied no space?

### Part 18
§ The Gemara cites prologues utilized by various Sages to introduce study of the Megilla: <b>Rabbi Yonatan introduced this passage,</b> the book of Esther, <b>with an introduction from here: “For I will rise up against them,</b> says the Lord of hosts, <b>and cut off from Babylonia name, and remnant, and offspring [<i>nin</i>], and posterity, says the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 14:22). This verse may be interpreted homiletically: <b>“Name,” this is</b> the <b>writing</b> of ancient Babylonia that will disappear from the world. <b>“Remnant,” this is</b> the <b>language</b> of ancient Babylonia. <b>“Offspring,” this is</b> their <b>kingdom. And “posterity,” this is Vashti,</b> who according to tradition was Nebuchadnezzar’s granddaughter, and the book of Esther relates how she too was removed from the throne.

### Part 19
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “Instead of the thorn shall the cypress come up, and instead of the nettle shall the myrtle come up;</b> and it shall be to the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off” (Isaiah 55:13). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani interpreted the verse homiletically as referring to the righteous individuals who superseded the wicked ones in the book of Esther.

### Part 20
<b>“Instead of the thorn”;</b> this means <b>instead of the wicked Haman.</b> He is referred to as a thorn <b>because he turned himself into an object of idol worship,</b> as he decreed that all must prostrate themselves before him. The Gemara cites proof that the term thorn is used in connection with idol worship, <b>as it is written: “And upon all thorns, and upon all brambles”</b> (Isaiah 7:19), which is understood to be a reference to idol worship.

### Part 21
The next section of the verse discusses what will replace the thorns, i.e., Haman: <b>“Shall the cypress [<i>berosh</i>] come up”; this is Mordecai.</b> Why is he called a cypress [<i>berosh</i>]? <b>Because he was called the chief</b> [<b><i>rosh</i></b>] <b>of all the spices, as it is stated: “Take you also to yourself the chief spices, of pure myrrh [<i>mar deror</i>]”</b> (Exodus 30:23), <b>and we translate</b> “pure myrrh,” into Aramaic as <b><i>mari dakhei</i>.</b> Mordecai was like <i>mari dakhi</i>, the chief [<i>rosh</i>] of spices, and therefore he is called <i>berosh</i>.

### Part 22
The verse continues: “And <b>instead of the nettle [<i>sirpad</i>],”</b> this means <b>instead of the wicked Vashti.</b> Why is she called a nettle [<i>sirpad</i>]? Because she was <b>the daughter of the son of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, who burned the ceiling [<i>saraf refidat</i>] of the House of God, as it is written: “Its top [<i>refidato</i>] of gold”</b> (Song of Songs 3:10).

### Part 23
The next section of the verse states: <b>“Shall the myrtle [<i>hadas</i>] come up”; this is the righteous Esther, who was called Hadassah</b> in the Megilla, <b>as it is stated: “And he had brought up Hadassah;</b> that is, Esther” (Esther 2:7). The concluding section of the verse states: <b>“And it shall be to the Lord for a name”; this is the reading of the Megilla. “For an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off”; these are the days of Purim.</b>

### Part 24
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “And it shall come to pass, that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good,</b> and to multiply you; so the Lord will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you” (Deuteronomy 28:63). The verse indicates that just as the Lord rejoiced in the good he did on behalf of Israel, so too, the Lord <b>will rejoice to cause you harm.</b>

### Part 25
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi asked: <b>Does the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> in fact <b>rejoice over the downfall of the wicked? But it is written: “As they went out before the army, and say: Give thanks to the Lord, for His kindness endures forever”</b> (II Chronicles 20:21), <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan said: For what</b> reason were the words: <b>“for He is good” not stated in this</b> statement of <b>thanksgiving,</b> as the classic formulation is: “Give thanks to the Lord; for He is good; for His kindness endures forever” (I Chronicles 16:34)? <b>Because the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not rejoice over the downfall of the wicked.</b> Since this song was sung in the aftermath of a military victory, which involved the downfall of the wicked, the name of God was not mentioned for the good.

### Part 26
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “And the one came not near the other all the night”</b> (Exodus 14:20)? <b>The ministering angels wanted to sing</b> their <b>song,</b> for the angels would sing songs to each other, as it states: “And they called out to each other and said” (Isaiah 6:3), but <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: The work of My hands,</b> the Egyptians, are <b>drowning at sea, and you</b> wish to <b>say songs?</b> This indicates that God does not rejoice over the downfall of the wicked.

### Part 27
<b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that this is how the matter is to be understood: Indeed, God Himself <b>does not rejoice</b> over the downfall of the wicked, <b>but He causes others to rejoice.</b> The Gemara comments: One can <b>learn from</b> the language of the verse <b>as well, as it is written: “So</b> the Lord <b>will rejoice [<i>ken yasis</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:63). <b>And it is not written <i>yasus</i>,</b> the grammatical form of the verb meaning: He will rejoice. Rather, it is written <i>yasis</i>. The grammatical form of this verb indicates that one causes another to rejoice. Consequently, these words are understood to mean that God will cause others to rejoice. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from</b> it that this is the case.

### Part 28
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana introduced this passage with an introduction from here.</b> The verse states with regard to God’s reward to the righteous: <b>“He gives to a man that is good in His sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:26). The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> verse <b>is</b> referring to <b>the righteous Mordecai.</b> With regard to the next part of the verse: <b>“But to the sinner He gives the task of gathering and heaping up,” this is</b> referring to <b>Haman.</b> The conclusion of the verse states: <b>“That he may give it to one who is good before God”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:26). <b>This is Mordecai and Esther, as it is written: “And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman”</b> (Esther 8:2).

### Part 29
<b>Rabba bar Oferan introduced this passage with an introduction from here: “And I will set my throne in Elam, and destroy from there the king and the princes, says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 49:38). <b>“The king”</b> who was destroyed; <b>this is</b> referring to <b>Vashti. “And the princes”; this is</b> referring to <b>Haman and his ten sons.</b>

### Part 30
<b>Rav Dimi bar Yitzḥak introduced this passage with an introduction from here:</b>
