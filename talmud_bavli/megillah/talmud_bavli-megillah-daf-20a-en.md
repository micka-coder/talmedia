### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> you can indeed say that the <i>baraita</i> about <i>teruma</i> was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and that Rabbi Yehuda permits a deaf person to read <b>even <i>ab initio</i>,</b> while Rabbi Yosei disqualifies a deaf person even after the fact. <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> that teaches that one should not recite the Grace after Meals in his heart, but if he did he has fulfilled his obligation, is <b>not difficult,</b> as that <i>baraita</i> was taught by Rabbi Yehuda as well. The explanation for this is that in <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, about <i>teruma</i>, he was teaching <b>his own</b> opinion, that it is permitted even <i>ab initio</i>, whereas in <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, concerning the Grace after Meals, he was teaching the opinion <b>of his master,</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, that one is required to hear what he is saying when he recites blessings.

### Part 2
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: One who recites the <i>Shema</i> must make it audible to his ears, as it is stated: “Hear O Israel, the Lord our God; the Lord is One”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:4), the word “hear” indicating that you should <b>allow your ears to hear</b> the words <b>you are expressing with your mouth. Rabbi Meir</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> This is not necessary, as it is also stated there: “And these words, <b>which I command you this day shall be in your heart”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:6), indicating that “these <b>words,”</b> the words of the Shema, go <b>after the intent of the heart,</b> as it is unnecessary to pronounce them out loud. We see that according to Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, as cited by Rabbi Yehuda, the words must be audible to one’s ears <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 3
The Gemara proposes a second solution: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> point and cited this <i>baraita</i>, <b>you</b> can <b>even say that Rabbi Yehuda holds in accordance with his teacher,</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, that a deaf person is disqualified <i>ab initio</i>, and it is only after the fact that his reading is valid. <b>And as for that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>that Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, taught</b> stating that a deaf person may set aside <i>teruma</i> even <i>ab initio</i>, this was taught in accordance with the other opinion cited in the <i>baraita</i>, i.e., that of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that everything depends on the intent of one’s heart, and that it is not necessary to pronounce words audibly, even <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 4
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says that a minor is fit</b> to read the Megilla. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> I can offer proof to my opinion, as when <b>I was a minor I</b> myself <b>read</b> the Megilla <b>before Rabbi Tarfon and the</b> other <b>Elders in Lod. They said to him</b> in response: <b>One cannot bring a proof from</b> the testimony of <b>a minor.</b> Since at the time of the supposed incident you were a minor, you are not qualified now to testify about it.

### Part 5
<b>It is taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> When <b>I was a minor I read</b> the Megilla <b>before Rabbi Yehuda. They said to him: One cannot bring a proof</b> that an act is permitted <b>from the</b> behavior of the very <b>one who permits</b> it. We know that Rabbi Yehuda maintains that a minor is fit to read the Megilla, and the fact that he acted in accordance with his own opinion does not prove that this is the accepted <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And let them say to him,</b> as the Sages said to Rabbi Yehuda in the previous <i>baraita</i>, that <b>one cannot bring a proof from</b> the testimony of a <b>minor.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They said one</b> thing to him <b>and</b> then <b>another;</b> i.e., they rejected him with a twofold argument: <b>One</b> objection is that <b>you were a minor</b> at that time, and therefore your testimony is disqualified. <b>And furthermore, even</b> if <b>you had been an adult</b> at that time and you had testified that you saw some other minor read the Megilla before Rabbi Yehuda, <b>one cannot bring a proof</b> that an act is permitted <b>from the</b> behavior of the very <b>one who permits</b> it.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not read the Megilla, nor perform a circumcision, nor immerse</b> himself in a ritual bath, <b>nor sprinkle</b> water of purification to purify people and objects that had contracted ritual impurity through contact with a corpse until after sunrise. <b>And also a woman who observes a</b> clean <b>day for</b> each <b>day</b> she experiences a discharge, i.e., a woman who experienced one or two days of non-menstrual bleeding, and must now wait until a day has passed without any discharge of blood before regaining ritual purity, she too <b>may not immerse herself until the sun has risen. And</b> with regard to <b>all these</b> activities that are supposed to be performed during the day, <b>if one did them after daybreak,</b> i.e., after the appearance of the first light of the sun, even before sunrise, <b>they are valid,</b> as at this point it is already considered daytime.

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> taught in the mishna that the Megilla may be read only during the day? The Gemara answers: <b>As the verse states: “And that these days should be remembered and kept”</b> (Esther 9:28). The word “days” indicates <b>during the day, yes,</b> but <b>at night, no.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say that this is a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A person is obligated to read the Megilla at night and</b> then <b>repeat it during the day.</b> The Gemara rejects this: There is no proof from here, <b>as when</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the Megilla may be read only during the day, it was referring to <b>the daytime</b> reading, but the nighttime reading is not considered here at all.

### Part 9
§ The mishna continues: <b>And one may not perform a circumcision</b> until after sunrise, <b>as it is written: “And on the eighth day he shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:3). This indicates that the circumcision must be during the day, not at night.

### Part 10
§ It is further taught in the mishna: <b>And one may not immerse</b> himself in a ritual bath, <b>or sprinkle</b> waters of purification until after sunrise. This too is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “And the pure person shall sprinkle upon the impure</b> on the third day <b>and on the seventh day;</b> and on the seventh day he shall purify himself and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be pure at evening” (Numbers 19:19), which teaches that the sprinkling must take place during the day and not at night. <b>And immersion is likened to sprinkling,</b> as it too is mentioned in the verse, “and bathe himself in water,” so that whatever is invalid with respect to sprinkling is also invalid with respect to immersion.

### Part 11
§ The mishna states: <b>And also a woman who observes a day for a day may not immerse herself until the sun has risen.</b> The Gemara asks: This <b>is obvious. What is different about a woman who observes a day for a day,</b> who must immerse herself in a ritual bath, <b>from all the others who are obligated to immerse themselves,</b> as it was already taught that one may not immerse himself in a ritual bath until it is day?

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> nevertheless <b>necessary</b> to mention separately the case of a woman who observes a day for a day. As, <b>it might enter your mind to say that</b> this woman’s bleeding <b>should be treated like the first emission of a <i>zav</i>,</b> a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like secretion, in that just as a man attains the status of a full-fledged <i>zav</i> once he has three such emissions, so too, a woman attains the status of a full-fledged <i>zava</i> once she experiences three days of bleeding. <b>And the first emission of a <i>zav</i> is likened to one who experienced a seminal discharge, as it is written: “This is the <i>halakha</i> of him that has an issue and of him whose semen goes from him”</b> (Leviticus 15:32). From this it is learned: <b>Just as one who experienced a seminal discharge immerses on the</b> same <b>day</b> that he had the discharge, <b>so too, that one,</b> the <i>zav</i>, <b>may immerse himself on the</b> same <b>day</b> that he had the emission.

### Part 13
<b>And</b> although <b>this one,</b> i.e., a woman who observes a day for a day, <b>cannot immerse on the</b> same <b>day</b> that she experienced the bleeding, <b>as it is written: “All the days of her issue shall be to her as the bed of her menstruation”</b> (Leviticus 15:26), which teaches that she remains the entire day of her issue in her impure state and must wait until the day is over before she can immerse herself, nevertheless, one might have said that <b>at least during the night</b> following the day of her issue <b>she should</b> be able to <b>perform a partial observation,</b> i.e., she should verify that part of the night has gone by without bleeding, <b>and</b> then <b>immerse herself</b> at night, without waiting until morning. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that <b>since she is required to count</b> one day of purity after her day of impurity,
