<b>and Rava, who would bend</b> their heads and not actually prostrate themselves on the ground.

### Part 2
We learned in the mishna: <b>On a Festival, five</b> people read; <b>on Yom Kippur, six</b> people read; and on Shabbat, seven people read. One may not decrease the number of readers, but one may add to them. The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of <b>the mishna?</b> It is <b>not Rabbi Yishmael and not Rabbi Akiva, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>On a Festival, five</b> people read from the Torah; <b>and on Yom Kippur, six</b> people read; <b>and on Shabbat, seven</b> people read. <b>One may not decrease or add to</b> the required number of readers. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva</b> disagrees and <b>says: On a Festival, five</b> people read from the Torah; <b>and on Yom Kippur, seven</b> people read; <b>and on Shabbat, six</b> people read. <b>One may not decrease</b> these numbers, <b>but one may add to them.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna? <b>If</b> you say it is <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> it is <b>difficult</b> due to the ruling with regard to <b>adding,</b> as the mishna states that one may add additional readers but Rabbi Yishmael holds that one may not do so. <b>If</b> you say it is <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> it is <b>difficult</b> due to the ruling concerning the days on which there are <b>six and seven</b> readers.

### Part 4
<b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael, as it was taught in the school of Rabbi Yishmael: On a Festival, five</b> people read from the Torah; <b>on Yom Kippur, six</b> people read; <b>on Shabbat, seven</b> people read. <b>One may not decrease these</b> numbers <b>but one may add to them.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara comments: If so, <b>there is a contradiction</b> between the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> as expressed in the mishna, and the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> himself, as recorded in the <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara responds: <b>Two <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> students of Rabbi Yishmael, expressed different opinions <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>On a Festival, one is slow to arrive</b> at the synagogue because one is busy preparing for the festive meal, <b>and one is quick to leave</b> in order to eat; <b>on Yom Kippur, one is quick to arrive</b> at the synagogue <b>and slow to leave; and on Shabbat, one is quick to arrive,</b> as the meal has been prepared before Shabbat, <b>and quick to leave</b> in order to eat the Shabbat meal? <b>Let us say</b> it is <b>Rabbi Akiva, who holds</b> that <b>an additional man</b> reads from the Torah on Yom Kippur, which prolongs the service on that day. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> it is <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> one leaves the synagogue late because <b>the order of the day,</b> i.e., the prayer service, <b>is</b> very <b>long,</b> as it includes many supplications and confessions.

### Part 7
A question is raised with regard to the number of readers on different days. <b>Corresponding to what</b> were <b>these three, five, and seven,</b> readers instituted? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani and one</b> other Sage <b>who was with him disagree about this. And who was</b> that other scholar? <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi. And some say</b> that this was a matter of dispute between <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi and one</b> other scholar <b>who was with him. And who was</b> that other scholar? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani. One said:</b> These numbers <b>correspond</b> to the number of Hebrew words in the three verses of <b>the Priestly Benediction. And one said:</b> These numbers <b>correspond to the three guards of the door</b> (II Kings 25:18), <b>five of</b> the officers <b>who saw the king’s face</b> (II Kings 25:19), <b>and the seven</b> officers <b>who saw the king’s face</b> (Esther 1:14).

### Part 8
Similarly, <b>Rav Yosef taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>three, five, and seven</b> people who read from the Torah correspond to the <b>three guards of the door, five of</b> the officers <b>who saw the king’s face,</b> and <b>the seven</b> officers <b>who saw the king’s face.</b> When Rav Yosef taught this, <b>Abaye said to him: What is the reason that until now the Master did not explain</b> the matter <b>to us</b> in this way? Rav Yosef <b>said to him: I did not know that you needed this</b> information, as I thought that you were already familiar with the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Have you</b> ever <b>asked me something and I did not tell you?</b>

### Part 9
<b>Ya’akov of Mina said to Rav Yehuda: Corresponding to whom were these six</b> readers <b>on Yom Kippur</b> instituted? Rav Yehuda <b>said to him:</b> The number six <b>corresponds to the six</b> people <b>who stood to Ezra’s right and the six</b> people <b>who stood to his left, as it is stated: “And Ezra the Scribe stood upon a platform of wood, which they had made for the purpose, and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand, and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadanah, Zechariah, Meshullam”</b> (Nehemiah 8:4).

### Part 10
The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>Those</b> that stood to his left <b>were seven</b> and not six. The Gemara responds: <b>Zechariah is</b> the same as <b>Meshullam,</b> that is to say, they are not two separate people, but rather one person with two names. <b>And why was he called Meshullam? Because he was perfect [<i>mishlam</i>] in his actions.</b>

### Part 11
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Megilla</i> 3:11): <b>All</b> people <b>count toward the quorum of seven</b> readers, <b>even a minor and even a woman. However, the Sages said</b> that <b>a woman should not read the Torah, out of respect for the congregation.</b>

### Part 12
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to the reader who <b>concludes [<i>maftir</i>]</b> the Torah reading and reads from the Prophets [<i>haftara</i>], <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>; does he <b>count toward the quorum of seven</b> readers? <b>Rav Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba</b> disagreed about this matter. <b>One said: He counts, and one said: He does not count. The one who said</b> that <b>he counts</b> toward the seven readers holds that opinion <b>because he reads</b> from the Torah.

### Part 13
<b>And the one who said</b> that <b>he does not count</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ulla, as Ulla said: For what</b> reason <b>must</b> the one <b>who concludes</b> with a reading from <b>the Prophets read from the Torah first?</b> It is <b>due to respect for the Torah,</b> so that those present should not conclude that he was called up only to read from the Prophets because the honor due the Torah and the honor due the Prophets are equal. <b>And since</b> he reads only <b>out of respect for the Torah, he is not included in the quorum</b> of seven readers.

### Part 14
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based upon the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>The one who concludes with</b> a reading from <b>the Prophets may not</b> read <b>fewer than twenty-one verses, corresponding to the seven who read from the Torah.</b> Each one who reads from the Torah must read at least three verses, for a total of at least twenty-one verses. <b>And if it is so,</b> that the one who reads the <i>haftara</i> does not count toward the quorum of seven readers, and he is an eighth reader, the minimum number of verses that must be read from the Torah <b>is twenty-four</b> and not twenty-one. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the one who reads the <i>haftara</i> reads from the Torah first only <b>due to respect for the Torah,</b>
