### Part 1
<b>And with regard to the Prophets,</b> one may read to the translator <b>three</b> verses at a time. With respect to the Torah, an incorrect translation might lead to an error in practice, but this concern does not apply to the Prophets. <b>If the three</b> verses <b>constitute three</b> separate <b>paragraphs,</b> that is to say, if each verse is a paragraph in itself, <b>one must read</b> them to the translator <b>one by one.</b>

### Part 2
<b>One may skip</b> from one place to another while reading <b>the Prophets, but one may not skip</b> from one place to another while reading <b>the Torah. How far may he skip? As far as</b> he can, provided that <b>the translator will not conclude</b> his translation while the reader is still rolling the scroll to the new location. The reader may not cause the congregation to wait for him after the translator has finished, as that would be disrespectful to the congregation.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Corresponding to what were these three verses,</b> i.e., the minimal Torah reading, instituted? <b>Rav Asi said:</b> They <b>correspond to the Torah, Prophets, and Writings.</b>

### Part 4
We learned in the mishna: <b>And</b> when it is being translated, <b>one should not read to the translator more than one verse</b> at a time. <b>And with regard to the Prophets,</b> he may read to the translator <b>three</b> verses at a time. <b>If the three</b> verses <b>constitute three</b> separate <b>paragraphs, he must read</b> them to the translator <b>separately, for example,</b> the verses: <b>“For thus says the Lord, You were sold for naught”</b> (Isaiah 52:3); <b>“For thus says the Lord God, at first My people went down to Egypt”</b> (Isaiah 52:4); <b>“Now therefore what have I here, says the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 52:5). These are three adjacent verses, each one constituting an independent paragraph.

### Part 5
§ We learned further in the mishna: <b>One may skip</b> from one place to another while reading <b>the Prophets, but one may not skip</b> from one place to another while reading <b>the Torah.</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 68b): On Yom Kippur, the High Priest <b>reads</b> the section beginning with the verse: <b>“After the death”</b> (Leviticus 16:1), and then he reads the section beginning with the verse: <b>“Only on the tenth day”</b> (Leviticus 23:27). <b>Doesn’t he skip</b> from the first section to the second section?

### Part 6
<b>Abaye said: This</b> is <b>not difficult. Here, where</b> it says that one may not skip in the Torah, <b>the translator will conclude</b> his translation before the reader is ready to continue reading. <b>There, where</b> it is permitted to skip, <b>the translator will not conclude</b> his translation before the reader is ready to continue reading.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in the mishna <b>with regard to that</b> issue: <b>One may skip while</b> reading <b>the Prophets, but one may not skip while</b> reading <b>the Torah. How far may he skip? As far as</b> he can, provided that <b>the translator will not conclude</b> his translation before the reader is ready to continue reading. This applies to reading the Prophets; it therefore proves <b>by inference that</b> while reading <b>the Torah</b> one may <b>not</b> skip <b>at all.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> it is <b>not difficult</b> for a different reason: <b>Here,</b> where it says that the High Priest skipped from one section to another, it was permitted because the two sections address <b>one topic. There,</b> where the mishna says one may not skip while reading the Torah, it is where the two sections address <b>two</b> distinct <b>topics. And so it is</b> explicitly <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may skip</b> from one section to another while reading <b>the Torah</b> if the two sections address <b>one topic, and in</b> the <b>Prophets</b> one may skip even if the two sections address <b>two</b> distinct <b>topics.</b> Both <b>here and there,</b> with regard to the Torah and the Prophets, one may skip only if <b>the translator will not conclude</b> his translation before the reader is ready to continue reading.

### Part 9
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not skip from prophet to prophet,</b> i.e., from one book of Prophets to another, even if the selections address the same topic. <b>However, one may skip</b> from one <b>prophet</b> to another <b>among the twelve</b> books of Prophets, which are grouped together, <b>provided that he does not skip from the end of the book to the beginning,</b> i.e., that he does not read a later section and then an earlier section.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The one who concludes with</b> a reading from <b>the Prophets</b> [<i>haftara</i>] <b>is</b> also <b>the one</b> who is honored to <b>recite the</b> introductory prayers and <b>blessing</b> before <b><i>Shema</i>, and he passes before the ark</b> to repeat the <i>Amida</i> prayer, <b>and</b> if he is a priest <b>he lifts his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction. <b>And if</b> the one who reads the <i>haftara</i> <b>is a minor,</b> who may read the <i>haftara</i> but is not qualified to lead the congregation in prayer, <b>his father or teacher</b> is honored to <b>pass</b> before the ark <b>in his place.</b>

### Part 11
<b>A minor may read the Torah</b> in public <b>and</b> also <b>translate</b> the text for the congregation into Aramaic, <b>but he may not recite the</b> introductory prayers and <b>blessing</b> before <b><i>Shema</i>, and he may not pass before the ark</b> to lead the congregation in prayer, <b>and he may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction.

### Part 12
<b>One whose limbs are exposed [<i>poḥe’aḥ</i>] may recite the</b> introductory prayers and <b>blessing</b> before <b><i>Shema</i> and translate</b> the Torah reading into Aramaic, <b>but he may not read from the Torah</b> out of respect for the Torah; <b>he may not pass before the ark</b> to lead the congregation in prayer; <b>and he may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction out of respect for the congregation.

### Part 13
One who is <b>blind may recite the</b> introductory prayers and <b>blessing</b> before <b><i>Shema</i>, and he may</b> also <b>translate</b> the Torah reading into Aramaic. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Anyone who has not seen the luminaries,</b> the sun, moon, and stars, <b>in his life,</b> i.e., he was blind from birth, <b>may not recite the</b> introductory prayers and <b>blessing</b> before <b><i>Shema</i>.</b> The first of the blessings before <i>Shema</i> is the blessing over the luminaries, and one who has never seen them cannot recite the blessing at all.

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the one who reads the <i>haftara</i> is honored with these other roles? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is <b>due to</b> a desire to grant him <b>honor.</b> Since even minors are qualified to read the <i>haftara</i>, it was considered an insult for a person to be called up to read the <i>haftara</i> rather than be called up as one of those needed to read the Torah. Since he was willing to serve in this role, he is granted other, more honorable roles in the synagogue. <b>Rabba bar Shimi said</b> a different reason: It is <b>due to</b> a concern that <b>they will come to quarrel,</b> as the individual who read the <i>haftara</i> will quarrel with the individual honored to lead the congregation in prayer.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between them?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them where</b> the one who passes before the ark <b>does so free</b> of charge. In that case, there is still a need to grant the one who read the <i>haftara</i> honor, but it is not likely that they will quarrel.

### Part 16
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>And if</b> the one who reads the <i>haftara</i> <b>is a minor, his father or teacher</b> is honored to <b>pass</b> before the ark <b>in his place. If you say</b> that the reason the reader of the <i>haftara</i> passes before the ark is <b>due to</b> a concern that they will <b>quarrel, will a minor engage in quarreling?</b> He has no valid claim to the right to pass before the ark. Consequently, the concern for strife must not be the reason for the <i>halakha</i> stated in the mishna.

### Part 17
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Rather, what</b> is the reason; is it <b>due to honor? Does a minor have honor</b> that is slighted when he reads the <i>haftara</i> and therefore must be assuaged? <b>Rather,</b> according to Rav Pappa <b>it is</b> a display of <b>honor</b> to <b>his father and his teacher.</b>
