### Part 1
<b>what was before</b> Creation <b>and what is after,</b> i.e., what will be at the end of time, <b>therefore</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the act of Creation is read in public.

### Part 2
The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: <b>The incident of Lot and his two daughters is read and translated.</b> The name Lot begins with a <i>lamed</i>, the second letter of the mnemonic. The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> Why might one think otherwise? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>one should be concerned for the honor of Abraham,</b> as Lot was his nephew, and therefore the incident casts shame upon Abraham as well, <b>therefore</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not a concern.

### Part 3
The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: <b>The incident of Tamar,</b> beginning with a <i>tav</i>, <b>and Judah is read and translated.</b> The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>one should be concerned for the honor of Judah, therefore</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches us</b> that there is no such concern. On the contrary, the story <b>is to his credit, as he confessed</b> to his sin.

### Part 4
The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: <b>The first</b> report <b>of the incident of the</b> Golden <b>Calf [<i>egel</i>] is read and translated.</b> <i>Egel</i> begins with the letter <i>ayin</i>, the next letter of the mnemonic. The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>one should be concerned for the honor of the Jewish people, therefore</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches us that all the more so is it amenable to them</b> that the matter be publicized, so that they will achieve atonement through their shame.

### Part 5
The <i>Tosefta</i> states: <b>The curses [<i>kelalot</i>] and blessings are read and translated.</b> The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>one should be concerned that perhaps the congregation will become dismayed</b> by the many curses, <b>therefore</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not a concern.

### Part 6
The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: <b>The warnings and punishments [<i>onashin</i>],</b> alluded to in the first <i>nun</i> of the mnemonic mentioned above, <b>are read and translated.</b> The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that if this section is read aloud, people <b>will come to act out of fear</b> and keep the mitzvot due to the fear of punishment rather than love of God, <b>therefore</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not a concern.

### Part 7
It is further taught: <b>The incident of Amnon and Tamar,</b> alluded to in the second <i>nun</i> in the mnemonic mentioned above, <b>is read and translated.</b> Additionally, <b>the incident of Absalom is read and translated,</b> alluded to in the <i>shin</i> of the mnemonic, the third letter of his name. The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>one should be concerned for the honor of David, therefore</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this section is read and translated.

### Part 8
The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: <b>The incident of the concubine [<i>pilegesh</i>] in Gibeah is read and translated.</b> The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>one should be concerned for the honor of</b> the tribe of <b>Benjamin, therefore</b> the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this section is read and translated.

### Part 9
The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: The section of: <b>“Make known [<i>hoda</i>] to Jerusalem her abominations”</b> (Ezekiel 16:2) <b>is read and translated.</b> The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> The Gemara answers: This is needed <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who held that this chapter may not be read as a <i>haftara</i>, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident with regard to a certain man who was reading</b> the <i>haftara</i> <b>in the presence of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> and he read the section of: <b>“Make known to Jerusalem her abominations.”</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: Before you examine the abominations of Jerusalem, go and examine the abominations of your</b> own <b>mother.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>they examined his</b> lineage <b>and found him to have a stain of illegitimacy.</b> His mother had engaged in illicit sexual relations, and therefore he was of questionable lineage.

### Part 10
The <i>Tosefta</i> also states: <b>And these</b> sections are <b>read but are not translated.</b> The acrostic composed of the letters <b><i>reish</i>, <i>ayin</i>, <i>bet</i>, <i>dalet</i>, <i>nun</i></b> is <b>a mnemonic</b> for the sections included in this category, as the Gemara will explain. The <i>Tosefta</i> states that <b>the incident of Reuben is read but not translated.</b> The name Reuben begins with a <i>reish</i>, the first letter of the mnemonic. And there was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel, who went to</b> the village of <b>Kavul, and the sexton of the synagogue was reading: “And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt</b> in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine; and Israel heard of it” (Genesis 35:22). Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to the translator: Stop, translate only the end</b> of the verse. <b>And the Sages praised him</b> for this.

### Part 11
The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: <b>The second</b> narrative of the <b>incident of the</b> Golden <b>Calf is read but not translated.</b> <i>Egel</i>, the Hebrew word for calf, begins with an <i>ayin</i>, the second letter in the mnemonic. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the second</b> narrative of the <b>incident of the</b> Golden <b>Calf?</b> Aaron’s account of what had taken place, <b>from “And Moses said</b> to Aaron” (Exodus 32:21) <b>until “And Moses saw”</b> (Exodus 32:25).

### Part 12
With regard to Aaron’s account, the Gemara cites that which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: A person should always be careful in</b> the way he formulates <b>his responses,</b> as sometimes the explanation that a person provides for his actions is worse than the original action itself, <b>as,</b> for example, <b>based on Aaron’s response to Moses, the skeptics renounced</b> their religious beliefs. <b>It is stated</b> in Aaron’s response: <b>“And I cast it into the fire and this calf came forth”</b> (Exodus 32:24). This formulation implies that the calf came from the fire by itself, suggesting that it had divine power and substance.

### Part 13
We learned in the mishna: The verses constituting <b>the Priestly Benediction [<i>birkat kohanim</i>]</b> are <b>read but not translated.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara explains that it is <b>because it is written:</b> “May the Lord <b>lift up</b> His countenance to you” (Numbers 6:26). Listeners may understand this to mean that God shows unfair favoritism to the Jewish people.

### Part 14
We also learned in the mishna: <b>The incident of David and Amnon is neither read nor translated.</b> David’s name begins with a <i>dalet</i>, the next letter in the mnemonic; <i>nun</i>, the last letter of the mnemonic, is the third letter in Amnon’s name. The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t you say</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> that <b>the incident of Amnon and Tamar is</b> both <b>read and translated?</b> The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement of the mishna applies <b>where</b> Amnon’s name <b>is written: Amnon, son of David. That</b> statement of the <i>Tosefta</i> applies <b>where it is written</b> simply as <b>Amnon.</b>

### Part 15
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All of the verses that are written in the Torah in a coarse manner are read in a refined manner. For example,</b> the term <b>“shall lie with her</b> [<b><i>yishgalena</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:30) is read as though it said <b><i>yishkavena</i>,</b> which is a more refined term. The term <b>“with hemorrhoids [<i>bafolim</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:27) is read <b><i>bateḥorim</i>.</b> The term <b>“doves’ dung [<i>ḥiryonim</i>]”</b> (II Kings 6:25) is read <b><i>divyonim</i>.</b> The phrase <b>“to eat their own excrement [<i>ḥoreihem</i>] and drink their own urine [<i>meimei shineihem</i>]”</b> (II Kings 18:27) is read with more delicate terms: <b>To eat their own excrement [<i>tzo’atam</i>] and drink their own urine [<i>meimei ragleihem</i>].</b>

### Part 16
The term <b>“into latrines [<i>lemoḥra’ot</i>]”</b> (II Kings 10:27) is read as the more refined <b><i>lemotza’ot</i>. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: <i>Lemoḥara’ot</i></b> is read <b>as it is written because it is</b> used here as an expression of <b>contempt for idol worship,</b> and it is therefore permissible to use an indelicate term.

### Part 17
Similarly, <b>Rav Naḥman said: All mockery</b> and obscenity <b>is forbidden except for mockery of idol worship, which is permitted, as it is written: “Bel bows down, Nevo stoops”</b> (Isaiah 46:1). The prophet mocks these idols by describing them as crouching in order to defecate. Additionally, <b>it is written: “They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden”</b> (Isaiah 46:2). <b>Rabbi Yannai said:</b> This principle that one is permitted to mock idol worship is derived <b>from here: “The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in dread for the calves of Beth-aven; for its people shall mourn over it, and its priests shall tremble for it, for its glory, because it is departed from it”</b> (Hosea 10:5). <b>Do not read</b> it is as <b>“its glory [<i>kevodo</i>],” rather</b> read it as <b>its burden [<i>keveido</i>],</b> meaning that it is unable to restrain itself from defecating.

### Part 18
<b>Rav Huna bar Manoaḥ said in the name of Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika: It is permitted for a Jew to say to a gentile: Take your idol and put it in your <i>shin tav</i>,</b> i.e., <i>shet</i>, buttocks. <b>Rav Ashi said: One whose reputation is tarnished,</b> i.e., he is known as a philanderer, <b>it is permitted to humiliate him</b> by calling him <b><i>gimmel sin</i>,</b> an acronym for <i>girta sarya</i>, son of a putrid harlot. <b>One whose reputation is commendable, it is permitted to</b> publicly <b>praise him, and one who praises him, blessings will rest upon his head.</b>
