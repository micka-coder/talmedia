### Part 1
The cities <b>Lod, and Ono, and Gei HeḤarashim</b> are cities <b>that have been surrounded</b> by walls <b>since the days of Joshua, son of Nun.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Did Joshua, son of Nun,</b> really <b>build these</b> cities? <b>Didn’t Elpaal build them</b> at a later date, <b>as it is written: “And the sons of Elpaal: Eber, and Misham, and Shemed, who built Ono and Lod, with its hamlets”</b> (I Chronicles 8:12)? The Gemara counters: <b>According to your reasoning,</b> that this verse proves that these cities were built later, you can also say that <b>Asa,</b> king of Judah, <b>built them, as it is written: “And he,</b> Asa, <b>built fortified cities in Judah”</b> (see II Chronicles 14:5). Therefore, it is apparent that these cities were built more than once.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: These</b> cities <b>were surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua, son of Nun,</b> and they <b>were destroyed in the days of the concubine in Gibea,</b> as they stood in the tribal territory of Benjamin, and in that war all of the cities of Benjamin were destroyed (see Judges, chapters 19–21). <b>Elpaal</b> then <b>came and built them</b> again. <b>They then fell</b> in the wars between Judah and Israel, and <b>Asa came and restored them.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara comments: The language of the verse <b>is also precise</b> according to this explanation, <b>as it is written </b>with regard to Asa: <b>“And he said to Judah: Let us build these cities”</b> (II Chronicles 14:6), which proves <b>by inference that they had</b> already <b>been cities at the outset,</b> and that he did not build new cities. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that it is so.

### Part 5
§ <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> also <b>said: Women are obligated in the reading of the Megilla, as they too were</b> significant partners <b>in that miracle. And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> also <b>said:</b> When <b>Purim occurs on Shabbat, one asks</b> questions <b>and expounds upon the subject of the day.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara raises a question with regard to the last <i>halakha</i>: <b>Why</b> was it necessary to <b>specify Purim?</b> The same principle applies <b>also to the Festivals, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Moses enacted for the Jewish people that they should ask</b> questions about <b>and expound upon the subject of the day:</b> They should occupy themselves with <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover on Passover,</b> with <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>Shavuot</i> on <i>Shavuot</i>, and</b> with the <b><i>halakhot</i> of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>on the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to mention <b>Purim, lest you say</b> that when Purim falls on Shabbat <b>we should decree</b> that it is prohibited to expound upon the <i>halakhot</i> of the day <b>due to</b> the concern of <b>Rabba,</b> who said that the reason the Megilla is not read on a Purim that falls on Shabbat is due to a concern that one carry the Megilla in the public domain. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>therefore teaches us</b> that expounding the <i>halakhot</i> of the day is not prohibited as a preventive measure lest one read the Megilla on Shabbat.

### Part 8
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> further <b>said</b> with regard to Purim: <b>A person is obligated to read the Megilla at night and</b> then <b>to repeat it</b> [<b><i>lishnota</i></b>] <b>during the day, as it is stated: “O my God, I call by day but You do not answer; and at night, and there is no surcease for me”</b> (Psalms 22:3), which alludes to reading the Megilla both by day and by night.

### Part 9
Some of the students who heard this statement <b>understood from it</b> that one is obligated <b>to read</b> the Megilla <b>at night and to study its</b> relevant tractate of <b>Mishna by day,</b> as the term <i>lishnota</i> can be understood to mean studying Mishna. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to them: It was explained to me</b> personally <b>by Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba himself</b> that the term <i>lishnota</i> here has a different connotation, <b>for example, as people say: I will conclude this section and repeat it,</b> i.e., I will review my studies. Similarly, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s statement means that one must repeat the reading of the Megilla by day after reading it at night.

### Part 10
The Gemara notes that this ruling <b>was also stated</b> by another <i>amora</i>, as <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo said</b> that <b>Ulla Bira’a said: A person is obligated to read the Megilla at night and</b> then <b>repeat it during the day, as it is stated: “So that my glory may sing praise to You and not be silent; O Lord, my God, I will give thanks to You forever”</b> (Psalms 30:13). The dual formulation of singing praise and not being silent alludes to reading the Megilla both by night and by day.

### Part 11
§ We learned in the mishna that residents of unwalled towns read the Megilla on the fourteenth of Adar; <b>however,</b> residents of <b>villages may advance</b> their reading <b>to the day of assembly,</b> the Monday or Thursday preceding Purim. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: The Sages were lenient with the villages</b> and allowed them <b>to advance</b> their reading of the Megilla <b>to the day of assembly, so that they</b> could be free to <b>provide water and food to their brethren in the cities</b> on the day of Purim. If everyone would be busy reading the Megilla on the fourteenth, the residents of the cities would not have enough to eat.
