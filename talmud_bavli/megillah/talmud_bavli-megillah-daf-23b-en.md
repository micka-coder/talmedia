### Part 1
<b>it is not necessary</b> to <b>also</b> add corresponding verses in the <i>haftara</i>.

### Part 2
<b>Rava strongly objects to this</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>But</b> there is the <i>haftara</i> that begins with the words: <b>“Add your burnt offerings”</b> (Jeremiah 7:21–28), <b>which does not have twenty-one verses, and</b> nevertheless <b>we read it.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as the topic is completed</b> in fewer than twenty-one verses, and it is not necessary to begin another topic merely to complete the number of verses.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is it true that <b>where the topic is not completed,</b> we do <b>not</b> read fewer than twenty-one verses? <b>Didn’t Rav Shmuel bar Abba say: Many times I stood before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> as a translator, <b>and when we had read ten verses he would say to us: Stop.</b> This indicates that a <i>haftara</i> need not be twenty-one verses. The Gemara answers: <b>In a place where there is a translator,</b> who translates each verse into Aramaic and adds additional explanation, <b>it is different.</b> In that case, it is not necessary for the <i>haftara</i> to consist of twenty-one verses, so as not to overburden the congregation, <b>as Rav Taḥalifa bar Shmuel taught: They taught</b> that twenty-one verses must be read from the <i>haftara</i> <b>only</b> in <b>a place where there is no translator; but in a place where there is a translator, one may stop</b> even before that.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One does not recite the</b> introductory prayers and <b>blessing [<i>poresin</i>]</b> before <b><i>Shema</i>; nor does one pass before the ark</b> to repeat the <i>Amida</i> prayer; <b>nor do the</b> priests <b>lift their hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction; <b>nor is the Torah read</b> in public; <b>nor does one conclude with</b> a reading from <b>the Prophets</b> [<i>haftara</i>] in the presence of fewer than ten men.

### Part 5
<b>And one does not observe</b> the practice of <b>standing up and sitting down</b> for the delivery of eulogies at a funeral service; <b>nor does one recite the mourners’ blessing or comfort mourners</b> in two lines after the funeral; <b>or</b> recite the <b>bridegrooms’ blessing; and one does not invite</b> others to recite Grace after Meals, i.e., conduct a <i>zimmun</i>, <b>with the name</b> of God, <b>with fewer than ten</b> men present. If one consecrated <b>land</b> and now wishes to redeem it, the land must be assessed by <b>nine</b> men <b>and one priest,</b> for a total of ten. <b>And similarly,</b> assessing the value of <b>a person</b> who has pledged his own value to the Temple must be undertaken by ten people, one of whom must be a priest.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> i.e., that ten people are needed in each of these cases, derived? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is <b>as the verse states: “And I shall be hallowed among the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 22:32), which indicates that <b>any expression of sanctity may not be</b> recited in a quorum of <b>fewer than ten</b> men.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> in the verse may this <b>be inferred?</b> The Gemara responds that it must be understood <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: It is inferred</b> by means of a verbal analogy [<i>gezera shava</i>] between the words <b>“among,” “among.” Here, it is written: “And I shall be hallowed among the children of Israel,” and there,</b> with regard to Korah’s congregation, <b>it is written “Separate yourselves from among this congregation”</b> (Numbers 16:21). Just as with regard to Korah the reference is to ten men, so too, the name of God is to be hallowed in a quorum of ten men.

### Part 8
The connotation of ten associated with the word “among” in the portion of Korah is, in turn, <b>inferred</b> by means of another verbal analogy between the word <b>“congregation”</b> written there and the word <b>“congregation”</b> written in reference to the ten spies who slandered Eretz Yisrael, <b>as it is written there: “How long shall I bear with this evil congregation?”</b> (Numbers 14:27). Consequently, <b>just as there,</b> in the case of the spies, it was a congregation of <b>ten</b> people, as there were twelve spies altogether, and Joshua and Caleb were not included in the evil congregation, <b>so too, here,</b> in the case of Korah, the reference is to a congregation of <b>ten</b> people. The first several items mentioned in the mishna are expressions of sanctity, and they consequently require a quorum of ten.

### Part 9
§ We learned in the mishna: <b>And one does not observe</b> the practice of <b>standing up and sitting down</b> for the delivery of eulogies at a funeral service <b>with fewer than ten</b> men present. As this is not an expression of sanctity, it is therefore necessary to explain why a quorum is required. The Gemara explains: <b>Since</b> the leader of the funeral procession <b>is required to say: Stand, dear</b> friends, <b>stand; sit down, dear</b> friends, <b>sit down,</b> when there are <b>fewer than ten it is not proper conduct</b> to speak in such a dignified style.

### Part 10
We also learned in the mishna that <b>one does not recite the mourners’ blessing and the bridegrooms’ blessing</b> with fewer than ten men present. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the mourners’ blessing? The blessing</b> recited <b>in the square</b> next to the cemetery. Following the burial, those who participated in the funeral would assemble in the square and bless the mourners that God should comfort them, <b>as Rabbi Yitzḥak said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The mourners’ blessing</b> is recited only <b>with ten</b> men present, <b>and mourners</b> themselves <b>are not included in the count. The bridegrooms’ blessing</b> is also recited only <b>with ten</b> men present, <b>and bridegrooms</b> themselves <b>are included in the count.</b> Consequently, only nine other men are needed.

### Part 11
We learned further in the mishna: <b>And one does not invite</b> others to recite Grace after Meals, i.e., conduct a <i>zimmun</i>, in order to thank God <b>for</b> one’s <b>nourishment, with the name</b> of God, <b>with fewer than ten</b> men present. <b>Since one is required to say: Let us bless our Lord,</b> in the presence of <b>fewer than ten</b> it is <b>not proper conduct</b> to mention the name of God.

### Part 12
§ If one consecrated <b>land</b> and now wishes to redeem it, the land must be assessed by <b>nine</b> Israelites <b>and one priest,</b> for a total of ten. <b>And similarly,</b> assessing the value of <b>a person</b> who has pledged his own value to the Temple must be undertaken by ten people, one of whom must be a priest. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that consecrated land must be assessed by ten people, one of whom is a priest, derived?

### Part 13
<b>Shmuel said:</b> The word <b>priest</b> is <b>written ten</b> times <b>in the</b> Torah <b>portion</b> that addresses the redemption of consecrated property, indicating that ten people are required to assess the value of such property (Leviticus, chapter 27). <b>One</b> instance of the word is needed <b>for itself,</b> to indicate that a priest must participate in the assessment. <b>And one</b> instance is needed <b>to exclude</b> all non-priests from fulfilling that role. <b>And</b> all <b>the other</b> instances of the word <b>are restrictions following</b> other <b>restrictions,</b> and there is a general hermeneutical principle that <b>one restriction after another</b> serves <b>only to amplify.</b> Therefore, each additional time the word priest is repeated, it extends the criteria applied to appraisers, so as to allow non-priests to participate. Consequently, the assessment may be carried out by <b>nine</b> ordinary <b>Israelites and one priest.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> on the basis of this principle, <b>say</b> that the first usage of the term is restrictive and requires a priest for the assessment; the second usage amplifies and allows for a non-priest; the third usage again requires a priest; the fourth usage allows for a non-priest; and so on. Consequently, the assessment must be carried out by <b>five priests and five</b> ordinary <b>Israelites.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is <b>difficult,</b> as the derivation has not been sufficiently explained.

### Part 15
We learned in the mishna: <b>And similarly,</b> assessing the value of <b>a person</b> who has pledged his own value to the Temple must be undertaken by ten people, one of whom must be a priest. The Gemara asks: <b>Can a person become consecrated</b> and thereby require redemption?

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to one who says: My assessment</b> is incumbent <b>upon me,</b> and thereby pledges to donate a sum of money equivalent to his own monetary value to the Temple treasury, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says: My assessment</b> is incumbent <b>upon me,</b> the court <b>assesses him as</b> though he were <b>a slave</b> in order to determine the amount he is obligated to donate to the Temple treasury. <b>And a slave is compared to land, as it is written</b> with regard to slaves: <b>“And you shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession”</b> (Leviticus 25:46). Consequently, the same criteria that apply to assessing consecrated land apply to assessing the monetary value of an individual.

### Part 17
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who reads from the Torah</b> in the synagogue <b>should not read fewer than three verses. And</b> when it is being translated, <b>he should not read to the translator more than one verse</b> at a time, so that the translator will not become confused.
