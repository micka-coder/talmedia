### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow and one for whom benefit from</b> another’s <b>food is forbidden by vow is only</b> with regard to <b>stepping foot</b> on his property, <b>and</b> with regard to borrowing <b>utensils</b> from him <b>that one does not use</b> in the <b>preparation of food,</b> but for other purposes; as those two benefits are prohibited to the former, but permitted to the latter.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers <b>that with regard to the matter of utensils that one uses</b> in <b>preparation of food,</b> both <b>this,</b> one who vowed that any benefit is forbidden, <b>and that,</b> one who vowed that benefit from food is forbidden, <b>are equal.</b> It is prohibited for both to derive benefit from utensils used in the preparation of food.

### Part 3
The mishna stated that for one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow, <b>stepping foot</b> on the latter’s property is prohibited. The Gemara asks: What benefit is that? <b>Aren’t people not particular</b> about other people treading on their property? <b>Rava said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna taught? It is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said: Overlooking is prohibited</b> in the case <b>of one for whom benefit is forbidden by vow.</b> For one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow, benefit is forbidden even in matters with regard to which one is typically not particular and overlooks others’ use of his property, e.g., stepping foot on it.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between</b> animals consecrated to the Temple as <b>vow</b> offerings <b>and</b> animals consecrated as <b>gift</b> offerings <b>is only that</b> in the case of <b>vow</b> offerings, if they died or were lost before being sacrificed on the altar, one <b>is obligated in</b> the <b>responsibility</b> to replace <b>them, and</b> in the case of <b>gift</b> offerings, if they died or were lost, one <b>is not obligated in</b> the <b>responsibility</b> to replace <b>them.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers <b>that with regard to the matter of</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not be slack</b> to pay one’s pledges, both <b>this,</b> a vow offering, <b>and that,</b> a gift offering, <b>are equal.</b> If one delayed bringing either a vow offering or a gift offering, he violates the prohibition.

### Part 6
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there: Which is</b> the case of <b>a vow</b> offering? It is <b>one who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt-offering. Which is</b> the case of <b>a gift</b> offering? It is <b>one who says: This</b> animal is a <b>burnt-offering. And what is</b> the difference <b>between a vow</b> offering <b>and a gift</b> offering? With regard to <b>vow</b> offerings, if the animals <b>died or were stolen or were lost,</b> the one who vowed <b>is obligated in</b> the <b>responsibility</b> to replace <b>them,</b> as he undertook to bring a burnt-offering and he is not absolved of his obligation until he brings the offering. With regard to <b>gift</b> offerings, however, if the animals <b>died or were stolen or were lost,</b> the one who vowed <b>is not obligated in</b> the <b>responsibility</b> to replace <b>them.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a burnt-offering, that the verse states: <b>“And it shall be accepted for him to make atonement upon him”</b> (Leviticus 1:4). <b>Rabbi Shimon says: That which is</b> incumbent <b>upon him,</b> i.e., which he accepted as a personal obligation, <b>he bears responsibility</b> to replace <b>it</b> if it died or was stolen; <b>however, that which is not</b> incumbent <b>upon him,</b> i.e., that which he did not accept as a personal obligation but which he designated as an offering, he <b>does not bear responsibility</b> to replace <b>it.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> that conclusion <b>be inferred</b> from the verse? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said: Since he said</b> it is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a burnt-offering, he is <b>considered as one who bears</b> it <b>upon his shoulders.</b> The expression: Upon me, indicates an assumption of responsibility to bring an offering.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between a <i>zav</i> who experiences two emissions</b> of a pus-like discharge from his penis <b>and one who experiences three</b> emissions <b>is only</b> that the <i>zav</i> who experienced three emissions is obligated to bring <b>an offering</b> after he recovers, in order to complete his purification process.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers <b>that with regard to the matter of</b> transmitting ritual impurity to a surface designated for <b>lying and</b> a surface designated for <b>sitting, and</b> similarly with regard to <b>the counting of seven</b> days clean of emissions so that he may immerse in a ritual bath as part of the purification process, both <b>this,</b> i.e., one who experienced two emissions, <b>and that,</b> one who experienced three emissions, <b>are equal.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Simai says: The verse enumerated two</b> emissions: “When any man has an emission out of his flesh, due to his emission he is impure” (Leviticus 15:2), <b>and it called</b> the <i>zav</i> <b>impure.</b> Another verse enumerated <b>three</b> emissions: “And this shall be his impurity in his emission: Whether his flesh runs with his emission, or his flesh be stopped from his emission, it is his impurity” (Leviticus 15:3), <b>and it</b> too <b>called him impure. How so?</b> If he is impure after two emissions, for what purpose does the Torah mention three? It is to teach: <b>Two</b> emissions <b>to</b> establish <b>impurity and three to</b> render him liable to bring <b>an offering.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara raises an alternative. <b>And say</b> instead: <b>Two</b> emissions <b>to</b> establish <b>impurity but not to</b> render him liable to bring <b>an offering; three</b> emissions <b>to</b> render him liable to bring <b>an offering, but not to</b> establish <b>impurity.</b> The Gemara rejects this: That is impossible, as <b>you</b> can <b>say</b> that <b>until he experienced three</b> emissions, <b>he</b> already <b>experienced two,</b> and therefore he is impure in the case of three emissions as well.

### Part 13
The Gemara raises a different alternative. <b>And say</b> instead: <b>Two</b> emissions <b>to</b> render him liable to bring <b>an offering, but not to</b> establish <b>impurity; three</b> emissions <b>to</b> establish <b>impurity as well.</b> The Gemara answers that this suggestion <b>cannot enter your mind, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“And the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord from his emission”</b> (Leviticus 15:15). The preposition “from” that precedes the words “his emissions” indicates that <b>some</b> with the status of a <b><i>zav</i> bring an offering and some</b> with the status of a <b><i>zav</i> do not bring an offering. How so?</b> If <b>he experienced three</b> emissions, <b>he brings</b> an offering; if he experienced <b>two</b> emissions, <b>he does not bring</b> an offering.

### Part 14
The <i>baraita</i> suggests: <b>Or</b> perhaps, <b>it</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than that if <b>one experienced two</b> emissions, <b>he brings</b> an offering; if <b>he experienced three</b> emissions, <b>he does not bring</b> an offering. The Gemara rejects this: That is impossible, as <b>you</b> can <b>say</b> that <b>until he experienced three</b> emissions, <b>he</b> already <b>experienced two,</b> and therefore he is obligated to bring an offering in the case of three emissions as well.

### Part 15
The Gemara comments: <b>It was necessary</b> to cite the proof <b>of Rabbi Simai</b> based on the number of mentions of the word emissions in the two verses, <b>and it was necessary</b> to cite the proof from the words: <b>From his emission. As if</b> the difference between two and three emissions was derived <b>from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Simai, I would have said in accordance with our question:</b> Perhaps one who experiences two emissions brings an offering, and one who experiences three emissions is impure and brings an offering. Therefore, <b>it teaches us: From his emission. And if</b> the difference between two and three emissions was derived from the term: <b>From his emission, I would not have known how many emissions</b> render him liable to bring an offering, only that some with the status of a <i>zav</i> are not required to bring an offering. Therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> the proof cited <b>by Rabbi Simai.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And now that you said</b> that the term: <b>From his emission,</b> is exclusionary and comes <b>for derivation, what do you derive from</b> the verse: <b>“And when the <i>zav</i> is cleansed from his emission”</b> (Leviticus 15:13)?

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is needed to</b> derive <b>that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. It is written: <b>“And when the <i>zav</i> is cleansed</b> from his emission, then he shall count to himself seven days for his purification” (Leviticus 15:13), <b>when</b> his emissions <b>cease.</b> The <i>baraita</i> infers from the term: <b>From his emission,</b> that he needs to be cleansed only <b>from his emission, but not from his emission and his leprosy.</b> If one was both a <i>zav</i> and also had leprosy, he need not wait until he is asymptomatic of his leprosy before counting seven clean days. Rather, he counts seven clean days, and after the leprosy symptoms cease, he immerses for both impurities. <b>“From his emission, then he shall count”: This teaches concerning a <i>zav</i> who experienced two emissions, that he</b> too <b>requires a count of seven</b> clean days.

### Part 18
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But</b> in order to derive that <i>halakha</i>, the verse is unnecessary, as <b>isn’t it</b> only <b>logical?</b> If a <i>zav</i> who experienced two emissions <b>renders</b> a surface designated for <b>lying and</b> a surface designated for <b>sitting ritually impure</b> and all strictures of a <i>zav</i> apply to him, <b>wouldn’t he require a count of seven</b> clean days to become purified?
