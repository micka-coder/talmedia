<b>and one may not adorn oneself inside them; nor may one wander about inside them; nor may one enter them in the sun</b> for protection <b>from the sun, or in the rain</b> to find shelter <b>from the rain; nor may one offer a eulogy inside them for an individual,</b> which is a private event. <b>However, one may read</b> the Bible <b>inside them, and one may study</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>inside them, and one may offer a eulogy inside them for</b> a Torah scholar, if <b>the public</b> attends the eulogy.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> does this apply? <b>When</b> the synagogues are <b>occupied</b> by the people using them. <b>But when they are in</b> a state of <b>ruin, they should be left alone</b> so that <b>grass will sprout up inside them. And</b> that grass <b>should not be picked</b> and removed, <b>due to</b> the <b>anguish</b> that it will bring to those who see it. It will remind them of the disrepair of the synagogue and the need to rebuild it.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: Why did Rabbi Yehuda discuss the <i>halakha</i> about <b>grass? Who mentioned</b> anything <b>about it?</b> The Gemara explains: The text of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and is teaching the following: And</b> among the other things that may be done in synagogues, <b>they should</b> also be sure to <b>sweep them and</b> to <b>sprinkle</b> their floors with water, <b>in order that grass not sprout up in them. Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> does this apply? <b>When</b> the synagogues are <b>occupied</b> by the people using them, <b>but when they are in</b> a state of <b>ruin, they should be left alone</b> so that grass <b>will sprout up inside them.</b> If <b>grass did sprout up, it should not be removed, due to</b> the <b>anguish</b> that this will bring to those who see it.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Asi said: Synagogues in Babylonia are built</b> from the outset <b>with a stipulation</b> that they not have the full sanctity of a synagogue, in order that it be permitted to use them for the community’s general needs. <b>But nevertheless,</b> one <b>should not act inside them with frivolity.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> meant by <b>this?</b> One should not make business <b>calculations</b> in a synagogue.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Asi said:</b> With regard to <b>a synagogue in which</b> people <b>make</b> business <b>calculations, they will</b> eventually <b>keep a corpse inside it overnight.</b> The Gemara questions the wording of this dictum: <b>Can it</b> really <b>enter your mind</b> to say that <b>they will</b> ever actually <b>keep a corpse inside it overnight?</b> Could it really be that <b>there will not be any other alternative? Rather,</b> Rav Asi means that as a punishment for acting with frivolity people in the community will die, including those who have no family, and so <b>ultimately they will</b> have to <b>keep a corpse with no one to bury it [<i>met mitzva</i>] overnight</b> in the synagogue.

### Part 6
§ The <i>baraita</i> taught: <b>And one may not adorn oneself inside them. Rava said:</b> The prohibition applies only to laypeople, but <b>Torah scholars and their disciples are permitted</b> to do so, <b>as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b><i>Bei</i> of the Sages,</b> which is used to describe a study hall? It is a shortened form of <b>house [<i>beita</i>] of the Sages.</b> In order to facilitate the constant presence of the Torah scholars in the study hall, it is permitted for them to use the hall as though it were their home.

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> continued: <b>And nor may one enter them in the sun</b> for protection <b>from the sun, or in the rain</b> to find shelter <b>from the rain.</b> The Gemara explains: This <b>is similar to that</b> case of <b>Ravina and Rav Adda bar Mattana. They were standing and asking a question of Rava,</b> when <b>a shower [<i>zilḥa</i>] of rain began</b> to fall upon them. <b>They</b> all <b>entered the synagogue, saying: Our having entered the synagogue is not due to the rain,</b> that we stay dry; <b>rather, it is due to</b> the fact that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> we were discussing <b>requires clarity like the day the north wind [<i>istena</i>]</b> blows and the sky is perfectly clear. Therefore, we are entering the synagogue for the sake of studying Torah, which is certainly permitted.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: If a person needs to summon an individual from</b> inside <b>a synagogue, what</b> should he do, since it is not permitted to enter a synagogue just for that purpose? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: If he is a young Torah scholar, let him recite a <i>halakha</i></b> upon entering the synagogue; <b>and if he is a <i>tanna</i></b> who memorizes large numbers of <i>mishnayot</i>, <b>let him recite</b> various <b><i>mishnayot</i>; and if he is an expert in</b> the <b>Bible, let him recite a verse; and if</b> he is <b>not</b> able to do even this, <b>let him say to a child: Recite for me a verse</b> that you have learned today. <b>Alternatively, he should remain</b> in the synagogue <b>for a short</b> time <b>and</b> only afterward <b>stand up</b> and leave.

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And one may offer a eulogy inside them for</b> a Torah scholar if <b>the public</b> attends the eulogy. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances of a eulogy for the public? Rav Ḥisda depicted</b> a case: <b>For example, a eulogy</b> for a Torah scholar <b>at which Rav Sheshet is present.</b> Owing to his presence, many people will come. <b>Rav Sheshet</b> himself <b>depicted</b> another case: <b>For example, a eulogy at which Rav Ḥisda is present.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara offers another example: <b>Rafram</b> once <b>eulogized his daughter-in-law inside a synagogue. He said: Due to my honor and</b> the honor <b>of the deceased, everyone will come</b> to the eulogy. It will consequently be a public event, and it is therefore permitted to hold it in a synagogue. Similarly, <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> once <b>eulogized a certain Sage inside a synagogue. He said: Whether due to my honor, or whether due to the honor of the deceased, everyone will come</b> to the eulogy.

### Part 11
<b>Reish Lakish</b> once <b>eulogized a certain young Torah scholar who was frequently</b> present <b>in Eretz Yisrael and who used to study <i>halakha</i> in the twenty-fourth row</b> of the study hall.He sat so far back because he was not one of the principal scholars. Nevertheless, when he died, Reish Lakish <b>said: Alas, Eretz Yisrael has lost a great man.</b>

### Part 12
In contrast, there was <b>a certain man who used to study <i>halakha</i>, the <i>Sifra</i>, and the <i>Sifrei</i>, and the <i>Tosefta</i>, and he died.</b> People <b>came and said to Rav Naḥman: Let the Master eulogize him. He said</b> to them: <b>How can I eulogize him?</b> Should I say: <b>Alas, a basket filled with books is lost?</b> This would not be true. Although the man studied many areas of Torah, he was not proficient in them.

### Part 13
The Gemara compares the conduct of Reish Lakish in Eretz Yisrael to that of Rav Naḥman in Babylonia. <b>Come</b> and <b>see what</b> the difference is <b>between the harsh</b> scholars <b>of Eretz Yisrael and the saintly ones of Babylonia.</b> Although Reish Lakish was known for his harsh nature, he was still more respectful than Rav Naḥman, who was known for his saintliness.

### Part 14
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Avot</i> 1:13): <b>And one who makes use of the crown [<i>taga</i>]</b> of Torah learning <b>will perish</b> from the world. <b>Reish Lakish taught: This</b> is referring to <b>one who</b> allows himself to be <b>served by one who studies <i>halakhot</i>,</b> which is <b>the crown of the Torah.</b>

### Part 15
<b>And Ulla said:</b> It is better that <b>a person should be served by one who studies four</b> orders of the Mishna, <b>and he should not</b> allow himself to <b>be served by one who teaches</b> to others <b>four</b> orders of the Mishna, <b>as in that</b> case <b>of Reish Lakish. He was traveling along the road</b> when <b>he reached</b> a deep <b>puddle of water. A certain man came</b> and <b>placed him upon his shoulders and</b> began <b>transferring him</b> to the other side. Reish Lakish <b>said to him: Have you read</b> the Bible? <b>He said to him: I have read</b> it. He then asked: <b>Have you studied</b> the Mishna? He answered him: <b>I have studied four orders of the Mishna.</b> Reish Lakish then <b>said to him: You have hewn</b> these <b>four mountains and</b> yet <b>you bear the weight of the son of Lakish upon your shoulders?</b> It is inappropriate for you to carry me; <b>throw the son of Lakish into the water.</b>

### Part 16
The man <b>said to</b> Reish Lakish: <b>It is pleasing for me to serve the Master</b> in this way. Reish Lakish said to him: <b>If so, learn from me this matter that Rabbi Zeira said.</b> In this way you will be considered my disciple, and it will then be appropriate for you to serve me. <b>Jewish women were strict upon themselves in that even if they see a spot of</b> menstrual <b>blood</b> that is only the size <b>of a mustard seed they wait on its account seven clean</b> days before immersing themselves in a ritual bath to purify themselves.

### Part 17
<b>The school of Eliyahu taught: Anyone who studies <i>halakhot</i></b> every day, <b>he is guaranteed that he is destined for the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “His ways [<i>halikhot</i>] are eternal”</b> (Habakkuk 3:6): <b>Do not read</b> the verse as <b><i>halikhot</i> [ways]; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>halakhot</i>.</b> Consequently, the verse indicates that the study of the <i>halakhot</i> brings one to eternal life.

### Part 18
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:
