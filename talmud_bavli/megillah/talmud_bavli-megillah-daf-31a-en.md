### Part 1
they read the portion of <b>blessings and curses</b> (Leviticus, chapter 26). <b>One should not interrupt</b> the reading of the <b>curses</b> by having two different people read them. <b>Rather, one person reads all of them.</b>

### Part 2
<b>On Mondays, and on Thursdays,</b> and <b>on Shabbat during the afternoon</b> service, <b>they read in accordance</b> with the regular weekly <b>order,</b> i.e., they proceed to read the first section of the Torah portion that follows the portion that was read on the previous Shabbat morning. <b>However,</b> these readings <b>are not counted</b> as a progression <b>in the reckoning</b> of reading the Torah portions, i.e., they do not proceed on Monday to read the section that immediately follows the section read on Shabbat during the afternoon, and then the following section on Thursday. Rather, until the reading on the following Shabbat morning, they return to and read the same first section of the Torah portion that follows the portion that was read on the previous Shabbat morning.

### Part 3
On Festivals and holidays, they read a portion relating to the character of the day, <b>as</b> it <b>is stated: “And Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:44), which indicates that part of <b>the mitzva</b> of the Festivals is <b>that</b> the people <b>should read</b> the portion relating to them, <b>each one in its</b> appointed <b>time.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>On</b> the first day of <b>Passover,</b> the congregation <b>reads from the portion of the Festivals</b> (Leviticus 22:26–23:44), <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the account of the <b>Passover</b> celebrated at <b>Gilgal</b> (Joshua 5:2–14). The Gemara comments: <b>And nowadays,</b> in the Diaspora, <b>when there are two</b> Festival <b>days of Passover, on the first day</b> they read as the <i>haftara</i> the account of the <b>Passover</b> celebrated <b>at Gilgal, and on the next day</b> they read <b>from</b> the account of the <b>Passover</b> observed <b>by Josiah</b> (II Kings 23).

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And on</b> the <b>other days of Passover, one collects and reads</b> from various Torah portions of <b>matters</b> relating <b>to Passover.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are these</b> portions? <b>Rav Pappa said: A mnemonic</b> for them is <b><i>mem</i>, <i>alef</i>, <i>peh vav</i>.</b> Each letter stands for a different reading: <i>Mem</i> for the portion of: “Draw out [<i>mishkhu</i>] and take your lambs” (Exodus 12:21–51); <i>alef</i> for the portion of “If <b>[</b><i>im</i>] you lend money to any of My people” (Exodus 22:24–23:19<i>)</i>; <i>peh</i> for the portion of “Hew [<i>pesol</i>] for yourself” (Exodus 34:1–26); and <i>vav</i> for the portion “And the Lord spoke [<i>vaydabber</i>]” (Numbers 9:1–14).

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>On the last Festival day of Passover, they read</b> the portion of <b>“And it came to pass, when</b> Pharaoh <b>let</b> the people <b>go”</b> (Exodus 13:17–15:26), because it includes the account of the splitting of the Red Sea, <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion <b>“And David spoke”</b> (II Samuel 22), which is the song of David. <b>And</b> in the Diaspora, <b>on the next day,</b> the eighth day of Passover, they read the portion <b>“All the firstborns”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19–16:17), <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion of <b>“This very day”</b> (Isaiah 10:32–12:6), because it discusses the downfall of Sennacherib, which occurred on the night of Passover.

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said: And nowadays,</b> on the eight days of Passover in the Diaspora, <b>everyone is accustomed to read</b> portions that are indicated by the mnemonic phrase: <b>Draw the bull, sanctify with money, hew in the wilderness, send the firstborn.</b> This alludes to the following portions: “Draw out and take your lambs” (Exodus 12:21–51) and “A bull or a sheep” (Leviticus 22:26–23:44); “Sanctify to Me all the firstborn” (Exodus 13:1–16) and “If you lend money to any of My people” (Exodus 22:24–23:19); “Hew for yourself” (Exodus 34:1–26) and “And the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai” (Numbers 9:1–14); “And it came to pass, when Pharaoh let the people go” (Exodus 13:17–15:26) and “All the firstborns” (Deuteronomy 15:19–16:17).

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>On <i>Shavuot</i></b> they read the portion of <b>“Seven weeks,” and they read as the <i>haftara</i> from Habakkuk,</b> chapter 2, since it mentions the giving of the Torah at Sinai. <b>Others say:</b> They read the portion of <b>“In the third month”</b> (Exodus 19:1–20:23), which describes the giving of the Torah, <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i> from</b> the account of <b>the</b> Divine <b>Chariot</b> (Ezekiel 1). The Gemara comments: <b>And nowadays,</b> in the Diaspora, <b>when there are two days</b> of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>we act in accordance with both</b> opinions, <b>but in the reverse order.</b> On the first day they read the portion of “In the third month,” and on the second day they read the portion of “Seven weeks.”

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>On Rosh HaShana</b> they read the portion of <b>“On the seventh month</b> on the first of the month” (Numbers 29:1–6) <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i> “Is Ephraim My dear son?”</b> (Jeremiah 31:1–20), as it contains the verse: “I earnestly remember him still,” which recalls God’s love for His people. <b>And some say</b> that they read <b>“And the Lord visited Sarah”</b> (Genesis 21), which describes how God blessed her that she should have a child, and, according to tradition, God blessed her on Rosh HaShana. <b>And they read as the <i>haftara</i> from</b> the account of <b>Hannah</b> (I Samuel 1:1–2:10), who, according to tradition, was also blessed on Rosh HaShana that she should have a child.

### Part 10
The Gemara comments: <b>And nowadays, when there are two days</b> of Rosh HaShana, on <b>the first day</b> they read Genesis 21 <b>in accordance</b> with the opinion cited as: <b>Some say. And on the next day</b> they read <b>“And God tested Abraham”</b> (Genesis 22), in order to mention the merit of the binding of Isaac on the day of God’s judgment, <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i> “Is Ephraim My dear son?”</b>

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>On Yom Kippur they read</b> the portion of <b>“After the death”</b> (Leviticus 16)<b>, and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion of <b>“For thus says the High and Lofty One”</b> (Isaiah 57:14–58:14), which deals with fasting and repentance. <b>And during the afternoon</b> service they <b>read from</b> the portion detailing <b>forbidden sexual relations</b> (Leviticus 18) to convey the severity of these transgressions, so that if anyone transgressed any of these prohibitions he will repent on Yom Kippur. <b>And they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the book of <b>Jonah,</b> which mentions the repentance of the people of Nineveh.

### Part 12
Having mentioned the <i>haftara</i> read on Yom Kippur, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Wherever you find</b> a reference in the Bible to <b>the might of the Holy One, Blessed be He, you</b> also <b>find</b> a reference to <b>His humility</b> adjacent to it. Evidence of <b>this fact is written in the Torah, repeated in the Prophets, and stated a third time in the Writings.</b>

### Part 13
<b>It is written in the Torah: “For the Lord your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “He executes the judgment of the fatherless and widow”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:18), displaying his humility in caring for even the weakest parts of society. <b>It is repeated in the Prophets:</b> “For <b>thus says the High and Lofty One that inhabits eternity, Whose name is sacred”</b> (Isaiah 57:15), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward:</b> “In the high and holy place I dwell <b>with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit,</b> to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones” (Isaiah 57:15). <b>It is stated a third time in the Writings, as it is written: “Extol Him Who rides upon the clouds, Whose name is the Lord”</b> (Psalms 68:5), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “A father of the fatherless, and a judge of widows”</b> (Psalms 68:6).

### Part 14
The <i>baraita</i> continues: On <b>the first Festival day of <i>Sukkot</i>, they read from the portion of the Festivals</b> found <b>in Leviticus</b> (Leviticus 22:26–23:44), <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion of <b>“Behold the day of the Lord comes”</b> (Zechariah 14), which mentions the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>. The Gemara comments: <b>And nowadays,</b> in the Diaspora, <b>when there are two</b> Festival <b>days</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>on the next day, they read the same</b> Torah portion. But <b>what do they read as the <i>haftara</i>?</b> They read the portion of <b>“And</b> all the men of Israel <b>assembled themselves to King Solomon”</b> (I Kings 8:2–21), which describes events that took place on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>.

### Part 15
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And on all the other days of <i>Sukkot</i>, they read</b> selections <b>from</b> the portion of <b>the offerings of <i>Sukkot</i></b> found in the book of Numbers, chapter 29. <b>On the last Festival day</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, i.e., the Eighth Day of Assembly, <b>they read</b> the portion of <b>“All the firstborns,”</b> starting with the portion of “You shall tithe,” since it includes many <b>mitzvot and statutes</b> relating to gifts for the poor, who should be helped during this period of rejoicing, and it concludes with the <i>halakhot</i> governing <b>firstborns</b> (Deuteronomy 14:22–16:17). <b>And they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion of <b>“And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end</b> of praying” (I Kings 8:54–9:1), which occurred on that day. <b>On the next day,</b> the second day of the Eighth Day of Assembly in the Diaspora, <b>they read</b> the portion of <b>“And this is the blessing”</b> (Deuteronomy, chapters 33–34) until the end of the Torah, <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i> “And Solomon stood”</b> (I Kings 8:22–53).

### Part 16
<b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> When <b>Shabbat occurs on</b> one of <b>the intermediate days</b> of a Festival, <b>whether on Passover or on <i>Sukkot</i>, they read the Torah</b> portion of <b>“See, You</b> say to me” (Exodus 33:12–34:26), as it includes the <i>halakhot</i> of the Festivals and the intermediate days. <b>They read as the <i>haftara</i>, on Passover,</b> from the portion of <b>the dry bones</b> (Ezekiel 37:1–14), which portrays redemption from servitude, <b>and on <i>Sukkot</i></b> they read “And it shall come to pass <b>on that day when Gog shall come”</b> (Ezekiel 38:18–39:16), which speaks of the future redemption.

### Part 17
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>On</b> each day of <b>Hanukkah</b> they read a selection <b>from</b> the portion of the dedication of the altar by <b>the</b> tribal <b>princes</b> (Numbers 7), <b>and they read as the <i>haftara</i> from</b> the portion of <b>the lamps of Zechariah</b> (Zechariah 2:14–4:7). The Gemara comments: <b>And if it occurs that there are two <i>Shabbatot</i></b> during Hanukkah, <b>on the first</b> Shabbat they read <b>from</b> the portion of <b>the lamps of Zechariah, and on the latter one</b> they read <b>from</b> the portion of <b>the lamps of Solomon</b> (I Kings 7:40–50), which discusses the lamps in the Temple.

### Part 18
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>On Purim</b> they read the portion of <b>“And Amalek came”</b> (Exodus 17:8–16). <b>On the New Moon</b> they read the portion of <b>“And in the beginnings of your month”</b> (Numbers 28:11–15). When <b>the New Moon occurs on Shabbat, they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion that concludes with <b>“And it shall come to pass that every New Moon,</b> and every Shabbat, shall all flesh come to bow down on the ground before Me” (Isaiah 66), as it mentions both Shabbat and the New Moon. When the New Moon <b>occurs on Sunday, on the previous day,</b> i.e., Shabbat, <b>they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the portion of <b>“And Jonathan said to him: Tomorrow is the New Moon”</b> (I Samuel 20:18–42), which describes events that took place on the eve of the New Moon.
