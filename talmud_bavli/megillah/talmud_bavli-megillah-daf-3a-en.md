<b>stood by way of a miracle?</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> two forms of these letters <b>did exist</b> at that time, <b>but</b> the people <b>did not know which</b> one of them was to be used <b>in the middle of the word and which at the end of the word, and the Seers came and established</b> that <b>the open</b> forms are to used be <b>in the middle of the word and the closed</b> forms <b>at the end of the word.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately,</b> however, doesn’t the phrase <b>“these are the commandments”</b> (Leviticus 27:34) indicate <b>that a prophet is not permitted to initiate any matter</b> of <i>halakha</i> <b>from now on? Rather,</b> it may be suggested that the final letters already existed at the time of the giving of the Torah, but over the course of time the people <b>forgot them,</b> and the prophets <b>then</b> came and <b>reestablished them.</b>

### Part 4
§ The Gemara cites another ruling of Rabbi Yirmeya or Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> who said: <b>The</b> Aramaic <b>translation of the Torah</b> used in the synagogues <b>was composed by Onkelos the convert based on</b> the teachings of <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua. The</b> Aramaic <b>translation of the Prophets was composed by Yonatan ben Uzziel based on</b> a tradition going back to the last prophets, <b>Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</b> The Gemara relates that when Yonatan ben Uzziel wrote his translation, <b>Eretz Yisrael quaked</b> over an area of <b>four hundred parasangs [<i>parsa</i>] by four hundred parasangs,</b> and <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said: Who is this who has revealed My secrets to mankind?</b>

### Part 5
<b>Yonatan ben Uzziel stood up on his feet and said: I am the one who has revealed Your secrets to mankind</b> through my translation. However, <b>it is revealed and known to You that I did this not for my</b> own <b>honor, and not for the honor of the house of</b> my <b>father, but rather</b> it was <b>for Your honor</b> that <b>I did this, so that discord not increase among the Jewish people.</b> In the absence of an accepted translation, people will disagree about the meaning of obscure verses, but with a translation, the meaning will be clear.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> Yonatan ben Uzziel <b>also sought to reveal a translation of the Writings,</b> but <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said to him: It is enough for you</b> that you translated the Prophets. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that he was denied permission to translate the Writings? <b>Because it has in it</b> a revelation of <b>the end,</b> when the <b>Messiah</b> will arrive. The end is foretold in a cryptic manner in the book of Daniel, and were the book of Daniel translated, the end would become manifestly revealed to all.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Was the translation of the Torah</b> really <b>composed by Onkelos the convert? Didn’t Rav Ika bar Avin say</b> that <b>Rav Ḥananel said</b> that <b>Rav said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> with respect to the days of Ezra: <b>“And they read in the book, the Torah of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, and they caused them to understand the reading”</b> (Nehemiah 8:8)? The verse should be understood as follows: <b>“And they read in the book, the Torah of God,” this is the</b> scriptural <b>text; “distinctly,” this is the translation,</b> indicating that they immediately translated the text into Aramaic, as was customary during public Torah readings.

### Part 8
<b>“And they gave the sense,” these are</b> the divisions of the text into separate <b>verses. “And they caused them to understand the reading,” these are the cantillation notes,</b> through which the meaning of the text is further clarified. <b>And some say</b> that <b>these are the</b> Masoretic <b>traditions</b> with regard to the manner in which each word is to be written. This indicates that the Aramaic translation already existed at the beginning of the Second Temple period, well before the time of Onkelos. The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> ancient Aramaic translation <b>was forgotten and then</b> Onkelos came and <b>reestablished it.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about the translation of Prophets? Why is it that when Onkelos revealed the translation <b>of the Torah,</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>did not quake, and</b> when he revealed the translation <b>of the Prophets, it quaked?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>The</b> meaning of <b>matters</b> discussed <b>in the Torah is clear,</b> and therefore its Aramaic translation did not reveal the meaning of passages that had not been understood previously. Conversely, in <b>the Prophets, there are matters that are clear and there are matters that are obscure,</b> and the Aramaic translation revealed the meaning of obscure passages. The Gemara cites an example of an obscure verse that is clarified by the Aramaic translation: <b>As it is written: “On that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon”</b> (Zechariah 12:11).

### Part 10
<b>And</b> with regard to that verse, <b>Rav Yosef said: Were it not for the</b> Aramaic <b>translation of this verse, we would not have known what it is saying,</b> as the Bible does not mention any incident involving Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. The Aramaic translation reads as follows: <b>On that day, the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Ahab, son of Omri, who was slain by Hadadrimmon, son of Tavrimon, in Ramoth-Gilead, and like the mourning for Josiah, son of Amon, who was slain by Pharaoh the lame in the valley of Megiddon.</b> The translation clarifies that the verse is referring to two separate incidents of mourning, and thereby clarifies the meaning of this verse.

### Part 11
§ The Gemara introduces another statement from the same line of tradition. The verse states: <b>“And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for the men who were with me did not see the vision; but a great trembling fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves”</b> (Daniel 10:7). <b>Who were these men?</b> The term “men” in the Bible indicates important people; who were they? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> who said: <b>These are</b> the prophets <b>Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara comments: In certain ways <b>they,</b> the prophets, <b>were greater than him,</b> Daniel, and in certain ways <b>he,</b> Daniel, <b>was greater than them. They were greater than him, as they were prophets and he was not a prophet.</b> Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi were sent to convey the word of God to the Jewish people, while Daniel was not sent to reveal his visions to others. In another way, however, <b>he was greater than them, as he saw</b> this vision, <b>and they did not see</b> this vision, indicating that his ability to perceive obscure and cryptic visions was greater than theirs.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>Since they did not see</b> the vision, <b>what is the reason that they were frightened?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Even though they did not see</b> the vision, <b>their guardian angels saw</b> it, and therefore they sensed that there was something fearful there and they fled.

### Part 14
<b>Ravina said: Learn from</b> this incident that with regard to <b>one who is frightened</b> for no apparent reason, <b>although he does not see</b> anything menacing, <b>his guardian angel sees</b> it, and therefore he should take steps in order to escape the danger. The Gemara asks: <b>What is his remedy? He should recite <i>Shema</i>,</b> which will afford him protection. <b>And if he is standing in a place of filth,</b> where it is prohibited to recite verses from the Torah, <b>he should distance himself four cubits from his</b> current <b>location</b> in order to escape the danger. <b>And if</b> he is <b>not</b> able to do so, <b>let him say the following</b> incantation: <b>The goat of the slaughterhouse is fatter than I am,</b> and if a calamity must fall upon something, it should fall upon it.

### Part 15
§ After this digression, the Gemara returns to the exposition of a verse cited above. <b>Now</b> that <b>you have said</b> that the phrases <b>“every province” and “every city”</b> appear <b>for</b> the purposes of midrashic <b>exposition, for what</b> exposition do the words <b>“every family”</b> appear in that same verse (Esther 9:28)? <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said:</b> These words come <b>to include the priestly and Levitical families,</b> and indicate <b>that they cancel their service</b> in the Temple <b>and come to hear the reading of the Megilla.</b>

### Part 16
<b>As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: The priests at their</b> Temple <b>service, the Levites on their platform</b> in the Temple, where they sung the daily psalm, <b>and the Israelites at their watches,</b> i.e., the group of Israelites, corresponding to the priestly watches, who would come to Jerusalem and gather in other locations as representatives of the entire nation to observe or pray for the success of the Temple service, <b>all cancel their service and come to hear the reading of the Megilla.</b>

### Part 17
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The priests at their service, the Levites on the platform, and the Israelites at their watches, all cancel their service and come to hear the reading of the Megilla.</b> The Sages of <b>the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>relied</b> upon the <i>halakha</i> stated <b>here</b> and determined <b>that one cancels his Torah study and comes to hear the reading of the Megilla.</b> They derived this principle by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from the</b> Temple <b>service: Just as</b> one who is engaged in performing <b>service</b> in the Temple, <b>which is</b> very <b>important, cancels</b> his service in order to hear the Megilla, is it <b>not all the more so</b> obvious that one who is engaged in <b>Torah study</b> cancels his study to hear the Megilla?

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>Is the</b> Temple <b>service more important than Torah study? Isn’t it written: “And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood over against him</b> with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went over to him and said to him: Are you for us, or for our adversaries? And he said, No, but I am captain of the host of the Lord, I have come now. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, <b>and bowed down”</b> (Joshua 5:13–14).

### Part 19
The Gemara first seeks to clarify the incident described in the verse. <b>How did</b> Joshua <b>do this,</b> i.e., how could he bow to a figure he did not recognize? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi say: It is prohibited for a person to greet his fellow at night</b> if he does not recognize him, as <b>we are concerned that perhaps it is a demon?</b> How did Joshua know that it was not a demon? The Gemara answers: <b>There it was different, as</b> the visitor <b>said to him: But I am captain of the host of the Lord.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>Perhaps</b> this was a demon <b>and he lied?</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that demons <b>do not utter the name of Heaven for naught,</b> and therefore since the visitor had mentioned the name of God, Joshua was certain that this was indeed an angel.

### Part 21
As for the angel’s mission, the Gemara explains that the angel <b>said to</b> Joshua: <b>Yesterday,</b> i.e., during the afternoon, <b>you neglected the afternoon daily offering</b> due to the impending battle, <b>and now,</b> at night, <b>you have neglected Torah study,</b> and I have come to rebuke you. Joshua <b>said to him: For which of these</b> sins <b>have you come? He said to him: I have come now,</b> indicating that neglecting Torah study is more severe than neglecting to sacrifice the daily offering. Joshua <b>immediately</b> determined to rectify the matter, as the verses states: <b>“And Joshua lodged that night”</b> (Joshua 8:9) <b>“in the midst of the valley</b> [<b><i>ha’emek</i></b>]” (Joshua 8:13), and <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b>
