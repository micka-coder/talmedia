### Part 1
<b>Just as judgment</b> may be done only <b>by day, so too here,</b> the <i>sota</i> is given the bitter waters to drink only <b>by day.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And</b> daytime is the time <b>for breaking the neck of the heifer,</b> as the Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai said: Atonement is written with regard to</b> the heifer, teaching that it is treated <b>like sacred</b> offerings, and it has already been established that all actions relating to offerings must be performed during the day. <b>And for purifying the leper,</b> it is derived <b>as it is written: “This shall be the law of the leper on the day of his cleansing”</b> (Leviticus 14:2).

### Part 3
It was taught in the mishna: <b>The entire night is a valid</b> time for <b>reaping the <i>omer</i>,” as the Master said</b> in tractate <i>Menaḥot</i>: The <b>reaping</b> of the <i>omer</i> <b>and the counting</b> of the <i>omer</i> must be performed <b>at night, whereas bringing</b> the <i>omer</i> offering to the Temple must be done <b>during the day. And for burning the fats and limbs</b> of the offerings, it is derived <b>as it is written</b> with regard to them: “Which shall be burning upon the altar <b>all night until the morning”</b> (Leviticus 6:2).

### Part 4
§ The mishna states: <b>This is the principle: Something that it is a mitzva</b> to perform <b>during the day is valid</b> if <b>performed</b> any time during <b>the entire day.</b> The Gemara asks: As the mishna has seemingly mentioned all daytime mitzvot explicitly, the words: <b>This is the principle, are to add what?</b> The Gemara answers: This principle comes <b>to include the arranging of the vessels</b> of frankincense alongside the shewbread in the Temple, <b>and the removal of</b> those <b>vessels</b> at the end of the week, as the verse does not specify the time when these procedures should be performed.

### Part 5
<b>And</b> this mishna would consequently be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said: If one removed the old</b> shewbread and frankincense <b>in the morning and arranged the new</b> ones <b>toward the evening,</b> i.e., at the end of the day, <b>there is nothing</b> wrong <b>with this,</b> as it suffices if the changeover is made any time over the course of the same day. The Sages, however, maintain that the new ones must be set in place immediately after the old ones have been removed.

### Part 6
<b>And,</b> according to Rabbi Yosei, <b>how do I uphold</b> that which is written with regard to the shewbread: “He shall set it in order <b>before the Lord continually”</b> (Leviticus 24:8), implying that the bread must be on the table at all times? It means only <b>that the table should not be</b> an entire day <b>without the bread,</b> but if there is bread on the table for even a part of the day, it is considered as being there “continually.”

### Part 7
§ The mishna concludes: <b>Something that it is a mitzva</b> to perform <b>at night may be performed the entire night.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does this principle come <b>to add</b> that has not already been mentioned explicitly?

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: It comes <b>to include the eating of the Paschal offering,</b> and consequently this mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“And they shall eat the meat on that night”</b> (Exodus 12:8). <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said: It is stated here: “On that night,” and it is stated further on: “And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night”</b> (Exodus 12:12). <b>Just as there,</b> when God passed through the land of Egypt, it was <b>until midnight, so too here,</b> the Paschal offering may be eaten only <b>until midnight.</b> The mishna, which asserts that the Paschal offering may be eaten all night, is not in accordance with Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya.
