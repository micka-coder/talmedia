### Part 1
<b>he</b> himself <b>should stumble</b> by showing favoritism to Benjamin? <b>As Rava bar Meḥaseyya said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said</b> that <b>Rav said: Due to</b> the weight of <b>two sela of fine wool that Jacob</b> gave to Joseph, which he <b>added to</b> what he gave <b>Joseph beyond</b> what he gave <b>the rest of his brothers,</b> as he made him his special coat, <b>the story progressed and our forefathers went down to Egypt.</b> How then could Joseph have displayed similar favoritism toward Benjamin? <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet said: He</b> was not showing favoritism. Rather, he <b>intimated to him that a descendant was destined to issue from him who would go out from the presence of the king</b> wearing <b>five royal garments, as it is stated: “And Mordecai went forth</b> from the presence of the king <b>in royal apparel of sky blue</b> and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a wrap of fine linen and purple” (Esther 8:15).

### Part 2
The Gemara elaborates on certain elements in the story of Joseph and his brothers. The verse states with regard to Joseph: <b>“And he fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck [<i>tzavarei</i></b>] and wept” (Genesis 45:14). The wording of the verse gives rise to a question, as the word <i>tzavarei</i> is plural, meaning necks: <b>How many necks did Benjamin have,</b> such that the verse should use the plural <i>tzavarei</i> rather than the singular <i>tzavar</i>? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This intimates <b>that</b> Joseph <b>cried over the two Temples that were destined to be in the</b> tribal <b>territory of Benjamin and were destined to be destroyed.</b> The same verse continues: <b>“And Benjamin wept on his neck”</b> (Genesis 45:14); <b>he cried over the tabernacle of Shiloh that was destined to be in the</b> tribal <b>territory of Joseph and was destined to be destroyed.</b>

### Part 3
The verse states: <b>“And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin”</b> (Genesis 45:12). <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> Joseph <b>said to</b> his brothers as follows: <b>Just as I</b> certainly <b>harbor no</b> resentment <b>in my heart toward my brother Benjamin, for he was not</b> even <b>present when I was sold, so too, I harbor no</b> resentment <b>toward you.</b> The verse continues: <b>“That it is my mouth [<i>ki fi</i>] that speaks to you”</b> (Genesis 45:12), i.e., <b>As my mouth [<i>kefi</i>] is, so is my heart.</b>

### Part 4
The verse states: <b>“And to his father he sent after this manner ten donkeys laden with the good things of Egypt”</b> (Genesis 45:23). The Gemara asks: <b>What are “the good things of Egypt”</b> that are mentioned but not specified here? <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: He sent him aged wine, which the elderly find pleasing.</b>

### Part 5
Following Jacob’s death, it states concerning Joseph: <b>“And his brothers even went and fell down before him”</b> (Genesis 50:18). <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: This</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say: When the fox is in its hour, bow down to it,</b> i.e., if a fox is appointed king, one must bow down before and submit oneself to it.

### Part 6
The Gemara expresses astonishment at the use of this parable: Are you calling Joseph <b>a fox? What, was he inferior to his brothers</b> such that in relation to them you call him a fox? <b>Rather, if such a statement was stated, it was stated as follows,</b> not in connection with this verse, but rather in connection with a different verse. The verse states: <b>“And Israel bowed himself upon the head of the bed”</b> (Genesis 47:31). With regard to this, <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: When the fox is in its hour, bow down to it,</b> as Jacob had to bow down before his son Joseph, who had reached greatness.

### Part 7
It says with regard to Joseph’s remarks to his brothers: <b>“And he comforted them and spoke to their hearts”</b> (Genesis 50:21). <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This <b>teaches that he spoke to them words that are acceptable to the heart,</b> and alleviated their fears. This is what he said: <b>If ten lights could not put out one light,</b> as all of you were unable to do me harm, <b>how can one light put out ten lights?</b>

### Part 8
§ The Gemara returns to its explanation of the Megilla. The verse states: <b>“The Jews had light and gladness, and joy and honor”</b> (Esther 8:16). <b>Rav Yehuda said: “Light”; this</b> is referring to the <b>Torah</b> that they once again studied. <b>And similarly it says: “For the mitzva is a lamp and the Torah is light”</b> (Proverbs 6:23). <b>“Gladness” [<i>simḥa</i>]; this</b> is referring to <b>the Festivals</b> that they once again observed. <b>And similarly it says: “And you shall be glad [<i>vesamakhta</i>] on your Festival”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:14). <b>“Joy” [<i>sasson</i>]; this</b> is referring to <b>circumcision,</b> as they once again circumcised their sons. <b>And similarly it says: “I rejoice [<i>sas</i>] at Your word”</b> (Psalms 119:162), which the Sages understood as referring to David’s rejoicing over the mitzva of circumcision.

### Part 9
<b>“Honor”; this is</b> referring to <b>phylacteries,</b> which they once again donned. <b>And similarly it says: “And all peoples of the earth will see that you are called by the name of the Lord; and they will be afraid of you”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:10). <b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great said: This</b> is referring to <b>the phylacteries worn on the head.</b> Haman had banned the fulfillment of all the mitzvot mentioned, but upon Haman’s demise the Jews returned to their observance.

### Part 10
The verse states: “And in Shushan the capital the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men. <b>And Parshandatha…</b>and Vaizatha, <b>the ten sons of Haman”</b> (Esther 9:6–10). <b>Rav Adda from Jaffa said:</b> When reading the Megilla, the names of <b>the ten sons of Haman and</b> the word <b>“ten” must be said in one breath. What is the reason</b> for this? It is that <b>their souls all departed together. Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The letter <b><i>vav</i> in</b> the name <b>“Vaizatha”</b> is a lengthened <i>vav</i> and <b>must be elongated as a pole, like a steering oar of a ship [<i>liberot</i>]. What is the reason</b> for this? To indicate that <b>they were all hanged on one pole.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said</b> that <b>Rabbi Sheila, a man of the village of Timarta, interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: All</b> of <b>the songs</b> in the Bible <b>are written</b> in the form of <b>a half brick arranged upon a whole brick and a whole brick arranged upon a half brick,</b> i.e., each line of the song is divided into a stitch of text, referred to as a half brick, which is separated by a blank space, referred to as a whole brick, from the concluding stitch of that line of text.

### Part 12
The next line of the song inverts the sequence. <b>This is the principle for all songs in the Bible except</b> for <b>this song,</b> referring to the list of Haman’s sons, <b>and</b> the song listing <b>the kings of Canaan</b> who were defeated by Joshua. These two songs are written in the form of <b>a half brick arranged upon a half brick and a whole brick arranged upon a whole brick,</b> i.e., one stitch of text over another, and one blank space over another. <b>What is the reason</b> that these two songs are written in this anomalous fashion? <b>So that they should never rise from their downfall.</b> Just as a wall that is built in this manner will not stand, so too, these individuals should have no resurgence.

### Part 13
The verse states: <b>“And the king said to Esther the queen: The Jews have slain</b> and destroyed five hundred men <b>in Shushan the capital,</b> and also the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? Now what is your petition and it shall be granted to you; and what more do you request, and it shall be done” (Esther 9:12). <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: This teaches that an angel came and slapped him on his mouth,</b> so that he was unable to finish what he was saying; he started with a complaint about what the Jews were doing, but ended on an entirely different note.

### Part 14
The verse states: <b>“But when she came before the king, he said with a letter”</b> (Esther 9:25). Why does it say: <b>“He said”? It should have said: “She said,”</b> as it was Esther who changed the decree. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: She said to</b> Ahasuerus: <b>Let it be said by</b> word of <b>mouth,</b> indicating that <b>that which is written in the letter</b> should also be ordered verbally.

### Part 15
With regard to what is stated: <b>“Words of peace and truth”</b> (Esther 9:30), <b>Rabbi Tanḥum said, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi</b> said: This <b>teaches that</b> a Megilla scroll <b>requires scoring,</b> i.e., that the lines for the text must be scored onto the parchment, <b>as the Torah itself,</b> i.e., as is done in a Torah scroll.

### Part 16
The verses say: “The matters of the fasts and their cry. <b>And the decree of Esther confirmed</b> these matters of Purim” (Esther 9:31–32). The Gemara asks: Should we say that <b>“the decree of Esther” indeed</b> confirmed these matters of Purim, but <b>“the matters of the fasts”</b> did <b>not?</b> But didn’t the fasts also contribute to the miracle? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> These two verses, <b>“The matters of the fasts</b> and their cry. <b>And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim,”</b> should be read as one.

### Part 17
The verse states: <b>“For Mordecai the Jew was second to the king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted by the majority of his brethren”</b> (Esther 10:3). The Gemara comments: The verse indicates that Mordecai was accepted only <b>“By the majority of his brethren,” but not by all his brethren.</b> This <b>teaches that some</b> members <b>of the Sanhedrin parted from him,</b> because he occupied himself with community needs, and was therefore compelled to neglect his Torah study. They felt that this was a mistake and that he should have remained active on the Sanhedrin.

### Part 18
<b>Rav Yosef said: Studying Torah is greater than saving lives, as initially,</b> when listing the Jewish leaders who came to Eretz Yisrael, <b>Mordecai was mentioned after four</b> other people, <b>but at the end</b> he was listed <b>after five.</b> This is taken to indicate that his involvement in governmental affairs instead of in Torah study lowered his stature one notch. The Gemara proves this: <b>At first it is written: “Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan”</b> (Ezra 2:2); <b>but in the end</b> in a later list <b>it is written: “Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahmani, Mordecai, Bilshan”</b> (Nehemiah 7:7).

### Part 19
<b>Rav said, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Shmuel bar Marta</b> said: <b>Studying Torah is greater</b> and more important <b>that building the Temple.</b> A proof of this is that <b>for as long as Baruch ben Neriah was alive</b> in Babylonia, <b>Ezra,</b> who was his disciple, <b>did not leave him and go up</b> to Eretz Yisrael to build the Temple.

### Part 20
<b>Rabba said</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta said: Studying Torah is</b> greater and <b>more</b> important <b>than honoring one’s father and mother,</b> and a proof of this is <b>that for all those years that our father Jacob spent in the house of Eber</b> and studied Torah there <b>he was not punished</b> for having neglected to fulfill the mitzva of honoring one’s parents. <b>As the Master said:</b>
