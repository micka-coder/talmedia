### Part 1
<b>one may not begin</b> a new <b>paragraph</b> and read <b>fewer than three verses</b> from it. And if you say <b>he should read two</b> verses <b>from this</b> paragraph, i.e., the entire second paragraph, <b>and</b> then <b>three</b> verses <b>from that</b> final paragraph, <b>only two</b> verses will <b>remain</b> from the final paragraph. This is problematic because one may not conclude a reading with fewer than three verses left until the end of a paragraph and because the fourth reader will not have a sufficient number of verses to read.

### Part 2
Rava <b>said to him: I have not heard</b> a solution for <b>this</b> problem from my teachers. However, <b>with regard to a similar</b> problem <b>I heard</b> a solution from them, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ta’anit</i> 26a): <b>On Sunday,</b> the non-priestly watches would read two paragraphs from the Torah: <b>“In the beginning”</b> (Genesis 1:1–5) <b>and “Let there be a firmament”</b> (Genesis 1:6–8). <b>And it is taught in that regard</b> that the paragraph <b>“In the beginning”</b> was read <b>by two</b> readers and the paragraph <b>“Let there be a firmament” by one</b> reader.

### Part 3
<b>And we discussed</b> this ruling and raised difficulties with <b>it: Granted,</b> the paragraph <b>“Let there be a firmament”</b> was read <b>by one</b> reader, <b>as it</b> consists of <b>three verses. But</b> how was the paragraph <b>“In the beginning”</b> read <b>by two?</b> It consists of only <b>five verses, and it was taught</b> in a mishna (23b): <b>One who reads from the Torah should not</b> read <b>fewer than three verses.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And it was stated with regard to</b> that mishna that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about how to divide the verses. <b>Rav said:</b> The second reader <b>repeats</b> the last verse that the first reader had recited, so that each of them reads three verses. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> The first reader <b>divides</b> the third verse and reads half of it, and the second reader begins with the second half of that verse, as though each half were its own verse.

### Part 5
The Gemara explains the opinions of Rav and Shmuel. <b>Rav said</b> that the second reader <b>repeats</b> the last verse that the first reader recited. <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>he did not state</b> that the first reader <b>divides</b> the third verse, in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel? The Gemara answers: <b>He holds</b> that <b>any verse that Moses did not divide, we may not divide.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>Does Shmuel say</b> that <b>we may divide</b> a verse into two parts? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Ḥananya Kara,</b> the Bible expert, <b>say: I had great distress with Rabbi Ḥanina the Great;</b> there were many times I had to ask his permission to divide a verse, <b>and he permitted me to divide</b> it <b>only for the</b> benefit of <b>schoolchildren, since they</b> need <b>to be taught</b> in this manner, as it is difficult for children to learn long verses all at once? In other cases, however it is prohibited to divide a verse.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of schoolchildren, <b>what is the reason</b> that it is permitted to divide a verse? <b>Because it is not possible</b> to teach the children without doing so. <b>Here, too,</b> when a paragraph of five verses must be divided between two readers, <b>it is not possible</b> to divide them without dividing the middle verse.

### Part 8
The Gemara now examines the opinion of Shmuel. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> The first reader <b>divides</b> the third verse and reads half of it. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>he did not state</b> that the second reader <b>repeats</b> the last verse recited by the first reader, in accordance with the opinion of Rav? The Gemara answers: It is because of a rabbinic <b>decree</b> that was instituted <b>due to those who enter and those who leave</b> the synagogue between the readings. These individuals might erroneously conclude that since the reading they heard consisted of three verses, the reading they missed consisted of only two verses. Therefore, the middle verse is divided into two parts, so that all will realize that no reader recites only two verses.

### Part 9
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinions of Rav and Shmuel from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Two</b> people may <b>read a paragraph of six verses, but</b> a paragraph <b>of five</b> verses may be read only by <b>a single</b> reader. If <b>the first</b> one <b>read three</b> verses, <b>the second</b> one <b>reads</b> the remaining <b>two</b> verses <b>from this paragraph</b> and then <b>one</b> verse <b>from another,</b> i.e., the following, <b>paragraph. And some say</b> that it does not suffice to read one verse from the next paragraph; rather, he must read <b>three</b> verses, as <b>one may not begin</b> a new <b>paragraph</b> and read <b>fewer than three verses</b> from it.

### Part 10
<b>And if it is so,</b> if it is permissible to do as Rav and Shmuel suggested, <b>according to the one who said</b> that the second reader <b>repeats</b> a verse that the previous reader recited, i.e., Rav, <b>let him repeat</b> the verse in this case as well. <b>And according to the one who said</b> that the second reader <b>divides</b> the verse, i.e., Shmuel, <b>let him divide</b> the verse in this case as well.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>it is different, as it is possible to</b> solve the problem <b>in this</b> manner by reading additional verses. On the New Moon, however, the next paragraph deals with an entirely different subject, and consequently it cannot be included in the Torah reading. Therefore, Rav and Shmuel presented alternate solutions.

### Part 12
With regard to the dispute cited in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Tanḥum said that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion introduced by the phrase: <b>Some say,</b> which maintains that at least three verses must be read from the next paragraph. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>Rabbi Tanḥum said that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Just as one may not begin</b> a new <b>paragraph</b> and read <b>fewer than three verses</b> from it, <b>so too, one may not leave fewer than three verses</b> before the end of <b>a paragraph</b> at the conclusion of a reading.

### Part 13
The Gemara challenges this statement: This <b>is obvious. Now,</b> if with regard to <b>the beginning</b> of a paragraph, where <b>the first <i>tanna</i> is lenient</b> and holds that it is sufficient to read one verse from the next paragraph, the opinion introduced with the phrase: <b>Some say, is stringent,</b> then with regard to <b>leaving</b> verses at the end of a paragraph, where even <b>the first <i>tanna</i> is stringent</b> and holds that one may not conclude a reading with fewer than three verses remaining until the end of a paragraph, is it <b>not all the more so</b> obvious that the opinion introduced with: <b>Some say, is stringent?</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say: Entering</b> in the middle of the Torah reading <b>is common,</b> and therefore one should not conclude a reading after having read fewer than three verses of a paragraph, but <b>leaving</b> in the middle of the Torah reading, whereby one <b>abandons a Torah scroll and leaves, is not common,</b> and therefore one may conclude a reading with fewer than three verses left in the paragraph, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>teaches us</b> that the second opinion cited in the mishna is also concerned that people may leave in the middle of the Torah reading, and consequently one may not conclude a reading with fewer than three verses left in the paragraph.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the first <i>tanna</i>, what is different</b> about <b>leaving</b> fewer than three verses at the end of a paragraph, <b>which</b> is <b>not</b> permitted <b>due to</b> concern about <b>those who leave</b> the synagogue in the middle of the Torah reading? In the case of <b>beginning</b> a paragraph without reading at least three verses, he should <b>also</b> hold that there is a rabbinic <b>decree due to those who enter,</b> lest the latecomer think that the previous reader read fewer than three verses. The Gemara responds: <b>Say</b> in answer to this question that <b>one who enters</b> in the middle of the Torah reading <b>asks</b> how the Torah was read until then, and those present will explain to him that the reader started in the previous paragraph. Therefore, he will not erroneously think that the reader recited fewer than three verses.

### Part 16
<b>Rabba, son of Rava, sent</b> a messenger <b>to</b> ask <b>Rav Yosef: What is the <i>halakha</i></b> with regard to dividing a small Torah portion? Rav Yosef <b>sent him</b> the following answer: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is</b> that <b>one repeats</b> a verse, in accordance with the opinion of Rav, <b>and</b> it is <b>the middle</b> reader who <b>repeats</b> it, and not the last reader, so that it will not be necessary to leave fewer than three verses until the end of the paragraph.

### Part 17
§ We learned in the mishna: <b>This is the principle: Any</b> day <b>on which there is an additional offering</b> sacrificed in the Temple and that is not a Festival, four people read from the Torah. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: On <b>a public fast, how many</b> people read from the Torah? Does the mishna mean to say that only on <b>the New Moon and</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, when there is an additional offering, four</b> people read; <b>but here,</b> on a public fast day, <b>when there is no additional offering, no,</b> only three people read? <b>Or perhaps here, too, there is an additional prayer,</b> as on public fast days the prayer: <i>Aneinu</i>, is inserted into the <i>Amida</i> prayer, and so too an additional reader is called to read from the Torah.

### Part 18
The Gemara attempts to adduce a proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that which</b> we learned in the mishna: <b>On</b> the days of the <b>New Moon and on the intermediate days of a Festival, four</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah. <b>Doesn’t</b> this indicate that <b>on a public fast,</b> only <b>three</b> people read? The Gemara responds: <b>Say the first clause</b> of the mishna: <b>On Mondays and Thursdays</b> during the morning service <b>and on Shabbat during the afternoon service, three</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah. <b>Doesn’t</b> this indicate that on <b>a public fast, four</b> people read from the Torah? <b>Rather,</b> it must be concluded that <b>nothing can be derived from this</b> mishna with regard to a public fast day, as the mishna does not mean to indicate the <i>halakha</i> in every possible case.

### Part 19
A different proof is now suggested. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following incident: <b>Rav</b> once <b>happened</b> to come <b>to Babylonia on a public fast. He stood and read from</b> a Torah <b>scroll.</b> When <b>he began</b> to read, <b>he recited a blessing,</b> but when <b>he concluded, he did not recite a blessing. Everyone</b> else <b>fell on their faces,</b> i.e., bowed down on the floor, during the <i>Taḥanun</i> supplication, as was the custom, <b>but Rav did not fall on his face.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara attempts to clarify the <i>halakha</i> based upon Rav’s conduct. <b>Now, Rav</b> must have <b>read</b> the portion that is designated for <b>an Israelite,</b> as he was neither a priest nor a Levite, and therefore he was the third person to read from the Torah. <b>What,</b> then, <b>is the reason</b> that when <b>he concluded</b> his reading <b>he did not recite a blessing? Was it not because another</b> person <b>was to read after him,</b> and since only the last reader recites a blessing, Rav did not recite a blessing upon completion of his portion? This would indicate that four readers are called to the Torah on public fasts.

### Part 21
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No, Rav read</b> the first reading, which is generally designated for <b>priests.</b> He was the leading Torah authority of his generation, and one who holds this position is called to read from the Torah even before a priest, <b>as Rav Huna would read</b> the first reading, which is generally designated for <b>priests,</b> and Rav would do the same.

### Part 22
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Granted, Rav Huna read</b> the portion designated for <b>priests, as even Rav Ami and Rav Asi,</b> who were <b>the most esteemed priests in Eretz Yisrael, were subordinate to Rav Huna,</b> and he was considered the undisputed rabbinic leader of the Jewish people. <b>However,</b> in the case of <b>Rav, there was Shmuel, who was a priest, and</b> Rav had <b>elevated</b> him <b>above himself,</b> showing Shmuel deference in all matters of honor. Consequently, Rav was not the singular leader of his generation and would not have read the first reading in place of a priest.

### Part 23
The Gemara answers: In fact, <b>Shmuel was also subordinate to Rav,</b> as Rav was indeed the leading authority in Babylonia, <b>and it was Rav who showed</b> Shmuel <b>honor</b> of his own volition, in order to appease him for having cursed him. <b>And he did this</b> only when Shmuel was <b>in his presence,</b> but <b>when he was not in his presence,</b> Rav <b>did not do this,</b> and therefore Rav would read first from the Torah when Shmuel was not present.

### Part 24
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to assume that <b>Rav read</b> first <b>from</b> the portion that is generally designated for <b>priests, because if it enters your mind to say</b> that <b>he read</b> third, <b>from</b> the portion designated for <b>an</b> ordinary <b>Israelite, what is the reason he recited a blessing before</b> reading his portion? Only the first reader recites a blessing before reading from the Torah. The Gemara rejects this argument: This incident took place <b>after it was instituted</b> that all those called to read from the Torah recite a blessing.

### Part 25
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, he should also have recited a blessing after</b> his reading, as the rabbinic enactment requires those who read from the Torah to recite blessings both before and after their reading. The Gemara answers: The reason that the Sages required all the readers to recite blessings both before and after their readings was to prevent misunderstandings on the part of both those who enter the synagogue in the middle of the reading and those who leave early. But <b>it was different where Rav was present, as</b> people <b>would enter</b> the synagogue in the middle of the reading,
