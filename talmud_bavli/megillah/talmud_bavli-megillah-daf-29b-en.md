### Part 1
<b>And</b> a public announcement is made <b>concerning</b> the need to uproot any instances of <b>diverse kinds</b> that have grown in the fields.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> an announcement is made <b>concerning</b> the need to uproot <b>diverse kinds, as</b> the beginning of the month of Adar <b>is a time of sowing.</b> Instances of diverse kinds are already noticeable, and therefore it is a fitting time to deal with the matter. <b>But</b> with regard to the announcement <b>concerning the</b> half-<b>shekels, from where do we</b> derive that it should be made at this point in the year?

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Tavi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoshiyya said:</b> It is <b>as the verse states: “This is the burnt-offering of each New Moon in its renewal</b> throughout the months of the year” (Numbers 28:14). <b>The Torah says:</b> There is a month in which you must begin to <b>renew and bring the</b> daily and additional <b>offering from</b> animals purchased with <b>the new collections</b> of half-shekels collected that year. Each year a collection is made with which to finance the purchase of communal offerings for the following year. Offerings during that year may be purchased only from collections made for that year.

### Part 4
Elsewhere it is derived through a verbal analogy that the yearly cycle begins with the month of Nisan. <b>And since</b> starting from and <b>during</b> the month of <b>Nisan</b> the offerings <b>must be brought from the new collections</b> of half-shekels, it is necessary to make the collection in the preceding month, i.e., in Adar. Therefore, <b>they advance</b> the reading of <i>Shekalim</i>, <b>and they read</b> it <b>on the first of Adar, in order that</b> the people <b>will</b> be reminded to <b>bring the</b> half-<b>shekels to the Temple</b> in good time.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is the mishna taught? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, for if</b> someone would suggest that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> one could counter: <b>Didn’t he say</b> that <b>two weeks</b> is a sufficient period of preparation? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>We</b> begin to <b>inquire into the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover thirty days before Passover. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> We begin to inquire only <b>two weeks</b> before Passover. As such, it should be sufficient to announce the collection of half-shekels from two weeks before Nisan, and there should be no need to advance the announcement to the beginning of Adar, as stated in the mishna.

### Part 6
<b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> it is possible that even he agrees that the announcement concerning the collection of the half-shekels should be made on the first of Adar, <b>since the Master said: On the fifteenth</b> of Adar money-changing <b>tables</b> for collecting the half-shekels <b>are set up throughout the country, and on the twenty-fifth</b> of Adar <b>they are set up in the Temple. Because of</b> the possibility to donate the half-shekels at <b>the tables</b> already from the fifteenth, <b>they advance</b> the reading of <i>Shekalim</i> to inform people of that possibility <b>and read it</b> two weeks earlier, on the first of Adar.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara clarifies which passage is read: <b>What is</b> this <b>portion of <i>Shekalim</i>? Rav said:</b> It is the portion of <b>“Command the children of Israel, and say to them: My offering, the provision</b> of My offerings made by fire” (Numbers 28), which details the daily and additional offerings. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> It is the portion of <b>“When you take the count”</b> (Exodus 30:11–16).

### Part 8
<b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that it is the portion of <b>“When you take the count,” this is</b> the reason <b>that it is called the portion of <i>Shekalim</i>, for</b> the obligation to give half-<b>shekels is written in</b> that portion. <b>However, according to one who said</b> that it is the portion of <b>“My offering, the provision</b> of My offerings,” why should that portion be read? <b>Is there anything written</b> about the half-<b>shekels here?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes. What is the reason</b> that they are collected in Adar? <b>As per</b> the explanation <b>of Rabbi Tavi,</b> the half-shekels are collected to be used for the coming year’s daily and additional offerings. Therefore, reading the portion concerning those offerings will serve well as a reminder for people to donate.

### Part 9
<b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that it is the portion of <b>“Command the children of Israel:</b> My offering, the provision of My offerings,” it is logical to read that portion, <b>because the offerings</b> that will be purchased with the half-shekels <b>are written there, as per</b> the explanation <b>of Rabbi Tavi. However, according to one who said</b> that it is the portion of <b>“When you take the count,”</b> why should that portion be read? <b>Is</b> anything about <b>the offerings written</b> in that portion? The collection of half-<b>shekels for</b> use in the construction of <b>the sockets</b> of the Tabernacle <b>are</b> the only thing <b>written</b> in that portion. What does that have to do with the collection of half-shekels for the purchase of offerings that is held in the month of Adar?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: The selection of that portion is <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of the portion <b>that Rav Yosef taught:</b> The three instances of the word: Contribution, in that portion teach that <b>there were three contributions</b> of half-shekels: The contribution <b>of the altar</b> is <b>for</b> the purchase of communal offerings to be sacrificed on <b>the altar; and</b> the contribution <b>of the sockets</b> is <b>for</b> constructing <b>the sockets; and</b> the contribution <b>of the Temple maintenance</b> is <b>for the Temple maintenance.</b> Therefore, according to Rav Yosef, it is understandable why the portion of “When you take the count” is read. It deals explicitly with the collection of half-shekels.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks further: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that it is the portion of <b>“When you take the count,” this is what is different</b> about <b>this New Moon</b> of Adar <b>and other New Moons</b> when they occur on Shabbat. On the New Moon of Adar, “When you take the count” is read because it describes the collection of half-shekels. On other New Moons, when they occur on Shabbat, the portion of “Command the children of Israel” is read because it mentions the additional offerings brought on Shabbat and the New Moon.

### Part 12
<b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>“Command</b> the children of Israel, and say to them: <b>My offering,” what is different</b> about the portion read on the New Moon of Adar and the portion read on other New Moons when they occur on Shabbat, for the same portion is read in all cases? The Gemara answers: They are <b>different: For</b> on other <b>New Moons,</b> when they occur on Shabbat, <b>six</b> people <b>read from</b> the regular weekly portion <b>of the matter of the day and one</b> reads <b>from</b> the portion for <b>the New Moon, whereas now,</b> on the New Moon of Adar, if it occurs on Shabbat, <b>all</b> seven read from the portion of <b>the New Moon.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: This answer <b>works out well according to the one who said that</b> when the mishna states that on the fifth Shabbat, we resume the regular order of readings. The intention is that <b>one resumes the</b> regular weekly <b>order</b> of Torah <b>portions.</b> This implies that on the previous four <i>Shabbatot</i>, the regular portion was not read at all. Rather, only the special portions delineated in the mishna were read. Therefore, it makes sense to say that all seven people read from the special portion.

### Part 14
<b>However, according to the one who says</b> that the mishna’s intention is that <b>one resumes the</b> regular <b>order of concluding</b> readings from the Prophets [<b><i>haftarot</i></b>], <b>and</b> on the previous <i>Shabbatot</i> <b>one also reads from</b> the regular portion <b>of the matter of the day, then</b> the original question stands: <b>What is different</b> about the portion read on the New Moon of Adar and the portion read on other New Moons when they occur on Shabbat?

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: They are <b>different: For whereas</b> on other <b>New Moons,</b> when they occur on Shabbat, <b>six</b> people <b>read from</b> the regular weekly portion <b>of the matter of the day and one</b> reads <b>from</b> the portion for <b>the New Moon, now,</b> on the New Moon of Adar, if it occurs on Shabbat, <b>three</b> people read from the regular weekly portion <b>of the matter of the day and four read from</b> the portion for <b>the New Moon.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Megilla</i> 3:1): When <b>the New Moon of Adar occurs on Shabbat, they read the</b> Torah <b>portion of <i>Shekalim</i>, and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the story involving <b>Jehoiada the priest</b> (II Kings 12:1–17). <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that <i>Shekalim</i> is the portion of <b>“When you take the count,” this is</b> the reason <b>that they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the story involving <b>Jehoiada the priest: Because it is comparable</b> in content <b>to</b> the Torah reading, <b>as it is written</b> in the story of Jehoiada: <b>“The money of his assessment of persons”</b> (II Kings 12:5), which is referring to his collection of the half-shekels, and the <i>haftara</i> should always contain a theme similar to the Torah reading.

### Part 17
<b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>“My offering, the provision</b> of My offerings” is read as the portion of <i>Shekalim</i>, <b>is</b> the <i>haftara</i> <b>comparable</b> to that portion? <b>It is comparable, as per</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Tavi:</b> It is appropriate to read the portion about offerings because the collection of half-shekels is for that purpose.

### Part 18
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If the New Moon of Adar <b>occurs on</b> the Shabbat on which <b>the portion</b> to be read for the regular weekly reading <b>is adjacent to</b> the portion read as <i>Shekalim</i>, <b>whether</b> on the Shabbat <b>preceding</b> the Shabbat on which <i>Shekalim</i> will be read as part of the weekly reading <b>or following it,</b> then <b>they read and repeat</b> <i>Shekalim</i> on both <i>Shabbatot</i>, one time as the special portion <i>Shekalim</i> and the other as part of the regular order.

### Part 19
<b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that the portion of <b>“When you take the count”</b> is read as <i>Shekalim</i>, <b>this is</b> how it is possible: <b>That</b> portion <b>could occur at that time</b> in the yearlong cycle of the order of readings. In the regular order of reading, “When you take the count” is often read during the beginning of Adar.

### Part 20
<b>However, according to the one who said</b> that the portion of <b>“Command</b> the children of Israel, and say to them, <b>My offering”</b> is read as <i>Shekalim</i>, <b>does</b> that portion <b>ever occur at that time</b> of the year? That portion usually occurs much later in the year, in the summer. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> it sometimes occurs that this portion is read during the beginning of Adar, <b>for the people of the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <b>who complete</b> the cycle of reading <b>the Torah</b> not in one year but <b>in three years.</b>

### Part 21
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel: When the New Moon of Adar occurs on Shabbat, they read</b> the portion of <b>“When you take the count,” and they read as the <i>haftara</i></b> the story involving <b>Jehoiada the priest.</b>

### Part 22
§ <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said:</b> When <b>the New Moon of Adar occurs on Shabbat,</b> the congregation <b>takes out three Torah scrolls</b> from the ark <b>and reads from them.</b> From the first <b>one,</b> they read the portion of the regular weekly reading <b>of the matter of the day; and</b> from the second <b>one</b> they read the portion <b>for the New Moon; and</b> from the third <b>one</b> they read <i>Shekalim</i>, which begins with <b>“When you take the count.” And Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa</b> further <b>said:</b> When <b>the New Moon of Tevet,</b> which always falls during Hanukkah, <b>occurs on Shabbat, they bring three Torah scrolls and read from them.</b> From the first <b>one,</b> they read <b>the</b> portion of the regular cycle of reading <b>of the matter of the day; and</b> from the second <b>one,</b> they read the portion <b>for the New Moon; and</b> from the third <b>one,</b> they read the portion <b>for Hanukkah.</b>

### Part 23
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa to state the <i>halakha</i> in both cases, <b>as, if it had been stated</b> only <b>with regard to</b> the New Moon of Tevet, one could have mistakenly thought that only <b>with regard to that</b> case <b>does Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> Nappaḥa <b>state</b> that three Torah scrolls are used. <b>But with regard to</b> the New Moon of Adar, one might think that <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who said</b> that <b>the portion of <i>Shekalim</i> is</b> the portion of <b>“My offering, the provision</b> of My offerings,” <b>and two Torah</b> scrolls will therefore <b>suffice,</b> since the same portion is used both for the portion for the New Moon and for the portion of <i>Shekalim</i>. Therefore, he <b>teaches us</b> that three Torah scrolls are used even on the New Moon of Adar.

### Part 24
The Gemara asks: <b>But,</b> based on that logic, <b>let</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak just <b>say</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with respect to this</b> case of the New Moon of Adar, <b>and there would be no need</b> to state <b>that</b> case of the New Moon of Tevet. The Gemara answers: Indeed, <b>one was stated from the other by inference,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa stated the <i>halakha</i> explicitly only with regard to the New Moon of Adar, and it was inferred that the same is true of the New Moon of Tevet.

### Part 25
§ An amoraic dispute <b>was stated:</b> When <b>the New Moon of Tevet occurs on a weekday,</b> what Torah portion is read? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> Nappaḥa <b>said: Three</b> people <b>read</b> from the portion <b>for the New Moon, and one</b> reads from the portion <b>for Hanukkah. And Rav Dimi of Haifa said: Three read</b> from the portion <b>for Hanukkah, and one</b> reads from the portion <b>for the New Moon.</b>

### Part 26
<b>Rabbi Mani said: It stands to reason</b> to rule <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa, for</b> it is already an established principle that when <b>a frequent</b> practice <b>and an infrequent</b> practice conflict, the <b>frequent</b> practice <b>takes precedence</b> over the infrequent practice. Since the portion for the New Moon is read more frequently than the portion for Hanukkah, it should be given greater prominence.

### Part 27
<b>Rabbi Avin said: It stands to reason</b> to rule <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Dimi,</b> for the following reason: <b>What caused the fourth</b> person <b>to come</b> and read from the Torah? <b>The New Moon,</b> as on the other days of Hanukkah only three people read from the Torah. <b>Therefore,</b> it is only logical that <b>the fourth person should read</b> from the portion <b>for the New Moon.</b>

### Part 28
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Rav Yosef said: We do not concern ourselves</b> with making the portion for <b>the New Moon</b> the primary reading. Rather, three people read from the portion for Hanukkah, and only the fourth reads the portion for the New Moon. <b>And Rabba said: We do not concern ourselves with</b> making the portion for <b>Hanukkah</b> the primary reading. Rather, three people read from the portion for the New Moon, and only the fourth reads the portion for Hanukkah. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>we do not concern ourselves with</b> making the portion for <b>Hanukkah</b> the primary reading, <b>and</b> therefore the portion for <b>the New Moon is primary.</b>

### Part 29
§ An amoraic dispute <b>was stated:</b> If the Shabbat on which the portion of <i>Shekalim</i> is to be read <b>occurs on</b> the Shabbat in which the regular weekly portion is <b>“And you shall command”</b> (Exodus 27:20–30:10), what should be done? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said: Six</b> people <b>read from</b> the portion <b>“And you shall command,” until</b> but not including the weekly portion of <b>“When you take the count”</b> (Exodus 27:20–30:10), <b>and one</b> person reads the portion of <i>Shekalim</i> <b>from “When you take the count,” until</b> but not including the verse: <b>“And you shall make</b> a copper laver” (Exodus 30:11–16). <b>Abaye said:</b>
