### Part 1
but <b>they would not leave</b> early, out of deference to Rav, and therefore it was not necessary for him to recite a blessing after he finished his portion. In any event, the incident with Rav does not provide conclusive proof as to the number of readers on a public fast day.

### Part 2
The Gemara tries to adduce another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>This is the</b> general <b>principle: Any</b> day <b>on which</b> labor is permitted and prolonging the prayer service would constitute <b>a deprivation of labor for the masses, for example, a public fast day and the Ninth of Av,</b> only <b>three</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah, so as not to lengthen the prayer service unnecessarily.

### Part 3
<b>But</b> any day <b>on which</b> prolonging the prayer service would <b>not</b> constitute <b>a deprivation of labor for the masses, for example,</b> the days of <b>the New Moon,</b> when it is customary for women to refrain from work, <b>and on the intermediate days of a Festival,</b> when one may not perform labor unless refraining from labor will cause him to lose money, <b>four</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from here</b> that on a public fast day three people read from the Torah.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ashi said: Didn’t we learn in the mishna as follows: This is the principle: Any day on which there is an additional offering</b> sacrificed in the Temple <b>and</b> it <b>is not a Festival, four</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah? <b>What is added</b> by the formulation of this principle? <b>Does it not</b> come <b>to add a public fast and the Ninth of Av,</b> when there is an addition to the prayer service, and therefore four people read from the Torah?

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rav Ashi, who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of <b>the mishna? It is not the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the following <i>baraita</i> <b>and not Rabbi Yosei. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the Ninth of Av <b>occurs on a Monday or a Thursday,</b> days on which there is always a Torah reading, <b>three</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah. <b>And</b> the last <b>one</b> of them <b>concludes</b> with a reading from the Prophets [<i>haftara</i>]. If it falls <b>on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, one</b> person <b>reads</b> from the Torah, <b>and</b> the same <b>one concludes</b> with a reading from the Prophets. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: Three</b> people <b>always read</b> from the Torah on the Ninth of Av, <b>and</b> the last <b>one concludes</b> with a reading from the Prophets. All agree that no more than three people read from the Torah on the Ninth of Av and other public fast days.

### Part 6
The Gemara responds: <b>However,</b> if only three people read from the Torah on these days, the statement: <b>This is the principle,</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as the mishna has already specifically mentioned every case included in the principle. The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is not difficult; it comes <b>to add the New Moon and</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>Aren’t these</b> days <b>taught explicitly</b> in the mishna: <b>On the New Moon and on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, four</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah?

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: The principle was not intended to add to what is stated explicitly in the mishna. The mishna <b>merely gives a mnemonic</b> by which to remember the number of readers on each day. It expresses the following: <b>Do not say that a Festival and the intermediate days of the Festival are the same</b> with regard to their sanctity, and therefore the same numbers of readers are called to the Torah on these days. <b>Rather, hold this rule</b> firmly <b>in your hand:</b> On <b>any</b> day <b>when there is an additional element</b> of the laws of the day, <b>an extra person is added</b> to the number of those who read from the Torah.

### Part 9
<b>Therefore, on the New Moon and</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival,</b> when <b>there is an additional offering, four</b> people <b>read</b> from the Torah. <b>On a Festival, when</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>perform labor, five</b> people read from the Torah. <b>On Yom Kippur, when</b> performance of prohibited labor <b>is punishable by <i>karet</i>, six</b> people read from the Torah. On <b>Shabbat, when there is a prohibition</b> to perform labor that is punishable by <b>stoning, seven</b> people read.

### Part 10
The Gemara cited an incident involving Rav, and now it returns to examine <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav</b> once <b>happened</b> to come <b>to Babylonia on a public fast. He stood and read from a</b> Torah <b>scroll.</b> When <b>he began</b> to read, <b>he recited a blessing,</b> but when <b>he concluded, he did not recite a blessing. Everyone</b> else <b>fell on their faces,</b> i.e., bowed down on the floor, during the <i>taḥanun</i> supplication, as was the custom, <b>but Rav did not fall on his face.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason that Rav did not fall on his face?</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>It was a stone floor, and it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Nor shall you install any figured stone in your land, to bow down upon it”</b> (Leviticus 26:1), that, <b>upon it,</b> i.e., any type of figured stone, <b>you shall not bow down in your land,</b> i.e., anywhere in your land other than in the Temple; <b>but you shall bow down upon the stones of the Temple.</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ulla,</b> as <b>Ulla said: The Torah prohibited</b> bowing down <b>only</b> upon <b>a stone floor.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why</b> was it <b>specifically Rav</b> who did not bow down? <b>All of</b> the other people present were <b>also</b> prohibited from bowing down on the stone floor. The Gemara answers: The stone section of the floor was only <b>in front of Rav,</b> as the rest of the floor was not paved.

### Part 13
The Gemara comments: If so, Rav <b>should have gone to</b> where the rest of <b>the congregation</b> was standing <b>and fallen on his face</b> there. The Gemara responds: <b>He did not want to trouble the congregation</b> to make room for him. <b>And if you wish, say</b> the following: <b>Rav would stretch out his arms and legs</b> and fully prostrate himself on the ground, whereas the others would merely bend their bodies as a symbolic gesture but would not prostrate themselves on the ground. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ulla, as Ulla said: The Torah prohibited</b> bowing down upon a stone floor <b>only</b> when it is done with <b>outstretched arms and legs.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara challenges this response: Rav <b>should have fallen on his face without stretching out his arms and legs.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He did not</b> want to <b>change his</b> usual <b>custom</b> of full prostration, and where he was standing he could not fully prostrate himself in his usual manner because there the floor was of stone.

### Part 15
<b>And if you wish, say</b> a different reason as to why Rav did not fall on his face: <b>An important person is different, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar said: An important person is not permitted to fall on his face</b> in public <b>unless</b> he knows that <b>he will be answered like Joshua bin Nun</b> in his time, <b>as it is written: “And the Lord said to Joshua: Get up;</b> why do you lie upon your face?” (Joshua 7:10). It is a disgrace for a distinguished person to fall on his face and have his prayers unanswered. Consequently, Rav did not prostrate himself in public.

### Part 16
Apropos Rav’s practice of prostrating himself, the Gemara continues with a discussion of different forms of bowing. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The term <b><i>kidda</i></b> indicates falling <b>upon</b> one’s <b>face,</b> with one’s face toward the ground, <b>as it is stated: “Then Bathsheba bowed [<i>vatikod</i>] with her face to the ground”</b> (I Kings 1:31). <b><i>Keria</i></b> means bowing <b>upon one’s knees, as it is stated</b> with regard to Solomon: He finished praying and <b>“he rose from before the altar of the Lord, from kneeling [<i>mikkeroa</i>] upon his knees”</b> (I Kings 8:54). Finally, <b><i>hishtaḥava’a</i>, that is</b> bowing with one’s <b>arms and legs spread</b> in total submission, <b>as it is stated</b> that Jacob asked, in response to Joseph’s dream: <b>“Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down [<i>lehishtaḥavot</i>] to you to the ground?”</b> (Genesis 37:10).

### Part 17
The Gemara relates that <b>Levi</b> once <b>demonstrated</b> the form of <b><i>kidda</i></b> that was performed by the High Priest <b>before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. This bowing was especially difficult, as it involved bending from the waist until his head reached the ground, supporting his body with his thumbs, and then rising at once. In the course of his demonstration, Levi dislocated his hip and <b>became lame.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: Was it <b>this that caused</b> Levi to become lame? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Elazar say: A person should never speak impertinently toward</b> God <b>on High, as a great man</b> once <b>spoke impertinently toward</b> God <b>on High and he became lame? And who was he? Levi.</b> The reason Levi became lame was because of the way he spoke to God (see <i>Ta’anit</i> 25a), not due to having performed <i>kidda</i>. The Gemara answers: Both <b>this and that caused</b> Levi to become lame. Since he spoke impertinently toward God, he was worthy of punishment, and he therefore suffered an injury while exerting himself to perform <i>kidda</i>.

### Part 19
On the topic of bowing, <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin said: I saw Abaye</b>
