### Part 1
<b>May the good bless You, this is a path of heresy,</b> as heretics divide the world into two domains, good and evil. If one says the following in his prayers: Just as <b>Your mercy is extended to a bird’s nest,</b> as You have commanded us to send away the mother before taking her chicks or eggs (see Deuteronomy 22:6–7), so too extend Your mercy to us; <b>or: May Your name be mentioned with the good;</b> or: <b>We give thanks, we give thanks,</b> twice, he is suspected of heretical beliefs and they <b>silence him.</b>

### Part 2
If <b>one modifies</b> the text while reading the laws of <b>forbidden sexual relations,</b> i.e., he introduces euphemisms out of a sense of propriety, <b>they silence him.</b> Similarly, if <b>one says</b> while translating the verse: <b>“And you shall not give any of your seed to set them apart to Molekh”</b> (Leviticus 18:21): And <b>you shall not give</b> any of your seed <b>to impregnate an Aramean woman, he is silenced with rebuke.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna cites three instances where the communal prayer leader is silenced. The Gemara clarifies: <b>Granted,</b> they silence one who repeats: <b>We give thanks, we give thanks, as it appears like</b> he is acknowledging and praying to <b>two authorities. And,</b> granted, <b>they also</b> silence one who says: <b>May Your name be mentioned with the good,</b> as this formulation <b>indicates</b> one is thanking God only <b>for the good and not for the bad, and we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Berakhot</i> 54a): <b>One is obligated to bless</b> God <b>for the bad just as he blesses</b> Him <b>for the good. However,</b> in the case of one who recites: Just as <b>Your mercy is extended to a bird’s nest, what is the reason</b> that they silence him?

### Part 4
<b>Two <i>amora’im</i> in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>disagree</b> about <b>this</b> question, <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin and Rabbi Yosei bar Zevida. One said</b> that this was <b>because</b> one who says this <b>engenders jealousy among God’s creations,</b> as it appears as though he is indicating that God favored one creature over all others. <b>And one said</b> that saying this is prohibited <b>because one transforms the attributes of the Holy One, Blessed be He, into</b> expressions of <b>mercy, and they are nothing but decrees</b> of the King that must be fulfilled without inquiring into the reasons behind them.

### Part 5
The Gemara relates that <b>a particular</b> individual <b>descended</b> before the ark as prayer leader <b>in the presence of Rabba,</b> and <b>said</b> in his prayers: <b>You have shown mercy to birds,</b> as expressed through the mitzva to chase away the mother bird before taking eggs from its <b>nest; have mercy and pity upon us. You have shown mercy</b> to animals, as expressed through the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>and its offspring</b> on the same day; <b>have mercy and pity upon us. Rabba said: How much does this rabbi know to appease</b> the Lord, <b>his Master! Abaye said to him: Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>they silence him?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara explains: <b>And Rabba,</b> too, held in accordance with this mishna but merely acted this way because <b>he wanted to hone Abaye’s</b> intellect. Rabba did not make his statement to praise the rabbi, but simply to test his nephew and student, Abaye, and to encourage him to articulate what he knows about the mishna.

### Part 7
With regard to additions to prayers formulated by the Sages, the Gemara relates that <b>a particular</b> individual <b>descended</b> before the ark as prayer leader <b>in the presence of Rabbi Ḥanina.</b> He extended his prayer and <b>said: God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome, the powerful, and the strong, and the fearless.</b>

### Part 8
When he finished, Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to him: Have you concluded</b> all of <b>the praises of your Master? Even these three</b> praises <b>that we recite:</b> The great, the mighty, and the awesome, <b>had Moses our teacher not written them in the Torah</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>and had the members of the Great Assembly not come and incorporated them</b> into the <i>Amida</i> prayer (see Nehemiah 9:32), <b>we would not</b> be permitted to <b>recite them. And you went on and recited all of these. It is comparable to a man who possessed many thousands of golden dinars, yet they were praising him for</b> owning <b>a thousand silver</b> ones. <b>Isn’t that deprecatory toward him?</b> All of the praises one can lavish upon the Lord are nothing but a few silver dinars relative to many thousands of gold dinars. Reciting a litany of praise does not enhance God’s honor.

### Part 9
Tangentially, the Gemara cites an additional statement by Rabbi Ḥanina, concerning principles of faith. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Everything is in the hands of Heaven, except for fear of Heaven.</b> Man has free will to serve God or not, <b>as it is stated: “And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you other than to fear</b> the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 10:12). The fact that God asks man to fear Him indicates that it is in man’s ability to do so.

### Part 10
The Gemara notes: This proves <b>by inference that fear</b> of Heaven <b>is a minor matter,</b> as the verse is formulated as though God is not asking anything significant. Can it in fact be maintained that fear of Heaven is a minor matter? The Gemara responds: <b>Indeed, for Moses our teacher,</b> fear of Heaven <b>is a minor matter. It is comparable to one who is asked for a large vessel and he has</b> one; <b>it seems to him like a small vessel</b> because he owns it. However, one who is asked for just <b>a small</b> vessel and he does not have one, <b>it seems to him like a large vessel.</b> Therefore, Moses could say: What does the Lord your God ask of you other than to fear, because in his eyes it was a minor matter.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: One who</b> repeats himself while reciting <i>Shema</i> and <b>says: Listen</b> Israel, <b>listen</b> Israel, <b>is like one who says: We give thanks, we give thanks.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara <b>raises an objection:</b> It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who recites <i>Shema</i> and repeats it, it is reprehensible.</b> One may infer: <b>It is reprehensible,</b> but <b>they do not silence him.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> case, where one repeats <i>Shema</i> and it is reprehensible but they do not silence him, is referring to <b>one who recites and repeats each individual word.</b> In so doing, he ruins the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. However, <b>that</b> case, where Rabbi Zeira holds that they silence one who repeats <i>Shema</i>, is referring to <b>one who recites and repeats an entire verse,</b> as it appears that he is worshipping separate authorities.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Pappa said to Rava</b> with regard to this <i>halakha</i>: <b>And perhaps initially he did not focus his attention</b> on the recitation of <i>Shema</i> and therefore had to repeat it, <b>and now he focused his attention.</b> Rava <b>said to him: Can one have</b> that degree of <b>familiarity with Heaven,</b> to the extent that he can take his words lightly and say them however he likes? <b>If he did not focus his attention, we beat him with a blacksmith’s hammer until he focuses his attention,</b> as conduct of that sort is unacceptable.

### Part 14
We learned in the mishna: If <b>one modifies</b> the text while reading the laws of <b>forbidden sexual relations, they silence him. Rav Yosef taught</b> that this is referring to one who says: <b>The shame of his father and the shame of his mother,</b> instead of: “The nakedness of your father and the nakedness of your mother you shall not uncover” (Leviticus 18:7).

### Part 15
We learned in the mishna: If <b>one says,</b> while translating the verse: <b>“And you shall not give any of your seed to set them apart to Molekh”</b> (Leviticus 18:21): And you shall not give any of your seed to impregnate an Aramean woman, he is silenced with rebuke. A Sage <b>from the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> One who translates the verse in this manner maintains that <b>the verse speaks of a Jew who has relations with a gentile woman and fathered from her a son</b> who will be raised to engage in <b>idol worship.</b>

### Part 16
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The incident of Reuben,</b> about which it says: “And Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine” (Genesis 35:22), <b>is read</b> from the Torah in public <b>but not translated,</b> so that the uneducated not come to denigrate Reuben. <b>The incident of Tamar</b> (Genesis, chapter 38) <b>is read</b> in public <b>and</b> also <b>translated. The first</b> report of the <b>incident of the</b> Golden <b>Calf,</b> i.e., the Torah’s account of the incident itself (Exodus 32:1–20), <b>is read and translated, but the second</b> narrative, i.e., Aaron’s report to Moses of what had taken place (Exodus 32:21–24) <b>is read but not translated.</b> The verses constituting <b>the Priestly Benediction</b> (Numbers 6:24–26) <b>and the incident of David and Amnon</b> (II Samuel, chapter 13) are <b>read, but not translated.</b>

### Part 17
<b>One may not conclude</b> the Torah reading <b>with</b> by reading from the Prophets <b>the</b> account of the Divine <b>Chariot</b> (Ezekiel, chapter 1), so as not to publicize that which was meant to remain hidden. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda permits</b> it. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One may not conclude with</b> section from the Prophets beginning with: <b>“Make known to Jerusalem</b> her abominations” (Ezekiel 16:2), because it speaks derogatively of the Jewish people.

### Part 18
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (3:31): <b>There are</b> portions of the Bible that are <b>read and translated; there are</b> portions that <b>are read but not translated; and there are</b> portions that <b>are neither read nor translated. The following are read and translated:</b> The Hebrew acronym <b><i>bet</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>tav</i>; <i>ayin</i>, <i>kuf</i>, <i>nun</i>; <i>nun</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>peh</i>, <i>heh</i></b> comprise <b>a mnemonic</b> for the sections included in this category, as the Gemara will explain.

### Part 19
The Gemara enumerates the sections indicated by the letters of the mnemonic. The section <b>of the act of Creation [<i>bereshit</i>],</b> alluded to by the letter <i>bet</i>, <b>is read and translated.</b> The Gemara comments: This <b>is obvious.</b> Why might one think otherwise? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that if the story of the Creation is read in public people <b>will come to ask</b> questions that should not be asked, for instance: <b>What is above and what is below,</b>
