### Part 1
<b>they may purchase scrolls</b> of the Prophets and the Writings. If they sold <b>scrolls</b> of the Prophets and Writings, <b>they may purchase a Torah</b> scroll.

### Part 2
<b>However,</b> the proceeds of a sale of a sacred item may not be used to purchase an item of a lesser degree of sanctity. Therefore, <b>if they sold a Torah</b> scroll, <b>they may not</b> use the proceeds to <b>purchase scrolls</b> of the Prophets and the Writings. If they sold <b>scrolls</b> of the Prophets and Writings, <b>they may not purchase wrapping cloths.</b> If they sold <b>wrapping cloths, they may not purchase an ark.</b> If they sold <b>an ark, they may not purchase a synagogue.</b> If they sold <b>a synagogue, they may not purchase a town square.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And similarly,</b> the same limitation applies <b>to</b> any <b>surplus funds</b> from the sale of sacred items, i.e., if after selling an item and purchasing something of a greater degree of sanctity there remain additional, unused funds, the leftover funds are subject to the same principle and may be used to purchase only something of a degree of sanctity greater than that of the original item.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states: <b>Residents of a town who sold the town square</b> may purchase a synagogue with the proceeds. Concerning this mishna, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is the statement of Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei, cited unattributed. However, the Rabbis say: The town square does not have any sanctity.</b> Therefore, if it is sold, the residents may use the money from the sale for any purpose.

### Part 5
<b>And Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei, what is his reason</b> for claiming that the town square has sanctity? <b>Since the people pray in</b> the town square <b>on</b> communal <b>fast days and on</b> non-priestly <b>watches,</b> it is defined as a place of prayer and as such has sanctity. <b>And the Rabbis,</b> why do they disagree? They maintain <b>that</b> use of the town square <b>is merely an irregular occurrence.</b> Consequently, the town square is not to be defined as a place of prayer, and so it has no sanctity.

### Part 6
§ The mishna states: If they sold <b>a synagogue, they may purchase an ark.</b> The Gemara cites a qualification to this <i>halakha</i>: <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a synagogue of a village,</b> which is considered the property of the residents of that village. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a synagogue of a city, since</b> people <b>come to it from the</b> outside <b>world,</b> the residents of the city <b>are not able to sell it, because it is</b> considered to be the property <b>of the public</b> at large and does not belong exclusively to the residents of the city.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ashi said: This synagogue of Mata Meḥasya, although</b> people <b>from the</b> outside <b>world come to it, since they come at my discretion,</b> as I established it, and everything is done there in accordance with my directives, <b>if I wish, I can sell it.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani’s statement, from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a synagogue of bronze workers [<i>tursiyyim</i>] that was in Jerusalem, which they sold to Rabbi Eliezer, and he used it for all his</b> own <b>needs.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But wasn’t</b> the synagogue <b>there</b> one <b>of cities,</b> as Jerusalem is certainly classified as a city; why were they permitted to sell it? The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> one <b>was a small synagogue, and</b> it was the bronze workers <b>themselves</b> who <b>built it.</b> Therefore, it was considered exclusively theirs, and they were permitted to sell it.

### Part 9
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to leprosy of houses: “And I put the plague of leprosy <b>in a house of the land of your possession”</b> (Leviticus 14:34), from which it may be inferred: <b>“Your possession,”</b> i.e., a privately owned house, <b>can become ritually impure with leprosy, but</b> a house in <b>Jerusalem cannot become ritually impure with leprosy,</b> as property there belongs collectively to the Jewish people and is not privately owned. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: I heard</b> this distinction stated <b>only</b> with regard to <b>the site of the Temple alone,</b> but not with regard to the entire city of Jerusalem.

### Part 10
The Gemara explains: From Rabbi Yehuda’s statement, it is apparent that only the site of the Temple cannot become ritually impure, <b>but synagogues and study halls</b> in Jerusalem <b>can become ritually impure. Why</b> should this be true given <b>that they are</b> owned by the <b>city?</b> The Gemara answers: Emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>say</b> as follows: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: I heard</b> this distinction stated <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a sacred site,</b> which includes the Temple, synagogues, and study halls.

### Part 11
<b>With regard to what</b> principle do the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree? The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>Jerusalem was not apportioned to the tribes,</b> i.e., it was never assigned to any particular tribe, but rather it belongs collectively to the entire nation. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds: Jerusalem was apportioned to the tribes,</b> and it is only the site of the Temple itself that belongs collectively to the entire nation.

### Part 12
The Gemara notes: They each follow a different opinion <b>in the dispute</b> between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>:</b>

### Part 13
One <i>tanna</i> holds that Jerusalem was apportioned to the tribes, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> part of the Temple <b>was in the</b> tribal <b>portion of Judah? The Temple mount, the</b> Temple <b>chambers, and the</b> Temple <b>courtyards. And what was in the</b> tribal <b>portion of Benjamin? The Entrance Hall, the Sanctuary, and the Holy of Holies.</b>

### Part 14
<b>And a strip</b> of land <b>issued forth from the portion of Judah and entered into the portion of Benjamin, and upon</b> that strip <b>the altar was built, and</b> the tribe of <b>Benjamin, the righteous, would agonize over it every day</b> desiring <b>to absorb it</b> into its portion, due to its unique sanctity, <b>as it is stated</b> in Moses’ blessing to Benjamin: <b>“He covers it throughout the day,</b> and he dwells between his shoulders” (Deuteronomy 33:12). The phrase “covers it” is understood to mean that Benjamin is continually focused upon that site. <b>Therefore, Benjamin was privileged by becoming the host [<i>ushpizekhan</i>] of the</b> Divine Presence, as the Holy of Holies was built in his portion.

### Part 15
<b>And this</b> other <b><i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>Jerusalem was not apportioned to the tribes, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not rent out houses in Jerusalem, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the houses <b>do not belong to</b> those occupying them. Rather, as is true for the entire city, they are owned collectively by the nation. <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok says: Even beds may not</b> be hired out. <b>Therefore,</b> in the case of the <b>hides of</b> the renter’s <b>offerings</b> that the innkeepers take in lieu of payment, the <b>innkeepers</b> are considered to be <b>taking them by force,</b> as they did not have a right to demand payment.

### Part 16
Apropos the topic of inns, the Gemara reports: <b>Abaye said: Learn from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that <b>it is proper etiquette</b> for <b>a person to leave</b> his wine <b>flask and</b> the <b>hide</b> of the animal that he slaughtered <b>at his inn,</b> i.e., the inn where he stayed, as a gift for the service he received.

### Part 17
§ The Gemara returns its discussion of the mishna: <b>Rava said: They taught</b> that there is a limitation on what may be purchased with the proceeds of the sale of a synagogue <b>only when the seven representatives of the town</b> who were appointed to administer the town’s affairs <b>had not sold</b> the synagogue <b>in an assembly of the residents of the town. However,</b> if <b>the seven representatives of the town had sold</b> it <b>in an assembly of the residents of the town,</b> then <b>even</b>
