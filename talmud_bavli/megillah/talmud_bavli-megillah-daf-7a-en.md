### Part 1
the term: <b>The second, and it was</b> also <b>necessary to write</b> the phrase: <b>In each and every year;</b> proof from one of the verses would have been insufficient. <b>As, if</b> I had derived the <i>halakha</i> only <b>from</b> the phrase: <b>In each and every year, I would have said</b> my conclusion <b>according to our question</b> raised earlier: Why not celebrate Purim in the Adar adjacent to Shevat? <b>Therefore, it teaches us</b> using the term: <b>The second. And had it taught us</b> only the term: <b>The second, I would have said</b> that Purim must be celebrated both <b>in the first</b> Adar <b>and in the second</b> Adar, <b><i>ab initio</i>. Therefore, it teaches us: In each and every year,</b> indicating that even in an intercalated year, just as in an ordinary year, Purim is to be celebrated only once.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei, what does he do with this</b> term: <b>The second?</b> Since he holds that the Megilla is read in the first Adar, what does he derive from the verse? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires</b> the term <b>to</b> derive <b>that</b> statement <b>of Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda, as Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda said: Initially, they established</b> the observance of Purim <b>in</b> the city of <b>Shushan</b> alone, <b>and ultimately</b> they established it <b>throughout the world,</b> according to the second letter of Purim.

### Part 3
Apropos the statement of Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda with regard to the establishment of the holiday of Purim, the Gemara cites a related statement. <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda said: Esther sent to the Sages: Establish me for</b> future <b>generations.</b> Esther requested that the observance of Purim and the reading of the Megilla be instituted as an ordinance for all generations. <b>They sent to her: You will</b> thereby <b>arouse the wrath of the nations upon us,</b> as the Megilla recounts the victory of the Jews over the gentiles, and it is best not to publicize that victory. <b>She sent</b> back <b>to them: I am already written in the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia,</b> and so the Megilla will not publicize anything that is not already known worldwide.

### Part 4
It was related that <b>Rav and Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rav Ḥaviva taught</b> the statement cited below. The Gemara comments: <b>Throughout the order of <i>Moed</i>, wherever this</b> latter <b>pair</b> of Sages is mentioned, <b>exchange Rabbi Yoḥanan and insert Rabbi Yonatan</b> in his place. They said: <b>Esther sent to the Sages: Write me for</b> future <b>generations</b> and canonize my book as part of the Bible. <b>They sent to her</b> that it is written: <b>“Have I not written for you three times”</b> (Proverbs 22:20), indicating that Israel’s battle with Amalek is to be mentioned <b>three times</b> in the Bible <b>and not four times?</b> Since it is already mentioned three times (Exodus 17:8–16; Deuteronomy 25:17–19; I Samuel 15), there is no need to add a fourth source.

### Part 5
The Sages did not accede to Esther’s request <b>until they found a verse written in the Torah: “Write this for a memorial in the book,</b> and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: That I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens” (Exodus 17:14). The Sages interpreted the verse: <b>“Write this,” that which is written</b> in the Torah <b>here</b> in Exodus, <b>and in Deuteronomy; “a memorial,” that which is written in the Prophets,</b> i.e., in I Samuel, on this matter; <b>“in the book,” that which is written in the Megilla.</b> The Megilla is the third mention of Amalek and not the fourth, as both mentions in the Torah pertaining to Amalek are considered one; therefore, Esther would be the third, not the fourth source.

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: This matter is <b>parallel</b> to a dispute between <b>the <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Write this,” that which is written here,</b> in the book of Exodus; <b>“a memorial,” that which is written in Deuteronomy; “in the book,” that which is written in the Prophets;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua. Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i</b> disagrees and <b>says: “Write this,” that which is written</b> in the Torah <b>here</b> in Exodus, <b>and in Deuteronomy; “a memorial,” that which is written in the Prophets</b> on this matter; <b>“in the book,” that which is written in the Megilla.</b> Here too, the <i>tanna’im</i> disagreed whether or not the book of Esther has the same force and sanctity as that of the canonized books of the Bible.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The book of <b>Esther does not render the hands ritually impure.</b> Although the Sages issued a decree that sacred scrolls render hands ritually impure, the book of Esther was not accorded the sanctity of sacred scrolls.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Shmuel maintains</b> that the book of <b>Esther was not stated with</b> the inspiration of <b>the Divine Spirit? But didn’t Shmuel</b> himself <b>say</b> elsewhere that the book of <b>Esther was stated with</b> the inspiration of <b>the Divine Spirit?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It was stated</b> with the Divine Spirit that it is <b>to be read</b> in public; <b>however, it was not stated</b> that it is <b>to be written.</b> Therefore, the text was not accorded the sanctity of sacred scrolls.

### Part 9
<b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The book of <b>Ecclesiastes does not render the hands ritually impure,</b> as it was not accorded the sanctity of sacred scrolls; <b>however, there is a dispute with regard to</b> whether or not <b>the Song of Songs</b> renders the hands impure. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The Song of Songs renders the hands ritually impure, but there is a dispute with regard to</b> the book of <b>Ecclesiastes. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The ruling with regard to <b>Ecclesiastes is among the leniencies of Beit Shammai and among the stringencies of Beit Hillel,</b> as according to Beit Hillel it renders the hands impure and according to Beit Shammai it does not. <b>However,</b> everyone agrees that the books of <b>Ruth, and the Song of Songs, and Esther render the hands ritually impure,</b> contrary to the opinion of Shmuel. The Gemara answers: It was Shmuel <b>who stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua</b> cited earlier that the book of Esther was not accorded the sanctity of sacred scrolls.

### Part 10
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says:</b> The book of <b>Ecclesiastes does not render the hands ritually impure because it is the wisdom of Solomon,</b> and not divinely inspired. <b>They said to him:</b> It was certainly divinely inspired and that is the reason that the book of Ecclesiastes was added to the canon; <b>as was it this alone that</b> Solomon <b>said? Wasn’t it already stated: “And he spoke three thousand proverbs,</b> and his poems were a thousand and five” (I Kings 5:12)? Solomon spoke many proverbs, but only a portion of them were canonized in the Bible. Apparently, what is unique about those in Ecclesiastes is that they were divinely inspired. <b>And it says: “Add you not unto his words”</b> (Proverbs 30:6).

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is added by the proof introduced with the phrase: <b>And it says?</b> Why wasn’t the first proof sufficient? The Gemara answers: <b>And if you would say</b> that in terms of what <b>he said, he said a great deal,</b> with regard to <b>which, if he</b> so <b>desired, it was written, and if he</b> so <b>desired, it was not written;</b> then that is why not all of his statements were preserved. Therefore, <b>come</b> and <b>hear: Add you not unto his words.</b> Apparently, the reason that it is prohibited to add to the proverbs is that the book of Ecclesiastes was divinely inspired.

### Part 12
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The book of <b>Esther was said with</b> the inspiration of <b>the Divine Spirit, as it is stated: “And Haman thought in his heart”</b> (Esther 6:6). If the book of Esther was not divinely inspired, how was it known what Haman thought in his heart? <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The book of <b>Esther was said with</b> the inspiration of <b>the Divine Spirit, as it is stated: “And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked upon her”</b> (Esther 2:15); this could have been known only through divine inspiration.

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The book of <b>Esther was said with</b> the inspiration of <b>the Divine Spirit, as it is stated</b> with regard to the conspiracy of Bigtan and Teresh against Ahasuerus: <b>“And the thing became known to Mordecai”</b> (Esther 2:22). This too could have been known only through divine inspiration. <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Durmaskit says:</b> The book of <b>Esther was said with</b> the inspiration of <b>the Divine Spirit, as it is stated: “But they did not lay their hands on the plunder”</b> (Esther 9:15). The only way that could have been stated with certainty is through divine inspiration.

### Part 14
<b>Shmuel said: Had I been there</b> among the <i>tanna’im</i>, <b>I would have stated a matter that is superior to them all, as it is stated: “They confirmed, and took upon themselves”</b> (Esther 9:27), which was interpreted to mean: <b>They confirmed above</b> in heaven <b>what they took upon themselves below</b> on earth. Clearly, it is only through divine inspiration that this could have been ascertained.

### Part 15
<b>Rava said: There is a refutation for all</b> of these proofs, <b>except for</b> the proof cited by <b>Shmuel, for which there is no refutation.</b> The Gemara elaborates. That <b>which Rabbi Eliezer</b> said with regard to knowledge of what Haman was thinking in his heart can be refuted, as <b>it is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning</b> to conclude that this was his thinking. <b>There was no</b> other <b>person as important to the king as he</b> was; <b>and</b> the fact is <b>that when he elaborated extensively and said:</b> “Let the royal apparel be brought” (Esther 6:8), <b>he said</b> it <b>with himself in mind.</b>

### Part 16
That <b>which Rabbi Akiva</b> said with regard to the knowledge that Esther found favor in the eyes of all, <b>perhaps</b> it can be understood and refuted <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, who said:</b> This <b>teaches that she appeared to each and every one as</b> one of <b>his nation,</b> and they expressed that sentiment aloud.

### Part 17
<b>And that which Rabbi Meir</b> said, i.e., that the divine inspiration of the book of Esther is clear from the fact that Mordecai exposed the conspiracy against Ahasuerus, <b>perhaps</b> this can be explained and refuted <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, who said: Bigtan and Teresh were both</b> members of the <b>Tarsi</b> people and conversed in their own language. Mordecai, who was a member of the Sanhedrin and therefore fluent in many languages, understood what they were saying.

### Part 18
<b>And that which Rabbi Yosei ben Durmaskit</b> said with regard to the knowledge that no spoils were taken, <b>perhaps</b> this can be explained and refuted by the fact that <b>they dispatched messengers</b> who informed them of the situation. However, <b>with regard to Shmuel’s</b> proof from the fact that they confirmed above what they took upon themselves below, <b>there is certainly no refutation. Ravina said: This</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say: One sharp pepper is better than a basketful of pumpkins,</b> as the quality of the pepper’s taste is more significant than the quantity of the pumpkins.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> Proof that the book of Esther was divinely inspired may be cited <b>from here: “And these days of Purim shall not cease from among the Jews”</b> (Esther 9:28), an assertion that could have been made only with divine inspiration. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> Proof may be cited <b>from here,</b> at the end of that verse: <b>“Nor the memorial of them perish from their seed”</b> (Esther 9:28).

### Part 20
The mishna mentions: <b>And gifts</b> distributed <b>to the poor. Rav Yosef taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“And of sending portions one to another”</b> (Esther 9:22), indicating <b>two portions to one person.</b> The verse continues: <b>“And gifts to the poor”</b> (Esther 9:22), indicating <b>two gifts to two people.</b>

### Part 21
The Gemara relates that, on Purim, <b>Rabbi Yehuda Nesia sent to Rabbi Oshaya the leg of a third-</b>born <b>calf and a jug of wine.</b> Rabbi Oshaya <b>sent him</b> a message of gratitude:
