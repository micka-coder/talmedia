### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the method for determining whether an earthenware vessel contains a hole that allows liquid to enter is as follows: One takes the <b>handles of the pot and turns it over,</b>placing it upside down <b>in</b> an empty tub, <b>and</b> he then <b>covers</b> the pot with <b>water. If</b> water <b>enters</b> the pot, <b>it is known that</b> it contains a hole <b>that enables liquid to enter, and if</b> the water does <b>not</b> enter the pot, <b>it is known that</b> the vessel contains a small hole <b>that enables</b> only the <b>exit</b> of <b>liquids.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Or</b> one can determine the size of the hole by the following method: One <b>places</b> the pot, with liquid in it, <b>on the fire. If the fire holds</b> the liquid back and does not allow it to exit the vessel, then <b>it is known</b> that the vessel contains a small hole <b>that enables</b> only the <b>exit</b> of <b>liquids. And if</b> the fire does <b>not</b> hold the liquid back and does not prevent it from exiting the vessel, then <b>it is known</b> that it contains a hole <b>that enables liquid to enter.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: One should not place</b> the pot with liquid in it <b>on the fire.</b> This is not a reliable test for determining the size of the hole, as it is possible that the hole is actually large enough to enable liquid to enter, but nevertheless <b>the fire prevents</b> the liquid from exiting. <b>Rather, one places</b> the pot with liquid in it <b>on hot ash. If the hot ash holds</b> the liquid back and does not allow it to exit the vessel, then <b>it is known</b> that the vessel contains a small hole <b>that enables</b> only the <b>exit</b> of <b>liquids. But if</b> the hot ash does <b>not</b> hold the liquid back and does not prevent it from exiting the vessel, <b>it is known</b> that it contains a hole <b>that enables liquid to enter.</b> Another manner of testing is to fill the vessel with liquid. If it <b>drips</b> one <b>drop after</b> another <b>drop, it is known</b> that it contains a hole <b>that enables liquid to enter.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the method of testing stated by <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> placing the vessel in a tub of water, and that <b>of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> placing the vessel upside down into the tub and then covering it with water? <b>Ulla said:</b> The difference <b>between</b> their opinions is whether liquid that <b>enters</b> through a hole <b>with difficulty,</b> i.e., as the result of force, is considered entering. According to Rabbi Yehuda, placing the vessel directly into a tub of water constitutes the use of force to a certain degree, and he maintains that if water enters the vessel in such a case, this does not count as liquid entering the vessel. Therefore, he rejects the testing method of the first <i>tanna</i>.

### Part 5
§ The mishna teaches: <b>In any limb</b> of the body <b>where there is a nail,</b> there is certainly a bone in it as well. But it is possible for there to be limbs that contain a bone without a nail. The Gemara explains the halakhic significance of this distinction. A limb <b>in which there is a nail</b> and which therefore certainly contains a bone has the status of a full-fledged limb. Therefore, it <b>transmits impurity</b> through <b>contact, movement, and in a tent,</b> even if its size is less than that of an olive-bulk. By contrast, if <b>there is a bone in</b> the limb <b>but there is no nail,</b> it <b>transmits impurity</b> through <b>contact and movement</b> even if its size is less than that of an olive-bulk, <b>but</b> it does <b>not transmit impurity in a tent</b> unless its size is that of an olive-bulk.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ḥisda says: The</b> following <b>matter was stated by our great rabbi,</b> Rav, <b>may the Omnipresent</b> come <b>to his assistance. An extra finger</b> on one’s hand <b>in which there is a bone but there is no nail transmits impurity</b> through <b>contact and movement</b> even if its size is less than that of an olive-bulk, <b>but</b> it does <b>not transmit impurity in a tent.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i>, that it must contain both bone and a nail for it to be considered a limb, only in a case <b>where</b> this finger <b>cannot be counted along the back of the hand,</b> i.e., the extra finger is not aligned with the others. But if it is aligned with the other fingers then it is considered like any other limb and imparts impurity in a tent, whether or not it contains a nail.

### Part 8
§ The mishna further teaches: Similarly, <b>any</b> item that <b>becomes ritually impure</b> with impurity of a <i>zav</i> imparted by <b>treading</b> becomes ritually impure with impurity imparted by a corpse. The Gemara explains that this means that <b>any item that is fit to</b> become impure with the impurity of a <i>zav</i> imparted by <b>treading</b> is fit to <b>become ritually impure</b> with <b>impurity imparted by a corpse.</b>

### Part 9
The mishna continues: <b>And there are</b> vessels <b>that become ritually impure</b> with <b>impurity imparted by a corpse but do not become ritually impure</b> with impurity of a <i>zav</i> imparted by <b>treading.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by this statement? The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to add</b> a measuring vessel, e.g., the measure of <b>a <i>se’a</i> or a half-<i>se’a</i> [<i>vetarkav</i>].</b>

### Part 10
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the impurity of the treading of a <i>zav</i>: <b>“And he who sits on</b> any <b>object</b> whereon the <i>zav</i> sits shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and is impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:6). One <b>might</b> have thought that if a <i>zav</i> <b>turned over</b> a vessel used to measure <b>a <i>se’a</i> and sat on it, or</b> if he turned over a vessel used to measure <b>a half-<i>se’a</i> and sat on it,</b> that vessel <b>should be</b> rendered <b>impure</b> as a seat upon which a <i>zav</i> sat.

### Part 11
Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he who sits on any object <b>whereon the <i>zav</i> sits”</b> (Leviticus 15:6). The wording of the verse indicates that it is speaking of an object <b>that is designated for sitting,</b> i.e., upon which people generally sit, <b>excluding such</b> a vessel, with regard to <b>which we say to</b> someone sitting on it: <b>Stand up and</b> allow us to use it to <b>do our work,</b> i.e., to measure. This is not defined as a vessel used for sitting, as it serves another function.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Any</b> person <b>who is fit to adjudicate</b> cases of <b>capital law is fit to adjudicate</b> cases of <b>monetary law, and there are</b> those <b>who are fit to adjudicate</b> cases of <b>monetary law but are unfit to adjudicate</b> cases of <b>capital law.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> The statement of the mishna that some are fit to adjudicate cases of monetary law but are unfit to adjudicate cases of capital law serves <b>to add</b> the case of <b>a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> Although he may not adjudicate cases of capital law, nevertheless he may adjudicate cases of monetary law.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary to teach this here? <b>We</b> already <b>learned</b> this on <b>another occasion,</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 32a): <b>All are fit to judge</b> cases of <b>monetary law, but not all are fit to judge</b> cases of <b>capital law. And we discussed it,</b> and asked <b>what is added</b> by the phrase: All are fit to judge. <b>And Rav Yehuda said</b> in response that this serves <b>to add</b> the case of <b>a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> mishna serves <b>to add</b> the case of <b>a convert, and one</b> other mishna serves <b>to add</b> the case of <b>a <i>mamzer</i>.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> both additions <b>are necessary. As, if</b> the <i>mishnayot</i> had <b>taught us</b> only that <b>a convert</b> is fit to judge cases of monetary law, one might have said that the <i>halakha</i> is lenient in the case of a convert <b>because</b> he is <b>fit to enter into the congregation,</b> i.e., marry a Jewish woman. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a <i>mamzer</i>, who is unfit to enter into the congregation,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>he</b> is <b>not</b> fit to judge cases of monetary law.

### Part 16
<b>And if</b> the <i>mishnayot</i> had <b>taught us</b> only that <b>a <i>mamzer</i></b> is fit to judge cases of monetary law, one might have said that the <i>halakha</i> is lenient in the case of a <i>mamzer</i> <b>because he comes from a fit drop</b> of semen, i.e., his father is Jewish. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a convert, who comes from an unfit drop,</b> as he was born a gentile, one might <b>say</b> that he is <b>not</b> fit to judge cases of monetary law. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakhot</i> of both a convert and a <i>mamzer</i>.

### Part 17
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Any</b> person <b>who is fit to adjudicate</b> a case and serve as a judge <b>is fit to testify</b> as a witness, <b>and there are</b> those <b>who are fit to testify but are not fit to adjudicate.</b>

### Part 18
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by this statement, that some people are fit to testify but not to adjudicate? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This serves <b>to add one who is blind in one of his eyes. And</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this ruling?
