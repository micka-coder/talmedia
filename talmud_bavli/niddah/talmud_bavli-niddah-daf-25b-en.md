<b>and dissolves it. Rather, one examines it with oil, as oil is soft and cleans</b> the embryo so that its sex can be discerned. <b>And one views</b> it <b>only in</b> the light of <b>the sun.</b>

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>How does one examine</b> the embryo? The Gemara expresses surprise at this question: <b>How does one examine it</b> to determine whether it has the halakhic status of an offspring? Clearly, one examines it <b>as we</b> just <b>said. Rather,</b> the question is as follows: <b>In what</b> manner <b>does one examine it to ascertain whether it is male or</b> whether <b>it is female?</b>

### Part 3
<b>Abba Shaul bar Nash, and some say Abba Shaul bar Remash, says: One brings a sliver of wood whose top is smooth, and he moves</b> it along the embryo <b>in that place,</b> i.e., the sex organ. <b>If</b> the sliver <b>is caught,</b> i.e., its movement is not smooth, <b>it is known that</b> the embryo <b>is male,</b> as its member interfered with the movement of the sliver. <b>And if</b> the sliver is <b>not</b> caught, <b>it is known that it is female.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that if the movement of the sliver is not smooth then the embryo is male, <b>only</b> if the sliver was moved along the sex organ of the embryo <b>from below to above; but</b> if it was moved <b>from the sides,</b> from one side to the other, the fact that it was not smooth does not prove that the embryo is male, as one can <b>say</b> that <b>the sides of the womb</b> interfered.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says:</b> The complete version of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>taught</b> as follows: <b>If it was female,</b> its vagina can be <b>discerned</b> by the appearance <b>of</b> a line like <b>a cracked</b> grain of <b>barley</b> oriented along the length of its body. <b>Rav Naḥman objects to this: But perhaps it is</b> not the vagina but <b>the recess between the testes,</b> and the embryo is male. <b>Abaye said</b> to him: <b>Now,</b> at this stage of development, <b>the testes</b> of the embryo <b>themselves are not discernible.</b> Is it possible that <b>the recess between the testes is discernible?</b>

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that at this stage an embryo does not have the shape of arms and legs. <b>Rabbi Amram says</b> that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when an embryo’s arms and legs start to take shape, <b>its two thighs</b> look <b>like two strings of crimson</b> thread <b>[<i>zehorit</i>]. And Rabbi Amram says with regard to</b> this matter that the thighs look <b>like</b> two strings <b>of the woof,</b> which are thicker than those of the warp. The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And its two arms</b> look <b>like two strings of crimson</b> thread<b>. And Rabbi Amram says with regard to</b> this matter that the arms look <b>like</b> two strings <b>of the warp.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: <i>Shinnana</i>, do not perform an action,</b> i.e., do not issue a practical ruling deeming a woman who discharges an embryo at this stage of development impure, <b>unless</b> the embryo <b>has grown hair.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say that? But doesn’t Shmuel say</b> with regard to a woman who discharged a gestational sac that <b>both</b> in <b>this</b> case, where the amniotic fluid is turbid, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, where the fluid is clear, the woman must be <b>concerned</b> that the discharged gestational sac might have the status of an offspring, which would mean that she is impure even without the growth of hair on the embryo?

### Part 8
<b>Rav Ami bar Shmuel says:</b> This matter was <b>explained to me by Mar Shmuel:</b> As for <b>being concerned</b> that perhaps she is impure, the woman must be <b>concerned,</b> due to the uncertainty whether she discharged an offspring. But <b>we do not give her</b> the <b>days of purity</b> that follow the period of impurity for a woman who gave birth, <b>unless</b> the embryo <b>has grown hair.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that Shmuel is uncertain</b> whether a gestational sac has the halakhic status of an offspring? <b>But</b> there was an incident involving <b>a certain gestational sac that was brought before Mar Shmuel,</b> and Shmuel <b>said: This</b> embryo <b>is forty-one days old. And</b> Shmuel subsequently <b>calculated</b> the amount of time that had passed <b>from the day that</b> the woman <b>went to</b> perform <b>immersion</b> in a ritual bath <b>until that day, and it was only forty days.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And he said to</b> the local court: <b>This</b> husband <b>engaged in intercourse with</b> his wife when she was <b>a menstruating woman. They bound</b> the husband <b>and he confessed.</b> Since Shmuel was so proficient in embryology, why was he unsure about the halakhic status of a gestational sac? The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel</b> himself <b>is different, as his strength,</b> i.e., his proficiency, was <b>great.</b> His general ruling that the halakhic status of a gestational sac is uncertain applies to people who are not as proficient as he is.

### Part 11
§ The mishna teaches that a woman <b>who discharges a sandal</b> fetus or one who discharges an afterbirth observes the strictures of a woman who gave birth both to a male and to a female. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A sandal</b> fetus has <b>a similar</b> appearance <b>to</b> a certain <b>fish of</b> the <b>sea</b> known as a sandal fish;it looks as though <b>it is</b> a full-fledged <b>offspring from the outset, but it was mashed. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A sandal</b> fetus has an appearance that is <b>similar to the tongue of the large bull.</b> Students <b>testified in the name of our teachers</b> that for <b>a sandal</b> fetus to have the halakhic status of an offspring, it <b>requires the shape of a face.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a sandal</b> fetus <b>requires the shape of a face</b> for it to have the status of an offspring. <b>Rav Adda says</b> that <b>Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: A sandal</b> fetus <b>requires the shape of a face, but</b> the face does not need to be in its proper location; <b>even</b> if the face is <b>on the back of its</b> head, the fetus has the status of an offspring. <b>A parable to</b> which this situation can be compared is that of <b>a person who slapped another</b> in the face <b>and pushed his face back.</b> Here too, the face of the sandal fetus was pushed back due to external pressure.

### Part 13
The Gemara relates: <b>In the days of Rabbi Yannai,</b> the other Sages <b>wished to deem pure</b> a woman who discharges <b>a sandal</b> fetus <b>that does not have the shape of a face. Rabbi Yannai said to them: You have deemed pure</b> women who discharge <b>offspring.</b> Rabbi Yannai holds that even a sandal fetus that does not have the shape of a face is considered an offspring.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that students <b>testified in the name of our teachers</b> that for <b>a sandal</b> fetus to have the halakhic status of an offspring it <b>requires the shape of a face? Rav Beivai bar Abaye says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> in response: <b>This mishna,</b> i.e., the ruling to which the students testified, <b>is taught from the testimony of Rabbi Neḥunya.</b> In other words, this ruling is the opinion of an individual <i>tanna</i>, which is not accepted. <b>Rabbi Zeira says: Rav Beivai merited that his</b> ruling of <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> which he transmitted in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan, was accepted. <b>As he and I were</b> both <b>sitting before Rabbi Yoḥanan when</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said this <i>halakha</i>, but</b> Rav Beivai <b>said it first</b> to the other Sages, <b>and</b> thereby <b>merited</b> that <b>it</b> was ascribed to him.

### Part 15
§ The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does the mishna <b>mention</b> that if a woman discharged <b>a sandal</b> fetus she observes the strictures of a woman who gave birth both to a male and to a female? Since <b>there is no</b> such thing as <b>a sandal</b> fetus <b>that</b> does <b>not</b> have another <b>offspring with it,</b> which mashed it and gave it the form of a sandal fish, in any case the woman has the impurity of a woman after childbirth.

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it is <b>a female</b> offspring that <b>is born with</b> the sandal fetus, it is <b>indeed</b> unnecessary to mention the <i>halakha</i> of the sandal fetus, as the woman is in any case impure for two weeks. But <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where a male is born with it,</b> on account of which the woman would be impure for only seven days were it not for the sandal fetus.

### Part 17
In this case, it is necessary for the mishna to state that the woman observes the strictures of one who gave birth both to a male and to a female, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>since Rav Yitzḥak bar Ami says</b> that the sex of a fetus is determined at the moment of conception, as, if the <b>woman emits seed first she gives birth to a male</b> and if the <b>man emits seed first she gives birth to a female,</b> therefore, it can be concluded <b>from</b> the fact <b>that this</b> offspring that was born with the sandal fetus <b>is male,</b> that <b>this</b> sandal fetus <b>is also male.</b>

### Part 18
Lest this reasoning be accepted, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the woman must observe the strictures of a woman who gave birth to a female as well. This is because one can <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>both</b> the man and the woman <b>emitted seed at the same time,</b> and consequently <b>this</b> offspring <b>is male and that</b> sandal fetus <b>is female.</b>

### Part 19
<b>Alternatively,</b> it can be suggested that it is necessary for the mishna to state this <i>halakha</i> even with regard to a case where the twin of the sandal fetus is female, <b>as, if</b> the woman <b>gives birth to</b> the <b>female before sunset and</b> gives birth to the <b>sandal</b> fetus <b>after sunset,</b> which is considered the next day, the sex of the sandal fetus affects the count of the woman’s periods of impurity and purity.

### Part 20
If the sandal fetus is male, the woman’s status as a woman after childbirth ends after the eightieth day from the birth of the female offspring, and <b>she counts the beginning of</b> the period when seeing blood renders her impure as <b>a menstruating woman from</b> the birth of <b>the first</b> offspring, i.e., the female. <b>But</b> if the sandal fetus is female, the woman has the status of a woman after childbirth until after the eightieth day from its birth, which is the eighty-first day from the birth of the first offspring. If so, she counts <b>the beginning of</b> the period when seeing blood renders her impure as <b>a menstruating woman from</b> the birth of <b>the last</b> offspring, i.e., the sandal fetus.

### Part 21
The Gemara discusses why the case of a woman who discharged a sandal fetus is mentioned in other <i>mishnayot</i>, given that a sandal fetus always has a twin. First the Gemara discusses the <i>halakha</i> of a woman who discharged <b>a sandal</b> fetus <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna
