### Part 1
Therefore, <b>even</b> if the earthenware vessel was <b>full</b> of items as small as <b>mustard</b> seeds, only a few of which touched the sides of the vessel or the impure item inside it, all the items inside the vessel are rendered ritually impure. Likewise, with regard to snow that passes through the vessel’s airspace, all of it becomes impure.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A woman’s reproductive organs are composed of different parts, and the halakhic status of blood that emerges from one part differs from the halakhic status of blood that emerges from another part. <b>The Sages stated a parable with regard to</b> the structure of the sexual organs of <b>a woman,</b> based on the structure of a house: <b>The</b> inner <b>room</b> represents the uterus, <b>and the corridor [<i>perozdor</i>]</b> leading to the inner room represents the vaginal canal, <b>and the upper story</b> represents the bladder.

### Part 3
<b>Blood</b> from <b>the</b> inner <b>room is ritually impure. Blood</b> from <b>the upper story is ritually pure.</b> If blood <b>was found in the corridor,</b> there is uncertainty whether it came from the uterus and is impure, or from the bladder and is pure. Despite <b>its</b> state of <b>uncertainty,</b> it is deemed definitely <b>impure, due to</b> the fact <b>that its presumptive status</b> is of blood that came <b>from the source,</b> i.e., the uterus, and not from the bladder.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rami bar Shmuel and Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, were learning</b> tractate <b><i>Nidda</i></b> in <b>the study hall of Rav Huna. Rabba bar Rav Huna found them sitting and saying</b> an interpretation of this mishna: <b>The room,</b> i.e., the uterus, is the <b>inner</b> part of the reproductive organs, <b>and the corridor</b> is the <b>outer</b> part. <b>And the upper story,</b> the bladder, <b>is built,</b> i.e., found, <b>above them both. And</b> there is <b>an open vestibule between</b> the <b>upper story and the corridor.</b>

### Part 5
They continued: If blood is <b>found from</b> the opening of this <b>vestibule and inward</b> toward the uterus, i.e., inside the vagina, there is uncertainty whether it came from the uterus and is impure, or from the bladder and is pure, but <b>its</b> state of <b>uncertainty</b> renders it definitely <b>impure.</b> If it is found in the area <b>from the</b> opening of this <b>vestibule and outward,</b> on the outer surface of the vulva, the blood is more likely to have come from the bladder, through the urethra, and therefore <b>its</b> state of <b>uncertainty</b> renders it <b>pure.</b>

### Part 6
Rabba <b>came and said to his father,</b> Rav Huna: With regard to the <i>halakha</i> of blood that is found from the vestibule and inward, <b>did the Master say to us</b> that <b>its</b> state of <b>uncertainty</b> renders it <b>impure,</b> as I heard in the study hall, from which it may be inferred that this is a case of uncertain impurity? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: The blood is impure <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that its presumptive status</b> is of blood that came <b>from the source,</b> i.e., the uterus? This indicates that it is a case of definite impurity. If so, the mishna cannot be referring either to blood found from the vestibule and inward or from the vestibule and outward.

### Part 7
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> his son Rabba: <b>This is what I said:</b> If the blood was found <b>from the vestibule inward</b> it is <b>definitely impure,</b> as it is presumed to come from the uterus. This is the case mentioned in the mishna. If the blood was found <b>from the vestibule outward its</b> state of <b>uncertainty</b> renders it <b>impure.</b> Although it can be claimed that if this was blood from the uterus it would not have been found in this area, it is possible that when the woman bent over, the blood went from the uterus into this area. Consequently, she is impure due to the uncertainty.

### Part 8
<b>Abaye says: What is different</b> about a situation where the blood was found <b>from the vestibule outward, where its</b> state of <b>uncertainty</b> renders it <b>impure?</b> The reason for that <i>halakha</i> is <b>that perhaps</b> the woman <b>bent over</b> and leaned forward, <b>and</b> the blood <b>came from the room,</b> i.e., the uterus. If so, in the case where the blood was found <b>from the vestibule inward,</b> concerning which you ruled that she is definitely impure, you can <b>also say</b> that it is possible that the woman <b>staggered</b> backward <b>and</b> as a result the blood <b>came from</b> the <b>upper story</b> to the back of the canal. Accordingly, she should be impure merely out of uncertainty.

### Part 9
<b>Rather, Abaye says: If you follow the concern,</b> i.e., if your ruling of <i>halakha</i> is based on a concern that the blood might have moved due to the woman leaning forward or backward, then in both <b>this</b> case <b>and that,</b> whether the blood is found in the inner or outer section of the canal, the source of the blood <b>is uncertain. And if you follow</b> the <b>presumption</b> based on where the blood found in a particular place is usually from, then blood found <b>from the vestibule inward is definitely impure,</b> whereas blood found <b>from the vestibule outward is definitely pure.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches: Blood that is found in the corridor</b> is considered definite menstrual blood, and therefore if she engages in intercourse, both she and her partner would be <b>liable as a result of</b> this blood to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for entering the Temple</b> intentionally when ritually impure, or to bring an offering for entering unwittingly. <b>And one burns <i>teruma</i> due to it,</b> if the woman touches such produce. <b>And Rav Ketina says:</b> It is impure merely as a matter of uncertainty; therefore, the woman <b>is not obligated, due to</b> that blood, to bring an offering <b>for entering the Temple</b> when ritually impure, <b>and one does not burn <i>teruma</i> on its account.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara discusses the relationship between this dispute and the previous statements of <i>amora’im</i>. <b>According to this formulation,</b> i.e., option, <b>that Abaye stated: If you follow the concern</b> that the blood might have moved due to the woman leaning forward or backward, there is uncertainty whether the blood was found in the inner or outer section of the canal, this <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ketina,</b> who likewise deems blood found in the canal impure due to uncertainty. <b>And</b> this option suggested by Abaye <b>contradicts</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who deems the blood definitely impure.

### Part 12
<b>According to that formulation that Abaye stated: If you follow</b> the <b>presumption</b> that blood found in the inner section is definitely impure, while blood found in the outer section is definitely pure, this <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> whose ruling that the blood is definitely impure is understood as referring to blood found in the inner section.
