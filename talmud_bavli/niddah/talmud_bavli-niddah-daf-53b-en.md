<b>and</b> only <b>thereafter</b> the twilight <b>of Rabbi Yosei begins,</b> when there is uncertainty, and there is a concern that perhaps she saw blood at that time. <b>And that <i>tanna</i></b> of the second <i>baraita</i> <b>holds</b> that the <b>twilight of Rabbi Yosei is subsumed within</b> and occurs at the end of the twilight <b>of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> According to the opinion of this <i>tanna</i>, since she examined herself throughout the twilight of Rabbi Yehuda, she also necessarily examined herself throughout the twilight of Rabbi Yosei and therefore there is no need to be concerned about her status.

### Part 2
§ On the topic of a woman seeing a stain, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A woman <b>who sees</b> a red <b>stain</b> on her garment <b>renders herself and consecrated items</b> that she touched <b>impure retroactively,</b> from the time when that garment was last laundered. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> She does <b>render consecrated items</b> that she touched <b>impure</b> retroactively, but she <b>does not render herself impure</b> with regard to rendering impure objects that she touched since the time the garment was last laundered. The reason is <b>that her stain should not be more stringent than her</b> actual <b>seeing</b> of blood. If she experiences bleeding, she renders impure only objects that she touched during the previous twenty-four-hour period.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But don’t we find</b> that Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar himself holds that <b>her stain</b> is <b>more stringent than her</b> actual <b>seeing</b> of blood <b>with regard to consecrated</b> items? Her stain renders such items impure retroactively from the time that the garment was laundered, whereas her actually seeing blood renders impure only those items that she touched during the past twenty-four-hour period.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>like this: Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says</b> that she does <b>not even render consecrated</b> items that she touched <b>impure</b> retroactively from the time that the garment was laundered, but only those items that she touched during the past twenty-four-hour period. The reason is <b>that her stain should not be more stringent than her</b> actual <b>seeing</b> of blood <b>with regard to any matter.</b>

### Part 6
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a woman <b>who saw</b> a red <b>stain</b> on her garment, <b>and afterward saw blood,</b> what is the <i>halakha</i>? She <b>attributes her stain to her seeing</b> blood, i.e., the stain is treated as part of the seeing of blood, which means that she is impure only from when she found the stain, as it assumed that it appeared no earlier. This is the <i>halakha</i> provided that she saw the blood within a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of her discovery of the stain. But if more than twenty-four hours passed, she cannot attribute the stain to her sighting. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> She may attribute the stain to the sighting only if she experienced bleeding on the <b>day of</b> discovering the stain. If she experienced bleeding after that day, even if it was within twenty-four hours, she may not attribute the stain to the sighting, which means that she is impure retroactively from when she found the stain, in case it appeared earlier. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: The statement of</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar <b>appears</b> to be more correct <b>than mine, as he fixes her</b> situation, i.e., he is lenient, <b>and I ruin her</b> situation, as my ruling is stringent. Since the impurity of a stain applies by rabbinic law, one should follow the more lenient opinion.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: But does Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar actually <b>fix her</b> situation? Does he not <b>ruin her</b> situation? If she experiences bleeding the day after she found the stain, but within twenty-four hours of finding the stain, according to Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar she renders items impure retroactively. By contrast, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi she renders objects impure only from when she discovered the stain. <b>Ravina says: Reverse</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement, so that it states: My statement appears to be more correct than that of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, as I fix her situation and he ruins her situation.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Naḥman says: Actually, do not reverse</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement, as Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi meant the following: Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar’s opinion appears to be more correct, <b>as he fixes her <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <i>ziva</i>.</b> If she experiences bleeding on the day after discovering the stain, the count of her seven days of menstrual flow begins on that day of her actual sighting, not from when she saw the stain. This is due to the fact that the stain is not attributable to the seeing of the blood. Therefore, if she experiences bleeding on the seventh day after first experiencing bleeding, which is the eighth day after discovering the stain, she is not considered a lesser <i>zava</i>, and she can be purified from her status as a menstruating woman.

### Part 10
<b>But I,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>ruin her <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <i>ziva</i>.</b> Since the stain is attributable to the seeing of the blood within twenty-four hours, her counting starts from when she found the stain, and therefore the blood that she sees on the eighth day after discovering the stain is considered <i>ziva</i>. Consequently, she is considered a lesser <i>zava</i> and must observe a clean day for each day she experiences a discharge.

### Part 11
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira asked Rabbi Asi:</b> Are <b>stains</b> like the actual sight of blood, in that they <b>require</b> an examination in which she is clean of blood, marking the first step in her <b>transition</b> from impurity to <b>purity</b> before immersion on the night following the seventh day, <b>or not?</b> Rabbi Asi <b>was silent and said nothing to</b> Rabbi Zeira.

### Part 12
The Gemara relates that on another <b>occasion</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>found</b> Rabbi Asi <b>sitting and saying</b> that a woman who sees a stain and afterward experiences bleeding <b>attributes her stain to her seeing</b> blood, if she saw the blood within a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of when she discovered the stain. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.

### Part 13
Rabbi Asi added that there is a dispute with regard to the details of this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> This applies only in a case <b>where she examined</b> herself at the end of the seventh day from the discovery of the stain. This examination indicates that the stain is related to her experiencing bleeding, and therefore the standard <i>halakha</i> of a woman who becomes pure at the end of her seven menstrual days applies to her. By contrast, if she examined herself only at the end of the eighth day, the stain is not attributable to her bleeding. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The stain is attributable to her bleeding under all circumstances, <b>even if she did not examine</b> herself until the eighth day.

### Part 14
Upon hearing this, Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Rabbi Asi: Does that mean, <b>by inference, that stains require</b> an examination marking the first step in her <b>transition</b> from impurity to <b>purity?</b> Rabbi Asi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: <b>Yes,</b> that is the <i>halakha</i>. Rabbi Zeira further said to Rabbi Asi: <b>But</b> on <b>many occasions I asked you</b> about this matter <b>and you did not say anything to me. Perhaps in the course</b> of your studies this <i>halakha</i> <b>came</b> back <b>to you?</b> Rabbi Asi <b>said to him: Yes, in the course</b> of my studies this <i>halakha</i> <b>came</b> back <b>to me.</b>

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a woman <b>who sees</b> an emission of blood during <b>twilight</b> on the <b>eleventh day</b> of the days in which she can assume the status of a <i>zava</i>, as there is uncertainty whether the emission was during the day and it is the flow of a <i>zava</i> or whether it was at night and it is menstrual flow, she observes seven days of impurity like <b>the beginning of</b> the seven days of <b>menstruation and the end of menstruation.</b> If she experienced an emission on the two previous days as well, she observes seven clean days before immersion like <b>the beginning of the flow of <i>ziva</i> and the end of the flow of <i>ziva</i>.</b>

### Part 16
Similarly, in the case of a woman who experiences an emission of blood during twilight on <b>the fortieth day</b> after the birth <b>of a male or the eightieth day</b> after the birth <b>of a female,</b> there is uncertainty whether it is considered daytime and therefore part of the final day of the blood of purity, or night that is part of the following day when the blood is impure. With regard to experiencing bleeding during <b>twilight in all</b> those cases, <b>these</b> women <b>are mistaken</b> in their calculation of the days of menstrual flow and the flow of a <i>zava</i>. Consequently, if they experience bleeding for three consecutive days at the beginning or at the end of the eleven days of <i>ziva</i>, they bring the offering of a <i>zava</i> but it is not eaten, as it was brought based on uncertainty.

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: Instead of</b> making provisions to <b>remedy</b> the uncertainties <b>of the misguided, come and remedy</b> the uncertainties of <b>the competent</b> women who know what day they saw the blood but require guidance, due to the multitude of emissions that they experienced.

### Part 18
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if a woman experiences bleeding during twilight on the eleventh day of the days on which she can assume the status of a <i>zava</i>, the flow is considered to be <b>the beginning of</b> the seven days of <b>menstruation and the end of menstruation.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: But the concern <b>is</b> only that this flow might be either <b>the beginning of</b> the seven days of <b>menstruation,</b> if twilight is treated as night, <b>or the end of <i>ziva</i>,</b> if twilight is treated as day.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> A woman <b>who sees</b> an emission of blood during <b>twilight</b> on the <b>eleventh day</b> of the days on which she can assume the status of a <i>zava</i> must be concerned both for the possibility that it is <b>the beginning of</b> the seven days of <b>menstruation and</b> for the possibility that it is <b>the end of the flow of <i>ziva</i>.</b> If she had also seen an emission on the two previous days, she observes seven clean days before immersion, due to uncertainty.

### Part 20
With regard to the continuation of the mishna, which states: The beginning of the flow of <i>ziva</i> and the end of the flow of <i>ziva</i>, this should be understood as follows: <b>And</b> in the case of a woman who experiences an emission of blood during twilight <b>on the seventh</b> day of the seven days of the flow <b>of her menstruation,</b> she must be concerned both for the possibility that it is <b>the end of</b> the seven days of <b>menstruation and</b> for the possibility that it is <b>the beginning of the flow of <i>ziva</i>.</b>

### Part 21
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said</b> to the Rabbis: <b>Instead of</b> making provisions to <b>remedy</b> the uncertainties <b>of the misguided,</b> come and remedy the uncertainties of the competent women. The Gemara asks: <b>Are these</b> women who experience bleeding during twilight
