### Part 1
<b>Three</b> hairs tied together in a knot <b>do not interpose,</b> as three hairs cannot be tied so tightly that water cannot penetrate them. With regard to <b>two</b> hairs tied together in a knot, <b>I do not know</b> the <i>halakha</i>. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: We have</b> a tradition that <b>only one</b> hair interposes, but two or more do not prevent the water from reaching the body.

### Part 2
§ <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: By Torah law,</b> if there is an interposition between a person and the water, and it covers <b>the majority of his</b> body, and <b>he is particular</b> and wants the interposing substance removed, <b>it interposes</b> and invalidates an immersion in a ritual bath. But if it covers the <b>majority of his</b> body <b>but he is not particular about</b> that substance, <b>it does not interpose. But</b> the Sages <b>issued a decree</b> prohibiting substances covering <b>the majority</b> of <b>his</b> body with regard to <b>which he is not particular, due to</b> substances covering <b>the majority</b> of <b>his</b> body about <b>which he is particular. And</b> likewise, they issued a decree against substances covering <b>the minority</b> of <b>his</b> body with regard to which he is <b>particular, due to</b> substances covering <b>the majority</b> of <b>his</b> body about which he is <b>particular.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But let them also issue a decree</b> prohibiting substances covering <b>the minority</b> of <b>his</b> body with regard to <b>which he is not particular, due to</b> substances covering <b>the minority</b> of <b>his</b> body about which he is <b>particular.</b> The Gemara answers: The Sages did not issue such a decree, as that prohibition <b>is itself</b> a rabbinic <b>decree, and will we arise and issue a decree to</b> prevent the violation of another <b>decree?</b>

### Part 4
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the issue of the correct time for immersion. <b>Rav says: A menstruating woman</b> who wishes to immerse to complete her purification process <b>at her time,</b> i.e., at the end of seven days, <b>may immerse only at night,</b> i.e., on the night after the seventh day, the night of the eighth day. <b>But</b> a woman who wishes to immerse <b>not at her time,</b> i.e., on the eighth day or afterward, <b>may immerse either during the day or at night. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Whether</b> she is immersing <b>at her time or not at her time,</b> she <b>may immerse only at night.</b> This is <b>because her daughter</b> might <b>follow</b> her example when she is old enough, and also immerse in the daytime, but she may do so on the seventh day, when immersion is not valid.

### Part 5
<b>And even Rav retracted</b> his opinion and ruled that a woman who is immersing after menstruation may never do so during the day. <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said: A menstruating woman</b> who wishes to immerse to complete her purification process, <b>whether at her time</b> or <b>whether not at her time, may immerse only at night, because her daughter</b> might <b>follow</b> her example and immerse during the daytime of the seventh day.

### Part 6
The Gemara cites examples of Sages who permitted immersion on the eighth day due to exceptional circumstances. <b>Rav Idi decreed in Neresh that</b> the women <b>may immerse</b> during the daytime <b>on the eighth day due to the lions</b> that roamed the area at night and posed a threat to women who immersed at that time. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov</b> decreed <b>in Pappunya</b> that the women should immerse during the daytime on the eighth day <b>due to thieves</b> who posed a threat to women who immersed at that night.

### Part 7
Similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda</b> decreed <b>in Pumbedita</b> that the women should immerse in the daytime on the eighth day <b>due to</b> the <b>cold</b> of the night. <b>Rava</b> decreed <b>in Meḥoza</b> that the women should immerse in the daytime on the eighth day <b>due to</b> the <b>gatekeepers [<i>abula’ei</i>],</b> who were untrustworthy and might hurt the women on their way to and from immersion.

### Part 8
§ <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava and to Abaye: Since nowadays the Sages have given</b> all women who menstruate the status of <b>an uncertain</b> greater <b><i>zava</i>, may they immerse on the seventh day</b> during the daytime? A greater <i>zava</i>, after counting seven clean days, may immerse on the seventh day. Since all women who menstruate now count seven clean days after the bleeding ceases, more than seven days from the onset of her menstruating have passed by the seventh clean day.

### Part 9
Rava and Abaye replied that they may nevertheless not immerse on the seventh day, <b>due to</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “But if she be purified of her <i>ziva</i>, then she shall count to herself seven days, <b>and after that she shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 15:28). The purification of a <i>zava</i> must be <b>after</b> the seven days, i.e., <b>after all of the</b> days, which must be consecutive so <b>that there are no</b> days of <b>impurity separating between</b> the seven clean days. <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that the phrase <b>“And after that she shall be pure”</b> teaches that <b>after the action</b> of counting seven clean days <b>she shall be pure.</b> In other words, once she has examined herself at the beginning of the seventh day she may immerse on that day.

### Part 10
Rabbi Shimon continues: <b>But the Sages said: It is prohibited to do so,</b> i.e., to immerse on the seventh day, <b>lest she come to</b> a case of <b>uncertainty.</b> If she were to engage in intercourse with her husband on that seventh day after immersion, and afterward on the same day she experiences bleeding, it would retroactively nullify her entire seven clean days, which would mean that she engaged in intercourse with her husband while she was impure, rendering them both liable to receive the punishment of <i>karet</i>.

### Part 11
§ <b>Rav Huna says: A woman may wash</b> her hair <b>on the first</b> day <b>of the week,</b> Sunday, <b>and immerse on the third</b> day <b>of the week,</b> i.e., Monday night. The proof of this is <b>that</b> sometimes <b>a woman washes</b> her hair <b>on the eve of Shabbat, but</b> she does not <b>immerse</b> until <b>the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> which is the same interval as from Sunday to Monday night.

### Part 12
Similarly, <b>a woman may wash</b> her hair <b>on the first</b> day <b>of the week,</b> Sunday, <b>and immerse on the fourth</b> day <b>of the week,</b> Tuesday night. The proof of this is <b>that</b> sometimes <b>a woman washes</b> her hair <b>on the eve of Shabbat, but</b> she does not <b>immerse</b> until <b>the conclusion of the Festival that occurs after Shabbat,</b> which is the same interval as from Sunday to Tuesday night.

### Part 13
Furthermore, <b>a woman may wash</b> her hair <b>on the first</b> day <b>of the week,</b> Sunday, <b>and immerse on the fifth</b> day <b>of the week,</b> Wednesday night. The proof of this is <b>that</b> sometimes <b>a woman washes</b> her hair <b>on the eve of Shabbat, but</b> she does not <b>immerse</b> until <b>the conclusion of two days of Rosh HaShana that occurs after Shabbat,</b> which is the same interval as from Sunday to Wednesday night.

### Part 14
<b>But Rav Ḥisda said: We say</b> that <b>all of these</b> long gaps between a woman washing her hair and immersing are permitted. But <b>we do not say</b> as proof <b>that</b> since a woman washes her hair before Shabbat and immerses only several days later, she may do so during a regular week as well. One cannot learn this <i>halakha</i> from those situations involving Shabbat, as one cannot derive cases where alternatives are possible from those cases where alternatives are not possible. <b>Where it is possible</b> for a woman to wash her hair and immerse immediately, <b>it is possible,</b> and she is not allowed to do so any earlier. But <b>where it is not possible</b> for a woman to wash her hair immediately before immersion, e.g., when she must immerse after the conclusion of Shabbat or a festival, <b>it is impossible,</b> and for this reason she is permitted to wash her hair in advance.

### Part 15
<b>And Rav Yeimar said: We even say</b> the proof <b>that</b> since a woman washes her hair before Shabbat and immerses only several days later, she may do so during a regular week as well. Rav Yeimar agrees with Rav Huna in all cases <b>apart from</b> that of <b>a woman who washes</b> her hair <b>on the first</b> day <b>of the week,</b> Sunday, <b>and immerses on the fifth</b> day <b>of the week,</b> Wednesday night. He maintains that Rav Huna’s proof <b>from the conclusion of two days of Rosh HaShana that is after Shabbat is not</b> a sufficient proof, <b>as</b> even in such a case a woman may not wait so long. Rather, <b>it is possible</b> for her <b>to wash</b> her hair <b>at night</b> after the conclusion of Rosh HaShana <b>and immerse</b> on <b>that</b> same <b>night,</b> so that she should not have such a long gap between washing her hair and immersing.

### Part 16
<b>Mareimar taught: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> that a woman should not wash her hair many days before immersing except when there is no other possibility. <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> is also <b>in accordance with</b> the manner in <b>which Rav Yeimar explains</b> that if Rosh HaShana occurs after Shabbat a woman should wash her hair on the night of her immersion.

### Part 17
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>a woman may wash</b> her hair <b>at night and immerse on</b> that same <b>night? Mar Zutra deems it prohibited</b> for her to do so. Since she will be in a hurry to immerse and return to her husband, there is a concern that she will not wash and examine her hair thoroughly. <b>And Rav Ḥinnana from Sura deems it permitted</b> for a woman to wash her hair on the night of her immersion.

### Part 18
<b>Rav Adda said to Rav Ḥinnana from Sura: Was</b> there <b>not an incident</b> like <b>this involving the wife of Abba Mari, the Exilarch, who quarreled</b> with her husband, and as a result she did not want to immerse in a ritual bath to become permitted to him; and <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak went to appease her</b> and to persuade her to immerse, <b>and she said to him: What is there</b> that can be done <b>now?</b> There is no reason for me to hurry and immerse now.
