### Part 1
<b>in a port [<i>banamal</i>],</b> where the boats are drawn up onto shore, as there is a lot of mud there, which can stick to her and interpose between her and the water. <b>Even though now,</b> after the immersion, <b>there is no</b> mud stuck to her feet or body, one can <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>while she walked</b> back after immersing the mud <b>fell</b> off. Since one cannot be certain that there was no mud stuck to her body while she immersed, she may not immerse in a port.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates that <b>Shmuel’s father prepared ritual baths for his daughters in the days of Nisan,</b> by digging holes and letting them fill with natural rainwater, <b>and</b> he placed <b>mats</b> in the Euphrates River <b>in the days of Tishrei.</b> Since the water was shallow and the riverbed was muddy, he placed mats on the riverbed so that they could immerse without getting dirty.

### Part 3
The Gemara cites a similar <i>halakha</i> involving the interposition of an item during immersion. <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If a woman <b>gave a cooked</b> dish <b>to her son, and</b> afterward she <b>immersed</b> in a ritual bath <b>and ascended</b> from the ritual bath, the <b>immersion is ineffective for her.</b> The reason is that <b>even though now,</b> after the immersion, <b>there is no</b> food stuck to her body, one can <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>as she walked</b> back after immersing the food <b>fell</b> off. Since one cannot be certain that there was no food stuck to her body while she immersed, she should not handle food immediately before immersing.

### Part 4
<b>Rami bar Abba said:</b> With regard to <b>these bloodletting incisions [<i>ravdei dekhusilta</i>], until three days</b> have passed since the bloodletting, when they have not yet formed a hard scab, they do <b>not interpose</b> and invalidate an immersion. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward they interpose,</b> as the scab is too hard for the water to penetrate.

### Part 5
<b>Mar Ukva said:</b> With regard to <b>mucus that is in the eye,</b> if it is <b>moist, it does not interpose</b> and invalidate an immersion. But if the mucus is <b>dry</b> and hard <b>it interposes. When is it called dry?</b> It is called dry <b>from the time that it begins to turn yellow.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Shmuel says: Eye shadow that is in the eye does not interpose</b> and invalidate an immersion. <b>But</b> eye shadow <b>that is on</b> or around <b>the eye interposes.</b> And <b>if</b> the woman’s <b>eyes were</b> constantly <b>blinking,</b> then <b>even</b> eye shadow <b>that is on</b> or around <b>the eye does not interpose,</b> as the constant blinking removes the eye shadow.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If a woman <b>opened her eyes very</b> wide <b>or closed her eyes very</b> tightly while immersing, this <b>immersion is ineffective for her.</b> Such open or closed eyelids prevent the water from reaching the creases around the eyes.

### Part 8
<b>Reish Lakish says: A woman may immerse</b> herself in a ritual bath <b>only in the manner that she grows,</b> i.e., she may not force her arms to her sides or close her legs tightly. She is not obligated to spread her limbs widely, but simply stand in her normal manner. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 2:4): When <b>a man</b> has a leprous mark between his legs and stands before a priest for inspection, he should <b>appear like</b> one who is <b>hoeing,</b> i.e., with his legs slightly apart, <b>and</b> if it is under his arm, he should appear like one who is <b>harvesting olives,</b> with his arms slightly raised. If the mark is not visible when he is standing in that manner, it is not impure. By contrast, <b>a woman</b> with a leprous mark between her legs should <b>appear like</b> one who is <b>weaving, and</b> if the mark is beneath her breast she should appear <b>like</b> a woman who is <b>nursing her son.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says: A single hair tied</b> in a knot <b>interposes</b> and invalidates an immersion.
