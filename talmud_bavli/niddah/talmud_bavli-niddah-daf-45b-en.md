<b>When he reaches majority he may engage in intercourse with her,</b> and thereby acquire her as his full-fledged wife, <b>and</b> if he wished to divorce her <b>he</b> can then <b>give her a bill of divorce</b> without having to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to a girl who is <b>eleven years and one day old, her vows are examined</b> to ascertain whether she is aware of the meaning of her vow and in Whose name she vowed. Once she is <b>twelve years and one day old</b> and has grown two pubic hairs, which is a sign of adulthood, even without examination <b>her vows are in effect. And one examines</b> her vows throughout <b>the entire twelfth</b> year until her twelfth birthday.

### Part 3
With regard to a boy who is <b>twelve years and one day old, his vows are examined</b> to ascertain whether he is aware of the meaning of his vow and in Whose name he vowed. Once he is <b>thirteen years and one day old</b> and has grown two pubic hairs, even without examination <b>his vows are in effect. And one examines</b> his vows throughout <b>the entire thirteenth</b> year until his thirteenth birthday.

### Part 4
<b>Prior to that time,</b> eleven years and one day for a girl and twelve years and one day for a boy, <b>even if they said: We know in Whose name we vowed</b> and <b>in Whose name we consecrated, their vow is not</b> a valid <b>vow and their consecration is not</b> a valid <b>consecration. After that time,</b> twelve years and one day for a girl and thirteen years and one day for a boy, <b>even if they said: We do not know in Whose name we vowed</b> and <b>in Whose name we consecrated, their vow is</b> a valid <b>vow and their consecration is</b> a valid <b>consecration.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>But since</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> With regard to a girl who is <b>eleven years and one day old her vows are examined, why do I</b> need the mishna to further state: Once she is <b>twelve years and one day old her vows are in effect?</b> After all, by this stage she is already an adult. The Gemara answers that this ruling is necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>one examines</b> her vows <b>forever,</b> even when she is an adult. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the vows of an adult are valid even without examination.

### Part 6
The Gemara further asks: <b>And since</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> Once she is <b>twelve years and one day old her vows are in effect, why do I</b> need it to further state: <b>One examines</b> her vows throughout <b>the entire twelfth</b> year? The Gemara answers that this ruling is necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since the Master says</b> that <b>thirty days in a year are considered</b> equivalent to <b>a year,</b> in a case <b>where we examine her</b> for <b>thirty</b> days after she turned eleven <b>and she did not know</b> how <b>to utter</b> a vow <b>properly,</b> i.e., she did not have a clear understanding of the meaning of the vow, one might <b>say</b> that <b>one should examine</b> her <b>no further</b> until she reaches the age of twelve. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that she is examined throughout her twelfth year.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> only <b>these two clauses:</b> Once she is <b>twelve years and one day old her vows are in effect, and one examines</b> her vows throughout <b>the entire twelfth</b> year. Once both of these have been taught, <b>why do I</b> need the ruling: With regard to a girl who is <b>eleven years and one day old, her vows are examined?</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara answers that this clause <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say:</b> In <b>an ordinary</b> case, a girl <b>requires examination in</b> her <b>twelfth</b> year, whereas <b>in</b> her <b>eleventh</b> year she <b>does not require examination. But</b> in a case <b>where we discern about her that she</b> has <b>a very sharp</b> mind, perhaps <b>she should be examined</b> already <b>in</b> her <b>eleventh</b> year. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that she is not examined in her eleventh year irrespective of how intelligent she is, as she is too young.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna to teach that <b>prior to that time</b> their vows and consecration are always not valid <b>and after that time</b> they are always valid? These <i>halakhot</i> can be inferred from the previous statements of the mishna. The Gemara answers that these rulings are necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say: These matters</b> apply only in a case <b>where they do not say:</b> We know in Whose name we vowed, when they are younger than the periods mentioned in the mishna, or: We do not know in Whose name we vowed, when they are older. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where they do say</b> such statements, perhaps <b>we rely on their</b> claim. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that when they are younger than the periods stated in the mishna their vows are never valid, and when they are older, their vows are always valid.

### Part 10
§ The mishna indicates that the intellectual development of a girl is faster than that of a boy. In this regard, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>This</b> opinion, with regard to the periods of vows for girls and boys, is in accordance with <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. But <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says</b> the opposite, that the <b>matter stated</b> here <b>with regard to a girl is</b> actually <b>stated with regard to a boy,</b> whereas the <b>matter stated with regard to a boy is</b> in fact <b>stated with regard to a girl,</b> as the intellectual development of males is faster than that of females.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: What is the reason of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>As it is written,</b> with regard to the creation of woman: <b>“And the rib,</b> which <b>the Lord God</b> had taken from the man, <b>He made [<i>vayyiven</i>]</b> a woman, and brought her to the man” (Genesis 2:22). This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, granted a woman a greater understanding [<i>bina</i>] than</b> that <b>of a men.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, derive from this verse? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires that</b> verse <b>for that which Reish Lakish</b> taught, <b>as Reish Lakish said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from the man, He made a woman, and brought her to the man.”</b> This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, braided</b> the hair of <b>Eve, and</b> then <b>brought her to Adam the first</b> man. <b>As in the cities overseas [<i>bikhrakei hayyam</i>] they call braiding</b> hair, <b>building [<i>benayita</i>].</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, what is the reason</b> that he maintains that the intellectual development of males is faster than that of females? <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: Since a boy frequents his teacher’s house, cleverness enters his</b> mind <b>first.</b>

### Part 14
§ The mishna teaches that there are three periods in the development of girls and boys: When their vows are examined, i.e., the twelfth year for a girl and the thirteenth year for a boy, which will be termed below: During the time; the period beforehand, when their vows are entirely invalid, called: Before the time; and after that period, when their vows are always valid, known as: After the time. But the mishna does not address the issue of their physical development during these periods, with regard to the appearance of two pubic hairs. In this regard, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a boy or girl developed pubic hairs <b>during</b> the <b>time,</b> is this year considered <b>like</b> the development of signs indicating puberty <b>before</b> the <b>time</b> that the child reaches majority, and therefore they are not treated as signs indicating puberty, <b>or</b> is it considered <b>as after</b> the <b>time?</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this dilemma raised? <b>If</b> it is <b>with regard to vows,</b> the development of pubic hairs <b>is not considered as before</b> the <b>time, but</b> it <b>is not considered as after</b> the <b>time</b> either. Instead, the status of the vow is determined in accordance with the examination of the child’s understanding, as stated in the mishna.

### Part 16
<b>Rather,</b> the dilemma is raised <b>with regard to punishments,</b> i.e., whether such a boy or girl is punished like an adult for violating the prohibitions of the Torah. <b>What,</b> then, is the <i>halakha</i>? The Sages disagree. <b>Rav and Rabbi Ḥanina both say:</b> The development of pubic hairs <b>during</b> that <b>time</b> is considered <b>as before</b> the <b>time,</b> and therefore the boy or girl is not liable to receive punishment for his or her actions. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi both say:</b> The development of pubic hairs <b>during</b> that <b>time</b> is considered <b>as after</b> the <b>time,</b> and they are punished.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: And your mnemonic,</b> to remember which Sages said which ruling, is the verse: <b>“Now this [<i>vezot</i>] was the custom in former times in Israel”</b> (Ruth 4:7). The Sage whose name has a feminine form like the word <i>vezot</i>, namely, Rav Ḥanina, maintains that the development of pubic hairs during the time is considered as before the time, like the former times mentioned in the verse.

### Part 18
<b>Rav Hamnuna raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi from the mishna: <b>After that time,</b> twelve years and one day for a girl and thirteen years and one day for a boy, <b>even if they say: We do not know in Whose name we vowed</b> and <b>in Whose name we consecrated, their vow is</b> a valid <b>vow and their consecration is</b> a valid <b>consecration.</b> Rav Hamnuna infers from this ruling that if they issued this statement <b>during</b> the <b>time,</b> it is considered <b>as before</b> the <b>time,</b> even if they had developed two hairs.

### Part 19
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Hamnuna, in rejection of this proof: <b>Say the former clause</b> in the mishna: <b>Prior to that time,</b> eleven years and one day for a girl and twelve years and one day for a boy, <b>even if they said: We know in Whose name we vowed</b> and <b>in Whose name we consecrated, their vow is not</b> a valid <b>vow and their consecration is not</b> a valid <b>consecration.</b> One can infer the opposite from here, that if they issued this statement <b>during</b> the <b>time,</b> it is considered <b>as after</b> the <b>time.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara responds: <b>And</b> that <b>is not so,</b> as <b>Rava erred. He thought</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna inferred from the superfluous</b> statement of the <b>mishna,</b> i.e., that the clause Rav Hamnuna cites is unnecessary for the <i>halakha</i> it states, which is why Rav Hamnuna inferred his conclusion from it. <b>And</b> therefore Rava responded that <b>rather than inferring from the latter clause</b> of the mishna that if the boy or girl claims not to know in Whose name he or she vowed during the time, it is considered as before the time, <b>let him infer from the former clause</b> that it is considered as after the time, as Rava demonstrated.

### Part 21
The Gemara continues: <b>But it is not so;</b> rather, <b>Rav Hamnuna inferred</b> that it is considered as before the time <b>from the</b> statement of <b>the mishna itself,</b> without assuming that it is superfluous, as follows: In <b>that</b> mention in the mishna of: <b>After</b> that <b>time, what are the circumstances? If</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the boy <b>has not</b> yet <b>developed two</b> pubic <b>hairs, he is a minor. Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the boy <b>has developed two</b> pubic <b>hairs,</b>
