### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if she <b>then sees</b> menstrual blood <b>at</b> regular intervals of thirty-day <b>cycles?</b> Is her time sufficient, or does she transmit impurity retroactively? <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to the <b>first time and</b> the <b>second</b> time that she sees menstrual blood, <b>her time is sufficient.</b> After the <b>third</b> time, <b>she transmits impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period or from examination to examination.</b>

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> further teaches, with regard to a young girl who did not experience bleeding for three typical cycles and then saw blood, <b>and three further</b> expected menstrual <b>cycles passed</b> without her experiencing bleeding <b>and</b> then afterward <b>she saw</b> menstrual <b>blood,</b> that <b>her time is sufficient.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if she <b>then sees</b> menstrual blood <b>at</b> regular intervals of thirty-day <b>cycles?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Kahana says</b> that <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b>first time</b> that she sees menstrual blood, <b>her time is sufficient.</b> After the <b>second</b> time, <b>she transmits impurity</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period or from examination to examination.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>? The Gemara answers: Since the <i>baraita</i> teaches that she attains the status of a regular adult woman upon the third sighting of menstrual blood, apparently it is <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said</b> that <b>presumption is</b> established <b>by two occasions.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Say the latter clause:</b> If she then <b>passed three</b> expected menstrual <b>cycles</b> without experiencing bleeding, <b>and</b> then <b>she saw</b> menstrual blood, she returns to the status of a young girl and <b>her time is sufficient.</b> In this ruling <b>we come to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who holds that any woman who passed three expected menstrual cycles without experiencing bleeding is presumed not to be menstruating and her time is sufficient. Is the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi or Rabbi Eliezer?

### Part 6
<b>And if you would say</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and in</b> the case of a woman who passes three menstrual <b>cycles</b> without experiencing bleeding, he <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, but does he</b> really <b>hold</b> in accordance with <b>this</b> opinion? Doesn’t the <i>baraita</i> <b>state</b> that <b>after</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>remembered</b> that several authorities disagreed with the ruling of Rabbi Eliezer, he said: Rabbi Eliezer is worthy to rely upon in exigent circumstances, i.e., only in exigent circumstances. The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is Rabbi Eliezer, and with regard to</b> menstrual <b>cycles</b> he <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi,</b> that a presumptive cycle is established after two occasions of seeing menstrual blood.

### Part 7
§ With regard to a young girl who was just starting to menstruate, the Gemara states: If she finds a blood <b>stain between</b> the <b>first</b> and <b>second</b> time that she sees menstrual blood, she is <b>pure.</b> If it is <b>between</b> the <b>second and</b> the <b>third</b> time, <b>Ḥizkiyya says:</b> She is <b>impure; Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> She is <b>pure.</b> The Gemara explains the reasoning behind their respective opinions. <b>Ḥizkiyya says:</b> She is <b>impure, since if she had seen</b> menstrual blood it would <b>render her impure.</b> Consequently, her blood <b>stain is also impure. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> She is <b>pure, since she has not</b> yet attained the <b>presumptive status of</b> one who sees menstrual <b>blood.</b> Therefore, <b>we also do not render her impure</b> on account of <b>her</b> blood <b>stain.</b>
