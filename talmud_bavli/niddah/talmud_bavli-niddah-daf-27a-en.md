the <b>stringency of two offspring, as I say: Perhaps</b> the <b>gestational sac of</b> this <b>afterbirth,</b> which contained the offspring, <b>disintegrated, and</b> the <b>afterbirth of</b> the <b>gestational sac</b> containing the fetus shaped like an animal also <b>disintegrated.</b> If so, there are two offspring, and as it is possible that one is male and the other female, the mother must observe the strictures of one who gave birth to both a male and a female. In any event, this <i>baraita</i> is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s claim that it is impossible for an afterbirth to be tied to a fetus that has the form of a bird.

### Part 2
§ <b>Rabba bar Sheila says</b> that <b>Rav Mattana says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: An incident</b> occurred where the Sages <b>attributed the afterbirth</b> that a woman discharged <b>to an offspring</b> that was born <b>up to ten days</b> beforehand. <b>And</b> Shmuel added that the Sages <b>said</b> that one <b>attributes</b> an afterbirth to an offspring that was born <b>only</b> in the case <b>of an afterbirth that emerges after the offspring</b> is born. By contrast, an afterbirth that emerges before the offspring is born is not attributed to that offspring.

### Part 3
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> There was <b>an incident</b> where the Sages <b>attributed the afterbirth to an offspring</b> that was born <b>up to twenty-three days</b> beforehand. <b>Rav Yosef said to him</b> a correction of his statement: <b>You said to us</b> on another occasion that the offspring was born <b>up to twenty-four</b> days beforehand.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avira, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> There was <b>an incident</b> where a woman was pregnant with twins, <b>and</b> one <b>offspring remained</b> in the womb for <b>thirty-three days after the other</b> offspring was born. <b>Rav Yosef said to him: You said to us</b> on another occasion that the second offspring was born <b>thirty-four</b> days after the first.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that if a woman <b>gives birth</b> to a baby <b>in</b> her <b>ninth</b> month, <b>she can give birth prematurely</b> (see <i>Rosh HaShana</i> 11a). <b>You find</b> a situation where there could be such a difference between the births of the two twins if <b>the form of one</b> of the twin fetuses <b>was completed at the end of the seventh</b> month, and it is born at that stage, <b>and the form of</b> the other <b>one was completed at the beginning of the ninth</b> month, and it is born then. In such a case, there can be a difference of thirty-four days between the births. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that a woman who <b>gives birth</b> to a baby <b>in</b> her <b>ninth</b> month <b>cannot give birth prematurely,</b> but rather she gives birth at the end of the ninth month, <b>what is there to say?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara answers that one should <b>reverse the statements:</b> The difference of <b>thirty-three</b> days was stated <b>with regard to</b> a case of <b>an afterbirth</b> that was discharged an extended period after the birth of the offspring, whereas the gap of <b>twenty-three</b> days was stated <b>with regard to</b> a case of an <b>offspring</b> that was born after its twin.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Avin bar Rav Adda says</b> that <b>Rav Menaḥem of the village of She’arim, and some say</b> that he was from <b>Beit She’arim, says: An incident</b> occurred where <b>one offspring remained</b> in the womb <b>after the other</b> was born for <b>three months, and</b> both twins <b>are sitting before us in the study hall. And who are they?</b> They are <b>Yehuda and Ḥizkiyya, the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t the Master say</b> that <b>a woman cannot become pregnant and again become pregnant</b> with another offspring while she is pregnant with the first? <b>Abaye says:</b> Both twins were conceived at the same time; <b>it was one drop</b> of semen <b>and it split into two. The form of one was completed at the beginning of the seventh</b> month, <b>and</b> the form of the other <b>one</b> was completed <b>at the end of the ninth</b> month.

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches that if there is <b>an afterbirth in the house, the house is impure</b> in the sense that everything under the roof contracts impurity imparted by a corpse. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there is <b>an afterbirth in the house, the house is impure.</b> The reason is <b>not that the</b> status of <b>an afterbirth</b> is that of <b>an offspring; rather,</b> it is <b>that there is no afterbirth without an offspring,</b> and the offspring rendered the contents of the house impure. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon deem</b> the contents of the house <b>pure.</b>

### Part 10
These Sages <b>said to Rabbi Meir: Do you not concede that if</b> people <b>removed</b> the afterbirth <b>to the outer room</b> of the house <b>in a basin, that</b> the room <b>is pure?</b> Rabbi Meir <b>said to them</b> in response: <b>Indeed,</b> that room is pure; <b>but why</b> so? <b>Because</b> the offspring <b>does not exist</b> anymore, i.e., it presumably disintegrated while it was moved from place to place.

### Part 11
These Sages <b>said to him: Just as</b> the offspring <b>does not exist</b> when the afterbirth is moved <b>to the outer room, so too, it does not exist</b> when the afterbirth is <b>in the inner room</b> either. In other words, the offspring presumably disintegrated while it was moved from the woman’s womb to the place in the house where it is located. Rabbi Meir <b>said to them:</b> A situation in which the offspring <b>disintegrated once,</b> when the afterbirth was moved to its first location in the house, <b>is not comparable to</b> a case where the offspring <b>disintegrated twice,</b> i.e., when the afterbirth was first moved to the interior room of the house and then moved to the outer room.

### Part 12
§ <b>Rav Pappa sat behind Rav Beivai</b> in the study hall <b>before</b> their teacher <b>Rav Hamnuna, and he sat and said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon,</b> that a house in which there is an afterbirth is pure? <b>He holds</b> that with regard to <b>any</b> item that has <b>ritual impurity with which</b> there <b>was mixed</b> an item <b>of another type,</b> it <b>is nullified</b> by the other item and is pure. Consequently, in the case of an offspring that disintegrated, the disintegrated offspring is nullified by the blood of the childbirth.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Pappa said to</b> Rav Beivai, who was a greater scholar than he, and to Rav Hamnuna his teacher: <b>This is also the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei,</b> who agree with Rabbi Shimon in the above <i>baraita</i>. Rav Beivai and Rav Hamnuna <b>laughed at him: What is different</b> about the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei? Since the statement of Rabbi Shimon is attributed to them as well, it is <b>obvious</b> that their reasoning is the same.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> with regard to this incident: <b>A person should say a matter even</b> as obvious <b>as this</b> one, <b>and one should not be silent in the presence of his teacher,</b> despite the possibility that other people might laugh at him, <b>because it is stated: “If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you have planned devices [<i>zammota</i>], lay your hand over your mouth”</b> (Proverbs 30:32). One who acts “foolishly” over matters of Torah by not hesitating to issue statements that might be ridiculed will ultimately be exalted and lifted up. Conversely, one who muzzles [<i>zamam</i>] himself due to embarrassment will end up with his hand over his mouth, unable to answer questions that are posed to him.

### Part 15
With regard to Rabbi Shimon’s opinion that the woman is pure because the offspring is nullified by the blood of childbirth, the Gemara notes: <b>And Rabbi Shimon follows his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a ladleful [<i>melo tarvad</i>] of dust</b> from a corpse, which is the minimum amount that renders everything in a house impure, <b>into which any amount of dirt fell,</b> the house is <b>impure; and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>pure.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon?</b> Why is the house pure when it contains a ladleful of dust from a corpse? <b>Rabba said: I found the Sages of the study hall of Rav sitting and saying:</b> The reason Rabbi Shimon deems the house pure is that <b>it is impossible for</b> there <b>not to be two grains of dirt</b> that are <b>more than one grain of dust</b> from the corpse, in a certain place in the mixture. <b>And</b> as that grain of dust from the corpse is nullified by the dirt, the amount of dust that remains <b>is insufficient</b> for rendering the house impure.

### Part 17
<b>And I said to them: On the contrary,</b> according to this reasoning the house should certainly be impure, as <b>it is impossible for</b> there <b>not to be two grains of dust</b> from the corpse that are <b>more than</b>
