<b>Cimolian earth [<i>kamonya</i>], and potash [<i>eshlag</i>].</b>

### Part 2
If <b>one immersed</b> the garment with the stain whose nature is unknown <b>and</b> then <b>handled ritually pure items with</b> the garment, and then <b>applied</b> these <b>seven substances to</b> the stain <b>and it did not disappear, that</b> stain <b>is</b> presumably from <b>a dye, and</b> therefore <b>the ritually pure items are pure, and he need not immerse</b> the garment again, as there is no impurity. If the stain <b>disappeared or if it faded, that is</b> a blood <b>stain, and the ritually pure items</b> that he handled <b>are impure, and he must immerse</b> the garment again.

### Part 3
<b>What is tasteless saliva?</b> It is saliva that emerges from the mouth of <b>any</b> person <b>who tasted nothing</b> all night, when he first awakens in the morning. <b>Liquid from split beans</b> is created through <b>the chewing of split beans</b> that <b>divided naturally,</b> not by human hand, which is then applied to the stain. The <b>urine</b> that is an effective detergent is specifically urine <b>that fermented</b> for three days.

### Part 4
<b>And one must rub each and every one</b> of the substances <b>three times</b> over the stain, and one must apply them separately, and one must apply them in the order they are listed in the mishna. If <b>one applied them</b> in a manner that is <b>not in their</b> prescribed <b>order, or if one applied</b> all <b>seven substances simultaneously, he has done nothing.</b> One cannot determine by means of that examination whether it is blood or a dye.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies the identities of the seven substances that remove blood stains. With regard to natron, a Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: This is referring to <b>Alexandrian natron,</b> i.e., from the city in Egypt, <b>and not natron from Anpantrin,</b> which is of a different quality.

### Part 6
The mishna lists <b><i>borit</i></b> as one of the seven substances. <b>Rav Yehuda says: This</b> is referring to <b>ice plant.</b> The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Borit</i> and ice plant,</b> which indicates that they are two different substances? <b>Rather, what is <i>borit</i>? Sulfur.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the <i>baraita</i> discussing the <i>halakha</i> of plants whose use is prohibited during the Sabbatical Year: <b>They added to</b> the list of such plants: Bulbs of <b>ornithogalum, and wormwood,</b> and <b><i>borit</i>, and ice plant. And if it would enter your mind</b> to say that <i>borit</i> is <b>sulfur, is there sulfur</b> that is subject to the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of the Sabbatical Year? But didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>this is the principle: Anything that has a root</b> and grows <b>is</b> subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the Sabbatical Year, and</b> anything <b>that does not have a root is not</b> subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the Sabbatical Year? Rather, what</b> is <b><i>borit</i>?</b> It is <b>ice plant. But isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: And <b><i>borit</i> and ice plant?</b> The Gemara explains that there are <b>two types</b> of <b>ice plant,</b> one of which is called <i>borit</i>.

### Part 8
With regard to the <b>Cimolian earth</b> mentioned in the mishna, <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> This is the earth referred to as: <b>Pull out, stick in. And</b> with regard to the <b><i>eshlag</i></b> mentioned in the mishna, <b>Shmuel said: I asked</b> all of <b>the seafarers</b> about the identity of <i>eshlag</i>, <b>and they told me it is called <i>ashlega</i>,</b> in Aramaic, <b>and can be found in the shell of the pearl, and is removed with an iron skewer.</b>

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>one immersed</b> the garment with the stain whose nature is unknown <b>and</b> then <b>handled</b> ritually pure items with the garment, and then applied these seven substances to the stain and it did not disappear, that stain is a dye, and therefore the ritually pure items are pure, and he need not immerse the garment again, as there is no impurity. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one applied these seven substances to</b> the stain <b>and it did not disappear,</b> but he then applied <b>soap [<i>tzafon</i>] and it disappeared,</b> any <b>ritually pure</b> items that he handled with the garment <b>are impure.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara raises an objection with regard to this ruling: But <b>soap causes dye to disappear as well;</b> why then should one assume that the stain was blood? <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that if <b>one applied</b> only <b>six of the</b> seven <b>substances to it and</b> the stain <b>did not disappear,</b> and he then <b>applied soap to</b> the stain <b>and it disappeared,</b> any <b>ritually pure</b> items that he handled with the garment <b>are impure.</b> The reason is <b>that if he had applied</b> all <b>seven</b> substances <b>initially, perhaps</b> the stain would have <b>disappeared,</b> proving that it was blood. Consequently, the garment is rendered impure due to uncertainty.

### Part 11
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one applied</b> the <b>seven substances to</b> the stain <b>and it did not disappear,</b> indicating that it is a dye, and he then <b>repeated</b> and applied the seven substances a second time <b>and</b> the stain <b>disappeared,</b> any <b>ritually pure</b> items that he handled with the garment remain <b>ritually pure.</b>

### Part 12
In explanation of this <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Zeira says: They taught</b> that the pure items remain pure <b>only</b> with regard to <b>the ritually pure</b> items <b>that were handled between</b> the <b>first washing</b> with the seven substances <b>and the second</b> washing. <b>But</b> with regard to any <b>pure</b> items <b>that were handled</b> with the garment <b>after</b> the <b>second washing,</b> these <b>pure</b> items become <b>impure, as he was particular about it,</b> i.e., by repeating the washing procedure he showed he was concerned that it might be blood, <b>and</b> the stain <b>disappeared,</b> demonstrating that it was in fact blood.
