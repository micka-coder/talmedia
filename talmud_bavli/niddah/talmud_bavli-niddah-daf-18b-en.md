<b>and she miscarried</b> her fetus into the river, but she does not know whether or not the fetus was fully formed, <b>she brings</b> the <b>offering</b> of a woman after childbirth, i.e., a burnt offering and a sin offering. <b>And</b> the sin offering, which is a bird, <b>is eaten</b> after the nape of its neck has been severed, in the manner of a regular bird sin offering. This is the <i>halakha</i> despite the uncertainty, i.e., this fetus might not have been fully formed, in which case the woman is not obligated to bring this offering, and a bird that is not an offering may not be eaten if its nape was severed.

### Part 2
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi explains the reasoning behind this ruling: One must <b>follow the majority of</b> pregnant <b>women, and most</b> pregnant <b>women give birth to full-fledged offspring.</b> If so, this is another case involving an uncertainty where the Sages established the <i>halakha</i> as a certainty based on the majority. Furthermore, this case involves the ritual impurity of a woman. Why then did Rabbi Yoḥanan list only three cases of this kind?

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>We say</b> that only cases taught in <b>the Mishna</b> or a <i>baraita</i> are included in this list, whereas <b>we do not say</b> that those derived from an amoraic <b>halakhic statement,</b> e.g., the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, are included.

### Part 4
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this explanation: <b>But when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Ḥanina raises an objection</b> against the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi from a <i>baraita</i> that deals with <b>an unsure woman,</b> i.e., one who does not know when she gave birth. Ravin added: <b>And I do not know what his objection</b> was from that <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 5
The Gemara discusses Ravin’s statement: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that Ravin meant that this <i>baraita</i> is <b>not a refutation</b> of the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>but</b> actually provides <b>support</b> for that opinion? If so, that would mean that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s opinion is effectively taught in a <i>baraita</i> as well, and therefore according to the above consideration Rabbi Yoḥanan should have included it in his list.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not</b> necessarily the correct inference, as <b>perhaps</b> Ravin meant simply that the ruling of this <i>baraita</i> is <b>neither a refutation nor a support</b> for the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi.

### Part 7
§ When Rabbi Yoḥanan says that in three places where there is uncertainty the Sages followed the majority and established the <i>halakha</i> as though it involved a certainty, he is clearly indicating that some cases are excluded from this category. The Gemara asks: Rabbi Yoḥanan says this <b>to exclude what?</b>

### Part 8
<b>If we say</b> that he says this <b>to exclude</b> an uncertain case where on the one hand there is <b>a majority that</b> indicates the woman should be deemed ritually impure and on the other hand <b>there is a presumptive status along with it</b> that opposes that majority, <b>which</b> is why the uncertainty is not treated as a certainty, and therefore <b>one does not burn <i>teruma</i> due to</b> contact with that impurity, this cannot be the case. The reason is that Rabbi Yoḥanan already <b>said it</b> on <b>another occasion,</b> with regard to other cases of ritual impurity, that if the consideration of a majority indicates that an item should be impure while its presumptive status indicates that it should be pure, it is not considered definitely impure.

### Part 9
The Gemara cites the source for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion in this regard. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 3:8): If a ritually impure <b>child is found alongside</b> ritually pure <b>started dough</b> that has not yet risen, <b>and</b> he has <b>risen dough in his hand</b> that may have been removed from the larger portion of started dough, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> the started dough <b>pure,</b> since there is no proof the child touched it, as he might have been given the piece by someone else. <b>And the Rabbis deem it impure,</b> as they assume that he touched the started dough. The child is presumed to be impure, <b>because it is the norm of a child to handle</b> items.

### Part 10
<b>And we say</b> with regard to this dispute: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir? He holds</b> that <b>a majority of children handle</b> items that are within reach, in this case the dough, <b>and a minority do not handle</b> items within reach, <b>and this dough retains a presumptive status of purity,</b> since its impurity has not been definitively determined. Therefore, one should <b>append</b> the fact that the <b>minority</b> of children do not handle items within reach <b>to the presumptive status</b> of purity of the dough, <b>and</b> the force of the <b>majority</b> of children who handle items within reach <b>is weakened.</b> Therefore, the dough is considered pure.

### Part 11
<b>And the Rabbis</b> contend that in a case where the majority is followed, <b>the minority is considered like it does not exist. And</b> consequently, there is a conflict between the determining factors of <b>the majority</b> of impure children who handle items within reach <b>and the presumptive status</b> of purity of the dough. Therefore, <b>the majority takes precedence.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And Reish Lakish says in the name of Rabbi Oshaya: This</b> <i>halakha</i> of a child <b>is</b> an example of <b>a presumption,</b> that children handle items within reach, <b>over which <i>teruma</i> is burned,</b> as the Rabbis hold that it is sufficiently certain that the dough has become impure to allow it to be burned. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is not a presumption over which <i>teruma</i> is burned.</b> Rather, the dough is left aside, and can be neither eaten nor burned, due to the uncertainty whether it is impure. In this context, Rabbi Yoḥanan has already stated that when a majority is contradicted by a presumption, the status of uncertainty applies. Therefore, there was no need for him to specify the three cases he mentioned in order to exclude situations of this kind.

### Part 13
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that there are only three cases in which uncertainty is treated as certainty is meant <b>to exclude</b> a specific situation involving <b>a majority, as</b> discussed by <b>Rabbi Yehuda. As we learned</b> in a mishna (21a): In the case of a woman <b>who miscarries</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of flesh, <b>if there is blood</b> that emerges <b>with it,</b> the woman <b>is ritually impure</b> with the impurity of a menstruating woman. <b>And if not, she is pure,</b> as she is neither a menstruating woman nor a woman after childbirth. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In <b>both this</b> case, where blood emerged, <b>and that</b> case, where no blood emerged, the woman <b>is impure</b> with the impurity of a menstruating woman, as there was certainly undetected blood that emerged with the flesh.

### Part 14
<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Rabbi Yehuda deemed</b> the woman <b>impure,</b> despite the fact that no blood emerged, <b>only in</b> the case of <b>a piece</b> of flesh that has the color <b>of</b> one of the <b>four types of</b> ritually impure <b>blood,</b> as stated in the mishna below (19a). <b>But</b> if it has the color <b>of other types of blood,</b> the woman is <b>pure. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If a woman miscarries a piece of flesh that has the color <b>of</b> one of the <b>four types of</b> ritually impure <b>blood, all,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, <b>agree</b> that she <b>is impure. And</b> likewise, if the piece has the color <b>of other types of blood, all agree</b> that <b>she is pure.</b> The Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree only</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> the woman <b>miscarried</b> an amorphous piece of flesh,
