### Part 1
<b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the case of blood that is found in <b>a piece</b> of tissue. One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, who follows the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is the manner of a woman to see</b> menstrual <b>blood in a piece</b> of tissue that she discharges. Therefore, the term “in her flesh” applies to the blood in the cracks. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is not the manner of a woman to see</b> menstrual <b>blood in a piece</b> of tissue that she discharges. Therefore, the blood found in the piece of tissue is not considered menstrual blood, and it does not render the woman impure.

### Part 2
<b>Rava says</b> there is another explanation of this dispute: <b>Everyone,</b> both the first <i>tanna</i> and the Rabbis, agrees that <b>it is not the manner of a woman to see</b> menstrual <b>blood in a piece</b> of tissue that she discharges. Consequently, the blood that emerges from the cracks in the piece of tissue is not considered menstrual blood, and it does not render the woman impure.

### Part 3
<b>And here, they disagree</b> as <b>to</b> whether it is possible that the <b>woman</b> herself is <b>pure but the location of the source,</b> i.e., the uterus, <b>is impure. As Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that the <b>woman is pure,</b> i.e., she was not rendered a menstruating woman with the discharge of the blood, <b>but the blood is impure,</b> despite the fact that it emerged in a piece of tissue, <b>as it emerged through the source,</b> which is impure. Therefore, when the blood comes into contact with the woman’s body she contracts first-degree impurity, and the woman subsequently transmits impurity to foods that she touches. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that the <b>woman is</b> entirely <b>pure, and the location of the source is</b> also <b>pure.</b> Therefore, pure food that she touches is not rendered impure.

### Part 4
§ <b>Rabba asked Rav Huna</b> a similar question to the case of the tube: With regard to a man <b>who sees semen</b> by extracting it from his penis <b>with a sliver of wood, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does he assume the impurity status of one who experiences a seminal emission? The Gemara explains the question. The verse states: “A man from whom the flow of semen emerges” (Leviticus 22:4). Since <b>the Merciful One states: “From whom,”</b> is it derived that the man is not impure <b>unless</b> the semen <b>emerges from his flesh</b> by itself, <b>and not</b> when it is extracted <b>with a sliver of wood? Or perhaps</b> from <b>this</b> term: <b>“From whom,”</b> it is derived merely that the man is not impure <b>unless his impurity,</b> i.e., his semen, <b>emerges outside</b> his body, <b>but</b> he is impure <b>even</b> if this is achieved <b>with a sliver of wood.</b>

### Part 5
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabba: <b>Derive</b> that the man is pure from the fact <b>that</b> semen <b>itself becomes impure only in</b> a case where the discharge is substantial enough to cause <b>a blockage of the tip of the penis.</b> Since this amount cannot be extracted with a sliver of wood, it is not impure.

### Part 6
Rabba replied to Rav Huna: Since a minimum measure is required for this impurity, <b>is this to say that</b> the reason a man who experiences a seminal emission is impure <b>is</b> that his penis <b>touches</b> the semen after it is emitted? If he was rendered impure merely by the emission of the semen then no minimum measure would apply, as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a menstruating woman. But <b>if that is so,</b> then a seminal emission <b>should not negate</b> the count of seven clean days <b>for</b> a man who experienced a gonorrhea-like <b>discharge [<i>ziva</i>].</b> A <i>zav</i> does not stop his counting when he touches a source of impurity, e.g., the carcass of a creeping animal.

### Part 7
If so, <b>why is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse’s juxtaposition between a <i>zav</i> and one who experienced a seminal emission: <b>“This is the law of the <i>zav</i>, and of one from whom the flow of semen emerges”</b> (Leviticus 15:32), that <b>just as <i>ziva</i></b> during the seven clean days <b>negates</b> the count, <b>so too, a seminal emission negates</b> the count. If it is not the emission itself that renders the man impure but only his contact with the semen, why does the emission negate the count of seven clean days?

### Part 8
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabba in response: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>negation</b> is not difficult, as <b>this is the reason that</b> a seminal emission <b>negates</b> the count of seven clean days: <b>Because it is impossible for</b> a <i>zav</i> to experience a seminal emission <b>without</b> it containing <b>bits of [<i>tzaḥtzoḥei</i>] <i>ziva</i>.</b>

### Part 9
Rabba further objected: <b>If that is so,</b> then a seminal emission <b>should negate the entire</b> count of <b>seven</b> clean days, just like an emission of <i>ziva</i>, not merely the day on which the seminal emission occurred. But then <b>why is it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse: <b>“This is the law of the <i>zav</i>,</b> and of one from whom the flow of semen emerges, so that he is impure by it” (Leviticus 15:32), that <b>just as <i>ziva</i></b> during the seven clean days <b>negates</b> the count, <b>so too, a seminal emission negates</b> the count.

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If</b> a seminal emission is compared to <i>ziva</i>, then it might be suggested that <b>just as <i>ziva</i> negates the entire</b> count of <b>seven</b> days, <b>so too, a seminal emission</b> should <b>also negate the entire</b> count of <b>seven</b> days. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “So that he is impure by it,”</b> to teach that <b>in</b> the case of a seminal emission <b>you have</b> a negation of the count that is equivalent <b>only</b> to the impurity <b>that is stated by it,</b> i.e., impurity for one day. Accordingly, a seminal emission <b>negates</b> only <b>one day</b> of the count, not the entire count. This apparently contradicts Rav Huna’s statement that the reason a seminal emission negates the count at all is that the seminal emission of a <i>zav</i> always contains <i>ziva</i>.

### Part 11
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabba: <b>It is a Torah edict</b> that an emission that is <b>purely <i>ziva</i>, when semen is not mixed in it, negates the entire</b> count of <b>seven</b> days, whereas <b>bits of <i>ziva</i> in which</b> some <b>semen is mixed negate only one day</b> of the count.

### Part 12
§ <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, asked Rabbi Elazar:</b> If a woman discharges <b>dry blood, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does she have the status of a menstruating woman? The Gemara explains the dilemma: Since <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And <b>if</b> a woman <b>has a flow of her blood</b> many days” (Leviticus 15:25), does this indicate <b>that</b> the woman is not impure <b>unless</b> the blood <b>flows,</b> i.e., if it is <b>wet, yes,</b> she is impure, whereas if it is <b>dry</b> she is <b>not</b> impure? <b>Or perhaps this</b> phrase: <b>“If</b> a woman <b>has a flow of her blood,” is</b> merely referring to <b>the normal manner</b> that menstrual blood emerges, <b>but actually even dry</b> blood renders the woman impure.

### Part 13
Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: You learned</b> the solution to your dilemma in a mishna (54b): <b>The blood of a menstruating woman and the flesh of a corpse impart impurity</b> whether they are <b>wet or dry.</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>I do not raise the dilemma</b> about blood that was <b>wet</b> when it came out <b>and</b> subsequently <b>dried,</b> as such blood is certainly impure. <b>When I raise the dilemma,</b> it is with regard to blood that was <b>dry at the outset,</b> when it emerged.

### Part 14
Rabbi Elazar responded: <b>You learned</b> the solution to <b>this</b> dilemma <b>as well,</b> in the mishna here: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item <b>similar to a shell,</b> or <b>similar to a hair,</b> or <b>similar to soil,</b> or <b>similar to mosquitoes,</b> if these are <b>red, she should cast</b> them <b>into water</b> to ascertain their nature.
