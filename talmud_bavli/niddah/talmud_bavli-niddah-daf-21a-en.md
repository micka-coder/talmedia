### Part 1
For the purposes of the examination of blood, <b>the</b> wine <b>of the Sharon</b> region in Eretz Yisrael <b>has the same status as undiluted Carmelite</b> wine <b>and not diluted</b> Carmelite wine, <b>new</b> Carmelite wine <b>and not old</b> Carmelite wine.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yitzá¸¥ak bar Avudimi says: And</b> in <b>all</b> cases of blood that has the color of diluted wine, <b>one examines</b> blood <b>only with a simple Tiberian cup.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? Abaye says:</b> Containers are designed according to <b>a universal</b> standard, such that a cup that can <b>contain a <i>log</i></b> of wine, <b>one fashions it from</b> material weighing <b>one hundred dinars,</b> whereas a cup that can contain <b>two <i>log</i>, one fashions it from</b> material weighing <b>two hundred dinars.</b> By contrast, in the case of <b>a simple Tiberian cup, even</b> one that can <b>contain two <i>log</i>, one fashions it from</b> material weighing <b>one hundred dinars. And since</b> the material from which the cup is made <b>is weak,</b> it is more transparent and therefore the redness of the wine inside is <b>more noticeable.</b> Consequently, one must compare the blood to wine in a cup of this kind.
