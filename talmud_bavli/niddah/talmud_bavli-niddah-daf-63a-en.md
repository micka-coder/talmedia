<b>if he is particular</b> that he does not want the liquid there, then <b>yes,</b> it renders the garment impure, but <b>if not,</b> then the liquid does <b>not</b> render the garment impure.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: <b>What is tasteless saliva?</b> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: What is the definition of tasteless saliva? <b>Any</b> saliva <b>where</b> the person <b>had not tasted anything since the evening. Rav Pappa,</b> who was sitting <b>before Rava, thought to say:</b> This <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of the <b>one who said</b> that <b>he did not eat anything</b> all <b>night</b> long. <b>Rava said to him: Is it taught:</b> One who had not tasted anything <b>in the evening,</b> which would indicate that it is referring only to one who did not eat since nightfall? No, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches:</b> Where the person had not tasted anything <b>since the evening,</b> which means even if he ate after nightfall, but did not eat for the rest of the night. This serves <b>to exclude</b> a case <b>where he</b> arose <b>early</b> in the morning <b>and ate,</b> as in such a case it is no longer tasteless saliva.

### Part 3
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What is tasteless saliva? Any</b> saliva <b>where</b> the person did not eat any food and <b>he passed the middle of the night and</b> he was <b>in</b> a state of <b>sleep.</b> The Gemara asks: Is that <b>to say that the matter depends on</b> whether or not he had <b>sleep? But didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Even if <b>he slept the entire day, that is not tasteless saliva;</b> but if <b>he was awake the entire night, that is tasteless saliva?</b> This indicates that sleep is not a critical factor in producing tasteless saliva. The Gemara resolves this apparent contradiction by explaining that <b>there,</b> in the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>, it is referring to a case <b>where</b> he was awake all night and did not sleep properly, but <b>was dozing</b> off and on.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>dozing? Rav Ashi said:</b> It is referring to a situation in which one is <b>asleep and</b> yet <b>not</b> fully <b>asleep,</b> and <b>awake and</b> yet <b>not</b> fully <b>awake. If someone calls him he answers, and he is</b> in a mental state in which <b>he does not know</b> how <b>to provide</b> an answer that requires logical <b>reasoning, but when people remind him</b> about something when he is in that state that has happened previously <b>he remembers</b> it.

### Part 5
A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>rose</b> early in the morning <b>and learned</b> aloud <b>his chapter</b> of the Torah, <b>that</b> saliva in his mouth is <b>not tasteless saliva,</b> as speech weakens the strength of the saliva. <b>And how much</b> learning and talk removes the strength of the saliva? <b>Rav Yehuda bar Sheila says</b> that <b>Rav Ashi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Any</b> case <b>where he uttered most of his</b> normal amount of <b>speech</b> that he usually says <b>in three hours.</b>

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Liquid from split beans</b> is created through <b>the chewing of split beans</b> that divided naturally, not by human hand, which are then applied to the stain. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this ruling <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish said: Tasteless saliva must be</b> mixed <b>with each and every one</b> of the other six substances in order to remove the blood stain. The Gemara answers that this is no proof, as <b>perhaps</b> it is not due to the saliva, but rather <b>the heat of his mouth</b> is what <b>helps</b> the split beans remove the stain.

### Part 7
The Gemara notes that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The liquid from split beans</b> is effective in removing blood stains only when it is <b>boiling, and before [<i>over</i>] one puts salt into</b> the pot.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that</b> the word <b><i>over</i> is a formulation of priority? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said that the verse states: “And Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran [<i>vayya’avor</i>] the Cushite”</b> (II Samuel 18:23), i.e., Ahimaaz overtook the Cushite. <b>Abaye said:</b> It is derived <b>from here: “And he passed [<i>avar</i>] before them”</b> (Genesis 33:3). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the proof is <b>from here: “And their king passed [<i>vayya’avor</i>] before them and the Lord at their head”</b> (Micah 2:13).

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches: The <b>urine</b> that is an effective detergent is specifically urine <b>that fermented.</b> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: For <b>how</b> long must it be <b>fermented?</b> For <b>three days.</b>

### Part 10
On the topic of the urine used to remove a blood stain, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All the measures of the Sages with regard to</b> blood <b>stains require a measure for their measure.</b> There are many types of urine, each of which has different properties, and it is unclear which is to be used. Is it urine <b>of a young</b> person <b>or of an old</b> person? Is it urine <b>of a man or of a woman?</b> Is it urine that has been kept <b>covered or uncovered?</b> Is it urine <b>from the summer or from the rainy season?</b>

### Part 11
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And one must rub</b> each and every one of the substances <b>three times. Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma</b> with regard to this rubbing: Is the <b>going and coming</b> of the hand over the surface of the rubbed item considered <b>one</b> rubbing, <b>or perhaps</b> the <b>going and coming</b> are considered <b>two</b> actions and two distinct rubbings? <b>What</b> is the correct count? The Gemara states: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 12
§ The mishna further teaches: If <b>one applied them</b> in a manner that is <b>not in their</b> prescribed <b>order,</b> or if one applied all seven substances simultaneously, he has done nothing. <b>The Sages taught</b> two <i>baraitot</i> with regard to this matter. If one applied the substances from the <b>second</b> half of the list, i.e., natron, <i>borit</i>, Cimolian earth, and potash, <b>before the</b> substances from the <b>first</b> half of the list, i.e., tasteless saliva, liquid from split beans, and urine, it <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: The <b>second</b> set <b>count for him,</b> but the <b>first do not count for him. And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The <b>first count for him,</b> but the <b>second do not count for him.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Abaye said</b> that there is no dispute between these two <i>baraitot</i>: Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> agree that the substances that he applied <b>second count for him, and not</b> the substances that he applied <b>first. And what</b> does the second <i>baraita</i> mean when it uses the term: <b>First?</b> It means the <b>first according to the order</b> of the mishna, which were the <b>second in their application.</b>

### Part 14
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> For <b>any woman who has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle</b> that is not time dependent, but is dependent on a physical sensation, <b>her time is sufficient,</b> i.e., she does not transmit ritual impurity retroactively, for twenty-four hours or until the last time she examined herself (see 2a). <b>And these are the</b> fixed menstrual <b>cycles</b> based on sensation: When a woman menstruates after <b>she yawns [<i>mefaheket</i>], or</b> after <b>she sneezes, or</b> after <b>she senses</b> pain <b>near her stomach or in her lower abdomen, or</b> after <b>she secretes</b> a discharge, <b>or</b> after <b>a type of</b> feverish <b>shuddering [<i>tzemarmorot</i>] overtakes her. And likewise</b> the same applies with regard to any sensation <b>of the like. And</b> in the case of <b>any</b> woman <b>who establishes</b> a pattern <b>for herself</b> by experiencing such a sensation <b>three times</b> before the onset of menstruation, <b>that is</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle.</b>

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that for any woman who has a fixed menstrual cycle, her time is sufficient. The Gemara objects: <b>We</b> already <b>learned</b> that her time is sufficient on <b>another occasion</b> (2a): For <b>any woman who has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> and she examined herself at that time and discovered blood, <b>her time is sufficient,</b> and it is only from that moment that she transmits ritual impurity. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle of</b> a certain number of <b>days; here,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle based on a physical</b> sensation.

### Part 16
<b>As it teaches</b> in the continuation of the mishna: <b>These are the</b> fixed menstrual <b>cycles</b> based on sensation: When a woman menstruates after <b>she yawns,</b> or after <b>she sneezes, or</b> after <b>she senses</b> pain <b>near her stomach or in her lower abdomen, or</b> after <b>she secretes</b> a discharge. All of these are physical sensations.

### Part 17
The mishna includes the case where <b>she secretes</b> a discharge as one of the physical sensations. The Gemara understands this as referring to a continuous discharge of blood, and therefore asks: <b>But</b> during menstruation <b>she is continuously discharging</b> blood; how can this be a signal of the onset of menstruation? <b>Ulla, son of Rav Ilai, said:</b>
