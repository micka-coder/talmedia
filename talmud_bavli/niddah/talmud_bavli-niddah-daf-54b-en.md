### Part 1
<b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of a woman who gave birth when she was a <i>zava</i>? There are seven <b>days of</b> impurity following the <b>birth</b> of a son and fourteen days of impurity following the birth of a daughter, during which the mother is impure even if she did not experience bleeding. With regard to those days during this period <b>on which she does not see</b> blood, are they <b>reckoned in the counting of her</b> seven clean days required to become purified from the status of <b><i>ziva</i>?</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Kahana says: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: A woman <b>saw</b> blood on <b>two</b> consecutive days during the period of <i>ziva</i>, <b>and on the third</b> day <b>she miscarried, but she does not know what she miscarried,</b> i.e., whether it was a stillborn human fetus for which a woman contracts the impurity of childbirth, or whether she discharged an amorphous piece of tissue. In addition, she does not know whether she emitted blood during the miscarriage.

### Part 3
In such a case, <b>it is uncertain</b> whether <b>she</b> has the status of one who experienced <b><i>ziva</i> or</b> whether she has the status of a woman who gave <b>birth.</b> If she gave birth to a fetus and did not emit blood, she is a woman after childbirth but not a <i>zava</i>. If the discharge was an amorphous piece of tissue and she saw blood, she is a <i>zava</i>. If it was a human fetus and she saw blood, she is one who gives birth as a <i>zava</i>. Finally, if she did not emit blood and it was a discharge of an amorphous piece of tissue, she is not obligated to bring an offering at all.

### Part 4
Consequently, <b>she brings an offering but it is not eaten</b> by the priests, as it is uncertain whether it is an offering of <i>ziva</i> or an offering for her childbirth, or whether it is non-sacred. <b>And</b> the <b>days of</b> impurity following this uncertain <b>birth, on which she does not see</b> blood, <b>are reckoned in the counting of her</b> seven clean days required to become purified from the status of <b><i>ziva</i>.</b> This resolves the dilemma raised by the Sages.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Pappa says</b> that this does not resolve the dilemma, as it <b>is different there, since it can be said</b> that <b>she is a woman who gave birth to a male, and</b> it is only for that reason that <b>all of these additional seven</b> days <b>that we give her</b> due to the concern that she might have given birth to a female, which would render her impure for fourteen days, <b>are reckoned in the counting of her</b> seven clean days of <b><i>ziva</i>.</b> But if it was certain that she gave birth to a female, those days after the birth would not count toward her period of <i>ziva</i>.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rav Pappa:</b> Is <b>there uncertainty that</b> perhaps she is <b>a woman who gave birth to a male,</b> but <b>there</b> is <b>no uncertainty that</b> she might be <b>a woman who gave birth to a female?</b> In fact, both possibilities must be taken into account. And yet, despite the fact that she might have given birth to a female, these seven days are included in the counting of her seven clean days. <b>Rather, isnâ€™t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> it that such days <b>are reckoned</b> in the counting? The Gemara comments: Indeed, <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that these days do count.

### Part 7
The Gemara concludes its citation of the <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a woman whose set pattern is that <b>nine days</b> she is <b>impure,</b> i.e., experiences bleeding, <b>and nine days</b> she is <b>pure,</b> she <b>may engage in intercourse</b> with her husband during <b>eight days out of eighteen.</b> The last two days of the nine with blood are part of her <i>ziva</i> period, after which she must observe one clean day, leaving her with eight days when she may engage in intercourse before the cycle begins again.

### Part 8
In the case of a woman whose set pattern is that <b>ten days</b> she is <b>impure and ten days</b> she is <b>pure,</b> the number of <b>days of her</b> being permitted to <b>engage in intercourse</b> with her husband <b>is equivalent to</b> the number of <b>days of her</b> experiencing the flow of <b><i>ziva</i>.</b> In the first seven days she is a menstruating woman, followed by three days of blood that render her a <i>zava</i>. She must count seven of the ten days without blood to be purified from her <i>ziva</i>, which leaves her three days in which she may engage in intercourse, exactly the same as the three days of <i>ziva</i> on which she saw blood. <b>And so too,</b> the same applies in the case <b>of one hundred</b> days, as she experiences bleeding of <i>ziva</i> for ninety-three days, and is subsequently permitted to her husband for ninety-three days, <b>and so too</b> in the case <b>of one thousand</b> days.
