### Part 1
The Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that a woman has a presumptive status of purity to her husband, <b>only</b> in a case <b>where she does not have</b> a menstrual <b>cycle of days</b> alone, <b>but has</b> a menstrual <b>cycle</b> that is determined both <b>by</b> fixed <b>days and by</b> physical actions she might perform, such as <b>jumps.</b> The reason is that <b>since</b> the <b>matter is</b> also <b>dependent on</b> a particular <b>action,</b> one can <b>say</b> that <b>she did not jump and</b> therefore <b>she did not see</b> blood, and consequently she is presumed to be pure. <b>But</b> with regard to a woman who <b>has</b> a menstrual <b>cycle of days</b> alone, and the projected day of her period arrived, <b>it is prohibited for her to engage in intercourse</b> with her husband.

### Part 2
The Gemara explains that Rav Huna <b>maintains</b> that the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by Torah law.</b> Since she has an uncertain status of impurity by Torah law when the projected day of her period arrives, it is permitted for her to engage in intercourse with her husband only after an examination.

### Part 3
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says: Even</b> if <b>she has</b> a menstrual <b>cycle of days</b> alone, <b>she is permitted</b> to her husband. Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>maintains</b> that the concern for impurity of women at the projected time of their <b>periods</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b> Consequently, she is not considered to have experienced bleeding, though by rabbinic law she should have examined herself to ascertain if she was pure.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Shmuel says in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> With regard to <b>a woman who has</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> and her husband was away for seven days after the expected onset of her period, at which point he returned home, <b>her husband calculates the days of her cycle; and</b> if in the elapsed time it was possible for her to immerse and purify herself, he can presume that she did so, and <b>he may engage in intercourse with her</b> even without asking her whether she is pure.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Yeiva said to Rabbi Abba:</b> Did <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan state</b> this ruling <b>even</b> with regard to <b>a young girl, who is embarrassed to</b> go and <b>immerse</b> herself, in which case one can claim that if her husband was away she would not have gone to the ritual bath?

### Part 6
Rabbi Abba <b>said to</b> Rav Shmuel bar Yeiva: <b>Is that to say</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan applied this <i>halakha</i> to all cases? <b>Did Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that a woman who <b>definitely saw</b> blood is also permitted to her husband? You can <b>say that Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> his ruling with regard to a case where <b>it is uncertain</b> whether the woman <b>saw</b> blood and <b>it is uncertain</b> whether <b>she did not see</b> blood, <b>and</b> therefore her husband may engage in intercourse with her, as one can reason as follows: <b>If you say</b> that <b>she saw</b> blood, one can still <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>she immersed.</b>

### Part 7
<b>But</b> if <b>she definitely saw</b> blood, it is not permitted for the husband to engage in intercourse with her. The reason is: <b>Who is to say that she immersed? It is</b> a conflict between <b>an uncertainty</b> as to whether or not she immersed, <b>and a certainty</b> that she saw blood, <b>and</b> there is a principle that <b>an uncertainty does not override a certainty.</b> In the case of a young girl, since it is uncertain whether she saw blood, and it is uncertain whether she immersed, she is permitted to her husband.

### Part 8
The Gemara raises a difficulty with this principle: <b>And</b> does an uncertainty <b>not</b> override a certainty? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a <i>ḥaver</i> who died and left a storehouse filled with produce, even</b> if the produce was there only <b>that day,</b> it has the <b>presumptive status</b> of produce that was ritually <b>prepared,</b> i.e., properly tithed. This is due to the presumption that the <i>ḥaver</i> tithed the produce himself or instructed others to do so. The Gemara infers: <b>And here,</b> the produce was <b>definitely untithed</b> at the outset, and there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether the <i>ḥaver</i> <b>tithed it,</b> and there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>he did not tithe it. And</b> despite this conflict, <b>the uncertainty</b> whether it was tithed <b>comes and overrides the certainty</b> that it was untithed produce.

### Part 9
The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>There,</b> the conflict that leads to the question with regard to the produce’s status <b>is</b> between <b>certainty and certainty,</b> as the <i>ḥaver</i> certainly tithed the produce. This presumption is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Ḥanina Ḥoza’a; as Rav Ḥanina Ḥoza’a said:</b> There is <b>a presumption with regard to a <i>ḥaver</i> that he does not release an item from his possession that is not</b> ritually <b>prepared.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that in that case the conflict <b>is</b> between <b>uncertainty and uncertainty,</b> as it is possible that there was never an obligation to tithe this produce, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Oshaya. As Rabbi Oshaya said: A person can employ artifice</b> to circumvent obligations incumbent upon him in dealing <b>with his grain, and bring it into</b> his courtyard <b>in its chaff, so that his animal may eat</b> from it, <b>and</b> this grain <b>is exempt from tithe.</b> Although the obligation to tithe produce applies even to animal fodder, it is permitted to feed one’s animal untithed produce that was brought into one’s home before being fully processed. Consequently, the case involving produce is a conflict between two uncertain factors, as it is uncertain whether or not the owner was obligated to tithe the produce in the first place, and even if he was required to do so, it is uncertain whether or not he tithed it.

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges: <b>And still,</b> is it correct that <b>an uncertainty does not override a certainty? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving the maidservant of a certain olive gatherer [<i>massik</i>] in</b> the city of <b>Rimon, who cast a non-viable newborn into a pit, and a priest came and looked</b> into the pit <b>to ascertain whether</b> the baby was <b>male</b> or <b>whether</b> it was <b>female,</b> as the length of time of a woman’s ritual impurity after childbirth, even if she gave birth to a non-viable newborn, depends on whether the child was male or female (see Leviticus, chapter 12).

### Part 12
<b>And</b> the <b>incident came before the Sages</b> to rule whether or not the priest contracted ritual impurity while standing over the corpse, <b>and they deemed him ritually pure.</b> The basis for this ruling was: <b>Due to</b> the fact <b>that martens and hyenas are common there,</b> it is likely that the body was dragged away before the priest arrived at the pit.

### Part 13
The Gemara explains the challenge from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>And here, where it is certain</b> that the maidservant <b>cast</b> the <b>non-viable newborn</b> into the pit, and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether an animal <b>dragged it</b> away and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>no</b> animal <b>dragged it</b> away, the Sages nevertheless ruled that <b>an uncertainty comes and overrides a certainty.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara rejects this challenge: <b>Do not say</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>that</b> the woman certainly <b>cast a non-viable newborn into a pit; rather, say</b>
