### Part 1
<b>And</b> as for the ruling of <b>the <i>baraita</i>,</b> that a woman who discovers menstrual blood not at her fixed time for menstruation is impure retroactively, this is a <i>halakha</i> with which <b>everyone agrees.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But let</b> us <b>interpret</b> the mishna in the <b>opposite</b> manner. Why interpret the mishna in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Dosa and the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with everyone, when we can give precedence to the mishna, which is more authoritative, by interpreting it in accordance with all opinions, as was first explained, and the <i>baraita</i> only in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>Since there is</b> a way <b>to interpret</b> it <b>as a leniency,</b> i.e., that all agree that blood discovered at the fixed time of menstruation renders items impure only from that point onward, <b>and</b> it can also be interpreted in a manner that leads <b>to a stringency,</b> i.e., everyone agrees that blood discovered not at her fixed time for menstruation causes retroactive impurity, and furthermore the Rabbis hold that this is the <i>halakha</i> even when blood is discovered at her fixed time of menstruation, <b>we interpret</b> it the way that leads <b>to a stringency.</b>

### Part 4
§ It <b>is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: If a woman who has a fixed menstrual cycle finds a blood stain, her blood stain is retroactively impure. The reason is <b>that if she sees</b> a flow of menstrual blood <b>not at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle,</b> it renders her ritually impure retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b> The Gemara analyzes this statement: The <b>reason</b> for this ruling is <b>that</b> she is <b>a woman who has a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle;</b> therefore, <b>the Rabbis distinguish between her</b> blood <b>stain,</b> which causes retroactive impurity like a sighting not at her fixed time, <b>and her sighting</b> of her menstrual flow at its fixed time, which does not cause retroactive impurity.

### Part 5
It can be inferred from here that in the case of those <b>other women,</b> e.g., a pregnant or elderly woman, <b>with regard to</b> whom <b>the Sages stated: Their time is sufficient</b> and their menstrual flow never causes retroactive impurity, the same <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>their</b> blood <b>stains as</b> to <b>their sighting</b> of their menstrual flow, i.e., the stains do not cause retroactive impurity.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i> taught? The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus, as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel says in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus:</b> The <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to all women</b> is that <b>their</b> blood <b>stains are impure retroactively. But</b> any <b>women with regard to</b> whom <b>the Sages stated: Their time is sufficient, their</b> blood <b>stains</b> share the same ruling <b>as their sighting</b> of their menstrual flow, i.e., they do not cause retroactive impurity. This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>except</b> for the case of <b>a young girl whose time to see</b> the flow of menstrual blood <b>has not arrived.</b> With regard to her, <b>even if her sheets are soiled with blood one</b> need <b>not be concerned for it,</b> i.e., her blood stains do not cause any impurity at all, even from that point onward.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> ben Antigonus <b>hold</b> that a blood <b>stain</b> causes ritual impurity <b>at all? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>all women</b> is that <b>their</b> blood <b>stains are impure. And</b> similarly, <b>women with regard to</b> whom <b>the Sages stated: Their time is sufficient, their</b> blood <b>stains are</b> also <b>impure. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of <b>women with regard to</b> whom <b>the Sages stated: Their time is sufficient,</b> is that <b>they do not have</b> the ritual impurity of a blood <b>stain. What, is it not</b> correct to say that this means <b>they have no</b> impurity caused by a blood <b>stain at all?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it means that <b>they do not have</b> impurity caused by a blood <b>stain retroactively, but they do have</b> the impurity caused by a blood <b>stain from here onward.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>From the fact that</b> Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus holds that a blood stain imparts ritual impurity from that point onward, does this not indicate that <b>the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that it causes ritual impurity <b>even retroactively?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> the ruling of the first <i>tanna</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who is stringent with regard to</b> blood <b>stains. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>all women</b> is that <b>their</b> blood <b>stains are impure retroactively. And</b> similarly, <b>women with regard to</b> whom <b>the Sages stated: Their time is sufficient, their</b> blood <b>stains are</b> also <b>impure retroactively.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of <b>women with regard to</b> whom <b>the Sages stated: Their time is sufficient,</b> is that <b>their</b> blood <b>stains</b> share the same ruling <b>as their sighting</b> of their menstrual flow, i.e., they cause ritual impurity from that point onward. <b>And</b> in the case of <b>a young girl, if her time to see</b> the flow of menstrual blood <b>has arrived,</b> then <b>she has</b> impurity status when she finds a blood <b>stain. But if her time to see</b> the flow of menstrual blood <b>has not</b> yet <b>arrived, she does not have</b> impurity status when she finds a blood <b>stain.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And when</b> does a young girl <b>arrive</b> at <b>her time to see</b> the flow of menstrual blood? The Gemara answers: <b>When the days of</b> her <b>young womanhood have arrived.</b>

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> with regard to a woman <b>who engages in intercourse while</b> using <b>examination cloths,</b> with which she ascertains whether the menstrual flow began, since the halakhic status of that act is like that of an examination, it reduces the time from a twenty-four-hour period and reduces the time from examination to examination. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b>examination cloth</b> with <b>which</b> she examined herself <b>before intercourse does not reduce</b> the time from a twenty-four-hour period <b>like</b> a regular <b>examination.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion of Shmuel? <b>Rav Ketina says: Since she is excited [<i>shemehuma</i>]</b> and hurried <b>for</b> intercourse with <b>her husband,</b> it is not considered a proper examination. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> even <b>if she is excited for</b> intercourse with <b>her husband, what of it?</b> Why does that invalidate her examination? The Gemara answers: <b>Since she is excited</b> and hurried <b>for</b> intercourse with <b>her husband, she does not insert</b> the examination cloth <b>into</b> her <b>recesses and folds.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: And a woman <b>who engages in intercourse while</b> using <b>examination cloths,</b> the halakhic status of that act <b>is like that of an examination.</b> The mishna refers to examination cloths in the plural. <b>What, is it not</b> speaking of <b>one</b> cloth used <b>before intercourse and one</b> cloth used <b>after intercourse?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No, this</b> cloth <b>and that</b> cloth are both used <b>after intercourse; and</b> the reason why the mishna uses the plural is that <b>one</b> cloth is <b>for his</b> use <b>and one</b> is <b>for her</b> use. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (14a): It is the <b>custom of Jewish women to engage in intercourse</b> with their husbands <b>with two examination cloths, one for his</b> use <b>and one for her</b> use.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>What is this? Granted, if you say</b> that the mishna is referring to <b>one</b> cloth used <b>before intercourse and one</b> used <b>after intercourse,</b> it <b>was necessary</b> for the mishna to mention both examinations, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since she is excited</b> and hurried <b>for</b> intercourse with <b>her husband, she did not examine</b> herself <b>properly.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that her examination with a cloth before intercourse <b>is</b> considered <b>as</b> a halakhically valid <b>examination. But if you say</b> that <b>this</b> cloth <b>and that</b> cloth are his and her cloths used <b>after intercourse,</b> isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that they are treated as halakhic examinations? Why is this ruling necessary?

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> that the examinations performed after intercourse count as valid examinations is necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>perhaps</b> she might <b>see a drop of blood corresponding</b> to the size of <b>a mustard seed and</b> a drop of <b>semen covered it.</b> In other words, it is possible that she discharged a tiny amount of menstrual blood that went undetected, as it was covered by a drop of semen. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that one does not need to be concerned for this possibility.

### Part 15
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: The mishna is referring only to her examinations, but the reason the mishna mentions two examinations is not to give them the status of valid examinations, but to teach that they are both obligatory. As <b>the Sages required her</b> to perform <b>two examinations: One before intercourse and one after intercourse. And when</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> The halakhic status of that act <b>is like that of an examination,</b> it is referring specifically <b>to</b> the examination performed <b>after intercourse.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> A woman <b>who engages</b> in intercourse while using examination cloths. This formulation indicates that the examination is voluntary and is not mandated by the Sages. The Gemara explains that one should emend the text of the mishna so that it <b>teaches: And</b> a woman must <b>engage</b> in intercourse while using examination cloths.

### Part 16
§ The mishna teaches: And with regard to a woman who engages in intercourse while using examination cloths, as the halakhic status of that act is like that of an examination, <b>it reduces</b> the time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> and reduces the time from examination to examination. The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that the mishna teaches that this examination <b>reduces</b> time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b>
