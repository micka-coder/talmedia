### Part 1
<b>If they dissolved,</b> it is blood, and the woman <b>is impure;</b> and if not, she is ritually pure. Evidently, dry blood is impure, as these items are all dry until they are soaked in water. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that dry blood is impure, these items are impure <b>also in</b> a case where <b>they do not dissolve</b> in water. Why is this examination necessary at all? <b>Rabba says:</b> In a case <b>where they do not dissolve,</b> this indicates that the item is not blood at all; rather, <b>it is a distinct entity.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks with regard to these instances discussed in the mishna: <b>But are there</b> actually <b>cases like this?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes</b> there are, <b>and it is taught</b> likewise in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: My father raised two incidents from Tivin to</b> the Sages in <b>Yavne</b> for discussion.

### Part 3
The first was <b>an incident involving a woman who would</b> repeatedly <b>discharge</b> items <b>similar to red shells, and</b> the local residents <b>came and asked my father</b> whether this rendered the woman impure. <b>And my father asked the</b> other <b>Sages, and the Sages asked the doctors</b> what causes this to happen. <b>And</b> the doctors <b>said to them: This woman has a wound in her womb from which she discharges</b> red items <b>similar to shells.</b> The Sages therefore ruled that the woman <b>should cast</b> them <b>into water</b> to ascertain their nature. <b>If they dissolved,</b> it is blood and the woman <b>is impure.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And again</b> there was a similar <b>incident involving a woman who would discharge</b> items <b>similar to red hairs, and she came and asked my father</b> whether she was impure. <b>And my father asked the</b> other <b>Sages, and the Sages asked the doctors, and</b> the doctors <b>said to them:</b> The woman <b>has a mole in her womb from which she discharges</b> items <b>similar to red hairs.</b> The Sages therefore ruled that the woman <b>should cast</b> them <b>into water,</b> and <b>if they dissolved, she is impure.</b>

### Part 5
§ <b>Reish Lakish says: And</b> this examination is conducted only <b>with lukewarm [<i>uvefoshrin</i>]</b> water. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The woman <b>should cast</b> the item <b>into water, and</b> this examination is conducted only <b>with lukewarm</b> water. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The woman <b>mashes</b> the item <b>with saliva,</b> using the fingers of one hand <b>on a fingernail</b> of her other hand. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the two opinions? <b>Ravina says:</b> The difference <b>between them is</b> whether an item is considered blood if it can be <b>mashed by pressing</b> on it, or only if the item dissolves by itself.

### Part 6
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna <b>there</b> (54b) with regard to an animal carcass or the carcass of a creeping animal that dried up, which is examined by soaking it in water to determine whether or not it still imparts impurity: For <b>how long is its soaking in lukewarm</b> water necessary? It is <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Here,</b> with regard to the examination of an item discharged by a woman, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do I need</b> it to be soaked in lukewarm water <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period, or not?</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara explains the question: Perhaps with regard to a carcass of <b>a creeping animal and an unslaughtered animal carcass, which are hard</b> when they dry up, <b>we require</b> soaking <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period, but blood, which is</b> relatively <b>soft</b> after it dries up, does <b>not</b> need to be soaked for that long. In other words, if the item did not dissolve after even a shorter period of time, it is not blood. <b>Or perhaps</b> the examination of a discharged item <b>is no different,</b> and it also must be soaked for twenty-four hours. The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item <b>similar to fish</b> or to grasshoppers, repugnant creatures, or creeping animals, if blood emerges with it, the woman is impure, and if not, she is pure. The Gemara asks: <b>But let Rabbi Yehuda disagree</b> with the Rabbis <b>with regard to this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>as well,</b> just as he disagrees with them in the first clause of the mishna, in the case where a woman discharges an amorphous piece of tissue, as he maintains that she is impure whether or not blood emerges with it.

### Part 9
<b>Reish Lakish says:</b> This case is also <b>subject to</b> the <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, <b>and</b> the opinion cited in the mishna <b>is</b> that of <b>the Rabbis. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the ruling of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as when <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the woman is impure even if blood does not emerge, it is <b>only there, in</b> the case of an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue, <b>as</b> the <b>blood is likely to dry and turn into</b> the form of <b>a piece</b> of tissue. <b>But</b> blood is <b>not</b> likely to <b>become</b> the form of <b>a creature,</b> such as a fish or a grasshopper.

### Part 10
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> this is difficult <b>according to that version</b> in <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>opening of the womb is impossible without</b> a discharge of <b>blood</b> (see 21b). Since <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> holds that blood automatically emerges whenever the womb opens, and therefore the woman is impure even if she did not notice any blood, he <b>should disagree</b> with the Rabbis <b>in this</b> case <b>too,</b> i.e., if a woman discharges an item similar to a fish or one of the other creatures.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>The one who teaches that version</b> of the above discussion <b>teaches</b> an alternative version of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion here as well, <b>like this:</b> With regard to a woman who discharges an item similar to fish, or to grasshoppers, repugnant creatures, or creeping animals, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say</b> that this case is <b>subject to a dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, <b>and</b> the opinion stated in the mishna <b>is</b> that of <b>the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 12
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> tissue in the form of <b>a type of domesticated animal,</b> undomesticated animal, or bird, whether of a kosher or non-kosher species, if it is male, the woman observes the periods of impurity and purity for a woman who gives birth to a male. If it is female, the woman observes the periods of impurity and purity for a woman who gives birth to a female. And if its sex is unknown, the woman observes the strictures of a woman who gave birth to both a male and a female. This is the statement of Rabbi Meir.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> that a woman who discharges a fetus in the form of an animal has the same status as one who discharges a fetus with human form or gives birth to a human? It is <b>since</b> the Torah uses a similar formulation in the two cases, as a term of <b>formation is stated with regard to</b> the creation of these types of animals, in the verse: “And out of the ground the Lord God formed every animal of the field, and every fowl of the air” (Genesis 2:19), <b>just as</b> it is stated with regard to the creation of <b>man:</b> “And the Lord God formed man” (Genesis 2:7).

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then with regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item with <b>the form of a sea monster, its mother should be impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth, since</b> the concept of <b>formation is stated with regard to</b> its creation, <b>just as</b> it is stated with regard to the creation of <b>man. As it is stated: “And God created the great sea monsters”</b> (Genesis 1:21).

### Part 15
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>One derives</b> <i>halakhot</i> of a matter with regard to which <b>formation</b> is stated by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> another matter with regard to which <b>formation</b> is stated, <b>but one does not derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> of a matter with regard to which <b>creation</b> is stated <b>from</b> a matter with regard to which <b>formation</b> is stated.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is</b> there between formation and creation? A verbal analogy can be drawn between different words with similar meanings. For example, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses. The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]</b> on the seventh day” (Leviticus 14:39), and another verse with regard to the priest’s visit seven days later states: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]</b> and look” (Leviticus 14:44). <b>This returning</b> and <b>this coming</b> have the same meaning, and one can therefore derive by verbal analogy that the <i>halakha</i> that applies if the leprosy had spread at the conclusion of the first week applies if it had spread again by the end of the following week.

### Part 17
<b>And furthermore,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a woman who discharges an item similar to a sea monster, with regard to which <b>creation</b> is stated, can be <b>derived</b> by a different verbal analogy <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of human offspring, since here it also states <b>creation, as it is written: “And God created man in His own image”</b> (Genesis 1:27).

### Part 18
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: The verse <b>“And</b> God <b>created</b> man” is necessary <b>to</b> teach the matter <b>itself,</b> i.e., the creation of man. By contrast, the term <b>“And</b> the Lord God <b>formed</b> man,” serves <b>to render it free,</b> i.e., the mention of the formation of man is superfluous in its context and was stated for the purpose of establishing a verbal analogy. <b>And</b> therefore <b>one derives</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of animals, with regard to which <b>formation</b> is stated, <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of man, with regard to which <b>formation</b> is stated.

### Part 19
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>On the contrary,</b> one can say that the verse <b>“And</b> the Lord God <b>formed</b> man” was stated <b>to</b> teach the matter <b>itself,</b> whereas the term <b>“And</b> God <b>created</b> man” serves <b>to render it free; and</b> therefore <b>one derives</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of sea monsters, with regard to which <b>creation</b> is stated, <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of man, with regard to which <b>creation</b> is stated.

### Part 20
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the reason it is animals and not sea monsters that are compared to man is that the term <b>“and…formed”</b> is <b>free on both sides,</b> i.e., <b>it is free with regard to man and it is free with regard to animals.</b> By contrast, the term <b>“and…created” is free with regard to man,</b> but <b>it is not free with regard to sea monsters.</b>

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the reason that the term “and…formed” that appears <b>with regard to animals</b> is considered <b>free? If we say</b> it is due to the fact <b>that it is written: “And God made the animals of the earth</b> after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind” (Genesis 1:25), <b>and it is</b> similarly <b>written: “And out of the ground the Lord God formed every animal of the field”</b> (Genesis 2:19), and therefore this verse is superfluous, but <b>with regard to</b> the <b>sea monster as well,</b> the expression “and…created” is <b>free, as it is written:</b> “And God made…<b>and everything that creeps on the ground</b> after its kind” (Genesis 1:25), <b>and it is</b> also <b>written: “And God created the great sea monsters.”</b> Consequently, the term “and…created” is also free on both sides of the verbal analogy.

### Part 22
The Gemara answers: The <b>creeping animal that is written there is</b> referring to creeping animals <b>of the land,</b> not of the sea. Therefore, the term: “And…created,” stated with regard to sea monsters is not superfluous. The Gemara asks: <b>But what difference is</b> there <b>between</b> a verbal analogy that is <b>free on one side and</b> a verbal analogy that is <b>free on both sides?</b>

### Part 23
The Gemara answers: The <b>difference</b> is with regard to that <b>which Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> with regard to the exegetical principle of verbal analogy: With regard to <b>any verbal analogy that is not free at all, one cannot derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>from it.</b> If the verbal analogy is <b>free on one side, according to Rabbi Yishmael one can derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> from it, <b>and one cannot refute</b> it through logic, even if there are valid counterarguments. <b>According to the Rabbis, one can derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> from it, <b>but one can</b> also <b>refute</b> it logically if there are grounds to distinguish between the two cases. If a verbal analogy is <b>free on both sides, everyone agrees</b> that <b>one can derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> from it <b>and one cannot refute</b> it logically.

### Part 24
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yishmael, what</b> difference <b>is there between</b> a verbal analogy that is <b>free on one side and</b> a verbal analogy that is <b>free on both sides?</b> In both cases, he holds that one can derive <i>halakhot</i> from it and one cannot refute it. The Gemara answers: He holds that the <b>difference</b> is <b>that</b> in a case <b>where there</b> are two mutually exclusive verbal analogies, one that is <b>free on one side and</b> one that is <b>free on both sides, we disregard</b> the analogy that is <b>free on one side,</b>
