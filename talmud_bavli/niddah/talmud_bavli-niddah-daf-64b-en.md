<b>And</b> she is <b>prohibited</b> on the <b>twentieth day, because</b> it is the <b>manner</b> of women that their blood flow <b>comes at its</b> usual <b>time.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Women, with regard to</b> the blood that flows when <b>their hymens</b> are ruptured, <b>are like grapevines: There is a vine that</b> produces <b>wine</b> that <b>is red, and there is a vine that</b> produces <b>wine</b> that <b>is black; and there is a vine that</b> produces <b>wine in abundance, and there is a vine that</b> produces only <b>a meager</b> amount of <b>wine. Rabbi Yehuda says: In every vine, there are</b> grapes fit to produce <b>wine, but</b> any vine in <b>which there are no</b> grapes fit to produce <b>wine, this is a dry vine [<i>durkati</i>].</b> Likewise, any woman who experiences bleeding is capable of giving birth, whereas one who does not experience bleeding is like a dry vine, unable to give birth.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the term <i>durkati</i>, the Gemara explains that this means <b>truncated generation [<i>dor katua</i>].</b> As <b>Rabbi á¸¤iyya teaches: Just as leaven is good for dough, so too, blood is good for a woman.</b> It was likewise <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Meir: Any woman whose blood is plentiful, her children are plentiful.</b>
