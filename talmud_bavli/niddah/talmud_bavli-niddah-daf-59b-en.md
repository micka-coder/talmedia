### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a woman who is urinating and saw blood</b> intermingled with the urine, <b>Rabbi Meir says: If</b> she urinated while <b>standing</b> she is <b>ritually impure,</b> as the blood could have originated in the uterus. <b>And if she is sitting,</b> she is <b>ritually pure,</b> as it is clear that the blood is from a wound. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Whether</b> she urinates in <b>this</b> manner, i.e., standing, <b>or whether</b> she urinates in <b>that</b> manner, i.e., sitting, she is <b>ritually pure.</b>

### Part 2
In the case of <b>a man and a woman who urinated into a basin [<i>hasefel</i>], and blood is found on the water</b> in the basin, <b>Rabbi Yosei deems her ritually pure.</b> Even when it is clear that it is the blood of a woman who urinated, and there is only one uncertainty, Rabbi Yosei deems her ritually pure. In this case, there is a compound uncertainty: Did the blood originate with the man or with the woman, and did the blood come from the uterus or from a wound? <b>And Rabbi Shimon deems her ritually impure,</b> because there is only one uncertainty, <b>as it is not</b> the typical <b>manner of the man to discharge blood</b> with his urine; <b>rather, the presumptive status of</b> the <b>blood</b> is that it was discharged <b>from the woman.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that in a case where a woman finds blood in her urine Rabbi Meir distinguishes between a case where she is standing and a case where she is sitting. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about a situation where she is <b>standing?</b> The difference is <b>that we say</b> that while she was urinating the <b>urine returned to the uterus and brought blood</b> from there, which renders her impure. But if so, when she is <b>sitting as well, let us say</b> that the <b>urine returns to the uterus and brings blood.</b> Why does Rabbi Meir deem her ritually pure in that case?

### Part 4
<b>Shmuel says,</b> in answer to this question: This mishna is referring specifically to a case <b>where</b> the urine <b>flows</b> in a steady stream, without the woman straining. In such a situation, when she is sitting and the urine flows in a steady stream, the stream of urine does not return to the uterus and bring blood. By contrast, if she is standing the urine does not flow in a steady stream, and she must strain to urinate. When she strains to urinate, the urine can bring blood from the uterus with it, whether she is standing or sitting. The Gemara objects: But in a case where she is sitting <b>as well,</b> when the urine <b>flows</b> in a steady stream, <b>perhaps after the urine has finished, blood will come</b> naturally from the uterus, and the flow of blood will mix with the urine?

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Abba says:</b> This is no concern, as the mishna is referring to a case <b>where she is sitting on the edge of the basin and</b> urinates in a steady <b>flow into the basin, and</b> the <b>blood is found</b> only <b>inside the basin. As, if it is so that after</b> the stream of <b>urine finished</b> the blood <b>came</b> naturally from her uterus, the blood <b>should have been found on the edge of the basin.</b> Since the blood is found only inside the basin it is clear that it came with the urine, not separately.

### Part 6
<b>Shmuel said, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. And similarly, Rabbi Abba ruled for</b> a Sage called <b>Kala,</b> who inquired into this matter, that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b>

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of <b>a man and a woman</b> who urinated into a basin, and blood is found on the water in the basin, Rabbi Yosei deems her ritually pure. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In a case where <b>a man and a woman were standing</b> and they urinated into the same basin, and blood was found in the basin, <b>what</b> would <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who distinguishes between a woman who was sitting and a woman who was standing, <b>say</b> the <i>halakha</i> is?

### Part 8
The Gemara clarifies the dilemma: <b>When Rabbi Meir said</b> that a woman who sees blood in her urine while standing is impure, does this apply <b>when</b> there is only <b>one uncertainty,</b> i.e., whether the blood came from a wound or from the uterus? <b>Whereas</b> in a case <b>of a compound uncertainty,</b> i.e., whether the blood came from the man or from the woman, and even if it came from the woman, whether it came from a wound or from her uterus, perhaps Rabbi Meir <b>does not deem</b> her <b>impure? Or perhaps there is no difference</b> between the two cases according to Rabbi Meir.

### Part 9
<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> Rabbi Meir would rule in <b>this</b> case of a compound uncertainty exactly as he rules in <b>that</b> case of a single uncertainty, i.e., there is no difference between the two cases. Reish Lakish clarifies: <b>From where</b> do I know that this is Rabbi Meir’s opinion? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the latter clause of the mishna <b>does not teach: Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei deem her pure.</b> Instead, the mishna states merely that Rabbi Yosei deems her pure. This indicates that Rabbi Meir deems her impure even if a man and a woman both urinated into the same basin where the blood was found.

### Part 10
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to Reish Lakish’s opinion: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if according to Rabbi Meir a woman is impure even when a man also urinates into the same basin, <b>now</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir deems her impure in</b> a case of <b>compound uncertainty, is it necessary</b> for the mishna to teach his opinion <b>in</b> a case of <b>one uncertainty?</b> The Gemara answers: The mishna formulated the <i>halakha</i> in that manner <b>to convey the far-reaching</b> nature of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei,</b> i.e., <b>that he deems her pure even in</b> a case of <b>one uncertainty.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>rather than</b> stating the <b>dispute in</b> a case of <b>one uncertainty,</b> which serves <b>to convey the far-reaching</b> nature of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> teach the <b>dispute in</b> a case of <b>compound uncertainty,</b> in order <b>to convey the far-reaching</b> nature of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir.</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>preferable for the</b> <i>tanna</i> to teach <b>the strength of a lenient</b> ruling. If a <i>tanna</i> can formulate a dispute in a manner that emphasizes the extent of the more lenient opinion, he will do so.

### Part 12
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> disagreed with Reish Lakish, and <b>said: When Rabbi Meir says</b> that the woman is impure, that applies only to a case <b>of one uncertainty, but</b> in a case <b>of compound uncertainty</b> Rabbi Meir <b>did not say</b> that she is impure. The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if Rabbi Meir deems her pure when both a man and a woman urinate into the same basin, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach: Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei deem her pure.</b> Why does the <i>tanna</i> mention only Rabbi Yosei? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so,</b> that Rabbi Meir agrees with this ruling, <b>but since</b> the mishna <b>left off</b> with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei</b> at the end of the first clause of the mishna, the <i>tanna</i> <b>opened</b> the latter clause <b>with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei</b> as well.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> as <b>Rabbi Yosei deems</b> her <b>pure</b> in a case <b>of one uncertainty, is it necessary</b> for the mishna to teach his opinion a case <b>of a compound uncertainty?</b> The Gemara answers: It is necessary for the <i>tanna</i> to state that Rabbi Yosei deems her pure in a case of compound uncertainty, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>this statement,</b> that Rabbi Yosei deems her pure, applies only <b>after the fact,</b> if the woman has already touched pure items, <b>but</b> he does <b>not</b> deem her pure <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that Rabbi Yosei deems her pure even <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 14
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> In the case of <b>a man and a woman who urinated into a basin, and blood is found on the water</b> in the basin, <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei deem her ritually pure, and Rabbi Shimon deems her ritually impure,</b> as there is only one uncertainty.

### Part 15
§ The mishna teaches that Rabbi Shimon deems her ritually impure because there is only one uncertainty, as it is not the typical manner of the man to discharge blood with his urine. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In a case where <b>a woman</b> was <b>sitting</b> and she urinated into a basin, and blood was found in the basin, <b>what</b> would <b>Rabbi Shimon say?</b> The Gemara explains the dilemma: <b>When Rabbi Shimon stated</b> his opinion, was he referring specifically <b>to</b> a woman who <b>is standing, who in general must strain</b> to urinate in such a position, and perhaps as a result the blood came from the uterus? <b>Whereas</b> if <b>she</b> is <b>sitting</b> without straining, in which case Rabbi Meir deems her pure, perhaps Rabbi Shimon agrees that she is <b>not</b> impure. <b>Or perhaps there is no difference</b> between the two cases according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman urinates while <b>sitting</b> and blood is found in the basin, she can <b>attribute</b> the blood to a wound and she is pure, but if she is <b>standing she cannot attribute</b> the blood to a wound, and therefore she is impure; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei said: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case <b>she</b> can <b>attribute</b> the blood to a wound and she is pure. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case <b>she cannot attribute</b> the blood to a wound, and she is impure.

### Part 17
Another <b>dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon: In a case where <b>a man and a woman</b> were <b>sitting</b> and urinated into the same basin, and blood was found in the basin, <b>what</b> would <b>Rabbi Shimon say?</b> The Gemara clarifies the dilemma: <b>When Rabbi Shimon stated</b> his opinion, was he referring to a woman who <b>is standing, who in general must strain</b> to urinate in such a position and perhaps as a result the blood came from the uterus, <b>or</b> to a case where <b>she</b> alone <b>is sitting, which</b> are cases of only <b>one uncertainty? Whereas</b> in a case of <b>compound uncertainty,</b> i.e., uncertainty whether the blood came from the man or from the woman, and even if it did come from the woman, whether it was from a wound or from her uterus, perhaps <b>he does not say</b> that she is impure. <b>Or perhaps there is no difference</b> between the cases, as it is entirely atypical for a man to discharge blood.

### Part 18
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the mishna: <b>Since Rabbi Shimon said</b> that <b>the presumptive status of</b> the <b>blood</b> is that it was discharged <b>from the woman,</b> evidently there <b>is no difference</b> in his opinion whether she was <b>standing or</b> whether she was <b>sitting.</b>

### Part 19
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case where a woman <b>lent her garment to a gentile woman or to a menstruating</b> Jewish <b>woman,</b> and after the borrower returned the garment the owner wore it and then discovered a blood stain, she <b>attributes</b> the blood stain <b>to</b> the gentile or the menstruating woman.

### Part 20
In a case of <b>three women who wore one garment or who sat on one bench [<i>safsal</i>],</b> one after the other, and the garment, or bench, was examined before the first of them donned it, or sat on it, and it was clean, and after the third one removed the garment, or stood up, <b>a blood</b> stain <b>was discovered on</b> the garment or on the bench, <b>all</b> the women <b>are ritually impure.</b>

### Part 21
If <b>they sat on a stone bench or on the bench [<i>ha’itzteva</i>] of a bathhouse,</b> neither of which can become ritually impure, the first because it is stone and the second because it is attached to the floor of the bathhouse, and a blood stain was found on one of those benches, <b>Rabbi Neḥemya deems</b> all three women <b>ritually pure, as Rabbi Neḥemya would say: Any item that is not susceptible to ritual impurity is not susceptible to</b> ritual impurity due to blood <b>stains.</b> The decree of impurity due to blood stains was limited to items susceptible to ritual impurity.

### Part 22
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav says:</b> The ruling of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to a gentile woman</b>
