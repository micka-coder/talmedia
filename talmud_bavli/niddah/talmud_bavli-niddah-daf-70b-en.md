### Part 1
that <b>its slaughter</b> must be performed <b>in the north</b> of the Temple courtyard, as in the case of a guilt offering, <b>and</b> it <b>requires placement</b> of the blood on the right <b>thumb and</b> right <b>big toe</b> and right earlobe of the leper, as described in Leviticus 14:14, <b>and</b> it requires <b>placing hands</b> on the head of the animal, <b>and</b> the accompanying wine <b>libations and waving of the breast and thigh,</b> like a peace offering. <b>And it is eaten by males of the priesthood for</b> one <b>day and</b> the following <b>night,</b> like a guilt offering, rather than for two days, like a peace offering.

### Part 2
<b>But the Rabbis did not concede to Rabbi Shimon, because</b> they hold that he thereby <b>brings sacrificial</b> animals <b>to a situation</b> where the time that they may be eaten is restricted, thereby increasing <b>the</b> likelihood of <b>disqualification,</b> as it might be a peace offering, which may be eaten for two days and one night.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers that <b>Shmuel holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to one</b> <i>halakha</i>, i.e., that it is not the guilt offering that fixes whether the leper must bring the offerings of a wealthy person or a destitute person, <b>but he disagrees with him with regard to one</b> other <i>halakha</i>, as he does not permit such a stipulation in the case of a guilt offering.

### Part 4
The Gemara details the <b>three matters of <i>aggada</i></b> that the sages of Alexandria asked Rabbi Yehoshua. <b>One verse states: “For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies,</b> says the Lord God; but turn yourselves, and live” (Ezekiel 18:32). <b>And one verse states,</b> with regard to the sons of Eli the High Priest, who did not pay attention to the reproof of their father: “If one man sins against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sins against the Lord, who shall pray for him? But they did not listen to the voice of their father, <b>because the Lord desired to kill them”</b> (I Samuel 2:25). Rabbi Yehoshua replied to them: <b>Here,</b> the verse in Ezekiel is referring to a case <b>where</b> the sinners <b>repent,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> the verse in Samuel is speaking of a case <b>where</b> the sinners <b>do not repent.</b>

### Part 5
The sages of Alexandria also asked the following: <b>One verse states: “For</b> the Lord your God, He is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awful, <b>Who shows no favor nor takes graft”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>and one verse states: “The Lord shall show favor to you</b> and give you peace” (Numbers 6:26). How can this contradiction be resolved? Rabbi Yehoshua replied to them: <b>Here,</b> the verse in Numbers is dealing with the time <b>before</b> one’s <b>sentence</b> is issued, when God shows favor and forgives; <b>there,</b> the verse in Deuteronomy is referring to <b>after</b> the <b>sentence</b> has been issued, when He no longer forgives.

### Part 6
The sages of Alexandria further asked: <b>One verse states: “For the Lord has chosen Zion;</b> He has desired it for His dwelling place” (Psalms 132:13), <b>and one verse states: “For this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and of My fury from the day that they built it until this day,</b> so that I should remove it from before My face” (Jeremiah 32:31). Rabbi Yehoshua replied to them: <b>Here,</b> the verse in Psalms is referring to the time <b>before Solomon married Pharaoh’s daughter</b> (see I Kings 3:1), whereas <b>there,</b> the verse in Jeremiah is speaking of the time <b>after Solomon married Pharaoh’s daughter.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara lists the <b>three matters of ignorance</b> that the sages of Alexandria asked Rabbi Yehoshua. <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the wife of Lot,</b> who was turned into a pillar of salt as she fled from the city of Sodom (Genesis 19:26), in terms of whether <b>she transmits ritual impurity</b> as a corpse? Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: A corpse transmits ritual impurity, but a pillar of salt,</b> even if it was formerly a person, <b>does not impart ritual impurity.</b>

### Part 8
The sages of Alexandria also asked Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the son of the Shunammite</b> woman, who died and was brought to life by Elisha (II Kings 4:33–36), in terms of whether <b>he transmits ritual impurity</b> as a corpse? Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: A corpse transmits ritual impurity, but a living</b> person <b>does not transmit ritual impurity,</b> even if he had been dead temporarily.

### Part 9
The sages of Alexandria also asked Rabbi Yehoshua: With regard to <b>the dead</b> who will be resurrected <b>in the future,</b> will they <b>require sprinkling</b> with ashes of the red heifer on the <b>third and seventh</b> days, like one who is purified after coming into contact with a corpse, <b>or</b> will <b>they not require</b> that sprinkling? Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: When they come to life, we will be clever for them</b> and clarify the <i>halakha</i>. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: <b>When Moses our teacher comes with them,</b> he will tell us the correct <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 10
The sages of Alexandria also asked Rabbi Yehoshua <b>three matters of behavior: What</b> should <b>a person do to become wise?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them:</b> He should <b>increase</b> his time spent <b>sitting</b> in the study house <b>and minimize</b> his dealings <b>in merchandise.</b> The sages of Alexandria <b>said</b> to Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>Many</b> people <b>have done so, and</b> it <b>did not help them</b> to acquire wisdom. Rabbi Yehoshua responded: <b>Rather, they should pray for mercy</b> to receive wisdom <b>from the One to Whom wisdom belongs, as it is stated: “For the Lord gives wisdom; out of His mouth comes knowledge and discernment”</b> (Proverbs 2:6).

### Part 11
With regard to the subject of wisdom, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches a parable of a flesh-and-blood king who prepared a feast for his servants.</b> The servants eat the food placed before them, <b>but</b> in addition <b>he sends</b> some <b>of</b> the food <b>that is before him to those he loves.</b> Similarly, God sends some of His wisdom to those He loves, as the verse states: “For the Lord gives wisdom.”

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: Since the path to wisdom is through prayer, <b>what is</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>teaching us</b> when he says that one should increase his time spent sitting and studying? The Gemara answers that Rabbi Yehoshua is teaching <b>that this,</b> prayer, <b>without that,</b> sitting and learning, <b>does not suffice.</b>

### Part 13
The sages of Alexandria asked: <b>What</b> should <b>a person do to become wealthy?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them:</b> He should <b>increase</b> his time involved in <b>merchandise and conduct his business faithfully.</b> The sages of Alexandria <b>said</b> to Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>Many</b> people <b>have done so, and</b> it <b>did not help them</b> become rich. Rabbi Yehoshua replied: <b>Rather, they should pray for mercy</b> to receive wisdom <b>from the One to Whom wealth belongs, as it is stated: “Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold,</b> says the Lord of hosts” (Haggai 2:8).

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: Since the path to wealth is through prayer, <b>what is</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>teaching us</b> when he says that one should increase his time spent involved in merchandise and conduct his business faithfully? Once again, the Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehoshua is teaching <b>that this,</b> prayer, <b>without that,</b> being involved in honest business, <b>does not suffice.</b>

### Part 15
The sages of Alexandria further asked: <b>What</b> should <b>a person do to have male children?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them:</b> He should <b>marry a woman who is fit for him</b>
