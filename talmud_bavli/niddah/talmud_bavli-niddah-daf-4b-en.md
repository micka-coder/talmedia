### Part 1
The reason is not <b>that</b> one does not presume that ritual impurity moved from place to place, but because <b>I say</b> that <b>a ritually pure man entered there and took it</b> off the shelf and placed it onto the ground, avoiding the impure garment it would have hit had it fallen. When there is no such explanation, the principle that one presumes impurity moved from place to place does apply, e.g., in the case of the basket where the carcass of a creeping animal was found inside.

### Part 2
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Here, too, let us say</b> that <b>a raven,</b> which often touches creeping animals, <b>came and threw</b> the creeping animal into the basket when it was in the second corner, after the produce had been emptied from it. The Gemara rejects this claim: In the case of <b>a person, who</b> acts <b>with intent, we</b> can <b>say</b> that perhaps a person moved the loaf from the shelf onto the ground. By contrast, with regard to <b>a raven, which</b> does <b>not</b> act <b>with intent, we</b> do <b>not say</b> that perhaps it committed such a purposeful act.

### Part 3
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the ruling of the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Now</b> the status of <b>this loaf</b> found on the ground <b>is</b> one of <b>uncertain impurity</b> found <b>in a private domain, and</b> the guiding principle in <b>any</b> case of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>impurity in a private domain</b> is that the item with <b>uncertain</b> status is deemed <b>impure.</b> If so, shouldn’t the loaf be deemed impure? The Gemara answers: No, <b>as</b> this <b>is an entity that lacks consciousness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked, and</b> the guiding principle is that with regard to <b>any entity that lacks consciousness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked, whether</b> it is found <b>in a public domain or in a private domain,</b> the item with <b>uncertain</b> status is deemed <b>pure.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: That principle, that in any case of uncertainty involving impurity in a private domain the item with uncertain status is deemed impure, applies to a case of impurity by Torah law, whereas <b>here</b> we are dealing <b>with ritual impurity by rabbinic law.</b> The Gemara adds: The language of the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>is also precise, as it teaches:</b> There was a loaf resting on top of a shelf, and there was an item of light impurity [<i>madaf</i> ] lying underneath it. The term <b><i>madaf</i></b> is similar to that <b>which is written: “A driven leaf [<i>niddaf</i> ]”</b> (Leviticus 26:36), i.e., a light item. Likewise, the <i>Tosefta</i> is referring to a light, or rabbinic, impurity.

### Part 5
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is <b>neither in accordance with the statement of this</b> <i>tanna</i> nor in accordance with the statement of that <i>tanna</i>. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is <b>neither in accordance with the statement of this</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>nor in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>that</b> <i>tanna</i>. It is <b>not accordance with the statement of Shammai,</b> who rules that her time is sufficient and she does not need to be concerned that her menstrual flow started earlier, <b>as he did not enact</b> any <b>safeguard for his statement. And</b> is it <b>not in accordance with the statement of Hillel,</b> who rules that she assumes ritual impurity status retroactive to the time of her most recent examination, <b>as</b> he <b>went beyond [<i>hifriz</i>] his bounds</b> with his safeguard.

### Part 6
The Rabbis continue: <b>Rather,</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period reduces</b> the time <b>from examination to examination,</b> i.e., if her most recent self-examination took place more than twenty-four hours earlier, she need concern herself with ritual impurity only for the twenty-four-hour period prior to discerning the blood. <b>And from examination to examination reduces</b> the time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> i.e., if she examined herself in the course of the previous day and discovered no blood, she was definitely pure prior to the examination.

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: A twenty-four-hour <b>period reduces</b> the time <b>from examination to examination, how so?</b> A woman <b>examined herself on Sunday and found</b> that she was <b>ritually pure, and</b> then <b>she sat</b> through <b>Monday and Tuesday and did not examine</b> herself. <b>And</b> then <b>on Wednesday she examined herself and found</b> that she was <b>impure.</b> In such a case <b>we do not say</b> that <b>she should be impure</b> retroactively <b>from</b> the time of this <b>examination</b> extending back <b>until</b> the time of her most recent <b>examination. Rather,</b> she is impure retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b>

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> continues: And <b>from examination to examination reduces</b> the time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period, how so?</b> A woman <b>examined herself</b> in <b>the first hour</b> of a day <b>and found</b> that she was <b>ritually pure, and</b> then <b>she sat</b> through the <b>second and third</b> hours of the day <b>and did not examine</b> herself. <b>And</b> then <b>at the fourth</b> hour <b>she examined herself and found</b> that she was <b>impure.</b> In such a case <b>we do not say</b> that <b>she should be impure</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period. Rather,</b> she is impure retroactively <b>from</b> the time of this <b>examination</b> extending back <b>until</b> the time of her most recent <b>examination,</b> three hours earlier.

### Part 9
The Gemara raises a difficulty: This <i>halakha</i> is <b>obvious. Since she examined herself at the first hour and found</b> that she was <b>pure,</b> there is <b>no</b> reason <b>to render her impure</b> retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b> Why does the <i>baraita</i> state such an obvious <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: Since the <i>baraita</i> taught that according to the Rabbis a twenty-four-hour <b>period reduces</b> the time <b>from examination to examination,</b> it <b>also taught</b> the parallel case, that <b>from examination to examination reduces</b> the time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> despite the fact that this <i>halakha</i> is obvious.

### Part 10
<b>Rabba says: What</b> is the <b>reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis? A woman</b> can <b>sense within herself</b> if she is experiencing a flow of blood. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>If so, her time should be sufficient,</b> as there should be no concern that her flow began earlier. The Gemara explains: <b>And Rabba</b> did not in fact mean this explanation seriously; rather, he <b>wanted to hone</b> the mind of <b>Abaye.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what</b> is the real <b>reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis?</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: It is <b>in accordance with that which Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel says: The Sages instituted that the Jewish women should examine themselves</b> twice each day, <b>morning and evening.</b> The <b>morning</b> examination is in order <b>to render fit</b> the <b>ritually pure</b> items <b>of the night,</b> i.e., any items that she touched the night before. <b>And</b> the <b>evening</b> examination is in order <b>to render fit</b> the <b>pure</b> items that she touched <b>during the day.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara continues its explanation: <b>And this</b> woman, <b>since she did not examine</b> herself in accordance with the rabbinic enactment, <b>she loses</b> the status of the ritually pure items she touched over the <b>period [<i>ona</i>]</b> of a day or a night. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by: <b>Period</b> of a day or a night? Doesn’t her retroactive impurity status extend back for a twenty-four-hour period? The Gemara answers: It means <b>an additional period</b> of a day or a night, i.e., twenty-four hours in total.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Pappa says to Rava: But</b> occasionally <b>you find three periods</b> of day or night within a twenty-four-hour period. For example, if she examined herself on Monday afternoon and finds blood, then the twenty-four-hour period extending back to Sunday afternoon includes three periods of day or night: Monday day, Sunday night and Sunday day from the time of her most recent examination, as these twenty-four hours do not fit precisely into two such periods. The Gemara answers: <b>The Sages rendered their measures equal, so</b> that <b>one should not differentiate</b> between cases. In other words, they wanted to issue a uniform ruling that applies universally <b>and</b> therefore they established a set twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> of retroactive impurity, regardless of the circumstances.

### Part 14
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that they established the set twenty-four-hour period <b>so that the sinner should not profit</b> from his transgression. If the extent of retroactive impurity would be fixed at one additional period of day or night, a woman who remembers and examines herself in the early morning would be impure retroactively for a full twenty-four hours, back to early morning the previous day, whereas one who waits until noon would be impure only for the period of the morning and the previous night.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> these two answers? The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between</b> them is in a case <b>where she was prevented</b> by outside circumstances <b>and did not perform an examination.</b> According to the second answer she would not be considered a sinner and therefore she would be impure only for an additional period of a day or night. By contrast, according to the first answer her impure status would span twenty-four hours regardless of the circumstances.

### Part 16
§ The mishna teaches: For <b>any woman who has a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle,</b> and she examined herself at that time and discovered blood, her time is sufficient, and she transmits impurity only from that time onward. The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa, and not</b> in accordance with <b>the</b> opinion of <b>the Rabbis? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: There are four</b> categories of <b>women</b> for whom the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>their time is sufficient: A virgin,</b> i.e., a girl who has never experienced menstruation, <b>a pregnant woman, a nursing</b> mother, <b>and an elderly woman. Rabbi Dosa says:</b> For <b>every woman who has a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle,</b> and she examined herself at that time and discovered blood, <b>her time is sufficient,</b> and it is only from that stage that she transmits ritual impurity.

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. The Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Dosa only in</b> the case of a woman who discovers blood at an irregular time, <b>not at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle. But</b> if she discovers blood <b>at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle, they agree with him</b> that her time is sufficient and there is no retroactive impurity. <b>And the mishna</b> is referring to a woman who discovers blood <b>at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle, and</b> therefore <b>everyone agrees</b> that her time is sufficient.

### Part 18
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>By inference,</b> one can conclude <b>that Rabbi Dosa says</b> that her time is sufficient <b>even</b> if she discovers blood <b>not at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle.</b> If so, <b>who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a woman who has a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle</b> who finds a blood stain, <b>her</b> blood <b>stain</b> is <b>impure retroactively</b> from when the garment in question was laundered. The reason is <b>that if she sees</b> a flow of menstrual blood <b>not at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle,</b> it renders her impure retroactively <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period.</b> Therefore, the blood stain likewise renders her retroactively impure.

### Part 19
The Gemara concludes its question: <b>Shall we say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa,</b> as one can claim that <b>Rabbi Dosa disagrees with the Rabbis only</b> in a case where a woman sees menstrual blood <b>at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle. But</b> if she sees blood <b>not at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle, he agrees</b> with them that she is impure retroactively. <b>And</b> according to this answer <b>the mishna,</b> which deals with a woman who discovers blood <b>at the fixed time of her</b> menstrual <b>cycle, is</b> only in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa,</b> in contrast to the earlier claim.
