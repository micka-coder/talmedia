### Part 1
in accordance with the ruling of the mishna: The Sages give her four nights, then he should have given her longer, as <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that according to Beit Hillel the blood may be attributed to the torn hymen <b>until the wound heals.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rather,</b> you will say <b>that he gave her</b> these four nights <b>all</b> during her <b>days</b> as <b>a young woman. Are there twelve months</b> when one has the status of <b>a young woman? But didn’t Shmuel say: The difference</b> in time <b>between</b> becoming <b>a young woman and</b> becoming <b>a grown woman is only six months? And if you would say</b> that Shmuel is saying that it is in <b>less than</b> six months <b>that there is no</b> transition from young woman to grown woman status, but <b>there is</b> such a transition in <b>more</b> than six months, as women develop differently, that is not so, <b>as</b> Shmuel <b>said: Only,</b> which indicates that the period is neither less nor more than six months.

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> you will suggest <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>gave her two</b> days <b>during</b> her <b>days as a minor, and</b> he gave her <b>two</b> days <b>during</b> her <b>days as a young woman.</b> This too is difficult, as <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Shelamya asked Rav:</b> With regard to a young girl who married before she reached puberty, and then <b>her time to see</b> menstrual blood <b>arrived</b> while she was <b>under</b> the authority of <b>her husband, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does she have the four nights when the blood is considered to be from her torn hymen?

### Part 4
And Rav <b>said to him: All the acts of intercourse that you engage in</b> while she is still too young <b>are</b> considered as <b>only one</b> act of intercourse, <b>and the remainder,</b> i.e., three more acts of intercourse, <b>complete</b> the total number of <b>four nights.</b> If so, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi could not have given her two nights as a minor, since at most those acts of intercourse count as one.

### Part 5
<b>Rather,</b> you will suggest <b>that he gave her one</b> night <b>during her days as a minor, and two</b> nights <b>during her days as a young woman, and one</b> night <b>during her days as a grown woman.</b> But this is also difficult: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>we generally give a grown woman more</b> than one night, then one can understand why Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi gave her one night in this case: <b>Just as</b> all the acts of intercourse she engaged in as <b>a minor have the effect to deduct one</b> night <b>for</b> her <b>days as a young woman,</b> similarly all the acts of intercourse she engaged in while <b>a young woman have the effect to deduct one</b> night <b>for</b> her days as <b>a grown woman,</b> leaving her with one.

### Part 6
<b>But if you say</b> that <b>we generally do not give a grown woman more</b> than one night, then in this case Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>should</b> have <b>given her</b> as a grown woman <b>only</b> the one act of <b>relations</b> that consummate a marriage, which are <b>a mitzva,</b> i.e., merely a single act of intercourse, <b>and nothing more,</b> as otherwise the acts of intercourse before she became a grown woman would not have affected her status.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the correct explanation is <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>gave her one</b> night <b>during her days as a minor and three</b> nights <b>during her days as a young woman.</b> And as for the fact that she has the status of a young woman for only exactly six months, <b>do you maintain</b> that <b>every three months</b> was counted as <b>one period</b> of the husband’s absence, such that she had only two nights in six months? This is not the case. Rather, <b>every two months</b> was counted as <b>one period,</b> and therefore she had three nights during these six months when she could attribute the blood to her torn hymen.

### Part 8
The Gemara relates that the Sage <b>Minyamin Saksana was coming and walking to the place of Shmuel. He thought</b> that he <b>would perform an action in accordance</b> with the opinion <b>of Rav,</b> in that he would permit a grown woman to attribute blood to her torn hymen for the entire first night, <b>even</b> though she had already <b>seen</b> menstrual blood before she was married. Minyamin mistakenly <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Rav does not distinguish between</b> a woman who <b>has seen</b> menstrual blood <b>and</b> a woman who <b>has not seen</b> menstrual blood.

### Part 9
<b>Before</b> Minyamin reached Shmuel’s place, <b>he passed away on the road,</b> and he never completed the journey. Upon hearing this, <b>Shmuel recited</b> this verse <b>about Rav: “No mishap shall befall the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 12:21), i.e., God does not allow prohibited acts to come from the statements of the righteous. In this case, Minyamin ruled incorrectly, based on a misunderstanding of Rav’s statement.

### Part 10
Since the Gemara cited Rav Ḥinnana bar Shelamya, it cites another of his statements: <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Shelamya said in the name of Rav: Once a person’s teeth fall out</b> and he has difficulty eating, <b>his food diminshes</b> accordingly, <b>as it is stated: “And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your places”</b> (Amos 4:6). The term “cleanness of teeth” is here a euphemism for having no teeth at all, which leads to a lack of bread.

### Part 11
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of a young woman who <b>saw</b> menstrual blood before marriage, while <b>she was still</b> in her father’s house, Beit Hillel say: They may engage in several acts of intercourse, as any bleeding throughout the entire night is attributed to the torn hymen. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a young woman who <b>saw</b> menstrual blood while <b>she was still in her father’s house, Beit Hillel say: All the night is hers, and</b> the Sages <b>give her</b> one <b>complete period</b> of time during which she may attribute all bleeding to her torn hymen. <b>And how long is a complete period</b> of time in this context? <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel explained</b> that it is one <b>night and half</b> of the next <b>day.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But do we require all this</b> time of one night and half of a day for a complete period? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of one <b>whose winepresses or olive presses were impure and he wished to prepare</b> his grapes and olives <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual purity, how does he act?</b> He should <b>rinse the planks</b> used to press the grapes in the winepress, <b>and the palm branches</b> used as brooms, <b>and the troughs,</b>
