### Part 1
<b>Until</b> above <b>the knee. Rabbi Yannai says: Until his orifices. Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Yehoshua: Until the location of his navel.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara explains the dispute between the <i>amora’im</i>: The difference <b>between</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zakkai and</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yannai</b> is whether <b>a <i>tereifa</i> can survive</b> beyond twelve months. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yannai, <b>holds</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> can survive</b> beyond twelve months. Therefore, although one whose legs were removed until above the knee has the status of a <i>tereifa</i>, if a woman discharges a fetus of this form she is impure. Only if the fetus lacks legs until his orifices is the woman pure, as such a person cannot survive. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Zakkai, <b>holds</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> cannot survive</b> beyond twelve months. Therefore, even if the fetus lacks legs only from above the knee and not from his orifices, the woman is not impure.

### Part 3
The difference <b>between</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yannai and</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who both agree that a <i>tereifa</i> can survive, is with regard to a statement <b>of Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar said:</b> If the <b>thigh,</b> i.e., the hind leg of the animal, <b>and its recess were removed</b> from an animal before slaughter, the animal is considered <b>an unslaughtered carcass;</b> consequently, it is forbidden in consumption and imparts ritual impurity even while still alive. Rabbi Yannai agrees with the statement of Rabbi Elazar, and accordingly holds that if the lower part of a person’s body until his orifices is missing or removed, the person immediately assumes the halakhic status of a corpse. Rabbi Yoḥanan disagrees with Rabbi Elazar and holds that one whose lower part of his body was missing or removed has the status of a corpse only if it is removed until his navel.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between the <i>amora’im</i> is with regard to a fetus that is lacking part of its body <b>from below</b> to <b>above,</b> i.e., the lower part of his body; <b>but</b> if it is lacking part of its body <b>from above</b> to <b>below, even any amount</b> of its skull, the woman <b>is pure. And likewise, Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> a fetus <b>whose skull is sealed,</b> i.e., deficient, <b>its mother is pure.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i>: <b>And Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> a fetus that looks <b>like</b> the part <b>of a palm tree</b> that <b>branches out,</b> i.e., the lower part of its body is formless while the upper part has arms and legs coming out of its shoulders like branches, <b>its mother is pure.</b>

### Part 6
§ It <b>was stated</b> with regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> a fetus <b>whose face is mashed</b> but not completely flattened, that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says its mother is impure,</b> and <b>Reish Lakish says its mother is pure.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges a shaped hand,</b> i.e., a hand whose fingers are discernible, <b>or a shaped foot, its mother is impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth,</b> as it certainly came from a full-fledged fetus, <b>and we are not concerned</b> that <b>perhaps it came from</b> a fetus with <b>a sealed,</b> i.e., deficient, <b>body. And if it is so,</b> that a fetus with a mashed face does not render its mother impure, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach:</b> We are not concerned that <b>perhaps</b> it came <b>from</b> a fetus with <b>a sealed body or from one whose face is mashed.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Pappi says: In</b> a case where <b>its face is mashed, everyone agrees that</b> the woman <b>is impure. When they disagree,</b> it is <b>in</b> a case where <b>its face is</b> completely <b>flat,</b> i.e., none of its features are discernible; <b>and the opposite was stated: Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>its mother is pure, and Reish Lakish says</b> that <b>its mother is impure.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> according to this version of the dispute, <b>let Reish Lakish raise an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan from this</b> <i>baraita</i>, from which Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to the opinion of Reish Lakish according to the previous version of the dispute: If a woman who discharges a fetus whose face is flat is pure, the <i>baraita</i> should have stated that there is no concern that the hand or foot might have come from a fetus with a sealed body or one whose face is flat. The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish did not raise the objection, <b>because Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> would have <b>responded to him</b> that the status of <b>a sealed body is</b> the same as that of <b>one whose face is flat.</b> There is no reason to mention both types of deformities.

### Part 10
The Gemara relates: <b>The sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya went out to the villages</b> to inspect their father’s fields. When <b>they came</b> back <b>to their father, he said to them:</b> Wasn’t <b>any incident brought to you</b> for a halakhic ruling? <b>They said to him:</b> A case of a woman who discharged a fetus with <b>a flat face was brought to us, and we deemed her impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after childbirth.

### Part 11
Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to them: Go out and deem pure that which you have deemed impure. What was your thinking</b> when you ruled that she is impure? Did you reason that as the matter is subject to a dispute, one should rule <b>stringently?</b> But your ruling <b>is a stringency that leads to a leniency, as you have given</b> the woman thirty-three <b>days of purity</b> after the birth of a male, following her period of impurity, which are the minimum days of purity established in the Torah for a woman who gave birth.

### Part 12
§ <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to a woman or female animal <b>who discharges an entity that has two backs and two spines, Rav says</b> that <b>in</b> the case of the <b>woman,</b> her discharged fetus <b>is not</b> considered <b>an offspring,</b> as it cannot survive, and therefore the woman does not have the ritual impurity caused by childbirth, and <b>in</b> the case of the <b>animal,</b> its fetus <b>is prohibited for consumption. And Shmuel says: In</b> the case of <b>a woman,</b> the discharged fetus is considered <b>an offspring,</b> and the woman is impure, and <b>in</b> the case of <b>an animal,</b> the fetus is <b>permitted for consumption.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: They disagree <b>concerning</b> the statement <b>of Rav Ḥanin bar Abba, as Rav Ḥanin bar Abba said:</b> The verse states: “Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that only chew the cud, or of them that only have the hoof cloven [<i>umimafrisei haparsa hashesua</i>]: The camel, and the hare, and the rock badger” (Deuteronomy 14:7). The apparently superfluous term <b><i>hashesua</i></b> is not a redundant description of the cloven hoof; it is referring to a separate <b>entity that has two backs and two spines</b> and therefore looks like an entirely cloven animal.

### Part 14
It is with regard to this prohibition that Rav and Shmuel disagree. <b>Rav says</b> that <b>there is no</b> such living <b>entity in the world, and when the Merciful One taught</b> this prohibition <b>to Moses, he taught</b> it <b>to</b> him with regard to a fetus that has two backs and two spines that is found <b>in the womb of its mother</b> after slaughter. <b>And Shmuel says</b> that <b>there is</b> such <b>an entity in the world, and when the Merciful One taught</b> this prohibition <b>to Moses, he taught</b> it <b>to him</b> with regard to a living animal <b>in the world, but</b> a fetus that has two backs and two spines <b>in the womb of its mother is permitted</b> for consumption.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya raised an objection to Rav</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: Any</b> priest <b>who has two backs and two spines is disqualified from</b> the Temple <b>service,</b> as he is blemished. <b>Evidently,</b> an entity <b>that</b> has two backs and two spines <b>can survive, and</b> this is <b>difficult for</b> the opinion of <b>Rav.</b> Rav <b>said to him: You are</b> clearly <b>Shimi,</b> i.e., you asked well. Yet the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus is not referring to one who literally has two backs and two spines, but rather <b>to</b> one <b>whose spine is crooked</b> and therefore appears as though he has two spines. One who actually has two backs and two spines cannot survive.

### Part 16
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: Among discharged animal <b>fetuses, there are those that are forbidden</b> in consumption, as they have the halakhic status of carcasses of unslaughtered animals. Specifically, if an animal fetus is <b>born</b> in the <b>fourth</b> month of pregnancy in the case <b>of small</b> domesticated animals, where the pregnancy is normally five months long, or it is <b>born</b> in the <b>eighth</b> month of pregnancy in the case <b>of large</b> livestock, where the pregnancy is normally nine months long, or if the miscarriage occurred <b>from this</b> stage of the pregnancy <b>and earlier,</b> i.e., if the pregnancy ended before this stage, the animal is <b>forbidden.</b> This <b>excludes one that has two backs and two spines.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it states that an animal with two backs and two spines is <b>excluded?</b> Does it <b>not</b> mean that it is <b>excluded from the category of</b> those <b>fetuses,</b> which are permitted for consumption if found inside their mother’s womb, <b>as</b> such animals are <b>forbidden even</b> while they are <b>in the wombs of their mothers?</b> This contradicts the opinion of Shmuel, who holds that an animal fetus of that type is permitted for consumption.

### Part 18
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>according to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, and Shmuel explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>according to his</b> line of <b>reasoning. Rav explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>according to his</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> as was assumed above: If an animal fetus is <b>born</b> in the <b>fourth</b> month of pregnancy in the case <b>of small</b> domesticated animals, or it is <b>born</b> in the <b>eighth</b> month of pregnancy in the case <b>of large</b> livestock, or if it was born <b>from this</b> stage of the pregnancy <b>and earlier,</b> the animal is <b>forbidden.</b>

### Part 19
<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> In a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>emerged into the airspace of the world; but</b> if it was found <b>in its mother’s womb</b> after its mother was slaughtered, <b>it is permitted for</b> consumption. This <b>excludes</b> the case of a fetus <b>that has two backs and two spines, as even</b> if it is found <b>in the womb of its mother it is prohibited.</b>
