### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that according to Beit Shammai it is permitted to engage in intercourse by the light of a lamp. In this regard, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Even though</b> the Sages <b>said</b> with regard to <b>one who engages in intercourse by the light of a lamp,</b> that <b>this is disgraceful, Beit Shammai say: A woman is required</b> to examine herself with <b>two cloths,</b> once before and once after <b>each</b> act of <b>intercourse, or</b> she must <b>engage in intercourse by the light of a lamp. And Beit Hillel say:</b> It is <b>sufficient</b> for her to examine herself <b>with two cloths throughout the night,</b> once before the first act of intercourse and once after the final act of intercourse.

### Part 2
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel: According to your statement</b> that a woman may engage in intercourse several times in one night without an examination between each act of intercourse, <b>let us be concerned lest she will see,</b> i.e., emit, <b>a drop of blood the size of a mustard</b> seed <b>during the first</b> act of <b>intercourse,</b> and will thereby become impure, <b>and semen from the second</b> act of <b>intercourse will cover it.</b> Since the examination after the last act of intercourse will not reveal the drop of blood, the woman will erroneously think she is pure.

### Part 3
<b>Beit Hillel said to them</b> in response: <b>Even according to your statement, let us be concerned</b> that <b>while the saliva</b> was still <b>in the mouth,</b> i.e., while the blood was in her vagina, <b>perhaps it was squashed and disappeared.</b> Even if she examines herself after each act of intercourse, as mandated by Beit Shammai, it is possible that the semen of that act covered the blood, and it will not be revealed by the examination.

### Part 4
Beit Shammai <b>said to</b> Beit Hillel: One cannot compare the two situations, <b>as a squashed</b> drop of blood after the woman has engaged in intercourse <b>once is not similar to a squashed</b> drop of blood after the woman has engaged in intercourse <b>twice,</b> and therefore our concern is more reasonable.

### Part 5
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: I see</b> as correct <b>the statement of Beit Shammai</b> in this case. <b>His students said to him:</b> Our <b>teacher, how you have weighed [<i>he’erakhta</i>] us down</b> with this stringent ruling. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: It is preferable that I weigh you down in this world, so that</b> you do not sin by engaging in prohibited intercourse, i.e., so that <b>your days in the World-to-Come will be lengthened [<i>sheya’arikhu</i>].</b>

### Part 6
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira says: From the statements of all of them,</b> i.e., both Beit Shammai, who permit engaging in intercourse a second time only after an examination, and Beit Hillel, who rule that the second examination must be performed only after the final act of intercourse of the night, <b>we can learn</b> that their dispute relates only to that which is permitted after the fact. But <b>a pious person [<i>ba’al nefesh</i>] should not engage in intercourse and repeat</b> his act without an examination between each act.

### Part 7
<b>Rava says:</b> Even a pious person <b>may engage in intercourse and repeat</b> the act without an examination in between, as <b>when that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a woman who handles <b>pure items.</b> But with regard to intercourse with her husband, there is no cause for concern.

### Part 8
<b>This</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> i.e., that a woman must examine herself before and after every act of intercourse according to Beit Shammai, or before the first act and after the last act, according to Beit Hillel? It was said <b>with regard to</b> a woman who handles <b>pure items; but</b> a woman <b>is permitted to her husband</b> even without any examination, and he is not required to ask her if she is pure. <b>But in what</b> case <b>is this</b> lenient <b>statement said? When</b> her husband traveled and <b>left her with the presumptive status of ritual purity. But</b> if he <b>left her with the presumptive status of ritual impurity,</b> she remains <b>forever in her presumptive status</b> of impurity <b>until she says to him: I am pure.</b>

### Part 9
§ <b>Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If a woman <b>examined</b> herself at night <b>with a cloth, and</b> the cloth <b>was</b> then immediately <b>lost, it is prohibited for her to engage in intercourse</b> again <b>until she examines</b> herself with another cloth, as perhaps there was blood on the cloth that was lost. <b>Rabbi Ila objects to this: If</b> this cloth <b>were intact,</b> i.e., if it were not lost, <b>couldn’t</b> this woman <b>engage in intercourse</b> with her husband that night, on the basis that she will examine the cloth only the following day, <b>and</b> isn’t this the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though she does not know</b> at the time of intercourse whether there is blood on the cloth? <b>Now too,</b> although the cloth is lost, <b>let her engage in intercourse</b> with her husband.

### Part 10
<b>Rava said to him:</b> There is a difference between the two cases, as when the cloth is intact, <b>this</b> woman’s <b>proof exists,</b> and if she discovers on the following day that she was impure they will be obligated to bring sin offerings for engaging in intercourse in a state of ritual impurity. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that</b> woman who lost her cloth, <b>her proof does not exist,</b> and therefore they will never know if they require atonement.

### Part 11
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: It is prohibited for a person to engage in intercourse by day. Rav Hamnuna says: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? <b>As it is stated: “Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night on which it was said: Conceived is a man-child”</b> (Job 3:3). It is derived from here that <b>nighttime is meant for conception, but daytime is not meant for conception. Reish Lakish says</b> that the proof is <b>from here: “But he who despises his ways shall die”</b> (Proverbs 19:16). One might see something unpleasing in his wife in the daylight and come to despise her.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And how does Reish Lakish interpret this verse</b> cited <b>by Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>he requires</b> that verse <b>for that which Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa taught. As Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa interpreted</b> that verse in the following manner: <b>That angel that is appointed over conception is called: Night. And</b> that angel <b>takes</b> the <b>drop</b> of semen from which a person will be formed <b>and presents it before the Holy One, Blessed be He, and says before Him: Master of the Universe, what will be of this drop?</b> Will the person fashioned from it be <b>mighty or weak?</b> Will he be <b>clever or stupid?</b> Will he be <b>wealthy or poor?</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara notes: <b>But</b> this angel <b>does not say:</b> Will he be <b>wicked or righteous?</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina said: Everything is in the hand of Heaven, except for fear of Heaven.</b> People have free will to serve God or not, <b>as it is stated: “And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you other than to fear</b> the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 10:12). The fact that God asks of the Jewish people to fear Him indicates that it is a person’s choice to do so.

### Part 14
The Gemara explains: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> derives two <i>halakhot</i> from the verse “and the night on which it was said: Conceived is a man-child,” as he holds as follows: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if it is referring only to the statement of the angel, <b>let the verse write:</b> And the night that said: <b>A man-child is conceived. What</b> is the meaning of: <b>“Conceived is a man-child”?</b> It is derived from the juxtaposition of the word “night” and the word “conceived” that <b>nighttime is meant for conception but daytime is not meant for conception.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan, how does he interpret that verse</b> cited <b>by Reish Lakish?</b> The Gemara answers that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>requires</b> that verse: “But he who despises his ways shall die,” <b>to</b> teach <b>that which is written in the book of ben Sira: Three</b> people <b>I have hated, and a fourth I have not loved: A minister who frequents [<i>hanirgal</i>] drinking houses,</b> as he disgraces himself and leads himself to ruin and death; <b>and some say</b> a different version of the text: <b>A minister who chats [<i>hanirgan</i>]</b> in drinking houses; <b>and some say</b> a third version: <b>A minister who is short-tempered [<i>hanirgaz</i>]</b> when in drinking houses.

### Part 16
That is the first that he hated. <b>And</b> the others are <b>one who dwells at the highest point of the city,</b> where everyone sees him; <b>and one who holds</b> his <b>penis and urinates. And</b> the fourth, whom he has not loved, is <b>one who enters the house of another suddenly,</b> without warning. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And</b> this includes <b>even</b> one who comes <b>into his</b> own <b>house</b> without prior warning, as the members of his household might be engaged in private activities.

### Part 17
The Gemara cites a similar saying. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Four matters the Holy One, Blessed be He, hates, and I do not love them,</b> and they are: <b>One who enters his house suddenly, and needless to say</b> one who suddenly enters <b>the house of another; and one who holds</b> his <b>penis and urinates;</b>
