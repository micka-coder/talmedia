### Part 1
<b>continuously discharging</b> menstrual <b>blood, their</b> time is <b>sufficient</b> for <b>all their days of pregnancy and their</b> time is <b>sufficient</b> for <b>all their days of nursing.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon</b> all <b>say: They said</b> that <b>her time is sufficient only with regard to</b> the <b>first sighting</b> of blood, <b>but with regard to the second</b> sighting, her status is like that of any other woman, and she <b>transmits impurity for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period or from examination to examination.</b>

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And if she saw</b> the <b>first</b> sighting as a result of unnatural circumstances, then even with regard to the second sighting her time is sufficient. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If she <b>jumped and saw</b> menstrual blood, and again she <b>jumped and saw</b> menstrual blood, and a third time she <b>jumped and saw</b> menstrual blood, she has <b>established a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> occurrence has she established a fixed cycle? <b>If we say</b> that it is a cycle <b>of days</b> alone, <b>this</b> cannot be correct, <b>as every day that she did not jump,</b> she also <b>did not see</b> menstrual blood. Therefore, her cycle cannot be a mere pattern of days.

### Part 3
The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> the established menstrual cycle is caused <b>by jumps,</b> i.e., by observing a pattern of jumping and seeing blood three times, she has established that jumping causes the onset of her menstrual period. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Any</b> woman who <b>establishes</b> a pattern of seeing menstrual blood <b>due to</b> a recurring <b>accident,</b> even if the pattern repeats, still has <b>not established a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle?</b> An accidental menstrual pattern brought about by external causes does not create a menstrual cycle. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that the <i>baraita</i> means that she has <b>not established a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle at all?</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that she has <b>not established a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle of days alone, nor of jumps alone, but</b> she has <b>established a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle for</b> a combination of <b>days and of jumps.</b> In other words, she has established a fixed menstrual cycle when she jumps on specific days. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that she does not establish a cycle <b>for days alone?</b> Why is it necessary to state this? <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> It is necessary to teach this in a case <b>where</b> she <b>jumped on Sunday and saw</b> menstrual blood, <b>and</b> again she <b>jumped on Sunday and saw</b> menstrual blood, <b>and</b> then <b>on</b> the following <b>Shabbat she jumped and did not see</b> blood, <b>but on Sunday,</b> the next day, <b>she saw</b> menstrual blood <b>without jumping.</b>

### Part 5
Rav Ashi explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that the <b>matter</b> is <b>revealed retroactively that it</b> was <b>the day that caused</b> her to experience menstruation <b>and</b> not the <b>jumping,</b> and therefore she has established a menstrual cycle of menstruating on Sundays, regardless of jumping, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> it was <b>also</b> the jumping <b>of yesterday,</b> on Shabbat, that <b>caused</b> the menstruation today, on Sunday. <b>And</b> as for the fact <b>that she did not see</b> menstrual blood then, that was <b>because the time</b> when <b>jumping</b> causes menstruation had <b>not</b> yet <b>arrived.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara presents <b>another version</b> of Rav Huna’s statement. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If a woman <b>jumped and saw</b> menstrual blood, and again she <b>jumped and saw</b> menstrual blood, and a third time she <b>jumped and saw</b> menstrual blood, she has <b>established a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle for</b> a pattern of <b>days and not for</b> a pattern of <b>jumps.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? Rav Ashi says:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> she <b>jumped on Sunday and saw</b> menstrual blood, <b>and</b> then again she <b>jumped on Sunday and saw</b> menstrual blood, <b>and</b> then <b>on</b> the following <b>Shabbat she jumped and did not see</b> blood, <b>but on Sunday,</b> the next day, <b>she saw</b> menstrual blood <b>without jumping.</b> In that case <b>there,</b> the <b>matter</b> is <b>revealed retroactively</b> that it is <b>the day that causes</b> her to menstruate, not the jumping.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Although</b> the Rabbis <b>said</b> that for a woman with a fixed menstrual cycle <b>her time is sufficient</b> and she does not transmit impurity retroactively, <b>she is required to examine herself</b> each day to ensure that she is ritually pure and will not impurify pure items that she is handling. All women must examine themselves each day <b>except for a menstruating woman,</b> whose impure status is known, <b>and</b> a woman after childbirth <b>who is observing</b> the period of the <b>blood of purity,</b> whose ritually pure status is known even if she experiences bleeding.

### Part 8
<b>And</b> even a woman with a fixed menstrual cycle <b>engages in intercourse while</b> using <b>examination cloths</b> to ascertain whether her menstrual flow began, <b>except for</b> a woman after childbirth <b>who is observing</b> the period of the <b>blood of purity, and a virgin whose blood is ritually pure</b> for four days after engaging in intercourse for the first time.

### Part 9
<b>And she is required to examine</b> herself <b>twice</b> each day: In the <b>morning,</b> to ascertain if she menstruated during the night, <b>and</b> at <b>twilight,</b> to ascertain if she menstruated during the day. <b>And</b> she is also required to examine herself <b>at a time that she is about to engage in intercourse with her husband.</b> The obligation of <b>women of priestly</b> families is <b>greater than</b> that of other women, as they are also required to examine themselves <b>when they</b> seek to <b>partake of <i>teruma</i>. Rabbi Yehuda says: Even when they conclude partaking of <i>teruma</i></b> they are required to examine themselves, in order to ascertain whether they experienced bleeding while partaking of <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: All women must examine themselves each day, <b>except for a menstruating woman.</b> The Gemara explains: Such a woman does not need to examine herself, <b>as during the days of her menstruation</b> she <b>does not need examination.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, who said</b> that <b>a woman</b> can <b>establish a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle</b> even <b>during the days</b> that she <b>has <i>zava</i> status, but a woman does not establish a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle during the days of her</b> impurity due to <b>menstruation,</b> as any bleeding during these seven days is merely a continuation of her original menstruation. According to this opinion, it is <b>well,</b> and one can understand the mishna. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said</b> that <b>a woman</b> can <b>establish a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle during the days of her menstruation, let her examine</b> herself, as <b>perhaps</b> she will <b>establish a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could <b>say to you: When I say</b> that a woman can establish a fixed menstrual cycle during the days of her menstruation, that applies only in a case <b>where</b> the first two instances of her fixed cycle were established when she first <b>saw</b> blood <b>from a stopped source,</b> i.e., she saw blood on those particulars days at the outset of her period. <b>But</b> when she first <b>saw</b> blood <b>from an open source,</b> i.e., when the first two instances that she experienced bleeding on those particular days was in the middle of her menstrual period, <b>I did not say</b> that she establishes a fixed menstrual cycle, and therefore there is no need for her to examine herself.

### Part 13
§ The mishna teaches: All women must examine themselves each day, except for a menstruating woman, whose impure status is known, <b>and</b> a woman after childbirth <b>who is observing</b> the period of the <b>blood of purity.</b> The Gemara explains: It may <b>enter your mind</b> that when the mishna mentions a woman who is observing the period of the blood of purity, it is referring to one who is finishing the period of impurity following a birth and is <b>anticipating observing</b> the period <b>of</b> the <b>blood of purity.</b> In other words, her days of impurity are ending and she is about to start her days `of purity, and the mishna is stating that there is no need for an examination to conclude her days of impurity before starting her days of purity.

### Part 14
The Gemara analyzes the mishna in accordance with this interpretation. <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who said</b> that blood after birth and blood of purity both come from <b>one source,</b> and <b>the Torah deemed</b> blood after birth <b>impure, and the Torah deemed</b> blood of purity <b>pure.</b> According to this opinion, it is <b>well,</b> and one can understand the mishna, since even if she emits blood continuously through the end of her days of impurity into her days of purity, the blood during her days of purity is pure.

### Part 15
But <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Levi, who said</b> that <b>there are two</b> distinct <b>sources,</b> one for blood after birth and one for blood of purity, <b>she should</b> be required to <b>examine</b> herself at the end of the period following birth, as <b>perhaps that impure source</b> of blood after birth had <b>not yet stopped</b> flowing. The Gemara explains that <b>Levi</b> could <b>say to you:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> ruling?
