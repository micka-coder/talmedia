### Part 1
<b>and not</b> if it was in <b>the interior of its interior,</b> i.e., contained within something else, such as a fold, which is inside the vessel, therefore Rava <b>teaches us</b> that a fold in one’s body is not considered like the interior of the interior of a vessel. Rather, this definition applies only when the carcass of the creeping animal was actually inside another vessel whose opening was outside the oven.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the folds in the body with regard to ritual impurity. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> If there was <b>a pole</b> or a stick placed <b>in the folds of</b> an individual impure with the impurity of <b>a <i>zav</i>, and he moved a ritually pure</b> person <b>with it,</b> that individual is <b>pure,</b> despite the fact that a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity by moving an item. If the <b>pole</b> was placed <b>in the folds of one who is pure, and he moved the <i>zav</i> with it,</b> the pure individual is thereby rendered <b>impure,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> of one who carries a <i>zav</i>.

### Part 3
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that if a <i>zav</i> moved another with a pole in his own folds he does not render the other person impure? <b>As the verse states: “And whoever a <i>zav</i> touches, without having rinsed his hands in water,</b> he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water” (Leviticus 15:11). <b>This is</b> referring to the impurity imparted by <b>the movement of a <i>zav</i>, as we have not found an impurity</b> similar <b>to it in the entire Torah.</b> Only a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity to items by moving them.

### Part 4
<b>And the Merciful One expresses</b> this impurity imparted <b>by</b> movement using <b>the language of touch,</b> in order <b>to say that</b> the <b>moving and touch</b> of a <i>zav</i> <b>are like his hands: Just as there,</b> with regard to the impurity imparted by contact with the hands, it occurs <b>external</b> to the body, <b>so too here,</b> impurity by means of movement applies only to moving an item with the <b>external</b> portions of the body of the <i>zav</i>.

### Part 5
§ The mishna teaches that a woman becomes ritually impure with the flow of blood from the uterus into the vagina, even if it did not leave the woman’s body. <b>But the <i>zav</i> and one who experiences a seminal emission do not become ritually impure</b> until their emission of impurity emerges outside the body. The Gemara explains: This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a <i>zav</i>, as it is written: “When</b> any man <b>has an issue out of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 15:2). The verse teaches that a <i>zav</i> is not impure <b>until his issue emerges out of his flesh.</b> With regard to <b>one who experiences a seminal emission,</b> the reason is <b>that it is written: “And if the flow of seed goes out from a man”</b> (Leviticus 15:16), which indicates that the flow must exit his body.

### Part 6
§ The mishna further states that if a priest <b>was partaking of <i>teruma</i> and sensed</b> a quaking in his limbs, indicating that a seminal emission was imminent, he should firmly hold his penis to prevent the emission from leaving his body, and swallow the <i>teruma</i> while ritually pure. The Gemara asks: May one <b>hold</b> his penis? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Anyone who holds</b> his <b>penis and urinates</b> is considered <b>as though he is bringing a deluge to the world,</b> as masturbation was one of the sins that led to the flood?

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said,</b> in resolution of this difficulty, that the mishna is referring to one who holds his penis <b>with a coarse cloth. Rava said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is referring to a priest who holds his penis <b>with a soft cloth,</b> and the reason it is permitted is that <b>once</b> the semen <b>has</b> already <b>been uprooted</b> from his body, it is <b>uprooted,</b> and his subsequent holding of the penis, even with a soft cloth, does not increase the flow of semen. <b>And Abaye</b> prohibits the use of a soft cloth, as he is <b>concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> one might <b>come to increase</b> the emission of semen, due to the contact of this cloth. <b>But Rava is not concerned</b> that one might <b>come to increase</b> the emission.

### Part 8
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the opinion of Rava. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>To what is this</b> holding of a penis <b>comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to</b> one who <b>places a finger in</b> his <b>eye,</b> in <b>that as long as</b> the <b>finger</b> is <b>in the eye,</b> the eye <b>will tear and continue to tear.</b> Here too, the priest’s action will lead to an increased emission of semen.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers that <b>Rava</b> would maintain that if the priest’s limbs were not quaking and the semen was coming out in drops, there is indeed a concern that holding the penis might increase the emission. But when he feels his limbs quaking, this concern does not apply. The reason is that <b>any</b> such event, i.e., <b>a heating</b> of the body that leads to a seminal emission <b>and</b> which is <b>then</b> followed by another <b>heating</b> of that kind <b>at the time</b> when the semen has been uprooted, is <b>uncommon.</b> Consequently, in this case the priest may hold his penis even with a soft cloth.

### Part 10
<b>Shmuel says: Any</b> emission of <b>semen that is not felt by one’s entire body does not render</b> him <b>impure. What is the reason? The Merciful One states: “The flow of seed”</b> (Leviticus 15:16), which indicates that it is referring to an emission <b>that is fit to fertilize,</b> i.e., it is referring only to the kind of emission which is felt as it exits the body.

### Part 11
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 8:3): If one <b>was having</b> sexual <b>thoughts at night and he arose and found</b> that <b>his flesh</b> was <b>warm, he is ritually impure,</b> despite the fact that he did not sense the emission of semen. This shows that the impurity of a seminal emission applies even if one did not feel it in his entire body. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Huna interpreted</b> this mishna as referring <b>to</b> one who <b>engaged in intercourse in his dream. Since it is impossible to engage in intercourse without</b> the accompanying <b>sensation,</b> he certainly must have felt it, despite the fact that he was unaware of this when he awoke.

### Part 12
The Gemara cites <b>another version</b> of the above statement. <b>Shmuel says: Any semen that is not shot like an arrow does not render</b> one <b>impure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> practical difference <b>is there between this version</b> of Shmuel’s ruling <b>and that version</b> of Shmuel’s ruling? The Gemara answers that the difference <b>between them</b> is a case where the semen <b>was uprooted</b> accompanied <b>by a sensation, but it emerged without a sensation.</b> According to the first version the man is rendered impure, as he sensed the uprooting of the semen, whereas according to the second version he is not impure, as this is not considered semen shot like an arrow.

### Part 13
The Gemara notes that this <b>matter, which</b> is <b>obvious to Shmuel, is raised as a dilemma by Rava. As Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If semen <b>was uprooted</b> accompanied <b>by a sensation but it emerged without a sensation, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the man ritually impure or not?

### Part 14
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 8:3): With regard to <b>one who experienced a seminal emission,</b> and <b>who</b> subsequently <b>immersed but did not urinate</b> before doing so, <b>when he</b> later <b>urinates</b> he is rendered <b>impure,</b> as some semen will also be emitted. The reason that he is rendered impure by this emission, which he does not sense, must be because the uprooting of the semen was accompanied by a sensation. The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>There it is different, as the majority</b> of the semen <b>emerged</b> accompanied <b>by a sensation,</b> and therefore he is rendered impure by this small amount even without a sensation.

### Part 15
<b>Some say another version</b> of the previous discussion. <b>Shmuel says: Any semen that is not shot like an arrow cannot fertilize,</b> i.e., impregnate a woman. The Gemara infers: <b>It cannot fertilize, but it does render</b> the man who emits it <b>ritually impure, as it is stated: “If there be among you any man who is not ritually pure by reason of that which happened to him</b> by night” (Deuteronomy 23:11). This teaches that <b>even mere semen</b> which cannot fertilize renders one impure.

### Part 16
<b>Rava raises</b> a similar <b>dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile who had</b> sexual <b>thoughts,</b> on account of which semen was uprooted but not emitted from his body, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>descended and immersed</b> for the purpose of conversion, which means that he is now Jewish, and he then emitted semen, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to his status of ritual purity?

### Part 17
The Gemara explains the dilemma: Even <b>if you say</b> that <b>we follow</b> the moment of <b>uprooting,</b> at which point he was still a gentile, one can maintain that <b>this statement</b> applies only when it entails <b>a stringency,</b> as is the case with regard to a born Jew. <b>But here, where</b> this would lead <b>to a leniency,</b> as the gentile would be ritually pure, perhaps <b>we do not say</b> that one follows the moment of uprooting. <b>Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference</b> in the application of this principle between a born Jew and a convert, but rather, one always follows the moment of uprooting. The Gemara concludes that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 18
<b>Rava raises</b> a further <b>dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a woman who experienced a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period [<i>zava</i>], whose urine,</b> which imparts impurity like all liquids that she discharges vaginally, <b>was uprooted</b> but not emitted from her body, <b>and she descended</b> to the ritual bath <b>and immersed</b> to purify herself from her <i>ziva</i>, and urinated afterward, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 19
The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: Even <b>if you say</b> that generally <b>we follow</b> the moment of <b>uprooting,</b> and therefore she should be impure, since the urine was uprooted when she was a <i>zava</i>, nevertheless one can claim that <b>this statement</b> applies only with regard to <b>semen, as</b> the man <b>cannot hold it</b> back from emission. <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>urine of</b> a <i>zava</i>, <b>which she can hold in,</b> one does <b>not</b> follow the moment of uprooting. <b>Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference</b> in the application of this principle between urine and semen, but rather, in both cases one follows the moment of uprooting. Here too, the Gemara concludes that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 20
<b>Rava raises</b> yet another <b>dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile <i>zava</i>,</b> who is not impure by Torah law, although by rabbinic law she is considered a <i>zava</i> in all regards, <b>whose urine was uprooted</b> when she was a gentile,
