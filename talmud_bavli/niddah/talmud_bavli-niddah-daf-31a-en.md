### Part 1
<b>What is the verse</b> from which it is derived that a fetus is administered an oath on the day of its birth? “Upon You I have relied from birth; <b>You are He Who took me out [<i>gozi</i>] of my mother’s womb”</b> (Psalms 71:6). <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> word: <b>“<i>Gozi</i>,” is a term of administering an oath? As it is written: “Cut off [<i>gozi</i>] your hair and cast it away”</b> (Jeremiah 7:29), which is interpreted as a reference to the vow of a nazirite, who must cut off his hair at the end of his term of naziriteship.

### Part 2
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says: To what is a fetus in its mother’s womb comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to a nut placed in a basin</b> full <b>of water,</b> floating on top of the water. If <b>a person puts his finger on top of</b> the nut, <b>it sinks</b> either <b>in this direction or in that direction.</b>

### Part 3
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: During <b>the first three months</b> of pregnancy, the <b>fetus resides in the lower compartment</b> of the womb; in the <b>middle</b> three months, the <b>fetus resides in the middle compartment;</b> and during the <b>last</b> three months of pregnancy the <b>fetus resides in the upper compartment. And once its time to emerge arrives, it turns upside down and emerges; and this is</b> what causes <b>labor pains.</b>

### Part 4
With regard to the assertion that labor pains are caused by the fetus turning upside down, the Gemara notes: <b>And this is</b> the explanation for <b>that which we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The labor pains experienced by</b> a woman who gives birth to <b>a female are greater than</b> those <b>experienced by</b> a woman who gives birth to <b>a male.</b> The Gemara will explain this below.

### Part 5
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived that a fetus initially resides in the lower part of the womb? <b>“When I was made in secret, and I was woven together in the lowest parts of the earth”</b> (Psalms 139:15). Since it <b>is not stated: I resided</b> in the lowest parts of the earth, <b>but rather: “I was woven together</b> in the lowest parts of the earth,” this teaches that during the initial stage of a fetus’s development, when it is woven together, its location is in the lower compartment of the womb.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>the labor pains experienced by</b> a woman who gives birth to <b>a female,</b> that they <b>are greater than those experienced by</b> a woman who gives birth to <b>a male?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> one, a male fetus, <b>emerges in the manner in which it engages in intercourse.</b> Just as a male engages in intercourse facing downward, so too, it is born while facing down. <b>And that</b> one, a female fetus, <b>emerges in the manner in which it engages in intercourse,</b> i.e., facing upward. Consequently, <b>that</b> one, a female fetus, <b>turns its face around</b> before it is born, <b>but this</b> one, a male fetus, <b>does not turn its face around</b> before it is born.

### Part 7
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: During <b>the first three months</b> of pregnancy, <b>sexual intercourse is difficult</b> and harmful <b>for the woman and is also difficult for the offspring.</b> During the <b>middle</b> three months, intercourse is <b>difficult for the woman but is beneficial for the offspring.</b> During the <b>last</b> three months, sexual intercourse is <b>beneficial for the woman and beneficial for the offspring; as a result of it the offspring is found to be strong and fair skinned.</b>

### Part 8
The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who engages in intercourse</b> with his wife <b>on the ninetieth day</b> of her pregnancy, <b>it is as though he spills</b> her <b>blood.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How does one know</b> that it is the ninetieth day of her pregnancy? <b>Rather, Abaye says: One should go ahead and engage in intercourse</b> with his wife even if it might be the ninetieth day, <b>and</b> rely on God to prevent any ensuing harm, as the verse states: <b>“The Lord preserves the simple”</b> (Psalms 116:6).

### Part 9
§ <b>The Sages taught: There are three partners in</b> the creation of <b>a person: The Holy One, Blessed be He, and his father, and his mother. His father emits the white seed, from which</b> the following body parts are formed: The <b>bones,</b> the <b>sinews,</b> the <b>nails,</b> the <b>brain that is in its head, and</b> the <b>white of the eye. His mother emits red seed, from which</b> are formed the <b>skin,</b> the <b>flesh,</b> the <b>hair, and</b> the <b>black of the eye. And the Holy One, Blessed be He, inserts into him a spirit, a soul,</b> his <b>countenance [<i>ukelaster</i>], eyesight, hearing of the ear,</b> the capability of <b>speech</b> of <b>the mouth,</b> the capability of <b>walking</b> with <b>the legs, understanding, and wisdom.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And when</b> a person’s <b>time to depart from the world arrives, the Holy One, Blessed be He, retrieves His part, and He leaves the part of</b> the person’s <b>father and mother before them. Rav Pappa said: This</b> is in accordance with the adage <b>that people say: Remove the salt</b> from a piece of meat, <b>and</b> you may then <b>toss the meat to a dog,</b> as it has become worthless.

### Part 11
§ <b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Who does great deeds beyond comprehension, wondrous deeds without number”</b> (Job 9:10)? <b>Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is unlike the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He. The attribute of flesh and blood</b> is that if one <b>puts an article in a flask,</b> even if the flask is <b>tied and its opening</b> faces <b>upward, it is uncertain whether</b> the item <b>is preserved</b> from getting lost, <b>and it is uncertain whether it is not preserved</b> from being lost. <b>But the Holy One, Blessed be He, forms the fetus in a woman’s open womb, and its opening</b> faces <b>downward, and</b> yet the fetus <b>is preserved.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Another matter</b> that demonstrates the difference between the attributes of God and the attributes of people is that when <b>a person places his articles on a scale</b> to be measured, <b>the heavier</b> the item <b>is,</b> the more <b>it descends. But</b> when <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> forms a fetus, <b>the heavier the offspring gets,</b> the more <b>it ascends upward</b> in the womb.

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; wonderful are Your works, and that my soul knows very well”</b> (Psalms 139:14)? <b>Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is unlike the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He. The attribute of flesh and blood</b> is that when <b>a person plants seeds</b> of different species <b>in</b> one <b>garden bed, each and every one</b> of the seeds <b>emerges</b> as a grown plant <b>according to its species. But the Holy One, Blessed be He, forms the fetus in a woman’s womb, and all of</b> the seeds, i.e., those of both the father and the mother, <b>emerge</b> when the offspring is formed <b>as one</b> sex.

### Part 14
<b>Alternatively,</b> when <b>a dyer puts herbs in a cauldron [<i>leyora</i>], they all emerge as one color</b> of dye, <b>whereas the Holy One, Blessed be He, forms the fetus in a woman’s womb,</b> and <b>each and every one</b> of the seeds <b>emerges as its own type.</b> In other words, the seed of the father form distinct elements, such as the white of the eye, and the seed of the mother forms other elements, such as the black of the eye, as explained above.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Yosef taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And on that day you shall say: <b>I will give thanks to You, Lord, for You were angry with me; Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me”</b> (Isaiah 12:1)? <b>With regard to what</b> matter <b>is the verse speaking?</b>

### Part 16
It is referring, for example, <b>to two people who left</b> their homes to go <b>on a business</b> trip. <b>A thorn penetrated</b> the body <b>of one of them,</b> and he was consequently unable to go with his colleague. <b>He started blaspheming and cursing</b> in frustration. <b>After a period of time, he heard that the ship of the other</b> person <b>had sunk in the sea,</b> and realized that the thorn had saved him from death. He then <b>started thanking</b> God <b>and praising</b> Him for his delivery due to the slight pain caused to him by the thorn. This is the meaning of the statement: I will give thanks to You, Lord, for You were angry with me. <b>Therefore, it is stated</b> at the end of the verse: <b>“Your anger is turned away, and You comfort me.”</b>

### Part 17
<b>And this</b> statement <b>is</b> identical to <b>that which Rabbi Elazar said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, <b>Who does wondrous things alone; and blessed be His glorious name forever”</b> (Psalms 72:18–19)? What does it mean that God “does wondrous things alone”? It means that <b>even the one for whom the miracle was performed does not recognize the miracle</b> that was performed for <b>him.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “You measure [<i>zerita</i>] my going about [<i>orḥi</i>] and my lying down [<i>riv’i</i>], and are acquainted with all my ways”</b> (Psalms 139:3)? This verse <b>teaches that a person is not created from the entire drop</b> of semen, <b>but from its clear</b> part. <i>Zerita</i> can mean to winnow, while <i>orḥi</i> and <i>riv’i</i> can both be explained as references to sexual intercourse. Therefore the verse is interpreted homiletically as saying that God separates the procreative part of the semen from the rest. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught a parable:</b> This matter is comparable <b>to a person who winnows</b> grain <b>in the granary; he takes the food and leaves the waste.</b>

### Part 19
This is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu, as Rabbi Abbahu raises a contradiction: It is written</b> in one of King David’s psalms: <b>“For You have girded me [<i>vatazreni</i>] with strength for battle”</b> (II Samuel 22:40), without the letter <i>alef</i> in <i>vatazreni</i>; <b>and it is written</b> in another psalm: <b>“Who girds me [<i>hame’azreni</i>] with strength”</b> (Psalms 18:33), with an <i>alef</i> in <i>hame’azreini</i>. What is the difference between these two expressions? <b>David said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, You selected me [<i>zeiritani</i>],</b> i.e., You separated between the procreative part and the rest of the semen in order to create me, <b>and You have girded me [<i>zeraztani</i>] with strength.</b>

### Part 20
<b>Rabbi Abbahu taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> in Balaam’s blessing: <b>“Who has counted the dust of Jacob, or numbered the stock [<i>rova</i>] of Israel”</b> (Numbers 23:10)? The verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits and counts the times that the Jewish people engage in intercourse [<i>revi’iyyoteihem</i>],</b> anticipating the time <b>when the drop from which the righteous person will be created will arrive.</b>

### Part 21
<b>And</b> it was <b>due to this matter</b> that <b>the eye of wicked Balaam went blind. He said: Should</b> God, <b>who is pure and holy, and whose ministers are pure and holy, peek at this matter? Immediately his eye was blinded</b> as a divine punishment, <b>as it is written: “The saying of the man whose eye is shut”</b> (Numbers 24:3).

### Part 22
<b>And this</b> statement <b>is</b> the same as that <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written,</b> with regard to Leah’s conceiving Issachar: <b>“And he lay with her that night”</b> (Genesis 30:16)? The verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, contributed to that act.</b> The manner in which God contributed to this act is derived from another verse, <b>as it is stated: “Issachar is a large-boned [<i>garem</i>] donkey”</b> (Genesis 49:14). This teaches that God directed Jacob’s <b>donkey</b> toward Leah’s tent so that he would engage in intercourse with her, thereby <b>causing [<i>garam</i>]</b> Leah’s conceiving <b>Issachar.</b>

### Part 23
§ <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> The sex of a fetus is determined at the moment of conception. If the <b>woman emits seed first, she gives birth to a male,</b> and if the <b>man emits seed first, she gives birth to a female, as it is stated: “If a woman bears seed and gives birth to a male”</b> (Leviticus 12:2).

### Part 24
<b>The Sages taught: At first,</b> people <b>would say</b> that if the <b>woman emits seed first she gives birth to a male,</b> and if the <b>man emits seed first, she gives birth to a female. But the Sages did not explain</b> from which verse this <b>matter</b> is derived, <b>until Rabbi Tzadok came and explained</b> that <b>it</b> is derived from the following verse: <b>“These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, with his daughter Dinah”</b> (Genesis 46:15). From the fact that the verse <b>attributes the males to the females,</b> as the males are called: The sons of Leah, <b>and</b> it attributes <b>the females to the males,</b>in that Dinah is called: His daughter, it is derived that if the woman emits seed first she gives birth to a male, whereas if the man emits seed first, she bears a female.

### Part 25
This statement is also derived from the following verse: <b>“And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of valor, archers, and had many sons and sons’ sons”</b> (I Chronicles 8:40). <b>Is it in a person’s power to have many sons and sons’ sons? Rather, because</b>
