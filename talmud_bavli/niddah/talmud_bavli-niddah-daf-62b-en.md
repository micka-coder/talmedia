### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi,</b> with regard to his statement: <b>Does</b> the <b>matter</b> of purity or impurity <b>depend on</b> whether or not one is <b>particular</b> about the blood stain? If the items he handled on the garment between the first and second washings are ritually pure, then any items he handled after the second washing should likewise be pure.

### Part 2
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Yes,</b> the status of purity depends upon whether or not the owner of the garment is particular about the stain. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya says:</b> If one finds <b>blood</b> on a garment that is <b>certainly from a menstruating woman</b> and therefore renders the garment impure, one <b>may apply</b> the <b>seven substances</b> listed in the mishna <b>to it and</b> thereby <b>nullify it</b> from being considered a blood stain at all, even if the stain is not completely removed. And he may then immerse the garment in a ritual bath and it is ritually pure.

### Part 3
Rav Ashi analyzes this ruling: <b>But why</b> is the garment pure? After all, <b>it</b> has <b>blood from a menstruating woman</b> on it. <b>Evidently,</b> the <b>matter</b> of whether or not it is ritually pure <b>depends upon</b> whether or not the owner of the garment <b>is particular</b> about the blood stain. <b>So too</b> here, the <b>matter</b> of whether or not it is ritually pure <b>depends upon</b> whether or not the owner of the garment <b>is particular</b> about the blood stain.

### Part 4
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (see <i>Kelim</i> 9:5): In a case of <b>pottery,</b> i.e., a chamber pot, <b>that a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>] has used</b> and <b>that has absorbed</b> impure <b>liquids</b> from the <i>zav</i>, <b>and</b> it then <b>fell into the air of an oven, and the oven was</b> subsequently <b>heated, the oven is impure, as</b> the impure <b>liquid will eventually emerge</b> from the chamber pot due to the heat of the oven.

### Part 5
The <i>amora’im</i> disagree with regard to the correct interpretation of this mishna. <b>Reish Lakish says: They taught</b> that the oven is impure once it is heated <b>only</b> with regard to <b>liquids</b> of <b>lesser</b> ritual impurity, i.e., that are not primary sources of impurity, such as the tears or urine of one who was rendered impure by contact with a corpse. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>liquids</b> of <b>greater</b> ritual impurity, e.g., urine of a <i>zav</i> or <i>zava</i>, the oven is <b>impure even though the oven was not heated. Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>both liquids</b> of <b>lesser</b> ritual impurity <b>and liquids</b> of <b>greater</b> ritual impurity that fell into an oven, <b>if the oven was heated,</b> then <b>yes,</b> the oven is impure, but <b>if</b> the oven was <b>not</b> heated, it is <b>not</b> impure.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from the mishna: If <b>one immersed</b> the garment with the stain whose nature is unknown, <b>and</b> then <b>handled ritually pure items with</b> the garment, and then <b>applied</b> these <b>seven substances to</b> the stain <b>and it did not disappear, that</b> stain <b>is</b> presumably from <b>a dye, and</b> therefore <b>the ritually pure items are ritually pure, and he need not immerse</b> the garment again, as there is no impurity. Rabbi Yoḥanan understands that the stain is not definitely from a dye; even if it is from blood, such blood that is absorbed into the garment to the degree that it does not come out after this process is performed, does not impart ritual impurity. The same should apply in the case of the oven, i.e., the liquids should impart impurity only when the oven is heated and they actually emerge.

### Part 7
Reish Lakish <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan in response: <b>Leave</b> aside blood <b>stains,</b> i.e., one cannot cite a proof from them, as they impart impurity <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and for this reason the Sages were lenient and ruled that they do not impart impurity until they actually emerge. But with regard to liquids that are impure by Torah law, the <i>halakha</i> is different.

### Part 8
Rabbi Yoḥanan raises another objection to Reish Lakish: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach:</b> If one finds <b>blood</b> on a garment that is <b>certainly from a menstruating woman</b> and therefore renders the garment impure, one <b>may apply</b> the <b>seven substances</b> listed in the mishna <b>to it and nullify</b> the stain from being considered a blood stain at all, even if the stain is not entirely removed; and he may then immerse the garment in a ritual bath and it is ritually pure?

### Part 9
Reish Lakish <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan in response: You cannot raise an objection to me from the <i>baraita</i> of Rabbi Ḥiyya, since if <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>did not teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> in the Mishna, <b>from where</b> did <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> learn it? Rabbi Ḥiyya was a student of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, and therefore he could not have included a <i>halakha</i> that contradicts the Mishna. Consequently, this statement in his name must be erroneous.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Reish Lakish</b> from a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:2): With regard to <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood</b> from a corpse <b>that was absorbed in</b> the floor of <b>a house,</b> every vessel in <b>the house is ritually impure</b> by virtue of being under the same roof as the blood. The Gemara parenthetically notes: <b>And some say</b> that the mishna states that every vessel in <b>the house is ritually pure. And</b> these two statements <b>do not disagree,</b> as <b>this</b> first statement was issued <b>in</b> reference to <b>vessels that</b> were in the house <b>at the outset,</b> before the blood became absorbed; and <b>this</b> second statement was issued <b>in</b> reference to <b>vessels that</b> came into the house <b>at the end,</b> after the blood had already been absorbed.

### Part 11
The mishna continues: In a case where the blood <b>was absorbed in a garment,</b> it is examined. <b>If</b> the garment <b>is washed and a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood emerges from it, it is ritually impure</b> and it imparts impurity to the vessels in the house as well. <b>But if not,</b> then <b>it is pure,</b> and it does not impart impurity. Apparently, only blood that can be removed from a garment is considered blood, whereas blood absorbed in the garment is insignificant. This is in accordance with the opinion that an absorbed substance does not impart ritual impurity, even if it can be removed in some manner.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Kahana said</b> in response: <b>They taught here</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> among <b>the leniencies</b> that apply to the measurement <b>of a quarter-</b><i>log</i>. That is, this case <b>is different,</b> as the mishna is referring to <b>the blood of submission</b> discharged from a body at the time of death, and such blood is ritually impure <b>by rabbinic law.</b> But in general, a ritually impure liquid that is absorbed into an item does impart impurity.

### Part 13
<b>Reish Lakish raised an objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> from a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:2): <b>Any</b> liquid <b>that is absorbed</b> but <b>that is unable to emerge is pure.</b> Reish Lakish infers from this mishna that if <b>it is able to emerge it is impure, and</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though it has not</b> yet <b>emerged.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> in defense of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion: <b>Anywhere that</b> the liquid <b>is unable to emerge and</b> the owner of the garment <b>is not particular about it,</b> i.e., he is not bothered that this liquid is absorbed within the garment, <b>everyone,</b> i.e., both Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, <b>agrees</b> that the garment <b>is pure.</b> If the liquid <b>is able to emerge and</b> the owner of the garment <b>is particular about it</b> and does not want it in his garment, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the garment <b>is impure.</b>

### Part 15
<b>They disagree when</b> the liquid <b>is able to emerge and</b> the owner <b>is not particular about it.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Reish Lakish, <b>holds</b> that <b>since</b> the liquid <b>is able to emerge, even though</b> the owner <b>is not particular about it,</b> the garment is impure. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that <b>even though</b> the liquid <b>is able to emerge,</b>
