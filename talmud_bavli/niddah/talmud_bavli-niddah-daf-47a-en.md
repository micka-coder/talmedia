### Part 1
it is <b>subject to the obligation</b> of separating <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> the portion of the dough designated for the priest. <b>And</b> although <i>teruma</i> fell into it, that produce does not have the status of <i>teruma</i>, as the <i>teruma</i> was nullified by a majority of non-sacred produce. Consequently, <b>it is not rendered unfit</b> for consumption, i.e., rendered ritually impure, <b>by one</b> who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for his purification process to be completed. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon deem</b> the dough <b>exempt from the</b> obligation of separating <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> as this obligation does not apply to <i>teruma</i>, and the entire dough is exempt due to the mixture of <i>teruma</i> it contains.

### Part 2
The Sages <b>assumed</b> that <b>the one who said</b> that <b><i>teruma</i></b> in the present applies <b>by Torah law</b> maintains that <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> likewise applies in the present <b>by Torah law,</b> whereas <b>the one who said</b> that <b><i>teruma</i></b> in the present applies <b>by rabbinic law</b> holds that <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> also applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b> If so, <b>granted, if you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b><i>ḥalla</i> in the present</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> one can understand that <b>a mixture</b> which has the status of <i>teruma</i> <b>by rabbinic law comes and abrogates</b> the obligation of separating <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> which also applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b>

### Part 3
<b>But if you say</b> that <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> in the present applies <b>by Torah law,</b> can <b>a mixture</b> that has the status of <i>teruma</i> <b>by rabbinic law come and abrogate</b> the mitzva of <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> which is <b>by Torah law?</b> Evidently, according to Rabbi Yosei the obligation of separating <i>ḥalla</i> in the present is by rabbinic law, and therefore <i>teruma</i> likewise applies by rabbinic law. If so, Rabbi Yosei does not agree with the opinion he cites in <i>Seder Olam</i>, according to which <i>teruma</i> applies in the present by Torah law.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But perhaps Rabbi Yosei maintains</b> that <b><i>teruma</i> in the present</b> applies <b>by Torah law and</b> yet <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and therefore the mixture discussed in the above <i>baraita</i>, which has the status of <i>teruma</i> by Torah law, abrogates the obligation of <i>ḥalla</i>, which is by rabbinic law.

### Part 5
The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> this answer is <b>as Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, responded</b> to the statement of the other Sages. <b>As Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: I</b> once <b>found the Sages of the study hall of Rav sitting and saying: Even according to the one who said</b> that <b><i>teruma</i> in the present</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> the obligation to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> is <b>by Torah law.</b>

### Part 6
The reason is <b>that</b> during the <b>seven</b> years <b>that</b> the Jewish people <b>conquered</b> Eretz Yisrael led by Joshua <b>and</b> during the <b>seven</b> years <b>that they divided</b> the land, <b>they were obligated to</b> separate <b><i>ḥalla</i> but they were not obligated to</b> separate <i>teruma</i> and <b>tithe.</b> In the present as well, although there is no obligation to set aside <i>teruma</i> in Eretz Yisrael by Torah law, the obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i> applies by Torah law.

### Part 7
Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, continued: <b>And I said to them:</b> On the contrary, <b>even according to the one who said</b> that <b><i>teruma</i> in the present</b> applies <b>by Torah law,</b> the obligation to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> applies <b>by rabbinic law, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>: “When you come into the land where I bring you…from the first of your dough you shall set apart a cake for a gift” (Numbers 15:18–20). <b>If</b> the obligation applies <b>“when you come”</b> into the land, one <b>might</b> have thought that it took effect <b>from</b> the moment <b>that two or three spies entered</b> the land. Therefore <b>the verse states: “When you come,”</b> from which it is derived that the Torah is saying: <b>I said</b> that the obligation applies <b>when all of you come, and not when some of you come.</b>

### Part 8
According to this <i>baraita</i>, the separation of <i>ḥalla</i> is an obligation by Torah law only when the entire Jewish people come to Eretz Yisrael. <b>And when Ezra brought</b> the Jewish people to Eretz Yisrael at the beginning of the Second Temple period, <b>not all of them ascended.</b> Since the majority of the Jewish people stayed behind, separating <i>ḥalla</i> was not restored to the status of an obligation by Torah law.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The Sages stated a parable</b> based on the development of the fruit of a fig tree with regard to the three stages of development <b>in a woman:</b> Minority, young womanhood, and grown womanhood. <b>An unripe fig, a ripening fig, and a ripe fig. An unripe fig</b> represents the stage when <b>she is still a child</b> and has not yet developed the signs of puberty; <b>a ripening fig</b> represents <b>the days of her young womanhood,</b> when she reaches twelve years and one day and has developed two pubic hairs.

### Part 10
With regard to the periods both <b>during this</b> stage, minority, <b>and during that</b> stage, young womanhood, the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>her father is entitled to</b> any lost object that <b>she finds</b> that cannot be returned to its owner, <b>and to her earnings, and to nullification of her vows. A ripe fig</b> represents the stage of grown womanhood: <b>Once she has reached her majority, her father no longer has authority over her.</b> He can no longer nullify her vows, and he does not have a claim to lost objects found by her and her earnings belong to her.

### Part 11
<b>What are the signs</b> that indicate grown womanhood? <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says:</b> Grown womanhood begins <b>from when</b> her breast <b>grows</b> sufficiently so that <b>a fold</b> appears <b>below the breast. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It begins <b>from when the breasts sag</b> onto the chest. <b>Ben Azzai says:</b> It begins <b>from when the areola</b> at the tip of the breast <b>darkens. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It begins when the breasts have developed to <b>a size where</b> a person <b>places his hand on the nipple and it depresses and slows to return.</b>

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that <b>an unripe fig [<i>paga</i>]</b> represents the stage when a woman <b>is still a child.</b> The Gemara explains that the meaning of the word <i>paga</i> is <b>as it is written: “The fig tree puts forth her green fruits [<i>fageha</i>]”</b> (Song of Songs 2:13). The mishna further teaches that <b>a ripening fig [<i>boḥal</i>]</b> represents <b>the days of her young womanhood.</b> The Gemara explains that the meaning of this word is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 1:2): The obligation of tithes applies to <b>the figs from when they begin to ripen [<i>misheyyibaḥalu</i>]; and Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that this means <b>from when the heads</b> of the figs <b>whiten.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara adds: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the source is <b>from here: “For My soul became impatient of them, and their soul also grew in disgust [<i>baḥala</i>] toward Me”</b> (Zechariah 11:8). The verse indicates that this word denotes growth. As for the third term in the mishna, <b>a ripe fig [<i>tzemel</i>],</b> it is <b>as one would say:</b> A fruit <b>has come forth complete [<i>yatzeta mele’a</i>].</b>

### Part 14
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And what are the signs</b> that indicate grown womanhood? <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says:</b> Grown womanhood begins <b>from when</b> her breast <b>grows</b> sufficiently so that <b>a fold</b> appears below the breast. <b>Shmuel says:</b> This does <b>not literally</b> mean <b>from when</b> her breast <b>grows</b> sufficiently so that a permanent <b>fold</b> appears below the breast. <b>Rather,</b> it means that the breast has grown enough <b>so that</b> if she were to <b>stretch her hand behind her</b> back, <b>it would appear as though</b> her breast has <b>grown</b> sufficiently that there is <b>a fold below the breast.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara relates that <b>Shmuel examined</b> these stages <b>in his</b> Canaanite <b>maidservant, and</b> subsequently <b>gave her four dinars</b> as <b>payment for her humiliation.</b> The Gemara notes that in this regard <b>Shmuel</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Shmuel said</b> that the verse: <b>“You may enslave them forever”</b> (Leviticus 25:46) teaches: <b>I gave them</b> to you <b>for</b> the <b>service</b> of slaves, <b>but not for humiliation.</b> Consequently, if a master humiliated his Canaanite slave, he must pay him damages.

### Part 16
The Gemara further relates, with regard to the attitude toward maidservants, that <b>Shmuel</b> would <b>designate</b> a particular slave <b>for</b> each of his maidservants for intercourse, and he would not allow his slaves to engage in intercourse with whichever maidservant they chose. By contrast, <b>Rav Naḥman</b> would <b>exchange</b> his maidservants between his slaves, while <b>Rav Sheshet handed</b> his maidservants <b>to an Arab, and said to them:</b> You may engage in intercourse with whomever you choose, but <b>take care</b> not to engage in intercourse <b>with a Jew.</b>

### Part 17
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> Grown womanhood begins when the breasts have developed to a size where if a person places his hand on the nipple [<i>oketz</i>] it depresses and slows to return. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>oketz</i>? Shmuel said:</b> It means <b>the protrusion [<i>oketz</i>] of the breast,</b> i.e., the nipple.

### Part 18
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What are the signs of maturity? Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: From when the breasts knock against each other,</b> due to their size. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says: From when the head</b> of the protrusion in the center <b>of the nipple darkens.</b> The Gemara asks with regard to this suggestion: <b>From when it darkens? One</b> thereby <b>renders her old,</b> i.e., if one accepts this sign, the beginning of maturity is delayed significantly. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: From when the head of the protrusion splits. Rabbi Yosei says: From when the nipple</b> grows to such an extent that it <b>is surrounded by a circle. Rabbi Shimon says: From when</b> there is <b>a softening</b>
