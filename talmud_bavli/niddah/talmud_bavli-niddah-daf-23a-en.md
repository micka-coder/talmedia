<b>and derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> from the analogy that is <b>free on both sides. And</b> it is <b>for this</b> reason that <b>the Merciful One rendered</b> the verbal analogy between <b>animal</b> and man <b>free on both sides, so that one would not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the verbal analogy between sea monster and man, which is <b>free on</b> only <b>one side.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, teaches in the name of Rabbi Elazar</b> a more <b>lenient</b> version of the aforementioned principle of exegesis of verbal analogy: With regard to <b>any verbal analogy that is not free at all, one can derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> from it, <b>but one can</b> also <b>refute</b> it logically. If the verbal analogy is <b>free on one side, according to Rabbi Yishmael one can derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> from it, <b>and one cannot refute</b> it. <b>According to the Rabbis, one can derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> from it, <b>but one can</b> also <b>refute</b> it. If the verbal analogy is <b>free on both sides, everyone agrees</b> that <b>one can derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> from it <b>and one cannot refute</b> it.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>according to the Rabbis, what</b> difference <b>is there between</b> a verbal analogy that is <b>free on one side and</b> one <b>that is not free at all?</b> In both cases, the Rabbis hold that one can derive <i>halakhot</i> from such a verbal analogy but one can also refute it.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: The <b>difference</b> is in a case <b>where you find</b> two mutually exclusive verbal analogies, one that is <b>free on one side and</b> one <b>that is not free at all, and neither</b> does <b>this one have</b> a logical <b>refutation nor</b> does <b>that one have</b> a logical <b>refutation.</b> In such a case, <b>we disregard</b> the analogy <b>that is not free at all, and we derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the one that is <b>free on one side.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And here,</b> with regard to the verbal analogy between man and sea monster, which was rejected because it is free on only one side, <b>what</b> logical <b>refutation is there</b> on account of which this verbal analogy is rejected? The Gemara answers: The verbal analogy between man and sea monster is rejected <b>because it can be refuted</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about man?</b> Man is unique <b>in that</b> a person can <b>become impure while he is alive,</b> unlike an animal, which can become impure only after it dies, or a sea monster, which cannot become impure at all.

### Part 6
<b>And likewise, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> that a woman who discharges an item similar to a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or a bird is impure: It is <b>because formation is stated with regard to</b> the creation of these animals, <b>just as</b> it is stated with regard to the creation of <b>man.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Ami said to him: If that is so,</b> then in the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item that has <b>the shape of a mountain, its mother</b> should be <b>impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth, as it is stated</b> with regard to the creation of mountains: <b>“For He Who forms the mountains and creates the wind”</b> (Amos 4:13). Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to him: Does she discharge a mountain?</b> The discharged item cannot possibly be that large. <b>It is</b> an item with the form of <b>a stone that she discharges,</b> and <b>that is called a clod,</b> not a mountain.

### Part 8
Rabbi Ami further inquired: <b>If that is so,</b> in the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item having <b>an amorphous form [<i>ruaḥ</i>], its mother should be impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth, since creation is stated with regard to it, just as</b> it is stated with regard to <b>man, as it is written: “And creates the wind [<i>ruaḥ</i>].” And if you would say</b> that no verbal analogy can be drawn here, because the verse <b>is not free,</b> i.e., it is not superfluous, as it is necessary to recount the creation of the wind, that is not so. Rabbi Ami explains: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the verse <b>could have written: Who forms the mountains and the wind, and</b> instead <b>it is written:</b> “Who forms the mountains <b>and creates the wind,” conclude from it</b> that the superfluous word “creates” serves <b>to render it free</b> for drawing a verbal analogy between <i>ruaḥ</i> and man.

### Part 9
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ami: <b>One derives matters</b> that are stated in the <b>Torah from matters</b> that are stated in the <b>Torah,</b> i.e., from verses in the Torah, <b>but one does not derive matters</b> that are stated in the <b>Torah from the words of the tradition,</b> i.e., verses in the Prophets or the Writings, such as the verse in Amos.

### Part 10
§ <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir: Since the eyes of</b> these animals <b>are similar to those of a human,</b> a woman who discharges an item of that type is impure.

### Part 11
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then in the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item that has <b>the form of a snake, its mother should</b> likewise <b>be impure</b> with the impurity of a woman after <b>childbirth, since the pupil of</b> a snake <b>is round, like</b> that <b>of a human. And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i>, then <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> this case of a woman who discharges an item that has the form of <b>a snake</b> among the other cases where the woman discharges an item of an unusual form.

### Part 12
The Gemara explains: <b>If</b> the mishna had <b>taught</b> the case of <b>a snake, I would say</b> that it <b>is</b> only <b>in</b> the case of a woman who discharges an item having the form of <b>a snake that the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Meir</b> and rule that the woman is not impure, <b>as</b> a term of <b>formation is not written with regard to</b> the creation of the snake. <b>But</b> with regard to a woman who discharges an item having the form of <b>a domesticated animal or an undomesticated animal, they do not disagree</b> with Rabbi Meir, <b>as</b> the concept of <b>formation is written with regard to them.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>blemishes</b> that render the slaughter of a firstborn animal permitted, <b>it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 40a) that an animal <b>whose pupil is round like</b> that <b>of a human</b> is considered blemished. Evidently, the eyes of animals are dissimilar to those of humans. The Gemara answers that it is <b>not difficult; this</b> statement, that the eyes of animals are similar to those of humans, is referring <b>to</b> the <b>pupil,</b> and <b>that</b> statement, that the eyes of animals are not similar to those of humans, is referring <b>to</b> the entire eyeball in the <b>socket.</b>

### Part 14
§ <b>Rabbi Yannai said: This is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir:</b> It is <b>because the eyes of</b> these animals <b>are fixed in the front of</b> their heads <b>like</b> those <b>of a human,</b> unlike the eyes of birds and snakes, a woman who discharges an item of that kind is impure. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> there is the case of a woman who discharges an item similar to <b>a bird, whose eyes are not fixed in the front of</b> its head, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>Rabbi Meir says that</b> the woman <b>is impure.</b> This apparently contradicts Rabbi Yannai’s explanation. <b>Abaye said:</b> Rabbi Meir is referring <b>to</b> the <b>little owl [<i>bekarya</i>] and</b> the <b>great owl [<i>vekifofa</i>],</b> whose eyes are fixed in the front of their heads, <b>but in</b> the case of a woman who discharges any of the <b>other</b> species of <b>birds,</b> Rabbi Meir does <b>not</b> deem her impure.

### Part 15
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this answer from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: The statement of Rabbi Meir seems</b> correct <b>in</b> the case of a woman who discharges the form of <b>a domesticated animal or an undomesticated animal, and the statement of the Rabbis</b> seems correct <b>in</b> the case of <b>birds.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: To <b>what birds</b> is Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus referring? <b>If we say</b> he is referring <b>to</b> the <b>little owl and</b> the <b>great owl, what is the difference</b> between this case and the cases of <b>a domesticated animal or an undomesticated animal,</b> with regard to which Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus accepts the opinion of Rabbi Meir? If the key factor is <b>that their eyes are fixed in the front of</b> their heads <b>like</b> those <b>of a human,</b> Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus should accept the opinion of Rabbi Meir in the case of <b>a little owl or a great owl as well,</b> as their eyes are also fixed in the front of their heads.

### Part 17
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that when Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says that he does not accept the opinion of Rabbi Meir, he is referring <b>to</b> the <b>other</b> species of <b>birds. From the fact</b> that it is necessary for Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus to reject Rabbi Meir’s opinion in those cases, it may be concluded that <b>Rabbi Meir</b> himself <b>disagrees</b> with the Rabbis <b>with regard to</b> the <b>other</b> species of <b>birds</b> as well, despite the fact that their eyes are not fixed in the front of their heads.

### Part 18
The Gemara explains that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete, and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching: Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: The statement of Rabbi Meir seems</b> correct <b>in</b> the case of <b>a domesticated animal or an undomesticated animal, and the same is true with regard to a little owl or a great owl. And the statement of the Rabbis</b> appears correct even to Rabbi Meir <b>with regard to</b> the <b>other</b> species of <b>birds.</b> The reason is <b>that even Rabbi Meir</b> agrees that if a woman discharges an item that has the form of one of the other species of birds, she is not impure, i.e., he <b>disagrees with them only with regard to a little owl or a great owl, but he concedes to</b> their opinion <b>with regard to</b> the <b>other</b> species of <b>birds.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara cites proof for Abaye’s claim that Rabbi Meir differentiates between an owl and other species of birds, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says:</b> In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an item that has the form of <b>a type of domesticated animal or undomesticated animal, according to the statement of Rabbi Meir</b> it has the halakhic status of a full-fledged <b>offspring, and according to the statement of the Rabbis,</b> it does <b>not</b> have the status of a full-fledged <b>offspring. In</b> the case of a woman who discharges an item that has the form of <b>birds, it must be examined.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>According to whom must it be examined?</b> Is this <b>not</b> referring <b>to the statement of Rabbi Meir, who said</b> that if a woman discharges an item that has the form of <b>a little owl or a great owl, yes,</b> she is impure, but if she discharges an item that has the form of <b>other birds,</b> she is <b>not</b> impure? Consequently, the item must be examined to determine what type of bird it resembles.

### Part 21
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: No,</b> this <i>baraita</i> does not prove that Rabbi Meir differentiates between owls and other species of birds, as perhaps the statement that the discharged item <b>must be examined</b> applies <b>according to the Rabbis, as they say</b> that if a woman discharges an item that has the form of <b>a little owl or a great owl, yes,</b> she is impure, but if a woman discharges an item that has the form of <b>other birds,</b> she is <b>not</b> impure.

### Part 22
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the Rabbis hold that a woman who discharges an item similar to a land animal is not impure, why would they hold that if she discharges an item that has the form of owls she is impure? <b>What is the difference</b> between <b>a little owl and a great owl</b> on the one hand, and <b>a domesticated animal and an undomesticated animal</b> on the other? The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> owls <b>have cheeks like</b> those of <b>a human,</b> therefore a woman who discharges an item similar to an owl is impure, whereas if she discharges an item that has the form of a land animal she is pure, despite the fact that their eyes are fixed in the front of their heads.

### Part 23
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya asked Rabbi Zeira: According to Rabbi Meir, who said</b> that <b>an animal in the womb of a woman is</b> considered <b>a full-fledged offspring, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in a case where it is a female, and <b>her father accepted betrothal for her,</b> i.e., he married her off by accepting betrothal money from a man, or a document of betrothal? Is such a betrothal valid? Rabbi Yirmeya elaborated: <b>What</b> practical <b>difference is</b> there whether it is valid? The difference is <b>with regard to</b> whether it is <b>prohibited</b> for the man <b>to</b> marry <b>her sister.</b> If the betrothal is valid, it is prohibited for the husband to marry her sister, as one may not marry his wife’s sister.

### Part 24
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> such an offspring <b>can live?</b> This factor is important, as a man is prohibited from marrying his wife’s sister only during his wife’s lifetime. <b>But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav says: Rabbi Meir said</b> that a woman who discharges an item that has the form of an animal is impure <b>only since</b> there are other animals <b>of its type</b> that can <b>live,</b> i.e., there are animals similar to the discharged item that do survive, but not that creature itself. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says: Rabbi Yirmeya tried this hard to cause Rabbi Zeira to laugh, but he did not laugh.</b> In other words, Rabbi Yirmeya was not asking his question seriously.

### Part 25
The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Rabbi Meir said</b> that a woman who discharges an item that has the form of an animal is impure <b>only since</b> there are animals <b>of its type</b> that can <b>live. Rav Yirmeya of Difti says:</b>
