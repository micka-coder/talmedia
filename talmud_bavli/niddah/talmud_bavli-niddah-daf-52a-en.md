### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A young girl who</b> reached the age of puberty and <b>grew two</b> pubic <b>hairs</b> is an adult. If her childless husband dies, <b>she either performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b> and is thereby permitted to marry anyone, <b>or enters into levirate marriage</b> with her husband’s brother. <b>And</b> furthermore, such a girl is <b>obligated to</b> fulfill <b>all the mitzvot stated in the Torah</b> in which women are obligated.

### Part 3
<b>And likewise, a young boy who</b> reached the age of puberty and <b>grew two</b> pubic <b>hairs</b> is an adult and is <b>obligated to</b> fulfill <b>all the mitzvot stated in the Torah. And he is fit to be</b> declared <b>a stubborn and rebellious son</b> if he performs the actions that warrant that designation, <b>from when he grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs until</b> his <b>beard will form a circle.</b> During that period, although he is an adult and punishable for his actions, he is incapable of fathering a child. Consequently, as he is a son and not a father, he can be designated a stubborn and rebellious son.

### Part 4
The mishna explains that the reference is to <b>the lower,</b> pubic, hair, <b>and not to the upper,</b> facial, hair. <b>But</b> the term beard is used, despite its being subject to misinterpretation, due to the fact <b>that the Sages spoke euphemistically.</b>

### Part 5
<b>A young girl who</b> reached the age of puberty and <b>grew two</b> pubic <b>hairs can no</b> longer <b>perform refusal</b> to end a marriage with a husband to whom she was married as a minor by her mother and brothers after her father’s death. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> She retains the right to perform refusal <b>until</b> the pubic hair will grow to the extent <b>that the black</b> hair <b>will be preponderant</b> in the pubic area.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But since we learned</b> in the mishna that a young girl who reached the age of puberty and grew two pubic hairs is considered an adult and is <b>obligated to</b> fulfill <b>all the mitzvot stated in the Torah, why do I</b> need the mishna to also teach: <b>She either performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or enters into levirate marriage.</b> These specific examples are included in the broader statement.

### Part 7
The Gemara explains: This emphasis serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei, who said: Man,</b> i.e., an adult man, <b>is written in the passage</b> of <i>ḥalitza</i>: “And if the man does not wish to take his brother’s wife” (Deuteronomy 25:7). <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>woman, whether</b> she is <b>an adult or whether</b> she is <b>a minor,</b> she can be released by <i>ḥalitza</i>, as the Torah does not specify her age. The mishna <b>teaches us that</b> the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei. Rather, <b>if</b> she <b>grew two</b> pubic <b>hairs,</b> then <b>yes,</b> she can perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, whereas <b>if</b> she did <b>not</b> grow two hairs, she may <b>not</b> perform <i>ḥalitza</i> or enter into levirate marriage. <b>What is the reason</b> for this ruling? It is that the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>woman</b> is <b>like</b> that of the <b>man,</b> as a woman is juxtaposed to man in this passage.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks further: <b>And since we learned</b> in the continuation of the mishna: <b>And likewise, a young boy who</b> reached the age of puberty and <b>grew two</b> pubic <b>hairs</b> is an adult, <b>why do I</b> need the mishna to add explicitly: Is <b>obligated to</b> fulfill <b>all the mitzvot stated in the Torah?</b>

### Part 9
<b>And if you would say</b> that the mishna specified this <b>because</b> it <b>wanted to teach</b> the particular <i>halakha</i>: <b>And he is fit to be</b> declared <b>a stubborn and rebellious son,</b> that cannot be the reason, as <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> that <b><i>halakha</i></b> on <b>another occasion</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 68b): <b>When</b> is such a boy liable to receive the death penalty imposed upon <b>a stubborn and rebellious son? From when he grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs until</b> his <b>beard will form a circle.</b> The reference is to <b>the lower,</b> pubic, hair <b>and not to the upper,</b> facial hair, <b>but</b> the term beard is used, due to the fact <b>that the Sages spoke euphemistically.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so,</b> i.e., it is not necessary for the mishna to specify with regard to a boy that he is obligated to fulfill all the mitzvot stated in the Torah. <b>But since</b> the mishna <b>specified</b> this <b>matter</b> in the case <b>of a young girl,</b> it <b>also specified</b> this <b>matter</b> in the case <b>of a young boy.</b>

### Part 11
§ The mishna teaches: <b>A young girl who</b> reached the age of puberty and <b>grew</b> two pubic hairs can no longer perform refusal to end a marriage with a husband to whom she was married as a minor by her mother and brothers after her father’s death. Rabbi Yehuda maintains that she retains the right of refusal until the pubic hair grows to the extent that the black hair is preponderant in the pubic area. <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda concedes</b> to the Rabbis <b>that if she engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband <b>after she grew two</b> pubic <b>hairs,</b> she <b>can no longer perform refusal.</b> This is because the act of intercourse renders her betrothed to him by Torah law, and refusal is a rabbinic enactment that is effective only with regard to a betrothal that applies by rabbinic law.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Kahana’s colleagues thought to perform an action in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the mishna, <b>and</b> to permit a young girl who had grown two pubic hairs to perform refusal, <b>even though she</b> had <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband after growing two hairs. They held that until the pubic hair grows to the extent that the black hair is preponderant in the pubic area, her betrothal does not apply by Torah law.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Kahana said to</b> his colleagues: <b>Didn’t the incident involving Rabbi Yishmael’s daughter,</b> who was married as a minor by her mother and brothers after her father’s death, transpire <b>in that manner? As she came to the study hall to refuse</b> her marriage, <b>and her son was riding on her shoulders. And on that</b> very <b>day, Rabbi Yishmael’s statement,</b> that a young girl may perform refusal even if she engaged in intercourse with her husband after growing two hairs, <b>was mentioned in the study hall. And she cried</b> with <b>a great weeping in the study hall,</b> as a result of the incident.

### Part 15
The Sages who were in the study hall <b>said:</b> Could it be that with regard to <b>a matter that that righteous</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>said,</b> i.e., that she can perform refusal, <b>his offspring would stumble upon it?</b> The consequence of her refusal is that she is considered to have borne the child retroactively out of wedlock.

### Part 16
<b>As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> The verse states with regard to a <i>sota</i>: <b>“And neither was she taken”</b> (Numbers 5:13), i.e., raped. In this case <b>she is prohibited</b> to her husband. It may be inferred that if she <b>was taken</b> forcefully <b>she is permitted</b> to her husband. <b>And there is</b> a case of <b>another</b> woman <b>where, even though she was not taken</b> forcefully, but was willing, she nevertheless remains <b>permitted. And which</b> case <b>is this?</b> This is referring to one <b>whose betrothal</b> was <b>a mistaken betrothal, as, even if her son</b> from this marriage <b>is riding on her shoulders she may perform refusal and go</b> off as pleases <b>her.</b> Although she engaged in intercourse with her husband after growing two pubic hairs, she was relying on the original betrothal, which was a mistaken betrothal, and did not intend to become betrothed to him by means of this intercourse, which would have rendered her betrothed by Torah law. She may therefore nullify the betrothal by means of refusal.

### Part 17
<b>And</b> the Gemara relates that as a result of the event involving Rabbi Yishmael’s daughter, the Sages assembled, <b>counted</b> the votes, <b>and concluded: Until when may</b> a young <b>girl perform refusal? Until</b> she <b>grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs.</b> Once Rav Kahana’s colleagues heard this, they <b>retracted</b> and <b>did not perform an action</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda in the mishna, to permit the girl to perform refusal as they had originally planned.

### Part 18
The Gemara further relates that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak and the disciples of Rabbi Ḥanina performed an action in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the mishna, <b>and</b> permitted a young girl who had grown two pubic hairs to perform refusal, <b>even though she</b> had <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband after growing two hairs. <b>Rav Shemen bar Abba</b> subsequently <b>went</b> and <b>stated</b> this story <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan went</b> and <b>stated it before Rabbi Yehuda Nesia.</b> Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <b>sent a constable [<i>ballasha</i>] and removed</b> that girl from her second husband.

### Part 19
With regard to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, that the black hair must be preponderant in the pubic area, <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Mar Ukva says:</b> This does <b>not</b> mean <b>that</b> the <b>black</b> hair must <b>literally be preponderant</b> in the pubic area. <b>Rather, there must be two hairs lying down, so that it appears as though the black</b> hairs in the pubic area cover an area <b>greater than the white</b> area uncovered by hair. <b>Rava says:</b> Rabbi Yehuda means that there are <b>two hairs that surround</b> the pubic area <b>from end to end.</b>

### Part 20
§ The mishna teaches that the growth of two hairs is a sign of becoming an adult. The Gemara clarifies the details of this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says:</b> These <b>two hairs that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> are a sign of adulthood <b>must have follicles at their roots. Rav Malkiyyu says</b> that <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> says: If there are two <b>follicles</b> next to each other, they constitute a sign of adulthood <b>even if there are no hairs</b> in them. The assumption is that follicles do not exist without hair, and therefore there must have been hairs there that fell out.

### Part 21
This <i>halakha</i> was stated by a Sage by the name of Rav Malkiyyu. To prevent confusion between his rulings and those of the similarly named Rav Malkiyya, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rav Ika, says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> involving <b>a skewer,</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>maidservants, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> involving hair <b>follicles</b> were all stated by <b>Rav Malkiyyu.</b> By contrast, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>forelock [<i>belorit</i>],</b> the <i>halakha</i> involving <b>burnt ashes, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>cheese</b> were all stated by a different Sage named <b>Rav Malkiyya.</b>

### Part 22
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The aforementioned <i>halakhot</i> that relate to <b>a mishna or a <i>baraita</i></b> were stated by <b>Rav Malkiyya,</b> whereas <b><i>halakhot</i></b> that do not refer to a mishna or <i>baraita</i> but are independent statements of <i>amora’im</i> were taught by <b>Rav Malkiyyu. And a mnemonic</b> to remember this is: <b>The mishna is a queen [<i>malketa</i>],</b> i.e., the comments that are referring to a mishna were issued by Rav Malkiyya, whose name is similar to the Aramaic term for queen.

### Part 23
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rav Ika, and Rav Pappa? The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to which Sage taught the <i>halakha</i> involving <b>maidservants.</b> Rav Pappa maintains that it was taught by Rav Malkiyya, as it is referring to a dispute in a mishna. By contrast, according to Rabbi Ḥanina, this <i>halakha</i> was stated by Rav Malkiyyu.

### Part 24
With regard to the <i>halakha</i> of Rav Malkiyyu itself, concerning follicles, <b>Rav Ashi says: Mar Zutra told me</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina of Sura</b> posed the following <b>difficulty:</b> If it is correct that follicles suffice as a sign of adulthood, <b>let</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>not evade</b> the issue, <b>but</b> rather let him <b>teach us</b> explicitly that <b>follicles</b> are a sign of adulthood even if they do not contain hair. The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the mishna had <b>taught us</b> the case of <b>follicles, I would say</b> that they are not considered a sign of adulthood <b>until there are two hairs in two follicles.</b> By omitting any mention of follicles in the mishna, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us that even two hairs in one follicle</b> are a sign of adulthood.

### Part 25
The Gemara asks: <b>And is there</b> actually <b>a case like this,</b> of two hairs in one follicle? <b>But isn’t it written: “He crushes me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause”</b> (Job 9:17); <b>and Rava said</b> with regard to this verse: <b>Job blasphemed with a tempest,</b> and <b>with a tempest he was answered. He blasphemed with a tempest,</b> as Job <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, perhaps a tempest passed before You and You confused Iyyov,</b> Job, <b>with <i>oyev</i>,</b> enemy. <b>With a tempest he was answered,</b> as the verse states: <b>“Then the Lord answered</b>
