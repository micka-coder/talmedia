### Part 1
<b>of years of the crops he shall sell to you”</b> (Leviticus 25:15). The plural form of both “years” and “crops” indicates that the number of years does not necessarily correspond to the quantity of crops. Consequently, <b>sometimes you</b> might <b>sell three</b> yields of <b>crops in two years.</b> If one purchases a field in the summer, when the produce has not yet been harvested, and he harvests that yield and subsequently grows and harvests two more crops before the completion of the whole two years, he will have gained three yields in less than two years.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>six years</b> stated <b>with regard to a Hebrew slave</b> is calculated by whole years? The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “Six years he shall work, and in the seventh</b> he shall go out free for nothing” (Exodus 21:2). The word “and” in the phrase <b>“and in the seventh”</b> indicates that <b>he shall also work</b> in the seventh calendar year, if six full years have not passed since he was sold. For example, if he was sold in the month of Nisan, it means that five years and six months have passed when Tishrei, the first month of the seventh year, arrives; he has not yet completed six years of service, and he must work in this seventh calendar year as well, until the date on which he was sold.

### Part 3
The <i>baraita</i> mentions the years <b>of a son and of a daughter</b> among those calculated as full years. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this stated? <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: With regard to valuations,</b> i.e., the age of a valuated male or female is calculated in whole years from the date of his birth, not by calendar years. <b>And Rav Yosef says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is stated <b>with regard to</b> the matters taught in <b>our</b> fifth <b>chapter</b> in tractate <i>Nidda</i>, which is named after its opening words: <b><i>Yotze Dofen</i>,</b> meaning an offspring born by caesarean section. In other words, when a mishna in this chapter mentions years, it means full years, even when it does not state this explicitly.

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Do you</b> and Rav <b>disagree</b> with regard to this matter? In other words, as you interpreted the mention of a son and a daughter differently, does each of you reject the halakhic application of the other? Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>No, he said one</b> matter, <b>and I said one</b> different matter, <b>but we do not disagree.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara notes: <b>And this, too, stands to reason, as if it enters your mind</b> that they <b>disagree</b> with regard to this matter, then <b>the one who said</b> full years are required <b>for</b> determining <b>valuations</b> does <b>not say</b> that full years are necessary <b>for</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of this chapter, <b><i>Yotze Dofen</i>. But doesn’t Rav say,</b> like Rav Yosef, that <b>the <i>halakha</i> in</b> this <b>entire chapter</b> with regard to all of the places where an age is mentioned in years is that even when the phrase: And one day, is not explicitly noted, they are all calculated <b>from</b> the <b>time</b> of year of birth <b>until</b> that same <b>time</b> of year in the age specified, not by calendar years?

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is correct, then <b>according to</b> Rav, who is <b>the one who said</b> that full years are required <b>for</b> determining <b>valuations, what is the reason</b> that <b>he does not say</b> in his interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> that full years are required <b>for</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>Yotze Dofen</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: Rav maintains that the years of a son and of a daughter mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> are <b>similar to those</b> other cases mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as those</b> numbers of years <b>are written</b> in the Torah, <b>so too these</b> years of a son and of a daughter are referring to matters <b>where</b> the years <b>are written</b> in the Torah, i.e., the years of valuations, unlike the topics discussed in <i>Yotze Dofen</i>, where the years are not mentioned explicitly in the Torah.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>the other</b> <i>amora</i>, Rav Yosef, respond to this contention? The Gemara answers: He would maintain that if the <i>baraita</i> were referring to the years of valuations, which are written in the Torah, then <b>this</b> expression in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Of a son and of a daughter,</b> is unsuitable. Rather, the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> stated: <b>Of the male and of the female,</b> which are the terms the Torah uses with regard to valuations, whereas the terms: Son and daughter, are used in <i>Yotze Dofen</i>.

### Part 8
§ <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar, who said</b> his ruling <b>in the name of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> that a man nineteen years and thirty days of age who has not developed signs of puberty is deemed a sexually underdeveloped man. In this regard, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> May it be God’s will that <b>I merit to ascend</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>and</b> that <b>I learn</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> from the mouth of its Master,</b> Rabbi Elazar.

### Part 9
The Gemara recounts that <b>when</b> Rabbi Zeira eventually <b>ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>he</b> indeed <b>found Rabbi Elazar</b> and <b>said to him: Did you say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar?</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: I said</b> that it <b>stands to reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his opinion. He elaborated: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> throughout <b>the entire chapter</b> the Mishna <b>teaches:</b> And <b>one day, but here,</b> in the last mishna, <b>it does not teach</b> this phrase, one can <b>conclude from it</b> that it <b>stands to reason</b> that there is a reason for this discrepancy, <b>in accordance with the opinion of</b> Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar.
