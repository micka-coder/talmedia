### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was stated:</b> If a woman <b>saw</b> menstrual blood on the <b>fifteenth of this month, and</b> on the <b>sixteenth of</b> the <b>month</b> after <b>that, and</b> on the <b>seventeenth of</b> the <b>month</b> after <b>that, Rav says: She has</b> thereby <b>determined her</b> menstrual <b>cycle by skipping,</b> i.e., as a month and a day. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> Her menstrual cycle is not determined <b>until she skips</b> a day <b>three times.</b> According to Shmuel, as the cycle is established in this case not by the date itself but by the pattern of one additional day every month, the pattern is established only when this occurs three consecutive times, i.e., when she menstruates on the fourth occasion.

### Part 2
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Rav and Shmuel disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman <b>was married to</b> her <b>first</b> husband <b>and he died,</b> and was then married <b>to a second</b> one <b>and he</b> too <b>died, she may not marry a third</b> husband; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: She may marry a third</b> husband, but if he also dies <b>she may not marry a fourth</b> husband. The suggestion is that Rav and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi hold that after two instances she has established a presumption and a pattern, whereas Shmuel and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel maintain that the presumption is established only after three occurrences.

### Part 3
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, everyone agrees</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> that a presumption is established only after three times, <b>and here they disagree with regard to this</b> matter: <b>Rav holds</b> that when she experienced bleeding on the <b>fifteenth</b> of the month, that occasion is also one <b>of the number,</b> i.e., it counts as the first of the pattern, which therefore has three elements. <b>And Shmuel holds</b> that <b>since she did not see</b> the first time after <b>skipping,</b> i.e., after having experienced bleeding on the fourteenth of the previous month, <b>it is not</b> part of <b>the number,</b> which means that she has experienced bleeding only twice in accordance with that pattern.

### Part 4
Shmuel <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rav from a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> a flow of blood on the <b>fifteenth day</b> of the month, <b>and deviated</b> and instead experienced bleeding <b>on the sixteenth day</b> of the month, on both <b>this</b> day, the fifteenth, <b>and that</b> day, the sixteenth, it is <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in intercourse with her husband. If she then <b>deviated</b> and experienced bleeding <b>on the seventeenth day</b> of the following month, <b>the sixteenth</b> day becomes <b>permitted, and the fifteenth and seventeenth</b> days of the following month <b>are prohibited.</b>

### Part 5
If she subsequently <b>deviated</b> and experienced bleeding <b>on</b> the <b>eighteenth day</b> of the following month, <b>all</b> the days <b>are permitted.</b> The fifteenth is permitted because she has now experienced bleeding three times on a different day, while the other days are permitted because she experienced bleeding only once on each day. <b>And</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in intercourse in the following month <b>only from</b> the <b>eighteenth</b> day <b>and onward,</b> i.e., on the nineteenth day, since she has now established a pattern of bleeding after one month and one day. This is <b>difficult for Rav,</b> as he maintains that twice is sufficient to establish a pattern, whereas this <i>baraita</i> requires three instances. <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response: Since she <b>was accustomed</b> to experience bleeding on the fifteenth <b>it is different.</b> In that particular case the fifteenth does not count as the beginning of a new pattern because it was already her regular established time.

### Part 6
The Gemara expresses surprise at Shmuel’s question: <b>And he who asked [<i>udeka’arei</i>] it, why did he ask it?</b> The <i>baraita</i> clearly stresses the fact that the woman began with an established fixed menstrual cycle that was not part of the pattern. Shmuel could answer: <b>It was necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to teach the case where she <b>was accustomed</b> to experience bleeding on a specific day, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>since she was accustomed</b> to experience bleeding on a specific day <b>and displaced</b> that pattern by bleeding on a different day, it should be sufficient that <b>with two times she displaces it.</b> For this reason, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that an established pattern is displaced only after three occasions where she experiences bleeding on a different day. If it is not established, one displacement is enough.

### Part 7
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman <b>saw</b> a flow of blood on the <b>twenty-first day of this month,</b> the <b>twenty-second day of that month,</b> i.e., of the next month, and the <b>twenty-third day of that month,</b> i.e., of the third month, <b>she established a fixed</b> pattern of bleeding after one month and one day. If in the third month she instead <b>varied</b> and experienced bleeding <b>on</b> the <b>twenty-fourth day</b> of the month, <b>she has not established a fixed</b> pattern, as this last interval was one month and two days long. This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> as according to the <i>baraita</i> the pattern is established after only two equidistant intervals, whereas Shmuel requires three.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers that <b>Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you: Here, we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> a flow of blood <b>on</b> the <b>twentieth day</b> of the month, <b>and she deviated</b> and experienced bleeding <b>on the twenty-first day</b> of the month. Consequently, there were in fact a total of three equidistant intervals of one month and one day. The Gemara adds that the language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise, as</b> for what other reason would the <i>baraita</i> <b>leave</b> aside the <b>twentieth day</b> of the month and not use that date as the example, <b>and</b> instead <b>take</b> for its example the <b>twenty-first day</b> of the month? <b>Learn from this</b> that she had an established pattern of bleeding on the twentieth of every month before the events described in the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches: <b>As a woman establishes a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle only after she establishes it</b> three times. <b>Rav Pappa says,</b> in explanation: <b>We said</b> that she must experience bleeding three times <b>only with regard to establishing</b> a fixed menstrual cycle, <b>but with regard to</b> being <b>concerned</b> for a pattern, even <b>after one time she must be concerned</b> that this might be the beginning of a fixed pattern.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Pappa <b>teaching us? We learn</b> this in the mishna: If the woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> the flow of blood on the <b>fifteenth day and she deviated</b> from the norm <b>to see</b> the flow of blood <b>on</b> the <b>twentieth day,</b> on both <b>this</b> day, the fifteenth, <b>and that</b> day, the twentieth, it is <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in intercourse. This clearly demonstrates that even after bleeding only once on a certain day she must be concerned that this could be the start of a new fixed menstrual cycle.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> this <i>halakha</i> was derived only <b>from there, I would say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies in a case <b>where</b> she experiences bleeding on the twentieth day while <b>she is standing in her days</b> suitable for <b>menstruation,</b> i.e., the days following the eleven days after her last period, when she is most likely to menstruate. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where she is not standing in her days</b> suitable for <b>menstruation,</b> but rather during the eleven days when uterine bleeding would render her a <i>zava</i>, <b>I would say</b> that she does <b>not</b> need to be concerned that she might experience bleeding again at that time. Therefore, Rav Pappa <b>teaches us</b> that even during these eleven days she must be concerned.

### Part 12
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> a woman <b>is purified from the</b> existing fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> in the sense that intercourse is permitted on that day, <b>only</b> when she has been displaced from that day three times. <b>Rav Pappa says,</b> in explanation: <b>We said</b> this <b>only</b> in the case of a set cycle <b>that she established</b> by <b>three times.</b> With regard to such a cycle, we said <b>that</b> a different <b>three times are necessary to displace</b> that cycle. <b>But</b> with regard to a cycle that is established with only <b>two times, it is displaced by one time</b> of bleeding on a different day.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Pappa <b>teaching us? We learn</b> this in the mishna: <b>A woman establishes</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle only after she establishes it three times.</b> The Gemara answers that it was necessary for Rav Pappa to teach his <i>halakha</i>, <b>lest you say</b> that a cycle is displaced by bleeding <b>one</b> time on a different day <b>for</b> a cycle that was set <b>one</b> time, but by bleeding on <b>two</b> different days <b>for</b> a cycle that was established with <b>two</b> times, <b>and</b> likewise by bleeding on <b>three</b> different days <b>for</b> a cycle that was established with <b>three</b> times. Therefore, Rav Pappa <b>teaches us</b> that whether she experiences bleeding once or twice, she displaces it by bleeding once on a different day.

### Part 14
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Pappa:</b> If a woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> the flow of blood on the <b>twentieth day</b> after her previous flow, <b>and she deviated</b> from the norm to experience bleeding <b>on</b> the <b>thirtieth day,</b> on both <b>this</b> day, the twentieth, <b>and that</b> day, the thirtieth, it is <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in intercourse. If the <b>twentieth day arrived,</b> counting from the previous flow, which had occurred on day thirty, <b>and she did not see</b> a flow of blood, <b>it is permitted for her to engage</b> in intercourse <b>until</b> the <b>thirtieth day</b> after the previous flow, <b>and she</b> must be <b>concerned on</b> the <b>thirtieth day.</b>

### Part 15
If the <b>thirtieth day arrived and she saw</b> a flow of blood, and then the <b>twentieth day</b> after that <b>arrived and she did not see</b> a flow of blood, <b>and</b> the <b>thirtieth day</b> from her previous flow <b>arrived and she did not see</b> blood on that day but saw on a later day, <b>and</b> then the <b>twentieth day</b> after her previous flow <b>arrived and she saw</b> a flow of blood, the <b>thirtieth day becomes permitted,</b> as she experienced bleeding after an interval of thirty days only twice. This is in accordance with the opinion of Rav Pappa that a cycle of bleeding that has occurred twice is displaced by a single time of not bleeding on that day.
