### Part 1
<b>He examines it section by section,</b> as by examining each part of the garment separately he will discover any remaining blood stain.

### Part 2
In the case of a garment <b>in which a seminal emission,</b> which is also ritually impure, <b>was lost,</b> i.e., it is not known where on the garment the semen is, if the garment is <b>new, one examines it by</b> sticking <b>a needle</b> into every part of it. In this manner he will feel if the semen is in the garment. If the garment is <b>worn out, one examines it by</b> holding it up to <b>the sun,</b> as the sun’s rays will not pass through the stained part of the garment. It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>section</b> mentioned need <b>not</b> be <b>less than three</b> fingerbreadths by three <b>fingerbreadths</b> in area.

### Part 3
The Gemara cites another case of a garment in which something was lost. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a garment in which diverse kinds,</b> a prohibited mixture of wool and linen, <b>was lost,</b> i.e., it is a wool garment into which a linen thread was sewn or vice versa and it is not known where on the garment the thread is located, <b>one may not sell it to a gentile and one may not</b> even <b>fashion it</b> into <b>a saddlecloth for a donkey.</b> This is prohibited lest one remove a piece of the garment and sew it onto his own clothing. <b>But one may fashion it</b> into <b>a shroud for a corpse,</b> as there is no concern that one might remove it from the dead. <b>Rav Yosef said: That is to say</b> that the <b>mitzvot will be nullified in the future.</b> If this were not the case, then when the dead are resurrected they will be deriving benefit from the garment of diverse kinds in which they were buried.

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef, <b>and some say</b> that <b>Rav Dimi</b> said to Rav Yosef: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Mani say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai said: They taught</b> that it is permitted to place a corpse in a shroud of diverse kinds <b>only</b> in order <b>to eulogize him, but it is prohibited to bury him</b> in a shroud of diverse kinds? Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> matter that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>even</b> permitted <b>to bury him</b> in a shroud of diverse kinds?

### Part 5
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning</b> in this regard, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Set apart [<i>ḥofshi</i>] among the dead,</b> like the slain that lie in the grave, whom You remember no more” (Psalms 88:6)? <b>Once a person dies, he becomes free [<i>ḥofshi</i>] from the mitzvot.</b>

### Part 6
§ <b>Rafram bar Pappa says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> With regard to <b>a garment in which diverse kinds was lost, one may dye it, and it is permitted</b> to wear the garment, as wool and linen absorb dye differently, and therefore it will be easy to notice the location of the other kind of thread and remove it. <b>Rava said to Rafram bar Pappa: From where does the Elder,</b> i.e., Rav Ḥisda, derive <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 7
Rafram bar Pappa <b>said to him: It is</b> derived from <b>the mishna, as we learned:</b> With regard to a pile of stones that was known to have an item of ritual impurity buried beneath it, one continues <b>searching</b> beneath each of these piles <b>until he reaches bedrock. And if</b> the impure item <b>is not</b> there, i.e., if he found nothing, one can <b>say</b> that <b>a raven</b> or some other animal <b>took it. So too</b> here, <b>wool and flax,</b> i.e., linen, <b>do not absorb</b> the dye <b>in the same</b> manner. <b>And since</b> he dyed the garment and <b>he does not know</b> of any mixture of linen and wool within it, as the entire garment absorbed the dye in the same way, one must <b>say that</b> that thread <b>has fallen out,</b> and therefore it is permitted to wear the garment.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Yeiva, said in the name of Mar Zutra:</b> In a case of <b>one who put a thread of flax in a cloak of wool and it fell out, but he does not know whether it</b> all <b>fell out or</b> whether it <b>did not</b> all <b>fall out,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to wear the cloak.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is lenient in this case of uncertainty? <b>By Torah law,</b> it <b>is written: “Diverse kinds [<i>sha’atnez</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:11), and this is interpreted as an acronym indicating that the <i>halakha</i> of diverse kinds does not apply <b>unless</b> the item <b>is</b> combed <b>smooth [<i>shua</i>], spun [<i>tavui</i>]</b> as a thread, <b>and woven [<i>nuz</i>].</b> Without these characteristics, the combination is not considered diverse kinds by Torah law. <b>And it is the Sages who decreed</b> that diverse kinds that are merely attached to each other are prohibited, despite the fact that they are not combed and spun together. <b>And</b> in this case, <b>since he does not know if it</b> all <b>fell out</b> it is <b>permitted,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is lenient with regard to uncertainties involving prohibitions that are by rabbinic law.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Ashi objects to this</b> leniency. One can <b>say</b> that by Torah law it is prohibited if the linen and wool are <b>either combed, or spun, or woven.</b> Perhaps the word <i>sha’atnez</i> does not limit the prohibition to a combination of all three activities, but to any one of them. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Mar Zutra, from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One expresses</b> the prohibition in the Torah <b>in one word,</b> <i>sha’atnez</i>. Therefore, the term means all three characteristics together.

### Part 11
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A colored garment renders</b> a woman <b>impure due to</b> blood <b>stains</b> if she sees a blood stain on it. <b>Rabbi Natan bar Yosef says:</b> If she sees a blood stain on the colored garment <b>she is not impure due to</b> a blood <b>stain, as</b> the Sages <b>enacted</b> that <b>women</b> wear <b>colored garments,</b> and this decree was made <b>only</b> in order <b>to be lenient with regard to their</b> blood <b>stains,</b> i.e., so that they do not become impure.

### Part 12
The Gemara questions Rabbi Natan bar Yosef’s use of the word: Enacted. The Sages <b>enacted? What was their enactment? Rather,</b> Rabbi Natan bar Yosef said the reason <b>that</b> the Sages <b>permitted colored garments to women</b> was <b>only</b> in order <b>to be lenient with regard to her</b> blood <b>stains.</b> The Gemara raises an objection: From the statement that the Sages <b>permitted</b> colored garments one can conclude <b>by inference they were</b> previously <b>prohibited.</b> But was there a time when it was not permitted for women to wear colored garments?

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sota</i> 49a): <b>In the war [<i>bapulmus</i>] of Vespasian they decreed upon the crowns of bridegrooms,</b> i.e., that bridegrooms may no longer wear crowns, <b>and upon the drum [<i>ha’irus</i>],</b> i.e., they also banned the playing of drums. <b>They</b> also <b>sought to decree with regard to colored garments,</b> i.e., that women may not wear such garments, but <b>they said: This is preferable,</b> that women should wear colored garments, <b>in order to be lenient with regard to their</b> blood <b>stains,</b> as a blood stain found on a colored garment does not render a woman ritually impure.

### Part 14
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <b>seven substances</b> that <b>one applies to the stain</b> on a garment to ascertain whether it is a blood stain or a dye, as these seven substances remove the blood. They are: <b>Tasteless saliva, and liquid from split beans, and urine, and natron, and <i>borit</i>,</b>
