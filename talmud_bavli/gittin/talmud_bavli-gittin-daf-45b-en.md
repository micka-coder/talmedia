### Part 1
<b>for the betterment of the world,</b> so as not to cause an increase in the theft of sacred Jewish ritual objects in order to sell them for large sums of money.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Budya said to Rav Ashi</b> that one could infer the following from the mishna: <b>It is</b> for <b>more than their</b> actual monetary <b>value</b> that <b>one may not purchase them; however, for their</b> precise <b>value, one may purchase them.</b> Can one <b>learn from</b> the mishna that with regard to <b>a Torah scroll that is found in the possession of a gentile, one can read</b> from <b>it</b> after obtaining it from the gentile, and there is no concern that perhaps the gentile wrote it and it is unfit? Rav Ashi answered: <b>Perhaps</b> this does not mean that the Torah scroll is purchased in order to read from it, but rather in order <b>to inter</b> it and not to use it; however, it is nevertheless purchased so that it will not be desecrated by the gentiles.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Naḥman says: We have a tradition</b> that <b>a Torah scroll that was written by a heretic should be burned;</b> a Torah scroll <b>written by a gentile should be interred;</b> a Torah scroll <b>found in the possession of a heretic,</b> and it is not clear who wrote it, <b>should be interred.</b> With regard to a Torah scroll <b>found in the possession of a gentile, some say</b> it <b>should be interred and some say</b> that <b>one may read</b> from <b>it.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>a Torah scroll that was written by a gentile, it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: It <b>should be burned, and it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: It <b>should be interred, and it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may read</b> from <b>it.</b> There is a three-fold contradiction concerning the <i>halakha</i> of a Torah scroll written by a gentile.

### Part 5
The Gemara explains: This is <b>not difficult: That which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that it <b>should be burned, is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says: The unspecified intentions of a gentile are for idol worship,</b> and therefore everything he wrote is assumed to be written for the sake of idolatrous worship and must be burned.

### Part 6
<b>And that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, which said that <b>it should be interred, is</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as Rav Hamnuna, son of Rava of Pashronya, taught: A Torah scroll, phylacteries, or <i>mezuzot</i> that were written by a heretic or an informer, a gentile or a slave, a woman or a minor, or a Samaritan or a Jewish apostate, are unfit, as it is stated: “And you shall bind them</b> as a sign on your hand…<b>and you shall write them</b> on the doorposts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:8–9). From this juxtaposition, one can derive the following: <b>Anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>binding</b> the phylacteries, i.e., one who is both obligated and performs the mitzva, <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the class of people who may <b>write</b> Torah scrolls, phylacteries, and <i>mezuzot</i>; <b>but anyone who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>binding is not</b> included <b>in</b> the class of people who may <b>write</b> sacred texts. This <i>baraita</i> equates the <i>halakha</i> of a Torah scroll written by a gentile to the <i>halakha</i> of Torah scrolls written by these other types of people, which are interred.

### Part 7
<b>And</b> concerning <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, i.e., that <b>one may read</b> from <b>it, that</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>this</b> following <b><i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Avoda Zara</i> 3:6): <b>One may purchase</b> Torah <b>scrolls from gentiles in any location, provided that they are written in accordance with their <i>halakhot</i>. And</b> there was <b>an incident involving a gentile in Tzaidan who would write</b> Torah <b>scrolls, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel permitted</b> the Jews <b>to purchase</b> the Torah scrolls <b>from him.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel require</b> that the <b>preparation</b> of the parchment of Torah scrolls, phylacteries, and <i>mezuzot</i> be <b>for their sake,</b> i.e., for the sake of their use in a mitzva, but <b>he does not require</b> that the <b>writing</b> be <b>for their sake?</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara quotes the source that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel requires that the parchment be prepared for their sake: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one took phylacteries and <b>coated them with gold or patched them</b> with the <b>skin of a non-kosher animal,</b> then <b>they are unfit.</b> However, if one patched them with the <b>skin of a kosher animal,</b> then <b>they are fit, and</b> this is so <b>even though he did not prepare them,</b> i.e., the skin, <b>for their sake,</b> i.e., for the sake of their use in a mitzva. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Even</b> if he patched them with the <b>skin of a kosher animal they are unfit, until he prepares them for their sake.</b> Being that he holds that the parchment needs to be prepared for their sake, their actual writing should certainly be done for their sake.

### Part 10
<b>Rabba bar Shmuel says:</b> That incident in Tzaidan involved <b>a convert who returned to his</b> previous <b>corrupt ways [<i>suro</i>]</b> by reverting to living like a gentile. He nevertheless remains a Jew. The Gemara asks: If he returned <b>to his</b> previous <b>corrupt ways all the more so</b> should the Torah scroll be rendered unfit, <b>as he is a heretic.</b> Once he learns the Jewish faith and abandons it, he is considered a heretic. <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> This means <b>that he returned to his</b> previous <b>corrupt ways due to fear,</b> and not because he rejected the Jewish faith. He ceased acting like a Jew out of fear of reprisal. Since he is a Jew, it is permitted for him to read from the Torah scrolls that he writes.

### Part 11
§ The Gemara clarifies the <i>halakha</i> from the mishna that one may not purchase sacred items from a gentile for more than their actual value. <b>The Sages taught: One may increase</b> payment beyond <b>their value up to a <i>terapa’ik</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is a <b><i>terapa’ik</i>? Rav Sheshet said:</b> It is an <b><i>istera</i>,</b> worth one half of a dinar.

### Part 12
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain Arab merchant woman [<i>taya’ata</i>] who brought a sack [<i>ḥayeta</i>] of phylacteries in front of Abaye. He said to her:</b> Would <b>you give me each pair for a date? She became full of anger,</b> and <b>took</b> the phylacteries and <b>threw them into the river</b> because Abaye offered her such a small amount in exchange for them. Abaye <b>said</b> in remorse: <b>I should not have denigrated</b> the phylacteries <b>so much in her presence,</b> but rather, I should have offered to pay her their actual value.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A man <b>who divorces his wife due to</b> her <b>bad reputation,</b> i.e., he heard that she had committed adultery, <b>may not remarry</b> her, even if it becomes clear that she did not in fact commit adultery. Similarly, if one divorces his wife <b>due to a vow</b> that she took, and he could not live with her under the conditions of her vow, <b>he may not remarry</b> her. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he divorces her due to <b>any vow that the public was aware of, he may not remarry</b> her, <b>but</b> if he divorces her due to a vow <b>that the public was not aware of, he may remarry</b> her.

### Part 14
The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> If he divorces her due to <b>any vow that requires investigation</b> and dissolution <b>by a halakhic authority, he may not bring remarry</b> her, <b>but</b> if he divorces her due to a vow <b>that does not require investigation</b> and dissolution <b>by a halakhic authority,</b> and is dissolved even without that, <b>he may bring remarry</b> her. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: They prohibited</b> him from remarrying her in <b>this</b> case, where she stated a vow that requires dissolution by a halakhic authority, <b>only due to that</b> case, where she stated a vow that does not require dissolution by a halakhic authority.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, said:</b> There was <b>an incident in Tzaidan involving one</b> man <b>who said to his wife:</b> It is <b><i>konam</i>,</b> i.e., it is forbidden like an offering, <b>if I do not divorce you, and he divorced her; and the Sages permitted him to remarry</b> her <b>for the betterment of the world.</b>

### Part 16
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: And</b> the <i>halakha</i> stated in the mishna, which says that in certain cases a man who divorces his wife may not remarry her, <b>is</b> only applicable <b>when he said to her</b> explicitly: <b>I am removing you</b> from the house <b>due to your bad reputation,</b>
