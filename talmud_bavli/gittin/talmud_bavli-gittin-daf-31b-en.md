### Part 1
It means <b>from the time</b> that it was <b>set aside until the</b> same <b>time</b> the day after it was set aside. In other words, he must be concerned about all of the untithed produce that he had rendered fit after the first twenty-four hour period from when he set aside the produce or money had passed.

### Part 2
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>If</b> he discovers that <b>they were lost,</b> then <b>he must be concerned</b> that the produce or money that he set aside was lost <b>from the time until the</b> same <b>time. Granted, according to the one who said</b> that this means <b>from the time</b> it was <b>checked</b> and found to be lost <b>until the</b> same <b>time</b> of day on the previous day, it works out <b>well,</b> as the wine is presumed to have turned to vinegar from that moment.

### Part 3
<b>But according to the one who said</b> that this means <b>from the time</b> that it was <b>set aside until the</b> same <b>time</b> the day after it was set aside, <b>this</b> expression: <b>From the time until the</b> same <b>time,</b> is imprecise, as the presumption is that the wine turned to vinegar dating back to the day after it had been set aside. Therefore, it <b>should have</b> said: One is concerned going back <b>until</b> then <b>from the time</b> it was set aside <b>to the</b> same <b>time</b> the following day, i.e., twenty-four hours after it had been set aside. The Gemara comments: The wording of the mishna is <b>difficult</b> according to that opinion.

### Part 4
The mishna teaches that this is <b>the statement of</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b> The <i>amora</i> <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Rabbi Elazar’s colleagues disagree with him, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 2:2): In the case of <b>a ritual bath</b> that was known to have contained the requisite forty <i>se’a</i>, <b>which was</b> then <b>measured and found deficient</b> in its quantity of water, <b>all pure items that had been rendered</b> pure <b>in it, retroactive</b> to when the ritual bath was last measured, <b>whether</b> this ritual bath is found <b>in the private domain or in the public domain, are impure.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara comments: It <b>is obvious that</b> those who ascribe to the statement of that mishna <b>disagree</b> with Rabbi Elazar the <i>tanna</i>. What novel idea is Rabbi Elazar the <i>amora</i> teaching? The Gemara answers: It is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>what</b> the term <b>retroactive</b> is referring to is any item that was immersed and purified <b>from the time</b> it was found to be deficient <b>until the</b> same <b>time</b> the previous day, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar. Therefore, he <b>teaches us</b> that in fact they disagree and deem impure all items immersed from the time that the ritual bath had last been checked.

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One checks the wine <b>at three times</b> during the year. One of these times is when the east wind blows at the conclusion of the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>. A Sage <b>taught:</b> It is checked <b>when the east wind blows at the conclusion of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>in</b> the <b>season</b> of <i>Tishrei</i>, i.e., autumn. However, if the summer continues until the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, then in the event of this unusual occurrence one does not check the wine.

### Part 7
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>at three times</b> during the year <b>one sells the grain: Before</b> the time of <b>the sowing, and during the time of the sowing, and before the</b> festival of <b>Passover. And at three times</b> of the year <b>one sells the wine: Before the</b> festival of <b>Passover, and before</b> the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i>, and before the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>And oil</b> is sold <b>from</b> the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i> and onward.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> was this stated? One may sell these products whenever he so desires. <b>Rava said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Pappa</b> who said: This <i>halakha</i> was stated <b>with regard to partners,</b> as one partner may sell these products without the permission of the other only at these times of the year. At other times, he must first receive permission from his partner. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> i.e., after the latest of the three times has passed, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rava said: Every day is its time</b> to be sold.

### Part 8
§ Having mentioned the east wind, the Gemara quotes a related verse: <b>“And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a vehement [<i>ḥarishit</i>] east wind”</b> (Jonah 4:8). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the word <b>“<i>ḥarishit</i>”? Rav Yehuda says:</b> It means a wind that plows [<i>ḥoreshet</i>], as <b>at the time that</b> the wind <b>blows, it forms many furrows in the sea,</b> as though it were plowing the sea.

### Part 9
<b>Rabba said to him: If that is so,</b> then <b>that which is written</b> in the continuation of the verse: <b>“And the sun beat upon the head of Jonah and he fainted”</b> (Jonah 4:8), is difficult; it seems from the continuation of the verse that the wind was not extremely hot, not strong. <b>Rather, Rabba says: At the time that it blows, it silences all the winds before it.</b> Therefore, it is called <i>ḥarishit</i>, because all other winds are silent [<i>maḥarishot</i>] before it. Since only this wind was blowing, it became very hot. <b>And this is as it is written: “You whose garments are hot, when the earth is still by reason of the south wind”</b> (Job 37:17). <b>Rabbi Taḥalifa bar Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> in explanation of this verse: <b>When are your garments hot,</b> i.e., when is there the greatest heat? It is <b>when the earth is still by reason of the south wind, as at the time that</b> the southern wind <b>blows, it silences all the winds before it.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda were sitting,</b> and <b>Geneiva passed by them. One said to the other: Let us stand before him, as he is a son of</b> the <b>Torah. The other said to him: Shall we stand before a quarrelsome</b> person? <b>In the meantime,</b> Geneiva <b>came to them</b> and <b>said to them: With what were you dealing</b> when you were sitting together? <b>They said to him:</b> We were dealing <b>with winds.</b>

### Part 11
<b>He said to them: This is what Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says</b> that <b>Rav says: Four winds blow on each day, and the north wind blows</b> together <b>with each of</b> the other three; <b>as, if this were not so</b> and the northern wind did not blow, then <b>the world would not survive</b> for <b>even one hour. And the south wind is harsher than all of them, and were it not</b> for the angel called <b>Ben Netz,</b> who <b>stops it</b> from blowing even harder, then it would <b>destroy the entire world before it, as it is stated: “Does the hawk [<i>netz</i>] soar by your wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?”</b> (Job 39:26).

### Part 12
The Gemara also relates that <b>Rava and Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak were sitting,</b> and <b>Rav Naḥman bar Ya’akov was passing</b> by them <b>while sitting on a gilt carriage [<i>goharka</i>] and</b> with <b>a green cloak [<i>sarbela</i>] spread over him. Rava went to him,</b> but <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak did not go to him. He said: Perhaps they are members of the house of the Exilarch. Rava needs them,</b> but <b>I do not need them.</b>

### Part 13
<b>When he saw that it was Rav Naḥman bar Ya’akov, he</b> also <b>went to him.</b> Rav Naḥman bar Ya’akov <b>uncovered his arm</b> due to the heat and <b>said:</b> The wind called <b>Shadya is blowing. Rava says</b> that <b>this is</b> what <b>Rav says</b> about this wind: <b>A woman miscarries in its</b> wake. <b>And Shmuel says: Even a pearl [<i>margalit</i>] that is in the sea decomposes in its</b> wake. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even the semen that is in a woman’s womb putrefies in its</b> wake.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak,</b> who was present, <b>said</b> about their statements: <b>And the three of them derived</b> their statements <b>from one verse,</b> as it is stated: <b>“For though he be fruitful among the reed-plants, an east wind shall come, the wind of the Lord coming up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry,</b> and his fountain shall be dried up; he shall spoil the treasure of all precious vessels” (Hosea 13:15). The statement that a woman miscarries in its wake is based on the phrase <b>“His spring shall become dry,”</b> as <b>this</b> is referring to <b>a woman’s womb.</b> With regard to the phrase <b>“And his fountain shall be dried up,” this</b> is referring to the <b>semen that is in a woman’s womb.</b> And with regard to the phrase <b>“He shall spoil the treasure of all precious vessels,” this</b> is referring to <b>a pearl in the sea.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rava says: This</b> Sage <b>is from Sura, as they are precise</b> with <b>verses.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>“Though he be fruitful [<i>yafri</i>] among the reed-plants”? Rava said: Even</b>
