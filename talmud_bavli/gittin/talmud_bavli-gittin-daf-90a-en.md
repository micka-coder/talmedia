### Part 1
<b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>she is permitted to both of them.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Beit Shammai say: A man may not divorce his wife unless he finds</b> out <b>about her</b> having engaged in <b>a matter of forbidden sexual intercourse [<i>devar erva</i>],</b> i.e., she committed adultery or is suspected of doing so, <b>as it is stated: “Because he has found some unseemly matter [<i>ervat davar</i>] in her,</b> and he writes her a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1).

### Part 3
<b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> He may divorce her <b>even</b> due to a minor issue, e.g., because <b>she burned</b> or over-salted <b>his dish, as it is stated: “Because he has found some unseemly matter in her,”</b> meaning that he found any type of shortcoming in her.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> He may divorce her <b>even</b> if <b>he found another woman</b> who is <b>better looking than her</b> and wishes to marry her, <b>as it is stated</b> in that verse: <b>“And it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1).

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: But isn’t</b> the word <b>“matter” already stated</b> in the verse, indicating that any disadvantageous matter is a legitimate reason for divorce? <b>Beit Shammai said to them: But isn’t</b> the word <b>“unseemly [<i>ervat</i>]” already stated?</b>

### Part 6
<b>Beit Hillel said to them: If</b> the word <b>“unseemly” had been stated and</b> the word <b>“matter” had not been stated, I would have said</b> that a wife <b>should leave</b> her husband <b>due to forbidden sexual intercourse,</b> but <b>she should not</b> have to <b>leave</b> him <b>due to</b> any other <b>matter. Therefore,</b> the word <b>“matter” is stated. And if</b> the word <b>“matter” had been stated and</b> the word <b>“unseemly” had not been stated, I would have said</b> that if he divorced her merely <b>due to</b> a disadvantageous <b>matter she may marry another</b> man, as the Torah continues: “And she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2). <b>But</b> if she was divorced <b>due to</b> her engaging in <b>forbidden sexual intercourse, she may not marry another</b> man, as she is prohibited from remarrying. <b>Therefore,</b> the word <b>“unseemly” is stated,</b> indicating that even a wife who is divorced due to adultery is permitted to remarry.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And what do Beit Shammai do with this</b> word <b>“matter”?</b> How do they interpret it? It seems superfluous, as in their opinion the verse refers specifically to a wife who engaged in forbidden sexual intercourse. The Gemara answers: The word <b>“matter” is stated here,</b> with regard to divorce, <b>and</b> the word <b>“matter” is stated there,</b> with regard to testimony: <b>“At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, a matter shall be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15). <b>Just as there,</b> it is stated that a matter is established only <b>through two witnesses, so too here,</b> a matter of forbidden sexual intercourse justifies divorce only if it is established <b>through two witnesses.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And Beit Hillel</b> would respond to this analogy in the following manner: <b>Is it written:</b> Because he has found something <b>unseemly in a matter [<i>erva bedavar</i>],</b> indicating that it was established through the testimony of two witnesses that she engaged in adultery? <b>And Beit Shammai</b> would respond to Beit Hillel’s interpretation as follows: <b>Is it written:</b> Because he has found <b>either</b> something <b>unseemly or</b> another <b>matter <i>[o erva o davar</i>],</b> in accordance with Beit Hillel’s understanding?

### Part 9
<b>And Beit Hillel</b> would respond that <b>for this</b> reason the expression <b>“some unseemly matter [<i>ervat davar</i>]” is written, as it indicates that</b> interpretation, i.e., that a husband is not obligated to divorce his wife unless there are two witnesses to her having engaged in forbidden sexual intercourse, <b>and it</b> also <b>indicates this</b> interpretation, i.e., that he may divorce her due to any deficiency, be it adultery or any other shortcoming.

### Part 10
§ It is stated in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> He may divorce her <b>even</b> if <b>he found another woman</b> who is better looking than her. <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the application of <b>Reish Lakish’s</b> statement, <b>as Reish Lakish said</b> that the term <b><i>ki</i></b> actually <b>has</b> at least <b>four</b> distinct <b>meanings: If, perhaps, rather,</b> and <b>because.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Beit Shammai hold</b> that the verse <b>“And it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes, because [<i>ki</i>] he has found some unseemly matter in her”</b> means that she did not find favor in his eyes <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>he has found some unseemly matter in her. And Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that the phrase <b>“because [<i>ki</i>] he has found some unseemly matter in her”</b> means: <b>Or if he has found some unseemly matter in her.</b>

### Part 12
§ <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava:</b> According to Beit Hillel, if the husband <b>found about her neither forbidden sexual intercourse nor</b> any other <b>matter,</b> but divorced her anyway, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the divorce valid?

### Part 13
Rava <b>said to him</b> that the answer can be derived <b>from what the Merciful One reveals</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to a rapist: “He may not send her away all his days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:29), indicating that even if he divorces the woman whom he raped and was subsequently commanded to marry, <b>all his days he stands</b> commanded <b>to arise and remarry</b> her as his wife. Evidently, <b>specifically there</b> the husband is obligated to remarry his divorcée, <b>as the Merciful One reveals</b> as much. <b>But here, what he did, he did.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya said to Rava: If he intends to divorce her and she is living with him and serving him, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rava <b>read</b> the following verse <b>about</b> such a person: <b>“Devise not evil against your neighbor, seeing he dwells securely by you”</b> (Proverbs 3:29).

### Part 15
§ It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sota</i> 5:9) that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: Just as there are</b> different <b>attitudes with regard to food, so too, there are</b> different <b>attitudes with regard to women.</b> With regard to food, <b>you have a person who,</b> when <b>a fly falls into his cup, he throws out</b> the wine with the fly <b>and does not drink it. And this is</b> comparable to <b>the demeanor of Pappos ben Yehuda</b> with regard to his wife, <b>as he would lock</b> the door <b>before his wife and leave</b> so that she would not see any other man.

### Part 16
<b>And you have a person who,</b> when <b>a fly falls into his cup, he throws out</b> the fly <b>and drinks</b> the wine. <b>And this is</b> comparable to <b>the demeanor of any</b> common <b>man, whose</b> wife <b>speaks with her siblings and relatives, and he lets her</b> do so.

### Part 17
<b>And you have a man who,</b> when <b>a fly falls into</b> his <b>serving bowl, he sucks</b> the fly <b>and eats</b> the food. <b>This is the demeanor of a bad man, who sees his wife going out</b> into the street <b>with her head uncovered, and spinning in the marketplace</b> immodestly,
