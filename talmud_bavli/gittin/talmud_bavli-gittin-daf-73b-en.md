### Part 1
<b>like a married woman with regard to all of her matters,</b> and she remains forbidden to other men. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It is uncertain whether <b>she is divorced or</b> whether <b>she is not divorced.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:4): If, after the giving of this bill of divorce witnesses <b>saw that she secluded herself with</b> her husband <b>in the dark, or that she slept with him under the foot of the bed, one is not concerned</b> that <b>perhaps they were engaged in another matter,</b> i.e., sexual intercourse. <b>And one is concerned due to</b> their action of <b>licentiousness but one is not concerned</b> that <b>due to</b> their actions they performed <b>a betrothal. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: One is also concerned</b> that <b>due to</b> their actions they performed <b>a betrothal.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <i>baraita</i> <b>saying? Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If <b>they saw that she engaged in sexual intercourse</b> with her husband, then <b>there one is concerned</b> that <b>due to</b> their actions there was <b>a betrothal</b> and perhaps through this act he intended to remarry her. If <b>he gave her money</b> immediately following the sexual intercourse <b>one is concerned due to licentiousness, wherein we say: He gave</b> this money <b>as hire for a prostitute, but one is not concerned</b> that <b>due to</b> their actions they performed <b>a betrothal. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: Even in this</b> case <b>one is concerned</b> that <b>due to</b> their actions they performed <b>a betrothal,</b> i.e., one is concerned that he gave her the money as betrothal.

### Part 4
Based on this explanation of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says,</b> that <b>the dispute</b> between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel (81a) is relevant only <b>when they saw that she engaged in sexual intercourse</b> with her husband, but if <b>they did not see that she engaged in sexual intercourse</b> with him, <b>everyone agrees that she does not require a second bill of divorce from him?</b> In the case of a divorced woman who was secluded with her husband after the divorce, Beit Shammai are of the opinion that she does not require a second bill of divorce, while Beit Hillel are of the opinion that she does. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> is this?

### Part 5
The Gemara explains: It is <b>in accordance with everyone.</b> It is in accordance with the opinion of both the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who hold that when they did not see that she engaged in sexual intercourse one is not concerned that they are betrothed, and she does not need a second bill of divorce.

### Part 6
<b>Abaye objects to this</b> understanding of the <i>baraita</i>, according to which the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, disagree about a case where he gave her money after they engaged in sexual intercourse: <b>Is anything</b> with regard to <b>money taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>?

### Part 7
<b>Rather, Abaye said: This is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If <b>they saw that she engaged in sexual intercourse one is concerned due to licentiousness, but one is not concerned</b> that <b>due to</b> their actions there was <b>a betrothal. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: One is also concerned</b> that <b>due to</b> their actions there was <b>a betrothal.</b>

### Part 8
If so, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The dispute</b> between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel applies only <b>when they saw that she engaged in sexual intercourse</b> with him. <b>But</b> if <b>they did not see that she engaged in sexual intercourse</b> with him then <b>everyone agrees that she does not require a second bill of divorce from him.</b> In accordance <b>with whose</b> opinion is this statement?

### Part 9
It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as he holds in accordance with Beit Hillel, that if they saw that she engaged in sexual intercourse one is concerned that she may be betrothed to him and she requires a second bill of divorce. By contrast, according to the first <i>tanna</i>, even when they saw that she engaged in sexual intercourse one is not concerned that she may be betrothed.

### Part 10
<b>Rava objects to this: If so, what</b> is the meaning of the expression used by Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda: There is <b>also</b> concern that due to their actions they performed a betrothal? If there is concern about betrothal there should be no concern with regard to licentiousness.

### Part 11
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>this is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: Even</b> if <b>they did not see that she engaged in sexual intercourse, one is concerned</b> that <b>due to</b> their actions they performed <b>a betrothal.</b>

### Part 12
And if so, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The dispute</b> between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel applies only <b>where they saw that she engaged in sexual intercourse</b> with him. <b>But</b> if <b>they did not see that she engaged in intercourse</b> with him, then <b>everyone agrees that she does not require</b> a second <b>bill of divorce from him.</b> In accordance <b>with whose</b> opinion is this statement?

### Part 13
This is <b>not in accordance with</b> any <b>one</b> of the <i>tanna’im</i>, for according to Rava the first <i>tanna</i> is not concerned about betrothal even when they saw that she engaged in sexual intercourse, and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, is concerned even when they did not witness that she engaged in sexual intercourse.

### Part 14
§ The mishna teaches: <b>What is</b> her status <b>during these days? Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> She is <b>like a married woman with regard to all of her matters. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It is uncertain whether <b>she is divorced or</b> whether <b>she is not divorced.</b>

### Part 15
The Sages <b>taught</b> in reference to the opinions of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei stated in the <i>baraita</i>: Their dispute with regard to her status in the interim is stated <b>provided that he dies.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>And when he dies, is</b> this a valid <b>bill of divorce?</b> Do they hold that the bill of divorce takes effect after the husband’s death? <b>But don’t we maintain that there is no bill of divorce after death? Rabba says</b> that this is referring to a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>says:</b> This should be a valid bill of divorce <b>from</b> the last <b>moment that I am in the world,</b> meaning that it should take effect a moment before he dies.

### Part 16
<b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:4): In a case where the husband said: This is your bill of divorce from now if I die from this illness, <b>during the days between,</b> before he dies, <b>her husband is entitled to</b> anything that <b>she finds,</b> i.e., any lost item that cannot be returned to its owner, in accordance with the rabbinic principle that any lost item found by a wife belongs to her husband. <b>And</b> he is entitled to the profits from <b>her earnings, and</b> he is entitled to <b>annul her vows</b> (see Numbers 30:7–9), <b>and he inherits</b> from <b>her</b> if she predeceases him,
