### Part 1
that <b>what he</b> initially <b>forbade he</b> then <b>permitted,</b> enabling her to marry anyone she wishes, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if he said the second time that she is permitted <b>to</b> marry <b>Reuven?</b> Did he mean that she is permitted <b>to</b> marry <b>Reuven and the same is true</b> with regard <b>to Shimon,</b> i.e., she is permitted to marry him as well? Is the fact <b>that he mentioned</b> only that she is permitted <b>to</b> marry <b>Reuven because he opened</b> his prior qualification <b>by</b> mentioning <b>him</b> before he mentioned Shimon, but he intended to permit her to marry Shimon as well? <b>Or</b> did he, <b>perhaps, specifically</b> intend to permit her <b>to</b> marry <b>Reuven?</b>

### Part 2
<b>And if you say</b> that he intended to permit her <b>to</b> marry <b>specifically Reuven</b> and not Shimon, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if he said that she is permitted <b>to</b> marry <b>Shimon?</b> Did he mean that she is permitted <b>to</b> marry <b>Shimon and the same is true</b> with regard <b>to Reuven, and</b> the fact <b>that he mentioned</b> only <b>Shimon is because he ended</b> his initial previous statement <b>by</b> mentioning <b>him? Or perhaps</b> he was <b>specifically</b> referring only <b>to Shimon?</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Ashi raises</b> another <b>dilemma</b> with regard to the same case: If he said to her the second time: You are <b>also</b> permitted <b>to</b> marry <b>Shimon, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the word <b>also referring to Reuven,</b> i.e., she is permitted to marry Shimon in addition to Reuven, <b>or perhaps</b> it is <b>also referring to everyone,</b> i.e., she is permitted to marry Shimon in addition to all men, but not Reuven? The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 4
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:1): <b>After the death of Rabbi Eliezer, four Sages entered</b> the discussion <b>to refute his statement. They were: Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, Rabbi Tarfon, Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, and Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Tarfon responded</b> to Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, <b>saying:</b> If after the husband stipulated that the wife not marry a certain man <b>she went and married the brother of the one to whom she was prohibited</b> from marrying, <b>and</b> this husband <b>died without children,</b> she cannot perform levirate marriage with her husband’s brother, because he is forbidden to her due to the stipulation of her first husband. <b>Is</b> the first husband <b>not found</b> to be <b>uprooting a matter of Torah law</b> through his stipulation? <b>You have therefore derived that this is not</b> an act of <b>severance.</b> The divorce is not valid, as the Torah would not sanction a manner of divorce that can cause a mitzva to be nullified.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yosei</b> also <b>responded</b> to Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, <b>saying: Where do we find</b> an example of something that is <b>forbidden to this</b> person <b>and permitted to that</b> other person? <b>What is forbidden is forbidden to everyone, and what is permitted is permitted to everyone.</b> This contradicts Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion that a divorcée can be prohibited from marrying a certain man and permitted to marry all other men. <b>You have therefore derived that this is not</b> an act of <b>severance.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya responded, saying:</b> What is the meaning of the expression: “Scroll of <b>severance,”</b> which is used in the Torah for a bill of divorce? It means <b>something that severs</b> the bond <b>between him and her</b> entirely. This woman, by contrast, is still bound to her husband after their divorce, as his stipulation prevents her from marrying a certain man. <b>You have therefore derived that this is not</b> an act of <b>severance.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Akiva responded, saying:</b> If after the husband stipulated that the wife not marry a certain man <b>she went and married a man from the</b> general <b>public, and she had children</b> with him, <b>and she was</b> subsequently <b>widowed or divorced</b> from the second husband, <b>and she</b> then <b>arose and married the one to whom she was forbidden</b> by her first husband’s condition, <b>isn’t the bill of divorce</b> thereby <b>found</b> to be <b>nullified? And</b> would this not render <b>her children</b> from her second marriage as <b>born from an adulterous relationship [<i>mamzerim</i>],</b> as she is retroactively considered her first husband’s wife? <b>You have therefore derived that this is not</b> an act of <b>severance,</b> as the Torah would not enable a divorce that could lead to such a situation.

### Part 9
Rabbi Akiva continued to offer <b>an alternative</b> refutation of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion: If <b>the one to whom she was forbidden was a priest, and</b> her ex-husband <b>who divorced</b> her <b>died, is she not</b> thereby <b>found</b> to be <b>a widow with regard to him,</b> as she was considered a married woman with regard to this priest even after her divorce, <b>and a divorcée with regard to any</b> other <b>man?</b> Nevertheless, she is forbidden to him too, just as she is forbidden to any other priest.

### Part 10
<b>And</b> it is therefore <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that <b>just as</b> the prohibition for <b>a divorcée</b> to marry a priest (see Leviticus 21:14) <b>is</b> a relatively <b>minor</b> prohibition, yet <b>she is forbidden</b> to this priest <b>due to the element of divorce that applies to her,</b> even though with regard to him she is not a divorcée but a widow, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that the prohibition against sexual intercourse with <b>a married woman, which is a major</b> prohibition, should apply to every man during the lifetime of the ex-husband, due to the fact that she is considered a married woman with regard to this one man? <b>You have therefore derived that this is not</b> an act of <b>severance,</b> as this divorce does not permit her to marry any man.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to them:</b> Even though your objections are valid, <b>one does not refute</b> the opinion of <b>a lion after</b> his <b>death.</b> After a Sage has passed away one cannot reject his opinion based on a difficulty with it, as he possibly would have provided an answer had it been presented to him while he was still alive.

### Part 12
<b>Rava said: All of</b> the previously mentioned responses <b>have refutations</b> that can be raised against them <b>except for</b> the response <b>of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, which does not have a refutation.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, as <b>Rabbi Yosei said: I see the statement of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya</b> as preferable <b>to the statements of all</b> the other Sages.

### Part 13
The Gemara commences discussion of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> that <b>Rabbi Tarfon responded, saying:</b> If <b>she went and married the brother of the one to whom she was prohibited</b> from marrying, <b>and he died without children, is</b> the first husband <b>not</b> thereby <b>found</b> to be <b>uprooting a matter of Torah law?</b> The Gemara asks: What is the meaning of the question: Is the first husband not <b>uprooting</b> a matter of Torah law? Is it <b>he</b> who <b>is uprooting</b> the mitzva? <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Tarfon means that the husband <b>is stipulating to uproot a matter of Torah law.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara questions this assertion as well: Is the husband <b>stipulating</b> to uproot a mitzva? <b>Did he say to her</b> that <b>it is not sufficient if she does not marry the brother of that man,</b> who he rendered forbidden to her? Since he did not stipulate this, he did not uproot the mitzva; it is the woman who uprooted the mitzva by marrying specifically that man’s brother. <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Tarfon means that the husband <b>is causing a matter of Torah law to be uprooted.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: He <b>is causing</b> of matter of Torah law to be uprooted? <b>But if that is so,</b> one <b>should not marry his brother’s daughter lest he die without children, and he will</b> thereby <b>be found</b> to be <b>causing a matter of Torah law to be uprooted</b> in that his brother will not be able to perform levirate marriage with his own daughter, and the Sages laud one who marries his brother’s daughter. The Gemara responds: <b>This is the refutation</b> against Rabbi Tarfon’s response that Rava was referring to.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to what</b> case did Rabbi Tarfon refute Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion? <b>If we say</b> that it was <b>with regard to</b> a case in which the husband said that his wife is permitted to marry any man <b>except</b> for so-and-so, the refutation is irrelevant, as <b>Rabbi Eliezer permits</b> the woman to marry this man after she married another man.

### Part 17
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:1): <b>With regard to</b> a case where a man <b>divorces his wife and said to her</b> while handing her the bill of divorce: <b>You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man except for so-and-so, and she went and married someone from the</b> general <b>public and was</b> subsequently <b>widowed or divorced</b> from him, <b>Rabbi Eliezer concedes that she is</b> now <b>permitted to</b> marry the man <b>whom she was</b> initially <b>prohibited</b> from marrying by the qualification of her first husband.

### Part 18
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Tarfon’s refutation was clearly stated <b>with regard to</b> a case where the woman was divorced <b>on the condition</b> that she would not marry so-and-so. A condition still applies after the woman remarries and its violation nullifies the divorce retroactively.

### Part 19
The <i>baraita</i> states that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili responded, saying: Where do we find</b> an example of something that is <b>forbidden to this</b> person <b>and permitted to that</b> other person? <b>What is forbidden is forbidden to everyone and what is permitted is permitted to everyone.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> there <b>not</b> such an example? <b>Aren’t <i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, <b>and sacrificial</b> meat <b>forbidden to this</b> group, i.e., non-priests (see Leviticus 22:10), <b>and permitted to that</b> group, i.e., priests? The Gemara answers: <b>We are referring to a forbidden woman.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>Aren’t those</b> women <b>with whom relations are prohibited</b> due to familial ties forbidden to some men, i.e., their relatives, and permitted to others? The Gemara answers: <b>We are referring to</b> a woman who is forbidden due to <b>marriage.</b>

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t a married woman</b> forbidden to all men but permitted to her husband? The Gemara responds: <b>This is the refutation</b> against Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s response that Rava was referring to.

### Part 22
The Gemara clarifies: <b>And with regard to what</b> case did Rabbi Yosei HaGelili raise this objection? <b>If we say</b> that it was <b>with regard to</b> a case in which the divorce was granted <b>on the condition</b> that she not marry a certain man, she is not entirely forbidden to him, as <b>she is permitted</b> to engage <b>in licentiousness with him;</b> the condition was with regard to marriage, not licentiousness. <b>Rather,</b> he clearly raised the objection <b>with regard to</b> a case where the husband told his wife that she is permitted to marry any man <b>except</b> for so-and-so, rendering her entirely forbidden to that man.

### Part 23
The <i>baraita</i> states that <b>Rabbi Akiva responded, saying:</b> If <b>she went and married a man from the</b> general <b>public, and she had children</b> with him, <b>and she was</b> subsequently <b>widowed or divorced</b> from this second husband, <b>and she</b> then <b>arose and married the one to whom she was forbidden, isn’t the bill of divorce</b> thereby <b>nullified? And</b> would this not render <b>her children <i>mamzerim</i>?</b>

### Part 24
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> and there is a concern that she will eventually violate the condition, <b>in</b> a case of <b>any typical condition</b> that the husband attaches to the divorce <b>she should not remarry either, lest she not fulfill his condition and the bill of divorce</b> be <b>found</b> to be <b>nullified and her children</b> be rendered <b><i>mamzerim</i>.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>This is the refutation</b> against Rabbi Akiva’s response that Rava was referring to.

### Part 25
The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to what</b> case did Rabbi Akiva raise this objection? <b>If we say</b> that it was <b>with regard to</b> a case in which the husband said that his wife is permitted to marry any man <b>except</b> for so-and-so, the objection is irrelevant, as <b>Rabbi Eliezer permits</b> the woman to marry so-and-so after she marries another man.

### Part 26
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to</b> a case where a man <b>divorces his wife and said to her: You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man except for so-and-so, and she went and married someone from the</b> general <b>public, and was</b> subsequently <b>widowed or divorced</b> from him, <b>Rabbi Eliezer concedes that she is</b> now <b>permitted to</b> marry the man <b>whom she was</b> initially <b>prohibited</b> from marrying. <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Akiva’s objection was clearly <b>with regard to</b> a case of <b>a condition</b> that she would not marry so-and-so.

### Part 27
The <i>baraita</i> states that Rabbi Akiva added <b>an alternative</b> response: If <b>the one to whom she was forbidden was a priest, and</b> her ex-husband <b>who divorced</b> her <b>died, is she not found</b> to be <b>a widow with regard to him and a divorcée with regard to any</b> other <b>man? And</b> it is therefore <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that <b>just as</b> the prohibition against <b>a divorcée</b> marrying a priest <b>is minor,</b> and yet <b>she is forbidden</b> to this priest <b>due to the element of divorce that applies to her, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that the prohibition against relations with <b>a married woman, which is major,</b> should apply to every man during the lifetime of the ex-husband, due to the fact that she is considered a married woman with regard to this one man? Therefore, the divorce does not take effect.

### Part 28
The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to what</b> case was this objection raised? <b>If we say</b> that it was <b>with regard to</b> a case of <b>a condition,</b>
