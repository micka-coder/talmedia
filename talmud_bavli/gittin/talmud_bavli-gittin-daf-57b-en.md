### Part 1
§ With regard to the Babylonian exile following the destruction of the First Temple, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: An old man from</b> among <b>the inhabitants of Jerusalem related to me: In this valley</b> that lies before you, <b>Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard</b> of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar, <b>killed 2,110,000</b> people. <b>And in Jerusalem</b> itself <b>he killed 940,000</b> people <b>on one stone, until the blood</b> of his victims <b>flowed and touched the blood of Zechariah to fulfill what is stated: “And blood touches blood”</b> (Hosea 4:2).

### Part 2
The Gemara clarifies the details of what happened: Nebuzaradan <b>found the blood of Zechariah,</b> the son of Jehoiada the priest, and saw <b>that it was bubbling up</b> from the ground, and <b>he said: What is this?</b> Those in the Temple <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>sacrificial blood that had been poured</b> there. <b>He brought</b> animal <b>blood,</b> compared it to the blood bubbling up from the ground, <b>and</b> saw that <b>it was not similar</b> to it.

### Part 3
Nebuzaradan <b>said to</b> them: <b>If you tell me</b> whose blood this is, it will be <b>well</b> for you. <b>But if not, I will comb your flesh with iron combs. They said to him: What shall we say to you? He was a prophet among us, who used to rebuke us about heavenly matters,</b> and <b>we rose up against him, and killed him</b> (II Chronicles 24:20–22), <b>and for many years</b> now <b>his blood has not settled.</b>

### Part 4
Nebuzaradan <b>said to them: I will appease</b> Zechariah. <b>He brought</b> the members of <b>the Great Sanhedrin and</b> of <b>a lesser Sanhedrin</b> and <b>killed them alongside</b> the bubbling blood, <b>but</b> it still <b>did not settle.</b> He then brought <b>young men and virgins and killed them alongside it, but</b> it still <b>did not settle. He</b> then <b>brought schoolchildren and killed them alongside it, but</b> it still <b>did not settle.</b> Finally Nebuzaradan <b>said to him: Zechariah, Zechariah, I have killed the best of them.</b> Would it <b>please you if I destroyed them all? When he said this,</b> the blood at last <b>settled.</b>

### Part 5
<b>At that moment</b> Nebuzaradan <b>contemplated</b> the idea of <b>repentance</b> and <b>said</b> to himself: <b>If, for</b> the death of <b>one soul,</b> that of Zechariah, God punishes the Jewish people in <b>this</b> manner, then <b>that man,</b> that is to say, I, <b>who has killed all of those souls, all the more so</b> will be I be subject to great punishment from God. <b>He fled, sent to his house a document detailing</b> what was to be done with his property, <b>and converted</b> to Judaism.

### Part 6
A Sage <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> relating to this matter: <b>Naaman,</b> commander of the army of the king of Aram (see II Kings, chapter 5), was not a convert, as he did not accept all of the mitzvot, but rather he <b>was a <i>ger toshav</i>, a gentile who resides in Eretz Israel and observes the seven Noahide mitzvot. Nebuzaradan,</b> by contrast, <b>was a convert,</b> as explained previously.

### Part 7
The Gemara adds that some <b>of Haman’s descendants studied Torah in Bnei Brak,</b> and some <b>of Sisera’s descendants taught children</b> Torah <b>in Jerusalem,</b> and some <b>of Sennacherib’s descendants taught Torah in public. Who are they?</b> They are <b>Shemaya and Avtalyon,</b> the teachers of Hillel the Elder.

### Part 8
As for the incident involving the blood of Zechariah, <b>this is</b> alluded to by <b>that which is written: “I have set her blood upon the bare rock that it should not be covered”</b> (Ezekiel 24:8).

### Part 9
§ Apropos its discussion of the destruction of the Temple and the calamities that befell Israel, the Gemara cites the verse: <b>“The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau”</b> (Genesis 27:22), which the Sages expounded as follows: <b>“The voice”; this</b> is the cry stirred up by <b>the emperor Hadrian, who</b> caused the Jewish people to cry out when he <b>killed six hundred thousand on six hundred thousand in Alexandria of Egypt, twice</b> the number of men <b>who left Egypt. “The voice of Jacob”; this is</b> the cry aroused by <b>the emperor Vespasian, who killed four million</b> people <b>in the city of Beitar. And some say:</b> He killed <b>forty million</b> people. <b>“And the hands are the hands of Esau”; this is the wicked kingdom</b> of Rome <b>that destroyed our Temple, burned our Sanctuary, and exiled us from our land.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Alternatively, “the voice is the voice of Jacob”</b> means that <b>no prayer is effective</b> in the world <b>unless</b> some member of <b>the seed of Jacob has</b> a part <b>in it.</b> The second clause in the verse, <b>“and the hands are the hands of Esau,”</b> means that <b>no war grants victory unless</b> some member of <b>the seed of Esau has</b> a part <b>in it.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And this is</b> what <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The verse that says: <b>“You shall be hid from the scourge of the tongue”</b> (Job 5:21), means: <b>You shall</b> need to <b>hide on account of quarrels</b> provoked <b>by the tongue. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “By the rivers of Babylonia, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion”</b> (Psalms 137:1)? This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, showed David the destruction of the First Temple and the destruction of the Second Temple.</b> He saw the destruction of <b>the First Temple, as it is stated: “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down and wept.”</b> He saw the destruction of the <b>Second Temple, as it is written</b> later in that same psalm: <b>“Remember, O Lord, against the children of Edom the day of Jerusalem, when they said: Raze it, raze it, to its very foundation”</b> (Psalms 137:7), as the Second Temple was destroyed by the Romans, “the children of Edom.”

### Part 12
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Ami</b> who says this, <b>and some say</b> that <b>it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> There was <b>an incident involving four hundred boys and girls who were taken as captives for</b> the purpose of <b>prostitution.</b> These children <b>sensed on their own what they were expected</b> to do, and <b>they said: If we</b> commit suicide and <b>drown in the sea,</b> will <b>we come to</b> eternal <b>life in the World-to-Come? The oldest</b> child <b>among them expounded</b> the verse: <b>“The Lord said, I will bring back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea”</b> (Psalms 68:23). <b>“I will bring back from Bashan,”</b> i.e., <b>from between the teeth [<i>bein shen</i>] of the lion,</b> and <b>“I will bring them back from the depths of the sea”</b> is referring to <b>those who drown in the sea</b> for the sake of Heaven.

### Part 13
<b>When the girls heard this, they all leapt and fell into the sea. The boys</b> then <b>drew an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>with regard to themselves and said: If these</b> girls, <b>for whom</b> sexual intercourse with men <b>is their natural way,</b> act in <b>such</b> a manner, then <b>we, for whom</b> sexual intercourse with men <b>is not our natural way,</b> should <b>all the more so</b> conduct ourselves likewise. <b>They too leapt into the sea. Concerning them</b> and others like them <b>the verse states: “As For Your sake we are killed all the day long; we are reckoned as sheep for the slaughter”</b> (Psalms 44:23).

### Part 14
<b>And Rav Yehuda said: This</b> verse applies to the <b>woman and her seven sons</b> who died as martyrs for the sake of the sanctification of God’s name. The incident occurred as follows: <b>They brought</b> in <b>the first</b> of the woman’s sons <b>before the emperor</b> and <b>said to him: Worship the idol. He said to them:</b> I cannot do so, as <b>it is written in the Torah: “I am the Lord your God”</b> (Exodus 20:2). <b>They</b> immediately <b>took him out and killed him.</b>

### Part 15
<b>And they</b> then <b>brought</b> in <b>another</b> son <b>before the emperor,</b> and <b>said to him: Worship the idol. He said to them:</b> I cannot do so, as <b>it is written in the Torah: “You shall have no other gods beside Me”</b> (Exodus 20:3). And so <b>they took him out and killed him. They</b> then <b>brought in</b> yet <b>another</b> son before the emperor, and <b>said to him: Worship the idol. He said to them:</b> I cannot do so, as <b>it is written in the Torah: “He that sacrifices to any god,</b> save to the Lord only, <b>he shall be utterly destroyed”</b> (Exodus 22:19). And so <b>they took him out and killed him.</b>

### Part 16
<b>They</b> then <b>brought</b> in <b>another</b> son, and <b>said to him: Worship the idol. He said to them:</b> I cannot do so, as <b>it is written in the Torah: “You shall not bow down to any other god”</b> (Exodus 34:14). And so <b>they took him out and killed him. They</b> then <b>brought</b> in yet <b>another</b> son, and <b>said to him: Worship the idol. He said to them:</b> I cannot do so, as <b>it is written in the Torah: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:4). And so <b>they took him out and killed him.</b>

### Part 17
<b>They</b> then <b>brought</b> in <b>another</b> son, and <b>said to him: Worship the idol. He said to them:</b> I cannot do so, as <b>it is written in the Torah: “Know therefore this today, and consider it in your heart, that the Lord, He is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath; there is no other”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:39). And so <b>they took him out and killed him.</b>

### Part 18
<b>They</b> then <b>brought</b> in yet <b>another</b> son, and <b>said to him: Worship the idol. He said to them:</b> I cannot do so, as <b>it is written in the Torah: “You have avouched the Lord</b> this day to be your God…<b>and the Lord has avouched you this day</b> to be a people for His own possession” (Deuteronomy 26:17–18). <b>We already took an oath to the Holy One, Blessed be He, that we will not exchange Him for a different god, and He too has taken an oath to us that He will not exchange us for another nation.</b>

### Part 19
It was the youngest brother who had said this, and the emperor pitied him. Seeking a way to spare the boy’s life, <b>the emperor said to him: I will throw down my seal before you; bend over and pick it up, so that</b> people <b>will say</b> that <b>he has accepted the king’s authority [<i>harmana</i>].</b> The boy <b>said to him: Woe [<i>ḥaval</i>] to you, Caesar, woe to you, Caesar.</b> If you think that <b>for the sake of your honor</b> I should fulfill your command and do <b>this,</b> then <b>for the sake of the honor of the Holy One, Blessed be He, all the more so</b> should I fulfill His command.

### Part 20
As <b>they were taking him out to be killed, his mother said to them: Give him to me so that I may give him a small kiss. She said to him: My son, go and say to your father Abraham, You bound one</b> son to the <b>altar, but I bound seven altars. She too</b> in the end <b>went up to the roof, fell, and died. A Divine Voice emerged and said: “A joyful mother of children”</b> (Psalms 113:9), as she raised her children to be devoted in their service of God.

### Part 21
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says</b> concerning the verse: “For Your sake we are killed all the day long” (Psalms 44:23), that <b>this</b> is referring to <b>circumcision, which was given for the eighth</b> day, as the blood of our newborn sons is spilled for the sake of the covenant with God. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> This verse was stated in reference to <b>Torah scholars who demonstrate the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter on themselves,</b> meaning that they demonstrate on their own bodies how ritual slaughter should be performed and occasionally injure themselves in the process. This is <b>as Rava says: A person may demonstrate anything using himself</b> to illustrate the act <b>except for slaughter and another matter,</b> a euphemism for sexual intercourse.

### Part 22
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: These</b> people in the verse <b>are Torah scholars who kill themselves over the words of Torah, in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish. As Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: The words of the Torah endure only for one who kills himself over them, as it is stated: “This is the Torah, when a man dies in a tent”</b> (Numbers 19:14). <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Forty <i>se’a</i></b>
