<b>and with her garment open from both sides, and bathing with men,</b> and ignores it.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Can it enter your mind</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a wife who bathes <b>with men?</b> Even a man of the lowest moral character would not allow his wife to act in this manner. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that she bathes <b>in a place where men</b> often <b>bathe.</b>

### Part 3
The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>this</b> kind of wife, <b>it is a mitzva by Torah law to divorce her, as it is stated: “Because he has found some unseemly</b> matter in her, and he writes her a scroll of severance, and gives it in her hand, <b>and he sends her out of his house…And she goes and becomes another [<i>aḥer</i>] man’s wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1–2). <b>The verse called</b> the second husband <i>aḥer</i>, other, <b>to state that this</b> man <b>is not a peer of the first</b> husband. They are morally distinct, as <b>that</b> first husband <b>evicted a wicked woman from his house and this</b> second man <b>introduced a wicked woman into his house.</b>

### Part 4
If <b>the second</b> man <b>merits, he will send her out, as it is stated</b> in the following verse: <b>“And the latter husband hates</b> her…and he sends her out of his house” (Deuteronomy 24:3). <b>And if not, she will bury him, as it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“Or if the latter husband dies.”</b> It is <b>appropriate for him to</b> receive the punishment of <b>death, as that</b> first man <b>evicted a wicked woman from his house and this</b> second husband <b>introduced a wicked woman into his house.</b>

### Part 5
§ The prophet Malachi states in rebuke of those who divorce their wives: <b>“For I hate sending away,</b> says the Lord, the God of Israel” (Malachi 2:16). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The verse means that <b>if you hate</b> your wife, <b>send</b> her away. Do not continue living with a woman whom you hate. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The verse means that <b>one who sends</b> his wife away <b>is hated</b> by God.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> the Gemara explains that <b>they do not disagree. This</b> statement <b>is with regard to a first marriage,</b> i.e., one should tolerate his first wife and not divorce her, and <b>that</b> statement <b>is with regard to a second marriage,</b> in which case the husband should divorce his wife if he hates her.

### Part 7
<b>As Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who divorces his first wife, even the altar sheds tears over him, as it is stated: “And this further you do: You cover the altar of the Lord with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that He does not regard the offering anymore, nor does He receive it with goodwill from your hand. Yet you say: What for? Because the Lord has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion, and the wife of your covenant”</b> (Malachi 2:13–14). Clearly one should not divorce the wife of his youth, i.e., his first wife, as one who does so is hated by God for divorcing the woman to whom he was bound in companionship and covenant.
