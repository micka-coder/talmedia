### Part 1
<b>which is made to move,</b> i.e., it is not set in one place. Consequently, one can argue that the soil in the boat is not considered attached to the ground. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a flowerpot, which is not made to move,</b> as ordinarily a flowerpot remains in one place, <b>no,</b> one cannot reasonably claim that the fixed soil in it is not part of the ground, even when the pot itself is not touching the ground.

### Part 2
<b>Alternatively,</b> one can say the opposite: Perhaps <b>the Rabbis state</b> their opinion, that the soil in the boat is considered to be like the land itself, <b>only there, in</b> the case of <b>a boat, where there is no barrier of airspace</b> between the soil in the boat and the land below, <b>as water is considered to be like solid earth.</b> Therefore, the soil in the boat is viewed as connected to the earth, and has the status of Eretz Yisrael. <b>But</b> in the case of a perforated <b>pot, where there is a barrier of airspace, no,</b> the soil is not connected to the ground.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: With regard to</b> the <b>rivers that are in Eretz Yisrael</b> on which a boat is sailing, <b>everyone agrees</b> that a bill of divorce written on that boat is considered to be written in Eretz Yisrael. <b>However, when they disagree</b> it is <b>with regard to the Great Sea,</b> i.e., the Mediterranean Sea. In other words, is a boat located in the Mediterranean Sea considered to be in Eretz Yisrael or not?

### Part 4
<b>As it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Terumot</i> 2:12): <b>What is Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and what is outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael? <b>Any</b> slope <b>that descends at an angle from Turei Amnon</b> in Syria <b>and inward</b> toward Eretz Yisrael is part of <b>Eretz Yisrael. From Turei Amnon and outward,</b> northward, is considered <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. With regard to <b>the islands [<i>nissin</i>] that are in the sea, one views them as though a string were pulled taut over them from Turei Amnon</b> in the north <b>to the River of Egypt,</b> Wadi el-Arish, in the south. <b>From the string and inward,</b> i.e., east, is <b>Eretz Yisrael; from the string and outward,</b> west, is considered <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. This is the opinion of the Rabbis.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Any</b> place <b>that</b> is directly <b>across from Eretz Yisrael,</b> including the sea itself, <b>is considered</b> part <b>of Eretz Yisrael, as it is stated: “And for the western border, you shall have the Great Sea for a border, this shall be your west border”</b> (Numbers 34:6). According to this opinion, the entire territory directly across from Eretz Yisrael is considered part of Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>the islands that are on the sides,</b> which do not exactly line up on the north or the south, <b>one views them as though a string were pulled taut over them</b> in the north <b>from Kefalorya,</b> west of Turei Amnon, <b>to the Atlantic Ocean, and</b> in the south <b>from the River of Egypt</b> westward <b>until the Atlantic Ocean.</b> Those islands that lie <b>from the string and inward</b> are part of <b>Eretz Yisrael,</b> whereas those <b>from the string and outward</b> are <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis, what do they do with this</b> verse: <b>“And for the border”?</b> Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion that the border of Eretz Yisrael extends into the sea is apparently supported by this verse. The Gemara answers: <b>They require it to</b> teach that the <b>islands</b> themselves are considered to be within Eretz Yisrael. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> would respond that an additional <b>verse is not required</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> concerning the <b>islands,</b> as it is clear that they are part of Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Meir says: Akko is like Eretz Yisrael</b> with regard to bills of divorce. The Sages <b>raised a dilemma before Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: One who sells his slave to</b> a master in <b>Syria,</b> is <b>he considered like one who sells</b> his slave <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, in which case the seller is penalized by the emancipation of his slave, <b>or not?</b>

### Part 9
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to them: You learned</b> a resolution for this dilemma from the mishna: <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that <b>Akko</b> is <b>like Eretz Yisrael with regard to bills of divorce,</b> from which it may be inferred: <b>With regard to bills of divorce, yes,</b> but <b>with regard to slaves, no,</b> it is not considered part of Eretz Yisrael, <b>and all the more so Syria, which is far more distant</b> than Akko from the main areas of Eretz Yisrael. Therefore, this owner has sold his slave outside of Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 10
Having mentioned the status of Syria, the Gemara cites a related <i>halakha</i>. <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Kelim</i> 1:5): <b>In three ways Syria is equal to Eretz Yisrael, and in three</b> ways it is similar <b>to outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. The Gemara inserts <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the ways in which Syria is different than Eretz Yisrael and is similar to Eretz Yisrael: <b><i>Ayin beit</i>, <i>beit reish</i>, <i>reish kuf</i>.</b> Syria has the status of land that is outside of Eretz Yisrael in the following respects: First, <b>its soil is ritually impure like</b> that of land <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. <b>And</b> the second is that <b>one who sells his slave to</b> a master in <b>Syria is like one who sells</b> him to a master <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, and the second master is obligated to emancipate the slave. <b>And</b> third, <b>one who brings a bill of divorce from Syria is like one who brings</b> it <b>from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, in that he must say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence.

### Part 11
<b>And in three</b> ways Syria is similar <b>to Eretz Yisrael:</b> Its produce is <b>obligated in tithe and in</b> the mitzvot of <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>like Eretz Yisrael. And one who wishes to enter it</b> while remaining <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual purity may</b> so <b>enter,</b> as though it were part of Eretz Yisrael. <b>And one who acquires a field in Syria</b>
