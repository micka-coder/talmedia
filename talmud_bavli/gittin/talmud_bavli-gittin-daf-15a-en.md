### Part 1
<b>my brooch [<i>kevinati</i>] to my daughter, and</b> the brooch is worth <b>twelve hundred dinars. And</b> this woman subsequently <b>died, and the Sages fulfilled her statement.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>said to them</b> that <b>the sons of Rokhel should be buried by their mother,</b> i.e., he cursed them. Rabbi Elazar meant that it is not possible to bring a proof from this incident, as these sons were wicked people. Consequently, when dealing with them the Sages did not act in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>, but allowed their mother to give this valuable piece of jewelry to their sister, circumventing the <i>halakhot</i> of inheritance.

### Part 2
The Gemara states: <b>The first <i>tanna</i></b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who holds that there must be an actual act of acquisition or the money still belongs to the giver. <b>And Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Ya’akov also</b> hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b> However, they add that <b>even though</b> the giver <b>died one does not say: It is a mitzva to fulfill the statement of the dead. And</b> the Sages in the clause beginning: <b>Some say,</b> hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who say that the statement of a person on his deathbed effects acquisition through mere speech.

### Part 3
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi,</b> who <b>said</b> his opinion <b>in the name of Rabbi Meir,</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar. However,</b> he maintains that <b>where</b> the giver <b>died we say: It is a mitzva to fulfill the statement of the dead. And the Rabbis say: They should divide</b> it, because <b>they</b> are <b>uncertain</b> about the <i>halakha</i> in this situation. <b>And</b> according to the Sages in the clause beginning: <b>Here they said, the discretion</b> of the agent <b>is preferable. And Rabbi Shimon HaNasi came to teach us</b> a relevant <b>incident</b> but does not express an additional opinion.

### Part 4
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> those studying this issue: <b>Is</b> the <b>Rabbi Shimon HaNasi</b> mentioned here himself <b>a <i>Nasi</i>, or</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean <b>that he spoke in the name of the <i>Nasi</i>?</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that</b> which <b>Rav Yosef,</b> who was precise in his statements, <b>says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon HaNasi.</b> This indicates that he was an actual <i>Nasi</i>. <b>But</b> you can still <b>raise the dilemma: Is he a <i>Nasi</i>, or</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean <b>that he spoke in the name of the <i>Nasi</i>,</b> as Rav Yosef may merely be quoting the above <i>baraita</i>? The Gemara has no answer for this question, and states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 5
The Gemara returns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Yosef says: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon HaNasi,</b> that the money should be returned to the heirs of the sender. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But don’t we maintain</b> that <b>the statement of</b> a person <b>on his deathbed is considered written and delivered?</b> If so, the agent should give the money to the heirs of the recipient.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yosef establishes</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a healthy person,</b> not someone on his deathbed. The Gemara asks: <b>But he said</b> that the money should be returned <b>to the heirs of the sender, and we maintain</b> that <b>it is a mitzva to fulfill the statement of the dead,</b> even if he issued these instructions when he was healthy. The Gemara answers: Emend Rabbi Shimon HaNasi’s statement and <b>teach: Return</b> the money <b>to the sender,</b> not to his heirs, as this is referring to a case where the sender had not died.
