### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> An agent <b>who brings a bill of divorce [<i>get</i>]</b> from a husband to his wife <b>from a country overseas,</b> i.e., from outside of Eretz Yisrael to Eretz Yisrael, <b>is required to state</b> the following formula when he hands over the bill of divorce: This bill of divorce <b>was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabban Gamliel says: Even one who brings</b> a bill of divorce <b>from Rekem or from á¸¤eger,</b> which are on the periphery of Eretz Yisrael, must make this declaration. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Even</b> one who brings a bill of divorce <b>from the village of Ludim to Lod</b> must also make this declaration, despite the fact that these places are only a short distance apart. The reason is that the village of Ludim was not part of the main area settled by Jews in Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 3
<b>And the Rabbis say</b> that <b>one is required to say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, only</b> if he <b>brings</b> a bill of divorce <b>from a country overseas</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>and</b> the same applies to <b>one who delivers</b> a bill of divorce from Eretz Yisrael to a country overseas. <b>And</b> likewise an agent <b>who brings</b> a bill of divorce <b>from</b> one <b>region to</b> another <b>region within</b> the <b>overseas countries is</b> also <b>required to say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies not only to an agent who brings a bill of divorce from one country to another, but <b>even</b> to one who takes it <b>from</b> one <b>district [<i>hegmonya</i>] to</b> another <b>district</b> in the same country.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to the borders of Eretz Yisrael, <b>from Rekem eastward</b> is considered to be part of the overseas country, <b>and Rekem</b> itself <b>is like east</b> of Eretz Yisrael, i.e., it is outside of Eretz Yisrael. <b>From Ashkelon southward</b> is outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>and Ashkelon</b> itself <b>is like south</b> of Eretz Yisrael. Likewise, <b>from Akko northward</b> is outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>and Akko</b> itself <b>is like north</b> of Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rabbi Meir says: Akko is like Eretz Yisrael with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>bills of divorce.</b>

### Part 5
<b>One who brings a bill of divorce</b> from one place to another <b>within Eretz Yisrael is not required to say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence. And if there are those who contest it,</b> i.e., if the husband objects by saying that the bill of divorce is a forgery, <b>it should be ratified through its signatories.</b> The court must authenticate the signatures of the witnesses in order to ratify the document.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who brings a bill of divorce from a country overseas to Eretz Yisrael must say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this declaration? <b>Rabba says:</b>
