### Part 1
<b>if Rabbi Yosei says</b> that the date on which a document is written proves when it takes effect even when the husband stated <b>a verbal</b> condition as he handed it over, or <b>if</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>does not say</b> his principle in such a case.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But is</b> Rav Huna <b>uncertain</b> with regard to this matter? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (76b): If one says to his wife: <b>This is hereby your bill of divorce if I have not come</b> back here <b>from now until</b> the conclusion of <b>twelve months, and he died within twelve months,</b> then <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce</b> because the bill of divorce does not take effect until the end of twelve months, which is after the husband’s death? As a result, she is bound by a levirate bond if her husband has no children. <b>And it is taught with regard to</b> that mishna: <b>Our Rabbis</b> disagree, and <b>they</b> rendered it <b>permitted</b> for <b>her to marry,</b> because they are of the opinion that there is no levirate bond in this case.

### Part 3
<b>And we say: Who</b> represents the opinion cited as <b>our Rabbis? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> It is <b>the court that permitted</b> the consumption of <b>oil</b> manufactured by gentiles, <b>and they hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who says: The date</b> written <b>in a document proves</b> when <b>it</b> takes effect. Evidently, according to Rabbi Yosei this principle applies even when the husband made a verbal condition with regard to the bill of divorce.

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> it is necessary to say as follows: Rav Huna <b>is uncertain if</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> when the husband adds <b>a verbal</b> condition when giving the document, <b>or</b> if the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not</b> in accordance with Rabbi Yosei’s opinion in such a case.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>But is</b> Rav Huna <b>uncertain</b> with regard to this matter? <b>But didn’t Rava say:</b> If one says to his wife: <b>This is hereby your bill of divorce if I die, or:</b> “This is your bill of divorce <b>when I am dead,</b> then <b>this is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce?</b> If he said to her: <b>When I die,</b> or: <b>After</b> my <b>death,</b> then <b>this is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say that he said to her:</b> This is your bill of divorce <b>from today</b> if I die, <b>and</b> Rava’s statement is in accordance with opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> which is the unattributed opinion of the mishna, is it <b>necessary</b> that this <i>halakha</i> <b>be said by Rava,</b> an <i>amora</i>? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> explicitly in the mishna that if he said: This is your bill of divorce <b>from today if I die,</b> then <b>it is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce? But rather, is it not</b> speaking about a case <b>where he did not say</b> the term: <b>From today,</b> when he gave the bill of divorce, <b>and</b> Rava’s statement is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei? Conclude from it</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>It is obvious to Rava</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei even when the husband added a verbal condition. <b>But</b> according <b>to Rav Huna,</b> it <b>is uncertain</b> whether or not this is the <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 8
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> Rava’s statement is referring to a case <b>where he said to her:</b> This is your bill of divorce <b>from today, and</b> it is in accordance with opinion of <b>the Rabbis. And it was necessary for</b> Rava to state his ruling to teach the <i>halakha</i> of <b>these expressions</b> not stated in the mishna: First, the husband saying: <b>When I am dead,</b> is <b>considered</b> to be <b>like</b> the expression: <b>If I die.</b> Second, the husband saying: <b>When I die,</b> is <b>considered</b> to be <b>like</b> the expression: <b>After</b> my <b>death.</b>

### Part 9
§ <b>And there are those who teach</b> this statement of Rav Huna <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which states that if the husband said: <b>This is your bill of divorce after</b> my <b>death,</b> then the bill of divorce is invalid and it is as though <b>he said nothing. Rav Huna says: But</b> according <b>to the statement of Rabbi Yosei she must</b> nevertheless <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> as it is uncertain if the bill of divorce takes effect from the day the bill of divorce was given when the date is supplied verbally.

### Part 10
The Gemara questions this version of Rav Huna’s statement: This <b>is obvious. Since</b> it was taught <b>in the latter clause</b> of the mishna, in a case where he explicitly stated: From today, that <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis she must perform <i>ḥalitza</i></b> due to the uncertainty as to when the bill of divorce takes effect, in <b>the first clause as well,</b> when he did not add: From today, it is obvious that <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei she must perform <i>ḥalitza</i></b> due to the uncertainty. The dispute between Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis concerns only whether the husband needs to add the term: From today.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: His statement necessary, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>with regard to this, Rabbi Yosei holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who says: It is a proper bill of divorce, and she is not even required to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b> Therefore, Rav Huna <b>teaches us that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>does not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yosei does not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. Each has a unique, albeit similar, opinion.

### Part 12
The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>does not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as it teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the husband said: This is your bill of divorce from today and after my death, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: A case <b>like this</b> is a valid <b>bill of divorce</b> and there is no need for the wife to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. By emphasizing the term: Like this, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi intends <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei,</b> who is uncertain with regard to the matter. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rabbi Yosei did not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it teaches</b> in a mishna: Rabbi Yosei says: A case <b>like this</b> is a valid <b>bill of divorce, to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.

### Part 13
The Gemara cites the <i>baraita</i> and mishna that demonstrate the difference of opinion between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Yosei. <b>What is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a husband says to his wife: This is your bill of divorce <b>from today and after</b> my <b>death,</b> then there is uncertainty whether <b>it is a bill of divorce or</b> whether <b>it is not a bill of divorce,</b> and the wife must perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. This is <b>the statement of the Rabbis. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi disagrees and <b>says:</b> A case <b>like this</b> is a valid <b>bill of divorce</b> without any uncertainty, and there is no need for the wife to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.

### Part 14
<b>What is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei? As we learned</b> in a mishna (76b): If one says: <b>Write and give a bill of divorce to my wife if I have not come from now until</b> the conclusion of <b>twelve months,</b> and the court <b>wrote</b> the bill of divorce <b>within twelve months and gave</b> it to the wife <b>after twelve months, it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce. Rabbi Yosei</b> disagrees and <b>says: A case like this</b> is a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b>

### Part 15
§ The mishna teaches: If one says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce from today if I die from this illness,</b> and he recovered, <b>and he arose and walked in the market</b> and became ill again and died, then it must be assessed whether he died from the first illness and it is therefore a valid bill of divorce. But if he did not die from this illness then it is not a valid bill of divorce.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to a person on his deathbed, the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>his bill of divorce</b> are the same <b>as</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>his gift.</b> The Sages instituted that when a person on his deathbed gives a gift, no formal act of acquisition is required. <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>his gift, if he arose</b> and was cured from his illness the gift he granted while on his deathbed is <b>retracted,</b> as he gave it only based on the assumption that he was about to die, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>his bill of divorce, if he arose</b> and was cured from his illness, the bill of divorce is <b>retracted</b> and nullified, as he gave his wife her bill of divorce only because he thought he was about to die and he wanted to exempt her from a levirate bond.

### Part 17
Rav Huna continues: <b>And just as</b> in the case of <b>his bill of divorce,</b> where, <b>even though he did not explicitly say</b> his full intention, <b>once he said: Write</b> the bill of divorce, his statement is interpreted to mean that the court should give the bill of divorce to his wife <b>even though he did not say: Give</b> the bill of divorce to my wife, which a healthy man would need to state, <b>so too,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>his gift. Once he said: Give</b> the gift, then <b>even though</b> the recipients <b>did not acquire</b> it <b>from him,</b> which finalizes a gift from a healthy person, because he is dying the <i>halakha</i> takes into account his intention without all the necessary legal requirements.

### Part 18
The Gemara challenges: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If a man said: <b>This is your bill of divorce from today if I die from this illness,</b> and he recovered, <b>and he arose and walked in the market, but</b> then <b>became ill</b> again <b>and died,</b> the court <b>assesses him. If he died because of the first illness</b> then <b>this is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce,</b> but <b>if not</b> then it is <b>not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce. And if you say</b> that <b>if he arose</b> and was cured of his illness the bill of divorce is <b>retracted,</b> then <b>why do I</b> need <b>assessment</b> at all? <b>He arose</b> from his sickbed, so the bill of divorce should automatically be nullified.

### Part 19
<b>Mar, son of Rav Yosef, says in the name of Rava:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where,</b> instead of recovering completely, <b>he proceeded from</b> one <b>illness</b> immediately <b>to</b> another <b>illness,</b> and the assessment is to ascertain whether he died from the first illness or from the second one.

### Part 20
The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the mishna: <b>He arose</b> from his illness, which indicates that he was completely cured? The Gemara answers: No, it means that he <b>arose from this illness but fell into another illness.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it</b> also <b>taught</b> in the mishna: <b>He walked in the market?</b> The Gemara answers: This means that <b>he walked with his staff</b> for support, meaning that he was not fully recovered from his illness but was able to walk only with assistance.
