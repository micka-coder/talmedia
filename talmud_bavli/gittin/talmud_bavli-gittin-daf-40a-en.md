### Part 1
<b>he is emancipated. Rabbi Yoḥanan said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: <b>You possess such</b> an extreme <i>halakha</i>, <b>but I teach</b> this <i>halakha</i>: With regard to <b>one who writes a document of betrothal for his maidservant,</b> stating: You are hereby betrothed to me, <b>Rabbi Meir says: She is betrothed, and the Rabbis say: She is not betrothed,</b> as even this, when he betroths her directly, does not serve as proof that he emancipates her.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: Just <b>as that</b> which <b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila says</b> in a different context, that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is referring to a case <b>where</b> a slave’s <b>master placed phylacteries on him, here too,</b> the context of Rabbi Zeira’s statement is not that of a slave who married a woman in his master’s presence but a case <b>where</b> the slave’s <b>master</b> himself <b>provided a wife for him,</b> as this is certainly proof that he had emancipated him.

### Part 3
The Gemara questions this answer: <b>Is there anything</b> like this, <b>where for his slave he would not violate a prohibition,</b> and by providing a wife for his slave he indicates that he must have emancipated the slave, <b>but he</b> himself might <b>violate the prohibition,</b> as he is suspected of marrying his maidservant without having freed her?

### Part 4
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: With what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where he said to</b> the maidservant when he gave her the document of betrothal: <b>Become emancipated with this and become betrothed</b> to me <b>with this. Rabbi Meir holds that this formulation</b> written in the document of betrothal: You are hereby betrothed to me, <b>contains a formulation of emancipation</b> and therefore serves both as a bill of manumission and a document of betrothal. <b>And the Rabbis hold: This formulation is not a formulation of emancipation.</b> That is why the Rabbis hold she is not betrothed in this case. However, according to everyone, a master is not suspected of marrying his maidservant without first freeing her.

### Part 5
With regard to this issue, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: A slave who dons phylacteries in the presence of his master is emancipated,</b> as this is unusual behavior for a slave because slaves are not obligated in this mitzva. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If a slave’s <b>master borrowed</b> money <b>from him; or if his master appointed him as a steward</b> over his possessions; <b>or if</b> the slave <b>donned phylacteries in the presence of his master; or if he read three verses</b> of the Torah reading <b>in the synagogue in the presence of his master,</b> although all of these activities are ordinarily performed only by freemen, <b>this</b> slave <b>is not emancipated.</b> This seems to contradict the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi.

### Part 6
<b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila says:</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi was referring to a case <b>where</b> the slave’s <b>master placed phylacteries on him.</b> In that case it is clear that the slave is donning phylacteries with the consent of his master, and a master would not place phylacteries on his slave unless he had already emancipated him.

### Part 7
§ <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he reported that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In a case of <b>one who says at the moment of his death:</b> With regard to <b>so-and-so, my maidservant,</b> my heirs <b>should not treat her as a slave after my death,</b> the court <b>compels the heirs and they write for her a bill of manumission. Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi said before him: My teacher, don’t you admit that her children are slaves?</b> The master meant only that his heirs should not subjugate her excessively. He did not intend to free her, and her children remain slaves. Why, then, are the heirs compelled to free the maidservant?

### Part 8
<b>When Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he reported a different version of what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In a case of <b>one who says at the moment of his death: So-and-so, my maidservant, gave me satisfaction</b> and <b>one should do for her</b> something that gives her <b>satisfaction,</b> the court <b>compels the heirs to give her satisfaction,</b> and if she will be satisfied only by being emancipated, they must do so. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>It is a mitzva to fulfill the statement of the dead.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Ameimar says:</b> With regard to <b>one who renounces ownership of his slave,</b> there is <b>no</b> halakhic <b>remedy for that slave,</b> and he cannot marry a Jewish woman. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The slave <b>himself does not belong to</b> his master. However, <b>there is the prohibition</b> against marrying a Jewish woman that remains <b>in</b> the master’s possession, <b>and</b> the master <b>cannot transfer ownership of the prohibition to</b> the slave, as this is not something that can be transferred. A bill of manumission is not effective in this case because the slave already does not belong to him.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: But didn’t Ulla say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and</b> similarly <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin</b> says that <b>Rav says: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case of one who betroths his slave, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case of one who renounces ownership of his slave, the slave <b>is emancipated but</b> nevertheless <b>requires a bill of manumission?</b> This demonstrates that when one renounces ownership of his slave, the slave is no longer in his possession but can still become a freeman upon receiving a bill of manumission. Ameimar <b>said to him:</b> They meant that <b>he requires</b> a bill of manumission to be considered a freeman and to marry a Jewish woman, <b>but</b> there is <b>no remedy for him,</b> as the master cannot issue one.

### Part 11
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of this exchange: <b>Ameimar says:</b> With regard to <b>one who renounces ownership of his slave and dies,</b> there is <b>no</b> halakhic <b>remedy for that slave</b> and he cannot marry a Jewish woman. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The slave <b>himself does not belong to</b> his master; however, <b>there is the prohibition</b> against marrying a Jewish woman that remains <b>in</b> the master’s possession, <b>and</b> the master <b>cannot bequeath the prohibition to his son. Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: But when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he reported that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that if one says that his heirs should not treat his maidservant as a slave, the heirs are compelled to write a bill of manumission. This demonstrates that the heirs can write a bill of manumission although they do not own the maidservant.

### Part 12
Ameimar answered: The report <b>of Rav Dimi</b> quoting Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>is erroneous,</b> and Rabbi Yoḥanan never stated that <i>halakha</i>. <b>He said to him: What</b> is <b>erroneous</b> about Rav Dimi’s statement? The reason it is erroneous is <b>that</b> the master <b>did not state this using a formulation of emancipation, but</b> if <b>he</b> had <b>stated this using a formulation of emancipation,</b> then <b>indeed</b> they would be able to write for her a bill of manumission? Why then do you not concede to his opinion? <b>He said to him: I hold in accordance with</b> the report <b>of Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda,</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan was discussing a case where the master said that his heirs should give the maidservant satisfaction. Therefore, the master never stated that the heirs would not have ownership over the maidservant, only that they should fulfill his dying instruction to grant her satisfaction.

### Part 13
The Gemara relates: There was an incident involving <b>a certain city</b> [<b><i>diskarta</i></b>] <b>of slaves that was sold to gentiles.</b> When <b>their final</b> gentile <b>masters died,</b> the slaves <b>came before Ravina</b> and said that since they had no masters, they wanted to be considered full-fledged Jews. <b>He said to them: Go and return to the children of your first masters and</b> have them <b>write for you bills of manumission</b> so that you will be considered freemen in every respect. <b>The Rabbis said to Ravina: But didn’t Ameimar say</b> that with regard to <b>one who renounces ownership of his slave and dies,</b> there is <b>no remedy for that slave?</b> Similarly, if one sells his slave to a gentile, he no longer has the right to the slave’s labor and can no longer write a bill of manumission for him.

### Part 14
Ravina <b>said to them: I hold in accordance with</b> the report of <b>Rav Dimi,</b> who said that Rabbi Yoḥanan says that the heirs can give a bill of manumission. <b>They,</b> the Rabbis, <b>said to him:</b> That <b>which Rav Dimi</b> said <b>is erroneous. He said to them: What</b> is <b>erroneous</b> about Rav Dimi’s statement? The reason it is erroneous is <b>that he did not state this using a formulation of emancipation, but</b> if <b>he</b> had <b>stated this using a formulation of emancipation,</b> then <b>indeed</b> they would be able to write a bill of manumission. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ravina,</b> that the original masters can write a bill of manumission for the slaves.

### Part 15
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain slave who</b> belonged <b>to two</b> partners. <b>One of them arose and emancipated his half</b> of the slave. <b>The other</b> master <b>said: Now the rabbis</b> of the local court <b>will hear</b> that my slave is half emancipated <b>and they will cause me to lose him,</b> i.e., they will force me to release him, as is stated in the mishna (41b) that the court forces a master to release his slave who has been half emancipated. <b>He went</b> and <b>transferred ownership</b> of the slave <b>to his minor son,</b> who could not be forced by the court to emancipate him, so that the slave would remain in his possession.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Yosef, son of Rava, sent before Rav Pappa</b> the question of what the <i>halakha</i> is in this circumstance. <b>He sent to him</b> a response that paraphrased biblical verses: <b>As he has done, so shall it be done to him, his dealing shall return upon his own head</b> (see Leviticus 24:19 and Obadiah 1:15). In other words, since the master acted deceitfully to circumvent the ruling of the Sages, one should deal with him deceitfully. <b>We know that a child is attracted to money. We</b> will <b>appoint a steward for</b> the child, who will clarify the slave’s market value,
