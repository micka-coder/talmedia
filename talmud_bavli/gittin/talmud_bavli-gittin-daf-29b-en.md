<b>Take an item from her and then give her the bill of divorce, and he went and gave her the bill of divorce and then took the item from her. Rabbi Yoḥanan invalidates</b> the bill of divorce even when given <b>by</b> the first agent, as he deviated from the husband’s instructions, and his agency is canceled, <b>and all the more so</b> does Rabbi Yoḥanan invalidate the bill of divorce when delivered <b>by</b> the first agent’s <b>agent. And Reish Lakish deems</b> the bill of divorce <b>valid</b> when it is delivered <b>by</b> the first agent’s <b>agent, and all the more so</b> when it is delivered <b>by</b> the first agent <b>himself.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to an agent <b>who is bringing a bill of divorce from a country overseas,</b> who must attest to the fact that he witnessed the writing and signing of the bill of divorce, <b>and he became sick</b> and cannot complete his agency, <b>he appoints another agent in court and sends him. And</b> the first agent <b>says before</b> the court: <b>It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence,</b> and on the basis of this the court deems the bill of divorce to be valid. <b>And the final agent does not need to say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence. Rather,</b> it is sufficient that <b>he says: I am an agent of the court.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages said to Avimei, son of Rabbi Abbahu: Raise</b> the following <b>dilemma before</b> your father, <b>Rabbi Abbahu: Can an agent of</b> the first <b>agent</b> also <b>appoint</b> another <b>agent, or not? He said to them: You should not raise this dilemma. From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches: The final agent does not</b> need to say, as opposed to: The second agent does not need to say, it can be seen <b>by inference that</b> the second agent <b>can appoint an agent,</b> resulting in the existence of a final agent, not just a second agent.

### Part 4
<b>Rather, when you raise the dilemma,</b> this is what you should ask: <b>When</b> the second agent <b>appoints</b> another <b>agent,</b> does he need to appoint him specifically <b>in court, or</b> can he do so <b>even while not in court? They said to him: We do not raise this dilemma,</b> as <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it teaches: Rather, he says: I am an agent of the court,</b> it is clear that any agent in this role must be appointed in court.

### Part 5
The Gemara cites another version of the discussion. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> would <b>teach like this: The Sages said to Avimei, son of Rabbi Abbahu: Raise</b> the following <b>dilemma before</b> your father, <b>Rabbi Abbahu:</b> When the <b>agent of</b> the first <b>agent appoints</b> another <b>agent,</b> does he need to appoint him specifically <b>in court, or</b> can he do so <b>even while not in court?</b>

### Part 6
<b>He said to them: And you should raise the dilemma</b> as to <b>whether generally</b> the agent of the first agent <b>can appoint</b> another <b>agent. They said to him: We do not raise this dilemma, as we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>The final agent does not</b> need to say, and <b>by inference</b> it can be seen <b>that</b> the second agent <b>can appoint an agent. Rather, when the dilemma was raised to us,</b> it was with respect to whether this must take place <b>in court, or</b> if it can take place <b>while not in court. He said to them: You should also not raise this dilemma, as</b> the mishna <b>teaches: Rather, he says: I am an agent of the court,</b> which shows that the subsequent appointments must take place in court.

### Part 7
§ <b>Rabba says: An agent in Eretz Yisrael can appoint several agents,</b> i.e., he can appoint an agent, and the second agent can appoint another agent in his place. All of this can take place outside of court, because when a bill of divorce is sent within Eretz Yisrael there is no need to testify that it was written and signed in the agent’s presence. <b>Rav Ashi says: If</b> the <b>first</b> agent <b>died,</b> then <b>they are all canceled,</b> as all the agents act on the basis of the first agent. With his death, the agency is canceled.

### Part 8
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said: This</b> statement <b>of</b> my <b>father is</b> from the time <b>of his youth,</b> and it is not correct, as, <b>if</b> the <b>husband dies,</b> even if all of the agents are alive, <b>is there is any significance to</b> any of <b>them? All of them, from whose authority do they come</b> to deliver the bill of divorce? <b>They come from the husband’s authority.</b> Therefore, if the <b>husband is</b> alive, then <b>they are all</b> able to act as agents; if the <b>husband is not</b> alive, then <b>they are all not</b> agents. The status of the agents is dependent on the husband, not on the first agent.

### Part 9
§ The Gemara relates: There was an incident involving <b>a certain man who sent a bill of divorce to his wife</b> with an agent. <b>The agent said: I do not know her.</b> The husband <b>said to him: Go give</b> the bill of divorce <b>to Abba bar Minyumi, as he knows her, and he will go and give it to her.</b> The agent <b>came and did not find Abba bar Minyumi,</b> and he did not know what to do. <b>He found Rabbi Abbahu and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa, and Rav Safra was sitting among them.</b> The agent asked them what he should do. The first three Sages <b>said to him: Transfer your words,</b> i.e., your agency, <b>before us, as when Abba bar Minyumi comes, we will give</b> the bill of divorce <b>to him, and he will go and give it to her.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rav Safra said to them: But isn’t he an agent who is not granted</b> the ability <b>to</b> effect <b>divorce,</b> as he was given only the authority to transfer the bill of divorce to Abba bar Minyumi? Therefore, he cannot transfer the agency to another person. These Sages <b>were embarrassed</b> that they ruled improperly.

### Part 11
<b>Rava said: Rav Safra struck [<i>kappeḥinhu</i>]</b> a blow <b>to three ordained Sages,</b> as although he was from Babylonia and not ordained, he was correct. <b>Rav Ashi said: With what did he strike them?</b> He did not conclusively refute their opinion, as, <b>did</b> the husband <b>say to the</b> agent: <b>Abba bar Minyumi</b> should deliver the bill of divorce <b>and not you?</b> Rather, he appointed this agent to deliver the bill of divorce, and added that if he cannot find the wife, then he can transfer the bill of divorce to Abba bar Minyumi.

### Part 12
The Gemara cites another version of the discussion: <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rava said: Rav Safra struck three ordained Sages mistakenly. Rav Ashi</b> questioned Rava and <b>said: What</b> was <b>the mistake?</b> After all, <b>what did</b> the husband <b>say to</b> the agent? He said that <b>Abba bar Minyumi</b> should give his wife the bill of divorce, meaning that he <b>and not you</b> should give it, and Rav Safra’s ruling was correct.

### Part 13
The Gemara relates a similar incident: There was an incident involving <b>a certain man who sent a bill of divorce to his wife</b> with an agent. <b>He said to the agent: Do not give</b> the bill of divorce <b>to her until thirty days</b> have passed. <b>Circumstances</b> occurred <b>within</b> the <b>thirty days that were beyond</b> the agent’s <b>control,</b> and he saw that he would not be able to wait and give the wife the bill of divorce after thirty days, as per the husband’s instructions.

### Part 14
The agent <b>came before Rava</b> and asked what he should do. <b>Rava said: What is the reason</b> that the mishna permits an agent who <b>became sick</b> to appoint another agent in his place? It is <b>because he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control,</b> and in the case of <b>this</b> one <b>as well, he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control.</b> Rava <b>said to</b> the agent: <b>Transfer your words,</b> i.e., your agency, <b>before us</b> and we will serve as a court, so <b>that after thirty days we will appoint an agent and he will give</b> the bill of divorce <b>to her. The Sages said to Rava: But isn’t he an agent who is not granted</b> the ability <b>to</b> effect <b>divorce,</b> as within the thirty days he does not have the authority to divorce her? <b>He said to them: Since</b> it is so <b>that after thirty days he is able to divorce</b> her, <b>he is considered an agent who is granted</b> the ability <b>to</b> effect <b>divorce.</b>

### Part 15
The Sages challenged Rava again: <b>But</b> in any case where an agent does not deliver a bill of divorce immediately, <b>let there be a concern</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the husband <b>was mollified</b> and decided not to divorce his wife, thereby canceling the bill of divorce. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (76b): If, before traveling, a husband gives his wife a bill of divorce and says that it takes effect <b>from now if I do not arrive from now until twelve months</b> have passed, <b>and he died within</b> the <b>twelve months,</b> then <b>this is a</b> valid <b>bill of divorce?</b>

### Part 16
<b>And we discussed</b> this <i>halakha</i>: <b>And let there be a concern</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the husband <b>was mollified</b> and decided not to divorce his wife, and canceled the bill of divorce. <b>And Rabba bar Rav Huna said: This</b> is what <b>my father, my master,</b> Rav Huna, <b>said in the name of Rav:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>says:</b> My wife <b>is deemed credible to say that I did not arrive.</b> Since the husband abrogated his right to contest the validity of the divorce by granting absolute credibility to his wife, there is no concern that he may have canceled the bill of divorce, as even if he were to claim that he had done so, his claim would not be accepted. By contrast, in this incident, where the wife was never granted such credibility, there is a concern that perhaps he canceled the bill of divorce.

### Part 17
Rava <b>was embarrassed</b> that he ruled incorrectly. <b>Ultimately, the matter was revealed that</b> this woman <b>was</b> the husband’s <b>betrothed</b> and that they had not married. <b>Rava said: If they said</b> that there is a concern <b>with regard to a married woman</b> that perhaps he was mollified, <b>would they say</b> the same <b>with regard to a betrothed woman,</b> whom he does not know well? Therefore, my ruling was correct.

### Part 18
<b>Rava said: We certainly raise this dilemma:</b>
