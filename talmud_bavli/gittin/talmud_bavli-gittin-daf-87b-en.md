### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> Reuven signed both bills of divorce, and <b>he signed</b> the second one <b>with his father’s name?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>One does not leave</b> out <b>his</b> own <b>name and</b> instead <b>sign in the name of his father.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps he made</b> his father’s name <b>a symbol</b> for his own signature? <b>As Rav would draw a fish</b> instead of signing his name, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> would draw <b>a date palm, Rav Ḥisda</b> would write <b>a <i>samekh</i>, Rav Hoshaya</b> would write <b>an <i>ayin</i>,</b> and <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna would draw a sail.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>A person would not be so brazen as to make his father’s name a symbol.</b> Therefore, it is assumed that the word Ya’akov is a continuation of Reuven’s signature on the first bill of divorce, not a separate signature on the second bill of divorce.

### Part 4
The Gemara raises a different question: <b>But let this</b> bill of divorce <b>be validated by</b> the <b>two Hebrew witnesses, and let that</b> bill of divorce <b>be validated by</b> the <b>two Greek witnesses, as we learned</b> in the subsequent mishna that <b>a bill of divorce that was written in Hebrew and its witnesses</b> signed <b>in Greek,</b> or that was written <b>in Greek and its witnesses</b> signed <b>in Hebrew, is valid.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And if you would say that since</b> the signatures of the witnesses of the second bill of divorce <b>are two lines away</b> from the bill of divorce itself, it is <b>not</b> valid, as that is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a document that has a gap between the text and the signatures, <b>but didn’t Ḥizkiyya say</b> that if the gap was <b>filled,</b> even <b>with</b> the signatures of <b>relatives</b> who are disqualified from serving as witnesses, it is <b>valid?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: <b>Ze’eiri</b> in fact <b>teaches</b> that <b>both of</b> the two bills of divorce <b>are valid,</b> not only the one beneath which the names of the first two witnesses appear. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, who does not agree with this ruling? The Gemara answers: He is concerned that <b>perhaps</b> the bottom two witnesses <b>signed in reverse [<i>gundalit</i>].</b> For example, if the top two signatures are in Hebrew, perhaps the witnesses who signed in Greek reversed the word order of their signatures, imitating the Hebrew style, <b>and</b> in actuality <b>all of the</b> witnesses <b>signed one</b> bill of divorce.

### Part 7
§ It is stated in the mishna that if <b>one witness</b> signed in <b>Hebrew and</b> then <b>one witness</b> signed in <b>Greek,</b> and then one more witness signed in Hebrew and one in Greek, both bills of divorce are invalid. The Gemara asks: <b>But let this</b> bill of divorce <b>be validated by one Hebrew witness and one Greek witness, and that</b> bill of divorce be validated <b>by</b> the other pair composed of <b>one Hebrew witness and one Greek witness. Didn’t we learn</b> in the subsequent mishna that a bill of divorce that was signed by <b>one witness</b> in <b>Hebrew and one witness</b> in <b>Greek is valid?</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>Ze’eiri</b> in fact <b>teaches</b> that <b>both of them are valid.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna? The Gemara answers: He is concerned that <b>perhaps they signed in reverse,</b> i.e., perhaps one of the witnesses who signed in Greek reversed the word order of his signature, <b>and</b> in actuality he signed the other bill of divorce. Consequently, <b>three</b> witnesses signed <b>one</b> bill of divorce <b>and</b> only <b>one</b> witness signed the other <b>one.</b> Therefore, they are both rendered invalid.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a scribe <b>left out part of the bill of divorce and wrote it in the second column,</b> i.e., the bill of divorce is written in two columns on one paper, <b>and the</b> signatures of the <b>witnesses are beneath</b> the second column, it is a <b>valid</b> bill of divorce. If the <b>witnesses signed at the top of the column, on the side, or on the back of an ordinary,</b> non-folded <b>bill of divorce,</b> it is <b>invalid.</b>

### Part 10
If the scribe <b>placed the top of this</b> bill of divorce <b>next to the top of that</b> bill of divorce so that both are written in the same column but with the text in opposite directions, <b>and the witnesses</b> signed <b>in the middle,</b> between the bills of divorce, <b>both</b> bills of divorce <b>are invalid.</b> If he placed <b>the end of this</b> bill of divorce <b>next to the end of that</b> bill of divorce, <b>and the witnesses</b> signed <b>in the middle</b> between them, the bill of divorce <b>with which the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>are read,</b> i.e., the bill that is written in the same direction as the signatures, <b>is valid.</b> If he placed <b>the top of this</b> bill of divorce <b>next to the end of that</b> bill of divorce, <b>and the witnesses</b> signed <b>in the middle,</b> the bill of divorce <b>at the end of which the witnesses are read,</b> i.e., the upper bill of divorce, <b>is valid.</b>

### Part 11
With regard to <b>a bill of divorce that was written in Hebrew and its witnesses</b> signed <b>in Greek,</b> or that was written <b>in Greek and its witnesses</b> signed <b>in Hebrew,</b> or in which <b>one witness</b> signed <b>in Hebrew and one witness</b> signed <b>in Greek,</b> or if a bill of divorce has <b>the writing of a scribe,</b> and the scribe identifies his handwriting, <b>and</b> one <b>witness</b> verifies his signature, it is <b>valid</b> as though two witnesses testified to ratify their signatures.

### Part 12
As for the wording of the signature, if a witness signed: <b>So-and-so, witness,</b> without mentioning his father’s name, it is <b>valid.</b> Similarly, if he did not write his name and instead wrote: <b>Son of so-and-so, witness,</b> it is <b>valid.</b> If he wrote: <b>So-and-so, son of so-and-so, but did not write</b> the word <b>witness,</b> it is <b>valid. And this is what the scrupulous people of Jerusalem would do,</b> i.e., they would sign without the word witness. As for the names of the husband and wife, if the scribe <b>wrote his surname [<i>ḥanikhato</i>]</b> or nickname <b>and her surname</b> or nickname, it is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to a bill of divorce that is written in two columns, <b>let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps these were two</b> adjacent <b>bills of divorce,</b> the second one higher up on the page than the first, <b>and the date</b> written at the top <b>of the first</b> bill of divorce <b>and the</b> signatures of the <b>witnesses</b> written at the bottom <b>of the latter</b> bill of divorce <b>happened</b> to be written next to each other, <b>and</b> someone <b>cut out the date of the latter</b> bill of divorce <b>and</b> the signatures of <b>the witnesses of the first</b> so that it appears to be a single bill of divorce written in two columns.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Abba says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> It is a case <b>where there is space</b> on the paper <b>below</b> the first bill of divorce, so it is clear that nothing was cut out. The Gemara asks: <b>And perhaps he cut out the date of the latter</b> bill of divorce, making it look like a continuation of the first one, which was actually never finished? The Gemara answers: <b>Just as Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that it is a case <b>where there is space below</b> the first bill of divorce,
