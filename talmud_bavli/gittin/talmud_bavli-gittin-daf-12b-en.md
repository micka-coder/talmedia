### Part 1
<b>does he</b> find it necessary to <b>borrow and eat?</b> After all, his master provides for him. The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to surplus</b> food, i.e., additional food that the slave wants to eat.

### Part 2
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> the <b>Temple</b> treasurer <b>say to him: Until now it was enough for you without a surplus; now too it should be enough for you without a surplus.</b> Why do you seek more now? Consequently, the consecration should apply to this surplus as well. The Gemara answers: <b>It is preferable to</b> the <b>Temple</b> treasury <b>itself</b> that he work and eat more, <b>so that</b> the value of <b>its slave will be enhanced</b> when he consumes this extra amount, as he will become stronger.

### Part 3
§ It was stated that the slave borrows and eats and afterward <b>performs</b> work <b>and repays</b> the loan. The Gemara asks: But his work <b>immediately becomes consecrated,</b> as his hands have been consecrated. How, then, can he repay this loan? The Gemara answers: The slave performs work <b>of less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>.</b> Anything worth less than one <i>peruta</i> does not become consecrated. Therefore he can collect these small sums and repay his debt little by little.

### Part 4
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that Rav is referring to a case where the master provides sustenance for him. <b>As Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>one who consecrates the hands of his slave, that slave works and eats, as, if</b> the slave does <b>not work</b> for himself, <b>who will work</b> and provide <b>for him?</b> This ruling indicates that Rav maintains that consecration does not apply to the slave’s hands.

### Part 5
The Gemara explains: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>this</b> earlier <i>halakha</i> that Rav said, that the slave borrows and repays, refers to a situation <b>where</b> his master <b>provides sustenance for him, and</b> this is because in general <b>he cannot</b> say to him: Work for me but I will not sustain you, <b>and this</b> second <i>halakha</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> his master <b>does not provide</b> him with sustenance, and therefore he cannot consecrate the slave’s hands, it <b>is well,</b> as there is no contradiction between the two statements of Rav.

### Part 6
<b>However, if you say</b> that <b>this</b> first <i>halakha</i> is <b>also</b> speaking of a case <b>where</b> his master <b>does not provide</b> sustenance for him, and the consecration is effective because he <b>can</b> say to his slave: Work for me but I will not sustain you, then what is the meaning of the statement: <b>As, if</b> the slave does <b>not work</b> for himself <b>who will work for him?</b> Let <b>whoever desires work for him,</b> i.e., the slave will be compelled to sustain himself from charity, but this is not the master’s concern.

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> here that Rav holds that a master <b>cannot</b> say to his slave: Work for me but I will not sustain you? The Gemara comments: Indeed <b>conclude from</b> here that this is the case.

### Part 8
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another source concerning the same dilemma, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One who severs the hand of another’s slave</b> must <b>give</b> compensation for <b>his</b> loss of <b>livelihood,</b> i.e., compensation for the slave’s inability to work as a result of his injury, <b>and</b> the slave’s <b>medical costs to his master. And that slave,</b> who can no longer work, is <b>sustained from charity. Conclude from</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that <b>the master is able to say to his slave: Work for me but I will not sustain you,</b> as otherwise the master would not receive compensation for his time in the form of payment for the slave’s earnings while the slave lives off of charity.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> his master <b>provides sustenance for him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why is he sustained from charity?</b> He already has sustenance. The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to surplus</b> food, i.e., additional food that the slave wants to eat.

### Part 10
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> the phrase: <b>Sustained</b> from charity, is imprecise, as it indicates that he is provided only with enough for his basic needs. <b>It should have</b> said: He <b>earns a living</b> from charity. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> his statement that Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that the master <b>can</b> to say to his slave: Work for me but I will not sustain you? The Gemara comments: Indeed <b>conclude from</b> his statement that this is the case.

### Part 11
The Gemara discusses the aforementioned <i>halakha</i>. <b>The Master says</b> earlier: <b>He</b> must <b>give</b> compensation for the slave’s loss of <b>livelihood and his medical costs to his master.</b> The Gemara comments: With regard to compensation for loss of <b>livelihood, it is obvious</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i>, as the master incurs the loss when his slave does not work, and therefore <b>it was necessary for</b> the Sages to mention only that the compensation for <b>his medical costs</b> goes to his master.

### Part 12
The Gemara comments: Why is the payment for his medical costs given to his master? Shouldn’t the compensation for <b>his medical costs belong to him, as he needs to be healed with it?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> doctors <b>estimated</b> that the blow or wound <b>would heal in five days and they made a strong medicine for him, and he was healed in three days</b> instead of five. <b>Lest you say:</b> Since <b>the pain</b> suffered by the slave by taking the strong medicine that caused a decrease in the costs of healing was his, the money should belong <b>to him,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case, as even this money belongs to the master, not the slave.

### Part 13
§ With regard to the discussion in the mishna between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:5) that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: We said to Meir: But isn’t it in the interest of a slave to leave his master to freedom? He said to us: It is to his detriment, as if he were the slave of a priest,</b> then by emancipating him the master thereby <b>disqualifies him from</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>. We said to him: But what</b> would be <b>if</b> the master <b>wishes not to sustain him and not to provide him with a living?</b> He is <b>permitted</b> to do so. Therefore, the slave does not lose out when he is emancipated, as he was not guaranteed sustenance in any event.

### Part 14
Rabbi Meir <b>said to us:</b> Even if the master is not obligated to provide for him, it is still permitted for the slave to partake of <i>teruma</i>. The proof for this is the following case: <b>And what</b> would be <b>if</b> there were <b>the slave of a priest, who fled</b> from his master, <b>or</b> in the case of <b>the wife of a priest, who rebelled against her husband,</b> i.e., she refused to fulfill her obligations as a married woman? Are <b>they not</b> permitted to <b>partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> although not the <i>teruma</i> belonging to the master or husband? They are permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>But this</b> slave who was emancipated <b>may not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> at all, even <i>teruma</i> that belongs to other priests. <b>But</b> in any event, in the case of <b>a woman,</b> a bill of divorce <b>is to her detriment, as it disqualifies her from</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i> and causes her to lose</b> her <b>sustenance.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What did</b> the Rabbis <b>say to</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>and what</b> did he <b>respond to them?</b> In other words, the two sides do not appear to be discussing the same issue, as the Rabbis refer to sustenance while Rabbi Meir talks about <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara explains that <b>this is what</b> Rabbi Meir <b>is saying</b> to them: <b>You have answered me about sustenance,</b> that the master is not required to provide for his slave. However, <b>what will you answer me about <i>teruma</i>?</b>

### Part 16
<b>And if you were to say</b> that the acceptance of the document by the agent is not to the slave’s detriment, as in any event <b>if</b> the master <b>desires, he can throw the bill</b> of manumission within four cubits of the slave <b>and</b> thereby <b>disqualify him</b> from partaking of <i>teruma</i>; the slave can prevent this from occurring by <b>leaving</b> his master, <b>and escaping and going out to the world.</b> If he acts in this manner his master will be unable to emancipate him, and he can continue partaking of <i>teruma</i>.
