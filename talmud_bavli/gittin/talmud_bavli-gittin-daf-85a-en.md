### Part 1
<b>everyone agrees</b> that it <b>is valid. And the mishna, which teaches</b> that if <b>he wrote</b> his qualification in the bill of divorce it is invalid, <b>and we established</b> that it is referring only <b>to</b> a case of <b>an exception, but a condition does not render</b> the bill of divorce <b>invalid,</b> does not contradict this <i>baraita</i>. As <b>if you wish, say</b> that the mishna is referring to a case where the qualification is written <b>before the essential</b> part of the bill of divorce, <b>and</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. And if you wish, say</b> that it is referring to a case where the qualification is written <b>after the essential</b> part, <b>and everyone,</b> even Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>agrees</b> with regard to its ruling.

### Part 2
<b>And Rava said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis <b>is</b> with regard to a case where the condition is written <b>after the essential</b> part, <b>as Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that <b>we issue a decree</b> rendering the bill of divorce invalid <b>due to</b> a case where the condition is written <b>before the essential</b> part, <b>and the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>we do not issue a decree due to</b> a case where it is written <b>before the essential</b> part. <b>But</b> if it is written <b>before the essential</b> part, <b>everyone agrees</b> that it <b>is invalid.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And</b> accordingly, <b>the mishna, which teaches</b> that if <b>he wrote</b> his qualification in the bill of divorce it is invalid, <b>and we established</b> that it is referring only <b>to</b> a case of <b>an exception, but a condition does not render</b> the bill of divorce <b>invalid,</b> does not contradict this <i>baraita</i>. It is referring to a case where he wrote the condition <b>after the essential</b> part, <b>and it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that a condition written after the essential part does not render the bill of divorce invalid.

### Part 4
<b>The father of Rabbi Avin taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Zeira:</b> If one <b>wrote a conditional bill of divorce, everyone agrees</b> that it <b>is invalid.</b> Rabbi Zeira asked him: <b>Everyone agrees</b> that it <b>is invalid? But don’t they disagree</b> about this?

### Part 5
Rabbi Zeira therefore modified the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with his opinion: <b>Rather, say</b> that <b>everyone agrees</b> that it <b>is valid. And what are the circumstances</b> in which both sides agree that it is valid? It is referring to a case where the condition is written <b>after the essential</b> part of the bill of divorce.

### Part 6
The Gemara counters: <b>Let</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>say</b> an alternative modification of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is invalid,</b> omitting the words: Everyone agrees, <b>and</b> this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara answers: <b>The <i>tanna</i> taught him</b> that <b>everyone agrees,</b> which is a conspicuous statement. Although <b>he may</b> conceivably <b>confuse</b> the word <b>valid with invalid, he</b> certainly <b>does not confuse</b> the phrase: <b>It is, with</b> the phrase: <b>Everyone agrees.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Zeira modified the <i>baraita</i> the way he did.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a man says to his wife while handing her a bill of divorce: <b>You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man, except to</b> marry <b>my father or to</b> marry <b>your father, to</b> marry <b>my brother or to</b> marry <b>your brother, to</b> marry <b>a slave or to</b> marry <b>a gentile, or to</b> marry <b>anyone</b> to whom <b>she cannot</b> legally become <b>betrothed,</b> the divorce <b>is valid.</b> Since these men cannot betroth her anyway, his qualification is meaningless.

### Part 8
If he says to her: <b>You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man, except</b> for when doing so violates the following: The prohibition against <b>a widow</b> being married <b>to a High Priest;</b> the prohibition against <b>a divorcée or a <i>yevama</i> who performed <i>ḥalitza</i> [<i>ḥalutza</i>]</b> being married <b>to a common priest; a <i>mamzeret</i> or a Gibeonite woman</b> being married <b>to an Israelite</b> man; <b>an Israelite woman</b> being married <b>to a <i>mamzer</i> or to a Gibeonite</b> man; <b>or</b> marrying <b>anyone</b> to whom <b>she can</b> legally become <b>betrothed, even</b> if this betrothal would be <b>a transgression,</b> such as in the aforementioned cases; in all of these cases the divorce <b>is invalid.</b> His statement renders it a partial divorce, as the woman is still not permitted to marry any man who is eligible to betroth her.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The stating of <b>the generalization in the first clause</b> of the mishna: Anyone to whom she cannot legally become betrothed, serves <b>to include the rest of those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> for engaging in sexual intercourse with her, who are not listed explicitly in the mishna. The stating of <b>the generalization in the last clause</b> of the mishna: Anyone to whom she can legally become betrothed, serves <b>to include the rest of those liable by a prohibition</b> for engaging in sexual intercourse with her, <b>such as an Ammonite and a Moabite, a Gibeonite, an Egyptian, and an Edomite</b> (Deuteronomy 23:4, 8–9). Although they are all prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse with her due to a prohibition or a positive mitzva, she can legally become betrothed to them.

### Part 10
§ <b>Rava raised a dilemma before Rav Naḥman:</b> If the husband says that she is permitted to marry any man <b>except for a betrothal to</b> so-and-so, who is <b>a minor boy</b> at that time, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>now,</b> since <b>he is in any event not eligible for betrothal,</b> as a minor boy cannot betroth a woman, the husband’s qualification does not prohibit his wife to anyone, and it is a complete act of severance? <b>Or perhaps,</b> since <b>he will reach</b> eligibility for <b>betrothal,</b> is the husband’s qualification considered as prohibiting her to someone to whom betrothal could apply?

### Part 11
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: You learned</b> the solution to this dilemma in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A minor girl can get divorced</b> from her husband even if she was betrothed to him <b>through her father’s betrothal,</b> i.e., her father betrothed her to her husband (see Deuteronomy 22:16).

### Part 12
<b>Why</b> can she? <b>But don’t we need</b> there to be a broad similarity between the <i>halakhot</i> of divorce and betrothal, as derived from the juxtaposition between the clause: <b>“And she departs,”</b> and the clause: <b>“And becomes”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2), which serves as the basis for the comparison of the <i>halakhot</i> of divorce and betrothal? Accordingly, since she will not be eligible to receive her own betrothal until she reaches majority, she should not be able to receive her bill of divorce. <b>Rather,</b> evidently, since <b>she will</b> eventually <b>reach</b> the age of eligibility to receive her own <b>betrothal</b> she is considered essentially eligible for betrothal now as well. <b>Here also,</b> since the minor boy, whom the husband prohibited the wife from marrying, <b>will reach</b> the age of eligibility for <b>betrothal,</b> the divorce is invalid.

### Part 13
Rava raised another dilemma: If the husband says that she is permitted to marry any man <b>except for those who will be born</b> in the future, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be reasoned that <b>now,</b> since <b>in any event they are not yet born,</b> the qualification is void, as it pertains to people who do not exist? <b>Or perhaps</b> they are considered forbidden to her as <b>they will be born in the future.</b>

### Part 14
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: You learned</b> the solution to your dilemma in the mishna, which states that if the husband says that she is forbidden <b>to</b> marry <b>a slave or to</b> marry <b>a gentile</b> the divorce is valid; <b>if it is so</b> that future situations are taken into account, <b>a slave and a gentile are also likely to convert.</b> Therefore, the husband is prohibiting her from marrying a man whom she might be able to marry in the future, which should render the divorce invalid. Evidently, only the present situation is taken into consideration.

### Part 15
The Gemara rejects this solution: <b>Those</b> people <b>do not stand</b> before the court ready <b>to convert.</b> It is only a possibility that they will convert, as there is no reason to assume that they will do so. By contrast, <b>these</b> people who will be born <b>stand</b> ready <b>to be born.</b> Therefore, this solution cannot be inferred from the mishna.

### Part 16
Rava raised another dilemma: If he permits her to marry any man <b>except for her sister’s husband, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be reasoned that <b>now,</b> since <b>in any event she is not yet fit for him,</b> as sexual intercourse between them is punishable by <i>karet</i>, the divorce is valid? <b>Or perhaps</b> should it be reasoned that <b>sometimes</b> a woman’s <b>sister dies and she is</b> thereby <b>fit to</b> marry her husband?

### Part 17
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: You learned</b> the solution to your dilemma in the mishna, which states that if the husband says that she is forbidden <b>to</b> marry <b>a slave or to</b> marry <b>a gentile</b> the divorce is valid. And <b>a slave and a gentile are also</b> potentially fit to marry her as they are <b>likely to convert.</b> Evidently, only the current situation is taken into account. The Gemara rejects this; whereas <b>conversion is uncommon, death is common.</b>

### Part 18
Rava raised another dilemma: If he says to her: You are hereby permitted to any man <b>except for your licentiousness,</b> meaning she may get married to any man but she may not engage in sexual intercourse outside of a second marriage, as she is still rendered a married woman in that regard, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in this case? Is the divorce valid? Should it be reasoned that <b>with regard to marriage he did not leave</b> anything <b>out</b> of the divorce, as she is permitted to marry any man, <b>or perhaps he left out</b> part of the divorce <b>with regard to sexual intercourse?</b>

### Part 19
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: You learned</b> the solution in the mishna: If the husband says while handing her the bill of divorce: You are hereby forbidden <b>to my father or to your father,</b> the divorce is valid. <b>And with regard to what</b> action is this stated? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>with regard to marriage, are my father and your father eligible for marriage?</b> Her betrothal to them would not take effect. <b>Rather, is it not with regard to</b> them engaging in <b>licentiousness</b> with her? <b>And</b> it may be inferred from the mishna that only if he renders her forbidden <b>to my father or to your father is it not</b> considered as if <b>he left out</b> part of the divorce, rendering the divorce valid; but if he renders her forbidden <b>to</b> engage in licentiousness with <b>another</b> man, it is considered as if <b>he left out</b> part of the divorce, and it will not take effect.

### Part 20
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Perhaps</b> the mishna is referring <b>to marriage, where</b> the father <b>transgresses</b> the prohibition <b>and marries</b> her anyway. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to licentiousness cannot be inferred from here.

### Part 21
Rava raised another dilemma: If he says to her that she is permitted to any man <b>except for</b> engaging in <b>intercourse in an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be reasoned that <b>with regard to typical</b> sexual intercourse <b>he did not leave out</b> part of the divorce, rendering the divorce valid? <b>Or perhaps</b> from the fact that the expression: <b>“Cohabitations of a woman”</b> (Leviticus 20:13), <b>is written</b> in the plural, it is derived that typical and atypical sexual intercourse have the same status, and accordingly this is considered a partial divorce, and it will not take effect.

### Part 22
The Gemara raises a similar dilemma: If he says to her that she is permitted to marry any man: <b>Except</b> for the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the nullification of your vows,</b> i.e., no man who marries her can nullify her vows other than her ex-husband, who retains his power to do so, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be reasoned that <b>with regard to</b> her ability to enter into <b>marriage, he did not leave out</b> anything from his act of severance? <b>Or perhaps</b> is it derived from that which <b>is written: “Her husband may sustain it, or her husband may nullify it”</b> (Numbers 30:14), that a husband’s power to nullify his wife’s vows is an intrinsic component of being married, and therefore this divorce is not a complete severance?

### Part 23
The Gemara raises another dilemma: If he says to her: You are hereby permitted to marry any man <b>except for your</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., if she marries a priest she will not be able to partake of <i>teruma</i>, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be reasoned that <b>with regard to</b> her ability to enter into <b>marriage, he did not leave out</b> anything from his act of severance? <b>Or perhaps</b> is it derived from that which <b>is written: “The purchase of his money,</b> he may eat of it” (Leviticus 22:11), indicating that a priest’s wife partakes of <i>teruma</i> because she is his acquisition, and that if she is prohibited from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, then his acquisition of her is not complete?

### Part 24
The Gemara raises another dilemma: If he says to her: You are hereby permitted to marry any man <b>except for your inheritance,</b> i.e., her future husband will not be considered her husband with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of inheritance, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be reasoned that <b>with regard to</b> her ability to enter into <b>marriage, he did not leave out</b> anything from his act of severance? <b>Or perhaps</b> since it is derived that a husband inherits from his wife, who is considered his next of kin, from that which <b>is written: “To his kinsman</b> that is next to him of his family <b>and he shall possess it”</b> (Numbers 27:11), then if a husband does not become his wife’s beneficiary, is their marriage not complete?

### Part 25
The Gemara raises another dilemma: If he says to her: You are hereby permitted to marry any man <b>except for your</b> ability to enter <b>betrothal by</b> receiving <b>a document,</b> i.e., if another man betroths her by giving her a document of betrothal, the betrothal will not take effect, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that since one <b>can</b> still <b>betroth her with money or with sexual intercourse,</b> the act of severance is complete? <b>Or perhaps</b> is it derived from the juxtaposition between the clause: <b>“And she departs”</b> and the clause: <b>“And becomes”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2), that the different ways of <b>becoming</b> a wife <b>are compared to each other,</b> so that the inability to perform one of them renders the severance incomplete?

### Part 26
The Gemara comments: These dilemmas <b>shall</b> all <b>stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 27
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The basic,</b> essential, element <b>of a bill of divorce is: You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man.</b>
