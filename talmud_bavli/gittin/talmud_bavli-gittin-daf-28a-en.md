<b>or</b> in a case <b>where he found it among his utensils</b> in his house, then <b>even</b> if <b>a long time</b> passed, the bill of divorce is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 2
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to the <i>halakha</i> in this dispute: <b>Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that the bill of divorce is valid as long <b>as no person stopped there. Rabba bar bar Ḥana</b> says that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that the bill of divorce is valid as long <b>as no</b> other <b>person passed there.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary to state the actual opinion? <b>Let</b> this <b>Sage,</b> Rav Yehuda citing Shmuel, <b>say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of this <b>Sage,</b> the opinion cited as: Some say; <b>and</b> let this <b>Sage,</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana citing Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel, say that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of this <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. The Gemara answers: <b>Because</b> there are those <b>who reverse</b> the opinions of the <i>tanna’im</i>, they needed to state the opinions explicitly so that there would be no mistake with regard to the <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches that if one <b>found</b> the bill of divorce <b>in a <i>ḥafisa</i> or in a <i>deluskema</i>,</b> then it is valid. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the word <b><i>ḥafisa</i>? Rabba bar bar Ḥana says:</b> It is <b>a small flask. What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>deluskema</i>?</b> It is <b>a purse [<i>telika</i>] of the elderly.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of an agent <b>who brings a bill of divorce</b> to a woman, <b>and</b> when <b>he had left</b> the husband was <b>elderly or sick,</b> the agent <b>gives her</b> the bill of divorce <b>based on</b> the <b>presumption that</b> the husband <b>is</b> still <b>alive,</b> and there is no concern that in the meantime he has died, thereby canceling the bill of divorce.

### Part 6
Similarly, with regard to <b>an Israelite woman who is married to a priest</b> and may therefore partake of <i>teruma</i>, <b>and her husband went to a country overseas, she may</b> continue to <b>partake of <i>teruma</i> based on</b> the <b>presumption that</b> her husband <b>is</b> still <b>alive.</b> Similarly, in the case of <b>one who sends his sin</b>-<b>offering from a country overseas,</b> the priests may <b>offer it</b> on the altar <b>based on</b> the <b>presumption that</b> the one who sent it <b>is</b> still <b>alive.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rava says: They taught</b> that this presumptive status exists <b>only</b> concerning <b>an elderly man who has not reached</b> his years of <b>strength,</b> i.e., the age of eighty, <b>and</b> an ordinary <b>sick person, as</b> the <b>majority of sick</b> people continue <b>to live</b> and recover from their illnesses. <b>But</b> if the husband was <b>an elderly man who had reached</b> his years of <b>strength, or</b> if he was <b>moribund,</b> then, <b>as the majority of moribund</b> people proceed <b>to die,</b> he does <b>not</b> have this presumptive status.

### Part 8
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rava’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to an agent <b>who brings a bill of divorce and left</b> the husband when he was <b>old, even one hundred years old, he gives</b> the bill of divorce <b>to</b> the wife, <b>based on</b> the <b>presumption that</b> her husband <b>is</b> still <b>alive.</b> The Gemara concludes: This is <b>a conclusive refutation,</b> and Rava’s statement is rejected.

### Part 9
The Gemara comments: <b>And if you wish, say</b> that this is not a conclusive refutation. In the case of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>since</b> it is so <b>that</b> the man <b>reached an exceptionally</b> old age, one cannot apply the general presumptions to him and must instead apply presumptions that are for one who has <b>reached an exceptionally</b> old age. However, in a case where someone has not demonstrated that he is an exception to the rule, once he reaches the age of eighty there is a concern that perhaps he has died in the interim.

### Part 10
§ <b>Abaye raises a contradiction before Rabba: We learned</b> in the mishna that in the case of an agent <b>who brings a bill of divorce</b> to a woman <b>and left</b> the husband when he was <b>elderly or sick,</b> the agent <b>gives her</b> the bill of divorce <b>based on</b> the <b>presumption that</b> the husband <b>is</b> still <b>alive. And</b> one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:11) that states: If one is leaving his place of residence, and in order to preclude a situation where his wife would have the status of a deserted wife he gives her a conditional bill of divorce and stipulates: <b>This is your bill of divorce</b> that will take effect <b>one hour prior to my death, it is immediately prohibited for her to partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> due to the concern that he may die immediately after an hour has passed. Apparently, there is a concern that one may die at any point.

### Part 11
Rabba <b>said to him:</b> Do <b>you raise a contradiction</b> from the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>teruma</i> to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>bills of divorce?</b> Concerning <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> it is <b>possible</b> for the wife to eat only non-sacred produce in order to be stringent due to the possibility that her husband may die. However, concerning <b>a bill of divorce it is not possible</b> to take into account the possibility that her husband may die, as there would then be no way for a husband to send a bill of divorce to her with an agent.

### Part 12
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>teruma</i></b> in the mishna <b>to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>teruma</i></b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: With regard to <b>an Israelite woman who is married to a priest</b> and may therefore partake of <i>teruma</i>, <b>and her husband went to a country overseas, she may</b> continue to <b>partake of <i>teruma</i> based on</b> the <b>presumption that</b> her husband <b>is</b> still <b>alive.</b>

### Part 13
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If one says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce</b> that will take effect <b>one hour prior to my death, it is immediately prohibited for her to partake of <i>teruma</i></b> due to the concern that he may die immediately after an hour has passed. These two <i>halakhot</i> appear to contradict one another.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Adda, son of Rav Yitzḥak, said:</b> It <b>is different there, as he rendered her forbidden to himself one hour prior to his death,</b> meaning that she will definitely be prohibited from partaking of <i>teruma</i> at some point. Therefore, it is considered to be an uncertainty immediately. <b>Rav Pappa objects to this</b> answer: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that he will die first</b> and she will be prohibited from partaking of <i>teruma</i>? <b>Perhaps she will die first,</b> and the bill of divorce will never take effect.

### Part 15
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that this is <b>not difficult: This</b> mishna, which permits the woman to partake of <i>teruma</i>, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who is not concerned about</b> potential <b>death. That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which prohibits the woman from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who is concerned about</b> potential <b>death.</b>

### Part 16
<b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Demai</i> 8:7): In the case of <b>one who purchases wine from among the Samaritans,</b> about whom it is assumed that they did not separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes, and he is not in a position to separate <i>teruma</i>, he acts as follows: If there are, for example, one hundred <i>log</i> of wine in the barrels, <b>he says: Two <i>log</i> that I will separate in the future are <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the mandated average measure of <i>teruma</i> is one-fiftieth; <b>ten</b> <i>log</i> are <b>first tithe;</b> and one-tenth of the remainder, which is approximately <b>nine</b> <i>log</i>, are <b>second tithe. And he deconsecrates</b> the second tithe that he will separate in the future, transferring its sanctity to money, <b>and</b> he may <b>drink</b> the wine <b>immediately,</b> relying on the separation that he will perform later, which will clarify retroactively what he designated for the tithes and for <i>teruma</i>. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 17
The <i>baraita</i> continues: However, <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</b> this practice. These Sages, Rabbi Yehuda among them, were concerned that perhaps the wineskin would burst before he would manage to separate the <i>teruma</i>, whereas Rabbi Meir is not concerned about this occurring. Similarly, it is said that Rabbi Meir is not concerned about potential death, and Rabbi Yehuda is concerned.
