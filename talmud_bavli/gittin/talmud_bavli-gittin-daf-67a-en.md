### Part 1
<b>Tell a scribe and he will write</b> the document <b>and</b> tell <b>so-and-so and so-and-so and they will sign</b> it. <b>And due to the shame of the scribe,</b> who asks: Don’t you consider me a sufficiently upright person to sign the document as a witness, the agents <b>are concerned</b> to avoid that disgrace <b>and have one of those witnesses and the scribe sign together with him, and the husband did not say</b> to do <b>so.</b> The bill of divorce is invalid because it was signed contrary to the husband’s instructions, and the agents will mistakenly think it is valid.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>Since the Master said,</b> as cited later, that such a bill of divorce is <b>valid, however, it shall not be done in Israel,</b> as the husband himself should appoint the scribe and the witnesses, <b>it is</b> an <b>uncommon</b> case for the husband to appoint an agent to arrange the bill of divorce, and the Sages do not issue a decree for cases that are uncommon.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And let us be concerned lest</b> the husband <b>say to two</b> people: <b>Tell the scribe and he will write</b> the document <b>and you sign</b> it, <b>and these</b> two, <b>due to the shame of the scribe, go and have the scribe sign</b> the document <b>together with one of them, and the husband did not say</b> to do <b>so.</b> The Sages <b>say:</b> In <b>this</b> case <b>too, it is valid; however, it shall not be done.</b> This too is uncommon, and there is neither concern nor a decree.

### Part 4
The Gemara responds: <b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> in this case as well: It is <b>valid; however, it shall not be done. But according to the one who said:</b> It is <b>valid and it may be done,</b> i.e., it is permitted <i>ab initio</i>, <b>what is there to say?</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rather,</b> this is the explanation. <b>Rabbi Yosei stated two</b> <i>halakhot</i>: The first is that verbal directives cannot be delegated to an agent. The second is that even when the husband said: Tell another to write the document, this agency cannot be transferred to another person. <b>And Shmuel holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yosei <b>in one</b> case, i.e., that verbal directives cannot be delegated to an agent, <b>and he disagrees with him in one</b> case, as Shmuel holds that if the husband explicitly said: Tell another to write the document, this agency can be transferred.

### Part 6
§ With regard to <b>the</b> previously cited matter <b>itself, Shmuel says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who <b>says:</b> Verbal <b>directives cannot be delegated to an agent. Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>said before</b> his father: <b>Since Rabbi Meir and</b> Rabbi <b>Ḥanina of Ono,</b> who hold that verbal directives can be delegated to an agent, <b>disagree with Rabbi Yosei, what led Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>to say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei?</b>

### Part 7
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to his</b> son: <b>Be silent, my son; be silent. You did not see Rabbi Yosei, as, if you had seen him,</b> you would know that <b>his reasoning [<i>nimmuko</i>] accompanies his</b> statements. Therefore, I deem his opinion most reliable.

### Part 8
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Isi ben Yehuda would recount the praise of the Sages</b> by characterizing each of them: <b>Rabbi Meir, a scholar and scribe; Rabbi Yehuda, a scholar when he chooses</b> to be one; <b>Rabbi Tarfon, a pile of nuts,</b> as, just as when one removes a nut from a pile all the other nuts fall, so too, when a student would ask Rabbi Tarfon with regard to one matter, he would cite sources from all the disciplines of the Torah; <b>Rabbi Yishmael, a well-stocked store; Rabbi Akiva, a full storehouse; Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, a peddler’s basket,</b> in which there is a small amount of each product; <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, a basket of</b> fragrant <b>spices,</b> as everything he says is reasonable; <b>the mishna of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov</b> is <b>measured [<i>kav</i>] and immaculate; Rabbi Yosei, his reasoning accompanies his</b> statements; <b>Rabbi Shimon grinds much and removes little.</b>

### Part 9
It is <b>taught</b> in explanation: Rabbi Shimon <b>would forget little</b> of his studies, <b>and what he removed</b> from his memory, <b>he removed only chaff. And likewise, Rabbi Shimon said to his students: My sons, accept my</b> halakhic <b>rulings, as my rulings are the finest</b> rulings <b>of the finest rulings of Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 10
§ With regard to <b>the</b> matter previously cited <b>itself,</b> a case where <b>one</b> who <b>said to two</b> people: <b>Tell a scribe and he will write</b> the document <b>and</b> tell <b>so-and-so and so-and-so and they will sign</b> it, <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> It is <b>valid; however, it shall not be done in Israel</b> <i>ab initio</i>. The husband himself must appoint the scribe and witnesses.

### Part 11
<b>Ulla said to Rav Naḥman, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman</b> said <b>to Ulla: Since</b> it is <b>valid, why shall it not be done in Israel? He said to him: We are concerned lest</b> the woman <b>hire witnesses.</b> Since this is permitted by means of an agent, and the witnesses themselves do not know what the husband said, a woman could hire witnesses to tell a scribe to write a bill of divorce on her behalf and hire witnesses to sign it without her husband’s knowledge.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But are we concerned</b> about that possibility? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Yevamot</i> 4:7): With regard to <b>witnesses who are signed on a field of sale and a woman’s bill of divorce, the Sages were not concerned with regard to this matter</b> of forgery, that perhaps these documents were written without consent of the owner and the husband, respectively. The Gemara answers: Although <b>they</b> would <b>not perform an action</b> and forge a bill of divorce, <b>they</b> would <b>utter a statement</b> and tell another to forge a document. The other person acts unknowingly, unaware of the impropriety involved.

### Part 13
The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i>: If <b>one said to two</b> people: <b>Tell the scribe and he will write</b> the document <b>and you sign</b> it, <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> This bill of divorce is <b>valid; however, it shall not be done</b> <i>ab initio</i>. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says:</b> It is <b>valid and it may be done</b> <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 14
Several other <i>amora’im</i> dispute this matter. <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> It is <b>valid; however, it shall not be done</b> <i>ab initio</i>. <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> It is <b>valid and it may be done</b> <i>ab initio</i>. <b>Rabba says:</b> It is <b>valid; however, it shall not be done. Rav Yosef says:</b> It is <b>valid and it may be done.</b>
