<b>and puts it in his pocket</b> without giving it to her, as he thought <b>that if she appeases [<i>mippayyesa</i>]</b> him <b>he will be appeased, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> when he then does give it to her? Since the date on the document is incorrect, did the Sages institute an ordinance that such a bill of divorce should not be used?

### Part 2
Rava <b>said to him: A person does not hasten a calamity on himself</b> and will not ordinarily prepare a bill of divorce in advance. Rather, he will wait until he is ready to divorce his wife. Since this scenario is unlikely, the Sages did not see a need to institute an ordinance pertaining to it.

### Part 3
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> When there are <b>bills of divorce that come from a country overseas which are written,</b> for example, <b>in</b> the month of <b>Nisan, and they do not reach</b> the woman <b>until</b> the month of <b>Tishrei, what did the Sages accomplish with their ordinance</b> to date the bill of divorce? All of the concerns about an undated bill of divorce still apply. <b>He said to him:</b> Concerning <b>these</b> bills of divorce from overseas, it is <b>public knowledge</b> that they do not take effect from the date on which they were written. Therefore, if there is a conflict over produce the husband has sold, the woman must bring witnesses to testify as to when she received her bill of divorce.

### Part 4
§ The Sages decreed that it is prohibited for a woman to remarry within three months of her divorce or her becoming a widow, in order to prevent a situation of doubt concerning the paternity of a child. <b>It was stated: From when</b> does one begin <b>counting</b> the three months <b>with regard to a bill of divorce? Rav says: From the time of</b> the <b>giving</b> of the bill of divorce, <b>and Shmuel says: From the time of</b> the <b>writing</b> of the bill of divorce.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Natan bar Hoshaya objects to this: According to</b> the statement of <b>Shmuel,</b> now people <b>will say:</b> If <b>two women</b> who live <b>in one courtyard</b> received their bills of divorce at the same time, but the first document was written at the time of the divorce and the second one was written earlier, then <b>this</b> woman <b>is</b> still <b>prohibited</b> from remarrying, as three months have not yet passed from when her bill of divorce was written; <b>and that</b> woman is already <b>permitted</b> to remarry. This does not seem reasonable. <b>Abaye said to him:</b> This is not difficult. With regard to <b>this</b> woman, <b>the date of her bill of divorce proves concerning her</b> that she may not remarry yet; <b>and</b> with regard to <b>that</b> woman, <b>the date on her bill of divorce proves concerning her</b> that she may remarry already.

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav,</b> and it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel.</b> The Gemara explains: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav</b> that the three-month count begins from when the bill of divorce is given: In the case of <b>one who sends a bill of divorce to his wife, and the agent tarries on the way for three months, once the bill of divorce reaches her hand she must wait three months</b> before remarrying. <b>And one need not be concerned that</b> it is <b>an outdated bill of divorce,</b> i.e., that the husband and wife were secluded after it was written, rendering the bill of divorce invalid, <b>because he was not secluded with her</b> during the time the bill of divorce was being delivered.

### Part 7
It <b>is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel</b> that the count begins from the time of the writing: In the case of <b>one who</b> is about to travel and <b>deposits a bill of divorce for his wife</b> with a trustee <b>and says to him: Give it to her only after three months, once he gives it to her, she is permitted to marry immediately</b> and is not required to wait an additional three months. <b>And one need not</b> be <b>concerned that</b> it is <b>an outdated bill of divorce, as he was not secluded with her</b> in the interim.

### Part 8
It is told that <b>Rav Kahana and Rav Pappi and Rav Ashi would in practice</b> count three months <b>from the time of</b> the <b>writing,</b> but <b>Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, would in practice</b> count these three months <b>from the time of</b> the <b>giving. And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that the counting begins <b>from the time of</b> the <b>writing.</b>

### Part 9
§ The Gemara discusses another dispute between Rav and Shmuel with regard to documents. According to the terms of a marriage contract, a widow is entitled to payment of its value upon the death of her husband. By Torah law, all outstanding debts are canceled at the close of the Sabbatical Year. A woman need not take her marriage settlement as soon as her husband dies. The issue at hand is at what point the marriage contract generates a concrete debt that will be canceled by the Sabbatical Year. <b>It was stated: From when</b> is the debt established by <b>a marriage contract canceled</b> in the Sabbatical Year?

### Part 10
<b>Rav says:</b> The marriage contract becomes like a debt and will be canceled in the Sabbatical Year <b>from</b> the time <b>when</b> the woman <b>collects partial payment and establishes</b> the rest as a debt in court. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> This occurs when <b>she</b> either <b>collects partial payment although she did not establish</b> it as debt, or <b>she established</b> the entire value of the marriage contract as a debt in court <b>although she did not collect partial payment.</b>

### Part 11
With regard to this dispute, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav,</b> and it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel.</b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav: From when is</b> the debt established by <b>a marriage contract canceled? From when she accepts partial payment and establishes</b> the rest as a debt in court. However, if <b>she accepted partial payment but did not establish</b> the debt, or <b>established</b> the debt <b>but did not accept partial payment,</b> then <b>it is not canceled until she accepts partial payment and establishes</b> the debt.

### Part 12
It <b>is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel:</b> If the fine and damages paid by one who commits <b>rape; or</b> the <b>fine</b> paid by one who falsely claims his wife was not a virgin at the time of their wedding; <b>or</b> the fine paid for <b>seduction; or</b> the debt established by <b>a woman’s marriage contract was established as a loan,</b> then the Sabbatical Year <b>cancels it. And if</b> one did <b>not</b> establish these payments as loans, then the Sabbatical Year <b>does not cancel them. From when</b> is it considered that these payments <b>have been established as a loan? From the time of standing trial,</b> because the abstract obligation to pay becomes a debt once the court ruled that one is required to pay.

### Part 13
§ The Gemara discusses other aspects of the marriage contract. <b>Shmuel said: A marriage contract is</b> considered to be <b>like a court enactment. Just as court enactments may be written during the day and</b> then <b>signed at night,</b> and the fact that the writing and signing were not performed on the same day does not present a problem, <b>so too, a marriage contract may be written during the day and</b> then <b>signed at night.</b> It is told: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Rav’s marriage contract was written during the day and</b> then <b>signed at night,</b> and <b>Rav was there and he did not say anything to</b> the people who wrote and signed it. This indicates that Rav agrees with the ruling of Shmuel.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel?</b> The Gemara rejects this: This cannot be proven from here because the scribe and witnesses <b>were</b> continuously <b>engaged in that matter</b> of writing the marriage contract, from when it was written in the day until they signed it at night, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Tzadok said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that a document written during the day and signed at night is invalid <b>only when</b> the scribe and witnesses <b>were not</b> continuously <b>engaged in that matter, but</b> if they <b>were</b> continuously <b>engaged in that matter</b> until nightfall, then it is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 15
§ The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Shimon deems valid</b> a bill of divorce written during the day and signed at night. <b>Rava said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon?</b> He <b>holds</b> that <b>once</b> the husband <b>has decided to divorce her, he no longer has</b> the rights to <b>the produce</b> from his wife’s property, and it is clear that he has decided to divorce her when he writes a bill of divorce. Consequently, the woman obtains the rights to the produce from the moment the bill of divorce was written, regardless of when it was signed.

### Part 16
<b>Reish Lakish says: Rabbi Shimon deems</b> such a bill of divorce <b>valid only</b> if it is signed <b>immediately,</b> when the witnesses signed the bill of divorce during the night after it was written. <b>However,</b> if the delay in signing was <b>from now,</b> i.e., when the bill of divorce was written, <b>until ten days</b> have elapsed, i.e., when there is an extended delay, he does <b>not</b> deem it valid.
