### Part 1
<b>as it teaches</b> by <b>skipping one</b> by <b>one.</b> The examples given relate to one witness missing, e.g., seven ties and six witnesses, and so on. They do not include a case in which two witnesses are missing, e.g., seven ties and five witnesses. This indicates that the dispute between Rabbi Akiva and Ben Azzai is only with regard to the signature of one witness. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that this is so.

### Part 2
<b>Abaye said: Learn from it</b> that <b>this relative,</b> who is allowed to sign a folded and tied bill of divorce, can <b>sign if he wants</b> to sign, <b>either at the beginning,</b> as the first signature, <b>in the middle, or at the end.</b>

### Part 3
<b>From where</b> does Abaye infer this? <b>From</b> the fact that <b>it did not designate a place for him</b> to sign. <b>And learn from it,</b> as well, that <b>from any three</b> of the witnesses who signed on a folded and tied bill of divorce, <b>we</b> can <b>ratify</b> the bill of divorce, i.e., it can be ratified based on their signatures. <b>And we do not need</b> to confirm the signatures specifically of three <b>consecutive</b> witnesses.

### Part 4
<b>As if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we need consecutive</b> witnesses, then <b>they should designate a place for this relative</b> to sign, <b>in the beginning, or in the middle, or at the end, and they should</b> then <b>validate</b> the use of <b>many</b> disqualified witnesses. It could have been instituted that every third witness may be disqualified. Since in any group of three witnesses, two of them would be valid, more than one disqualified witness could be allowed. Since it is possible to ratify a bill of divorce by confirming signatures that are not consecutive, and therefore there is concern that the court will rely on two disqualified witnesses, the Sages consequently allowed the use of only one disqualified witness.

### Part 5
With regard to the <i>halakha</i> concerning the dispute in the mishna, it is related that <b>when they came before Rabbi Ami</b> with a question pertaining to a bare bill of divorce that needed more witnesses, <b>he said to</b> the person overseeing: <b>Go out and complete it</b> even with <b>a slave from the</b> general <b>public,</b> in accordance with the opinion of ben Nannas.
