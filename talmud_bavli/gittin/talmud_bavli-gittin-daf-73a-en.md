### Part 1
<b>And this teaches us that we require assessment</b> only in a case <b>where he walked with his staff.</b> But in <b>another</b> case, where he did not arise from his illness and walk but immediately became ill again, <b>we do not even require assessment,</b> as it is clear that his death from the second illness was a result of the first illness.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: Can <b>you conclude from it</b> that in the case of <b>a person on his deathbed who proceeded from</b> one <b>illness</b> immediately <b>to</b> another <b>illness, his gift</b> is a valid <b>gift,</b> as he ultimately died as a result of the first illness? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as Rabbi Elazar says in the name of Rav:</b> In the case of <b>a person on his deathbed who proceeded from</b> one <b>illness</b> immediately <b>to</b> another <b>illness, his gift</b> is a valid <b>gift.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara notes: <b>Rabba and Rava do not hold</b> in accordance with <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> stated <b>by Rav Huna,</b> that if the husband was healed of his illness then the bill of divorce is nullified even if did not specify such a condition. They hold that there is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> in place <b>lest</b> people <b>say</b> that <b>there</b> can be a valid <b>bill of divorce</b> given <b>after death.</b> Since people will see that in this case the bill of divorce took effect only once the husband died, in the future they may mistakenly consider a bill of divorce to be valid even though the husband explicitly made a condition that it would take effect only after his death.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And is there anything that by Torah law is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce, but due to a</b> rabbinic <b>decree we permit a married woman to</b> marry <b>anyone,</b> even though by Torah law she remains married to her husband? Both Rabba and Rava agree that by Torah law the bill of divorce is nullified once the husband is healed from his illness, yet they treat the bill of divorce as valid. How can this be?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> the Sages have the ability to nullify even a marriage that took effect by Torah law, because <b>anyone who betroths</b> a woman <b>betroths</b> her contingent <b>upon the will of the Sages, and</b> when one fails to conform to their will in matters of marriage and divorce <b>the Sages expropriated his betrothal from him</b> retroactively. Consequently, it is permitted for the woman to remarry.

### Part 6
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> This <b>works out well</b> in a case <b>where he betrothed</b> his wife <b>with money,</b> as it is possible to say that the Sages expropriated the money used for the betrothal from the possession of its owner, resulting in a retroactive cancellation of the betrothal. But if <b>he betrothed</b> her <b>by means of sexual intercourse</b> then <b>what is there to say?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: The Sages declared his sexual intercourse</b> to be <b>licentious sexual intercourse,</b> which does not create a bond of betrothal.

### Part 7
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:2): If a husband says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce from today if I die from this illness, and the house collapsed on him or a snake bit him,</b> then <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> But if he said: This is your bill of divorce <b>if I will not arise</b> healthy <b>from this illness, and the house collapsed on him or a snake bit him,</b> then <b>this is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in <b>the first clause</b> such that the bill of divorce is not valid <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> that the bill of divorce is valid? In neither case did he die from the illness. The Gemara gives no answer to this question.

### Part 9
<b>They sent</b> a ruling to Babylonia <b>from there,</b> from Eretz Yisrael: If the husband said: This is your bill of divorce if I am not healed from this illness, and <b>a lion ate him,</b> then <b>we do not</b> need to be concerned about this bill of divorce, for it is certainly not valid.

### Part 10
It is related: There was <b>a certain man who sold land to another,</b> and he <b>accepted upon himself</b> the responsibility for <b>any unavoidable accident that may happen</b> to the land. In such a case he would reimburse the buyer for the damage. <b>In the end they diverted a river into it,</b> meaning the government decided to make a new canal through the land that he sold.

### Part 11
The buyer <b>came before Ravina</b> to lodge a claim. Ravina <b>said to</b> the seller: <b>Go pacify him,</b> i.e., reimburse him, <b>as you accepted upon yourself</b> responsibility for <b>any unavoidable accident that might happen. Rav Aḥa bar Taḥalifa</b> disagreed and <b>said to Ravina: It is an uncommon, unavoidable accident,</b> and the condition of the sale should not apply in such a case.

### Part 12
<b>The matter was circulated,</b> as this ruling was never finalized, <b>and it came before Rava. He said to them: It is an uncommon, unavoidable accident,</b> and the seller should not have to pay. <b>Ravina raised an objection to Rava:</b> Isn’t it taught that if the husband said: This is your bill of divorce <b>if I am not healed from this illness, and the house collapsed on him or a snake bit him</b> then <b>it is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce?</b> These cases are both uncommon, unavoidable accidents, yet the bill of divorce is valid.

### Part 13
<b>Rava said to him: But</b> you can <b>say</b> an opposite inference <b>from the first clause:</b> If a husband says: This is your bill of divorce from today if I die from this illness, and the house collapsed on him or a snake bit him, then <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> Apparently, an uncommon, unavoidable accident is not included within his condition. If so, the inference from first clause of the <i>baraita</i> contradicts the inference from latter clause and it cannot be used to prove either opinion.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: And because</b> there is <b>a difficulty</b> presented by the contradiction between <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>and the latter clause, can we no</b> longer <b>raise an objection from it?</b> Seemingly, the challenge raised by Ravina from the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> is still valid.

### Part 15
Ravina <b>said to him: Yes,</b> Rava was correct. <b>Since</b> there is <b>a difficulty</b> presented by the contradiction between <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>and the latter clause,</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>was</b> never <b>stated</b> in <b>the study hall and it is corrupted.</b> As it is not possible to rely on this <i>baraita</i> one must <b>follow reason,</b> and the most reasonable interpretation is that his condition would not include an uncommon and unavoidable accident.

### Part 16
It is related that <b>Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, purchased sesame on the bank of the Malka River. They hired sailors to cross them</b> to the other side of the river, and the sailors <b>accepted upon themselves</b> responsibility for <b>any unavoidable accident that might occur. In the end the Malka River was dammed</b> so that the merchandise could not be transported by river.

### Part 17
The two Sages <b>said to them: Hire donkeys and release them to us</b> in order to transport the sesame, <b>as you accepted upon yourself</b> responsibility for <b>any unavoidable accident that might arise.</b>

### Part 18
The two Sages <b>came</b> to court <b>before Rava</b> and <b>he said to</b> them: <b>You white geese [<i>kakei ḥivarei</i>],</b> referring to their long, white beards, <b>who strip men of their cloaks.</b> You are acting unfairly with the sailors. <b>It is an uncommon, unavoidable accident</b> for the Malka River to be dammed, and the sailors did not accept responsibility for this case.

### Part 19
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a woman’s ill husband gave her a bill of divorce, and made a condition that it should take effect from today if he dies from his illness, then <b>she may be secluded with him only in the presence of two witnesses,</b> lest they end up engaging in sexual intercourse.

### Part 20
This applies to being secluded in the presence of not only valid witnesses; it is permitted for her to be secluded with him <b>even in the presence of a slave</b> or <b>even in the presence of a maidservant, except for</b> the wife’s personal <b>maidservant.</b> And it is prohibited for the wife to be secluded in the presence of the latter <b>because she is accustomed to her maidservant,</b> and there is concern that she will engage in sexual intercourse with her husband even though the maidservant is present.

### Part 21
<b>What is</b> the halakhic status of the wife <b>during these days</b> between when the bill of divorce was given but before the condition has been fulfilled with the death of the husband? <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> She is
