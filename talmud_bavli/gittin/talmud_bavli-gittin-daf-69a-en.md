### Part 1
§ As a remedy <b>for eye disease [<i>beroketi</i>], let him bring</b> the body of <b>a seven-colored scorpion, dry it in the shade, and grind</b> together <b>two portions of stibium and one portion of</b> the dried scorpion. <b>And let him place three eyebrushes full in this eye, and three eyebrushes</b> full <b>in that eye. But he should not place more, as if</b> he does <b>not</b> heed this advice and he does place more, <b>his eye will burst.</b>

### Part 2
As a remedy <b>for night blindness, he should bring a rope of</b> animal <b>hair [<i>shudra barka</i>], and he should tie one of his legs and one leg of a dog</b> together with the rope. <b>And let children throw</b> pottery <b>shards behind him, and let them say to him: The dog is old</b> and <b>the rooster is foolish. And let him take seven</b> pieces of <b>raw meat from seven houses and let him leave them for him in the socket of the door. And let him</b> then <b>eat them in the junkyard of the city. Afterward, he should untie the rope of hair and say as follows: The blindness of so-and-so, son of so-and-so; leave so-and-so, son of so-and-so; and</b> then they say: <b>Let them blow into the dog’s eye.</b>

### Part 3
As a remedy <b>for day blindness,</b> hemeralopia, which is the inability to see clearly in bright light, <b>let him bring seven animal spleens, and let</b> the patient <b>roast them on</b> the pottery <b>shard of a bloodletter. And let</b> the patient <b>sit on the inside</b> of the house <b>and</b> let <b>another person</b> sit <b>on the outside, and let</b> the patient <b>say to</b> himself: <b>Blind man, give me</b> something <b>to eat, and let the other</b> one <b>say to</b> the patient: <b>Seeing man, take</b> and <b>eat. And after</b> the patient <b>eats, let him break the shard, as if not,</b> the blindness <b>will follow him.</b>

### Part 4
As a remedy <b>for a nosebleed, let</b> the patient <b>bring a man named Levi</b> who is <b>a priest, and</b> that man <b>should write for</b> the patient the name <b>Levi, backward. And if</b> the patient is <b>not</b> able do this <b>let him bring an ordinary man, and let</b> that man <b>write for</b> the patient the following expression: <b>I am Pappi Sheila bar Summakei.</b> And that man should also write this <b>backward.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And if</b> he is <b>not</b> able to do this <b>let</b> that man <b>write for</b> the patient <b>like this: Taste from a bucket in silver water, taste from a bucket in tainted water. And if</b> the patient is <b>not</b> able to do this <b>let him bring the root of fodder [<i>aspasta</i>], rope [<i>ashla</i>] from an old bed, and paper [<i>kurtesa</i>], and saffron, and the red</b> portion <b>of a palm branch, and let him burn them with each other. And let</b> the patient <b>bring a fleece of wool and spin</b> it into <b>two strings, and let him soak [<i>litmish</i>] them in vinegar, roll them in this ash</b> of the burned materials, <b>and place</b> them <b>in his nostrils.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And if</b> the patient is <b>not</b> able to do this <b>let him look at a stream of water flowing from</b> the <b>east toward</b> the <b>west, and let him spread</b> his legs <b>and stand</b> with <b>one foot on this side and one foot on that side. And let him take clay in his right hand from under his left foot, and</b> let him take clay <b>with his left hand from under his right foot. And let him spin two strings of wool, soak</b> them <b>in the clay, and place them in his nostrils.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And if</b> the patient is <b>not</b> able to do this <b>let him sit under the gutter and let them bring water and pour it on him. And let them say: Just as the water has ceased, let the blood of so-and-so, son of so-and-so, cease.</b>

### Part 8
As a remedy <b>for blood that comes from the mouth we check</b> the patient <b>with a straw of wheat. If</b> the blood <b>sticks</b> to the straw then it comes <b>from his lungs and it has a remedy. But if</b> the blood does <b>not</b> stick to the straw, it means that the blood <b>comes from the liver and it has no remedy.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Ami said to Rav Ashi: But didn’t we learn the opposite</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 42a): If <b>the liver was</b> completely <b>removed and none of it remains,</b> then it is considered to be an animal with a condition that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>]. But in the case of <b>a lung that is punctured or missing,</b> the animal is considered to be a <i>tereifa</i>, even it is has not been completely removed. This indicates that damage to the lung is more serious than damage to the liver. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Since</b> the blood <b>comes out from</b> this person’s <b>mouth,</b> one must <b>say that</b> the liver has <b>dissolved</b> and he will not survive.

### Part 10
<b>The Master said: If the</b> blood <b>comes from the lungs</b> then <b>it has a remedy.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is its remedy?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Let him bring seven fistfuls of sliced beets, and seven fistfuls of sliced leek, and five fistfuls of <i>perida</i></b> grass, <b>and three fistfuls of lentils, and a fistful of cumin, and a fistful of ropes, and a corresponding</b> amount of <b>the intestines of a firstborn animal. And let him cook</b> all of it together <b>and let him eat</b> everything <b>and afterward let him drink good, strong beer.</b>

### Part 11
With regard to the remedy <b>for</b> pain in one’s <b>teeth [<i>lekhakha</i>], Rabba bar Rav Huna said: Let him bring</b> an <b>individual garlic</b> that grew as a single clove <b>and grind it with oil and salt. And let him place it on the thumbnail of the side that hurts him, and let him surround it</b> with <b>a rim [<i>gedanpa</i>] of dough. And he should take care</b> that it does not touch <b>his flesh</b> because it is <b>harmful</b> and can cause <b>boils.</b>

### Part 12
With regard to the remedy <b>for gums, Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <b>Spanish chamomile [<i>ḥomti</i>]</b> plant is <b>like</b> the <b><i>mamru</i></b> plant, <b>and the root</b> of the <b>Spanish chamomile is preferable to <i>mamru</i>, and let him take it in his mouth. This</b> is meant <b>to stabilize</b> the illness so that it does not intensify. <b>To boil them,</b> meaning to cause the wounds to open so that the pus can be removed from them, <b>let him bring the</b> coarsest <b>bran</b> found <b>at the upper portion of the sifter, and lentils in their dirt, and fenugreek [<i>shuvlilta</i>], and the flower of the hop</b> plant. <b>And let him take</b> an amount <b>about</b> the size of a <b>nut in his mouth.</b>

### Part 13
In order <b>to open</b> the blisters to remove the pus, <b>let his friend blow white cress</b> into his mouth <b>with a straw of wheat.</b> And if he wishes <b>to heal</b> the blisters <b>let him bring dirt found in the shade of the bathroom and knead it with honey and eat it, as this is effective</b> for curing the blisters.

### Part 14
<b>For a bronchial infection [<i>levarsam</i>], let him bring a nut-sized</b> amount <b>of ammonia [<i>nishdor</i>]</b> water <b>and a</b> nut-sized amount <b>of sweet galbanum, and a large spoonful of white honey, a vessel from Meḥoza,</b> i.e., one that holds a quarter-<i>log</i> of liquid, <b>full of clear [<i>nekida</i>] wine, and let him boil them together. And once the ammonia is cooked everything will have cooked. And if</b> he is <b>not</b> able to do this <b>let him bring a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of milk from a white goat,</b>
