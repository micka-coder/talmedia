### Part 1
Why not? Because <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he appeased</b> his wife and engaged in sexual intercourse with her, thereby invalidating the bill of divorce. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even</b> if the delay in signing was <b>from now until ten days</b> later Rabbi Shimon deems it valid. There is no concern that he appeased her because <b>if it is so</b> that <b>he appeased</b> her, then <b>the matter</b> becomes <b>public knowledge,</b> and all would hear of it.

### Part 2
§ <b>It was stated</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish disagreed with regard to the following case: If the husband <b>says to ten</b> men: <b>Write a bill of divorce for my wife, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> He means that all of them should sign the bill of divorce. <b>Two</b> of them function <b>as witnesses, and all</b> the rest <b>of them</b> sign the bill of divorce only <b>due to</b> the <b>stipulation</b> that the husband had stated. He made the bill of divorce dependent upon all of them signing, but he did not mean that ten men need to actually function as witnesses. <b>And Reish Lakish says: All of them</b> function <b>as witnesses.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which all of them have to sign? <b>If we say</b> that <b>he did not say to them: All of you,</b> but just said to them: You should write a bill of divorce for my wife, <b>didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (66b) that if <b>one said to ten</b> people: <b>Write a bill of divorce for my wife,</b> then <b>one</b> would <b>write, and two</b> would <b>sign,</b> and not all ten of them are required to sign. <b>Rather,</b> the case of their dispute is <b>when he said to them: All of you</b> write a bill of divorce for my wife, and in this instance is was taught later on in that mishna that one person writes the bill of divorce and everyone else must sign it.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish; what is the difference if the rest of the men function as witnesses or just in order to fulfill the man’s stipulation? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> in a case <b>where two of them signed on that day and the rest</b> signed not on the day it was written but <b>from now until ten days</b> later. According to <b>the one who says</b> that the other signatures are <b>due to the stipulation,</b> the bill of divorce is <b>valid,</b> because two witnesses signed the bill of divorce on the same day that it was written, and the stipulation was also fulfilled. <b>And</b> according to <b>the one who says</b> that all these people sign <b>due to</b> his wish that they all function as <b>witnesses,</b> it is <b>invalid</b> because not all the witnesses signed the bill of divorce on the day it was written.

### Part 5
<b>Alternatively,</b> there is another difference between them, in a case <b>where one of these</b> ten people <b>is found</b> to be <b>a relative</b> of the husband or wife, <b>or</b> is otherwise found to be <b>disqualified</b> to serve as a witness. <b>According to the one who says</b> that the other signatures are <b>due to the stipulation,</b> this bill of divorce is <b>valid</b> because the disqualified person did not serve as a witness. He just signed the bill of divorce in order to fulfill the stipulation, and the bill of divorce has the signature of two qualified witnesses. <b>According to the one who says</b> that all these people sign <b>due to</b> the man’s wish that they all function as <b>witnesses,</b> the bill of divorce would be <b>invalid,</b> as is the case whenever one member of a group of witnesses is disqualified.

### Part 6
The Gemara adds another point of dispute: According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who holds that the other witnesses sign due to the husband’s stipulation, <b>if a relative or</b> other <b>disqualified</b> witness <b>signed at the beginning,</b> before two valid witnesses had signed, then <b>some say</b> the bill of divorce is <b>valid and some say</b> that it is <b>invalid. Some say</b> that it is <b>valid</b> because the request for ten signatures <b>is a stipulation.</b> Since these ten people are not meant to serve as witnesses and are meant only to fulfill the stipulation, it makes no difference if they signed at the beginning or at the end. <b>Some say</b> that it is <b>invalid</b> because there is a concern that the courts <b>will come to confuse it with typical documents,</b> and they will rely on disqualified witnesses in those cases.

### Part 7
It is told: There was <b>a certain person who said to ten</b> men: <b>Write a bill of divorce for my wife. Two of them signed that day and the others</b> signed after a delay <b>from now until ten days</b> later. <b>He came before Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> to ask what the <i>halakha</i> is with regard to such a bill of divorce. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said to him:</b>
