### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that there is also another essential sentence: <b>And this that you shall have from me is a scroll of divorce, and a letter of leave, and a bill of dismissal to go to marry any man that you wish.</b> And <b>the basic</b> element <b>of a bill of manumission</b> for a maidservant is: <b>You are hereby a free woman,</b> or: <b>You are hereby your own.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is obvious</b> that if one <b>stated</b> in a bill of divorce <b>for his wife: You are hereby a free woman, he has stated nothing,</b> as that is not a statement of divorce. Similarly, if one <b>stated</b> in a bill of manumission <b>for his maidservant: You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man, he has stated nothing,</b> as that is not a statement of manumission.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: If <b>he stated</b> in a bill of divorce <b>for</b> his <b>wife: You are hereby your own, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Is he saying to her:</b> You are <b>entirely</b> your own, meaning that she has full control over her status and may marry another man? <b>Or is he saying to her:</b> You are your own with regard <b>to work,</b> meaning that she may keep the revenue from her work? If so, this is not a statement of divorce.

### Part 4
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution <b>that we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>The basic</b> element <b>of a bill of manumission is: You are hereby a free woman,</b> or: <b>You are hereby your own. And just as</b> with regard to <b>a slave, whose body is acquired</b> by the master, <b>if</b> the master <b>states</b> in a bill of manumission <b>for</b> the slave: <b>You are hereby your own,</b> the slave <b>acquires his body, all the more so</b> with regard to <b>a wife, whose body is not acquired</b> by her husband, is it <b>not</b> clear that by his writing in a bill of divorce: You are hereby your own, she is completely released from their marriage?

### Part 5
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> If <b>he stated</b> in a bill of manumission <b>for his slave: I have no business with you, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this a valid statement of manumission?

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ḥanin said to Rav Ashi, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Ḥanin from Meḥoza</b> who said this <b>to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution <b>that we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who sells his slave to a gentile,</b> the slave <b>is emancipated but</b> nevertheless <b>requires a bill of manumission from his first master. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is <b>when</b> the master <b>did not write his document for</b> the slave when he sold him; <b>but</b> if <b>he wrote his document for him, that is</b> the slave’s bill of <b>manumission.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the phrase: <b>His document,</b> referring to? <b>Rav Sheshet says that he writes for him</b> as follows: <b>When you will escape from</b> the gentile to whom I sold you, <b>I have no business with you.</b> Consequently, as soon as he escapes his gentile master in any manner, he is entirely emancipated. It may be derived from here that the statement: I have no business with you, is valid with regard to manumission.

### Part 8
§ It is stated in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that in addition to the statement: You are hereby permitted to marry any man, there is another essential sentence in the bill of divorce: <b>And this [<i>veden</i>] that you shall have from me is a scroll of divorce and a letter [<i>ve’iggeret</i>] of leave.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that <b>ambiguous intimations are valid intimations.</b> An incomplete statement is sufficient as long as the intention is clear from the context. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>even if he does not write for her</b> explicitly: <b>And this</b> that you shall have from me is a scroll of divorce and a letter of leave, the bill of divorce is valid as <b>it is evident that he is divorcing her with this bill of divorce.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>ambiguous intimations are not valid intimations, and</b> therefore <b>the reason</b> that the bill of divorce <b>is</b> valid is <b>that he writes for her: And this</b> that you shall have from me is a scroll of divorce and a letter of leave, <b>so it is evident that he is divorcing her with this bill of divorce. But</b> if <b>he does not write for her: And this</b> that you shall have from me is a scroll of divorce and a letter of leave, people <b>will say</b> that <b>he is divorcing her orally,</b> and will mistakenly assume that the husband’s statement to her when he hands her the bill of divorce is what causes the divorce to take effect, <b>and</b> that <b>the document is merely evidence</b> of the divorce, rather than the divorce itself.

### Part 10
§ The Gemara relates several rulings concerning the precise terminology to be used in writing a bill of divorce. <b>Abaye said: This person who writes a bill of divorce should not write</b> the word meaning: <b>And this,</b> by spelling it <i>vav</i>, <i>dalet</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>nun</i>, <b>as</b> that can be misread as having the vowel of a <i>ḥirik</i> under the letter <i>dalet</i>, not a <i>tzeire</i>. Read with a <i>ḥirik</i>, it <b>indicates: And</b> there is <b>a law</b> that we should get divorced. <b>Rather,</b> he should make sure to write the word meaning: <b>And this,</b> without a <i>yod</i>, so that it is clear that it should be read with a <i>tzeire</i>.

### Part 11
<b>And he should not write</b> the word meaning: <b>A letter,</b> by spelling it <i>alef</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>reish</i>, <i>tav</i>, <b>as</b> that can be confused with another identically spelled word that <b>indicates a roof. Rather,</b> he should write the word meaning: <b>A letter,</b> without a <i>yod</i>. <b>And he should not write: To go,</b> by spelling it <i>lamed</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>khaf</i>, <b>as</b> that could be read as a conjunction which <b>indicates: For me from this. And he should</b> be sure <b>not to write <i>limḥakh</i>,</b> i.e., he must be careful that the letter <i>heh</i> not look like a <i>ḥet</i>, <b>as that indicates</b> that it is <b>like a joke.</b>

### Part 12
Abaye continues: In the clause: That you shall be permitted to go marry any man that you wish, the words <b><i>ditihevyin</i></b> and <b><i>dititzviyin</i></b> must include <b>three</b> instances of the letter <b><i>yod</i></b> in a row in each word, <b>as</b> with only two instances of the letter <i>yod</i> these words <b>indicate:</b> That <b>they shall be [<i>tehevyan</i>], and:</b> That <b>they wish [<i>titzviyan</i>],</b> referring to other women. <b>And he should extend the <i>vav</i> of <i>teirukhin</i> and the <i>vav</i> of <i>shevukin</i>, as</b> otherwise, the <i>vav</i> may be mistaken for a <i>yod</i>, and those words spelled with a <i>yod</i> <b>indicate divorced [<i>terikhin</i>] and left [<i>shevikin</i>]</b> women. In other words, it will change the meaning from describing the document as one that divorces or sends away to describing the women as divorced and sent away.

### Part 13
<b>And</b> in the clause: And now [<i>ukhedu</i>] I have dismissed and ousted and divorced you, <b>he should extend the <i>vav</i> of <i>khedu</i>, as</b> other-wise, the <i>vav</i> may be mistaken for a <i>yod</i>, and spelled with a <i>yod</i> it <b>indicates: And with nothing [<i>ukhedi</i>]. And</b> in the expression: To go marry [<i>lehitnasseva</i>] <b>he should not write <i>le’itnasseva</i></b> with an <i>alef</i> and a <i>yod</i>, <b>as,</b> if he leaves space between the letters it will <b>indicate: Will not get married [<i>la yitnasseva</i>]. Rather,</b> he should write <b><i>lehitnasseva</i>,</b> with a <i>heh</i> and without a <i>yod</i>, so there will be no room for this error.

### Part 14
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before them: Do we need</b> to write: <b>And this</b> that you shall have from me is a scroll of divorce, and a letter of leave, and a bill of dismissal to go to marry any man that you wish, <b>or do we not need</b> to write the clause beginning with the words: <b>And this?</b> Is the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda or the Rabbis?

### Part 15
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution, <b>as Rava instituted</b> the following wording <b>in bills of divorce:</b> We saw <b>how so-and-so, son of so-and-so, dismissed and divorced so-and-so, his wife, who was his wife from beforehand, from this day and forever. But he did not state</b> the clause beginning with the words: <b>And this.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara challenges this solution: <b>And according to your reasoning, did</b> Rava <b>state all</b> of the other necessary clauses of a bill of divorce? <b>Rather, we need</b> to write them even though they were not mentioned explicitly in Rava’s formulation. <b>Here too, we need</b> to write the clause beginning with the words: And this, even though it was not mentioned specifically by Rava.

### Part 17
§ The Gemara analyzes the wording instituted by Rava: The expression: <b>From this day,</b> is written <b>to the exclusion of</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei, who said: The date</b> written <b>in a document proves</b> when <b>it</b> takes effect, and therefore it is not necessary to write the expression: From this day. Rava added this expression to take the opposite opinion into account.

### Part 18
The expression: <b>And forever,</b>
