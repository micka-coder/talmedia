it is <b>valid.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>holds</b> that <b>two</b> people <b>who brought a bill of divorce from a country overseas are not required to say: It was written in our presence and it was signed in our presence.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda: <b>If that is so,</b> if the mishna is referring specifically to a case where the document was not produced by both of them, consider <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna, <b>which teaches:</b> If <b>two</b> people <b>say: It was written in our presence, and one</b> person <b>says: It was signed in my presence,</b> it is <b>invalid, and Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> it <b>valid.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> this document is invalid is specifically due to the fact <b>that the bill of divorce was not produced by both of them,</b> but if the <b>bill of divorce was produced by both of them would the Rabbis deem</b> it <b>valid?</b> Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Yes,</b> the Rabbis would deem this bill of divorce valid.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in a case <b>where the bill of divorce was not produced by both of them, with regard to what</b> underlying principle <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara explains: One <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds:</b> The Sages <b>decree</b> that it is invalid <b>lest</b> people <b>will come to confuse</b> this case <b>with the typical</b> situation of <b>ratification of</b> legal <b>documents.</b> In other words, they will think it is possible to ratify other documents by the testimony <b>of one witness. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that the Sages <b>do not decree</b> that it is invalid for this reason.

### Part 5
<b>Some say another version</b> of this discussion: <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even a bill of divorce produced by both of them is invalid.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>holds</b> that if <b>two</b> people <b>brought a bill of divorce from a country overseas they are required to say: It was written in our presence and it was signed in our presence.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Abaye said to him: If that is so,</b> consider <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna, <b>which teaches:</b> If <b>two</b> people <b>say: It was written in our presence, and one</b> person <b>says: It was signed in my presence,</b> then the document is <b>invalid. And Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> it <b>valid.</b> Is it true to say that <b>even</b> when <b>the bill of divorce was produced by both of them the Rabbis deem</b> it <b>invalid?</b> Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda <b>said to him: Yes.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: One <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that the reason for the declaration: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, is <b>because</b> the people who live overseas <b>are not experts</b> in writing a bill of divorce <b>for her sake.</b> Consequently, it is necessary for them to testify about both the writing and the signing for her sake, in accordance with the rabbinic decree, even when two people bring the bill of divorce. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that the reason for the declaration is <b>because there are no witnesses available to ratify it,</b> and when two people bring a bill of divorce there are people available to ratify it, and therefore the declaration is unnecessary.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>shall we say</b> that the disagreement <b>of Rabba and Rava</b> with regard to the two reasons for the declaration <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> as <b>Rava resolves</b> this issue and explains it <b>in accordance with the first version,</b> that the Rabbis agree that two people who bring a bill of divorce are not required to say: It was written in our presence and it was signed in our presence. Consequently, it is possible that both opinions concur that an agent is required to say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, so that witnesses will be available to ratify it.

### Part 9
<b>And Rabba</b> could have <b>said to you,</b> in accordance with the second formulation of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, i.e., two people who bring a bill of divorce are also required to say: It was written in our presence and it was signed in our presence, <b>that everyone</b> agrees that <b>we require</b> them to issue the declaration because people are not experts in the <i>halakha</i> that it must be written <b>for her sake. And with what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with the period <b>after they learned</b> to write a bill of divorce for her sake even overseas.

### Part 10
<b>And they disagree with regard to</b> whether there is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> that the bill of divorce is invalid <b>lest the matter return to its corrupt state,</b> i.e., the residents overseas will forget that a bill of divorce must be written for the woman’s sake. <b>As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds:</b> The Sages <b>decree</b> that it is invalid for this reason, and therefore the declaration is still required even after they learned. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds:</b> The Sages <b>do not decree</b> that it is invalid lest they forget the <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let Rabbi Yehuda disagree also with regard to the first clause</b> of the mishna, concerning the case where one agent says: It was written in my presence, and the other agent says: It was signed in my presence. Why does he disagree only about a case where two say that the document was written in their presence? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda disagrees even with regard to the first clause, as <b>it was</b> already <b>stated with regard to</b> the mishna that <b>Ulla said: Rabbi Yehuda was in disagreement even with regard to the first clause.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Oshaya raises an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Ulla</b> from the following <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:2): <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the bill of divorce <b>valid in this</b> case <b>but not in another</b> case. <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that this serves <b>to exclude</b> a case where <b>one says: It was written in my presence, and one says: It was signed in my presence?</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> this serves <b>to exclude</b> a case where only one witness testified: <b>It was signed in my presence but it was not written in my presence.</b> The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary to exclude this case? It might <b>enter your mind to say: Since Rabbi Yehuda did not issue</b> a rabbinic <b>decree</b> that it is invalid <b>lest the matter return to its corrupt state, perhaps he also did not decree</b> that it is invalid lest people <b>will come to confuse</b> this case <b>with the typical</b> situation of <b>ratification of</b> legal <b>documents,</b> which cannot be performed <b>with one witness.</b> Consequently, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that although Rabbi Yehuda is not concerned about people forgetting the <i>halakha</i> and therefore holds that there is no longer any reason to be worried about the document not being written for her sake <i>ab initio</i>, nevertheless he is still concerned that a bill of divorce might be confused with other legal documents.

### Part 14
<b>It was also stated,</b> similar to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, but in the name of a different <i>amora</i>, that <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>two</b> people <b>who brought a bill of divorce from a country overseas, we have arrived at the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 15
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana was weak,</b> and <b>Rav Yehuda and Rabba entered to</b> visit <b>him</b> and <b>to inquire</b> about <b>his</b> well-being. While they were there, <b>they raised a dilemma before him:</b> With regard to <b>two</b> people <b>who brought a bill of divorce from a country overseas, are they required to say: It was written in our presence and it was signed in our presence, or are they not required</b> to issue this declaration? <b>He said to them: They are not required</b> to say it, for the following reason: <b>What if they said: She was divorced in our presence, wouldn’t they be deemed credible?</b> Therefore, they do not have to state the declaration. <b>In the meantime,</b> while they were sitting there, <b>in came a certain</b>
