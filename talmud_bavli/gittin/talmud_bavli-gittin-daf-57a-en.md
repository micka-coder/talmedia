### Part 1
<b>That which he decreed against himself,</b> as he undergoes the following: <b>Every day his ashes are gathered, and they judge him, and they burn him, and they scatter him over the seven seas.</b>

### Part 2
Onkelos then <b>went and raised Balaam</b> from the grave <b>through necromancy. He said to him: Who is</b> most <b>important in that world</b> where you are now? Balaam <b>said to him: The Jewish people.</b> Onkelos asked him: <b>Should I</b> then <b>attach</b> myself <b>to them</b> here in this world? Balaam <b>said to him: You shall not seek their peace or their welfare all the days</b> (see Deuteronomy 23:7). Onkelos <b>said to him: What is the punishment of that man,</b> a euphemism for Balaam himself, in the next world? Balaam <b>said to him:</b> He is cooked <b>in boiling semen,</b> as he caused Israel to engage in licentious behavior with the daughters of Moab.

### Part 3
Onkelos then <b>went</b> and <b>raised Jesus the Nazarene</b> from the grave <b>through necromancy.</b> Onkelos <b>said to him: Who is</b> most <b>important in that world</b> where you are now? Jesus <b>said to him: The Jewish people.</b> Onkelos asked him: <b>Should I</b> then <b>attach</b> myself <b>to them</b> in this world? Jesus <b>said to him: Their welfare you shall seek, their misfortune you shall not seek,</b> for <b>anyone who touches them is</b> regarded <b>as if he were touching the apple of his eye</b> (see Zechariah 2:12).

### Part 4
Onkelos <b>said to him: What is the punishment of that man,</b> a euphemism for Jesus himself, in the next world? Jesus <b>said to him:</b> He is punished <b>with boiling excrement. As the Master said: Anyone who mocks the words of the Sages will be sentenced to boiling excrement.</b> And this was his sin, as he mocked the words of the Sages. The Gemara comments: <b>Come</b> and <b>see the difference between the sinners of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world.</b> As Balaam, who was a prophet, wished Israel harm, whereas Jesus the Nazarene, who was a Jewish sinner, sought their well-being.

### Part 5
To conclude the story of Kamtza and bar Kamtza and the destruction of Jerusalem, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i>. It <b>is taught: Rabbi Elazar says: Come and see how great is the power of shame, for the Holy One, Blessed be He, assisted bar Kamtza,</b> who had been humiliated, <b>and</b> due to this humiliation and shame <b>He destroyed His Temple and burned His Sanctuary.</b>

### Part 6
§ It was previously mentioned (55b) that the place known as <b>the King’s Mountain [<i>Tur Malka</i>] was destroyed on account of a rooster and a hen.</b> The details of what happened are as follows: <b>It was customary</b> in that place <b>that when they would lead a bride and groom</b> to their wedding, <b>they would take out a rooster and a hen before them,</b> as if <b>to say</b> in the manner of a good omen: <b>Be fruitful and multiply like chickens.</b>

### Part 7
<b>One day a troop [<i>gunda</i>] of Roman</b> soldiers <b>passed by</b> there while a wedding was taking place <b>and took</b> the rooster and hen <b>from them.</b> The residents of the city <b>fell upon them and beat them.</b> The soldiers <b>came and said to the emperor: The Jews have rebelled against you.</b> The emperor then <b>came against them</b> in war. Among the residents of the King’s Mountain <b>there was a certain man</b> named <b>bar Deroma who could jump</b> the distance of <b>a <i>mil</i>, and he killed</b> many of the Romans, who were powerless to stand up against him. <b>The emperor</b> then <b>took his crown and set it on the ground</b> as a sign of mourning. <b>He said: Master of the Universe, if it is pleasing to You, do not give over that man,</b> a euphemism for himself, <b>and his kingdom into the hands of</b> only <b>one man.</b>

### Part 8
In the end it was the words issuing from <b>his</b> own <b>mouth</b> that <b>caused bar Deroma to stumble, as he uttered</b> this verse in complaint against God: <b>“Have You not rejected us, O God, so that You go not forth, O God, with our hosts?”</b> (Psalms 60:12). The Gemara asks: But did not <b>David also say this?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>David uttered</b> these words <b>as a question,</b> wondering whether they were true, whereas bar Deroma pronounced them as a statement of fact.

### Part 9
The Gemara recounts what happened to bar Deroma: <b>He entered an outhouse, a snake came</b> and <b>eviscerated him, and he died.</b> The emperor <b>said: Since a miracle was performed for me,</b> as I had no part in bar Deroma’s death, <b>I will let</b> the rest of the people <b>be this time</b> and take no further action against them. <b>He let them be and went</b> on his way. <b>They leapt</b> about, <b>ate, drank, and lit</b> so many <b>candles</b> in celebration <b>that the image [<i>bilyona</i>]</b> imprinted <b>on a seal [<i>gushpanka</i>] was visible from a distance of a <i>mil</i>.</b> The emperor then <b>said: The Jews are rejoicing over me.</b> So <b>he went back</b> and <b>came against them.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rav Asi says: Three hundred thousand men with drawn swords entered the King’s Mountain and massacred</b> its inhabitants <b>for three days and three nights. And</b> at the same time <b>on</b> the other <b>side</b> of the mountain, <b>weddings and</b> other <b>festivities</b> continued to be celebrated, <b>and they did not know about each other,</b> owing to the enormous size of the place.

### Part 11
§ Concerning the verse: <b>“The Lord has swallowed up without pity all the habitations of Jacob”</b> (Lamentations 2:2), it is related that <b>when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This</b> is referring to the <b>six hundred thousand cities</b> that <b>King Yannai had in the King’s Mountain.</b> As <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says: King Yannai had six hundred thousand cities in the King’s Mountain, and each of them</b> had a population as great <b>as</b> the number of <b>those who left Egypt, except for three</b> of those cities, the population of which <b>was double</b> the number of <b>those who left Egypt.</b>

### Part 12
<b>These</b> are <b>those</b> three cities: <b>Kefar Bish, Kefar Shiḥalayim, and Kefar Dikhrayya.</b> The Gemara explains the meaning of these place-names. <b>Kefar Bish,</b> Evil Town, was called by that name because its inhabitants <b>would not open</b> their <b>houses to guests. Kefar Shiḥalayim</b> was referred to by that name because <b>their livelihood was</b> derived <b>from</b> the cultivation of <b>cress [<i>shaḥalayim</i>].</b> As for <b>Kefar Dikhrayya,</b> Town of Males, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Their women would first give birth to boys, and afterward give birth to girls, and</b> then <b>they would stop</b> having children.

### Part 13
<b>Ulla said: I myself saw that place, and it could not hold even six hundred thousand reeds,</b> all the more so that number of people. <b>A certain heretic said to Rabbi Ḥanina: You lie</b> with your exorbitant exaggerations. Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to him: With regard to</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>it is written: Land of the deer</b> (see Jeremiah 3:19). <b>Just as the skin of a deer cannot hold its flesh,</b> for after the animal is skinned, its hide shrinks, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>Eretz Yisrael, when it is settled, it expands, but when it is not settled, it contracts.</b> This explains how a place that is so small today could have been so highly populated prior to the Temple’s destruction.

### Part 14
§ The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Minyumi bar Ḥilkiya, Rav Ḥilkiya bar Toviya, and Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya were</b> once <b>sitting together. They said: If there is someone who has heard anything about Kefar Sekhanya of Egypt,</b> which was in that region, <b>let him relate</b> it.

### Part 15
<b>One of them began</b> the discussion <b>and said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a betrothed man and woman</b> from there <b>who were taken captive by gentiles and</b> the latter <b>married them off to each other.</b> The woman <b>said to</b> the man: <b>Please do not touch me, as I do not have a marriage contract from you,</b> and it is prohibited for us to live together without one. <b>And until</b> the day of <b>his death</b> the man <b>did not touch</b> the woman.

### Part 16
<b>And when he died</b> without having touched her, the woman <b>said to</b> the Sages: <b>Eulogize this</b> man <b>who conquered [<i>shepitpet</i>] his passion [<i>beyitzro</i>] more than Joseph. As</b> in the case of <b>Joseph it was only for a short time</b> that he had to overpower his inclination and resist Potiphar’s wife (see Genesis, chapter 39), <b>whereas this</b> man struggled with his passion <b>each and every day.</b> Furthermore, <b>Joseph</b> was <b>not in one bed</b> with Potiphar’s wife, <b>whereas this</b> man was <b>in one bed</b> with his wife. In addition, with <b>Joseph</b> the woman was <b>not his wife, whereas</b> with <b>this</b> man she was <b>his wife,</b> as she was already betrothed to him.

### Part 17
<b>Another</b> Sage <b>began</b> his remarks <b>and said: It once happened that</b> the market price of <b>forty <i>se’a</i></b> of grain <b>stood at one dinar.</b> And then <b>the rate went down one <i>se’a</i> [<i>modeya</i>],</b> so that only thirty-nine <i>se’a</i> were sold for a dinar. <b>And they checked</b> to see what sin had caused this, <b>and they found a father and son who had engaged in sexual intercourse with a betrothed young woman on Yom Kippur. They brought</b> the offenders <b>to court and stoned them, and the rate returned to its</b> former <b>level.</b>

### Part 18
Yet <b>another</b> Sage <b>began</b> his remarks <b>and said:</b> There was <b>an incident</b> there <b>involving a man who set his eyes upon his wife to divorce her, but her marriage contract was large</b> and he wished to avoid having to pay it. <b>What did he do? He went and invited his friends, gave them food and drink, made them drunk, and lay</b> his friends and his wife <b>in one bed. He</b> then <b>brought the white of an egg,</b> which has the appearance of semen, <b>and placed it</b> on the sheet <b>between them. He</b> then <b>stood witnesses over them</b> so that they could offer testimony, <b>and went to court</b> claiming that his wife had committed adultery.

### Part 19
<b>A certain Elder of the disciples of Shammai the Elder was there, and Bava ben Buta</b> was <b>his name. He said to them: This is</b> the tradition that <b>I received from Shammai the Elder: Egg white</b> on a bedsheet <b>contracts</b> and hardens when heated <b>by fire, whereas semen is absorbed</b> into the sheet <b>by the fire. They checked</b> the matter <b>and found in accordance with his statement</b> that the substance on the sheet was not semen but egg white. <b>They</b> then <b>brought</b> the husband <b>to court, administered lashes to him, and made him pay</b> his wife’s <b>marriage contract</b> in full.

### Part 20
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: But since</b> those in the city <b>were so righteous, what is the reason that they were punished</b> and destroyed? Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>because they did not mourn for Jerusalem, as it is written: “Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you that love her, rejoice with joy with her, all you that did mourn for her”</b> (Isaiah 66:10). The verse teaches that one who mourns for Jerusalem will rejoice in its rebuilding, and one who fails to mourn for Jerusalem is destroyed.

### Part 21
§ It was stated earlier that the city of <b>Beitar was destroyed on account of a shaft from a carriage.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>it was customary</b> in Beitar that <b>when a boy was born they would plant a cedar</b> tree and when <b>a girl</b> was born they <b>would plant a cypress [<i>tornita</i>]. And when they would</b> later <b>marry</b> each other <b>they would cut</b> down these trees <b>and construct</b> a wedding <b>canopy</b> for them with their branches. <b>One day the emperor’s daughter passed by</b> there and <b>the shaft of the carriage</b> in which she was riding <b>broke.</b> Her attendants <b>chopped down a cedar</b> from among those trees <b>and brought it to her.</b> Owing to the importance that they attached to their custom, the residents of Beitar <b>came</b> and <b>fell upon them and beat them.</b> The attendants <b>came</b> and <b>said to the emperor: The Jews have rebelled against you.</b> The emperor then <b>came against them</b> in war.

### Part 22
It was in connection with the war that ensued that the Sages expounded the following verse: <b>“He has cut off in His fierce anger all the horn of Israel”</b> (Lamentations 2:3). <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: These are the eighty thousand</b> officers bearing <b>battle trumpets</b> in their hands, <b>who entered the city of Beitar when</b> the enemy <b>took it and killed men, women, and children until their blood flowed into the Great Sea. Lest you say</b> that the city <b>was close</b> to the sea, know that <b>it was a <i>mil</i> away.</b>

### Part 23
<b>It is</b> similarly <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: There are two rivers in the Yadayim Valley</b> in that region, <b>one flowing one way and one flowing the other way. And the Sages estimated</b> that in the aftermath of this war these rivers were filled with <b>two parts water to one part blood.</b> Likewise, <b>it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: For seven years the gentiles harvested their vineyards</b> that had been soaked <b>with the blood of Israel without</b> requiring any additional <b>fertilizer.</b>
