### Part 1
<b>or</b> if a man said <b>to three</b> people: <b>Write a bill of divorce and give</b> it <b>to my wife, these</b> people <b>should write</b> the document themselves <b>and give</b> it to her. If <b>he said to three</b> people: <b>Give a bill of divorce to my wife, these</b> people <b>should tell others, and</b> those others <b>will write</b> the document, <b>because he designated</b> the three people as <b>a court.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And</b> it is <b>that <i>halakha</i></b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina of Ono brought up from prison</b> in the name of Rabbi Akiva, who was incarcerated there: <b>I received</b> a tradition from my teachers that <b>in</b> a case where a man <b>says to three</b> people: <b>Give a bill of divorce to my wife, that these</b> people <b>should tell others and</b> those others <b>will write</b> the document, <b>because he designated</b> the three people as <b>a court.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yosei said: We said [<i>nomeinu</i>] to the agent,</b> Rabbi Ḥanina of Ono: <b>We too received</b> a tradition. However, it is a different one, <b>that even</b> if a man <b>said to the High Court [Sanhedrin] in Jerusalem: Give a bill of divorce to my wife, that</b> the members of the court <b>should learn</b> to write, <b>and should write</b> the document themselves, <b>and give</b> it to his wife.

### Part 4
If a man <b>said to ten</b> people: <b>Write and give a bill of divorce to my wife, one</b> of the ten <b>writes</b> the bill of divorce <b>and two sign</b> it. If he said: <b>All of you write</b> the document, <b>one of them writes</b> the bill of divorce <b>and all of them sign</b> it. <b>Therefore, if one of them died,</b> then <b>this is a bill of divorce</b> that is <b>null and void,</b> as he directed all of them to participate in the process.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says:</b> After Rav’s death, <b>they sent</b> a question <b>from the study hall of Rav to Shmuel: Let our teacher teach us:</b> In a case where a man <b>said to two</b> people: <b>Write and give a bill of divorce to my wife, and they told the scribe and he wrote</b> the bill of divorce <b>and they signed</b> it, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>He sent</b> this response <b>to them:</b> If the woman remarried on the basis of this bill of divorce, she <b>should leave</b> her second husband, <b>and the matter requires study.</b> It is necessary to clarify the <i>halakha</i>, as there is fundamental uncertainty with regard to this matter.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>The matter requires study?</b> What aspect of this question requires study? <b>If we say</b> that the uncertainty arises <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that these are</b> verbal <b>directives,</b> as the husband merely gave them instructions and did not hand them anything tangible, <b>and</b> Shmuel <b>is uncertain whether</b> verbal <b>directives,</b> instructions given to one agent, <b>are transferred to</b> another <b>agent</b> or <b>whether</b> verbal directives <b>are not transferred to</b> another <b>agents;</b> this leads to the question of whether the agents designated by the husband to write the bill of divorce can designate the scribe to write it. That cannot be the question.

### Part 7
The Gemara explains why not: <b>But didn’t Shmuel say</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who <b>said:</b> Verbal <b>directives cannot be delegated to an agent,</b> i.e., an agent cannot be deputized to give instructions on behalf of another. Shmuel was not uncertain concerning this issue.

### Part 8
<b>Rather, this is the dilemma</b> that <b>Shmuel is raising:</b> When the man told the two people: <b>Write</b> the bill of divorce, the question is <b>whether</b> he was referring to <b>their signatures,</b> in which case they could designate the scribe to write the document, <b>or whether he was referring to writing</b> the text of <b>the bill of divorce,</b> in which case it would be incumbent upon them alone to write and sign the document.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> Shmuel <b>resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from the mishna:</b> If a man <b>said to two</b> people: <b>Give a bill of divorce to my wife, or</b> if a man said <b>to three</b> people: <b>Write a bill of divorce and give</b> it <b>to my wife, these</b> people <b>should write</b> the document themselves <b>and give</b> it to her. Apparently, they must write the bill of divorce themselves.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: The proper interpretation of <b>the</b> mishna <b>itself is the dilemma</b> that Shmuel <b>is raising:</b> When the man told the two people: <b>Write</b> the bill of divorce, was he referring to <b>their signatures, or</b> was he referring to <b>writing</b> the text of <b>the bill of divorce?</b> The Gemara explains: It <b>is obvious that it is</b> referring to the <b>writing of the bill of divorce, as it is taught in the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: We said to the agent,</b> Rabbi Ḥanina of Ono: <b>We too received</b> a tradition; <b>that even</b> if a man <b>said to the High Court in Jerusalem: Give a bill of divorce to my wife, that</b> the members of the court <b>should learn</b> to write, <b>and should write</b> the document themselves, <b>and give</b> it to his wife.

### Part 11
<b>Granted, if you say it</b> means the <b>writing of the bill of divorce,</b> that they must write the actual bill of divorce, this works out <b>well,</b> as a certain degree of expertise is necessary in order to write a bill of divorce correctly. <b>However, if you say</b> that <b>it</b> means <b>their signatures, is there a court whose</b> members <b>do not know</b> how <b>to sign their signatures?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Yes, there is a new court,</b> whose members have not yet learned to sign a unique signature that will be recognizable to the public.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But if we hold that this</b> instruction: <b>Write</b> the bill of divorce, <b>is</b> a reference to <b>their signatures, is</b> the <b>writing of the bill of divorce</b> by a scribe <b>valid? But didn’t Shmuel say</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who <b>says:</b> Verbal <b>directives cannot be delegated to an agent.</b>

### Part 13
The Sages <b>say</b> in response that <b>if we hold</b> that the phrase: <b>Write</b> the bill of divorce, <b>is</b> a reference to <b>their signatures,</b> the <b>writing of the bill of divorce becomes as</b> one who <b>says</b> to those agents: <b>Tell</b> another to write it. <b>And Rabbi Yosei concedes in</b> the case of <b>one who says: Tell</b> another to write it, that the agent can designate another to write the document. The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yosei concede in</b> the case of <b>one who says: Tell</b> another to write it? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (87b): If a bill of divorce has <b>the writing of a scribe,</b> and the scribe identifies his handwriting, <b>and</b> one <b>witness</b> verifies his signature, it is <b>valid</b> as though two witnesses testified to ratify their signatures. <b>And Rabbi Yirmeya said: We learned</b> in the mishna that this is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the scribe’s signature</b> and not the scribe’s writing.

### Part 14
<b>And Rav Ḥisda said: Whose</b> opinion is expressed in the <b>mishna? It is</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who <b>said:</b> Verbal <b>directives cannot be delegated to an agent,</b> and there is no concern that the scribe signed the document without the husband instructing him to do so.

### Part 15
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>Rabbi Yosei concedes in</b> the case of one who <b>says: Tell</b> another to write it, <b>a pitfall will result from it. As sometimes,</b> it happens <b>that one said to two</b> people:
