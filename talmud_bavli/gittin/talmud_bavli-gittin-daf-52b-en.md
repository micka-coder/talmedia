### Part 1
<b>as</b> the sellers <b>will come to say to them: Your wheat was burned in the upper story</b> of my house, and you have lost everything. If a fire breaks out, the sellers will not attempt to save the produce because they already received payment for it and it now belongs to the orphans.

### Part 2
If buyers <b>gave the orphans money for</b> the purchase of <b>produce,</b> but did not yet physically transfer it into their possession, and afterward the produce <b>increased in value,</b> then one applies the principle that <b>the power of an ordinary person should not be greater than</b> that of the <b>Temple</b> treasury, and therefore the orphans can renege on the sale, as a valid act of acquisition had not yet been performed. If the produce <b>decreased in value,</b> and the orphans wish to uphold the sale, the students <b>understood from here</b> that <b>this is</b> subject to what <b>Rav Ḥanilai bar Idi</b> said, that transactions involving orphans are finalized with the transfer of money, and therefore the orphans should acquire the produce at the lower price.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said to them: This would be bad for</b> the orphans were they treated this way, <b>as</b> there may be <b>times that</b> the orphans <b>need money and no one will give</b> it <b>to them before they</b> actually <b>give them the produce.</b> Consequently, it is preferable for them to be treated like other sellers, who finalize their sales only once the merchandise is pulled by the buyers.

### Part 4
§ <b>Rav Ashi said: Rav Kahana and I signed a deed</b> of sale <b>for the mother of Ze’eira the orphan, who,</b> as the child’s steward, <b>sold land without</b> first making a public <b>announcement in order to</b> pay the <b>head tax [<i>karga</i>].</b> It was permitted for her to act in this manner due to <b>what</b> the Sages <b>of Neharde’a said:</b> When an orphan’s property is sold, a public announcement of the sale is first made in order to ensure that the seller will receive the highest price. But when the property is sold to raise money <b>for</b> the payment of the <b>head tax, or</b> to provide <b>for sustenance</b> for orphans, <b>or</b> to pay <b>for burial</b> of the deceased, the money is needed immediately, so the property <b>may be sold</b> even <b>without</b> a public <b>announcement.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara relates: <b>Amram the dyer was a steward for orphans,</b> and the orphans’ <b>relatives</b> once <b>came before Rav Naḥman</b> and <b>said to him: He dresses and covers</b> himself with clothing purchased <b>from</b> the property of <b>the orphans.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to them:</b> Perhaps he does this <b>in order that his words be heard,</b> meaning that he dresses himself in finery at the orphans’ expense in order to better manage their property, as he will be ignored if he appears to be a poor person.

### Part 6
They said to him: <b>He eats and drinks</b> lavishly <b>from</b> the orphan’s property <b>and is not</b> known to be <b>rich</b> enough to be able to afford such large expenditures from his own money. Rav Naḥman said to them: <b>Say</b> that perhaps <b>he found a lost item,</b> with the help of which he can allow himself to maintain a high standard of living. They said to him: <b>But he is damaging</b> the orphans’ property and thereby causing them financial loss. Rav Naḥman <b>said to them: Bring me witnesses that he is damaging</b> their property <b>and I will remove him</b> from his stewardship, <b>as our colleague Rav Huna said in the name of Rav</b> that in the case of <b>a steward who damages</b> the property of the orphans, the court <b>removes him. As it was stated:</b> With regard to <b>a steward who damages</b> orphans’ property, <b>Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav says:</b> The court removes him. <b>In the school of Rabbi Sheila they say:</b> The court <b>does not remove him.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that the court <b>removes him.</b>

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>a steward who was appointed by the orphans’ father,</b> when he returns all of the property to the orphans upon their reaching adulthood, <b>he takes an oath</b> that he took nothing of theirs for himself. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>If</b> the steward <b>had not received</b> some <b>benefit from</b> the father during his life, <b>he would not have</b> agreed to <b>become a steward</b> for his children. <b>And he will not come to avoid</b> becoming a steward merely <b>because of an oath</b> that the court will impose upon him some time in the future

### Part 8
The mishna then teaches: By contrast, if <b>the court appointed him</b> to serve as a steward for them, then <b>he is not</b> required to <b>take</b> such <b>an oath.</b> The Gemara explains: The reason for this is that <b>it is merely a favor that</b> the steward <b>does for the court,</b> as he derives no benefit from accepting the position. <b>And if you</b> also <b>cast</b> an obligation upon him to take <b>an oath, he will come to avoid</b> becoming a steward, and the orphans will suffer a loss, as people will not be willing to administer their affairs.

### Part 9
The mishna then teaches: <b>Abba Shaul says: The matters are reversed;</b> it is not a steward appointed by the orphans’ father but a steward appointed by the court who takes an oath. The Gemara clarifies Abba Shaul’s opinion: <b>What is the reason</b> that if <b>the court appointed</b> the steward, <b>he takes an oath? Since</b> he derives <b>a certain benefit</b> from his appointment, <b>that publicity is generated about him that he is a trustworthy man, as</b> is demonstrated by the fact that <b>the court relies upon him</b> and appoints him to a position of responsibility, <b>he will not come to avoid</b> becoming a steward merely <b>because of an oath</b> that the court will impose upon him.

### Part 10
By contrast, if <b>the orphans’ father appointed him</b> as a steward, he is <b>not</b> required to <b>take an oath.</b> Why so? <b>It is merely a favor that</b> these people <b>do for each other. And if you cast</b> an additional obligation upon the steward to take <b>an oath, he will come to avoid</b> accepting the position, and the orphans will suffer a loss, as people will not be willing to administer their affairs. <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Ami says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul.</b>

### Part 11
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> Both <b>this</b> one, a steward appointed by the father, <b>and that</b> one, a court-appointed steward, <b>take an oath, and the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with his statement.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Taḥalifa, from the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Abbahu:</b> In the case of <b>a steward who was appointed</b> to that position <b>by the father of the orphans, he takes an oath</b> when the orphans reach adulthood and he returns the property to them, <b>because he receives payment,</b> i.e., he derives a certain benefit from managing the orphans’ property. Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him: Did you bring a <i>kav</i> and measure</b> how much the steward earns from his efforts? <b>Rather, say</b> that he takes an oath <b>because it is as if he received payment.</b> Presumably he agreed to serve as the orphans’ steward because of a benefit that he derived from their father during his lifetime, and consequently it is as if he received payment for accepting the stewardship.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who renders</b> another’s food ritually <b>impure, or one who mixes</b> <i>teruma</i> with another’s non-sacred produce, <b>or one who pours</b> another’s wine as a libation before an idol, in each of these cases causing the other a monetary loss, if he acted <b>unintentionally,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying for the damage. If he acted <b>intentionally,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay.

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to the meaning of the word <b>pours</b> mentioned in the mishna. <b>Rav says:</b> It means that <b>he actually</b> takes the wine and <b>pours</b> it as a libation before an idol. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> It means that <b>he mixes</b> together kosher wine with wine that had been used in rites of idolatry, so that now it is prohibited to drink or derive any other benefit from the mixture.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: With regard to Shmuel, <b>the one who says</b> that it means <b>mixing, what is the reason</b> that he <b>did not say</b> that it means actually <b>pouring?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> One who has committed two or more transgressions with a single act is exempt from punishment for the less severe transgression. Consequently, one who committed an act warranting both court-imposed capital punishment and the payment of monetary compensation is put to death but is exempt from the monetary payment. Therefore, <b>one who pours</b> another’s wine as a libation before an idol <b>receives the greater</b> punishment, i.e., the death penalty for transgressing the prohibition against idol worship, but he is exempt from the less severe penalty of monetary payment for the financial loss he caused the other person.

### Part 16
<b>And the other</b> Sage, Rav, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yirmeya, as Rabbi Yirmeya says:</b> One who pours another person’s wine as a libation <b>acquires</b> it as his own <b>from the time that he lifts</b> it in order to take it for himself, as does any thief, and at that moment he becomes liable for the payment of monetary compensation. But <b>he does not become liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty for violating the prohibition against idol worship <b>until he</b> actually <b>pours</b> the wine before the idol. Consequently, the monetary penalty takes effect first, and he also becomes liable to receive the death penalty afterward in a separate act.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> Rav, <b>the one who says</b> that it means actually <b>pouring, what is the reason</b> that he <b>did not say</b> that it means <b>mixing?</b> The Gemara answers: He could have <b>said to you: Mixing</b> libation wine with kosher wine
