### Part 1
<b>And he deconsecrates</b> the second tithe that he will separate in the future, transferring its sanctity to money, <b>and</b> he may <b>drink</b> the wine <b>immediately,</b> relying on the separation that he will perform later, which will clarify retroactively which <i>log</i> he designated for the tithes and for <i>teruma</i>. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> However, <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</b> this practice, as they hold that in this case there is no retroactive clarification. It is therefore evident that according to Rabbi Yehuda, there is no retroactive clarification where one makes the clarification dependent on his own decision.

### Part 2
By contrast, in a case where one <b>makes</b> the outcome <b>dependent on the decision of others,</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>accepts</b> the principle of retroactive <b>clarification, as we learned</b> in a mishna (73a): In a case where an ill husband says to his wife: This is your bill of divorce from now if I die due to this illness, if he dies, the bill of divorce takes effect from the time of his statement. The mishna asks: <b>What</b> is the halakhic status of the wife <b>in those days</b> between when the bill of divorce was given but before the husband died?

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: She is like a married woman with regard to all of her matters,</b> and she remains forbidden to other men; <b>and when he will die, it is a bill of divorce.</b> Death is equivalent to a matter that is dependent on the decision of others. Since Rabbi Yehuda agrees that the bill of divorce takes effect retroactively, as it cannot take effect after the death of the husband, he evidently holds that there is retroactive clarification where one makes the clarification dependent on the decision of others.

### Part 4
Furthermore, <b>Rav Mesharshiyya said to Rava: But</b> isnâ€™t there <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who, in a case <b>where</b> one <b>makes</b> the outcome <b>dependent on his own decision, does not accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>clarification, but</b> when one <b>makes it dependent on the decision of others, he accepts</b> the principle of retroactive <b>clarification?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara elaborates: When one <b>makes</b> the outcome <b>dependent on his own decision,</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>does not accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>clarification.</b> This is understood from <b>that which we said</b> in the case of wine purchased from Samaritans. When <b>one makes</b> the outcome <b>dependent on the decision of others,</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>accepts</b> the principle of retroactive <b>clarification, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Kiddushin</i> 3:7): If a man said to a woman: <b>I am engaging in sexual intercourse with you</b> for the purpose of betrothal <b>on the condition that</b> my <b>father will desire</b> our betrothal, and then he married her without specification, then <b>even if the father did not desire</b> it <b>she is</b> nevertheless <b>betrothed</b> through this act of intercourse. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> If <b>the father desires</b> it, <b>she is betrothed,</b>
