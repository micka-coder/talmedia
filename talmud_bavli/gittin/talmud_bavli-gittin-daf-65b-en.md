### Part 1
However, it <b>is not a</b> valid <b>bill of divorce until you reach Mata Meḥasya.</b>

### Part 2
The mishna teaches that if the woman said to the agent: Receive my bill of divorce for me in such and such a place, <b>Rabbi Elazar prohibits</b> her from partaking of <i>teruma</i> <b>immediately.</b> The Gemara asks: That <b>is obvious, as</b> she <b>is</b> merely <b>indicating a place for him</b> to receive the bill of divorce and not stipulating that the divorce is contingent upon receipt of the document in that place.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> Rabbi Elazar’s ruling is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where she said to him: Go to the east, as</b> my husband <b>is in the east, and</b> the agent <b>went to the west. Lest you say</b> that since the husband <b>is</b> certainly <b>not in the west</b> and the agent will not find him there, the bill of divorce will certainly not take effect until later, Rabbi Elazar <b>teaches us</b> that <b>perhaps while he was going</b> west, the agent happened to <b>encounter</b> the husband, <b>and</b> the husband <b>gave the bill of divorce to</b> the agent.

### Part 4
The Gemara cites a related <i>halakha</i>. With regard to <b>one who says to his agent: Establish an <i>eiruv</i></b> of Shabbat boundaries <b>on my</b> behalf <b>with dates, and he established an <i>eiruv</i> on his</b> behalf <b>with dried figs,</b> or if said to his agent: Establish an <i>eiruv</i> on my behalf <b>with dried figs, and he established an <i>eiruv</i> on his</b> behalf <b>with dates,</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>His <i>eiruv</i> is</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>. And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>His <i>eiruv</i> is not</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabba said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, in which it is taught that it is not a valid <i>eiruv</i>, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, in which it is taught that it is a valid <i>eiruv</i>, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b> He explains: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say:</b> When one gives instructions to his agent, there is <b>insistence</b> on his part that the agent implement those instructions without deviation. Failure to do so revokes his designation as his agent. And <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who <b>says: She is</b> merely <b>indicating a place for him</b> to receive the bill of divorce and not stipulating that the divorce is contingent on receipt of the document in that place. In the <i>baraita</i> as well, he was not particular as to what food should be used to establish the <i>eiruv</i>.

### Part 6
<b>And Rav Yosef said:</b> Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who say: When one gives instructions to his agent, there is insistence on his part that the agent implement those instructions without deviation. However, not all deviations are equal. <b>Here,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> rules that it is a valid <i>eiruv</i>, the reference is to a case where the one who designated the agent instructed him to establish the joining of the courtyard <b>with his</b> dates or dried figs and the agent deviated and established the <i>eiruv</i> with the other type of fruit, but it belonged to the one issuing the instructions. <b>There,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> rules that it is not a valid <i>eiruv</i>, the reference is to a case where the one who designated the agent instructed him to establish the joining of the courtyard <b>with</b> the dates or dried figs <b>of another,</b> and the agent deviated and established the <i>eiruv</i> with the other type of fruit belonging to that other person. The <i>eiruv</i> is not valid because that other person authorized use of only a specific type of fruit.

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said</b> to Rav Yosef: <b>However, that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says to his agent: Establish a joining</b> of Shabbat boundaries <b>on my</b> behalf <b>in a tower, and he established the <i>eiruv</i> in a dovecote,</b> or he said to the agent: <b>Establish a joining</b> of Shabbat boundaries <b>on my</b> behalf <b>in a dovecote, and he established the <i>eiruv</i> in a tower,</b> it is <b>taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>His joining</b> of Shabbat boundaries <b>is</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>. And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>His joining</b> of Shabbat boundaries <b>is not</b> a valid <b><i>eiruv</i>. There, what</b> distinction between <b>his</b> fruit <b>and</b> fruit <b>of another is there?</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>There too, there is</b> a distinction between <b>fruit of the tower and fruit of the dovecote.</b> In these <i>baraitot</i> the instruction did not relate to the location of the placement of the <i>eiruv</i>; rather, the instruction was related to the location of the fruit to be used in establishing the <i>eiruv</i>. In one <i>baraita</i>, the produce in both locations belongs to the one who designated the agent; in the other <i>baraita</i>, the produce in both locations belongs to another.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to a husband <b>who says</b> to two people: <b>Write a bill of divorce and give</b> it <b>to my wife,</b> or: <b>Divorce her,</b> or: <b>Write a letter and give</b> it <b>to her, they should write</b> the document <b>and give</b> it to her. In each of those cases his intent is clear. He is instructing them to effect her divorce.

### Part 10
However, one who said: <b>Release her,</b> or: <b>Sustain her, or: Treat her according to the law [<i>nimus</i>],</b> or: <b>Treat her appropriately, said nothing,</b> as none of these expressions clearly expresses his desire to divorce his wife.

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> that if the husband said: <b>Send her,</b> or: <b>Separate her,</b> or: <b>Banish her,</b> then all of these expressions convey his will to divorce her, and consequently, <b>they should write</b> the bill of divorce <b>and give</b> it to her. However, one who said: <b>Release her [<i>patruha</i>],</b> or: <b>Sustain her,</b> or: <b>Treat her according to the law,</b> or: <b>Treat her appropriately, said nothing.</b>

### Part 12
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> If one said <b><i>patruha</i>, his statement stands,</b> and they give her a bill of divorce. However, if one said <b><i>pitruha</i>, he said nothing. Rava said: Rabbi Natan, who is a Babylonian, distinguished between <i>pitruha</i> and <i>patruha</i>.</b> <i>Pitruha</i> means exempt her, which is unrelated to divorce; <i>patruha</i> means release her, which is very much related to divorce. However, <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, <b>who is a resident of Eretz Yisrael, did not distinguish</b> between these two expressions.

### Part 13
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If the husband said: <b>Remove her, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: <b>Abandon her, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: <b>Unbind her, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: <b>Let her be, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: <b>Be useful for her, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: <b>Treat her according to the custom, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: <b>Resolve at least one</b> of these expressions, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One who said: <b>Treat her according to the custom,</b> or: <b>Treat her according to the law,</b> or: <b>Treat her appropriately, said nothing</b> and it is not a valid bill of divorce. Apparently, the expression: Treat her according to the custom, is not an unequivocal instruction to effect divorce.

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>At first</b> the Sages <b>would say:</b> In the case of <b>one who is taken out in a neck chain [<i>kolar</i>]</b> to be executed <b>and</b> who <b>said: Write a bill of divorce for my wife, these</b> people <b>should write</b> the document <b>and give</b> it to his wife even though there was no explicit instruction to give it to her. <b>They then said: Even</b> with regard <b>to one who sets sail and one who departs in a caravan</b> to a far-off place and says: Write a bill of divorce to my wife, his intention is to write the bill of divorce and give it to his wife. <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: Even</b> if <b>one who is dangerously ill</b> gives that instruction, they write the bill of divorce and give it to his wife.

### Part 16
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara relates: <b>Geneiva was</b> one who <b>went out in a neck chain</b> to be executed. <b>When he was going out, he said</b> to the people there as his dying bequest: <b>Give four hundred dinars to Rabbi Avina from wine</b> that I have in the city of <b>Nehar Panya. Rabbi Zeira said:</b>
