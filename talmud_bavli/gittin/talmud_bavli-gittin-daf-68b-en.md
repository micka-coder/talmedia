and <b>she begged him</b> not to knock down the house. <b>He bent</b> his body away <b>from her,</b> to the other side, and <b>broke one of his bones. He said: This is as it is written: “Soft speech can break a bone”</b> (Proverbs 25:15).

### Part 2
Ashmedai <b>saw a blind man who was lost on the road</b> and <b>he brought him to the</b> correct <b>road. He saw a drunk who was lost on the road</b> and <b>he brought him to the</b> correct <b>road. He saw the joy</b> of a wedding celebration <b>in which they were celebrating,</b> and <b>he cried. He heard a certain man say to a shoemaker [<i>ushkafa</i>]: Make me shoes</b> that will last <b>for seven years,</b> and <b>he laughed. He saw a certain sorcerer performing magic,</b> and <b>he laughed.</b>

### Part 3
<b>When</b> Ashmedai <b>arrived there,</b> in Jerusalem, <b>they did not bring him before Solomon until three days</b> had passed. On <b>the first day he said to them: Why doesn’t the king want me</b> to come <b>to him? They said to him:</b> He drank too much and was <b>overcome</b> by <b>drink.</b> Ashmedai <b>took a brick</b> and <b>placed</b> it <b>on</b> top of <b>another</b> brick. The servants <b>came and told Solomon</b> what he had done. Solomon interpreted the action and <b>said to them: This is what he said to you</b> through this allusion: <b>Return</b> and <b>give</b> the king more to <b>drink.</b>

### Part 4
<b>The following day</b> Ashmedai <b>said to them: And why doesn’t the king want me</b> to come <b>to him? They said to him:</b> He ate too much and was <b>overcome</b> by <b>food.</b> Ashmedai <b>took the brick off the other</b> brick and <b>placed it on the ground.</b> The servants <b>came</b> and <b>told Solomon</b> what Ashmedai had done. <b>He</b> interpreted Ashmedai’s actions and <b>said to them: This is what he said to you</b> through this allusion: <b>Take his food away from him.</b>

### Part 5
<b>At the end of three days</b> Ashmedai <b>came before</b> Solomon. Ashmedai <b>took a reed and measured four cubits [<i>garmidei</i>], and threw it before him. He said to</b> Solomon: <b>See, when that man,</b> Solomon, <b>dies, he</b> will <b>have nothing in this world except the four cubits</b> of his grave. <b>Now you have conquered the entire world and</b> yet <b>you are not satisfied until you also conquer me?</b>

### Part 6
Solomon <b>said to him: I need nothing from you. I want to build the Temple and I need the <i>shamir</i></b> for this. Ashmedai <b>said to him:</b> The <i>shamir</i> <b>was not given to me,</b> but <b>it was given to the</b> angelic <b>minister of the sea. And he gives it only to the wild rooster,</b> also known as the <i>dukhifat</i> or the hoopoe, <b>whom he trusts by</b> the force of <b>his oath</b> to return it.

### Part 7
<b>And what does</b> the wild rooster <b>do with it? He brings it to mountains that are not</b> fit for <b>habitation, and he places</b> the <i>shamir</i> <b>on the craggy rock and the mountain splits. And he takes</b> and <b>brings seeds of trees, throws them there, and it becomes</b> fit for <b>habitation. And this is why we interpret</b> the word <i>dukhifat</i> as <b>a cutter of mountains [<i>naggar tura</i>],</b> i.e., the Aramaic translation of the word <i>dukhifat</i> in the Bible is <i>naggar tura</i>, cutter of mountains.

### Part 8
<b>They investigated</b> and found <b>the nest of a wild rooster in which there were chicks, and he covered its nest with translucent glass. When</b> the rooster <b>came it wanted to enter</b> the nest <b>but was unable</b> to do so. <b>It went and brought the <i>shamir</i> and placed it on top</b> to crack the glass. Solomon’s servant <b>threw a clump</b> of dirt <b>at</b> the rooster and the rooster <b>knocked over</b> the <i>shamir</i>. The man <b>took it</b> and the wild rooster <b>went</b> and <b>strangled itself over</b> the fact that it had not kept <b>its oath,</b> by not returning the <i>shamir</i>.

### Part 9
Later, <b>Benayahu said to</b> Ashmedai: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>when you saw that blind man who was lost on the road you brought him to the</b> correct <b>road?</b> Ashmedai <b>said to him: They proclaim about him in heaven that he is a completely righteous man, and anyone who does good for his soul shall merit</b> to enter <b>the World-to-Come.</b>

### Part 10
Then Benayahu asked: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>when you saw the drunk man who was lost on the road you brought him to the</b> correct <b>road?</b> Ashmedai <b>said to him: They proclaim about him in heaven that he is a completely wicked man. And I did good for his soul so that he will consume</b> his reward in this <b>world</b> and not have any reward in the World-to-Come.

### Part 11
Benayahu continued and asked him: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>when you saw that joy</b> of the wedding <b>you cried?</b> Ashmedai <b>said to him:</b> I knew that this <b>man will die within thirty days. And</b> his wife <b>is required to wait for the <i>yavam</i>,</b> the husband’s brother, who is <b>a minor,</b> to reach the age of <b>thirteen years,</b> the age of majority, so that he can release her through <i>ḥalitza</i>, the ritual through which the <i>yavam</i> frees the <i>yevama</i> of her levirate bonds.

### Part 12
In addition, he asked: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>when you heard that man say to a shoemaker: Make me shoes</b> that will last <b>for seven years, you laughed?</b> Ashmedai <b>said to him: That</b> man <b>does not have seven days</b> to live; <b>does he need shoes</b> that will last <b>for seven years?</b>

### Part 13
Benayahu then asked: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>when you saw that sorcerer performing magic you laughed?</b> Ashmedai <b>said to him: Because he was sitting on the king’s treasury [<i>bei gaza</i>]. Let him use his magic</b> to know <b>what there is</b> buried <b>underneath him.</b>

### Part 14
Solomon <b>kept</b> Ashmedai <b>with him until</b> he completed <b>building the Temple. One day he stood</b> with Ashmedai <b>alone. He said to</b> Ashmedai: <b>It is written: “For him like the lofty horns of the wild ox”</b> (Numbers 24:8), <b>and</b> the Sages <b>say</b> in explanation of the verse: <b>“Like the lofty horns”; these are the ministering angels. “The wild ox”; these are the demons.</b> In <b>what</b> way <b>are you greater than us?</b> Why does the verse praise your abilities and powers over those of human beings?

### Part 15
Ashmedai <b>said to him: Take the chain</b> engraved with God’s name <b>off me and give me your ring</b> with God’s name engraved on it, <b>and I will show you my strength.</b> Solomon <b>took the chain off him and he gave him his ring.</b> Ashmedai <b>swallowed</b> the ring and grew until <b>he placed one wing in the heaven and one wing on the earth. He threw</b> Solomon a distance of <b>four hundred parasangs. With regard to that moment Solomon said: “What profit is there for a person through all of his toil under the sun?”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:3). With Solomon deposed from the throne, Ashmedai took his place.

### Part 16
With regard to the verse: <b>“And this was my portion from all of my toil”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:10), the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the expression: <b>“And this”?</b> This expression is always an allusion to an item that is actually in his hand or can be shown. <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree with regard to the meaning of this phrase. <b>One said:</b> This is referring to Solomon’s <b>staff</b> that remained in his hand. <b>And one said:</b> This is referring to <b>his cloak.</b> Solomon <b>circulated from door to door</b> collecting charity, and <b>wherever he arrived he would say: “I, Ecclesiastes, was king over Israel in Jerusalem”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:12). <b>When he</b> finally <b>arrived at the Sanhedrin</b> in Jerusalem <b>the sages said: Now, an imbecile does not fixate on one matter</b> all of the time, so <b>what is this</b> matter? Is this man perhaps telling the truth that he is Solomon?

### Part 17
The sages <b>said to Benayahu: Does the king require you</b> to be <b>with him?</b> Benayahu <b>said to them: No. They sent to the queens</b> and asked: Does <b>the king come</b> to be <b>with you?</b> The queens <b>sent</b> a response <b>to them: Yes, he comes. They sent</b> a request <b>to</b> the queens: <b>Check his feet</b> to see if they are human feet. The queens <b>sent</b> a response <b>to</b> the sages: <b>He</b> always <b>comes in socks [<i>bemokei</i>],</b> and it is not possible to see his feet.

### Part 18
The queens continued discussing the king’s behavior: <b>And he demands</b> of <b>them,</b> i.e., the queens, to engage in sexual inter-course <b>when they are menstruating. And he also demands</b> that <b>Bathsheba his mother</b> engage in sexual intercourse with him. Once the Sanhedrin heard this they understood that this was an imposter and not actually Solomon. <b>They brought Solomon, gave him a ring and the chain on which the name</b> of God <b>was carved. When</b> Solomon <b>entered,</b> Ashmedai <b>saw him</b> and <b>fled.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara adds: <b>And even so,</b> although Ashmedai fled, Solomon <b>was fearful of him, and this is as it is written: “Behold the bed of Solomon surrounded by sixty strong men from the warriors of Israel. All of them holding swords and trained in war, each man with his sword on his thigh from fear in the nights”</b> (Song of Songs 3:7–8).

### Part 20
<b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed with regard to this story of Solomon. <b>One said:</b> He was <b>a king and</b> afterward he became <b>a commoner,</b> and never returned to his position as king. <b>And one said:</b> He was <b>a king, and</b> became <b>a commoner, and a king,</b> as ultimately he returned to his throne and defeated Ashmedai.

### Part 21
§ The Gemara returns to the discussion concerning the different remedies with which the chapter began: As a remedy <b>for</b> a headache caused by excessive <b>blood in the head, let him bring cypress [<i>shurvina</i>], willow, fresh myrtle</b> [<b><i>asa dara</i></b>], <b>olive, poplar, sea willow, and cynodon</b> grass <b>and boil them together. And he should pour three hundred cups</b> of this liquid <b>on one side of his head and three hundred cups on this,</b> the other <b>side of his head.</b>

### Part 22
<b>And if</b> it is <b>not</b> effective or he is unable to obtain all of these ingredients then <b>let him bring a white rose [<i>varda</i>] that stands in one row,</b> meaning that it was growing alone, <b>and he should boil it. And he should pour sixty cups on this side of</b> his <b>head and sixty cups on this side of</b> his <b>head.</b>

### Part 23
As a remedy <b>for a migraine, let him bring a wild rooster and slaughter it using a silver dinar,</b> so that the blood flows <b>over the side</b> of his head <b>that hurts him. And he should be careful of its blood</b> so <b>as not to blind his eye. And he should hang it on the doorpost</b> of his house, <b>so that when he enters he rubs against it and when he exits he rubs against it.</b>
