### Part 1
<b>she is</b> considered to be <b>divorced</b> and may remarry. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The <b>rumor</b> came <b>with its receipt.</b> The rumor that she is betrothed is canceled by the rumor that she is divorced.

### Part 2
§ <b>Rava said:</b> If <b>a rumor circulated in the city</b> that a woman <b>engaged in licentious sexual intercourse, we are not concerned</b> that the rumor is true with regard to her eligibility to marry a priest. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is assumed that people <b>saw her</b> engage in <b>merely licentious behavior,</b> in a manner that does not disqualify her from marrying a priest.

### Part 3
This statement is <b>parallel to</b> one side of a dispute among the <b><i>tanna’im</i>:</b> If a woman <b>ate in the marketplace, walked with her neck stretched forward</b> in an arrogant manner <b>in the marketplace,</b> or <b>nursed in the marketplace, with regard to all of</b> these cases <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that <b>she must leave</b> her husband, since all of these behaviors are considered licentious behavior. <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that she must leave him only <b>once the women who spin [<i>mozerot</i>] by the moonlight converse about her</b> having engaged in promiscuous sexual intercourse, as this indicates that the matter is well known and accepted as fact.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri said to him: If so, you have not allowed</b> any <b>daughter of Abraham our forefather to remain with her husband,</b> i.e., all wives will be forced to leave their husbands, as it is common for women to slander their peers. <b>And the Torah said: “Because he has found some unseemly matter in her,</b> and he writes her a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and it says over there: “At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, a matter shall be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15). <b>Just as there,</b> the word “matter” is referring to <b>a clear matter,</b> as it is established through witnesses, <b>so too here,</b> the unseemly matter that is considered a cause for divorce is also referring to <b>a clear matter</b> that was not established merely through a rumor. Rava’s statement is in accordance with this opinion.

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If a rumor circulated that a certain unmarried woman is <b>a non-virgin, one is not concerned about it,</b> and she may marry a High Priest. If a rumor circulated that she is <b>a married woman, one is not concerned about it.</b> If a rumor circulated that she is <b>a betrothed woman, one is not concerned about it.</b> If a rumor circulated that she is betrothed, but <b>not to so-and-so,</b> i.e., the man who betrothed her is not specified, <b>one is not concerned about it.</b> If a rumor circulated that she was betrothed <b>in another city, one is not concerned about it.</b>

### Part 6
If a rumor circulated that she is <b>a daughter born from an incestuous or adulterous relationship [<i>mamzeret</i>], one is not concerned about it.</b> If a rumor circulated that she is <b>a maidservant, one is not concerned about it.</b>

### Part 7
Similarly, if a rumor circulated that <b>so-and-so consecrated his property,</b> or that <b>so-and-so renounced ownership of his property, we are not concerned about these</b> rumors, and his property cannot be taken away by the Temple treasury or another person.

### Part 8
§ <b>Ulla says:</b> The rumor mentioned in the mishna with regard to betrothal is <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> people only <b>heard an echo. Rather,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> there is circumstantial evidence, as <b>there are candles lit and beds made</b> in the woman’s house, as was the custom for brides, <b>and people entering and leaving and saying</b> that <b>so-and-so is becoming betrothed today.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: If people merely are saying that she is <b>becoming betrothed,</b> what is the reason for concern? <b>Perhaps she was not betrothed</b> in the end. Rather, <b>say</b> that people are saying that <b>so-and-so was betrothed today.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And similarly, Levi taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: The mishna is <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> people only <b>hear an echo. Rather,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where candles are lit and beds are made, and women are spinning by candlelight and rejoicing for her and saying</b> that <b>so-and-so is becoming betrothed today.</b> The Gemara asks: If they are merely saying that she is <b>becoming betrothed,</b> what is the reason for concern? <b>Perhaps she was not betrothed</b> in the end. <b>Rav Pappa said: Say</b> that they are saying that <b>so-and-so was betrothed today.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The mishna is <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> people only <b>heard an echo. Rather,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where there are candles lit and beds made and people entering and leaving.</b> If <b>they made</b> an explicit <b>statement</b> that the woman was betrothed, <b>this is a rumor</b> that renders her betrothed. If <b>they did not make</b> such <b>a statement, this is</b> the <b>explanation</b> mentioned in the mishna.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: If <b>they did not make</b> such <b>a statement,</b> why is it considered an explanation? <b>But they did not say anything</b> that requires an explanation. The Gemara answers that Rabbi Yoḥanan did not mean that the people did not say anything, but rather that they did not state unequivocally that the woman is betrothed, <b>to the exclusion of that which Rabba bar Rav Huna said: The explanation mentioned</b> in the mishna negates the rumor <b>even</b> if it circulates at some point <b>from now until ten days</b> after the rumor begins to circulate. Rabbi Yoḥanan therefore <b>teaches us</b> that only if the people <b>did not say</b> unequivocally that she is betrothed <b>is it considered an explanation</b> that negates the rumor. But if <b>they said</b> so unequivocally, any later explanation <b>is not considered an explanation</b> that negates the rumor.

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The mishna is <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> people only <b>heard an echo. Rather,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> people <b>say: From where did so-and-so hear</b> that this woman is betrothed? <b>From so-and-so, and so-and-so</b> heard it <b>from so-and-so. And</b> as a result, the judges <b>investigate</b> the rumor <b>continuously,</b> tracing the hearsay <b>until they reach a clear matter,</b> i.e., eyewitnesses.

### Part 14
The Gemara raises an objection: If the court reaches <b>a clear matter it is proper testimony,</b> not a rumor. <b>Rather, when Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda came</b> from Eretz Yisrael he taught that <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The mishna is <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> people only <b>heard an echo. Rather,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> people <b>say: From where did so-and-so hear</b> this? <b>From so-and-so, and so-and-so</b> heard it <b>from so-and-so, and they went overseas,</b> so that the court cannot investigate further.

### Part 15
§ <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Do we suppress a rumor</b> that was not substantiated by the court, <b>or do we not suppress</b> it? <b>He said to him: Since Rav Ḥisda says</b> that a rumor is not treated stringently <b>until</b> the court <b>hears</b> it <b>from valid</b> witnesses, which indicates that rumors are generally treated leniently, <b>learn from it</b> that <b>we suppress a rumor.</b>

### Part 16
Abaye <b>said to him: On the contrary, since Rav Sheshet said</b> that <b>even</b> if the court hears it <b>from women it is</b> considered a serious <b>rumor,</b> indicating that rumors are treated stringently, <b>learn from it</b> that <b>we do not suppress a rumor.</b>

### Part 17
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: These</b> opinions correspond to the local custom in two different <b>places. In Sura they suppress a rumor,</b> whereas <b>in Neharde’a they do not suppress a rumor.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara relates several incidents: <b>A rumor circulated that a certain</b> woman <b>was betrothed to a student</b> of Torah. <b>Rav Ḥama summoned her father</b> and <b>said to him: Tell me</b> exactly <b>how the incident</b> transpired. The father <b>said to him:</b> The student <b>betrothed</b> her <b>conditionally, with the intention that he would not go to</b> the city of <b>Bei Ḥozai, and he</b> subsequently <b>went</b> there, thereby nullifying the betrothal. Rav Ḥama <b>said to him: Since at the time that the rumor existed</b> this <b>explanation did not exist, it is not in your power to create the presumption of an explanation.</b> Therefore, the rumor must be treated stringently.

### Part 19
<b>A rumor circulated that a certain</b> woman <b>was betrothed with a mat of dates [<i>atzifa detoḥela</i>] from the spring of Bei Shifei. Rav Idi bar Avin sent</b> the case to be presented <b>before Abaye,</b> asking him: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in <b>a case like this?</b> Should this rumor be suppressed? Abaye <b>said to him: Even according to the one who said</b> that <b>we do not suppress a rumor, in this</b> case <b>we suppress the rumor.</b> This is because if she marries someone else people will not slander her. Rather, <b>they will say</b> that <b>the Sages investigated her betrothal,</b> i.e., the value of the mat of dates with which she was betrothed, <b>and</b> concluded that <b>it was not worth one <i>peruta</i></b> and therefore the betrothal was invalid.

### Part 20
<b>A rumor circulated that a certain</b> woman <b>was betrothed</b>
