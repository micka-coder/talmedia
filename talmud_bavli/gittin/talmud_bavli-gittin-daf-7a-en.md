### Part 1
<b>say them with calmness so that they will accept</b> instruction <b>from him. Rav Ashi said: I did not hear this</b> statement <b>of Rabba bar bar Ḥana, and</b> yet <b>I fulfilled it through</b> my own <b>reasoning.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Abbahu says: A person should never impose excessive fear upon</b> the members of <b>his household, as a great man imposed excessive fear upon his household and they fed him something</b> that carried <b>a great</b> prohibition.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And who was</b> this individual? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Would it enter your mind</b> to say that <b>they</b> actually <b>fed him</b> forbidden food? <b>Now</b> consider that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not cause an error</b> to be performed <b>through the animals of the righteous.</b> With regard to <b>the righteous themselves</b> is it <b>not all the more so?</b> How can you say that Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel ate forbidden food?

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> it means that <b>they sought to feed him something</b> that carried <b>a great</b> prohibition. <b>And what was this? A limb from a living</b> animal. One day the animal they brought him was missing a limb, and as the members of his household were very fearful they severed a limb from a living animal to make his meal appear whole, and he almost ate it.

### Part 5
§ After mentioning letters sent from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia and the issue of scoring parchment, the Gemara relates: <b>Mar Ukva,</b> the Exilarch in Babylonia, <b>sent</b> a letter <b>to Rabbi Elazar,</b> who was in Eretz Yisrael, in which the following was written: With regard to <b>people who stand over</b> and torment <b>me, and I have the power to deliver them into</b> the hands of <b>the government, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? May I hand them over to the authorities or not?

### Part 6
Rabbi Elazar <b>scored</b> parchment <b>and wrote to him</b> the following verse: <b>“I said: I will take heed to my ways, that I do not sin with my tongue; I will keep a curb upon my mouth, while the wicked is before me”</b> (Psalms 39:2). Rabbi Elazar quoted this verse to allude to the following response: <b>Even though “the wicked is before me,” “I will keep a curb upon my mouth.”</b>

### Part 7
Mar Ukva <b>sent</b> word to <b>him</b> again: <b>They are tormenting me a great deal and I cannot stand them.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>sent to him</b> in response: <b>“Resign yourself to the Lord, and wait patiently [<i>hitḥolel</i>] for Him;</b> do not fret yourself because of he who prospers in his way, because of the man who brings wicked devices to pass” (Psalms 37:7). This verse indicates: <b>“Resign yourself to the Lord,”</b> i.e., do not do anything, <b>and He will strike them down as many corpses [<i>ḥalalim</i>]. Rise before and stay later than them</b> in your visits <b>to the study hall, and they will disappear on their own.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>The matter emerged from the mouth of Rabbi Elazar, and Geneiva,</b> Mar Ukva’s tormentor, <b>was placed in a neck iron [<i>kolar</i>],</b> as one sentenced by the government.

### Part 8
The Gemara further relates: <b>They sent</b> the following question <b>to Mar Ukva: From where do we</b> derive that <b>song is forbidden</b> in the present, following the destruction of the Temple? <b>He scored</b> parchment <b>and wrote to them: “Rejoice not, O Israel, to exultation, like the peoples”</b> (Hosea 9:1).

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And let him send them</b> a response <b>from here: “They do not drink wine with a song; strong drink is bitter to them who drink it”</b> (Isaiah 24:9), indicating that song is no longer allowed. The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> he had answered <b>by</b> citing <b>that</b> verse, <b>I would say</b> that <b>this matter</b> applies only to <b>instrumental music,</b> in accordance with the previous verse: “The mirth of tabrets ceases, the noise of them who rejoice ends, the joy of the harp ceases” (Isaiah 24:8); <b>however, vocal</b> song is <b>permitted.</b> Therefore, Mar Ukva <b>teaches us</b> that all types of song are forbidden.

### Part 10
In connection to the incident in which Mar Ukva was instructed not to take revenge against his tormentors, the Gemara relates similar discussions. <b>Rav Huna bar Natan said to Rav Ashi: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Kina, and Dimonah, and Adadah”</b> (Joshua 15:22)? <b>He said to him:</b> The verse <b>is listing the cities of Eretz Yisrael.</b>

### Part 11
Rav Huna <b>said to him: Is that to say</b> that you think <b>I don’t know that</b> the verse <b>is listing the cities of Eretz Yisrael?</b> This is certainly the straightforward meaning of the verse. <b>Rather, Rav Geviha from Argiza said an explanation of</b> this verse, suggesting that it is an allusion to the following idea: <b>Anyone who harbors jealousy [<i>kina</i>] toward another, and</b> yet remains <b>silent [<i>domem</i>], He who dwells for all eternity [<i>adei ad</i>] performs judgment on his behalf.</b>

### Part 12
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: If that is so,</b> you should <b>also</b> expound the verse: <b>“Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah”</b> (Joshua 15:31), in a similar manner. Rav Huna <b>said to him: If Rav Geviha from Bei Argiza was here, he would say an explanation for it.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Aḥa from Bei Ḥoza’a said this about that</b> verse: <b>Anyone who has a complaint against another over a sip [<i>tza’akat legima</i>],</b> i.e., he has a claim that someone did not give him food, <b>and</b> remains <b>silent [<i>domem</i>], the One who dwells in the</b> burning <b>bush [<i>seneh</i>] performs judgment on his behalf.</b>

### Part 13
<b>The Exilarch said to Rav Huna: From where do we</b> derive that it is <b>prohibited</b> to place <b>a garland</b> on a groom’s head? Rav Huna <b>said to him:</b> It is prohibited <b>by rabbinic law, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sota</i> 49a): <b>In the war [<i>pulmus</i>] of Vespasian they decreed upon the garlands of bridegrooms,</b> meaning that bridegrooms may no longer wear garlands, <b>and</b> they decreed <b>upon the drum [<i>irus</i>],</b> meaning they also banned the playing of drums.

### Part 14
<b>In the meantime Rav Huna stood to relieve himself,</b> and after he left, <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who had not spoken up to that point out of reverence for his teacher, Rav Huna, <b>said to</b> the Exilarch: <b>A verse is written</b> with regard to this matter: <b>“Thus says the Lord God: The mitre shall be removed, and the garland taken off; this shall no more be the same; that which is low shall be exalted, and that which is high abased”</b> (Ezekiel 21:31).

### Part 15
<b>But in what way is a mitre connected to a garland?</b> These two are not placed on the head of the same type of person. <b>Rather,</b> this verse serves <b>to say to you: When the mitre is</b> found <b>on the head of the High Priest,</b> i.e., when the Temple is standing, then <b>a garland</b> may be found <b>on the head of every man</b> at his wedding. However, once <b>the mitre is removed from the head of the High Priest, the garland is removed from the head of every man.</b>

### Part 16
<b>In the meantime, Rav Huna came</b> back and <b>he found them sitting</b> and discussing this matter. <b>He said to</b> Rav Ḥisda in the form of an oath: <b>By God!</b> This prohibition applies <b>by rabbinic law. However, your name is Ḥisda and your words find favor [<i>ḥisda’in</i>],</b> as you have discovered a fine source for this <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 17
The Gemara relates: <b>Ravina found Mar bar Rav Ashi braiding a garland for his daughter</b> upon her marriage. <b>He said to him: Doesn’t the Master hold</b> in accordance with the aforementioned <i>halakha</i> derived from the verse: <b>“The mitre shall be removed and the garland taken off”? He said to him:</b> This prohibition was stated in reference to one who is <b>similar to a High Priest,</b> and is only applicable <b>with regard to men. However, with regard to women,</b> the Sages did <b>not</b> issue this decree.

### Part 18
With regard to the above verse, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the expression: <b>“This shall no more be the same”? Rabbi Avira interpreted</b> this verse <b>homiletically. Sometimes he would say it in the name of Rav Ami, and sometimes he would say it in the name of Rav Asi: When the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the Jewish people</b> at the time of the destruction of the Temple: <b>“Remove the mitre and take off the garland,” the ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> is <b>this</b> the appropriate treatment <b>for the Jewish people, who,</b> at the giving of the Torah <b>at Sinai, preceded</b> the statement of: <b>“We will do” to</b> the statement: <b>“We will hear”</b> (Exodus 22:7)?

### Part 19
God <b>said to them:</b> Is <b>this not</b> appropriate <b>for the Jewish people, who lowered the exalted and who exalted the lowly,</b> i.e., they did not serve God, <b>and</b> instead worshiped idols when <b>they established an idol in the Sanctuary?</b> This response is alluded to in the verse: “This shall no more be the same.”

### Part 20
The Gemara cites another statement by the same Sages. <b>Rav Avira interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically. Sometimes he would say it in the name of Rav Ami, and sometimes he would say it in the name of Rav Asi: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Thus says the Lord: Though they be in full strength [<i>shelemim</i>], and likewise many, even so shall they be cut down, and he shall pass away;</b> and though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more” (Nahum 1:12). This means: <b>If a person sees that his sustenance is limited he should use it for charity, and all the more so when it is plentiful.</b> In other words, if his livelihood has finished [<i>nishlam</i>] he should perform charity, and he should certainly act in this manner if his means are plentiful.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“Even so shall they be cut down [<i>nagozzu</i>], and he shall pass away”?</b> A Sage from <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Anyone who shears off [<i>gozez</i>]</b> some <b>of his property and performs charity with it will be saved from the judgment of Gehenna.</b> The Gemara offers <b>a parable</b> that compares this case <b>to two sheep that were passing through the water. One</b> of them was <b>shorn and</b> the other <b>one</b> was <b>unshorn.</b> The <b>shorn</b> sheep <b>crossed</b> to the other side, <b>but the unshorn</b> sheep <b>did not cross,</b> as its wool absorbed the water and it drowned. Similarly, one who shears off his property and gives it as charity will not descend to Gehenna.
