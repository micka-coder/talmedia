### Part 1
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who reverse</b> the attribution of the opinions of Rabba and Rav Yosef with regard to this matter.

### Part 2
The mishna teaches that if a man <b>said to ten</b> people: <b>Write</b> and give <b>a bill of divorce</b> to my wife, one of the ten writes the bill of divorce and two sign it. <b>The Sages taught:</b> If <b>one said to ten</b> people: <b>Write a bill of divorce and give</b> it <b>to my wife, one writes on behalf of them all.</b> If he said: <b>All of you write</b> the document, <b>one writes</b> it <b>in the presence of them all.</b> If he said: <b>Deliver a bill of divorce to my wife, one</b> person <b>brings</b> it <b>on behalf of them all.</b> If he said: <b>All of you deliver</b> a bill of divorce, then <b>one brings</b> it <b>in the presence of them all.</b>

### Part 3
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If he said: Write a bill of divorce, and <b>he enumerated them</b> by name, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Can one of them write the bill of divorce on behalf of them all? Or perhaps it is comparable to a situation where one says: All of you write, when it must be written in the presence of them all. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If <b>one enumerated</b> them by name, <b>it is not comparable to</b> saying: <b>All of you</b> write. <b>Rabbi Yoá¸¥anan says in the name of Rabbi Elazar of Rome:</b> If <b>one enumerated</b> them by name, <b>it is comparable to</b> saying: <b>All of you</b> write.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Pappa said: And they do not disagree. This</b> is referring to a case <b>where he enumerated them all, and that</b> is referring to a case <b>where he enumerated some of them. Some say</b> that the distinction between the cases should be explained <b>in this manner, and some say it in that manner.</b> Some explain that the distinction is that if he enumerated them all, he insists that they all participate, but if he enumerated some of them, he does not insist that they do so. He enumerated the names that he did only to indicate that he wants the people performing the task to be chosen from those people. Others explain that if he enumerated only some of them, he thereby expressed his intent that they alone participate, but if he enumerated them all but did not say: All of you write, that is not the case.

### Part 5
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rav Yehuda instituted in</b> the case of <b>a bill of divorce</b> with regard to which the husband gave instructions in the presence of many people and the concern is that it will be interpreted that he said: <b>All of you</b> write, and if they do not all sign there will be uncertainty whether or not the woman is divorced, that he should say: <b>Write</b> it, <b>either all of you or each and every one of you; sign</b> it, <b>either all of you or every two of you; deliver</b> it, <b>either all of you or each and every one of you.</b> In that way, there is no concern that the bill of divorce will be invalid if one of them fails to participate.

### Part 6
<b>Rava said:</b> This ordinance still leaves room for a pitfall. Since Rav Yehuda instituted a formula that is that long and complex, <b>sometimes</b> the husband <b>may truncate his statement and say: All of you, but he will not say: Every one of you. And</b> the bill of divorce <b>will be invalidated</b> as a result.

### Part 7
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that he must say: <b>Each of you</b> may <b>write</b> it, <b>every two of you</b> may <b>sign</b> it, <b>each one of you</b> may <b>deliver</b> it. However, he should not say: All of you, so that the bill of divorce will not be invalidated if one fails to do so.
