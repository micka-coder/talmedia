### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who permitted using a bill of divorce that was written during the day and signed at night, <b>is worthy of being relied upon in exigent circumstances.</b> Therefore, once such a bill of divorce has been written and given, the woman is divorced.

### Part 2
The Gemara challenges: <b>But didn’t Reish Lakish say: Rabbi Shimon deemed</b> such a bill of divorce <b>valid only</b> if it was signed <b>immediately, but</b> after a delay <b>from now until ten days, no.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to that</b> question, whether the others must sign immediately, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who holds that they may sign after a delay.

### Part 3
The Gemara challenges: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Two</b> of them function <b>as witnesses, and all</b> the rest <b>of them</b> sign the bill of divorce only <b>due to</b> the <b>stipulation?</b> It is clear that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi does not hold in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is concerned about the other witnesses and deems the bill of divorce valid only due to exigent circumstances. The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to this,</b> i.e., why the additional people must sign, <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> that all of them function as witnesses.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may write</b> a bill of divorce <b>with any</b> material that can be used for writing: <b>With <i>deyo</i>, with paint [<i>sam</i>], with <i>sikra</i>, with <i>komos</i>, with <i>kankantom</i> or with anything that</b> produces <b>permanent</b> writing. However, <b>one may not write with</b> other <b>liquids, nor with fruit juice, nor with anything</b> that does <b>not</b> produce <b>permanent</b> writing.

### Part 5
Similarly, with regard to the document itself, <b>one may write on anything,</b> even <b>on an olive leaf, or on the horn of a cow. And</b> the latter is valid if <b>he gives her the</b> entire <b>cow.</b> Likewise, one may write a bill of divorce <b>on the hand of a slave, and</b> that is valid if <b>he gives her the slave. Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> disagrees and <b>says: One may not write</b> a bill of divorce <b>on any living thing, nor</b> may it be written <b>on food.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara begins by explaining the terms used in the mishna: <b><i>Deyo</i></b> refers to what is called <b><i>deyota</i>,</b> ink, in Aramaic. <b><i>Sam</i></b> refers to <b><i>samma</i>,</b> arsenic. With regard to <b><i>sikra</i>, Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Its name</b> in Aramaic is <b><i>sikreta</i>,</b> red dye, derived from minium, which is also known as red lead. <b><i>Komos</i>,</b> tree resin, is known as <b><i>kuma</i></b> in Aramaic. With regard to <b><i>kankantom</i>, Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> This is the <b>black</b> substance <b>used by cobblers,</b> iron sulfate.

### Part 7
The mishna taught that one is allowed to write a bill of divorce <b>with anything</b> that produces <b>permanent</b> writing. The Gemara asks: This statement is meant <b>to add what?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>To add what Rabbi Ḥanina taught:</b> If <b>he wrote it with <i>mei teriya</i> or</b> water in which <b>gallnuts [<i>aftza</i>]</b> were soaked, then it is <b>valid,</b> as the writing is permanent. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches:</b> If <b>he wrote it with lead, with coals, or with black paint</b> then it is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 8
§ <b>It was stated</b> that there was a related discussion about different types of writing: In the case of <b>one who passes ink over</b> letters written in <b>red dye on Shabbat, Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say</b> that he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin-offerings for this: <b>One due to</b> violating the prohibition against <b>writing</b> on Shabbat, because he is now writing letters in ink, <b>and one due to</b> violating the prohibition against <b>erasing</b> on Shabbat, because as he writes he erases what is written in red dye. They also agree in the case of <b>ink</b> written <b>on top of ink,</b> or <b>red dye on top of red dye,</b> that according to everyone he is <b>exempt,</b> because he changed nothing with his writing. However, if he wrote with <b>red dye on top of ink,</b> then <b>some say</b> that he is <b>liable and some say</b> that he is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara explains these opinions: <b>Some say</b> that he is <b>liable</b> because <b>it is erasing,</b> as he erases the higher-quality, original writing. <b>Some say</b> that he is <b>exempt</b> because <b>he is destroying</b> and one who acts destructively is exempt, as he has not performed planned, constructive labor on Shabbat.

### Part 10
This dispute pertains to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat. With regard to the signing of documents, <b>Reish Lakish raised a dilemma before Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If there are <b>witnesses who do not know how to sign</b> their names, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>: May their names <b>be written for them with red dye,</b> and afterward they <b>will sign</b> on top of it in ink? The question is: Is <b>the upper writing,</b> which was not directly on the document but on top of other ink, considered to be <b>writing, or is it not writing? He said to him: It is not writing.</b> Consequently, this may not be done for witnesses who do not know how to sign.

### Part 11
Reish Lakish <b>said to him: Didn’t our master,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>teach us</b> that the <b>upper writing</b> is considered to be <b>writing with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat?</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: And because we compare</b> the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to bills of divorce to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, <b>shall we perform an action</b> and teach that a bill of divorce may be written in this manner?

### Part 12
§ <b>It was stated</b> that there was a dispute with regard to the following question: What should be done for <b>witnesses who do not know</b> how <b>to sign? Rav says: One tears blank paper for them,</b> meaning that a stencil of their names is fashioned from blank paper and placed on the bill of divorce. The witnesses then <b>fill in the gaps</b> with <b>ink</b> so that their names appear on the document. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> One first writes their names on the document <b>with lead,</b> and the witnesses write over those letters.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: Would it <b>enter your mind</b> to say that they actually write for them <b>with lead? But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach:</b> If <b>he wrote it with lead, with coals, or</b> with <b>black paint,</b> then it is <b>valid?</b> It can be seen from this <i>baraita</i> that writing with lead is considered to be a valid form of writing, and, as Rabbi Yoḥanan taught, if one writes on top of other writing then the second writing is not accepted for the signing of documents. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult: This,</b> that Shmuel allowed the witnesses to sign on top of lead writing, applies only when the first writing was done <b>with lead</b> itself, which is not considered to be writing on its own. <b>That,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya’s statement that it is valid for writing a bill of divorce, applies only when the first writing was done <b>using lead water,</b> i.e., water colored black with lead.

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> A solution would be to write the names for these witnesses <b>with gall water</b> [<b><i>mei milin</i></b>] and have them trace their names with ink. The Gemara challenges: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥanina teach</b> that if <b>he wrote</b> a bill of divorce <b>with <i>mei teriya</i> or</b> water in which <b>gallnuts</b> were soaked it is <b>valid?</b> As this is so, any additional writing over the writing in gall water should not be accepted as a valid signature.

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> suggestion of Rabbi Abbahu, that the document be prepared with the names of the witnesses written with gall water, refers to a case where the parchment was processed <b>with gallnuts. That</b> statement of Rabbi Ḥanina, that gall water may be used on its own to write a bill of divorce, refers to a case where the parchment was <b>not</b> processed <b>with gallnuts.</b> The reason for the difference is <b>because gall water is not</b> permanent when applied <b>on top of gall water,</b> i.e., on parchment that was processed with gallnuts. Therefore, if the parchment was processed using gallnuts, the writing of the names of the witnesses, done with gall water, will not be permanent, and the witnesses may sign their names on top of that writing. When the <i>baraita</i> states that witnesses may sign their names with gall water, it is referring to a case where the parchment was not processed with gallnuts, so the gall water signature will be permanent.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> A solution would be to write the names for these witnesses <b>with saliva</b> and have them trace their names with ink. <b>And so Rav Pappa instructed Pappa the ox herder,</b> who did not know how to sign his name, that the court should write his name <b>with saliva</b> and he should trace it with ink. The Gemara comments: <b>This matter,</b> the leniency to have the witnesses trace their names, applies only <b>to bills of divorce,</b> as there is a concern that witnesses will not be found, and the woman will be unable to remarry. <b>However, for</b> financial <b>documents,</b> the Sages did <b>not</b> allow this, and one must instead find witnesses who know how to sign their names.

### Part 17
It is told <b>that</b> there was <b>a certain person who performed an action</b> and allowed witnesses to trace their names <b>in</b> a case of <b>other documents,</b> which were not bills of divorce, and <b>Rav Kahana</b> ordered that <b>he be flogged</b> for doing so.
