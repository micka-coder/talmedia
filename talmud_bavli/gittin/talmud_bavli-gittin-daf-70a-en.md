<b>grapes</b> grown by trellising the vine on <b>a palm tree</b> soaked <b>in water.</b>

### Part 2
As a remedy <b>for lichen planus [<i>ḥazazita</i>]</b> on one’s skin, <b>let him bring seven large wheat kernels [<i>arzanayata</i>] and</b> let him <b>roast them over</b> a fire on the blade of <b>a new hoe. And</b> let him <b>extract oil from</b> the wheat <b>and rub</b> it into his skin. It is told: <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi used this</b> remedy <b>for a certain gentile</b> who had <b>something else,</b> i.e., leprosy, <b>and he was healed.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Shmuel said: One who is struck with Persian spears [<i>alunkei</i>] will not live</b> long afterward, as he will certainly die from this wound. <b>In the meantime, they should force-feed him fatty meat</b> that was roasted <b>over coals, and undiluted wine.</b> If they do this, it is <b>possible that he will live</b> for <b>a little bit</b> longer <b>and</b> have time to <b>instruct his household</b> with regard to what they should do after his death.

### Part 4
Similarly, <b>Rav Idi bar Avin said: One who swallowed a hornet will not live. In the meantime they should give him a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of sharp [<i>shamzag</i>] vinegar to drink.</b> If they do this, <b>it is possible that he will live</b> for <b>a little bit</b> longer <b>and</b> have time to <b>instruct his household</b> with regard to what they should do after his death.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> If one <b>ate ox meat with a turnip, and slept by</b> the light of <b>the moon on the night of the fourteenth or the fifteenth</b> of the month <b>in the season of Tammuz,</b> i.e., summer, he will be <b>afflicted with <i>aḥilu</i>,</b> a severe fever.

### Part 6
A Sage <b>taught: And one who fills his stomach with anything,</b> meaning that he eats too much, will be <b>afflicted with <i>aḥilu</i>. Rav Pappa said: Even</b> if he fills his stomach <b>with dates.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> this <b>obvious,</b> as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi explicitly mentioned if one fills his stomach with anything. The Gemara answers: <b>It might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since the Master said</b> the following in praise of dates: <b>Dates satisfy</b> the body, <b>warm</b> it up, <b>act as a laxative, strengthen</b> the body, <b>and do not spoil</b> it, one might <b>say</b> that as dates are beneficial, he would not be harmed by eating too many. Nevertheless, it <b>teaches us</b> that they can also cause harm when eaten in excess.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the affliction <b><i>aḥilu</i></b> mentioned here? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: A fire of the bones.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is a fire of the bones? Abaye said:</b> This is what is called <b><i>esh garmei</i></b> in Aramaic.

### Part 8
<b>What is its remedy? Abaye said: My mother told me</b> that <b>any drink</b> consumed for medicinal purposes should be taken for either <b>three or seven or twelve</b> days, depending on what is necessary for that specific ailment. <b>And</b> if <b>this</b> is taken to treat <i>aḥilu</i> then he must drink it <b>until he is healed.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Any drink</b> consumed for medicinal purposes should be consumed <b>with an empty heart,</b> i.e., without eating first. <b>And</b> for <b>this</b> disease of <i>aḥilu</i> he consumes the medicine <b>after he eats and drinks and enters the bathroom, and exits and washes his hands, and they bring him a fistful of <i>shetita</i>,</b> a type of food made <b>from lentils, and a fistful of aged wine. And let him mix them together and let him eat</b> this mixture. <b>And let him wrap himself with his sheet and sleep. And let there be no</b> one <b>who will awaken him until he awakens on his own. And when he awakens let him remove the sheet from himself. And if</b> he does <b>not</b> do this then the illness <b>will return to him.</b>

### Part 10
§ <b>Elijah</b> the prophet <b>said to Rabbi Natan: Eat a third</b> of your fill, <b>and drink a third</b> of your fill, <b>and leave a third</b> of your fill, so that <b>when you become angry you</b> will <b>become full.</b> If you do this, there will be room, as it were, for the anger. If you become angry when your stomach is full you will be harmed.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches: One who does not want to come to</b> a situation whereby he contracts <b>intestinal disease</b> should <b>become accustomed to dipping</b> his food in wine or vinegar, both in the <b>summer</b> and in the <b>winter.</b> He also teaches: <b>You should remove your hand,</b> i.e., stop eating, <b>from a meal that you enjoy</b> so that you do not overeat. <b>And do not delay yourself at the time when it is necessary to relieve yourself.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Mar Ukva said: This one who drinks inferior white wine [<i>tilya</i>]</b> will be <b>afflicted with weakness [<i>vitak</i>]. Rav Ḥisda said: There are sixty types of wine. The best of them all</b> is <b>red, fragrant</b> wine. <b>The worst of them all</b> is <b>inferior white wine.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav Yehuda said: This one who sits near the fire during the mornings</b> in the month <b>of Nisan and rubs</b> himself <b>with oil and</b> then <b>goes out and sits in the sun</b> will be <b>afflicted with weakness.</b>

### Part 14
<b>The Sages taught:</b> One who <b>let blood and</b> afterward <b>engaged in sexual intercourse has weak children</b> conceived from those acts of intercourse. If <b>both of them,</b> husband and wife, <b>let blood and engaged in sexual intercourse they will have children afflicted</b> with a disease known as <b><i>ra’atan</i>. Rav Pappa said: We said</b> this <b>only</b> if <b>he did not taste anything</b> after letting blood. <b>But</b> if <b>he tasted something</b> then <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says:</b> One who <b>came</b> back <b>from</b> traveling on <b>the road and engaged in sexual intercourse</b> immediately <b>has weak children</b> conceived from those acts of intercourse. <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>one who comes</b> in <b>from the bathroom,</b> he should <b>not engage in sexual intercourse until he waits the measure of</b> time it takes to walk <b>half a <i>mil</i> because the demon of the bathroom accompanies him. And if he engaged in sexual intercourse</b> without waiting this measure of time, <b>he has children</b> who are <b>epileptic.</b>

### Part 16
<b>The Sages taught: One who engages in sexual intercourse</b> while <b>standing</b> will be <b>afflicted by spasms.</b> One who engages in sexual intercourse while <b>sitting</b> will be <b>afflicted with <i>dalarya</i>.</b>If <b>she,</b> the woman, is <b>above and he,</b> the husband, is <b>below</b> during sexual intercourse, then he will be <b>afflicted with <i>dalarya</i>.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b><i>dalarya</i>? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> The <b>remedy for <i>dalarya</i></b> is <b><i>dardara</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b><i>dardara</i>? Abaye said: Saffron of thorns. Rav Pappa</b> would <b>chew [<i>aleis</i>] and swallow</b> this remedy. <b>Rav Pappi</b> would <b>chew and spit it</b> out.

### Part 18
<b>Abaye says:</b> As a remedy for <b>one who is not an expert,</b> i.e., does not have strength, <b>in</b> the <b>way of the world,</b> i.e., in sexual intercourse, <b>let him bring three vessels [<i>kefizei</i>],</b> each containing three-quarters of a <i>log</i> of <b>safflower thorns. And let him grind them, and boil them in wine, and drink</b> the mixture. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: These are</b> the remedies that <b>return me to my youth</b> with regard to sexual intercourse.

### Part 19
§ <b>Three things diminish a person’s strength, and they are: Fear,</b> traveling on the <b>road, and sin.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Fear, as it is written: “My heart flutters, my strength fails me”</b> (Psalms 38:11). Traveling on the <b>road, as it is written: “He has weakened my strength on the road”</b> (Psalms 102:24). <b>Sin, as it is written: “My strength fails because of my sin”</b> (Psalms 31:11).

### Part 20
<b>Three things break a person’s body, and they are:</b> If he <b>ate</b> while <b>standing,</b> if he <b>drank</b> while <b>standing, and</b> if he <b>engaged in sexual intercourse</b> while <b>standing.</b>

### Part 21
There are <b>five</b> actions that bring one <b>closer to death than</b> to <b>life, and they are:</b> If he <b>ate and stood</b> up immediately, if he <b>drank and stood</b> up immediately, if he <b>let blood and stood</b> up immediately, if he <b>slept and stood</b> up immediately, and if he <b>engaged in sexual intercourse and stood</b> up immediately.

### Part 22
With regard to <b>one who performs</b> the following acts, if he performs the <b>six</b> of <b>them</b> consecutively <b>he dies immediately, and they are:</b> If <b>one came</b> back <b>from</b> a journey <b>on the road and was exhausted, let blood, and entered the bathhouse, and drank and became intoxicated, and slept on the ground, and engaged in sexual intercourse,</b> then he will die. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: But he</b> will die for certain only in the case <b>where he performs them in this order.</b>

### Part 23
<b>Abaye said:</b> If he performs these actions <b>in this order he will die.</b> But if he performs them <b>out of order he will become weak.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t</b> a woman named <b>Me’oret make her slave</b> perform <b>three of these</b> actions <b>and he died</b> as a result? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> slave <b>was weak,</b> which is why he died. But an ordinary individual would die only upon performing all of these acts in the previously mentioned order.

### Part 24
<b>Eight</b> actions are <b>difficult</b> for the body and the soul to handle <b>in large</b> amounts <b>and</b> are <b>beneficial in small</b> amounts, <b>and they are:</b> Traveling on the <b>road,</b> engaging in the <b>way of the world,</b> i.e., engaging in sexual intercourse, having <b>wealth, work,</b> drinking <b>wine, sleep, hot water, and bloodletting.</b>

### Part 25
<b>Eight</b> actions or illnesses <b>decrease the semen, and they are: Salt, hunger,</b> a skin disease called <b><i>netek</i>, crying, sleeping on the ground,</b> the <b>melilot</b> plant, <b>and dodder</b> eaten <b>not in its time,</b> i.e., before it is ripe. <b>And bloodletting</b> performed <b>below,</b> on the lower portion of the body, causes <b>twice</b> as much harm as the other actions mentioned.

### Part 26
The Sage <b>taught: Just as</b> bloodletting <b>below</b> causes <b>twice</b> as much <b>harm, so too,</b> bloodletting <b>above,</b> on the upper portion of the body, is <b>twice</b> as <b>effective. Rav Pappa said:</b>
