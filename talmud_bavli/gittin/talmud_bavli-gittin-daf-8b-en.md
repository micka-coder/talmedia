### Part 1
<b>is like one who purchases</b> a field <b>in the outskirts [<i>parvarei</i>] of Jerusalem.</b> The Gemara clarifies: The <i>tanna</i> who says Syria is <b>obligated in tithe and</b> the mitzvot of <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>like Eretz Yisrael holds</b> that the <b>conquest of an individual is called a conquest.</b> Once Syria was conquered by King David, who is considered an individual in this regard, the sanctity of Eretz Yisrael applied to it and its residents became obligated in the mitzvot of Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And one who wishes to enter it</b> and remain <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual purity may</b> so <b>enter.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you say</b> that <b>its soil is ritually impure?</b> How then is it possible for one to enter it in a state of ritual purity? The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> means that one enters it <b>in a chest, a box, or a cabinet.</b> In this case he remains pure, as he did not come into contact with the ground itself.

### Part 3
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who enters the land of the nations,</b> i.e., any territory outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>in a chest, a box, or a cabinet, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> him ritually <b>impure,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, deems</b> him <b>pure. And even Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> one who did not touch the ground itself <b>impure only in the land of the nations,</b> concerning <b>which they decreed</b> impurity <b>upon</b> both <b>its clumps</b> of soil <b>and upon its air. However,</b> with regard to <b>Syria,</b> everyone agrees that <b>they decreed</b> impurity <b>upon its clumps</b> of soil, but <b>they did not decree</b> impurity <b>upon its air.</b> Therefore, it is possible to enter Syria and remain in a state of ritual purity if one does not touch the ground itself.

### Part 4
The <i>baraita</i> further teaches: <b>And one who purchases a field in Syria is like one who purchases</b> a field <b>in the outskirts of Jerusalem.</b> The Gemara asks: With regard <b>to which <i>halakha</i></b> was this stated? What practical ruling is taught by this statement? <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> This serves <b>to say that one writes a bill of sale [<i>ono</i>] for this</b> purchase, <b>and</b> one may write a bill of sale <b>even on Shabbat.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that one may write this bill of sale <b>on Shabbat?</b> Writing on Shabbat is a prohibited labor for which one is liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment. The Gemara explains: This is <b>as Rava says</b> with regard to a similar issue, that <b>one tells a gentile</b> that he should do it, <b>and he does</b> so. <b>Here too,</b> it is referring to a situation where <b>one tells a gentile</b> that he should write a bill of sale, <b>and he does</b> so. <b>And even though</b> the <i>halakha</i> generally is <b>that telling a gentile</b> to perform an action that is prohibited for a Jew on Shabbat violates <b>a rabbinic decree,</b> since the Sages prohibited instructing a gentile to perform prohibited labor on behalf of a Jew on Shabbat, here <b>the Sages did not</b> impose this <b>decree, due to</b> the mitzva of <b>settling Eretz Yisrael.</b>

### Part 6
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>a slave who brought his bill</b> of manumission to a court, <b>and it is written in it: You and my property are transferred to you, he acquires himself</b> via this document, and he is emancipated. However, <b>he does not acquire</b> the <b>property</b> unless the document is confirmed in court through its witnesses, like other documents.

### Part 7
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If the bill of manumission stated: <b>All of my property is transferred to you, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Abaye said: Since he acquired himself</b> as a freeman, as he is included in the property mentioned in the document, <b>he acquires</b> the rest of the <b>property</b> as well.

### Part 8
<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>Granted, he should acquire himself, just as it is in</b> the case of <b>a bill of divorce</b> of <b>a woman,</b> who is divorced when she brings the document herself. <b>However, he should not acquire</b> the <b>property, just as it is in</b> the case of the <b>ratification of typical</b> legal <b>documents.</b> If someone brings a typical document that deals with monetary matters that has not been ratified, the court will not rely on that document. So too here, as the bill of manumission, which includes a transfer of property, has not been ratified, he should not acquire the property.

### Part 9
After hearing Rava’s objection, <b>Abaye then said</b> the opposite: <b>Since he did not acquire the property, he does not acquire himself</b> either. <b>Rava said to him: Granted, he does not acquire the property, just as it is in</b> the case of the <b>ratification of typical</b> legal <b>documents; however, he should acquire himself, just as it is in</b> the case of <b>a bill of divorce</b> of <b>a woman,</b> who can bring her own bill of divorce and testify about it.

### Part 10
<b>Rather, Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>both this and that,</b> both in the case when the bill of manumission states: You and my property, and when it says: All of my property, <b>he acquires himself</b> but <b>he does not acquire</b> the <b>property. Rav Adda bar Mattana said to Rava: In accordance with whose</b> opinion do you say this? <b>In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who said</b> that <b>we divide the statement.</b> In other words, even if there is only one document or a single testimony, containing one general statement, it can be divided so that the court accepts it in part and rejects the rest.

### Part 11
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:8): <b>One who writes,</b> i.e., gives via a document, <b>all of his property to his slave,</b> the slave <b>has been emancipated,</b> but if he <b>reserved</b> for himself even <b>any amount of land,</b> then he <b>has not been emancipated,</b> as perhaps he reserved the slave for himself as well. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b>
