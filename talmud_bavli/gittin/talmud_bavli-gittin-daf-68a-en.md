### Part 1
<b>A silver cup was stolen from us,</b> and they searched everyone for it. <b>When they were checking they found</b> the piece of meat <b>wrapped in his scarf.</b>

### Part 2
The Exilarch’s servants <b>said to</b> the Exilarch: <b>See Master,</b> i.e., the Exilarch, Rav Sheshet <b>does not desire to eat, rather</b> he wishes only <b>to afflict us.</b> Even after everything that was done for him he did not eat from the Exilarch’s meal. Rav Sheshet <b>said to them: I ate and I tasted the taste of white</b> leprous spots <b>in</b> the meat and therefore I did not eat it. <b>They said to</b> the Exilarch: <b>We did not prepare</b> an animal with <b>white</b> spots <b>today.</b> Rav Sheshet <b>said to them: Check the</b> skin <b>in</b> the <b>place</b> of the portion that I was given. He issued this instruction in accordance with the statement of Rav Ḥisda, <b>as Rav Ḥisda said: Black</b> spots <b>within white</b> skin <b>and white</b> spots <b>within black</b> skin <b>are an affliction</b> and a sign of disease. <b>They checked</b> and <b>found</b> that the animal was afflicted in this manner, and the Exilarch’s servants became even angrier with him.

### Part 3
<b>When</b> Rav Sheshet <b>was exiting</b> the house of the Exilarch the servants <b>dug a pit and placed a reed mat [<i>tzifta</i>] on top of it</b> so that the pit would not be noticed. <b>And they said to</b> Rav Sheshet: <b>The Master,</b> i.e., Rav Sheshet, <b>should come and rest</b> for a short time, and they intended for him to fall and be hurt. <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who was also present, <b>snorted [<i>neḥar</i>] to him from behind</b> in order to signal to him. Rav Sheshet <b>said to a child</b> who was there: <b>Recite your verse for me</b> that you studied today. The child <b>said to him: “Turn to your right or to your left”</b> (II Samuel 2:21). Rav Sheshet, who was blind, <b>said to his servant: What do you see?</b> His servant <b>said to him:</b> I see <b>a mat that</b> has been <b>placed</b> on the ground. Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: Turn away from it</b> and we will go around it.

### Part 4
<b>After</b> Rav Sheshet <b>left</b> the Exilarch’s house, <b>Rav Ḥisda said to him: From where did the Master,</b> i.e., Rav Sheshet, <b>know</b> that the servants had dug a pit in that place? Rav Sheshet <b>said to him:</b> There were several matters that raised my suspicions. <b>One, that the Master,</b> i.e., Rav Ḥisda, <b>snorted to me</b> to signal that I should beware. <b>And additionally, when the child recited the verse</b> for me it alluded to this matter. <b>And additionally, servants are suspect of not</b> acting <b>according to a high standard,</b> and I suspected that they would attempt to cause me harm.

### Part 5
§ After mentioning the spirit named <i>kordeyakos</i> on the previous <i>daf</i> the Gemara relates other matters connected to spirits and demons. It is written: <b>“I got myself <i>sharim</i> and <i>sharot</i>, and human pleasures, <i>shidda</i> and <i>shiddot</i>”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:8). The Gemara explains: <b>“<i>Sharim</i> and <i>sharot</i>”: These are types of musical</b> instruments. <b>“And human pleasures”: These are pools and bathhouses. “<i>Shidda</i> and <i>shiddot</i>”: Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they interpreted</b> these words in the following manner: <b>Male demons [<i>shidda</i>] and female demons [<i>shiddetin</i>]. In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they said</b> that these words are referring to <b>carriages [<i>shiddeta</i>].</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: There were three hundred types of demons in</b> a place named <b>Shiḥin, but I do not know what</b> the form or nature of <b>a demon itself is.</b>

### Part 7
<b>The Master said: Here they interpreted</b> it: <b>Male demons and female demons.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why was it necessary for</b> Solomon, the author of Ecclesiastes, to have <b>male demons and female demons?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to the building of the Temple: <b>“For the house, when it was being built, was built of stone made ready at the quarry;</b> and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was being built” (I Kings 6:7). Solomon <b>said to the sages: How shall I make</b> it so that the stone will be precisely cut without using iron? <b>They said to him: There is a</b> creature called <b>a <i>shamir</i></b> that can cut the stones, <b>which Moses brought</b> and used to cut <b>the stones of the ephod.</b>

### Part 8
Solomon <b>said to them: Where is it found? They said to him: Bring a male demon and a female demon</b> and <b>torment them together. It is possible that they know</b> where, and due to the suffering <b>they will reveal</b> the place <b>to you.</b> Solomon <b>brought a male demon and a female demon</b> and <b>tormented them together,</b> and <b>they said: We do not know</b> where to find the <i>shamir</i>. <b>Perhaps Ashmedai, king of the demons, knows.</b>

### Part 9
Solomon <b>said to them: Where is</b> Ashmedai? <b>They said to him:</b> He <b>is on such-and-such a mountain.</b> He has <b>dug a pit for himself</b> there, <b>and filled it with water, and covered it with a rock, and sealed it with his seal. And every day he ascends to Heaven and studies in the heavenly study hall and he descends to the earth and studies in the earthly study hall. And he comes and checks his seal</b> to ensure that nobody has entered his pit, <b>and</b> then <b>he uncovers it and drinks</b> from the water in the pit. <b>And</b> then <b>he covers it and seals it</b> again <b>and goes.</b>

### Part 10
Solomon <b>sent for Benayahu, son of Jehoiada,</b> a member of the royal entourage, and <b>gave him a chain onto which</b> a sacred <b>name</b> of God <b>was carved, and a ring onto which</b> a sacred <b>name</b> of God <b>was carved, and fleeces of wool and wineskins of wine.</b> What did Benayahu do? <b>He went and dug a pit lower</b> down the mountain, below the pit dug by Ashmedai, <b>drained the water, and plugged it with the fleeces of wool</b> so that Ashmedai’s pit was emptied. <b>And he dug a pit higher</b> up the mountain, above Ashmedai’s pit. <b>And he poured the wine into it</b> so that the wine filled Ashmedai’s pit, <b>and he plugged</b> the lower and upper pits that he dug. <b>He</b> climbed <b>up</b> and <b>sat in a tree.</b>

### Part 11
<b>When</b> Ashmedai <b>came he checked his seal, opened</b> the pit, and <b>found it</b> to be filled with <b>wine. He said</b> that <b>it is written: “Wine is a mocker, strong drink is riotous; and whosoever wallows in it is not wise”</b> (Proverbs 20:1), <b>and it is written: “Harlotry, wine, and new wine take away the heart”</b> (Hosea 4:11). He concluded: <b>I will not drink</b> this wine. Eventually, <b>when he became thirsty, he was unable to</b> resist the wine and <b>he drank, became intoxicated, and fell asleep.</b>

### Part 12
Benayahu <b>descended</b> from the tree, <b>came,</b> and <b>threw the chain around</b> Ashmedai, and <b>enclosed him</b> within it. <b>When</b> Ashmedai <b>awoke he struggled</b> to remove the chain. Benayahu <b>said to him: The name of your Master is upon you, the name of your Master is upon you,</b> do not tear the chain. God’s name is written on this chain, and it is forbidden to destroy it.

### Part 13
<b>When</b> Benayahu <b>took</b> Ashmedai <b>and came</b> to Jerusalem <b>he reached a palm tree</b> and Ashmedai <b>rubbed against it</b> and <b>knocked it down. He reached a house</b> and <b>knocked it down. He reached a small shack [<i>kuva</i>] belonging to a certain widow.</b> This widow <b>emerged,</b>
