### Part 1
<b>as</b> in this case <b>Rabbi Eliezer permits</b> her <b>to</b> marry <b>any man except for that man</b> about whom the condition was made, <b>and the Rabbis prohibit</b> her from remarrying, as in their opinion this divorce is not valid.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning behind Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion as cited in the <i>baraita</i>? The Gemara answers: The ruling here is <b>just as it is with regard to any typical condition.</b> The husband has the right to attach conditions to the divorce. <b>And</b> how would <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this reasoning? They would reason that by attaching <b>any typical condition</b> the husband <b>did not leave out</b> part <b>of the bill of divorce,</b> as it does not diminish the essential act of severance. By contrast, <b>here he left out</b> part <b>of the bill of divorce,</b> as she is not permitted to marry any man she wishes. Therefore, the divorce is invalid.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the mishna, which we established as</b> referring to a case of <b>exception, what is the reason for Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion that the divorce takes effect, despite its lack of complete severance?

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yannai said in the name of one elder</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to divorce: <b>“And she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man’s wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2), indicating that <b>even</b> if he divorced her in a manner that <b>only permitted her to</b> marry one <b>other man, she is divorced,</b> i.e., this partial severance takes effect. <b>And the Rabbis would say</b> in response to <b>Rabbi Eliezer’s explanation</b> that <b>this</b> phrase: Another <b>man,</b> which appears in the verse refers not to a specific man but <b>to any man,</b> i.e., it must be permitted for her to marry any man for the divorce to take effect.

### Part 5
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>the reason for Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion <b>is from</b> the verse <b>here,</b> where it is stated with regard to priests: <b>“Neither may they take a woman divorced from her husband”</b> (Leviticus 21:7). This verse indicates that <b>even</b> if <b>she was divorced only from her husband,</b> and was not permitted to marry others, <b>she is disqualified from</b> marrying into <b>the priesthood</b> as a divorcée, i.e., she may not marry a priest even after her husband’s death. <b>Apparently,</b> all the more so, divorce that excludes certain men from the wife’s right to remarry <b>is</b> considered a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> This is certainly the case when the divorce permits her to marry all men with the exception of one.

### Part 6
<b>And the Rabbis</b> would respond that <b>the prohibition</b> against marrying into the <b>priesthood is different,</b> as even a divorce that is otherwise invalid disqualifies a woman from marrying a priest.

### Part 7
§ <b>Rabbi Abba raises a dilemma:</b> If this kind of exception is made <b>in</b> a case of <b>betrothal,</b> i.e., the man says to the woman that she is hereby forbidden to all men except for so-and-so, <b>how</b> is this betrothal treated? The Gemara elaborates: <b>Let the dilemma be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> and <b>let the dilemma be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Let the dilemma be raised according to Rabbi Eliezer:</b> Is <b>Rabbi Eliezer saying only here</b> that the divorce is valid <b>because verses are written</b> that support this proposition, as delineated by Rabbi Yannai and Rabbi Yoḥanan; <b>but there,</b> in the case of betrothal, <b>a proper acquisition is necessary,</b> which is not the case when a certain man is excluded from the prohibition to engage in sexual intercourse with her? <b>Or</b> should it <b>perhaps</b> be derived from the juxtaposition between the clause: <b>“And she departs</b> out of his house,” and the clause: <b>“And becomes</b> another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2), which serves as a basis for the comparison of the <i>halakhot</i> of divorce and betrothal, teaching that just as divorce takes effect in this manner, so does betrothal?

### Part 9
<b>Let the dilemma be raised according to the Rabbis:</b> Are <b>the Rabbis saying here</b> that the divorce is invalid <b>only because</b> the <b>severance</b> of the bond between the husband and wife <b>is necessary</b> for the divorce to take effect, <b>and there is no</b> such severance as long as the woman may not marry any man she wishes; <b>but there,</b> in the case of betrothal, <b>any</b> form of <b>acquisition</b> is sufficient for it to take effect? <b>Or</b> should it <b>perhaps</b> be derived from the juxtaposition between the clause beginning: <b>“And she departs,”</b> and the clause beginning: <b>“And becomes,”</b> that what renders a divorce invalid renders a betrothal invalid as well?

### Part 10
<b>After</b> Rabbi Abba <b>raised the dilemma he then resolved it</b> in the following manner: <b>Both according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer and according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis it is necessary</b> to compare the <i>halakha</i> in the case of betrothal to the ruling with regard to divorce, based on the juxtaposition between <b>“And she departs”</b> and: <b>“And becomes.”</b> Therefore, the dispute remains in this case as well.

### Part 11
<b>Abaye said: If you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Abba’s</b> solution <b>is so,</b> i.e., if you say that Rabbi Eliezer holds that making an exception in a betrothal is valid, the issue of levirate marriage in such cases must be addressed.

### Part 12
If <b>Reuven came</b> to a woman <b>and betrothed her</b> saying that she is forbidden to all men <b>except for</b> his brother <b>Shimon, and Shimon</b> then <b>came and betrothed her</b> saying that she is forbidden to all men <b>except for Reuven, and they both died</b> without children, in this case <b>she performs levirate marriage with</b> their brother <b>Levi, and I do not call her the wife of two dead men.</b> It is stated in tractate <i>Yevamot</i> (31b) that if a woman has a levirate bond with a man due to her two late husbands who were his brothers, she may not perform levirate marriage with him, as it is derived from the verse: “The wife of the dead man shall not be married outside of the family” (Deuteronomy 25:5), that the wife of only one dead man performs levirate marriage, not the wife of two. Abaye stated that in the case under discussion the woman may perform levirate marriage with Levi.

### Part 13
<b>What is the reason</b> that she is not considered to be the wife of two dead men? It is that although her <b>betrothal to Reuven was effective,</b> i.e., it took effect, her <b>betrothal to Shimon was not effective,</b> as it did not render her forbidden to any man to whom she was not already forbidden due to her betrothal to Reuven. Therefore, she is considered only Reuven’s wife.

### Part 14
<b>Rather, under what circumstances is</b> the case of <b>a wife of two dead men found</b> in this context? It is found in a case <b>where Reuven came and betrothed her,</b> saying that she is hereby forbidden to all men <b>except for Shimon, and Shimon</b> then <b>came and betrothed her without specifying</b> any qualifications. <b>Since Reuven’s betrothal was effective in rendering her forbidden to everyone</b> except for Shimon, <b>and Shimon’s betrothal was effective in rendering her forbidden to Reuven,</b> the betrothal of both brothers took effect. And if both of them die she may not perform levirate marriage with Levi, as she is the wife of two dead men.

### Part 15
<b>Abaye raises a dilemma:</b> If a man <b>said to</b> his wife while handing her a bill of divorce: <b>You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man except for Reuven and Shimon, and he then said to her:</b> You are permitted <b>to</b> marry <b>Reuven and Shimon, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 16
<b>Do we say</b> that <b>what he forbade</b> initially <b>he</b> then <b>permitted,</b> enabling her to marry anyone, including Reuven and Shimon, in which case the severance is complete? <b>Or perhaps what he forbade</b> initially <b>he</b> then <b>permitted,</b> permitting her to marry Reuven and Shimon, <b>and what he permitted</b> initially <b>he</b> then <b>forbade,</b> i.e., he permitted her only to Reuven and Shimon, excluding all other men? <b>If you say</b>
