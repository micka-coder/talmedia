### Part 1
<b>Rather,</b> it means that the court asks him questions <b>with</b> regard to <b>produce</b> that is not found during that season.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Kahana says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>a deaf-mute who can express</b> himself <b>through writing,</b> the judges of the court may <b>write and give a bill of divorce to his wife</b> based on his written instructions. <b>Rav Yosef said: What is he teaching us? We</b> already <b>learned</b> in the mishna: In a case where the husband <b>became mute, and</b> the members of the court <b>said to him:</b> Shall <b>we write a bill of divorce for your wife, and he nodded his head</b> indicating his agreement, <b>they examine him</b> with various questions <b>three times. If he responded to</b> questions that have <b>a negative</b> answer: <b>No, and</b> responded <b>to</b> questions that have <b>a positive</b> answer: <b>Yes,</b> indicating his competence, <b>they shall write</b> the bill of divorce <b>and give</b> it to his wife based on the nod of his head.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to him: A mute, you say?</b> Is your challenge based on the mishna which discusses one who is mute? <b>A mute is different</b> because it is clear that his mind is intact. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 1:2): With regard to one <b>who speaks but cannot hear, this</b> individual <b>is</b> categorized as <b>a deaf person.</b> With regard to one <b>who hears but cannot speak, this</b> individual <b>is</b> categorized as <b>a mute person, and</b> both <b>this</b> one <b>and that</b> one <b>are</b> considered to be <b>like</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> people <b>with regard to all their matters.</b> Rav Kahana stated his ruling with regard to one who can neither hear nor speak. This goes beyond the <i>halakha</i> of the mishna, as Rav Kahana says that the written statement of a deaf-mute is an indication of his mental competence.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> do we learn <b>that</b> one <b>who speaks but cannot hear, this</b> individual <b>is</b> categorized as <b>a deaf person,</b> and that with regard to one <b>who hears but cannot speak, this</b> individual <b>is</b> categorized as <b>a mute person? As it is written: “And I am like a deaf man, I do not hear, and like the mute man who will not open his mouth”</b> (Psalms 38:14). <b>And if you wish, say as people say:</b> The word for a mute [<i>ilem</i>] is a contraction of the expression <b>his speech has been taken [<i>ishtakil millulei</i>].</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: If</b> Rav Kahana’s statement is <b>difficult for me, this</b> is <b>difficult for me, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the punishment of one who was called to testify and failed to do so: <b>“If he does not utter</b> his testimony then he shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:1). The Sages derive from this that the verse serves <b>to exclude a mute who is unable to utter</b> his testimony, and he is exempt from bringing the offering of one who refuses to testify. And it is possible to raise the following question: <b>Why</b> is he exempt from bringing the offering; <b>but he is able to utter</b> his testimony <b>through writing?</b> Apparently, written testimony is not valid testimony.

### Part 6
<b>Abaye said to him: You say testimony? Testimony is different, as the Merciful One states: “From their mouths”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:6), which emphasizes that testimony must come from the witnesses’ mouths <b>and not from their writing.</b>

### Part 7
<b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> to this based on that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:1): <b>Just as</b> the judges of the court <b>investigate him,</b> one who lost his ability to speak, <b>with regard to bills of divorce, so too,</b> the judges <b>investigate him with regard to business</b> transactions, <b>testimonies, and inheritances. In any event it teaches: Testimonies,</b> which proves that even one unable to speak can give testimony.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Yosef bar Minyumi said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> This is not referring to testimony in general. Rather, it is referring <b>to testimony</b> with regard to <b>a woman</b> whose husband died, <b>as the Sages were lenient with her</b> and allowed testimony that would normally not be accepted, in order to permit her to remarry.

### Part 9
The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it</b> also <b>taught: Inheritances.</b> This seems to be referring to monetary matters, where proper testimony is required. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>the inheritance of his</b> own <b>firstborn son,</b> meaning that he is not testifying about other people’s property but testifying which one of his sons is the firstborn. Since this testimony is merely considered to be a division of the property that belongs to him, the testimony of one who is unable to speak is valid.

### Part 10
The Gemara continues to challenge: <b>In any event it teaches</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to business</b> transactions, <b>what, does it not</b> mean that a mute may testify with regard to business transactions <b>for everyone</b> else? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> he may testify <b>for himself</b> only. The <i>baraita</i> is saying that when a mute conducts business the court must first check if he is mentally capable.

### Part 11
<b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a deaf-mute,</b> the judges of the court <b>follow his signals, and follow the movement</b> of his lips, <b>and follow his handwriting only</b> for matters of buying and selling <b>movable property but not for bills of divorce.</b> This appears to contradict Rav Kahana’s statement that it is permitted for a deaf-mute husband to give written instructions to divorce his wife.

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 1:1) that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that the court may not rely on the written testimony of a deaf-mute with regard to a bill of divorce <b>said?</b> Only <b>in</b> the case <b>of a deaf-mute</b> who was deaf <b>from the outset,</b> i.e., from birth. But if he had been halakhically <b>competent,</b> i.e., he could previously hear, <b>but became a deaf-mute</b> later, then <b>he may write</b> instructions to give his wife a bill of divorce <b>and they,</b> the witnesses, should <b>sign,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rav Kahana.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> one who is a <b>deaf-mute from the outset cannot</b> give written instructions with regard to a bill of divorce? Isn’t it true that <b>just as he marries her with intimation,</b> i.e., without speaking, <b>so too, he divorces her with intimation.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to his wife, indeed</b> this would be the case and he could divorce her through intimations, because such a marriage is not a fully valid marriage by Torah law. But <b>with what are we dealing here? With his <i>yevama</i>,</b> his sister-in-law whose husband, his brother, died childless to whom he performed levirate marriage, and whom he subsequently wishes to divorce. This marriage is a fully valid marriage.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>His <i>yevama</i> from whom? If we say that she fell to him from his brother</b> who was also <b>a deaf-mute,</b> then <b>just as her marriage</b> to the brother was <b>through intimation, so too, her divorce</b> from the <i>yavam</i> can be <b>through intimation. Rather,</b> it must be <b>that she fell to him from his</b> halakhically <b>competent brother.</b> Consequently, the bond of the levirate marriage is by Torah law, whereas the deaf-mute man’s intimations that he desires to divorce her are valid only by rabbinic law.

### Part 16
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> explain <b>that she fell to him from his deaf-mute brother, and</b> the Sages instituted a rabbinic <b>decree</b> with regard to a woman bound in a levirate marriage <b>from his deaf-mute brother due to</b> the death of <b>his</b> halakhically <b>competent brother.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> and the Sages made such a decree with regard to a case where a deaf-mute brother died due to the case where a brother who is halakhically competent died, then with regard to <b>his</b> own <b>wife as well,</b> they should have made a decree that a deaf-mute husband cannot divorce her with a bill of divorce if he married her as a deaf-mute. The Gemara answers: <b>His <i>yevama</i></b> who was married to his halakhically competent brother might <b>be confused with his <i>yevama</i></b> who was married to his deaf-mute brother. But people <b>would not confuse his</b> own <b>wife with his <i>yevama</i>.</b> Therefore, there was no need to institute such a decree.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>And do we,</b> the Sages, <b>decree</b> with regard to his <b>deaf-mute</b> brother <b>due to</b> confusion between him and his halakhically <b>competent</b> brother?
