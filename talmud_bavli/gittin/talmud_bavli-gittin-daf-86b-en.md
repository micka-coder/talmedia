### Part 1
<b>And</b> Rav is saying that <b>specifically</b> when the bill of divorce is written in <b>his handwriting and</b> has the signature of one <b>witness,</b> the woman’s child from her second husband is of unflawed lineage. <b>But</b> if it is written in <b>a scribe’s handwriting,</b> even if it includes the signature of one <b>witness,</b> the child’s lineage is <b>not</b> unflawed, but rather he is a <i>mamzer</i>, as the bill of divorce is completely invalid.

### Part 2
<b>And Shmuel says: Even</b> where it is written in <b>a scribe’s handwriting and</b> it has the signature of <b>a witness,</b> the lineage of the child is unflawed, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (87b): In the case of a bill of divorce in which <b>the scribe’s handwriting</b> is recognizable <b>and</b> there is one <b>witness</b> signed, it is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And Rav</b> would respond: <b>Is</b> that case <b>comparable? There,</b> in that case, the mishna indicates that the woman <b>may marry <i>ab initio</i>.</b> Therefore, it must be a case where the scribe also signed as a second witness. But <b>here,</b> in the case of this mishna, the bill of divorce is invalid and the woman may not remarry; it is only if she remarried and had a child that his lineage is rendered unflawed <b>after the fact.</b> Therefore, it must be referring to a case where the husband wrote it.

### Part 4
<b>And Shmuel,</b> who holds that both cases are referring to a bill of divorce that was written by a scribe but not signed by the scribe as one of the witnesses, would respond that the contradiction is <b>not difficult. That</b> mishna, where the bill of divorce is rendered valid <i>ab initio</i>, is referring <b>to</b> the handwriting of <b>an expert scribe,</b> who can presumably be relied upon to have written the bill of divorce properly and only according to the husband’s instructions, <b>and this</b> mishna is referring <b>to</b> the handwriting of <b>a scribe who is not expert.</b> Since the bill of divorce was not signed by two witnesses, there is concern that the scribe did not write it properly.

### Part 5
<b>And similarly, Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rav: <b>We learned</b> that the mishna is referring to <b>his handwriting. Rabbi Elazar,</b> assuming that Rabbi Yoḥanan was explaining the middle clause, <b>said to him: Aren’t there</b> signatures of <b>witnesses in</b> the bill of divorce? Why is the husband’s handwriting necessary? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> I was referring <b>to the latter clause,</b> in which there is only one witness.

### Part 6
§ With regard to the three invalid bills of divorce mentioned in the mishna, <b>sometimes Rav said</b> that if the woman remarries based on one of these bills of divorce <b>she must leave</b> her second husband, and <b>sometimes Rav said</b> that <b>she</b> need <b>not leave.</b>

### Part 7
<b>How so?</b> How can the contradiction between Rav’s statements be explained? If <b>she</b> already <b>has children</b> from her second husband then <b>she</b> need <b>not leave</b> him, as, if she is required to leave him there will be slander that their children are <i>mamzerim</i>. But if <b>she does not have children</b> from him, <b>she must leave</b> him.

### Part 8
<b>Mar Zutra bar Toviya raises an objection</b> to Rav’s opinion from a mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 30b). With regard to a woman whose husband died childless [<i>yevama</i>] but who is prohibited from marrying her late husband’s brother [<i>yavam</i>] because he is a forbidden relative to her, not only is she herself exempt from levirate marriage, but she causes any rival wives of hers to be exempt as well, even if they are not forbidden relatives to the brother. The mishna lists fifteen examples of such forbidden relatives (<i>Yevamot</i> 2a). <b>And</b> if <b>any of these</b> fifteen women <b>had undergone a betrothal or divorce</b> whose status is <b>uncertain</b> with the deceased brother, <b>those</b> rival wives <b>must perform the ritual through which the <i>yavam</i> frees the <i>yevama</i> of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>] and</b> may <b>not enter into levirate marriage,</b> since they are possibly the rival wives of a forbidden relative.

### Part 9
<b>How</b> could there be <b>a betrothal</b> whose status is <b>uncertain?</b> If <b>he threw her</b> money or a document as <b>betrothal</b> in the public domain, and the item was <b>possibly closer to her,</b> whereby she could acquire the object and become betrothed, and <b>possibly closer to him,</b> preventing her from acquiring it, <b>this is</b> a case of <b>a betrothal</b> whose status is <b>uncertain.</b>

### Part 10
How can there be <b>a divorce</b> whose status is <b>uncertain?</b> It is in the cases of invalid bills of divorce mentioned in the mishna here: A bill of divorce that the husband <b>wrote in his handwriting but has no</b> signatures of <b>witnesses on</b> the document at all, a case where <b>there are</b> signatures of <b>witnesses on</b> the document <b>but there is no date</b> written <b>on it,</b> and a case where <b>there is a date</b> written <b>on it but it contains only one witness.</b> In each of the three cases, <b>this is</b> considered <b>a divorce</b> whose status is <b>uncertain.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And if you say</b> that despite this woman’s problematic divorce <b>she</b> need <b>not leave</b> her second husband, <b>her rival wife</b> from her first marriage might <b>come to enter into levirate marriage</b> after the first husband’s death, assuming that she was already divorced. This would violate the ruling of the mishna in tractate <i>Yevamot</i> that she may not do so, as the status of the divorce is uncertain and therefore it is uncertain whether she is the rival wife of a forbidden relative.

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>She may enter into levirate marriage, and</b> there is <b>no</b> problem <b>with that,</b> as the difficulty with the bill of divorce <b>is</b> merely <b>a concern by rabbinic law.</b> By Torah law it is a complete bill of divorce, and the rival wife is fit for levirate marriage.

### Part 13
Contrary to Rav’s opinion that a woman who remarries based on one of these bills of divorce must leave her second husband unless they have children, <b>Levi says</b> that <b>she</b> is <b>never</b> required to <b>leave</b> him, whether or not they have children. <b>And similarly, Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>she</b> is <b>never</b> required to <b>leave</b> him.

### Part 14
<b>And similarly, Rabbi Yoḥanan said to the sons of Rabbi Ḥalafta of Huna: Your father said the following</b> two statements that I heard from him: That <b>she</b> is <b>never</b> required to <b>leave</b> him, <b>and</b> that <b>a <i>kartzit</i> in the sheaf does not disqualify water of purification</b> (see Numbers 19:17–19). Even if a <i>kartzit</i> drinks from this water, it may still be sprinkled on a person in order to purify him from ritual impurity imparted by a corpse.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>What is a <i>kartzit</i>? Abaye said</b> that it is a species of <b>fly [<i>didveta</i>] that is</b> found <b>between the sheaves.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rav Daniel bar Rav Ketina raises an objection</b> to this ruling from the Mishna (<i>Para</i> 9:3): <b>All birds disqualify water of purification</b> by drinking from it, because some of the water spills from the bird’s beak back into the basin after being disqualified by having been in the bird’s mouth. This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all birds <b>except for the pigeon, because it sucks</b> the water, which prevents it from spilling back. <b>And if it is so</b> that a <i>kartzit</i> does not disqualify water of purification, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that all birds disqualify <b>except for</b> the <b>pigeon and</b> the <b><i>kartzit</i>.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: The matter <b>is not clear-cut, as,</b> while <b>a large</b> <i>kartzit</i> <b>does not disqualify</b> the water, <b>a small one does disqualify</b> it. This ruling is not mentioned in the mishna, as it is not common to all species of <i>kartzit</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>And how</b> small must a <i>kartzit</i> be to disqualify water of purification? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Ami</b> who said: The size is <b>up to an olive-bulk.</b>

### Part 18
§ It is stated in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Even if</b> there are no signatures of witnesses on the document, but rather he handed it to her in the presence of two witnesses, it is a valid bill of divorce. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar with regard to bills of divorce.</b> But <b>when I said this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>before Shmuel, he said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabbi Elazar <b>with regard to</b> monetary <b>documents as well.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>But does Rav hold</b> that <b>with regard to</b> monetary <b>documents</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>not</b> in accordance with Rabbi Elazar? <b>Doesn’t</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>teach</b> in the mishna that on the basis of this bill of divorce a woman <b>can collect</b> the amount written in her marriage contract even <b>from liened property?</b> Apparently, Rabbi Elazar’s ruling has monetary ramifications as well.

### Part 20
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Elazar made two statements,</b> i.e., his ruling was both with regard to divorce and with regard to monetary documents. <b>And Rav holds in accordance with his</b> opinion <b>with regard to one</b> issue, i.e., divorce, <b>and disagrees with his</b> opinion <b>with regard to one</b> issue, monetary documents.

### Part 21
<b>And similarly, Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar with regard to bills of divorce. And Rabbi Yannai says:</b> This <b>does not have even the trace of a bill of divorce.</b>

### Part 22
The Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Yannai not hold</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar</b> at all, as opposed to the other <i>amora’im</i>? The Gemara answers: Rather, <b>this is what</b> Rabbi Yannai <b>is saying: According to the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Elazar, this bill of divorce <b>does not have even the trace of a bill of divorce.</b>

### Part 23
<b>And similarly, Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar with regard to bills of divorce. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This <b>does not have even the trace of a bill of divorce.</b>

### Part 24
The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan does not hold</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar</b> at all. The Gemara answers: Rather, <b>this is what</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>is saying: According to the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Elazar, this <b>does not have even the trace of a bill of divorce.</b>

### Part 25
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Zavda sent</b> the following request <b>to Marei bar Mar: Ask Rav Huna</b> whether the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar with regard to bills of divorce or</b> whether the <b><i>halakha</i> is not</b> in accordance with his opinion.

### Part 26
<b>Meanwhile,</b> before this request reached him, <b>Rav Huna died. Rabba, son of</b> Rav Huna, <b>said to</b> Marei bar Mar: <b>My father said in the name of Rava like this:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar with regard to bills of divorce. And our teachers who are well-versed in matters of <i>halakha</i></b> also <b>said in the name of our teacher</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar with regard to bills of divorce, as Rav Ḥama bar Gurya,</b> referred to as our teachers, <b>says</b> that our teacher <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar with regard to bills of divorce.</b>

### Part 27
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of this statement: <b>And our colleagues who are well versed in matters of <i>halakha</i> and the disciples of our teacher said in the name of our teacher</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar with regard to bills of divorce, as Rav Ḥisda,</b> Rabba bar Rav Huna’s colleague, <b>said that Rav Ḥama bar Gurya,</b> his teacher, <b>said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar with regard to bills of divorce.</b>

### Part 28
<b>And similarly, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael he said that <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> the <i>amora</i>, <b>says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar with regard to bills of divorce.</b>

### Part 29
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to a case of <b>two</b> men <b>who sent</b> their wives <b>two identical bills of divorce</b> with an agent, as both their names and their wives’ names are identical, <b>and</b> the two bills of divorce <b>were mixed up,</b> the agent <b>should hand both</b> bills of divorce <b>to this</b> wife <b>and both</b> of them <b>to that</b> wife, so that each wife definitely receives her bill of divorce, although it is unclear which one is hers. <b>Therefore,</b> if <b>one of</b> the bills of divorce <b>was lost</b> before it was given to both women, <b>the other is void,</b> because it is unknown which bill of divorce was meant for which woman.

### Part 30
With regard to <b>five</b> husbands <b>who wrote a general wording in the bill of divorce,</b> i.e., who wrote one common bill of divorce for their wives with a single formula, writing that <b>so-and-so divorces</b> his wife <b>so-and-so, and so-and-so</b> divorces <b>so-and-so, and the witnesses</b> signed <b>below,</b> in this case <b>all</b> of these bills of divorce that were combined into one bill <b>are valid; and</b> the bill <b>must be handed to each and every</b> wife individually, so they will all be divorced by it.

### Part 31
If the scribe <b>was writing</b> a separate <b>formula</b> in the bill of divorce <b>for each and every</b> couple, <b>and the witnesses</b> signed <b>below,</b> the formula <b>with which the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>are read is valid.</b> In other words, the formula directly underneath which they signed is valid, and the others are not valid.

### Part 32
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that the two bills of divorce that were mixed up should be handed to both wives? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> It <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as had</b> it <b>been</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, since he says</b> that <b>witnesses of the transmission</b> of the bill of divorce <b>effect</b> the divorce, handing both bills of divorce to both wives would not enable the divorce of each woman to take effect. This is because the witnesses <b>do not know</b> at the time of the transmission <b>with which one of</b> the bills of divorce <b>she is being divorced.</b>

### Part 33
<b>Abaye said: You</b> can <b>even say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar. Say that</b> although <b>Rabbi Elazar requires the writing</b> of the bill of divorce to be <b>for her sake,</b> i.e., with the specific woman and man for whom it is designated in mind, <b>does he require giving</b> it to her <b>for her sake?</b> Although the transmission of the bill of divorce is what causes it to take effect, it need not be done with the designated woman in mind. Therefore, the divorce here is valid, as the bill of divorce was definitely given to the wife for whom it was intended.

### Part 34
§ It is stated in the mishna: With regard to <b>five</b> husbands <b>who wrote a general wording</b> in a bill of divorce, all of them can divorce their wives with it. But if a separate formula was written for each, only the last one is valid. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances of</b> the case of the <b>general wording,</b> and <b>what are the circumstances of</b> the case of the separate <b>formula</b> that was written for each couple?

### Part 35
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If there is <b>one date</b> and one formula written <b>for all of them,</b> such as: On such-and-such a date so-and-so divorced so-and-so, and so-and-so divorced so-and-so, <b>that is a general wording.</b> If a separate <b>date</b> and formula was written <b>for each and every one</b> of them, <b>that is</b> considered a separate <b>formula.</b>

### Part 36
