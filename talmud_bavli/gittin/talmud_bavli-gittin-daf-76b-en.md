<b>or</b> whether <b>she is not divorced.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Abaye said:</b> It may be that Antipatris is in Judea and Kefar Otnai is in the Galilee. The mishna can be explained as follows: The husband was <b>saying</b> a statement including <b>two conditions to her: If I arrive in the Galilee</b> then this <b>will be a bill of divorce immediately, or if I will tarry on the way for thirty days and I do not come</b> back home, this <b>will be</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> If <b>he reached Antipatris and returned</b> within thirty days, <b>as he did not arrive in the Galilee and he also did not tarry for thirty days,</b> then <b>his condition is void</b> and his wife is not divorced.

### Part 3
The continuation of the mishna taught: <b>This is your bill of divorce if I do not come</b> back <b>from now until</b> the conclusion of <b>thirty days.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Akko is in a country overseas,</b> and is not considered part of Eretz Yisrael? <b>But didn’t Rav Safra say: When the Sages would take leave from one another</b> before departing Eretz Yisrael, <b>they would take</b> their <b>leave in Akko, because it is prohibited to leave from Eretz Yisrael to</b> go <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael? This indicates that Akko is within Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said:</b> The husband was <b>saying</b> a statement including <b>two conditions to her: If I arrive in a country overseas,</b> then this <b>will be</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce immediately,</b> or <b>if I tarry thirty days on the way and I do not come</b> back home, this <b>will be</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> If <b>he reached Akko and returned, as he did not reach a country overseas and he also did not tarry for thirty days, his condition is void</b> and his wife is not divorced.

### Part 5
§ The continuation of the mishna states: If a husband said to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce</b> if at <b>any time I will depart</b> from your presence for thirty consecutive days, then even if he was continually going and coming, going and coming, since he was not secluded with her during these thirty days this is a valid bill of divorce. The Gemara challenges: <b>But did he not pass</b> from her presence during this time, as he was going and coming the entire time? <b>Rav Huna said: What</b> is the meaning of the term <b>your presence</b> in this context? It means <b>sexual intercourse.</b> His actual condition was that if he will not engage in sexual intercourse with her for thirty days then the bill of divorce will be valid. <b>And why does he call</b> sexual intercourse <b>your presence? He employed a euphemistic expression</b> when he made his condition.

### Part 6
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> disagreed and <b>said: Actually,</b> the husband means <b>literally: Your presence,</b> i.e., that he would not be in his wife’s presence for thirty consecutive days. <b>Is</b> the mishna <b>teaching</b> that <b>she is divorced</b> immediately? No, it <b>is teaching</b> only that <b>this is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> This means that although the condition was not fulfilled during these thirty days, since he was not secluded with her this <b>is not considered</b> to be <b>an outdated bill of divorce,</b> which the Sages said may not be used for divorce. <b>And when,</b> at some point in the future, <b>the thirty days</b> during which he does pass from her presence <b>are fulfilled, this will be</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara comments that it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:10) <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If one says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce</b> if at <b>any time I will depart from your presence</b> for <b>thirty</b> consecutive <b>days, and he was going and coming, going and coming</b> for the entire thirty days, <b>since he was not secluded with her</b> during that time, <b>this is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce. And one is not concerned</b> that it is now considered <b>an outdated bill of divorce, because he was not secluded with her.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> there be a <b>concern</b> that <b>perhaps he appeased</b> his wife during this time that he was going and coming, and he was secluded with her. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: So said my father, my teacher,</b> Rav Huna, <b>in the name of Rav:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a situation <b>where</b> the husband <b>says: She is deemed credible by me to say that I did not come.</b> Since the husband states explicitly that he believes her about this, if she said that he was not secluded with her then the bill of divorce remains valid.

### Part 9
<b>There are</b> those <b>who teach this</b> statement of Rav Huna in the name of Rav <b>with regard to the mishna</b> mentioned later on, which says that if the husband said to his wife: This is your bill of divorce <b>from now if I do not come</b> back <b>from now until</b> the conclusion of <b>twelve months, and he died within twelve months, this is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> there be a <b>concern</b> that <b>perhaps he appeased</b> his wife during this time and was secluded with her. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: So said my father, my teacher,</b> Rav Huna, <b>in the name of Rav:</b> The mishna is referring to a situation <b>where</b> the husband <b>says: She is deemed credible by me to say that I did not come,</b> and he did not appease her.

### Part 10
The Gemara comments: Concerning <b>the one who taught that</b> statement of Rav Huna in the name of Rav <b>with regard to the mishna, all the more so</b> would he teach this statement <b>with regard to the <i>baraita</i>.</b> Since he was constantly going and coming, the bill of divorce would be valid only if the husband stated that he trusts his wife to say that she was not secluded with him.

### Part 11
Concerning <b>the one who taught this</b> statement <b>with regard to the <i>baraita</i>,</b> it is possible that he taught this only with regard to the <i>baraita</i>, <b>but with regard to the mishna,</b> this is not the case, <b>as he did not come</b> back home within twelve months, but rather died. Therefore, even if he did not specify that he trusts his wife to say whether or not they were secluded, there is no concern that perhaps he was secluded with her without anyone knowing about it.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a husband says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce if I do not come</b> back <b>from now until</b> the conclusion of <b>twelve months, and he died within twelve months, it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> This is because the bill of divorce cannot take effect after the husband’s death. As a result, she is bound by a levirate bond if her husband has no children.

### Part 13
By contrast, if he said to her: <b>This is your bill of divorce from now if I do not come</b> back <b>from now until</b> the conclusion of <b>twelve months, and he died within twelve months, this is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b> This is because the bill of divorce takes effect retroactively. Since he did not return within the year the condition was fulfilled.

### Part 14
If a husband said to others: <b>If I do not come</b> back <b>from now until</b> the conclusion of <b>twelve months, write and give a bill of divorce to my wife,</b> and <b>they wrote a bill of divorce during</b> the <b>twelve months and gave</b> it to her <b>after twelve months</b> had elapsed, <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce</b> because he instructed them to write the bill of divorce only after twelve months had elapsed.

### Part 15
Similarly, if he said to others: <b>Write and give a bill of divorce to my wife if I do not come</b> back <b>from now until</b> the conclusion of <b>twelve months,</b> and <b>they wrote</b> it <b>during</b> the <b>twelve months but gave</b> it to her <b>after</b> the <b>twelve months, it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce</b> because he instructed them to write the bill of divorce only after twelve months had elapsed, when it was clear that he did not come back. <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> In a case <b>like this,</b> it is a valid <b>bill of divorce,</b> as he did not tell them when to write the bill of divorce. Rather, he stipulated only the time of giving.

### Part 16
If <b>they wrote</b> the bill of divorce <b>after twelve months</b> had elapsed, <b>and gave</b> it <b>after twelve months</b> had elapsed, <b>but</b> in the interim the husband <b>died, if</b> the giving of <b>the bill of divorce</b> occurred <b>before</b> the husband’s <b>death this is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce. But if</b> the husband’s <b>death</b> occurred <b>before</b> the giving of <b>the bill of divorce</b> it <b>is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce. And if it is not known</b> which occurred first, <b>this is</b> a case <b>where</b> the Sages <b>said</b> there is uncertainty whether <b>she is divorced or</b> whether <b>she is not divorced.</b>

### Part 17
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that if a husband said to his wife: This is your bill of divorce if I do not come back from now until the conclusion of twelve months, and the husband died within that time, it is not a valid bill of divorce. With regard to this it is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Our Rabbis</b> disagreed and <b>permitted her to marry</b> without requiring <i>ḥalitza</i> because they hold that it is a valid bill of divorce.

### Part 18
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Who are our Rabbis</b> mentioned in this <i>baraita</i>? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> They are <b>the court that permitted</b> consuming <b>oil</b> manufactured by gentiles. Why do they hold that this is a valid bill of divorce? <b>They hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who says: The date</b> written <b>in a document proves</b> when <b>it</b> takes effect. Whenever a document is dated it is assumed that the intent is for it to take effect from that date even if it does not state explicitly: From now.

### Part 19
<b>Rabbi Abba, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Yehuda Nesia, son of Rabban Gamliel</b> the <b>son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>taught</b> this matter, <b>and all of his colleagues [<i>siato</i>] did not concede to his</b> opinion. <b>And some say</b> that <b>all of his life [<i>she’ato</i>]</b> they did not concede to his opinion.

### Part 20
<b>Rabbi Elazar said to a certain elderly man</b> who was a member of Rabbi Yehuda Nesia’s court: <b>When you permitted</b> this woman to remarry, did <b>you permit her</b> to remarry <b>immediately</b> after her husband died <b>or did you permit her</b> only <b>after twelve months?</b> Did <b>you permit her</b> to remarry <b>immediately</b> after the husband died, <b>because he will</b> certainly <b>not come</b> back? <b>Or perhaps you permitted her</b> to remarry only <b>after twelve months, because</b> only then was the husband’s <b>condition fulfilled?</b>

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>And let his dilemma be raised</b> also with regard to <b>the mishna,</b> in the case where the husband said to his wife: This is your bill of divorce <b>from now if I do not come</b> back <b>from now until</b> the conclusion of <b>twelve months, and he died within</b> the <b>twelve months, this is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce. Is</b> the bill of divorce valid <b>immediately</b> once the husband dies, <b>because he will</b> certainly <b>not come</b> back? <b>Or perhaps</b> the bill of divorce is valid only <b>after twelve months</b> have elapsed, <b>because</b> only then was <b>his condition fulfilled?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, indeed so;</b> this question can be asked with regard to the case in the mishna. <b>And</b> Rabbi Elazar asked that particular elder <b>because</b> he <b>was</b> present <b>at that incident,</b> and he could answer based on what actually occurred.

### Part 22
§ <b>Abaye said: Everyone concedes</b> that in a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>said</b> to his wife that the bill of divorce will take effect <b>once the sun emerges from its sheath</b> [<b><i>minnartikah</i>],</b>
