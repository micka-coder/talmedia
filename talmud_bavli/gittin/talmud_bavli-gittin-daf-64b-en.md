### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>This matter,</b> the presumption that an agent performs his agency, applies only when its application leads <b>to stringency,</b> as there is a concern that the agent performed his agency. <b>However,</b> when its application leads <b>to leniency, no,</b> the presumption does not apply.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> one <b>deem the wife herself credible,</b> based <b>on</b> the statement of <b>Rav Hamnuna, as Rav Hamnuna says:</b> A <b>woman who said to her husband: You divorced me, is deemed credible,</b> as there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>a woman</b> would <b>not be insolent in the presence of her husband</b> and lie.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>This matter applies only</b> in a case <b>where there is no</b> factor <b>that supports her</b> claim, as the presumption is that she would not be so insolent as to tell a lie that has no basis. <b>However,</b> in a case <b>where</b> there is a factor <b>that supports her</b> claim, as in this case both the husband and the third party claim that the husband sent a bill of divorce, <b>she</b> would <b>indeed be insolent.</b> Therefore, her claim that she was divorced is accepted only if she can produce the bill of divorce.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a betrothed young woman, she and her father</b> are each eligible to <b>receive her bill of divorce,</b> and the divorce takes effect at the moment that either of them receives the bill of divorce. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Two hands do not</b> have the right to <b>acquire</b> an item on behalf of one person <b>as one. Rather, her father alone receives her bill of divorce</b> on her behalf. <b>And</b> there is another principle: <b>Any</b> female <b>who is unable to safeguard her bill of divorce is unable to be divorced.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> the Rabbis, who stated the unattributed first opinion in the mishna, and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree? The Rabbis hold: The Merciful One grants</b> the betrothed young woman <b>an additional hand,</b> beyond the hand of her father, who can receive the bill of divorce on her behalf. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds: In a place,</b> i.e., situation, where <b>her father</b> is alive, <b>her hand is nothing</b> and she is ineligible to receive her bill of divorce.

### Part 6
The mishna teaches: <b>And any</b> woman <b>who is unable to safeguard her bill of divorce</b> is unable to be divorced. <b>The Sages taught: A minor girl who knows</b> how <b>to safeguard her bill of divorce can be divorced, and</b> one <b>who does not know</b> how <b>to safeguard her bill of divorce cannot be divorced. And which is</b> the <b>minor girl</b> who <b>knows</b> how <b>to safeguard her bill of divorce?</b> It is <b>any</b> minor girl <b>who safeguards her bill of divorce and something else.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>saying</b> in the statement: Who safeguards her bill of divorce and something else? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>this is</b> what <b>he is saying: Any</b> minor <b>who safeguards something else due to her bill of divorce,</b> i.e., she lost her bill of divorce itself but she guards something else that she mistook for her bill of divorce.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Huna bar Manoaḥ objects to this: That</b> minor girl <b>is merely an imbecile,</b> as she keeps something else in lieu of her bill of divorce. <b>Rather, Rav Huna bar Manoaḥ says in the name of Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika:</b> The reference is to <b>any</b> girl <b>who distinguishes between her bill of divorce and something else,</b> and safeguards her bill of divorce and does not safeguard less significant items.

### Part 9
Apropos minors, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi says:</b> If one gives a child <b>a pebble and he throws it</b> away and one gives him <b>a nut and he takes it,</b> he is capable of distinguishing between items of value and worthless items, and <b>he acquires</b> property <b>for himself but does not acquire</b> property <b>on</b> behalf of <b>others.</b> If the child develops to the extent that he is given <b>an item and he returns it</b> to its owners <b>later,</b> because he understands the concept of ownership, <b>he acquires</b> property <b>both for himself and on</b> behalf of <b>others.</b>

### Part 10
Rav Yehuda continued. <b>When I stated</b> Rabbi Asi’s ruling <b>before Shmuel he said to me: This and that are one.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>This and that are one? Rav Ḥisda says:</b> With regard to <b>both this</b> child <b>and that</b> child, each <b>acquires</b> property <b>for himself but does not acquire</b> property <b>on</b> behalf of <b>others,</b> and there is no distinction in this regard between the developmental stages of a minor.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Ḥinnana of Vardania raises an objection</b> based on what was taught in a mishna (<i>Eiruvin</i> 79b): <b>How does one merge</b> the courtyards that open <b>into the alleyway</b> on behalf of all the residents of the alleyway? <b>He places a barrel</b> filled with his wine <b>and says: This is for all the residents of the alleyway. And he</b> may <b>confer possession</b> of the wine <b>to</b> the other residents of the alleyway <b>by means of his adult son or daughter, or by means of his Hebrew slave or maidservant.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this maidservant? If she developed two</b> pubic <b>hairs,</b> indicating that she reached majority, <b>what</b> is she <b>doing with</b> the owner of the barrel? A Hebrew maidservant is emancipated when she reaches puberty. <b>Rather, is</b> the reference here <b>not</b> to a case <b>where she did not</b> yet <b>develop two</b> pubic <b>hairs,</b> and she is a minor, <b>and it is taught</b> that she can <b>acquire on</b> behalf of <b>others?</b> Apparently, a minor can acquire property on behalf of other people.

### Part 13
The Gemara rejects this proof: The <b>merging of alleyways is different,</b> as it is an ordinance <b>by rabbinic law.</b> The Sages ruled leniently with regard to this rabbinic ordinance and allowed a minor to acquire property on behalf of others.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> Rav Ḥinnana of <b>Vardonia was silent</b> and had no response. The Gemara asks: <b>What could he have said</b> in response? The Gemara answers that he could have responded: <b>All</b> ordinances <b>that the Sages instituted,</b>
