### Part 1
<b>Perhaps he will admit</b> his obligation <b>and become exempt</b> from his obligation to pay, for one who admits that he is required to pay a penalty before the court obligates him to pay it is exempt.

### Part 2
<b>And you could raise this dilemma according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> as well, as <b>the Rabbis state</b> that <b>a person cannot transfer ownership</b> of <b>an entity that has not yet come into the world only</b> in a case <b>such as the produce</b> of <b>a date palm, which now, at least, is not</b> in the world. <b>However, here,</b> the <b>ox is standing and</b> the <b>slave is standing,</b> and there is no need for any change in the reality. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case?

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Abba said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof based on a halakhic exposition of the verse that details those who may partake of <i>teruma</i>. The verse states: “But if a priest buys any person, the purchase of his money, he may eat of it; and those who are born in his house, they may eat of his bread” (Leviticus 22:11), and the Sages expound as follows: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And those who are born in his house”? If</b> a slave, who is <b>the purchase of</b> his <b>money,</b> may <b>partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>, then in the case of <b>those</b> slaves <b>who are born</b> to the priest <b>in his house,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> that they should be able to partake of <i>teruma</i>?

### Part 4
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If so,</b> if the <i>halakha</i> that a born slave may partake of <i>teruma</i> is derived only due to this <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>I would have said: Just as</b> with regard to <b>the purchase of</b> his <b>money</b> it is only <b>one who has monetary value</b> that <b>partakes, so too,</b> with regard to <b>one born in</b> his <b>house,</b> only <b>one who has monetary value partakes. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the same <i>halakha</i> applies <b>when</b> a born slave <b>is not worth anything,</b> e.g., in the case of a newborn, who cannot perform any labor? <b>The verse states: “Those who are born in his house,” in any case,</b> regardless of their present monetary value.

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I still say</b> that perhaps <b>one born in</b> the priest’s <b>house</b> may <b>partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>whether he has monetary value</b> or <b>whether he does not have monetary value.</b> But with regard to a slave <b>purchased of</b> the priest’s <b>money,</b> when <b>he has monetary value, he</b> may <b>partake;</b> when <b>he does not have monetary value, he</b> may <b>not partake. The verse states: “The purchase of his money…and those who are born in his house,</b> they may eat of his bread” (Leviticus 22:11). The verse compares the two, indicating: <b>Just as one born in</b> the priest’s <b>house may partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>although he is not worth anything, so too, the purchase of his money</b> may <b>partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>although he is not worth anything.</b> In any event, it is clear from this <i>baraita</i> that it is possible for a slave to have no monetary value.

### Part 6
Rabbi Abba now states his proof. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>a slave whose master sold him</b> to another person only <b>with regard to</b> the <b>penalty is sold, is there a slave that cannot be sold with regard to the penalty?</b> Even if he cannot perform any labor, he still has value in that he can be sold with regard to the penalty. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, there is</b> the case of <b>a slave who has a wound that will cause him to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>].</b> Since he will die from an injury that is already present, one would not be required to pay a penalty if one’s ox gored him.

### Part 7
The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t</b> he <b>fit to stand before</b> his master in honor, even if he cannot perform any other service, so he has some value as a slave? The Gemara answers: This <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a slave who is not only a <i>tereifa</i> and for whom there is no penalty, but is also <b>disgusting [<i>menuvval</i>] or afflicted with boils [<i>mukeh sheḥin</i>].</b> It would not be a display of honor for the slave to stand before the master, and therefore he is worthless. This question of the Gemara remains unresolved.

### Part 8
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In the case of <b>one who is a half-slave half-freeman who betrothed a free woman, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara discusses the elements of this question: <b>If you say</b> that this should be compared to <b>a Jewish man who said to a Jewish woman: Become betrothed to half of me,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>she is betrothed,</b> this is <b>because she is fit to</b> marry <b>all of him.</b> However, in <b>this</b> case one could say that <b>she is not fit to</b> marry <b>all of him</b> because he is a half-slave, so it is not a valid betrothal.

### Part 9
<b>However, if you say</b> that this should be compared to the case of <b>a Jewish man who betroths half a woman,</b> where the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>she is not betrothed</b> because <b>he left</b> a portion of the woman <b>out of his acquisition,</b> as betrothal acquires a complete woman and not half of a woman, <b>but this slave did not leave</b> any part of her <b>out of his acquisition,</b> as his Jewish half betrothed her fully. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case?

### Part 10
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof based on that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If an ox <b>killed a half-slave half-freeman,</b> then the owner of the ox <b>gives half</b> of <b>a penalty,</b> i.e., fifteen shekels, <b>to his master and half</b> of <b>a ransom,</b> i.e., half of the value of the deceased, <b>to his heirs. And if you say</b> that <b>his betrothal is not</b> a valid <b>betrothal,</b> and the half-slave half-freeman may not marry a woman, then <b>from where does he have heirs?</b> It must be that he may betroth and marry a woman, and as a result he can have heirs.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says:</b> This is referring to a case where the ox did not actually kill him. Rather, <b>it made him a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> and a <i>tereifa</i> is like a dead person. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of: <b>His heirs?</b> It means the half-slave half-freeman <b>himself.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rava said</b> that there are <b>two refutations of</b> your <b>statement: One</b> is <b>that it teaches: His heirs,</b> and it is not reasonable to say that this is referring to the victim himself. <b>And furthermore, it</b> is referring to <b>ransom</b> here, <b>and Reish Lakish says: Ransom is paid only after</b> the <b>death</b> of the victim but not while he is still alive, even if he is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rather, Rava says:</b> When the <i>baraita</i> states that half of the ransom is given to his heirs, it means that <b>it is fitting</b> for heirs <b>to take</b> the ransom, <b>but he does not</b> actually <b>have</b> heirs.

### Part 13
§ <b>Rava says: Just as</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one who betroths half a woman, she is not betrothed, so too,</b> if there is <b>a half-maidservant half-free woman who was betrothed,</b> then <b>her betrothal is not</b> a valid <b>betrothal.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara says: <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> in public: <b>Just as</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one who betroths half a woman, she is not betrothed, so too,</b> if there is <b>a half-maidservant half-free woman who was betrothed,</b> then <b>her betrothal is not</b> a valid <b>betrothal. Rav Ḥisda said to him</b> as a question: <b>Are</b> the cases <b>comparable? There,</b> where he betroths half a woman, <b>he leaves</b> a portion of the woman <b>out of his acquisition.</b> That is why the betrothal does not take effect. However, <b>here,</b> she was a half-maidservant half-free woman when he betrothed her, and <b>he did not leave</b> a portion of the woman <b>out of his acquisition,</b> so the betrothal should take effect.

### Part 15
<b>Rabba bar Rav Huna went back and placed an interpreter before him</b> so that he could tell the public that he had been wrong, <b>and he interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically.</b> The verse states: <b>“And let this stumbling-block be under your hand”</b> (Isaiah 3:6). <b>A person does not understand statements of Torah unless he stumbles in them.</b> Therefore, I retract my previous statement and say that <b>although</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that in the case of <b>one who betroths half a woman, she is not betrothed, however,</b> if there was <b>a half-maidservant half-free woman who was betrothed,</b> then <b>her betrothal is</b> a valid <b>betrothal. What is the reason</b> for the distinction? <b>There, he left</b> a portion of the woman <b>out of his acquisition; here, he did not leave</b> a portion of the woman <b>out of his acquisition.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rav Sheshet said</b> in response to this: <b>Just as</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one who betroths half a woman, she is not betrothed, so too,</b> if there is <b>a half-maidservant half-free woman who was betrothed,</b> then <b>her betrothal is not</b> a valid <b>betrothal. And if a person whispers to you [<i>leḥashekha</i>], saying,</b> based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Who is</b> the <b>designated maidservant</b> mentioned in the Torah? <b>This is</b> a woman who is <b>a half-maidservant half-free woman who is betrothed to a Hebrew slave, apparently</b> indicating that <b>she can be betrothed,</b> then <b>say to him: Go to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, for he says</b> that this is not referring to a woman who is a half-slave, but rather <b>to a Canaanite maidservant betrothed to a Hebrew slave.</b>

### Part 17
Rav Sheshet questions his own statement: <b>But can a Canaanite maidservant be betrothed? Rather, what have you to say: What</b> is the meaning of the word <b>betrothed</b> in the statement of Rabbi Yishmael? It means that <b>she is designated</b> for him, and it is not actual betrothal. <b>Here, also,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>what</b> does it mean that the Canaanite maidservant is <b>betrothed</b> to a Hebrew slave? It means that she is <b>designated</b> to cohabit with him, but they are not in fact betrothed.

### Part 18
<b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> If there was <b>a half-maidservant half-free woman who was betrothed to Reuven, and</b> afterward <b>she was emancipated</b> entirely, <b>and she went back and was betrothed to Shimon</b> his brother, <b>and both</b> brothers <b>died</b> without children, then <b>she enters into levirate marriage with Levi,</b> the third brother, because she was considered to be the complete wife of only one of the brothers,
