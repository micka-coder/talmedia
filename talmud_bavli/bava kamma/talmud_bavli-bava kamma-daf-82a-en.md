### Part 1
The Gemara further questions the number of Joshua’s stipulations: <b>But when Rabbi Avin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>both a tree that leans into the field of another and a tree that is close to a boundary</b> with another field, the owner of the tree <b>brings</b> the first fruits of the tree <b>and recites</b> the accompanying declaration, as described in Deuteronomy 26:5–10, <b>as</b> it was <b>on this condition</b> that <b>Joshua apportioned Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to the Jewish people.</b> This is an additional stipulation by Joshua, which means that there are more than ten.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, who</b> is the one who <b>taught</b> the <i>baraita</i> that deals with the <b>ten conditions that Joshua stipulated? It is Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi,</b> an <i>amora</i>. Therefore, Rabbi Yoḥanan, another <i>amora</i>, can disagree with it. <b>Rav Geviha from Bei Katil teaches</b> this <b>explicitly</b> in his version of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Tanḥum and Rabbi Berayes say in the name of a certain elder, and who is that</b> elder? It is <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: Joshua stipulated ten conditions.</b>

### Part 3
§ The Sages taught that <b>Ezra</b> the Scribe <b>instituted ten ordinances:</b> He instituted <b>that</b> communities <b>read</b> the Torah <b>on Shabbat in the afternoon; and they</b> also <b>read</b> the Torah <b>on</b> every <b>Monday and Thursday; and</b> the courts convene and <b>judge</b> every <b>Monday and Thursday; and one does laundry on Thursday; and one eats garlic on Shabbat eve. And</b> Ezra further instituted <b>that a woman should rise early and bake</b> bread on those days when she wants to bake; <b>and that a woman should don a breechcloth; and that a woman should</b> first <b>comb</b> her hair <b>and</b> only then <b>immerse</b> in a ritual bath after being ritually impure; <b>and that peddlers</b> of cosmetics and perfumes <b>should travel around through</b> all <b>the towns. And</b> Ezra further <b>instituted</b> the requirement of <b>immersion for those who experienced a seminal emission.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara analyzes these ordinances, the first of which is <b>that</b> communities <b>shall read</b> the Torah <b>on Shabbat afternoon.</b> This Gemara explains that this ordinance was instituted <b>due to those who sit</b> idly on street <b>corners,</b> who do not attend the synagogue during the week.

### Part 5
The Gemara discusses the second of Ezra’s ordinances: <b>And that they should read</b> the Torah <b>on</b> every <b>Monday and Thursday.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Did Ezra institute</b> this practice? <b>But it was instituted from the beginning,</b> i.e., long before his time. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; <b>and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water”</b> (Exodus 15:22). <b>Those who interpret verses</b> metaphorically <b>said</b> that <b>water</b> here is referring to <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated</b> metaphorically, concerning those who desire wisdom: <b>“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1).

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The verse means that <b>since</b> the Jews <b>traveled for three days without</b> hearing any <b>Torah they became weary,</b> and therefore the <b>prophets among them arose and instituted for them that they should read</b> from the Torah each <b>Shabbat, and pause</b> on <b>Sunday, and read</b> again on <b>Monday, and pause</b> on <b>Tuesday and Wednesday, and read</b> again on <b>Thursday, and pause</b> on <b>Shabbat eve, so they would not tarry three days without</b> hearing the <b>Torah.</b> Evidently this practice predates Ezra.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>Initially they instituted</b> that <b>one man</b> read <b>three verses;</b> or <b>alternatively,</b> that <b>three men</b> read <b>three verses.</b> Either way, the number three <b>corresponds to</b> the three types of Jews: <b>Priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> Ezra later <b>came</b> and <b>instituted</b> that <b>three men</b> always read, <b>and</b> that <b>ten verses</b> altogether be read by them, <b>corresponding to the ten idlers</b> in a city, i.e., the ten men who are paid to spend their time dealing with synagogue and communal matters.

### Part 8
The next ordinance of Ezra is: <b>And</b> the courts convene and <b>judge</b> every <b>Monday and Thursday.</b> The Gemara explains that the reason for this ordinance is <b>that</b> many people are <b>found</b> in a city on these days, <b>as they come</b> from the countryside <b>for the reading of the</b> holy <b>book,</b> the Torah, which is performed on Mondays and Thursdays, as stated above.

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And that one should do laundry on Thursday.</b> This was instituted <b>due to</b> the need to have clean garments in <b>deference to Shabbat.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara explains the next listed ordinance: <b>And that one should eat garlic Shabbat eve.</b> This is <b>due to</b> the fact that garlic enhances sexual potency, and Friday night is an appropriate time for <b>conjugal relations. As it is written</b> concerning the righteous: “And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, <b>who brings forth his fruit in his season”</b> (Psalms 1:3); <b>and Rabbi Yehuda says, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Naḥman, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Kahana, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> who said: <b>This</b> is referring to <b>one who engages in sexual intercourse every Shabbat eve.</b>

### Part 11
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>five matters were stated with regard to garlic: It satisfies; it warms</b> the body; <b>it causes</b> one’s <b>countenance to shine; it increases</b> one’s <b>sperm, and it kills lice that are in the intestines. And some say</b> that it also <b>instills love</b> into those who eat it <b>and removes jealousy</b> from them.

### Part 12
The next ordinance is: <b>And that a woman should rise early and bake</b> bread on those days when she bakes. This Gemara explains that this was instituted <b>so that bread should be available for poor people,</b> who go begging for bread in the mornings.

### Part 13
The <i>baraita</i> further teaches: <b>And that a woman should don a breechcloth [<i>sinar</i>].</b> This ordinance was instituted <b>due to</b> reasons of <b>modesty.</b>

### Part 14
The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And that a woman should</b> first <b>comb</b> her hair <b>and</b> only then <b>immerse</b> in a ritual bath. This is to ensure that there is no dirt or other substance in the hair that would invalidate the immersion. The Gemara questions this: <b>This is</b> required <b>by Torah law,</b> Ezra did not institute this.

### Part 15
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, concerning a verse that discusses one who must undergo ritual immersion: <b>“And he shall bathe his flesh [<i>et besaro</i>] in water”</b> (Leviticus 14:9). This verse teaches <b>that no substance should interpose between his flesh and the water.</b> When the verse states this in the expanded form of <b>“<i>et</i> his flesh,”</b> using the term “<i>et</i>,” this teaches that the water must come into contact even with <b>that which is subordinate to his flesh. And what is that?</b> It is one’s <b>hair.</b> Accordingly, the Torah itself states that there may not be any interposing substance in the hair at the time of immersion. What, then, did Ezra add?

### Part 16
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>By Torah law</b> one is required <b>to inspect</b> his or her hair before immersion, as <b>perhaps</b> some hairs are <b>knotted</b> together, preventing contact with water at that spot, <b>or</b> perhaps there is some <b>repulsive substance</b> in his hair. One must perform this inspection <b>because</b> these would constitute <b>an interposition.</b>
