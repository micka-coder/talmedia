### Part 1
<b>so too,</b> in the case where <b>he</b> set the fire, it is presumably a case <b>where he does not need</b> the ashes. <b>And</b> nevertheless, the mishna <b>teaches</b> that he is <b>exempt because he is sentenced to death.</b> Apparently, one who lights a fire on Shabbat is liable even if he does not need the ashes, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan.

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No,</b> the comparison is the other way around; the case where <b>his ox</b> set the fire <b>is similar to</b> the case where <b>he</b> set the fire. <b>Just as</b> the case where <b>he</b> is liable for lighting a fire on Shabbat is one <b>where he needs</b> the ashes, <b>so too,</b> the case of <b>his ox</b> setting fire to the haystack is one <b>where it needs</b> the ashes.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: In the case where <b>his ox</b> set the fire, <b>how can you find these</b> circumstances, where it did so because it needed the ashes? <b>Rav Avya said to him: Here we are dealing with an intelligent ox that was bitten on its back and wants to burn down</b> the haystack <b>and</b> then <b>roll around [<i>iggandar</i>] in the ashes</b> in order to heal the bite.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we know</b> that this is the reason that it set the fire? The Gemara answers: <b>Because after</b> the ox <b>burned</b> the haystack, <b>it was rolling around in the ashes.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And is there</b> really <b>a case like this?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as a certain ox that was at the house of Rav Pappa had a toothache. It went inside, and broke the lid</b> of a utensil, <b>and drank the liquor</b> inside <b>and was cured.</b> Evidently there are oxen with this level of intelligence.

### Part 6
<b>The Sages said before Rav Pappa: How can you say</b> that the case involving <b>his ox is similar to</b> the case involving <b>him? But doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach:</b> If <b>his ox caused</b> a person <b>humiliation</b>, he is <b>exempt, but</b> if <b>he humiliated</b> someone, he is <b>liable?</b> If the case of <b>his ox is</b> understood to be <b>similar to</b> the case involving <b>him, how can you find</b> a case where the ox <b>intended to humiliate</b> the person? One is liable for humiliating someone only when he intends to do so, and an ox never has intention to humiliate.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: It is a case <b>where</b> the ox <b>intended to cause injury.</b> If it was the action of a person, he would be liable for the humiliation he caused as well, <b>as the Master said:</b> In a case where <b>a person intended to cause injury,</b> he is liable for humiliation <b>even if he did not intend to humiliate</b> his victim.

### Part 8
<b>Rava said</b> a different solution with regard to the difficulty that the mishna poses to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>The mishna</b> is referring <b>to</b> a case where one lit a fire on Shabbat <b>unintentionally.</b> Although he is not liable to receive the death penalty, nevertheless, since he performed a prohibited action that would carry the death penalty were it to be performed deliberately, he is still exempt from monetary restitution.

### Part 9
The Gemara explains: This is <b>in accordance with what the school of Ḥizkiyya taught, as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught:</b> The verse states: “And he who kills an animal shall pay for it, and he who kills a man shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:21), indicating that <b>one who kills a man and one who kills an animal</b> are comparable.

### Part 10
This teaches that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>one who kills an animal,</b> the Torah <b>did not differentiate</b> between <b>whether</b> he does so <b>unintentionally or whether</b> he does so <b>intentionally, whether advertently or inadvertently, whether by way of descent or by way of ascent,</b> and this was not <b>to exempt him from</b> paying <b>monetary restitution</b> in all these cases but <b>rather to render him liable</b> to pay <b>monetary restitution,</b> as one who kills an animal is liable in any event, <b>similarly, with regard to one who kills a man, do not differentiate</b> between <b>whether</b> he does so <b>intentionally or unintentionally, whether advertently or inadvertently, whether by way of descent or by way of ascent,</b> and this was not <b>to render him liable</b> to pay <b>monetary restitution</b> for the damage he causes in the process of killing him, but <b>rather to exempt him from</b> paying <b>monetary restitution</b> in any event. It is derived from here that one who commits a transgression carrying the death penalty is exempt from paying damages for his action, even if he is not in practice given the death penalty.

### Part 11
<b>The Sages said to Rava: Can you</b> really <b>interpret</b> the mishna as referring <b>to</b> a case where the transgression was <b>unintentional? But doesn’t it teach</b> that the transgressor is exempt <b>because he is sentenced to death,</b> which is only the case if the transgression was intentional?

### Part 12
Rava answered that <b>this is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> He is exempt, <b>since</b> when this action is performed <b>intentionally,</b> the transgressor is liable to be <b>sentenced to death. And what are the circumstances</b> in which one is liable to receive the death penalty for deliberately lighting a fire on Shabbat? It is a case <b>where he needs the ashes.</b> Therefore, even <b>now, when</b> the transgression was <b>unintentional, he is exempt</b> from paying damages.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an ox that was pursuing another ox, and</b> the ox being pursued <b>became injured,</b> but there are no witnesses as to how it was injured, and <b>this</b> one, the owner of the injured ox, <b>says</b> to the owner of the pursuing ox: <b>Your ox injured</b> my ox, and you are liable to pay me damages, <b>and that</b> one, the owner of the pursuing ox, <b>says</b> in response: <b>No; rather, it was hurt by a rock,</b> and I am not liable, then in this case, <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b> As long as the owner of the injured ox cannot prove that the injury was inflicted by the pursuing ox, the owner of the pursuing ox is not liable.

### Part 14
In a case where <b>two</b> oxen, belonging to two different owners, <b>were pursuing one</b> ox belonging to a third person, and that ox was injured by one of the pursuing oxen, and <b>this</b> one, the owner of one of the pursuing oxen, <b>says</b> to the owner of the other: It was <b>your ox</b> that <b>caused the injury, and that</b> one, the owner of the other pursuing ox, <b>says:</b> No, it was <b>your ox</b> that <b>caused the injury,</b>
