<b>are</b> simply <b>called pools of the land,</b> and are not considered significant enough to divide the field.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <b>one who kindles</b> a fire <b>on his own</b> premises, <b>up to what</b> distance <b>may the fire travel</b> within his property for him to still bear liability for damage caused? <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria says:</b> The court <b>views his</b> location where he kindled the fire <b>as if it were in the center of a <i>beit kor</i>.</b> Therefore, if the fire spreads and causes damage farther away than half a <i>beit kor</i>, the one who kindled the fire is exempt, since he could not anticipate that the fire would spread so far. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One is liable up to a distance of <b>sixteen cubits, like</b> the width of <b>a public thoroughfare. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One is liable up to a distance of <b>fifty cubits. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse states: <b>“The one who kindled the fire shall pay [<i>shallem yeshallem</i>] compensation”</b> (Exodus 22:5), to teach that <b>everything is according to the fire.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Rabbi Shimon appears to hold that there is no maximum distance which would exempt one from liability for the spreading of a fire. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t Rabbi Shimon</b> of the opinion that there is a maximum <b>limit</b> concerning liability <b>for a fire,</b> beyond which one is exempt?

### Part 4
<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 20b): <b>A person may not stand an oven inside the house unless there is a height of four cubits</b> to the ceiling <b>above it,</b> out of concern that the ceiling might catch fire. Similarly, if <b>he stood it in the attic,</b> he should not do so <b>unless there is plaster [<i>ma’aziva</i>] underneath it,</b> above the ceiling of the floor below, <b>three handbreadths</b> in thickness, out of concern that the floor might catch fire. <b>And in the</b> case of <b>a stove,</b> which is smaller and does not reach temperatures as high as those of an oven, a thickness of one <b>handbreadth</b> is sufficient. <b>And</b> even though he may place his oven or stove in this manner, <b>if</b> the fire from the oven or stove <b>causes damage, he must pay</b> for <b>what it damaged.</b>

### Part 5
The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: These measurements were stated only</b> to teach <b>that if</b> the fire from the oven or stove <b>causes damage</b> after the owner takes these precautions, he is <b>exempt from paying</b> compensation. Evidently, Rabbi Shimon does have a maximum distance beyond which one is not liable for fire.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> This is how Rabbi Shimon’s statement in the mishna should be understood: <b>Everything is according to the height of the fire</b> he initially kindled. If it was a small fire he is not liable to pay for damage caused by it if it traveled far, whereas if he started a large fire, he is liable even if it traveled a great distance.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. And so Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who kindles a stack</b> of wheat or barley <b>and there were vessels</b> concealed <b>inside</b> the stack <b>and they</b> caught fire and <b>burned</b> together with the stack, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The one who kindled the fire also <b>pays</b> compensation <b>for what was inside</b> the stack, <b>but the Rabbis say: He pays</b> compensation <b>only</b> for <b>the stack of wheat or barley,</b> as the case may be, and he is not responsible for that which was concealed within it.

### Part 9
If <b>there was a goat tied to</b> the stack of grain, <b>and</b> there was a Canaanite <b>slave nearby</b> who was not tied to it, <b>and</b> both the goat and the slave <b>were burned</b> together <b>with</b> the stack and killed, the one who kindled the fire is <b>liable</b> to pay compensation for both. Conversely, if the <b>slave was tied</b> to the stack <b>and</b> there was <b>a goat nearby</b> that was not tied to it, <b>and</b> they were both <b>burned together with it,</b> the one who kindled the fire is <b>exempt</b> from payment for damage because he is liable to receive capital punishment for murder, and he is punished only for the greater transgression.

### Part 10
<b>And the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda and exempt one from payment for vessels concealed inside the stack in the field, <b>concede to Rabbi Yehuda</b> that if one <b>sets fire to a building,</b> he <b>pays</b> compensation <b>for everything that was</b> burned <b>inside it, since it is the</b> normal <b>way of people to place</b> items <b>in houses.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Kahana says:</b> This <b>dispute</b> between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda concerning vessels concealed in a stack is referring specifically to a case <b>where one kindled</b> a fire <b>on his own</b> premises <b>and</b> the fire <b>spread and consumed</b> the stack <b>on another’s</b> property. In that case, <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the one who kindled the fire <b>liable for damage</b> to <b>concealed</b> articles damaged by <b>a fire, but the Rabbis exempt</b> him. <b>But in</b> a case of one who <b>kindles</b> a fire <b>on another’s</b> premises, <b>all agree</b> that <b>he pays</b> compensation for <b>everything that is</b> contained <b>within it.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rava said to him: If so,</b> that the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Yehuda in the case of one who kindles the fire on the premises of another, then <b>rather than teaching the latter clause</b> that states: <b>The Rabbis concede to Rabbi Yehuda</b> that if one <b>sets fire to a building he pays</b> compensation <b>for everything</b> that was burned <b>inside it, since it is the</b> normal <b>way of people to place</b> items <b>in houses, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> instead <b>distinguish and teach</b> the concession of the Rabbis <b>in</b> the context of <b>the same</b> case of one setting fire to a stack: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where he kindled the fire on his own</b> premises <b>and it spread and consumed</b> a stack <b>on</b> the premises of <b>another. But if he kindled</b> the fire <b>on</b> property belonging to <b>another, all agree that he pays</b> compensation <b>for everything that was</b> contained <b>within it.</b> Since the mishna is not worded in this manner, it seems that this is not the opinion of the Rabbis.

### Part 13
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree with regard to two</b> issues: <b>They disagree</b> with regard to the case of one who <b>kindles a fire on his own</b> premises <b>and</b> it then <b>spreads and consumes</b> a stack <b>on</b> property belonging to <b>another, as Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> him <b>liable</b> even <b>for a concealed</b> article damaged by <b>a fire, but the Rabbis hold</b> that he is <b>not liable. And they disagree also</b> in the case of one <b>who kindles a fire on</b> premises belonging to <b>another, as Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that he must <b>pay</b> compensation <b>for everything within it, even a purse</b> of money if it was concealed within the stack, <b>but the Rabbis hold</b> that it is only for <b>vessels that are typically concealed inside a stack, such as threshing tools or yokes for cattle, that he must pay</b> compensation, but for <b>vessels</b> or other items <b>that are not typically concealed inside a stack</b> he is <b>not</b> liable to <b>pay</b> compensation.

### Part 14
<b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to one <b>who kindles a stack and there were vessels inside it</b> that were <b>burned, Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The one who kindled the fire <b>pays</b> compensation <b>for everything that was inside it, but the Rabbis say: He pays</b> compensation only for the value of <b>a stack of wheat or a stack of barley,</b> and he does not pay compensation for the vessels. <b>And</b> the court <b>views the place</b> where <b>the vessels</b> were <b>as if it were filled with grain,</b> and calculates the amount of compensation accordingly.
