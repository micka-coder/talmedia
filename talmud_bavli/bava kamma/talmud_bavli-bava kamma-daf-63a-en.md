### Part 1
This line of reasoning is correct, <b>because we expound each one</b> of the listed items in the <b>generalization, and detail,</b> and generalization <b>by itself.</b> Each item is treated individually as representing a category, but the different items are not grouped together into one broad category. Since several animals are listed, it is concluded that if the stolen item is an animal it must resemble the listed animals. <b>But</b> since <b>birds</b> do not transmit impurity through contact or carrying, they are <b>not</b> subject to double payment.

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this: <b>If so, let the Merciful One write</b> just <b>one detail,</b> i.e., animal, and that would have been enough to teach that animals are subject to double payment only if they transmit impurity through contact and carrying, so birds are excluded. Since the Torah listed several animals, birds are included.

### Part 3
The Gemara questions this assertion: <b>Which</b> individual animal <b>should the Merciful One have written? If the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>“ox,” I would say</b> that only an animal that is similar to an ox, in that it <b>is sacrificed on the altar, yes,</b> it is subject to double payment. But an animal <b>that is not sacrificed on the altar, no,</b> it is not subject to double payment. <b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>“donkey,” I would say</b> that only an animal that is similar to a donkey, in that its firstborn male offspring is <b>sacred with</b> the sanctity of <b>a firstborn, yes,</b> it is subject to double payment. But an animal that is <b>not sacred with</b> the sanctity of <b>a firstborn, no,</b> it is not subject to double payment. The principle of double payment would then include cattle, sheep, goats, and donkeys, but not other animals (see Exodus 13:13 and Deuteronomy 15:19).

### Part 4
The Gemara responds: <b>Say</b> in answer to this question: <b>If so,</b> if the Torah had wished to limit double payment to cases where cattle, sheep, goats, or donkeys were stolen, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> just <b>“ox” and “donkey”; why do I</b> need the verse to mention <b>“sheep”? Conclude from it</b> that the Torah intends <b>to include</b> even animals that do not meet these criteria, e.g., <b>birds.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks further: <b>But say</b> that the verse mentions sheep in order <b>to include</b> only <b>kosher birds,</b> which are <b>similar to</b> the <b>sheep</b> listed in the verse, in <b>that</b> a carcass of these birds <b>renders</b> both the one who eats it and his <b>garments</b> ritually <b>impure</b> when it passes through his <b>esophagus,</b> as the carcass of a sheep also transmits ritual impurity. <b>But non-kosher birds, whose</b> carcasses <b>do not have ritual impurity</b> at all, <b>as they do not render</b> either the one who eats them or his <b>garments impure</b> when they pass through his <b>esophagus, no,</b> they are not subject to double payment. The Gemara answers: The word <b>“any [<i>kol</i>],”</b> in the phrase “for any [<i>kol</i>] matter of trespass” is <b>an amplification,</b> and serves to include even non-kosher birds in the principle of double payment.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is it so that <b>anywhere that</b> the Torah <b>wrote</b> the word <b><i>kol</i> it is an amplification? But isn’t it</b> so that <b>with regard to</b> second <b>tithe,</b> the word <b><i>kol</i> is written</b> in the verse: “And you shall bestow the money for whatever [<i>bekhol</i>] your soul desires, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever your soul asks of you” (Deuteronomy 14:26)? <b>And</b> yet <b>we expound</b> that verse <b>as a generalization, and a detail,</b> and a generalization.

### Part 7
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And you shall bestow the money for whatever your soul desires,”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> as no particular type of food is specified. <b>“For oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink,”</b> is a <b>detail,</b> as specific types of food are mentioned. When the verse concludes with <b>“or for whatever your soul asks of you,” it has generalized again.</b> Since the verse is formulated as <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail.</b> This indicates that <b>just as</b> each of the items mentioned in <b>the detail</b> is clearly <b>defined as the produce of produce,</b> i.e., they grow from a parent organism, e.g., agricultural produce or animals, <b>and</b> they are <b>grown from the ground,</b> i.e., their sustenance comes from the ground, <b>so too</b> the category of items one may purchase with second-tithe money includes <b>all</b> items that are <b>the produce of produce and are grown from the ground.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara responds: <b>Say</b> in answer to this question that the term <b><i>bekhol</i></b> is <b>a generalization,</b> whereas the term <b><i>kol</i> is an amplification. And if you wish, say</b> an alternate answer: The word <b><i>kol</i></b> is usually <b>a generalization. But</b> the word <b><i>kol</i> that is</b> written <b>here,</b> in the verse concerning double payment (Exodus 22:8), is an exception. It is regarded as <b>an amplification,</b> as the Gemara will explain.

### Part 9
<b>After all,</b> there is another <b>generalization, and a detail, and a generalization written at the beginning</b> of this passage, <b>as it is written:</b> “If a man gives his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard and it was stolen from the house of the man, if the thief shall be found he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6). <b>“If a man gives his neighbor”</b> is <b>a generalization. “Money or vessels” is a detail.</b> When the verse concludes <b>“to safeguard,” it has generalized again.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>this</b> later verse: <b>“For any matter of trespass”</b> (Exodus 22:8), <b>is also coming</b> to state <b>a generalization, and a detail,</b> and a generalization, <b>let the Merciful One write these details,</b> i.e., ox, donkey, sheep, and garment, which are cited in the later verse, <b>together with that</b> previous <b>generalization, and detail,</b> and generalization. <b>Why do I</b> need the latter verse beginning with <b>“for any matter of trespass”? Conclude from it</b> that the word <i>kol</i> <b>is an amplification</b> in this instance, and it includes all animals.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>Now that you said</b> that the word <b><i>kol</i></b> is <b>an amplification, why do I</b> need <b>all these details</b> listed in the verse, i.e., ox, donkey, sheep, and garment? The Gemara answers: As for the three animals listed, <b>one</b> is mentioned <b>to exclude land, one to exclude</b> Canaanite <b>slaves, and one to exclude</b> financial <b>documents.</b> The example of <b>a garment</b> is mentioned <b>to exclude an item that is not</b> clearly <b>delineated</b> in size or quantity. <b>“Or for any manner of lost thing”</b> is written <b>to</b> teach that <b>which Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> says, <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>one who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole
