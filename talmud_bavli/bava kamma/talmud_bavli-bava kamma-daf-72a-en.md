is <b>because I had not eaten ox meat.</b> In other words, I was fasting yesterday and was unable to concentrate properly.

### Part 2
Rava responded to him: <b>But</b> if the Torah requires even a partial payment of the fourfold or fivefold payment, <b>what is different</b> in <b>the first clause,</b> in which the son must pay, <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> where he is exempt?

### Part 3
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> In <b>the first clause,</b> where the father’s animal was stolen and slaughtered in his lifetime, <b>I read about</b> this case the verse: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, <b>and slaughter it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), which indicates that the thief slaughtered the ox or the sheep <b>entirely in a prohibited</b> manner. In <b>the latter clause,</b> where the animal was slaughtered after the father’s death, <b>I do not read about</b> this case the verse: <b>“And slaughter it,”</b> which describes a slaughter that was performed <b>entirely in a prohibited</b> manner, because the animal already partially belonged to him, and his own portion of the ox was slaughtered in a permitted manner.

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches: A thief <b>who slaughters</b> the animal <b>but it was found to be a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> and likewise a thief who slaughters a non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard, pays the fourfold or fivefold payment. <b>Rav Ḥavivi of Meḥoza said to Rav Ashi: Conclude from</b> the mishna that the act <b>of slaughtering</b> is considered to have been performed <b>only at the end</b> of the slaughtering process.

### Part 5
Rav Ḥavivi of Meḥoza explains: <b>As, if</b> you say that the act <b>of slaughtering</b> lasts <b>from beginning to end,</b> i.e., the halakhic ramifications of slaughtering are in effect throughout the process, one could raise a question with regard to the case of one who slaughters a non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard: <b>Once he slaughtered</b> the animal <b>a bit,</b> at the very start of the act of slaughter, <b>he has prohibited</b> the animal, with regard to deriving benefit, as a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard. When he slaughters <b>the other</b> part, it is already prohibited with regard to deriving benefit, which means that it is <b>not</b> an animal that belongs <b>to its owner</b> that he <b>slaughters.</b> Since deriving benefit from the animal is prohibited, it has no value; therefore, there is no ownership.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rava, said to</b> Rav Ḥavivi in response: It is possible to explain the mishna even if one maintains that the halakhic ramifications of slaughtering are in effect throughout the slaughter. As, <b>when does</b> the thief <b>become obligated</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment? It is <b>when</b> he performs <b>that</b> first <b>bit</b> of slaughter in the beginning, before the animal becomes forbidden. <b>Rav Ashi said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>Do not dismiss</b> Rav Ḥavivi’s objection with this explanation. The verse: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, <b>and slaughter it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), indicates that to impose liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>we require</b> that the thief slaughtered it <b>completely, and</b> after having slaughtered it just a bit <b>there is no</b> complete slaughter yet.

### Part 7
Rav Huna said to Rav Ashi: <b>But</b> if you are correct, the mishna <b>is difficult</b> according to the one who maintains that the halakhic ramifications of slaughtering are in effect throughout the slaughter. Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>This is what Rav Gamda said in the name of Rava,</b> concerning this question: The mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> the thief <b>slaughtered,</b> i.e., severed, <b>part</b> of the <b>two organs that must be severed in ritual slaughter,</b> i.e., the trachea and the esophagus <b>[<i>simanin</i>], outside</b> the Temple, and <b>finished</b> slaughtering <b>them inside</b> the Temple. Therefore, the animal became prohibited with regard to deriving benefit only at the final stage of slaughter, concomitant with the liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.

### Part 8
<b>There are</b> those <b>who teach</b> that the preceding exchange took place <b>with regard to</b> the following dispute: <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> ben Lakish <b>says in the name of Rabbi Levi the Elder:</b> The act of slaughtering is considered to have been <b>performed only at the end</b> of the slaughtering process. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The act <b>of slaughtering lasts from beginning to end. Rav Ḥavivi of Meḥoza said to Rav Ashi: Shall we say that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds</b> that the prohibition against deriving benefit from <b>non-sacred</b> animals <b>that were slaughtered in the Temple courtyard is not by Torah law?</b>
