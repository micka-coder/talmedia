### Part 1
There are only <b>three</b> distinct <b>principles,</b> but they are listed as four cases because they apply <b>in four</b> different <b>places.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The determination of payment of damages is made by <b>monetary appraisal.</b> One pays with items <b>worth money.</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies <b>before a court. And</b> it is <b>based upon</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses</b> who are <b>free men,</b> i.e., men who are not Canaanite slaves, and who are <b>members of the covenant,</b> i.e., Jews. <b>And women are included in the</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b>damages</b> in the same way as men. <b>And</b> both <b>the injured</b> party <b>and the one liable for the damage</b> are involved <b>in</b> the <b>payment.</b> The Gemara will explicate each of these principles.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What</b> is the meaning of: The determination of payment of damages is made by <b>monetary appraisal?</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yehuda says: This appraisal</b> of the damage caused <b>should be</b> made <b>only in terms of</b> the <b>monetary</b> value of the damage.

### Part 5
The Gemara notes: <b>We learn,</b> in this mishna, <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that the Sages taught</b> explicitly: In a case in which <b>a cow damaged a cloak,</b> and the <b>cloak injured</b> the <b>cow,</b> e.g., the cow tread on it, thereby damaging it, and it became entangled in the cow’s legs, causing the cow to trip, <b>one does not say</b> that it may be presumed that the damage to the <b>cow is offset by</b> the damage to the <b>cloak and</b> the damage to the <b>cloak is offset by</b> the damage to the <b>cow,</b> and therefore the owners of both are exempt from any payment. <b>Rather,</b> the court <b>appraises</b> separately the damage caused to each side <b>in terms of</b> its <b>monetary</b> value and only then calculates to what extent the liabilities offset each other.

### Part 6
§ The mishna continues: With items <b>worth money;</b> to what does this refer?

### Part 7
This is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Payment is made with items <b>worth money.</b> This <b>teaches that</b> the <b>court attends to</b> the collection of damages <b>only</b> in order to collect from <b>property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land. <b>But if the injured</b> party <b>proceeded,</b> of his own accord, <b>to seize movable property</b> from the one liable for the damage, the <b>court collects</b> damages <b>for him from those</b> items he seized. According to the <i>baraita</i>, the phrase: Items worth money, is referring to land.

### Part 8
The Gemara analyzes this: <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: Payment is made with items <b>worth money.</b> This <b>teaches that</b> the <b>court attends to</b> the collection of damages <b>only</b> in order to collect from <b>property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land. The phrase: Items worth money, therefore, is used as a term for land. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this <b>inferred?</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabba bar Ulla says</b> that the phrase: Items worth money, is referring to <b>something that is worth any</b> amount of <b>money,</b> and <b>what is that?</b> It is <b>something that is not subject to</b> price <b>fraud,</b> which is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to land. Unlike the sale of movable property, the sale of land is valid irrespective of the sum for which the land is sold. The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>But slaves and documents are also not subject to</b> price <b>fraud,</b> and yet these are not included in the phrase: Items worth money, as the court does not collect payments of damages from them.

### Part 10
<b>Rather, Rabba bar Ulla said:</b> The phrase is referring to <b>something that is acquired with money,</b> which is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to land but not with regard to movable property (see <i>Kiddushin</i> 26a). The Gemara rejects this explanation: But <b>slaves and documents are also acquired with money.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said:</b> The phrase is referring to something that is <b>worth money, but is not</b> actually <b>money, and all these</b> things, i.e., movable property, slaves, and documents, <b>are</b> considered like actual <b>money</b> because they have the defining characteristics of money in that they are valuable and portable.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Yehuda bar Ḥinnana raises a contradiction to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua:</b> In the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier <b>it is taught:</b> The mishna’s statement that payment is made with items <b>worth money teaches that</b> the <b>court attends to</b> the collection of damages <b>only</b> in order to collect from <b>property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land. <b>But it is taught</b> also in another <i>baraita</i>: The verse states the superfluous phrase: <b>“He shall recompense”</b> (Exodus 21:34), <b>to include</b> items <b>worth money, and even bran,</b> a relatively inferior commodity, is accepted as a valid form of payment. The first <i>baraita</i> teaches that only land is a valid form of payment, whereas the second <i>baraita</i> teaches that one may pay even with movable property.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that teaches that the court collects damages only from land? We are dealing <b>with</b> a case where damages are collected from <b>orphans</b> whose father was liable to pay damages. The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the liability inherited by the orphans applies only to the land they inherited from their father as it is liened to their father’s debts.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to collection <b>from orphans, say,</b> and try to explain accordingly, <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: But <b>if the injured</b> party <b>proceeded,</b> of his own accord, <b>to seize movable property</b> from the one liable for the damage, the <b>court collects</b> damages <b>for him from those</b> items he seized. The Gemara asks: <b>If,</b> as suggested, the <i>baraita</i> is referring to collection <b>from orphans, why does the court collect</b> damages <b>for him from those</b> items he seized, as the father’s movable property is not liened to his debts?

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: The case is <b>like that which Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> with regard to a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 84a), which teaches that creditors who seize movable property as payment for a debt may keep those items: That is referring to a case in <b>which he seized</b> the property <b>while</b> the debtor was still <b>alive. Here also,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case in <b>which he seized</b> the property <b>while</b> the one liable for the damage was still <b>alive.</b>

### Part 16
§ The mishna continues: <b>Before a court.</b> What does this phrase mean?

### Part 17
This phrase should be understood as a qualification of the previous phrase in the mishna that teaches, as the Gemara explained, that a court collects damages only from land. The mishna then teaches that the court collects only from land that is still in the possession of the one liable for the damage when he appears in court. This <b>excludes</b> a case where the one liable for the damage <b>sells his</b> landed <b>property and afterward goes to court.</b> Since at the time of the hearing he no longer owns land, the court does not collect damages from it.

### Part 18
The Gemara challenges this: Should we <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that if one <b>borrows</b> money <b>and</b> then <b>sells his</b> landed <b>property, and afterward</b> he <b>goes to the court, the court does not collect</b> the loan <b>from those</b> landed properties that he sold? This is certainly incorrect, as the creditor has a lien on the debtor’s property from the time that he borrows the money.

### Part 19
<b>Rather,</b> the phrase: Before a court, should be understood as an independent clause that <b>excludes a court of non-ordained judges [<i>hedyotot</i>]</b> from judging all types of damages, as the payment for certain types of damage is considered to be a fine, and only expert judges who have been ordained are able to impose fines.

### Part 20
§ The mishna continues: Payment is made <b>based upon</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses.</b>

### Part 21
The Gemara explains: This clause is stated to <b>exclude</b> from liability one who <b>admits</b> he is liable to pay <b>a fine,</b> even if <b>witnesses come afterward</b> and testify that he is liable to pay it. The mishna teaches <b>that he is</b> nevertheless <b>exempt,</b> due to his admission.

### Part 22
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says: One who admits</b> he is liable to pay <b>a fine</b> is <b>exempt,</b> even if <b>witnesses come afterward</b> and testify to his liability. <b>But according to the one who says:</b> With regard to <b>one who admits</b> he is liable to pay <b>a fine and</b> then <b>witnesses come afterward</b> and testify that he is guilty, he is <b>liable</b> to pay the fine, <b>what is there to say</b> in explanation of this clause of the mishna?

### Part 23
The Gemara answers: This clause does not serve to exclude some other case; rather, <b>it is needed</b> to preface <b>the latter clause</b> that teaches that the only people who are accepted as witnesses in cases of damages are both
