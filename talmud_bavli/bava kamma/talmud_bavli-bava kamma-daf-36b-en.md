### Part 1
<b>he shall return</b> it <b>to the</b> owner of the <b>previous</b> ox, the mishna <b>should have</b> ruled that the surplus shall be returned <b>to all of them,</b> i.e., all the prior injured parties, since they all share joint ownership of the belligerent ox.

### Part 2
<b>Rava said: Actually,</b> the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says</b> that all the injured parties <b>are creditors. And as for the difficulty you</b> pose, that instead of stating that the owner of <b>the latest</b> of the oxen gored in succession <b>gains,</b> the mishna <b>should have</b> stated that the owner of <b>the earliest</b> of the oxen gored in succession <b>gains,</b> that can be answered. <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where the</b> first <b>injured</b> party <b>seized</b> the ox <b>to collect</b> payment <b>from it, and</b> consequently <b>became like a paid bailee</b> with regard <b>to damage</b> it causes. Therefore, he is responsible for any subsequent attacks by the ox. Similarly, if the next injured party seizes the ox from the first as compensation, he becomes responsible for any subsequent attacks.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> instead of the mishna stating that <b>if there is surplus</b> value left <b>in</b> his ox after he pays that owner, <b>he shall return</b> it <b>to</b> the owner of <b>the previous</b> ox that was gored, <b>it should have</b> stated that <b>he shall return it to</b> its <b>owner,</b> since half the value of the belligerent ox belongs to its owner, who is not responsible for any later damage it causes.

### Part 4
<b>Ravina said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is teaching: If there is surplus</b> value <b>with regard to its damages,</b> i.e., the latter injured party sustained less of a loss than the previous one, that injured party <b>shall return</b> this surplus value <b>to the previous</b> injured party.

### Part 5
<b>Similarly, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he related that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The mishna <b>touched on this</b> topic <b>with regard to a bailee’s negligence.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with which</b> opinion <b>did you interpret</b> the ruling in the mishna? Was it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael? If so, say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that the division of the compensation is as follows: With regard to an innocuous <b>ox worth two hundred</b> dinars <b>that gored an ox worth two hundred</b> dinars, thereby killing it, <b>and the carcass is worthless,</b> the injured party <b>takes one hundred dinars</b> from the proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox, <b>and</b> the owner of the belligerent ox <b>takes</b> the remaining <b>one hundred dinars.</b>

### Part 7
If the ox, after goring the first ox but before compensation had been paid, <b>again gored another ox worth two hundred</b> dinars, and the carcass is worthless, the owner of <b>the last</b> ox that was gored <b>takes one hundred dinars; and</b> with regard to payment for <b>the previous</b> goring, the owner of <b>this</b> ox that was gored <b>takes fifty dinars,</b> which is half the remaining value of the belligerent ox after one hundred dinars were paid to the last injured party, <b>and</b> the owner of <b>that</b> belligerent ox <b>takes</b> the remaining <b>fifty dinars.</b> If the ox, after goring the first two oxen but before compensation had been paid, again <b>gored another ox worth two hundred</b> dinars, and the carcass is worthless, <b>the last</b> injured party <b>takes one hundred dinars, the previous one</b> takes <b>fifty dinars, and the first two</b> divide the remainder, each receiving <b>one gold dinar,</b> which is worth twenty-five silver dinars.

### Part 8
The Gemara continues: In the ruling of Rabbi Shimon, <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>the ox belongs to</b> its owner and to the injured party, who are considered <b>partners</b> in the ownership of the ox. Is it possible that <b>the first clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael and the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva?</b>

### Part 9
The Sages <b>said</b> that <b>yes,</b> this is the case, <b>as Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: <i>Shinnana</i>, leave</b> the presumption that <b>the</b> entire <b>mishna</b> follows one opinion <b>and follow my</b> interpretation: <b>The first clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael and the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 10
<b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The practical difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon in the mishna is with regard to a case where <b>the injured</b> party <b>consecrated</b> the ox. If he is a partner in the ownership of the ox, his consecration takes effect; if he is considered merely a creditor, the consecration is ineffective. Evidently, Rabbi Yoḥanan also holds that the dispute in the mishna corresponds to the dispute between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva.

### Part 11
§ With regard to the gold dinar mentioned in the mishna, <b>we learned</b> in another mishna <b>there</b> (90a): <b>One who slaps [<i>hatokea</i>] another</b> is liable to <b>give him a <i>sela</i></b> as a compensatory fine. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili:</b> He is liable to give him <b>one hundred dinars.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who slapped another. Rav Toviya bar Mattana sent</b> an enquiry <b>before Rav Yosef,</b> asking him whether the <i>sela</i> <b>we learned</b> about in the mishna is referring to <b>a Tyrian <i>sela</i>,</b> which is worth four dinars, <b>or</b> whether the <i>sela</i> <b>we learned</b> about in the mishna is referring to <b>a provincial <i>sela</i>,</b> worth only half of a dinar, or one-eighth of a Tyrian <i>sela</i>.

### Part 13
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: You learned this</b> in a mishna: <b>And the first two</b> divide the remainder, each receiving <b>one gold dinar,</b> worth twenty-five silver dinars. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>the <i>tanna</i> teaches</b> monetary sums using <b>a provincial <i>sela</i></b> in order to calculate compensation, <b>let him</b> further <b>divide</b> the value that the first two litigants receive <b>and teach</b> a case where the belligerent ox gored an additional ox, so that their shares decrease <b>until</b> they reach <b>twelve dinars and one <i>sela</i></b> apiece, which are twelve and a half dinars. The fact that he does not do so indicates that the mishna does not use a provincial <i>sela</i>, whose value is less than one dinar, and therefore a gold dinar cannot be divided in a manner that leaves each party with whole coins.

### Part 14
Rav Toviya bar Mattana <b>said to him:</b> This is not proof; <b>should the <i>tanna</i> have continued teaching</b> additional cases, exhausting all possibilities, <b>like a peddler</b> selling his wares, who advertises every item of his merchandise? The cases cited in the mishna suffice to illustrate the point.

### Part 15
<b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? The Sages <b>resolved it based on</b> that <b>which Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: All</b> references to <b>coinage mentioned in the Torah</b> refer to <b>Tyrian coinage, whereas</b> all mentions <b>of</b> coinage in the <b>statements of</b> the Sages refer to <b>provincial coinage.</b> Therefore, a person who slaps another is fined a provincial <i>sela</i>, worth half of a dinar.

### Part 16
Following the verdict, <b>that man</b> who was slapped <b>said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Since</b> the fine <b>is</b> only <b>half a dinar, I do not want it,</b> as it is beneath me to collect such an amount. Instead, <b>let him give it to the poor. Then</b> he retracted his decision, and <b>said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Let him give it to me, and I will go and sustain [<i>ve’avri</i>] myself with it.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Rav Yosef said to him:</b> Since you already committed to give it to charity, <b>the poor have already acquired it</b> and it now belongs to them. <b>And although there are no poor</b> people <b>here</b> to acquire it, <b>we,</b> the court, <b>are the hand,</b> i.e., the legal extension, <b>of the poor.</b> We represent them, <b>as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Orphans</b>
