### Part 1
<b>A merging of</b> Torah <b>portions is written here,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> written in this passage is in fact meant to be applied to a different passage. <b>And when it is written: “This is it,”</b> from which the <i>halakha</i> of a partial admission is derived, <b>it is written concerning a loan,</b> not a deposit. The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> about <b>a loan</b> that this <i>halakha</i> would apply only there?

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: It is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabba, as Rabba says: For what</b> reason <b>did the Torah say</b> that one who <b>admits to a part of the claim must take an oath?</b> It is because there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>a person does not exhibit insolence</b> by lying <b>in the presence of his creditor,</b> who had done him a favor by lending money to him. <b>And this</b> person who denies part of the claim actually <b>wants to deny all of</b> the debt, so as to be exempt, <b>and this</b> fact <b>that he does not deny</b> all of <b>it</b> is <b>because a person does not exhibit insolence.</b>

### Part 3
Rabba continues: <b>And</b> in order not to exhibit insolence, he <b>wants to admit to</b> the creditor <b>with regard to all of</b> the debt, <b>and this</b> fact <b>that he denies</b> owing <b>him in part</b> is because he <b>reasons: If I admit to him with regard to all of</b> the debt, <b>he will lodge a claim against me with regard to all of it,</b> and right now I do not have the money to pay. <b>I will evade him at least</b> for <b>now until I have money, and</b> then <b>I will pay</b> him all of it. This rationalization enables one to falsely deny part of a claim. <b>Therefore, the Merciful One imposes an oath on him, in order</b> to ensure <b>that he will admit to him with regard to all of</b> the debt.

### Part 4
The Gemara completes its answer: <b>And it is with regard to a loan that this can be said,</b> as the basis for this explanation is that one will not exhibit insolence before his creditor, who did him a favor by lending him money; <b>but with regard to a deposit, one will certainly exhibit insolence,</b> as the claimant did him no favor. Therefore, there is no reason to say that one who completely denies a claim concerning a deposit is deemed credible any more than one who admitted to part of it, and he is obligated to take an oath in either case.
