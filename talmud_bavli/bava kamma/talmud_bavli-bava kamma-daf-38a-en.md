### Part 1
<b>Because if so,</b> if one whose ox gores a consecrated ox is exempt from liability, <b>let the verse write this</b> phrase: <b>“Of another,” with regard to</b> the case of <b>a forewarned</b> ox. One could then infer that the owner is exempt from liability in the case of an innocuous ox as well, as the liability with regard to an innocuous ox is less severe than with regard to a forewarned ox. The stating of this exemption specifically in the context of an innocuous ox indicates that the exemption is only concerning the leniency stated in the verse, that if the gored ox belongs to another person, the owner of the belligerent ox is liable to pay only half the cost of the damage.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>an ox of a Jew that gored the ox of a gentile,</b> the owner of the belligerent ox is <b>exempt</b> from liability; whereas if a gentile’s ox gores a Jew’s ox, the owner is liable to pay the full cost of the damage. The Sages <b>said:</b> This statement is difficult <b>whichever way you</b> look at it. <b>If</b> the phrase <b>“of another”</b> is meant in <b>a precise</b> manner, and therefore the liability applies only if his ox gores the ox of another Jew, <b>when a gentile’s</b> ox <b>gores that of a Jew he should also be exempt</b> from liability. <b>And if</b> the phrase <b>“of another”</b> is <b>not</b> meant in <b>a precise</b> manner, then <b>even when a Jew’s</b> ox <b>gores that of a gentile</b> the owner of the belligerent ox <b>should be liable.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that the reason for this ruling is that <b>the verse states: “He stood and shook the earth; He beheld, and made the nations tremble [<i>vayyatter</i>]”</b> (Habakkuk 3:6). This is homiletically interpreted to mean that God <b>saw the seven mitzvot that the descendants of Noah accepted upon themselves</b> to fulfill, and <b>since they did not fulfill</b> them, <b>He arose and permitted [<i>vehittir</i>] their money to the Jewish people,</b> so that in certain cases Jews are not liable for damage caused to gentiles.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that the source for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>from here:</b> It is stated in reference to the giving of the Torah: “The Lord came from Sinai and rose from Seir unto them; <b>He appeared from Mount Paran”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2), which is homiletically interpreted to mean: <b>From</b> the time God came from Mount <b>Paran,</b> when giving the Torah, <b>the money of</b> the gentile nations <b>appeared,</b> i.e., it was revealed and granted <b>to the Jewish people.</b>

### Part 5
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an ox of a Jew that gored the ox of a gentile,</b> the owner of the belligerent ox is <b>exempt</b> from liability. By contrast, with regard to <b>an ox of a gentile that gored the ox of a Jew, whether</b> it was <b>innocuous or forewarned,</b> the owner of the belligerent ox <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage, as it is stated: “He stood and shook the earth; He beheld, and made the nations tremble.” And</b> another verse <b>states: “He appeared from Mount Paran.”</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the reason the <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And</b> another verse <b>states,</b> indicating that the first verse is not a sufficient source?

### Part 7
The Gemara explains that this is how the <i>baraita</i> is to be understood: <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>this</b> verse: <b>“He stood and shook the earth” is necessary to</b> express <b>that which Rav Mattana and Rav Yosef</b> derived from the verse, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> another source: <b>“He appeared from Mount Paran,”</b> meaning: <b>From Paran their money appeared to the Jewish people. What is Rav Mattana’s</b> exposition? It is <b>as Rav Mattana says: “He stood and shook the earth.” What did He see? He saw the seven mitzvot that the descendants of Noah were commanded but did not fulfill,</b> and <b>He arose and exiled them from their land</b> on account of their transgressions.

### Part 8
<b>And from where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> term <b><i>vayyatter</i> is a term of exile? It is written here: “And made the nations tremble [<i>vayyatter</i>]”</b> (Habakkuk 3:6), <b>and it is written there: “<i>Lenatter</i> upon the earth”</b> (Leviticus 11:21), <b>which is translated</b> into Aramaic as: <b>“To leap upon the earth.”</b> Apparently, the root <i>nun</i>, <i>tav</i>, <i>reish</i>, common to both words, indicates uprooting from one place to another.

### Part 9
<b>What is Rav Yosef’s</b> exposition? It is <b>as Rav Yosef says: “He stood and shook the earth; He beheld.” What did He see? He saw the seven mitzvot that the descendants of Noah accepted upon themselves and did not fulfill,</b> so <b>He arose and permitted</b> their prohibitions <b>to them.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Did they</b> thereby <b>profit,</b> in that their prohibitions became permitted to them? <b>If so, we have found a transgressor</b> who <b>is rewarded. Mar, son of Rabbana, says:</b> This is not to say that for them to transgress their mitzvot is no longer a sin; rather, it is <b>to say that even if they fulfill them, they do not receive reward for</b> fulfilling <b>them.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> do they <b>not</b> receive reward for fulfilling those mitzvot? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that even a gentile who engages in Torah is</b> considered <b>like a High Priest? The verse states</b> with regard to the mitzvot: <b>“Which if a person does, he shall live by them”</b> (Leviticus 18:5). It <b>is not stated:</b> Which if <b>priests and Levites and Israelites</b> do, they shall live by them, <b>but rather: A person,</b> indicating that all people are included. <b>You have therefore learned that even a gentile who engages in Torah</b> study <b>is</b> considered <b>like a High Priest.</b>

### Part 12
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: Rav Yosef meant that <b>they do not receive the reward as</b> does <b>one who is commanded</b> to perform a mitzva <b>and performs</b> it, <b>but as</b> does <b>one who is not commanded</b> to perform a mitzva <b>and performs</b> it anyway. <b>As Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> One who is <b>commanded and performs</b> a mitzva <b>is greater than</b> one who <b>is not commanded and performs</b> it.

### Part 13
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following story in the context of the aforementioned <i>halakha</i>: <b>And the Roman kingdom once sent two military officials [<i>sardeyotot</i>] to the Sages of Israel,</b> and ordered them in the name of the king: <b>Teach us your Torah.</b> The officials <b>read</b> the Torah, <b>and repeated</b> it, <b>and</b> repeated it again, reading it for the <b>third</b> time. <b>At the time of their departure, they said to</b> the Sages: <b>We have examined your entire Torah and it is true, except for this</b> one <b>matter that you state,</b> i.e., that with regard to <b>an ox of a Jew that gored the ox of a gentile,</b> the owner is <b>exempt</b> from liability, whereas with regard to the ox <b>of a gentile that gored the ox of a Jew, whether</b> it was <b>innocuous or forewarned,</b> the owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>

### Part 14
The officials’ reasoning was that this <i>halakha</i> is difficult <b>whichever way you</b> look at it. <b>If</b> the phrase <b>“of another”</b> is meant in <b>a precise</b> manner, that the owners of both oxen must both be Jewish, then <b>even when</b> the ox <b>of a gentile gores the ox of a Jew</b> the owner of the ox <b>should be exempt</b> from liability. <b>And if</b> the phrase <b>“of another”</b> is <b>not</b> meant in <b>a precise</b> manner, and the oxen of all are included, then <b>even when</b> the ox <b>of a Jew gores the ox of a gentile</b> the owner <b>should be liable.</b> They added: <b>But we will not inform this matter to the kingdom;</b> having acknowledged that the entire Torah is true, we will not reveal this ruling, as it will displease the kingdom.

### Part 15
§ Incidentally, it is related that <b>the daughter</b> of <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda died. The Sages said to Ulla: Arise; let us go console him.</b> Ulla <b>said to them: What</b> business <b>do I have with the consolation of Babylonians, which is</b> actually <b>heresy? As, they say</b> while consoling mourners: <b>What can be done?</b> This seems to suggest that <b>if it were possible to do</b> something, acting against the Almighty’s decree, <b>they would do</b> so, which is tantamount to heresy. Therefore, Ulla declined to accompany the Babylonian Sages.

### Part 16
Ulla therefore <b>went to</b> console Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda <b>by himself,</b> and <b>said to him:</b> The verse states: <b>“And the Lord said to me, do not be at enmity with Moab, neither contend with them in battle”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:9). <b>What entered Moses’s mind,</b> that God had to warn him not to undertake a particular action? Did it enter his mind <b>to wage war</b> with the Moabites <b>without permission? Rather, Moses reasoned an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>by himself, saying: And if</b> with regard to <b>the Midianites, who came only to help the Moabites</b> harm the Jewish people (see Numbers, chapter 22), <b>the Torah said: “Harass the Midianites and smite them”</b> (Numbers 25:17),
