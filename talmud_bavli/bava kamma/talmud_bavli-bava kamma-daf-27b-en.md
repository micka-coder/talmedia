### Part 1
the mishna <b>teaches us that</b> the court <b>does not follow the majority with regard to monetary matters,</b> and in cases of uncertainty the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches concerning the vessel placed in the public domain: If <b>another</b> person <b>came and stumbled on it and broke it,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is he <b>exempt?</b> Although this happened in the public domain, <b>he should examine</b> the road <b>and</b> then continue <b>walking.</b>

### Part 3
The Sages of the <b>school of Rav said in the name of Rav:</b> The ruling of the mishna is taught <b>with regard to</b> one who placed not just one barrel in the road, but rather <b>filled the entire public domain with barrels,</b> blocking the path. Since the public domain belongs to everyone, a pedestrian is entitled to traverse the road even if it necessitates breaking the vessels. <b>Shmuel says:</b> The ruling of the mishna is <b>taught with regard to</b> a case where he broke it in <b>the dark.</b> Therefore, he could not have avoided breaking the barrel by examining the road in front of him. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The ruling of the mishna is <b>taught with regard to</b> a case where the barrel was placed at <b>the corner</b> of the road, and so the pedestrian could not have seen it, as he rounded the corner, before stumbling on it.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Pappa said: The mishna is precise only according to either</b> the explanation of <b>Shmuel or</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> but not that of Rav. <b>As, if</b> the mishna is explained <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rav, what</b> is the reason it refers <b>specifically</b> to a case where one <b>stumbled</b> on the barrel? <b>Even if he broke</b> the barrel intentionally he should not be liable to pay, as the owner of the barrel had no right to block the public road.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava</b> in defense of Rav’s explanation: <b>The same is true even if he broke</b> the barrel intentionally. <b>And</b> as for <b>this</b> fact, <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> a case where <b>he stumbled,</b> it is <b>because he wants to teach</b> in <b>the last clause: And if he incurred damage due to</b> the vessel, <b>the owner of the <i>ḥavit</i> is liable</b> to pay <b>for his damage. As</b> this ruling applies <b>specifically when he stumbled, but</b> if <b>he broke</b> the barrel intentionally and incurred damage in the process, the owner of the barrel is <b>not</b> required to compensate him. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Although the pedestrian had the right to break the barrel, <b>it is he who damaged himself,</b> by not being careful while breaking it. Therefore, in <b>the first clause</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> a case where <b>he stumbled.</b> Accordingly, the mishna’s wording is precise according to Rav’s explanation as well.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi</b> that <b>this is what they say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rabbi Ulla,</b> in explanation of the mishna: Even if the barrel is clearly visible, one who stumbles on it is exempt from liability <b>because the</b> typical <b>manner of people is not to examine the roads,</b> as they assume that the road is unobstructed. Therefore, one who breaks an item placed in the road as a result of not watching is not liable to pay restitution.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates: <b>There was an incident in Neharde’a</b> where a pedestrian stumbled on a jug in an open area and broke it, <b>and Shmuel deemed him liable</b> to pay for the damage. A similar incident took place <b>in Pumbedita, and Rava deemed</b> the person <b>liable</b> to pay.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, Shmuel</b> ruled <b>in accordance with his halakhic</b> opinion that the exemption stated in the mishna refers specifically to a case where one stumbles in the dark, as otherwise he is liable for breaking the barrel, since he should have examined the road. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>Rava, shall we say that he holds in accordance with Shmuel’s</b> opinion that one who breaks an item in the public domain is exempt from paying for it only if it was dark?

### Part 9
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> That inference is not necessary, as this incident <b>was</b> at <b>the corner where</b> there was an olive <b>press [<i>de’atzera</i>],</b> where it is known that people put their jugs down while waiting for oil. Consequently, <b>since they were acting with permission,</b> a pedestrian <b>should examine</b> the road <b>and</b> then continue <b>walking.</b>

### Part 10
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda sent</b> the following question <b>to Rav Naḥman:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that when one strikes another, humiliating him, the judges determine liability according to the following formula: <b>For kneeing [<i>rekhuva</i>]</b> him, he must pay <b>three</b> <i>sela</i>; <b>for kicking, five; and for punching [<i>velisnokeret</i>]</b> him, <b>thirteen.</b> The Gemara asks: If so <b>for</b> hitting him with <b>the handle of a hoe [<i>demara</i>] and for</b> hitting him with <b>the top [<i>ulkofina</i>] of a hoe, what</b> amount is one liable to pay him?

### Part 11
Rav Naḥman <b>sent him</b> the following response: <b>Ḥisda, Ḥisda, are you collecting a fine</b> for humiliation <b>in Babylonia,</b> where judges are not authorized to collect fines? <b>Tell me how the incident itself</b> transpired.

### Part 12
Rav Ḥisda <b>sent him</b> in response: There is <b>a certain cistern belonging to two</b> people whose arrangement was to alternate its use so <b>that every day one of them would draw</b> from it in turn. It happened that <b>one of them came and was drawing</b> water <b>on a day that was not his</b> turn. His co-owner <b>said to him: This is my day</b> to draw, not yours. His colleague <b>did not pay attention to him.</b> The person whose turn it was therefore <b>took the handle of a hoe</b> and <b>struck</b> the person who was stealing his water, who then sued for damages.

### Part 13
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> In that case, he was right to do so, and he <b>should</b> have <b>hit him</b> even <b>a hundred times with the hoe. Even according to the one who says</b> that <b>a person may not take justice into his own</b> hands but should go to court, in a case <b>where</b> there would be <b>a loss</b> involved if no immediate action is taken, <b>a person may take justice into his own</b> hands.

### Part 14
This is <b>as it was stated,</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says: A person may not take justice into his own</b> hands, whereas <b>Rav Naḥman says: A person may take justice into his own</b> hands.

### Part 15
<b>Where there is</b> an imminent <b>loss</b> that will be suffered if the injured party does not take action, <b>everyone agrees that a person may take justice into his own</b> hands. <b>They disagree</b> only <b>when there is no</b> imminent <b>loss</b> that will be suffered. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>a person may not take justice into his own</b> hands, <b>because since there is no loss, he should go before the judge</b> to have him enforce the law. <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>a person may take justice into his own</b> hands. <b>Since he is acting lawfully,</b> as he is clearly in the right, <b>he need not trouble</b> himself to go before the judge to have him enforce the law.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Kahana raises an objection</b> to Rav Yehuda’s opinion based on a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ben Bag Bag says: Do not enter another</b> person’s <b>courtyard</b> secretly <b>to take what is</b> rightfully <b>yours without permission, lest you appear to him as a thief</b> trying to steal his property. <b>Rather, break his teeth,</b> i.e., take it by force, <b>and say to him: I am taking what is mine.</b> Evidently one may take justice into his own hands.

### Part 17
Rav Yehuda <b>said to him:</b>
