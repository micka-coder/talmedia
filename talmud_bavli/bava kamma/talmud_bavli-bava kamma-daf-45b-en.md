### Part 1
<b>who says</b> that <b>a renter is</b> considered <b>like an unpaid bailee</b> with regard to his responsibility for the rented item, <b>let it teach</b> that bailees are liable to compensate the owner, <b>with the exception of an unpaid bailee and a renter.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And if</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>a renter is</b> considered <b>like a paid bailee, let it teach: With the exception of an unpaid bailee,</b> as it in fact states; <b>but</b> it should also state that <b>in</b> a case where the oxen are <b>forewarned, all of them are exempt with regard to ransom,</b> as Rabbi Yehuda says in the next mishna that a forewarned ox requires only a reduced level of safeguarding. Therefore, this <i>baraita</i> does not appear to be in accordance with the opinion of either <i>tanna</i>.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says</b> that an ox <b>has no</b> sufficient <b>safeguarding</b> at all <b>other than</b> slaughtering it with <b>a knife;</b> i.e., there is no degree of safeguarding that exempts the ox’s owner, or in the context of the <i>baraita</i>, the bailee, from liability if the ox causes damage or kills. <b>And with regard to a renter,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>a renter is</b> considered <b>like a paid bailee.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said: Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir; and</b> it is <b>as Rabba bar Avuh reversed</b> the two opinions <b>and taught: How does a renter pay?</b> In other words, what is his degree of responsibility? <b>Rabbi Meir says: Like a paid bailee. Rabbi Yehuda says: Like an unpaid bailee.</b>

### Part 5
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> If the owner <b>conveyed his ox to an unpaid bailee,</b> if the ox <b>caused damage,</b> the bailee is <b>liable</b> to pay damages; but if the ox <b>was injured,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 6
The Sages <b>said: What are the circumstances? If</b> Rabbi Elazar was referring to a bailee <b>who accepted</b> responsibility <b>upon himself</b> for <b>guarding it from</b> causing <b>damage, even</b> if the ox <b>was injured he should be liable. And if</b> he was referring to a bailee <b>who did not accept</b> responsibility for <b>guarding it from</b> causing <b>damage, even if it causes damage he should be exempt</b> from payment.

### Part 7
<b>Rava said: Actually,</b> Rabbi Elazar was referring to a case <b>where he accepted</b> responsibility <b>upon himself</b> for <b>guarding it from causing damage; but here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the bailee <b>recognized that</b> the ox <b>was a goring</b> ox, <b>and</b> in that case <b>the normal way of things is that</b> the bailee <b>accepted upon himself</b> responsibility for safeguarding it so <b>that it would not go and injure others,</b> since he knew that it was dangerous. But <b>it</b> presumably <b>did not enter his mind that other</b> oxen <b>would come and injure it.</b> Therefore, he did not accept responsibility for safeguarding against such an occurrence.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>the</b> ox’s <b>owner tied it with reins</b> to a fence <b>or locked</b> the gate <b>before it in an appropriate manner, but</b> nevertheless the ox <b>emerged and caused damage, whether</b> the ox is <b>innocuous or forewarned</b> the owner is <b>liable,</b> since this is not considered sufficient precaution to prevent damage; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that if the ox is <b>innocuous</b> the owner is <b>liable</b> even if he safeguarded it appropriately, since the Torah does not limit the required safeguarding for an innocuous ox. <b>But</b> if the ox is <b>forewarned,</b> the owner is <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation for damage, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse describing damage by a forewarned ox: <b>“And the owner has not secured it”</b> (Exodus 21:36), <b>and this</b> ox that was tied with reins or behind a locked gate <b>was secured.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> An ox <b>has no</b> sufficient <b>safeguarding</b> at all <b>other than</b> slaughtering it with <b>a knife;</b> there is no degree of safeguarding that exempts the ox’s owner from liability.

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir? He holds</b> that <b>ordinary oxen are not presumed to be under safeguarding,</b> as their owners do not ordinarily safeguard them; <b>and the Merciful One stated</b> in the Torah that one <b>will be liable</b> even for damage caused by <b>an innocuous</b> ox inasmuch <b>as it requires</b> at least <b>a reduced</b> level of <b>safeguarding,</b> such as with reins. <b>The Merciful One then stated with regard to a forewarned</b> ox: <b>“And</b> the owner <b>has not secured it,”</b> to indicate that it is not sufficient to provide it with only a reduced level of safeguarding, <b>as it requires superior safeguarding. And</b> Rabbi Meir <b>derives</b> this requirement with regard to an innocuous ox from a verbal analogy between the term <b>goring</b> stated <b>with regard to an innocuous</b> ox and the term <b>goring</b> stated <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox. In both cases superior safeguarding is required; otherwise the owner is liable.

### Part 12
By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>ordinary oxen are presumed to be under</b> some reduced level of <b>safeguarding.</b> Since <b>the Merciful One stated</b> nevertheless that even for damage caused by <b>an innocuous</b> ox the owner <b>will pay,</b> it may be inferred <b>that it requires superior safeguarding. The Merciful One then states with regard to a forewarned</b> ox: <b>“And</b> the owner <b>has not secured it,”</b> emphasizing again <b>that one must provide it with superior safeguarding. This constitutes</b> one <b>amplification following</b> another <b>amplification, and</b> the principle is that <b>an amplification following an amplification is</b> stated <b>only</b> in order <b>to restrict</b> its extent. Accordingly, <b>the verse excludes</b> the requirement of <b>superior safeguarding</b> with regard to a forewarned ox, and therefore reduced safeguarding is sufficient to exempt the owner from liability.

### Part 13
<b>And if you would say</b> that through the verbal analogy between the term <b>goring</b> stated <b>with regard to an innocuous</b> ox and the term <b>goring</b> stated <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox the Torah compares their <i>halakhot</i>, nevertheless, <b>the Merciful One restricted</b> this <i>halakha</i> by emphasizing: <b>“And</b> the owner <b>has not secured it,”</b> referring specifically <b>to it,</b> a forewarned ox, <b>and not to the other,</b> i.e., innocuous, ox.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t this</b> phrase <b>necessary for the negative [<i>lav</i>]</b> statement that if the owner does not provide superior safeguarding he is liable? The Gemara answers: <b>If that is so, let the Merciful One write: And</b> the owner <b>has not secured. What</b> is the purpose of the added emphasis: <b>“And</b> the owner <b>has not secured it”?</b> It is to indicate that the restriction of this <i>halakha</i> relates specifically <b>to it,</b> a forewarned ox, <b>and not to the other,</b> i.e., innocuous, ox.

### Part 15
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that there is a fourth opinion. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> In the cases of <b>both an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox in <b>which</b> its owner <b>provided reduced safeguarding,</b> he is <b>exempt from liability.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for his opinion? <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>reduced safeguarding is sufficient for a forewarned</b> ox, <b>and he derives</b> from the verbal analogy between the term <b>goring</b> stated <b>with regard to an innocuous</b> ox <b>and</b> the term <b>goring</b> stated <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox that just as reduced safeguarding is sufficient for a forewarned ox, it is sufficient for an innocuous ox as well.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said: Rabbi Yehuda deemed only the forewarned element of</b> the ox <b>exempt.</b> Rabbi Yehuda’s ruling that reduced safeguarding is sufficient to exempt the owner of a forewarned ox relates only to the additional half of the damage that is paid for a forewarned ox beyond the half of the damage that one is liable to pay for an innocuous ox. <b>But</b> the liability for its <b>element of innocuousness remains in place.</b> Therefore, if the owner did not provide superior safeguarding for the forewarned ox he is still liable to pay half the cost of the damage as he would if it were innocuous.

### Part 18
<b>Rav says:</b> If an ox is <b>forewarned with regard to</b> goring with its <b>right horn,</b> it <b>is not</b> thereby <b>forewarned with regard to</b> goring with its <b>left horn.</b>

### Part 19
The Sages <b>said: In accordance with whose</b> opinion is Rav’s statement made? <b>If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir, doesn’t</b> Rabbi Meir <b>say</b> that <b>both an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox <b>require superior safeguarding? If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, why</b> did he state that the ox still has an innocuous element <b>specifically</b> with regard to <b>the left horn? Even with regard to the right horn</b> itself it has both elements; <b>it has an element of innocuousness and it</b> also <b>has a forewarned element.</b>

### Part 20
The Sages <b>said: Actually,</b> Rav’s statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and he does not hold</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> that the ox’s innocuous element remains. <b>And this is what he is saying: You find an element</b> both <b>of innocuousness and of a forewarned</b> status in the same ox specifically <b>in a case like this,</b> where an ox is forewarned with regard to one horn but not with regard to the other.
