### Part 1
then in the case of <b>an ox</b> killing <b>a person, where</b> the Torah <b>renders small</b> oxen <b>like large</b> ones <b>with regard to this</b> act, as a young calf that kills a person is killed just as an adult ox that kills a person, <b>is it not logical that</b> the Torah <b>renders</b> it <b>liable for</b> killing <b>minors,</b> i.e., a boy or a girl, just <b>as</b> for killing <b>adults?</b> Why is it necessary for the verse to teach this <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>No,</b> this cannot be derived by logic alone. <b>If you say</b> that <b>a person</b> who kills <b>a person</b> is liable even when the victim is a minor, this may be due to the extra severity in the case of a human assailant, <b>as he is liable to</b> pay <b>four types of indemnity</b> for causing injury; pain, humiliation, medical costs, and loss of livelihood, in addition to payment for the actual damage. <b>Shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to an ox, whose</b> owner <b>is not liable to</b> pay these <b>four types of indemnity?</b> Clearly, this <i>halakha</i> cannot be derived merely through logical comparison between the two cases. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter,” to render</b> it <b>liable for minors</b> as well <b>as adults.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And I have</b> derived this <i>halakha</i> <b>only with regard to forewarned</b> oxen; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>in</b> the case of <b>an innocuous</b> ox, it is killed if it kills a boy or a girl?

### Part 4
The <i>baraita</i> asks: Could this not be derived through <b>logical inference? Since</b> the Torah <b>renders</b> an ox <b>liable</b> to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a man or a woman, and</b> likewise <b>renders</b> it <b>liable</b> to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a boy or a girl;</b> then <b>just as when it renders</b> it <b>liable</b> to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a man or a woman you do not differentiate between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox, as both are stoned, <b>so too, when it renders</b> an ox <b>liable</b> to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a boy or a girl do not differentiate between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox.

### Part 5
<b>And furthermore,</b> it can be inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: If</b> with regard to <b>a man or a woman, whose power is diminished with regard to damages</b> because adults who cause damage are liable to pay, but nevertheless <b>you do not differentiate between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox that kills them; then with regard to <b>a boy or girl, whose power is enhanced with regard to damages</b> because they are not liable to pay for damage they cause, <b>is it not logical that you should not differentiate between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox that kills them?

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> answers that <b>you could say</b> in response: <b>But does one derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a lenient</b> matter <b>from a stringent</b> matter <b>in order to</b> be more <b>stringent with regard to it? If</b> the Torah <b>is stringent with regard to</b> the case of <b>a forewarned</b> ox, <b>which is a stringent</b> matter, rendering it liable to be killed for killing a minor, does that mean that <b>you should be stringent with regard to an innocuous</b> ox, <b>which is</b> a relatively <b>lenient</b> matter?

### Part 7
<b>And furthermore,</b> there is another reason to reject the earlier opinion: <b>If you say</b> that an innocuous ox is liable to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a man or a woman, as they are obligated to</b> observe the <b>mitzvot,</b> which gives them importance, does that mean that <b>you should say</b> the same <b>with regard to a boy or a girl, who are exempt from the mitzvot?</b>

### Part 8
Since this <i>halakha</i> could not have been derived through logic alone, <b>the verse states: “Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter,”</b> stating the phrase “has gored” twice, to teach that it is referring both to the <b>goring of an innocuous</b> ox and to the <b>goring of a forewarned</b> ox, and both to <b>goring</b> that causes <b>death</b> and to <b>goring</b> that causes <b>injury.</b> In all these cases the owner of the ox is liable even if the ox gores a minor.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>an ox was rubbing against a wall, and</b> as a result the wall <b>fell on a person</b> and killed him; or if the ox <b>intended to kill</b> another <b>animal but killed a person;</b> or if it intended <b>to</b> kill <b>a gentile but killed a Jew;</b> or intended <b>to</b> kill <b>a non-viable baby but killed a viable person;</b> in all these cases the ox is <b>exempt</b> from being killed.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Shmuel says:</b> The ox is <b>exempt from</b> being put to <b>death,</b> since it did not intend to kill, <b>but</b> its owner is <b>liable to</b> pay <b>ransom. And Rav says:</b> They are <b>exempt from this</b> liability <b>and from that</b> liability.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks about Shmuel’s opinion: <b>And why</b> is he liable to pay ransom? <b>Isn’t</b> the ox <b>innocuous</b> with regard to this action? The Gemara answers: <b>As Rav says</b> in a different context, it is referring <b>to</b> an ox that was <b>forewarned with regard to falling on people in pits. Here too,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> an ox that was <b>forewarned with regard to rubbing against walls,</b> causing them to fall <b>on people.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if it was forewarned with regard to this behavior, it clearly intended to kill the person and <b>is</b> therefore <b>subject to</b> being put to <b>death,</b> contrary to the ruling in the mishna. The Gemara explains: <b>Granted there,</b> in the case where the ox was forewarned with regard to falling on people in pits, it could be <b>that it saw a vegetable</b> on the edge of the pit <b>and</b> subsequently <b>fell</b> in, without any intention to kill. <b>But here,</b> where it rubbed against a wall, causing it to fall on a person, and was forewarned with regard to this behavior, <b>what is there to say</b> in its defense?

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>Here also</b> the case is <b>where it rubbed against the wall for its pleasure</b> and not in order to kill. The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we know</b> that it did not intend to kill? The Gemara answers: <b>Because</b> even <b>after</b> the wall <b>fell it was still rubbing against it,</b> which proves that this was its intention.
