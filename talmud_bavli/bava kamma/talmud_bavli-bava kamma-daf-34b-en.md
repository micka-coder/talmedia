### Part 1
a case where the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an innocuous</b> ox that causes damage <b>is more stringent than</b> with regard to <b>a forewarned</b> ox, since according to all opinions, in a case where a forewarned ox kills another ox, the carcass belongs exclusively to the injured party, and he sustains any subsequent decrease in its value.

### Part 2
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> Rabbi Yehuda holds that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an innocuous ox is more stringent than with regard to a forewarned ox, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If a bailee did not safeguard an ox properly, and it escaped and caused damage, if it was <b>an innocuous</b> ox he <b>is liable, and</b> if it was <b>a forewarned</b> ox he <b>is exempt</b> (45b), that mishna cannot serve as proof for the issue under discussion. <b>Say that you heard Rabbi Yehuda</b> express this opinion, that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an innocuous ox is more stringent, <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>safeguarding, as verses are written</b> in the Torah from which this <i>halakha</i> is derived. But <b>with regard to compensation, did you</b> ever <b>hear him</b> express this opinion?

### Part 3
On the contrary; <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that in the case of <b>an ox worth one hundred dinars that gored an ox worth five <i>sela</i>,</b> i.e., twenty dinars, <b>and the carcass is worth one <i>sela</i>,</b> i.e., four dinars, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>this</b> party <b>takes half the living</b> ox <b>and half the dead</b> ox, <b>and that</b> party <b>takes half the living</b> ox <b>and half the dead</b> ox. Accordingly, the injured party receives fifty-two dinars in value, which is much more than his ox was worth before it was killed.

### Part 4
Instead, continues Rabbi Yehuda, you should <b>say: For what</b> purpose <b>is</b> the case of <b>a forewarned</b> ox <b>singled out</b> by the <i>halakha</i>? Is it <b>to render it</b> more <b>stringent</b> than the case of an innocuous ox, or <b>to render it</b> more <b>lenient?</b> Clearly, <b>you must say</b> that it is <b>to render it</b> more <b>stringent.</b> And therefore, <b>if</b> in the case of <b>a forewarned</b> ox, its owner <b>pays only</b> the value of <b>what he damaged</b> and no more, in the case of <b>an innocuous</b> ox, <b>which is</b> more <b>lenient, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that the owner is not liable to pay more than the value of the damage? Evidently, Rabbi Yehuda does not allow for liability in the case of an innocuous ox to be more stringent than in the case of a forewarned ox.

### Part 5
<b>Rather,</b> Rava’s explanation, that Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda disagree with regard to a case where the carcass depreciated in value, should be rejected. Instead, their dispute should be explained according to what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said,</b> i.e., that the practical difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to <b>the appreciation of the carcass</b> in value after the ox’s death; <b>as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that the entire increased value of the carcass <b>belongs to the injured</b> party, since the owner of the belligerent ox has no share in the carcass, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>half</b> of the increased value belongs to the injured party and half goes to the one liable for the damage.

### Part 6
<b>And this</b> explains <b>what was difficult for Rabbi Yehuda</b> in another <i>baraita</i>. <b>Now that you say</b> that <b>the Merciful One has mercy on the one liable for damage, as he takes</b> a share <b>of the increased value</b> of the carcass, <b>can</b> it be that in the case of <b>an ox worth five <i>sela</i>,</b> i.e., twenty dinars, <b>that gored an ox worth one hundred dinars, and the carcass is worth fifty dinars, this</b> party <b>takes half the live</b> ox <b>and half the dead</b> ox, <b>and that</b> party <b>takes half the live</b> ox <b>and half the dead</b> ox? Accordingly, the owner of the belligerent ox receives thirty-five dinars in value, which is more than his ox was worth.

### Part 7
Rather, <b>you</b> should <b>say: Where do we find</b> a case where <b>the one liable for damage gains</b> from the damage, comparable to this case, <b>where this</b> owner of the belligerent ox <b>gains,</b> receiving more than the value of his ox? Clearly there is no such case, as one who is liable for damage does not gain from it. <b>And</b> in addition, <b>it says: “He shall pay”</b> (Exodus 21:36), indicating that <b>the owner</b> of the belligerent ox <b>pays, and the owner does not take</b> more than the amount his animal was worth at the time of the damage.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: For <b>what</b> reason was it necessary to add the claim: <b>And it says:</b> “He shall pay”? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> that the one liable for damage does not gain, <b>applies</b> specifically <b>where there is a loss sustained by the injured</b> party, as in this case, where the decrease in the ox’s value is fifty dinars, and if the carcass is shared by the liable party, the injured party receives only thirty-five dinars, thereby sustaining a loss. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where there is no loss sustained by the injured</b> party, <b>for example,</b> the case of <b>an ox worth five <i>sela</i>,</b> i.e., twenty dinars, <b>that gored</b> another <b>ox worth five <i>sela</i>, and the carcass</b> appreciated in value and is now <b>worth thirty dinars,</b> more than the ox was worth when it was alive, in this case <b>the one liable for damage also takes</b> a share <b>of the increased value,</b> since the injured party ends up not having sustained any financial loss, as he receives a share of ten dinars in the belligerent ox and another fifteen in the carcass, gaining five dinars over the value of his ox.

### Part 9
It is to counter this claim that Rabbi Yehuda adds: <b>And it says: “He shall pay,”</b> indicating that <b>the owner</b> of the belligerent ox <b>pays, and the owner does not take</b> more than the amount his animal was worth at the time of the damage.

### Part 10
§ With regard to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion that the two owners split the value of both the belligerent ox and the dead ox between them, <b>Rav Aḥa bar Taḥalifa said to Rava: If so, we find</b> that <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> when <b>an innocuous</b> ox gores an ox that is worth less than it, its owner <b>pays more than half the damage. But the Torah stated: “Then they shall sell the live ox, and divide its monetary value”</b> (Exodus 21:35).

### Part 11
Rava answered him: <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> also <b>holds</b> that only the <b>diminished</b> value of the dead ox <b>that was diminished by</b> its <b>death</b> is compensated for by <b>dividing the live</b> ox between the two parties. The liable party never pays more than half the damage.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> does Rabbi Yehuda derive this <i>halakha</i>? Is it <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“And the carcass they shall also divide”</b> (Exodus 21:35), from which Rabbi Meir derived it? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Yehuda</b> already <b>derive from</b> this verse <b>that this</b> party <b>takes</b> the value of <b>half the live</b> ox <b>and half the dead</b> ox, <b>and that</b> party <b>takes</b> the value of <b>half the live</b> ox and <b>half the dead</b> ox?

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> if that is the only <i>halakha</i> indicated by this clause, <b>let the verse</b> simply <b>write: And the carcass</b> they shall divide. <b>What is</b> the reason that the word <b>“also”</b> is added? It is added so that one may <b>conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from</b> the clause: That the carcass is also divided between the two parties, and that the liable party is never required to pay more than half the damage.

### Part 14
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There</b> are cases where one is <b>liable for an act of</b> damage caused by <b>his ox, but exempt</b> from liability <b>for</b> the same <b>action</b> if he performed it <b>himself.</b> Conversely, there are also cases where one is <b>exempt</b> from liability <b>for the action of his ox, but liable for his own action.</b>

### Part 15
<b>How so?</b> If <b>his ox caused</b> a person <b>humilation,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation, <b>but</b> if <b>he</b> himself <b>humiliated</b> another, he is <b>liable.</b> Similarly, if <b>his ox blinded the eye of his slave or knocked out his</b> slave’s <b>tooth,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from having to emancipate the slave for this mutilation. <b>But if he</b> himself <b>blinded his slave’s eye or knocked out his tooth,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to emancipate him, as stated in the Torah (Exodus 21:26–27).

### Part 16
By contrast, if <b>his ox injured</b> the owner’s <b>father or his mother,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay damages, <b>but</b> if <b>he</b> himself <b>injured his father or his mother,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation. Similarly, if <b>his ox set fire to a haystack on Shabbat,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay damages. <b>But if he</b> himself <b>set fire to a haystack on Shabbat,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying damages. He is exempt from payment in these cases <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty for injuring his father or mother or for desecrating Shabbat.

### Part 17
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Abbahu taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan: Anyone who performs</b> labor <b>destructively</b> on Shabbat <b>is exempt, except for one who injures</b> another <b>or kindles</b> a fire. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Go out</b> and <b>teach</b> it <b>outside;</b> this <i>baraita</i> is not fit for discussion in the study hall. The opinion that deems one liable for <b>injuring</b> another <b>or kindling</b> a fire on Shabbat <b>is not a mishna</b> and should be ignored. <b>And if you say that it is a mishna, one who injures</b> another would be liable only in a case <b>where he requires</b> the blood to give <b>to his dog, and one who kindles</b> a fire would be liable only in a case <b>where he requires its ashes.</b> In these cases, the act is not purely destructive but has some constructive purpose.

### Part 18
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>his ox set fire to a haystack on Shabbat,</b> he is <b>liable. But</b> if <b>he</b> himself <b>set fire to a haystack on Shabbat,</b> he is <b>exempt. And</b> the mishna <b>is</b> presumably <b>teaching</b> a case where <b>he</b> set the fire in a scenario that is <b>similar to</b> the case <b>where his ox</b> did so. <b>Just as</b> in the case <b>where his ox</b> set the fire <b>it</b> clearly <b>does not need</b> the ashes, as an ox does not act with such intentions,
