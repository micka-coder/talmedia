### Part 1
One <b>might</b> have thought that he must give precedence to the cutting down of a barren tree <b>even</b> if the barren tree is <b>greater in monetary</b> value than the fruit-bearing tree. <b>The verse states: “Only,”</b> which teaches that there is an exception to the rule. Similarly, if the fruit-bearing tree itself would be worth more as lumber than for its fruits, it would be permitted for one to cut it down.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: The <b>sharecropper of Shmuel brought him dates.</b> Shmuel <b>ate</b> them, and <b>tasted the taste of wine in them. He said to</b> his sharecropper: <b>What is this?</b> The sharecropper <b>said to him:</b> The date palms <b>stand among the grapevines</b> and therefore contain a taste of wine from the grapes. Shmuel <b>said:</b> Do <b>they weaken the wine,</b> i.e., the grapevines, <b>so much</b> that it is possible to taste the wine in the dates? <b>Tomorrow,</b> cut down the date palms and <b>bring me from their marrow</b> to eat.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <b>Rav Ḥisda saw date palms</b> growing <b>among grapevines</b> on his estate. <b>He said to his sharecropper: Uproot the</b> date palms, since one can <b>purchase date palms</b> with <b>grapevines,</b> as grapevines are more valuable, while one <b>cannot purchase grapevines</b> with <b>date palms.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Despite</b> the fact <b>that</b> the assailant who caused damage <b>gives to</b> the victim all of the required payments for the injury, his transgression is <b>not forgiven for him</b> in the heavenly court <b>until he requests</b> forgiveness <b>from</b> the victim, <b>as it is stated</b> that God told Abimelech after he had taken Sarah from Abraham: <b>“Now therefore restore the wife</b> of the man; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for you, and you shall live” (Genesis 20:7). <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the victim <b>does not forgive him that he is cruel? As it is stated: “And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech,</b> and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore children” (Genesis 20:17).

### Part 5
The mishna continues: With regard to <b>one who says</b> to another: <b>Blind my eye,</b> or: <b>cut off my hand,</b> or: <b>break my leg,</b> and he does so, the one who performed these actions is <b>liable</b> to pay for the damage, despite having been instructed to do so. Even if he explicitly instructed him: Do so <b>on the condition that</b> you will <b>be exempt</b> from payment, he is nevertheless <b>liable.</b>

### Part 6
With regard to one who says to another: <b>Tear my garment,</b> or: <b>break my jug,</b> and he does so, he is <b>liable</b> to pay for the damage. But if he instructed him explicitly: Do so <b>on the condition that</b> you will <b>be exempt</b> from payment, he is <b>exempt</b> from payment. If one says to another: <b>Do so,</b> i.e., cause damage, <b>to so-and-so on the condition that</b> you will <b>be exempt</b> from payment, and he did so, he is <b>liable, whether</b> the instructions were <b>with regard to</b> the victim <b>himself,</b> or <b>whether</b> the instructions were <b>with regard to his property.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: All these</b> sums <b>that</b> in the previous mishna <b>they said</b> one is liable to pay for humiliating another are the <b>compensation for his humiliation,</b> for which there is a set amount. <b>But</b> for the victim’s <b>pain</b> caused by the assailant, <b>even if</b> the assailant <b>brings</b> as offerings <b>all the rams of Nebaioth</b> (see Isaiah 60:7) <b>that are in the world,</b> which are of the best quality, his transgression <b>is not forgiven for him</b> in the heavenly court <b>until he requests</b> forgiveness <b>from</b> the victim, <b>as it is stated: “Restore the wife of the man; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for you”</b> (Genesis 20:7).

### Part 8
Having quoted the verse, the Gemara asks: Shall one infer from here <b>that the wife of a prophet needs to be returned,</b> but <b>the wife of another</b> individual <b>need not be returned?</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara answers. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> This is how the verse should be understood: <b>“Restore the wife of the man” in any case,</b> since she is his wife. <b>And</b> with regard to that <b>which you,</b> Abimelech, <b>said: “Will you slay even a righteous nation? Did he not say himself to me: She is my sister, and she, even she herself, said: He is my brother?”</b> (Genesis 20:4–5), the answer is that you, Abimelech, are not so righteous, since the reason Abraham said that Sarah was his sister is that <b>he is a prophet, and he already learned</b> how to conduct himself based on your behavior. As with regard to <b>a guest [<i>akhsenai</i>] who comes to town, does one ask him about matters concerning eating and drinking, or does one ask him about matters concerning his wife?</b> Does one ask a guest: <b>Is she your wife? Is she your sister?</b> Abimelech was to be blamed, since Abraham thought that he intended to steal his wife.

### Part 10
The Gemara remarks: <b>From here</b> it can be derived <b>that a gentile is executed</b> for having transgressed a prohibition without awareness that the act was prohibited, <b>since he should have learned and he did not learn.</b>

### Part 11
Having mentioned the verses concerning the incident of Abraham and Abimelech, the Gemara explains other related verses. <b>“For the Lord had obstructed [<i>atzor atzar</i>]</b> all the wombs of the house of Abimelech” (Genesis 20:18). <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Why</b> are <b>these two obstructions [<i>atzor atzar</i>]</b> both stated? <b>One</b> is stated <b>with regard to a man,</b> that <b>semen</b> will not be discharged, and <b>two</b> are stated <b>with regard to a woman,</b> that <b>semen</b> will not be discharged from her, <b>and</b> that she will not give <b>birth.</b>

### Part 12
It <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: Two</b> are stated <b>with regard to a man: Semen and urine,</b> i.e., that the men were unable to both urinate and discharge semen; <b>three</b> are stated <b>with regard to a woman: Semen, and urine, and birth.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Ravina says: Three</b> are stated <b>with regard to a man: Semen, and urine, and</b> the <b>anal sphincter,</b> i.e., that they were unable to discharge stool as well. Consequently, they would be unable to relieve themselves at all. <b>Four</b> are stated <b>with regard to a woman: Semen, and birth, and urine, and</b> the <b>anal sphincter.</b>

### Part 14
The verse states: “For the Lord had obstructed <b>all the wombs</b> of the house of Abimelech.” The Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai say: Even a hen of the house of Abimelech did not lay her egg</b> during that time.

### Part 15
§ The Gemara cites a series of questions that Rava asked Rabba bar Mari, the first one being related to the previous topic of discussion. <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby the Sages stated: Anyone who asks</b> for <b>compassion</b> from Heaven <b>on</b> behalf of <b>another, and he requires</b> compassion from Heaven <b>concerning that same matter, he is answered first?</b> Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source for this is <b>as it is written: “And the Lord changed the fortune of Job, when he prayed for his friends”</b> (Job 42:10).

### Part 16
Rava <b>said to him: You said</b> the proof <b>from there,</b> from a verse in the Writings, <b>and I say</b> the proof <b>from here,</b> from a verse in the Torah. As it is written: <b>“And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants,</b> and they bore children” (Genesis 20:17), <b>and it is written</b> immediately following that: <b>“And the Lord remembered Sarah, as He had said”</b> (Genesis 21:1), with the pronoun interpreted homiletically: <b>As Abraham said with regard to Abimelech.</b> Because Abraham prayed for Abimelech that the women of his household should give birth, Abraham himself was answered concerning that matter.

### Part 17
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: The cabbage is damaged together with the thorn,</b> since the cabbage is sometimes harmed when the thorn is removed? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written: “Why will you contend with Me? You all have transgressed against Me, says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 2:29). The term “you all” includes even those who have not sinned.

### Part 18
Rava <b>said to him: You said</b> the proof <b>from there,</b> from a verse in the Prophets, <b>and I say</b> the proof <b>from here,</b> from a verse in the Torah. The Lord said to Moses after some of the people collected the manna on Shabbat: <b>“How long do you refuse [<i>me’antem</i>] to keep My commandments and My laws?”</b> (Exodus 16:28). The term “you refuse [<i>me’antem</i>]” is written in the plural, indicating that even Moses was included, although he did not sin.

### Part 19
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: It is written</b> with regard to Joseph: <b>“And from among his brothers he took five men,</b> and presented them to Pharaoh” (Genesis 47:2). <b>Who are these five</b> men? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him: This is what Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Those whose names were repeated</b> in the blessings with which Moses later blessed the twelve tribes. They are Dan, Zebulun, Gad, Asher, and Naftali (see Deuteronomy 35). Since they were weak, Joseph brought them before Pharaoh.

### Part 20
Rava said: <b>Judah also</b> had his name <b>repeated</b> in the blessings, and he was strong.

### Part 21
Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him: His</b> name <b>was repeated for his</b> own <b>matter, as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> concerning Reuben and Judah in Moses’ blessing of the tribes at the end of his life: <b>“Let Reuben live and not die in that his men become few”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:6), and immediately afterward in the following verse it states: <b>“And this for Judah,</b> and he said: Hear Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him in unto his people; may his hands fight on his behalf, and You shall be a help against his adversaries” (Deuteronomy 33:7)? What is the connection between the blessing of Reuben and that of Judah, juxtaposed with the conjunction “and”?

### Part 22
Rabbi Yoḥanan said: <b>All those forty years that the Jewish people were in the desert, the bones of Judah,</b> which the Jewish people took with them from Egypt along with the bones of his brothers, <b>were rolling</b> around <b>in the coffin, until Moses came and asked for mercy</b> on Judah’s behalf. Moses <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, who</b> served as the <b>impetus for Reuben that he should confess</b> his sin, through which he merited a blessing and was not excluded from the count of the twelve sons of Jacob (see Genesis 35:22)? It was <b>Judah,</b> as Reuben saw him confess his sin, and thereby did the same.

### Part 23
<b>Immediately</b> after Moses prayed, the verse states: <b>“Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:7). <b>His bones</b> then <b>entered</b> their <b>sockets [<i>leshafa</i>],</b> and his skeleton became attached. The angels still <b>did not elevate</b> him <b>into the heavenly study hall.</b> Moses then prayed: <b>“And bring him in unto his people”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:7), i.e., bring him to those in the heavenly study hall. This prayer was accepted, but <b>he</b> still <b>did not know what the sages were saying, and</b> he was unable <b>to deliberate</b> in Torah matters <b>with the sages.</b> Moses then prayed: <b>“May his hands fight on his behalf”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:7), meaning that he should have the ability to contend with them in study. But still <b>he was unable to draw</b> conclusions from <b>his discussion in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>.</b> Moses then prayed: <b>“And You shall be a help against his adversaries”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:7).

### Part 24
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: Poverty follows the poor?</b> Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him: As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:8): <b>Rich</b> people would <b>bring first fruits in baskets of gold and of silver, and poor</b> people would bring first fruits <b>in wicker baskets</b> made <b>of peeled willow,</b> and <b>they would give the baskets and the first fruits to the priests.</b> The rich would have their baskets returned to them, while the poor would not. Rava <b>said to him: You said</b> the proof <b>from there,</b> from a mishna, <b>and I say</b> the proof <b>from here,</b> from a verse in the Torah:
