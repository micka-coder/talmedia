<b>once he has conveyed the key to him, he has acquired</b> it.

### Part 2
Here too, the Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> involving this sale? <b>If</b> it was a transaction <b>by</b> payment of <b>money,</b> then <b>let</b> him <b>acquire</b> it <b>by</b> paying <b>money. If</b> it was <b>by taking possession</b> of it, <b>let</b> him <b>acquire</b> it <b>by taking possession.</b> What is the significance of transferring the key? The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the transaction occurred by <b>taking possession, and</b> in that case, the seller usually <b>must say to him: Go, take possession, and</b> thereby <b>acquire</b> it for yourself. <b>And</b> in this case, <b>once he conveys the key to him,</b> he is considered <b>like one who says to him: Go, take possession, and</b> thereby <b>acquire</b> it.

### Part 3
Similarly, <b>Reish Lakish says in the name of Rabbi Yannai:</b> With regard to one <b>who sells a flock</b> of sheep <b>to another, once he conveys the <i>mashkukhit</i> to</b> the buyer, <b>he has acquired</b> the flock.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If</b> the transaction occurred <b>by pulling</b> the flock into his possession, then <b>let</b> the buyer <b>acquire</b> it <b>by pulling. If</b> it was <b>by conveying</b> it, <b>let</b> the buyer <b>acquire</b> it <b>by</b> the seller <b>conveying</b> it. The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> it was a transaction <b>by pulling, and</b> in that case, the seller usually <b>must say to him: Go, pull</b> it <b>and acquire</b> it for yourself. <b>And</b> in this case, <b>once he conveys the <i>mashkukhit</i> to him,</b> he is <b>like one who says to him: Go, pull</b> it <b>and acquire</b> it.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this <b><i>mashkukhit</i>? Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they translate</b> it as <b>a bell [<i>karkashta</i>]</b> that the shepherd rings and whose sound the flock follows. <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says:</b> It is referring to <b>the goat that goes at the front</b> of <b>the flock</b> that they follow. The Gemara notes: This explanation of Rabbi Ya’akov is similar to <b>that which a certain Galilean taught in the presence of Rav Ḥisda concerning</b> this goat: <b>When a shepherd is angry with his flock, he renders</b> the goat <b>leading [<i>lenaggada</i>]</b> them, i.e., the <i>mashkukhit</i>, <b>blind.</b> Similarly, when God is angry with the Jewish people, he appoints unsuitable leaders for them.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna lists several <i>halakhot</i> that pertain to damage classified as Pit: In the case of a pit that <b>the first</b> person who passed by <b>covered</b> after using <b>it, and</b> then <b>the second came</b> to use it <b>and found it uncovered</b> after the cover fell off or was damaged, <b>and</b> he <b>did not cover it, the second</b> one is <b>liable</b> for damage caused by the pit. If the owner <b>covered</b> the pit <b>appropriately and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> If he <b>did not cover</b> the pit <b>appropriately and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died,</b> he is <b>liable.</b>

### Part 7
If a man was digging or widening a pit, and an ox passing by <b>fell forward</b> into it in fright <b>due to the sound</b> of <b>the digging,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> If it fell <b>backward</b> into the pit <b>due to the sound</b> of <b>the digging,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 8
If <b>an ox and its accoutrements,</b> i.e., the vessels it was carrying, <b>fell into</b> the pit <b>and</b> the vessels <b>were broken,</b> or if <b>a donkey and its accoutrements</b> fell in <b>and</b> the accoutrements <b>were torn,</b> the owner of the pit is <b>liable for</b> damage to <b>the animal</b> caused by the pit, <b>but</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from liability <b>for</b> damage caused to <b>the vessels,</b> by Torah edict.

### Part 9
If <b>an ox</b> that was impaired by being <b>deaf,</b> or an ox that was <b>an imbecile, or</b> an ox that was very <b>young fell into</b> the pit, he is <b>liable.</b> If <b>a boy or a girl,</b> a Canaanite <b>slave or</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant</b> fell in, he is <b>exempt,</b> since there is a Torah edict that the digger of a pit is liable only for damage caused to an animal.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the first case in the mishna, the Gemara asks: <b>And until when</b> is <b>the first</b> person <b>exempt</b> if the pit is later uncovered? <b>Rav says:</b> He is exempt from liability for the time necessary <b>for</b> him <b>to</b> become <b>aware</b> that it became uncovered. Once this time has passed, he bears responsibility. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> He is exempt for the time necessary <b>for</b> others <b>to</b> realize that the pit is uncovered and <b>inform him. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> He is exempt for the time necessary <b>for</b> others <b>to inform him</b> that the cover has fallen down <b>and</b> for him to <b>hire workers and cut cedar trees</b> to make a suitable cover <b>and cover it.</b> After this period of time has passed, the first bears responsibility.

### Part 11
§ The mishna teaches: If he <b>covered</b> the pit <b>appropriately and an ox or a donkey fell inside and died,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Since he covered</b> the pit <b>appropriately, how</b> did it <b>fall</b> in? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar bar Ḥana says:</b> This is a case <b>where</b> the cover <b>rotted from the inside,</b> and he could not have known that the cover was damaged. Therefore, he is not responsible for damage caused as a result.

### Part 12
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If he <b>covered it</b> with <b>a cover that</b> is <b>able to withstand</b> the weight of <b>oxen but cannot withstand</b> the weight of <b>camels,</b> which are heavier, <b>and camels came and weakened it, and</b> subsequently <b>oxen came</b> and broke the weakened cover <b>and fell into</b> the pit, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Sages <b>said</b> in response: <b>What are the circumstances? If camels are</b> commonly <b>found</b> there, <b>he is negligent,</b> since he should have constructed the cover suitably for camels as well. And <b>if camels are not</b> commonly <b>found</b> there, then <b>he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control</b> if by chance they did come and weaken the cover.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> camels <b>come occasionally,</b> in which case the question effectively becomes: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since they come occasionally, he is</b> considered <b>negligent, since he should have anticipated</b> their coming? <b>Or perhaps since now, in any event, there are no</b> camels, <b>he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a possible proof from the mishna: If he <b>covered</b> the pit <b>appropriately, and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> Now <b>what are the circumstances? If we say</b> that he covered it <b>appropriately for oxen and appropriately for camels,</b> then <b>how</b> did they <b>fall</b> in? <b>Rather, is it not</b> the case that he covered it with a covering that was <b>appropriate for oxen</b>
