### Part 1
<b>encircled by a serpent [<i>akhna</i>],</b> which had placed its tail in its mouth, completely encircling the cave and blocking the entrance. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to it: Serpent, serpent, open your mouth and</b> allow <b>the teacher</b> to <b>enter</b> and be <b>near the disciple, but</b> the serpent <b>did not open</b> its mouth to allow him entry. He then said: Allow <b>a colleague</b> to <b>enter</b> and be <b>near</b> his <b>colleague, but</b> still the serpent <b>did not open</b> its mouth. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Allow the <b>disciple</b> to <b>enter</b> and be <b>near the teacher,</b> referring to Rav Kahana as his own teacher. The snake then <b>opened</b> its mouth <b>for him</b> to allow him entry. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>requested</b> divine <b>mercy</b> from God and <b>raised</b> Rav Kahana from the dead.

### Part 2
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>Had I known that this was the Master’s manner</b> of appearance, <b>I would not have been offended. Now</b> let <b>the Master come with me</b> to the study hall. Rav Kahana <b>said to him: If you are able to request</b> divine <b>mercy</b> so <b>that I will not die again, I will go</b> with you, <b>and if not, I will not go</b> with you. The Gemara comments: <b>Since the time</b> decreed for his death <b>had passed, it had passed.</b>

### Part 3
Rabbi Yoḥanan then completely <b>awakened him</b> and <b>stood him up.</b> Thereafter, <b>he asked him</b> about <b>every uncertainty that he had, and</b> Rav Kahana <b>resolved</b> each of <b>them for him. And this is</b> the background to <b>that which Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> to his students on several occasions: What <b>I said was yours is</b> in fact <b>theirs,</b> i.e., I thought that the Torah scholars in Eretz Yisrael were the most advanced, but in fact the scholars of Babylonia are the most advanced, as evidenced by Rav Kahana’s knowledge.

### Part 4
§ The Gemara relates another incident pertaining to one who informed gentiles of the whereabouts of another Jew’s property. There was <b>a certain</b> individual <b>who showed Rabbi Abba’s silk [<i>ametakesa</i>]</b> to gentiles, who later seized it. <b>Rabbi Abbahu and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappi and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa sat</b> together to determine whether Rabbi Abba was entitled to compensation from the informer, <b>and Rabbi Ile’a sat next to them.</b>

### Part 5
The judges <b>thought to deem</b> the informer <b>liable</b> to reimburse Rabbi Abba <b>based upon that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 28b): If a judge <b>issued a judgment</b> and erred, and he <b>acquitted</b> one who was in fact <b>liable,</b> or <b>deemed liable</b> one who should have in fact been <b>acquitted,</b> or if he <b>ruled</b> that <b>a pure</b> item is <b>impure,</b> or <b>ruled</b> that <b>an impure</b> item is <b>pure,</b> and by doing so he caused a litigant a monetary loss, <b>what he did is done,</b> i.e., the judgment stands, <b>and</b> the judge <b>must pay</b> damages <b>from his home,</b> i.e., from his personal funds. This indicates that one is liable to pay for a financial loss that he causes even if his involvement was only through speech.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Ile’a said to them: This is</b> what <b>Rav says: And that</b> mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> the judge not only issued a ruling, but actively <b>took</b> the money from the one whom he found liable, <b>and gave</b> it to the other party <b>by</b> his own <b>hand.</b> Consequently, it cannot serve as a precedent to render the informer liable in this case. The Sages serving as judges <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abba: <b>Go to Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim and Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat, who rule</b> that there is <b>liability</b> for damage caused by <b>indirect</b> action.

### Part 7
Rabbi Abba <b>went to them,</b> and <b>they deemed</b> the informer <b>liable</b> to reimburse Rabbi Abba, as it is taught <b>in the mishna: If</b> the thugs seized the field <b>due to the robber, he is liable to provide</b> the owner with <b>a different field. And it was established that</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> an individual <b>showed</b> the field to thugs who later seized it. The <i>halakha</i> stated in the mishna would apply to this case as well.

### Part 8
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <b>a certain man</b> with <b>whom a silver cup was deposited. Thieves came upon him</b> in his home and <b>he took</b> the cup and <b>gave it to them.</b> The case <b>came before Rabba,</b> and Rabba <b>exempted him</b> from payment. <b>Abaye said to him: This</b> individual is <b>saving himself with another’s property,</b> and he should therefore be liable. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said,</b> in explanation of Rabba’s ruling: <b>We look</b> at his financial status: <b>If</b> the bailee <b>is a wealthy man,</b> the thieves <b>came with the intent</b> to steal <b>his</b> property, and he is therefore liable to pay, as he saved himself from financial loss by handing over another’s property. <b>And if</b> he is <b>not</b> wealthy, the thieves presumably <b>came with the intent</b> to steal <b>the silver</b> cup, and he is therefore exempt from liability.

### Part 9
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <b>a certain man with whom the purse</b> containing funds collected <b>for the redemption of captives was deposited. Thieves came upon him</b> and <b>he took</b> the purse and <b>gave it to them.</b> The case <b>came before Rabba,</b> and Rabba <b>exempted him</b> from payment. <b>Abaye said to him: But this</b> individual <b>is saving himself with another’s property,</b> and he should therefore be liable to pay. Rabba <b>said to him: You have no greater redemption of captives than this.</b> Since the man used the money to avoid being harmed by the thieves, Rabba considered the money to have been used for its intended purpose.

### Part 10
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <b>a certain man who hastened and brought his donkey</b> onboard <b>a ferry [<i>lemavra</i>] before</b> other <b>people boarded the ferry.</b> The donkey began to move around and <b>was about</b> to cause the boat <b>to sink. A certain</b> other <b>man came</b> and <b>pushed the donkey of that</b> first <b>man into the river, and it drowned.</b> The case <b>came before Rabba,</b> and Rabba <b>exempted him</b> from payment. <b>Abaye said to him: But this</b> individual <b>is saving himself with another’s property,</b> and he should therefore be liable to pay. Rabba <b>said to him: This</b> owner of the donkey <b>was</b> considered <b>a pursuer from the outset,</b> as he endangered the other travelers. It is permitted to stop a pursuer by any means necessary, including by destroying his property.

### Part 11
The Gemara notes that <b>Rabba</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rabba says:</b> In the case of <b>a pursuer who was chasing after another</b> in order <b>to kill him and</b> the pursuer <b>broke vessels</b> during the chase, <b>whether</b> they <b>belonged to the pursued</b> party <b>or to anyone</b> else, he is <b>exempt</b> from reimbursing the owner of the vessels. This is <b>because he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty for attempted murder and is consequently exempt from any monetary liability he incurs simultaneously.

### Part 12
<b>And a pursued</b> individual <b>who broke the vessels of the pursuer</b> is also <b>exempt</b> from payment, <b>as the pursuer’s property shall not be cherished more than his body,</b> i.e., his life. Since it is permitted to kill the pursuer in order to save his intended victim, it is permitted to destroy his property for that purpose. <b>But</b> if he destroyed property <b>belonging to anyone</b> else, he is <b>liable</b> to reimburse them, <b>as it is prohibited</b> for him <b>to save himself with another’s property.</b>

### Part 13
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>a pursuer who was chasing after</b> another <b>pursuer</b> in order <b>to save</b> the latter’s intended victim, <b>and</b> he <b>broke vessels</b> during the chase, <b>whether</b> they <b>belonged to the pursued</b> individual, i.e., the individual attempting murder, <b>or to anyone</b> else, he is <b>exempt</b> from payment. The Gemara notes: <b>And this is not</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>by</b> Torah <b>law, but if you do not say so, you</b> will <b>not have</b> any <b>person that saves another from a pursuer.</b> In order to encourage people to attempt to save the lives of others, the Sages instituted that one who damages another’s property in the process of saving a life is exempt from payment.

### Part 14
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>a river flooded</b> a misappropriated field, the robber <b>may say to</b> its owner: <b>That which is yours is before you,</b> and no compensation is required. Since the field would have been flooded in any case, the robber has not caused the damage to the field, and is therefore exempt.

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> In the case of <b>one who robbed a field from another and a river</b> then <b>flooded it,</b> the robber is <b>liable to provide</b> the field’s owner with <b>a different field.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Elazar. And the Rabbis say:</b> He is exempt from doing so, as <b>he</b> can <b>say to</b> the owner: <b>That which is yours is before you.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara analyzes this dispute: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Elazar interpreted</b> the verses: “If any one sin, and commit a trespass against the Lord, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit…or anything about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full” (Leviticus 5:21–24), according to the hermeneutical principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions.</b> The phrase: “If any one sin, and commit a trespass against the Lord, <b>and deal falsely with his neighbor,”</b> is <b>an amplification.</b> When the verse states: <b>“In a matter of deposit,”</b> it has <b>restricted</b> the <i>halakha</i> to the case of a deposit. When the verse then states: <b>“Or anything about which he has sworn falsely,</b> he shall restore it in full,” <b>it</b> has <b>then amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> again.

### Part 17
Accordingly, as the Torah <b>amplified and</b> then <b>restricted and</b> then <b>amplified</b> again, it has <b>amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include <b>everything,</b> with only a single exception. <b>And what</b> is included due to the fact that the verse <b>has amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The verse <b>has amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include <b>everything</b> that one steals.

### Part 18
<b>And what</b> is excluded due to the fact that the verse <b>restricted</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>It restricted</b> the <i>halakha</i> in order to exclude financial <b>documents,</b> which are dissimilar to a deposit in that their value is not intrinsic, but rather due to their function. Consequently, according to Rabbi Elazar, land that was stolen is included in the <i>halakhot</i> stated in these verses, and one who steals land must reimburse the field’s owner.

### Part 19
<b>And the Rabbis interpreted</b> these verses according to the hermeneutical principle of <b>generalizations and details.</b> The phrase: <b>“And deal falsely</b> with his neighbor,” is <b>a generalization,</b> while the subsequent phrase: <b>“In a matter of deposit,”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> When the verse then states: <b>“Or anything</b> about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full,” <b>it</b> has <b>then generalized</b> again. In a case of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail.</b>

### Part 20
Accordingly, <b>just as the detail,</b> i.e., a deposit, <b>is movable property and</b> has <b>intrinsic monetary</b> value, <b>so too,</b> the verse includes <b>anything that is movable property and</b> has <b>intrinsic monetary</b> value. Consequently, <b>land has been excluded, as it is not movable property. Slaves have been excluded, as they are compared to land</b> with regard to many areas of <i>halakha</i>. Financial <b>documents have been excluded because, although they</b> are <b>movable property, they do not</b> have <b>intrinsic monetary</b> value.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> there is <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who robbed</b> another of <b>a cow and a river washed it away,</b> the robber is <b>liable to provide</b> the owner with another <b>cow;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Elazar. And the Rabbis say:</b> The robber can <b>say to</b> the owner: <b>That which is yours is before you,</b> and he would consequently be exempt. The Gemara asks: <b>There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>with regard to what do they disagree?</b> The rationale offered previously cannot apply, as a cow is movable property and has intrinsic value, and yet Rabbi Elazar and the Rabbis still disagree.

### Part 22
<b>Rav Pappa said: There, with what are we dealing?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he</b> had <b>robbed another of a field, and there was</b>
