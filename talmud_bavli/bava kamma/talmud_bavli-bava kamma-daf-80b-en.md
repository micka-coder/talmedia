### Part 1
<b>Shmuel would not enter before Rav Asi,</b> as he considered Rav Asi to be greater than he; and <b>Rav Asi would not enter before Rav,</b> as Rav was his teacher. <b>They said: Which</b> of us <b>should stay behind</b> and let the other two come in before him? They decided: <b>Let Shmuel stay behind, and let Rav and Rav Asi come</b> inside in that order. Afterward, Shmuel himself would enter.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why didn’t they decide to <b>let Rav or Rav Asi stay behind?</b> The Gemara explains: It was <b>a mere gesture that Rav performed for Shmuel</b> in initially stating that Shmuel should precede him, as Rav did not really feel that Shmuel was superior to him. Rather, <b>on account of that incident</b> in <b>which</b> he inadvertently <b>cursed</b> Shmuel, <b>Rav took upon himself</b> to treat Shmuel with deference.

### Part 3
<b>In the meantime,</b> while all this was going on, <b>a cat [<i>shunara</i>] came and severed the hand of the baby. Rav emerged</b> from the house <b>and taught:</b> With regard to <b>a cat, it is permitted to kill it</b> even if it is privately owned; <b>and it is prohibited to maintain it</b> in one’s possession; <b>and it is not subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>theft</b> if one takes it from its owner; <b>and,</b> in the case of a lost cat, <b>it is not subject to</b> the obligation of <b>returning a lost item to its owner.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Rav’s statement: <b>And since you said</b> that <b>it is permitted to kill it, what is</b> the need to state <b>further</b> that <b>it is prohibited to maintain it</b> in one’s possession? If a cat is considered such a dangerous animal that it is permitted to kill it, of course one cannot keep it in his possession. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that although Rav ruled that <b>it is permitted to kill it,</b> he concedes that <b>there is no prohibition</b> in keeping it, Rav therefore <b>teaches us</b> that it is also prohibited to keep it in one’s possession.

### Part 5
The Sages <b>say,</b> further questioning Rav’s statement: <b>And since you said</b> that <b>it is not subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>theft</b> if one takes it from its owner, <b>what is</b> the need to state <b>further</b> that <b>it is not subject to</b> the obligation of <b>returning a lost item to its owner</b> in the case of a lost cat? If one may actively steal a cat, certainly there is no obligation to return it when found. <b>Ravina said</b> in response: Rav was referring <b>to its hide.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> against Rav’s ruling that it is prohibited to keep a cat. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: One may raise village dogs, cats, monkeys, and genets, because they serve to clean the house</b> of mice and other vermin. The Gemara resolves the apparent contradiction: It is <b>not difficult. This</b> ruling in the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to a black</b> cat, which is harmless, whereas <b>that</b> ruling of Rav is stated <b>with regard to a white</b> cat, which is dangerous.

### Part 7
The Gemara raises a difficulty against this answer: <b>But</b> in <b>the incident of Rav</b> it <b>was a black</b> cat. Since this cat severed the baby’s hand, it was obviously a vicious, dangerous animal. The Gemara answers: <b>There it was a black</b> cat, but it was <b>the offspring of a white</b> one. The offspring of a white cat is dangerous, even if it itself is black. The Gemara further objects: <b>But didn’t Ravina raise this</b> very issue <b>as a dilemma?</b>

### Part 8
<b>As Ravina raised a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a black</b> cat that is <b>the offspring of a white</b> one? Is it also dangerous like its parent? The Gemara answers: <b>When Ravina raised the dilemma,</b> it was <b>with regard to a black</b> cat that is <b>the offspring of a white</b> cat that itself is <b>the offspring of a black</b> cat. By contrast, in <b>the incident with Rav</b> it <b>was a black</b> cat that was <b>the offspring of a white</b> one, which was itself <b>the offspring of a white</b> cat. That animal is definitely dangerous.

### Part 9
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the distinguishing letters in the various names of the sons of Rav Pappa in the ensuing list: <b><i>Ḥet beit dalet</i>, <i>beit yod ḥet</i>, <i>beit ḥet nun</i>. Rabbi Aḥa bar Pappa says</b> the following three statements <b>in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Pappa,</b> who said them <b>in the name of Rabbi Adda bar Pappa. And some say Rabbi Abba bar Pappa says</b> them <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Pappa,</b> who said them <b>in the name of Rabbi Aḥa bar Pappa. And some say Rabbi Abba bar Pappa says</b> them <b>in the name of Rabbi Aḥa bar Pappa,</b> who said them <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa.</b>

### Part 10
The three statements are as follows: The court <b>sounds the alarm on Shabbat over</b> a breakout of <b>sores; and a door that is locked will not be opened quickly; and</b> with regard to <b>one who purchases a house in Eretz Yisrael, one writes a bill of sale for</b> this transaction <b>even on Shabbat.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: After explaining how the public engages in prayer when there is a drought, the <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all other types of calamities that break out upon the community,</b> other than drought, <b>such as sores,</b> a plague of <b>locusts, flies, hornets, or mosquitoes, or infestations of snakes or scorpions,</b> the court <b>would not sound the alarm</b> on Shabbat, <b>but</b> the people would <b>cry out.</b> This indicates that it is not proper to sound the alarm on Shabbat for an epidemic of sores.

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here</b> it is referring <b>to moist</b> sores; whereas <b>there</b> it is referring <b>to dry</b> sores, which are more dangerous than moist ones. <b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> The <b>boils that the Holy One, Blessed be He, brought upon the Egyptians</b> were <b>moist on the outside and dry on the inside, as it is stated: “And it became a boil breaking out with oozing upon man and upon beast”</b> (Exodus 9:10). The phrase “breaking out” is referring to the exterior of the wound. Since the verse specifies that the outside was oozing with secretions, it can be inferred that the inside was dry. This indicates that the sores can be of either type.

### Part 13
The Gemara analyzes the second of the three statements: <b>And a door that is locked will not be opened quickly.</b> This is clearly a metaphor, but to <b>what is it</b> referring? <b>Mar Zutra said:</b> It is a metaphor for rabbinic <b>ordination.</b> If one meets with resistance in his quest to receive ordination, he should take it as a sign that this opportunity will not soon open up for him again. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It means that <b>anyone who is treated poorly will not soon be treated well. Rav Aḥa of Difti said: He will never be treated well.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so; Rav Aḥa of Difti was saying</b> only <b>a matter</b> that reflected what had occurred <b>to him.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara turns its attention to the third statement: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>one who purchases a house in Eretz Yisrael, one writes a bill of sale for</b> this transaction <b>even on Shabbat.</b> The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that one may write this bill of sale <b>on Shabbat?</b> Writing on Shabbat is a prohibited labor for which one is liable to receive the death penalty.

### Part 15
The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> this is <b>as Rava said there,</b> with regard to a similar issue, that one <b>tells a gentile</b> to do it, <b>and he does</b> so. <b>Here, too,</b> it is referring to a situation where he <b>tells a gentile</b> to write a bill of sale for the house, <b>and he does</b> it. <b>And even though telling a gentile</b> to perform an action that is prohibited for a Jew on Shabbat <b>is</b> generally a violation of <b>a rabbinic decree,</b> as the Sages prohibited telling a gentile to perform prohibited labor on behalf of a Jew on Shabbat, here <b>the Sages did not</b> impose this <b>decree, due to</b> the mitzva of <b>settling Eretz Yisrael.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> With regard to <b>one who purchases a city in Eretz Yisrael,</b> the court <b>forces him to purchase a path to</b> the city <b>from</b> all <b>four</b> of <b>its sides, due to</b> the importance of <b>settling Eretz Yisrael.</b>

### Part 17
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Joshua stipulated ten conditions</b> when he apportioned Eretz Yisrael among the tribes:
