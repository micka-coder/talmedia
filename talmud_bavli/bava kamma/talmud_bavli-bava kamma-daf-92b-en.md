### Part 1
The verse states with regard to one diagnosed with leprosy: “And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, <b>and he shall cry: Unclean, unclean”</b> (Leviticus 13:45). Not only must the leper suffer from the leprosy itself; he must undergo further embarrassment by publicizing his condition. This is akin to the aphorism that poverty follows the poor.

### Part 2
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby the Sages stated: Awaken early and eat, in the summer due to the heat and in the winter due to the cold. And</b> similarly, <b>people say: Sixty runners run and do not reach the man who ate in the morning.</b> Rabba bar Mari said to him that the source is <b>as it is written: “They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them”</b> (Isaiah 49:10), indicating that one who is not hungry or thirsty will not be affected by the weather.

### Part 3
Rava <b>said to him: You said</b> the proof <b>from there,</b> from a verse in the Prophets, <b>and I say</b> the proof <b>from here,</b> from a verse in the Torah. The verse states: “And you shall serve the Lord your God, and He will bless your bread and your water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of you” (Exodus 23:25). Rava explicates: <b>“And you shall serve the Lord your God”; this</b> is referring to the <b>recitation of <i>Shema</i> and prayer. “And He will bless your bread and your water”; this</b> is referring to <b>bread</b> dipped <b>in salt, and a flask of water</b> drunk after the bread, in the mornings. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward</b> the remainder of the verse applies: <b>“And I will take sickness away from the midst of you.”</b>

### Part 4
<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Sickness”; this</b> is referring to <b>bile. And why is its name called sickness [<i>maḥala</i>]?</b> It is called this <b>since there are eighty-three sicknesses in</b> bile. The letters spelling the word <b><i>maḥala</i>,</b> i.e., <i>mem</i>, <i>ḥet</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>heh</i>, <b>have that numerical value</b> of eighty-three. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of those</b> sicknesses, eating <b>bread</b> dipped <b>in salt</b> in the <b>morning and</b> drinking <b>a flask of water</b> afterward <b>negates them.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby the Sages stated:</b> If <b>your friend calls you a donkey, prepare a saddle for your back,</b> i.e., do not contest his statement? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written</b> in the conversation between the angel and Hagar: <b>“And he said: Hagar, maidservant of Sarai, from where did you come and to where are you going? And she said: I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai”</b> (Genesis 16:8). Though Hagar was no longer the maidservant of Sarai, since the angel referred to her as such, she responded in kind.

### Part 6
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say:</b> If you are aware of <b>a derogatory matter that is</b> found <b>in you, say it first</b> before others say it about you? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to Eliezer: <b>“And he said: I am Abraham’s servant”</b> (Genesis 24:34), immediately proclaiming that he is a servant.

### Part 7
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: The goose stoops</b> its head <b>as it goes</b> along, <b>but its eyes</b> look <b>afar</b> to find food for itself? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to Abigail’s statement to David: <b>“And when the Lord shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember your maidservant”</b> (I Samuel 25:31). Although Abigail spoke with humility in her request that David spare her husband’s life, she made reference to deriving future benefit from David.

### Part 8
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: Sixty discomforts come to the teeth [<i>lekhakha</i>]</b> of one <b>who hears the sound of another</b> eating <b>and does not eat?</b> Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to what Nathan the prophet said concerning the coronation banquet of Adonijah, to which he was not invited: “For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king’s sons…<b>But me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he has not called”</b> (I Kings 1:25–26).

### Part 9
Rava <b>said to him: You said</b> the proof <b>from there,</b> from a verse in the Prophets, <b>and I say</b> the proof <b>from here,</b> from a verse in the Torah. As it is written: <b>“And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her, and Isaac was comforted for his mother”</b> (Genesis 24:67). <b>And it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah”</b> (Genesis 25:1). After seeing his son marry, Abraham was disquieted by the fact he was not married. This is akin to one who sees another eating and does not eat.

### Part 10
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say:</b> While <b>the wine</b> belongs <b>to its owner, the gratitude</b> is given <b>to the one who pours it?</b> Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to God commanding Moses to transfer his authority to Joshua: “And the Lord said unto Moses: Take you Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is spirit, <b>and lay your hand upon him…that all the congregation of the children of Israel may hearken”</b> (Numbers 27:18–20). <b>And it is written: “And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children of Israel hearkened unto him,</b> and did as the Lord commanded Moses” (Deuteronomy 34:9). Although the spirit of God was not given to Joshua by Moses, as Moses was only a conduit, he was given credit for it.

### Part 11
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: A dog, in its hunger, swallows</b> even <b>dung?</b> Rabba bar Mari said to him that the source is <b>as it is written: “The full soul loathes a honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet”</b> (Proverbs 27:7).

### Part 12
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: A bad palm tree strolls and goes</b> to be <b>among a grove of barren trees,</b> i.e., bad people seek out other bad people? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him: This matter is written in the Torah, repeated in the Prophets, and triplicated in the Writings, and we learned</b> it <b>in a mishna, and we learned</b> it <b>in a <i>baraita</i>.</b>

### Part 13
Rabba bar Mari explains each of the sources. It <b>is written in the Torah, as it is written: “And so Esau went to Ishmael”</b> (Genesis 28:9). It <b>is repeated in the Prophets, as it is written: “And there were gathered vain fellows to Yiftah, and they went out with him”</b> (Judges 11:3). <b>And</b> it <b>is triplicated in the Writings, as it is written: All fowl will live with its kind, and men with those like him</b> (Book of Ben Sira 13:17). <b>We learned</b> it <b>in a mishna</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 12:2): <b>All that is attached to</b> that which is <b>ritually impure</b> is <b>ritually impure; all that is attached to</b> that which is <b>ritually pure</b> is <b>ritually pure. And we learned</b> it <b>in a <i>baraita</i>: Rabbi Eliezer says: Not for naught</b> did the <b>starling go to the raven but because it is its kind,</b> as it too is a non-kosher bird.

### Part 14
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say:</b> If <b>you called</b> to <b>your friend and he did not answer you, throw a large wall</b> and <b>cast it at him,</b> i.e., do not attempt to help him anymore? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is as it is written: <b>“Because I have purged you and you were not purged, you shall not be purged from your impurity anymore,</b> until I have satisfied My fury upon you” (Ezekiel 24:13).

### Part 15
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say:</b> If there is <b>a well that you drank from, do not throw a stone into it?</b> Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written: “You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother; you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a stranger in his land”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:8). Since you dwelled in their lands, you may not cause them harm.

### Part 16
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: If you lift the load</b> with me <b>I will lift</b> it, <b>and if</b> you will <b>not</b> lift it with me <b>I won’t lift</b> it? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to Barak and Deborah concerning the war of Sisera: <b>“And Barak said to her: If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go”</b> (Judges 4:8).

### Part 17
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: When we were small,</b> we were considered <b>to</b> be <b>men; now that we are old,</b> we are considered <b>to</b> be <b>children [<i>ledardekei</i>]?</b> Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is that <b>initially, it is written</b> with regard to the Jewish people traveling in the wilderness: <b>“And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light”</b> (Exodus 13:21). God Himself guarded over the Jewish people. <b>But at the end,</b> after some time passed and it would be expected that the Jewish people were considered more important, <b>it is written:</b>
