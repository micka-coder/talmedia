### Part 1
<b>And</b> the other <b>one said:</b> They studied there for <b>seven</b> days. <b>And some say</b> they studied there for <b>thirty</b> days.

### Part 2
<b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that offers another interpretation of the verse cited: <b>“And afforded him [<i>lo</i>] honor in his death”</b> (II Chronicles 32:33). <b>This</b> is referring to the honor given to <b>Hezekiah, king of Judea, that</b> at his burial <b>36,000</b> men with <b>bared shoulders went out before him.</b> They removed their robes from their shoulders as a sign of mourning. The number 36,000 is alluded to by the numerical value of the word <i>lo</i>, which is thirty-six. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: But didn’t they</b> also <b>do this before Ahab?</b> Apparently, if they did this for the wicked king Ahab, it is an honor shown to all kings, and it is was not a unique show of honor for the righteous Hezekiah.

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> the honor that was done for Hezekiah was <b>that they laid a Torah scroll upon his bier and they said: This one,</b> i.e., Hezekiah, <b>fulfilled that which is written in this,</b> i.e., the Torah scroll.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>But nowadays as well, we do this</b> for any great Torah scholar that dies, so what is unique about what was done to honor Hezekiah? The Gemara answers: Nowadays, <b>we take</b> a Torah scroll <b>out</b> but <b>we do not lay</b> it on the bier of the deceased. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that nowadays <b>we also lay</b> a Torah scroll on the bier of the deceased; but <b>we do not say:</b> This one <b>fulfilled</b> that which is written in this.

### Part 6
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: I was</b> once <b>walking together with Rabbi Yoḥanan to ask</b> him about this <b>statement. Whenever he would enter a lavatory,</b> upon his exit <b>I would ask him</b> to explain <b>a matter,</b> and <b>he would not answer us until he had washed his hands and donned his phylacteries and made</b> the <b>blessing, and</b> only <b>then would he answer us.</b> With regard to the honor given to King Hezekiah, he said: Nowadays, <b>we even say:</b> This one <b>fulfilled</b> that which is written in this, but <b>we do not say: He taught</b> that which is written in this, which was a unique honor performed at the burial of the righteous King Hezekiah.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t the Master say: Torah study is great because</b> the <b>study</b> of Torah <b>leads to</b> one’s <b>performance</b> of the mitzvot? This indicates that the performance of mitzvot is considered of greater value than Torah study. If so, once Hezekiah had been praised with the fact that he fulfilled the mitzvot of the Torah, why mention that he studied it? The Gemara explains: This is <b>not difficult: This</b> statement of the Master is <b>about studying</b> the Torah for one’s own knowledge, and <b>that</b> unique praise given to King Hezekiah was <b>about teaching</b> the Torah to others.

### Part 8
§ A verse that was cited at the beginning of the this chapter (2b) as part of a halakhic exposition is now explained homiletically: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Happy are you that sow beside all waters, that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20)? It teaches that <b>whoever engages in</b> the study of <b>Torah and in</b> the performance of <b>acts of kindness merits</b> reward equal to <b>the portion of two tribes,</b> Joseph and Issachar.

### Part 9
The Gemara explains how this is derived from the verse: <b>As it is stated: “Happy are you that sow.” And</b> the reference to <b>sowing</b> refers <b>only</b> to acts of <b>charity, as it is stated: “Sow for yourselves for charity, reap according to kindness”</b> (Hosea 10:12). <b>And</b> the reference to <b>water</b> refers <b>only</b> to the study of <b>Torah, as it is stated</b> with regard to Torah study: <b>“Ho, all who are thirsty, go to water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1).

### Part 10
<b>And</b> the fact that <b>he merits</b> reward equal to <b>the portion of two tribes</b> is derived as follows: The reference to the ox in the verse is an allusion to Joseph, who is described as an ox (Deuteronomy 33:17), and one’s reward is that <b>he merits to</b> receive <b>a canopy</b> of honor, <b>as</b> did <b>Joseph, as it is written: “Joseph is a fruitful vine,</b> a fruitful vine by a fountain; <b>its branches run over the wall.”</b> The branches over the wall in this verse allude to the canopy. <b>And</b> the reference to the donkey is an allusion to the fact that <b>he merits</b> to receive <b>the portion of Issachar,</b> who is described as a donkey, <b>as it is stated: “Issachar is a large-boned donkey”</b> (Genesis 49:14).

### Part 11
<b>There are</b> some <b>who say</b> that the comparison should be understood in a different manner. <b>His enemies will fall before him</b> just <b>like</b> in the blessing given by Moses to the tribe of <b>Joseph, as it is written</b> in the blessing bestowed by Moses to the tribe of Joseph: “His horns are the horns of the wild-ox; <b>with them he shall gore the nations, even to the ends of the earth”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17). <b>And he merits the understanding of Issachar, as it is written: “And of the children of Issachar, men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do”</b> (I Chronicles 12:33).

end of chapter

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna in the previous chapter (15b) teaches that the owner of an animal is always forewarned with regard to the category of Trampling. The mishna elaborates: For <b>what</b> damage caused with <b>the hoof</b> is the animal deemed <b>forewarned?</b> It is deemed forewarned with regard <b>to</b> trampling objects and <b>breaking</b> them <b>in the course of its walking. An animal is</b> deemed <b>forewarned with regard to walking in its</b> typical <b>manner and,</b> by doing so, <b>breaking</b> objects as it proceeds.

### Part 14
By contrast, if the animal <b>was kicking</b> while it was walking, <b>or</b> it transpired <b>that pebbles were</b> inadvertently <b>propelled from under its feet and</b> those pebbles <b>broke vessels,</b> cases of that kind do not fit precisely into the primary category of Trampling. In both of these cases the owner of the animal <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b> If an animal <b>trod upon a vessel and broke it and</b> then a shard of that vessel <b>fell upon</b> a second <b>vessel and broke it,</b> the owner <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage for the first</b> vessel, as its action is classified under the primary category of Trampling, <b>and he pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage for the latter</b> vessel, as the damage caused by the shard is tantamount to damage caused by pebbles inadvertently propelled by the foot of an animal.

### Part 15
<b>Chickens are</b> deemed <b>forewarned</b> with regard <b>to walking in their</b> typical <b>manner and breaking</b> objects, and therefore, the owner of a chicken pays the full restitution for the damage done to any objects broken by his chicken. If there <b>was a string [<i>delil</i>] tied to</b> a chicken’s <b>leg</b> as an indication of ownership and it wrapped around a vessel and broke it, <b>or</b> if the chicken <b>was hopping</b> in an atypical manner <b>and breaking vessels,</b> its owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
