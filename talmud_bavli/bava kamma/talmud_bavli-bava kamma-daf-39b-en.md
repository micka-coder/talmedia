### Part 1
people <b>will refrain from becoming</b> stewards, fearing that they would incur a financial loss by having to pay for damage caused by the orphans’ animals. By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says</b> that it is collected <b>from the superior-quality</b> property <b>of the steward, and</b> there is no concern that people will refrain from becoming stewards, because if they pay for the orphans <b>they are subsequently repaid by the orphans when they grow up.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> the matter of whether or not the court <b>appoints stewards for</b> the halakhically incompetent owners <b>of an innocuous</b> ox <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>collecting</b> damages <b>from</b> the sale of <b>its body</b> if it gores <b>is</b> subject to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b>

### Part 3
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an ox whose owner became a deaf-mute, or whose owner became an imbecile, or whose owner went overseas,</b> if the ox gores, <b>Yehuda ben Nakosa</b> said that <b>Sumakhos said: It retains its</b> status of <b>innocuousness until</b> the court <b>renders it forewarned in the presence of the owner. And the Rabbis say:</b> The court <b>appoints stewards for them, and</b> the ox <b>is rendered forewarned in the presence of the stewards.</b>

### Part 4
If <b>the deaf-mute regained his hearing,</b> or <b>the imbecile became</b> halakhically <b>competent, or the minor reached majority, or its owner came</b> back <b>from overseas, Yehuda ben Nakosa</b> said that <b>Sumakhos said:</b> The ox <b>has reverted to its</b> previous status of <b>innocuousness, until it is rendered forewarned in the presence of the owner. Rabbi Yosei said:</b> The ox <b>retains its status</b> of being forewarned.

### Part 5
The Sages <b>said: What did Sumakhos</b> mean <b>by saying</b> that <b>it retains its</b> status of <b>innocuousness? If we say that</b> he meant that <b>it is not rendered forewarned at all,</b> and is still considered innocuous, <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> Sumakhos himself <b>teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> that the ox <b>has reverted to its</b> previous status of <b>innocuousness,</b> it is clear <b>by inference that</b> previously <b>it was rendered forewarned.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rather, what</b> did Sumakhos mean by saying that <b>it retains its</b> status of <b>innocuousness [<i>betammuto</i>]?</b> He meant that <b>it retains its completeness [<i>bitmimuto</i>], as we do not reduce its</b> owner’s share of it by collecting compensation from the sale of its body. Rather, the injured party must wait until the owner becomes competent or returns. <b>Apparently,</b> the court <b>does not appoint a steward for</b> the owner <b>of an innocuous</b> ox to enable the injured party <b>to collect</b> damages <b>from its body. And the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Sumakhos, <b>say</b> that the court <b>appoints a steward for</b> the owner <b>and renders</b> the ox <b>forewarned in the presence of the steward. Apparently,</b> they hold that the court <b>does appoint a steward for</b> the owner <b>of an innocuous</b> ox to enable the injured party <b>to collect</b> damages <b>from its body.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>with regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to whether a change of <b>custody changes</b> the status of the ox. <b>Sumakhos holds</b> that a change of <b>custody changes</b> the status of the ox, <b>whereas Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that a change of <b>custody does not change</b> it; rather, it is determined by the actions of the ox itself, regardless of its custody.

### Part 8
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an ox that gored</b> that belonged to <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, Rabbi Ya’akov pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What did Rabbi Ya’akov do</b> that he should pay for the damage? <b>Rather,</b> emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>say: Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that <b>he pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>With what are we dealing? If</b> it is <b>with regard to an innocuous</b> ox, <b>isn’t</b> this <b>obvious? Everyone</b> else <b>also</b> holds that one <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> caused by their ox that gored, so what is the novel element of Rabbi Ya’akov’s statement? <b>And if</b> it is <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox it is unclear why the owner pays half the cost of the damage, as <b>if</b> it is a case <b>where he provided</b> adequate <b>safeguarding for it he is not required to pay at all, and if</b> it is a case <b>where he did not provide</b> adequate <b>safeguarding for it he is required to pay the entire</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rava said: Actually,</b> Rabbi Ya’akov stated his ruling <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox, <b>and here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where he provided reduced safeguarding and did not provide superior safeguarding for it.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And Rabbi Ya’akov holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that when an ox is rendered forewarned the liability for <b>its element of innocuousness remains in place.</b> In other words, with regard to half of the damages, it is treated like an innocuous ox, and it is treated as a forewarned ox only with regard to the other half of the damages. Therefore, half the cost of the damage is still collected from the proceeds of the sale of its body. <b>And</b> furthermore, with regard to another issue Rabbi Ya’akov <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that although superior safeguarding is necessary for an innocuous ox, <b>reduced safeguarding is sufficient for a forewarned</b> ox. Consequently, one who safeguards his forewarned ox in this manner is exempt from paying the additional half that he would be liable to pay due to the ox’s forewarned status. He is liable with respect to the half that he pays due to its remaining element of innocuousness.

### Part 13
<b>And</b> Rabbi Ya’akov also <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that the court <b>appoints a steward for</b> the owner <b>of an innocuous</b> ox to enable the injured party <b>to collect</b> damages <b>from its body.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Ya’akov rules that in the case in the <i>baraita</i>, where a forewarned ox owned by a halakhically incompetent person is safeguarded in a reduced fashion, half the cost of the damage must be paid from the proceeds of the sale of its body.

### Part 14
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>But do</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Ya’akov <b>not disagree</b> with regard to this matter? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that with regard to <b>an ox of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, that gored, Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the owner <b>liable, and Rabbi Ya’akov says that he pays</b> only <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage? Rabba bar Ulla says:</b> There is no disagreement here; <b>Rabbi Ya’akov</b> merely <b>explained what Rabbi Yehuda deems him liable</b> to pay.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Abaye, who says</b> that Rabbi Ya’akov and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree, with regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: Abaye could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>here we are dealing with a forewarned</b> ox whose owner <b>did not safeguard it at all</b> and that is consequently liable for the full cost of the damage.

### Part 17
And <b>Rabbi Ya’akov holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to one</b> issue <b>and disagrees with him with regard to one</b> issue. <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to one</b> issue, <b>as Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that when an ox is rendered forewarned <b>its element of innocuousness remains in its place,</b> and Rabbi Ya’akov agrees. <b>And he disagrees with him with regard to one</b> issue, <b>as Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the court <b>appoints a steward for</b> the owner <b>of an innocuous</b> ox to enable the injured party <b>to collect</b> damages <b>from its body, whereas Rabbi Ya’akov holds</b> that the court <b>does not appoint</b> a steward. Therefore, the owner is exempt from paying the half for which he would be liable due to the ox’s element of innocuousness, <b>and pays only the half</b> damages he is liable to pay <b>due to</b> its <b>forewarned</b> status.

### Part 18
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Abaye said to Ravina: Granted, according to Abaye, who says</b> that <b>they disagree,</b> the explanation <b>works out well. But according to Rava, who says</b> that <b>they do not disagree, instead of interpreting</b> the <i>baraita</i> as referring <b>to a forewarned</b> ox, <b>he should have interpreted it</b> as referring <b>to an innocuous</b> ox.
