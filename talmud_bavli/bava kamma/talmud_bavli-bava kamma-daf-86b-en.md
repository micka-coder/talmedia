### Part 1
say that the <i>baraita</i> discusses a case involving a minor <b>who</b> has reached a stage in which when <b>others humiliate him he feels humiliation.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who humiliates a naked person,</b> or <b>one who humiliates a blind person, or one who humiliates a sleeping person</b> is <b>liable, but a sleeping person who humiliates</b> another is <b>exempt.</b> If one <b>fell from the roof</b> onto another person, <b>and</b> thereby <b>caused</b> him <b>damage and humiliated</b> him, then the one who fell is <b>liable for the</b> indemnity of <b>damage,</b> since a person is always considered forewarned, <b>and exempt from the</b> indemnity of <b>humiliation,</b> since a person is not liable for humiliation <b>unless he intends</b> to humiliate the other person.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:12): If one <b>humiliated</b> another who was <b>naked,</b> he is <b>liable, but</b> the magnitude of humiliation felt when he <b>humiliated him</b> while <b>naked is not comparable to</b> the magnitude of humiliation felt had he <b>humiliated him</b> while <b>clothed,</b> since one who chooses to be naked is less sensitive to humiliation. Similarly, if one <b>humiliated</b> another <b>in a bathhouse,</b> he is <b>liable, but</b> the magnitude of humiliation felt when he <b>humiliated him in a bathhouse is not comparable to</b> the magnitude of humiliation felt had he <b>humiliated him in the marketplace.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara clarifies the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master says:</b> If one <b>humiliated</b> another who was <b>naked,</b> the one who humiliated him is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is a naked person subject to humiliation?</b> Is it possible to humiliate him in this state? <b>Rav Pappa said: What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it says: <b>Naked?</b> It means a case <b>where a gust</b> of wind <b>came and lifted his clothes, and</b> then this one <b>came and raised them higher and humiliated him.</b>

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> also teaches: If one <b>humiliated</b> another <b>in a bathhouse,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> one in <b>a bathhouse subject to humiliation?</b> In a place where people stand naked, can a person be humiliated by having his clothes removed? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This is a case <b>where he humiliated him</b> not in an actual bathhouse, but <b>on the bank of the river,</b> which is a place where people behave more discreetly when they undress.

### Part 6
§ <b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>humiliated</b> another who was <b>asleep, and</b> he <b>died</b> before he awoke, so he never knew of his humiliation, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara asks: <b>What is his dilemma? Rav Zevid said</b> that <b>this is his dilemma:</b> Is the compensation for humiliation <b>due to embarrassment,</b> i.e., that his feelings suffer because of what he experienced, <b>and this</b> one <b>died and does not have</b> that feeling of <b>embarrassment? Or perhaps</b> the compensation for humiliation <b>is due to disgrace,</b> i.e., lessening of his honor in front of other people, <b>and</b> he <b>disgraced him.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir says: A deaf-mute and a minor have</b> the right to receive compensation for <b>humiliation; an imbecile does not have</b> the right to receive compensation for <b>humiliation.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the compensation is <b>due to disgrace, this</b> explanation <b>is</b> consistent with <b>that which</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> concerning <b>a minor,</b> who can be disgraced; <b>but if you say</b> that the compensation is <b>due to embarrassment, is a minor subject to humiliation?</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Rather, what</b> do you mean by stating that the compensation is <b>due to disgrace?</b> If compensation is granted due to disgrace, then <b>an imbecile</b> should receive compensation <b>as well.</b> The Sages <b>say</b> in response: With regard to <b>an imbecile, you</b> can <b>have no greater humiliation than this.</b> It is impossible to degrade him further.

### Part 9
The Gemara returns to the original suggestion: <b>In any case, resolve from this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>that</b> the compensation <b>is due to disgrace, as, if</b> it is <b>due to embarrassment, is a minor subject to embarrassment?</b> The Gemara rejects this proof: This is <b>as Rav Pappa said</b> with regard to a different <i>halakha</i>, cited later by the Gemara: The case involves a minor <b>who</b> has reached an age in which when <b>others humiliate him he feels humiliation; here, too,</b> say that this <i>baraita</i> discusses a case involving a minor <b>who</b> has reached an age in which when <b>others humiliate him he feels humiliation.</b> This is how Rav Zevid understands the dilemma of Rabbi Abba bar Memel.

### Part 10
Rav Pappa explains Rabbi Abba bar Memel’s dilemma differently: <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>this is his dilemma:</b> Is the compensation for humiliation <b>due to his own embarrassment, and</b> this one <b>died</b> and was not embarrassed? <b>Or perhaps</b> the compensation for humiliation is <b>due to</b> his <b>family’s humiliation,</b> and therefore the one who humiliated him must pay compensation to his family?

### Part 11
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from the same <i>baraita</i>: <b>A deaf-mute and a minor have</b> the right to receive compensation for <b>humiliation; an imbecile does not have</b> the right to receive compensation for <b>humiliation.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the compensation is <b>due to</b> his <b>family’s humiliation, this</b> explanation <b>is</b> consistent with <b>that which</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> concerning <b>a minor,</b> whose family can experience humiliation based on what was done to their relative; <b>but if you say</b> that the compensation is <b>due to his own embarrassment, is a minor subject to humiliation?</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Rather, what</b> do you mean by stating that the compensation is <b>due to the humiliation of members of</b> his <b>family?</b> If this is the case, <b>an imbecile</b> should receive compensation <b>as well.</b> The Sages say in response: If one is <b>an imbecile, you</b> can <b>have no greater humiliation than this.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara returns to the original suggestion: <b>In any case, resolve from this that</b> the compensation is <b>due to</b> his <b>family’s humiliation, as, if</b> it is <b>due to embarrassment, is a minor subject to embarrassment? Rav Pappa said: Yes,</b> he is subject to embarrassment, as the <i>baraita</i> discusses a case involving a minor <b>who</b> has reached an age in which when <b>others humiliate him he feels humiliation.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> this distinction <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, as <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: A deaf-mute has</b> the right to receive compensation for <b>humiliation; an imbecile does not have</b> the right to receive compensation for <b>humiliation.</b> With regard to <b>a minor, sometimes he has</b> the right to receive compensation for humiliation, and <b>sometimes he does not have</b> the right. Why is this so? <b>This</b> case where he has the right to receive compensation for humiliation is one involving a minor <b>who</b> has reached the stage in which <b>when others humiliate him he feels humiliation; that</b> case where he does not have the right to receive compensation for humiliation is one involving a minor <b>who</b> has <b>not</b> reached the stage in which <b>when others humiliate him he feels humiliation.</b>

### Part 15
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One who humiliates a blind person</b> is liable to pay compensation. The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A blind person</b> who humiliated another <b>does not have</b> liability for <b>humiliation. And</b> in <b>this way Rabbi Yehuda deemed</b> a blind person <b>exempt from</b> being among <b>those liable to be exiled</b> for killing unintentionally, <b>and from</b> being among <b>those liable</b> to receive <b>lashes, and from</b> being among <b>those liable</b> to receive <b>court</b>-imposed <b>capital punishment,</b> if he transgresses a prohibition for which the Torah mandates one of these punishments.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> He <b>derives</b> a verbal analogy to: <b>“Your eye</b> shall not pity” (Deuteronomy 25:12), stated with regard to humiliation, <b>from: “Your eye</b> shall not pity” (Deuteronomy 19:21), stated with regard to <b>conspiring witnesses.</b> The analogy teaches that <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of conspiring witnesses, <b>blind people</b> are <b>not</b> included, as blind people cannot see events occur in order to testify, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of compensation for humiliation, <b>blind people</b> are <b>not</b> included.

### Part 17
The Gemara continues its explanation: Why did Rabbi Yehuda deem a blind person exempt <b>from</b> being among <b>those liable to be exiled</b> for killing unintentionally? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states with regard to an unintentional killing: “Or with any stone, whereby one may die, <b>seeing him not”</b> (Numbers 35:23),this formulation serves to <b>exclude a blind person;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says:</b> The verse serves <b>to include a blind person.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara explains the dispute: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> He would <b>say to you:</b> The verse states with regard to an unintentional killing, without any further limiting clause: <b>“As when one goes into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:5), <b>and</b> this includes <b>even a blind person;</b> therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote</b> in the Torah: <b>“Seeing him not”</b> (Numbers 35:23), <b>to exclude</b> a blind person.

### Part 19
<b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>Rabbi Meir? The Merciful One wrote</b> in the Torah: <b>“Seeing him not”</b> (Numbers 35:23), apparently <b>to exclude</b> one who happened to not see the one he killed; <b>and the Merciful One wrote</b> in the Torah: “Who kills his neighbor <b>unawares”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:4), apparently <b>to exclude</b> a blind person, who is not aware of where others are standing. <b>This is a restriction following a restriction, and</b> there is a hermeneutical principle that <b>a restriction following a restriction</b> serves <b>only to amplify</b> the <i>halakha</i> and include additional cases. Therefore, a blind person is included in the <i>halakha</i> of those liable to be exiled for unintentional killing.

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what would <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> respond to this reasoning? The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> verse: “Who kills his neighbor <b>unawares,”</b> does not exclude one who could not see, but rather, <b>it comes to exclude</b> one who was <b>intending</b> to kill a particular person and unintentionally killed someone else. That killer is not exiled.

### Part 21
The Gemara continues to explain the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. Why did he deem a blind person exempt from being among <b>those liable</b> to receive <b>court</b>-imposed <b>capital punishment?</b> That <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy to: “But if he smote him with an instrument of iron so that he died, he is <b>a killer;</b> the killer shall be put to death” (Numbers 36:15), written with regard to capital punishment, <b>from:</b> “You shall appoint for yourselves cities, to be cities of refuge for you, that <b>a killer</b> who killed any person unintentionally may flee there” (Numbers 35:11), written with regard to <b>those liable to be exiled.</b>

### Part 22
Why did Rabbi Yehuda deem a blind person exempt from being among <b>those liable</b> to receive <b>lashes?</b> That <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy to: “Then it shall be, if the <b>guilty</b> one deserves to be beaten” (Deuteronomy 25:2), written with regard to lashes, <b>from:</b> “Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, that is <b>guilty</b> of death” (Numbers 35:31), written with regard to <b>those liable</b> to receive <b>court</b>-imposed <b>capital punishment.</b>

### Part 23
The Gemara presents another statement of Rabbi Yehuda: It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A blind person does not have humiliation,</b>
