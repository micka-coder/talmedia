### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <b>four primary categories of damage: The</b> category of <b>Ox; and the</b> category of <b>Pit; and the</b> category of <b><i>Maveh</i>,</b> which, based on a discussion in the Gemara refers either to the tooth of an animal that causes damage or to a person who causes damage; <b>and the</b> category of <b>Fire.</b>

### Part 2
Each of these categories is unique; therefore, the <i>halakhot</i> of one cannot be derived from another. The defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Ox is not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b><i>Maveh</i>, and</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b><i>Maveh</i> is not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Ox. And</b> the defining characteristics of <b>this</b> category of Ox <b>and that</b> category of <i>Maveh</i>, <b>in which there is a living spirit</b> that causes damage, <b>are not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> category of <b>Fire, in which there is no living spirit.</b>

### Part 3
The mishna continues: <b>And</b> the defining characteristics of <b>this</b> primary category of Ox and <i>Maveh</i> <b>and that</b> primary category of Fire, <b>in which</b> the <b>typical manner</b> of their components is <b>to proceed</b> from one place to another <b>and</b> cause <b>damage, are not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Pit, in which</b> the <b>typical manner</b> of its components is <b>not to proceed</b> from one place to another <b>and</b> cause <b>damage;</b> rather, it remains in place and the damage is caused by the injured party proceeding and encountering the obstacle.

### Part 4
<b>The common denominator of</b> the components in all of <b>these</b> primary categories is <b>that</b> it is <b>their typical manner to cause damage, and</b> the responsibility for <b>their safeguarding</b> to prevent them from causing damage is incumbent <b>upon you,</b> the owner of the animal or generator of the fire or the pit. <b>And when</b> a component of any of these categories <b>causes damage, the</b> owner or generator of the component that <b>caused</b> the <b>damage is obligated to pay</b> restitution <b>for damage with best</b>-quality <b>land.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> its ruling employing the term: <b>Primary categories, by inference, there are subcategories</b> of those primary categories. The Gemara asks: Are <b>their subcategories similar to them,</b> i.e., to their respective primary categories, so that the same <i>halakhot</i> apply to them, <b>or</b> are they <b>dissimilar to them?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara cites additional areas of <i>halakha</i> where there are primary categories and subcategories and considers the relationship between them: <b>With regard to Shabbat we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 73a): <b>The primary categories of labor</b> prohibited on Shabbat number <b>forty-less-one.</b> There too, from the fact that the mishna teaches its ruling employing the term: <b>Primary categories, by inference, there are</b> also <b>subcategories.</b>

### Part 7
With regard to the primary categories of labor prohibited on Shabbat, <b>their subcategories are similar to them,</b> as <b>it is no different</b> if one unwittingly performed labor that is <b>a primary category,</b> for which he is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, and it is no different</b> if one unwittingly performed labor that is <b>a subcategory,</b> for which he is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> Likewise, <b>it is no different</b> if one intentionally performed labor that is <b>a primary category,</b> for which he is liable to be executed by <b>stoning, and it is no different</b> if one intentionally performed labor that is <b>a subcategory,</b> for which he is liable to be executed by <b>stoning.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And what</b> difference <b>is there between a primary category and a subcategory?</b> The Gemara explains: The practical <b>difference</b> is <b>that if one</b> unwittingly <b>performs two</b> labors classified as different <b>primary categories together,</b> during a single lapse of awareness, or, <b>alternatively,</b> if one unwittingly performs <b>two</b> labors classified as <b>subcategories</b> of two different primary categories <b>together,</b> during a single lapse of awareness, <b>one is liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for each and every</b> labor that he performed. Each primary category of labor is an independent transgression. <b>While if one</b> unwittingly <b>performs</b> a labor that is <b>a primary category and</b> another labor classified as <b>its subcategory</b> during a single lapse of awareness, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin-offering.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Eliezer, who deems one liable</b> to bring two sin-offerings even if one performs a labor classified as <b>a subcategory together with</b> a labor that is <b>its primary category, why is</b> one labor <b>characterized</b> as <b>a primary category and why is</b> the other labor <b>characterized</b> as <b>a subcategory?</b> The Gemara explains: Of the labors prohibited on Shabbat, <b>that which was a significant</b> labor <b>in the Tabernacle,</b> the Sages <b>characterized</b> it as <b>a primary category,</b> and <b>that which was not a significant labor in the Tabernacle,</b> the Sages <b>characterized</b> it as <b>a subcategory.</b> The labors prohibited on Shabbat are derived from the labors employed in the construction of the Tabernacle; therefore, their classification is also based on their significance in its construction.

### Part 10
<b>With regard to ritual impurities, we learned</b> in the mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 1:1): <b>The primary categories of ritual impurity</b> are as follows: Any of the eight species of <b>the creeping animal</b> enumerated in the Torah (Leviticus 11:29â€“30), <b>and semen,</b>
