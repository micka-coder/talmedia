### Part 1
<b>and one who is impure</b> with impurity imparted by a human <b>corpse.</b> A person, a vessel, or food that is rendered impure through contact with an item classified as a primary category of ritual impurity is characterized as a subcategory. In that domain, <b>their subcategories are dissimilar to them, as</b> any person or item classified as <b>a primary category</b> of ritual impurity <b>impurifies a person and</b> impurifies any <b>vessels</b> with which it comes into contact, <b>while</b> a person or item classified as <b>a subcategory of ritual impurity impurifies food or drink, but does not impurify a person or vessels.</b>

### Part 2
After determining that there are instances where the legal status of subcategories is like that of primary categories, e.g., Shabbat, and there are instances where the legal status of subcategories is dissimilar to that of primary categories, e.g., ritual impurity, the Gemara asks: <b>Here,</b> with regard to the laws of damages, <b>what</b> is the relationship between the primary categories and their subcategories? <b>Rav Pappa said: There are, among</b> the primary categories of damage, some whose subcategories <b>are similar to them, and there are, among them,</b> some whose subcategories <b>are dissimilar to them.</b>

### Part 3
§ Seeking to clarify Rav Pappa’s statement, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that delineates the primary categories of damage. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Three primary categories</b> of damage <b>were stated</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to an ox.</b> An ox causes damage in three ways, and each is classified as a distinct primary category of damage represented by a part of the body of the ox: There is <b>the</b> category of <b>Goring [<i>keren</i>],</b> literally, horn. This is referring to an ox goring a person or an animal and causing damage. <b>And</b> there is <b>the</b> category of <b>Eating [<i>shen</i>],</b> literally, tooth. This is referring to one’s ox causing damage by consuming another person’s produce. <b>And</b> there is <b>the</b> category of <b>Trampling [<i>regel</i>],</b> literally, foot. This is referring to an ox trampling another person’s belongings and causing damage. These are classified as primary categories because they are mentioned explicitly in the Torah.

### Part 4
The Gemara elaborates: <b>From where do we</b> derive the primary category of <b>Goring?</b> The source is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And <b>if</b> an ox <b>gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28); and <b>goring is</b> performed <b>only</b> with <b>a horn, as it is stated: “And Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, made himself horns of iron, and said: So says the Lord: With these shall you gore the Arameans,</b> until they are consumed” (I Kings 22:11). <b>And</b> the verse also <b>states: “His firstborn bull, majesty is his, and his horns are the horns of the wild ox; with them he shall gore the nations”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17).

### Part 5
The Gemara interrupts its citation of the <i>baraita</i> and asks: <b>What</b> is the purpose of citing the additional verse introduced with the term: <b>And</b> the verse also <b>states?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>And if you would say</b> that the first verse cited is not a legitimate source as it is a verse from the Prophets, and <b>we do not derive Torah matters from the texts of the tradition,</b> i.e., Prophets and Writings, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the Torah: <b>“His firstborn bull, majesty is his.”</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects the possibility that the reason a second verse was cited is that the primary category of Goring cannot be derived from a verse in the Prophets: <b>But is this</b> a halakhic <b>derivation? It is a mere disclosure of the matter, that goring is</b> performed <b>with a horn.</b> A verse in the Prophets can certainly serve as a source for that disclosure.

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> the reason the <i>baraita</i> cites a second verse is <b>lest you say,</b> based on the first verse, that <b>when the Merciful One distinguishes between</b> liability for damage caused by <b>an innocuous</b> ox, for which the owner is liable to pay half of the damages for the first three times that it gores, <b>and</b> liability for damage caused by <b>a forewarned</b> ox, which already gored three times and whose owner was cautioned to prevent the ox from goring, for which he is liable to pay the full damages, <b>that statement</b> applies only to damage caused <b>with a detached</b> horn, like the horn of Zedekiah described in the verse, e.g., if an animal held a detached horn in its mouth and caused damage with it; <b>but</b> for damage that an ox caused <b>with</b> a horn <b>attached</b> to its head, <b>say</b> that in <b>all</b> cases the legal status of the ox <b>is</b> that of <b>a forewarned</b> ox and its owner is liable to pay for all of the damage.

### Part 8
Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> says: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from another verse: <b>“His firstborn bull, majesty is his,</b> and his horns are the horns of the wild ox; with them he shall gore the nations,” where the reference is to a horn attached to the ox’s head. Evidently, when an ox gores with its own horns there is a distinction between an innocuous ox and a forewarned ox.

### Part 9
The Gemara resumes its citation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is a subcategory of Goring?</b> It includes any action that an ox performs with its body with the objective of inflicting damage: <b>Pushing [<i>negifa</i>], biting, crouching</b> upon items with the objective of inflicting damage, <b>and kicking.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>goring that it is characterized</b> as <b>a primary category</b> of damage, <b>as it is written</b> explicitly in the verse: “And <b>if</b> an ox <b>gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28); accordingly, <b><i>negifa</i></b> should <b>also</b> be characterized as a primary category, <b>as it is written: “If</b> one man’s ox <b>hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ]</b> the ox of another” (Exodus 21:35)? The Gemara answers: <b>This <i>negifa</i></b> mentioned in the verse, <b>is</b> actually a reference to <b>goring, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verses states: “And if one man’s ox hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ] the ox of another…or if it is known that the ox was a goring ox in time past” (Exodus 21:35–36). The verse <b>began</b> its description of the case <b>with</b> the term <b><i>negifa</i> and</b> it <b>concluded with</b> the term <b>goring to say to you</b> that in this context the two terms describe the same action: <b>This</b> action <b>is <i>negifa</i></b> and <b>this</b> same action <b>is goring.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: If the two terms are interchangeable, <b>what is different with regard to</b> an ox goring <b>a person that it is written:</b> “And <b>if</b> an ox <b>gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28), <b>and what is different with regard to</b> an ox goring <b>an animal that it is written: “If</b> one man’s ox <b>hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ]</b> the ox of another” (Exodus 21:35)?

### Part 12
The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>a person, who has</b> the <b>ingenuity</b> to defend himself and is not easily injured, <b>it is written: “If</b> an ox <b>gores,”</b> a term indicating an attack of greater force. With regard to <b>an animal, which does not have</b> the <b>ingenuity</b> to defend itself and is more easily injured, <b>it is written: “If</b> an ox <b>hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ],”</b> a term indicating an attack of lesser force. The term <i>yiggof</i> is related to the term <i>magefa</i>, meaning plague. The Torah employs that term with regard to the goring of an animal to indicate that when an animal is gored, regardless of the force of the blow, it will likely result in its death.

### Part 13
<b>And</b> the Torah’s use of these terms <b>teaches us a matter in passing:</b> Because the effort required for the ox to gore a person to death is greater than the effort required for the ox to gore an animal to death, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> an ox that is <b>forewarned with regard to</b> goring <b>a person is</b> also <b>forewarned with regard to an animal. But</b> an ox that is <b>forewarned with regard to an animal is not forewarned with regard to a person.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara questions the classification in the <i>baraita</i> of biting, crouching, and kicking as subcategories of Goring: Isn’t <b>biting a subcategory of Eating,</b> as the animal both eats and bites with its teeth? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> in cases included in the primary category of <b>Eating, there is pleasure</b> for the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>its</b> causing <b>damage.</b> In <b>this</b> case of damage caused by biting, <b>there is no</b> intrinsic <b>pleasure</b> for the animal <b>in</b> the course of the <b>damage</b> that <b>it</b> causes, as when the ox bites forcefully, the exclusive objective of the action is to cause damage.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: Aren’t <b>crouching</b> upon items <b>and kicking</b> items in order to damage them each <b>a subcategory of Trampling,</b> as the animal crouches by bending its legs and kicks with its feet? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> in cases included in the primary category of Trampling, the <b>damage is commonplace,</b> as it is caused in the course of the animal’s walking; in <b>these</b> cases of crouching and kicking, the <b>damage is not commonplace,</b> as animals do not typically kick or crouch upon utensils.

### Part 16
After citing the subcategories listed in the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara resumes its analysis of the statement of Rav Pappa: <b>But</b> with regard to the statement <b>that Rav Pappa said: There are among them</b> some whose subcategories <b>are dissimilar to them, to which</b> primary category was Rav Pappa referring?

### Part 17
<b>If we say</b> that his reference was <b>to these</b> subcategories of Goring, <b>what is different</b> about <b>Goring</b> that defines it as a unique primary category? What is different is <b>that</b> the <b>objective</b> of the ox’s action <b>is to cause damage, and</b> the ox is <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>its safeguarding,</b> to prevent it from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you,</b> its owner. In <b>these</b> subcategories of Goring, i.e., pushing [<i>negifa</i>], biting, crouching, and kicking, <b>as well,</b> the <b>objective</b> of the oxen’s actions <b>is to cause damage, and</b> the oxen are <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>their safeguarding,</b> to prevent your oxen from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Rather,</b> it is apparent that the status of <b>a subcategory of Goring is like</b> that of the primary category of <b>Goring, and when Rav Pappa says:</b> There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them, he was referring <b>to Eating and Trampling.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>Where are Eating and Trampling written</b> in the Torah that led them to be classified as primary categories? The Gemara answers: The source is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and he sends forth his animal, and it consumed in the field of another” (Exodus 22:4). The two parts of the verse are referring to different categories: <b>“And he sends forth,” this is</b> a reference to <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Trampling,</b> as sending forth results in the animal trampling another’s produce and damaging it, <b>and likewise it states:</b> “Happy are you that sow beside all waters <b>that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20). Clearly the term “send forth” is a reference to trampling by the feet of the animal.

### Part 20
<b>“And it consumed,” this is</b> a reference to <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Eating, and likewise it states:</b> “And I will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, <b>as one consumes with</b>
