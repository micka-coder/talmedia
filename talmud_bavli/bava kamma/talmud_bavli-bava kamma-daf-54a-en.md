### Part 1
The word <b>“or”</b> is <b>necessary to separate</b> the cases of the ox and donkey. This indicates that if either falls in individually, the owner of the pit is liable. <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>to separate</b> the cases in the verse? He derives it <b>from</b> the use of the singular form of the verb: <b>“And</b> an ox or donkey <b>fall [<i>venafal</i>],”</b> indicating that he is liable if even one animal falls. <b>And the Rabbis</b> maintain that the term <b>and fall</b> can also <b>indicate many</b> animals, as the use of the singular form of a verb does not prove that the subject is necessarily singular.

### Part 2
The Gemara now challenges both opinions: <b>Say</b> that the term <b>“and fall”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> whereas the phrase <b>“an ox or a donkey”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> According to the principles of halakhic exegesis, when the Torah presents <b>a generalization and a detail, the generalization</b> includes <b>only what</b> is contained <b>in the detail.</b> Therefore, <b>an ox and a donkey</b> are <b>indeed</b> included, but <b>anything else</b> is <b>not</b> included.

### Part 3
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: The following verse: <b>“The owner of the pit shall pay”</b> (Exodus 21:34), means that <b>it then generalized</b> again. The verses are structured according to the principle of halakhic exegesis of: <b>A generalization, and a detail, and a generalization.</b> According to this principle, <b>you may deduce</b> that the verses are referring <b>only</b> to items that are <b>similar to the detail.</b> In this case, <b>just as the explicit detail</b> is referring to <b>animals, so too, all</b> items included in the generalization must be <b>animals.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara now challenges this answer: <b>If</b> so, <b>just as the explicit detail,</b> i.e., the ox and donkey, is referring to <b>items whose carcass renders</b> a person ritually <b>impure by contact or by carrying, so too, all items,</b> i.e., all animals, <b>whose carcass renders</b> a person ritually <b>impure through contact or by carrying,</b> should be included in the <i>halakhot</i> of damage classified as Pit. <b>But birds,</b> whose carcasses do not render a person impure through contact or by carrying, would <b>not</b> be included.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let the Merciful One write</b> only <b>one detail,</b> from which the exclusion of birds could be derived. The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> detail <b>should</b> the Torah <b>write? If</b> it <b>writes</b> only <b>an ox, I would say</b> that an item that <b>is sacrificed on the altar,</b> such as an ox, <b>indeed</b> renders the owner of the pit liable, whereas an item <b>that is not sacrificed on the altar</b> does <b>not</b> render him liable. <b>And if the Merciful One writes</b> only <b>a donkey, I would say:</b> Those animals whose <b>firstborn</b> is <b>sanctified,</b> such as a donkey, as described in the Torah (Exodus 13:13), do <b>indeed</b> render their owners liable, but animals whose <b>firstborn</b> is <b>not sanctified</b> do <b>not</b> render them liable. Therefore, the Torah states both an ox and a donkey.

### Part 6
The original difficulty therefore resurfaces: Why is the verse not expounded as a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, thereby excluding birds? <b>Rather,</b> the previous method of deriving liability for a pit must be rejected, and instead it should be derived as follows: The <b>verse states: “And the carcass shall be for him”</b> (Exodus 21:34), from which it may be inferred that <b>anything subject to death</b> is included.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: If this is the basis for liability for a pit, then <b>both according to the Rabbis, who exclude vessels</b> from liability based on another verse, <b>and according to Rabbi Yehuda, who has amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include <b>vessels,</b> one could ask: <b>Are vessels subject to death?</b> Clearly, vessels cannot be subject to death. Why, then, is a separate source necessary to derive their halakhic status? The Sages <b>said</b> in reply: Vessels may also be considered subject to death in the sense that <b>their shattering is</b> tantamount to <b>their death.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara continues to challenge this explanation: <b>But according to Rav, who says:</b> With regard to <b>Pit, for which the Torah deems</b> a person <b>liable,</b> it is only <b>for</b> damage caused by <b>its</b> lethal <b>fumes, but not for</b> damage caused by <b>the impact</b> of the fall, the following question may be raised <b>both according to the Rabbis and according to Rabbi Yehuda: Are vessels capable</b> of being broken by the lethal <b>fumes,</b> such that a verse is necessary to exclude them? The Sages <b>said</b> in reply: There is such a case concerning <b>new</b> vessels, <b>which crack from the fumes.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks further: But isn’t <b>this</b> verse: <b>“And the carcass shall be for him,” necessary for that which Rava</b> ruled, <b>as Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a disqualified consecrated ox that fell into a pit,</b> the owner of the pit is <b>exempt, as it is stated: “And the carcass shall be for him.”</b> It is referring <b>to</b> a person to <b>whom</b> the <b>carcass belongs,</b> thereby <b>excluding this</b> person, to <b>whom</b> the <b>carcass</b> does <b>not belong.</b> Once a <i>halakha</i> has already been derived from this verse, it cannot be used as the basis for deriving a second <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 10
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of liability for Pit must be derived from another source. The <b>verse states</b> concerning Pit: <b>“He shall recompense money to its owners”</b> (Exodus 21:34), thereby <b>including any</b> item <b>that has an owner</b> within the scope of liability. The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even vessels and people</b> should be included <b>as well,</b> which presents a difficulty for all opinions.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: This is why <b>the verse states: “An ox,” but not a person; “a donkey,” but not vessels.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Yehuda, who amplifies</b> the scope of liability to include <b>vessels, granted</b> that the term <b>“an ox”</b> is necessary, as he <b>excludes people based on it,</b> for which he is not liable. <b>But</b> with regard to the term <b>“a donkey,” what</b> does he <b>exclude based on it?</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The term <b>“donkey”</b> stated <b>with regard to Pit, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> the term <b>“sheep”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:1), stated <b>with regard to a lost</b> item, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>everyone</b> (see <i>Bava Metzia</i> 27a) are <b>difficult.</b> There is no explanation for why they are stated.

### Part 13
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>a <i>ḥeresh</i> ox</b> or <b>a <i>shoteh</i></b> ox <b>or a <i>katan</i></b> ox <b>fell into</b> the pit, the owner of the pit is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> is meant by the phrase: <b>A <i>ḥeresh</i> ox</b> or <b>a <i>shoteh</i></b> ox <b>or a <i>katan</i></b> ox? <b>If we say</b> that it means: <b>An ox belonging to a deaf-mute [<i>ḥeresh</i>], an ox belonging to an imbecile [<i>shoteh</i>],</b> or <b>an ox belonging to a minor [<i>katan</i>],</b> then it can be inferred that if it was <b>an ox</b> belonging to a halakhically <b>competent</b> adult, the owner of the pit would be <b>exempt.</b> What would be the reason for this exemption?

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Instead, it should be interpreted as: <b>An ox that is</b> impaired by being <b>deaf,</b> or <b>an ox that is an imbecile,</b> or <b>an ox that is</b> very <b>young.</b>
