### Part 1
the owner of the wheat field may <b>tell</b> the owner of the vineyard to <b>repair</b> the breach before the vines intermingle with the grain and cause it to become forbidden. If the partition <b>broke open</b> again, he may again <b>tell him</b> to <b>repair</b> it. If the owner of the vineyard <b>abandoned</b> the partition <b>and did not repair it, he has rendered</b> the grain <b>forbidden, and is obligated</b> to pay <b>restitution</b> for <b>it.</b> This demonstrates that one is liable to pay damages even if he did not perform any action at all, and consequently proves that Rabbi Meir rules there is liability for damage caused by indirect action.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who gives wool to a dyer and it was burned in the cauldron</b> during the dyeing process, thereby completely ruining the wool so that there is no enhancement, only loss, the dyer <b>gives</b> the owner <b>the value of his wool.</b> If he <b>dyed it unattractively [<i>ka’ur</i>]</b> so that the dye is not absorbed well by the wool, <b>if the enhancement,</b> i.e., the amount that the value of the wool has increased by being dyed, <b>exceeds the</b> dyer’s <b>expenses,</b> the owner of the wool <b>gives</b> the dyer <b>the expenses. And if the expenses exceed the enhancement, he gives him</b> the value of <b>the enhancement.</b>

### Part 3
If the owner gave wool to a dyer <b>to dye</b> it <b>red for him and</b> instead <b>he dyed it black,</b> or to dye it <b>black and he dyed it red, Rabbi Meir says:</b> The dyer <b>gives</b> the owner of the wool <b>the value of his wool. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Here too, <b>if</b> the value of <b>the enhancement exceeds the</b> dyer’s <b>expenses,</b> the owner of the wool <b>gives</b> the dyer <b>the expenses. And if the expenses exceed the enhancement, he gives him</b> the value of <b>the enhancement.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> does the mishna mean by <b>unattractively? Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: <i>Kelabus</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does <b><i>kelabus</i></b> mean? <b>Rabba bar Shmuel said:</b>
