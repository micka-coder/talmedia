### Part 1
<b>But if the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam stopped,</b> causing the barrel to collide with the beam and break, the former is <b>liable,</b> since the latter had no way of anticipating that he would stop. <b>And if he said to the owner of the barrel: Stop,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from liability for breaking the barrel.

### Part 2
Conversely, if <b>the owner of the barrel was</b> walking <b>first and the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam last,</b> and <b>the barrel was broken by the</b> cross <b>beam,</b> the owner of the cross beam is <b>liable. But if owner of the barrel stopped,</b> the owner of the cross beam is <b>exempt</b> from liability for breaking the barrel. <b>And if he said to the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam: Stop,</b> the owner of the cross beam is <b>liable. And similarly,</b> these <i>halakhot</i> apply in a case where <b>this one came with his lamp and that one came with his flax,</b> and the lamp set fire to the flax.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabba bar Natan asked Rav Huna:</b> With regard to <b>one who causes injury to his wife during sexual intercourse, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he liable to pay damages? Is it reasoned that <b>since he is acting in a permitted manner</b> he is <b>exempt, or perhaps he should pay attention</b> and be more careful?

### Part 4
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabba bar Natan: <b>You learned this</b> <i>halakha</i> in the mishna concerning one person walking with a cross beam and another with a barrel, which rules that the owner of the cross beam is exempt <b>because this one had permission to walk and that one</b> also <b>had permission to walk.</b> Similarly, since the husband has permission to engage in intercourse with his wife, if he injures her in the process he is exempt.

### Part 5
<b>Rava</b> disagreed with Rav Huna’s opinion and <b>said:</b> The husband is liable due to an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference from the <i>halakha</i> with regard to manslaughter, as it is stated in the Torah: “As when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood…and the head slips off the helve, and finds his neighbor, and he dies; he shall flee to one of these cities and live” (Deuteronomy 19:5). <b>And just as</b> in the <b>forest, where this</b> person <b>entered his domain and that</b> person <b>entered his domain,</b> as it is the domain of the public, and nevertheless the one who kills unintentionally is <b>considered like one who entered another’s domain and</b> is therefore <b>liable</b> to be exiled to a city of refuge, then with regard to <b>this</b> husband, <b>who</b> actually <b>enters another’s domain, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that he should be liable for the injury he causes her?

### Part 6
The Gemara raises an objection to Rava’s opinion: <b>But</b> what of <b>this</b> mishna, <b>which teaches</b> that the owner of the cross beam is exempt, as <b>this one had permission to walk and that one had permission to walk,</b> and Rav Huna inferred from here that the husband is likewise exempt.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: The two cases are different. <b>There,</b> in the case in the mishna, <b>both</b> sides <b>were similarly</b> walking, and the one who caused the damage is therefore exempt due to his right to walk there. By contrast, <b>here,</b> the husband is the only active participant in the intercourse. Therefore, since <b>he is</b> the one <b>performing an action,</b> he is liable even though he is acting with permission.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And is she not</b> considered an active participant? <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to forbidden sexual intercourse: <b>“Even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people”</b> (Leviticus 18:29), indicating that both the man and woman are considered to be performing an action?

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: The verse is referring to the fact that <b>they both have pleasure</b> from the act. The woman’s pleasure is tantamount to active transgression, and she is therefore punished if she participates willfully. But with regard to a wife’s injury, <b>he is</b> the one who is considered to be <b>performing an action,</b> and he is therefore liable.

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches: In a case where <b>the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam was</b> walking <b>first</b> and the owner of the barrel was walking behind him, if the barrel was broken by the cross beam, the owner of the cross beam is exempt. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> If <b>two cows</b> were <b>in the public domain, one</b> of them <b>prone and one walking,</b> and the cow that was <b>walking kicked the</b> cow that was <b>prone,</b> its owner is <b>exempt.</b> If the <b>prone</b> cow <b>kicked</b> the cow that was <b>walking,</b> its owner is <b>liable</b> to pay.

### Part 11
<b>Let us say that</b> the mishna <b>supports</b> this statement, as it states: If <b>the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam was first and the owner of the barrel was last,</b> and <b>the barrel was broken by the</b> cross <b>beam, he is exempt. But if the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam stopped,</b> the owner of the cross beam is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara explains the proof: <b>But here,</b> it is clear <b>that</b> it is <b>like</b> a case where the <b>prone</b> cow kicked the cow that was <b>walking,</b> since the one carrying the barrel was walking and the one carrying the cross beam stopped in the public domain, causing damage to the former. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in this case that the owner of the cross beam <b>is liable.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara responds: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> that reasoning? <b>You wanted to support</b> the statement of Reish Lakish from the mishna. <b>Not only does it not support</b> Reish Lakish; <b>it even raises a difficulty</b> to his opinion. <b>The reason</b> Reish Lakish stated that the owner of the prone cow is liable is <b>that it kicked</b> the walking cow; <b>but</b> if the walking cow <b>was damaged</b> because <b>by itself</b> it collided with the prone cow, he would be <b>exempt. But the mishna</b> discusses a case <b>where</b> the one carrying the barrel ran into the cross beam <b>by himself,</b> without the one carrying the cross beam actively hitting it, <b>and it teaches</b> that the owner of the cross beam is nevertheless <b>liable.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara explains: <b>The mishna</b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the cross beam <b>blocked the</b> entire width of the <b>road like a carcass.</b> Since the one carrying the barrel could not avoid it, the one carrying the cross beam is liable although he did not actively break the barrel. By contrast, <b>here,</b> Reish Lakish’s statement is referring to a case <b>where</b> the cow <b>was lying down on one side</b> of the public domain, and the other cow <b>should have walked on the other,</b> unobstructed <b>side.</b> Therefore, if the damage is caused only as a result of their collision, the owner of the prone cow is exempt.

### Part 14
The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>the latter clause of the mishna</b> that <b>supports Reish Lakish’s</b> statement, <b>as it teaches:</b> Conversely, <b>if the owner of the barrel was</b> walking <b>first and the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam last,</b> and <b>the barrel was broken by the</b> cross <b>beam,</b> the owner of the cross beam is <b>liable. But if the owner of the barrel stopped,</b> the owner of the cross beam is <b>exempt</b> from liability for breaking the barrel. <b>But here,</b> it is clear <b>that</b> it is <b>like</b> a case where <b>the walking</b> cow kicked <b>the prone</b> cow. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>teaches that</b> the owner of the cross beam is <b>exempt,</b> lending support to Reish Lakish’s ruling.

### Part 15
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>The mishna</b> exempts the one carrying the cross beam <b>because he was walking in his normal manner</b> when he hit the barrel. <b>Here,</b> perhaps the owner of the prone cow <b>can say to</b> the owner of the walking cow: <b>Although you have permission to walk over me,</b> i.e., for your cow to walk over my cow, <b>you have no permission to kick me,</b> i.e., for your cow to kick my cow.

### Part 16
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>two</b> people <b>who were walking in the public domain,</b> or <b>one</b> who was <b>running and</b> another <b>one</b> who was <b>walking, or who were both running, and they damaged one another, both of them are exempt.</b>

### Part 17
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Isi ben Yehuda. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Isi ben Yehuda says</b> that one who <b>runs</b> in the public domain and causes damage <b>is liable</b> to pay for any damage he causes <b>because</b> his behavior <b>is unusual</b> in the public domain. <b>And Isi concedes</b> with regard to one who runs and causes damage at <b>twilight on the eve of Shabbat that he is exempt, because he is running with permission.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Isi ben Yehuda.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that if one runs and causes damage he is liable? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say,</b> as a principle, that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with an unattributed mishna? And we learned</b> in this mishna that if <b>one was running and</b> the other <b>one was walking, or</b> if <b>they were both running, they are exempt.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara answers: <b>The mishna,</b> which exempts one who was running, is referring <b>to twilight on the eve of Shabbat,</b> when people are permitted to run in the public domain.

### Part 20
The Gemara explains: <b>From where</b> is it inferred that the mishna is referring to twilight on the eve of Shabbat? It is inferred <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it teaches: Or who were both running, they are exempt. Why do I need this</b> case <b>as well? Now</b> that the mishna teaches that if <b>one was running and</b> the other <b>one was walking,</b> the one running is <b>exempt, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that he is exempt when <b>both of them were running? Rather, this is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> If <b>one was running and</b> the other <b>one was walking,</b> he is <b>exempt. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to twilight on the eve of Shabbat,</b> when running in the public domain is permitted. <b>But on a weekday,</b> if <b>one was running and</b> the other <b>one was walking,</b> the one who was running is <b>liable.</b> If <b>both were running, even on a weekday, they are exempt.</b> This emendation explains the need to mention the case where both were running.

### Part 21
<b>The Master said</b> above: <b>And Isi concedes</b> with regard to one who runs and causes damage at <b>twilight on the eve of Shabbat that he is exempt, because he is running with permission.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the reason that running at twilight <b>on the eve of Shabbat</b> is considered to be <b>with permission?</b>

### Part 22
The Gemara answers: It is <b>like</b> that <b>which Rabbi Ḥanina</b> would say, <b>as Rabbi Ḥanina would say</b> at twilight on the eve of Shabbat:
