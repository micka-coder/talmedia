### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a spark that emerged from under the hammer</b> of a blacksmith and started a fire, <b>causing damage,</b> the blacksmith is <b>liable</b> for the damage caused.

### Part 2
In the case of <b>a camel that was laden with flax and was passing through the public domain, and its flax extended into a store and</b> the flax <b>caught fire from a lamp</b> in the store <b>belonging to the storekeeper, and</b> as a result of the burning flax the camel <b>set fire to the building</b> together with all its contents, <b>the owner of the camel</b> is <b>liable.</b> But if <b>the storekeeper placed his lamp outside,</b> thereby causing the flax on the camel to catch fire, and consequently the building was set on fire, <b>the storekeeper</b> is <b>liable. Rabbi Yehuda says: In</b> a case where the lamp placed outside was <b>a Hanukkah lamp,</b> the storekeeper is <b>exempt,</b> since it is a mitzva for a Hanukkah lamp to be placed outside.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Ravina said in the name of Rava: Conclude from Rabbi Yehuda’s</b> statement that <b>the mitzva is to place the Hanukkah lamp within</b> a height of <b>ten</b> handbreadths from the ground <b>as, if it enters your mind</b> to say that the mitzva can also be fulfilled by placing it <b>above ten handbreadths, why did Rabbi Yehuda say that</b> in the case of <b>a Hanukkah lamp</b> placed outside, the storekeeper is <b>exempt? Let</b> the owner of the camel <b>say to</b> the storekeeper: <b>You should have placed</b> the lamp <b>above the</b> height <b>of a camel and its rider</b> so that the flax would not catch fire. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> here that Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is that <b>the mitzva is to place it within ten handbreadths</b> of the ground and not higher?

### Part 4
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>No,</b> there is no proof from here. <b>Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that one may place a Hanukkah lamp <b>even above</b> a height of <b>ten</b> handbreadths, and as for <b>what you said,</b> that the owner of the camel can claim: <b>You should have placed</b> the lamp <b>above</b> the height <b>of a camel and its rider,</b> in response to this one can say: <b>Since</b> the store owner <b>is performing a mitzva</b> by placing his Hanukkah lamp outside, <b>the Sages did not trouble him to such an extent</b> to have him place his lamp at a height that would be inconvenient for him to reach.

### Part 5
Further on the subject of the height of a Hanukkah lamp, <b>Rav Kahana says</b> that <b>Rav Natan bar Minyumi taught in the name of Rabbi Tanḥum: A Hanukkah lamp that is placed higher than twenty cubits</b> from the ground is <b>unfit</b> to be used for the mitzva, since people do not generally look up to such a height, and the main purpose of the Hanukkah lamp is for it to be seen by others. In this regard, the <i>halakha</i> of the height of a Hanukkah lamp is <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the height of <b>a <i>sukka</i> and</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the height of a cross beam at the entrance to <b>an alleyway,</b> which are unfit for their respective purposes if they are higher than twenty cubits.
