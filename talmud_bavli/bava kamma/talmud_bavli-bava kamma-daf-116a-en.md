### Part 1
The wine must <b>all be poured out</b> in order to prevent a possible mishap. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> Let the wine <b>be used</b> for <b>sprinkling. Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: I will decide</b> the <i>halakha</i> by proposing an intermediate opinion: If the wine became impure <b>in a house, it may be used</b> for <b>sprinkling,</b> as it can be used immediately, <b>but</b> if it became impure <b>in the field, it must all be poured out,</b> as it is possible that by the time it is brought to the house and used for sprinkling, someone may drink it.

### Part 2
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that he decided the <i>halakha</i> as follows: <b>With regard to aged</b> wine, <b>it may be used</b> for <b>sprinkling,</b> as it is fit to be sprinkled immediately, <b>but with regard to new</b> wine, which does not yet have a pleasant aroma, <b>it must all be poured out</b> in order to prevent a possible mishap. <b>They said to</b> Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei: <b>A decision</b> by <b>a third</b> party <b>does not</b> conclusively <b>decide</b> the <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches that <b>if</b> the owner of the wine <b>said to</b> the owner of the honey: <b>I will salvage your</b> honey and you will pay me the value of my wine, the owner of the honey is obligated to give him compensation for the wine. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is the stipulation binding? <b>Let</b> the owner of the honey <b>say to him: I was</b> merely <b>fooling with you</b> when I accepted your condition, and I did not agree to it at all.

### Part 4
<b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case <b>where one was fleeing from prison and there was a ferry before him,</b> and <b>he said to</b> the ferryman: <b>Take</b> this entire <b>dinar and take me across</b> the river, the ferryman <b>has</b> the right to collect <b>only his</b> usual <b>wage,</b> but not the entire dinar. <b>Apparently,</b> the prisoner could have <b>said to him: I was</b> merely <b>fooling with you</b> and never intended to pay you a full dinar. <b>Here also, let</b> the owner of the honey <b>say to</b> the owner of the wine: <b>I was</b> merely <b>fooling with you.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> case in the mishna <b>is not comparable</b> to the case cited above; <b>rather,</b> it is comparable <b>to the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>, which states: <b>And if he said to</b> the ferryman: <b>Take this dinar as your wage and take me across</b> the river, the prisoner must <b>give him his wage in the full amount,</b> i.e., the entire dinar.

### Part 6
<b>What is different</b> in <b>the first clause,</b> which states that the ferryman receives only his regular wage, <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> which states that he receives the full dinar? <b>Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> The latter clause deals <b>with a trapper who scoops fish from the sea,</b> i.e., a fisherman, <b>and he</b> can <b>say to</b> the prisoner: <b>You have caused me a loss</b> of <b>fish [<i>kavrei</i>]</b> worth <b>a dinar,</b> which I would have caught had I not taken you across the river. Similarly, in the case in the mishna, the owner of the wine sustains a financial loss in order to save the honey, and therefore he is entitled to the compensation that the owner of the honey agreed to pay.

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>a river washed away his donkey and the donkey of the other</b> man, and <b>his donkey is worth one hundred dinars,</b> etc. The Gemara notes: <b>And it</b> is <b>necessary</b> to teach both the case of the barrels of wine and honey and the case of the donkeys, <b>as if it</b> had <b>taught us</b> only <b>the first</b> case, that of the wine and honey, it might be said that <b>it is</b> only <b>there,</b> in that case, <b>that when</b> the owner of the wine <b>states</b> his stipulation, the owner of the honey <b>gives him the value of</b> the <b>entire</b> loss. Why is this? It is <b>because</b> the wine <b>is lost through</b> the direct <b>action</b> of its owner. <b>But here,</b> in the case of the donkeys, <b>since</b> the donkey is lost <b>by itself</b> in the river, <b>let us say:</b> The one who salvages the donkey of his fellow <b>has</b> the right to <b>only his wage,</b> i.e., compensation for his labor.

### Part 8
<b>And if</b> the mishna had <b>taught us</b> only the case of <b>the latter clause,</b> it might be said: <b>It is here,</b> in the case of the donkeys, <b>that</b> if the intention of the one who saved the donkey was <b>unspecified,</b> i.e., he did not stipulate that the owner of the other donkey would compensate him for the loss of his own donkey, he <b>has</b> the right to <b>only his wage, because</b> the donkey is lost <b>by itself. But there,</b> where the barrel of wine is lost <b>through</b> the direct <b>action</b> of its owner, one might <b>say: Even in</b> a case where the intention of the owner of the wine was <b>unspecified,</b> the owner of the honey must <b>give him the value of</b> the <b>entire</b> barrel of wine. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, both cases are <b>necessary.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara cites a relevant discussion. <b>Rav Kahana raised a dilemma before Rav:</b> If one <b>descended</b> into the river <b>to rescue</b> another’s donkey instead of his own after stipulating that he would be compensated for the loss of his own donkey, <b>and his</b> own donkey <b>emerged</b> from the river <b>by itself, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the rescuer still entitled to payment from the owner of the donkey that he saved, despite the fact that he did not suffer a monetary loss? Rav <b>said to him:</b> The rescuer is still compensated because it was <b>from Heaven</b> that <b>mercy was bestowed upon him,</b> and his good fortune does not affect the stipulation.

### Part 10
This <b>is like that</b> case where <b>Rav Safra was traveling in a caravan,</b> and <b>a certain lion</b> followed them, <b>accompanying them</b> along the way. <b>Every night,</b> the travelers <b>would send one of their donkeys to</b> the lion, <b>and</b> the lion <b>would eat</b> it. <b>When Rav Safra’s time arrived</b> to provide the lion with prey, <b>he sent it</b> his <b>donkey but</b> the lion <b>did not eat it. Rav Safra went ahead and acquired it</b> back, as his donkey had become ownerless when he presented it to the lion. Although Rav Safra did not lose his donkey, he had fulfilled his obligation to provide the lion with a donkey, and his good fortune did not affect his obligation vis-à-vis the other travelers.

### Part 11
With regard to this episode, <b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: Why</b> was it necessary <b>for him to acquire</b> the donkey again? <b>Although</b> Rav Safra <b>made it ownerless</b> by sending it to the lion, it was <b>made ownerless</b> only <b>with the intention that the lion</b> would consume it, but <b>it was not made ownerless with the intention that everyone</b> else could acquire it. Accordingly, no one else could have acquired the donkey. Ravina <b>said to him: Rav Safra did</b> so <b>as an added precaution.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav raised a dilemma before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: If one <b>descended</b> into the river in order <b>to rescue</b> another’s donkey instead of his own, <b>but</b> he <b>did not</b> manage to <b>rescue</b> it, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the stipulation still apply so that the owner of the donkey he attempted to rescue must compensate him for the loss of his own donkey? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: And is this a question?</b> It is clear that <b>he has</b> the right to collect <b>only his wage,</b> but he is not entitled to the value of his own donkey.

### Part 13
Rav <b>raised an objection to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s ruling from a <i>baraita</i>: In a case of <b>one who hires a laborer</b>
