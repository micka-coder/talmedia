### Part 1
then <b>also with regard to damages, let</b> the buyer <b>say this</b> to the injured party. He could threaten to return the bill of sale of the inferior-quality land to the debtor, which would force the injured party to collect directly from the debtor’s inferior-quality land. Since the buyer can do so, he can effectively force the injured party to collect from the purchased intermediate-quality land instead of fulfilling his right to collect from superior-quality land. Yet, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that in this case each party collects from the land that was originally liened to him, which means that damages are collected from the superior-quality land, indicating that this threat would not be effective.

### Part 2
<b>Rather, with what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with</b> a case in which the debtor died and his inheritors are his <b>orphans, who are not subject to</b> an obligation to <b>repay</b> the debts of their father. When one dies, his monetary debts are not inherited by his children. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>the lien of</b> the creditor <b>rests</b> solely <b>upon the buyer</b> of the land. Any lien that was in effect with regard to the land he owned at the time he incurred the obligation remains, and his creditors can therefore collect what they are owed from that land, even if it is in the possession of a buyer.

### Part 3
<b>Therefore, one cannot say</b> that the ruling in the <i>baraita</i> is based on the fact that the buyer can threaten to return the bill of sale to the debtor, or in this case, to his orphans. In this case, even if he were to return the bill of sale, the creditors would not be able to collect from the land now in the orphans’ possession, as they received it anew, not as an inheritance from their father. Therefore, the creditors can still collect from the plots of land that remain with the buyer.

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests another explanation of the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Rather,</b> not all the creditors collect from the superior-quality land, which was the last plot of land purchased from the debtor, <b>because</b> the buyer <b>can say to them: What is the reason</b> that <b>the Sages said one is not paid from liened</b> property, i.e., property liened to a creditor that has been sold by the debtor, <b>whenever there is unsold</b> property still in the debtor’s possession? It is <b>due to an ordinance</b> created solely <b>for my</b> benefit, as I should not be expected to pay from the land I purchased when the debtor is still able to pay. If that ordinance were to be in effect in this case, all of their liens would be in effect with regard to the superior-quality land, as that was purchased last. In this case <b>I do not</b> find <b>this ordinance satisfactory to me,</b> and I would prefer for the lien of each creditor to remain in effect with regard to the land it had been on initially, and I will give each of you that land.

### Part 5
The Gemara notes: This fact that one is not required to avail himself of the financial benefit provided by a rabbinic ordinance <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava. As Rava says: Anyone who says: I do not want</b> to avail myself <b>of</b> the financial benefit provided by <b>an ordinance of the Sages, such as this</b> one, <b>one listens to him.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does Rava mean by saying: An ordinance of the Sages, <b>such as this</b> one?

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: His statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Huna. As Rav Huna says:</b> The Sages enacted that a husband must sustain his wife. They also enacted that he receives her earnings in exchange. Yet, <b>a wife is</b> legally <b>entitled to say to her husband: I will not be sustained</b> by you, <b>and</b> in turn <b>I will not work</b> i.e., you will not keep my earnings. Since his obligation to sustain her is only for her benefit, she may forgo her sustenance and retain her earnings for herself.

### Part 8
The Gemara discusses a limitation on the buyer’s ability to refuse the benefit of the rabbinic ordinance: <b>It is obvious</b> that if the <b>buyer sold,</b> of the land he purchased from the debtor, the <b>intermediate- and inferior-quality</b> land to another buyer <b>and retained in his possession</b> only the <b>superior-quality</b> land, which he had purchased last, <b>then all</b> the creditors <b>may come and collect from</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land.

### Part 9
<b>For</b> if the intermediate-quality and inferior quality land were in his possession, <b>he would be able to say to</b> the creditors: <b>Collect from</b> the <b>intermediate-quality</b> land and from the <b>inferior-quality</b> land, as <b>it is not satisfactory to me</b> to avail myself of the <b>ordinance of the Sages</b>. Now the he has sold the land of intermediate and inferior quality, however, he cannot unilaterally waive the ordinance without the consent of the second buyer. The second buyer benefits from the ordinance, since it compels the creditors to collect from the first buyer, and he will therefore certainly not agree to waive it.

### Part 10
<b>But if</b> the first buyer <b>sold</b> only the <b>superior-quality</b> land that he had purchased last, <b>and</b> he <b>retained</b> in his possession the <b>intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 11
<b>Abaye thought to say: All</b> the creditors <b>should come</b> and <b>collect from</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land. Since that land was the last plot of land in the debtor’s possession, the creditors’ right of collection was restricted to that land, irrespective of the fact that it was then subsequently sold twice.

### Part 12
<b>Rava said to him: What has the first</b> person <b>sold to the second</b> in any sale? <b>Any rights that will come into his possession. And since, if</b> the creditors <b>were to come to</b> the <b>first buyer</b> while he was still in possession of all three plots of land, <b>he could have had them collect from</b> the <b>intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land; <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though when he</b> initially <b>purchased</b> the <b>intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land the <b>superior-quality</b> land <b>was</b> still <b>unsold</b> property in the debtor’s possession. As although there is the rabbinic ordinance that <b>one does not exact payment from liened property when there is unsold</b> property still in the debtor’s possession, the buyer <b>could have said to them: I do not</b> find <b>this ordinance satisfactory to me.</b>

### Part 13
Rava continues: Therefore, since the first buyer had the right to say this, the <b>second buyer can also say to them: Collect</b> from the <b>intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land in the first buyer’s possession. <b>As, when the second buyer purchased</b> the superior-quality land, <b>he purchased</b> it <b>with the understanding that he</b> also acquired <b>all the rights that the first</b> buyer <b>had with regard to</b> that land. Accordingly, he also acquires the right to insist that the creditors collect from the intermediate-quality and inferior-quality land.

### Part 14
In a related ruling, <b>Rava says:</b> In the case of <b>Reuven, who sold all of his fields to Shimon</b> simultaneously <b>and Shimon proceeded to sell one field</b> of those purchased <b>to Levi, and Reuven’s creditor came</b> to collect the debt, if the creditor so <b>desires, he collects from this</b> one, i.e., Shimon, and if <b>he</b> so <b>desires, he collects from that</b> one, i.e., Levi. <b>And we said this only</b> in a case <b>where</b> Levi <b>purchased intermediate-quality</b> land from Shimon. A creditor’s right is to collect the debt from intermediate-quality land. Accordingly, in this case, Reuven’s creditor can collect his loan from the intermediate-quality land even after it has been transferred into Levi’s possession. Nevertheless, if he so desires, he may insist on collecting his loan from any inferior-quality land left in Shimon’s possession. This is because a creditor also has the right to demand payment from a borrower’s inferior-quality land instead of his intermediate-quality land, and therefore that land is also liened to the loan.

### Part 15
<b>But</b> if Levi <b>purchased superior-quality and inferior-quality</b> land from Shimon, <b>no,</b> the creditor can collect only from Shimon’s intermediate-quality land, <b>as</b> Levi could <b>say to him: For this</b> reason <b>I was particular to purchase superior-quality and inferior-quality</b> land, which is <b>land that is not fit for you</b> to collect from as a creditor.

### Part 16
<b>And if</b> Levi <b>purchased</b> the <b>intermediate-quality</b> land from Shimon <b>as well, we said</b> that Reuven’s creditor can collect from him <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he did not leave</b> some <b>similar intermediate-quality</b> land in Shimon’s possession, <b>as</b> in that case, Levi <b>is unable to say to</b> the creditor: <b>I left a place for you,</b> i.e., a plot of land, <b>in Shimon’s possession,</b> from which to collect. <b>But</b> where Levi <b>did leave</b> some <b>similar intermediate-quality</b> land <b>in Shimon’s possession,</b> the creditor <b>does not collect from</b> Levi, <b>as</b> Levi <b>is able to say to him: I left a place for you from which to collect.</b>

### Part 17
In another related ruling, <b>Abaye says:</b> In the case of <b>Reuven, who sold a field</b> liened to his creditor <b>to Shimon with a guarantee,</b> meaning that Reuven agreed to reimburse Shimon should Reuven’s creditor collect the debt from that field, <b>and Reuven’s creditor came and seized</b> the field <b>from Shimon, the <i>halakha</i> is that Reuven</b> can <b>go and litigate with</b> his creditor and claim that he had already repaid the debt, and insist that the field be returned to Shimon. <b>And</b> the creditor <b>is unable to say to</b> Reuven: <b>I am not legally answerable to you,</b> as I am not taking away your land, since you sold it to Shimon. This is <b>because</b> Reuven could <b>say to him: If you extract</b> the field <b>from him,</b> Shimon <b>will return to me</b> and demand that I reimburse him for his loss. Consequently, I am involved in this matter.

### Part 18
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say: Even</b> in a case <b>where</b> he sold the field <b>without a guarantee, as well,</b> in which case even if the creditor seizes Shimon’s land there are no legal consequences for Reuven, Reuven can litigate with the creditor, <b>as</b> he could <b>say to him: It is not satisfactory for me for Shimon to have a grievance against me</b> because he lost the field I sold him on account of the fact that I was unable to pay my debt. Consequently, I am involved in this matter.

### Part 19
<b>And</b> in another related ruling, <b>Abaye says:</b> In the case of <b>Reuven, who sold a field to Shimon without a guarantee,</b>
