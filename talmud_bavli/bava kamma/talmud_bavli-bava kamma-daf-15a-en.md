### Part 1
<b>free men and members of the covenant.</b> The mishna states: <b>Free men, to exclude</b> Canaanite <b>slaves</b> from being valid witnesses, and it states: <b>Members of the covenant, to exclude gentiles.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach both exceptions, <b>as had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only about <b>a slave,</b> I might have presumed that he is disqualified from serving as a witness <b>because he has no lineage,</b> i.e., the child of a Canaanite slave is not legally considered to be his child in any sense; <b>but a</b> free <b>gentile, who has lineage, I might say no,</b> he is qualified. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only about <b>a gentile,</b> I might have presumed that he is disqualified from serving as a witness <b>because he has no connection to</b> the <b>mitzvot</b> of the Torah; <b>but</b> with regard to a Canaanite <b>slave, who does have a connection to</b> the <b>mitzvot,</b> as he is obligated to keep the mitzvot that a woman is obligated to keep, <b>I might say no,</b> he is qualified. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach both exceptions.

### Part 3
§ The mishna continues: <b>And women are included in the</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b>damages</b> in the same way as men. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived?

### Part 4
The Gemara presents three sources for this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and similarly, the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The <b>verse states</b> with regard to the liability of one who takes a false oath that he had not stolen: <b>“When a man or woman shall commit any of the sins</b> of a person” (Numbers 5:6). <b>The verse equates a woman with a man with regard to all punishments in the Torah.</b>

### Part 5
<b>The school of Rabbi Elazar taught:</b> The verse states with regard to the civil laws given following the revelation at Sinai: <b>“And these are the civil laws that you shall set before them”</b> (Exodus 21:1). The reference to “them” in the verse is referring to all those who stood at the revelation, both men and women. <b>The verse</b> thereby <b>equates a woman with a man with regard to all civil laws in the Torah.</b>

### Part 6
<b>The school of Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yosei HaGelili taught:</b> The <b>verse states</b> with regard to liability in a case where one’s ox kills a person: <b>“And it killed a man or a woman”</b> (Exodus 21:29). <b>The verse</b> thereby <b>equates a woman with a man with regard to all killings in the Torah,</b> i.e., the liability incurred is the same whether the person killed was a man or a woman.

### Part 7
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> all three sources <b>are necessary, as had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only <b>the first</b> source, one might have said that it <b>is there</b> that men and women are equated, <b>as the Merciful One had pity upon</b> a woman and made her liable <b>in order that she should achieve atonement</b> through paying restitution. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>civil law,</b> one might say that for <b>a man, who is involved in business dealings, yes,</b> the civil laws apply to him, but to <b>a woman,</b> who generally is not involved in business dealings, the laws do <b>not apply.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only that men and women are equated in <b>civil law,</b> one might have said that this is <b>in order that she should</b> be able to <b>sustain</b> herself by engaging in business dealings. If civil laws did not apply to a woman, one would be wary about conducting business with her. <b>But</b> with regard to obligating a woman to achieve <b>atonement,</b> one might have said that <b>a man, who is obligated in mitzvot, yes,</b> he is similarly obligated to achieve atonement; but <b>a woman, who is not obligated in</b> all the <b>mitzvot</b> to the same extent as a man, no, the obligation does <b>not</b> apply to her.

### Part 9
<b>And had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only <b>these</b> first <b>two</b> sources, one might have limited the fact that a woman and man are equated to these two cases, <b>here due to</b> the fact that she also needs <b>atonement, and there due to</b> the fact that she needs to be able to <b>sustain</b> herself. <b>But with regard to</b> one’s liability for his ox <b>killing</b> a person, one might have said that only for killing <b>a man, who is obligated in</b> all <b>mitzvot,</b> yes, the owner of the ox is liable <b>to pay a ransom;</b> but for killing <b>a woman,</b> who is not obligated in all mitzvot, one might say he is <b>not</b> liable.

### Part 10
<b>And had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only the equivalence of a man and woman with regard to <b>a ransom,</b> one might have thought that this is <b>because</b> it is a very serious matter as <b>there is a loss of life, but</b> in <b>these</b> first <b>two</b> sources, <b>where there is not a loss of life, I would say no,</b> a woman is not included. Accordingly, it is <b>necessary</b> to have all three sources.

### Part 11
§ The mishna continues: <b>And</b> both <b>the injured</b> party <b>and the one liable for the damage</b> are involved <b>in</b> the <b>payment.</b>

### Part 12
An amoraic dispute <b>was stated</b> with regard to the payment of <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> made when one’s innocuous ox gores another’s animal. <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> It is <b>monetary restitution</b> for the injured party’s loss. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says:</b> It is <b>a fine.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara elucidates: <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The payment is <b>monetary restitution,</b> as <b>he holds</b> that even <b>ordinary oxen,</b> which have not been forewarned with regard to Goring, are <b>not presumed to be safeguarded,</b> as their nature does not prevent them from acting in a belligerent manner. Therefore, the owner is responsible to safeguard them, to prevent them from doing so. Accordingly, if an ox causes damage by goring, <b>by right it</b> should have been <b>that</b> the owner <b>needs to pay</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the damage. Nevertheless, <b>the Merciful One had pity upon him, as his ox had not yet been forewarned</b> and he was not fully aware of the possibility that it might gore, and accordingly, the Torah reduced the extent of his liability.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says:</b> It is <b>a fine,</b> as <b>he holds</b> that <b>ordinary oxen</b> are <b>presumed to be safeguarded,</b> as their nature prevents them from acting in a belligerent manner. Therefore, the owner is not responsible for safeguarding them to prevent them from doing so. Accordingly, if an ox causes damage by goring, <b>by right it</b> should have been <b>that</b> the owner <b>does not pay at all.</b> Nevertheless, <b>the Merciful One penalized him in order that he will safeguard his ox,</b> even before it is forewarned, and decreed that the fine should be given to the injured party even though he is not really entitled to be compensated for his loss.

### Part 15
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: Both <b>the injured</b> party <b>and the one liable for the damage</b> are involved <b>in</b> the <b>payment. Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <b>the</b> payment of <b>half the</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> is <b>monetary restitution,</b> this assumes that the injured party is theoretically entitled to receive the full value of his damaged animal but in practice receives only half. <b>This is</b> what the mishna means by saying <b>that the injured</b> party is also <b>involved in</b> the <b>payment,</b> because it is as though he is compelled to forgo half of the cost of the damage that by right he should be paid. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>the</b> payment of <b>half the</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> is <b>a fine,</b> which assumes that the injured party is not really entitled to be compensated for his loss, <b>now that</b> even the money that <b>he takes is not his</b> by right, is it accurate to describe him <b>as being</b> involved <b>in the payment?</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara explains: The mishna’s statement <b>is necessary only with regard to</b> the fact that the injured party is the one who absorbs the loss due to the <b>diminishing</b> value <b>of the carcass</b> between the animal’s death and the time that the case is brought before the court. Since he must absorb this financial loss, it may be said that he is involved in the payment.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: How can one claim that the mishna is referring to the <b>diminishing</b> value <b>of the carcass? Isn’t it</b> already <b>taught</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, which by using the term: <b>Payments</b> of restitution <b>for damage, teaches that the owner</b> of the injured animal <b>attends to,</b> i.e., retains ownership of, <b>the animal carcass?</b> And therefore it follows that he bears any depreciation in its value, as the Gemara (10b) explained above.

### Part 18
The Gemara explains why the mishna needs to teach this principle twice: <b>One</b> mention is made <b>with regard to an innocuous</b> ox <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> is made <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox.

### Part 19
<b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state both cases, <b>because if it would teach us</b> the principle only with regard to <b>an innocuous</b> ox, I might say that only there does the Torah limit the liability of the owner of the ox, <b>because it has not yet been forewarned. But</b> with regard to <b>a forewarned</b> ox, <b>I would say</b> the Torah does <b>not</b> limit the owner’s liability at all and the owner must also bear the loss due to the diminishing value of the carcass. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>if it would teach us</b> the principle only with regard to <b>a forewarned</b> ox, I might say that only there does the Torah limit the owner’s liability <b>because he is paying the full</b> cost <b>of</b> the damage, so the Torah does not overly burden him. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>an innocuous</b> ox, where he is liable for only half of the damage, <b>I would say</b> the Torah does <b>not</b> limit his liability any further, so he must bear the loss of the diminishing value of the carcass. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to state the principle in both cases.

### Part 20
The Gemara attempts to prove whether the payment of half the cost of the damage is considered to be monetary restitution or a fine: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (16b): <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the liability incurred for damage caused by <b>an innocuous</b> ox <b>and</b> that caused by <b>a forewarned</b> ox? The difference is <b>that</b> the owner of <b>an innocuous</b> ox <b>pays half the</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> exclusively <b>from</b> proceeds of the sale of <b>its body, and</b> the owner of <b>a forewarned</b> ox <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property.

### Part 21
The Gemara explains the challenge posed by the mishna: <b>And if it is so,</b> that payment for damage caused by an innocuous ox is considered a fine, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>also teach this</b> additional distinction: The owner of <b>an innocuous</b> ox <b>does not pay based on his own</b> admission, in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> that one does not pay a fine based on one’s own admission, whereas the owner of <b>a forewarned</b> ox <b>pays based on his own</b> admission.

### Part 22
The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> could have taught this distinction; however, <b>he taught</b> only certain distinctions <b>and omitted</b> others, including this one. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> else <b>did he omit that he omitted this?</b> A <i>tanna</i> would never omit just a single case, perforce there must be another <i>halakha</i> he omitted.

### Part 23
The Gemara answers: <b>He omitted</b> the <i>halakha</i> that if an innoc-uous ox kills someone, its owner does not pay even <b>half of the ransom</b> payment, whereas if the ox is forewarned, he pays the full ransom.

### Part 24
The Gemara rejects this: <b>If</b> one claims that the mishna omits the <i>halakha</i> of one who admits his liability <b>due to</b> the fact that it also omits the <i>halakha</i> that the owner of an innocuous ox does not pay even <b>half of the ransom,</b> that is a flawed claim, as <b>this is not an omission,</b> because one could say: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? It <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says</b> that when <b>an innocuous</b> ox kills a person, one <b>pays half the ransom,</b> and therefore the distinction between an innocuous and forewarned ox is included in the mishna’s ruling that the owner of an innocuous ox pays half the cost of the damage. Accordingly, no proof can be adduced from the mishna.

### Part 25
The Gemara suggests another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 41a):
