### Part 1
<b>But according to</b> Rava, who cited Rav Naḥman, <b>the one who says</b> that David <b>asked</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a concealed</b> article damaged by <b>a fire,</b> for <b>what</b> purpose does <b>he require the</b> two <b>verses</b> that describe a field of lentils and a field of barley? Rav Naḥman could have <b>said to you</b> that David <b>was asking</b> both about <b>concealed</b> articles damaged by a fire <b>and one of these</b> other two dilemmas.

### Part 2
<b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> one of <b>these two</b> explanations, that David was asking either about repaying barley with lentils or burning the stacks of barley, <b>this is as it is written</b> of David: <b>“But he would not drink it”</b> (II Samuel 23:16). David <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Since there is a prohibition</b> involved in this action, <b>it is not satisfactory to me</b> to act in this manner, even though technically it is permitted for a king. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that David <b>was raising a dilemma</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a concealed</b> article damaged by <b>a fire, since they sent him</b> an answer that was <b>a tradition</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i>, <b>what</b> is the meaning of: “But <b>he would not drink it”?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: This means <b>that he did not say the <i>halakha</i> in their names.</b> He did not transmit the ruling in the name of those who went in the time of battle to ask the Sages what the <i>halakha</i> is. David <b>said</b> to himself: <b>This</b> is the tradition that <b>I received from the court of Samuel of Rama:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who hands himself</b> over <b>to die for</b> the sake of <b>words of Torah,</b> the Sages <b>do not say a matter of <i>halakha</i> in his name,</b> so that others will not follow this ruling and endanger their lives.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks another question: The verse states: <b>“He poured it out to the Lord”</b> (II Samuel 23:16), which indicates that David acted stringently and did not rely on the lenient ruling that he received. <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> either of <b>these two</b> explanations, that David asked either about burning the stacks of barley or about replacing their value with lentils, he poured out the water to God <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he acted for the sake of Heaven</b> and did not rely on the lenient ruling he had received. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that David asked about <b>a concealed</b> article damaged by <b>a fire, what</b> is the reason that <b>he poured out</b> the water <b>to the Lord?</b> The Gemara answers: The reason is <b>that they said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>in the name of the tradition,</b> without associating it with any specific individual.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one kindled a fire that <b>crossed a fence that is four cubits high, or</b> if the fire crossed <b>the public thoroughfare, or</b> if the fire crossed <b>a river,</b> and in each case it caused damage on the other side, he is <b>exempt</b> from liability.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if a fire <b>crossed a fence that is four cubits in height,</b> the one who kindled the fire is <b>liable?</b> This appears to contradict the mishna.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> There is no dispute between the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna and the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>; there is merely a difference of how they stated their rulings. <b>The <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>counts</b> downward <b>from above to below.</b> In other words, if the fire crossed a fence <b>six cubits</b> high, the one who kindled the fire is <b>exempt;</b> if it crossed a fence <b>five cubits</b> high, he is <b>exempt;</b> and this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>until</b> the fire crosses a fence of a minimum of <b>four cubits</b> high, where the one who kindled the fire is still <b>exempt.</b> Conversely, <b>the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> counts</b> up <b>from below to above.</b> The meaning is that if the fire crossed a fence <b>two cubits</b> high, the one who kindled the fire is <b>liable;</b> if the fire crossed a fence <b>three cubits</b> high, he is <b>liable;</b> and this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>until</b> the fire crosses a fence of a maximum of <b>four cubits</b> high, where the one who kindled the fire is still <b>liable.</b> Accordingly, there is no contradiction between the mishna and the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 8
§ <b>Rava says: When they said</b> in the mishna with regard to a fire crossing a fence <b>four cubits</b> high <b>that</b> the one who kindled the fire is <b>exempt,</b> this is <b>even in a field of thorns. Rav Pappa says: And</b> Rava’s statement is referring to a case where the height of the fence <b>is four cubits</b> counting <b>from above the</b> upper <b>limit of the thorns.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav says: They taught</b> in the mishna that one is exempt from liability if the fire crosses a public thoroughfare <b>only in</b> a case where the flame <b>blazes high [<i>bekolaḥat</i>]. But in</b> a case where the flame <b>blazes low [<i>benikhpefet</i>]</b> and therefore spreads easily along the ground, the one who kindled the fire is <b>liable even</b> if the space that the fire crossed was <b>up to one hundred cubits. And Shmuel said: The mishna</b> exempts one from liability if the fire crosses a public thoroughfare <b>in</b> a case where the flame <b>blazes low, but in</b> a case where the flame <b>blazes high, even any</b> minimal gap between where the fire was kindled and where it caused damage renders the one who kindled the fire <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 10
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said</b> that one is exempt if the fire crosses a public thoroughfare? It is <b>in</b> a case where the flame <b>blazes high. But in</b> a case where the flame <b>blazes low and there is wood</b> to keep <b>it</b> burning, one is <b>liable even</b> if it causes damage at a distance of <b>up to one hundred <i>mil</i>.</b> If the fire <b>crossed a river or a pool [<i>shelulit</i>]</b> of water <b>that is eight cubits wide,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying for the damage caused, regardless of whether the fire blazed high or low.

### Part 11
§ The mishna teaches: If the fire crossed <b>the public thoroughfare,</b> he is exempt. The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who holds this opinion? <b>Rava said: It is Rabbi Eliezer, as we learned</b> in a mishna (61b) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One is liable up to a distance of <b>sixteen cubits, like</b> the width of <b>the public domain.</b> By inference, one is exempt if a fire crosses a greater distance, i.e., across a public thoroughfare.

### Part 12
The mishna teaches: <b>Or</b> if the fire crossed <b>a river,</b> he is exempt. <b>Rav says:</b> The term stream means <b>an actual river. And Shmuel says:</b> This term means <b>a water channel.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara explains their dispute: <b>The one who says</b> that it is referring to <b>an actual river,</b> Rav, deems exempt one whose fire crosses a riverbed <b>even when there is no water</b> in it, since it is sufficiently deep and wide to prevent a typical fire from crossing it. <b>But the one who says</b> that it is referring to <b>a water channel,</b> Shmuel, holds that <b>if</b> the fire crosses a water channel that <b>has water in it, yes,</b> the one who kindled the fire is exempt. <b>But if</b> the fire crosses a water channel that <b>does not have water in it,</b> he is <b>not</b> exempt.

### Part 14
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Pe’a</i> 2:1): <b>And these,</b> the following list of features, <b>divide</b> a field <b>for the purpose of <i>pe’a</i>,</b> i.e., it is no longer considered a single field, but instead <i>pe’a</i> must be given from each separate section: <b>A stream, a <i>shelulit</i>, a private road, and a public thoroughfare.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>a <i>shelulit</i>? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> It is <b>a place where rainwater gathers [<i>sholelin</i>]. Rav Beivai says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says: It is <b>a water channel that distributes</b> its <b>spoils [<i>shalal</i>] to its banks,</b> since the water spreads to the adjacent cisterns.

### Part 16
The Gemara points out that according to the <b>one who says</b> that it means <b>a place where rainwater gathers,</b> Shmuel, since gathered rainwater divides a field, <b>all the more so</b> does <b>a water channel,</b> which is both larger and permanent, divide a field. <b>But</b> according to the <b>one who says</b> that only <b>a water channel</b> divides a field, Rabbi Yoḥanan, he holds that only that divides a field, <b>but a place where rainwater gathers does not divide</b> the field, <b>since these</b>
