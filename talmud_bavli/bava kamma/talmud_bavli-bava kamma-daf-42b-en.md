### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>But let Rabbi Akiva say to himself</b> the same objection that he raised against Rabbi Eliezer’s interpretation of the verse, that the owner of an innocuous ox is exempt from paying half a ransom (see 41b): Why is it necessary for the verse to teach this? <b>But isn’t</b> compensation for damage caused by an innocuous ox <b>itself paid only from</b> the value of <b>its body?</b> Therefore, its owner can say to the slave’s owner: <b>Bring it to court and you will be paid from it.</b> Since the ox was stoned, there is nothing from which he can collect payment.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said:</b> Rabbi Akiva’s interpretation is applicable in a case <b>where its owner slaughtered it first,</b> before it was sentenced to stoning. <b>Lest you say</b> that the slave’s owner <b>should be paid from</b> the value of the flesh, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that <b>since</b> the ox <b>was subject to be killed, although</b> its owner <b>slaughtered it,</b> the slave’s owner <b>should not be paid from it.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why did Rabbi Akiva raise this objection against Rabbi Eliezer’s interpretation? <b>According to Rabbi Eliezer as well,</b> it could be explained as referring to a case <b>where</b> its owner <b>slaughtered it first.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>Indeed,</b> Rabbi Eliezer’s interpretation could also be explained in this manner. <b>And</b> the reason Rabbi Akiva raised this objection was because <b>he reasons: Perhaps</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>has another explanation that is better than this one, and will state it.</b> Rabbi Eliezer did in fact respond with another explanation.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>But let Rabbi Eliezer also answer him that</b> the owner <b>slaughtered it first.</b> Why did he offer a different explanation? The Gemara answers that Rabbi Eliezer could have <b>said to you: Specifically there,</b> in the case Rabbi Eliezer referred to in his explanation, namely, <b>where</b> the ox <b>intended to kill</b> another <b>animal but killed a person</b> instead, <b>since the ox was not subject to be killed at all,</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>he should be liable</b> to pay half a ransom from the ox’s body. Therefore, <b>the verse is necessary to exclude</b> the owner from liability to pay half a ransom. <b>But here, since</b> the ox <b>was initially subject to be killed, a verse is not necessary</b> to teach that the owner is exempt from paying half a ransom <b>even if he slaughtered it.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according <b>to Rabbi Akiva also, certainly it is so,</b> that a verse is not necessary to teach that if the owner slaughters the ox before its verdict he is exempt from liability.

### Part 7
<b>Rather, Rav Asi said:</b> The above explanation of Rabbi Akiva’s interpretation should be rejected, as <b>I heard this</b> following <b>statement from a great man, and who is he?</b> He is <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina.</b> This is what he said: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since Rabbi Akiva says</b> in the mishna (33a) that in a case where a person and an innocuous ox damaged each other concurrently, the owner of <b>an innocuous</b> ox <b>that injured a person also pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage with regard to the difference</b> between the two valuations of the damage, as there is no distinction between an innocuous ox and a forewarned ox with regard to injuries caused to a person, <b>compensation for the slave is also paid from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, not from the body of the ox; just as in a case where a forewarned ox kills a slave. Therefore, its owner cannot say: Bring it to court and you will be paid from it. To counter this possibility, <b>the Merciful One wrote: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> indicating that he is exempt from this liability.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rav Asi: But didn’t Rabbi Akiva</b> already <b>break</b> the force of <b>his fist,</b> i.e., qualify this opinion of his? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that the owner of an innocuous ox that injured a person <b>pays</b> compensation <b>from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, the same as the owner of a forewarned ox. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “According to this judgment shall be done to him [<i>lo</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:31), indicating that <b>he pays</b> restitution exclusively <b>from</b> the <b>body</b> of the ox <b>but he does not pay from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, as the word <i>lo</i> also means: To it. This negates Rav Asi’s explanation of Rabbi Akiva’s interpretation.

### Part 9
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> a different explanation of Rabbi Akiva’s statement: The verse is <b>necessary</b> because it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since I,</b> referring to the Torah, <b>am more stringent with regard to</b> a forewarned ox that kills a person in the case of a Canaanite <b>slave than</b> in the case of <b>a freeman; as</b> in the case of <b>a freeman</b> who was <b>worth</b> one <b><i>sela</i></b> the owner of the ox <b>gives</b> one <b><i>sela</i></b> in ransom, and if he was worth <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> <b>he gives thirty; but</b> in the case of a Canaanite <b>slave</b> the Torah imposes a fixed amount, so even if he was <b>worth</b> only one <b><i>sela</i></b> the owner <b>gives thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, therefore, since the Torah is more stringent in the case of a slave, <b>payment for the slave should also be paid from</b> the owner’s <b>superior-quality</b> property. To counter this, <b>the Merciful One writes: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> indicating that payment is not required in a case where an innocuous ox kills a slave.

### Part 10
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation <b>of Rava</b> to Rabbi Akiva’s statement. The <i>baraita</i> states that with regard to the verse <b>“The owner of the ox shall be clear,” Rabbi Akiva says:</b> He shall be <b>clear from payment for</b> a Canaanite <b>slave.</b>

### Part 11
Rabbi Akiva discusses this interpretation: <b>And</b> could this <i>halakha</i> <b>not</b> be derived through <b>logical inference,</b> without the verse? <b>Since</b> the Torah <b>deemed</b> him <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for</b> the killing of <b>a slave and deemed</b> him <b>liable for</b> the killing of <b>a freeman</b> as well, <b>just as when</b> the Torah <b>deemed</b> him <b>liable for a freeman you distinguished between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox, as no ransom is paid in the case of an innocuous ox, <b>so too, when</b> the Torah <b>deemed</b> him <b>liable for a slave, let us distinguish between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox.

### Part 12
<b>Furthermore,</b> this <i>halakha</i> could be proven through an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If,</b> in the case of <b>a freeman, where he,</b> the owner, <b>gives his full value, you distinguished between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox, with regard to <b>a slave, where he gives only thirty</b> <i>sela</i> and not more, even if the slave was worth more, <b>is it not logical that we should distinguish between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox, and exempt him from liability for an innocuous ox?

### Part 13
Rabbi Akiva rejects this opinion: <b>No,</b> one could disagree and say the opposite: <b>I,</b> referring to the Torah, <b>am more stringent with regard to</b> the case of <b>a slave than</b> with regard to that of <b>a freeman; as</b> for <b>a freeman worth</b> one <b><i>sela</i>,</b> the ox’s owner <b>gives</b> only one <b><i>sela</i>,</b> and if he is worth <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> <b>he gives thirty. But</b> in the case of <b>a slave,</b> even if he was <b>worth</b> only one <b><i>sela</i>, he gives thirty</b> <i>sela</i>. Therefore, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should be liable</b> to pay for a slave killed by his innocuous ox. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> indicating that he shall be <b>clear from</b> paying <b>compensation for a slave.</b>

### Part 14
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states with regard to a forewarned ox: “But if the ox was a goring ox in time past and warning has been given to its owner, and he has not secured it; <b>and it killed a man or a woman;</b> the ox shall be stoned” (Exodus 21:29). <b>Rabbi Akiva said: And what does this come to teach us? If</b> it is <b>to deem</b> the owner <b>liable for</b> the killing of <b>a woman</b> just <b>as</b> for the killing of <b>a man, this is already stated</b> with regard to an innocuous ox, where it is stated: <b>“When an ox gores a man or a woman,</b> and they die, the ox shall be stoned” (Exodus 21:28).

### Part 15
<b>Rather,</b> the verse is stated <b>to compare a woman to a man</b> with regard to another issue: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a man,</b> payment for <b>his injuries</b> is paid <b>to his heirs, so too,</b> with regard to <b>a woman,</b> payment for <b>her injuries</b> is paid <b>to her heirs,</b> and not to her husband.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Akiva hold</b> that <b>a husband does not inherit</b> from his wife? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall inherit it [<i>otah</i>]”</b> (Numbers 27:11). <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that the husband inherits</b> from <b>his wife,</b> as <i>otah</i> also means: Her. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>says</b> that her heirs and not her husband receive the payment <b>only with regard to ransom, since it is paid only posthumously and is</b> therefore <b>considered</b> property <b>due</b> to her; <b>and the husband does not take</b> in inheritance the property <b>due</b> to the deceased <b>as</b> he does the property she <b>possessed.</b> For instance, an inheritance that would have gone to the woman had she been alive is not awarded to the husband, but rather, to her other heirs.

### Part 18
<b>What is the reason</b> for the assumption that even if it is clear that the victim is about to die, the husband is not owed ransom? <b>The verse states: “And it killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death. If a ransom is laid on him,</b> then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid on him” (Exodus 21:29–30), indicating that the owner’s liability to pay ransom is dependent on the ox’s liability to be stoned, which, in turn, applies only after the death of the victim.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to damages, did Rabbi Akiva not say</b> that damages due to a wife are paid to her heirs and not to her husband, just as with regard to ransom?

### Part 20
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If an assailant <b>struck the woman and her offspring emerged</b> due to miscarriage, <b>he gives</b> compensation for <b>damage and pain to the woman and compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring to the husband.</b> If <b>the husband is not</b> alive, <b>he gives</b> the compensation for the offspring <b>to his heirs.</b> If <b>the woman is not</b> alive, <b>he gives</b> the payment owed to her <b>to her heirs.</b> If <b>she was</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant and</b> then <b>she was emancipated,</b>
