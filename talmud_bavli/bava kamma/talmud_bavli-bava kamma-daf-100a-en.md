<b>the core of their existence,</b> i.e., Torah study, which is the source of life. <b>“The way”; this</b> is referring to <b>acts of kindness. “They must walk”; this</b> is referring to <b>visiting the sick. “Wherein”; this</b> is referring to the <b>burial</b> of the dead. <b>“The work”; this</b> is referring to conducting oneself in accordance with <b>the law. “That they must do”; this</b> is referring to conducting oneself <b>beyond the letter of the law.</b> This indicates that the Torah mandates that people conduct themselves beyond the letter of the law.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>Reish Lakish presented a dinar to Rabbi Elazar</b> so that the latter would assess it. Rabbi Elazar <b>said: It is a proper</b> coin. Reish Lakish <b>said to him: Realize that I am relying on you.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: What</b> is the purpose <b>of stating that you are relying on me?</b> Is it so <b>that if</b> this dinar <b>is</b> later <b>found</b> to be <b>bad, I will be required to exchange it for you</b> with a good dinar? <b>But</b> it is <b>you who said</b> that <b>it is Rabbi Meir</b> who is of the opinion <b>that</b> there is <b>liability</b> for damage caused by <b>indirect</b> action, even if he did not directly cause damage to the property. <b>What, is it not</b> that you intended to say: This is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, but we do not hold in accordance with his</b> opinion?

### Part 3
Reish Lakish <b>said to him: No,</b> I intended to say that this is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and we</b> do <b>hold in accordance with his</b> opinion.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> is Rabbi Elazar referring to? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>this</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> that is difficult. Parenthetically, the Gemara states that the letters <b><i>dalet</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>peh</i></b> serve as <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the four statements of Rabbi Meir that will be cited. It stands for: Judged [<i>dan</i>], to dye [<i>litzboa</i>], covers [<i>mesakekh</i>], and broke open [<i>pirtza</i>].

### Part 5
The Gemara returns to the matter at hand. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 28b): If a judge <b>issued a judgment</b> and erred, and he <b>acquitted</b> one who was in fact <b>liable,</b> or <b>deemed liable</b> one who should have in fact been <b>acquitted,</b> or if he <b>ruled</b> that <b>a pure</b> item is <b>impure,</b> or <b>ruled</b> that <b>an impure</b> item is <b>pure,</b> and by doing so he caused a litigant a monetary loss, <b>what he did is done,</b> i.e., the judgment stands, <b>and</b> the judge <b>must pay</b> damages <b>from his home,</b> i.e., from his personal funds. He is therefore liable to pay the damages even though he caused the loss indirectly.

### Part 6
The Gemara explains why this cannot be the statement of Rabbi Meir that Shmuel was referring to: <b>But wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Rabbi Ile’a says</b> that <b>Rav says: And this</b> mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> the judge not only issued a ruling, but actively <b>took</b> the money from the one whom he found liable, <b>and gave</b> it to the other party <b>by</b> his own <b>hand.</b> This is not a case of causation but of direct action.

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Elazar must be referring to <b>this</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Meir, as we learned</b> in a mishna (100b): If one gave wool to a dyer <b>to dye</b> it <b>red for him, and he dyed it black,</b> or to dye it <b>black, and he dyed it red, Rabbi Meir says:</b> The dyer <b>gives</b> the owner the <b>value of his wool.</b> The Gemara responds: This too does not prove that according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir one is liable even if the loss was brought about by causation, since <b>there he does</b> cause damage <b>through</b> direct <b>action.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Elazar must be referring to <b>this</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Meir, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 7:4): <b>One who drapes his grapevine atop another’s grain has rendered</b> them <b>forbidden</b> due to the prohibition against growing diverse kinds in a vineyard, <b>and</b> he <b>is liable</b> to pay the owner of the grain for the damage. The Gemara responds: This too does not prove that according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir one is liable even if the loss was brought about by causation, since <b>there too he does</b> cause damage <b>by</b> direct <b>action.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> it must be referring to <b>this</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Meir, as it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Kilayim</i> 3:4): If there was <b>a partition of a vineyard</b> that is adjacent to a wheat field, and <b>that</b> partition <b>broke open,</b>
