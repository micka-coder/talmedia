### Part 1
one cannot make such an inference from Rav’s statement. Rav <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> and this is how to understand his statement: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state that if the animal fell into the garden and <b>ate</b> from its produce, <b>that</b> the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> it <b>derives. But</b> if the produce softened the blow of <b>striking</b> the ground and thereby the animal avoided injury, one might <b>say</b> that the owner of the animal should not pay, on the grounds that the owner of the garden may be viewed, analogously, to one who <b>repels a lion from another’s property.</b> In such a case, although the latter benefited from his action, he is not obligated to pay for it. Similarly in this case, one might think that the owner of the animal does <b>not pay even</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> the animal <b>derived.</b> For this reason Rav <b>teaches us</b> that the owner of the animal must pay for this benefit as well.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b>this is indeed</b> the <i>halakha</i>, and the owner of the animal should be exempt for paying for the benefit of his animal not being injured?

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: One who <b>repels a lion from another’s property</b> does so <b>with intent,</b> knowing that he would be ineligible for payment. By contrast, <b>this</b> owner of the garden did <b>not</b> act <b>with intent</b> and would have preferred for the incident not to have happened. <b>Alternatively,</b> one could say that one who <b>repels a lion from another’s property does not</b> thereby <b>have any loss</b> himself. By contrast, <b>this</b> owner of the garden <b>has a loss,</b> in that his produce is damaged.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>How did</b> the animal <b>fall?</b> In which case does this <i>halakha</i> apply? <b>Rav Kahana says: It slipped on its</b> own <b>urine. Rava says: Another</b> animal belonging to the same owner <b>pushed it,</b> causing it to fall there.

### Part 5
The Gemara explains: Rava, <b>the one who says that</b> the mishna is referring to a case where <b>another</b> animal <b>pushed it,</b> in which case the owner pays only for the benefit that the animal derived and is exempt from paying for the damage caused, holds that <b>all the more so</b> this <i>halakha</i> would apply in a case <b>where it slipped on its urine,</b> which is beyond the owner’s control. <b>But</b> Rav Kahana, <b>the one who says</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>slipped on its urine,</b> holds that if, <b>however, another</b> animal <b>pushed it,</b> this indicates that the owner <b>was negligent</b> and should have prevented this happening. Therefore, in such a case, the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>what</b> his animal <b>damaged, since</b> the owner of the garden <b>can say to</b> the owner of the animal: <b>You should have led</b> your animals <b>across one by one,</b> so that they would not be able to push each other.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Kahana says: They taught only</b> that the owner pays for the benefit that it derives <b>in the same garden bed</b> into which it fell, <b>but</b> if it went <b>from</b> one <b>garden bed to</b> another <b>garden bed</b> and ate from that one, the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>what it damaged. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even</b> if the animal goes <b>from</b> one <b>garden bed to</b> another <b>garden bed</b> and eats, <b>and even</b> if the animal continues going from one bed to another and eating for <b>the entire day,</b> the owner pays only for the benefit that the animal derived and not for what it damaged, <b>unless it leaves</b> the garden entirely <b>and returns with</b> the owner’s <b>knowledge.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Pappa said,</b> explaining Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: <b>Do not say</b> this means: <b>Unless</b> the animal <b>leaves with</b> the owner’s <b>knowledge and returns with</b> his <b>knowledge; rather, once it leaves</b> the garden <b>with</b> the owner’s <b>knowledge, even if it returned without</b> his <b>knowledge,</b> the owner is liable to pay for what it damaged. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>that</b> the owner of the garden can <b>say to</b> the owner of the animal: <b>Since</b> the animal <b>has</b> now <b>learned</b> that the garden is there with food to eat, <b>every time it strays it will run to there.</b>

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches: If the animal <b>descended</b> into the garden <b>in its usual manner and caused damage</b> there, the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>what it damaged. Rabbi Yirmeya asks:</b> If the animal <b>descended in its usual manner and</b> gave birth to a calf there and <b>damaged</b> the produce <b>with amniotic fluid, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the owner of the animal have to pay for this damage?

### Part 9
The Gemara clarifies Rabbi Yirmeya’s question: <b>Do not raise the dilemma in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that one is <b>liable</b> in a case of damage that is <b>initially through negligence and ultimately by accident,</b> since in this case the owner was negligent in allowing the animal to enter another person’s courtyard, although the actual causing of the damage was ultimately by accident. <b>When should you raise this dilemma?</b> Raise it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the one who says</b> that one is <b>exempt</b> in a case that is <b>initially through negligence and ultimately by accident. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case?

### Part 10
The two sides of the question are as follows: <b>Do we say</b> that, <b>since</b> this case is <b>initially through negligence and ultimately by accident,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from liability? <b>Or perhaps here,</b> in this case, <b>it is entirely</b> due to his <b>negligence; since he saw that</b> the animal <b>was close to giving birth, he should have safeguarded it</b> adequately
