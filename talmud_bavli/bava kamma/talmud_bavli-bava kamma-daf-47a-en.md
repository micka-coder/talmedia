### Part 1
if <b>the cow is not</b> here, e.g., it went astray, only <b>one-quarter of</b> the cost of <b>the damage is reimbursed from the offspring.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara infers: According to Rava, <b>the reason</b> for paying only one-quarter of the cost of the damage is <b>that we do not know if the offspring was with it,</b> as a fetus, <b>when</b> the cow <b>gored or whether it was not. But</b> if it <b>is obvious to us that the offspring was with it</b> as a fetus <b>when it gored, the full</b> amount of <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage may be reimbursed from the offspring</b> if the cow is not there.

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: In this respect, <b>Rava</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rava says:</b> In the case of <b>a cow that caused damage</b> while pregnant, the injured party <b>collects</b> compensation <b>from its offspring,</b> i.e., the offspring that had been a fetus at the time of the goring. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is because <b>it is</b> considered an integral part of <b>its body</b> and therefore may be used to collect payment. By contrast, in the case of <b>a hen that caused damage,</b> the injured party <b>does not collect</b> compensation <b>from its egg.</b> Payment can be collected only from the body of the hen. <b>What is the reason?</b> The egg <b>is simply a secretion</b> and not an integral part of the hen’s body.

### Part 4
§ <b>And Rava</b> also <b>says:</b> When assessing the damage inflicted by a goring ox on a cow whose newborn calf is found dead by its side, the court <b>does not appraise</b> the damage <b>to the cow by itself and</b> the damage <b>to the offspring by itself. Rather,</b> the court <b>appraises the offspring together with the cow</b> and evaluates the overall damage inflicted on the pregnant cow, which will be slightly less than it would be with two separate evaluations. The reason for this is <b>that if you do not say this, you</b> will be <b>found</b> to have ultimately <b>weakened the one liable for damage</b> by inflicting a loss on him, as the market value of a newborn calf is greater than the difference in market value between a pregnant cow and one that is not pregnant.

### Part 5
<b>And similarly, you find</b> this principle in a case <b>where</b> someone <b>severed the hand of another’s slave.</b> The difference in value between a slave with a hand and a slave without a hand is assessed, rather than determining how much money the owner would request in exchange for allowing the hand of his slave to be cut off. <b>And similarly, you</b> also <b>find</b> this principle in a case <b>of one who causes damage</b> to part of <b>another’s field.</b> The court appraises not the garden bed that was eaten or trampled, but the depreciation in value of the bed as part of the surrounding area. This results in a smaller payment, as the damage appears less significant in the context of a larger area.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> The main reason invoked by Rava is that otherwise you will be found to have ultimately weakened the one liable for damage. <b>But if this is the <i>halakha</i></b> of assessing the damage, then <b>let the one liable for damage be weakened</b> by losing money.

### Part 7
Rav Ashi answered: This is <b>because</b> the one liable for damage <b>can say to him: I caused damage</b> to <b>you</b> through injuring <b>a pregnant cow,</b> and so <b>I am assessing</b> the value of <b>a pregnant cow for you.</b> Therefore, it is not correct to evaluate separately the damage to the cow and the damage to the offspring.

### Part 8
The Gemara raises a question: It <b>is obvious</b> that in a case where <b>the cow</b> belonged <b>to one</b> person <b>and the offspring</b> belonged <b>to another</b> that the compensation for the cow’s loss of <b>fat</b> is paid <b>to the owner of the cow.</b> The additional value that the cow had due to the fact that it was fatter due to the pregnancy is paid to the owner of the cow. The question is: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> concerning the cow’s <b>bulk?</b> There is an increase in value of a pregnant cow that it is attributed to its improved appearance, which results from its carrying a fetus. Who is considered the injured party with regard to that sum? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This too belongs <b>to the owner of the cow,</b> whereas <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: They divide</b> the restitution. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>they divide</b> the restitution.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a potter who brought his pots into a homeowner’s courtyard without permission, and the homeowner’s animal broke</b> the pots, the homeowner is <b>exempt. If</b> the owner’s animal <b>was injured by</b> the pots, <b>the owner of the pots is liable. But if</b> the potter <b>brought</b> them <b>inside with permission, the owner of the courtyard is liable</b> if his animal caused damage to the pots.

### Part 10
Similarly, if someone <b>brought his produce into the homeowner’s courtyard without permission, and the homeowner’s animal ate them,</b> the homeowner is <b>exempt. If</b> his animal was <b>injured by them,</b> e.g., if it slipped on them, <b>the owner of the produce is liable. But if he brought</b> his produce <b>inside with permission, the owner of the courtyard is liable</b> for the damage caused by his animal to them.

### Part 11
Similarly, if one <b>brought his ox into the homeowner’s courtyard without</b>
