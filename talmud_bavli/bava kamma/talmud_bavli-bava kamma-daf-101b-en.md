### Part 1
The Gemara states that <b>Rava raises a contradiction: We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 3:1): <b>A garment that one dyed with</b> dye extracted from <b>peels of <i>orla</i> must be burned. Apparently,</b> the change in <b>appearance</b> precipitated by the <i>orla</i> peels <b>is</b> considered a significant <b>matter,</b> and the dye retains its status as <i>orla</i>. <b>And raise a contradiction</b> from another mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:2): With regard to <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood</b> from a corpse <b>that was absorbed in</b> the floor of <b>a house,</b> every vessel in <b>the house is ritually impure</b> by virtue of being under the same roof as the blood. <b>And some say</b> that any vessel in <b>the house is ritually pure. And</b> these two statements <b>do not disagree,</b> as <b>this</b> first statement was <b>in reference to vessels that were</b> in the house <b>at the outset,</b> before the blood was absorbed; and <b>this</b> second statement was <b>in reference to vessels that came</b> into the house <b>at the end,</b> after the blood had already been absorbed.

### Part 2
The mishna continues: If the blood <b>was absorbed in a garment,</b> it is <b>examined,</b> and <b>if the garment is washed and a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood emerges from it,</b> it <b>is ritually impure,</b> and the garment imparts ritual impurity to the vessels in the house as well. <b>But if not,</b> i.e., if less than a quarter-<i>log</i> of blood emerges, then it <b>is pure,</b> and it does not impart impurity. Apparently, only the blood that can be removed from the garment is considered blood, while the blood absorbed in the garment is insignificant. If this is the case, the change in appearance precipitated by the blood is not considered a significant matter, and the blood absorbed in the garment does not remain an independent substance.

### Part 3
The Gemara presents an answer. <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> A <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> among <b>the leniencies</b> applied to the measurements <b>of a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> was <b>taught here,</b> as the mishna is written <b>in reference to the blood of submission</b> that is discharged from a body at the time of death, and such blood is ritually impure <b>by rabbinic law,</b> but in general, a change in appearance precipitated by blood is significant.

### Part 4
§ Having cited a contradiction raised by Rava, the Gemara proceeds to cite another. <b>Rava raises</b> another <b>contradiction. We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 7:1): Concerning plants <b>from</b> among <b>the species that</b> are used as <b>dyes,</b> for example the <b><i>sefiḥin</i>,</b> i.e., produce that grew without being intentionally planted, <b>of woad and safflower; they have</b> sanctity of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>and money</b> exchanged for <b>them has</b> sanctity of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year. Additionally, <b>they are</b> subject to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>eradication, and money</b> exchanged for <b>them is</b> subject to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>eradication. Apparently, wood,</b> a type of inedible growth, <b>is subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical</b> Year despite the fact that it is not edible.

### Part 5
<b>And raise a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>reed leaves and vine leaves that one piled for storage upon the field,</b> if he <b>gathered them for eating, they are subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical</b> Year; if he gathered them <b>for</b> use as <b>wood,</b> e.g., for kindling a fire, <b>they are not subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical</b> Year. Apparently, wood or any other non-food product is not subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> Rava <b>answers</b> the contradiction, as <b>the verse states:</b> “And the Sabbath produce of the land shall be <b>for food</b> for you” (Leviticus 25:6), indicating that the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year takes effect only <b>with regard to those</b> items <b>whose benefit and whose consumption coincide,</b> as is the case with regard to food. <b>Wood is excluded, as its benefit follows its consumption.</b> The primary purpose of kindling wood is not accomplished with the burning of the wood; rather, it is with the charcoal that heats the oven. Therefore, wood is not subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year.

### Part 7
The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t there wood</b> that is used to provide <b>heat, whose benefit coincides with its consumption,</b> as one enjoys the warmth provided by the fire while the wood is burned?

### Part 8
<b>Rava said:</b>
