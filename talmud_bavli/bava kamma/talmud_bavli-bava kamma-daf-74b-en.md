### Part 1
the slave <b>should go</b> free <b>on account of his eye,</b> and if he <b>knocked out his tooth</b> he <b>should go</b> free <b>on account of his tooth,</b> and if the master both <b>blinded his eye and knocked out his tooth,</b> the slave <b>should go</b> free <b>on account of</b> both <b>his eye and his tooth,</b> without the master having to pay damages for the loss of his tooth.

### Part 2
<b>Abaye said</b> to him in response: <b>With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if a man smites the eye of his slave or the eye of his maidservant and destroys it, he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake” (Exodus 21:26). The phrase <b>“for his eye’s sake”</b> indicates: <b>But not for the sake of</b> both <b>his eye and his tooth.</b> The same can be inferred from the subsequent verse: “And if he smites out his bondman’s tooth or his bondwoman’s tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake” (Exodus 21:27). The phrase <b>“for his tooth’s sake”</b> indicates: <b>But not for the sake of</b> both <b>his eye and his tooth.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara returns to Rava’s opinion that the contradiction of testimony is the start of determining that testimony is conspiring testimony. <b>Rav Idi bar Avin said: We too</b> can <b>learn</b> from the mishna that Rava’s claim is correct, as it teaches (72b): If one <b>stole</b> an ox or a sheep, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>or sold</b> it, also <b>based on</b> the testimony of the same witnesses, <b>and</b> these witnesses <b>were found</b> to be <b>conspiring witnesses,</b> these conspiring witnesses <b>must pay everything,</b> i.e., not only the principal amount but also the fourfold or fivefold payment.

### Part 4
<b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where they testified concerning the theft and then testified concerning the slaughter, and they were</b> subsequently <b>rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the theft and then were rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the slaughter?</b>

### Part 5
Rav Idi bar Avin states his inference: <b>But once they were rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the theft,</b> their testimony <b>with regard to the slaughter</b> is in effect <b>contradicted,</b> i.e., nullified, as testimony concerning the slaughter of an animal without prior testimony establishing that the animal was stolen is meaningless. <b>And</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the witnesses <b>must pay everything. And if it enters your mind</b> that the <b>contradiction</b> of testimony <b>is not the start of determining that</b> testimony is <b>conspiring</b> testimony, <b>why should they pay</b> a fine <b>for</b> lying about the <b>slaughter?</b> Their testimony concerning the slaughter was rendered irrelevant before it was established as conspiring testimony. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> this mishna that the <b>contradiction</b> of testimony <b>is the start of determining that</b> testimony is <b>conspiring</b> testimony?

### Part 6
The Sages <b>say</b> in refutation of this inference: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the witnesses were <b>rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the slaughter first,</b> before they were rendered conspiring witnesses in their testimony concerning the theft itself. In this case, the testimony concerning the slaughter was not rendered irrelevant before it was rendered conspiring testimony.

### Part 7
<b>And</b> this is a matter <b>in the dispute</b> between other <i>amora’im</i>, before Rava and Abaye discussed it. As it was stated: With regard to <b>witnesses</b> to a capital crime <b>who were</b> first <b>contradicted</b> by two other witnesses <b>and ultimately were rendered conspiring witnesses,</b> this is a matter of dispute between <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar. One said:</b> These witnesses <b>are killed,</b> like all conspiring witnesses in a capital case, as the contradiction of testimony is the start of determining that testimony is conspiring testimony, <b>and one said: They are not killed.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara suggests: <b>It may be concluded</b> that <b>it is Rabbi Elazar who says they are not killed. As Rabbi Elazar says: Witnesses who were contradicted in</b> a case involving the taking of <b>a life,</b> i.e., a capital case, <b>are flogged</b> for violating the prohibition: “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor” (Exodus 20:13).

### Part 9
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>it is Rabbi Elazar who says</b> that witnesses to a capital crime who were first contradicted and ultimately found to be conspiring witnesses <b>are killed, why are they flogged</b> in this case? There is always the possibility that they might be rendered conspiring witnesses, which would render them liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment. Consequently, this is a case of <b>a prohibition given as warning</b> of liability <b>for court</b>-imposed <b>capital punishment, and</b> there is a principle that <b>one is not flogged for</b> violating <b>any prohibition given as warning</b> of liability <b>for court</b>-imposed <b>capital punishment.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> this statement that <b>it is Rabbi Elazar who says</b> that witnesses to a capital crime who were first contradicted and ultimately were found to be conspiring witnesses <b>are not killed?</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>It may be concluded</b> that this is so.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Rabbi Elazar’s opinion that witnesses who were contradicted in a capital case are flogged. Why <b>are</b> they <b>flogged</b> simply because their testimony was contradicted? <b>They are two</b> witnesses, <b>and</b> they are contradicted by <b>two</b> other witnesses. <b>What did you see</b> in the testimony of the second set of witnesses <b>that</b> leads <b>you</b> to <b>rely on those</b> witnesses to the extent that the first set of witnesses is flogged? You could just as well <b>rely on these</b> witnesses, i.e., the first witnesses. How can the court ever determine with certainty that a given testimony is false based merely on contradictory testimony?

### Part 12
<b>Abaye said:</b> The contradiction to which Rabbi Elazar is referring involves a case <b>where</b> the witnesses testified that they saw a certain person murdered, and subsequently the individual who was allegedly <b>killed came</b> to the court <b>on his feet,</b> conclusively disproving their testimony.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>stole</b> an ox or a sheep, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>slaughtered or sold</b> the stolen animal, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness or based on his own</b> admission, i.e., he himself admitted that he performed these acts, without there being any witness testimony, <b>he pays</b> the <b>double payment, but he does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>

### Part 14
If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it <b>on Shabbat,</b> which is a capital offense, or if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it <b>for the</b> purpose of <b>idol worship,</b> or if <b>he stole his father’s</b> animal <b>and</b> subsequently <b>his father died, and afterward he slaughtered or sold</b> it, or if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and</b> subsequently <b>he consecrated</b> it as an offering <b>and afterward he slaughtered or sold</b> it, in all these cases the thief <b>pays</b> the <b>double payment, but he does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In the case of <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>for which</b> the owner <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> to replace with another animal if one of the original animals that one stole is lost or dies, the thief is obligated to <b>pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment</b> if he slaughters one of the animals. If it is a sacrificial animal <b>for which</b> the owner <b>bears no</b> financial <b>responsibility,</b> the thief <b>is exempt</b> from the fourfold or fivefold payment.

### Part 16
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if the fact that the thief slaughtered or sold the animal was established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness,</b> he is exempt from the fourfold of fivefold payment. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b>

### Part 17
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: By stating this case, the mishna <b>teaches us this</b> <i>halakha</i>: The case of the thief slaughtering the animal established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness is similar to</b> a case where it is established <b>based on his own</b> admission. <b>Just as</b> in the case where the slaughter is established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness, if one</b> other <b>witness comes</b> and corroborates the testimony of the first, he <b>joins together with</b> the first witness and together their testimony is rendered a valid testimony of two, and the thief <b>becomes obligated</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, <b>so too,</b> where the slaughter is established <b>based on his own</b> admission, <b>if witnesses come</b> after his admission he <b>becomes obligated</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.

### Part 18
The Gemara comments: This interpretation of the mishna serves <b>to exclude</b> that <b>which Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav says. As Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> One who <b>admits</b> he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is exempt</b> from payment, even if <b>afterward witnesses come</b> and testify to his liability.

### Part 19
Since Rav Huna’s <i>halakha</i> was mentioned, the Gemara discusses in detail <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> One who <b>admits</b> he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is exempt</b> from payment, even if <b>afterward witnesses come</b> and testify to his liability. <b>Rav Ḥisda raised an objection to Rav Huna</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving Rabban Gamliel, who blinded the eye of his</b> Canaanite <b>slave Tavi, and he experienced great joy</b> as a result. Rabban Gamliel had long wanted to emancipate Tavi, but it is generally prohibited to emancipate a Canaanite slave. The injury provided a fortuitous opportunity for Rabban Gamliel to emancipate his slave, as blinding the eye of one’s slave results in his emancipation (see Exodus 21:27).

### Part 20
Rabban Gamliel <b>encountered Rabbi Yehoshua</b> and <b>said to him: Do you know that my slave Tavi was emancipated?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: Why?</b> What circumstances enabled you to emancipate him? Rabban Gamliel <b>said to him:</b> I was able to do so, <b>as I blinded his eye.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to</b> Rabban Gamliel: <b>Your statement is nothing,</b> and is not grounds for his emancipation, <b>as he has no witnesses</b> who can testify that you did this to him. The principle is that one does not pay a fine based on his own admission. One pays a fine only based on the testimony of witnesses. The requirement to emancipate one’s slave after injuring his eye is a type of fine.

### Part 21
The Gemara infers from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But</b> if Tavi <b>had witnesses</b> who could testify with regard to the injury, Rabban Gamliel would be <b>obligated</b> to emancipate him, even if they testify after Rabban Gamliel’s admission. <b>And we</b> can <b>learn from</b> this that one who <b>admits</b> that he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is liable,</b> even if <b>afterward witnesses come</b> and testify with regard to his liability.

### Part 22
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: This case involving <b>Rabban Gamliel is different, as he admitted</b> to his actions when he was <b>not in the presence of a court.</b> An admission not in the presence of a court does not exempt the perpetrator from paying the relevant fine. The Gemara challenges: <b>But Rabbi Yehoshua was the president of the court,</b> so it is likely that the encounter took place in court.
