### Part 1
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And a butcher may buy</b> small domesticated animals <b>and slaughter</b> them, and again <b>buy</b> small domesticated animals <b>and keep</b> them for a while, <b>provided that he does not keep the last one of them</b> that he bought beyond <b>thirty days.</b>

### Part 2
<b>His students asked Rabban Gamliel: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to raising</b> small domesticated animals in Eretz Yisrael? Rabban Gamliel <b>said to them: It is permitted.</b> The Gemara interrupts its citation of the <i>baraita</i> to pose a question: How could Rabban Gamliel say this? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>One may not raise</b> small domesticated animals in Eretz Yisrael?

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> the text of the <i>baraita</i> must be emended, and <b>they</b> actually <b>raised this dilemma before him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to keeping</b> them for a while? The Gemara resumes the quotation of the <i>baraita</i>: Rabban Gamliel <b>said to them:</b> It is <b>permitted, provided that</b> the animal <b>does not go out and graze among the flock. Rather,</b> one should <b>tie it to the legs of the bed</b> in his house.

### Part 4
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving a certain pious man who was groaning,</b> i.e., suffering, <b>due to</b> a pain in <b>his heart.</b> Those caring for the man <b>asked the physicians</b> what to do for him, <b>and they said: There is no other remedy for him but that he should suckle warm milk every morning. And they brought him a she-goat and tied it to the leg of the bed for him, and he would suckle</b> milk <b>from it every morning.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Days later, his friends came in to visit him. When they saw that she-goat tied to the legs of the bed, they turned back, saying:</b> There is <b>an armed bandit in this</b> man’s <b>house, and we are going in to</b> visit <b>him?</b> They referred to the goat in this manner because small animals habitually graze on the vegetation of others, thereby stealing their crops.

### Part 6
His friends <b>sat down and investigated</b> this pious man’s behavior, <b>and they could not find</b> any sin attributable <b>to him except that sin of</b> keeping <b>that she-goat</b> in his house. That man <b>himself also said at the time of his death: I know</b> for a fact <b>that I have no sin</b> attributable <b>to me except</b> the <b>sin of</b> keeping <b>that she-goat</b> in my house, <b>as I transgressed the statement of my colleagues,</b> the Sages.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yishmael said:</b> The members of my <b>father’s family were among the wealthy property holders in the upper Galilee. And for what reason were they destroyed?</b> It was due to the fact <b>that they would graze</b> flocks <b>in the forests, and</b> also because they would <b>judge</b> cases of <b>monetary law by</b> means of <b>a single</b> judge. <b>And even though there were forests close to their houses,</b> and therefore there should have been no problem for them to take their animals to graze in these forests, <b>there was a small,</b> private <b>field and they would convey</b> the animals on <b>a path through it.</b>

### Part 8
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there is <b>a shepherd</b> of small domesticated animals <b>who repented,</b> the court <b>does not obligate him to sell</b> all his animals <b>immediately. Rather, he may sell</b> them <b>gradually. And likewise,</b> in the case of <b>a convert who came into</b> possession of <b>dogs and pigs</b> (see 83a) <b>as</b> part of <b>his inheritance,</b> the court <b>does not obligate him to sell</b> all of them <b>immediately. Rather, he may sell</b> them <b>gradually.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>one who vowed to purchase a house or to marry a woman in Eretz Yisrael,</b> the court <b>does not obligate him to acquire</b> the first house or marry the first woman he sees <b>immediately</b> upon his arrival in Eretz Yisrael. Instead, he may wait <b>until he finds</b> the house or wife <b>appropriate for him.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And</b> there was <b>an incident involving a certain</b> unmarried <b>woman who had a son who was distressing her, and she jumped up and took an oath</b> impulsively: <b>Any</b> man <b>who comes</b> to marry me and will discipline my son, <b>I will not turn him away. And unworthy men jumped at</b> the opportunity to marry <b>her. And when the matter came before the Sages, they said:</b> She need not marry one of these men, as <b>this</b> woman’s <b>intention</b> in her oath was certainly <b>to</b> marry <b>only</b> a man <b>who is appropriate for her.</b>

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Just as</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one may not raise small domesticated animals,</b> i.e., sheep and goats, <b>so</b> too <b>they said</b> that <b>one may not raise small undomesticated animals. Rabbi Yishmael says: One may raise village dogs, cats, monkeys, and genets, because they serve to clean the house</b> of mice and other vermin.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> these <b>genets? Rav Yehuda said:</b> These are known in Aramaic as <b><i>shartza ḥartza</i>. And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that in Aramaic this animal is called <b><i>ḥarza</i>.</b> This creature <b>has short thighs and it grazes among the thorn bushes. And what</b> is the reason that they are called <b><i>shartza</i>,</b> a term that generally refers to creeping creatures that slither [<i>shoretz</i>] rather than walk? It is <b>because its thighs are</b> so <b>short</b> that it appears to slither instead of walking on legs.

### Part 13
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: We in Babylonia have rendered ourselves like</b> the residents of <b>Eretz Yisrael</b> with regard <b>to</b> the prohibition of the Sages against raising <b>small domesticated animals. Rav Adda bar Ahava said to Rav Huna: What of your</b> sheep and goats? How can you raise these animals in Babylonia?

### Part 14
Rav Huna <b>said to him: Ḥova,</b> my wife, <b>watches</b> the animals to ensure that they do not graze on land belonging to others. Rav Adda bar Ahava cursed Rav Huna and <b>said to him: May Ḥova bury her son!</b> In <b>all the years of Rav Adda bar Ahava, no children of Rav Huna from Ḥova survived,</b> due to this curse. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of the above statement: <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: We in Babylonia rendered ourselves like</b> those of <b>Eretz Yisrael</b> with regard <b>to</b> raising <b>small domesticated animals, from</b> the time <b>when Rav came to Babylonia.</b>

### Part 15
§ <b>Rav and Shmuel and Rav Asi</b> once <b>happened to be</b> present <b>at a house</b> where a celebration was being held marking the passage <b>of a week of</b> a newborn <b>son,</b> i.e., a circumcision. <b>And some say it was a house</b> where a celebration was being held marking the <b>redemption of</b> a firstborn <b>son. Rav</b> would <b>not enter before Shmuel,</b> for reasons the Gemara will explain;
