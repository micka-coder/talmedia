<b>residue from dates?</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> acted <b>in accordance with his halakhic</b> opinion that this is the <i>halakha</i>, and a public ruling is issued to that effect. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>Rav Huna, shall we say</b> that <b>he retracted</b> his prior opinion?

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>Those</b> owners of the barley <b>were forewarned</b> to remove the barley from the public domain, and they did not comply. Therefore, they were penalized by Rav Huna declaring publicly that their barley was ownerless.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>two potters</b> carrying pots <b>who were walking one after the other</b> in the public domain, <b>and the first stumbled</b> on a bump <b>and fell, and the second stumbled over the first</b> and fell too, <b>the first</b> is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for the damage incurred by the second.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Do not say that the mishna is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that <b>one who stumbles is</b> considered <b>negligent and</b> therefore <b>liable. Rather, even</b> according <b>to the Rabbis, who say</b> that one who stumbles <b>is</b> generally <b>a victim of circumstances beyond his control and is</b> consequently <b>exempt, here,</b> in the case in the mishna, he is <b>liable, since</b> after falling <b>he had</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up, <b>and he did not stand</b> up.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that <b>he did not have</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up, <b>he had</b> the opportunity <b>to warn</b> the person behind him, <b>and he did not warn</b> him.

### Part 7
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said</b> in response that <b>since he did not have</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up, <b>he did not have</b> the opportunity <b>to warn</b> the other person either, <b>as he was busy</b> trying to stand up. Therefore, the mishna, which holds him liable, must be referring to a case where he could have stood up.

### Part 8
The Gemara attempts to prove that the opinion of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak is correct. <b>We learned</b> in the next mishna (31b): If <b>the owner of</b> a cross <b>beam was</b> walking in the public domain carrying his beam <b>first, and the owner of a barrel was</b> walking with his barrel <b>last,</b> i.e., behind him, and <b>the barrel was broken by the</b> cross <b>beam,</b> the one who carried the cross beam is <b>exempt. But if the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam stopped,</b> he is <b>liable,</b> since the accident was caused by his stopping.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a situation <b>where</b> the one carrying the cross beam <b>stopped</b> in order <b>to adjust</b> the load <b>on his shoulder, which is the normative behavior of</b> one carrying a beam, and is not considered negligence? <b>And</b> nevertheless the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that he is <b>liable,</b> as, although <b>he had</b> the opportunity <b>to warn</b> the person behind him that he was about to stop, he did not warn him. This supports the opinion of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak.

### Part 10
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is referring to a situation <b>where he stopped to rest,</b> which could not have been anticipated by the person walking behind him. Consequently, he is liable.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this interpretation, if <b>he stop-ped to adjust</b> the load <b>on his shoulder, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is he <b>exempt?</b> If so, <b>rather than teaching</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of that mishna: <b>But if he said to the owner of the barrel: Stop,</b> he is <b>exempt, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>distinguish and teach within</b> the former case <b>itself,</b> as follows: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that he is liable, <b>said?</b> In a case <b>when he stopped to rest. But</b> in a case where <b>he stopped to adjust</b> the load <b>on his shoulder,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: The mishna is presented in <b>this</b> manner because it <b>teaches us this</b> novelty, <b>that even if he stopped to rest,</b> in a case <b>when he says to the owner of the barrel: Stop,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an alternative proof from what is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>potters and glaziers who were walking one after the other,</b> and <b>the first stumbled and fell, and the second stumbled over the first,</b> sustaining damage, <b>and the third</b> stumbled <b>over the second,</b> also falling and sustaining damage, in this case, <b>the first</b> person is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for the damage of the second, and the second</b> is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for the damage of the third. But if they</b> all <b>fell because of the first, the first</b> is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for the damage of them all. And if they warned each other,</b> i.e., each one warned the next, <b>they are</b> all <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>What, is it not</b> a case <b>where they did not have</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up, and they are nevertheless liable to pay for not warning the people behind them, in accordance with the opinion of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak?

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is a case <b>where they had</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up and they did not do so.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this interpretation, if <b>they did not have</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up, <b>what</b> would be the <i>halakha</i>? Would they be <b>exempt? If so, rather than teaching</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>If they warned one another, they are exempt, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>distinguish and teach within</b> the former case <b>itself,</b> as follows: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that they are liable, <b>said?</b> It is a case <b>where they had</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up, <b>but</b> if <b>they did not have</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up, <b>they are exempt.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is presented in <b>this</b> manner because it <b>teaches us this</b> novelty, <b>that even if they had</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up, in a case <b>when they warned each other they are exempt.</b>

### Part 17
§ With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>Rava said: The first</b> one who stumbled is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for the damage of the second, both for damage caused</b> to the second person <b>by his body and for damage caused</b> to him <b>by his property.</b> By contrast, <b>the second</b> is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for the damage of the third</b> only <b>with regard to damage caused by his body</b> as result of the fall, <b>and not with regard to damage caused by his property.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara questions Rava’s statement: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, this is difficult to understand. <b>If</b> Rava maintains that <b>one who stumbles is</b> considered <b>negligent, the second</b> person <b>should also be liable</b> to pay for all forms of damage caused by his negligence. And <b>if</b> Rava maintains that <b>one who stumbles is not</b> considered <b>negligent, even the first should be exempt</b> from liability for the damage incurred by the second.
