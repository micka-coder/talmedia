### Part 1
Rav <b>said to</b> Rabbi Elazar in response: <b>The Torah granted the father only the profits of</b> her <b>youth</b> and nothing else. Therefore, compensation for the injury goes to the daughter. Rabbi Elazar <b>raised an objection to</b> Rav’s statement based on the mishna: <b>One who injures a Hebrew slave</b> is <b>liable for all of</b> the five types of indemnity. This is <b>except for</b> compensation for <b>loss of livelihood</b> occurring <b>during the time that</b> the injured slave <b>belongs to</b> the one that injured him. This should be the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a minor daughter as well, that since the father has the right to the earnings of his minor daughter, he should receive the compensation for her loss of livelihood. <b>Abaye said</b> in response: <b>Rav concedes with regard to</b> compensation for her <b>loss of livelihood</b> that it is paid to the father, <b>since her earnings belong to her father until the time of</b> her <b>adulthood,</b> and therefore her inability to work is her father’s loss.

### Part 2
Rabbi Elazar <b>raised an objection to</b> Rav’s statement based on a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who injures his adult son</b> must <b>give him</b> his compensation <b>immediately.</b> If one injured <b>his minor son he</b> must <b>make a safe investment [<i>segulla</i>] for him</b> with the compensation money. <b>One who injures his minor daughter</b> is <b>exempt, and moreover,</b> if there were <b>others who injured her,</b> they are <b>liable to give</b> compensation <b>to her father.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>So too</b> here, the <i>baraita</i> is speaking <b>with regard to</b> the daughter’s <b>loss of livelihood</b> alone, which is paid to the father. The other types of indemnity are paid to the daughter.

### Part 3
The Gemara questions the first ruling of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> is it so that if a father injured <b>his adult son he</b> must <b>give him</b> his compensation <b>immediately? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from that which is taught in another <i>baraita</i>: In a case of <b>one who injures the sons or daughters of others,</b> if they are <b>adults he</b> must <b>give them</b> their compensation <b>immediately;</b> if they are <b>minors he</b> must <b>make a safe investment for them.</b> If one injures <b>his own sons or daughters,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying them compensation.

### Part 4
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> states that the father is exempt, it is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the children <b>are dependent on</b> their father’s <b>table</b> for support. <b>There,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> states that the father is liable, it is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the children <b>are not dependent on his table.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara challenges this resolution of the two <i>baraitot</i>: <b>In what</b> manner <b>did you interpret the first</b> <i>baraita</i>? You interpreted it as dealing with a case <b>where</b> the children <b>are not dependent on his table? If so, say the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who injures his minor daughter</b> is <b>exempt, and moreover,</b> if there were <b>others who injured her,</b> they are <b>liable to give</b> compensation <b>to her father.</b> If this is a case where the daughter is not dependent upon her father for support, then the one who injured her would be <b>required to give</b> the compensation <b>to her, because she needs</b> to provide her own <b>sustenance.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara continues its challenge. <b>And even according to the one who says</b> that <b>a master can say to</b> his <b>slave: Work for me but I will not feed you,</b> i.e., a master is not legally obligated to provide sustenance for his slave, <b>this matter applies</b> only <b>to a Canaanite slave, as</b> the master can <b>say to him: Work</b> for me <b>the entire day, and at night go around,</b> beg, <b>and eat. But</b> in the case of <b>a Hebrew slave, as it is written</b> with regard to him: <b>“Because he fares well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16), indicating that the Hebrew slave must be <b>“with you” in food</b> and <b>“with you” in drink,</b> i.e., the Hebrew slave is entitled to live with his master as an equal, the master may <b>not</b> compel the slave to serve him unless he feeds him. <b>All the more so</b> is it not the case with regard to <b>his daughter,</b> that she is not required to beg for her sustenance and should receive the compensation herself?

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: This is <b>as Rava, son of Rav Ulla, said</b> concerning a similar matter (<i>Ketubot</i> 43a): This <i>halakha</i> is <b>necessary only for</b> the <b>surplus,</b> i.e., money that a woman earns beyond what she needs for her essential sustenance. <b>Here too,</b> this <i>halakha</i> is <b>necessary only for</b> the <b>surplus.</b> If the compensation for injury is more than the daughter requires for her sustenance, the additional sum is paid to her father.

### Part 8
The Gemara again challenges the resolution of the two <i>baraitot</i>: <b>In what</b> manner <b>did you interpret the latter</b> <i>baraita</i> discussing one who injures the children of another? You interpreted it as dealing with a case <b>where</b> the sons <b>are dependent on</b> their father’s <b>table.</b> But the <i>baraita</i> also stated: If they are <b>adults, he</b> must <b>give them</b> their compensation <b>immediately;</b> if they are <b>minors, he</b> must <b>make a safe investment for them. Why</b> does he make a safe investment for them? Shouldn’t he be <b>required to give</b> the compensation <b>to their father?</b>

### Part 9
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>Where</b> the father <b>is particular</b> about receiving money that would go to his child is specifically <b>in a matter that causes</b> him <b>a loss,</b> as in a case where the father himself injured his child and would need to pay compensation. But <b>in a matter that comes from elsewhere,</b> as in a case where someone else injured his child, he <b>is not particular</b> about receiving the money, and it is paid to the child.

### Part 10
The Gemara challenges that response: <b>But</b> isn’t <b>a found</b> item a matter <b>that comes to</b> the children <b>from elsewhere, and</b> the father <b>is particular</b> about receiving it? The Sages <b>say</b> in response: With regard to <b>profit that comes to</b> the children <b>from elsewhere, and they do not</b> suffer <b>physical pain in</b> obtaining <b>it,</b> the father <b>is particular</b> about receiving the money, as he does not feel that the children deserve it. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>an injury, where they</b> suffer <b>physical pain and it comes to them from elsewhere,</b> the father <b>is not particular</b> about receiving the compensation paid to his child.

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges: <b>But there,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, isn’t it discussing a case <b>where</b> the daughter suffers <b>physical pain, and</b> it is a matter that <b>comes to her from elsewhere, and</b> the father <b>is particular</b> about receiving the money, <b>as it teaches: And moreover,</b> if there were <b>others who injured her,</b> they are <b>liable to give</b> compensation <b>to her father?</b>

### Part 12
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> discusses a case <b>where</b> the father <b>is a captious man,</b> which is evident from the case of the <i>baraita</i> itself, <b>as</b> his children <b>are not dependent on his table.</b> A man like this <b>is particular even about matters that come to them from elsewhere.</b> By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the latter <i>baraita</i>, it discusses a case <b>where</b> the father <b>is not a captious man,</b> which is evident from the case of the <i>baraita</i> itself, <b>as</b> his children <b>are dependent on his table. When he is particular</b> about receiving the money, it is <b>in a matter that causes him a loss,</b> but <b>in a matter that comes to them from elsewhere,</b> he <b>is not particular.</b>

### Part 13
The two <i>baraitot</i> stated that the father makes a safe investment for his minor children with the compensation paid to them. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>a safe investment? Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The father should purchase <b>a Torah scroll</b> for his child. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna, says:</b> The father should purchase <b>a date palm, from which</b> the child <b>will consume dates.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara comments that the <i>amora’im</i> of Eretz Yisrael discussed the same issue as did those in Babylonia. <b>And so says Reish Lakish: The Torah granted the father only the profits of</b> her <b>youth,</b> and nothing else. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The father receives <b>even</b> the compensation for his daughter’s <b>wound.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara objects: Does it <b>enter your mind</b> that the father receives compensation for his daughter’s <b>wound,</b> which, unlike an injury, does not diminish his daughter’s value? <b>Even Rabbi Elazar raised his dilemma only</b> with regard to <b>an injury,</b>
