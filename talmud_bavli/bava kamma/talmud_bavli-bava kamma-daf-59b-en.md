### Part 1
<b>was wearing black shoes,</b> unlike the Jewish custom of that time, <b>and standing in the market of Neharde’a.</b> Officials <b>of the house of the Exilarch found him and said to him: What is different</b> about you that causes you to wear <b>these shoes? He said to them:</b> I am wearing them <b>because I am in mourning over</b> the destruction of the Temple and <b>Jerusalem,</b> and so I wear black shoes, as is the custom of mourners. <b>They said to him: Are you</b> a man of such <b>importance to</b> publicly <b>mourn over Jerusalem? They thought that it was</b> simply <b>presumptuousness</b> on his part. Since he was acting against the prevalent Jewish custom, <b>they brought him</b> to the prison <b>and incarcerated him.</b>

### Part 2
Eliezer Ze’eira <b>said to them: I am a great man,</b> a scholar, and it is fitting for me to mourn publicly over the destruction of Jerusalem. <b>They said to him: How do we know</b> that you are a scholar? <b>He said to them: Either you ask of me a matter</b> of <i>halakha</i> and I will answer you, <b>or I will ask you a matter</b> of <i>halakha</i> and you will answer me. <b>They said to him: You ask.</b>

### Part 3
<b>He said to them:</b> With regard to <b>one who cuts</b> a cluster of flowers on <b>the stem</b> of a date palm belonging to another, <b>what</b> is he required to <b>pay? They said to him: He pays the value of the</b> date <b>stem.</b> He said to them: <b>But</b> ultimately <b>they will become</b> ripe <b>dates,</b> which are worth more. <b>They said to him:</b> If so, <b>he pays the value of</b> the future <b>dates. He said to them: But he did not take</b> ripe <b>dates from</b> the other person, so how can the court obligate him to pay for damage that he did not cause?

### Part 4
<b>They said to</b> Eliezer Ze’eira: <b>You tell us</b> the correct appraisal for the date stem. <b>He said to them:</b> The court appraises the damage relative to a similar piece of land <b>sixty</b> times the size. <b>They said to him: Who says</b> an opinion <b>as you</b> do, so that you can prove you are correct? <b>He said to them: Shmuel is alive and his court exists;</b> you can ask him. <b>They sent</b> the question <b>before Shmuel,</b> together with the ruling of Eliezer Ze’eira. Shmuel <b>said to them: He is saying well to you,</b> because the <i>halakha</i> is as he says; the appraisal is <b>relative to</b> an area <b>sixty</b> times greater. Upon hearing this, the officials of the Exilarch realized that he was a great man <b>and they released him.</b>

### Part 5
§ The mishna (55b) teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> If the animal <b>ate ripe produce,</b> the owner pays the value of the ripe produce eaten. <b>What is the reason</b> for Rabbi Shimon’s opinion? <b>This that the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And it feed in another’s field”</b> (Exodus 22:4), which <b>teaches that</b> the court <b>appraises</b> the damage <b>relative to</b> another <b>field, this statement</b> applies specifically with regard to <b>produce</b> that <b>requires a field</b> to grow. For one’s animal eating this <b>produce, which do not require the field</b> in order to ripen further, the animal’s owner <b>must pay</b> their value <b>as they are.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says: Rav judged</b> a practical <i>halakha</i> on a certain issue <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> despite the fact that in general the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with his opinion. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>he ruled</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> even though in that case his was a minority opinion.

### Part 7
Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya explains: <b>Rav judged</b> a practical <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a field designated by its owner as a lien for his wife’s marriage contract, which he subsequently wants to sell, if <b>he wrote</b> a document of sale <b>to a first</b> buyer, <b>but</b> his wife <b>did not sign for him</b> to endorse the sale, and subsequently the husband wrote a document of sale <b>to a second</b> buyer, <b>and</b> his wife <b>signed for him, she</b> thereby <b>loses</b> the lien of <b>her marriage contract,</b> since the sale is effective and she can no longer collect from this field; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>she can say: I did</b> it only to <b>please my husband,</b> but I did not mean it and never intended to forgo my rights. <b>What</b> claim <b>do you,</b> the purchasers, <b>have against me?</b> Therefore, the lien is still in effect. Rav judged a case in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir.

### Part 8
<b>And</b> Rav <b>ruled</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> If one’s animal <b>ate ripe produce,</b> the owner <b>pays</b> the value of <b>ripe produce</b> eaten. Therefore, <b>if</b> it ate <b>one <i>se’a</i></b> of produce, he pays the value of <b>one <i>se’a</i></b> of produce, and <b>if</b> it ate <b>two <i>se’a</i>,</b> he pays for <b>two <i>se’a</i>.</b> Although Rabbi Shimon’s opinion is the minority one, Rav ruled in accordance with it.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <b>one who stacks</b> his produce <b>in another’s field without permission</b> from the owner of that field, <b>and an animal belonging to the owner of the field eats</b> the produce, the owner of the field is <b>exempt. And if</b> the animal <b>is injured by</b> the produce, <b>the owner of the stack</b> is <b>liable. But if he stacked</b> them in that field <b>with permission, the owner of the field</b> is <b>liable</b> for damage caused to the produce.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>that which we learned</b> in the mishna <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>As, if</b> the mishna were <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>doesn’t he say:</b> A homeowner who gives another permission to bring items into his courtyard is not responsible for them <b>unless the homeowner accepts on himself to safeguard</b> them? The mishna does not mention any such acceptance of responsibility. <b>Rav Pappa said: Here we are dealing with the supervisor of the threshing floors,</b> to whom people would entrust their produce. <b>As, since the supervisor says</b> to the owner of the produce: <b>Bring</b> it <b>in and stack</b> it, it is as though he had said to him: <b>Bring</b> it <b>in and I will supervise</b> it <b>for you.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who sends a fire,</b> i.e., places a burning object, <b>in the hand of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor</b> is <b>exempt</b> for any damage later caused by the fire <b>according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven.</b> If <b>he sent</b> it <b>in the hand of a</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> person, <b>the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> person is <b>liable,</b> not the one who sent him.

### Part 12
If <b>one</b> person <b>brought the fire, and one</b> other person subsequently <b>brought the wood,</b> causing the fire to spread, <b>the one who brought the wood</b> is <b>liable</b> for any damage caused. Conversely, if <b>one</b> person first <b>brought the wood, and</b> subsequently <b>one</b> other person <b>brought the fire, the one who brought the fire</b> is <b>liable,</b> since it was he who actually kindled the wood.

### Part 13
If <b>another came and fanned</b> the flame, and as a result the fire spread and caused damage, <b>the one who fanned it</b> is <b>liable,</b> since he is the proximate cause of the damage. If <b>the wind fanned</b> the flames, <b>all</b> the people involved are <b>exempt,</b> since none of them actually caused the damage.

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Reish Lakish says in the name of Ḥizkiyya: They taught</b> that one who sends fire in the hand of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor is exempt <b>only when he conveyed to him</b> a glowing <b>coal and</b> one of these people <b>fanned</b> it himself and set it alight. <b>But</b> if one <b>conveyed a torch to</b> a deaf-mute, imbecile, or minor, the one who gave it to him is <b>liable. What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? <b>The action</b> of the one who gave it to him directly <b>caused</b> the fire to spread.

### Part 15
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even</b> if <b>he conveyed a torch to him,</b> he is <b>exempt. What is the reason?</b> It is the <b>tongs of the deaf-mute that caused</b> the damage, since torches do not cause fires on their own. <b>And</b> the one who gives dangerous objects to a deaf-mute is <b>not rendered liable</b> for the damage caused, <b>unless he conveys branches [<i>gavza</i>] to him</b>
