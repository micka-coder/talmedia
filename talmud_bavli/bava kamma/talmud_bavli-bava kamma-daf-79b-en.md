### Part 1
it is speaking of <b>the rental of movable property, is movable property</b> subject to the writing of <b>a deed?</b> Rather, <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is referring to <b>the rental of land.</b>

### Part 2
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> If people <b>saw</b> a thief <b>who was hiding in the woods</b> near a herd of grazing animals, <b>and</b> that individual emerged and <b>slaughtered or sold</b> one of the animals from the herd, <b>he pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is the thief liable to the fourfold or fivefold payment? <b>But he did not pull</b> the animal. Rabbi Elazar is apparently describing a case where the thief emerged from the forest and slaughtered one of the animals without first moving it, and there is no fourfold or fivefold payment unless the thief first steals the animal. <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where he hit</b> the animal <b>with a stick,</b> causing it to move.

### Part 3
With regard to Rabbi Elazar’s statement, the Sages <b>say: But since</b> people <b>saw him</b> doing all this, <b>he is a robber,</b> not a thief, and the fourfold or fivefold payment applies only to thieves. A thief is one who sneaks into a house or other private property; one who commits his act brazenly, in public, is classified as a robber. The Gemara answers: <b>Since he was hiding from them, he is</b> considered <b>a thief,</b> despite the fact that they saw him.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But if so, what are the circumstances</b> of a <b>robber? Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> Robbers are <b>like</b> the case of <b>Benaiah ben Jehoiada, as it is stated</b> concerning him: “He slew an Egyptian, a goodly man; and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, <b>and he robbed the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear”</b> (II Samuel 23:21).

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> A different example of a robber is a case <b>like</b> that of <b>the men of Shechem, as it is stated: “And the men of Shechem set ambushers for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them”</b> (Judges 9:25).

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu did not say</b> the example <b>from this</b> verse, which discusses the men of Shechem? He could have <b>said to you: Since</b> the men of Shechem <b>were hiding</b> in ambush, <b>they are not</b> considered <b>robbers</b> but thieves. <b>And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> respond to this claim? <b>This</b> fact <b>that they were hiding</b> was not because they were hesitant to steal in view of the public. Rather, they acted in this manner <b>so that</b> the travelers <b>should not see them</b> in advance <b>and flee from them.</b>

### Part 7
§ The Gemara concludes its discussion of theft with several aggadic statements. <b>His students asked Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: For what reason was the Torah stricter with a thief than with a robber?</b> Only a thief is required to pay the double, fourfold, or fivefold payment, not a robber. Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to them</b> in response: <b>This one,</b> the robber, <b>equated the honor of</b> the <b>servant to the honor of his Master, and that one,</b> the thief, <b>did not equate the honor of</b> the <b>servant to the honor of his Master.</b> The robber fears neither God nor people, as he is not afraid to rob in public. The thief does not fear God but he does fear other people, which demonstrates that he is more concerned about humans than God.

### Part 8
<b>As it were,</b> the thief <b>establishes the eye below,</b> i.e., God’s eye, <b>as though it does not see, and the ear below,</b> i.e., God’s ear, <b>as though it does not hear.</b> The Gemara cites verses that describe people who imagine that God does not see their actions, <b>as it is stated: “Woe to them who seek deeply to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark,</b> and they say: Who sees us, and who knows us?” (Isaiah 29:15). <b>And it is written: “And they say: The Lord will not see, neither will the God of Jacob give heed”</b> (Psalms 94:7). <b>And it is written: “For they say: The Lord has forsaken the land, and the Lord does not see”</b> (Ezekiel 9:9).

### Part 9
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir said:</b> To illustrate the severity of a thief over a robber, as per Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai’s explanation, <b>they stated a parable in the name of Rabban Gamliel. To what is this matter comparable? To two people who were</b> living <b>in the</b> same <b>city, and</b> both of them <b>prepared a feast. One</b> of them <b>invited the people of the city</b> to his feast <b>but he did not invite the king’s sons. And</b> the other <b>did not invite the people of the city and</b> also <b>did not invite the king’s sons. Which of them</b> deserves <b>a greater punishment? You must say</b> that it is <b>this one who invited the people of the city but did not invite the king’s sons.</b> Likewise, both the thief and the robber show disdain for God, but the robber does not display more respect for people.

### Part 10
The Gemara discusses why there is a fourfold payment for a sheep but a fivefold payment for an ox. <b>Rabbi Meir said: Come and see how great the power of labor is.</b> The theft of <b>an ox, which</b> was forced <b>by</b> the thief <b>to cease its labor,</b> leads to <b>a fivefold</b> payment; whereas the theft of <b>a sheep, which</b> was <b>not</b> forced <b>by</b> the thief <b>to cease its labor,</b> as a sheep performs no labor, leads to only <b>a fourfold</b> payment.

### Part 11
<b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said: Come and see how great human dignity is.</b> The theft of <b>an ox, which walked on its own legs</b> as the thief stole it, leads to <b>a fivefold</b> payment, whereas the theft of <b>a sheep, which</b> the thief <b>carried on his shoulder</b> as he walked, thereby causing himself embarrassment, leads to only <b>a fourfold</b> payment.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not raise small domesticated animals,</b> i.e., sheep and goats, <b>in</b> settled areas of <b>Eretz Yisrael,</b> as they graze on people’s crops. <b>But one may raise</b> them <b>in Syria,</b> despite the fact that with regard to many other <i>halakhot</i> Syria is treated like Eretz Yisrael, <b>and in the wilderness of Eretz Yisrael.</b>

### Part 13
<b>One may not raise chickens in Jerusalem, due to the sacrificial meat</b> that is common there. There is a concern that chickens will pick up garbage that imparts ritual impurity and bring it into contact with sacrificial meat, thereby rendering it ritually impure. <b>And priests may not</b> raise chickens anywhere <b>in Eretz Yisrael, because of the</b> many foods in a priest’s possession that must be kept <b>ritually pure,</b> e.g., <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 14
Furthermore, <b>one may not raise pigs anywhere,</b> and <b>a person may not raise a dog unless it is tied with chains. One may spread out traps [<i>nishovim</i>] for pigeons only if</b> this was performed <b>at a distance of</b> at least <b>thirty <i>ris</i>,</b> which is 8,000 cubits, <b>from</b> any <b>settled area,</b> to ensure that privately owned pigeons are not caught in the traps.

### Part 15
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not raise small domesticated animals,</b> i.e., sheep and goats, <b>in</b> settled areas of <b>Eretz Yisrael. But one may raise</b> them <b>in the forests of Eretz Yisrael. In Syria,</b> it is permitted to do so <b>even in a settled area. And, needless to say,</b> it is permitted to do so <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.

### Part 16
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not raise small domesticated animals in</b> settled areas of <b>Eretz Yisrael. But one may raise</b> them <b>in the wilderness that is in Judea and in the wilderness that is on the border near Akko. And even though</b> the Sages <b>said that one may not raise small domesticated animals, nevertheless, one may raise large, domesticated animals,</b> i.e., cattle, <b>because</b> the Sages <b>issue a decree upon the public only if a majority of the public is able to abide by it.</b>

### Part 17
This difference is that it is <b>possible</b> for someone <b>to bring small domesticated animals from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael in the event that they are needed. But it is <b>not possible</b> for someone <b>to bring large, domesticated animals from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael whenever he needs one, since there is a constant need for them as beasts of burden. Therefore, the Sages did not issue a decree with regard to these types of animals.

### Part 18
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And even though they said that one may not raise small domesticated animals, however, one may keep</b> these animals on his premises for <b>thirty days before a pilgrimage Festival, and thirty days before the</b> wedding <b>feast of one’s son,</b> when many animals are needed for food, <b>provided that he does not leave the last</b> one, i.e., the animal which he purchased immediately before the Festival, for <b>thirty days.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara clarifies the final line of the <i>baraita</i>: The <i>baraita</i> needs to state this ruling <b>as</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say that if the pilgrimage Festival has passed and thirty days have not yet elapsed from</b> the time <b>when he bought</b> the animal <b>until now,</b> he may keep the animal until thirty days have elapsed. To counter this, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>we do not say: It is permitted to keep it for</b> a total of <b>thirty days. Rather, once the pilgrimage Festival has passed, he should not keep it</b> any longer.
