### Part 1
<b>and so did Rabbi Yehuda exempt</b> a blind person <b>from all judgments</b> of civil law <b>that are in the Torah.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? The verse states</b> with regard to an unintentional killing: <b>“Then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood, according to these laws”</b> (Numbers 35:24), to teach that <b>anyone who is subject to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a smiter and to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an avenger of blood is subject to</b> civil <b>laws, and anyone who is not subject to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a smiter or to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an avenger of blood,</b> including a blind person, <b>is not subject to</b> civil <b>laws.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara presents another statement of Rabbi Yehuda. It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A blind person does not have,</b> i.e., receive, compensation for <b>humiliation, and so did Rabbi Yehuda exempt</b> a blind person <b>from all mitzvot that are stated in the Torah. Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? The verse states: “And this is the commandment, statutes, and laws”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:1), to teach that <b>anyone who is subject to</b> civil <b>laws is</b> also <b>subject to</b> the <b>commandments and statutes, and anyone who is not subject to</b> civil <b>laws,</b> including a blind person, <b>is</b> also <b>not subject to</b> the <b>commandments and statutes.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yosef,</b> who was blind, <b>said: At first, I would say:</b> If I hear <b>one who says that</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says: A blind person</b> is <b>exempt from the mitzvot,</b> then <b>I will host a festive day for the Sages. What is the reason?</b> It is <b>that I am not commanded and</b> nevertheless <b>I perform mitzvot.</b>

### Part 4
Rav Yosef continues. <b>But now that I heard this</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> One who is <b>commanded and performs</b> a mitzva <b>is greater than</b> one who <b>is not commanded and performs</b> it, I say: If I hear <b>one who says to me</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> then <b>I will host a festive day for the Sages. What is the reason?</b> It is <b>that as I am commanded, I have more reward.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is a stringency with regard to a person</b> who caused injury, <b>compared to</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to an ox</b> that caused injury: The <i>halakha</i> is <b>that the person pays</b> compensation for <b>damage, pain, medical costs, loss of livelihood, and humiliation; and</b> if he caused a woman to miscarry he also <b>pays compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring,</b> as the verse states (see Exodus 21:22). <b>But</b> in the case of <b>an ox</b> that caused injury, the owner <b>pays only</b> compensation for <b>damage, and</b> he is <b>exempt from</b> paying <b>compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring.</b>

### Part 6
The mishna continues: <b>One who strikes his father or his mother but did not cause them</b> to have <b>a bruise,</b> and therefore is not liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, <b>and one who injures another on Yom Kippur,</b> the punishment for which is not court-imposed capital punishment, is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for all of</b> the five types of indemnity.

### Part 7
<b>One who injures a Hebrew slave</b> is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for all of</b> the five types of indemnity. This is <b>except for</b> compensation for <b>loss of livelihood</b> suffered <b>during the time that</b> the injured slave <b>belongs to</b> the one that injured him. Since the right to the slave’s labor belongs to his master, his inability to work is his master’s loss. <b>One who injures a Canaanite slave belonging to others is liable</b> to pay <b>for all of</b> the five types of indemnity. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Canaanite <b>slaves do not have humiliation,</b> so the one who injures the slave pays only the other four types of indemnity.

### Part 8
The mishna continues: With regard to <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, an encounter with them is disadvantageous.</b> In other words, no favorable outcome is possible for someone involved in an incident with one of these people, since <b>one who injures them</b> is <b>liable. But</b> if <b>they were</b> the ones <b>who injured others, they</b> are <b>exempt.</b> This is because they lack awareness and are not responsible for their actions.

### Part 9
Similarly, with regard to <b>a slave and</b> a married <b>woman, an encounter with them is disadvantageous,</b> since <b>one who injures them</b> is <b>liable. But</b> if <b>they</b> were the ones <b>who injured others, they</b> are <b>exempt,</b> because they do not have money with which to pay compensation. <b>But they pay</b> compensation <b>at a later time.</b> The exemption is only temporary, as, if <b>the woman becomes divorced</b> or <b>the slave becomes emancipated,</b> and they then have their own money, they are <b>liable to pay</b> compensation.

### Part 10
The mishna continues: <b>One who strikes his father or his mother and causes them</b> to have <b>a bruise, or one who injures another on Shabbat,</b> is <b>exempt from</b> paying <b>all of</b> the five types of indemnity, <b>because he is judged with</b> losing <b>his life.</b> The court imposes capital punishment for these acts, so there is no additional monetary punishment.

### Part 11
<b>And one who injures his own Canaanite slave</b> is <b>exempt from</b> paying <b>all of</b> the five types of indemnity, because his slave is his property.

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara discusses a case of compensation for injury. <b>Rabbi Elazar raised a dilemma before Rav:</b> In a case of <b>one who injures the minor daughter of others, to whom</b> does he pay compensation for the <b>injury?</b>

### Part 13
Rabbi Elazar explains the dilemma: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since the Merciful One granted the profits of</b> her <b>youth to the father,</b> as he receives her betrothal money, compensation for <b>injury also belongs to her father? What is the reason</b> that he should receive it? The reason is <b>that</b> the one who injured her <b>lowered her monetary</b> value, resulting in her father receiving gifts of lesser value when she is betrothed. <b>Or perhaps it is</b> only <b>the profits of</b> her <b>youth that the Merciful One granted to</b> her father, <b>because if he desires to give her</b> in marriage <b>to a</b> man <b>afflicted with boils, he can give</b> her to him, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>injury, since if he desires to injure her he may not injure her,</b> just as he may not injure any other person, <b>the Merciful One did not grant him</b> the right to receive the compensation when she is injured.
