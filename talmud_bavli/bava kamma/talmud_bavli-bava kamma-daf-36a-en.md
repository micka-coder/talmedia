### Part 1
The Gemara answers: The mishna does not indicate that the injured party receives compensation. Rather, it indicates that <b>it is fitting for him to take</b> compensation, <b>but</b> in practice <b>he does not</b> receive any compensation. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>he receives payment for</b> his <b>small ox from the</b> liable party’s <b>forewarned</b> ox, <b>and for</b> his <b>large</b> ox <b>from the</b> liable party’s <b>innocuous</b> ox? Evidently he does receive payment. The Gemara answers: This <i>baraita</i> is also referring to a case <b>where</b> the injured party <b>seized</b> the defendant’s ox, in which case the court allows it to remain in his possession. The court cannot compel the defendant to pay him <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: In a case where an ox was injured by one of two oxen that were pursuing it, if <b>both</b> oxen <b>belonged to one person, both are liable. Rava of Parzika said to Rav Ashi:</b> Should one <b>learn from</b> the fact that both are liable that in a case of <b>innocuous oxen that caused damage,</b> if the injured party <b>wishes,</b> he can <b>collect</b> damages <b>from</b> the proceeds from the sale of <b>this</b> ox, and if <b>he wishes,</b> he can <b>collect from</b> the sale of <b>that</b> ox?

### Part 3
Rav Ashi rejected this inference: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with forewarned</b> oxen, in which case the injured party does not collect damages exclusively from the belligerent ox but rather from any of its owner’s property. Therefore, he can collect from either ox as compensation.

### Part 4
Rava of Parzika replied: <b>If</b> the mishna is referring <b>to forewarned</b> oxen, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If <b>one</b> of the belligerent oxen <b>was large and</b> the other <b>one</b> was <b>small,</b> and <b>the injured</b> party <b>says</b> that <b>the large</b> ox <b>caused the damage, but the one liable for damage says: No; rather, the small</b> ox <b>caused the damage, the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. If</b> this is referring <b>to forewarned</b> oxen, <b>what difference does it make to him</b> which one caused the injury? <b>Ultimately,</b> the liable party <b>is required to pay</b> the <b>value of a full ox</b> in any case.

### Part 5
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: The latter clause</b> of the mishna is referring <b>to innocuous</b> oxen, <b>and the first clause</b> is referring <b>to forewarned</b> oxen.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Aḥa the Elder said to Rav Ashi: If</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a case of <b>forewarned</b> oxen, where compensation is not collected specifically from the belligerent ox, why does the mishna state: <b>They are liable,</b> in the plural form? <b>It should have</b> stated: The <b>man is liable. And furthermore, what</b> is the word <b>both</b> in the statement: Both are liable, referring to?

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> the first clause of the mishna is <b>actually</b> referring <b>to innocuous</b> oxen, <b>and it is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that the injured party and the liable party <b>are partners,</b> as they share ownership of the belligerent ox. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>the reason</b> that the owner of the belligerent oxen is liable is that <b>the two of them are</b> available, <b>so he cannot dismiss</b> the injured party by claiming that this ox is not the one that caused the injury. <b>But</b> if <b>the two of them are not</b> available, e.g., if one died or was lost, <b>he can say to</b> the injured party: <b>Go bring proof that</b> it was <b>this ox</b> that <b>caused you damage, and I will pay you</b> compensation.
