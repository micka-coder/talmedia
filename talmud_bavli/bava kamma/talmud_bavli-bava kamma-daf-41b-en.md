### Part 1
only in a case <b>where he checked</b> a sharp piece of <b>flint, and,</b> seeing that it did not have any defects, <b>slaughtered</b> the ox <b>with it.</b> In that case, one could say <b>that</b> by slaughtering it with a stone, <b>he performed the equivalent to stoning.</b> Therefore, it is prohibited to eat it. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where he slaughtered it with a knife</b> made of metal, one is <b>not</b> prohibited from eating it.

### Part 2
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>it is written in the Torah</b> that slaughter must performed specifically with <b>a knife,</b> which would justify a distinction between slaughtering with a stone and a knife? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 15b): With regard to <b>one who slaughters with a hand-sickle, with</b> a piece of <b>flint, or with a reed,</b> if these implements were suitable to be used for slaughter, <b>his slaughter is valid?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to Rabbi Abbahu, <b>now that he derives the prohibition of eating and the prohibition of deriving benefit from</b> the verse <b>“Its flesh shall not be eaten,” why do I</b> require the statement: <b>“The owner of the ox shall be clear”?</b> The Gemara answers: This is stated <b>to</b> prohibit <b>deriving benefit from its hide</b> after it has been killed; <b>as it could enter your mind to say that it is</b> specifically <b>its flesh from which it is prohibited to derive benefit,</b> as the verse states: “Its flesh shall not be eaten,” but <b>deriving benefit from its hide will be permitted.</b> Therefore, the Torah <b>teaches us</b> that <b>the owner of the ox shall be clear,</b> to indicate it is prohibited to derive benefit from any part of the ox.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to those <i>tanna’im</i> who expound this</b> verse: <b>“The owner of the ox shall be clear,” for another interpretation, as we wish to state below, from where do they derive</b> this prohibition against <b>deriving benefit from</b> the ox’s <b>hide?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>They derive it from</b> the wording: <b>“Its flesh</b> may not be eaten [<i>velo ye’akhel <b>et besaro</b></i><b>].”</b> The verse could have been formulated: <i>Velo ye’akhel besaro</i>, which already means: And its flesh shall not be eaten. The addition of the word “<i>et</i>” teaches that the prohibition applies also to <b>that which is secondary to the flesh.</b> And <b>what is that?</b> That is <b>its hide.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara adds: <b>And this <i>tanna</i>,</b> who derives it from the statement: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,” <b>does not interpret</b> the word <b>“<i>et</i>”</b> as a means to derive new <i>halakhot</i>. He considers the word “<i>et</i>” to be an ordinary part of the sentence structure and not a source for exegetical exposition.

### Part 7
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Shimon HaAmasoni, and some say</b> that it was <b>Neḥemya HaAmasoni, would interpret all</b> occurrences of the word <b>“<i>et</i>” in the Torah,</b> deriving additional <i>halakhot</i> with regard to the particular subject matter. <b>Once he reached</b> the verse: <b>“You shall fear the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13), which is written with the added word “<i>et</i>,” <b>he withdrew</b> from this method of exposition, as whose fear could be an extension of the fear of God? <b>His students said to him: Our teacher, what will be with all</b> the occurrences of the word <b>“<i>et</i>” that you interpreted</b> until now? <b>He said to them: Just as I received reward for the exposition, so I received reward for</b> my <b>withdrawal</b> from using this method of exposition.

### Part 8
The word “<i>et</i>” in this verse was not explained <b>until Rabbi Akiva came and expounded: “You shall fear the Lord your God”:</b> The word “<i>et</i>” serves <b>to include Torah scholars,</b> i.e., that one is commanded to fear them just as one fears God. In any event, Shimon HaAmasoni no longer derived additional <i>halakhot</i> from the word <i>et</i>.

### Part 9
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“But the owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> It means that <b>he shall be clear from paying half a ransom.</b> Although the owner of an innocuous ox that causes damage is liable to pay half the cost of the damage, if an ox kills a person its owner is not liable to pay any ransom.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Akiva said to him:</b> Why is it necessary for the verse to teach this? <b>But isn’t</b> compensation for damage caused by an innocuous ox <b>itself</b> anyway <b>paid only from</b> the value of <b>its body?</b> Here too, its owner can say to the claimant: <b>Bring it to court and it will pay you,</b> i.e., you will be paid from its value. Since the ox is stoned, there is nothing from which he can receive payment. Therefore, according to your interpretation, the verse does not introduce any <i>halakha</i> that could not have been inferred by logic, and is therefore superfluous.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: Is this how I</b> appear <b>in your eyes, that my derivation</b> from the verse is <b>in</b> reference to <b>this</b> case, that of an ox <b>that is liable</b> to be put to <b>death?</b> Obviously no verse would be required to teach this <i>halakha</i> in such a case. <b>My derivation is only</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> the assumption that the ox <b>killed a person</b> is <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness, or</b> is <b>based on</b> the admission of <b>the owner.</b> Such proof is not sufficient for the ox to be put to death by stoning, but one might have thought that it is sufficient to require its owner to pay ransom.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: If it is <b>based on</b> the admission of <b>the owner,</b> he clearly would not be liable to pay ransom, since <b>he</b> would be <b>admitting to</b> an act that results in <b>a fine,</b> in which case a person is exempt from paying the fine; so why would it be necessary for the verse to state this exemption?

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Eliezer <b>holds</b> that <b>ransom</b> is for the purpose of <b>atonement,</b> and is not considered a fine. Accordingly, one might have assumed that even in a case where there is not conclusive testimony, the owner must pay ransom to atone for the killing. Therefore, the verse states that in the case of an innocuous ox, the owner is not liable to pay half a ransom.

### Part 14
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: Akiva, is this how I</b> appear <b>in your eyes, that my derivation</b> from the verse is <b>in</b> reference to <b>this</b> case, that of an ox <b>that is liable</b> to be put to <b>death? My derivation is only</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> the ox <b>intended to kill an animal but killed a person</b> instead; or where it intended <b>to</b> kill <b>a gentile but killed a Jew;</b> or where it intended <b>to</b> kill <b>a non-viable baby but killed a viable person.</b> An ox is not put to death if it intended to gore in a manner which would not render it liable to be put to death, even if it did gore in such a manner. In such a case, the owner of the ox must pay ransom. Therefore, the verse states that if it is an innocuous ox, the owner is exempt from paying half a ransom.

### Part 15
These two <i>baraitot</i> cite different responses that Rabbi Eliezer gave Rabbi Akiva. <b>Which</b> one of these explanations <b>did he say to him first? Rav Kahana said in the name of Rava: He first said to him</b> the explanation referring to the ox’s <b>intention</b> to kill someone for which it would not be liable to be put to death, and subsequently gave him the second explanation with regard to the testimony of a single witness, or the owner’s admission. <b>Rav Tavyumei said in the name of Rava: He first said to him</b> the explanation that it is a case where the assumption that the ox <b>killed</b> was based on one witness or its owner’s admission.

### Part 16
The Gemara explains the reasoning behind the two opinions: <b>Rav Kahana said in the name of Rava</b> that <b>first he said to him</b> the explanation involving the ox’s <b>intention,</b> since this opinion is preferable to the other one, against which a difficulty was raised earlier. This is <b>analogous to a fisherman pulling fish from the sea.</b>
