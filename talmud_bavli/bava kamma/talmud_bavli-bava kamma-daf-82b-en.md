### Part 1
<b>And</b> Ezra <b>came</b> and added to the Torah’s minimal obligation. He <b>instituted</b> the requirement of <b>combing</b> the hair even when it is known that it is not knotted and contains no repulsive substance.

### Part 2
The Gemara discusses the next of Ezra’s ordinances: <b>And that peddlers should circulate through</b> all <b>the towns.</b> This Gemara explains that this is <b>because</b> peddlers supply <b>women’s cosmetics,</b> and therefore Ezra instituted this practice <b>so that</b> women <b>should not become unattractive to their husbands.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara analyzes the last of the ten ordinances: <b>And he instituted</b> the requirement of <b>immersion for those who experienced a seminal emission.</b> The Gemara asks: But this <b>is</b> required <b>by Torah law, as it is written: “And if the flow of seed go out from a man, then he shall bathe</b> all <b>his flesh in water”</b> (Leviticus 15:16). The Gemara answers: <b>By Torah law</b> immersion <b>is</b> required only if one wishes to partake <b>of <i>teruma</i> or sacrificial</b> meat. Ezra <b>came</b> and further <b>instituted</b> that immersion is necessary <b>even for</b> reciting or studying <b>matters of Torah.</b>

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches that one may not raise chickens in Jerusalem. The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that contains a list of other <i>halakhot</i> that are unique to Jerusalem. <b>Ten matters were stated with regard to Jerusalem: A house</b> situated <b>in</b> Jerusalem does <b>not</b> become <b>irredeemable</b> one year after its sale. Those who sell houses in other walled cities have the right to buy back their property for one year after the transaction. If they fail to do so, the house becomes the permanent possession of the buyer (see Leviticus 25:29–30). This <i>halakha</i> does not apply to houses in Jerusalem. <b>And</b> its Elders do <b>not bring a heifer whose neck is broken</b> as required when a murder victim is found near a city and the murderer is unknown (see Deuteronomy 21:1–9); <b>and</b> it <b>cannot become an idolatrous city</b> (see Deuteronomy 13:13–19).

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> continues its list: <b>And</b> a house in Jerusalem <b>cannot become ritually impure</b> with the impurity <b>of leprous sores; and one may not build out projections or balconies [<i>gezuztraot</i>]</b> from houses that are <b>in it; and one may not establish garbage dumps in</b> Jerusalem; <b>and one may not build kilns in it; and one may not plant gardens and orchards [<i>pardesot</i>] in it, except for</b> the <b>rose gardens that were</b> already there <b>from the times of the early prophets; and one may not raise chickens in it; and</b> finally, <b>one may not leave a corpse overnight in</b> Jerusalem.

### Part 6
The Gemara discusses these ten <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to Jerusalem, one by one: <b>A house</b> situated <b>in</b> it does <b>not</b> become <b>irredeemable</b> one year after its sale. The reason is <b>that it is written:</b> “And if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then <b>the house</b> that is in the <b>walled</b> city <b>shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations”</b> (Leviticus 25:30). <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> who taught this <i>baraita</i> <b>maintains</b> that <b>Jerusalem was not apportioned to</b> any single one of <b>the tribes</b> of Israel; rather, it is considered common property. Since no one has ancestral ownership of any house in Jerusalem, its houses cannot be sold permanently.

### Part 7
The Gemara analyzes the next <i>halakha</i>: <b>And</b> its inhabitants do <b>not bring a heifer whose neck is broken.</b> The reason is <b>that it is written: “If one is found slain in the land that the Lord your God gives you to possess it”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:1). <b>And,</b> again, the <i>tanna</i> who taught this <i>baraita</i> <b>maintains</b> that <b>Jerusalem was not apportioned to</b> any one of <b>the tribes</b> of Israel. Therefore, it is not included in the description: “The land that the Lord your God gives you to possess it.”

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And</b> it <b>cannot become an idolatrous city.</b> The reason is <b>that it is written,</b> in the introduction of the passage dealing with the <i>halakha</i> of an idolatrous city: “If you shall hear tell concerning one of <b>your cities,</b> which the Lord your God gives you to dwell there” (Deuteronomy 13:13). <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> who taught this <i>baraita</i> maintains that <b>Jerusalem was not apportioned to</b> any one of <b>the tribes</b> of Israel. It is therefore not included in the description “one of your cities, which the Lord your God gives you to dwell there.”

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> further teaches: <b>And</b> a house in Jerusalem does <b>not become ritually impure</b> with the impurity <b>of leprous sores.</b> The reason is <b>that it is written: “And I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession”</b> (Leviticus 14:34). <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> who taught this <i>baraita</i> maintains that <b>Jerusalem was not apportioned to</b> any one of <b>the tribes</b> of Israel. It is there-fore not included in the description “a house of the land of your possession.”

### Part 10
The Gemara discusses the next <i>halakha</i>: <b>And one may not build out projections or balconies</b> from houses that are <b>in</b> Jerusalem. The Gemara provides two reasons for this prohibition. First, it is <b>due to</b> the danger of contracting <b>ritual impurity</b> by being in <b>the</b> same <b>tent</b> as a corpse, i.e., under the same roof, in which case the impurity spreads to all items under the roof. If even a small part of a corpse is under a balcony, everyone who passes under that balcony is rendered impure. Many people come to Jerusalem to sacrifice offerings, and they must maintain a state of ritual purity. The other reason is <b>so that those</b> great crowds of <b>pilgrims not be injured</b> by colliding with the projections.

### Part 11
The next <i>halakha</i> pertaining to Jerusalem is: <b>And one may not establish garbage dumps in it.</b> The Gemara explains that the reason is <b>due to</b> the <b>repugnant creatures</b> that are attracted to such heaps and impart ritual impurity upon their death.

### Part 12
The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And one may not build kilns in</b> Jerusalem. The reason is <b>due to the</b> unsightly <b>smoke</b> produced by kilns. The Sages sought to preserve the beauty of Jerusalem and the Temple.

### Part 13
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And one may not plant gardens and orchards in it.</b> This is <b>due to the odor</b> emitted by these places, either from discarded weeds or from fertilizer.

### Part 14
The next <i>halakha</i> on the list is: <b>And one may not raise chickens in</b> Jerusalem. The Gemara explains that this is <b>due to the sacrificial</b> meat that is consumed in Jerusalem. Since chickens peck in the garbage, they are likely to pick up items that impart ritual impurity and bring them into contact with the consecrated food, which may not be eaten in an impure state.

### Part 15
The Gemara discusses the last <i>halakha</i>: <b>And one may not leave a corpse overnight in it.</b> The Gemara notes that this prohibition is <b>a tradition;</b> there is no known explanation for it.

### Part 16
§ The mishna teaches that <b>one may not raise pigs anywhere. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> the background for this <i>halakha</i>: <b>When</b> the members of <b>the house of Hasmonean</b> monarchy <b>were at war with each other, Hyrcanus,</b> one of the parties to this war, <b>was inside</b> the besieged Jerusalem, <b>while</b> his brother <b>Aristobulus,</b> the other contender to the throne, was <b>on the outside. And every day</b> the people inside <b>would lower down money in a box</b> from the Temple walls, to purchase sheep to sacrifice, <b>and</b> those on other side <b>would</b> take the money and <b>send up</b> sheep <b>to them</b> over the wall for the <b>daily offerings.</b>

### Part 17
<b>There was a certain elder there who was familiar with Greek wisdom,</b> and <b>he said</b> to those besieging Jerusalem: <b>As long as they occupy themselves with the</b> Temple <b>service, they will not be delivered into your hands. The next day they lowered down money in a box</b> as usual, <b>but</b> this time <b>they sent up to them a pig. When the pig reached to the midpoint of the</b> Temple <b>wall it stuck its hooves into the wall, and Eretz Yisrael quaked</b> over an area of <b>four hundred parasangs by four hundred parasangs.</b>

### Part 18
<b>At that time</b> the Sages <b>said: Cursed be the man who raises pigs, and cursed be the man who teaches his son Greek wisdom. And</b> it was <b>concerning that time</b> of siege that <b>we learned</b> in a mishna: There was <b>an incident</b> in which the barley for the <b><i>omer</i> offering came from the gardens of Tzerifin,</b> far from Jerusalem, <b>and</b> the wheat for <b>the two loaves</b> of <i>Shavuot</i> was brought <b>from the valley of Ein Sokher.</b> Barley and wheat could not be brought from any nearer because the besiegers had destroyed all the produce around Jerusalem. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks a question with regard to this <i>baraita</i>: <b>And is</b> it really <b>prohibited</b> to study <b>Greek wisdom? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: In Eretz Yisrael,</b>
