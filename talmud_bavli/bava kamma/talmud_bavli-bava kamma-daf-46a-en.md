### Part 1
<b>But</b> if an ox is <b>entirely</b> rendered <b>forewarned, you do not find an element of innocuousness with regard to it at all.</b> If it is forewarned with regard to goring with either horn, its status of innocuousness is completely revoked.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> An ox <b>has no</b> sufficient <b>safeguarding</b> at all <b>other than</b> slaughtering it with <b>a knife. Rabba said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> It is <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to a forewarned ox: <b>“And</b> the owner <b>has not secured it”</b> (Exodus 21:36), meaning that once it is rendered forewarned the owner <b>no longer has</b> any sufficient manner of <b>safeguarding this</b> animal, and the owner is responsible for all damage it causes.

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>If that is so,</b> does <b>that which is written</b> with regard to a pit: “And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit <b>and not cover it”</b> (Exodus 21:33), <b>also</b> mean that once a pit has been dug the owner <b>no longer has</b> any adequate way of <b>covering this</b> pit, which would exempt its owner from paying damages?

### Part 4
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed</b> that is the <i>halakha</i>, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (52a) that if <b>he covered</b> the pit <b>appropri-ately, and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died,</b> he is <b>exempt?</b> Evidently, a pit can be covered adequately.

### Part 5
<b>Rather, Abaye</b> rejected Rabba’s explanation of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, and <b>said</b> that <b>this is</b> the <b>reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer: As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not raise a vicious dog in his house, and</b> that <b>one may not set up an unstable ladder in his house? As it is stated: “You shall not bring blood into your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:8), which means that one may not allow a hazardous situation to remain in his house. Similarly, a person should not keep a forewarned ox in his possession, as it is dangerous. This is why Rabbi Eliezer rules that no level of safeguarding is sufficient for it; the ox should be slaughtered so that it will not cause damage.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of an innocuous <b>ox that gored</b> and killed <b>a cow, and</b> the cow’s <b>fetus was found</b> dead <b>at its side, and it is not known whether</b> the cow <b>gave birth before</b> the ox <b>gored it</b> and the fetus’s death is unrelated to the goring or <b>whether it gave birth after</b> the ox <b>gored it</b> and the fetus died on account of the goring, the owner of the ox <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage for the cow and one-quarter</b> of the cost <b>of the damage for the offspring.</b> Since it is uncertain whether the ox was responsible for the death of the fetus, in which case he would pay half the damages, its owner pays only half the amount for the fetus that he would ordinarily be required to pay, i.e., one-quarter.

### Part 8
<b>And likewise,</b> there is uncertainty in the case of an innocuous <b>cow that gored an ox, and</b> the cow’s newborn <b>offspring was found at its side</b> dead or alive, <b>and it is not known whether</b> the cow <b>gave birth before it gored</b> the ox or <b>whether</b> the cow <b>gave birth after it gored.</b> When damage is caused by an innocuous animal, the liability of the owner is limited to the value of the animal that gored. Therefore, <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage is paid from</b> the value of <b>the cow,</b> as in the standard case of an innocuous animal. <b>And</b> if that does not suffice to pay for half the cost of the damage, <b>one-quarter of</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> is paid <b>from the offspring.</b> Since it is uncertain whether the offspring was part of the cow at the time the cow gored, the owner pays only half of what he would pay if it were certain that it was part of the cow.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: This</b> ruling in the mishna is <b>the statement of Sumakhos, who says: Property of uncertain ownership</b> is <b>divided</b> by the two parties. <b>But the Rabbis say</b> that <b>this is the significant principle of</b> monetary <b>law: The burden of proof rests upon the claimant,</b> and the disputed sum is not divided. According to the Rabbis, in the cases of uncertainty in the mishna, no payment is made for the fetus or from the offspring, respectively.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need for the Rabbis <b>to say</b> the words: <b>This is the significant principle of</b> monetary <b>law?</b> Why not just state the principle? The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to say them <b>because even</b> in a case where the <b>injured</b> party <b>states:</b> I am <b>certain</b> that such and such occurred, <b>and the one liable for the damage says: Perhaps</b> it was otherwise, without definitively refuting the claim against him, <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b> Although the injured party claims with certainty that he is correct and the defendant’s claim is only speculative, the definite claim still does not render the defendant liable to pay, absent proof.

### Part 11
<b>Alternatively,</b> the phrase: This is the significant principle of monetary law, was necessary <b>for</b> instances <b>such as this, as it was stated:</b> In the case of <b>one who sells an ox to another and</b> the ox <b>is found</b> to be one that <b>habitually gores, Rav says</b> that <b>this is</b> considered to be <b>a mistaken transaction,</b> since the purchaser can claim that he bought the ox specifically for labor, and an ox that gores is not suitable for such tasks. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> The seller can <b>say to him: I sold it to you for slaughter,</b> and the fact that it gores is immaterial.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> are Rav and Shmuel speculating about the purpose of the sale? <b>But let us</b> simply <b>see if</b> the purchaser is <b>a person who buys</b> oxen <b>for plowing or a person who buys</b> oxen <b>for slaughter.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for them to engage in a dispute in the case <b>of a person who buys</b> oxen <b>for</b> both <b>this and for that</b> reason, and in this instance it was unclear for which purpose it was intended.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>But let us see</b> what the purchase price was: <b>If</b> he paid <b>the price of</b> an ox fit for <b>plowing,</b> which is a large amount of money, then it can be assumed it was intended <b>for plowing.</b> But <b>if</b> he paid the <b>price of</b> an ox for <b>slaughtering,</b> which is a much smaller amount, it can be assumed that it was sold <b>for slaughtering.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for them to engage in a dispute in a case <b>where</b> the cost of <b>meat rose and</b> an ox purchased for slaughtering <b>stands at the</b> same <b>price</b> as an ox purchased <b>for plowing.</b> In that case, Rav and Shmuel dispute whether the purchaser can claim that the transaction was made in error, or whether the seller can claim that he sold it to be slaughtered and the purchaser must provide proof for his claim.
