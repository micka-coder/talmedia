### Part 1
<b>But</b> if an ox is <b>entirely</b> rendered <b>forewarned, you do not find an element of innocuousness with regard to it at all.</b> If it is forewarned with regard to goring with either horn, its status of innocuousness is completely revoked.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> An ox <b>has no</b> sufficient <b>safeguarding</b> at all <b>other than</b> slaughtering it with <b>a knife. Rabba said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> It is <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to a forewarned ox: <b>“And</b> the owner <b>has not secured it”</b> (Exodus 21:36), meaning that once it is rendered forewarned the owner <b>no longer has</b> any sufficient manner of <b>safeguarding this</b> animal, and the owner is responsible for all damage it causes.

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>If that is so,</b> does <b>that which is written</b> with regard to a pit: “And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit <b>and not cover it”</b> (Exodus 21:33), <b>also</b> mean that once a pit has been dug the owner <b>no longer has</b> any adequate way of <b>covering this</b> pit, which would exempt its owner from paying damages?

### Part 4
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed</b> that is the <i>halakha</i>, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (52a) that if <b>he covered</b> the pit <b>appropri-ately, and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died,</b> he is <b>exempt?</b> Evidently, a pit can be covered adequately.

### Part 5
<b>Rather, Abaye</b> rejected Rabba’s explanation of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, and <b>said</b> that <b>this is</b> the <b>reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer: As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not raise a vicious dog in his house, and</b> that <b>one may not set up an unstable ladder in his house? As it is stated: “You shall not bring blood into your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:8), which means that one may not allow a hazardous situation to remain in his house. Similarly, a person should not keep a forewarned ox in his possession, as it is dangerous. This is why Rabbi Eliezer rules that no level of safeguarding is sufficient for it; the ox should be slaughtered so that it will not cause damage.
