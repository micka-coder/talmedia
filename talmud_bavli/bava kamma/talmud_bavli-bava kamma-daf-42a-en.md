### Part 1
When <b>he finds big ones he takes</b> them, and when he finds <b>small ones he takes</b> them as well. Here too, although Rabbi Eliezer’s first explanation was sufficient, he added an additional response, despite the fact that it was not as good as the first.

### Part 2
By contrast, <b>Rav Tavyumei said in the name of Rava</b> that <b>he first said to him</b> the explanation involving inconclusive testimony asserting that the ox <b>killed,</b> since this is <b>analogous to a fisherman pulling fish from the sea,</b> who <b>finds small ones</b> and <b>takes</b> them, and when he then <b>finds big ones, he discards the small ones and takes</b> only <b>the big ones.</b> Here too, once Rabbi Eliezer thought of a better response to Rabbi Akiva’s question, he suggested it instead of the first.

### Part 3
§ <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says:</b> It means he shall be <b>clear from</b> paying <b>compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring.</b> In other words, if an innocuous ox causes a woman to miscarry, the owner is not liable to pay half the compensation for the miscarried offspring.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Akiva said to him:</b> It is unnecessary for the verse to teach this. <b>Doesn’t it say</b> with regard to paying compensation for miscarried offspring: <b>“If men struggle and hurt a</b> pregnant <b>woman</b> and her offspring emerge, and there is no tragedy, he shall be punished as the husband of the woman shall impose upon him and he shall give as the judges determine” (Exodus 21:22); from which it is inferred that <b>men</b> who cause a woman to miscarry are liable to pay compensation for the offspring, <b>but</b> the owner of <b>oxen</b> who cause a woman to miscarry is <b>not</b> liable?

### Part 5
The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Akiva is saying well;</b> he states a reasonable objection. What would Rabbi Yosei HaGelili have responded to him?

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ulla, son of Rav Idi, said: It was necessary</b> for the verse to teach this exemption, as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that this inference should be limited, as follows: <b>Men</b> are liable to pay compensation for miscarried offspring, <b>but</b> the owner of <b>oxen that are comparable to men</b> is <b>not</b> liable. Only some oxen are excluded from this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Just as men are</b> categorically considered <b>forewarned, so too</b> the <b>oxen,</b> which are contrasted with men in this case, <b>are</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> as well. <b>But</b> in the case of miscarriage caused by <b>an innocuous</b> ox, its owner <b>would be liable</b> to pay compensation for miscarried offspring. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote</b> with regard to an innocuous ox: <b>“The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> to teach us <b>that</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from liability.

### Part 7
<b>Rava said,</b> in objection to this answer: <b>The native is on the ground and the stranger is in the heavens!</b> The aforementioned suggestion contradicts the principle that the <i>halakha</i> of a forewarned ox is more stringent than that of an innocuous ox.

### Part 8
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> a different way for Rabbi Yosei HaGelili to counter Rabbi Akiva’s objection: <b>It was necessary</b> for the verse to teach this exemption, as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that only <b>men</b> are liable to pay for miscarried offspring, <b>but</b> the owner of <b>oxen that are comparable to men</b> is <b>not</b> liable. <b>Just as men are</b> categorically considered <b>forewarned, so too</b> the <b>oxen,</b> which are contrasted with men in this case, <b>are</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> as well. <b>And for</b> miscarriage caused by <b>innocuous oxen,</b> their owners <b>are</b> also <b>exempt</b> due to an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. <b>The Merciful One then wrote</b> that <b>the owner of the</b> innocuous <b>ox shall be clear,</b> indicating that only for <b>an innocuous</b> ox is one <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation for miscarried offspring, <b>but</b> for <b>a forewarned</b> ox the owner is <b>liable.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Abaye said to him: If that is so,</b> then <b>with regard to</b> compensation for <b>humiliation,</b> which is derived from the verse: “When men struggle together, a man and his brother, and the wife of one drew near to deliver her husband from the hand of the one who smites him, and extended her hand, and grabbed his genitals” (Deuteronomy 25:11), <b>let us say this as well:</b> Only <b>men</b> are liable to pay for humiliation, <b>but</b> the owner of <b>oxen that are comparable to men</b> is <b>not</b> liable. <b>Just as men are</b> categorically considered <b>forewarned, so too</b> the <b>oxen,</b> which are contrasted with men in this case, <b>are</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> as well. <b>And for</b> humiliation caused by <b>innocuous oxen,</b> their owners <b>are</b> also <b>exempt</b> due to an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. <b>The Merciful One then wrote</b> that <b>the owner of the</b> innocuous <b>ox shall be clear,</b> indicating that only for <b>an innocuous</b> ox is one <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation for humiliation, <b>but</b> for <b>a forewarned</b> ox the owner is <b>liable.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed</b> that is the <i>halakha</i> according to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, <b>if so, let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> that with regard to the verse: <b>“The owner of the ox shall be clear,” Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: He is exempt</b> both <b>from</b> paying <b>compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring and from</b> paying compensation for <b>humiliation.</b>

### Part 11
Rava then retracted this explanation of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s opinion. <b>Rather, Abaye and Rava both say</b> that Rabbi Akiva’s inference is correct, according to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, but with regard to the continuation of the verse: “But if any harm follows, you shall give life for life” (Exodus 21:22). With regard to <b>men,</b> if <b>there is no harm</b> caused <b>to the woman,</b> i.e., she is not killed, <b>they shall be punished</b> financially and are liable to pay compensation for miscarried offspring. But if <b>there is harm</b> caused <b>to the woman</b> and she dies, <b>they shall not be punished</b> financially, as they are liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment. This distinction applies only with regard to men <b>but not</b> with regard to <b>oxen, as even if there is harm</b> caused to the woman, the owners <b>shall be punished</b> financially. In order to preclude this inference, <b>the Merciful One then wrote: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> to teach <b>that</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation for miscarried offspring.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava objects to this: Is that to say</b> that <b>the issue</b> of financial liability <b>is dependent on</b> whether or not there was <b>harm</b> caused to the woman? Clearly, <b>the issue is dependent on the intent</b> to strike the woman.

### Part 13
<b>Rather, Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> a different inference: With regard to <b>men,</b> in a case <b>where they intended to</b> strike <b>each other, even if there is harm</b> caused <b>to the woman,</b> i.e., she dies, <b>they shall be punished</b> financially, and are liable to pay compensation for miscarried offspring. But <b>when they intended to</b> strike <b>the woman herself they shall not be punished</b> financially, as they are liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment. <b>But</b> this distinction does <b>not</b> apply with regard to <b>oxen, as even if they intended to</b> strike <b>the woman herself,</b> their owners <b>shall be punished.</b> In order to preclude this inference, <b>the Merciful One wrote: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> to teach <b>that</b> the owners are <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation for miscarried offspring.

### Part 14
<b>And similarly, when Rav Ḥaggai came from the South, he came and brought a <i>baraita</i> in his hand</b> that interprets the verse <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation <b>of Rav Adda bar Ahava.</b>

### Part 15
§ <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse <b>“The owner of the ox shall be clear”</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This statement teaches that if an innocuous ox kills a Canaanite slave, its owner shall be <b>clear from</b> paying <b>compensation for the slave,</b> unlike the case of a forewarned ox that killed a Canaanite slave, where the ox’s owner is liable.
