### Part 1
<b>The Festivals of the Lord were stated,</b> but <b>Shabbat,</b> which commemorates <b>Creation, was not stated. Ben Azzai says: The Festivals of the Lord were stated,</b> but <b>the dissolution of vows was not stated.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 2
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Natan learned this <i>baraita</i> and did not know how to explain it.</b> He <b>followed Rav Sheshet to Neharde’a</b> in order to ask him about it, <b>but</b> he <b>did not find him</b> there. He <b>followed him to Meḥoza</b> and <b>found him,</b> and he <b>said to him: What</b> is meant by Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s statement: <b>The Festivals of the Lord were stated,</b> but <b>Shabbat,</b> which commemorates <b>Creation, was not stated?</b> What does he mean, as Shabbat of Creation is explicitly mentioned in that section of the Torah (Leviticus 23:3)?

### Part 3
Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: The Festivals of the Lord require sanctification by the court.</b> This means that the start of the month, which is dependent upon the appearance of the New Moon, which determines the Festivals, can be established only by a court composed of experts. <b>Shabbat,</b> which commemorates <b>Creation, does not require sanctification by the court.</b> Shabbat is sanctified every week independent of any court action. It may <b>enter your mind to say: Since</b> Shabbat <b>is written adjacent to the Festivals, it should require sanctification by the court as</b> do the <b>Festivals.</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili <b>teaches us</b> that Shabbat does not require this.

### Part 4
Rabbi Yosei bar Natan asked: <b>What</b> is meant by ben Azzai’s statement: <b>The Festivals of the Lord were stated,</b> but <b>the dissolution of vows was not stated?</b> After all, the Torah writes explicitly about the dissolution of vows. Rav Sheshet answered him: <b>The Festivals of the Lord require experts</b> to determine when the months begin and when the Festivals will be observed, but <b>the dissolution of vows does not require experts.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara questions this explanation. <b>But it is written: “The heads of the tribes”</b> (Numbers 30:2), in the portion discussing the <i>halakhot</i> of vows. How, then, can it be said that vows can be dissolved by laymen? <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The phrase teaches that vows can be dissolved <b>by a single expert</b> authority. In any event, the Gemara has established that Beit Shammai can derive that dissolution of vows can be performed by laymen in the manner stated by ben Azzai, as explained by Rav Sheshet.

### Part 6
§ The Gemara discusses a mishna that addresses the issue of inter-tribal marriages. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Ta’anit</i> 26b): <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: There were no days as joyous for the Jewish people as the fifteenth of Av and as Yom Kippur, as on these</b> days <b>the daughters of Jerusalem would emerge in white garments,</b> which each woman <b>borrowed</b> from another. Why did they borrow garments? They did this <b>so as not to embarrass one who did not have</b> her own white garments. The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <b>Granted</b> that <b>Yom Kippur</b> is a day of joy, because it is <b>a day of pardon and forgiveness,</b> and moreover, it is the <b>day on which the last Tablets</b> of the Covenant <b>were given. But what is</b> the special joy of the <b>fifteenth of Av?</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> This was the <b>day when</b> the members of different <b>tribes were permitted to marry</b> into <b>one another’s</b> tribe. Such marriages were restricted for the first generation to enter Eretz Yisrael, as discussed above (120a). <b>What</b> verse <b>did</b> the sages of that time <b>interpret</b> in support of their conclusion that this <i>halakha</i> was no longer in effect? The verse states: <b>“This is the matter”</b> (Numbers 36:6), meaning, <b>this matter shall be practiced only in this generation,</b> in which Eretz Yisrael is being divided among the tribes.

### Part 8
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> offered another explanation: The fifteenth of Av was the <b>day when</b> the <b>tribe of Benjamin was permitted to enter into the congregation</b> of the other tribes of Israel through marriage, after the other tribes found a way to dissolve the vow that had prohibited them from marrying a member of the tribe of Benjamin in the aftermath of the episode of the concubine in Gibeah (Judges, chapters 19–20). <b>As it is written: “And the men of Israel had taken an oath in Mizpah, saying: None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife”</b> (Judges 21:1). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> verse <b>did</b> the sages of that time <b>interpret</b> that enabled them to dissolve this vow? The verse states: “None <b>of us,” and not:</b> None <b>of our children;</b> therefore, the oath applied only to the generation that had taken the oath.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Dimi bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman</b> says: The fifteenth of Av was the <b>day on which those designated to perish in the wilderness stopped</b> dying, as the entire generation that had left Egypt had died due to the sin of the spies (Numbers 14:29–30). <b>As the Master says: As long as those designated to perish</b> in the <b>wilderness had not stopped</b> dying,
