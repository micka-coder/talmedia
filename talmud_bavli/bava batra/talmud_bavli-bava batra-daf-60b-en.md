### Part 1
<b>Go now, and come tomorrow. At night,</b> Rabbi Yannai <b>sent</b> and had someone <b>cut</b> down <b>that</b> tree that belonged <b>to him.</b>

### Part 2
<b>The next day,</b> that man <b>came before</b> Rabbi Yannai, who <b>said to him: Go, cut</b> down your tree. The man <b>said to him: But</b> the <b>Master also has</b> a tree that leans into the public domain. Rabbi Yannai <b>said to him: Go</b> and <b>see: If mine is cut</b> down, then <b>cut yours</b> down. <b>If mine is not cut</b> down, <b>you do not</b> have to <b>cut</b> yours down, either.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>At the outset what did</b> Rabbi Yannai <b>hold, and ultimately, what did he hold?</b> The Gemara replies: <b>At the outset, he held</b> that <b>the general public is amenable</b> to having the tree there, <b>as they sit in its shade. Once he saw that</b> they were <b>preventing</b> someone else who owned a tree from keeping his, he understood that it was only out of respect that they did not object to his tree being there. He therefore <b>sent</b> someone to <b>cut it</b> down. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why did he tell the man to return the next day? <b>Let</b> him <b>say to him: Go cut</b> down <b>your</b> tree, <b>and then I will cut mine</b> down. The Gemara answers: <b>Because of</b> the statement of <b>Reish Lakish, who said:</b> The verse states: <b>“Gather yourselves together and gather [<i>hitkosheshu vakoshu</i>]”</b> (Zephaniah 2:1), and this can be explained homiletically to mean: <b>Adorn [<i>keshot</i>] yourself and afterward adorn others,</b> i.e., act properly before requiring others to do so.

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches that one may not extend projections or balconies into the public domain. <b>Rather, if he desired</b> to build one he may <b>draw back into his</b> property by moving his wall, <b>and extend</b> the projection to the end of his property line. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one <b>drew back</b> into his property <b>but did not extend</b> the projection at that time, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>whether</b> he may <b>return and extend</b> it at a later date? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>drew back</b> into his property, he <b>may extend</b> it even later, <b>and Reish Lakish says:</b> If one <b>drew back</b> into his property but did not build the projection at that time, he <b>may not extend</b> it later.

### Part 5
The Gemara presents an alternative version of the dispute: <b>Rabbi Ya’akov said to Rabbi Yirmeya bar Taḥlifa: I will explain</b> the matter <b>to you. To</b> later <b>extend</b> a projection, <b>everyone agrees that</b> he <b>may extend</b> it, since he is adding within his own property. <b>Where they disagree</b> is <b>with regard to</b> whether he may <b>return</b> the <b>walls to their</b> prior <b>place. And</b> with regard to this disagreement <b>the opposite was stated: Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> he <b>may not return</b> the walls to their prior place, <b>and Reish Lakish says</b> he <b>may return</b> them.

### Part 6
Rabbi Ya’akov explains their reasoning: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that he <b>may not return</b> the walls to their prior place <b>because</b> of the statement <b>of Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>a path that</b> the <b>public has established</b> as a public thoroughfare, <b>it is prohibited to ruin it,</b> i.e., to prevent people from using it. Once the public has become accustomed to using the place where his wall had stood, he may not repossess that space. <b>And Reish Lakish says</b> that he <b>may return</b> the walls to their prior place, because <b>that matter</b> applies in a case <b>where there is no space,</b> i.e., if he were to move back the wall there would be no space for the public to walk, but <b>here there is space,</b> since they can still walk through the public domain.

### Part 7
The mishna teaches that if one <b>purchased a courtyard in which there are projections and balconies</b> extending into the public domain, this courtyard <b>retains its presumptive status,</b> allowing the owner to use the projections. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If the wall of the courtyard <b>fell, he may return and build it</b> as it was, including the projections or balconies.

### Part 8
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:17): <b>One may not plaster, and one may not tile, and one may not paint [<i>mefayyeḥin</i>]</b> images <b>in the present,</b> as a sign of mourning for the destruction of the Temple. But if one <b>purchased a courtyard</b> that was <b>plastered, tiled,</b> or <b>painted</b> with images, <b>this</b> courtyard <b>retains its presumptive status,</b> and it is assumed that it was done in a permitted manner. If <b>it</b> then <b>fell, he may not return and build it</b> in its previous form. This indicates that one may not rebuild a building in a manner that is prohibited, even if there was an acquired privilege to maintain it in that manner.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: A case of <b>forbidden</b> matters <b>is different,</b> i.e., in the case of the <i>baraita</i>, he may not rebuild it because it is prohibited for him to do so. In this mishna, the issue is encroachment upon the rights of others, and once he had an acquired privilege to use the projections or balconies, he maintains that right.

### Part 10
§ With regard to the ruling of the above-quoted <i>baraita</i>, <b>the Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sota</i> 15:9): <b>A person may not plaster his house with plaster, but if</b> he <b>mixed sand or straw into</b> the plaster, which dulls its luster, it is <b>permitted. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he <b>mixed sand into it, it is</b> white <b>cement [<i>terakesid</i>],</b> which is of a higher quality than standard plaster, <b>and</b> it is <b>prohibited,</b> but if he mixed in <b>straw,</b> it is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 11
§ Having mentioned the prohibition against plastering, which is a sign of mourning over the destruction of the Temple, the Gemara discusses related matters. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sota</i> 15:11): <b>When the Temple was destroyed a second</b> time, there was <b>an increase</b> in the number of <b>ascetics among</b> the <b>Jews,</b> whose practice was <b>to not eat meat and to not drink wine. Rabbi Yehoshua joined them</b> to discuss their practice. <b>He said to them: My children, for what</b> reason do <b>you not eat meat and</b> do <b>you not drink wine? They said to him: Shall we eat meat, from which</b> offerings <b>are sacrificed upon</b> the <b>altar, and now</b> the altar <b>has ceased</b> to exist? <b>Shall we drink wine, which is poured</b> as a libation <b>upon the altar, and now</b> the altar <b>has ceased</b> to exist?

### Part 12
Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: If so, we will not eat bread</b> either, <b>since</b> the <b>meal-offerings</b> that were offered upon the altar <b>have ceased.</b> They replied: You are correct. It is <b>possible</b> to subsist <b>with produce.</b> He said to them: <b>We will not eat produce</b> either, <b>since</b> the bringing of <b>the first fruits have ceased.</b> They replied: You are correct. We will no longer eat the produce of the seven species from which the first fruits were brought, as it is <b>possible</b> to subsist <b>with other produce.</b> He said to them: If so, <b>we will not drink water, since the water libation has ceased. They were silent,</b> as they realized that they could not survive without water.

### Part 13
Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: My children, come, and I will tell you</b> how we should act. <b>To not mourn at all</b> is <b>impossible, as</b> the <b>decree was already issued</b> and the Temple has been destroyed. <b>But to mourn excessively</b> as you are doing is also <b>impossible, as</b> the Sages <b>do not issue a decree upon the public unless a majority of the public is able to abide by it, as it is written: “You are cursed with the curse, yet you rob Me, even this whole nation”</b> (Malachi 3:9), indicating that the prophet rebukes the people for neglecting observances only if they were accepted by the whole nation.

### Part 14
Rabbi Yehoshua continues: <b>Rather, this</b> is what <b>the Sages said: A person</b> may <b>plaster his house with plaster, but</b> he must <b>leave</b> over <b>a small amount in it</b> without plaster to remember the destruction of the Temple. The Gemara interjects: <b>And how much</b> is a small amount? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> One <b>cubit by</b> one <b>cubit. Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This should be <b>opposite the entrance,</b> so that it is visible to all.

### Part 15
Rabbi Yehoshua continues: The Sages said that <b>a person</b> may <b>prepare all</b> that he <b>needs for a meal, but</b> he must <b>leave</b> out <b>a small item</b> to remember the destruction of the Temple. The Gemara interjects: <b>What</b> is <b>this</b> small item? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Something akin to <b>small, fried fish.</b>

### Part 16
Rabbi Yehoshua continues: The Sages said that <b>a woman</b> may <b>engage</b> in <b>all</b> of <b>her cosmetic treatments, but</b> she must <b>leave</b> out <b>a small matter</b> to remember the destruction of the Temple. The Gemara interjects: <b>What</b> is <b>this</b> small matter? <b>Rav said:</b> She does not remove hair from the place on the <b>temple</b> from which women would remove hair. The source for these practices is a verse, <b>as it is stated: “If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its cunning. Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth,</b> if I remember you not; if I set not Jerusalem above my highest joy” (Psalms 137:5–6).

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Above my highest [<i>rosh</i>] joy? Rav Yitzḥak says: This</b> is referring to the <b>burnt ashes</b> that are customarily placed <b>on the head [<i>rosh</i>] of bridegrooms</b> at the time of their wedding celebrations, to remember the destruction of the Temple. <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Where are they placed?</b> Abaye replied: <b>On</b> the <b>place</b> where <b>phylacteries</b> are placed, <b>as it is stated: “To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them a garland in place of ashes”</b> (Isaiah 61:3). Since phylacteries are referred to as a garland (see Ezekiel 24:17), it may be inferred from this verse that the ashes were placed in the same place as the phylacteries.

### Part 18
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And anyone who mourns for</b> the destruction of <b>Jerusalem</b> will <b>merit and see its joy, as it is stated: “Rejoice with Jerusalem,</b> and be glad with her, all that love her; rejoice for joy with her, all that mourn for her” (Isaiah 66:10).

### Part 19
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sota</i> 15:10) that <b>Rabbi Yishmael ben Elisha said: From the day that the Temple was destroyed, by right, we should decree upon ourselves not to eat meat and not to drink wine, but</b> the Sages <b>do not issue a decree upon the public unless a majority of the public is able to abide by it.</b>

### Part 20
<b>And from the day that the wicked kingdom,</b> i.e., Rome, <b>spread, who decree evil and harsh decrees upon us, and nullify Torah</b> study <b>and</b> the performance of <b>mitzvot for us, and do not allow us to enter</b> the celebration of the first <b>week of a son,</b> i.e., circumcision, <b>and some say: To</b> enter the celebration of the <b>salvation of</b> a firstborn <b>son; by right we should</b> each <b>decree upon ourselves not to marry a woman and</b> not <b>to produce offspring, and it will turn out</b> that the <b>descendants of Abraham our forefather will cease</b> to exist <b>on their own,</b> rather than being forced into a situation where there are sons who are not circumcised.

### Part 21
<b>But</b> concerning a situation such as this, the following principle is applied: <b>Leave the Jews alone</b> and do not impose decrees by which they cannot abide. <b>It is better that they be unwitting</b> sinners, who do not know that what they are doing is improper considering the circumstances, <b>and not be intentional</b> wrongdoers, who marry and procreate despite knowing that they should not.
