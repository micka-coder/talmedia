### Part 1
<b>that this land is</b> formerly <b>mine, and</b> that <b>you</b> did <b>not purchase it from me? Go</b> away; <b>I am not legally answerable to you. Rava said:</b> The claimant <b>stated the <i>halakha</i> to</b> the possessor, as this is a legitimate claim, and Rava accepted his claim.

### Part 2
There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: What do you want with this land</b> of mine? The possessor <b>said to him: I purchased it from so-and-so and</b> then <b>I</b> worked and <b>profited from it</b> for <b>the years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. The claimant <b>said to him: So-and-so is a robber</b> who robbed me of the field, and he did not have the authority to sell it to you.

### Part 3
The possessor <b>said to him: But I have witnesses that I came</b> and <b>consulted with you, and you said to me: Go purchase</b> the land, indicating that you conceded that he had the authority to sell it. The claimant <b>said to him:</b> The reason that I advised you to purchase it was because <b>the second</b> person, i.e., you, the possessor, <b>is amenable to me,</b> while <b>the first,</b> i.e., the purported thief, <b>is more difficult than he,</b> i.e., I prefer to litigate with you rather than with him. <b>Rava said:</b> The claimant <b>stated the <i>halakha</i> to</b> the possessor, as this is a legitimate claim, and Rava accepted his claim.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is Rava’s statement? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Admon? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 109a): With regard to <b>one who contests</b> ownership <b>of a field,</b> claiming that a field possessed by someone else actually belongs to him, <b>and</b> the claimant himself <b>is signed as a witness on</b> the bill of sale of the field to that other person, <b>Admon says:</b> His signature does not disprove his claim of ownership of the property, as it is possible that the claimant said to himself: <b>The second</b> person <b>is amenable to me</b> to deal with, as I can reason with him, while <b>the first</b> owner, who sold the field to the current possessor, <b>is more difficult</b> to deal with <b>than he. And the Rabbis say: He lost his right</b> to contest, as he signed a bill of sale that states that the field belongs to the possessor. Rava’s ruling appears to be in accordance with the individual opinion of Admon, and not with the opinion of the Rabbis.

### Part 5
The Gemara explains: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that Rava’s ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. There,</b> in the case of the mishna in tractate <i>Ketubot</i>, by signing the bill of sale the claimant <b>performed an action</b> indicating that the field was not his <b>for</b> the benefit of the possessor of the field, <b>but here,</b> in Rava’s case, there was no action, only <b>speech,</b> and <b>a person is apt to casually say</b> statements, and he does not lose his right by virtue of this.

### Part 6
There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: What do you want with this land</b> of mine? The possessor <b>said to him: I purchased it from so-and-so and</b> then <b>I</b> worked and <b>profited from it</b> for <b>the years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. The claimant <b>said to him: So-and-so is a robber</b> who robbed me of the field, and he did not have the authority to sell it to you. The possessor <b>said to him: But I have witnesses that you came</b> to me <b>at night and you said to me: Sell it to me,</b> indicating that it is not your land, as if it were yours, you would have demanded that I return it without your paying for it. The claimant <b>said to him: I said</b> to myself: Let me <b>purchase</b> the benefit of avoiding <b>my litigation</b> in order to reclaim my land. <b>Rava said: A person is apt</b> to pay money <b>to purchase</b> the benefit of avoiding <b>his litigation.</b>

### Part 7
There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: What do you want with this land</b> of mine? The possessor <b>said to him: I purchased it from so-and-so and</b> then <b>I</b> worked and <b>profited from it</b> for <b>the years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, indicating that he possessed it for three years, as this is the minimum number of years required for establishing the presumption of ownership. The claimant <b>said to him: But I am holding a document</b> stating <b>that I purchased it from</b> that seller <b>four years</b> ago. Therefore, if it was sold to you three years ago, as you claim, he did not have the authority to sell it at that time.

### Part 8
The possessor <b>said to him: Do you maintain</b> that when I said: I profited from the land for <b>the years</b> necessary <b>for</b> establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, that <b>I was saying</b> I worked and profited from the land for precisely <b>three years?</b> What <b>I</b> actually <b>was saying</b> was that I worked and profited from the land for <b>many years</b> and thereby established the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. Since my purchase predated yours, it was effective. <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>common</b> for <b>people to refer to many years</b> as: <b>Years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, and his claim is accepted.

### Part 9
The Gemara comments: <b>And this matter</b> applies <b>only</b> if <b>he profited</b> from the land for <b>seven</b> years, so <b>that presumptive</b> ownership <b>of this</b> possessor <b>preceded the document of that</b> claimant.
