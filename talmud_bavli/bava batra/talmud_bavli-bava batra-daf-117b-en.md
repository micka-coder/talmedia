### Part 1
<b>Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>was divided to these and to those, so as to uphold these two verses. How so?</b> If one <b>was from</b> among <b>those who left Egypt, he takes his portion</b> along <b>with those who left Egypt.</b> If one <b>was from</b> among <b>those who entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>he takes his portion</b> along <b>with those who entered Eretz</b> Yisrael. If one was <b>from</b> both <b>here and there,</b> i.e., he was among those who left Egypt and also entered Eretz Yisrael himself, <b>he takes his portion from here and there,</b> as he is entitled to two portions.

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to the twelve <b>spies</b> sent to survey Eretz Yisrael prior to the Jewish people’s entry into the land, <b>Joshua and Caleb took</b> all of the spies’ <b>portions</b> of the land. Additionally, the <b>protesters and the assembly of Korah did not have a portion of Eretz</b> Yisrael. Nevertheless, their <b>sons took</b> portions of the land <b>in the merit of their paternal grandfathers and in the merit of their maternal grandfathers</b> if they were among those who left Egypt. This concludes the Gemara’s citation of the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> verse, which states: <b>“According to the names of the tribes of their fathers</b> they shall inherit” (Numbers 26:55), <b>is written with regard to those who left Egypt; perhaps</b> the verse <b>was stated</b> in reference <b>to</b> the progenitors of the <b>tribes,</b> and teaches that the land should be divided among the twelve tribes? The Gemara answers: The inference is from a verse, <b>as it is written:</b> “And I will bring you in to the land, concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; <b>and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am the Lord”</b> (Exodus 6:8). This verse states that Eretz Yisrael <b>is an inheritance for you from your forefathers, and</b> this verse <b>was told to those who left Egypt,</b> indicating that those who left Egypt inherit the land.

### Part 4
The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the following series of questions posed by Rav Pappa to Abaye relating to the division of Eretz Yisrael: <b>To the more; Zelophehad; and Joseph; contested; Manasseh; will count.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara presents the first question. <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>was divided among those who left Egypt, this is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “To the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance”</b> (Numbers 26:54). The verse may be understood as teaching the novelty that even though the number of Jewish people entering Eretz Yisrael differed from the number who left Egypt, the land is nevertheless divided according to the numbers at the time of the Exodus, not according to the count at the time they received the land.
