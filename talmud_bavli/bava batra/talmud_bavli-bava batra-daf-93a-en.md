### Part 1
<b>what is the reason</b> that the sale is not considered to be a mistaken transaction? Is it <b>not because a majority</b> of slaves <b>are like this,</b> i.e., either thieves or gamblers? Apparently, the majority is followed in monetary matters.

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>No,</b> it is because <b>all</b> slaves <b>are like this.</b> Accordingly, no proof can be drawn as to whether we follow the majority in monetary matters.

### Part 3
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another challenge to Rav’s opinion from a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 46a): In the case of an innocuous <b>ox that gored</b> and killed <b>a cow, and</b> the cow’s <b>fetus was found</b> dead <b>at its side, and it is not known whether</b> the cow <b>calved before</b> the ox <b>gored it</b> and the fetus’ death was unrelated to the goring, <b>or whether it calved after</b> the ox <b>gored it</b> and the fetus died on account of the goring, the ox’s owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage for the cow,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> for an innocuous ox (see Exodus 21:35), <b>and one-quarter</b> of the cost of the damage <b>for the offspring.</b> Since it is uncertain whether the ox caused the death of the fetus, its owner pays for half of the standard liability of half the cost of the damage.

### Part 4
The Gemara explains the proof from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But why,</b> according to Rav, should he only pay for one-quarter of the damage to the fetus? Since there is an uncertainty, <b>let us say: Follow</b> the <b>majority of cows, and</b> since the <b>majority of cows become pregnant and calve</b> live offspring, one should conclude that <b>this</b> cow, which did not, <b>certainly miscarried due to</b> the ox <b>goring</b> it, and the ox’s owner should be liable for half the cost of the fetus. Since that line of reasoning is not applied here, it is apparent that the majority is not followed in monetary matters.

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>There,</b> the reason that the ox’s owner pays for only one-quarter of the damage for the fetus is <b>due</b> to the fact <b>that we are uncertain</b> about how it died, <b>as it is</b> possible <b>to say</b> that the ox <b>approached</b> the cow <b>from its front and</b> it was <b>due to</b> the cow’s <b>fright,</b> not due to the goring, that <b>it miscarried,</b> meaning that the ox’s owner would not be liable; <b>and it is</b> also possible <b>to say that</b> the ox <b>approached</b> the cow <b>from behind it and gored it, and</b> that is why the cow <b>miscarried.</b> Accordingly, the payment for such damage constitutes <b>property of uncertain ownership, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>all property of uncertain ownership is divided</b> equally between the two parties.

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this dispute between Rav and Shmuel <b>is parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>an ox that was grazing and</b> another <b>ox</b> that <b>was found killed at its side, even though this</b> dead ox <b>has been gored and that</b> grazing ox <b>is forewarned with regard to goring,</b> or <b>this</b> dead ox <b>has been bitten and that</b> grazing ox <b>is forewarned with regard to biting,</b> nevertheless <b>one does not say</b> that <b>it is evident that this</b> grazing ox <b>gored</b> the dead ox <b>or that</b> grazing ox <b>bit it,</b> despite the fact such behavior is typical for the ox; rather, one cannot draw any definite conclusions. <b>Rabbi Aḥa says</b> that in the case of a rutting male <b>camel that is rampaging among</b> other <b>camels and</b> another <b>camel</b> that <b>was found killed at its side, it is evident that this</b> rampaging camel <b>killed it,</b> as such behavior is typical for a rutting camel. Therefore, the owner of that camel is liable.

### Part 7
Those who suggested the parallel between the tannaitic dispute and the dispute between Rav and Shmuel <b>assumed that a majority and</b> a logical <b>presumption</b> about whether an event will happen <b>are equivalent</b> in their capacity to determine the facts of a case. Consequently, <b>let us say</b> that <b>Rav, who says</b> that one follows the majority in monetary matters, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Aḥa,</b> who follows a presumption to determine the facts of a case, <b>and</b> that <b>Shmuel, who says</b> that one does not follow the majority in monetary matters, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who does not follow a presumption.

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you: I am stating</b> my ruling <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> as <b>the first <i>tanna</i> says</b> that one cannot draw a definite conclusion <b>only there,</b> in the case of the grazing ox, <b>as we do not follow a presumption</b> in monetary matters, <b>but</b> he concedes that <b>we follow the majority</b> in monetary matters.

### Part 9
<b>And Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you: I am stating</b> my ruling <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Aḥa,</b> as <b>Rabbi Aḥa says</b> that one can draw a definite conclusion <b>only there,</b> in the case of the camels, <b>since we follow a presumption</b> in monetary matters, <b>as</b> this camel <b>itself is presumed,</b> based on its behavior, to be the killer. <b>But</b> he concedes that <b>we do not follow the majority</b> in deciding monetary matters.

### Part 10
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another challenge to Rav’s opinion from the mishna: With regard to <b>one who sells produce to another</b> that is sometimes purchased for consumption and sometimes for planting, <b>and</b> the buyer <b>planted it and it did not sprout, and even</b> if he had sold <b>flaxseeds,</b> which are rarely sold as food, the seller <b>does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for them.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara explains the proof: <b>What</b> novelty is indicated by saying: <b>Even</b> if he had sold flaxseeds? Is it <b>not</b> that <b>even</b> where he sold <b>flaxseeds, of which the majority is purchased for planting, and</b> they were not suitable for that purpose, <b>nevertheless</b> the sale stands because <b>we do not follow the majority</b> in monetary matters?

### Part 12
The Gemara concedes that the mishna cannot be reconciled with Rav’s opinion, but suggests that there are other <i>tanna’im</i> who hold in accordance with his opinion. It <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who sells produce to another, and</b> the buyer <b>planted it and it did not sprout,</b> if the produce was <b>seeds</b> for <b>garden</b> plants, <b>which are not eaten</b> at all, then the seller <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility for them.</b> If the produce was <b>flaxseeds,</b> which are only occasionally eaten, then the seller <b>does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for them. Rabbi Yosei says:</b>
