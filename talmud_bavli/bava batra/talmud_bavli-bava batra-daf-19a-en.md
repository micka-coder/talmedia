the bees will <b>not find it; if</b> it is referring <b>to a leaf, it will grow back.</b>

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Nor</b> may one set up <b>a launderer’s pond</b> near his neighbor’s wall unless he distances it three handbreadths from the wall. <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: They taught this only with regard to a soaking pond,</b> in which soiled clothes are left to soak for several days. <b>But</b> in the case <b>of a washing pond [<i>hanadyan</i>],</b> where clothes are actively cleaned, <b>four cubits</b> are required. <b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A launderer’s pond</b> must be kept <b>four cubits</b> from one’s neighbor’s wall. <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that one must keep a distance of only <b>three handbreadths? Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that the statement of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> is correct?

### Part 3
<b>And some raise</b> this <b>as a contradiction,</b> and present the mishna and <i>baraita</i> as apparently conflicting sources. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>a launderer’s pond</b> must be kept <b>three handbreadths</b> from his neighbor’s property. <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>four cubits</b> are required? <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the mishna is referring to <b>a soaking pond,</b> which requires three handbreadths; <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a washing pond,</b> in which case four cubits are necessary. <b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Avya, teaches</b> the mishna <b>explicitly</b> as reading: <b>Unless he distanced three handbreadths from the rim of the soaking pond and the wall.</b>

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches that one who digs a pit must distance it three handbreadths from another’s property and <b>plaster</b> it <b>with lime. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: What is the precise wording of the mishna? <b>Did we learn: And plasters with lime,</b> meaning that the walls must be plastered with lime in addition to distancing the pit three handbreadths, <b>or perhaps we learned: Or plasters with lime,</b> i.e., one may plaster the walls with lime instead of digging the pit at a distance of three handbreadths.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: It is <b>obvious that we learned: And plasters with lime, as, if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we learned: Or plasters with lime,</b> which is the same as what is stated in the clause of the mishna discussing olive refuse, <b>if so, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>combine them and teach them</b> together. If the same <i>halakha</i> applied in all circumstances, all of the mishna’s cases could be taught together.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: This is not proof, as <b>perhaps</b> these cases are taught separately <b>because this</b> type of <b>damage is not similar to that</b> type of <b>damage. The first clause</b> of the mishna addresses the issue of <b>damage</b> due <b>to moisture,</b> whereas <b>the last clause</b> addresses the issue of <b>damage</b> due <b>to heat.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>rock that</b> is so soft it <b>crumbles in</b> one’s <b>hands, this one digs his pit from here,</b> on his property, <b>and that one digs his pit from there. This one distances</b> his pit <b>three handbreadths and plasters with lime, and that one distances</b> his pit <b>three handbreadths and plasters with lime.</b> The Gemara analyzes this ruling: The specific <b>reason</b> one must also plaster with lime is that he is using rock that <b>crumbles in</b> one’s <b>hands,</b> from which it may be inferred that if it is rock that <b>does not crumble in</b> one’s <b>hands,</b> one would <b>not</b> be required to plaster with lime as well.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: One could say that <b>the same is true,</b> i.e., <b>that even though</b> he is using rock <b>that does not crumble in</b> one’s <b>hands,</b> he must <b>also plaster with lime. And it was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to mention the case of rock that <b>crumbles in</b> one’s <b>hands,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it crumbles in</b> one’s <b>hands, let us require a greater distance.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches that <b>one must distance the solid residue</b> of produce that has been pressed free of its oil, <b>and</b> animal <b>manure, and salt, and lime, and rocks</b> three handbreadths from the wall of another, or plaster its receptacle with lime. The Gemara comments: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Shabbat</i> 47b): <b>With what</b> substances <b>may one insulate</b> a pot of cooked food on Shabbat eve, <b>and with what</b> substances <b>may one not insulate</b> it?

### Part 10
<b>One may insulate</b> the pot <b>neither with the solid residue</b> of produce that has been pressed free of its oil, <b>nor with manure, nor with salt, nor with lime, nor with sand, whether</b> those materials are <b>moist</b> or <b>whether</b> they are <b>dry.</b> All of these materials spontaneously generate heat when piled up for an extended period of time. Therefore, they add heat to the pot they insulate. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different here that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>rocks and it does not teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>sand, and what is different there that it teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>sand and it does not teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>rocks?</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rav Yosef says:</b> There is a practical reason for this difference. Rocks are not mentioned there <b>because it is not customary for people to insulate</b> food <b>with rocks. Abaye said to him: And is it customary for people to insulate</b> food <b>with wool fleece and tabs of purple wool? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may insulate</b> food <b>with wool fleece; with combed wool clumps,</b> which are unwoven; <b>with tabs of purple wool; and with</b> swatches of <b>soft material; but</b> one <b>may not move them</b> on Shabbat because they are set-aside [<i>muktze</i>].

### Part 12
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that the <i>tanna</i> follows the biblical aphorism in the verse that states: <b>“Its neighbor tells about him”</b> (Job 36:33), i.e., one example is mentioned and the same applies to the other case. <b>He taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>rocks here and the same is true of sand; he taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>sand there and the same is true of rocks. Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>If</b> this is correct, that <b>“its neighbor tells about him,” let him teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>all of</b> these examples <b>in one</b> case, <b>and let him teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> of just <b>one in the other</b> case, <b>and</b> it can be said that <b>the same is true</b> with regard <b>to the others.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rather, Rava said: There, this is</b> the <b>reason that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>rocks: Because they break,</b> i.e., scratch, <b>the pot,</b> and consequently people do not use them for insulating food at all. <b>Here, this is</b> the <b>reason that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>sand: Because it heats hot</b> items <b>and cools cold</b> items, and therefore it does not cause any damage to the wall.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>But Rabbi Oshaya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that one must distance <b>sand</b> from his neighbor’s wall. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> it is referring <b>to damp</b> sand, which must be kept at a distance due to its moisture. The Gemara challenges: <b>Let the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>also teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of sand <b>and we will interpret it</b> as referring <b>to damp</b> sand. The Gemara answers: This <i>tanna</i> <b>already taught</b> the case of <b>a water channel,</b> which is a source of dampness, and therefore there was no need to mention damp sand as well.

### Part 15
The Gemara rejects this answer: That is incorrect, as <b>is that to say</b> that the mishna includes only one example of a source of dampness? <b>Doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the case of <b>a water channel? And</b> yet <b>it</b> also <b>teaches</b> the example of <b>a launderer’s pond.</b> This demonstrates that the mishna teaches many cases, despite the similarity between them, and therefore it should have mentioned the <i>halakha</i> in the case of sand as well.

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: Both of <b>those</b> particular examples <b>are necessary, as, had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> only the case of <b>a water channel,</b> one would have claimed that a distance must be kept <b>because it is fixed,</b> i.e., water constantly passes through it. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a launderer’s pond, which is not fixed,</b> as it sometimes holds water and sometimes does not, one might <b>say</b> that one need <b>not</b> distance it from his neighbor’s property. <b>And</b> conversely, <b>had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> only the case of <b>a launderer’s pond,</b> one might have said that this must be distanced <b>because</b> its water <b>is fixed and standing</b> in one location and therefore leaks out. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a water channel,</b> one might say distancing it is <b>not</b> required. Consequently, <b>it is necessary</b> to state both examples. By contrast, including the <i>halakha</i> in the case of sand would not add any novel understanding.

### Part 17
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One must distance seeds,</b> i.e., one may not plant seeds, <b>and</b> one may not operate <b>the plow,</b> and one must eliminate urine, three handbreadths from the wall of another. The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary to mention <b>seeds?</b> Let him <b>derive this</b> requirement to distance the seeds <b>due to</b> the requirement to distance <b>a plow,</b> as in any event the ground must be plowed before it can be sown? The Gemara answers: This is referring to planting <b>with a single hand motion,</b> which is performed without plowing.

### Part 18
The Gemara further challenges: The mishna teaches that one must distance <b>a plow; but</b> let him <b>derive this</b> requirement to distance a plow <b>due to</b> the requirement to distance the <b>seeds,</b> as plowing is preparation for planting. The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to one who plows</b> to prepare the ground <b>for trees.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> if so, let him <b>derive this</b> requirement to distance a plow due to the requirement to distance the <b>water.</b> If there are trees, there must be a water channel to irrigate them, and arranging one’s field in such a manner should be prohibited for that reason. The Gemara answers: <b>The <i>tanna</i> is referring to Eretz Yisrael,</b> concerning <b>which it is written: “And drinks water as the rain of heaven comes down”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:11). In Eretz Yisrael, water channels were not needed.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that seeds</b>
