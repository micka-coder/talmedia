### Part 1
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If the debtor has property,</b> in <b>both this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, i.e., whether the guarantor is a standard guarantor or an unconditional guarantor, the creditor <b>cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from</b> either type of guarantor.

### Part 2
<b>Rabba bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Wherever Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel taught</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>in</b> the corpus of <b>our Mishna,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion, <b>except for</b> the following three cases: The responsibility of the <b>guarantor, and</b> the incident that occurred in the city of <b>Tzaidan</b> (see <i>Gittin</i> 74a), <b>and</b> the dispute with regard to <b>evidence</b> in the <b>final</b> disagreement (see <i>Sanhedrin</i> 31a).

### Part 3
§ The Gemara discusses which expressions confer upon a person the status of a standard guarantor, and which confer the status of an unconditional guarantor. <b>Rav Huna says</b> that if one says to a potential creditor: <b>Lend</b> money to <b>him and I</b> am <b>a guarantor,</b> or: <b>Lend</b> money to <b>him and I</b> will <b>repay</b> the debt, or: <b>Lend</b> money to <b>him and I</b> am <b>obligated</b> to repay the debt, or: <b>Lend</b> money to <b>him and I</b> will <b>give</b> the money back to you, <b>all these are expressions</b> that confer the status of a standard <b>guarantee.</b>

### Part 4
If one says: <b>Give</b> money <b>to him and I</b> am <b>an unconditional guarantor,</b> or: <b>Give</b> money <b>to him and I</b> will <b>repay</b> the debt, or: <b>Give</b> money <b>to him and I</b> am <b>obligated</b> to repay the debt, or: <b>Give</b> money <b>to him and I</b> will <b>give</b> the money back to you, <b>all these are expressions</b> that confer the status of <b>an unconditional guarantee.</b> The usage of the word give, as opposed to lend, confers the status of an unconditional guarantor.

### Part 5
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if one says: <b>Lend</b> money to <b>him and I</b> am <b>an unconditional guarantor?</b> On the one hand, the word lend is used, as opposed to give, but on the other hand, he explicitly states that he will be an unconditional guarantor. What is the <i>halakha</i> if one says: <b>Give</b> money <b>to him and I</b> am <b>a guarantor?</b> On the one hand, the word give is used, as opposed to lend, but on the other hand, he states that he will be a guarantor.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> in resolving this dilemma: When one employs <b>the language of</b> a standard <b>guarantee,</b> it is a standard <b>guarantee,</b> even if he also used the word give. And when one employs <b>the language of an unconditional guarantee,</b> it is <b>an unconditional guarantee,</b> even if he also used the word lend.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ḥisda says: All of</b> the expressions mentioned in this discussion <b>are expressions of an unconditional guarantee, except for: Lend</b> money to <b>him and I</b> am <b>a guarantor.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rava says: All</b> of the expressions mentioned in this discussion <b>are expressions of</b> a standard <b>guarantee, except for: Give</b> money <b>to him and I</b> will <b>give</b> the money back to you.

### Part 9
<b>Mar bar Ameimar said to Rav Ashi: My father said the following:</b> If one says: <b>Give</b> money <b>to him and I</b> will <b>give</b> the money back to you, this expression binds the guarantor to such an extent that <b>the lender has no</b> claim <b>against the debtor at all;</b> his only option is to collect the debt from the guarantor.

### Part 10
The Gemara rejects this last statement: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so.</b> Rather, <b>the debtor is not exempted from</b> dealing with the <b>creditor unless</b> the guarantor <b>takes</b> the money from the creditor <b>and gives</b> it to the debtor <b>with</b> his own <b>hand.</b>

### Part 11
§ The Gemara relates: There was once <b>a certain judge who permitted a creditor to enter the debtor’s property</b> and collect it for his debt <b>before lodging a claim against the debtor</b> himself. <b>Rav Ḥanin, son of Rav Yeiva,</b> overruled that judge and <b>expelled</b> the creditor from the seized property.

### Part 12
When <b>Rava</b> heard about this he <b>said: Who</b> is <b>wise</b> enough <b>to perform such a matter,</b> i.e., to issue this ruling, <b>if not Rav Ḥanin, son of Rav Yeiva? He holds that a person’s property is a guarantee for him,</b> i.e., it acts as a guarantor for the loan if the debtor does not repay it; <b>and we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One who lends</b> money <b>to another with</b> the assurance of <b>a guarantor cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor. And we established</b> that the mishna means that he <b>cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor at the outset,</b> before seeking payment from the debtor himself. So too, he cannot collect the debt by taking the debtor’s property without first seeking payment from the debtor himself.

### Part 13
§ The Gemara relates: There was once <b>a certain guarantor for orphans</b> whose father borrowed money and died, and the orphans were minors, and this guarantor <b>repaid</b> the debt <b>to the creditor before informing the orphans</b> that he was repaying the debt for them. The guarantor now sought reimbursement from the orphans.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Pappa said: Repaying a creditor</b> is <b>a mitzva, and orphans</b> who are minors <b>are not obligated in performing a mitzva.</b> They therefore do not have to repay any debts owed by their deceased father until they reach the age of majority.

### Part 15
<b>And Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> also <b>said</b> that the orphans do not have to repay the guarantor until reaching majority, but for a different reason: <b>Say</b> that perhaps the deceased <b>gave bundles</b> of money <b>to</b> his creditor before his death, and therefore some or all of the debt has been paid. As long as they are minors, the heirs would not be aware of this payment, but upon reaching majority there is a chance that they may examine their father’s papers and discover that their father had done this. Therefore, payment is deferred until they reach majority.
