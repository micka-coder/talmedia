### Part 1
<b>Here,</b> in Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, it is a case <b>where he is shouting</b> in protest <b>at the outset.</b> As soon as he is given the deed of gift he states that he does not want it. In this case, he does not receive the property. <b>There,</b> in Shmuel’s statement, it is a case <b>where he is initially silent</b> when he receives the deed of gift, <b>and is ultimately shouting</b> in protest that he does not want it. In this case he acquires the gift before he protests, so it is his.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says</b> that if the owner <b>transfers ownership</b> of the property <b>to him through another</b> person, who performs an act of acquisition for this other party in his presence, <b>and he was initially silent,</b> i.e., when the act of acquisition is performed, <b>but ultimately shouted</b> in protest when the property is actually given to him, <b>we have arrived at the dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 3
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:1): If <b>one wrote</b> a document granting <b>his property to another, and there were slaves</b> among his property, <b>and the other</b> person <b>said: I do not want them, if their second master,</b> i.e., the recipient, <b>was a priest, they partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, as his protest is ignored. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Once the other</b> person <b>said: I do not want them, the</b> giver or his <b>heirs have already acquired them,</b> and they are the slaves’ owners.

### Part 4
<b>And we discussed</b> the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> does <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> hold that he acquires them <b>even</b> if <b>he is standing and shouting</b> in protest that he does not want them? That is not reasonable.

### Part 5
<b>Rava says, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> who says: <b>In</b> a case <b>where he is shouting</b> in protest <b>at the outset,</b> when he is given the gift, <b>everyone agrees that he did not acquire</b> them. In a case where <b>he was silent</b> at the time <b>and ultimately shouted</b> in protest, <b>everyone agrees that he acquired</b> them.

### Part 6
<b>When they disagree</b> it is in a case <b>when he transfers ownership to him through another</b> person, and the recipient was there <b>and was silent, and ultimately,</b> when he actually receives the slaves, he <b>shouted</b> in protest. <b>As the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>once he was</b> initially <b>silent, he acquired them, and</b> the fact <b>that he is shouting</b> indicates that <b>he is retracting</b> his initial acceptance of the gift. His acquisition cannot be canceled in this manner. If he does not want to own the slaves, he can sell them, give them away, or emancipate them.

### Part 7
<b>And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds</b> that <b>his ultimate</b> actions <b>prove</b> the nature of <b>his initial</b> intent; he never intended to acquire the slaves. <b>And</b> the reason <b>that he did not shout</b> in protest <b>until now</b> is <b>that he reasoned: As long as they did not enter my possession,</b> to <b>what</b> end <b>will I shout?</b>

### Part 8
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:6): If <b>a person on his deathbed said: Give two hundred dinars to so-and-so, and three hundred to so-and-so, and four hundred to so-and-so,</b> in this case one <b>does not say</b> that <b>whoever appears first in the deed acquires</b> his money first. <b>Therefore,</b> if <b>a promissory note emerged against</b> the one who gave the gifts, and it becomes clear that the money given was pledged to a creditor, then the creditor <b>collects from all of them.</b>

### Part 9
<b>But</b> if a person on his deathbed <b>said: Give two hundred dinars to so-and-so, and after him, to so-and-so, and after him, to so-and-so,</b> then one <b>says: Anyone who appears first in the deed gains. Therefore,</b> if <b>a promissory note emerged against</b> the giver, the creditor first <b>collects from the last</b> one of the recipients. If <b>he does not have</b> enough to repay the debt, <b>he collects from the previous</b> recipient. If <b>he does not have</b> enough to repay the debt, <b>he collects from</b> the recipient listed <b>before the previous</b> recipient.

### Part 10
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there was <b>a person on his deathbed who said: Give two hundred dinars to so-and-so, my firstborn son, as is appropriate for him,</b> the firstborn <b>takes</b> the two hundred dinars <b>and takes his portion as a firstborn</b> as well. <b>If he said:</b> Give my firstborn son two hundred dinars <b>for his portion as a firstborn,</b> he does not receive both, but <b>he has the advantage;</b> if <b>he wants, he takes</b> the two hundred dinars, and if <b>he wants, he takes his portion as a firstborn.</b>

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> similarly, if there was <b>a person on his deathbed who said: Give two hundred dinars to so-and-so, my wife, as is appropriate for her, she takes</b> the two hundred dinars <b>and takes</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract</b> as well. <b>If he said:</b> Give her two hundred dinars as payment <b>for her marriage contract,</b>
