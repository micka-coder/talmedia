### Part 1
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages with regard to the statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: If one sold <b>a house,</b> i.e., a lower story, <b>to one</b> person <b>and</b> stated that the upper <b>story</b> will be sold <b>to one</b> other person, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Is this</b> considered <b>reserving</b> additional rights for the second person apart from the upper story, <b>or not? If you say</b> that in a case where one sells his <b>house to one and</b> the upper <b>story to one,</b> his stipulation <b>is not</b> considered <b>reserving</b> rights for the second person, there is another dilemma. If one sold a house <b>except for</b> the upper <b>story,</b> reserving the upper story for himself, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this considered reserving additional rights for himself?

### Part 2
<b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> Even <b>if you say</b> that where one sells the <b>house to one</b> person <b>and</b> the upper <b>story to one</b> other person, he <b>is not</b> considered to be <b>reserving</b> rights for the second person, if one sold a house <b>except for</b> the upper <b>story,</b> he <b>is</b> considered to be <b>reserving</b> additional rights for himself. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Zevid, who says</b> that the reason the seller reserves additional rights is <b>that if</b> he <b>wants to extend projections from</b> the upper story into the space of the courtyard, <b>he may extend</b> them.

### Part 3
The Gemara concludes: <b>Evidently, since he reserved</b> the upper <b>story, he also reserved the place of the projections. Here too,</b> with regard to the one who gave a palm tree to another and reserved the fruit for himself, <b>since he said</b> that the tree is given to another <b>except for its fruit, he reserved the place of the fruit</b> for himself as well.

### Part 4
§ The mishna (146b) states that if a person on his deathbed granted all of his property to others but reserved for himself any amount of land, his gift is valid even if he recovers. If he did not reserve for himself any amount of land, his gift is not valid if he recovers. <b>Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> In the case of <b>a person on his deathbed who wrote</b> a deed granting <b>all of his property to others,</b> the manner in which he divided his property <b>is examined. If</b> it appears <b>that he was</b> intending <b>to divide</b> his entire estate among various recipients, then if <b>he dies, all</b> the recipients <b>acquire</b> their gifts. If he <b>recovers,</b> he can <b>retract all</b> of the gifts, in accordance with the ruling of the mishna.

### Part 5
But <b>if</b> it appears <b>that he was reconsidering</b> the matter, initially intending to give away only a portion of his property, and then reconsidering and distributing the rest, then if <b>he dies, all</b> of the recipients <b>acquire</b> their gifts. If <b>he recovers, he can retract only the last</b> gift, as the previous gifts were given with the intent to reserve part of the property for himself, and they are valid even if he recovers. The Gemara asks: <b>Perhaps</b> he was not reconsidering; rather, he initially intended to transfer ownership of all of his property, and <b>he was considering</b> to whom to give each portion <b>and then giving</b> it. The Gemara answers: <b>The usual</b> way <b>of a person on his deathbed is to consider</b> the matter <b>carefully</b> first <b>and</b> only <b>then</b> to <b>confer</b> his gifts. Therefore, if he pauses to consider in the interim, it appears that he did not initially intend to transfer ownership of his entire estate.

### Part 6
§ <b>Rav Aḥa bar Minyumi says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> With regard to <b>a person on his deathbed who wrote</b> a deed granting <b>all of his</b> generally known <b>property to others, and</b> he then <b>recovered, he cannot retract</b> it, as <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he has property in another province</b> that he reserved for himself, in which case the gift is valid even if he recovered.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> as for <b>the mishna, which teaches:</b> If <b>he did not reserve</b> for himself <b>any amount of land,</b> and he recovered, <b>his gift is not valid, how can you find these</b> circumstances? <b>Rav Ḥama said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where he says: All my property</b> is given to so-and-so, in which case he clearly reserved nothing for himself. <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where our presumption is that he does not have</b> property elsewhere.

### Part 8
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed, <b>is a partial retraction</b> of the gift considered <b>a retraction of the entire</b> gift, <b>or</b> it is <b>not</b> considered a retraction of the entire gift? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If one gave <b>all</b> of his property <b>to the first</b> recipient <b>and</b> then he partially retracted his gift and gave <b>part</b> of his property <b>to the second</b> recipient, <b>the second acquired</b> his gift, but <b>the first did not acquire</b> anything. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the giver <b>died,</b> and the reason that the first recipient does not acquire anything is that a partial retraction is considered a retraction of the entire gift?

### Part 9
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the giver <b>recovered.</b> The first gift was invalidated, because he left nothing for himself, whereas the second gift remained valid, since he gave only part of his property. Had he died, the first recipient would have received the remainder, as the giver retracted only part of the first gift, which he gave to the second recipient.

### Part 10
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to understand the <i>baraita</i> in this manner. <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the last clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches:</b> If he gave <b>part</b> of his property <b>to the first</b> recipient, <b>and</b> then he gave <b>all</b> of his property <b>to the second</b> recipient, <b>the first</b> recipient <b>acquired</b> his gift, but <b>the second did not acquire</b> anything. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> the giver <b>recovered, due to that</b> reason <b>the second</b> recipient <b>did not acquire</b> the gift. <b>But if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where he died, both of them should acquire</b> their gifts.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi: And even</b> if the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where he recovered,</b> one can prove that a partial retraction is considered a retraction of the entire gift. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>a partial retraction is</b> considered <b>a retraction of the entire</b> gift, <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that at least the second</b> recipient <b>acquired</b> the gift, as the giver reserved part of his property for himself. <b>But if you say</b> that <b>a partial retraction is not</b> considered <b>a retraction of the entire</b> gift, the giver <b>should be</b> considered <b>as one who was dividing</b> all of his property between the two recipients, <b>and neither of them should acquire</b> their gifts.

### Part 12
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a partial retraction is</b> considered <b>a retraction of the entire</b> gift. <b>You find</b> the <i>halakha</i> that is stated in <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>both</b> in a case <b>where</b> the giver <b>died and</b> in a case <b>where he recovered. You find</b> the <i>halakha</i> that is stated in <b>the last clause only</b> in a case <b>where he recovered.</b>

### Part 13
§ A series of <b>dilemmas were raised before</b> the Sages: If a person on his deathbed <b>consecrated all of his property</b> to the Temple treasury <b>and</b> subsequently <b>recovered, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that in <b>any</b> case <b>that concerns consecrated</b> property the assumption is that he <b>resolves to transfer</b> the property unconditionally, and therefore the consecration is valid even if he recovers? <b>Or perhaps</b> in <b>any</b> matter <b>that concerns himself</b> he <b>does not resolve to transfer</b> the property unconditionally.

### Part 14
Furthermore, if a person on his deathbed <b>declared all of his property ownerless, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since</b> declaring his property ownerless is <b>for</b> the benefit of <b>the poor as well as the rich,</b> it involves the potential mitzva of providing for the poor, and therefore the assumption is that <b>he resolves to transfer</b> the property, i.e., declare it ownerless, unconditionally? <b>Or perhaps</b> in <b>any</b> matter <b>that concerns himself he does not resolve to transfer</b> the property unconditionally.

### Part 15
Furthermore, if a person on his deathbed <b>divided all of his property to</b> be distributed to <b>the poor, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that with regard to <b>charity</b> the assumption is that <b>he certainly resolves to transfer</b> the property unconditionally? <b>Or perhaps</b> in <b>any</b> matter <b>that concerns himself he does not resolve to transfer</b> the property unconditionally. The Gemara concludes: These dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 16
The Gemara presents <b>another version</b> of this series of dilemmas: If a person on his deathbed <b>consecrated all of his property</b> to the Temple treasury, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he <b>declared all of his property ownerless, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he <b>divided all</b> of <b>his property to</b> be distributed to <b>the poor, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? These dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> If one says: So-and-so <b>shall take</b> my property, <b>or:</b> So-and-so <b>shall gain possession</b> of my property, <b>or:</b> So-and-so <b>shall take possession</b> of my property, <b>or: He shall acquire</b> my property, <b>all of</b> these <b>are terms</b> that denote the bestowal <b>of gifts.</b> It <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> If one says: So-and-so <b>shall receive as an inheritance, or:</b> So-and-so <b>shall inherit,</b> these are <b>also</b> valid terms denoting inheritance <b>in</b> the case of <b>one who is fit to inherit</b> from <b>him. And this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> who holds that one can bequeath all of his property to one of his sons using terms that denote inheritance, not only using terms that denote the bestowal of a gift.

### Part 18
A series of <b>dilemmas were raised before</b> the Sages:
