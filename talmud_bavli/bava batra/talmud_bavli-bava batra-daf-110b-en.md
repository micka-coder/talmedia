### Part 1
<b>who</b> then <b>should inherit? Is that to say that the ruler of the city should inherit?</b> Rav Pappa said to him: <b>This is what I</b> meant to <b>say:</b> If <b>there is a son and a daughter, this</b> one <b>should not inherit all of</b> the estate, <b>and that</b> one <b>should not inherit all of</b> the estate, <b>but they should inherit it</b> in <b>equal</b> portions <b>to one another.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Abaye said to him: But is the verse necessary</b> in order <b>to teach us that when he has only one child,</b> that child <b>should inherit all of his property?</b> If you say that the right of the son and daughter to the inheritance is equal, then the verse: “If a man dies, and has no son” (Numbers 27:8), which teaches that when there is no son his daughter inherits, is superfluous. Rav Pappa responded: <b>And perhaps this</b> verse <b>teaches us this: That a daughter is also subject to</b> receiving <b>inheritance.</b> The Gemara replies: No, the verse does not need to teach us this, since <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And every daughter who possesses an inheritance”</b> (Numbers 36:8), which clearly states that a daughter is subject to receiving inheritance.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that a son inherits his father’s estate and precedes a daughter is derived <b>from here,</b> in the passage in the Torah where the daughters of Zelophehad request their father’s inheritance in Eretz Yisrael. They said to Moses: <b>“Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he has no son?”</b> (Numbers 27:4). Rabbi Aḥa ben Ya’akov infers: <b>The reason</b> they requested the inheritance is <b>that,</b> as they said: He <b>has no son.</b> One can infer: <b>But</b> if <b>he has a son,</b> the <b>son takes precedence</b> and the daughters would not have requested an inheritance.

### Part 4
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But perhaps</b> it was <b>the daughters of Zelophehad who said this,</b> i.e., that they were entitled to an inheritance only because their father had no son. They thought that this was the <i>halakha</i> based on the custom at that time, but after God spoke to Moses, the <b>Torah was given and a <i>halakha</i> was initiated</b> that a daughter’s right to inherit is equal to that of the son. The Gemara accepts this difficulty and states: <b>Rather, it is clear</b> that the source for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>as we answered initially,</b> i.e., as Abaya derived from the verse of: “If a man dies, and has no son, then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8).

### Part 5
<b>Ravina said:</b> The source for the <i>halakha</i> that a son precedes a daughter is <b>from here: “Who is next to him [<i>hakkarov elav</i>]”</b> (Numbers 27:11), teaching that the <b>closer [<i>karov</i>]</b> one is to the deceased, the <b>earlier</b> one is in the order of inheritance, and a son of the deceased is considered to be a closer relative to the deceased than the daughter.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> demonstrates the <b>closeness of a son more than</b> that of <b>a daughter? That a son stands in place of his father to designate</b> a Hebrew maidservant as a wife for himself <b>and with regard to an ancestral field.</b> The Gemara rejects this: This is not a valid proof, as <b>designation</b> cannot demonstrate that a son is a closer relative; <b>a daughter is not subject to designation,</b> because she obviously cannot marry the Hebrew maidservant. With regard to <b>an ancestral field as well, the <i>tanna</i> establishes his</b> ruling that a son is a closer relative than others <b>from this</b> same <b>refutation: Is there levirate marriage except in a case where there is no son?</b> And this applies also where there is no daughter. <b>Rather, it is clear</b> that the source for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>as we answered initially.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the <i>halakha</i> that a son precedes a daughter is derived <b>from here,</b> in the passage in the Torah addressing the inheritance of slaves, which states: <b>“And you may make them an inheritance for your sons [<i>livneikhem</i>] after you”</b> (Leviticus 25:46). One can infer: <b>“Your sons,” but not your daughters.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then when the verse states: <b>“That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your sons [<i>beneikhem</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21), should one infer that <b>this too</b> means: <b>“Your sons,” but not your daughters?</b> Is it not obvious that daughters are also worthy of receiving the blessing of longevity?

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>A blessing is different.</b> In a verse that speaks of blessings, the term <i>beneikhem</i> should be understood in its broader sense, as “your children.” In a verse that speaks of a <i>halakha</i>, it is to be understood in the narrower sense of “your sons.”

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And paternal brothers inherit</b> from one another <b>and bequeath</b> to each other. <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabba said:</b> It <b>is derived from</b> a verbal analogy between the word: <b>Brothers,</b> stated with regard to inheritance, and the word: <b>Brothers,</b> found in the verses concerning <b>Jacob’s sons.</b> When Jacob’s sons speak to Joseph, they state: “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 42:13), and in the passage discussing inheritance the verse states: “And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers” (Numbers 27:10). <b>Just as there,</b> in the verse concerning Jacob’s sons, the word brothers is referring to <b>paternal</b> brothers <b>and not maternal</b> brothers, as the twelve of them shared only the same father, <b>so too here,</b> where this term is used with regard to inheritance, the verse is referring to <b>paternal</b> brothers <b>and not maternal</b> brothers.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>But why do I</b> need this proof from the verse concerning Jacob’s sons? <b>It is written</b> in the passage concerning inheritance: “Then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him <b>of his family, and he shall inherit it”</b> (Numbers 27:11). When the term “family” is used in the Bible, one’s <b>father’s family is called</b> one’s <b>family,</b> while one’s <b>mother’s family is not called</b> one’s <b>family,</b> so that in all matters of inheritance, it is the patrilineal relatives who are taken into account.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so</b> that the verbal analogy is not needed to teach the <i>halakha</i> of inheritance, <b>and when Rabba’s</b> explanation <b>was stated,</b> it <b>was stated with regard to the matter of levirate marriage,</b> teaching that levirate marriage is performed only by a paternal brother but not by a maternal brother.

### Part 12
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And a man</b> with regard to <b>his mother</b> inherits from her relatives but does not bequeath to her. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught:</b>
