### Part 1
<b>who threw turnip</b> seeds <b>in the crevices [<i>filei</i>] of the land of a convert</b> who died without heirs, it <b>is not</b> sufficient to <b>take possession. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>As at the time that</b> he <b>threw</b> the seeds <b>there was no enhancement</b> to the value of the field. <b>Now that</b> the turnips have grown and the value of the field <b>is enhanced, it is enhanced by itself.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara records a series of rulings with regard to taking possession of land. <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>this one who cuts</b> the branches of <b>a palm tree,</b> if he had <b>in mind</b> the acquisition <b>of the palm tree,</b> he <b>has acquired</b> it; but if he had <b>in mind</b> the benefit <b>of the animals,</b> to feed his animals the branches, he <b>has not acquired</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which it can be known what he had in mind? The Gemara answers: If he <b>took</b> branches <b>from this side and from that side,</b> he had <b>in mind</b> the acquisition <b>of the palm tree,</b> as this assists the growth of the tree; but if the branches that he took were <b>all from one side,</b> he had <b>in mind</b> the benefit <b>of the animals.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And Shmuel says</b> with regard to <b>this one who clears [<i>dezakkei zikheya</i>]</b> a field of trees, if he had <b>in mind</b> the improvement <b>of the field,</b> to prepare it for plowing, <b>he has acquired</b> it; but if he had <b>in mind</b> the collection <b>of the wood, he has not acquired</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which it can be known what he had in mind? The Gemara answers: If he <b>took large and small</b> pieces of wood, he had <b>in mind</b> the improvement <b>of the field;</b> however, if <b>he took</b> the <b>large</b> pieces of wood <b>but left</b> the <b>small</b> ones, he had <b>in mind</b> the collection <b>of the wood.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And Shmuel says</b> with regard to <b>this one who removes protuberances</b> and levels the ground, if he had <b>in mind</b> the improvement <b>of the field,</b> to prepare it for plowing, he <b>has acquired</b> it; but if he had <b>in mind</b> the conversion <b>of</b> the field into <b>a threshing floor, he has not acquired</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which it can be known what he had in mind? The Gemara answers: If he <b>took a mound and threw it in a ditch,</b> thereby leveling both areas, he had <b>in mind</b> the improvement <b>of the field;</b> but if he leveled the ground with <b>a mound in</b> the place of <b>a mound and a ditch in</b> the place of <b>a ditch,</b> expanding each area but leaving the field as a whole uneven, he had <b>in mind</b> the conversion <b>of</b> the field into <b>a threshing floor.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And Shmuel says</b> with regard to <b>this one who opened</b> a blockage and enabled <b>water</b> to enter <b>into</b> a section of <b>land,</b> if he had <b>in mind</b> the improvement <b>of the field,</b> to irrigate it, he <b>has acquired</b> it; but if he had <b>in mind</b> the catching <b>of the fish,</b> i.e., to enable the water to flow in so that he could catch the fish therein, he <b>has not acquired</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which it can be known what he had in mind? The Gemara answers: If he <b>opened two gates, one bringing in</b> the water <b>and one taking out</b> the water, this indicates that he had <b>in mind</b> the catching <b>of the fish,</b> as the water will flow out of the field, giving him the means to catch the fish; but if he opened only <b>one gate,</b> this indicates that he had <b>in mind</b> the improvement <b>of the field.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain woman who profited</b> from an ownerless <b>palm tree by cutting</b> its branches for <b>thirteen years. Another</b> then <b>came</b> and <b>plowed beneath it a bit.</b> The case <b>came before Levi, and some say</b> that it came <b>before Mar Ukva,</b> who <b>established</b> the property <b>in</b> the <b>possession</b> of the one who plowed. The woman <b>came</b> and <b>shouted before him,</b> protesting the perceived injustice of his ruling. Mar Ukva <b>said to her: What can I do for you, as you did not take possession</b> of the property <b>in the manner that people take possession?</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav says: One who draws an image,</b> e.g., he paints an image on the wall, <b>on the property of a convert</b> who died without heirs <b>has acquired</b> it, <b>as Rav</b> himself <b>acquired the garden of the house</b> of <b>Rav,</b> which had been ownerless property, <b>only by</b> drawing <b>an image.</b>

### Part 8
ยง <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>a field</b> that is <b>defined by its boundaries,</b> i.e., it has clearly demarcated boundaries on all sides, <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: Once he struck</b> the land with a hoe <b>one</b> time, he <b>acquired the entire</b> property. <b>And Shmuel says</b> that he <b>has acquired only the place</b> that <b>he struck</b> with the hoe.
