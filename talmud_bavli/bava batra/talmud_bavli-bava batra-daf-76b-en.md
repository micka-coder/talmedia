### Part 1
<b>until he pulls it, or until he rents its place.</b> How, then, can the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> be ascribed to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi?

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; here,</b> where Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi states that a ship is acquired through passing, he is referring to a ship situated <b>in the public domain.</b> Since a ship in the public domain cannot be acquired through pulling, which must be performed in a domain that is in one’s possession, it is acquired through passing. By contrast, <b>there,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, the ship is situated <b>in an alleyway [<i>simta</i>],</b> which is not the public domain, as both parties have the right to keep their possessions there. A ship in this location must be acquired through pulling.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>To what</b> case <b>did you interpret that last</b> <i>baraita</i> to be referring? It was interpreted as referring <b>to the public domain.</b> If so, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> it <b>until he pulls it</b> or until he rents its place. The Gemara asks: <b>But if</b> the ship is situated <b>in the public domain, from whom can he rent</b> the place? <b>And furthermore, does pulling in the public domain effect acquisition? But don’t Abaye and Rava both say</b> with regard to the different methods of acquisition: <b>Passing effects acquisition in the public domain or in a courtyard that does not belong to either of</b> the parties; <b>pulling effects acquisition in an alleyway or in a courtyard that belongs to both of</b> the parties; <b>and lifting effects acquisition in every place,</b> even in the seller’s domain.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean <b>when it says: Until he pulls it, and what</b> does it mean <b>when it says: Until he rents its place? This</b> is what it <b>is saying:</b> The buyer does not acquire the ship <b>until he pulls it from the public domain into an alleyway. And if</b> the ship <b>is</b> located in <b>the domain</b> of some other <b>owner,</b> the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> it <b>until he rents its place</b> from the owner.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Abaye and Rava state</b> their opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, not that of the Rabbis? The <i>baraita</i> indicates that only Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi maintains that one can acquire ownership by means of passing in the public domain.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The Rabbis agree that it is possible to effect acquisition in the public domain through the act of passing. Therefore, <b>if</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>says to him: Go take possession and</b> thereby <b>effect acquisition, so too</b> he can effect acquisition through the act of passing, and does not need to pull it. <b>Here</b> the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, as <b>we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>says to him: Go pull and</b> thereby <b>effect acquisition</b> of it.

### Part 7
Rav Ashi elaborates: One <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that the seller is <b>particular</b> about the method by which the item is acquired, and therefore it can be acquired only through pulling. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that the seller is merely <b>indicating the manner to him,</b> i.e., he advises him to use this act of acquisition but he does not mind if the buyer prefers to perform a different act of acquisition.

### Part 8
§ The Gemara returns to the issues of acquiring promissory notes. <b>Rav Pappa says: One who sells</b> a promissory <b>note to another must write to him: Acquire it and all liens on property that are</b> contained <b>within it. Rav Ashi said: I stated</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> before Rav Kahana, and I said to him</b> the following analysis: <b>The reason</b> the buyer acquires it is <b>that</b> the seller <b>wrote this for him.</b> This indicates that if <b>he did not write this for him,</b> the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> the monetary rights recorded in the promissory note.

### Part 9
Rav Ashi asks: Why, then, did he purchase the promissory note? <b>But does he require</b> it <b>to tie around the mouth of his flask</b> as a stopper? Clearly, he purchased the document for the purpose of collecting the debt recorded in it. Rav Pappa <b>said to me: Yes,</b> it is possible that he purchased the promissory note in order <b>to tie</b> it around his flask. Since the owner did not transfer ownership of the obligation recorded in the promissory note, the buyer acquires only the paper itself.
