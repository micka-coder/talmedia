### Part 1
<b>and tomorrow,</b> i.e., in the future, <b>I will bring a claim</b> against <b>him in court, it is</b> a valid <b>protest.</b>

### Part 2
If the one lodging a protest also <b>said: Do not tell</b> the possessor of the protest, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Zevid said:</b> It is not a valid protest, because <b>isn’t he saying: Do not tell him?</b> Therefore, word of the protest will not reach the possessor and it is meaningless. <b>Rav Pappa</b> disagreed and <b>said</b> that the owner merely meant: <b>Do not tell him personally,</b> but they, i.e. the witnesses, should <b>tell others.</b> In that case, word of the protest will reach the possessor, since <b>your friend has a friend</b> whom he tells about the protest, <b>and your friend’s friend has a friend</b> whom he tells about the protest; therefore, it is a valid protest.

### Part 3
If the witnesses before whom the owner lodged the protest <b>said to him: We</b> are <b>not</b> going to <b>tell</b> the possessor about your protest, what is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Zevid said:</b> It is not a valid protest, and he has to lodge a protest before other witnesses, as are <b>they</b> not <b>saying to him: We are not</b> going to <b>tell him</b> about your protest? <b>Rav Pappa</b> disagreed and <b>said</b> that they merely meant: <b>We</b> are <b>not</b> going to <b>tell him personally,</b> but <b>we are</b> going to <b>tell others.</b> In that case, word of the protest will reach the possessor, since <b>your friend has a friend</b> whom he tells about the protest, <b>and your friend’s friend has a friend</b> whom he tells about the protest; therefore, it is a valid protest.

### Part 4
If the one lodging the protest also <b>said to them: A word [<i>shuta</i>] should not emerge from you</b> about this, what is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Zevid said:</b> It is not a valid protest, as <b>isn’t he saying</b> to them: <b>A word should not emerge</b> from you? Similarly, if the people before whom he protested <b>said to him: We will not</b> have <b>a word emerge</b> from us, <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is not a valid protest, as <b>aren’t they saying to him: We will not</b> have <b>a word emerge</b> from us? <b>Rav Huna, the son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> disagreed and <b>said:</b> It is a valid protest, because with regard to <b>any matter that</b> is <b>not</b> actually <b>incumbent on a person</b> to keep secret, it is likely that he will <b>say it</b> to others <b>unawares,</b> and therefore the presumption is that word will reach the possessor.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: A protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in</b> the <b>presence</b> of the possessor <b>is</b> a valid <b>protest. Rava raised an objection to</b> what <b>Rav Naḥman</b> said from the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that establishing the presumption of ownership requires <b>three years only in order that</b> if the owner <b>will be in Spain and</b> another <b>possesses</b> his field for <b>a year,</b> people <b>will go and inform</b> the owner by the end of the next <b>year, and</b> the owner will <b>come</b> back <b>in</b> the <b>following year</b> and take the possessor to court. <b>And if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> that <b>a protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence is</b> a valid <b>protest, why do I</b> need the owner <b>to come? Let him remain there in his place and protest.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> Rabbi Yehuda wishes to <b>teach us good advice, that he</b> should <b>come and collect the land and</b> its <b>produce.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>From the fact</b> that <b>Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman, it may be inferred that</b> he does <b>not hold that a protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence is</b> a valid <b>protest. But doesn’t Rava say: A protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence is</b> a valid <b>protest?</b> The Gemara answers: He <b>held that</b> conclusion only <b>after</b> he <b>heard this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from Rav Naḥman.</b>

### Part 7
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, encountered</b> the <b>students of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> and <b>said to them: Did Rabbi Yoḥanan say in</b> the presence of <b>how many</b> people <b>a protest</b> must be lodged? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says: <b>A protest</b> must be lodged <b>in the presence of two</b> people. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said: <b>A protest</b> must be lodged <b>in the presence of three</b> people.

### Part 8
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say that they disagree with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rabba bar Rav Huna? As Rabba bar Rav Huna says: Any matter that is said in the presence of three</b> people
