<b>and by</b> means of <b>a bill</b> of sale.

### Part 2
The Gemara clarifies the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Letters</b> in promissory notes, <b>who mentioned</b> anything about <b>them?</b> Why would Rabbi Natan speak about promissory notes, which are not discussed by the first <i>tanna</i>? The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete, and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching: A ship is acquired by pulling, and letters,</b> i.e., the content of a promissory note, <b>are acquired by</b> merely <b>transferring</b> the document, not through pulling. <b>Rabbi Natan says: A ship and letters are acquired by pulling and</b> also <b>by</b> means of <b>a bill</b> of sale.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a bill</b> of sale <b>for a ship?</b> A ship <b>is movable property,</b> which is acquired not by means of giving a bill of sale, but through other acts of acquisition. <b>Rather, is it not</b> correct to say that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching: A ship is acquired by pulling, and letters</b> of credit <b>by passing. Rabbi Natan says: A ship</b> is acquired <b>by pulling, and letters,</b> i.e. the contents of a promissory note, are acquired either through pulling or <b>by</b> means of <b>a bill</b> of sale.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: If Rabbi Natan holds that <b>a ship</b> is acquired <b>by pulling,</b> his opinion <b>is</b> apparently identical to the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>. Rather,</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> the two opinions is the dispute <b>of Rav and Shmuel.</b> According to the opinion of one <i>tanna</i> the buyer must move the entire ship out of its current location, while the other <i>tanna</i> maintains that one must move the ship only a minimal amount. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, everyone,</b> Rabbi Natan and the first <i>tanna</i>, holds <b>either in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, or in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel. And with regard to a ship, everyone agrees</b> that it is acquired through pulling.

### Part 5
<b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> acquiring <b>letters,</b> i.e. the contents of a promissory note. <b>And this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Natan is saying to the first <i>tanna</i>: With regard to a ship, I certainly concede to you</b> that it is acquired by pulling. But <b>with regard to letters,</b> whereas you maintain that passing suffices to acquire them, I hold that <b>if</b> in addition <b>there is a bill</b> of sale, <b>yes,</b> the acquisition is valid, but <b>if not,</b> the act of passing is <b>not</b> effective.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> according to this interpretation, the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Natan disagree <b>with regard to the dispute</b> between <b>these <i>tannaâ€™im</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Letters,</b> i.e., the contents of a promissory note, <b>are acquired by</b> merely <b>transferring</b> the document; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say: Whether one wrote</b> a bill of sale <b>but did not transfer</b> the promissory note to the buyer, or <b>whether he transferred</b> the promissory note <b>but did not write</b> a bill of sale, the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> the documents <b>until</b> the seller both <b>writes</b> a bill of sale <b>and transfers</b> the promissory note.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with which</b> opinion <b>did you interpret</b> the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> of the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>? If it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, then <b>let a ship be acquired also by passing,</b> not only through pulling, as stated in the following <i>baraita</i>. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A ship is acquired by passing;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The buyer <b>does not acquire</b> it
