<b>And if he brought fifty-</b>tenths <b>in one vessel and fifty in one vessel, he fulfilled</b> his obligation. One can infer from the <i>baraita</i> that after the fact, <b>if he</b> had <b>brought</b> fifty-tenths in each vessel, <b>yes,</b> he fulfilled his obligation, but he may <b>not</b> do so <b><i>ab initio</i>. And if it should enter your mind</b> to say that <b>every case like this is</b> divided <b>half and half,</b> it should be permitted to divide the meal-offering into equal halves <b>even <i>ab initio</i>.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara dismisses Rabbi Zeira’s objection: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of the meal-offering, <b>it is clear to us that this person initially intended to</b> bring <b>a large offering, and</b> the reason <b>that he said</b> he will bring the offering <b>in two vessels</b> was <b>that he knew that it is not possible to bring</b> the entire offering <b>in a single vessel.</b> Therefore, <b>we bring,</b> in a single vessel, <b>as much as</b> it <b>is possible to bring,</b> which is sixty-tenths. In any other case it is possible that the division should be into two equal portions.

### Part 3
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef</b> in three matters where he disagreed with Rabba: <b>In</b> the matter of dividing <b>a field</b> between brothers (see 12b); in the matter of whether certain actions are limited by the court session or by the <b>topic</b> of discussion in the court (see 114a); <b>and</b> in the matter of <b>half,</b> i.e., this matter, whether an unspecified division into two parts is divided into two equal halves.

### Part 4
§ The Gemara cites additional incidents concerning a gift whose method of division was not specified: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who sent swaths of silk to his home</b> as a gift. <b>Rabbi Ami says</b> that in such a case, <b>those</b> swaths that are <b>suitable for</b> the <b>sons’</b> garments are given <b>to the sons,</b> and those that are <b>suitable for</b> the <b>daughters’</b> garments are given <b>to the daughters.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>We said this only when he does not have daughters-in-law, but if he has daughters-in-law,</b> it is presumed that <b>he sent</b> it <b>for his daughters-in-law. And if his daughters are not married,</b> it is presumed that <b>he does not forsake his daughters and send to his daughters-in-law,</b> so the silk is given to his daughters.

### Part 5
There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who said to</b> those surrounding him: I leave <b>my property to my sons [<i>levanai</i>],</b> and <b>he had</b> only <b>a son and a daughter.</b> The question was raised: <b>Do people call</b> a single <b>son</b> in the plural: <b>My sons, and</b> in his will <b>he came to remove his daughter</b> even <b>from the tenth</b> of his property that would rightfully be her dowry? <b>Or perhaps people do not call</b> a single <b>son: My sons, and he came to include</b> his <b>daughter in the gift?</b>

### Part 6
<b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that one does refer to a single son using the plural term sons, as it is written: <b>“And the sons of Dan: Hushim”</b> (Genesis 46:23). <b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>Perhaps</b> this verse should be understood <b>as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught,</b> that Hushim is not the name of Dan’s son but <b>that they,</b> Dan’s sons, <b>were as numerous as</b> the <b>groups [<i>ḥushim</i>] of reeds. Rather, Rava said:</b> One can prove this usage of the term sons in the verse: <b>“And the sons of Pallu: Eliab”</b> (Numbers 26:8). <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This can be proven from another verse: <b>“And the sons of Ethan: Azariah”</b> (I Chronicles 2:8).

### Part 7
There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who said to</b> those surrounding him: I leave <b>my property to my sons,</b> and <b>he had a son and a grandson,</b> i.e., his son’s son. The question was raised: Do <b>people call a grandson a son, or</b> do they <b>not? Rav Ḥaviva said: People call a grandson a son. Mar bar Rav Ashi said: People do not call a grandson a son.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Mar bar Rav Ashi:</b> With regard to <b>one prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from</b> a certain person’s <b>sons,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for him to derive benefit <b>from</b> the <b>sons of</b> that person’s <b>sons,</b> as they are not included in the term sons.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who</b> died and <b>left</b> behind <b>adult and minor sons,</b> if <b>the adult</b> sons <b>enhanced the property, they enhanced</b> it so that the profit goes <b>to the middle,</b> i.e., it is distributed among all the heirs. <b>If</b> the adult sons <b>said</b> from the outset: <b>See that which</b> our <b>father left</b> behind; <b>we are</b> going to <b>engage</b> in business with our share of the property <b>and profit</b> from it, then <b>they enhanced</b> the property <b>for themselves. And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>a wife who enhanced the property</b> of her deceased husband, <b>she enhanced</b> it so that the profit goes <b>to the middle,</b> i.e., it is divided between her and the heirs. <b>If she said: See that which my husband left me; I am</b> going to <b>engage</b> in business with my share <b>and profit</b> from it, then <b>she enhanced</b> the property <b>for herself.</b>

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Ḥaviva, son of Rav Yosef, son of Rava, says in the name of Rava: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to <b>where the property was enhanced on account of the property,</b> i.e., the heirs invested money from the common inheritance in order to enhance the property, and their input was only in the management of its investment. <b>But</b> if the <b>property was enhanced on their account,</b> i.e., on account of the efforts or expenditure of the adult sons, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>they enhanced</b> it <b>for themselves.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rabbi Ḥanina say: Even</b> if <b>their father left them nothing but</b>
