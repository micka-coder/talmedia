### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>But let us say</b> that this is <b>the dispute between Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis,</b> as it was concluded previously that according to Rabbi Shimon himself, even the carob and sycamore trees are not consecrated. The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish <b>teaches us this, that Rabbi Menaḥem, son of Rabbi Yosei, holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> and therefore Rabbi Shimon is not the only Sage who holds this opinion.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who sells a ship has sold</b> along with it <b>the <i>toren</i>, and the <i>nes</i>, and the <i>ogin</i>, and all</b> of the equipment that is used for <b>directing it. But he has not sold the slaves</b> who serve as oarsmen, <b>nor the packing bags</b> that are used for transporting goods, <b>nor the <i>antikei</i></b> on the ship. <b>And when one said to</b> the buyer: You are purchasing <b>it,</b> the ship, <b>and all that it contains, all of these</b> latter elements <b>are</b> also <b>sold.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The <b><i>toren</i></b> is the <b>mast [<i>iskarya</i>]. And</b> in this regard <b>it states: “They have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts [<i>toren</i>] for you”</b> (Ezekiel 27:5). The <b><i>nes</i></b> is the <b>sail, and</b> in this regard <b>it states: “Of fine linen with richly woven work from Egypt was your sail, that it might be to you for an ensign [<i>nes</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 27:7). With regard to the meaning of <b><i>ogin</i>, Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches: These are</b> the ship’s <b>anchors, and</b> so <b>it states: “Would you tarry for them until they were grown? Would you shut yourselves off for them [<i>te’agena</i>] and have no husbands?”</b> (Ruth 1:13). This demonstrates that the root <i>ayin</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>nun</i>, means being shut up and held firmly in one place.

### Part 5
The mishna teaches that the buyer acquires all the equipment used for <b>directing</b> the ship. <b>Rabbi Abba says: These are the</b> ship’s <b>oars. And</b> this is as <b>it states: “Of the oaks of Bashan they have made your oars”</b> (Ezekiel 27:6). Since a verse discussing ships focuses on its oars, evidently the oars are an integral part of the ship. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is demonstrated <b>from here: “And all that handle the oar,</b> the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, <b>shall come down from their ships”</b> (Ezekiel 27:29).

### Part 6
<b>The Sages taught: One who sells a ship has</b> also <b>sold the gangway [<i>iskala</i>]</b> used for boarding the ship, <b>and the water tank it contains. Rabbi Natan says: One who sells a ship has sold the</b> ship’s <b>boat [<i>bitzit</i>],</b> which is used as a lifeboat or for fishing in shallow waters. <b>Sumakhos says: One who sells a ship has sold the <i>dugit</i>,</b> as explained below.

### Part 7
<b>Rava said:</b> The <b><i>bitzit</i> is</b> the same as the <b><i>dugit</i>. Rabbi Natan was a Babylonian,</b> and therefore <b>he called</b> small boats <b><i>butzit</i>, as people say: The <i>botziata</i>,</b> small boats, <b>of Miashan. Sumakhos, who was from Eretz Yisrael, called</b> these boats <b><i>dugit</i>, as it is written:</b> “You shall be taken away with hooks, <b>and your residue in fishing boats [<i>duga</i>]”</b> (Amos 4:2).

### Part 8
§ The Gemara cites several incidents that involve ships and the conversation of seafarers. <b>Rabba said: Seafarers related to me</b> that when <b>this wave that sinks a ship appears with a ray of white fire at its head, we strike it with clubs that are inscribed</b> with the names of God: <b>I am that I am, <i>Yah</i>, the Lord of Hosts, amen amen, Selah. And</b> the wave then <b>abates.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabba said: Seafarers related to me</b> that in a certain place <b>between</b> one <b>wave and</b> the next <b>wave</b> there are <b>three hundred parasangs, and the height of a wave is three hundred parasangs. Once,</b> seafarers recounted, <b>we were traveling along the route and a wave lifted us up until we saw the resting place of a small star, and it</b> appeared <b>to me</b> the size of the area needed for <b>scattering forty <i>se’a</i> of mustard seeds. And if it had lifted us higher, we would have been scorched by the heat</b> of the star.

### Part 10
<b>And the wave raised its voice</b> and shouted <b>to another</b> wave: <b>My friend, did you leave anything in the world that you did not wash away, that I may come and destroy it?</b> The second wave <b>said to it: Go out</b> and <b>see the greatness of your Master,</b> God, as even when there is <b>as much as a string of sand</b> on the land <b>I cannot pass, as it is stated: “Will you not fear Me, said the Lord; will you not tremble at My presence? Who has placed the sand for the bound of the sea, an everlasting ordinance, which it cannot pass?”</b> (Jeremiah 5:22).

### Part 11
§ <b>Rabba said: I have seen</b> the one called <b>Hurmin, son of Lilith, when he was running on the pinnacles of the wall of</b> the city of <b>Meḥoza, and a horseman was riding an animal below him but was unable</b> to catch up to <b>him. Once, they saddled for him two mules and they stood</b>
