### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>But let us say</b> that this is <b>the dispute between Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis,</b> as it was concluded previously that according to Rabbi Shimon himself, even the carob and sycamore trees are not consecrated. The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish <b>teaches us this, that Rabbi Menaá¸¥em, son of Rabbi Yosei, holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> and therefore Rabbi Shimon is not the only Sage who holds this opinion.
