### Part 1
The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation</b> of the opinions <b>of all</b> the <i>amora’im</i> who held that a person who became blind after witnessing a matter can, in certain cases, testify about it, is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>

### Part 2
§ <b>Rabbi Abba sent</b> another ruling <b>to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama: One who says</b> something <b>concerning</b> one <b>child among</b> his <b>sons</b> is <b>deemed credible, and Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>he is not deemed credible.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Abba <b>saying? Abaye said</b> that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Abba <b>is saying: One who says concerning</b> one <b>child among</b> his <b>sons: He shall inherit all my property,</b> is <b>deemed credible, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> who holds that one can bequeath all his property to one of his heirs (130a). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>he is not deemed credible, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.

### Part 4
<b>Rava objects to this</b> explanation: According to Abaye’s explanation, <b>this</b> wording: Is <b>deemed credible, and: He is not deemed credible,</b> is not precise; <b>he should have</b> employed the terms: <b>Shall inherit, and: Shall not inherit,</b> as the issue is the ability of the father to specify who will inherit from him, not his credibility.

### Part 5
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Abba <b>is saying: One who says about</b> one <b>child among</b> his <b>sons</b> that <b>he is</b> his <b>firstborn</b> is <b>deemed credible, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> (127b); <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>he is not deemed credible, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda.

### Part 6
§ <b>Rabbi Abba sent</b> another ruling <b>to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama:</b> In a case of <b>one who says: My wife will take</b> a portion of my estate <b>like one of the sons, she takes</b> a portion <b>like one of the sons,</b> as it is considered a gift. <b>Rava says: And</b> this ruling is only <b>with regard to</b> the husband’s <b>current property,</b> which he can give her as a gift. The husband cannot give her a portion of his future property. <b>And</b> furthermore, the calculation of her portion must take into account not only the number of sons the husband has at the time of his statement, but also <b>the sons who come,</b> i.e., who will be born, <b>afterward.</b>

### Part 7
§ <b>Rabbi Abba sent</b> another ruling <b>to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama:</b> In the case of <b>one who produces a promissory note against another,</b> and <b>the creditor says: I was not repaid anything, and the debtor says: I repaid half</b> the debt, <b>and the witnesses testify that</b> the debtor <b>repaid the entire</b> debt, then <b>this</b> debtor <b>takes an oath</b> that he repaid half, as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who admits to a part of a claim, and he is exempt from paying that half. <b>And</b> the creditor <b>collects</b> the second <b>half from unsold property; but not from liened</b> property that was sold after the loan, <b>as</b> the buyers can <b>say: We rely on the witnesses</b> that the debt was repaid in its entirety.

### Part 8
The Gemara compares this <i>halakha</i> to the case of a promissory note that states that the debtor owes the creditor: <i>Sela</i> coins, without stating how many. The creditor claims that he lent the debtor five <i>sela</i> and the debtor claims that he borrowed only three. Rabbi Akiva holds that since the wording of the promissory note indicates a minimum debt of two <i>sela</i>, and the creditor could not have collected the third <i>sela</i> without the debtor’s admission, the latter’s admission to a part of the claim cannot render him liable to take an oath. The Gemara states: <b>And even according to Rabbi Akiva, who says that</b> the debtor is not liable to take an oath, as with regard to the third <i>sela</i> his legal status <b>is</b> similar to that of <b>one who returns a lost item, this statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where there are no witnesses</b> to the loan. <b>But where there are witnesses,</b> as is the case in Rabbi Abba’s ruling, the debtor <b>fears</b> denying the entire debt. Therefore he is liable to take an oath that he repaid half, as one who admits to a part of the claim.

### Part 9
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi objects to this: On the contrary; even according to Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> who disagrees with Rabbi Akiva and <b>says</b> that the debtor <b>is considered</b> one who <b>admits to a part of the claim, this statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where there are no witnesses who support him. But</b> here in the case of Rabbi Abba, <b>where there are witnesses who support him,</b> testifying that he repaid the entire debt, his legal status <b>is certainly</b> that of <b>one who returns a lost item,</b> and he does not need to take an oath that he repaid half.

### Part 10
§ <b>Mar Zutra taught in the name of Rav Shimi bar Ashi: The <i>halakha</i> in all these <i>halakhot</i></b> is <b>as Rabbi Abba sent to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama. Ravina said to Rav Ashi: What</b> about the statement with <b>which Rav Naḥman</b> disagreed, i.e., that a debt can be collected by taking the slaves the debtor left his heirs? Is the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with this ruling of Rabbi Abba as well, despite the principle that in monetary matters the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rav Naḥman’s opinion? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: We teach</b> a different tradition, that Rabbi Abba’s statement rules that a creditor <b>does not collect</b> the debt from the slaves the debtor left his heirs, <b>and</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said the same.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then <b>what</b> possibility <b>does</b> Mar Zutra <b>exclude</b> in ruling that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with Rabbi Abba’s statement?
