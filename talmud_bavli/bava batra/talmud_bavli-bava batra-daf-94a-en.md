### Part 1
must <b>give him the value of wheat</b> of equal volume to the pebble that he removed. Had he not removed the pebble, the owner would have sold his wheat together with the pebble, all for the price of wheat. Accordingly, the removal of the pebble effectively caused the owner a small loss. It is apparent from this ruling that when selling produce, a buyer accepts upon himself that a quantity of dirt may be mixed in.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: With regard to <b>legumes,</b> one accepts <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>, but with regard to <b>dirt,</b> he accepts <b>less than a quarter-</b><i>kav</i>.

### Part 3
<b>And</b> is so that he does <b>not</b> accept <b>a quarter</b>-<i>kav</i> of <b>dirt? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who sells produce to another,</b> if he sells him <b>wheat,</b> the buyer <b>accepts upon himself</b> that <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of legumes</b> may be present <b>in</b> each <b><i>se’a</i></b> of wheat purchased. When purchasing <b>barley, he accepts upon himself</b> that <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of <b>chaff</b> may be present <b>in</b> each <b><i>se’a</i></b> purchased. When purchasing <b>lentils, he accepts upon himself</b> that <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of dirt</b> may be present <b>in</b> each <b><i>se’a</i></b> purchased.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What, is it not</b> that just as the <i>baraita</i> rules with regard to lentils, <b>the same is true for wheat and for barley?</b> The Gemara answers: No, <b>lentils are different, because they are dug up</b> from the ground and dirt can easily get mixed in. Lentils often contain a higher percentage of dirt than do wheat and barley, which are harvested rather than dug up.

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>But</b> according to this, <b>the</b> only <b>reason</b> that a buyer accepts that dirt may be present in lentils but not in wheat and barley is <b>that lentils are dug up</b> from the ground, <b>whereas wheat and barley</b> are <b>not.</b> If so, <b>resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from</b> this <i>baraita</i> and conclude that when purchasing <b>wheat and barley,</b> a buyer <b>does not accept</b> that a quarter-<i>kav</i> of <b>dirt</b> may be present in each <i>se’a</i>.

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Actually,</b> perhaps when purchasing <b>wheat and barley</b> as well, a buyer <b>accepts</b> that a quarter-<i>kav</i> of <b>dirt</b> may be present in each <i>se’a</i>, but <b>it was necessary for</b> the <i>baraita</i> to state the <i>halakha</i> specifically with regard to <b>lentils.</b> This is <b>because</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> lentils <b>are dug up</b> from the ground, the buyer would <b>also accept</b> even <b>more than a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of dirt. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.

### Part 7
§ <b>Rav Huna says: If</b> the buyer <b>comes to sift</b> the produce to check if there is more than the acceptable proportion of impurities and he finds that there is too much, <b>he sifts all of it</b> and returns all the impurities to the seller, not just the amount in excess of a quarter-<i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>. The seller must instead provide produce that is free of any impurities. <b>Some say</b> that this is the strict <b><i>halakha</i>, and some say</b> that it is <b>a penalty.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Some say</b> that this is the strict <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> as <b>one who gives money</b> for produce <b>gives</b> it <b>for good-quality produce</b> containing no impurities at all. Even so, where there is just <b>a quarter</b>-<i>kav</i> of impurities per <i>se’a</i>, <b>a person will not take the trouble</b> to sift the grain to remove the impurities; instead, he accepts the small quantity of impurities that are present. By contrast, where there is <b>more than a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of impurities per <i>se’a</i>, <b>a person will take the trouble</b> to sift the grain to remove the impurities, <b>and once he takes the trouble</b> to sift the grain, he does not stop once he reduces the proportion of impurities to a quarter-<i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>; rather, <b>he takes the trouble</b> to sift <b>all of it.</b> Accordingly, once he has sifted out the impurities, he never agrees to accept any quantity of impurities, and so the seller must take back all the impurities.

### Part 9
<b>And some say</b> it is <b>a penalty.</b> They understand that it is <b>usual</b> for <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of impurities to be present in each <i>se’a</i> of produce, and so it is presumed that a buyer accepts that quantity. <b>More</b> than a quarter-<i>kav</i> <b>is unusual, and</b> consequently the seller is suspected of having deceitfully <b>mixed</b> additional impurities into the produce that he sold. <b>And since</b> the seller deceitfully <b>mixed</b> in impurities, <b>the Sages penalized him</b> by requiring him to pay for <b>all of</b> the impurities present, even those which he did not add.

### Part 10
The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for the cases it will cite: <b>All two documents of Ravin bar Rav Naḥman</b> are <b>exploitation and a contract.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Huna’s ruling from a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 2:1): With regard to <b>any <i>se’a</i></b> of seeds <b>that contains a quarter</b>-<i>kav</i> or more of seeds <b>of a different kind,</b> before sowing such seeds <b>one must reduce</b> the quantity of the other kind of seeds in the mixture so as not to violate the prohibition against growing a mixture of diverse kinds (see Leviticus 19:19). The Gemara explains: It can be <b>assumed that</b> the presence of <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of seeds of a different kind per <i>se’a</i> <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds is as</b> problematic as <b>more than a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of impurities per <i>se’a</i> <b>with regard to</b> a sale, as discussed <b>here, and</b> therefore, since the mishna <b>teaches</b> with regard to diverse kinds only that <b>one must reduce</b> the additional amount, but not that one is required to remove all the seeds of a different kind, it follows that the same is true in the case of a sale, and the seller should not have to take back all of the impurities. This contradicts Rav Huna’s ruling.

### Part 12
The Gemara deflects the challenge: <b>No,</b> this assumption is not necessarily correct; perhaps the presence of <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of seeds of a different kind per <i>se’a</i> <b>with regard to diverse kinds is comparable to a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of impurities per <i>se’a</i> <b>with regard to</b> a sale, as discussed <b>here,</b> and both are considered acceptable levels of admixture.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that a quarter-<i>kav</i> of seeds of a different kind per <i>se’a</i> is acceptable, <b>why</b> does the mishna teach that <b>one must reduce</b> the quantity of seeds of a different kind? The Gemara answers: The requirement is a rabbinic decree <b>due to the severity of</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>If so,</b>
