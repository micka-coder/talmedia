### Part 1
<b>As Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>one who sells, sells generously,</b> so that whatever is not explicitly excluded from the sale is assumed to be sold, <b>while the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>one who sells, sells sparingly,</b> so that whatever is not explicitly included in the sale is assumed to be unsold. <b>And</b> perhaps <b>that which is also stated generally: Rabbi Akiva</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says</b> that <b>one who sells, sells generously,</b> is derived <b>from here.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this opinion and asks: <b>From where</b> do you arrive at such a conclusion? <b>Perhaps</b> Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis do not disagree whether, in principle, a person who sells, sells generously or sparingly, but rather their disagreement is limited to this specific case. As <b>Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>a person does not want to spend his money</b> on the purchase of a house <b>and</b> then have <b>others tread upon his</b> property, and therefore he says that the seller must purchase for himself a path through the buyer’s domain to reach his pit. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>a person does not want to receive money</b> for the sale of his house <b>and</b> then have to <b>fly through the air</b> in order to reach his pit, and therefore they say that the seller presumably withheld for himself a path to his pit.

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> the proof is <b>from the last clause</b> of the mishna, which states: If the seller kept the house but <b>sold</b> the pit and the cistern <b>to another, Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The buyer <b>need not purchase for himself a path</b> through the seller’s domain. <b>But the Rabbis say: He must purchase for himself a path</b> through the seller’s domain. The <i>tanna’im</i> seem to disagree as to whether a person who sells, sells generously or sparingly.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>Perhaps they disagree about</b> the following: <b>Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>we follow the intention of the buyer,</b> as we assume that he would not have bought the pit if he would have to fly through the air to get there. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>we follow the intention of the seller,</b> as presumably he would not have sold the pit if the buyer had the right to tread upon the seller’s property to reach it.

### Part 5
<b>Rather,</b> the proof that these <i>tanna’im</i> disagree whether one who sells, sells generously or sparingly is <b>from this</b> mishna (71a), which teaches: One who sells a field, even if he states that he is selling everything in it to the buyer, has sold <b>neither the cistern, nor the winepress, nor the dovecote, whether</b> it is <b>abandoned or utilized,</b> as these items are not part of the field itself. <b>And</b> the seller <b>must purchase</b> for himself <b>a path</b> through the buyer’s domain to reach whatever remains his. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis say:</b> The seller <b>need not</b> purchase a path through the buyer’s domain.

### Part 6
The Gemara explains the proof: <b>Why do I need this</b> ruling <b>as well,</b> seeing that this case involving the sale of a field appears to be identical to that involving the sale of a house? <b>Rather, is it not teaching us that Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>one who sells, sells generously,</b> and therefore the seller must purchase for himself a path to his property, <b>while the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>one who sells, sells sparingly,</b> and therefore the purchase of such a path is not necessary?

### Part 7
The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>Perhaps</b> the first mishna <b>taught us</b> this dispute with regard to <b>a house, and</b> the later mishna <b>teaches us</b> this dispute with regard to <b>a field. And</b> while this may seem redundant, both rulings are <b>necessary, as had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> only with regard to <b>a house,</b> I would have said that the buyer is particular about people passing through his house, <b>because he desires privacy</b> there. And it is for this reason that Rabbi Akiva says that in the absence of an explicit stipulation, the seller must purchase for himself a path to the pit. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a field,</b> which is exposed to all, <b>say</b> that the buyer is <b>not</b> concerned about privacy.

### Part 8
<b>And,</b> conversely, <b>had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> only with regard to <b>a field,</b> I would have said that the buyer is particular about people passing through his field, <b>because treading</b> upon the field <b>is detrimental to it.</b> And it is for this reason that Rabbi Akiva says that the seller must purchase for himself a path to the pit. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a house,</b> which is not adversely affected by treading through it, <b>say</b> that the buyer is <b>not</b> opposed to the seller passing through.

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> the proof that Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis disagree whether one who sells, sells generously or sparingly is <b>from the latter clause</b> of that mishna (71a), which teaches: But if the seller kept the field but <b>sold</b> the cistern and winepress <b>to another</b> person, <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The buyer <b>need not purchase for himself a path</b> through the seller’s domain to reach what he has bought, since a seller sells generously. <b>But the Rabbis say: He must</b> purchase for himself a path through the seller’s domain.

### Part 10
The Gemara explains the proof: <b>Why do I also</b> need <b>this,</b> seeing as <b>this</b> case involving the sale of a pit or a winepress in a field <b>is</b> identical to <b>that</b> involving the sale of a pit or a cistern in a house? <b>Rather, is it not teaching us that Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>one who sells, sells generously, while the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>one who sells, sells sparingly?</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the latter clauses of these <i>mishnayot</i> that this is so.

### Part 11
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagree about how the <i>halakha</i> should be decided with regard to this issue. <b>Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav says:</b>
