<b>to a bonfire,</b> where the fire is in the center <b>and pots surround it.</b> Similarly, the table of an ignoramus is arranged with the food in the center and is surrounded by plates.

### Part 2
Rabbi Yoḥanan asked: <b>How</b> should <b>the bed of Torah scholars</b> be kept? He replied: It is acceptable <b>as long as there</b> is <b>nothing except sandals beneath it during the summer, and shoes</b> beneath it <b>during the rainy season,</b> i.e., winter. <b>And</b> the bed <b>of an ignoramus</b> is <b>similar to a cluttered [<i>balus</i>] storehouse,</b> as he keeps a wide array of items beneath it.

### Part 3
§ Having mentioned Rabbi Bena’a, the Gemara relates an incident in which he was involved. <b>Rabbi Bena’a was marking</b> burial <b>caves</b> for the purpose of helping to prevent the contracting of ritual impurity. <b>When he arrived at the cave of Abraham,</b> i.e., the Cave of Machpelah, <b>he encountered Eliezer,</b> the <b>servant</b> of <b>Abraham, who was standing before the entrance.</b> Rabbi Bena’a <b>said to him: What is Abraham doing</b> at this moment? Eliezer <b>said to him:</b> He is <b>lying in the arms of Sarah, and she is examining his head.</b>

### Part 4
Rabbi Bena’a <b>said to him: Go tell him</b> that <b>Bena’a is standing at the entrance,</b> so that he should assume an appropriate position to receive a visitor. Eliezer <b>said to him: Let</b> him, i.e., Rabbi Bena’a, <b>enter,</b> since <b>it is known that there is no</b> evil <b>inclination in this</b> higher <b>world,</b> so it is not inappropriate for Rabbi Bena’a to see Abraham and Sarah in this position. He <b>entered, examined</b> the cave in order to measure it, <b>and exited.</b>

### Part 5
<b>When he arrived at the cave of Adam the first</b> man, who is buried in the same area, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said: You gazed upon the likeness of My image,</b> i.e., Abraham, who is similar to the image of Adam the first man. <b>Do not gaze upon My image itself,</b> i.e., Adam the first man, about whom the verse states that he was formed in the image of God (see Genesis 1:27). Rabbi Bena’a said: <b>But I need to mark the cave.</b> The voice said to him: <b>As</b> the measurements of the <b>dimensions of the outer</b> cave where Abraham is buried, <b>so</b> are the measurements of the <b>dimensions of the inner</b> cave, where Adam is buried. The Gemara notes: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that the Cave of Machpelah consists of <b>two chambers, this</b> one <b>above that</b> one, not two adjacent chambers, the voice said: <b>As</b> the measurements of the <b>dimensions of the upper</b> cave where Abraham is buried, <b>so</b> are the measurements of the <b>dimensions of the lower</b> cave. Therefore, there is no need to measure it.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Bena’a says: I gazed at his,</b> Adam’s, <b>two heels, and</b> they shone so brightly that <b>they are similar to two suns.</b> Along these lines, the Gemara states that <b>all</b> people <b>compared to Sarah</b> are <b>like a monkey compared to a human,</b> as Sarah was exceedingly beautiful; <b>Sarah compared to Eve</b> is <b>like a monkey compared to a human; Eve compared to Adam</b> is <b>like a monkey compared to a human;</b> and <b>Adam compared to the Divine Presence</b> is <b>like a monkey compared to a human.</b>

### Part 7
It was also stated that <b>the beauty of Rav Kahana is a semblance of the beauty of Rav. The beauty of Rav is a semblance of the beauty of Rabbi Abbahu. The beauty of Rabbi Abbahu is a semblance of the beauty of Jacob our forefather. The beauty of Jacob our forefather is a semblance of the beauty of Adam the first</b> man.

### Part 8
On the topic of burial caves, the Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain magus [<i>amgusha</i>] who was rummaging</b> through the graves of the <b>dead. When</b> he <b>arrived at the</b> burial <b>cave of Rav Tovi bar Mattana,</b> Rav Tovi <b>grabbed him by his beard</b> and would not release him. <b>Abaye came and said to</b> Rav Tovi: <b>I beg of you</b> to <b>release him.</b> The magus <b>came again in another year,</b> and Rav Tovi <b>grabbed him by his beard. Abaye came</b> and requested that he release him, but Rav Tovi <b>did not release him, until</b> Abaye <b>brought a scissors and cut his beard.</b>

### Part 9
§ The Gemara relates additional incidents involving Rabbi Bena’a: There was <b>a certain</b> individual <b>who said to</b> his family before he died: <b>A barrel of earth to one of my sons, a barrel of bones to one of my sons,</b> and <b>a barrel of wads</b> of wool <b>to one of my sons. They did not know what he was saying to them. They came before Rabbi Bena’a</b> for guidance. Rabbi Bena’a <b>said to them: Do you have land</b> that your father left as an inheritance? <b>They said to him: Yes.</b> He asked: <b>Do you have livestock</b> that your father left as an inheritance? They said: <b>Yes.</b> He asked: <b>Do you have quilts [<i>bistarkei</i>]</b> that your father left as an inheritance? They said: <b>Yes.</b> He said to them: <b>If so, this is what he said to you,</b> i.e., he meant that he is bequeathing land to one son, livestock to the second, and quilts to the third.

### Part 10
There was <b>a certain man who heard his wife saying to her daughter: Why do you not act clandestinely</b> when you engage <b>in forbidden</b> sexual intercourse? <b>That woman has,</b> i.e., I have, <b>ten sons, and I have only one from your father,</b> and no one knows. So too, you must be careful so that no one will discover your illicit behavior. Having overheard that only one son was his, <b>when</b> that man <b>was dying he said to</b> his family: <b>All of my property</b> is left <b>to one son.</b>

### Part 11
<b>They did not know</b> to <b>which of them</b> he intended to leave his property. <b>They came before Rabbi Bena’a</b> for guidance, and <b>he said to</b> the sons: <b>Go strike your father’s grave, until he rises and reveals to you to which of you he left</b> his property. <b>They all went,</b> but <b>that</b> one <b>who was his son did not go.</b> Rabbi Bena’a <b>said to them: All of</b> the <b>property belongs to this</b> son who did not go. The other brothers were angry. <b>They went and slandered [<i>akhlu kuretza</i>]</b> Rabbi Bena’a in <b>the king’s house. They said: There is one man among the Jews who removes money from people without witnesses and without any</b> evidence. The king’s guards <b>brought</b> Rabbi Bena’a <b>and imprisoned him.</b>

### Part 12
<b>The wife of</b> Rabbi Bena’a <b>went</b> and <b>said to</b> the guards: <b>I had one servant. They cut off his head, and skinned him and ate his flesh, and they fill him with water and</b> give their <b>friends to drink from him, and they have not paid me</b> his <b>value nor have they rented him.</b>

### Part 13
<b>They did not know what she was saying to them. They said: Let us bring the wise</b> man <b>of the Jews, and let him say</b> what she meant. <b>They called Rabbi Bena’a,</b> and <b>he said to them: She spoke to you of a water skin [<i>zarnuka</i>].</b> In other words, she was referring to a goat she owned that was slaughtered, its meat eaten, and its skin made into a water skin that could be filled with drinking water. <b>They said: Since</b> he is <b>so wise, let</b> him <b>sit at the gate</b> where the judges congregate <b>and render judgment.</b>

### Part 14
Rabbi Bena’a <b>saw that it was written upon the gate [<i>be’abbula</i>]: Any judge who is summoned to judgment is not considered a judge,</b> as judges must be above reproach. <b>He said to them: If that is so,</b> then if <b>a person comes from elsewhere</b>
