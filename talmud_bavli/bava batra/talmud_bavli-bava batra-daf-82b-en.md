### Part 1
he has acquired an area <b>sufficient for a gatherer of figs and his basket</b> in hand to stand close to the tree. <b>Rabbi Elazar objects to this: Now</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is that the buyer <b>has no path</b> and must purchase a path through the field to access his trees; if so, does <b>he have</b> possession of an area for <b>the gatherer and his basket?</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>He has no path,</b> even though he has no other means of gaining access to the trees, <b>as</b> the ground he acquired along with the trees <b>is</b> considered <b>another land</b> and is not part of the rest of the field. Why, then, would <b>he have</b> possession of an area for <b>a gatherer and his basket?</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Zeira says: From the statement,</b> i.e., the objection, <b>of our teacher, we learn</b> that <b>it is</b> in the case of <b>three</b> trees <b>that</b> the owner of the trees <b>has no path,</b> as the buyer acquired a separate piece of land along with the trees. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>two</b> trees the buyer <b>has</b> a path, <b>as he says to</b> the owner of the field: My trees <b>are standing on your land,</b> and as I am allowed to use your field to tend to my trees I have the right to walk through your land to reach them.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: Shall we say</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar does not</b> accept the opinion <b>of Shmuel,</b> who was <b>his teacher? As Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says: One who sells, sells generously.</b> According to Rabbi Akiva, one sells in a manner that is advantageous for the buyer, and is presumed to have included in the sale even items that were not explicitly specified. In this case, as he has sold a tree that remains on his property, the seller grants the buyer the right to access his tree.

### Part 4
Rava <b>said to him:</b> Even if Rabbi Elazar himself agrees with Rabbi Akiva, <b>the mishna cannot be explained in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> Rather, the mishna must be in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, who hold that one who sells does so sparingly, and the difficulty that Rabbi Elazar raised against Rabbi Yoḥanan is predicated on the fact that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis.

### Part 5
<b>From where</b> does Rava derive that the mishna is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> If the three trees <b>grew,</b> the owner of the land <b>may cut down</b> the branches that extend into his field. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, why may he cut</b> them <b>down? Doesn’t</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>say</b> that <b>one who sells, sells generously?</b>

### Part 6
Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>said to him:</b> This does not prove that the mishna is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. You can <b>say that Rabbi Akiva stated</b> his ruling <b>in the case of a pit and a cistern</b> that are situated in a field belonging to another, which one sells in a generous manner, <b>as they do not weaken the land.</b> But <b>did you hear him</b> say that the seller is generous toward the buyer <b>with regard to a tree,</b> which can weaken the land?

### Part 7
<b>Doesn’t Rabbi Akiva concede in</b> the case of <b>a tree that leans out into the field of another,</b> in <b>which</b> the owner of the other field <b>cuts down</b> the branches until the <b>full</b> height of <b>an ox-goad,</b> the handle that protrudes <b>over a plow?</b> Since the extending branches impede his efforts to plow his field, it is permitted for him to cut them down. This indicates that even according to Rabbi Akiva one does not grant privileges that are detrimental to his own interests. If so, the mishna can be explained even in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, which indicates that Rabbi Elazar does not accept his ruling.

### Part 8
The Gemara points out: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba:</b> If one buys three trees in a field belonging to another, <b>this</b> buyer <b>has acquired</b> the ground that is found <b>underneath</b> the trees, <b>and</b> the area <b>between them, and outside of</b> the trees and their branches <b>an area</b> sufficient for <b>a gatherer of figs and his basket.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Those</b> areas around the trees that are designated for <b>a gatherer of figs and his basket</b> are used for this purpose only at specific times. <b>Who sows</b> that land during the rest of the year, the owner of the trees or the owner of the field? Rav Yosef <b>said to him: You learned</b> the answer in a mishna (99b): If one owns a garden that is surrounded by the garden of another, the owner of the inner garden has a right to a path through the outer garden. Even so, the owner of <b>the outer</b> garden <b>may sow the path.</b>

### Part 10
Abaye <b>said to him: Are</b> the cases <b>comparable? There,</b> in the case of the outer and inner gardens, <b>there is no loss</b> suffered <b>by the buyer</b> when the owner of the outer garden sows the path, as he can still pass through it. <b>But here, there is a loss for the buyer, as</b> the one who bought the trees <b>says to</b> the owner of the field: The <b>fruits</b> that fall from the trees will become <b>soiled</b> by the plants.

### Part 11
<b>This</b> case is <b>similar only to the last clause</b> of that mishna, which states: If the owner of the inner garden is given a side path, so that he suffers a loss of some kind because he cannot take the shortest path to reach his garden, both <b>this</b> owner of the inner garden <b>and that</b> owner of the outer garden <b>are not permitted to sow</b> the path. Similarly, here too, neither the owner of the trees nor the owner of the field are permitted to sow the place designated for the gatherer of figs and his basket.

### Part 12
The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Abaye: This</b> buyer <b>has acquired</b> the ground that is found <b>underneath</b> the trees, <b>and</b> the area <b>between them, and outside of</b> the trees and their branches <b>an area</b> sufficient for <b>a gatherer of figs and his basket. And</b> both <b>this</b> owner of the field <b>and that</b> owner of the trees <b>are not permitted to sow it.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara inquires: <b>And how much</b> space <b>must there be between</b> the three trees for them to be considered one unit, which means that the land is acquired by the owner of the trees? <b>Rav Yosef</b> says that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The distance between the trees must be <b>from four cubits to eight</b> cubits. <b>Rava</b> says that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> It must be <b>from eight</b> cubits <b>to sixteen</b> cubits. <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Do not disagree with Rav Naḥman, as we learned</b> in <b>a mishna in accordance with his</b> opinion.

### Part 14
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 4:9): <b>One who plants his vineyard sixteen cubits by sixteen cubits,</b> i.e., he leaves sixteen cubits between each row of vines, is <b>permitted to bring</b> other species of <b>seeds</b> to the empty spaces between the rows and sow them <b>there.</b> This is not considered a violation of the biblical prohibition with regard to sowing diverse crops in a vineyard, which is one of the prohibitions of diverse kinds.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said: There was an incident in</b> the city of <b>Tzalmon, where one</b> individual <b>planted his vineyard sixteen by sixteen cubits. And he would turn the branches</b> of <b>two rows</b> that were facing each other <b>to one side,</b> so that there was a space of sixteen cubits between the two rows, <b>and sow the clearing. The following year he would turn the branches to the place</b> that was <b>sown</b> the year before, <b>and would sow</b> the land that had been left <b>uncultivated</b> the previous year, as it had been filled with the branches from the vines. <b>And the incident came before the Sages and they permitted it.</b> This demonstrates that sixteen cubits between plants is required for them to be considered separate units.

### Part 16
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: I do not know</b> about this, <b>but there was</b> a similar <b>incident</b>
