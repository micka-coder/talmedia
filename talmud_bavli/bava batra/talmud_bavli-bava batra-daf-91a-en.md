### Part 1
<b>from</b> the northernmost <b>province [<i>mehiparkheya</i>]</b> of Eretz Yisrael <b>to</b> the southernmost <b>province</b> of Syria.

### Part 2
<b>The Sages taught: One may not earn</b> a profit <b>in Eretz Yisrael by</b> buying and reselling <b>items that contain</b> an element of basic <b>sustenance, such as wines, oils, and flours,</b> because this causes their price to rise. Rather, those who grow the produce should sell them in the markets, without recourse to a middleman.

### Part 3
The Sages <b>said of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya that he would earn</b> a profit <b>through</b> the sale of <b>wine and oil. With regard to wine, he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> ben Beteira, who says that it is permitted to export wine from Eretz Yisrael despite the fact that this causes it to become more expensive, as drinking wine leads to licentiousness. <b>With regard to oil, in Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya’s locale oil was common;</b> consequently, there was no concern that its price would rise if it were not sold directly to the consumer.

### Part 4
<b>The Sages taught: One may not earn</b> a profit <b>twice</b> from the sale <b>of eggs. Mari bar Mari said: Rav and Shmuel disagree</b> about the meaning of <b>that</b> statement. <b>One said</b> it means that the seller may not charge <b>double</b> the price he paid for the eggs. <b>And one said</b> that one <b>merchant</b> may not sell <b>to</b> another <b>merchant;</b> rather, the merchant who buys from the owner of the eggs must sell directly to the consumer.

### Part 5
§ Apropos price fluctuations, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Sages taught:</b> A community <b>sounds the alarm</b> and gathers in public prayer <b>for merchandise [<i>perakmatya</i>]</b> whose price has dropped. <b>And even on Shabbat</b> it is permitted to cry and plead, even though one may not pray for his personal needs on Shabbat, as this hardship affects the entire public.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring specifically to merchandise that serves as the basis of the local economy, <b>such as linen garments in Babylonia, and wine and oil in Eretz Yisrael. Rav Yosef said: And that</b> <i>halakha</i>, that public prayer is recited even on Shabbat, applies only <b>when</b> the merchandise <b>was reduced in price and stood</b> at such prices that goods that had been worth <b>ten</b> are currently selling <b>for six.</b>

### Part 7
<b>The Sages taught: One may not leave Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to</b> live <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>unless</b> the price of <b>two <i>se’a</i></b> of grain <b>stood at a <i>sela</i>,</b> which is double its usual price. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: When</b> does this exception, permitting one to leave Eretz Yisrael under certain circumstances, apply? It applies <b>when one is unable to find</b> produce <b>to buy,</b> as he has no money. <b>But when one</b> has money and <b>is able to find</b> produce <b>to buy, even</b> if the price of <b>a <i>se’a</i></b> of grain <b>stood at a <i>sela</i>, he may not leave.</b>

### Part 8
<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai would likewise say: Elimelech</b> and his sons <b>Mahlon and Chilion were prominent</b> members <b>of</b> their <b>generation and were leaders of</b> their <b>generation. And for what</b> reason <b>were they punished?</b> They were punished <b>because they left Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to</b> go <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>as it is stated</b> concerning Naomi and Ruth: <b>“And all the city was astir concerning them, and the women said: Is this Naomi?”</b> (Ruth 1:19). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“Is this Naomi”?</b> How does this indicate that her husband and sons were punished for leaving Eretz Yisrael? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that the women <b>said: Have you seen what befell Naomi, who left Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>for outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael? Not only did she not escape tribulations there, but she lost her status entirely.

### Part 9
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> also <b>says</b> with regard to this passage: <b>That</b> very <b>day when Ruth the Moabite came to Eretz Yisrael, the wife of Boaz died,</b> i.e., from the moment of their arrival the possibility was created for Ruth’s eventual marriage to Boaz. <b>This</b> explains the adage <b>that people say: Before the deceased dies, the person</b> who will next be <b>in charge of his house arises,</b> as in this case Boaz’s new wife, Ruth, arrived as his previous wife died.

### Part 10
Apropos the story of Ruth the Gemara adds: <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The judge <b>Ibzan</b> of Bethlehem (see Judges 12:8–10) <b>is Boaz.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is he teaching us?</b> The Gemara explains that this comment is <b>in accordance with the other</b> statement <b>of Rabba bar Rav Huna, as Rabba bar Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: Boaz prepared one hundred and twenty feasts for his children</b> at their weddings. <b>As it is stated,</b> concerning Ibzan: <b>“And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years”</b> (Judges 12:9). The verse indicates that he had sixty children.

### Part 11
<b>And at each and every</b> wedding he prepared for his children, <b>he made two feasts, one in the house of the father</b> of the groom <b>and one in the house of the father-in-law</b> of the groom. <b>And he did not invite Manoah,</b> the future father of Samson, whose wife was barren (see Judges 13:2) <b>to any of them,</b> as <b>he said:</b> It is not worth inviting him; he is <b>a sterile mule, how will he pay me back?</b> Manoah will never invite me in return, as he has no children.

### Part 12
A Sage <b>taught: And all</b> of the children of Ibzan <b>died during his lifetime. And this</b> explains the adage <b>that people say: Why do you</b> need the <b>sixty,</b> the <b>sixty</b> children <b>that you beget during your lifetime? Go to the trouble and beget one who will be more diligent than sixty.</b> This adage refers to Boaz, who had sixty children who died, and yet his last child, born from Ruth, is his glory, as King David was born from this line.

### Part 13
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the ensuing statements that Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said that Rav said: <b>Melech; Abraham; ten years; when he died; and He alone was exalted. Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>Elimelech, and</b> Boaz’s father, <b>Salmon, and So-and-so,</b> the unnamed relative who was a closer relative to Elimelech than Boaz (Ruth 4:1), <b>and Naomi’s father, all of these are descendants of Nahshon, son of Amminadab,</b> the head of the tribe of Judah (see Ruth 4:20–21 and Numbers 2:3). The Gemara asks: <b>What is he teaching us</b> by this statement? He is teaching <b>that even</b> in the case of <b>one who has the merit of his ancestors</b> to protect him, this merit <b>does not stand for him when he leaves Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to</b> go <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, as Elimelech died on account of this sin.

### Part 14
<b>And Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says</b> that <b>Rav says: The mother of Abraham</b> was called <b>Amatlai bat Karnevo. The mother of Haman</b> was called <b>Amatlai bat Orevati. And your mnemonic,</b> to ensure that the two are not confused for one another, is that a raven [<i>orev</i>] is <b>impure,</b> and in this manner one remembers that Orevati is the grandmother of the <b>impure</b> Haman, while a sheep [<i>kar</i>] is <b>pure,</b> which indicates that Karnevo is the grandmother of the <b>pure</b> Abraham.

### Part 15
Rav Ḥanan bar Rava continues: <b>The mother of David was named Natzvat bat Ada’el. The mother of Samson</b> was named <b>Tzelelponit, and his sister</b> was called <b>Nashyan.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> as to what their names were? The Gemara answers: It is important with regard <b>to an answer for heretics</b> who inquire into the names of these women, which are not stated in the Bible. One can reply that there is a tradition handed down concerning their names.

### Part 16
<b>And Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says</b> that <b>Rav says: Our forefather Abraham was imprisoned</b> for <b>ten years,</b> because he rejected the idol worship that was accepted in his land. He was imprisoned for <b>three</b> years <b>in</b> the city of <b>Khuta, and seven</b> years <b>in Karddu. And Rav Dimi of Neharde’a teaches the opposite,</b> that he was imprisoned seven years in Khuta and three in Karddu. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: The small passage of Khuta, this is Ur of the Chaldeans</b> (see Genesis 11:31).

### Part 17
<b>And Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> On <b>that day when our forefather Abraham left the world, the leaders of the nations of the world stood in a line,</b> in the manner of mourners, <b>and said: Woe to the world that has lost</b>
