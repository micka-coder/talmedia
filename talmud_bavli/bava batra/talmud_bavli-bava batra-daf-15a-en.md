<b>and by the three sons of Korah.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Jeremiah wrote his own book, and the book of Kings, and Lamentations. Hezekiah and his colleagues wrote</b> the following, and <b>a mnemonic</b> to remember which books they wrote is <b><i>yod</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>kuf</i>: Isaiah [<i>Yeshaya</i>], Proverbs [<i>Mishlei</i>], Song of Songs [<i>Shir HaShirim</i>], and Ecclesiastes [<i>Kohelet</i>]. The members of the Great Assembly wrote</b> the following, and <b>a mnemonic</b> to remember these books is <b><i>kuf</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>dalet</i>, <i>gimmel</i>: Ezekiel [<i>Yeḥezkel</i> ], and the Twelve Prophets [<i>Sheneim Asar</i>], Daniel</b> [<b><i>Daniel</i></b> ], <b>and the Scroll of Esther [<i>Megillat Ester</i>]. Ezra wrote his own book and the genealogy of</b> the book of <b>Chronicles until his</b> period.

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: This <b>supports Rav, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Ezra did not ascend from Babylonia</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>until he established his own genealogy, and</b> after that he <b>ascended.</b> This genealogy is what is written in the book of Chronicles. <b>And who completed</b> the book of Chronicles for the generations following Ezra? <b>Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara elaborates on the particulars of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> above that <b>Joshua wrote his own book and eight verses of the Torah.</b> The Gemara comments: This <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught in accordance with the one who says that</b> it was <b>Joshua</b> who <b>wrote the</b> last <b>eight verses in the Torah.</b> This point is subject to a tannaitic dispute, <b>as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And Moses the servant of the Lord died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5); <b>is it possible that</b> after <b>Moses died, he</b> himself <b>wrote “And Moses died there”? Rather, Moses wrote</b> the entire Torah <b>until this point,</b> and <b>Joshua wrote from this</b> point <b>forward;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Neḥemya</b> stated this opinion.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Shimon said to him: Is it possible</b> that the <b>Torah scroll was missing a single letter? But it is written: “Take this Torah scroll”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:26), indicating that the Torah was complete as is and that nothing further would be added to it. <b>Rather, until this point the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses repeated</b> after Him <b>and wrote</b> the text. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> with respect to Moses’ death, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses wrote with tears.</b> The fact that the Torah was written by way of dictation can be seen <b>later, as it is stated</b> concerning the writing of the Prophets: <b>“And Baruch said to them: He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the scroll”</b> (Jeremiah 36:18).

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rabbi Yehoshua bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> When the Torah is read publicly in the synagogue, <b>one</b> person <b>reads the</b> last <b>eight verses in the Torah,</b> and that section may not be divided between two readers? <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>this is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> as according to Rabbi Shimon these verses are an integral part of the Torah, written by Moses just like the rest? The Gemara answers: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that this was said in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, since they differ</b> from the rest of the Torah in one way, as Moses wrote them with tears, <b>they differ</b> from the rest of the Torah in this way as well, i.e., they may not be divided between two readers.

### Part 7
It is stated in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Joshua wrote his own book.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> toward the end of the book: <b>“And Joshua, son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died”</b> (Joshua 24:29)? Is it possible that Joshua wrote this? The Gemara answers: Aaron’s son <b>Eleazar completed it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it</b> also <b>written: “And Eleazar, son of Aaron, died”</b> (Joshua 24:33)? The Gemara answers: <b>Pinehas completed it.</b>

### Part 8
It is also stated in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Samuel wrote his own book.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And Samuel died”</b> (I Samuel 28:3)? The Gemara answers: <b>Gad the seer and Nathan the prophet finished it.</b>

### Part 9
It is further stated that <b>David wrote the book of Psalms by means of ten elders,</b> whom the <i>baraita</i> proceeds to list. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then <b>let it also count Ethan the Ezrahite</b> among the contributors to the book of Psalms, as it is he who is credited with Psalms, chapter 89. <b>Rav says: Ethan the Ezrahite is</b> the same person as <b>Abraham.</b> Proof for this is the fact that <b>it is written here:</b> “A Maskil of <b>Ethan the Ezrahite”</b> (Psalms 89:1), <b>and it is written there: “Who raised up one from the east [<i>mizraḥ</i>], whom righteousness</b> met wherever he set his foot” (Isaiah 41:2). The latter verse is understood as referring to Abraham, who came from the east, and for that reason he is called Ethan the Ezrahite in the former verse.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: The <i>baraita</i> <b>counts Moses</b> among the ten elders whose works are included in the book of Psalms, <b>and it</b> also <b>counts Heman. But doesn’t Rav say:</b> The <b>Heman</b> mentioned in the Bible (I Kings 5:11) <b>is</b> the same person as <b>Moses?</b> This is proven by the fact that <b>it is written here: “Heman”</b> (Psalms 88:1), which is Aramaic for trusted, <b>and it is written there</b> about Moses: <b>“For he is the trusted one in all My house”</b> (Numbers 12:7). The Gemara answers: <b>There were two Hemans,</b> one of whom was Moses, and the other a Temple singer from among the descendants of Samuel.

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> further states that <b>Moses wrote his own book,</b> i.e., the Torah, <b>the portion of Balaam, and</b> the book of <b>Job. This supports Rabbi Levi bar Laḥma, as Rabbi Levi bar Laḥma says: Job</b> lived <b>in the time of Moses. It is written here</b> with regard to Job: <b>“Oh, that my words were written now [<i>eifo</i>]”</b> (Job 19:23), <b>and it is written there</b> in Moses’ words to God: <b>“For in what shall it be known here [<i>eifo</i>]”</b> (Exodus 33:16). The unusual use of the word <i>eifo</i> in these two places indicates that Job and Moses lived in the same generation.

### Part 12
The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> if that is the proof, <b>say</b> that Job lived <b>in the time of Isaac, as it is written</b> in connection with Isaac: <b>“Who then [<i>eifo</i>] is he that has taken venison”</b> (Genesis 27:33). <b>Or say</b> that he lived <b>in the time of Jacob, as it is written</b> with respect to Jacob: <b>“If it must be so now [<i>eifo</i>], do this”</b> (Genesis 43:11). <b>Or say</b> that he lived <b>in the time of Joseph, as it is written</b> with respect to Joseph: “Tell me, I pray you, <b>where [<i>eifo</i>] are they feeding their flocks?”</b> (Genesis 37:16).

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: It could <b>not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written</b> in the continuation of the previously mentioned verse: <b>“Oh, that</b> my words <b>were inscribed [<i>veyuḥaku</i>] in a book”</b> (Job 19:23), <b>and it is Moses who is called the inscriber, as it is written</b> with regard to him: <b>“And he provided the first part for himself, for there was the inscriber’s [<i>meḥokek</i>] portion reserved”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:21).

### Part 14
<b>Rava says: Job</b> lived <b>at the time of the spies</b> whom Moses sent to scout the land of Canaan. This is proven by the fact that <b>it is written here: “There was a man in the land of Utz, whose name was Job”</b> (Job 1:1), <b>and it is written there</b> in the account of the spies: <b>“Whether there are trees [<i>eitz</i>] in it”</b> (Numbers 13:20). The Gemara asks: <b>Is it comparable? Here</b> the word that is used is <b><i>Utz</i>,</b> whereas <b>there</b> the word is <b><i>eitz</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This is what Moses said to Israel,</b> i.e., to the spies: <b>Is that man</b> named Job still alive, <b>he whose years are as long as</b> the years <b>of a tree and who protects his generation like a tree?</b> This is why the allusion to him here is through the word <i>eitz</i>, rather than <i>Utz</i>.

### Part 15
The Gemara relates that <b>one of the Sages sat before Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani and he sat and said: Job never existed and was never created;</b> there was never such a person as Job. <b>Rather,</b> his story <b>was a parable.</b> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani <b>said to him:</b> In rebuttal <b>to you, the verse states: “There was a man in the Land of Utz whose name was Job”</b> (Job 1:1), which indicates that such a man did indeed exist.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>But if that is so,</b> that the words “there was” prove that Job existed, what shall we say about the parable that Natan the prophet presented to David: “There were two men in one city; the one rich and the other poor. The rich man had very many flocks and herds, <b>but the poor man had nothing except one little lamb, which he had bought and reared”</b> (II Samuel 12:3)? <b>Was there</b> really such a person? <b>Rather, it was merely a parable; here too it is merely a parable.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that it is a parable, <b>why</b> state <b>his name and the name of his city?</b> Rather, Job was clearly a real person.

### Part 17
The Gemara cites another opinion with regard to the time when Job lived. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both say: Job was among those who ascended from the exile</b> to Eretz Yisrael at the start of the Second Temple period, <b>and his house of study was in Tiberias.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from what is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The days of Job’s life</b> extended <b>from when Israel entered Egypt until they left,</b> indicating that this is the period during which he lived and not, as suggested, in the early days of the Second Temple.
