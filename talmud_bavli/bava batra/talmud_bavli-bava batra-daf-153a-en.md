### Part 1
Rav’s disciples <b>understood from this</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies only when the person on his deathbed wishes to retract his gift and transfer it <b>to another. But</b> if he recovers and wishes to retract the gift and retain it <b>for himself,</b> Shmuel’s statement <b>does not</b> apply. <b>Rav Ḥisda said to them: When Rav Huna came from Kufrei, he explained</b> that Shmuel’s statement applies <b>both</b> to retaining the property <b>for himself and</b> to transferring it <b>to others.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> person on his deathbed who wrote a deed of transfer granting his property to another, and <b>it was acquired from him</b> by means of an act of acquisition. He subsequently recovered and wanted to retract the gift, and <b>he came before Rav Huna.</b> Rav Huna <b>said</b> to him: <b>What can I do for you?</b> You cannot retract the gift, <b>as you did not transfer</b> the gift <b>in the manner that people</b> on their deathbed <b>transfer</b> ownership of gifts, and you enhanced the legal power of the recipient by performing an act of acquisition.

### Part 3
§ The Gemara relates: There was a deed pertaining to <b>a certain gift</b> of a person on his deathbed, <b>in which it was written</b> that the gift is given both <b>in life and in death.</b> In such a case, <b>Rav says: It is like</b> the <b>gift of a person on his deathbed,</b> and if he recovers he can retract it. <b>And Shmuel says: It is like</b> the <b>gift of a healthy person,</b> and he cannot retract it.

### Part 4
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav says: It is like</b> the <b>gift of a person on his deathbed.</b> This can be inferred <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written in</b> the deed that the gift is given <b>in death.</b> This means that the giver <b>is saying to him</b> that the gift should take effect <b>after</b> his <b>death, and that which is written</b> in the deed, that the gift is given <b>in life,</b> is <b>merely</b> an auspicious <b>omen,</b> expressing hope <b>that</b> the giver <b>will live.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And Shmuel says: It is like</b> the <b>gift of a healthy person.</b> This can be inferred <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written in</b> the deed that the gift is given <b>in life.</b> This means that the giver <b>is saying</b> that the gift takes effect <b>during</b> his <b>life,</b> i.e., immediately. <b>And that which he wrote,</b> that the gift is given <b>in death, is like one who says: From now and for evermore,</b> i.e., that the gift is not retractable. The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rava said: And if it was written in</b> the deed that the gift is given <b>during life</b> and in death, the recipient <b>acquires</b> the gift and it cannot be retracted, as this term indicates that the gift takes effect while the giver still lives.

### Part 7
<b>Ameimar said: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava. Rav Ashi said to Ameimar:</b> Isn’t that <b>obvious, as</b> the Sages <b>of Neharde’a say</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav?</b> Ameimar replied: <b>Lest you say</b> that with regard to the term: <b>During life, Rav concedes</b> that the giver intends for the gift to take effect immediately, Ameimar <b>teaches us</b> that since the giver also mentioned death, he intended the gift as the gift of a person on his deathbed and he can retract it.

### Part 8
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> person who wrote in the deed that the gift is given in life and in death. When he recovered he wanted to retract the gift. He <b>came before Rav Naḥman in Neharde’a.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>sent him to</b> appear <b>before Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba in Shum Tamya.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said</b> in explanation of his actions: <b>Here,</b> Neharde’a, <b>is the place of Shmuel.</b> Consequently, Shmuel’s rulings should be followed, and therefore <b>how can we act in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav?</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> woman who wrote in the deed that the gift is given during life and in death. She <b>came before Rava. Rava acted with regard to her</b> case <b>in accordance with his halakhic</b> ruling, and he ruled that she cannot retract the gift. She did not accept the ruling, and <b>she</b> constantly <b>troubled him,</b> saying that he had not judged her case properly.

### Part 10
Rava <b>said to Rav Pappa, his scribe, son of Rav Ḥanan: Go, write for her</b> a ruling in her favor, <b>and write in</b> the ruling the phrase: He may <b>hire</b> replacements <b>at their</b> expense, <b>or deceive them</b> to get them to return to work. This is a phrase from the mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 75b) that discusses the ruling in the case of one who hired laborers to perform a task that cannot be delayed, and they quit. Rava intended this phrase to indicate to the court that the ruling was merely a ruse in order to persuade the woman to leave. The woman understood the ruse. <b>She said: May his ship sink; you are deceiving me. Rava had his clothes immersed in water</b> so that the curse should be fulfilled in this alternative manner, <b>but even so he was not saved from</b> the <b>sinking</b> of his ship.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>did not write in</b> the deed that he was <b>on his deathbed,</b> and he then recovered and wished to retract the gift, and <b>he says: I was on my deathbed,</b> and since I recovered, I can retract the gift, <b>but</b> the recipients <b>say: You were healthy,</b> and the gift cannot be retracted, the giver <b>must bring proof that he was on his deathbed</b> in order to retract the gift. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: The burden of proof rests upon the claimant,</b> and since the property is in the possession of the giver, the recipients must bring proof that they have the right to receive it.

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> There was a deed pertaining to <b>a certain gift</b> of a person on his deathbed, <b>in which it was written</b> that the gift was bestowed <b>when</b> the giver <b>was sick and lying in his bed, but</b> the continuation of the standard formula: <b>And from his sickness he departed to his</b> eternal <b>home, was not written in it.</b> The giver’s heirs claimed that although he was ill when he wrote the deed, he later recovered, and his gift is not valid.
