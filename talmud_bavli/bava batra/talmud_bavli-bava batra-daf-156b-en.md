### Part 1
The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: There was <b>an incident involving the mother of the sons of Rokhel, who was sick, and</b> who <b>said: My brooch shall be given to my daughter, and it is</b> valued <b>at twelve hundred dinars. And</b> this woman subsequently <b>died, and</b> the Sages <b>upheld her statement.</b> This indicates that a person on his deathbed can gift property without an act of acquisition. Rabbi Elazar <b>said to them:</b> That case was different; <b>the sons of Rokhel should be buried by their mother,</b> i.e., he cursed them. It is not possible to bring a proof from this incident, as these sons were wicked people. Consequently, when ruling in this matter the Sages did not act in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>, but allowed the mother of the sons of Rokhel to give this valuable piece of jewelry to their sister without an act of acquisition having been performed.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to the Rabbis:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a certain</b> man <b>of Meron who was in Jerusalem, and he had a lot of movable property. And he desired to give</b> the movable property <b>as gifts</b> to various individuals, but they could not be acquired by pulling. The Rabbis <b>said to him: There is no remedy for</b> transferring the property <b>unless he transfers</b> the movable property <b>by means of</b> transferring the ownership of <b>land.</b>

### Part 3
<b>He went and acquired one</b> plot of <b>rocky</b> land <b>adjacent to Jerusalem, and</b> he <b>said:</b> I give <b>the north</b> part <b>of</b> this area <b>to so-and-so, and with it one hundred sheep and one hundred barrels. And</b> I give <b>the south</b> part <b>of</b> the area <b>to so-and-so, and with it one hundred sheep and one hundred barrels. And he died, and the Sages upheld his statement.</b> This indicates that a person on his deathbed cannot transfer property without an act of acquisition. The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: Do you bring <b>proof from there?</b> The man <b>of Meron was healthy</b> at the time. This was not the gift of a person on his deathbed, and it could not be acquired by verbal instruction.

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches: Rabbi Elazar <b>said to them:</b> That case was different; <b>the sons of Rokhel should be buried by their mother.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>he was cursing them? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: They were maintaining thorns in a vineyard</b> and did not uproot them, <b>and Rabbi Eliezer</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 5:8): With regard to <b>one who maintains thorns in a vineyard, Rabbi Eliezer says: He has proscribed</b> the vineyard, rendering it forbidden due to the prohibition against diverse kinds. <b>And the Rabbis say: Only</b> growing <b>a matter,</b> i.e., a crop, <b>the like of which</b> people usually <b>maintain, proscribes</b> a vineyard and renders it forbidden.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> if it were <b>saffron</b> that grew in the vineyard, it <b>is useful</b> for seasoning and other uses, and therefore it proscribes the vineyard. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>thorns, for what are they useful? Rabbi Ḥanina said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> It is <b>because in Arabia they maintain thorns in the fields for their camels.</b> Rabbi Eliezer holds that since thorns are maintained in one place, they are considered useful everywhere.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Levi says:</b> An act of <b>acquisition may be performed</b> in order to effect acquisition of property <b>from a person on his deathbed even on Shabbat,</b> even though transactions are not performed on Shabbat. <b>And</b> this, that an act of acquisition must be performed, is <b>not</b> stated in order <b>to take into consideration the statement of Rabbi Eliezer</b> that the gifts of any person on his deathbed require an act of acquisition. <b>Rather,</b> the reason for this is that if a person on his deathbed requests the performance of an act of acquisition, his request is fulfilled, <b>lest</b> his anxiety upon seeing that his will is not being carried out cause him to <b>lose control of his mind</b> due to his grief, exacerbating his poor physical state.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: On Shabbat, the</b> verbal <b>statement</b> of a person on his deathbed <b>stands, as</b> he <b>cannot write,</b> and the Sages instituted that he can effect the transaction verbally lest the inability to do so exacerbate his condition. <b>But</b> a verbal instruction does <b>not</b> stand if stated <b>on a weekday. Rabbi Yehoshua says: With regard to Shabbat,</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> that his verbal instruction is sufficient, even though writing is prohibited. One can infer <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that the same applies <b>with regard to a weekday,</b> when writing is permitted.

### Part 8
<b>Similarly, one can acquire</b> property <b>on behalf of a minor, but one cannot acquire</b> property <b>on behalf of an adult,</b> since he can perform the act of acquisition himself; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The Sages <b>stated</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a minor,</b> and one may infer <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that this also applies <b>with regard to an adult,</b> who is able to perform the act of acquisition himself.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is ex-pressed in the <b>mishna?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to a person on his deathbed who distributes his property by verbal instruction, <b>on a weekday, his statements stand, because he can write, but</b> his statement does <b>not</b> stand <b>on Shabbat,</b> because he cannot write.
