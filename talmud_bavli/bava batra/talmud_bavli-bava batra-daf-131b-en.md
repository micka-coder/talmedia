### Part 1
<b>From where</b> do you conclude <b>that</b> both clauses, the one for the benefit of the sons and the one for the benefit of the daughters, <b>were instituted by one court</b> and are therefore each read in light of the other? <b>Perhaps they were instituted by two</b> different <b>courts</b> and are unrelated to each other. Accordingly, the wording of the gift and the wording of the inheritance are not part of the same statement.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: This possibility should <b>not enter your mind, as</b> the <b>former clause</b> of that mishna <b>teaches</b> (<i>Ketubot</i> 49a): A father is not obligated to provide his daughter’s sustenance. <b>This interpretation was interpreted</b> by <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya before the Sages of the vineyard in Yavne:</b> Since the Sages instituted that after the father’s death, <b>the sons inherit</b> the sum of money specified in their mother’s marriage contract, <b>and the daughters are sustained</b> from their father’s estate, these two <i>halakhot</i> are equated: <b>Just as the sons inherit only after their father’s death,</b> not during his lifetime, <b>so too, the daughters are sustained</b> from their father’s property <b>only after their father’s death.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara explains: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the two clauses <b>were instituted by one court, this is</b> the reason <b>that we derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of one <b>ordinance from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the other <b>ordinance,</b> under the assumption that a court institutes ordinances in a consistent manner. <b>But if you say</b> that they <b>were instituted by two</b> distinct <b>courts</b> operating in different periods, <b>how can we derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of one <b>ordinance from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the other <b>ordinance?</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>From where</b> is it assumed that they were instituted by one court? <b>Actually, I will say to you</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the two clauses <b>were instituted by two</b> separate <b>courts, and</b> nevertheless Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya derived the <i>halakhot</i> of one ordinance from the <i>halakhot</i> of the other ordinance, because <b>the latter court</b> presumably <b>instituted</b> its ordinance <b>in accordance with</b> the format of <b>the former court, so that</b> one should <b>not ask</b> about contradictions between one <b>ordinance and</b> the other <b>ordinance.</b> With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of inheritance, there is no reason to read the two clauses in light of the other.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> A person on his deathbed <b>who writes</b> a document granting <b>all his property to his wife has merely rendered her a steward.</b> The assumption is that he did not intend to deprive his heirs of their entire inheritance. Rather, he intended to appoint her as a steward in charge of the property, so that the heirs will honor her.

### Part 6
The Gemara discusses similar cases: It is <b>obvious</b> that if one writes a document granting all his property to <b>his adult son,</b> he does not intend to give him the entire inheritance, but to have him distribute it among his brothers. Rather, <b>he has merely rendered him a steward [<i>apotropos</i>].</b> If he writes it to <b>his minor son, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is it still assumed that his intention is to appoint him as a steward, or is that implausible since a minor boy is not yet capable of assuming this position and therefore the father apparently intended to bequeath to him the entire inheritance?

### Part 7
It <b>was stated</b> that <b>Rav Ḥanilai bar Idi</b> says that <b>Shmuel says</b> that <b>even</b> if one wrote a document granting all his property to <b>his minor son who is lying in</b> his <b>crib,</b> he does not receive the entire inheritance. Rather, the father presumably intended to appoint him as a steward when he reached adulthood, so that the other heirs would honor him.

### Part 8
The Gemara states: It is <b>obvious</b> that if one wrote a document granting all his property to <b>his son and another</b> person, he intended to give <b>the other</b> person half the property <b>as a gift, and</b> to appoint <b>his son a steward</b> to oversee the property of his brothers, with whom he shares the other half. Similarly, if he wrote a document granting all his property to <b>his wife and another</b> person, he intended to give <b>the other</b> person half the property <b>as a gift, and</b> to appoint <b>his wife a steward</b> to oversee the other half of the property for his sons.

### Part 9
Furthermore, it is obvious that if one wrote a document granting all his property to <b>his betrothed wife,</b> whom he did not yet wed, <b>or</b> to <b>his</b> former <b>wife,</b> whom he had <b>divorced,</b> he intended to give it to them <b>as a gift,</b> as he had no reason to have his heirs honor them.

### Part 10
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one wrote a document granting all his property to his <b>daughter before</b> his <b>sons,</b> in a case where he has sons who would inherit from him, <b>or</b> to his <b>wife before</b> his <b>brothers, or</b> to his <b>wife before the husband’s sons</b> who are not her sons, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it assumed that his intention was to appoint her as a steward or to give her the property as a gift?

### Part 11
<b>Ravina said in the name of Rava</b> that <b>in all of</b> these cases the recipient <b>did not acquire</b> the property. Rather, he or she was merely appointed a steward, <b>except for</b> the cases of <b>his betrothed wife and his</b> former <b>wife</b> whom he <b>divorced.</b> By contrast, <b>Rav Avira said in the name of Rava</b> that <b>in all of</b> these cases the recipient <b>acquired</b> the property, <b>except for</b> the cases of his <b>wife before</b> his <b>brothers and</b> his <b>wife before the husband’s sons,</b> where he clearly intended only to appoint her as a steward.
