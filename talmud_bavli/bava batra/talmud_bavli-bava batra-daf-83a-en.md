### Part 1
involving the sale of trees <b>in a village of shepherds, and they came before Rav Yehuda, and he said to</b> the seller: <b>Go</b> and <b>give to</b> the one who bought the trees <b>sufficient</b> land <b>for an ox and its vessels. But I did not know how much</b> was <b>sufficient</b> land <b>for an ox and its vessels. When I heard that which we learned</b> in a mishna (26a), I came to a conclusion with regard to this case. The mishna teaches as follows: <b>A person may not plant a tree close by the field of another, unless he places it at a distance</b> of <b>four cubits from</b> the other field.

### Part 2
Rav Yosef continues: <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> this mishna: The <b>four cubits that</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> are <b>for the work of the vineyard,</b> so that he does not take oxen and a plow into his neighbor’s field while tending to his vineyard. <b>I</b> studied this mishna and <i>baraita</i> and <b>said: Learn from it</b> that the phrase: <b>Sufficient for the ox and its vessels,</b> means <b>four cubits.</b> At this stage, the Gemara has demonstrated that Rav Naḥman’s opinion is supported by a mishna, whereas Rav Yosef’s ruling is supported by the incident involving Rav Yehuda.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we</b> also <b>learn</b> a ruling in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 4:9) <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef?</b> That mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> In a case of <b>one who plants his vineyard eight cubits by eight</b> cubits, i.e., he leaves eight cubits between each row of vines, it is <b>permitted</b> for him <b>to bring seeds to</b> the empty spaces between the rows. This ruling can be cited in support of the opinion of Rav Yosef that if there is a space of eight cubits between trees or vines they are not considered one unit. Why, then, is this mishna not brought as proof?

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>Even so,</b> it is <b>preferable</b> to cite the <b>incident</b> in Tzalmon as proof. Whenever possible, it is preferable to provide support for an opinion by means of a practical ruling, as it demonstrates that the Sages took action in accordance with that opinion and did not merely teach it as <i>halakha</i> in theory.

### Part 5
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to</b> the analysis of <b>Rav Yosef</b> stated <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, we hear</b> about the maximum distance that the trees can be <b>scattered, and we hear</b> about the minimum distance that they can be planted <b>close together.</b> The distance that the trees can be <b>scattered</b> is <b>that which we said,</b> i.e., eight cubits. The minimum distance that they can be planted <b>close together</b> is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 5:2): <b>A vineyard that is planted</b> in consecutive rows <b>with less than four cubits</b> between the rows <b>is not</b> classified as <b>a vineyard,</b> because the rows are planted too close together. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon. And the Rabbis say:</b> It is considered <b>a vineyard, and one views the middle</b> vines <b>as if they are not</b> there, as they are slated to be uprooted.

### Part 6
<b>But according to</b> the analysis of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> stated <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis, we hear</b> the maximum distance that the trees can be <b>scattered,</b> i.e., sixteen cubits, as in the incident in Tzalmon. Concerning the minimum distance that they can be planted <b>close together, did we hear</b> this distance? The Gemara answers: This <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning; from</b> the fact <b>that according to Rabbi Shimon</b> the minimum distance is <b>half</b> of the maximum distance, according <b>to the Rabbis as well,</b> the minimum distance is <b>half</b> of the maximum, i.e., eight cubits.

### Part 7
<b>Rava says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that one who buys three trees acquires the land if the distance between the trees is anywhere <b>from four cubits to sixteen</b> cubits. This ruling is a combination of the two opinions, which is favorable to the buyer. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava: How close</b> may <b>they be? Four cubits. And how far apart</b> may <b>they be? Sixteen</b> cubits.

### Part 8
If one bought three trees planted in this manner, <b>this one has acquired</b> the <b>land and the</b> small <b>trees that</b> are <b>between them. Therefore,</b> if <b>the tree dried up or was cut down he has</b> ownership of the <b>land.</b> If the distance between the trees was <b>less than this or more than this, or if he bought</b> the trees <b>one after the other, this</b> buyer <b>has not acquired either the land or the trees that</b> are <b>between them. Therefore,</b> if <b>the tree dried up or was cut down he has no</b> ownership over the <b>land.</b>

### Part 9
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma: When one measures</b> the distance between the trees, <b>does he measure from the narrow place</b> on the trunk of the tree <b>or does he measure from the wide place? Rav Geviha of Bei Khatil said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 7:1): When one comes to measure from <b>the layered branch of the vine he measures only from the second root,</b> as this is the average, not the widest part of the vine.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If the owner of the field <b>sold to</b> someone <b>three branches</b> that grew from one <b>tree,</b> and its trunk was covered with earth so that the branches appeared to be three separate trees, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Are they considered three trees, which would mean that their owner acquires the ground between them?

### Part 11
<b>Rav Geviha of Bei Khatil said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 7:2): With regard to <b>one who layers</b> the branches of <b>three vines</b> into the ground so that they take root while still attached to the base of the vine, <b>and their roots</b> that rise above the ground <b>are visible, Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: If there is</b> a distance <b>between them of four cubits to eight</b> cubits, <b>they combine</b> to form one vineyard composed of six grapevines. <b>And if not, they do not combine.</b> It can be inferred from this mishna that the different branches of a tree are considered separate entities when the trunk is covered by earth, provided the required distance between them is maintained.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> If the owner of a field <b>sold to</b> someone <b>two</b> trees <b>in his field and one</b> situated <b>on</b> its <b>border, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Similarly, if one bought <b>two</b> trees <b>in</b> the field <b>of</b> one person <b>and one in</b> the field <b>of another, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Do the trees combine to form one unit of three trees, or not? The Gemara states that this dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
