### Part 1
<b>Rav Ashi said: Any</b> alternative path <b>on the side</b> of the original path <b>is</b> considered <b>a circuitous route,</b> as it is <b>close for this</b> person <b>and it is far for that</b> person. While some will benefit from the change, it will be detrimental to others. Therefore, one may never exchange a public path for an alternative path.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches that if a field owner provides an alternative thoroughfare through his field for the public to use, the public may use both thoroughfares. The Gemara suggests: <b>But let him say to them: Take your</b> original thoroughfare back <b>and give me my</b> thoroughfare that I provided you. The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? It <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b> If the <b>public selected a thoroughfare</b> through a privately owned field <b>for themselves</b> even without gaining the permission of the field owner, <b>that which they selected, they selected,</b> and they have the right to use it.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, are</b> the members of the <b>public</b> entitled to be <b>robbers?</b> Why should they be permitted to appropriate land from a private owner? <b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> Rabbi Eliezer refers only to a case <b>where</b> the public <b>lost a thoroughfare in that field,</b> e.g., the field was plowed over and the original course of the thoroughfare is not known. In such a case, the public has the right to determine the course anew.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why does Rabba bar Rav Huna say</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer?</b> His reasoning seems valid. The Gemara answers: The <b>one who teaches this,</b> i.e., that Rabbi Eliezer is referring to a case where a thoroughfare was lost, <b>does not teach that,</b> i.e., that Rav rules against Rabbi Eliezer. There is a dispute as to what Rav said.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to Rabba bar Rav Huna, <b>what is the reason</b> the field owner cannot reclaim the alternative thoroughfare that he gave to the public? The Gemara answers: It is <b>due to</b> the statement <b>of Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to a strip of land that serves as <b>a border</b> between two strips of land <b>that the public took possession of</b> as a public thoroughfare, <b>it is prohibited to destroy it</b> for them, i.e., prevent people from using it. Accordingly, in the case of the mishna, where the field owner actually provided the public with a thoroughfare, he may certainly not take it back.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Eliezer, through what</b> means <b>does the public acquire</b> the thoroughfare they choose? The Gemara answers: <b>By</b> means of <b>walking</b> on the thoroughfare, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one walked along</b> a field’s <b>length and its breadth, he has acquired the area</b> inside <b>where he walked,</b> as walking is an effective act of acquisition; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. And the Rabbis say</b> that by itself, <b>walking is not</b> effective <b>at all</b> to acquire a field, and it is not acquired <b>until he takes possession</b> of it using a legal act of acquisition.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer? As it is written</b> that after God promised Abraham Eretz Yisrael, He instructed him: <b>“Arise, walk through the land, its length and its breadth; for I will give it to you”</b> (Genesis 13:17), in order that Abraham should thereby acquire the land. <b>And the Rabbis,</b> how do they interpret this verse? They hold that <b>there,</b> in Genesis, it was <b>due to</b> God’s <b>love of Abraham that he said to him</b> to do <b>this, in order that it would be easy for his descendants to conquer</b> the land. His walking was to demonstrate the divine promise and thereby emphasize his descendants’ claim to the land, but it did not effect acquisition of it.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: The Rabbis concede to Rabbi Eliezer with regard to a path</b> that passes <b>through vineyards</b> that <b>since</b> the path <b>is made</b> only <b>for walking</b> on it, <b>it can be acquired by</b> means of <b>walking</b> on it.

### Part 9
The Gemara relates an incident involving the allocation of a path through a vineyard: <b>When</b> people <b>came before Rav Yitzḥak bar Ami</b> for judgment with regard to the width of a path through a vineyard that someone had purchased, <b>he said to them: Give him</b> a path wide enough <b>so that one can carry a load [<i>tuna</i>] of vine branches [<i>dishvishta</i>]</b> along it <b>and</b> is able to <b>turn around</b> while holding them. The Gemara comments: <b>And we said</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the sides of the path <b>are bounded by a fence,</b> which would physically prevent a person from carrying a load of vine branches that are wider than the path, and therefore, if necessary, the path must be widened by breaking down the fence. <b>But</b> where the sides <b>are not bound by a fence,</b> a person carrying a load of vine branches will not be prevented from passing along it. Consequently, he needs only to be given a path wide enough <b>so that he can lift up</b> one <b>foot and place</b> it in front of the other <b>foot.</b>

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches: The standard width of <b>a private path</b> is <b>four cubits. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> A private path is wide enough <b>so that a donkey can pass on</b> it <b>with his load. Rav Huna says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>. And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>The judges of the exile say</b> that the standard width is <b>two and a half cubits. And Rav Huna says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of the <b>judges of the exile.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rav Huna say:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>?</b> The Gemara resolves the contradiction: <b>This</b> definition <b>and that</b> definition <b>are one</b> and the same <b>measure.</b>

### Part 11
The mishna teaches: The standard width of <b>a public thoroughfare</b> is <b>sixteen cubits. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The standard width of <b>a private path</b> is <b>four cubits.</b> The standard width of <b>a road</b> that goes <b>from city to city</b> is <b>eight cubits.</b>
