### Part 1
<b>say</b> that the litigant loses the case if he cannot produce verification of his extraneous claims, but <b>only</b> that he is told <b>to verify</b> those claims if he can. Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abba: <b>I, too, am saying</b> only that you are required <b>to verify</b> your claim if you can; if you cannot, you will not be required to pay.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a debtor <b>who repaid part of his debt, Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The creditor <b>should exchange</b> the promissory note for a new one stating the current balance and tear up the first promissory note. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The creditor may keep the original promissory note, and he <b>should write a receipt</b> for the payment he has received and give it to the debtor as proof of his partial payment of the sum recorded in the old note. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> with regard to this arrangement: It is <b>found</b> that <b>this</b> debtor <b>must</b> now <b>guard his receipt against</b> being destroyed by <b>mice,</b> as if he no longer has the receipt, he will have to pay the entire sum recorded in the promissory note. <b>Rabbi Yosei said to him: This</b> situation is <b>fitting for him;</b> it is better that this procedure be followed, <b>and the strength of</b> the claim of <b>this</b> creditor <b>not be weakened.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, nor</b> is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>the court tears up the</b> original promissory <b>note and writes a different</b> promissory <b>note for</b> the creditor, listing the new sum owed, dated <b>from the time</b> of the <b>first</b> document.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Naḥman said to Rav Huna, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba</b> who said this <b>to Rav Huna: If Rav would have heard this</b> following <b><i>baraita</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that according to Rabbi Yehuda the proper procedure is that the <b>witnesses tear the</b> original promissory <b>note and write another</b> promissory <b>note for</b> the creditor listing the new sum owed, dated <b>from the time</b> of the <b>first</b> document, <b>he would have retracted</b> his statement that the court tears the promissory note and writes a new one.

### Part 5
Rav Huna <b>said to him:</b> Rav <b>heard</b> the <i>baraita</i>, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>he did not retract</b> his statement. While Rabbi Yehuda says in the <i>baraita</i> that the witnesses write a new promissory note, Rav maintains that this must be done specifically by a court. Why is this?
