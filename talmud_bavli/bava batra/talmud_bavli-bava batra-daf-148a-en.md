### Part 1
With regard to <b>a person on his deathbed who says: Give</b> the <b>loan</b> owed <b>to me to so-and-so</b> as a gift, the <b>loan</b> owned to <b>him</b> is acquired <b>by so-and-so. And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that this does not</b> apply <b>in</b> the case of <b>a healthy person,</b> as one cannot transfer a loan to a third party without a promissory note. <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> In this case the <i>halakha</i> of transferring loans differs with regard to a person on his deathbed, <b>since an heir inherits</b> loans without a promissory note, and the Sages accorded the gift of a person on his deathbed the halakhic status of an inheritance.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: A loan</b> without a promissory note <b>can be</b> conferred as a gift <b>by a healthy person. And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> that which <b>Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav says, as Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to one who said to another: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession, give it to so-and-so,</b> if this was stated <b>in the presence of</b> all <b>three of the</b> parties, the third party <b>acquires</b> the money without an act of acquisition and without the need for witnesses.

### Part 3
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to one who gave <b>a palm tree to one</b> person <b>and its fruit to another, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Did</b> he <b>reserve the place of the fruit</b> on the tree for the second person in order to give him a tangible object, and therefore the second person acquires the fruit, <b>or</b> did <b>he not reserve</b> it, and the second person does not acquire the fruit? Furthermore, <b>if you say</b> that giving the palm tree to one person and giving the fruit <b>to another is not</b> considered <b>reserving</b> the place of the fruit unless this is explicitly stipulated, then if he reserves the fruit <b>for himself,</b> stating that the tree is given to another <b>except for its fruit, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 4
<b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> Even <b>if you say</b> that giving the <b>palm tree to one</b> person <b>and its fruit to another is not</b> considered <b>reserving the place of the fruit</b> for the second person, if he gave the <b>palm tree to one</b> person <b>and reserved the fruit for himself,</b> he also <b>reserved the place of the fruit</b> for himself. <b>What is the reason</b> for this distinction? The reason is that <b>anything</b> that one reserves <b>with regard to himself, he reserves generously,</b> and therefore he reserves for himself not only the fruit itself, but also the place of the fruit.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi: We learned</b> the aforementioned statement of Rav Naḥman <b>with regard to</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> concerning a different matter, <b>as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> In the case of <b>one who sells a house to another and says to him:</b> I am selling the house <b>on the condition that the upper story [<i>deyota</i>]</b> remains <b>mine, the upper story</b> remains <b>his.</b>
