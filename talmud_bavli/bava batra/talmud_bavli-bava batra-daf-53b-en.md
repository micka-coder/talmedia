### Part 1
If his intention was <b>to acquire it and</b> also acquire <b>the other</b> field, he has <b>acquired</b> the first field, but has <b>not acquired the other</b> field, since the fields are separated by a boundary. If he took possession of one field in order <b>to acquire</b> only <b>the other</b> field, <b>he has not acquired even that</b> field of which he took possession, since his intention when taking possession was to acquire the other field, and one does not acquire an item without the intention to do so.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if one <b>took possession of one of</b> the fields in order <b>to acquire it, and the boundary, and the other</b> field, all together? <b>Do we say</b> that the <b>boundary of the land is one,</b> i.e., these two fields are joined by means of their common boundary, <b>and</b> therefore he has <b>acquired</b> all of them? <b>Or perhaps this</b> field <b>stands alone and that</b> field <b>stands alone.</b> The Gemara notes that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Elazar raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if one <b>took possession of the boundary</b> between the two fields in order <b>to acquire both of</b> the fields? <b>Do we say</b> that the legal status of <b>this boundary</b> is that of <b>the halter of the land and he acquires</b> the fields, just as one acquires an animal through the acquisition of its halter? <b>Or perhaps</b> this field <b>stands alone and that</b> field <b>stands alone,</b> as the boundary is not connected to the field in the same manner that a halter is connected to an animal. The Gemara notes that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 4
Similarly, <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> If there were <b>two houses</b> in a courtyard, <b>this</b> one situated <b>within</b> the courtyard relative <b>to that</b> one, and one <b>took possession of the outer</b> house in order <b>to acquire it, he has acquired it.</b> If his intention was <b>to acquire it and</b> also acquire <b>the inner</b> house, <b>he has acquired the outer</b> house, but has <b>not acquired the inner</b> house. If he took possession of the outer house in order to <b>acquire the inner</b> house alone, he <b>has not acquired even the outer</b> house.

### Part 5
If he <b>took possession of the inner</b> house in order <b>to acquire it,</b> he <b>has acquired it.</b> If his intention was <b>to acquire it and</b> also acquire <b>the outer house,</b> he <b>has acquired both of them.</b> Since the residents of the inner house possess the right to pass through the outer house in order to enter and exit the courtyard, the outer house is viewed as an extension of the inner house. If he took possession of the inner house in order <b>to acquire</b> only <b>the outer</b> house, he has <b>not acquired even the inner</b> house, since he did not take possession of the property that he intended to acquire.

### Part 6
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of taking possession of ownerless property. <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> With regard to <b>one who builds large palaces [<i>palterin</i>] on the property of a convert</b> who died without heirs, <b>and another came and placed doors</b> upon <b>them,</b> the latter <b>has acquired</b> the property. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The first,</b> i.e., the one who built the palaces, <b>merely turned over bricks,</b> i.e., building an incomplete house is not sufficient to take possession of the property.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Dimi bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: One who finds palaces</b> built <b>on the property of a convert</b> who died without heirs <b>and plastered them</b> with <b>one</b> application of <b>plaster or</b> tiled them with <b>one tile, has acquired them.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And how much,</b> i.e., what is the minimum area that must be plastered or tiled? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> A square <b>cubit. Rav Ḥisda said: And</b> he acquires it in this manner only if it was plastered or tiled <b>opposite the entrance,</b> where it can be easily seen.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Amram said: Rav Sheshet said this statement to us, and he enlightened our eyes from a <i>baraita</i></b> that alludes to the same matter. He said: <b>One who spreads</b> out <b>mattresses on the property of a convert</b> who died without heirs <b>has acquired</b> it. <b>And</b> that which I said, that <b>he enlightened our eyes from a <i>baraita</i>, what is it? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 1:5): <b>How</b> does one acquire a Canaanite slave <b>through taking possession?</b> If the slave <b>placed</b> one’s <b>shoe for him, or untied</b> his <b>shoe for him, or</b> if it occurred <b>that he carried his garments after him to the bathhouse, or undresses him, or bathes him,</b> or <b>anoints him,</b> or <b>scrubs</b> the oil off <b>him, or dresses him, or puts on his shoes, or lifts him,</b> one <b>acquires</b> the slave. <b>Rabbi Shimon said:</b> The acquisition generated by taking <b>possession should not be</b> considered <b>greater than</b> the acquisition generated by <b>lifting, as lifting acquires</b> property <b>in any situation.</b>

### Part 9
With regard to this last statement, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>saying</b> here, as the first <i>tanna</i> also said that a slave can be acquired by lifting? The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is what he <b>is saying:</b> The first <i>tanna</i> holds that if <b>he lifted his master,</b> the master <b>acquires him,</b> as he is performing labor for the master, but if <b>his master lifted him,</b> the master <b>does not acquire him,</b> as the slave has not performed labor on his behalf. With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>Rabbi Shimon said:</b> Acquisition generated through taking <b>possession should not be greater than</b> acquisition generated through <b>lifting, as lifting acquires</b> property <b>in any situation.</b> Consequently, one can acquire a slave even by lifting him.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Yirmeya Bira’a says</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>this one</b>
