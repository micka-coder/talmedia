<b>and summons</b> a judge <b>to judgment,</b> has he <b>disqualified</b> the judge even if he were later to be exonerated? <b>Rather,</b> it should say: <b>Any judge who is summoned to judgment and money is lawfully taken from him,</b> i.e., he was ordered to return someone’s property, <b>is not considered a judge.</b> When they heard this, <b>they wrote this</b> addendum to the original inscription: <b>But the elders of the Jews say</b> that <b>any judge who is summoned to judgment and money is lawfully taken from him is not considered a judge.</b>

### Part 2
Rabbi Bena’a also <b>saw that it was written</b> there: <b>At the head</b> of <b>all death am I, blood,</b> i.e., people die from an excess of blood; <b>at the head</b> of <b>all life am I, wine,</b> i.e., wine is what gives life. He said to them: <b>If that is so,</b> in the case of someone <b>who falls from a roof and dies, or</b> someone <b>who falls from a palm tree and dies,</b> was it <b>blood</b> that <b>killed him? And furthermore,</b> concerning someone <b>who is on the way to death, can they give him a drink of wine and</b> he will <b>live? Rather, this</b> is what <b>should be written: At the head of all illness am I, blood; at the head of all healing am I, wine.</b> When they heard this, <b>they wrote this</b> addendum to the original inscription: <b>But the elders of the Jews say: At the head of all illness am I, blood; at the head of all healing am I, wine. In a place where there is no wine, herbs are required there</b> as medicines.

### Part 3
Having related that incident, the Gemara notes that <b>at the entrance of Kapotekiyya</b> it was <b>written: <i>Anpak</i>, <i>anbag</i>, <i>antal</i>,</b> which are all names for the same measurement. <b>And what is <i>antal</i>? It is</b> the <b>quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of</b> the <b>Torah.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a spout</b> protruding from one’s roof gutter draining water into another’s property, its owner <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use, <b>but</b> he does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege with regard to its place,</b> as the Gemara will explain. With regard to <b>a gutter pipe</b> that traverses the length of the roof, one does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use.

### Part 5
With regard to <b>an Egyptian ladder,</b> which is small and portable, one <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use. <b>But with regard to a Tyrian</b> ladder, which is large and fixed in place, one does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use.

### Part 6
With regard to <b>an Egyptian window,</b> one <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use; <b>but with regard to a Tyrian</b> window, one does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use. <b>What is</b> the defining feature of <b>an Egyptian window?</b> It is <b>any</b> window that is so small <b>that a person’s head is not able to fit inside it. Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> a window <b>has a frame, even though a person’s head is not able to fit inside it,</b> one does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the mishna’s statement: With regard to <b>a spout,</b> its owner <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use, <b>but</b> he does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege with regard to its place? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: This</b> is what it <b>is saying:</b> Concerning <b>a spout,</b> its owner <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use <b>with regard to one side,</b> i.e., the owner of the field below has the right to move the spout from one place to another on one side of the roof, <b>but</b> he does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege concerning its place with regard to two sides,</b> i.e., the owner of the field below does not have the right to move it to another side of the roof.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said</b> there is a different explanation: With regard to <b>a spout,</b> its owner <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> size, <b>as if it was long,</b> the owner of the field below may <b>shorten it, but</b> one does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege with regard to its place, as if</b> the owner of the field below <b>comes to remove it</b> entirely, <b>he may not remove it.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> there is a different explanation: With regard to <b>a spout,</b> its owner <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use, <b>as if</b> the owner of the field below <b>wishes to build beneath it,</b> he may <b>build,</b> and the owner of the spout may not prevent him from doing so; <b>but</b> one does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege with regard to its place, as if</b> the owner of the field below <b>comes to remove it</b> entirely, <b>he may not remove it.</b>
