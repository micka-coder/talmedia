### Part 1
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain boat that two</b> people <b>were quarreling</b> about with regard to <b>its</b> ownership. <b>This</b> one <b>said: It is mine, and that</b> one also <b>said: It is mine. One of them came to court and said: Seize it until I</b> am able to <b>bring witnesses that it is mine.</b> The Gemara asks: In such a case, do <b>we seize</b> it <b>or</b> do <b>we not seize</b> it? <b>Rav Huna said: We seize</b> it. <b>Rav Yehuda said: We</b> do <b>not seize</b> it, as there is no cause for the court to intervene.

### Part 2
The court seized the boat. The one who requested of the court to seize it <b>went</b> to seek witnesses, <b>but did not find witnesses.</b> He then <b>said to</b> the court: <b>Release</b> the boat, <b>and whoever is stronger prevails,</b> as this is the ruling in a case where there is neither evidence nor presumptive ownership for either litigant. The Gemara asks: In such a case, do <b>we release</b> it <b>or</b> do <b>we not release</b> it? <b>Rav Yehuda said: We</b> do <b>not release</b> it. <b>Rav Pappa said: We release</b> it. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>we</b> do <b>not seize</b> property in a case where ownership is uncertain, <b>and where</b> it was <b>seized, we</b> do <b>not release</b> it.

### Part 3
There was an incident where two people dispute the ownership of property. <b>This</b> one <b>says:</b> It <b>belonged to my ancestors</b> and I inherited it from them, <b>and that</b> one <b>says:</b> It <b>belonged to my ancestors</b> and I inherited it from them. There was neither evidence nor presumptive ownership for either litigant. <b>Rav Naḥman said: Whoever is stronger prevails.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the case where two people produce <b>two deeds</b> of sale or gift for the same field <b>that are issued on one day,</b>
