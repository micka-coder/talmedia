### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Shimon</b> from the mishna, which teaches: <b>A woman</b> with regard to <b>her son, a woman</b> with regard to <b>her husband, and maternal uncles</b> all <b>bequeath</b> to their respective relatives <b>but do not inherit</b> from them. The mishna states explicitly that a mother does not inherit her son’s property. Rabbi Yehuda ben Shimon <b>said to him:</b> With regard to <b>our mishna, I do not know who taught it,</b> i.e., I am not aware of any <i>tanna</i> who concurs with its ruling and it is not the accepted <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>say to</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Shimon that the mishna <b>is</b> written in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav, who,</b> as noted on page 111a, <b>does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that sons precede daughters with regard to the inheritance of their mother from the word <b>“tribes.”</b> Since Rabbi Yehuda ben Shimon’s ruling is based on a derivation from the word “tribes,” it stands to reason that Rabbi Zekharya disagrees with Rabbi Yehuda ben Shimon, and the ruling of the mishna is in accordance with Rabbi Zekharya’s opinion.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>The mishna cannot be interpreted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav, as it teaches: And the sons of a sister</b> inherit but do not bequeath, <b>and</b> a Sage <b>taught</b> that the mishna is referring only to <b>sons of a sister and not</b> to <b>daughters of a sister, and we say: With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is there a distinction between the sons and daughters of a sister? <b>And Rav Sheshet said:</b> The distinction is meant <b>to</b> teach that where there are sons as well, they <b>precede</b> the daughters in inheriting from their maternal uncle.

### Part 4
The Gemara continues: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>the mishna is</b> written in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav, doesn’t he say: Both the son and the daughter are equal with regard to the mother’s property,</b> as they inherit equally? The mishna stands in contraposition to Rabbi Zekharya’s ruling, and therefore it cannot be written in accordance with his opinion.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, <b>whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it, is inconsistent: <b>If he interprets</b> the word <b>“tribes,”</b> then <b>a woman also should inherit</b> from <b>her son,</b> as noted above (114b). And <b>if he does not interpret</b> the word <b>“tribes,”</b> then <b>from where is it</b> clear <b>to him</b> that <b>a son precedes a daughter with regard to</b> the <b>property of the mother?</b> Both <i>halakhot</i> are derived from the same source, so how can the <i>tanna</i> accept one and reject the other?

### Part 6
The Gemara explains: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>inter-prets</b> the word <b>“tribes,” but it is different here,</b> with regard to a woman inheriting from her son, <b>as the verse states: “And every daughter</b> who <b>possesses [<i>yoreshet</i>] an inheritance</b> from the tribes” (Numbers 36:8), which teaches that a daughter <b>inherits [<i>yoreshet</i>]</b> from two tribes, <b>but</b> she <b>does not bequeath</b> to two tribes. She bequeaths only to her father’s tribe.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The <b>order</b> of precedence with regard to <b>inheritances is this:</b> The verse states: <b>“If a man dies, and has no son, then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter”</b> (Numbers 27:8). This teaches that <b>a son precedes a daughter.</b> Additionally, <b>all descendants of a son precede a daughter. A daughter precedes the brothers</b> of the deceased. Additionally, the <b>descendants of a daughter precede the brothers</b> of the deceased. <b>Brothers</b> of the deceased <b>precede the uncles</b> of the deceased. Additionally, the <b>descendants of the brothers precede the uncles.</b>

### Part 8
<b>This is the principle:</b> Concerning <b>anyone who precedes</b> another <b>with regard to inheritance, his descendants precede</b> the other as well, <b>and a father</b> who inherits <b>precedes all of his descendants.</b>

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “If a man dies, and has no <b>son,</b> then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a son</b> precedes others with regard to the inheritance of the deceased; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>a son of a son, or a daughter of a son, or a son of a daughter of a son</b> also precedes the deceased’s other relatives? <b>The verse states:</b> “If a man dies, and <b>he has no [<i>ein lo</i>]</b> son.” The word <i>ein</i> is written <i>aleph</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>nun</i>. Therefore, the Sages read it as if it states: <b>Investigate with regard to him [<i>ayyein alav</i>],</b> to search for descendants of his son, and give the inheritance to them if they are found.

### Part 10
The next verse states: “And if he has no <b>daughter,</b> then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers” (Numbers 27:9). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a daughter</b> precedes others, except a son and his descendants, with regard to the inheritance of the deceased, <b>from where</b> then do I derive that <b>a daughter’s daughter, or a son of a daughter, or a daughter of a son of a daughter</b> also precede the deceased’s other relatives? <b>The verse states:</b> “And if he <b>has no [<i>ein lo</i>]</b> daughter.” The word <i>ein</i> is written <i>aleph</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>nun</i>. Therefore, the Sages read it as if it states: <b>Investigate with regard to him [<i>ayyein alav</i>],</b> to search for descendants of his daughter, and give the inheritance to them if they are found.
