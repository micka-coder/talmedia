### Part 1
The Gemara interjects: <b>It is written</b> concerning Joshua’s burial: “And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath <b>Serah”</b> (Joshua 24:30), <b>and it is written:</b> “And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath <b>Heres”</b> (Judges 2:9). Why is the name changed? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Initially, its fruits</b> were as dry <b>as clay [<i>keḥeres</i>], and ultimately, its fruits</b> were so plump that they were <b>spoiling [<i>masriḥin</i>]. And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> the opposite: <b>Initially,</b> the fruits were <b>spoiling</b> prematurely, <b>and ultimately,</b> they lasted as long <b>as clay</b> without spoiling.

### Part 2
<b>Caleb</b> also received his portion directly from God and not through the lottery, <b>as it is written: “And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had spoken; and he drove out from there the three sons of the giant”</b> (Judges 1:20). The Gemara asks about this verse: But <b>Hebron was a city of refuge</b> that belonged to the priests, as described in the book of Joshua (21:13); how could it have been given to Caleb? <b>Abaye said: Its outskirts [<i>parvaraha</i>],</b> i.e., only the fields and vineyards lying beyond the city limits, were given to Caleb. <b>As it is written: “But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession”</b> (Joshua 21:12).

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Both the son and the daughter</b> of the deceased are included <b>in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>inheritance. But</b> the difference is <b>that the</b> firstborn <b>son takes a double</b> portion <b>of the property of the father, and he does not take a double</b> portion <b>of the property of the mother. And</b> another difference is that <b>the daughters are sustained from the property of the father</b> after he dies, as it is a mandatory condition of their mother’s marriage contract that they are to be sustained even before the estate is disbursed to the children, <b>but the</b> daughters <b>are not sustained from the property of the mother,</b> which is all inherited by the sons.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <b>What</b> is meant by the first clause of the mishna: <b>Both the son and the daughter</b> of the deceased are included <b>in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>inheritance? If we say that</b> they <b>inherit together, didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (115a): <b>A son precedes a daughter?</b> Additionally, <b>all descendants of a son precede a daughter.</b> It is clear that a daughter does not inherit together with a son.

### Part 5
<b><i>Nafsham</i></b> is <b>a mnemonic</b> for the names of the Sages cited in the following discussion: Naḥman; Pappa; Ashi; Mar. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: Both the son and the daughter take in</b> inheritance the property <b>due</b> to their father <b>as</b> they would take <b>in</b> inheritance the property that he had <b>in</b> his <b>possession.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>We</b> already <b>learn</b> this <b>as well</b> in a mishna (116b): <b>Zelophehad’s daughters took three portions</b> of land <b>in</b> the <b>inheritance</b> of Eretz Yisrael: <b>Their father’s portion</b> that he received <b>because he was among those who left Egypt; and his portion</b> that he received <b>with his brothers in</b> the <b>property of Hepher,</b> their father, although Zelophehad predeceased his father and never was in possession of the inheritance from Hepher; and an additional portion that he received from Hepher because he was a firstborn. It is already taught in that mishna that property due to the deceased is inherited in the same manner as property possessed by the deceased.

### Part 7
<b>And furthermore,</b> if the explanation of the mishna is as stated by Rav Naḥman, <b>what</b> is meant by the phrase: <b>But</b> the difference is that the firstborn son takes a double portion of the property of the father, and he does not take a double portion of the property of the mother? According to Rav Naḥman’s explanation, what is the contrast between the two clauses in the mishna?

### Part 8
<b>Rather, Rav Pappa said: This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: Both the son and the daughter</b> of the deceased <b>take a portion of the firstborn.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>We</b> already <b>learn</b> this in a mishna <b>as well</b> (116b), which explains the third portion taken by the daughters of Zelophehad: <b>And</b> they took an additional portion that he received from Hepher, <b>as he was a firstborn,</b> and a firstborn <b>takes two portions</b> of inheritance from his father. <b>And furthermore,</b> if the explanation of the mishna is as stated by Rav Pappa, <b>what</b> is meant by the phrase: <b>But</b> the difference is that the firstborn son takes a double portion of the property of the father, and he does not take a double portion of the property of the mother? According to this explanation as well, the first clause of the mishna has nothing to do with inheriting from the mother.

### Part 10
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>both a son among the sons, and a daughter among the daughters, if</b> the father <b>says:</b> This particular child <b>shall inherit all my property, his statement stands.</b> A father can do so for any one son, or, when there are no sons, for any one daughter.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion does Rav Ashi say this? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka?</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches this later</b> (130a), as <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says: If</b> one <b>said about</b> another <b>who is fit to inherit</b> from <b>him</b> that the named individual should inherit all his property, <b>his statement stands,</b> but if one said it <b>about</b> another <b>who is unfit to inherit</b> from <b>him, his statement does not stand.</b> It is not reasonable to say that this mishna is stating the same <i>halakha</i> that is recorded in the later mishna in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.

### Part 12
<b>And if you would say that the <i>tanna</i> here taught us an unattributed</b> mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> in order to demonstrate that his opinion is accepted as <i>halakha</i>, this would not establish the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with his opinion. The reason is that this would be an instance of <b>an unattributed</b> mishna <b>and thereafter</b> a mishnaic <b>dispute</b> concerning the same matter, as in the later mishna there is a <i>tanna</i> who disagrees with the ruling of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka; <b>and</b> in an instance of <b>an unattributed</b> mishna <b>and thereafter</b> a mishnaic <b>dispute, the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with the unattributed</b> mishna.

### Part 13
<b>And furthermore,</b> if the explanation of the mishna is as stated by Rav Ashi, <b>what</b> is meant by the clause: <b>But</b> the difference is that the firstborn son takes a double portion of the property of the father, and he does not take a double portion of the property of the mother? According to this explanation as well, the first clause of the mishna has nothing to do with inheriting from the mother.

### Part 14
<b>Rather, Mar bar Rav Ashi said: This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: Both the son and the daughter are equal</b> in their rights both <b>with regard to</b> the <b>property of the mother and with regard to</b> the <b>property of the father.</b> Sons and daughters can inherit from either fathers or mothers. <b>But</b> the differences are that <b>the</b> firstborn <b>son takes a double</b> portion <b>of the property of the father, and he does not take a double</b> portion <b>of the property of the mother,</b> and that the daughters are sustained from their father’s estate before it is disbursed to the children, but they are not sustained from the property of their mother.

### Part 15
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“But he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), this means the firstborn receives <b>double</b> the property received <b>by</b> any other <b>one</b> inheritor. The <i>baraita</i> analyzes this statement: <b>Do you say</b> the firstborn receives <b>double</b> the property received <b>by</b> any <b>one</b> inheritor, <b>or rather, is it a double</b> portion <b>of all the property,</b> such that the firstborn receives two-thirds of the entire estate, which is twice the portion left for the other inheritors to divide between themselves? The <i>baraita</i> suggests: <b>And this</b> question can be resolved through <b>logical inference:</b>
