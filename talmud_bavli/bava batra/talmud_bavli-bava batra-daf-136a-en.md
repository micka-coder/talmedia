### Part 1
It is <b>as Rav Ḥisda says</b> that if it is written in the will: <b>And we acquired it from him</b> through an act of acquisition <b>in addition to this gift,</b> this formulation does not cancel the will’s power to take effect after the person’s death, as the intention of referring to it as a gift is merely to enhance the legal power of the recipient by confirming the transfer through an act of acquisition. <b>Here too,</b> in a case <b>where</b> he <b>says: Write and sign</b> a document <b>as well, and give</b> it <b>to him,</b> it is apparent that his request is to enhance the legal power of the recipient by writing a document in addition to transferring the gift itself.

### Part 2
<b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Shmuel says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one writes</b> a document <b>and gives</b> the money in this case. <b>And Rava says similarly</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one writes</b> a document <b>and gives</b> the money in this case.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A healthy person <b>who writes</b> a document granting <b>his property to his sons</b> in his lifetime, but wishes to continue to derive benefit from it until his death, <b>must write:</b> I give the property <b>from today and after</b> my <b>death.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: He need not</b> write: From today and after my death; it is sufficient for him to write that the transfer will take effect after he dies.

### Part 4
If <b>one writes</b> a document granting <b>his property to his son</b> from today and <b>after his death, the father cannot sell</b> the property <b>because it is written</b> as granted <b>to the son, and the son cannot sell</b> it <b>because it is</b> still <b>in the possession of the father</b> with regard to using the property and consuming its produce.

### Part 5
If <b>the father sold</b> the property, <b>it is sold</b> to the purchaser inasmuch as he may use it and consume its produce <b>until</b> the father <b>dies,</b> at which point it belongs to the son. If <b>the son sold</b> it during his father’s lifetime, <b>the purchaser has no</b> right to use it <b>until the father dies.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>And if he wrote:</b> I give the property <b>from today and after</b> my <b>death, what of it? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 72a): If a husband said to his wife: This is your bill of divorce from <b>today and after</b> my <b>death,</b> it is <b>a bill of divorce but not</b> a complete <b>bill of divorce, and</b> therefore <b>if he dies</b> without children his wife <b>performs the ritual through which a woman is freed of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>],</b> as perhaps the bill of divorce is invalid and she is bound by the levirate bond and may not remarry without first performing <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>But she does not enter into levirate marriage,</b> as perhaps the bill of divorce is valid, and it is forbidden for a divorcée to marry her former husband’s brother.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>There, we are uncertain if</b> the expression: And after my death, <b>is</b> meant as <b>a condition,</b> i.e., if I die you will be divorced retroactively from today, <b>or if it is a retraction</b> of the statement: From today, meaning that the divorce would take effect only after his death, which would render it invalid. <b>But here,</b> in the case of a deed of gift, there is no contradiction in the statement, as <b>this is what</b> the father <b>is</b> presumably <b>saying to him: Acquire</b> the property <b>itself today,</b> and <b>the produce after</b> my <b>death.</b>

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that <b>he need not</b> write: From today and after my death. The Gemara relates: <b>Rabba bar Avuh was sick,</b> and <b>Rav Huna and Rav Naḥman entered to</b> visit <b>him. Rav Huna said to Rav Naḥman: Ask him</b> whether the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei or</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>I do not know Rabbi Yosei’s reasoning;</b> can <b>I ask him</b> about the <b><i>halakha</i>?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>You ask him if</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with his opinion <b>or not, and I will tell you his reasoning</b> afterward.

### Part 9
Rav Naḥman <b>asked</b> Rabba bar Avuh. Rabba bar Avuh <b>said to him</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. After they left,</b> Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman that <b>this is Rabbi Yosei’s reasoning: He says</b> that writing: From today and after my death, is unnecessary because <b>the date</b> written <b>in a document proves</b> when <b>it</b> takes effect. The Gemara adds: <b>That is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ketubot</i> 8:4): <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that <b>he need not</b> write: From today and after my death, <b>because the date</b> written <b>in a document proves</b> when <b>it</b> takes effect.

### Part 10
§ <b>Rava asked Rav Naḥman: In</b> a case where the father performed an act of <b>transfer,</b> transferring his property to his son after his death, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it still necessary to write: From today and after my death? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: In</b> a case where he performed an act of <b>transfer, he need not</b> write: From today and after my death.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Pappi said: There is</b> a case of <b>transfer where</b> he <b>needs</b> to write: From today and after my death, <b>and there is</b> a case of <b>transfer where</b> he does <b>not need</b> to do so. If it is written in the deed that <b>he transferred</b> it <b>to him and we,</b> the witnesses, <b>acquired</b> it <b>from him,</b> he does <b>not need</b> to write: From today and after my death. But if the statement is written in the opposite order: <b>We acquired</b> it <b>from him and he transferred</b> it <b>to him,</b> he still <b>needs</b> to write: From today and after my death.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Ḥanina of Sura objects to this</b> distinction: <b>Is there anything that we,</b> the Sages, <b>do not know, and the scribes know?</b> The distinction between the two opposite orderings of the above statement was unknown to the Sages. The Gemara relates that the Sages <b>asked Abaye’s scribes and they knew</b> the distinction, <b>and</b> they asked <b>Rava’s scribes and they</b> also <b>knew</b> the distinction.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: Whether</b> the wording is <b>he transferred</b> it <b>to him and we acquired</b> it <b>from him,</b> or <b>whether</b> it is <b>we acquired</b> it <b>from him and he transferred</b> it <b>to him,</b> he <b>need not</b> write: From today and after my death, as the act of transfer is mentioned in any event. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei in the mishna <b>disagree</b> whether the phrase: From today and after my death, is necessary only <b>with regard to</b> a case where the deed merely states: This is <b>a record of the proceedings that took place in our presence,</b> without any mention of an act of transfer.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Kahana said: I stated</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> in the presence of Rav Zevid of Neharde’a, and he said to me: You teach it like this,</b> i.e., as a question and answer followed by a dispute; <b>we teach it like this,</b> i.e., as a single, unbroken statement: <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>in</b> a case where <b>transfer</b> is mentioned in the deed, the owner <b>need not</b> write: From today and after my death. This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>whether</b> the wording is <b>he transferred</b> it <b>to him and we acquired</b> it <b>from him,</b> or <b>whether</b> the wording is <b>we acquired</b> it <b>from him and he transferred</b> it <b>to him;</b> he <b>need not</b> write: From today and after my death. They <b>disagree</b> only <b>with regard to</b> a case where the wording is: This is <b>a record of the proceedings that took place in our presence.</b>

### Part 15
§ The mishna teaches that if <b>one writes</b> a document granting <b>his property to his son</b> from today and <b>after his death,</b> neither he nor the son can sell the property. It <b>was stated</b> that in a case where <b>the son sold</b> the property <b>during the father’s lifetime, and</b> then <b>the son died during the father’s lifetime,</b> after which the father died as well,
