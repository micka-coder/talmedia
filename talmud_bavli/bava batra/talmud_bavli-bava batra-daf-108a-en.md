The Gemara asks: <b>Let him make</b> only a larger <b>ditch and not make a smaller ditch.</b> The Gemara replies: <b>Since</b> the ditch <b>is wide,</b> the animal <b>can stand inside it and jump</b> from there over the fence. The Gemara asks: If so, <b>then let him make</b> only <b>a smaller ditch and not make</b> a larger <b>ditch? Since the ditch is small,</b> the animal <b>stands on its edge and jumps</b> over the fence. The <i>baraita</i> explains the matter further: <b>And how much</b> space is there <b>between</b> the larger <b>ditch and the smaller ditch? One handbreadth.</b>
