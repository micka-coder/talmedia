<b>Jealousy among teachers increases wisdom.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: And Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> who said that townspeople can bar craftsmen who come from other cities, <b>concedes with regard to</b> perfume <b>salesmen who travel from</b> one <b>town</b> to another <b>that</b> the townspeople <b>cannot prevent</b> them from entering their town. <b>As the Master said: Ezra instituted</b> an ordinance <b>for the Jewish people that</b> perfume <b>salesmen shall travel from town to town so that cosmetics will be available to Jewish women.</b> Since this ordinance was instituted on behalf of Jewish women, the Sages ruled that these peddlers could not be barred from entering a town.

### Part 3
The Gemara continues: <b>And this matter</b> applies only to one who seeks <b>to travel</b> from town to town as a salesman. <b>But</b> if he wants <b>to establish</b> a shop, this ruling was <b>not</b> stated, and the townspeople can prevent him from doing so. <b>And if he is a Torah scholar he may even establish</b> a shop as a perfume salesman. This is <b>like that</b> incident in <b>which Rava permitted Rabbi Yoshiya and Rav Ovadya to establish</b> a shop <b>not</b> in accordance <b>with the <i>halakha</i>. What is the reason</b> for this ruling? The reason is that <b>since they are rabbis, they are likely to be distracted from their studies</b> should they be required to travel from place to place.

### Part 4
§ The Gemara relates: There were <b>these basket sellers who brought baskets to Babylonia. The townspeople came</b> and <b>prevented them</b> from selling there. The two parties <b>came before Ravina</b> for a ruling. Ravina <b>said to them:</b> The basket sellers <b>came from outside</b> the town, <b>and they sell to</b> those from <b>outside</b> the town, i.e., to guests who are not residents of the town. The Gemara comments: <b>And this statement</b> applies only <b>on a market day,</b> when people from other towns come to shop, <b>but</b> they may <b>not</b> sell their wares <b>on non-market days. And even with regard to market days, we say</b> so <b>only</b> with regard <b>to selling in the market, but</b> this <i>halakha</i> does <b>not</b> apply <b>to circulating</b> around the town.

### Part 5
The Gemara further relates: There were <b>these wool sellers who brought wool to</b> the city of <b>Pum Nahara. The townsfolk came</b> and <b>prevented them</b> from selling it. The two parties <b>came before Rav Kahana</b> for a ruling. Rav Kahana <b>said to them: The <i>halakha</i> is that they may prevent you</b> from selling your wares. The wool sellers <b>said to him: We have debts</b> to collect in the city, and we must sell our wares in the meantime to sustain ourselves until we are paid. Rav Kahana <b>said to them: Go</b> and <b>sell the amount</b> needed <b>to sustain yourselves until you have collected your debts, and</b> then <b>leave.</b>

### Part 6
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Dimi of Neharde’a brought dried figs on a ship</b> to sell them. <b>The Exilarch said to Rava: Go</b> and <b>see; if he is a Torah scholar, reserve the market for him,</b> i.e., declare that he has the exclusive right to sell dried figs. <b>Rava said to</b> his student <b>Rav Adda bar Abba: Go</b> and <b>smell his jar,</b> i.e., determine whether or not Rav Dimi is a Torah scholar.

### Part 7
Rav Adda bar Abba <b>went</b> and <b>asked</b> Rav Dimi a question: With regard to <b>an elephant that swallowed a wicker basket and excreted it</b> intact along <b>with its waste, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the vessel still susceptible to ritual impurity or is it considered digested and not susceptible to impurity? An answer <b>was not available to</b> Rav Dimi. Rav Dimi <b>said to</b> Rav Adda bar Abba: <b>Is the Master Rava,</b> i.e., are you Rava, as you have asked me such a difficult question? Rav Adda bar Abba <b>struck him on his shoe</b> in a disparaging way and <b>said to him: There is a great</b> difference <b>between me and Rava; but I am perforce your teacher, and Rava is your teacher’s teacher.</b>

### Part 8
Based on this exchange, Rav Adda bar Abba decided that Rav Dimi was not a great Torah scholar, and therefore <b>he did not reserve the market for him, and</b> Rav Dimi <b>lost his dried figs,</b> as they rotted. Rav Dimi <b>came before Rav Yosef</b> to complain, and <b>said to him: The Master</b> should <b>see what they did to me.</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: He Who did not delay</b> retribution for <b>the humiliation of the King of Edom should not delay</b> His response to <b>your humiliation,</b> but should punish whoever distressed you, <b>as it is written: “So says the Lord: For three transgressions of Moab, indeed for four I will not reverse for him, because he burned the bones of the King of Edom into lime”</b> (Amos 2:1).

### Part 9
The Gemara reports that <b>Rav Adda bar Abba died. Rav Yosef said: I punished him,</b> i.e., I am to blame for his death, <b>as I cursed him. Rav Dimi from Neharde’a said: I punished him, as he caused my loss of dried figs. Abaye said: I punished him,</b> i.e., he was punished on my account because he did not exhibit the proper respect for me. <b>As</b> Rav Adda bar Abba <b>said to the Sages: Instead of gnawing the bones in the school of Abaye, you</b> would do <b>better</b> to <b>eat fatty meat in the school of Rava,</b> i.e., it is preferable to study with Rava than with Abaye. <b>And Rava said: I punished him, as when he would go to the butcher to buy a piece of meat, he would say to the butchers: I will take meat before Rava’s servant, as I am greater than he is.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: I punished him,</b> i.e., he was punished because of me, <b>as Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak was the head of the <i>kalla</i></b> lectures, the gatherings for Torah study during Elul and Adar. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak would teach the students immediately following the lesson taught by the head of the academy. <b>Every day, before he went in for the <i>kalla</i></b> lecture, <b>he reviewed his lecture with Rav Adda bar Abba, and then he would enter</b> the study hall <b>for the <i>kalla</i></b> lecture.

### Part 11
On <b>that day Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, seized Rav Adda bar Abba, because they had not been present at the conclusion</b> of Rava’s lecture. <b>They said to him: Tell us how Rava stated these <i>halakhot</i> of animal tithe.</b> Rav Adda bar Abba <b>said to them: Rava said this and Rava said that. Meanwhile, it grew late for Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, and Rav Adda bar Abba</b> had <b>not</b> yet <b>arrived.</b>

### Part 12
<b>The Sages said to Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak: Arise</b> and teach us, <b>as it is late for us. Why does the Master sit</b> and wait? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>said to them: I am sitting and waiting for the bier of Rav Adda bar Abba,</b> who has presumably died. <b>Meanwhile, a rumor emerged that Rav Adda bar Abba had</b> indeed <b>died.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And so too, it is reasonable</b> to conclude that <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak punished him,</b> i.e., he died as a result of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s statement, as the unfortunate event occurred just as he announced that Rav Adda bar Abba’s bier was on its way.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One whose wall was close to the wall of another may not</b> build <b>another wall close</b> to the neighbor’s wall <b>unless he distances it four cubits from</b> the wall of the neighbor. And one who desires to build a wall opposite <b>the windows</b> of a neighbor’s house must distance the wall <b>four cubits</b> from the windows, <b>whether above, below, or opposite.</b>

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: Before addressing the construction of the second wall, one could ask: <b>And</b> with regard to the <b>first</b> man, <b>how did he place</b> his wall <b>close</b> to the neighbor’s wall in the first place? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b>
