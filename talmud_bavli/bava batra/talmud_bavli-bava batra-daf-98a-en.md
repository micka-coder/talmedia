that is <b>spiced,</b> which is preserved and of lasting quality, that <b>I am selling to you,</b> then <b>he bears</b> financial <b>responsibility to provide him</b> with wine that will keep <b>until</b> the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i>. And</b> if the seller said: I am selling you <b>old</b> wine, he is responsible to provide wine <b>from the previous year. And</b> if he said: I am selling you <b>aged</b> wine, he is responsible to provide wine that is <b>from three years</b> earlier.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> When <b>they taught</b> that the seller does not bear responsibility if the wine sours, that was <b>only</b> if it soured while <b>in</b> the <b>jugs of the buyer; but</b> if it soured <b>in</b> the <b>jugs of the seller,</b> then the buyer <b>could say to him: This is your wine and this is your jug;</b> take it and reimburse me. Since it soured while still in the original jugs, it was clearly flawed from the outset.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even <b>if</b> the wine soured while in the <b>jugs of the seller, what of it? Let</b> the seller <b>say</b> to the buyer: <b>You should not have left it</b> for so long after purchasing it; I should not be responsible just because you chose to do so. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this ruling is <b>necessary</b> in a case where the buyer <b>had said to him</b> that he was purchasing the wine <b>for cooking,</b> in which case it is understood that he needs it to maintain its quality over a longer period of time, as only a small amount is used each time.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And what impelled Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, to interpret the mishna as referring to</b> a case where the wine soured while in the <b>jugs of the buyer, and where he had said to him</b> that he wanted the wine <b>for cooking?</b> Instead, <b>let him interpret it as referring to</b> a case where the wine soured while in the <b>jugs of the seller, and</b> to <b>where he had not said to him</b> that he wanted the wine <b>for cooking.</b>

### Part 5
In explanation, <b>Rava said: The mishna was difficult for him, as it teaches</b> in the following clause: <b>But if it is known</b> of this seller <b>that his wine</b> always <b>sours, then this</b> sale <b>is a mistaken transaction.</b> With regard to this clause one could ask: <b>Why</b> is that so? <b>Let</b> the seller <b>say to him: You should not have left it</b> for so long after purchasing it. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> that clause <b>that</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the buyer <b>had said to him</b> that he wants the wine <b>for cooking?</b> The Gemara concludes: Yes, one can <b>conclude from it</b> that this is so.

### Part 6
<b>And</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef, as Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef says:</b> With regard to <b>wine,</b> it is <b>the owner’s</b> poor <b>fortune</b> that <b>causes</b> the wine to go sour, <b>as it is stated: “And moreover, wine is a treacherous dealer;</b> the <b>haughty man</b> abides not” (Habakkuk 2:5), which is interpreted to mean that the wine of a haughty man will betray him, as it will sour as a punishment for his arrogance. Accordingly, since the wine soured after the buyer purchased it, he cannot place the blame upon the seller.

### Part 7
The Gemara offers additional homiletic interpretations of the verse just cited. <b>Rav Mari said: One who is haughty is not accepted even by the members of his household, as it is stated: “The haughty man abides not”</b> (Habakkuk 2:5). <b>What</b> does the phrase <b>“abides [<i>yinveh</i>] not”</b> mean? It means that <b>even in his abode [<i>naveh</i>],</b> he is not accepted.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who glorifies himself</b> by wearing <b>a garment of</b> the style worn by <b>a Torah scholar, but</b> in reality <b>he is not a Torah scholar, he will not be brought within the boundary of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> in the World-to-Come. This is alluded to by the fact that it is <b>written</b> in the verse <b>here: “Abides [<i>yinveh</i>] not,” and</b> the meaning of the word <i>yinveh</i> may be derived from that which <b>is written</b> in a verse <b>there: “To Your holy habitation [<i>neveh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 15:13).

### Part 9
<b>Rava says:</b> In the case of <b>one who sells a barrel of wine to a shopkeeper with the understanding</b> that the wine will be <b>for serving</b> to the shopkeeper’s customers and that he will be liable to pay the seller only once the barrel is finished, <b>and</b> the wine <b>spoiled</b> when <b>one-half or one-third</b> of the wine still remained, <b>the <i>halakha</i> is that</b> the seller must <b>accept</b> back the remaining wine <b>from</b> the shopkeeper, as the shopkeeper is liable to pay only for the wine that he sells. <b>And we stated this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the shopkeeper <b>had not switched the tap</b> of the barrel; <b>but</b> if <b>he had switched the tap,</b> the seller does <b>not</b> have to take the wine back and the shopkeeper must pay for it all. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>we stated this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>only where</b> the wine soured <b>before the market day arrived</b> and the shopkeeper did not have the opportunity to sell the entire barrel; <b>but</b> if the wine was still of good quality when <b>the market day arrived,</b> then the seller does <b>not</b> have to take the wine back.

### Part 10
<b>And Rava says:</b> In the case of a vintner who enters a business venture with another person who will sell the wine for him and afterward they will split the profits, then if <b>this</b> middleman <b>who receives the wine</b> to sell does so <b>with the understanding that he will bring it to the port of</b> the city of <b>Vol Shefat</b> and sell it only there, <b>and before he arrives there</b> the <b>price</b> of the wine <b>drops, the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>that</b> the vintner must <b>accept</b> the loss.

### Part 11
With regard to the previous case, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If the wine <b>becomes vinegar</b> before he reaches Vol Shefat, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Hillel said to Rav Ashi: When we were in the study hall of Rav Kahana, he said to us:</b> If the wine becomes <b>vinegar,</b> the vintner does <b>not</b> have to accept the loss; <b>and</b> this is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> who holds that as long as the wine is in the jug of the seller he is able to return it to the seller. The reason for this is that it is possible that the poor fortune of the middleman caused it to sour.

### Part 12
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>even</b> if the wine turns into <b>vinegar,</b> the vintner must <b>also accept</b> the loss. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina.</b>

### Part 13
The mishna teaches: If the seller said: I am selling you <b>old</b> wine, he is responsible to provide wine <b>from the previous year.</b> And if he said: I am selling you aged wine, he is responsible to provide wine that is from three years earlier.
