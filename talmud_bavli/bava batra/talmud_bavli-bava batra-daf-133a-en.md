### Part 1
<b>Rav Kahana said to him: If</b> the husband had <b>then acquired</b> other property, <b>would she not have taken</b> it as payment of her marriage contract? <b>And since if he</b> would have <b>then acquired</b> other property <b>she would have taken</b> it as payment of her marriage contract, <b>now she also takes</b> the deceased daughter’s share as payment of her marriage contract.

### Part 2
There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who divided his property between his wife and his son, leaving</b> out a <b>single palm tree. Ravina thought to say</b> that the wife <b>has only</b> the <b>single palm tree</b> as future payment of her marriage contract, which was presumably left out of the distribution for this reason. <b>Rav Yeimar said to Ravina: If she does not have</b> the right to collect payment of her marriage contract from all of his property, as she presumably waived that right when he gave her the gift of some of his property, <b>she does not have</b> the right to collect it from the <b>single palm tree either</b> and it belongs to the heirs. Rav Yeimar presents a different ruling: <b>Rather, since</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>she</b> does <b>descend to</b> collect the <b>palm tree, she</b> therefore <b>descends to</b> collect <b>all of the property as well,</b> i.e., she receives payment of her marriage contract from all the property.

### Part 3
§ <b>Rav Huna says:</b> With regard to <b>a person on his deathbed who wrote</b> a document granting <b>all his property to another,</b> the court <b>investigates</b> the legal status of the recipient: <b>If he is fit to inherit</b> from <b>him,</b> e.g., if he is one of his sons, <b>he takes</b> the property <b>as an inheritance, and if not, he takes it as a gift.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Naḥman said to him: Why should you steal</b> this <i>halakha</i> and not attribute it to its source? <b>If you hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, say</b> explicitly that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, as your halakhic statement follows</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka</b> that a person can bequeath his property to any of his heirs.

### Part 5
<b>Perhaps this is what you</b> meant to <b>say: There was a certain</b> childless person <b>who was dying, and</b> those around him <b>said to him: To whom should his,</b> i.e., your, <b>property</b> be given? <b>Perhaps</b> it should be given <b>to so-and-so? And he said to them: Rather, to whom</b> if not him? <b>And you,</b> Rav Huna, meant to <b>say to us: If</b> that person <b>is fit to inherit</b> from <b>him, he takes it as an inheritance, and if not, he takes it as a gift.</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: Yes, that is what I was saying.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is there a difference whether he receives it as an inheritance or as a gift? <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava,</b> who was <b>in the presence of Rava, thought</b> that it would be correct <b>to say: If he is fit to inherit</b> from <b>him,</b> the giver’s <b>widow is sustained from his property,</b> as she has the right to be sustained from the inheritance; <b>and if not,</b> and the property was given as a gift, <b>his widow is not sustained from his property.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rava said to him:</b> Can the widow’s right be <b>diminished</b> by the gift? <b>Now</b> that <b>you say with regard to inheritance,</b> which is granted <b>by Torah law,</b> that <b>his widow is sustained from his property, with regard to</b> the <b>gift</b> of a person on his deathbed, which is effective without any formal act of acquisition <b>by rabbinic law, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that the widow has sustenance rights?

### Part 8
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the difference whether it is inheritance or a gift is <b>in accordance with</b> the ruling that <b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Avya sent: According to the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> in the case of one who said: <b>My property</b> is given <b>to you, and after you to so-and-so, and the first</b> recipient <b>was fit to inherit</b> from <b>him, the second gets nothing in place of the first,</b> i.e., he does not receive the property after the first one dies, <b>as this formulation</b> employed by the owner was <b>not</b> one <b>of a gift. Rather,</b> it was <b>a formulation of inheritance, and inheritance has no end,</b> i.e., it cannot be stopped. Therefore, since the first recipient acquired it as an inheritance, his heirs inherit it from him, and it cannot be taken by the second.

### Part 9
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: But he ended it.</b> The one who bequeathed it to him ended his inheritance in advance by stating that after the first dies, the property will be given to the second. The Gemara answers: <b>He thought</b> that inheritance <b>has an end; but the Merciful One states</b> that <b>it has no end.</b>
