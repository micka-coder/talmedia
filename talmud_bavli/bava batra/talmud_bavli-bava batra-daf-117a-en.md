### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: In the mishna that teaches that Zelophehad and Hepher were entitled to portions in Eretz Yisrael, <b>we learned in accordance with</b> the opinion of the <b>one who says: Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>was divided among those who left Egypt.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that presents three opinions as to how Eretz Yisrael was divided. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says: Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>was divided among those who left Egypt, as it is stated: “According to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit”</b> (Numbers 26:55), which teaches that the Jewish people would inherit Eretz Yisrael according to the names of their fathers, i.e., those who left Egypt. Rabbi Yoshiya continues: <b>But how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance”</b> (Numbers 26:53), which indicates that the land was to be divided among those recently counted in the wilderness, i.e., those who would enter Eretz Yisrael? He answers: <b>“Unto these”</b> teaches that the land will be divided among those who are <b>like these</b> people who were counted, in that they were adults above the age of twenty, <b>to exclude the children,</b> who were not entitled to a portion in Eretz Yisrael, as they were not of age at the time of the Exodus.

### Part 3
The <i>baraita</i> presents a second opinion. <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>was divided among those who entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>as it is stated: “Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance”</b> (Numbers 26:53). <b>But how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“According to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit”</b> (Numbers 26:55)? This teaches that <b>this inheritance is different from all</b> other <b>inheritances in the world, for</b> in <b>all</b> other <b>inheritances in the world,</b> the <b>living inherit</b> from the <b>dead, but here, the dead inherit</b> from the <b>living.</b> In other words, the portions of land received by those who entered Eretz Yisrael were transferred to their fathers who left Egypt, and then inherited by the current generation, as the Gemara will now explain.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: I will tell you a parable. To what is this matter comparable? To two brothers</b> who were <b>priests</b> and <b>who were in one town. One</b> brother <b>has one son, and one</b> brother <b>has two sons, and</b> the sons all <b>went to the threshing floor</b> to collect <i>teruma</i>. <b>This</b> brother, <b>who has one son, takes one portion</b> of the <i>teruma</i> from his child, <b>and that</b> brother, <b>who has two sons, takes two portions</b> from his sons. <b>And</b> the brothers then <b>return</b> with the three portions <b>to their father, and</b> then <b>redivide</b> the portions among themselves <b>equally,</b> so that each brother receives one and one-half portions. When the brothers give their shares to their children, the son of the first brother will receive all that his father had received, while the sons of the other brother will divide what their father had received.

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> presents a third opinion. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b>
