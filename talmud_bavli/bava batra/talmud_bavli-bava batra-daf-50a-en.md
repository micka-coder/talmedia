### Part 1
<b>and one that he specified to her</b> as payment <b>for her marriage contract,</b> even though it was not stipulated explicitly in the contract; <b>and one</b> in a case <b>where she brought into</b> the marriage <b>an appraisal</b> of a field <b>from her own</b> property that she owned prior to the marriage, which took on the status of guaranteed property, meaning that she will receive it if her husband dies or divorces her. If a field of one of these three types is sold with her approval, she can claim that she did not truly consent to this sale, but stated her consent only in order to please her husband.

### Part 2
The Gemara clarifies: <b>To exclude what</b> type of property did Rabba specify these three types of fields? <b>If we say</b> that he intends <b>to exclude</b> the <b>rest of</b> the husband’s <b>property</b> secured to pay her marriage contract, it is <b>all the more so</b> the case <b>that he will bear</b> her <b>enmity</b> if she does not agree to the sale, <b>as he will say to her:</b> You <b>have placed your eyes on divorce or on</b> my <b>death,</b> i.e., you will not allow me to sell my property because you are expecting and planning for my death or our divorce. Therefore, she should be able to claim that she consented to the sale only in order to please her husband with regard to other property as well.

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> these three types of fields were specified in order <b>to exclude usufruct property,</b> i.e., property that belongs to the wife and remains in her possession while the husband has the right to enjoy the profits, in which case if the wife consents to the sale, it is valid. The Gemara asks: But <b>doesn’t Ameimar say</b> that if there was <b>a man or a woman,</b> i.e., a husband or a wife, <b>who sold</b> the wife’s <b>usufruct property, they did not accomplish anything,</b> as the sale does not take effect?

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> the statement <b>of Ameimar was stated,</b> it was to say that neither the husband nor the wife can sell the property unilaterally. <b>Where he sold</b> the property <b>and</b> then <b>died, she can come and remove</b> it from the buyer. <b>Alternatively,</b> in a case where <b>she sold</b> it <b>and</b> then <b>died, he can come and remove it, due to a rabbinic ordinance, and in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina, as Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says:</b> When the Sanhedrin convened <b>in Usha, they instituted</b> that in the case of <b>a woman who sold</b> her <b>usufruct property</b> in her husband’s lifetime <b>and</b> then <b>died, the husband repossesses</b> it <b>from the buyers.</b>

### Part 5
<b>But where the two of them sold it to someone, or if she sold it to</b> her husband, <b>the sale is valid.</b> The inference that the Gemara drew from the mishna, that if the husband produces evidence that his wife sold usufruct property to him then he is regarded as the owner, is relevant when she sells her usufruct property to him.

### Part 6
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>Ameimar said</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who holds that one can sell property only if he possesses the item itself and also has the right to enjoy its profits.

### Part 7
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who sells his</b> Canaanite <b>slave</b> to another, <b>and contracted with him</b> that the sale is <b>on the condition that</b> the slave <b>will serve</b> the seller for <b>thirty days</b> before he is transferred to the buyer, the outcome of this sale is that during those thirty days, the first master enjoys the use of the slave and the buyer is the owner of the slave himself. As detailed in the Torah (Exodus 21:18–21), if one strikes another and the injury leads directly to the victim’s death, the one who struck him is subject to court-imposed capital punishment. But if a master strikes his Canaanite slave, and the slave lingers with his injuries for more than a day or two days and then dies, the master is exempt from court-imposed capital punishment. The <i>baraita</i> addresses who is considered the owner of the slave with regard to this <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> states four opinions: <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that during those thirty days, only <b>the first</b> master <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of <b>“a day or two days”</b> (Exodus 21:21). Rabbi Meir holds that in this case, the first master is included in this exemption, <b>because</b> the slave <b>is under his</b> authority, as he enjoys the use of the slave, <b>but the second</b> master <b>is not</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of <b>“a day or two days,” because</b> the slave <b>is not under his</b> authority.

### Part 9
Rabbi Meir’s reasoning is that <b>he holds</b> that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and the <b>profits</b> it engenders is <b>like ownership of the item itself.</b> The status of the first master as the owner negates the possibility that the second master would be regarded as the owner with regard to this <i>halakha</i>, and he would not be included in the exemption.

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>the second</b> master <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of <b>“a day or two days,” because</b> the slave <b>is “his money”</b> (Exodus 21:21), i.e., his property; but <b>the first</b> master is <b>not</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of <b>“a day or two days,” because</b> the slave <b>is not “his money.”</b> Rabbi Yehuda’s reasoning is that <b>he holds</b> that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and the <b>profits</b> it engenders is <b>not like ownership of the item itself.</b> Therefore, the first master, who currently enjoys the use of the slave, does not have the status of an owner with regard to this <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that
