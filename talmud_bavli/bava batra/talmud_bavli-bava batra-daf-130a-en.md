<b>and betrothal,</b> as if a man betroths a woman and retracts the betrothal within the time required for speaking, his retraction is not effective.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <b>one who says: So-and-so will inherit</b> from <b>me, in a case where there is a daughter,</b> or: <b>My daughter will inherit</b> from <b>me, in a case where there is a son, he has said nothing, as he has stipulated counter to that which is written in the Torah</b> concerning the order of inheritance. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says: If he said</b> this <b>about one fit to inherit</b> from <b>him, his statement stands, but</b> if it was <b>about one for whom</b> it was <b>not fit to inherit</b> from <b>him, his statement does not stand.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the mishna that <b>the reason</b> the first <i>tanna</i> rules that his bequeathal is invalid is <b>that</b> he bequeathed his estate to <b>another</b> in a case <b>where</b> he had <b>a daughter, or</b> to his <b>daughter where</b> he had <b>a son, but</b> if he bequeathed his entire estate to one <b>son among</b> his other <b>sons, or</b> to one <b>daughter among</b> his other <b>daughters, his statement stands.</b> The Gemara questions this inference: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says</b> that <b>if he said</b> this <b>about one fit to inherit</b> from <b>him, his statement stands. This is</b> identical to the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>.</b> What information does this statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka add? With regard to what case do they disagree?

### Part 4
The Gemara continues: <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka is saying</b> that one’s statement stands <b>even</b> in a case where he bequeathed his estate to <b>another where</b> he had <b>a daughter or</b> to <b>a daughter where</b> he had <b>a son,</b> as although he bequeathed it to one who is not currently his heir, the beneficiary would be fit to inherit from him if the current heirs die, and this would be contrary to the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>, this is difficult. <b>And isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:18) that <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: My father and the Rabbis did not disagree about</b> a case where one bequeathed his estate to <b>another where</b> he had <b>a daughter or</b> to <b>a daughter where</b> he had <b>a son;</b> in a case such as this, my father concedes <b>that he has said nothing.</b>

### Part 5
Rabbi Yishmael continues: <b>With regard to what</b> case <b>do they disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> a case where he bequeathed his entire estate to one <b>son among</b> his other <b>sons, or</b> to one <b>daughter among</b> his other <b>daughters, as my father says</b> that the son or daughter <b>inherits</b> the entire estate, <b>and the Rabbis say</b> that <b>he does not inherit</b> it.

### Part 6
The Gemara explains: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>is saying</b> that <b>they did not disagree</b> about a case where one bequeathed his estate to another where he had a daughter or to a daughter where he had a son, <b>by inference, the first <i>tanna</i></b> of that <i>baraita</i>, to whom he was responding, <b>holds</b> that <b>they</b> did <b>disagree</b> in this case.

### Part 7
And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead that the <b>entire</b> mishna <b>is</b> stating the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, and</b> the mishna <b>is incomplete, and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> With regard to <b>one who says: So-and-so will inherit</b> from <b>me,</b> in a case <b>where there is a daughter,</b> or: <b>My daughter will inherit</b> from <b>me,</b> in a case <b>where there is a son, he has said nothing, but</b> if he bequeathed his property to one <b>son among</b> his other <b>sons, or</b> one <b>daughter among</b> his other <b>daughters,</b> then <b>if he said</b> that the son or daughter <b>will inherit all his property, his statement stands, as Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> ben Beroka <b>says: If he said</b> this <b>about one fit to inherit him,</b> that he should inherit all of his property, <b>his statement stands.</b>

### Part 8
§ As for the halakhic ruling, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. And Rava says as well</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rava said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka? The verse states: “Then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:16), which is interpreted to mean that <b>the Torah gave the father permission to bequeath</b> his estate <b>to whomever he wishes</b> among his sons.

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> Isn’t <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>derived from</b> the continuation of the verse: <b>“He may not make</b> the son of the beloved <b>the firstborn,</b> before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn”? From the prohibition against depriving the firstborn of his double portion it can be inferred that one can change the apportionment of the inheritance of his other sons.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> clause in the verse is <b>necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Ḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b>
