### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to the <b>presumptive ownership of houses; and</b> of <b>pits; and</b> of <b>ditches; and</b> of <b>caves,</b> which are used to collect water; <b>and</b> of <b>dovecotes; and</b> of <b>bathhouses; and</b> of <b>olive presses; and</b> of <b>irrigated fields,</b> which must be watered by people; <b>and</b> of <b>slaves; and all</b> similar property <b>that constantly,</b> i.e., throughout the year, <b>generates profits, their presumptive ownership</b> is established by working and profiting from them for a duration of <b>three years from day to day.</b> If the one in possession of the property can prove that he worked and profited from it for the previous three full years, there is a presumption that it belongs to him, and would remain in his possession if another were to claim that the property belonged to him or to his ancestors.

### Part 2
With regard to <b>a non-irrigated field,</b> i.e., one that is watered by rain, in which produce grows during certain seasons during the year, <b>its presumption</b> of ownership is established in <b>three years, but they are not from day to day,</b> since the fields are not worked and harvested continually throughout the three-year period.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yishmael says: Three months</b> of possession <b>in the first</b> year, <b>three</b> months of possession <b>in the last</b> year, <b>and twelve months</b> of possession <b>in the middle, which are eighteen months,</b> suffice to establish the presumption of ownership with regard to a non-irrigated field.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Akiva says: A month</b> of possession <b>in the first</b> year, <b>and a month</b> of possession <b>in the last year, and twelve months</b> of possession <b>in the middle, which are fourteen months,</b> suffice to establish the presumption of ownership with regard to a non-irrigated field.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yishmael said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that eighteen months are required for a non-irrigated field, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to a white field [<i>bisdeh lavan</i>],</b> i.e., a grain field. <b>But with regard to a field of trees,</b> once <b>he gathered his produce, and</b> then <b>harvested his olives,</b> and then <b>gathered his figs, these</b> three harvests <b>are</b> the equivalent of <b>three years.</b> Since he harvested three types of produce, this is equivalent to having possessed the field for three years.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yoá¸¥anan says: I heard from those who travel to Usha</b> to study with the Sages there <b>that they would say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that presumptive ownership</b> is established in <b>three years? From the forewarned ox: Just as</b> in the case of <b>a forewarned ox, once it has</b> intentionally <b>gored three gorings, it left</b> the <b>presumptive status of an innocuous</b> ox <b>and it is established as</b> having the <b>presumptive status of a forewarned</b> ox, <b>here too, once he has</b> worked and <b>profited</b> from the land for <b>three years,</b> the land <b>left the possession of</b> the <b>seller, and it is established</b> as being <b>in the possession of</b> the <b>buyer.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara questions this comparison: <b>If</b> so, say that <b>just as with a forewarned ox,</b> the owner <b>is not liable</b> to pay full damages <b>until the fourth goring, here too,</b> the land should <b>not be established</b> as being <b>in his possession until the fourth year.</b> The Gemara rejects this question: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, once it has gored three</b> times <b>it is forewarned,</b>
