### Part 1
<b>If</b> this is a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>has other land,</b> that he did not sell, in addition to the field that he sold with regard to which he currently wishes to testify, his creditor will <b>go after it,</b> and collect from that land. In that case, he is not biased in his testimony concerning the field that he sold. <b>If</b> this is a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>does not have other land, what difference does it make to him</b> if the buyer is unable to keep the land? In any event the creditor cannot collect directly from the seller.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> Shmuel is referring to a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>does not have other land,</b> and the reason that he is nevertheless biased in his testimony is that he wants his creditors to be able to collect the debt <b>because he says</b> to himself that it is <b>uncomfortable for him to be</b> in the category of: <b>“The wicked borrows, and pays not”</b> (Psalms 37:21).

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: But <b>ultimately, he is also</b> in the category of: <b>“The wicked borrows, and pays not”</b> (Psalms 37:21) <b>with regard to the other</b> one, to whom he sold the land. He took money from the buyer, who did not receive anything in exchange, as the land was seized from him. The Gemara answers: He is not concerned about his behavior toward the buyer, <b>as</b> he can <b>say</b> to him: <b>For this</b> very reason <b>I sold it to you without a guarantee,</b> so that if it would be seized from you I would not be liable.

### Part 4
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rava announced, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Pappa</b> who announced: All <b>those who ascend</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael <b>and</b> all <b>those who descend</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia should be aware of the following: In a case of <b>this Jew who sold a donkey to another Jew, and</b> then <b>a gentile came and seized it from him,</b> claiming that it was really his, <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>that</b> the seller should <b>rescue [<i>dimfatzei</i>] it from</b> the gentile or reimburse the buyer.

### Part 5
The Gemara points out: <b>And we said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case where the buyer <b>does not recognize that this is</b> the <b>offspring of</b> the seller’s <b>donkey,</b> and it is possible that the gentile’s claim is true. <b>But</b> if the buyer <b>recognizes that this is</b> the <b>offspring of</b> the seller’s <b>donkey,</b> then the seller is <b>not</b> liable to reimburse him. It is clear that the gentile’s claim is false, so the seller bears no responsibility for the buyer’s loss. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>we said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case where the gentile did <b>not seize it and the saddle</b> with it. <b>But</b> if he <b>seized it and the saddle</b> with it, it is clear that the gentile is a robber, and it is assumed that there is no validity to his claim with regard to the donkey. Therefore, the seller is <b>not</b> liable to reimburse him.

### Part 6
<b>Ameimar said: Even if there are not any of these</b> factors, the seller is <b>not</b> liable to reimburse him. <b>What is the reasoning</b> for this? It is that <b>it is known that an ordinary gentile is an extortionist,</b> so it is assumed that the donkey did indeed belong to the seller, <b>as it is stated: “Whose mouth speaks falsehood, and their right hand is a right hand of lying”</b> (Psalms 144:8).

### Part 7
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the statement of Shmuel (42b): <b>A craftsman does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership of the property in his possession, but a partner has the ability to establish the presumption of ownership. <b>Rabba says: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the owner <b>transferred</b> the item <b>to</b> the craftsman <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses. But</b> if the owner <b>transferred</b> the item <b>to</b> the craftsman <b>not in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> then, <b>since</b> the craftsman <b>is able to say to</b> the one who claims to be the owner: <b>These matters never occurred,</b> i.e., you did not give me this item but it was mine to begin with, and he would keep possession of the item with that claim, then <b>even when</b> the craftsman <b>says to him: It is purchased</b> by me from you, and that is why it is <b>in my possession,</b> he is <b>deemed credible.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even</b> if the owner transferred the item to the craftsman <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses as well,</b> he should be deemed credible. <b>Since</b> the craftsman <b>is able to say to</b> the owner: <b>I returned</b> the item <b>to you,</b> and he would be exempt from payment, <b>when</b> the craftsman <b>says to him: It is purchased</b> by me from you, and that is why it is <b>in my possession,</b> he is <b>deemed credible.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabba said to</b> Abaye: <b>Do you maintain</b> that
