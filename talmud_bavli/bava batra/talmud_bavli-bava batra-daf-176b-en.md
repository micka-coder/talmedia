### Part 1
<b>It is</b> only <b>a guarantor</b> who undertakes a loan guarantee <b>in</b> the presence of <b>a court who does not require an act of acquisition; this</b> indicates that <b>generally,</b> a guarantor <b>requires an act of acquisition</b> in order to be obligated to pay.

### Part 2
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a guarantor</b> who accepts responsibility for the loan <b>at the time of the giving of the money does not require an act of acquisition;</b> but if he accepts responsibility <b>after the giving of the money,</b> he <b>requires an act of acquisition.</b> Moreover, <b>a guarantor</b> who undertakes a loan guarantee <b>in</b> the presence of a <b>court does not require an act of acquisition, as</b> in return <b>for that gratification that</b> he experiences in that the court <b>trusts him, he resolves to obligate himself.</b>
