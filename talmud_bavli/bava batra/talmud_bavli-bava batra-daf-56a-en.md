and <b>in one domain,</b> i.e., he carried half the dried fig into the same public domain each time, he is <b>liable,</b> but if it was <b>in two domains,</b> i.e., he carried the item into two separate public domains, he is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And Rabba says</b> in explanation of Rabbi Yosei’s opinion: <b>And this</b> division of the public domain applies only <b>where there is</b> a property where one would incur <b>liability</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering</b> if one unintentionally carried out of it or into it, i.e., a private domain, <b>between</b> the two sections. <b>But</b> if there was only <b>a <i>karmelit</i>,</b> i.e., an area that is not defined as either a private domain or public domain and to and from which the prohibition against carrying is only of rabbinic origin, it does <b>not</b> divide the public domain. <b>Abaye says: Even a <i>karmelit</i></b> divides the public domain into separate sections, <b>but a beam [<i>pisela</i>]</b> does <b>not. Rava says: Even a beam</b> divides the public domain, since it is no less than a boundary or sea squill, which do serve as a barrier between fields.

### Part 3
The Gemara notes: <b>And Rava follows his</b> own line of <b>reasoning, as Rava says:</b> The definition of <b>a domain</b> for the purpose of <b>Shabbat is like</b> the definition of <b>a domain</b> for the purpose of <b>bills of divorce:</b> Just as a beam is defined as a distinct domain for the purpose of bills of divorce, so too it is considered a distinct domain for the purpose of Shabbat.

### Part 4
The Gemara returns to discuss the acquisition of a field that belonged to a convert who died without heirs. The Gemara asks: If <b>there was no boundary and</b> there was <b>no sea squill, what</b> are the limits to the acquisition? <b>Rabbi Marinus explains in the name</b> of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Any</b> area <b>that is called by his name.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> where it is called by his name? <b>Rav Pappa said: Where it is called: The place</b> that is irrigated by <b>so-and-so’s well.</b> The entire area referred to as such would be considered one section with regard to acquisition.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Avya sat before Rabbi Asi, and he sat and was saying</b> the following <b>in the name of Rabbi Asi bar Ḥanina:</b> A row of <b>sea squill serves as a barrier with regard to the property of a convert</b> who died without heirs, so that each section is considered a distinct field.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>sea squill? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> It is the growth <b>by which Joshua established the boundaries of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>for the Jews.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara teaches a related statement. <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In his book, <b>Joshua enumerated only the towns that stand upon the borders,</b> but not the towns that were within the portions of each tribe.

### Part 8
On the subject of the boundaries of Eretz Yisrael, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Any</b> area <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, showed to Moses</b> before his death, as it is written: “And the Lord showed him all the land, Gilead…as far as Zoar” (Deuteronomy 34:1–3), is within the boundaries of Eretz Yisrael, and therefore produce that grows there is <b>obligated in tithe.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>To exclude what</b> area? The Gemara answers: <b>To exclude</b> the lands of the <b>Kenite, Kenizzite, and Kadmonite,</b> as God had promised to Abraham at the Covenant between the Pieces: “To your offspring have I given this land…to…the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite” (Genesis 15:18–19). These areas are not obligated in tithe. What are these three areas? It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> They are <b>Naftuḥa, Arva’a, and Shalma’a. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> They are <b>Mount Seir, Ammon, and Moab. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> They are <b>Ardisekis, Asya, and Aspamya.</b>

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>there were two</b> witnesses <b>testifying on his behalf that</b> he, the possessor of the land, worked and <b>profited</b> from a field for <b>three years,</b> and therefore has presumptive ownership, <b>and they were found</b> to be <b>conspiring</b> witnesses, as it was proven that they were not present to witness the matter about which they had testified, they must <b>pay</b> the true owner of the field <b>the full</b> value of the field that they attempted, through their testimony, to remove from his possession, as it is written in the Torah: “Then shall you do to him, as he had planned to do to his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19). If <b>two</b> witnesses testify that he worked and profited from the field <b>during the first</b> year, another <b>two</b> testify that he worked and profited from it <b>during the second</b> year, <b>and</b> another <b>two</b> testify that he worked and profited from it <b>during the third,</b> and all were found to be conspiring witnesses,
