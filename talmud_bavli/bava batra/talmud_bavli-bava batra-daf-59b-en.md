### Part 1
<b>and</b> the owner of the courtyard <b>can protest</b> its construction. If it protrudes <b>less than a handbreadth,</b> the owner of the house <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use, <b>and</b> the owner of the courtyard <b>cannot protest</b> its construction.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Mani says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that <b>Rabbi Mani says:</b> If one <b>established an acquired privilege with regard to</b> a projection of <b>a handbreadth,</b> he has <b>established an acquired privilege with regard to four</b> handbreadths. The Gemara asks: <b>What is he saying? Abaye said</b> that <b>this</b> is what he <b>is saying:</b> If one <b>established an acquired privilege</b> with regard to a projection that measures <b>one handbreadth wide by four</b> handbreadths <b>long,</b> he has <b>established an acquired privilege with regard to</b> extending the projection to <b>a width</b> of <b>four</b> handbreadths.

### Part 3
The mishna teaches that if the projection protrudes <b>less than a handbreadth</b> the owner of the house <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use, <b>and</b> the owner of the courtyard <b>cannot protest. Rav Huna says: They taught only</b> that the <b>owner of the roof</b> cannot protest the actions <b>of</b> the <b>owner of the courtyard,</b> i.e., he may not demand that the owner of the courtyard refrain from construction that interferes with the former’s use of the projection. <b>But</b> the <b>owner of the courtyard can protest</b> the actions <b>of</b> the <b>owner of the roof,</b> and demand that the latter not build a projection of any size, even less than a handbreadth. He can also demand that the owner of the roof not use an existing projection, since it leads to damage caused by sight. <b>And Rav Yehuda says: Even</b> the <b>owner of the courtyard cannot protest</b> the actions <b>of</b> the <b>owner of the roof.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say that</b> they <b>disagree with regard to damage</b> caused by <b>sight? As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Huna, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is considered</b> to be <b>damage,</b> and therefore the owner of the courtyard can protest, since the owner of the roof has the means to see into the other’s courtyard when using this projection, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is not considered</b> to be <b>damage.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No, everyone</b> agrees that damage caused by sight <b>is considered</b> to be <b>damage. And</b> Rav Yehuda holds it <b>is different here, as</b> the owner of the roof can <b>say to</b> the owner of the courtyard: The projection <b>is not suitable for use,</b> since it is too small for me to stand upon and look into the courtyard. <b>For what</b> purpose <b>is it suitable? To hang items on it,</b> and nothing more. <b>I will turn my face</b> away <b>and hang</b> items <b>on it</b> without looking into your courtyard.

### Part 6
<b>And the other</b> <i>amora</i>, Rav Huna, holds that the owner of the courtyard can <b>say to</b> the owner of the roof: There may be <b>times when you are frightened</b> due to the height of the projection, and you will look into my courtyard while using it.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person may not open his windows,</b> i.e., build an opening in a wall to use as a window, <b>into a courtyard belonging to partners,</b> i.e., a courtyard in which he is a partner. If he <b>purchased a house in another,</b> adjacent <b>courtyard,</b> he <b>may not open</b> the house <b>into a courtyard belonging to partners.</b> If he <b>built a loft on top of his house, he may not open it into a courtyard belonging to partners. Rather, if he desired</b> to build a loft, he may <b>build a room within his house, or</b> he may <b>build a loft on top of his house, and open it into his house,</b> not directly into the courtyard.

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s ruling that one may not open a window into a courtyard that he co-owns, the Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> did the mishna <b>specifically</b> render it prohibited for one to open a window <b>into a courtyard belonging to partners?</b> One may <b>not</b> open a window <b>into another’s courtyard either,</b> as it will lead to damage caused by sight.

### Part 9
The Gemara replies that the mishna <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> as follows: <b>It is not necessary</b> to say <b>that</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted for one to open a window <b>into another’s courtyard,</b> where he is certainly not allowed to look; <b>but</b> where one wants to open a window <b>into a courtyard belonging to partners, where</b> the owner of the window can <b>say to</b> the other partner: <b>Ultimately,</b> since <b>you need to conceal</b> yourself <b>from me</b> and conduct yourself modestly <b>in the courtyard</b> where I too am a partner and have the right to be present, why does it bother you if I open a window into there? Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us that</b> the partner may <b>say to him: Until now I needed to conceal</b> myself <b>from you</b> only when we were both <b>in the courtyard. Now I will need to conceal</b> myself <b>from you even in the house,</b> as you can see into my house from your window.

### Part 10
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving a person who opened his windows into a courtyard belonging to partners and came before Rabbi Yishmael bar Rabbi Yosei,</b> who <b>said to him: You have established an acquired privilege, my son; you have established an acquired privilege,</b> and you may not be prevented from using the windows. <b>And he came before Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who <b>said</b> to him: <b>You toiled and opened</b> the windows; you must <b>toil and seal</b> them, as the partners have the right to prevent you from using these windows.
