<b>but</b> if they came <b>at night, even</b> if <b>three</b> men came to visit the sick person, <b>they may write</b> the will and sign it as witnesses <b>but they may not act</b> in <b>judgment. What is the reason</b> that they may not act in judgment the next day? It is <b>because they are</b> already <b>witnesses</b> to the will of the deceased, <b>and</b> there is a principle that <b>a witness cannot become a judge,</b> i.e., one who acts as a witness in a particular matter cannot become a judge with regard to that same matter? Rabba bar Ḥanina <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so;</b> this is what <b>I was saying.</b>

### Part 2
§ After mentioning Rav Yehuda’s ruling the Gemara cites a related dispute. It <b>was stated:</b> With regard to <b>a transaction, until when</b> may one of the parties <b>renege</b> on the transaction? <b>Rabba says: As long as they are seated</b> in the same location they may renege on the transaction. <b>Rav Yosef says: As long as they are dealing with that matter,</b> i.e., they are still discussing that transaction, they may renege on it.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yosef said: It stands to reason in accordance with my opinion, as Rav Yehuda says:</b> In a case where there were <b>three</b> men <b>who entered</b> a room <b>to visit a sick person</b> and the sick person desires to write a will in order to distribute his property following his death, if the visitors <b>wish</b> to do so <b>they may write</b> his will and sign it as witnesses. And if <b>they wish, they may act</b> in <b>judgment. And if it enters your mind</b> that one may renege on a deal <b>as long as they are seated</b> in the same location, then <b>let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he will renege on</b> his decision. How can the visitors act in judgment in a case where the matter has not been resolved, as the sick person may still change his mind?

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ashi said: I stated this <i>halakha</i> before Rav Kahana</b> and I asked him: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef, does it work out well? But</b> even according to his opinion there <b>should be a concern</b> that <b>perhaps he will renege on</b> his decision, as Rav Yosef holds that one may renege on a transaction as long as the two parties are still dealing with that matter. <b>Rather, what have you to say?</b> That according to Rav Yosef, Rav Yehuda’s ruling applies <b>where they withdrew</b>
