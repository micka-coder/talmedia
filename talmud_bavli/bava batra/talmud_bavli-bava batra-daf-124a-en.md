### Part 1
<b>so too</b> in the case of a cow that was <b>leased or rented,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring only to a case where <b>the enhancement came by itself, as</b> the brothers <b>did not lose</b> money for <b>its sustenance,</b> since it was stipulated that the one who rented or leased it would provide its feed.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the <i>baraita</i>. In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is the <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:4): <b>A firstborn does not take a double</b> portion <b>of the enhancement of the property</b> that occurred <b>after the death of</b> the sons’ <b>father. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that <b>a firstborn does take a double</b> portion <b>of the enhancement of the property</b> that occurred by itself <b>after their father’s death,</b> e.g., the birth of a calf, <b>but not of the enhancement that the orphans caused after their father’s death.</b>

### Part 3
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi continues: Therefore, if they <b>inherited a promissory note</b> indicating a debt owed to their father, the <b>firstborn takes a double</b> portion of the money when it is collected, as this is an enhancement to the estate that came by itself. The Gemara adds: In a case where <b>a promissory note emerged against them</b> for their father’s debt, the <b>firstborn gives,</b> i.e., repays, <b>a double</b> portion of the debt. <b>But if he says: I am not giving</b> a double portion of the debt <b>and I am not taking</b> a double portion of the estate, he is <b>permitted</b> to do so, and he is exempt from paying a double portion.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of the Rabbis</b> that the firstborn does not receive a double portion of any enhancements that occur after the death of the father? <b>The verse states: “Giving him a double portion”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17); by employing the term “giving” <b>the Merciful One calls</b> the double portion <b>a gift. Just as</b> a recipient of a gift does not acquire <b>a gift unless it</b> first <b>reaches the possession of</b> the one giving the gift, <b>so too</b> the firstborn does not acquire <b>the portion of the firstborn unless it has reached the possession of</b> the father before he died.

### Part 5
<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that the reason for his ruling that a firstborn receives a double portion of the enhancement is that <b>the verse states: “A double portion”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17). It <b>juxtaposes the portion of the firstborn to the portion of an ordinary</b> son, in that <b>just as the portion of an ordinary</b> son is inherited <b>even</b> from property <b>that did not reach</b> the father’s <b>possession</b> before he died, <b>so too, the portion of the firstborn</b> is inherited <b>even</b> from property <b>that did not reach</b> the father’s <b>possession</b> before he died.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the Rabbis as well, isn’t</b> the phrase <b>“a double portion” written?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> phrase can be said to teach a different <i>halakha</i>, requiring the brothers <b>to give</b> the firstborn both of his portions <b>on one border,</b> i.e., adjoining, and not in separate locations.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>as well, isn’t</b> the phrase <b>“giving him” written?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> phrase can be said to teach a different <i>halakha</i>, <b>that if</b> the firstborn <b>says: I am not taking</b> a double portion of the estate <b>and I am not giving</b> a double portion of the debt, he is <b>permitted</b> to do so. Since the inheritance is referred to as a gift, he has the right to refuse it.

### Part 8
The Gemara discusses several types of enhancement. <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> With regard to <b>a palm tree that</b> became enhanced by <b>growing broader</b> after the father’s death, or <b>land that yielded silt</b> and thereby became enhanced, <b>everyone agrees that</b> the firstborn <b>takes</b> a double portion of the enhancement. <b>When they disagree</b> is in a case <b>when fodder [<i>baḥafura</i>],</b> i.e., grain that has grown stalks but is not yet ripe, <b>becomes full ears,</b> of grain, and when <b>date flowers [<i>shelofafei</i>] become</b> fully developed <b>dates.</b> As one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that since this <b>enhancement</b> develops <b>by itself,</b> the firstborn is entitled to a double portion of it, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that since the item <b>transformed,</b> it is not considered the same item that was in the father’s possession, and the firstborn is not entitled to a double portion of it.

### Part 9
§ <b>Rabba bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya says:</b> A judge who <b>acted,</b> i.e., ruled, <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>has acted</b> legally, and one who acted <b>in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis has</b> also <b>acted</b> legally. Either way, the decision stands.
