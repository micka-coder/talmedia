### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>Due to his keen</b> mind, <b>he did not analyze</b> the mishna carefully.

### Part 2
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raised a dilemma:</b> With regard to the claim of <b>a father of the</b> deceased’s <b>father and</b> the claim of the deceased’s <b>brother, such as</b> the claims of <b>Abraham and Jacob to the property of Esau,</b> who was Abraham’s grandson and Jacob’s brother, <b>which of them precedes</b> the other and inherits the property? <b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: <b>A father precedes all of his descendants,</b> therefore, Abraham would inherit, as Jacob was his descendant. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why did <b>Rami bar Ḥama</b> have a dilemma; presumably, he was aware of the statement of the mishna? The Gemara answers: Rami bar Ḥama understood that the mishna teaches that a father <b>precedes</b> only <b>his own</b> immediate <b>descendants, but not the descendants of his son.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara notes that <b>so too, it is reasonable</b> to understand the mishna in that manner, <b>as it teaches: This is the principle: Anyone who precedes</b> another <b>with regard to inheritance, his descendants precede</b> the other as well. <b>And if Isaac were</b> alive, <b>Isaac</b> would <b>precede</b> Abraham and inherit Esau’s property. <b>Now, also, when Isaac is not</b> alive, <b>Jacob</b> should <b>precede</b> Abraham, because of the principle that the descendants of one who precedes another with regard to inheritance also precede the other. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> this clause of the mishna that the brother of the deceased precedes the grandfather.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Zelophehad’s daughters took three portions</b> of land <b>in</b> the <b>inheritance</b> of Eretz Yisrael: <b>Their father’s portion</b> that he received <b>because he was among those who left Egypt; and his portion</b> that he received <b>with his brothers in</b> the <b>property of Hepher,</b> their father; <b>and</b> an additional portion that he received from Hepher <b>because he was a firstborn,</b> and a firstborn <b>takes two portions</b> of inheritance from his father.
