### Part 1
<b>Rav Amram says:</b> It is <b>because</b> one <b>may not learn</b> any new details <b>from</b> the <b>final line</b> of a document. There is a concern that the holder of the document may have written in an extra line of text to his advantage, between the text and the witnesses’ signatures. Therefore, any new information contained in the last line is disregarded. Since the final line is disregarded, it is necessary that the final line of a document contain only a review of what is already written in it.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Naḥman said to Rav Amram: From where do you</b> know <b>this?</b> Rav Amram <b>said to him: As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:1): If one writing a document <b>distanced the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>two lines from the text</b> of the document, leaving two lines blank, the document is <b>not valid,</b> as it would be possible for the holder of the document to fill in false information in those lines. But if one distanced the signatures <b>one line</b> from the text, the document is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 3
Rav Amram analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is different</b> in the case of <b>two</b> blank <b>lines</b> that that the document is not valid? If you say that <b>perhaps</b> the holder of the document will take advantage of those two blank lines, and <b>forge</b> unverified information <b>and write</b> it in those lines, then in the case of <b>one line</b> left blank <b>as well,</b> he can <b>forge</b> information <b>and write</b> it in that line. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that one <b>may not learn</b> any new details <b>from</b> the <b>final line</b> of a document? Therefore, only when two lines are left blank is there a concern that false information would be added to the penultimate line. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that it is so.
