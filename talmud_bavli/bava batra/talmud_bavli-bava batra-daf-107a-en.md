### Part 1
The Gemara answers: The cases cannot be compared because <b>there,</b> in the case of the sale of grain, <b>the Sages instituted a matter that is suitable for the seller and</b> also <b>suitable for the buyer.</b> Since the price of grain fluctuates, neither party wants the sale to be considered complete until the last <i>se’a</i> is measured out, so that they each are able to renege on the sale should the price rise or fall. This reasoning does not apply in cases of division of property.

### Part 2
§ <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about another related matter: If <b>two brothers divided</b> their father’s estate between them, <b>and</b> then their father’s <b>creditor came and took the portion of one of them</b> as repayment for the father’s debt, <b>Rav says: The</b> original <b>division</b> of the property <b>is void,</b> and the brothers must now redivide the remaining assets. <b>Shmuel says:</b> Each brother, upon receiving his portion, <b>has foregone</b> his right to be reimbursed if his portion is lost. <b>Rav Asi says:</b> The brother whose portion was seized is entitled to half the remaining inheritance: <b>He takes one-quarter in land and one-quarter in money.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara explains the rationale for each opinion: <b>Rav says</b> that <b>the</b> original <b>division</b> of the property <b>is void.</b> This is because <b>he holds that brothers who divided</b> property received as an inheritance <b>are</b> still considered to be <b>heirs</b> with regard to the inheritance as if they never divided the property, so that they continue to share joint responsibility for their father’s debts. Therefore, if a creditor seizes the portion received by one of them, it is as if he repaid the debt on behalf of all the heirs. Accordingly, they must once again divide the remaining property between them.

### Part 4
<b>And Shmuel says</b> that each brother, upon receiving his portion, <b>has foregone</b> his right to be reimbursed if his portion is lost, <b>as he holds</b> that <b>brothers who divided</b> property received as an inheritance <b>are</b> considered as <b>purchasers</b> from each other. <b>And</b> each one is considered <b>like a purchaser</b> who bought his portion <b>without a guarantee</b> that if the field is seized in payment of a debt, the seller will compensate the buyer for his loss. Accordingly, the brother whose portion of the estate was seized by the creditor has no claim against the brother whose portion remained untouched.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Asi is uncertain whether</b> brothers who divided property received as an inheritance <b>are</b> still considered to be <b>heirs or are</b> considered to be like <b>purchasers</b> who bought their property with a guarantee of compensation should the property be repossessed. <b>Therefore,</b> the brother whose portion was seized by the creditor is entitled to half the remaining inheritance, and <b>he takes one-quarter in land</b> like an heir <b>and one-quarter</b> he receives <b>in money,</b> like a purchaser with a guarantee, who is compensated with money for his loss.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Pappa says: The <i>halakha</i> in all</b> the cases dealt with in <b>these statements</b> recording disagreements between Rav and Shmuel is that the brothers must each <b>take off a share</b> from their portion in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel. Rather, any brother currently in possession of his portion must give part of it to his brother who lacks a portion, so that in the end they have equal shares. <b>Ameimar says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> in all of these cases is that <b>the</b> original <b>division</b> of the property <b>is void,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rav. The Gemara concludes: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is</b> in fact that <b>the</b> original <b>division</b> of the property <b>is void,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rav.

### Part 7
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ketubot</i> 11:2): In a case of <b>three</b> experts <b>who went down to assess</b> a certain property in order to determine the amount to be collected from it for repayment of a debt, and <b>one says</b> it is worth <b>one hundred dinars, and</b> the other <b>two say</b> it is worth <b>two hundred,</b> or <b>one says</b> it is worth <b>two hundred</b> dinars <b>and</b> the other <b>two say</b> it is worth <b>one hundred,</b> the assessment of <b>the single</b> expert <b>is nullified, since</b> his is <b>the minority</b> opinion, and the assessment of the two others is accepted.

### Part 8
If <b>one says</b> the property is worth <b>one hundred dinars, and another says</b> it is worth <b>twenty</b> <i>sela</i>, which is equivalent to eighty dinars, since four dinars equal a <i>sela</i>, <b>and</b> yet <b>another says</b> it is worth <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, which is equivalent to one hundred and twenty dinars, <b>it is assessed at one hundred dinars,</b> which is the average of the assessments, as it is equivalent to twenty-five <i>sela</i>. <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: It is assessed at ninety</b> dinars, as will be explained below. <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say: An appraisal</b> is <b>performed</b> of the sum <b>between</b> the two most extreme assessments <b>and</b> then <b>divided by three.</b> This sum is then added to the lowest assessment.

### Part 9
The Gemara clarifies the various opinions: <b>The one who says</b> that the property <b>is assessed at one hundred dinars</b> holds that <b>the middle</b> of the two extreme assessments is followed. <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says</b> that <b>it is assessed at ninety</b> dinars because <b>he holds that this land</b>
