### Part 1
Rav Pappi and Rav Pappa disagree with regard to Rava’s intention. One <b>Sage,</b> Rav Pappi, <b>holds</b> that <b>he has done nothing with regard to</b> his brother’s <b>portion,</b> as he had no right to sell it; with regard to his own additional portion, the sale was valid, as it was in his possession even before the division of the property. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Pappa, <b>holds</b> that he has done nothing <b>with regard to all</b> of the property, as he does not possess the additional portion before the property is divided between the brothers.

### Part 2
The Gemara notes that <b>they sent</b> a ruling <b>from there,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>A firstborn who sold</b> his additional portion <b>before</b> the <b>division</b> of the property <b>has done nothing. Apparently,</b> the Sages of Eretz Yisrael hold that <b>a firstborn does not have</b> a right to his additional portion <b>before</b> the <b>division. But the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a firstborn has</b> a right to his additional portion <b>before</b> the <b>division.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara relates: <b>Mar Zutra of</b> the house <b>of Rishba,</b> who was a firstborn, <b>divided a basket of peppers</b> from the estate of his father <b>with</b> his <b>brothers equally.</b> He <b>came before Rav Ashi</b> to claim a double portion of the rest of the estate. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Since you relinquished</b> your additional portion <b>with regard to some</b> of the estate, <b>you have relinquished</b> your additional portion <b>with regard to all of the property,</b> as a firstborn has a right to his additional portion before the division.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <b>one who says: So-and-so, my firstborn son, will not take a double</b> portion of my estate; or one who says: <b>So-and-so, my son, will not inherit</b> my estate <b>among his brothers, he has said nothing, as he has stipulated counter to that which is written in the Torah.</b>

### Part 5
With regard to <b>one</b> on his deathbed <b>who apportions his property orally,</b> granting it to his sons as a gift, and he <b>increased</b> the portion given <b>to one</b> of his sons <b>and reduced</b> the portion given <b>to one</b> son, <b>or equated</b> the portion of <b>the firstborn to</b> the portions of the other sons, <b>his statement stands. But if he said</b> that they will receive the property not as a gift but <b>as inheritance, he has said nothing.</b> If he <b>wrote</b> in his will, <b>whether at the beginning, or in the middle, or at the end,</b> that he is granting them the property <b>as a gift, his statement stands.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as if</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, doesn’t he say</b> elsewhere that if one stipulates counter to that which is written in the Torah <b>with regard to monetary matters, his stipulation stands?</b>

### Part 7
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 3:7): If one <b>says to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me on the condition that you have no</b> ability to claim <b>from me food, clothing, and conjugal rights, she is betrothed and his stipulation is void;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: With regard to monetary matters,</b> such as food and clothing, <b>his stipulation stands,</b> despite being counter to that which is written in the Torah. According to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, one should be able to stipulate that his firstborn son not receive a double portion, or that one of his sons not inherit from him at all, as inheritance is a monetary matter.

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, there,</b> the woman <b>knew</b> of his stipulation <b>and waived</b> her rights. Therefore, the stipulation stands. <b>Here,</b> the son whose portion was reduced <b>did not waive</b> his portion. Therefore the stipulation is not valid.

### Part 9
§ <b>Rav Yosef says</b> that if a man <b>says: So-and-so is my firstborn son,</b> the son <b>takes a double</b> portion of his inheritance based on this testimony. If he says: <b>So-and-so is a firstborn,</b> the son <b>does not take a double</b> portion, as <b>perhaps</b> the man <b>was saying</b> that the son is his <b>mother’s firstborn</b> but not his own firstborn.

### Part 10
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who came before Rabba bar bar Ḥana</b> and <b>said to him: I know that this</b> man <b>is a firstborn.</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>said to him: From where do you know?</b> He answered: <b>Because his father would call him a foolish firstborn.</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana replied: <b>Perhaps he is</b> his <b>mother’s firstborn, as any firstborn of a mother is also called a foolish firstborn.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who came before Rabbi Ḥanina</b> and <b>said to him: I know that this</b> man <b>is a firstborn.</b> Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to him: From where do you know? He said to</b> Rabbi Ḥanina: <b>Because when</b> people <b>would come before his father</b> to obtain a cure for their ailing eyes, <b>he would say to them: Go to my son Shikhḥat, as he is a firstborn and his saliva heals</b> this ailment.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps he is</b> his <b>mother’s firstborn?</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that <b>the saliva of a father’s firstborn heals</b> this ailment but <b>the saliva of a mother’s firstborn does not heal</b> this ailment.

### Part 13
§ <b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> In the case of <b>one whose sexual organs are indeterminate [<i>tumtum</i>]</b> and <b>whose</b> skin <b>became perforated</b> so that his genitals were exposed <b>and</b> he <b>was found</b> to be <b>a male,</b> he <b>does not take a double</b> portion of his father’s estate. <b>As the verse states: “And if the firstborn son was [<i>vehaya</i>] hers that was hated”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:15), which is interpreted to mean that he is not considered a firstborn <b>unless he is</b> recognized as <b>a son,</b> i.e., male, <b>from the moment of</b> his coming into <b>being [<i>havaya</i>],</b> i.e., his birth.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> A <i>tumtum</i> who was found to be male <b>is also not judged as a stubborn and rebellious son, as the verse states: “If there will be [<i>yihyeh</i>] to a man a stubborn and rebellious son”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:18), which is interpreted to mean that one is not judged in this manner <b>unless he is</b> recognized as <b>a son from the moment of</b> his coming into <b>being.</b>
