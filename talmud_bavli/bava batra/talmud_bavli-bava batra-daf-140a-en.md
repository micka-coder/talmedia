### Part 1
shall the <b>daughters take all</b> of the estate, even if it is more than is required for their sustenance? <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The court <b>appropriates sustenance for the daughters until they reach their majority, and the remainder</b> is given <b>to the sons.</b>

### Part 2
§ The Gemara comments: It is <b>obvious</b> that if the estate was <b>large and became small,</b> the <b>heirs,</b> i.e., the sons, <b>already acquired it</b> when it was large. It remains in their possession, and they must provide for the daughters from it. The Gemara asks: If the estate was <b>small,</b> and was therefore not inherited by the sons, <b>and</b> then it <b>became large, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does even a small estate <b>remain in the possession of the heirs,</b> while the court reserves it for the daughters’ sustenance, and <b>therefore it appreciated in the possession of</b> the <b>heirs</b> and they receive the appreciation in the estate’s value? <b>Or perhaps</b> the <b>heirs are</b> totally <b>removed from</b> possession of a small estate, and the appreciation in value is to the benefit of the daughters receiving sustenance.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of <b>orphans who preemptively sold</b> land <b>from a small estate</b> left to them by their father, before the court appropriated it for the daughters’ sustenance, concerning <b>that which they sold,</b> the <b>sale</b> is valid, even though they acted improperly. One can infer from this that a small estate remains in the possession of the heirs even when they are not authorized to derive benefit from it, and therefore the appreciation in its value belongs to them.

### Part 4
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya was sitting before Rabbi Abbahu and raised</b> the following <b>dilemma before him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the sustenance to which the deceased’s <b>widow</b> is entitled? Does it <b>reduce</b> the value of <b>the estate</b> when evaluating whether the estate is categorized as a large estate or a small estate? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since she has</b> a right to receive <b>sustenance,</b> it <b>reduces</b> the value of the estate? <b>Or perhaps</b> we say that <b>since if she remarries she does not have</b> a right to sustenance, <b>now as well,</b> for the purposes of determining the value of the estate, she is considered as if <b>she does not have</b> a right to sustenance, and therefore it does not reduce the value of the estate.

### Part 5
Furthermore, <b>if you say</b> that <b>since, if she remarries she does not have</b> a right to sustenance, <b>now as well</b> she is considered as if <b>she does not have</b> a right to sustenance, and it is not taken into account when evaluating the estate, then another dilemma can be raised: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the sustenance one pledged to give, for a certain number of years, to the <b>daughter of his wife</b> from a previous marriage, i.e., his step-daughter, which is an obligation not affected by his death or by her marriage? Does it <b>reduce</b> the value of <b>the estate? Do we say</b> that <b>since, when she marries she also has</b> a right to sustenance, it <b>reduces</b> the value of the estate? <b>Or perhaps</b> we say that <b>since, if she dies she does not have</b> a right to sustenance, it <b>does not reduce</b> the value of the estate.

### Part 6
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>since, if she dies she does not have</b> a right to sustenance, therefore it <b>does not reduce</b> the value of the estate, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a debt owed to the deceased’s <b>creditor?</b> Does it <b>reduce</b> the value of <b>the estate? Do we say</b> that <b>since, when</b> the creditor <b>dies he also has</b> a right to the money owed him, and it is collected by his heirs, therefore it <b>reduces</b> the value of the estate? <b>Or perhaps</b> we say that <b>since it has not yet been collected,</b> it <b>does not reduce</b> the value of the estate.

### Part 7
<b>And there are</b> those who say <b>that</b> Rabbi Yirmeya <b>raised the dilemmas in the opposite direction,</b> i.e., in the reverse order: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a debt owed to <b>a creditor?</b> Does it <b>reduce</b> the value of <b>the estate?</b>
