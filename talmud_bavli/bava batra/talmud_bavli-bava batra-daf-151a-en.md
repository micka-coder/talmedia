### Part 1
A scribe may <b>write a deed</b> of sale <b>for the seller</b> of property at the seller’s request, <b>even if the buyer is not with him</b> when he presents his request, as the deed obligates only the seller. In this case, <b>once this</b> one, the buyer, <b>has taken possession of the land, the deed is acquired, wherever it is. And this is</b> as it is stated in the mishna <b>that we learned</b> (<i>Kiddushin</i> 26a): <b>Property that does not serve as a guarantee can be acquired</b> together <b>with the property that serves as a guarantee by</b> means of <b>money, by</b> means of <b>a deed, or by taking possession</b> of it. One can learn from this that a deed is included in the term: Property that does not serve as a guarantee.

### Part 2
<b>An animal is called property, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 12a): In a case of <b>one who consecrated his property, and on</b> the property <b>there were animals fit to</b> be sacrificed <b>upon</b> the <b>altar, male</b> animals are sacrificed as <b>burnt-offerings, and female</b> animals <b>are sold for the purpose of</b> being sacrificed as <b>peace-offerings. Birds are called property, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 12a): In a case of <b>one who consecrated his property, and on</b> the property <b>there were items that were fit to</b> be sacrificed <b>upon</b> the <b>altar,</b> e.g., <b>wines, oils, and birds,</b> Rabbi Eliezer says: They are sold for the needs of that kind of item, i.e., to individuals who will use them as such.

### Part 3
<b>Phylacteries are called property, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Arakhin</i> 23b): With regard to <b>one who consecrates his property,</b> the value of his <b>phylacteries is assessed for him</b> and he redeems them by paying their value to the Temple treasury. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>a Torah scroll, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered property or not? Does one say that <b>since it is not sold, as it is prohibited to sell</b> a Torah scroll, <b>it is</b> therefore <b>not</b> considered <b>property? Or perhaps</b> one says that <b>since it may be sold</b> in order to enable one <b>to study Torah or to marry a woman, it is</b> considered <b>property.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 4
§ The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for the series of incidents stated below: <b>Zutra, the mother, of Amram, from two sisters, Rav Tovi, and Rav Dimi and Rav Yosef.</b>

### Part 5
<b>The mother of Rav Zutra bar Toviyya wrote</b> a deed granting <b>her property to Rav Zutra bar Toviyya,</b> explaining that she was doing so <b>because she wanted to get married to Rav Zevid,</b> and she did not want him to acquire her property. <b>She married</b> Rav Zevid, <b>and he divorced her. She came before Rav Beivai bar Abaye</b> to claim her property from her son. Rav Beivai <b>said:</b> She transferred her property <b>because</b> she wanted <b>to get married, and she married.</b> Since her intentions were fulfilled, even though she subsequently was divorced, the gift is a valid gift.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to</b> Rav Beivai: Is it <b>because you come from</b> a line of <b>truncated [<i>mula’ei</i>] people,</b> from the house of the High Priest Eli, whose descendants were condemned to premature death (see I Samuel 2:31), that <b>you say truncated [<i>mulyata</i>]</b> and unsound <b>matters? Even according to the one who says</b> that the deed of <b>a woman who shelters</b> her property from her intended husband <b>effects acquisition,</b> and the woman cannot reclaim the property, <b>this matter</b> applies <b>where she did not reveal her intentions</b> in transferring ownership of her property. <b>But here, she revealed her intentions that</b> she transferred the property <b>because</b> she wanted <b>to marry; and she married, but was divorced.</b> Therefore, since she is no longer married, she can reclaim the property.

### Part 7
<b>The mother of Rami bar Ḥama wrote</b> a deed <b>in the evening</b> granting <b>her property to Rami bar Ḥama. In the morning</b> of the following day, <b>she wrote</b> a deed granting her property <b>to</b> his brother, <b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama. Rami bar Ḥama came before Rav Sheshet,</b> who <b>established him</b> as the owner <b>of the property,</b> as the deed transferring the property to him preceded the gift to his brother. <b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama came before Rav Naḥman,</b> who <b>established him</b> as the owner <b>of the property.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Sheshet came before Rav Naḥman</b> and <b>said to him: What is the reason</b> that the <b>Master established Rav Ukva bar Ḥama</b> as the owner of the property? <b>If</b> it is <b>because she retracted</b> her gift, <b>but didn’t she die?</b> Since the gift of a person on his deathbed is considered valid, Rami bar Ḥama already acquired the property in the evening. Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Sheshet: <b>This</b> is what <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed, in <b>any</b> case <b>where he could retract</b> his gift <b>if he were to recover,</b> i.e., if he transferred ownership of all of his property, even if he does not recover, <b>he can retract his gift.</b>

### Part 9
Rav Sheshet responded: <b>Say that Shmuel said</b> that he can retract his gift if he wants to retain the property <b>for himself,</b> but if he wants to retract his gift in order to give it <b>to another, did he</b> also <b>say</b> that he can do so? Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Sheshet: <b>Shmuel explicitly said</b> that he can retract his gift <b>both</b> in order to retain the property <b>for himself and</b> to grant it <b>to another.</b>

### Part 10
<b>The mother of Rav Amram the Pious had a bundle [<i>meloga</i>] of</b> promissory <b>notes. When she was dying, she said: Let</b> these promissory notes <b>be for Amram, my son. His brothers came before Rav Naḥman. They said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>But</b> Rav Amram <b>did not pull</b> the bundle of documents, and since an act of acquisition was not performed he did not acquire them. Rav Naḥman <b>said to them:</b> An act of acquisition was not required, because <b>the statement of a person on his deathbed is considered as written and as</b> though the documents were <b>delivered</b> to the recipient.

### Part 11
<b>The sister of Rav Tovi bar Rav Mattana wrote</b> a deed <b>in the morning</b> granting <b>her property to Rav Tovi bar Rav Mattana. In the evening</b> another brother, <b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Rav Mattana, came</b> and <b>cried to her.</b> Rav Aḥadvoi <b>said to her: Now</b> people <b>will say</b> that you gave your property to Rav Tovi because this <b>Master,</b> Rav Tovi, is <b>a Torah scholar, and</b> that <b>Master,</b> Rav Aḥadvoi, <b>is not a Torah scholar. She wrote</b> a deed granting the property <b>to him.</b> Rav Tovi <b>came before Rav Naḥman.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Tovi: <b>This</b> is what <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed, in <b>any</b> case <b>where he could retract</b> his gift <b>if he were to recover,</b> even if he does not recover, <b>he can retract his gift,</b> and therefore the property belongs to Rav Aḥadvoi.

### Part 12
<b>The sister of Rav Dimi bar Yosef had a tract of</b> land in <b>an orchard. Whenever she was sick</b> and thought that she was dying, <b>she would transfer</b> ownership of the orchard <b>to</b> Rav Dimi,
