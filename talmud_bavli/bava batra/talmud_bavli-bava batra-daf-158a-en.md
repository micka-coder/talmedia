### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>the house collapsed upon</b> a husband <b>and upon his wife,</b> and it is unknown who died first, if the wife did not have any children from her husband, then the following claims arise: <b>The husband’s heirs say:</b> The <b>wife died first</b> and was inherited by her husband, <b>and afterward the husband died,</b> and therefore the husband’s heirs inherit both his and her property. The <b>wife’s heirs say:</b> The <b>husband died first and afterward</b> the <b>wife died,</b> and her heirs inherit the property that she brought with her to the marriage and the payment of her marriage contract.

### Part 2
<b>Beit Shammai say: They divide</b> the property under dispute between them. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The guaranteed <b>property</b> that the wife brought with her to the marriage retains <b>its</b> previous ownership <b>status.</b> The sum of the <b>marriage contract</b> remains <b>in the possession of the husband’s heirs,</b> since the marriage contract is collected from the husband’s property. <b>Property that is brought into and taken out</b> of the marriage <b>with her,</b> i.e., usufruct property that remains in the wife’s possession during her marriage, remains <b>in the possession of the heirs of the</b> woman’s <b>father.</b>
