### Part 1
The mishna concludes: <b>And</b> as a result, the price of the <b>nests stood that day at one-quarter</b> of a silver dinar, as the demand for nests decreased. It is clear in the mishna that the term <i>dinarei</i> indicates a higher value than the term <i>dinarin</i>.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: If it is <b>written</b> in the document <b>above</b> that someone owes one hundred dinars, and below it is written two hundred dinars, or if above it is written two hundred and below one hundred, everything follows the bottom amount. If so, why does one write the information in the upper part of the document at all? It is a safety measure, so that if one letter is erased from the lower part of the document, thereby rendering it illegible, the information can be learned from the upper part of the document. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:4): Information concerning what is written <b>below may be learned from</b> what is written <b>above</b> if the lower text is missing <b>one letter, but not</b> if it is missing <b>two letters.</b> In that case, in the event of a discrepancy between information written above and information written below, the document is not valid.

### Part 3
<b>For example,</b> if the name of one party is written as <b>Ḥanan</b> below and Ḥanani above, it may be derived <b>from</b> the word <b>Ḥanani</b> written above that the party is named Ḥanani. <b>And</b> similarly, if a name is written <b>Anan</b> below, it may be learned <b>from</b> the name <b>Anani</b> written above that the party is named Anani.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>two letters</b> missing, that the <i>baraita</i> teaches <b>that</b> the name written below <b>cannot</b> be corrected from the name written above? The Gemara suggests: It is out of concern that <b>perhaps</b> it will <b>occur</b> by chance that there is <b>a four-letter name, and</b> the omission of two letters <b>would be half of the name,</b> and for this reason the Sages extended this concern to all cases where two letters are missing. The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> the same could be said when <b>one letter</b> is missing <b>as well,</b> as <b>perhaps</b> it will <b>occur</b> by chance that there is <b>a two-letter name, and</b> the omission of one letter <b>would be half of the name.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara explains: <b>Rather, this is the reason</b> that when <b>two letters</b> are missing the name written below cannot be corrected from the name written above: The concern is that <b>perhaps</b> it will <b>occur</b> by chance that there is <b>a three-letter name, and</b> the omission of two letters <b>would be a majority of the name.</b> The Sages applied this concern to all cases where two letters are missing.

### Part 6
The Gemara continues to discuss discrepancies between the information written above and below in a document. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is <b>obvious to me</b> that if a document states <b>above</b> that one owes <b>a <i>sefel</i>,</b> a type of cup, <b>and below</b> it states <b><i>kefel</i>,</b> a type of garment, <b>everything is determined by the</b> information written <b>below.</b> In this case there is not a missing letter at the bottom but an altered letter. Therefore, the information written below is not corrected from the information written above.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma: What</b> if it is stated <b><i>kefel</i> above and <i>sefel</i> below?</b> The difference between the two words is that the former begins with <i>kuf</i>, whereas the latter begins with <i>samekh</i>. The orthographical difference between these two letters is a single stroke that extends downward, as the omission of the extension of this stroke would change <i>kuf</i> into <i>samekh</i>. Rav Pappa’s dilemma is: <b>Are we concerned for</b> the possibility that <b>a fly</b> landed on the stroke of the <i>kuf</i>, removing the ink and changing it into <i>samekh</i>? <b>Or</b> are we <b>not</b> concerned with this possibility? The Gemara comments: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 8
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> document <b>in which it was written</b> that the amount due was <b>six hundred and a dinar,</b> without specifying to which denomination the six hundred amount referred. <b>Rav Sherevya sent</b> this question <b>before Abaye:</b> Does the holder of the document collect <b>six hundred <i>istira</i> and a dinar?</b> <i>Istira</i> is another name for a <i>sela</i>, which equals four dinars. <b>Or</b> is he <b>perhaps</b> entitled to collect only <b>six hundred <i>perutot</i> and a dinar,</b> a <i>peruta</i> being a small fraction of a dinar? Abaye <b>said to him: Remove</b> the possibility of six hundred <b><i>perutot</i>, since</b> people <b>do not write</b> large numbers of <i>perutot</i> <b>in a document, as they</b> instead <b>combine them</b> into larger denominations
