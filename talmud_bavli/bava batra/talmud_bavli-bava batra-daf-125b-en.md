### Part 1
All <b>my property</b> is given <b>to</b> my <b>grandmother, and after she</b> dies, it is given <b>to my heirs,</b> not inherited by her heirs. He then died. <b>He had a married daughter,</b> who <b>died during the lifetime of her husband and during the lifetime of</b> her father’s <b>grandmother. After</b> her father’s <b>grandmother died,</b> her <b>husband came and claimed</b> the inheritance, as his wife was the heir of her father, and he is his wife’s heir.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Huna said:</b> When her father said that his property is given: <b>To my heirs,</b> he meant: <b>And even to the heirs of my heirs.</b> Therefore, since his daughter’s husband is the heir of his heir, he is entitled to the inheritance. <b>And Rav Anan said</b> that he meant: <b>To my heirs, but not to the heirs of my heirs.</b> Therefore, the husband is not entitled to the property.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates: <b>They sent</b> a ruling <b>from there,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Anan, but not due to his reasoning.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Anan that the husband does not inherit</b> the property. <b>But not due to his reasoning, as Rav Anan holds</b> that <b>even if his daughter had a son</b> to inherit from her, <b>he</b> would <b>not inherit</b> the property, as her father bequeathed it only to his heirs, not to the heirs of his heirs. <b>And</b> that <b>is not so, as if his daughter had a son, he</b> would <b>certainly inherit; and this is the reason the husband does not inherit: Because</b> the inheritance <b>is considered</b> property <b>due</b> to the daughter, as she did not own it during her lifetime, <b>and a husband does not take</b> in inheritance property <b>due</b> to his wife <b>as</b> he does the property she <b>possessed.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>By inference, does Rav Huna,</b> who ruled that the husband is entitled to the inheritance, <b>hold</b> that <b>a husband takes</b> in inheritance property <b>due</b> to his wife <b>as</b> he does the property she <b>possessed?</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Elazar says: This matter was introduced by great</b> Sages, namely Rav Huna, <b>and concluded by lesser</b> Sages, i.e., by me. Rabbi Elazar, humbly referring to himself as a lesser Sage, will now explain Rav Huna’s statement. <b>Anyone who says</b> to another upon granting him an inheritance or a gift: <b>After you</b> die it is given to so-and-so, <b>is</b> considered <b>like one who says:</b> It is given to so-and-so <b>from now.</b> The first recipient merely has the right to use the property during his lifetime but did not actually become the owner. Accordingly, the inheritance was owned by the daughter in her lifetime, and the great-grandmother merely had usage rights. Therefore, it is inherited by the husband.

### Part 6
<b>Rabba said: The explanation of the people of the West,</b> that the inheritance is considered property due to the daughter and not property possessed by her, <b>is reasonable, as if the grandmother would have sold it before</b> she died, <b>her sale would have been</b> a valid <b>sale,</b> and the daughter would not have received it at all.

### Part 7
In conclusion, <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>the husband does not take</b> in inheritance property <b>due</b> to his wife <b>as</b> he does the property she <b>possessed; and a firstborn does not take</b> a double portion of property <b>due</b> to his father <b>as</b> he does the property his father <b>possessed; and a firstborn does not take a double</b> portion <b>of</b> payment for <b>a loan, whether</b> the brothers <b>collected land</b> or <b>whether they collected money.</b>
