### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In <b>an ordinary document, its witnesses</b> are to sign <b>inside it,</b> i.e., on the written side of the paper. In a folded and <b>tied</b> document, <b>its witnesses</b> are to sign <b>on the back of it.</b>

### Part 2
With regard to <b>an ordinary</b> document <b>whose witnesses wrote</b> their signatures <b>on the back of it,</b> and <b>a tied</b> document <b>whose witnesses wrote</b> their signatures <b>inside of it, both of these</b> are <b>not valid. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says: A tied</b> document <b>whose witnesses wrote</b> their signatures <b>inside of it</b> is <b>valid, because one can transform it into an ordinary</b> document by untying it. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Everything</b> is <b>in accordance with regional custom.</b>

### Part 3
<b>An ordinary document</b> is rendered valid <b>by</b> its having at least <b>two witnesses, and a tied</b> document is rendered valid <b>by</b> its having at least <b>three</b> witnesses. With regard to <b>an ordinary</b> document <b>in which a single witness wrote</b> his signature, <b>and a tied</b> document <b>in which</b> only <b>two witnesses wrote</b> their signatures, <b>they are both not valid.</b>

### Part 4

What biblical basis is there for the existence of these two types of documents? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: As the verse states: “They shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44). When the verse states: <b>“They shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds,”</b>
