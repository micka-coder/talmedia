### Part 1
Rav Zevid concludes: <b>And this is</b> the case of the <b>storeroom,</b> i.e., the cellar, <b>that the Sages taught in the mishna.</b> It is clear from this <i>baraita</i> both that it contradicts the suggested addition to the previous <i>baraita</i>, and that the mishna concerns a case where one specified which wine cellar he was selling.

### Part 2
<b>Rather,</b> as indicated by the <i>baraita</i>, <b>the mishna also</b> concerns a case where one <b>says to</b> the buyer: I am selling you <b>this</b> particular cellar, and because he specified a particular cellar the buyer accepts upon himself the possibility that up to ten barrels per hundred might be sour.

### Part 3
Having retracted the addition to the first <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara asks: If so, it is <b>difficult</b> to reconcile the first <i>baraita</i>, which rules that if the seller specified that he was selling <b>this</b> cellar, he must provide wine that is all of good quality, with the second <i>baraita</i>, that of Rav Zevid, which rules with regard to the same case, in which the seller specified he was selling <b>this</b> cellar, that the buyer accepts that up to ten barrels per hundred may contain souring wine.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the buyer <b>said to him</b> that he needs the wine <b>for cooking,</b> and therefore he requires good-quality wine, whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the buyer did <b>not say to him</b> that he needs the wine <b>for cooking.</b> The Gemara elaborates: The second <i>baraita</i>, taught by <b>Rav Zevid,</b> is referring to a case where the buyer <b>said</b> that he needs the wine <b>for cooking,</b> whereas the first <b><i>baraita</i></b> is referring to a case where the buyer did <b>not say to him</b> that he requires it <b>for cooking.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara concludes: <b>Therefore,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that if one said that he is selling: <b>A wine cellar, and</b> the buyer <b>said to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking,</b> then the seller is obligated to <b>give him wine that is all</b> of <b>good</b> quality. If one said that he is selling: <b>This</b> particular <b>wine cellar, and</b> the buyer <b>said to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking,</b> then the seller is obligated to <b>give him wine that is all</b> of <b>good</b> quality, but the buyer <b>accepts upon himself ten</b> barrels of <b>souring</b> wine <b>in</b> each <b>hundred</b> barrels purchased. If one said that he is selling: <b>This</b> particular <b>wine cellar,</b> and the buyer <b>did not say to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking,</b> then the seller may <b>give to him</b> the <b>wine</b> that is in his possession, even if it is of a quality <b>that is sold in the shops,</b> i.e., it is beginning to sour.

### Part 6
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one said that he is selling: <b>A wine cellar, and</b> the buyer <b>did not say to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree about this. One says:</b> The buyer <b>must accept</b> ten barrels of souring wine per hundred, <b>and</b> the other <b>one says:</b> The buyer <b>need not accept</b> any barrels of souring wine.

### Part 7
The Gemara explains their reasoning. <b>The one who says</b> that the buyer <b>must accept</b> ten barrels of souring wine per hundred <b>infers</b> this <b>though</b> a precise reading of the <i>baraita</i> <b>of Rav Zevid, as it teaches:</b> If one says: <b>I am selling to you a wine cellar,</b> then he is required to <b>give him wine that is all</b> of <b>good</b> quality. <b>And we interpreted</b> this <i>baraita</i> as referring to a case <b>where</b> the buyer <b>said to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking.</b> The Gemara explains the inference: <b>The</b> only <b>reason</b> that he must provide him with wine that is all of good quality is <b>that</b> the buyer <b>said to him</b> that he needed it <b>for cooking.</b> By inference, where the buyer <b>does not say to him:</b> I need it <b>for cooking,</b> the buyer <b>must accept</b> ten barrels of souring wine per hundred.

### Part 8
<b>And the one who says</b> that the buyer <b>need not accept</b> any barrels of souring wine <b>infers</b> this <b>through</b> a precise reading <b>of</b> the first <b><i>baraita</i>, as it teaches:</b> If one says: <b>I am selling to you a wine cellar,</b> then he is required to <b>give him wine that is all</b> of <b>good</b> quality. <b>And we interpreted</b> this <i>baraita</i> as referring to a case <b>where he did not say to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking,</b> and even so, the buyer need not accept any barrels of souring wine.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then, <b>according to the one who infers</b> his opinion <b>through</b> a precise reading of the <i>baraita</i> <b>of Rav Zevid, the</b> first <b><i>baraita</i></b> poses <b>a difficulty.</b> The Gemara answers that according to his opinion, the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> If one says: I am selling to you a cellar of wine, then he is required to give him wine that is all of good quality. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where</b> the buyer <b>said to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking.</b> By inference, where the buyer <b>did not say to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking,</b> the buyer <b>must accept</b> ten barrels of souring wine per hundred. <b>And</b> if one said that he is selling: <b>This</b> particular <b>wine cellar, and</b> the buyer <b>did not say to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking,</b> then one may <b>give to him</b> the <b>wine</b> that is in his possession, even if it is of a quality <b>that is sold in the shops,</b> i.e., it is beginning to sour.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who infers</b> his opinion <b>through</b> a precise reading of the first <b><i>baraita</i>,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>of Rav Zevid</b> poses <b>a difficulty, as we interpreted it</b> as referring to a case <b>where</b> the buyer <b>said to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking.</b> And this opinion inferred that if the buyer <b>did not say to him:</b> I need it <b>for cooking,</b> then the buyer <b>must accept</b> ten barrels of souring wine per hundred.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>The same is true</b> according to both <i>baraitot</i>, <b>that even where</b> the buyer <b>did not say to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking,</b> the buyer <b>need not accept</b> ten barrels of souring wine. <b>And</b> there is no proof from the fact <b>that we interpreted</b> the <i>baraita</i> as referring to a case <b>where he said to him:</b> I need it <b>for cooking,</b> since we did so only <b>due to the difficulty</b> of the contradiction between the ruling of the first <i>baraita</i> in the case where the seller specified that he was selling <b>this</b> cellar and the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> of Rav Zevid in the same case where the seller specified he was selling <b>this</b> cellar. Due to that difficulty, the entire <i>baraita</i> was interpreted as referring to a case where the buyer said: I need the wine for cooking, despite the fact that in the case where he did not mention a specific cellar it makes no difference whether or not he said so.

### Part 12
§ Apropos wine that is sold in the shops, the Gemara considers additional <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to such wine: <b>Rav Yehuda says: Over wine</b> of the same quality as that <b>which is sold in the shops, one recites the</b> standard <b>blessing</b> for wine: <b>Who creates fruit of the vine.</b> Despite the fact that such wine is not of the highest quality, it is still regarded as wine. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: Over wine that has formed a film</b> as it begins to sour, <b>why do I</b> need to recite the blessing for wine? Since it has begun to sour, it is no longer regarded as wine. Instead, one should recite the generic blessing recited over foods of lower importance: By Whose word all things came to be.

### Part 13
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Yehuda’s opinion. It is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Over bread that has become moldy, and over wine that has formed a film, and over a cooked dish that has spoiled, one recites</b> the blessing: <b>By Whose word all things came to be.</b> Since these foods have partially spoiled, it is inappropriate to recite the specific blessings designated for such foods in their fresh state.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Zevid said: Rav Yehuda concedes</b> that one does not recite the blessing of: Who creates fruit of the vine, <b>on wine made from grape seeds that is sold on the</b> street <b>corners.</b> It is to such significantly inferior wine that the <i>baraita</i> refers. Wine sold in the shops still has the taste and appearance of wine, so one should recite the standard blessing for wine.

### Part 15
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: This</b> is the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> and <b>this</b> is the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda. In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>does the Master hold?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: I know a <i>baraita</i></b> from which it is possible to derive the <i>halakha</i>.
