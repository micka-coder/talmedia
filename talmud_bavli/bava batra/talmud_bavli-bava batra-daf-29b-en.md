### Part 1
<b>And Mar Zutra concedes with regard to peddlers who travel through cities,</b> during which time others might live in their houses, <b>that even though</b> the claimant <b>does not claim</b> that he insists on testimony that there was continuous use, day and night, over three years, <b>we</b> the court <b>claim</b> this <b>for him.</b> Since people know they are traveling salesmen, it is more likely that people lived in their houses without permission and without their knowledge.

### Part 2
With regard to the requirement for continuous day and night use to establish the presumption of ownership, the Gemara comments: <b>And Rav Huna concedes with regard to a store</b> in the town <b>of Meḥoza, which</b> is generally <b>used in the day</b> and <b>is not</b> generally <b>used in the night,</b> that one is not required to use it in the night to establish the presumption of ownership.

### Part 3
With regard to the requirement of continuous use to establish the presumption of ownership, the Gemara relates that <b>Rami bar Ḥama and Rav Ukva bar Ḥama purchased a maidservant together.</b> One <b>Sage made use of her</b> during the <b>first, third, and fifth</b> years, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage made use of her</b> during the <b>second, fourth, and sixth</b> years. <b>One</b> individual <b>who contested</b> their ownership <b>of</b> the maidservant <b>emerged</b> and claimed that he was the owner.

### Part 4
<b>They came before Rava</b> for a judgment. <b>He said to them: What is the reason you acted like this,</b> making use of her in alternate years, <b>so that</b> each of <b>you would not establish</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>concerning each other</b> by making use of her for three consecutive years? <b>Just as</b> this usage does <b>not</b> establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to you,</b> it does <b>not</b> establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to others,</b> i.e., the claimant in this case, <b>as well.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara adds: <b>And we said</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> it <b>was not written</b> in a <b>document</b> that they are partners and are dividing the use, <b>but</b> if it <b>was written</b> in a <b>document,</b> the document generates <b>publicity</b> that they own the maidservant as partners rather than individually, and they can jointly establish the presumption of ownership.

### Part 6
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the requirement for full use of land to establish the presumption of ownership. <b>Rava says:</b> If one worked and <b>profited,</b> for three years, <b>from all of</b> the land <b>except for</b> the <b>area required for sowing a quarter-<i>kav</i> of seed [<i>beit rova</i>],</b> which he did not use, <b>he acquires all</b> of the field based on presumptive ownership <b>except for</b> that <b><i>beit rova</i>.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says: And we said</b> this ruling <b>only where</b> that <i>beit rova</i> <b>is suitable for planting, but</b> if <b>it is not suitable for planting, he acquires it by means of</b> the acquisition of the rest of the <b>land.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye objects to this: If that is so, how could one acquire</b> an area that is only <b>rock</b> by establishing the presump-tion of ownership, as one does not plant rocky land? <b>Rather,</b> the presumption of ownership can be established <b>by standing animals on it or spreading produce on it. Here too, he should be required to stand animals on</b> the <i>beit rova</i> <b>or</b> to <b>spread produce on it.</b> If he did not profit from this small piece of land at all, he has not established the presumption of ownership with regard to it, and acquires only the rest of the field.

### Part 9
§ The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: What do you want,</b> i.e., what are you doing, <b>with this house</b> of mine? The other <b>said to him: I purchased it from you and I</b> worked and <b>profited</b> from <b>it</b> for the <b>years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. The claimant <b>said to him: I was among the distant settlements,</b> and was unaware that you were residing in my house, which is why I did not lodge a protest.

### Part 10
The one residing in the house <b>came before Rav Naḥman</b> for a judgment. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Go clarify your profiting,</b> i.e., prove that you really resided there for three years, and then the case can be judged. <b>Rava said to</b> Rav Naḥman: Is <b>this the</b> correct <b>judgment?</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b> Therefore, the one who is attempting to take the house from the possessor should have to prove that the other did not reside in the house.

### Part 11
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> between this statement <b>of Rava and</b> another statement <b>of Rava, and</b> it <b>raises a contradiction</b> between this statement <b>of Rav Naḥman and</b> another statement <b>of Rav Naḥman. As</b> there was <b>a certain</b> person
