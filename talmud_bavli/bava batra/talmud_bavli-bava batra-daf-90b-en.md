### Part 1
This is problematic: How can <b>a <i>maneh</i></b> consist of sixty shekels? Since each biblical shekel is equivalent to four dinars, if a <i>maneh</i> is equal to sixty shekels, a <i>maneh</i> <b>is two hundred and forty</b> dinars. But a <i>maneh</i> is actually equal to twenty-five shekels, which is one hundred dinars. <b>Rather,</b> one can <b>learn from</b> the verse <b>three</b> matters: <b>Learn from it</b> that the <b>sacred <i>maneh</i> was doubled,</b> so that it equaled fifty dinars, not twenty-five. <b>And</b> furthermore, as Ezekiel stated that the <i>maneh</i> will be sixty dinars, not fifty, <b>learn from it</b> that a community may <b>increase measures, but they may not increase</b> them by <b>more than one-sixth. And learn from it</b> that <b>the one-sixth</b> is calculated <b>from the outside,</b> i.e., it is one-sixth of the final sum, which is one-fifth of the previous sum.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Pappa bar Shmuel instituted</b> a new <b>measure of three <i>kefiza</i>,</b> which is equal to three <i>log</i>. The Sages <b>said to him: But doesn’t Shmuel say</b> that <b>one may not increase the measures</b> by <b>more than one-sixth?</b> You have added one-third, as there already exists a measure of a half-kav, which is the equivalent of two <i>log</i>. Rav Pappa bar Shmuel <b>said to them: I instituted a new measure.</b> He <b>sent</b> the measure <b>to Pumbedita, and they did not accept it; he sent it to</b> the city of <b>Paphunya, and they accepted it and called it the measure</b> of <b>Pappa.</b>

### Part 3
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the ensuing discussions: <b>Hoarders of produce; one may not hoard; and one may not export; and one may not earn</b> a profit; <b>twice</b> from the sale <b>of eggs;</b> they <b>sound the alarm; and one may not leave.</b>

### Part 4
<b>The Sages taught: Hoarders of produce,</b> who drive up prices by causing a shortage of available goods, <b>and usurers, and those</b> sellers <b>who</b> falsely <b>reduce</b> their <b>measures, and those who raise</b> market <b>prices</b> by selling for more than the accepted price, <b>about them the verse states:</b> “You that would swallow the needy and destroy the poor of the land, <b>saying: When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell produce? And the Shabbat, that we may set forth grain? Making the measure small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances of deceit”</b> (Amos 8:4–5). <b>And it is written: “The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob: Surely I will never forget any of their works”</b> (Amos 8:7).

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>Hoarders of produce, such as whom? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Such as Shabbtai, the hoarder of produce,</b> who would buy and hoard large amounts of produce and later sell it at a high price.

### Part 6
The Gemara relates: <b>Shmuel’s father would sell produce during</b> the period of the <b>early</b> market <b>price,</b> when produce is cheap, <b>for the early</b> market <b>price. His son Shmuel</b> acted differently, and <b>would keep the produce and sell it during</b> the period of the <b>late</b> market <b>price,</b> when produce is expensive, <b>for the early</b> market <b>price. They sent</b> a message <b>from there,</b> Eretz Yisrael: The practice <b>of the father is better than</b> that <b>of the son. What is the reason</b> for this? A market <b>price that</b> has been <b>eased</b> and starts out low will remain <b>eased,</b> with little increase over the course of the year. Therefore, one who makes produce available at the beginning of the season, like Shmuel’s father, aids people during the entire year. By contrast, a market price that starts out high, because people are not making their produce available at the market, is not easily lowered.

### Part 7
<b>Rav says: A person may turn his</b> own <b><i>kav</i> into a storeroom,</b> i.e., he may hoard the produce of his own field and sell it only at a later stage, without violating the prohibition of hoarding produce. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not hoard produce</b> of <b>items that contain</b> an element of basic <b>sustenance, such as wines, oils, and flours, but</b> in the case of <b>spices,</b> such as <b>cumin and pepper, it is permitted. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is <b>with regard to one who buys</b> that produce <b>from the market</b> to resell later; <b>but with regard to one who brings in</b> produce <b>from his</b> own field, <b>it is permitted</b> for any type of produce.

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And it is permitted for a person to hoard produce in Eretz Yisrael</b> for these <b>three years: The year preceding the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>and the year that follows the Sabbatical</b> Year, because the land lies fallow during the seventh year, the Sabbatical Year, and the produce of the sixth year must last through these three years, until near the end of the eighth year.

### Part 9
<b>And in years of drought one may not hoard even a <i>kav</i> of carobs, because</b> he thereby <b>brings a curse on</b> market <b>prices,</b> as everyone is fearful of selling and even a small fluctuation in supply can cause a significant rise in prices. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> who was living in Eretz Yisrael, <b>said to his servant Fuga: Go</b> and <b>hoard produce for me</b> for the coming <b>three years: The year preceding the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>and the year that follows the Sabbatical</b> Year.

### Part 10
§ <b>The Sages taught: One may not export produce from Eretz Yisrael</b> if it consists of <b>items that contain</b> an element of basic <b>sustenance, such as wines, oils, and flours,</b> because this causes them to become more expensive in Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira permits</b> export <b>in</b> the case of <b>wine, because</b> this <b>lessens licentiousness</b> in Eretz Yisrael. <b>And just as one may not export</b> these types of produce <b>from Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to outside</b> of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>so</b> too <b>one may not export</b> them <b>from Eretz Yisrael to Syria,</b> as Syria is not considered part of Eretz Yisrael in this context. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permits</b> the export of produce
