<b>he turns it</b> into <b>manure,</b> i.e., the chaff acts like manure, and an excessive amount of manure damages the seeds.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One must distance</b> animal <b>carcasses, and graves, and a tannery [<i>haburseki</i>],</b> a place where hides are processed, <b>fifty cubits from the city. One may establish a tannery only on the east side of the city,</b> because winds usually blow from the west and the foul smells would therefore be blown away from the residential area. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: One may establish</b> a tannery <b>on any side</b> of a city <b>except for the west,</b> as the winds blowing from that direction will bring the odors into the city, <b>and one must distance</b> it <b>fifty cubits</b> from the city. <b>One must distance from vegetables water in which flax is steeped,</b> because this water ruins them; <b>and</b> likewise one must distance <b>leeks from onions, and mustard from bees. And Rabbi Yosei permits</b> one not to do so in the case <b>of mustard.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>what</b> case <b>is Rabbi Akiva speaking?</b> Did he mean that <b>one may establish</b> a tannery <b>on any side</b> of a city, <b>and</b> one may even <b>place</b> the tannery <b>close</b> to the city, <b>except for the west side,</b> where <b>one must establish it at a distance of fifty cubits? Or perhaps</b> he meant that <b>one may establish</b> a tannery <b>on any side and distance it fifty cubits, except for the west side,</b> where one <b>may not establish</b> a tannery <b>at all.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara cites a proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that <b>one may establish</b> a tannery <b>on any side</b> of the city <b>and distance it fifty cubits, except for the west side,</b> where one <b>may not establish</b> a tannery <b>at all, because</b> the western wind is <b>frequent.</b>

### Part 5
§ With regard to the last statement of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: What</b> does <b>frequent</b> mean in this context? <b>If we say</b> it means <b>frequent among the winds,</b> i.e., this wind blows all the time, that is difficult. <b>But doesn’t Rav Ḥanan bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rav says: Four winds blow every day</b> from different directions, <b>and the northern wind</b> blows <b>with each of</b> the other three; <b>as, if this were not so,</b> i.e., if it did not blow, <b>the world would not exist for even one hour,</b> as the northern wind is pleasant and tempers the bitter effects of the other winds. <b>And the southern wind</b> is <b>harsher than all of them, and were it not</b> for the angel named <b><i>Ben Netz</i>,</b> who <b>stops it</b> from blowing even harder, it would <b>destroy the</b> entire <b>world, as it is stated: “Does the hawk [<i>netz</i>] soar by your wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?”</b> (Job 39:26). This indicates that the northern wind is the most constant, not the western wind.

### Part 6
<b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning of <b>frequent?</b> It means <b>frequent with the Divine Presence,</b> i.e., the Divine Presence is found on the western side, and therefore it is inappropriate to set up a tannery there with its foul odors. <b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Come and let us be grateful to our ancestors who revealed</b> to us <b>the place of prayer, as it is written: “And the hosts of heaven bow down to You”</b> (Nehemiah 9:6). Since the celestial bodies move from east to west, they bow in that direction, which indicates that the Divine Presence is in the west.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov objects to this: But perhaps</b> the celestial bodies are <b>like a servant who receives a gift from his master and walks backward</b> while <b>bowing.</b> If so, the Divine Presence is in the east and the celestial bodies are moving backward. The Gemara comments: Indeed, this is <b>difficult,</b> i.e., the verse does not provide a definitive proof.

### Part 8
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Oshaya holds</b> that <b>the Divine Presence</b> is found <b>in every place, as Rabbi Oshaya says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “You are the Lord, even You alone, You have made heaven…</b>You preserve them all alive and the hosts of heaven bow down to You” (Nehemiah 9:6)? This indicates that <b>Your messengers are not like the messengers of flesh and blood. The messengers of flesh and blood return to the place from where they were sent</b> to report on <b>their mission. But Your messengers return</b> and report on <b>their mission from the</b> very same <b>place</b> to <b>which they are sent, as it is stated “Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go out and say to you: Here we are?”</b> (Job 38:35). The verse <b>does not state: They will come and say,</b> i.e., they do not return to their point of departure, <b>but: “They may go out and say,”</b> which <b>teaches that the Divine Presence</b> is found <b>in every place.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yishmael, too, holds</b> that <b>the Divine Presence</b> is <b>in every place, as</b> one of the Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Divine Presence</b> is <b>in every place? As it is stated: “And behold the angel who spoke with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him”</b> (Zechariah 2:7). Although both angels were coming from the Divine Presence, the verse <b>does not state: After him, but: “To meet him,”</b> which <b>teaches that the Divine Presence</b> is <b>in every place,</b> and therefore the angels depart for their missions from every place.

### Part 10
<b>And Rav Sheshet, too, holds</b> that <b>the Divine Presence</b> is <b>in every place, as Rav Sheshet said to his servant: Set me facing any direction</b> to pray <b>except for the east.</b> Rav Sheshet, who was blind, required the assistance of his aide to prepare for prayer. He explained to his servant: <b>And</b> the reason I do not wish to face east is <b>not because it does not contain the Divine Presence, but because the heretics instruct</b> people to pray <b>in that</b> direction.

### Part 11
<b>But Rabbi Abbahu says: The Divine Presence</b> is <b>in the west, as Rabbi Abbahu says: What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>oriyya</i>,</b> which is a name for the west? It means <b>the air of God [<i>avir Yah</i>],</b> i.e., this is the place of the Divine Presence.

### Part 12
The Gemara cites a statement connected to the four winds. <b>Rav Yehuda said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “My doctrine shall drop as the rain,</b> my speech shall distill as the dew; as the small rain upon the tender growth, and as the showers upon the herb” (Deuteronomy 32:2)? “My doctrine shall drop [<i>ya’arof</i> ] as the rain”; <b>this is the western wind, which comes from the back of [<i>me’orpo</i>] the world,</b> as the west is also referred to as the back.

### Part 13
<b>“My speech shall distill [<i>tizzal</i>] as the dew”; this is the northern wind, which</b> brings dry air that reduces the rain and grain and thereby <b>devalues [<i>mazzelet</i>] gold.</b> When grain crops are reduced their price appreciates, and consequently the value of gold decreases. <b>And in addition, it says: “You who lavish [<i>hazzalim</i>] gold out of the bag”</b> (Isaiah 46:6).

### Part 14
<b>“As the small rain [<i>kisirim</i>] upon the tender growth”; this is the eastern wind that rages through [<i>maseret</i>] the entire world like a demon [<i>sa’ir</i>]</b> when it blows strongly. <b>“And as the showers upon the herb”; this is the southern wind, which raises showers and causes herbs to grow.</b>

### Part 15
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The <b>world</b>
