### Part 1
<b>Because if you do not say so,</b> then when he states: <b>“Build houses, and dwell in them, and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them”</b> (Jeremiah 29:5), <b>what</b> halakhic statement <b>was he saying? Rather, he teaches us good advice,</b> and <b>here too he teaches us good advice.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Know</b> that this was mere advice, <b>as it is written: “And put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days”</b> (Jeremiah 32:14). This is obviously good advice to preserve the items properly, and is not a halakhic statement. Therefore, this is not a proof that the presumption of ownership cannot be established in under three years.

### Part 2
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> a different reason: <b>A person</b> who sees another profiting from his field might <b>waive</b> his rights during <b>the first year,</b> and he might <b>waive</b> his rights for <b>two</b> years, but <b>he will not waive</b> his rights for <b>three</b> years. Therefore, if one does not lodge a protest by the end of the third year, it is tantamount to a concession that the land is not his.

### Part 3
<b>Abaye said to him: If that is so, when</b> it becomes clear that <b>the land</b> is in fact owned by another and it <b>is returned</b> to its owner, <b>it should be returned, save for the produce</b> that the possessor consumed during the first two years, as the owner waived his rights to it. <b>Why did Rav Naḥman say: The land is returned and the produce is returned?</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> a different reason: <b>A person is not particular the first year</b> to lodge a protest, and he <b>is not particular</b> for <b>two</b> years, even though he does not waive his rights to the pro-duce. He <b>is particular</b> to lodge a protest when he sees another profiting from his field for <b>three</b> years. Therefore, if one does not lodge a protest by the end of the third year, it is tantamount to a concession that the land is not his.

### Part 5
<b>Abaye said to him: If that is so,</b> for people <b>such as those of the bar Elyashiv household, who are particular even with regard to one who goes on the boundary of their</b> field, <b>here too,</b> will you say <b>that presumptive ownership is</b> established <b>immediately,</b> as soon as one makes use of their property without their lodging a protest? <b>And if you would say</b> that is <b>indeed</b> the <i>halakha</i>, <b>if so, you have subjected your statement to the</b> varying <b>circumstances</b> of each case, as there will be a different length of time needed to establish the presumption of ownership depending on who the prior owner is. This is untenable.

### Part 6
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> a different reason: <b>A person is careful with his document</b> detailing his purchase of land for <b>the first year</b> after the purchase, and he <b>is</b> also <b>careful</b> for <b>two and three</b> years. For <b>more</b> time than that, <b>he is not careful</b> and might discard the document if no one has lodged a protest concerning his possession of the land. Therefore, the Sages ruled that after three years have passed, he can prove his ownership by means of presumptive ownership.

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said to him: If that is so, a protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence should not be</b> a valid <b>protest,</b> and if three years pass with no protest in his presence, presumptive ownership should be established even if there was a protest lodged before other people. This is <b>because</b> the one possessing the land can <b>say to</b> the claimant: <b>If you had protested in my presence, I would have been careful with my document</b> and would not have discarded it.

### Part 8
The Gemara explains that this claim would not be accepted, <b>be-cause</b> the claimant can <b>say to him: Your friend has a friend, and your friend’s friend has a friend,</b> and the assumption is that word of the protest reached you.

### Part 9
§ <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The <b>three years that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> are required to establish the presumption of ownership <b>is</b> referring to <b>when he</b> worked and <b>profited</b> from the field in <b>consecutive</b> years. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Huna <b>teaching us</b> with this statement? <b>We learned</b> this in the mishna: <b>Their presumption</b> of ownership is established by use for a duration of <b>three years from day to day.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that the phrase: <b>From day to day,</b> serves <b>to exclude partial</b> years and to teach that each of the three years must be full, <b>and actually even scattered,</b> i.e., non-consecutive, years are sufficient, therefore, Rav Huna <b>teaches us</b> that the years must be consecutive.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Ḥama says: And Rav Huna concedes with regard to locations where</b> they leave <b>fields [<i>bagei</i>]</b> to <b>lie fallow</b> by planting in alternate years, that the three years combine despite not being consecutive, as that is the manner in which owners profit from the land.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this with regard to locations <b>where there are</b> some people <b>who leave</b> the fields to <b>lie fallow and there are</b> some people <b>who do not leave</b> the fields to <b>lie fallow, and this man left</b> the field to <b>lie fallow. Lest you say</b> that the claimant can <b>say to him: If it is so that</b> the land <b>is yours, you should have sown it,</b> therefore, Rav Ḥama <b>teaches us that</b> the possessor <b>can say to</b> the claimant: <b>I am not able to</b> hire someone to <b>guard one</b> parcel of <b>land within an entire field,</b> and I acted like those who own other land in this location and let the field lie fallow.

### Part 12
<b>And alternatively,</b> the possessor can say to the claimant: <b>In this</b> manner of farming it is <b>beneficial for me</b> to farm, <b>because</b> the land <b>produces more</b> later, and I do not wish to plant year after year and weaken the soil.

### Part 13
The Gemara clarifies Rav Huna’s statement that the presumption of ownership can be established only by consecutive use. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna about the <b>presumptive ownership of houses. But</b> with regard to the use of <b>houses, where</b> the witnesses attesting to its use <b>know</b> who uses the house only <b>in the day,</b> but <b>they do not know</b> who uses the house <b>in the night,</b> how then can one establish the presumption of ownership in the case of a house? The possessor’s use is not consecutive, as it is continually interrupted by the nights.

### Part 14
<b>Abaye said: Who testifies about houses? Neighbors,</b> and <b>neighbors know</b> who is inside <b>in the day and in the night.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rava said</b> that there is another scenario in which one can bring witnesses with regard to the use of a house. This is <b>such as when two</b> people <b>come and say: We rented</b> the house <b>from him and we lived in it for three years, in the day and in the night.</b> This testimony substantiates that the house was used under the authority of the one who is attempting to prove that he has established the presumption of ownership.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi:</b> How can their testimony be relied upon? <b>These</b> witnesses <b>are biased in their testimony, because if they do not say this</b> testimony, that they rented the house from the possessor for three consecutive years, <b>we say to them: Go</b> and <b>give payment for</b> the rental of <b>the house to that</b> one who is claiming ownership, as the one you paid has not established that he is the true owner.

### Part 17
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Low</b>-level <b>judges rule this way.</b> In other words, only a court composed of ignorant judges would accept the testimony of the renters of the house in a case where they are biased in their testimony. Nevertheless, Rava’s scenario is still possible, as, <b>are we not dealing with</b> a case <b>where they are holding</b> the money for the <b>payment for</b> the rental of <b>the house, and they are saying</b> to the court: <b>To whom shall we give it?</b> Therefore, they are not biased in their testimony, because they will pay the same amount, regardless of who the actual owner is.

### Part 18
The Gemara quotes a related statement. <b>Mar Zutra said: And if</b> the claimant <b>claims and says: Let two witnesses come to testify for</b> the possessor <b>that he lived in</b> the house <b>three years in the day and in the night, his claim is</b> a legitimate <b>claim.</b>
