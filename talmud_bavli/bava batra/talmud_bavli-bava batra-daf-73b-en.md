<b>on the two bridges of</b> the river <b>Rognag, and he jumped from this one to that one, and from that one to this one. And he was holding two cups of wine in his hands and was pouring from this one to that one, and from that one to this one, and not</b> one <b>drop fell to the ground. And that day was</b> stormy, similar to the description in a verse dealing with seafarers: <b>“They mounted up to the heavens, they went down to the deeps;</b> their soul melted away because of trouble” (Psalms 107:26). He continued in this manner <b>until</b> word of his behavior <b>was heard in the house of the king, and they killed him.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabba said: I have seen a day-old antelope [<i>urzila</i>] that was</b> as large <b>as Mount Tabor. And how</b> large <b>is Mount Tabor?</b> It is <b>four parasangs. And the length of its neck</b> was <b>three parasangs, and the place where his head rests</b> was <b>a parasang and a half. It cast feces [<i>kufta</i>] and</b> thereby <b>dammed up the Jordan.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: I have seen a certain frog [<i>akrokta</i>] that was</b> as large <b>as the fort [<i>akra</i>] of Hagronya. And how</b> large <b>is the fort of Hagronya?</b> It is as large as <b>sixty houses. A snake came and swallowed</b> the frog. <b>A raven came and swallowed the snake, and</b> flew <b>up and sat in a tree. Come</b> and <b>see how great is the strength of the tree,</b> which could bear the weight of that raven. <b>Rav Pappa bar Shmuel said: If I had not been there</b> and seen this, <b>I would not believe</b> it.

### Part 4
§ <b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling in a ship and we saw a certain fish in</b> whose <b>nostril [<i>be’usyeih</i>] a mud eater [<i>akhla tina</i>],</b> i.e., a type of insect, <b>had sat</b> and killed him. <b>And the waters thrust</b> the fish <b>and threw it upon the shore. And sixty districts were destroyed by</b> the fish, <b>and sixty districts ate from it, and</b> another <b>sixty districts salted its</b> meat to preserve it. <b>And they filled from one of its eyeballs three hundred flasks of oil. And when we returned</b> there <b>after</b> the <b>twelve months</b> of <b>the year</b> had passed, <b>we saw that they were cutting beams from its bones, and they had set out to build those districts</b> that had been destroyed.

### Part 5
<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling on a ship and we saw a certain fish upon which sand had settled, and grass grew on it. We assumed</b> that <b>it was dry land and went up and baked and cooked on the back</b> of the fish, <b>but when its back</b> grew <b>hot it turned over. And were it not for</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <b>ship was close</b> by, <b>we would have drowned.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling in a ship and the ship traveled between</b> one <b>fin [<i>shitza</i>] and</b> the other <b>fin of a fish</b> for <b>three days and three nights.</b> The fish was swimming in the opposite direction of the ship, so that <b>it</b> was swimming <b>upward</b> against the wind and the waves, <b>and we were</b> sailing <b>downward. And if you would say</b> that <b>the ship did not travel very fast, when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said:</b> In the short amount of time required to <b>heat a kettle of water,</b> that ship can <b>travel sixty parasangs. And</b> another demonstration of its speed is that <b>a horseman shot an arrow, and</b> yet the ship was traveling so swiftly that it <b>outraced it. And Rav Ashi said: That</b> fish <b>was a sea <i>gildana</i>, which has two</b> sets of <b>fins.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling in a ship and we saw a certain bird that was standing with water up to its ankles [<i>kartzuleih</i>] and its head</b> was <b>in the sky. And we said</b> to ourselves that <b>there is no</b> deep <b>water</b> here, <b>and we wanted to go down to cool ourselves off. And a Divine Voice emerged and said to us: Do not go down here, as the ax of a carpenter fell</b> into it <b>seven years</b> ago <b>and</b> it has still <b>not reached the bottom. And</b> this is <b>not because the water is so large</b> and deep. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>because the water is turbulent. Rav Ashi said: And that</b> bird <b>is</b> called <b><i>ziz sadai</i>,</b> wild beast, <b>as it is written:</b> “I know all the fowls of the mountains; <b>and the <i>ziz sadai</i> is Mine”</b> (Psalms 50:11).

### Part 8
<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling in the desert and we saw these geese whose wings were sloping because they were so fat, and streams of oil flowed beneath them. I said to them: Shall we have a portion of you in the World-to-Come? One raised a wing, and one raised a leg,</b> signaling an affirmative response. <b>When I came before Rabbi Elazar, he said to me: The Jewish people will</b> eventually <b>be held accountable for</b> the suffering <b>of</b> the geese. Since the Jews do not repent, the geese are forced to continue to grow fat as they wait to be given to the Jewish people as a reward.

### Part 9
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the items shown by an Arab man to Rabba bar bar Ḥana in the following stories: <b>Like the dust of the sky-blue; the scorpion stung the basket.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling in the desert and we were accompanied by a certain Arab who would take dust and smell it and say: This is the road to such and such a place, and that is the road to such and such a place. We said to him: How far are we from water? And he said to us: Bring me dust. We brought</b> it <b>to him, and he said: Eight parasangs.</b> Later, we said this <b>a second time, and gave him</b> dust, and <b>he said to us that we are at a distance of three parasangs. I switched</b> the type of dust to test him, <b>but I could not</b> confuse <b>him,</b> as he was an expert in this matter.

### Part 11
That Arab <b>said to me: Come, I will show you the dead of the wilderness,</b> i.e., the Jewish people who left Egypt and died in the wilderness. <b>I went</b> and <b>saw them; and they had the appearance of one who is intoxicated,</b>
