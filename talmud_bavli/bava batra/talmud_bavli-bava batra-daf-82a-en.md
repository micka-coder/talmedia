### Part 1
The passage is not recited <b>until the taking and the bringing</b> of the first fruits are performed <b>by one</b> person, <b>and that is not</b> the case here. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: Since</b> the passage <b>is</b> composed of <b>verses, let him read them.</b> What is objectionable about reciting verses from the Torah?

### Part 2
Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> The problem is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> this practice <b>has the appearance of falsehood,</b> because he issues a declaration before God that is possibly untrue, as he might not own the ground. <b>Rav Mesharshiyya, son of Rav Ḥiyya, said:</b> The declaration is not recited <b>lest he come to remove</b> the fruits <b>from</b> their obligation of <b><i>teruma</i> and tithes,</b> if they are treated entirely as first fruits. For this reason one does not recite the passage, to ensure that their unique status is maintained.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to one who buys two trees in the field of another, if the trees <b>grew,</b> the owner of the field <b>may not cut down</b> their branches. The mishna further teaches: That which grows out of the trunk belongs to the owner of the tree, but that which grows out of the roots belongs to the owner of the ground. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which something is considered to be growing <b>out of the trunk, and what are the circumstances</b> in which it is considered to be growing <b>out of the roots?</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>anything that sees the face of the sun,</b> i.e., which is visible and aboveground, <b>this is</b> considered to be growing <b>out of the trunk. And</b> with regard to that <b>which does not see the face of the sun</b> but is concealed in the earth, <b>this is</b> considered to be growing <b>out of the roots.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if everything that is visible belongs to the owner of the tree, no matter how close it is to the ground, <b>let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps the land is covered with sediment</b> from flowing water, and some of the tree’s trunk will be covered, in which case the branches that grow from the trunk will appear as though they are separate trees; <b>and</b> the owner of the trees will <b>say to</b> the owner of the field: <b>You</b> actually <b>sold me three</b> trees <b>and I</b> therefore <b>have</b> ownership over the <b>ground. Rather, Rav Naḥman said:</b> That which grows from the trunk belongs to the owner of the tree, but <b>he must cut</b> it down. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> himself <b>likewise said:</b> The owner of the tree <b>must cut</b> it down.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Naḥman said: We hold</b> by tradition that <b>a palm tree</b> bought from another <b>has no trunk. Rav Zevid thought to say</b> this means that <b>the owner of the palm tree has no</b> right to that which grows from the <b>trunk.</b> The reason is <b>that since it stands</b> ready <b>to be dug up and uprooted,</b> as when the tree dies its owner is not entitled to plant another in its place, <b>he diverts his mind</b> from that which grows from the trunk.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this: But</b> this is comparable to one who <b>buys two trees</b> in a field belonging to another, <b>as</b> the trees <b>stand</b> ready <b>to be dug up and uprooted</b> because their owner has no right to plant new trees in their place when they die; <b>and</b> yet it <b>is taught</b> in the mishna <b>that he has</b> the right to that which grows from the <b>trunk. Rather, Rav Pappa said:</b> The statement of Rav Naḥman means that <b>the owner of a palm tree,</b> in contrast to owners of other types of trees, <b>has no</b> right to that which grows from the <b>trunk, since</b> a palm tree <b>does not produce</b> branches from its <b>trunk.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Zevid,</b> who maintains that Rav Naḥman is referring to all types of trees, <b>the mishna</b> is <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara answers: Rav Zevid interprets the mishna as referring to a situation <b>where</b> the owner of the trees <b>bought</b> the trees <b>for five years</b> and stipulated that he may plant new trees in place of the original trees in the event the original ones are cut down.

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>one bought three</b> trees <b>he has acquired</b> the <b>ground</b> along with them. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> of the field does he acquire? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This</b> buyer <b>has acquired</b> the ground that is located <b>underneath</b> the trees, <b>and</b> the area <b>between them, and</b> with regard to the space <b>outside of</b> the trees and their branches,
