### Part 1
<b>But</b> that <b>is not so, as Rav Yeimar bar Shelemya said:</b> The matter <b>was explained to me by Abaye,</b> as follows: <b>Whether</b> the seller writes with regard to the fourth boundary: <b>The boundary</b> of the field is <b>the land through which</b> the field <b>is halved, or</b> he writes: <b>The boundary</b> of the field is <b>the land through which</b> a plot <b>can be set apart, if he said to</b> the buyer: <b>These are its boundaries,</b> he has sold him <b>half</b> of the field. But if <b>he did not say to</b> the buyer: <b>These are its boundaries,</b> he has sold him only an area fit for sowing <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara raises a question about a similar case: <b>It</b> is <b>obvious</b> that if one <b>said: So-and-so should share in my property,</b> he means to give him <b>half</b> of the property. If he said: <b>Give so-and-so a portion of my property, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? What portion of the property must he give him?

### Part 3
<b>Ravina bar Kisi said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof concerning the <i>halakha</i> in this case, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says: Give so-and-so a portion of</b> my <b>cistern</b> for his water needs, <b>Sumakhos says:</b> He must give him <b>not less than one-quarter</b> of the water in the cistern. If he qualifies his words and says: Give so-and-so a portion of my cistern’s water <b>for</b> his <b>barrel,</b> he must give him <b>not less than one-eighth</b> of the water. If he says: Give him a portion <b>for</b> his <b>pot,</b> he must give him <b>not less than one-twelfth</b> of the water. And if he says: Give him <b>for</b> his <b>cup,</b> he must give him <b>not less than one-sixteenth</b> of the water. In any event, this <i>baraita</i> indicates that the unqualified phrase: Give so-and-so a portion, should be understood to mean: Give him one-quarter.

### Part 4
The Gemara now considers another case in which the seller withholds something for himself in a sale. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a Levite who sold a field to an Israelite and said to him:</b> I am selling you this field <b>on the condition that the first tithe</b> from the produce growing in the field, which must be given to a Levite, is <b>mine,</b> and it will be given to me every year and not to any other Levite, <b>the first tithe is his. And if he said:</b> I am selling you the field on the condition that the tithe will be given <b>to me and to my sons,</b> then if <b>he dies,</b> the buyer <b>must give</b> the tithe <b>to his sons.</b>

### Part 5
<b>But if</b> the seller <b>said to</b> the buyer: This stipulation will remain in force <b>as long as this field is in your possession,</b> then if the buyer <b>sold it and</b> afterward <b>bought it</b> back <b>again,</b> the seller <b>has no</b> claim <b>on him.</b> Since the field left the buyer’s possession in the interim, the seller no longer has a claim to the tithe.

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges the <i>halakha</i> taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why</b> should the seller ever have a right to the tithe after he has sold the field? After all, <b>a person cannot transfer ownership</b> of <b>an object that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world.</b> How, then, can the seller acquire a portion of the produce that does not yet exist? The Gemara answers that <b>since</b> the seller <b>said to</b> the buyer: I am selling you this field <b>on the condition that the first tithe</b> is <b>mine,</b> it is as if <b>he withheld the site</b> where the <b>tithe</b> is grown for himself when he sold the field, and that site already exists.

### Part 7
<b>Reish Lakish said: That is to say</b> that with regard to one <b>who sells a house to another and says to him:</b> I am selling you this house <b>on the condition that the upper story [<i>deyota</i>] is mine, the upper story is his.</b>
