### Part 1
<b>A person’s vessels effect acquisition</b> of any item placed inside them <b>for him, in any place</b> in which they are situated, <b>except for the public domain. And Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish both say: Even in the public domain,</b> one’s vessels effect acquisition of items placed in them.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> These <i>amora’im</i> <b>do not disagree: Here,</b> when Rav and Shmuel state that one’s vessel does not effect acquisition for him, they are speaking of a vessel placed <b>in the public domain; there,</b> when Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish state that his vessel effects acquisition on his behalf, they are referring to a vessel located <b>in an alleyway. And why do they call</b> an alleyway <b>the public domain?</b> The reason is <b>that</b> an alleyway is <b>not a private domain.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara points out: <b>So, too, it is reasonable</b> to interpret Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement in this manner, <b>as Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A person’s vessels effect acquisition for him in any place where he has permission to keep them.</b> It can be inferred from here: In a location where <b>he has permission</b> to keep them, <b>yes,</b> his vessels effect acquisition for him. But in a place where <b>he does not have permission</b> to keep his vessels, they do <b>not</b> effect acquisition for him, and one has permission to keep his vessels in an alleyway but not in the public domain. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> this statement that when Rabbi Yoḥanan referred to the public domain he meant an alleyway.

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a difficulty from a <i>baraita</i>: There are <b>four cases with regard to sellers,</b> i.e., four methods through which merchandise is acquired. When the seller measures merchandise for the buyer, <b>before the measuring</b> vessel <b>has been filled</b> the merchandise in the vessel still belongs <b>to the seller</b> and he can change his mind and cancel the sale. <b>Once the measuring</b> vessel <b>has been filled</b> the merchandise belongs <b>to the buyer. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said when the seller measures <b>with a measuring</b> vessel <b>that does not belong to either of them. But if the measuring</b> vessel <b>belonged to one of them,</b> the buyer <b>acquires</b> the items of sale <b>one</b> by <b>one</b> as they are placed in the measuring vessel.

### Part 5
<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said when the seller measures the items <b>in the public domain or in a courtyard that does not belong to either of them. But</b> if it happens <b>in the domain of</b> the <b>seller,</b> the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> the merchandise <b>until he lifts</b> the measuring vessel <b>or until he moves it out of the domain</b> of the seller. If it is <b>in the domain of</b> the <b>buyer, once</b> the <b>seller accepts upon himself</b> to sell, the <b>buyer acquires</b> it. If the merchandise is located <b>in the domain of this</b> individual <b>with whom it had been deposited,</b> the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> it <b>until</b> the bailee <b>accepts upon himself</b> to designate a place where the merchandise is to be stored for the buyer, <b>or until</b> the buyer <b>rents</b> from the bailee <b>the place</b> where the merchandise is situated.

### Part 6
<b>In any event,</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches with regard to</b> a transaction in <b>the public domain or in a courtyard that does not belong to either of them</b> that if the measuring vessel belonged to one of them, the buyer acquires the items of sale one by one as they are placed in the vessel.
