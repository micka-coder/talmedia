### Part 1
<b>As Rava says: A person may squeeze</b> the juice from <b>a cluster of grapes and</b> then <b>recite the sanctification of the</b> Shabbat <b>day over it.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rather,</b> Rav’s statement is <b>to exclude</b> wine that is taken <b>from</b> the <b>mouth of</b> the barrel, which has scum floating in it, <b>and</b> wine taken <b>from</b> the <b>bottom of</b> the barrel, which contains the pomace. The Gemara challenges this: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach: One may not bring</b> wine that is taken <b>from</b> the <b>mouth of</b> the barrel <b>or from</b> the <b>bottom of</b> the barrel as a libation <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but if one brought</b> it as a libation <b>it is valid</b> after the fact? Accordingly, it should be fit for use for the sanctification of the Shabbat day.

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> Rav’s statement is <b>to exclude black wine, <i>borek</i></b> wine, <b>sweet wine [<i>heiliston</i>],</b> wine <b>from</b> the <b>cellar,</b> and wine made <b>from raisins.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to all of</b> these types of wine, <b>one may not bring</b> them as a libation <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but if one brought</b> one of them as a libation <b>it is valid</b> after the fact. Accordingly, it should be fit for use for the sanctification of the Shabbat day.

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> Rav’s statement serves <b>to exclude souring wine, diluted</b> wine, wine that has been left <b>uncovered,</b> as there is a concern that a snake may have injected its venom into it, <b>and</b> wine made <b>from</b> grape <b>pomace, and</b> wine that has a <b>foul odor. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to all of</b> these types of wine, <b>one may not bring</b> them as a libation, <b>and if one brought</b> one of them as a libation, <b>it is disqualified.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks again: Rav’s statement serves <b>to exclude which</b> of these types of wine? <b>If</b> one suggests Rav intended <b>to exclude souring</b> wine, that cannot be, as the status of wine that tastes like wine but has the odor of vinegar <b>is the</b> subject of a <b>dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> (96a).

### Part 6
<b>If</b> one suggests that Rav’s statement serves <b>to exclude diluted</b> wine, why would such wine be disqualified for the sanctification of the Shabbat day? Diluting wine <b>is an improvement of it, as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> Even though the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer and hold that over undiluted wine one recites the blessing: Who created the fruit of the vine, nevertheless the <b>Rabbis concede to Rabbi Eliezer with regard to a cup</b> used <b>for a blessing,</b> such as the cup of wine over which Grace after Meals is recited, <b>that one does not recite</b> the <b>blessing over it until he adds water to it</b> to make it palatable.

### Part 7
<b>If</b> one suggests that Rav’s statement serves <b>to exclude</b> wine that has been left <b>uncovered,</b> it would be unnecessary for Rav to teach this, because such wine, which <b>is dangerous</b> to drink, as a snake may have injected its venom into it, is already forbidden.

### Part 8
<b>If</b> one suggests that Rav’s statement serves <b>to exclude</b> wine made <b>from pomace, what are the circumstances? If</b> it is referring to a case <b>where one poured three</b> jugs of water over the pomace <b>and</b> the volume of the resulting beverage <b>came to four</b> jugs, that <b>is</b> considered <b>full-fledged wine,</b> which may certainly be used for the sanctification of the Shabbat day. <b>If</b> it is referring to <b>where one poured three</b> jugs of water over the pomace, <b>and</b> the resulting beverage <b>came to three and a half</b> jugs, this <b>is the</b> subject of a <b>dispute</b> between <b>the Rabbis and <i>Aḥerim</i>,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, who rule that it is not regarded as wine.

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> Rav’s statement serves <b>to exclude</b> wine <b>that</b> has <b>a foul odor. And if you wish, say</b> that <b>actually</b> his statement serves <b>to exclude</b> wine that has been left <b>uncovered, and</b> it teaches the novelty that <b>even though one passes it through a sieve, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya</b> (see <i>Terumot</i> 8:7), <b>nevertheless,</b> it still may not be used for the sanctification of the Shabbat day. This is because it is disrespectful to use inferior wine for a mitzva, as derived from the verse in which God rebukes the Jewish people for offering lame animals as offerings: <b>“Present it now unto your governor; will he be pleased with you or will he accept your person?</b> says the Lord of hosts” (Malachi 1:8).

### Part 10
<b>Rav Kahana, father-in-law of Rav Mesharshiyya, asked Rava:</b> With regard to using <b>white wine</b> for libations and for the sanctification of the Shabbat day, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>He said to him</b> in response that the verse states: <b>“Do not look upon the wine when it is red,</b> when it gives its color in the cup, when it glides down smoothly” (Proverbs 23:31), which indicates that red wine is considered to be of a superior quality.

### Part 11
§ The mishna teaches: When purchasing <b>jugs</b> of wine <b>in the Sharon</b> region, he accepts upon himself that up to ten inferior-quality jugs may be present in each hundred jugs purchased. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The buyer must accept ten inferior-quality jugs in one hundred only when even those ten <b>inferior-quality jugs</b> are <b>beautiful and sealed with pitch</b> to strengthen them.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>sells wine to another and</b> then <b>it sours,</b> the seller <b>does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for its</b> loss. <b>But if it is known</b> of this seller <b>that his wine</b> always <b>sours, then this</b> sale <b>is a mistaken transaction,</b> i.e., one based upon false assumptions, as the buyer intended to purchase wine that would maintain its quality; therefore, the seller must reimburse the buyer. <b>And if</b> the seller <b>said to</b> the buyer: It is <b>wine</b>
