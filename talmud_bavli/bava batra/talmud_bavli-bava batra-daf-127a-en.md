### Part 1
<b>Ameimar says:</b> A <i>tumtum</i> who was found to be male <b>also does not reduce the</b> additional <b>portion of the firstborn.</b> His portion is not taken into account in the calculation of the firstborn’s additional portion. For example, if there are three brothers: A firstborn, an ordinary brother, and a <i>tumtum</i>, the firstborn receives one-third of the property as his additional portion, as he would if he and the ordinary brother were the only heirs, and the remaining two-thirds are divided among all three brothers. This is <b>because it is stated</b> with regard to the portion of the firstborn: <b>“And they have borne him sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:15), which is interpreted to mean that the brother of a firstborn does not affect his additional portion <b>unless he is</b> recognized as <b>a son at the moment of</b> his <b>birth.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav Sheizevi says:</b> A <i>tumtum</i> who was found to be male <b>is also not circumcised on</b> the <b>eighth</b> day, if his eighth day occurs on Shabbat, although the mitzva of circumcision on the eighth day generally overrides Shabbat prohibtions. <b>As the verse states: “If a woman bears seed and gives birth to a male</b> then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean. <b>And on the eighth day</b> the flesh of his foreskin <b>shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:2–3), which is interpreted to mean that he is not circumcised on the eighth day, in the event that it occurs on Shabbat, <b>unless he is</b> recognized as <b>a male from the moment of</b> his <b>birth.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Sherevya says: His mother is also not</b> rendered <b>ritually impure</b> due to his <b>birth, as the verse states: “If a woman bears seed and gives birth to a male, then she shall be unclean seven days,”</b> which is interpreted to mean that she is not rendered impure <b>unless he is</b> recognized as <b>a male from the moment of</b> his <b>birth.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 28a): A woman <b>who miscarries a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite [<i>ve’androginos</i>] observes</b> the strictures of a woman who gave birth <b>to a male and to a female.</b> Since it is uncertain whether the fetus is male or female, the woman must observe the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity according to both possibilities. This appears to be <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the statement <b>of Rav Sherevya</b> that a woman who gives birth to a <i>tumtum</i> is not rendered impure at all. The Gemara affirms: This is <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say it is</b> also <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the statement <b>of Rav Sheizevi</b> with regard to circumcision, as the <i>halakha</i> of circumsicion is stated together with the <i>halakha</i> of ritual impurity?

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna in tractate <i>Nidda</i> <b>is uncertain</b> whether the birth discussed in the verse includes that of a <i>tumtum</i>, <b>and</b> therefore he rules <b>stringently,</b> that she should observe the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity for both possibilities. Rav Sheizevi’s ruling can follow the same logic: The infant should not be circumcised on Shabbat, as it is uncertain whether the mitzva of his circumcision overrides the prohibitions of Shabbat.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna in tractate <i>Nidda</i> is uncertain whether the birth discussed in the verse includes that of a <i>tumtum</i>, the mishna <b>should have</b> stated that the woman <b>observes</b> the strictures of a woman who gave birth <b>to</b> both <b>a male and to a female, and</b> also <b>as a menstruating woman.</b> If it is uncertain whether the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity after birth pertain to a woman who gives birth to a <i>tumtum</i> at all, she should observe the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity for any blood that emerges in the time period following the birth, as it should have the status of the blood of a menstruating woman. The Gemara concludes: This poses <b>a difficulty.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rava says</b> that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ami</b> that a <i>tumtum</i> firstborn does not receive a double portion of the inheritance. The <i>baraita</i> states: From the phrase “the firstborn son” (Deuteronomy 21:15) it is derived that only <b>a son</b> receives a double portion, <b>but not a <i>tumtum</i>,</b> and only a definite <b>firstborn</b> receives a double portion, <b>but not</b> one about whom it is <b>uncertain</b> if he is a firstborn.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a son</b> receives a double portion <b>but a <i>tumtum</i></b> does <b>not</b> is understandable, as it <b>is in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ami, but what</b> case <b>does</b> the <i>halakha</i> that only a definite <b>firstborn</b> receives a double portion <b>but not</b> one about whom it is <b>uncertain</b> if he is a firstborn serve <b>to exclude?</b> Why would one about whom it is uncertain if he is a firstborn receive a double portion?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to exclude that which Rava taught, as Rava taught</b> that if <b>two wives</b> of the same husband <b>gave birth to two males in hiding,</b> so that it is unknown which son was born first, and the husband subsequently had other sons, <b>each</b> of the two possible firstborns <b>writes an authorization to the other.</b> Since their brothers can claim against each of them individually that he is not the firstborn and does not deserve a double portion, each writes the other an authorization to collect his portion, so that they can jointly claim the additional portion in any event.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Pappa</b> subsequently <b>said to Rava: But didn’t Ravin send</b> a letter from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, stating: <b>I asked all my teachers</b> about <b>this matter and they did not tell me anything; but this</b> is what <b>they said in the name of Rabbi Yannai:</b> If the two sons <b>were</b> initially <b>recognized,</b> i.e., it was known which one of them was the firstborn, <b>and</b> they <b>were ultimately mixed,</b> and now the firstborn cannot be identified, <b>each writes an authorization to the other.</b> If <b>they were not</b> initially <b>recognized, each does not write an authorization to the other.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rava then established an <i>amora</i></b> to repeat his lesson to the masses aloud <b>and taught: The statements that I said to you are a mistake on my</b> part. <b>But this</b> is what <b>they said in the name of Rabbi Yannai:</b> If the two sons <b>were</b> initially <b>recognized and were ultimately mixed, each writes an authorization to the other.</b> If <b>they were not</b> initially <b>recognized, each does not write an authorization to the other.</b>

### Part 13
§ <b>The residents of Akra De’Agma sent</b> the following inquiry <b>to Shmuel: Teach us, our master:</b> If the court <b>had a presumption concerning this</b> son, <b>that he is a firstborn, and his father says concerning another</b> son of his: <b>He is</b> his <b>firstborn, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Shmuel <b>sent to them</b> in response: Both of these sons <b>write an authorization,</b>
