<b>and a public road</b> that is at least sixteen cubits wide; <b>and a private road</b> that is four cubits wide; <b>and a public trail; and a permanent private trail</b> that is used <b>whether in the summer or in the rainy season,</b> i.e., winter. Rav Asi and Ravin disagree with regard to whether Rabbi Yoḥanan held that a boundary or sea squill also serves to subdivide a field for the purpose of <i>pe’a</i>.

### Part 2
The Gemara further clarifies: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>ritual impurity</b> that is affected by determining whether an area is one or two fields? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 6:5): With regard to <b>one who enters into a valley during the rainy season,</b> i.e., winter, when people generally do not enter this area, and therefore for the purpose of this <i>halakha</i> it is considered a private domain, and there is a principle that in a case of uncertainty concerning whether one contracted ritual impurity in a private domain he is ritually impure; <b>and</b> there was <b>ritual impurity in such and such a field, and</b> he <b>said:</b> I know <b>I walked to that place,</b> i.e., I walked in the valley, <b>but I do not know whether I entered that place</b> where the ritual impurity was <b>or whether I did not</b> enter, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems him pure and the Rabbis deem him impure.</b>

### Part 3
Rabbi Eliezer deems him pure, <b>as Rabbi Eliezer would say:</b> Concerning <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>entry,</b> i.e., it is uncertain whether he entered the area where the ritual impurity is located, he is <b>ritually pure.</b> But if he certainly entered the area where the ritual impurity is located and the <b>uncertainty</b> is with regard to <b>contact</b> with <b>ritual impurity,</b> he is <b>ritually impure.</b> It is with regard to this <i>halakha</i> that Ravin said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan that a boundary or sea squill defines these fields as distinct areas.

### Part 4
The Gemara infers, though, that even Ravin holds that a boundary or sea squill serves as a barrier only with regard to <i>pe’a</i> and ritual impurity, <b>but with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat,</b> they do <b>not</b> serve as a barrier between fields.

### Part 5
<b>Rava says:</b> They serve as a barrier between fields <b>even with regard to the matter of Shabbat, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who <b>carried out half</b> of <b>a dried fig</b> from a private domain <b>into the public domain and placed it</b> there, <b>and</b> then <b>returned and carried out another half</b> of <b>a dried fig,</b> if it was done <b>within one lapse of awareness,</b> i.e., he did not remember in the interim that this act is prohibited or that it was Shabbat, the two acts are considered as one, and since the two items together equal the size of a dried fig, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering. But if it was done <b>within two lapses</b> of awareness, i.e., after he carried out the first half of a dried fig he remembered that this act is prohibited or that it was Shabbat, but subsequently forgot again and carried out the second half of a dried fig, he is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> If it was done <b>within one lapse of awareness,</b>
