### Part 1
If one <b>accepted</b> a deposit <b>from a minor,</b> he cannot return it to him, as a minor is unable to properly safeguard the item. Instead, <b>he must make a safe investment [<i>segulla</i>] for him, and if</b> the minor <b>dies,</b> he <b>must return</b> it <b>to his heirs.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>all these</b> people, <b>who said at the time of their death</b> that the deposited item <b>belongs to so-and-so,</b> the bailee <b>should act as they</b> had <b>explained, and if</b> their explanation was <b>not</b> credible, the bailee <b>should form an explanation of their explanation,</b> i.e., ignore what they said.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates: <b>When the wife of Rabba bar bar Ḥana was dying she said: These rings</b> that are in my possession <b>belong to Marta and the sons of her daughter.</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>came before Rav</b> to ask what he should do. Rav <b>said to him: If she is credible in your</b> eyes, <b>act as she</b> had <b>explained, and if not, form an explanation of her explanation,</b> i.e., ignore what she said, and as her heir, keep them for yourself.

### Part 4
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>this is what</b> Rav <b>said to him: If you assess</b> that it is likely that the rings were deposited with her, <b>act as she</b> had <b>explained, and if not, form an explanation of her explanation.</b>

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> stated that if the bailee took a deposit <b>from a minor, he must make a safe investment for him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>a safe investment? Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The bailee should purchase <b>a Torah scroll</b> for the minor. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says:</b> He should purchase <b>a date palm, from which</b> the minor <b>will consume dates.</b>

### Part 6
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And a father does not have</b> the ability to establish the presumption of ownership <b>with regard to a son’s property, and a son does not have</b> the ability to establish the presumption of ownership <b>with regard to a father’s property. Rav Yosef says: Even</b> if <b>they separated</b> and the son is no longer dependent on his father, the presumption of ownership still cannot be established by a father or son with regard to the other’s property. <b>Rava says:</b> If <b>they separated,</b> that is <b>not</b> the <i>halakha</i>, and the presumption of ownership can be established.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Yirmeya of Difti said: Rav Pappi performed an action</b> and ruled that if <b>they separated,</b> that is <b>not</b> the <i>halakha</i>, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥiyya, from</b> the city of <b>Hurmiz Ardeshid, told me that Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov told him in the name of Rav Naḥman bar Yaakov:</b> If <b>they separated,</b> that is <b>not</b> the <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this is the <b><i>halakha</i>:</b> If <b>they separated,</b> that is <b>not</b> the <i>halakha</i>, and the presumption of ownership can be established. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A son who separated</b> himself from his father’s finances <b>and a wife who became divorced are like all other people</b> with regard to establishing the presumption of ownership.

### Part 8
§ It <b>was stated:</b> There was a case of <b>one of the brothers</b> in a family <b>who was engaging in commerce in the house,</b> managing the family finances after the death of their father, <b>and there were bills of sale [<i>onot</i>] and</b> other <b>documents circulating with his name</b> appearing as the owner of the property and as a lender, <b>and</b> that brother <b>said:</b> The money and property <b>are mine, as they fell to me as an inheritance from the house of</b> the <b>father of</b> my <b>mother,</b> who is not the mother of the other brothers, <b>Rav says:</b> It is <b>upon him to bring proof</b> of ownership; otherwise the property is divided equally among the brothers. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> It is <b>upon the brothers to bring proof</b> that the money or property belonged to their common father and consequently now belongs to all of them. <b>Shmuel says: Abba,</b> i.e., Rav, <b>concedes to me that if</b> that brother <b>dies,</b> it is <b>upon the brothers to bring proof</b> in order to collect money from the deceased brother’s heirs.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Pappa objects to</b> Shmuel’s addendum: Do <b>we claim on behalf of orphans anything that their father</b> could <b>not claim for them? But didn’t Rava remove a pair</b> of scissors used <b>for</b> cutting <b>garments and a book of <i>aggada</i> from orphans without</b> requiring the prior owner who had asked the orphans to return these items to bring <b>proof</b> of ownership, and he would rule the same <b>in</b> the case of all <b>items</b> with regard to <b>which it is common</b> for them <b>to be lent,</b> and the one in possession has no presumption of ownership?
