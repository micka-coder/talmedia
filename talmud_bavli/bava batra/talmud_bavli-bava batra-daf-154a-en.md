### Part 1
The Gemara asks: With regard to the <b>proof</b> that the recipients must bring, <b>in what</b> manner is it brought? <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The <b>proof</b> is presented <b>by</b> bringing <b>witnesses</b> who testify that the giver was healthy. <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna say:</b> The <b>proof</b> is presented <b>by</b> the <b>ratification of the deed,</b> i.e., the recipients are required only to ascertain that the signatures of the witnesses on the deed are authentic in order to prove that it is not forged.

### Part 2
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav Huna says</b> that the <b>proof</b> is presented <b>by</b> bringing <b>witnesses.</b> He maintains that Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute of Rabbi Ya’akov and Rabbi Natan</b> in the <i>baraita</i> (153b).

### Part 3
The Gemara notes <b>a mnemonic</b> device that indicates which tannaitic opinions are correlated: <b><i>Manniaḥ</i>,</b> which represents the letters <i>mem</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>ḥet</i>, stands for Meir, Natan, Ya’akov, and the Rabbis [<i>ḥakhamim</i>]. This indicates that <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who says that the giver must bring proof that he was on his deathbed, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan,</b> who maintains that one presumes that the current situation reflects the situation at the time the gift was bestowed. <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who say that the recipients must bring proof that the giver was healthy, hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna say</b> that the <b>proof</b> is presented <b>by</b> the <b>ratification of the deed.</b> The Gemara explains: Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna maintain that Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether when there is a debtor <b>who admits that he wrote</b> a promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor <b>must ratify it</b> in court in order to collect payment. The same ruling would apply to a case where the person on his deathbed admits that he wrote the deed granting the gift. They explain <b>that Rabbi Meir holds</b> that when there is a debtor <b>who admits that he wrote</b> a promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor <b>need not ratify it</b> in court in order to collect payment, and in this case the giver cannot invalidate the deed by claiming that he was on his deathbed. <b>But the Rabbis hold</b> that even when there is a debtor <b>who admits that he wrote</b> a promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor <b>must ratify it</b> in court in order to collect payment.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t they</b> already <b>disagree with regard to this</b> matter <b>once? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to witnesses who ratified their signatures but claimed that at the time they signed the document they were not fit to bear witness, their testimony is <b>not deemed credible to invalidate</b> the document; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> Their testimony is <b>deemed credible.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: It <b>is necessary</b> to state both cases, <b>because if</b> only <b>that</b> case with regard to witnesses who disqualified their testimony <b>was stated,</b> one might think that <b>the Sages say</b> that their testimony is accepted only <b>in that</b> case, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses is powerful and they can impair</b> the validity of the <b>document, but here,</b> with regard to <b>him,</b> the giver, <b>who</b> admitted that he wrote the deed but it <b>is not in his</b> power to impair the validity of the deed, <b>I would say</b> that his claim is <b>not</b> accepted.

### Part 7
<b>And if</b> only <b>this</b> case, with regard to a debtor who admits that he wrote a promissory note, <b>was stated,</b> one might think that <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that the giver cannot invalidate the deed only <b>with regard to this</b> case, <b>but with regard to that</b> case, where the witnesses ratified their signatures, <b>I would say</b> that Rabbi Meir <b>concedes to the Rabbis</b> that witnesses can invalidate the deed. Therefore, it <b>is necessary</b> to state the dispute in both cases.

### Part 8
<b>And Rabba also says:</b> With regard to the <b>proof</b> that the recipients must present, it is presented <b>by</b> bringing <b>witnesses</b> who testify that the giver was healthy. <b>Abaye said to him: What is the reason</b> for this? <b>If we say</b> that <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that in all</b> deeds of gift the following formulation <b>is written: When he was walking on his feet in the marketplace,</b> which indicates that the gift was the gift of a healthy person, <b>and in this</b> deed this <b>was not written,</b> therefore one may <b>conclude from</b> the deed that the giver <b>was on his deathbed,</b> that is not correct. <b>On the contrary,</b> one could say that <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that in all</b> deeds concerning the gifts of a person on his deathbed the following <b>is written: When he was sick and lying in his bed, and in this</b> deed this <b>was not written,</b> therefore one may <b>conclude from</b> the deed that the giver <b>was healthy.</b>

### Part 9
Rabba replied: Since one <b>can say this and</b> one <b>can say that,</b> nothing can be concluded from the formulation of the deed. Therefore, due to the uncertainty, <b>establish the property in the possession of its</b> last known <b>owner.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And</b> this dispute with regard to the statement of the Rabbis is also the subject <b>of a dispute</b> between other <i>amora’im</i>, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b>proof</b> is presented <b>by</b> bringing <b>witnesses, and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> The <b>proof</b> is presented <b>by</b> the <b>ratification of the deed.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident in Bnei Brak involving one who sold</b> some <b>of his father’s property</b> that he had inherited, <b>and he died, and</b> the <b>members of</b> his <b>family came and contested</b> the sale, <b>saying: He was a minor at the time of</b> his <b>death,</b> and therefore the sale was not valid. <b>And they came and asked Rabbi Akiva: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it permitted to exhume the corpse in order <b>to examine it</b> and ascertain whether or not the heir was a minor at the time of his death? Rabbi Akiva <b>said to them:</b> It is <b>not permitted</b> for <b>you to disgrace him</b> for the sake of a monetary claim. <b>And furthermore, signs</b> indicating puberty <b>are likely to change after death,</b> and therefore nothing can be proved by exhuming the body.
