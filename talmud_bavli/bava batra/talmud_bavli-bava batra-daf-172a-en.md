### Part 1
<b>But today, when we do not do this</b> either when writing receipts, how can we avoid double collection of a loan? Rav Kahana <b>said to him: The Sages instituted</b> taking this precaution. <b>One who does</b> what the Sages instituted <b>does</b> it and protects himself from loss; and as for <b>one who does not do</b> so, <b>he has brought the loss upon himself,</b> and will suffer the consequences if the promissory note is found and presented in the future.

### Part 2
<b>Rava bar Rav Sheila said to those who wrote deeds of acquisition,</b> i.e., deeds of sale or deeds of gifts for property they acquired: <b>When you write deeds of acquisition</b> after the acquisition was performed, <b>if you know the day on which you effected the acquisition, write</b> that date on the document. <b>But if</b> you do <b>not</b> know the day on which you effected the acquisition, <b>write the date on which you are currently</b> writing the document. You should follow this procedure, and not write an approximate or estimated date, <b>so that</b> the document shall <b>not appear as a falsehood.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav said to his scribe, and Rav Huna said similarly to his scribe: When you</b> are writing a document and you <b>are situated in Shili, write</b> that the document was written <b>in Shili, and</b> you should do so <b>even if the matters were given over to you,</b> i.e., the transaction attested to in the document took place, <b>in Hini. When you are situated in Hini, write</b> that the document was written <b>in Hini, even if the matters were given over to you in Shili.</b>

### Part 4
§ <b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>this one who is holding</b> a promissory <b>note of one hundred dinars, and he says</b> to the court: <b>Prepare</b> this note <b>for me,</b> i.e., exchange it, for <b>two</b> notes <b>of fifty</b> dinars <b>each,</b> so that if the debtor pays half the debt I will be able to give him one document and keep the other, <b>we do not prepare</b> the new notes for him.

### Part 5
<b>What is the reason? The Sages have performed a matter</b> here <b>that</b> is <b>beneficial to the creditor and</b> is <b>beneficial to the debtor</b> as well. It is <b>beneficial to the creditor</b> to keep the promissory note with the larger sum <b>so that</b> he can <b>coerce</b> the debtor <b>to repay him,</b> as there is a greater incentive to pay off a larger promissory note than a smaller one. <b>And</b> it is <b>beneficial to the debtor, so that</b> when he pays half the debt <b>his</b> promissory <b>note becomes vitiated,</b> and the remainder of the sum written in the vitiated promissory note can be collected only if the creditor takes an oath that he has not received the entire sum.

### Part 6
<b>And Rava said</b> further: With regard to <b>this one who is holding two</b> promissory <b>notes, each of fifty dinars,</b> owed by the same person, <b>and he says</b> to the court: <b>Prepare</b> this note <b>for me</b> into <b>a single</b> note <b>of one hundred</b> dinars, <b>we do not prepare</b> the new note for him.

### Part 7
What is the reason? <b>The Sages have performed a matter</b> here <b>that</b> is <b>beneficial to the creditor and</b> is <b>beneficial to the debtor</b> as well. It is <b>beneficial to the creditor</b> to keep the smaller notes, <b>so that</b> if the debtor pays fifty dinars, <b>his</b> promissory <b>note will not become vitiated,</b> which would require the creditor to take an oath before collecting the remainder. <b>And</b> it is <b>beneficial to the debtor, so that</b> the creditor <b>will not</b> be able to <b>coerce him to repay</b> the debt quickly, as there is a greater incentive to repay a larger sum than a smaller one.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Ashi says:</b> With regard to <b>this one who is holding</b> a promissory <b>note of one hundred dinars, and he said</b> to the court: <b>Prepare</b> this note <b>for me</b> into <b>one</b> note <b>of fifty</b> dinars, as the debtor has paid me half, <b>we do not prepare</b> the new note for him.

### Part 9
<b>What is the reason? We say,</b> i.e., we are concerned, that the following may have happened: <b>This</b> debtor actually <b>repaid</b> all one hundred dinars, <b>and</b> when he did so he <b>said to</b> the creditor: <b>Give me</b> back <b>my</b> promissory <b>note. And</b> the creditor <b>said to him: I lost it. And</b> the creditor <b>wrote a receipt for him</b> in lieu of handing over the promissory note. <b>And</b> now, if we write a new promissory note of fifty dinars for the creditor, <b>he will present this</b> note <b>and say to</b> the debtor, who presents his receipt for a hundred dinars: <b>That</b> receipt <b>is</b> for <b>a different</b> loan that you repaid.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case where there are <b>two brothers, one poor and one rich, and their father left them a bathhouse or an olive press</b> as an inheritance, if the father had <b>built</b> these facilities <b>for profit,</b> i.e., to charge others for using them, <b>the profit</b> that accrues after the father’s death is <b>shared equally</b> by the two brothers. If the father had <b>built them for himself</b> and for the members of his household to use, the poor brother, who has little use for these amenities, cannot force the rich brother to convert the facilities to commercial use; rather, <b>the rich</b> brother can <b>say to the poor</b> brother: Go <b>take servants for yourself, and they will bathe in the bathhouse.</b> Or he can say: Go <b>take olives for yourself, and come and make</b> them into oil <b>in the olive press.</b>

### Part 11
If there are <b>two</b> people <b>who were</b> living <b>in one city, one named Yosef ben Shimon and the other</b> also <b>named Yosef ben Shimon, one cannot present a promissory note against the other,</b> as the purported debtor can claim: On the contrary, it is you who owed me money; you repaid me and I returned this note to you upon payment. <b>Nor can another,</b> third person, <b>present a promissory note against</b> either of <b>them,</b> as each one can claim: It is not I but the other Yosef ben Shimon who owes you money.

### Part 12
If a document <b>is found among one’s documents</b> stating: <b>The promissory note against Yosef ben Shimon is repaid,</b> and both men named Yosef ben Shimon owed this man money, <b>the promissory notes of both of them</b> are considered <b>repaid,</b> as it cannot be determined which debt was repaid and which is outstanding.

### Part 13
<b>What should</b> two people with the same name in a single city <b>do</b> in order to conduct their business? <b>They should triple</b> their names by writing three generations: Yosef ben Shimon ben so-and-so. <b>And if they have</b> identical <b>triple</b> names, i.e., not only their fathers but their grandfathers had identical names, <b>they should write an indication</b> as to which one is referred to, such as: The short Yosef ben Shimon or the dark Yosef ben Shimon. <b>And if they have</b> identical <b>indications, they should write:</b> Yosef ben Shimon <b>the priest,</b> if one of them is a priest.

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> There was <b>a certain</b> promissory <b>note that was presented at the court of Rav Huna, in which it was written: I, so-and-so son of so-and-so, borrowed one hundred dinars from you.</b> No name was given as the creditor, but the one presenting the document claimed that the money was owed to him.
