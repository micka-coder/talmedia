### Part 1
A scribe may <b>write</b> a promissory <b>note for a debtor</b> who requests one, <b>even if</b> the <b>creditor is not with him</b> when he requests the document, <b>but</b> a scribe may <b>not write</b> a promissory note <b>for a creditor</b> who requests it <b>unless</b> the <b>debtor is with him</b> and consents. <b>And</b> it is <b>the debtor</b> who <b>gives</b> the scribe his <b>wages.</b>

### Part 2
A scribe may <b>write a bill</b> of sale <b>for a seller</b> of a field who requests one <b>even if the purchaser is not with him</b> when he presents his request, <b>but</b> a scribe may <b>not write</b> a bill of sale <b>for a purchaser</b> who requests it <b>unless the seller is with him</b> and consents. <b>And</b> it is <b>the purchaser</b> who <b>gives</b> the scribe his <b>wages.</b>

### Part 3
A scribe may <b>not write documents of betrothal and</b> documents of <b>marriage except with the consent of both</b> parties, the groom and the bride. <b>And</b> it is <b>the groom</b> who <b>gives</b> the scribe his <b>wages.</b>

### Part 4
A scribe may <b>not write contracts for sharecroppers and contractors except with the consent of both</b> parties, i.e., the sharecropper or contractor and the one who hires him. <b>And</b> it is <b>the</b> sharecropper or <b>contractor</b> who <b>gives</b> the scribe his <b>wages.</b>

### Part 5
A scribe may <b>not write documents</b> testifying to <b>arbitration</b> agreements <b>or any</b> other <b>court enactment except with the consent of both</b> parties to the litigation. <b>And both</b> parties <b>give</b> the scribe his <b>wages. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The scribe <b>writes two</b> documents <b>for the two</b> parties, one <b>for this</b> one <b>by himself, and</b> one <b>for that</b> one <b>by himself.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What</b> is meant by: <b>Provided that</b> the scribe <b>recognizes</b> the parties requesting the document? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> It means <b>provided that he recognizes the man’s name in the</b> case of <b>the bill of divorce and the woman’s name in</b> the case of <b>the receipt.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Safra and Rav Aḥa bar Huna and Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana</b> were <b>sitting, and Abaye</b> was <b>sitting near them. And</b> as <b>they were sitting, they raised a dilemma:</b> Did Rav mean that with regard to <b>the man’s name in the</b> case of <b>bill of divorce bill, yes,</b> it must be known to the scribe, but <b>the woman’s name</b> need <b>not</b> be known to the scribe? And did he mean that with regard to <b>the woman’s name in</b> the case of <b>the receipt, yes,</b> it must be known to the scribe, but <b>the man’s name</b> need <b>not</b> be known to the scribe?

### Part 8
<b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> there be <b>a concern</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the man who made the request <b>writes the bill of divorce and</b> intends to <b>go and give it to the wife of another</b> man with the same name.

### Part 9
<b>And</b> similarly, in the case of the receipt let there be a concern that there will be <b>times</b> when the <b>woman writes</b> the <b>receipt and</b> intends to <b>give</b> it <b>to a man who is not her</b> husband, whose wife shares her name.

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said to them:</b> You are not understanding Rav’s statement correctly. <b>This</b> is what <b>Rav says: The man’s name in</b> the case of <b>the bill of divorce</b> must be known to the scribe, <b>and the same is true of the woman’s name,</b> which must also be known to the scribe. And <b>the woman’s name in</b> the case of <b>the receipt</b> must be known to the scribe, <b>and the same is true of the man’s name,</b> which must also be known to the scribe.

### Part 11
They continued their line of questioning: <b>And</b> even if both names are known to the scribe, <b>let</b> there be <b>a concern for</b> the possibility of <b>two</b> men with the same name, such as two men named <b>Yosef ben Shimon, who live in one city</b> and whose wives share the same name as well, and <b>perhaps</b> the man who made the request will <b>write the bill of divorce and</b> intend to <b>go and give it to the wife of the other</b> man who bears the same name as him. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Huna said to them</b> in reply that <b>this</b> is what <b>Rav says:</b> If there are <b>two</b> men named <b>Yosef ben Shimon who live in one city</b> and are married to women who share the same name, <b>they may divorce their wives only in the presence of one another.</b>

### Part 12
They continued to ask: <b>But</b> even if the scribe knows the man’s name and the name of the man’s wife, <b>let</b> there be <b>a concern</b> that <b>perhaps</b> someone will <b>go to another city and establish</b> a false <b>name for himself as Yosef ben Shimon, and</b> he <b>will write the bill of divorce and give it to the wife of the other</b> man, whose name really is Yosef ben Shimon.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana said to them</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone whose name has been established in a city</b> for <b>thirty days,</b> there is <b>no concern</b> harbored <b>about him</b> that his name is false. It is assumed that this is his true name.

### Part 14
They continued to ask: <b>What</b> if his name has <b>not</b> been <b>established</b> for thirty days? How can a newcomer in a town have a bill of divorce drawn up for him? <b>Abaye said:</b> It is sufficient <b>that</b> people <b>call him</b> by the name he claims for himself <b>and he responds</b> to that call. <b>Rav Zevid said: A liar is careful about</b> upholding <b>his lies,</b> and just because he responds to being called by a particular name does not prove he is telling the truth. A newcomer would therefore have to wait thirty days before requesting that a scribe write him a bill of divorce.

### Part 15
§ There was <b>a certain receipt</b> of payment of a marriage contract <b>upon which Rav Yirmeya bar Abba was signed</b> as a witness. <b>That woman,</b> whose name matched the name on the receipt, <b>came before</b> Rav Yirmeya, seeking to collect payment of her marriage contract. Rav Yirmeya recognized her name, but not her appearance. The woman <b>said to him: It was not I</b> whose name was on the receipt that you signed, but another woman with the same name; I have not collected payment of my marriage contract. Rav Yirmeya <b>said: I, too, said to</b> the other witnesses signed on the document: The woman for whom we signed the receipt <b>is not she. But they said to me:</b> It is in fact the same woman, but <b>she has aged and her voice has matured</b> and changed, and that is why you do not recognize her.

### Part 16
<b>Abaye said</b> that <b>although the Sages said:</b>
