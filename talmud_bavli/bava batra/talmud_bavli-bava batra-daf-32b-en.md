### Part 1
The first <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>It is a forged bill</b> of sale. The possessor <b>leaned</b> over and <b>whispered to Rabba: Yes, it is a forged bill. But I had a proper bill</b> of sale <b>and it was lost, and I said</b> to myself: <b>I will hold this</b> bill of sale <b>in my possession, such as it is.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabba said: Why would he lie</b> and state this claim? <b>If</b> he <b>wants</b> to lie, he can <b>say to him</b> that <b>it is a proper bill</b> of sale, and he would have been deemed credible and awarded the field. <b>Rav Yosef said to</b> Rabba: In the final analysis, <b>on what</b> are <b>you relying</b> to award him the land? <b>On this bill</b> of sale? <b>This</b> admittedly forged <b>bill is merely</b> a worthless <b>shard,</b> and cannot be used in court as evidence.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates a similar incident: There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: Give me one hundred dinars that I am</b> attempting to <b>collect from you, and this</b> is <b>the</b> promissory <b>note</b> that attests to the debt. The latter <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>It is a forged</b> promissory <b>note.</b> The first person <b>leaned</b> over and <b>whispered to Rava: Yes, it is a forged</b> promissory <b>note. But I had a proper</b> promissory <b>note and it was lost, and I said</b> to myself: <b>I will hold this</b> promissory note <b>in my possession, such as it is.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabba said: Why would he lie</b> and state this claim? <b>If</b> he <b>wants</b> to lie, he can <b>say to him</b> that <b>it is a proper</b> promissory <b>note,</b> and he will be deemed credible and awarded the money. <b>Rav Yosef said to</b> Rabba: In the final analysis, <b>on what</b> are <b>you relying</b> to award him the money? <b>On this</b> promissory <b>note? This document is merely a shard,</b> and cannot be used in court as evidence.

### Part 5
The Gemara notes the final ruling in these two cases. <b>Rav Idi bar Avin said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabba with regard to land,</b> and the possessor is awarded the land, <b>and the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef with regard to money,</b> and the one demanding payment is not awarded the money. He explains: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabba with regard to land,</b> as the court rules <b>that</b> the <b>land</b> should <b>remain where</b> it <b>is,</b> i.e., with the possessor. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef with regard to money,</b> as the court rules <b>that</b> the <b>money</b> should <b>remain where</b> it <b>is,</b> i.e., in the possession of the purported debtor.

### Part 6
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain guarantor who said to a debtor: Give me one hundred dinars</b> for the money <b>that I repaid the creditor on your</b> behalf, <b>and this</b> is <b>the document</b> that I received from him when I repaid your debt. The debtor <b>said to</b> the guarantor: <b>Is it not</b> so that <b>I repaid you?</b> The guarantor <b>said</b> to the debtor: Yes, you did, but <b>is it not</b> so that <b>you later took the</b> money <b>from me</b> again?

### Part 7
<b>Rav Idi bar Avin sent</b> the following question <b>before Abaye: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in <b>a case like this? Abaye sent him</b> the following response: <b>What does he,</b> i.e., Rav Idi bar Avin, <b>ask? Isnâ€™t he</b> the one <b>who said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabba with regard to land, and the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef with regard to money,</b> as the court rules <b>that</b> the <b>money</b> should <b>remain where</b> it <b>is?</b> Based on his own ruling, the money should remain with the debtor.

### Part 8
The Gemara notes: <b>And this matter</b> applies only in a case <b>where</b> the guarantor <b>says to</b> the debtor: <b>You later borrowed</b> the money <b>from me</b> after you had repaid me. <b>But</b> if the guarantor <b>said to</b> the debtor: <b>I returned to you</b> the money that you had repaid me <b>because</b> of the fact <b>that</b> the coins <b>were worn out or</b> overly <b>reddish,</b> i.e., discolored, and would not be easily accepted as currency, then <b>the lien of the document is still</b> in effect. The debt to the guarantor had not actually been repaid, and the document is still in effect. In that case, the guarantor collects from the debtor.

### Part 9
The Gemara relates: <b>A rumor emerged concerning Rava bar Sharshom that</b> he <b>was profiting</b> from <b>land belonging to orphans. Abaye said to him: Tell me, my friend,</b> concerning <b>the incident itself, how is it</b> that this rumor was generated? Rava bar Sharshom <b>said to him: I was holding</b> on to <b>the land as collateral from the father of the orphans, and I had</b>
