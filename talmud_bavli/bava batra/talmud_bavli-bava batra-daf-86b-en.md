### Part 1
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna (84b) that even items that are usually lifted can be acquired by means of pulling: With regard to <b>one who sells produce to another,</b> if the buyer <b>pulled</b> the produce <b>but did not measure</b> it, <b>he has acquired</b> it. The Gemara explains the proof: <b>But produce can be lifted, and</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches that it is acquired by</b> means of <b>pulling.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with large bundles</b> that are pulled from place to place and are not carried, due to their size. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>One who buys flax from another has not acquired</b> it <b>until he carries it from this place to another place,</b> i.e., it is acquired only though lifting and not through pulling. <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>flax is not prepared in large bundles?</b> The Gemara answers: Yes, <b>flax is different.</b> Unlike other produce, flax is not packed in large bundles, <b>as it</b> would <b>slip</b> from its place. Rather, it is packed in small bundles, and therefore flax is acquired specifically through lifting.

### Part 3
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 25b): <b>Large domesticated animals are acquired through passing</b> the animal’s leash to the buyer, <b>and small</b> domesticated animals are acquired <b>through lifting;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. And the Rabbis say: Small domesticated animals</b> are acquired <b>through pulling.</b> Ravina explains the proof: <b>But small domesticated animals are</b> creatures <b>that can be lifted, and</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches that</b> one <b>acquires</b> them <b>through pulling.</b> Rav Ashi rejected this proof: <b>Domesticated animals are different, as they cling</b> to the ground and it is difficult to lift them. Therefore, the usual manner of moving animals is to pull them.

### Part 4
§ The Gemara cites another case with regard to sales. <b>Rav and Shmuel both say:</b> If a seller said to a buyer: <b>I am selling you one <i>kor</i>,</b> a measure equivalent to thirty <i>se’a</i>, of grain <b>for</b> the price of <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, the seller <b>can renege on</b> the sale as long as the measuring vessel is not filled, <b>even when</b> only <b>the last <i>se’a</i></b> has yet to be measured, because he had agreed to sell only a complete <i>kor</i>. By contrast, if the seller said: <b>I am selling you one <i>kor</i> for thirty</b> <i>sela</i> and each <b><i>se’a</i></b> is sold <b>for one <i>sela</i>,</b> he cannot completely renege on the sale in the middle of the transaction. This is because the buyer <b>acquires</b> each <i>se’a</i> <b>one</b> by <b>one</b> as it is measured, since the seller sold each <i>se’a</i> individually.

### Part 5
The Gemara raises a difficulty from the <i>baraita</i> cited on 85a. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: If the measuring</b> vessel <b>belonged to one of them,</b> the buyer <b>acquires</b> the items of sale <b>one</b> by <b>one. And</b> since this <i>halakha</i> is stated in general terms, it indicates that the buyer acquires each item as it is placed in the measuring vessel, <b>even though the measuring</b> vessel <b>was not filled.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>said to him: I am selling you one <i>hin</i>,</b> a liquid measure equivalent to twelve <i>log</i>, <b>for twelve <i>sela</i>,</b> each <b><i>log</i> for one <i>sela</i>. And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> an observation <b>that Rav Kahana says:</b> In the Temple <b>there were markings on the</b> vessel that measured <b><i>hin</i>,</b> with which one could measure the different libations. <b>Here too, there were markings on the measuring</b> vessels, and since the measuring vessel indicates at which point each <i>log</i> had been filled, the buyer acquires it. This is comparable to the case of one who sells each <i>se’a</i> individually.

### Part 7
The Gemara raises another difficulty. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: One who hires a laborer</b> in the winter or the spring <b>to work for him in the harvest, for</b> one <b>dinar a day,</b>
