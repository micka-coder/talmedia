### Part 1
<b>But according to the one who says</b> that Eretz Yisrael was divided <b>among those who entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>what</b> does the verse: <b>“To the more you shall give the more inheritance”</b> teach? It is obvious that larger families will receive more land due to their greater numbers. The Gemara concludes: This poses <b>a difficulty</b> to one who holds that opinion.

### Part 2
The Gemara presents the second question. <b>And Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Granted, according to the one who says</b> that Eretz Yisrael was divided <b>among those who left Egypt, this is</b> why <b>the daughters of Zelophehad cried out</b> in protest of the fact that they would be denied their father’s portion, to which he was entitled as one who left Egypt. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that Eretz Yisrael was divided <b>among those who entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>why did they cry out</b> in protest; after all, Zelophehad <b>was not</b> there <b>to take</b> his portion, so his daughters should have no claim to the land?

### Part 3
Abaye answers: <b>Rather,</b> according to this opinion, the protest of Zelophehad’s daughters was in reference <b>to the returning</b> of the portions from the generation that entered Eretz Yisrael to the generation that left Egypt, as described in the <i>baraita</i> above. <b>And</b> accordingly, Zelophehad’s daughters demanded <b>to take</b> their portion <b>in</b> the <b>property of</b> their grandfather <b>Hepher,</b> who received land posthumously through his children, their uncles.

### Part 4
The Gemara presents Rav Pappa’s third question: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that Eretz Yisrael was divided <b>among those who left Egypt, this is</b> why <b>the descendants of Joseph cried out</b> in protest of the fact that they would receive an inadequate portion of land due to the fact that they had proliferated greatly in the wilderness. <b>As it is written: “And the children of Joseph spoke</b> to Joshua, saying: Why have you given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, because the Lord has blessed me thus” (Joshua 17:14). <b>But according to the one who says</b> that Eretz Yisrael was divided <b>among those who entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>what</b> is the reason <b>they were crying out? They</b> were <b>all</b> entitled to <b>take</b> their own portion of land and should have had no cause for complaint.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: They protested <b>due to the children, as they had many</b> children who were not entitled to a portion of the land.

### Part 6
<b>Abaye said: Learn from</b> the fact that the Bible records the complaints of only the daughters of Zelophehad and the descendants of Joseph that <b>there was not one</b> other individual <b>who did not take</b> a portion of land; <b>as if it enters your mind</b> that <b>there was</b> even <b>one</b> other <b>who did not take</b> a portion of land, <b>he should have cried out</b> in protest. <b>And if you would say: The verse wrote</b> about one <b>who cried out and</b> his protest <b>was effective,</b> and <b>the verse did not write</b> about one <b>who cried out and</b> his protest <b>was not effective,</b> that is difficult. <b>But</b> there is the counterexample of <b>the descendants of Joseph, who cried out and</b> their protest <b>was not effective, and the verse wrote</b> about <b>them.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara rejects Abaye’s inference: Generally, the verse would not record an instance where one cried out if his protest was not effective, and <b>there,</b> the verse includes the protest of Joseph’s descendants in order to <b>teach us</b> a measure of <b>good advice: That a person should be wary of the evil eye. And this is what Joshua said to them, as it is written: “And Joshua said unto them: If you be a great people, go up to the forest,</b> and cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim” (Joshua 17:15). Joshua <b>said to them: Go and conceal yourselves in the forests so that the evil eye will not have dominion over you.</b>
