### Part 1
<b>that merit is brought about by means of</b> one who <b>is meritorious and liability by means of</b> one who <b>is liable.</b> Accordingly, the daughters of Zelophehad merited that the Torah portion concerning a positive matter be written through them, and the wood gatherer deserved that a portion concerning a negative matter be written through him. This concludes Rabbi Ḥideka’s citation of Rabbi Shimon HaShikmoni.

### Part 2
The Gemara states its objection: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>Eretz Yisrael</b> was already <b>in possession</b> of the Jewish people even before the land was assigned, <b>what was</b> Moses <b>uncertain</b> about with regard to the right of Zelophehad’s daughters to collect a double portion; after all, Hepher’s portion in the land was in his possession, and Zelophehad was the firstborn?

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> matter <b>itself</b> is what Moses <b>was uncertain</b> about, <b>as it is written: “And I will give it to you for a heritage [<i>morasha</i>]: I am the Lord”</b> (Exodus 6:8). Moses was unsure if the verse should be understood: <b>It</b> is <b>an inheritance [<i>yerusha</i>] for you from your fathers,</b> such that it is considered in the possession of those who left Egypt; <b>or perhaps</b> the verse indicates another matter, <b>that</b> the generation of those who left Egypt <b>bequeath [<i>morishin</i>]</b> the portions to others <b>but they do not inherit [<i>yoreshin</i>]</b> the portions themselves, because they are destined to die in the wilderness.

### Part 4
The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> God <b>resolved</b> the question <b>for him:</b> The verse teaches <b>both of them. It</b> is <b>an inheritance for you from your fathers</b> and is considered in your possession; <b>and</b> also the generation that left Egypt <b>bequeath but they do not inherit. And this is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> in the song that the Jewish people sang after the splitting of the Red Sea: <b>“You will bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance”</b> (Exodus 15:17). It <b>is not stated: You will bring us in, rather: “You will bring them in,”</b> which <b>teaches that</b> in their song, the Jewish people <b>were prophesying</b> that their generation would never enter Eretz Yisrael, <b>but they did not know what they were prophesying.</b>

### Part 5
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the incident involving Zelophehad’s daughters. The verse states: <b>“And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation”</b> (Numbers 27:2). The Gemara asks: Is it <b>possible</b> that Zelophehad’s daughters <b>stood before Moses</b> and then Eleazar to ask their question, <b>and they said nothing to them; and</b> then the daughters <b>stood before the princes and all the congregation</b> to ask them? How would the princes or the congregation know an answer if Moses and Eleazar did not?

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, transpose the verse and interpret it:</b> First, the daughters went to the congregation and ultimately came to Moses, this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya. Abba Ḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b> Those enumerated in the verse <b>were</b> all <b>sitting in the house of study, and</b> Zelophehad’s daughters <b>went and stood before all of them</b> at once. They were not asked separately; rather, the order of the verse reflects their stature.

### Part 7
The Gemara clarifies: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Abba Ḥanan, <b>holds</b> that one may <b>show honor to a student in the presence of the teacher,</b> such that the verse would mention all the others even though they were in the presence of Moses; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoshiya, <b>holds</b> one may <b>not show</b> honor to a student in the presence of the teacher, such that only Moses would have been mentioned if they were all in the same place.

### Part 8
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that one may <b>show</b> honor to a student, <b>and the <i>halakha</i></b> is that one may <b>not show</b> honor. The Gemara asks: This is <b>difficult,</b> as there is a contradiction between <b>the</b> one <b><i>halakha</i> and the</b> other <b><i>halakha</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: The contradiction between <b>the</b> one <b><i>halakha</i> and the</b> other <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> ruling, that one may show honor, was stated <b>where his teacher</b> himself <b>accords</b> the student <b>honor.</b> In such a case, others also may show the student honor. And <b>that</b> ruling, that one may not show honor, was stated <b>where his teacher does not accord him honor.</b>

### Part 9
§ The Sages <b>taught: The daughters of Zelophehad are wise, they are interpreters</b> of verses, and <b>they are righteous.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara proves these assertions. That <b>they are wise</b> can be seen from the fact <b>that they spoke in accordance with the moment,</b> i.e., they presented their case at an auspicious time. <b>As Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says:</b> Tradition <b>teaches that Moses our teacher was sitting and interpreting in</b> the Torah <b>portion about men whose married brothers had died childless, as it is stated: “If brothers dwell together,</b> and one of them dies, and has no child, the wife of the dead shall not be married abroad to one not of his kin; her husband’s brother shall come to her, and take her for him as a wife” (Deuteronomy 25:5). The daughters of Zelophehad <b>said to</b> Moses: <b>If we are</b> each <b>considered like a son, give us</b> each <b>an inheritance like a son;</b> and <b>if not, our mother should enter into levirate marriage. Immediately</b> upon hearing their claim, the verse records: <b>“And Moses brought their cause before the Lord”</b> (Numbers 27:5).

### Part 11
That <b>they are interpreters</b> of verses can be seen from the fact <b>that they were saying: If</b> our father <b>had had a son, we would not have spoken;</b> but because he had no son, we are filling the role of the heir. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: They would say, if he had had <b>a daughter,</b> we would not have spoken? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: Delete from</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>here</b> the word: <b>Daughter.</b> As they were themselves daughters, this cannot have been their claim. <b>Abaye said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> need not be emended, and should be understood as follows: <b>Even if</b> there <b>was a daughter of a son</b> of Zelophehad, <b>we would not have spoken,</b> for she would have been the heir.

### Part 12
That <b>they are righteous</b> can be seen from the fact <b>that they</b> did <b>not</b> rush to <b>marry,</b> but <b>rather</b> waited <b>to</b> marry those <b>fit for them. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov teaches: Even the youngest</b> to be married <b>among them was not married</b> at <b>less than forty years</b> of age.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rav Ḥisda say:</b> If a woman <b>marries</b> when she is <b>less than twenty</b> years <b>old,</b> she is able to <b>give birth until</b> she reaches the age of <b>sixty;</b> if she marries when she is <b>twenty</b> years <b>old</b> or older, she is able to <b>give birth until</b> she reaches the age of <b>forty;</b> if she marries when she is <b>forty</b> years <b>old</b> or older, she is <b>no longer</b> able to <b>give birth</b> at all. If so, how could Zelophehad’s daughters have waited until the age of forty to marry? <b>Rather, since they are righteous women, a miracle was performed for them, like</b> the one done for <b>Jochebed. As it is written: “And a man of the house of Levi went, and took as a wife a daughter of Levi”</b> (Exodus 2:1).
