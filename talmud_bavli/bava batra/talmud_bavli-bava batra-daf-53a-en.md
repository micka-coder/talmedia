### Part 1
But if the act was performed <b>not in</b> the seller’s <b>presence,</b> the seller <b>must say to him: Go, take possession and</b> thereby <b>acquire</b> the property for him to acquire it.

### Part 2
<b>Rav raises a dilemma: How</b> does one acquire <b>a gift,</b> i.e., is it necessary for the giver to say: Go, take possession and thereby acquire? <b>Shmuel said: What dilemma is raised to Abba,</b> i.e., Rav? <b>Now</b> one could say the following: <b>And what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a sale, where</b> the buyer <b>is giving money</b> to the seller? <b>If</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer: <b>Go, take possession and</b> thereby <b>acquire</b> the property, the acquisition <b>does</b> take effect, but <b>if</b> he did <b>not</b> say this, it does <b>not.</b> Therefore, with regard to <b>a gift,</b> where no money is given to the seller, is it <b>not all the more so</b> reasonable that the acquisition not take effect without a clear directive from the seller? The Gemara answers: <b>And Rav holds</b> that it is possible to say that <b>one who gives a gift gives</b> it <b>generously,</b> and would allow the acquisition even absent a clear directive.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches that taking possession can be performed by building a fence or breaching a fence even a bit. The Gemara clarifies: <b>And how much</b> is the measure of <b>a bit?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel says:</b> If one had previously <b>built a fence, and</b> now <b>completed it to</b> a height of <b>ten</b> handbreadths, which is the height of a halakhically significant barrier; <b>or</b> similarly, if one had previously <b>breached a breach,</b> and now expanded it <b>in order</b> that it be large enough <b>that</b> a person can <b>enter and exit through it, this is</b> considered <b>taking possession.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this fence? If we say that initially</b> one could <b>not climb over it</b> to enter the field, <b>and now too</b> one still could <b>not climb over it, what did he accomplish?</b> Nothing has changed through his completing the height of the fence. <b>And alternatively,</b> if it was such <b>that initially</b> one <b>could climb over it</b> to enter the field, <b>and now</b> one could <b>not climb over it,</b> he has <b>accomplished a great deal,</b> and the mishna should not have referred to this addition as: A bit. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary to</b> state this ruling if the height of the fence was such <b>that initially</b> one <b>could climb over it with ease, and now</b> one <b>could climb over it</b> only <b>with effort.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara similarly asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this breach? If we say that initially,</b> one <b>could enter</b> the field <b>through it, and now too</b> one <b>could enter</b> the field <b>through it, what did</b> he <b>accomplish?</b> Nothing has changed through his expanding the breach? <b>And alternatively,</b> if it was such <b>that initially</b> one <b>could not enter</b> the field <b>through it, and now</b> one <b>could enter</b> the field <b>through it,</b> he has <b>accomplished a great deal,</b> and the mishna should not have referred to this as: A bit. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this ruling if the size of the breach was such <b>that initially</b> one <b>could enter</b> the field <b>through it with effort, and now</b> one <b>could enter</b> the field <b>through it with ease.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>placed a stone and</b> it <b>helps</b> to serve some objective, or if one <b>removed a stone and</b> it <b>helps</b> to serve some objective, <b>this</b> act <b>is</b> considered <b>taking possession.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>placed, and what</b> is the meaning of <b>removed?</b>

### Part 7
<b>If we say</b> that he <b>placed a stone</b> in the fence <b>and stopped the water from</b> flooding the field, or he <b>removed a stone</b> from the fence <b>and</b> thereby fashioned an opening that <b>released water</b> that had been flooding the field, <b>this</b> is analogous to one who <b>chases away a lion from another’s property.</b> In other words, these acts prevent damage to the field, which one is obligated to prevent even in the case of the property of another, and accordingly, they do not constitute a demonstration of ownership. <b>Rather,</b> it means that he <b>placed a stone that connected water to</b> the field and irrigated it, or he <b>removed a stone and enhanced</b> the flow of <b>water to it.</b>

### Part 8
§ The Gemara cites another statement of the same <i>amora</i> with regard to taking possession. <b>And Rav Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If there were <b>two fields with one boundary between them,</b> and one <b>took possession of one of</b> the fields in order <b>to acquire it,</b> he has <b>acquired it.</b>
