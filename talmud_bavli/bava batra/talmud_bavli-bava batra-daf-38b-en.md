<b>That an ordinary</b> situation with regard to travel between <b>Judea and</b> the <b>Galilee is tantamount to a period of crisis.</b>

### Part 2
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> One <b>cannot establish</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to the property of</b> one who is <b>fleeing,</b> as he is unable to lodge a protest. Rav Yehuda reports: <b>When I said this</b> ruling <b>before Shmuel, he</b> disagreed and <b>said to me: But does</b> the owner actually <b>have to protest in</b> the <b>presence of</b> the possessor? Since that is not the case, and he can lodge a protest wherever he is, one can establish the presumption of ownership with regard to the property of one who is fleeing.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav,</b> who ruled that one cannot establish the presumption of ownership with regard to the property of one who is fleeing, <b>what is</b> he <b>teaching us,</b> that <b>a protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence is not</b> a valid <b>protest? But doesn’t Rav say: A protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence is</b> a valid <b>protest?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rav was explaining</b> the <b>reason of the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, <b>but</b> he <b>himself does not hold accordingly.</b> Rav holds, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, that the protest is valid.

### Part 4
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of the previous discussion: <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> One <b>can establish</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to the property of</b> one who is <b>fleeing.</b> Rav Yehuda reports: <b>When I said this</b> ruling <b>before Shmuel, he said to me:</b> Isn’t that <b>obvious? But does</b> the owner actually <b>have to protest in</b> the <b>presence of</b> the possessor?

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav,</b> who ruled that one can establish the presumption of ownership with regard to the property of one who is fleeing, <b>what is</b> he <b>teaching us,</b> that <b>a protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence is</b> a valid <b>protest? But Rav</b> already <b>said this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>one time,</b> and he would not need to repeat it. <b>Rather,</b> Rav <b>teaches us this: That even if</b> the owner <b>protested in the presence of two</b> witnesses <b>who are</b> personally <b>unable to tell</b> the possessor about the protest, <b>it is</b> nevertheless a valid <b>protest.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara explains: <b>As Rav Anan said:</b> This <b>was explained to me personally by Shmuel himself:</b> If the owner <b>protested in the presence of two people who are able to</b> personally <b>tell</b> the possessor, <b>it is</b> a valid <b>protest,</b> but if the owner <b>protested in the presence of two people who are unable to</b> personally <b>tell</b> the possessor, <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>protest. And</b> why does <b>Rav</b> hold that it is a valid protest? Because <b>your friend</b> who heard the protest <b>has a friend</b> to whom he tells about the protest, <b>and your friend’s friend has a friend</b> to whom he tells about the protest, and so forth. Therefore, word of the protest will reach the possessor.

### Part 7
<b>Rava says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that one <b>cannot establish</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to the property of</b> one who is <b>fleeing, and a protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in</b> a possessor’s <b>presence is</b> a valid <b>protest.</b> The Gemara asks: How can he say these <b>two</b> statements that contradict each other? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the second statement, is referring to a case where he is <b>fleeing due to monetary</b> difficulties. In such a case, he is able to ensure that the protest reaches the possessor, while <b>there,</b> the first statement, is referring to a case where he is <b>fleeing due to</b> a charge of <b>killing [<i>meradin</i>].</b> In such a case, he is unable to publicize his protest out of fear of revealing his whereabouts.

### Part 8
§ The Gemara presents a series of disputes with regard to what is considered a valid protest. <b>What manner</b> of statement constitutes <b>a protest? Rav Zevid said:</b> If the owner says in general terms: <b>So-and-so is a robber, it is not</b> a valid <b>protest,</b> but if he says: <b>So-and-so is a robber as</b> he <b>is holding my land through robbery,</b>
