### Part 1
<b>Here, too,</b> with regard to the Temple treasury, apply the same principle and say: <b>A person is prone</b> to make false statements so as <b>not to make himself</b> appear <b>sated.</b> It is therefore possible that the money was not owed, and payment should not be made from the consecrated property.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> does <b>Rav Huna say</b> that payment should be made <b>there,</b> in the case of a person on his deathbed who consecrated all his property? In a case <b>where</b> the creditor, to whom the deceased admitted owing money, <b>holds</b> a promissory <b>note</b> corroborating the deceased’s admission.

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: <b>By inference,</b> the statement <b>of Rav and Shmuel,</b> where the money is not given to the creditor unless the person on his deathbed explicitly requests that it be given, is applicable in a case <b>where</b> the creditor <b>does not hold</b> a promissory <b>note</b> corroborating the admission. The Gemara asks: If so, how can it be that if the deceased <b>says: Give</b> him the money, the children <b>give</b> it to him, i.e., it is collected from the estate left to the heirs, as <b>it is a loan by oral</b> contract, <b>and as Rav and Shmuel both say: One does not collect a loan by oral</b> contract <b>from heirs nor from purchasers</b> who bought land from the debtor after the loan was granted?

### Part 4
The Gemara gives a different answer to this question. <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said:</b> Both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case are discussing <b>where</b> the creditor <b>holds</b> a promissory <b>note</b> corroborating the deceased’s admission. <b>And</b> yet it is <b>not difficult.</b> In <b>this</b> ruling of Rav Huna, the case is <b>where</b> the creditor’s promissory note has been <b>ratified</b> by the court, and in <b>that</b> ruling of Rav and Shmuel, the case is <b>where</b> the creditor’s promissory note has <b>not</b> been <b>ratified</b> by the court. Therefore, in the latter case, if the person on his deathbed <b>says: Give</b> him the money, he <b>has</b> in effect <b>ratified</b> the creditor’s promissory <b>note,</b> and if he did <b>not say: Give</b> him the money, he has <b>not ratified</b> the creditor’s promissory <b>note.</b>

### Part 5
§ <b>Rabba says</b> that in the case of <b>a person on his deathbed who says: So-and-so has one hundred dinars in my possession, and the orphans</b> who inherited his property subsequently <b>said: We repaid</b> the debt, <b>they are deemed credible.</b> But if the father said: <b>Give one hundred dinars to so-and-so,</b> as I owe it to him, <b>and</b> subsequently <b>the orphans said: We repaid</b> him the money, <b>they are not deemed credible.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara objects: <b>Isn’t it the opposite [<i>kelappei layya</i>]? The opposite is</b> more <b>reasonable.</b> If the father <b>says: Give one hundred dinars</b> to so-and-so, <b>since their father stated the matter assertively,</b> as he gave an explicit directive, <b>it could be said that</b> the heirs <b>repaid</b> the money. But if he said: <b>So-and-so has one hundred dinars in my possession, since</b> the orphans’ <b>father did not state the matter assertively, it could be said that</b> the heirs <b>did not repay</b> the creditor.

### Part 7
The Gemara reformulates Rabba’s statement: <b>Rather, if</b> Rabba’s statement <b>was stated, it was stated as follows:</b> In a case of <b>a person on his deathbed who says: So-and-so has one hundred dinars in my possession, and the orphans</b> subsequently <b>said:</b> After his admission, <b>Father retracted</b> his words <b>and said to us: I repaid</b> the debt, <b>they are deemed credible. What is the reason</b> for this? At first the father had forgotten, but subsequently <b>he remembered</b> repaying the debt. But if the father says assertively: <b>Give one hundred dinars to so-and-so, and the orphans</b> subsequently <b>said:</b> Afterward <b>Father retracted</b> his words <b>and said: I repaid</b> the debt, <b>they are not deemed credible.</b> The reason is <b>that if it is so that</b> the father <b>repaid</b> the debt or was uncertain about the matter, <b>he would not say</b> with such assertiveness: <b>Give</b> the money to him.

### Part 8
§ <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a person on his deathbed who,</b> upon hearing someone’s monetary claim against him, <b>admitted</b> owing the money to him, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it <b>required</b> for him <b>to say</b> to two people: <b>You are my witnesses,</b> as is usually necessary in order to prove that an admission is stated in earnest and not in jest? <b>Or</b> is it perhaps <b>not required</b> for him <b>to say: You are my witnesses,</b> since he is a person on his deathbed, whose instructions are generally binding? Is it <b>required that he say</b> to two people: <b>Write</b> my admission in a document, as is usually required, <b>or</b> is it <b>not required</b> for him <b>to say: Write</b> my admission in a document? The issue in question here is: Does <b>a person</b> sometimes <b>jest at the time of death,</b> i.e., while on his deathbed, <b>or</b> can it be assumed that <b>a person</b> does <b>not jest at the time of death?</b>

### Part 9
<b>After</b> Rava <b>raised the dilemma, he then resolved it,</b> and ruled: <b>A person</b> does <b>not jest at the time of death, and</b> therefore <b>the statements of a person on his deathbed are considered as</b> if they were <b>written</b> in a document <b>and transmitted</b> to the relevant party.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who lends</b> money <b>to another by means of</b> a promissory <b>note can collect</b> the debt <b>from liened property</b> that had been sold to others by the debtor after the loan was granted. One who lends money <b>by means of witnesses,</b> without recording the loan in a promissory note, <b>can collect</b> the debt only <b>from unsold property.</b>
