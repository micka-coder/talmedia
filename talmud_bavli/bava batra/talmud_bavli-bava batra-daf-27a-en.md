### Part 1
<b><i>beit se’a</i> for their</b> sake. <b>How much</b> is that area in cubits? It is <b>2,500</b> square <b>cubits. And how much</b> area is that <b>for each</b> of the trees? It is <b>833⅓. Still, Ulla's</b> amount <b>is greater</b> than this. The Gemara answers: Ulla <b>was not precise</b> in this matter.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: One can <b>say that we say</b> that a Sage <b>was not precise</b> in his measurements when his ruling leads <b>to a stringency;</b> but <b>do we say</b> that he <b>was not precise</b> if his measurements lead <b>to a leniency?</b> According to the previous explanation, Ulla exempts the owner of a tree from first fruits even in a case where his tree does not in fact draw nourishment from his neighbor’s field.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>Do you maintain</b> that <b>we say</b> the roots extend that far <b>in a square,</b> i.e., one measures sixteen cubits to each side of the tree? Not so; <b>we say</b> this <b>with regard to a circle,</b> that is, the roots extend in a circle surrounding the tree, as the area of a circle is smaller than that of the square circumscribing it.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>Now,</b> by <b>how much is</b> the area of <b>a square greater than the</b> area of a <b>circle</b> with a diameter the length of the side of that square? It is greater by <b>one-quarter</b> of the area of the circle. If so, <b>768</b> square cubits, three-quarters of 1,024, <b>remain</b> for each tree, but <b>there still remains half a cubit</b> more based on the mishna’s calculation. In other words, the measurement would be more accurate if a tree is considered to draw nourishment from a distance of sixteen and a half cubits on each side. The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> why we said that Ulla <b>was not precise, and</b> he was <b>not precise</b> in a manner that leads <b>to a stringency,</b> as one brings first fruits even from a tree that stands just sixteen cubits from the boundary, rather than 16½.

### Part 5
The Gemara cites a proof against the opinion of Ulla. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:11): <b>One who buys a tree and its land brings</b> first fruits <b>and recites</b> the requisite Torah verses (Deuteronomy 26:5–11) over them. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case where one buys <b>any amount</b> of land with the tree? The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>No;</b> it is referring to a case where one buys <b>sixteen cubits</b> of land around the tree.

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an additional proof from another mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:6): If one <b>bought two trees in</b> the field <b>of another, he brings</b> first fruits <b>and does not recite</b> the verses, because the land does not belong to him. It may be inferred from here that if he bought <b>three</b> trees <b>he does bring</b> first fruits <b>and recite</b> the verses. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case where one buys <b>any amount</b> of land with the trees? The Gemara rejects this claim as well: <b>No; here too</b> it is referring to a case where he acquires <b>sixteen cubits</b> of land around the trees.

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:6). <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The owner of <b>land of any</b> size <b>is obligated in <i>pe’a</i> and in first fruits, and</b> a lender <b>can write a document that prevents the Sabbatical Year from abrogating an outstanding debt [<i>prosbol</i>] for</b> this land, so that loans he provided will not be canceled at the close of the Sabbatical Year,
