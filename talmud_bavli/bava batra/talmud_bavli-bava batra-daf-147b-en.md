### Part 1
The Gemara answers: The difference is <b>with regard to the prayer of the High Priest,</b> who would pray on Yom Kippur for beneficial weather, and this knowledge enabled him to formulate his prayers accordingly.

### Part 2
The Gemara resumes the discussion with regard to the gifts of a person on his deathbed: <b>And Rava</b> says that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that the <b>gift of a person on his deathbed</b> does not require an act of acquisition <b>is merely by rabbinic law,</b> and it is instituted <b>lest</b> he see that his will is not being carried out and <b>he lose control of his mind</b> due to his grief, exacerbating his physical state.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rav Naḥman</b> actually <b>say this? But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say: Even though Shmuel says</b> that with regard to <b>one who sells a promissory note to another and then forgives</b> the debt, the debt <b>is forgiven</b> and the note is nullified, <b>and even</b> the <b>heir</b> of the creditor can <b>forgive</b> the debt, <b>Shmuel concedes that if</b> the creditor <b>gave</b> the promissory note <b>as the gift of a person on his deathbed,</b> his heir <b>cannot forgive</b> the debt?

### Part 4
<b>Granted, if you say</b> that the gift of a person on his deathbed is valid <b>by Torah law</b> without an act of acquisition, <b>due to that</b> reason the heir <b>cannot forgive</b> the debt, as the debt was acquired by another. <b>But if you say</b> that <b>it</b> is valid <b>by rabbinic law, why</b> is the heir <b>unable to forgive</b> the debt? The Gemara replies: Rav Naḥman maintains that although this gift <b>is not</b> effective <b>by Torah law,</b> nevertheless, the Sages <b>made it</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>with</b> the force <b>of Torah law.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> With regard to <b>a person on his deathbed who says: So-and-so shall reside in this house,</b> or who says: <b>So-and-so shall eat</b> the <b>fruit of this palm tree,</b> he <b>has not said anything,</b> as one cannot give that which is not tangible, such as the right to use property, or the right to consume fruit that has not yet grown. His statement is ineffective <b>until he says: Give this house to so-and-so and he shall reside there,</b> or: <b>Give this palm tree to so-and-so and he shall eat its fruit.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Rav Naḥman maintains</b> that only <b>a matter that can be</b> conferred as a gift <b>by a healthy person</b> with an act of acquisition <b>can be</b> conferred as a gift <b>by a person on his deathbed</b> by means of verbal instruction, but a matter <b>that cannot be</b> conferred as a gift <b>by a healthy person cannot be</b> conferred as a gift <b>by a person on his deathbed?</b> Consequently, a person on his deathbed cannot transfer ownership of an intangible right, just as a healthy person cannot do so. <b>But doesn’t Rava say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b>
