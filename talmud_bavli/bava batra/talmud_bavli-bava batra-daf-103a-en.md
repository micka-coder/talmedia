<b>they are not measured</b> together <b>with</b> the rest of the field. If the crevices or rocks were <b>less than</b> ten handbreadths, <b>they are measured</b> together <b>with</b> the rest of the field.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> are the crevices that are deeper and the rocks that are higher than ten handbreadths not measured with the rest of the field? <b>Let them</b> at least <b>be consecrated separately</b> and require their own redemption. <b>And if you would say that since they are not</b> the size of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>, they cannot be consecrated,</b> there is a difficulty.

### Part 3
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse: “And if he that sanctified the field will redeem it” (Leviticus 27:19): <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> the word <b>“field”?</b> Since the previous verses are all discussing a field, it would have sufficed for this verse to refer to the field with the pronoun: It. Rather, <b>as it is stated</b> in an earlier verse: “Then your valuation shall be according to the seed required for it; <b>a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver”</b> (Leviticus 27:16), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of one who <b>consecrated in this manner,</b> i.e., an area fit to sow a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley seed.

### Part 4
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From where</b> do I learn that this <i>halakha</i> is also meant <b>to include</b> the case of one who consecrated a smaller area, e.g., an area fit to sow <b>a <i>letekh</i>,</b> i.e., a half-<i>kor</i>, <b>a half-<i>letekh</i>, a <i>se’a</i>, a <i>tarkav</i>, and a half-<i>tarkav</i>?</b> From where is it derived that these smaller plots of land can also be consecrated and redeemed in accordance with the fixed values stated in the Torah? <b>The verse states: “A field,”</b> teaching that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>in any case</b> of a field, even to smaller plots.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said: Here,</b> in the mishna in <i>Arakhin</i>, <b>we are dealing with crevices filled with water.</b> Being <b>that they are not fit for sowing,</b> they cannot be consecrated, as the verse states: “Then your valuation shall be according to the seed required for it” (Leviticus 27:16). The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise</b> according to this interpretation, <b>as it teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> about crevices that are <b>similar to rocks,</b> which are certainly not fit for sowing. The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from this</b> that this explanation is correct.

### Part 6
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If</b> this is <b>so,</b> that the crevices and rocks of the mishna are excluded from being consecrated because they are unfit for sowing, then <b>even</b> if they <b>are less than</b> ten handbreadths in depth or height, they <b>also</b> should not be consecrated. The Gemara answers: If the crevices or rocks are less than ten handbreadths deep or high, <b>these</b> crevices <b>are called the cracks of the earth,</b> and these rocks <b>are called the spines [<i>shidrei</i>] of the earth.</b> In other words, since they are considered standard features of the field and do not constitute separate areas, they are consecrated together with the rest of the field.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: The <i>halakha</i> stated above was taught with regard to consecrated property. <b>Here,</b> in the case of a sale of land, with regard to which the mishna teaches that crevices ten handbreadths deep are not measured along with the land, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does that <i>halakha</i> apply only when the crevices are filled with water? <b>Rav Pappa said: Even if they are not filled with water</b> they are not considered part of the field. <b>What is the reason</b> that in the case of a sale crevices are not considered part of the field even if they are not filled with water? Because <b>a person</b> buying a field <b>does not want to give his money for</b> the purchase of <b>one plot when it appears to him like two or three</b> different <b>plots</b> due to differences in the height of the terrain. Therefore, those crevices that are ten handbreadths deep are not measured along with the rest of the field, regardless of whether or not they are filled with water.

### Part 8
<b>Ravina objects to this: But</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> about crevices in a manner indicating that they are <b>similar to</b> the <b>rocks</b> discussed in the mishna. <b>Just as rocks are not fit for sowing, so too, these</b> crevices are such <b>that they are not fit for sowing.</b> But if they are not filled with water, and are therefore fit for sowing, then even if they are lower than the rest of the field, they should be included in the sale. The Gemara replies: <b>When</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> about crevices in a manner indicating that they are <b>similar to</b> the <b>rocks</b> discussed in the mishna, it teaches about crevices that <b>are less than that,</b> i.e., less than ten handbreadths deep. In such a case, even if they are not fit for sowing, they are measured along with the rest of the field.

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches that if the crevices or rocks in the field measured <b>less than</b> ten handbreadths, <b>they are measured</b> together <b>with</b> the rest of the field. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: The rocks</b> or crevices that measure less than ten handbreadths <b>that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> are measured together with the rest of the field must not measure more than <b>an area required for sowing four <i>kav</i></b> of seed within an area required for sowing a <i>kor</i>. <b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama says: This applies</b> specifically <b>where</b> the rocks <b>are scattered throughout an area required for sowing five <i>kav</i>. Rav Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This applies</b> specifically <b>where</b> the rocks <b>are scattered throughout the greater part of the field.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba raises a dilemma</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> taught in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: If <b>the majority of</b> the rocks are scattered <b>throughout the smaller part</b> of the field, <b>and the minority of</b> the rocks are scattered <b>throughout the greater part</b> of the field, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved, as no answer was found.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises</b> another <b>dilemma:</b>
