### Part 1
<b>And Shmuel said:</b> Even if the wine sours shortly after the purchase, the seller does not bear responsibility, as <b>the wine is agitated</b> as it is carried <b>upon the shoulders of its</b> new <b>owner,</b> causing it to sour quickly.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yosef ruled</b> in an actual <b>case in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav, in</b> which <b>beer</b> spoiled shortly after it was sold, <b>and in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel in</b> a similar case involving <b>wine. And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel.</b>

### Part 3
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Whether</b> one drinks <b>date beer, or barley beer, or</b> a beverage made from soaking <b>pomace</b> from the production of <b>wine</b> in water, known as <i>tamad</i>, <b>one recites over them the blessing: By Whose word all things came to be. <i>Aḥerim</i> say: Over</b> wine made from <b>pomace that has the taste of wine</b> one <b>recites the blessing: Who creates fruit of the vine. Rabba and Rav Yosef both say: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rava said:</b> According to the opinions <b>of everyone</b> mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, if <b>one poured three</b> jugs of water over grape pomace <b>and</b> then, after removing the pomace, the volume of the resulting beverage <b>came to four</b> jugs, then that beverage <b>is</b> regarded as <b>wine.</b> Evidently, a quarter of the resulting beverage is from juice that was contained in the pomace, which is pure wine, and that is a sufficient ratio for the beverage as a whole to be regarded as wine. The Gemara interjects Rava’s comments: With this statement, <b>Rava</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rava said: Any wine that does not contain three</b> parts <b>water to one</b> part pure wine <b>is not</b> regarded as <b>wine,</b> as it is excessively strong.

### Part 5
Rava continues: If <b>one poured three</b> jugs of water over pomace, <b>and</b> the volume of the resulting beverage still <b>came to three</b> jugs, then <b>it is nothing,</b> i.e., it is not regarded as wine. <b>When</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>disagree</b> is in a case <b>where one poured three</b> jugs of water over pomace <b>and</b> the volume of the resulting beverage <b>came to three and a half</b> jugs, <b>as the Rabbis,</b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>hold</b> that <b>three</b> jugs of water <b>were absorbed into</b> the pomace and then the same <b>three</b> jugs of water <b>seeped out</b> of the pomace; therefore, there <b>remains half</b> a jug of the resulting beverage that was originally pure wine contained in the pomace. <b>But half</b> a jug of pure wine mixed <b>into six half-</b>jugs of <b>water is nothing,</b> i.e., the mixture is too weak to be regarded as wine.

### Part 6
<b>And <i>Aḥerim</i> hold</b> that <b>three</b> jugs of water <b>were absorbed into</b> the pomace but only <b>two and a half</b> jugs of water <b>seeped out</b> of the pomace, as one jug of water replaced the one jug of pure wine contained in the pomace. Therefore, there <b>remains</b> one <b>jug</b> of the resulting beverage that is pure wine that was previously contained in the pomace. <b>And</b> one <b>jug</b> of pure wine mixed <b>into two and a half</b> jugs of water <b>is</b> regarded as <b>full-fledged wine.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And where</b> the volume of the resulting beverage <b>is greater than the amount</b> of water that was poured over the pomace, <b>do</b> the Sages ever <b>disagree? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 5:6):
