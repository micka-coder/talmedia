### Part 1
that <b>it was stated:</b> With regard to <b>a son who sold</b> some <b>of his father’s property during his father’s lifetime, and</b> the son <b>died,</b> the son’s <b>son repossesses</b> the property <b>from the buyers. And this is a difficult</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to monetary law,</b> as the buyers <b>can say to</b> the son’s son: Does <b>your father sell</b> the property to us <b>and you repossess</b> it?

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the difficulty? Perhaps he can say: I come</b> to repossess the property <b>on the basis of</b> the right of my <b>father’s father</b> to the property, as I inherit directly from him. <b>Know</b> that this is so, <b>as it is written: “In the place of your fathers shall be your sons; you shall make them into princes throughout the land”</b> (Psalms 45:17). The phrase “In the place of your fathers shall be your sons” indicates that a grandson inherits from his grandfather directly, and he does not inherit through his father.

### Part 3
<b>Rather, if</b> there is a <i>halakha</i> with regard to monetary law that poses <b>a difficulty, this is the difficult</b> <i>halakha</i>: With regard to <b>a firstborn son who sold, during his father’s lifetime,</b> the <b>portion of the firstborn</b> that he was set to inherit, <b>and</b> he <b>died in his father’s lifetime, his son can repossess</b> the portion of the firstborn <b>from the buyers. And this is a difficult</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to monetary law,</b> as <b>his father sells</b> the property and <b>he repossesses</b> it. <b>And if you would say: Here too, he says: I come</b> to repossess the property <b>on the basis of</b> the right of my <b>father’s father</b> to the property, this is not a valid claim, as, <b>if he comes</b> to repossess the property <b>on the basis of</b> the right of his <b>father’s father, what is the relevance of</b> the <b>portion of the firstborn,</b> since he is not his grandfather’s firstborn?

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this: <b>And what is the difficulty? Perhaps he can say: I come</b> to repossess the property <b>on the basis of</b> the right of my <b>father’s father</b> to the property, <b>and</b> yet I receive the portion of the firstborn, as <b>I stand in</b> my <b>father’s stead.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rather, if</b> there is a <i>halakha</i> with regard to monetary law that poses <b>a difficulty, this is the difficult</b> <i>halakha</i>: One <b>knew testimony supporting</b> another, and his testimony was written <b>in a document before he became a robber, and</b> then <b>he became a robber</b> and was disqualified from bearing witness. In this case, <b>he may not testify as to</b> the legitimacy of <b>his handwriting. But others may testify</b> that it is his handwriting on the document. The difficulty is that <b>now</b> that <b>his</b> testimony <b>is not deemed credible,</b> although he knows of the matter with certainty, is it logical that <b>others are deemed credible</b> and his signature is ratified according to their testimony? <b>And this is a difficult</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to monetary law.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara rejects this: <b>What is the difficulty? Perhaps</b> this <i>halakha</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the signature <b>was</b> already <b>presumed by</b> the <b>court</b> to be <b>his handwriting</b> before he was disqualified, and the witnesses testify merely that the document was already ratified.

### Part 7
<b>Rather, if</b> there is a <i>halakha</i> with regard to monetary law that poses <b>a difficulty, this is the difficult</b> <i>halakha</i>: One <b>knew testimony supporting</b> another concerning the latter’s ownership of a plot of land, and his testimony was written <b>in a document before</b> the land <b>came into</b> the witness’s possession <b>as an inheritance,</b> which caused the witness to become an interested party. In this case, the witness <b>may not ratify his handwriting. But others may ratify his handwriting.</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>And what is the difficulty? Perhaps here too,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the signature <b>was</b> already <b>presumed by</b> the <b>court</b> to be <b>his handwriting</b> before he became an interested party, and the witnesses testify merely that the document was already ratified.

### Part 8
<b>Rather, if</b> there is a <i>halakha</i> with regard to monetary law that poses <b>a difficulty, this is the difficult</b> <i>halakha</i>: One <b>knew testimony with regard to</b> another, and his testimony was written in a document <b>before he became</b> that person’s <b>son-in-law, and</b> then <b>he became his son-in-law.</b> In this case, the son-in-law <b>may not testify as to his handwriting,</b> since one cannot bear witness for his relative. <b>But others may testify</b> that it is his handwriting. Is it logical that <b>his</b> testimony <b>is not deemed credible,</b> yet <b>others are deemed credible</b> and may ratify his signature?

### Part 9
<b>And if you would say: Here too,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the signature <b>was</b> already <b>presumed by</b> the <b>court</b> to be <b>his handwriting</b> before he became a relative, this is difficult. <b>But doesn’t Rav Yosef bar Minyumi say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> Others may testify as to the validity of his handwriting <b>even though</b> the signature <b>was not</b> previously <b>presumed by</b> the <b>court</b> to be <b>his handwriting?</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara rejects this: <b>And what is the difficulty? Perhaps it is the King’s edict,</b> i.e., a divine decree, <b>that</b> the testimony of a son-in-law <b>is not deemed credible, and</b> yet the testimony of <b>others is deemed credible, and</b> the reason he is disqualified is <b>not that he is</b> suspected of <b>lying.</b> This must be so, <b>as if you do not say so,</b> why are <b>Moses and Aaron</b> disqualified from bearing witness <b>for their father-in-law?</b> Could this be <b>because their</b> testimony <b>is not deemed credible? Rather, it is the King’s edict that</b> even Moses and Aaron <b>shall not bear witness for</b> their relatives. <b>Here too, it is the King’s edict that</b> a son-in-law <b>shall not testify as to</b> the validity of <b>his handwriting for his father-in-law.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rather,</b> the difficulty is <b>actually as we said initially,</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that if a son sold some of his father’s property and then died, the son’s son repossesses the property from the buyers. <b>And</b> with regard to the verse <b>that</b> posed <b>a difficulty for you: “In the place of your fathers shall be your sons”</b> (Psalms 45:17), which apparently indicates that a grandson inherits from his grandfather directly, this is not difficult. <b>That</b> verse <b>is written as a blessing.</b> The verse does not indicate the halakhic status of the grandson’s inheritance, and the reason he can repossess the property is still difficult.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>But can you say</b> that the verse <b>is written as a blessing,</b>
