### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who sells produce to another</b> that is sometimes purchased for consumption and sometimes for planting, <b>and</b> the buyer <b>planted it and it did not sprout, and even</b> if he had sold <b>flaxseeds,</b> which are only occasionally eaten, the seller <b>does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for them,</b> i.e., he is not required to compensate the buyer. Since the buyer did not specify that he purchased the produce in order to plant it, the seller can claim that he assumed the buyer intended to eat it. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If he had sold <b>seeds</b> for <b>garden</b> plants, <b>which are not eaten</b> at all, then the seller <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility for them,</b> as they were certainly purchased for planting.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> An amoraic dispute <b>was stated</b> with regard to <b>one who sells an ox to another and</b> the ox <b>is found</b> to be <b>one that habitually gores. Rav says: This is a mistaken transaction,</b> since the buyer can claim that he bought the ox specifically for labor, and an ox that gores is not suitable for this function. Therefore, the seller must take back the ox and reimburse the buyer. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> The sale is not voided, as the seller <b>can say to him: I sold it to you for slaughter,</b> and the fact that it gores is immaterial.

### Part 3
The Gemara suggests: <b>But let us see if</b> the buyer is <b>a man who</b> generally <b>purchases</b> oxen <b>for slaughter,</b> in which case it can be presumed that he also purchased this ox <b>for slaughter, or if</b> he is a man who generally purchases oxen <b>for plowing,</b> in which case it can be presumed that he also purchased this ox <b>for plowing.</b> The Gemara answers: The dispute <b>concerns a man who</b> sometimes <b>purchases</b> oxen <b>for this</b> purpose <b>and</b> sometimes <b>for that</b> purpose, and so it is uncertain for which purpose he purchased this ox.

### Part 4
The Gemara persists: <b>But let us see the payment</b> he made; <b>how much was it?</b> Since an ox fit for plowing costs more than one fit only for slaughter, the purpose for which the ox was purchased will be apparent from the price paid.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to discuss the case <b>where</b> the price of an ox to be slaughtered for its <b>meat appreciated and reached</b> the <b>value of</b> an ox for <b>plowing.</b> But if the price disparity is significant, there is no dispute. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, for</b> the sake of <b>what</b> practical <b>difference</b> did they discuss the case? Even if the ox was not suitable for the buyerâ€™s purposes, he could sell it for the same price of the ox he needs. The Gemara answers: The practical <b>difference</b> is <b>with regard to the effort</b> of selling the ox in order to recover its value; who must go to the effort of doing so?

### Part 6
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case under discussion?
