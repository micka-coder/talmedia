<b>and they were lying on their backs. And the knee of one of them was elevated, and</b> he was so enormous that the <b>Arab entered under his knee while riding a camel and with his spear upright, and he did not touch him. I cut one corner of the sky-blue</b> garment that contains ritual fringes <b>of one of them, and we were unable to walk.</b> The Arab <b>said to me: Perhaps you took something from them? Return it, as we know</b> by tradition <b>that one who takes something from them cannot walk. I then returned</b> the corner of the garment, <b>and then we were able to walk.</b>

### Part 2
<b>When I came before the Sages, they said to me</b> in rebuke: <b>Every Abba</b> is <b>a donkey, and every bar bar Ḥana</b> is <b>an idiot. For</b> the purpose of clarifying <b>what <i>halakha</i> did you do that?</b> If you wanted <b>to know whether</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai or in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel,</b> as to whether there are four or three threads and joints in ritual fringes, in that case there was no need to take anything with you, as <b>you should have</b> simply <b>counted the threads and counted the joints.</b>

### Part 3
Rabba bar bar Ḥana continues his account. That Arab also <b>said to me: Come, I will show you Mount Sinai. I went</b> and <b>saw that scorpions were encircling it, and they were standing</b> as high <b>as white donkeys. I heard a Divine Voice saying: Woe is Me that I took an oath; and now that I took the oath, who will nullify it for me?</b>

### Part 4
<b>When I came before the Sages, they said to me</b> in rebuke: <b>Every Abba</b> is <b>a donkey, and every bar bar Ḥana</b> is <b>an idiot. You should have said: Your</b> oath <b>is nullified.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana did not nullify the oath because <b>he reasoned: Perhaps</b> God <b>is</b> referring to the <b>oath that</b> He will not <b>flood</b> the earth again. <b>But the Sages</b> would argue that <b>if</b> that were <b>so, why</b> say: <b>Woe is Me?</b> Rather, this must be referring to God’s oath of exile upon the Jewish people.

### Part 5
Rabba bar bar Ḥana continues his account. The Arab also <b>said to me: Come, I will show you those who were swallowed</b> by the earth due to the sin <b>of Korah. I saw two rifts</b> in the ground <b>that were issuing smoke.</b> The Arab <b>took a shearing of wool, and dipped it in water, and inserted it on the head of a spear, and placed it</b> in <b>there. And when he removed</b> the wool, it <b>was scorched. He said to me: Listen</b> to <b>what you hear; and I heard that they were saying: Moses and his Torah are true, and they,</b> i.e., we in the earth, <b>are liars.</b> The Arab further <b>said to me: Every thirty days Gehenna returns them to here, like meat in a pot</b> that is moved around by the boiling water as it cooks. <b>And</b> every time <b>they say this: Moses and his Torah are true, and they,</b> i.e., we in the earth, <b>are liars.</b>

### Part 6
This Arab also <b>said to me: Come, I will show you</b> the place <b>where the earth and the heavens touch each other. I took my basket</b> and <b>placed it in a window of the heavens. After I</b> finished <b>praying, I searched for it but did not find it. I said to him: Are there thieves here? He said to me: This is the heavenly sphere that is turning around; wait here until tomorrow and you will find it.</b>

### Part 7
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan relates: Once we were traveling on a ship and we saw a certain fish that took its head out of the sea, and its eyes had the appearance of two moons, and water scattered from its two gills like the two rivers of Sura. Rav Safra relates: Once we were traveling on a ship and we saw a certain fish that took its head out of the sea, and it had horns, and</b> the following was <b>inscribed on them: I am a lowly creature of the sea and I am three hundred parasangs</b> long, <b>and I am going into the mouth of the leviathan. Rav Ashi said: That is the goat of the sea, which searches</b> through the sea <b>and has horns.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan relates: Once we were traveling on a ship and we saw a certain crate [<i>kartalita</i>] in which precious stones and pearls were set, and a species of fish called sharks encircled it.</b> He <b>descended,</b>
