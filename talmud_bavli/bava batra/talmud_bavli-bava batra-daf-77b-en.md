### Part 1
This is <b>like that which we learned</b> in a mishna (167b): A scribe <b>may write a bill</b> of sale <b>for the seller even if the buyer is not with him</b> when the seller presents his request. In a case of this kind, <b>once this</b> buyer <b>takes possession of the land the deed is acquired wherever it is. And this is that which we learned</b> in another mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 26a): <b>Property that does not serve as a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, can be <b>acquired</b> together <b>with property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land, when the land is acquired <b>by</b> means of giving <b>money, or</b> by means of giving <b>a document, or</b> by means of taking <b>possession.</b> This shows that a bill of sale can be transferred without any act of acquisition performed for the document, and certainly through words, which presents a difficulty to Rav Ashi’s opinion.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: Acquiring a bill of sale <b>by means of</b> acquisition of land <b>is different,</b> as it is similar to acquisition through an item, not by means of words. The reason is <b>that money, which cannot be acquired through</b> symbolic <b>exchange,</b> a pro forma act of acquisition effecting the transfer of ownership of an item, nevertheless <b>can be acquired by means of land.</b>

### Part 3
This is <b>like that</b> incident <b>where Rav Pappa had</b> deposited <b>twelve thousand dinars</b> with bailees <b>in Bei Ḥozai. He transferred</b> ownership of the money in Bei Ḥozai <b>to</b> his agent <b>Rav Shmuel bar Aḥa by means of the threshold of his house.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>When</b> Rav Shmuel bar Aḥa <b>came</b> from Bei Ḥozai with the money, Rav Pappa was so happy that he was bringing him his money that he <b>went out</b> all the way <b>until Tavakh to</b> greet <b>him.</b>

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches that when one sells a ship he has sold various other items; <b>but he has not sold the slaves, nor the packing bags, nor the <i>antikei</i>.</b> But when one said to the buyer: You are purchasing the ship and all that it contains, all of these are sold as well. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>antikei</i>? Rav Pappa said:</b> It means <b>the merchandise that is on</b> the ship. This merchandise is not sold together with the ship.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who <b>sold a wagon [<i>hakkaron</i>] has not sold the mules</b> that pull the wagon. Similarly, if one <b>sold the mules, he has not sold the wagon.</b> One who <b>sold a yoke [<i>hatzemed</i>] has not sold the oxen,</b> and one who <b>sold the oxen has not sold the yoke. Rabbi Yehuda says: The</b> sum of <b>money indicates</b> what one has sold. <b>How so?</b> If the buyer <b>said to</b> the seller: <b>Sell me your yoke for two hundred dinars,</b> since <b>it is a known matter that a yoke is not</b> sold <b>for two hundred dinars</b> he clearly intended to purchase the oxen as well. <b>And the Rabbis say: The</b> sum of <b>money is not proof.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Taḥlifa, from the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Abbahu.</b> If one <b>sold a wagon, he has sold the mules</b> together with it. Rabbi Abbahu asked: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>he has not sold</b> the mules? Rav Taḥlifa <b>said to him:</b> Should <b>I erase</b> this <i>baraita</i>, as it is incorrect? Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him: No,</b> do not erase it; you should <b>explain</b> that <b>your <i>baraita</i></b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the mules <b>are fastened to</b> the wagon. In that situation, one who purchases the wagon receives the mules as well.

### Part 7
The mishna teaches: One who <b>sold a yoke has not sold the oxen;</b> and the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda disagree over whether the sum of money proves exactly what was sold. The Gemara analyzes their disagreement: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say</b> that the mishna is referring to a place <b>where they call a yoke: <i>Tzimda</i>, and</b> they call <b>oxen: <i>Bakar</i>,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that <b>he sold him a yoke</b> and <b>did not sell him</b> the <b>oxen. But</b> if the mishna is referring to a place <b>where they also call oxen: <i>Tzimda</i>,</b> then the seller <b>sold him everything.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> their dispute is <b>necessary in a place where they call a yoke: <i>Tzimda</i>, and</b> call <b>oxen: <i>Bakar</i>, but there are also</b> those <b>who call oxen: <i>Tzimda</i>.</b> Since it is unclear what is meant by the term: <i>Tzimda</i>, <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>the</b> sum of <b>money indicates</b> whether he purchased a yoke or oxen, <b>and the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>the</b> amount of <b>money does not</b> serve as <b>proof.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But if the</b> amount of <b>money does not</b> serve as <b>proof,</b> then in a case where the buyer paid two hundred dinars and received only a yoke, <b>let</b> the <b>transaction be nullified.</b>
