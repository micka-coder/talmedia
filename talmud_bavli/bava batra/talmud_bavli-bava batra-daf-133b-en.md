### Part 1
There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: My property</b> is given <b>to you, and after you, to so-and-so, and the first one was fit to inherit</b> from <b>him.</b> After <b>the first died, the second came and claimed</b> the property.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Ilish,</b> who was <b>in the presence of Rava, thought to say</b> that <b>the second also takes</b> a share of the property; he divides it with the heirs of the first. Rava <b>said to him: Judges of compromise,</b> who as a matter of course divide disputed property between the parties, <b>rule in this manner.</b> But <b>isn’t this</b> identical to the case concerning <b>which Rav Aḥa bar Rav Avya sent</b> a ruling that the second receives nothing?

### Part 3
Rav Ilish <b>was embarrassed</b> by his mistake. To comfort him, Rav <b>read</b> the following verse <b>about him: “I, the Lord, will hasten it in its time”</b> (Isaiah 60:22), as if to say: It was due to Divine Providence that I was here to correct you before your mistaken ruling was implemented.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who wrote</b> a document granting <b>his property to others</b> as a gift <b>and left his sons</b> with nothing, <b>what he did is done,</b> i.e., it takes effect; <b>but the Sages are displeased with him. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If</b> he did so because <b>his sons were not acting properly, he is remembered positively.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Do the Rabbis disagree with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> maintaining that depriving one’s children of their inheritance is inappropriate in any event, <b>or not?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Yosef ben Yo’ezer had a son who was not acting properly.</b> Yosef ben Yo’ezer <b>had a vessel [<i>illiyyata</i>]</b> full <b>of dinars,</b> and <b>he arose and consecrated it</b> to the Temple treasury, depriving his son of his inheritance. His son <b>went and married the daughter of King Yannai’s crown weaver.</b> After the son’s <b>wife gave birth, he bought her a fish [<i>binita</i>]. He tore its</b> stomach open and <b>found a pearl in it.</b> He decided to sell it.

### Part 7
His wife <b>said to him: Do not bring it to</b> the treasury of <b>the king</b> to sell it, <b>as they will take it from you for an insignificant</b> sum of <b>money.</b> Rather, <b>go bring it to the</b> Temple <b>treasurers. And do not appraise it yourself, as declaration to the Most High is equivalent to transfer to an ordinary</b> person, and if you offer to sell it for an amount less than its worth, you will not be able to change your mind. <b>Rather, let them appraise it.</b>

### Part 8
<b>He brought it</b> to the Temple treasury, and <b>they appraised it as</b> having the value of <b>thirteen vessels [<i>illiyyata</i>]</b> full <b>of dinars.</b> The treasurers <b>said to him: There are seven</b> <i>illiyyata</i> of dinars at our disposal to pay you for the pearl, but <b>there are not</b> an additional <b>six. He said to</b> the treasurers: <b>Give me</b> the <b>seven</b> in exchange for the pearl, and as for the additional <b>six</b> that you owe me, <b>they are hereby consecrated to Heaven.</b>

### Part 9
The treasurers <b>arose and wrote: Yosef ben Yo’ezer bestowed one</b> <i>illiyyata</i> to the Temple treasury, <b>and his son bestowed six. And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that they wrote: <b>Yosef ben Yo’ezer bestowed one</b> <i>illiyyata</i> to the Temple treasury, <b>and his son removed seven,</b> which he received for the pearl.

### Part 10
The Gemara infers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that they said</b> approvingly that Yosef ben Yo’ezer’s son <b>bestowed</b> seven, <b>by inference, he acted well</b> when he left him out of his inheritance. The Gemara responds: <b>On the contrary; from</b> the fact <b>that</b> according to the second account, <b>they said</b> disparagingly that he <b>removed</b> seven, <b>by inference,</b> Yosef ben Yo’ezer <b>did not act well</b> when he left him out of his inheritance, as he caused money to be removed from the Temple treasury. <b>Rather, no</b> inference is <b>to be learned from this</b> story with regard to the dilemma as to whether the Rabbis agree with the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as the two accounts contradict each other on this matter.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: <i>Shinnana</i>, do not be in a house where inheritance is transferred</b> away from its rightful heir, <b>even</b> if it is transferred <b>from a wicked son to a good son, and all the more so</b> if it is transferred <b>from a son to a daughter.</b> Evidently, the Rabbis hold that inheritance should not be transferred in any case.

### Part 12
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> There was <b>an incident involving one man whose children did not act properly. He arose and wrote</b> a document transferring all <b>his property to Yonatan ben Uzziel,</b> one of the Sages, as a gift. <b>What did Yonatan ben Uzziel do? He sold a third</b> of the property for his needs, <b>and consecrated a third</b> of the property, <b>and returned</b> the remaining <b>third to</b> the man’s <b>children.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Shammai came to</b> Yonatan ben Uzziel <b>with his staff and traveling bag</b> to protest his giving part of the property to the man’s children against the deceased’s wishes. Yonatan ben Uzziel <b>said to him: Shammai, if you can repossess</b> the property <b>that I sold</b> from the purchasers <b>and</b> the property <b>that I consecrated</b> from the Temple treasury, <b>you can repossess what I returned</b> to the man’s children as well;
