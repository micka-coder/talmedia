### Part 1
<b>Rather,</b> this is how the matter should be resolved: <b>If his mother’s father</b> came <b>from</b> the family of <b>Joseph, his mother’s mother</b> came <b>from</b> the family of <b>Yitro,</b> and <b>if his mother’s father</b> came <b>from</b> the family of <b>Yitro, his mother’s mother</b> came <b>from</b> the family of <b>Joseph,</b> so while his mother was descended from Joseph on one side and from Yitro on the other, Pinehas was a more distant relative to Yitro than Jonathan was. Based on this conclusion, the language of the verse <b>is also precise, as it is written:</b> “And Elazar, Aaron’s son, took <b>one of the daughters of Putiel”</b> (Exodus 6:25). <b>Conclude from</b> the wording of the verse that Pinehas was descended from <b>two</b> men who were referred to as Puti: Yitro and Joseph.

### Part 2
<b>Rava says: One who marries a woman needs to</b> first <b>examine her brothers</b> so that he will know in advance what character his children will have, <b>as it is stated: “And Aaron took Elisheva, the daughter of Amminadav, the sister of Nahshon”</b> (Exodus 6:23). <b>By inference from that which is stated: “The daughter of Amminadav,” do I not know that she is the sister of Nahshon,</b> as Nahshon was the son of Amminadav? <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “The sister of Nahshon”? From here</b> one learns <b>that one who marries a woman needs to examine her brothers.</b> The reason is as the Sages <b>taught: Most sons resemble the mother’s brothers.</b>

### Part 3
In connection with the Gemara’s mention of Jonathan, who served as a priest for Micah, the Gemara quotes additional statements of the Sages concerning that episode. Describing when the men from the tribe of Dan passed through Micah’s house, the verse states: <b>“And they turned aside there and said to him: Who brought you here [<i>halom</i>], and what [<i>ma</i>] are you doing in this place, and what do you have here [<i>po</i>]?”</b> (Judges 18:3). The Sages interpret their multiple questions. <b>They said to him: Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “Do not draw close to here [<i>halom</i>]”</b> (Exodus 3:5)? <b>Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “What [<i>ma</i>] is that in your hand”</b> (Exodus 4:2)? <b>Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “But as for you, stand here [<i>po</i>] with me”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27)? <b>Shall you,</b> a descendant of our teacher Moses, <b>become a priest for idol worship?</b>

### Part 4
Jonathan <b>said to them: This</b> is the tradition that <b>I received from the house of my father’s father: A person should always hire himself</b> out <b>to idol worship and not require</b> the help <b>of people</b> by receiving charity, and I took this position in order to avoid having to take charity.

### Part 5
The Gemara comments: <b>And he,</b> Jonathan, <b>thought</b> that this referred <b>to actual idol worship, but</b> that <b>is not so,</b> that was not the intent of the tradition. <b>Rather,</b> here the term <b>idol worship,</b> literally: Strange service, is referring to <b>service,</b> i.e., labor, <b>that</b> is <b>strange,</b> i.e., unsuitable, <b>for him.</b> In other words, one should be willing to perform labor that is difficult and humiliating in his eyes rather than become a recipient of charity. <b>As Rav said to Rav Kahana,</b> his student: <b>Skin a carcass in the market and take payment, but do not say: I am a great man and this matter is beneath me.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara continues its discussion of that episode. Later, <b>when</b> King <b>David saw that money was excessively precious to</b> Jonathan, <b>he appointed him</b> as director <b>of the treasuries</b> of the Temple, <b>as it is stated: “And Shebuel, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler over the treasuries”</b> (I Chronicles 26:24). The Gemara asks: <b>And was his name</b> really <b>Shebuel; but wasn’t his name Jonathan? Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> He is called Shebuel in order to allude to the fact <b>that</b> he repented and <b>returned to God [<i>shav la’el</i> ] with all his heart.</b>

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches in the list of those who inherit from and bequeath to each other: <b>Sons</b> with regard to <b>their father.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i> that sons inherit the entire estate and daughters do not receive a share along with them? <b>As it is written: “If a man dies,</b> and has no son, then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8). <b>The reason</b> the inheritance would be passed to a daughter is <b>that he has no son, but</b> if <b>he has a son,</b> the <b>son takes precedence. Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> Why not <b>say</b> the following: <b>If there is</b> only <b>a son, let</b> the <b>son inherit</b> the father’s estate; if <b>there is</b> only <b>a daughter, let</b> the <b>daughter inherit</b> the father’s estate; and if <b>there is</b> both <b>a son and a daughter, neither this one should inherit nor that one should inherit.</b>

### Part 8
Abaye asked Rav Pappa: <b>And rather,</b>
