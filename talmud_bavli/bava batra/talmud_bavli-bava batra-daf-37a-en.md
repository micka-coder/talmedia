### Part 1
The Gemara explains the inference from the statement of Rabbi Yishmael and how it clarifies the opinion of the Rabbis: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yishmael say</b> that harvesting <b>one</b> type of <b>fruit is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>for all</b> of the types of <b>fruit,</b> i.e., for the entire field? <b>Here too, these</b> trees <b>are</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>for those</b> trees, <b>and those</b> trees <b>are</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>for these</b> trees.

### Part 2
The Gemara notes two restrictions to the aforementioned ruling: <b>And this statement</b> applies specifically <b>where</b> the other twenty trees <b>did not produce</b> fruit, <b>but</b> if the other trees <b>produced</b> fruit <b>and</b> he did <b>not consume</b> their fruit, then his conduct <b>is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership with regard to the other trees. <b>And this</b> principle, that consuming the produce of some of the trees each year establishes the <b>presumption</b> of ownership for the entire field, applies only if it is the case <b>that</b> the trees <b>are scattered [<i>devazei bazuzei</i>]</b> throughout the field. Otherwise, he establishes the <b>presumption</b> of ownership only over the section where the trees are located.

### Part 3
§ In a case where there was a field with trees in it, and <b>this</b> person <b>took possession of the trees and that</b> person <b>took possession of the land, Rav Zevid says: This</b> one <b>acquired</b> the <b>trees and that</b> one <b>acquired</b> the <b>land. Rav Pappa objects to this: If</b> this is <b>so,</b> then the <b>owner</b> of the <b>trees has no</b> share <b>in the land at all. Let</b> the <b>owner</b> of the <b>land say to</b> the <b>owner</b> of the <b>trees: Uproot your trees, take</b> them, <b>and go. Rather, Rav Pappa said: This</b> one <b>acquired</b> the <b>trees and half</b> of the <b>land, and that</b> one <b>acquired half</b> of the <b>land.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara notes: It is <b>obvious</b> that if one <b>sold</b> a section of <b>land and left</b> the ownership of the <b>trees</b> in that land <b>for himself, he has</b> ownership of the <b>land</b> surrounding the trees. <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says: One who sells, sells generously,</b> and he is presumed to have included in the sale even items that were not explicitly specified, because <b>that statement</b> applies only <b>concerning</b> a case such as when one sold land and retained ownership of <b>a pit or a cistern.</b> In that case, Rabbi Akiva ruled that he does not retain any land, not even a path to access the pit or cistern, as he sold generously, including all of the land in the sale.

### Part 5
The Gemara explains the difference between the cases: That ruling applies there, <b>as</b> the pit or cistern <b>causes no harm to the land</b> surrounding them, and since the seller does not foresee a conflict arising from his pit and cistern being located adjacent to the buyer’s property, he therefore transfers the entire land. <b>But</b> in the case of his retaining the <b>trees,</b>
