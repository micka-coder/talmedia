### Part 1
<b>Rav Huna said:</b> The term: <b>From you,</b> in the document do not identify anyone in particular, and can mean <b>even: From the Exilarch, or even: From King Shapur.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rav á¸¤isda said to Rabba: Go out</b> and <b>investigate</b> this matter, <b>as tonight Rav Huna will ask this</b> question <b>of you.</b>

### Part 3
Rabba <b>went out, examined</b> the matter, <b>and discovered</b> a relevant source. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Concerning <b>a bill of divorce in which there are</b> the signatures of <b>witnesses on</b> the document <b>but there is no date</b> written <b>on it, Abba Shaul says</b> that <b>if</b> it <b>is written in it: I divorced her today,</b> it is <b>valid.</b>

### Part 4
Rabba concludes: <b>Apparently,</b> the term: <b>Today, indicates that day on which</b> the bill of divorce <b>emerges</b> in the presence of the court. <b>Here too,</b> the term: <b>From you,</b> in a promissory note <b>indicates that man from whose possession it emerges.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Abaye said to him: But</b> this is not a valid proof, as <b>perhaps Abba Shaul holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says</b> that <b>witnesses of the transmission</b> of the bill of divorce <b>effect</b> the divorce. <b>But here, let</b> there be <b>a concern for</b> the possibility of the promissory note <b>falling</b> from its rightful owner and being found by the present holder of the document.

### Part 6
Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>We are not concerned for</b> the possibility of a promissory note <b>falling</b> from its rightful owner and being found by another. <b>And from where do you say,</b> i.e., from where can it be proven, <b>that we are not concerned for</b> the possibility of a promissory note <b>falling</b> and being found by another?

### Part 7
<b>As we learned</b> in the mishna: If there are <b>two</b> people <b>who were</b> living <b>in one city, one named Yosef ben Shimon and the other</b> also <b>named Yosef ben Shimon, one cannot present a promissory note against the other,</b> as the purported debtor can claim: On the contrary, it is you who owed me money; you repaid me and I returned this note to you upon payment. <b>Nor can another,</b> third person, <b>present a promissory note against</b> either of <b>them. This</b> indicates that one of <b>them can</b> present a promissory note <b>against others. But why</b> can they do so? <b>Let</b> there be <b>a concern for</b> the possibility of the promissory note <b>falling</b> from one Yosef ben Shimon and being found by the other. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from this</b> mishna that <b>we are not concerned for</b> the possibility of the promissory note <b>falling</b> from one Yosef ben Shimon and being found by the other?

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why did <b>Abaye,</b> who is concerned for this possibility, not see a proof to the contrary from the mishna? He would counter: <b>We are not concerned for</b> the possibility of a promissory note <b>falling from one</b> particular person and being found by the other person with the same name, which is the case in the mishna, as that is extremely unlikely. <b>We are concerned for</b> the possibility of a promissory note <b>falling from</b> one of the general <b>public</b> and being found by someone else.
