### Part 1
<b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you did that?</b> Why did you kill only the males? Joab <b>said to him: As it is written: You shall blot out the males [<i>zakhar</i>] of Amalek,</b> i.e., the male descendants of Amalek, who descend from Edom. David <b>said to him: But we read</b> the verse as stating: <b>“You shall blot out the remembrance [<i>zekher</i>] of Amalek”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:19). Joab <b>said to him: I was taught to read it as <i>zakhar</i>.</b> Joab <b>went and asked his</b> childhood Bible <b>teacher.</b> Joab <b>said to him: How did you read</b> this word <b>to us?</b> The teacher <b>said to him:</b> I read it as <b><i>zekher</i>.</b> The teacher had read it the proper way, but he failed to notice that his student had learned it incorrectly.

### Part 2
Joab <b>took a sword to kill him.</b> The teacher <b>said to him: Why</b> do you want to kill me? Joab <b>said to him: As it is written: “Cursed is he who does the work of the Lord with a slack hand”</b> (Jeremiah 48:10), and you taught me incorrectly. The teacher <b>said to him: Leave that man to remain as cursed.</b> This is a sufficient punishment; there is no need to kill me. Joab <b>said to him: It is</b> also <b>written: “And cursed is he who keeps back his sword from blood”</b> (Jeremiah 48:10). <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Joab <b>killed him, and there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>he did not kill him.</b> In any event, this episode demonstrates that an error learned in one’s childhood stays with him his whole life.

### Part 3
<b>And Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a teacher of children,</b> a professional <b>tree planter, a butcher, a bloodletter, and a town scribe, all</b> these <b>are considered forewarned.</b> In other words, they need not be exhorted to perform their jobs correctly, as if they err in the performance of their duties they can be dismissed immediately. The <b>principle of the matter</b> is: With regard to <b>any</b> case <b>where loss is irreversible,</b> the individual <b>is</b> considered <b>forewarned.</b>

### Part 4
§ <b>Rav Huna said:</b> There was <b>a certain resident of an alleyway who set up a mill</b> in the alleyway and earned his living grinding grain for people. <b>And</b> subsequently <b>another resident of the alleyway came and set up</b> a mill <b>next to his. The <i>halakha</i> is that</b> the first one <b>may prevent him</b> from doing so if he wishes, <b>as he</b> can <b>say to him: You are disrupting my livelihood</b> by taking my customers.

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that a <i>baraita</i> <b>supports his</b> opinion: <b>One must distance fish traps from fish,</b> i.e., from other fish traps, <b>as far as the fish travels,</b> i.e., the distance from which the fish will travel. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> is this distance? <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says: Up to a parasang [<i>parsa</i>].</b> This indicates that one must distance himself from the place where another has established his business. The Gemara responds that this is no proof: Perhaps <b>fish are different, as they look around.</b> One fish explores the area ahead of the others, indicating to them where to go. Once they encounter the first trap they will not approach the second.

### Part 6
<b>Ravina said to Rava: Shall we say</b> that <b>Rav Huna spoke in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 60a): <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A storekeeper may not hand out toasted grain and nuts to children</b> who patronize his store, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he</b> thereby <b>accustoms them to come to him</b> at the expense of competing storekeepers. <b>And the Rabbis permit</b> doing so. This indicates that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, all forms of competition are prohibited, which would include the scenario concerning the mill.

### Part 7
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that Rav Huna holds in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. The Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Yehuda only there, as</b> the storekeeper <b>can say to</b> his competitor: If <b>I distribute walnuts, you</b> can <b>distribute almonds [<i>shiyuskei</i>]. But here,</b> with regard to a resident of an alleyway who sets up a mill in that alleyway where another mill already exists, <b>even the Rabbis concede that</b> the owner of the first mill can <b>say to him: You are disrupting my livelihood,</b> as beforehand whoever required grinding came to me, and you have provided them with another option.

### Part 8
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A man may establish a shop alongside the shop of another, and a bathhouse alongside the bathhouse of another, and</b> the other <b>cannot protest, because</b> the newcomer <b>can say to him: You operate in your</b> space, <b>and I operate in my</b> space.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: This entire matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The residents of an alleyway can compel one another</b> to agree <b>not to allow among them</b> in that alleyway <b>a tailor, a tanner, a teacher of children, nor any type of craftsman.</b> They can bar outside craftsmen from plying their trade in that alleyway. <b>But one cannot compel his neighbor,</b> i.e., one who already lives in the alleyway, to refrain from practicing a particular occupation there. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> One can <b>even compel his neighbor</b> not to conduct such work in the alleyway. Rav Huna holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says:</b> It is <b>obvious to me</b> that <b>a resident of</b> one <b>town can prevent a resident of another town</b> from establishing a similar business in the locale of the first individual. <b>But if he pays the tax of that</b> first town, <b>he cannot prevent him</b> from doing business there, as he too is considered a resident of the town. <b>The resident of an alleyway cannot prevent a resident of his alleyway</b> from practicing a particular trade there, in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis in the <i>baraita</i>, and contrary to the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.

### Part 11
With these conclusions in mind, <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a resident of</b> one <b>alleyway</b> protesting about <b>a resident of another alleyway</b> conducting business there, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? No answer was found, and the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. <b>Rav Yosef said: And Rav Huna,</b> who said that a resident of an alleyway can prevent another from setting up an additional mill, <b>concedes with regard to those who teach children that one cannot prevent</b> him from working, <b>as the Master said: Ezra instituted</b> an ordinance <b>for the Jewish people</b> requiring <b>that they establish</b> one <b>teacher alongside</b> another <b>teacher,</b> to raise the standard of teaching.

### Part 12
The Gemara challenges: <b>And let us be concerned lest</b> the teachers <b>will</b> thereby <b>come to be negligent.</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> the Sage who raised this objection:
