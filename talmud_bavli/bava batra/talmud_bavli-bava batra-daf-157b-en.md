### Part 1
<b>Rather,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? This mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: A person can transfer</b> ownership of <b>an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world.</b> Similarly, Rabbi Meir maintains that one can place a lien on property that the borrower will subsequently acquire.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yaakov from Nehar Pekod says in the name of Ravina: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 10:5): <b>Promissory notes that are antedated,</b> i.e., that are dated prior to the date on which the loan actually was given, <b>are invalid.</b> This is because the promissory note places a lien on the borrower’s property. By dating the document earlier than the loan itself, the lender appears to have a lien on property that the borrower sold prior to taking out the loan, enabling the lender to fraudulently repossess it from the buyer. <b>But</b> promissory notes <b>that are postdated are valid,</b> as this does not enable the lender to defraud a buyer.

### Part 3
The Gemara explains: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that property that the borrower acquires after receiving the loan <b>is not liened</b> even when he writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, and he <b>acquires</b> property <b>and sells</b> it to others, or when he writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, and he <b>acquires</b> property <b>and bequeaths</b> it to his heirs, <b>why,</b> then, <b>are postdated</b> promissory notes <b>valid?</b> They should be invalid, as in some instances they enable the creditor to fraudulently repossess property that is not liened, e.g., if the borrower acquires property after receiving the loan but before the date on the promissory note, and he sells it after that date. This case <b>is</b> comparable to one where the borrower writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? This mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: A person can transfer</b> ownership of <b>an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya says in the name of Rava: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to collecting a debt <b>in</b> a case of <b>enhancement of land, how</b> does it happen that the debt cannot be collected from liened property that has been sold? This question arises in a case <b>where</b> a debtor <b>sold a field to another and</b> the buyer <b>enhanced it, and a creditor came and repossessed it</b> from the buyer. <b>When</b> the buyer <b>collects</b> the value of the land from the seller, he <b>collects the principal</b> even <b>from liened property</b> that was sold to others, <b>but</b> he collects the value of <b>the enhancement</b> only <b>from unsold property.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that property that the borrower acquires after receiving the loan <b>is not liened</b> even when he writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, and he <b>acquires</b> property <b>and sells</b> it to others, or when he writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, and he <b>acquires</b> property <b>and bequeaths</b> it to his heirs, <b>why does</b> the <b>creditor collect</b> his debt by repossessing the <b>enhancement</b> from the buyer? Since the enhancement was not extant at the time of the loan, it is not liened.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? This mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: A person can transfer</b> ownership of <b>an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world.</b> The dilemma of Shmuel is raised according to the opinion of the Rabbis.

### Part 8
The Gemara comments: <b>If you say</b> that when the borrower writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, and he <b>acquires</b> property <b>and sells</b> it to others, it is not liened, and that when he writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, and he <b>acquires</b> property <b>and bequeaths</b> it to his heirs, <b>it is not liened,</b> then <b>it is not liened</b> and the following question will not arise. <b>If you say</b> that <b>it is liened, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who <b>borrowed</b> money from one lender <b>and</b> then <b>borrowed</b> money from another lender, stating in both cases that the property that he will acquire shall be liened, <b>and</b> he <b>then acquired</b> land? Does <b>the first</b> lender <b>have a lien upon</b> the property <b>or</b> does <b>the last</b> lender <b>have a lien upon</b> the property?

### Part 9
<b>Rav Naḥman said: This matter was raised before us, and</b> the Sages <b>sent</b> a response <b>from there,</b> from Eretz Yisrael: <b>The first</b> lender <b>acquires</b> the property, since his lien came first. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The lenders <b>divide</b> the property between them. <b>And so teaches Rabba bar Avuh:</b> The lenders <b>divide</b> the property between them. <b>Ravina said: The first time Rav Ashi</b> taught this matter <b>he said to us: The first</b> lender <b>acquires</b> the property. <b>The last time Rav Ashi</b> taught this matter <b>he said to us:</b> The lenders <b>divide</b> the property between them. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>they divide</b> the property between them.

### Part 10
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: With regard to collecting a debt <b>in</b> a case of <b>enhancement of land, how</b> does it occur that the debt cannot be collected from liened property that has been sold? This question arises in a case <b>where</b> one <b>sold a field to another, and</b> the buyer <b>enhanced it, and a creditor came and repossessed it</b> from the buyer. <b>When</b> the buyer <b>collects</b> the value of the land from the seller, he <b>collects the principal</b> even <b>from liened property</b> that was sold to others, <b>but</b> he collects the value of <b>the enhancement</b> only <b>from unsold property. And if it is so</b> that in general, the property is divided between the creditors, then, since both the creditor and the buyer have a lien upon the enhancement of the property, the buyer <b>should</b> collect only <b>half of</b> the value of <b>the enhancement.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean, <b>as well,</b> when <b>it teaches</b> that the buyer <b>collects</b> the enhancement? The <i>baraita</i> means that he collects <b>half of</b> the value of <b>the enhancement.</b>
