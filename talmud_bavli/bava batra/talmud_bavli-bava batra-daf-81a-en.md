refers to <b>coral trees [<i>kasita</i>]. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the other three are as follows: <b><i>Aronim</i>, <i>armonim</i>, and <i>almugim</i>. <i>Aronim</i></b> refers to <b>laurel trees [<i>arei</i>], <i>armonim</i></b> to <b>plane trees [<i>dulevei</i>],</b> and <b><i>almugim</i></b> to <b>coral trees [<i>kasita</i>].</b>

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who buys two trees in the field of another, this</b> one has <b>not acquired</b> any <b>ground,</b> but only the trees. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> He has <b>acquired</b> the <b>ground</b> under them. The mishna states a <i>halakha</i> in accordance with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>: If the trees <b>grew,</b> the owner of the field <b>may not cut down</b> their branches, despite the fact that their shade damages his field. <b>And that which grows out of the trunk</b> is <b>his,</b> i.e., it belongs to the owner of the tree, <b>but</b> that which grows <b>out of the roots</b> belongs <b>to the owner of the ground. And if</b> the trees <b>died,</b> their owner <b>has no</b> rights to the <b>ground</b> where the trees had stood.

### Part 3
If one <b>bought three</b> trees, he has <b>acquired</b> the <b>ground</b> along with them. If <b>they grew,</b> the owner of the field <b>may cut down</b> their branches, as he sold a specific piece of land along with the trees, not his entire field. <b>And that which grows out of the trunk and out of the roots</b> is <b>his,</b> i.e., it belongs to the owner of the trees. <b>And if</b> the trees <b>died,</b> the owner of the trees still <b>has</b> possession of the <b>ground,</b> as it was sold along with the trees.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:6): With regard to <b>one who buys two trees in</b> the field <b>of another, he brings</b> the first fruits <b>but does not recite</b> the passages of thanks to God that appear in the Torah (Deuteronomy 26:1–11), as the land does not belong to him and therefore he cannot state: “I have brought the first of the fruit of the land, which You, Lord, have given me” (Deuteronomy 26:10). <b>Rabbi Meir says: He brings</b> the first fruits <b>and</b> also <b>recites</b> the passage.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Rabbi Meir would obligate even one who buys fruit from the marketplace</b> to bring first fruits, not only one who grew the fruits on his own tree. <b>From where</b> did he derive this <i>halakha</i>? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> an apparently <b>superfluous mishna. Since</b> Rabbi Meir already <b>taught</b> in the mishna here <b>that</b> the owner of two trees <b>has</b> possession of the <b>ground,</b> isn’t it <b>obvious that he brings</b> first fruits <b>and recites</b> the passage? What is added by his statement in the mishna in <i>Bikkurim</i>?

### Part 6
<b>Rather, learn from</b> the mishna in <i>Bikkurim</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would obligate even one who buys fruit from the marketplace</b> to bring first fruits to the Temple. Rabbi Meir is saying that even if the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis that one who buys two trees does not own the ground between them, he still must bring the first fruits and recite the passage of thanks.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “Which you shall bring in from your land”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:2)? This verse indicates that the fruit must be the produce of your land, not land that belongs to another. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse serves <b>to exclude</b> land that is <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, which is not the land of the Jewish people. It does not exclude land that does not belong to that specific individual.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written:</b> “The choicest first fruits of <b>your land</b> you shall bring” (Exodus 23:19)? The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to exclude</b> fruit bought by a Jew that was grown on the <b>land of a gentile</b> in Eretz Yisrael. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written:</b> “I have brought the first of the fruit of the land, <b>which You,</b> Lord, <b>have given me”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:10)? If he purchased the fruit, then the land on which it grew was not given to him by God. The Gemara answers that the phrase “which You have given me” can mean <b>that You have given me money, and with that</b> money <b>I bought</b> this fruit.

### Part 9
<b>Rabba raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Shmuel from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who buys one tree in</b> the field <b>of another brings</b> first fruits <b>but does not recite</b> the passage, <b>as he did not acquire</b> any <b>land;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> This is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of Shmuel’s opinion, as he said that according to Rabbi Meir even one who simply purchases fruit is obligated to bring first fruits to the Temple.

### Part 10
Apropos the discussion of the obligation to bring first fruits of one who buys a tree in the field of another, <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim said to Rabbi Elazar:</b>
