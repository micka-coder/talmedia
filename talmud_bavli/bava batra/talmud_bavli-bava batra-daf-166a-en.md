### Part 1
The Gemara asks further: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the intent is not a dinar, but smaller coins, such as <b><i>perutot</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>People do not make <i>perutot</i> of gold.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara continues its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>, which states: If it is written: <b>Gold, in dinars,</b> the amount must be <b>no less than two silver dinars’</b> worth of <b>gold.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the document <b>is speaking</b> of <b>two golden dinars’</b> worth of <b>pieces of gold? Abaye says:</b> This interpretation is also possible, but the guiding principle in all interpretations of ambiguities is that <b>the holder of the document</b> is <b>at a disadvantage.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks a question from <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>which teaches</b> that if the document states: <b>Silver in dinars,</b> the amount must be <b>no less than two golden dinars’</b> worth of <b>silver. Why</b> is he entitled to so much? <b>Say</b> that the document <b>is speaking</b> of <b>silver</b> only, and means: <b>Two silver dinars’</b> worth of silver <b>pieces.</b> This interpretation would be a lower value than the interpretation assigned to it by the <i>baraita</i>, and would be in keeping with the principle that the holder of the document is at a disadvantage.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> in reply that the text of the <i>baraita</i> should be emended: In <b>the first clause</b> the case is <b>that</b> the scribe <b>wrote:</b> Silver in dinars, using the plural form <b><i>dinarei</i>,</b> which refers specifically to golden dinars. In <b>the latter clause,</b> the case is <b>that</b> the scribe <b>wrote:</b> Gold in dinars, using the plural form <b><i>dinarin</i>,</b> which denotes silver dinars specifically.

### Part 5
The Gemara supports its assertion that there is a difference between these two plural forms: <b>And from where do you say that</b> there is <b>a difference between</b> the words <b><i>dinarei</i> and <i>dinarin</i>?</b>

### Part 6
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Karetot</i> 8a): In the case of <b>a woman for whom there was uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>five births,</b> and likewise a woman for whom there was <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>five</b> irregular <b>discharges</b> of blood from the uterus [<i>ziva</i>], <b>she brings one offering, and</b> then <b>she may partake of</b> the meat of <b>offerings. And the remaining</b> offerings <b>are not an obligation for her.</b> If she <b>has in her</b> case <b>five definite births</b> or <b>five definite discharges of a <i>zava</i>, she brings one offering, and</b> then <b>she may partake of</b> the meat of <b>offerings. And the remaining</b> offerings <b>are an obligation for her.</b>

### Part 7
That mishna continues: There was <b>an incident where</b> the price of <b>nests,</b> i.e., pairs of birds, <b>stood in Jerusalem at golden <i>dinarei</i>,</b> as the great demand for birds for the offerings of a woman after childbirth and a <i>zava</i> led to an increase in the price. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said:</b> I take an oath by <b>this abode</b> of the Divine Presence that <b>I will not lie</b> down <b>tonight until</b> the price of nests <b>will be in <i>dinarin</i>.</b> Ultimately, <b>he entered the court and taught: A woman for whom there were five definite births</b> or <b>five definite discharges of a <i>zava</i> brings one offering, and</b> then <b>she may partake of</b> the meat of <b>offerings. And the remaining</b> offerings <b>are not an obligation for her.</b>
