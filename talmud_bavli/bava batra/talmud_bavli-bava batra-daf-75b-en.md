### Part 1
<b>and I decreed death on Adam the first</b> man, to demonstrate that he was human and not a god.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara returns to the aforementioned verse: “And the Lord will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over those who are invited to it, a cloud and smoke by day” (Isaiah 4:5). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“And over those who are invited to it”? Rabba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Jerusalem of the World-to-Come is not like Jerusalem of this world.</b> With regard to <b>Jerusalem of this world, anyone who wants to ascend</b> there can <b>ascend.</b> With regard to Jerusalem <b>of the World-to-Come, only those who are invited to it</b> can <b>ascend.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And Rabba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the <b>future, the righteous will be called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He; as it is stated: “Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him”</b> (Isaiah 43:7). This indicates that one who was created by God and causes Him glory is called by His name. <b>And Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Three were called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and they are: The righteous, and the Messiah, and Jerusalem.</b>

### Part 4
With regard to <b>the righteous, this</b> is <b>as we</b> have just <b>said.</b> With regard to <b>the Messiah,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And this is his name whereby he shall be called, the Lord is our righteousness”</b> (Jeremiah 23:6). With regard to <b>Jerusalem,</b> this is <b>as it is writ-ten: “It shall be eighteen thousand reeds round about. And the name of the city from that day shall be, the Lord is there [<i>shamma</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 48:35). <b>Do not read</b> the word as <b>“there” [<i>shamma</i>]; rather,</b> read it as: The Lord is <b>its name [<i>shemah</i>]. Rabbi Elazar says:</b> In the <b>future, the righteous will</b> have the name: <b>Holy, recited before them, as one recites before the Holy One, Blessed be He; as it is stated: “And it shall come to pass, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy”</b> (Isaiah 4:3).

### Part 5
<b>And Rabba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the <b>future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will raise Jerusalem three parasangs upward; as it is stated: “And it shall be lifted up and inhabited in its place”</b> (Zechariah 14:10). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“in its place”?</b> It means <b>equivalent to its place,</b> i.e., Jerusalem will be raised to a height whose measure in parasangs corresponds to the measure of its area in square parasangs. The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that the place</b> of Jerusalem <b>was</b> an area of <b>three</b> square <b>parasangs? Rabba said</b> that <b>a certain elder said to me: I saw the initial Jerusalem,</b> when it was still extant, <b>and</b> its area <b>was three</b> square <b>parasangs.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara continues to discuss the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>And lest you say</b> that <b>there is discomfort in ascending</b> to a place so high, <b>the verse states</b> in a prophecy depicting the return of the Jewish people to Jerusalem: <b>“Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their cotes”</b> (Isaiah 60:8). This indicates that they can easily ascend to Jerusalem, as though they were clouds or doves. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Incidentally, one can <b>learn from</b> that statement that <b>this cloud</b> mentioned in the verse <b>is three parasangs high,</b> as it reaches Jerusalem, which will be raised three parasangs.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, wished to give</b> a set <b>measure for Jerusalem, as it is stated</b> in a prophecy of Zechariah: “And I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. <b>Then I said: Where are you going? And he said to me: To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth, and what is its length”</b> (Zechariah 2:5–6).

### Part 8
<b>The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, You have created many cities in Your world for the nations of the world, and You did not give the measure of their length or the measure of their width,</b> i.e., they are not limited by any set measure, but expand as they develop. With regard to <b>Jerusalem, which has Your name in it, and Your Temple in it, and righteous people in it,</b> will <b>You give it a measure? Immediately:</b> “And, behold, the angel that spoke with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, <b>and said to him: Run, speak to this young man, saying: Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls for the multitude of men and cattle within it”</b> (Zechariah 2:7–8).

### Part 9
<b>Reish Lakish says:</b> In the <b>future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will add to Jerusalem one thousand</b> times the numerical value of <b><i>tefaf</i></b> of <b>gardens; one thousand</b> times the numerical value of <b><i>kefel</i></b> of <b>towers; one thousand</b> times the value of <b><i>litzoy</i></b> of <b>fortifications;</b> and <b>one thousand and two</b> times the value of <b><i>shilo</i></b> of <b>small houses [<i>totpera’ot</i>]. And each and every one</b> of these additions <b>will be like</b> the great city of <b>Tzippori in its prosperity.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara clarifies the size of the city of Tzippori. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said: I saw Tzippori in its prosperity, and there were one hundred and eighty thousand markets of sellers of</b> meat <b>sauces in it.</b> On this basis, one can estimate the future size of Jerusalem.

### Part 11
In a similar manner, the Gemara interprets the verse: <b>“And the side-chambers were one over another, three and thirty times”</b> (Ezekiel 41:6). <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>“Three and thirty times”? Rabbi Levi says</b> that <b>Rav Pappi says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnei: If</b> in the future <b>Jerusalem</b> will triple in size, so that it occupies <b>three</b> times its former area, then <b>each and every</b> dwelling will <b>contain thirty stories upward. If</b> the area of <b>Jerusalem</b> will be multiplied by <b>thirty, each and every</b> dwelling will <b>contain three stories above</b> every house.

### Part 12
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the mishna, which discusses the acquisition of a ship. <b>It was stated</b> that there was a dispute among <i>amora’im</i> with regard to the manner in which <b>a ship</b> is acquired. <b>Rav says: Once</b> the buyer <b>has pulled</b> the ship and moved it by <b>any amount,</b> he has <b>acquired</b> it. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> He does <b>not acquire</b> it <b>until he pulls the entire</b> ship to the extent that the end of the ship has at least reached the place previously occupied by its front.

### Part 13
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this dispute <b>is parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How</b> is an animal acquired <b>through passing?</b> If the buyer <b>grasped it by its hoof,</b> or <b>by its hair,</b> or <b>by the saddle that is on it,</b> or <b>by the load that is on it,</b> or <b>by the bit [<i>perumbiyya</i>] in its mouth,</b> or <b>by the bell on its neck,</b> he has <b>acquired it. How</b> is an animal acquired <b>through pulling?</b> If <b>he calls it and it comes, or</b> if <b>he hits it with a stick and it runs before him, once it lifts a foreleg and a hind leg</b> from where it was standing, he has <b>acquired it. Rabbi Aḥai, and some say Rabbi Aḥa, says:</b> It is not enough if the animal lifts its hooves. Rather, one does not acquire it <b>until it walks its full length,</b> i.e., it moves both of its forelegs and both of its hindlegs.

### Part 14
<b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Rav, who</b> holds that a buyer can acquire the ship even by moving it only a minimal distance, <b>states</b> his ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> that it is enough for the animal to lift two legs; <b>and Shmuel, who</b> holds that the entire ship must be moved, <b>states</b> his ruling <b>in accordance</b> with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Aḥa</b> that the animal must move its full length? The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you: I state</b> my ruling <b>even</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Aḥa,</b> since <b>Rabbi Aḥa states</b> his opinion <b>only with regard to animals, as although it lifted a foreleg and a hind leg, it stands in its place. But</b> in the case of <b>a ship, once a bit of it moves, all of it moves,</b> and therefore the buyer acquires it.

### Part 15
<b>And Shmuel</b> could <b>say: I stated</b> my ruling <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>. The first <i>tanna</i> states</b> his opinion <b>only with regard to animals, as once</b> an animal has <b>lifted a foreleg and a hind leg, the other</b> legs <b>stand</b> ready <b>to be lifted. But</b> with regard to <b>a ship, if he pulls the entire</b> ship, <b>yes,</b> he acquires it, but <b>if</b> he does <b>not</b> pull the whole ship, he does <b>not</b> acquire it.

### Part 16
The Gemara offers another suggestion: <b>Let us say</b> that the dispute of Rav and Shmuel is <b>parallel to</b> the dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A ship is acquired by pulling. Rabbi Natan says: A ship and letters,</b> i.e., the content of a promissory note, <b>are acquired by pulling</b> the document
