### Part 1
<b>What</b> is the status of a document detailing a gift that is <b>with-out specification</b> as to whether the giver desired that it be publicized? <b>Ravina says: We are not concerned</b> that it may be a concealed gift, and <b>Rav Ashi says: We are concerned. And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>we are concerned.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Any possession that is not accompanied by a claim</b> explaining how the possessor became the owner <b>is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>How so?</b> If the prior owner <b>said to</b> the possessor: <b>What are you doing in my</b> land? <b>And</b> the possessor <b>said to him</b> in response: I am in possession of the land <b>because no person ever said anything to me</b> about my being here, i.e., he states no valid claim as to why he would be the owner of the land, his mere use <b>is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership.

### Part 3
But if the possessor claimed: I am in possession of the land <b>because you sold</b> it <b>to me,</b> or: <b>Because you gave</b> it <b>to me as a gift,</b> or: Because <b>your father sold it to me,</b> or: Because <b>your father gave it to me as a gift,</b> these are valid claims to ownership. In these cases, his possession <b>is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>And one who comes</b> to claim the land <b>based on inheritance does not need a claim</b> explaining why his ancestors had a right to the land.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: Why does the mishna need to say this? Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that one cannot establish the presumption of ownership absent a claim of ownership?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: It is necessary for the mishna to state this, <b>lest you say: That man</b> had actually <b>purchased this land</b> that he possessed, <b>and he had a bill</b> of sale, <b>but it was lost. And the reason that he said</b> that he is in possession of the land because no person ever said anything to him, is that he <b>thought: If I say</b> that the prior owner <b>sold me this land,</b> the court will <b>say to me: Show</b> us <b>your bill</b> of sale. <b>Therefore,</b> being that this may be the case, <b>let us say to him: Perhaps you had a bill</b> of sale <b>and</b> it <b>was lost.</b> In a case <b>such as this,</b> one would think that <b>it is</b> a situation where the court should apply the verse: <b>“Open your mouth for the mute”</b> (Proverbs 31:8), meaning the court should advise a litigant of his possible claims, because perhaps he does not state them out of ignorance. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the court does not advance this claim on his behalf, and if he does not make the claim of his own violation, he does not establish the presumption of ownership.

### Part 6
§ The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for the discussion that follows: <b><i>Ayin</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>bet</i>.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara tells of a related incident: <b>A torrent [<i>bideka</i>]</b> of water <b>swept</b> through <b>Rav Anan’s land,</b> removing the wall which marked the boundary between his land and that of his neighbor. Rav Anan <b>went back</b> and rebuilt <b>the wall,</b> inadvertently placing it <b>in his neighbor’s land.</b> Rav Anan <b>came before Rav Naḥman</b> to ask him what he should do about it. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Go return</b> the boundary to its prior position.

### Part 8
Rav Anan replied: Why should I return the boundary? <b>But didn’t I</b> already <b>establish</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership of this land? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: In accordance with whose</b> opinion are you claiming a right to the land? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yishmael, who say: Any</b> taking of possession that is done <b>in the presence of</b> the prior owner <b>is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>immediately?</b> If so, your claim is not accepted since <b>the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with their</b> opinion.

### Part 9
Rav Anan <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>But didn’t</b> the neighbor <b>waive</b> his ownership of this land, <b>as</b> he <b>came and assisted in</b> the building of <b>the wall with me?</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Anan: <b>It</b> is <b>an erroneous waiving,</b> since <b>you yourself would not</b> have placed the wall there <b>if you had known</b> that it was the wrong location for it. <b>Just as you did not know</b> that you were building it in the wrong location, <b>so too, he did not know.</b> Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that he did not knowingly waive his ownership of his property.

### Part 10
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <b>A torrent</b> of water <b>swept</b> through <b>Rav Kahana’s field,</b> removing the wall that marked the boundary between his land and that of his neighbor. Rav Kahana <b>went back</b> and rebuilt the <b>wall,</b> inadvertently placing it <b>in land that was not his.</b>
