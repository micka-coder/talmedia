### Part 1
<b>Ameimar says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>letters are acquired by</b> merely <b>transferring</b> the document to the buyer, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar:</b> Is your ruling based on <b>a tradition or</b> on your own <b>logical reasoning?</b> Ameimar <b>said to him:</b> It is based on <b>a tradition. Rav Ashi said: It also</b> stands to <b>reason</b> that the contents of a promissory note are acquired through transferring, <b>as letters,</b> i.e., the contents of a promissory note, <b>are words,</b> i.e., the buyer is acquiring the right to a monetary obligation, not a physical item, <b>and words cannot be acquired through</b> other <b>words.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it true that documents <b>cannot</b> be acquired through words? <b>But doesn’t Rabba Bar Yitzḥak say</b> that <b>Rav says: There are two</b> types of <b>documents.</b> The first type is where one says to others: <b>Take possession of this field for so-and-so and write the document for him</b> as proof of the sale of the field. In this case, <b>he may renege with regard to the document,</b> i.e., he may change his mind and tell them not to write it. <b>But he may not renege with regard to the field,</b> as the buyer has already acquired it.

### Part 3
The second type of document is where he said: Take possession of this field for so-and-so <b>on the condition that you write him a document.</b> If the document has not yet been delivered <b>he can retract</b> his instruction <b>both with regard to the document and with regard to the field,</b> as the transfer of the field is dependent on the writing of the document.

### Part 4
<b>And Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin</b> says that <b>Rav Huna says: There are</b> actually <b>three</b> types of <b>documents. Two</b> are <b>those that we stated</b> above, and <b>the other</b> is <b>if</b> the <b>seller wrote the document in advance.</b>
