### Part 1
<b>But if</b> the creditor <b>said to</b> the debtor: I am lending the money <b>on the condition that I will collect</b> the debt <b>from whomever I wish,</b> i.e., either the debtor or the guarantor, he <b>can collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If the debtor has property</b> of his own, then <b>whether</b> in <b>this</b> case, where the creditor stipulated this condition, <b>or that</b> case, where he did not, he <b>cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And so Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel would say:</b> If there is <b>a guarantor for a woman for her marriage contract,</b> from whom the woman can collect payment of her marriage contract instead of collecting it from the husband, <b>and her husband was divorcing her,</b> the husband <b>must take a vow</b> prohibiting himself from deriving any <b>benefit from her,</b> so that he can never remarry her. This precaution is taken <b>lest</b> the couple <b>collude [<i>kenunya</i>]</b> to divorce in order to collect payment of the marriage contract <b>from this</b> guarantor’s <b>property, and</b> then the husband <b>will remarry</b> his wife.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: One who lends money to another with a guarantor cannot collect the debt from the guarantor. The Gemara at first understands that the mishna is ruling that a guarantor’s commitment is limited to when the debtor dies or flees. <b>What is the reason</b> the guarantor’s commitment is limited? <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both say</b> that the guarantor can tell the creditor: <b>You gave a man over to me,</b> to take responsibility for him if he dies or flees; <b>I have given a man</b> back <b>to you.</b> The debtor is here before you; take your money from him, and if he has nothing, suffer the loss yourself.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Naḥman objects to this: This is Persian law.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara interjects: <b>On the contrary,</b> the Persian courts <b>go after the guarantor</b> directly, without even attempting to collect the debt from the debtor himself. Why, then, did Rav Naḥman say that excusing the guarantor from payment is Persian law?

### Part 6
The Gemara clarifies Rav Naḥman’s intent: <b>Rather,</b> Rav Naḥman meant to say that this kind of ruling would be appropriate for the members of <b>a Persian court, who do not give a reason for their statements,</b> but issue rulings by whim. Rav Naḥman was saying that it is not fair or logical to excuse the guarantor and cause a loss to the creditor who was depending on him.

### Part 7
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said: What</b> does the mishna mean when it says that the creditor <b>cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor?</b> It means that he <b>cannot claim</b> payment from the <b>guarantor at the outset,</b> until after it is established that the debtor has no means to repay the debt. After the borrower defaults, the creditor can collect the debt from the guarantor.

### Part 8
<b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>who lends</b> money <b>to another with</b> the assurance of <b>a guarantor cannot claim</b> payment of the debt <b>from the guarantor at the outset,</b> rather, he must first attempt to collect the debt from the debtor. <b>But if</b> the creditor <b>said to</b> the debtor: I am lending the money <b>on the condition that I will collect</b> the debt <b>from whomever I wish,</b> he can <b>claim payment</b> of the debt <b>from the guarantor at the outset,</b> bypassing the debtor.

### Part 9
§ <b>Rav Huna said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a guarantor becomes obligated</b> to repay a loan he has guaranteed? <b>As it is written</b> that Judah reassured his father concerning the young Benjamin: <b>“I will be his guarantor; of my hand shall you request him”</b> (Genesis 43:9). This teaches that it is possible for one to act as a guarantor that an item will be returned to the giver.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Ḥisda objects to this: This</b> incident involving Benjamin is not a case of a standard guarantor, but a case of <b>an unconditional guarantee, as it is written,</b> also in the context of Benjamin, that Reuben said: <b>“Deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him back to you”</b> (Genesis 42:37). One who undertakes unconditional responsibility for a loan has a different status than a standard guarantor, as will soon be elaborated. Therefore, a biblical source has yet to be adduced to teach that one can become a standard guarantor.

### Part 11
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that the source is <b>from here: “Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; and hold him in pledge that is surety for an alien woman”</b> (Proverbs 20:16). The verse advises a creditor to take the garment of the debtor’s guarantor as payment for the loan.

### Part 12
<b>And it is stated: “My son, if you have become surety for your neighbor, if you have shaken your hands for a stranger, you have become ensnared by the words of your mouth, you have been caught by the words of your mouth. Do this now, my son, and save yourself, seeing that you have come into the hand of your neighbor: Go, humble yourself [<i>hitrappes</i>], and assemble your neighbors”</b> (Proverbs 6:1–3). This last part of the passage means: <b>If</b> your neighbor’s <b>money is in your possession,</b> as you owe it as a guarantor, <b>open up [<i>hatter</i>] the palm [<i>pissat</i>] of your hand</b> and repay him. <b>And if</b> it is <b>not</b> money that you owe him, but rather “you have become ensnared by the words of your mouth” and owe him an apology for a personal slight, <b>gather together many neighbors</b> through which to seek his forgiveness.

### Part 13
§ <b>Ameimar said:</b> The issue of <b>whether</b> or not <b>a guarantor</b> in fact <b>becomes obligated</b> to repay the loan he has guaranteed is <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei. According to Rabbi Yosei, who says</b> that <b>a transaction with inconclusive consent [<i>asmakhta</i>] effects acquisition, a guarantor becomes obligated</b> to repay the loan, whereas <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>an <i>asmakhta</i> does not effect acquisition, a guarantor</b> does <b>not become obligated</b> to repay the loan. Any obligation one undertakes that is dependent on the fulfillment of certain conditions that he does not expect will be fulfilled, in this case the debtor’s default on the loan, is considered an <i>asmakhta</i>.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar</b> that he was conflating these two issues: <b>But</b> it is <b>a daily occurrence,</b> i.e., it is taken for granted, <b>that an <i>asmakhta</i> does not effect acquisition, and</b> it is also taken for granted that <b>a guarantor becomes obligated</b> to repay the loan he has guaranteed.

### Part 15
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: Through that satisfaction that</b> the guarantor feels when the creditor <b>trusts him</b> and loans the money based on his guarantee, the guarantor <b>resolves</b> to <b>obligate himself</b> to repay the loan. Guaranteeing a loan is unlike a usual case of an obligation undertaken that is dependent on the fulfillment of certain conditions that he does not expect will be fulfilled, in which the commitment is not considered a real one. Here, the one obligating himself experiences a sense of satisfaction when the money is loaned to the debtor, and due to that, fully commits to fulfill his obligation.

### Part 16
§ The mishna teaches: <b>But if</b> the creditor <b>said</b> to the debtor: I am lending the money <b>on the condition that I will collect</b> the debt <b>from whomever I wish,</b> he can collect the debt from the guarantor. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught</b> this <b>only when the debtor has no property</b> of his own from which to repay the loan, <b>but</b> if <b>the debtor has property</b> the creditor <b>cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara questions this assertion: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If the debtor has property</b> of his own, then whether in this case, where the creditor stipulated this condition, or that case, where he did not, he <b>cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor, by inference</b> one can understand <b>that the first <i>tanna</i> maintains</b> that there <b>is no difference</b> if it is <b>like this and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> if it is <b>like that.</b> Whether or not the debtor has property from which to repay the loan, the creditor can collect the debt from the guarantor.

### Part 18
The Gemara clarifies: The mishna <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching: One who lends</b> money <b>to another with</b> the assurance of <b>a guarantor cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor</b> before first claiming the debt from the debtor. <b>But if</b> the creditor <b>said</b> to the debtor: I am lending the money <b>on the condition that I will collect</b> the debt <b>from whomever I wish,</b> he <b>can collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When the debtor has no property</b> of his own from which to repay the debt; <b>but</b> if <b>the debtor has property,</b> the creditor <b>cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a standard guarantor, <b>but</b> in the case of <b>an unconditional guarantor, even if the debtor has property</b> of his own, the creditor <b>can collect</b> the debt <b>from the unconditional guarantor.</b>
