### Part 1
<b>all these</b> components <b>are sold</b> as part of the sale of the house.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that the mishna</b> that distinguishes between different types of household items <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. As if</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, doesn’t he say</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (78b): If <b>one sold a vineyard, he has sold</b> all of <b>the utensils of the vineyard,</b> including the movable ones? The same should be true for the sale of a house.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> as a distinction can be made between the two cases. <b>There,</b> in the case of a vineyard, the reference is to utensils that are <b>fixed</b> in the vineyard and never removed from it, and therefore they are included in the sale, while <b>here,</b> in the case of a house, the mishna is referring to utensils that are <b>not fixed</b> in the house, and therefore they are not part of the sale. The Gemara objects: <b>But doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>a key in similar fashion to</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>the door,</b> indicating that <b>just as a door</b> is <b>fixed</b> in the house, <b>so too, a key</b> is <b>fixed</b> in the house? <b>Rather, it is clear</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 4
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:1): One <b>who sells a house has sold the door and the door bolt and the lock, but</b> he has <b>not</b> sold <b>the key. He has sold the mortar that was hollowed out</b> of the ground <b>but not</b> the mortar <b>that was fixed</b> to the ground after its construction. <b>He has sold the</b> immovable <b>lower millstone but not the</b> portable <b>upper stone.</b> And he has sold <b>neither the oven, nor the double stove, nor the hand mill. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The principle is that <b>any</b> item <b>attached to the ground is</b> considered <b>like the ground</b> and included in the sale.

### Part 5
<b>When</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer: I am selling you <b>it and everything that is in it, all these</b> components <b>are sold</b> along with the house. <b>Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case <b>he did not sell the pit or the cistern or the gallery,</b> as they are considered separate entities that are not at all part of the house.

### Part 6
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A duct that one hollowed out and afterward attached</b> to the ground or to a building <b>invalidates a ritual bath</b> through the water it channels to the bath. The water in a ritual bath must be gathered directly from rain or a stream, not drawn with vessels. If one hollowed out a log and used it to channel water into the bath, this is considered drawn water, as he used a vessel. By contrast, if <b>one attached it</b> first <b>and afterward hollowed it out, it does not invalidate the ritual bath.</b> Before the log was hollowed out, it was already attached to and considered part of the ground, and therefore the act of hollowing it out does not turn it into a vessel. The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is this? It appears to be <b>neither</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, nor</b> that of <b>the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara clarifies the question: To <b>which</b> opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> is this referring? <b>If we say</b> it is referring to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> in the aforementioned <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> the sale of <b>a house,</b> that any item attached to the ground is considered part of the house and is sold along with it, there is a difficulty. As <b>perhaps this is the reasoning</b> employed in the dispute with regard to the sale of a house, <b>that Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that <b>one who sells, sells generously</b> anything that is attached to the ground, <b>while the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>one who sells, sells sparingly,</b> selling only utensils that serve an intrinsic function in the house and nothing else, even if they are attached to the ground. But this teaches us nothing about the opinions of Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis with respect to a ritual bath.

### Part 8
<b>But rather,</b> the reference must be to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer concerning a beehive. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 10:7): With regard to <b>a beehive</b> attached to the ground by clay, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It is like land, and</b> therefore <b>one may write a document that prevents the Sabbatical Year from canceling an outstanding debt [<i>prosbol</i>]</b> based <b>upon it.</b> Such a document cannot be written unless the borrower owns some land, and a beehive is considered like land for this purpose.
