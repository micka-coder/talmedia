### Part 1
or: <b>You gave him to me as a gift,</b> if he then adds: Although I owe you nothing, as the slave is mine, if it is <b>your desire, take an oath</b> that he is yours <b>and take</b> him; <b>and</b> the claimant <b>takes an oath</b> that the slave is his, the one in possession of the slave <b>cannot retract</b> his offer, although he was not obligated to make the offer.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Abba <b>teaching us? We</b> already <b>learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 24a) that if one of the litigants <b>said to</b> the other: My <b>father is trusted</b> to adjudicate <b>for me,</b> or: <b>Your father is trusted</b> to adjudicate <b>for me,</b> or: These <b>three cattle herders</b> who are not experts in <i>halakha</i> <b>are trusted</b> to adjudicate <b>for me,</b> and all of the individuals this litigant mentioned are legally disqualified from serving as judges, <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that the one who stated this <b>can retract</b> his statement, <b>and the Rabbis say</b> that <b>he cannot retract</b> it, and he is obligated to have them serve as judges if the other litigant so desires. Since this <i>halakha</i> is already stated in the mishna, what novel <i>halakha</i> did Rabbi Abba teach?

### Part 3
The Gemara in tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> records a dispute between <i>amora’im</i> as to the circumstances of the case of that mishna, with one <i>amora</i> holding that the dispute pertains only to a case where the one accepting the disqualified judge will need to forgive a debt if the judge rules in accordance with his opponent, while another <i>amora</i> holds that the dispute pertains even to a case where he will need to pay the other litigant if the judge rules in accordance with his opponent. By stating his ruling in a case where the litigant will have to give the slave to the other, Rabbi Abba <b>teaches us this, that the dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis is even <b>in</b> a case where the litigant said: <b>I will give you</b> what you claim if that is the ruling of these judges, and the Rabbis hold that if he subsequently wishes to retract his suggestion, he cannot do so. <b>And</b> Rabbi Abba also teaches that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis.</b>

### Part 4
§ <b>Rabbi Abba</b> also <b>sent</b> a ruling <b>to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that the creditors of one who died <b>collect</b> the debts <b>from the</b> Canaanite <b>slaves</b> the deceased left his heirs, i.e., they take the slaves, as slaves have the same status as land in this regard. <b>And Rav Naḥman says</b> that they <b>do not collect</b> the debt by taking the slaves.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rabbi Abba</b> also <b>sent</b> a ruling <b>to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama</b> that with regard to people with a common ancestor, the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that the testimony of members of the <b>third</b> generation <b>with regard to</b> members of the <b>second</b> generation whose closest familial connection is through that ancestor is <b>valid.</b> For example, one can testify about his first cousin once removed, and is not disqualified as a relative. <b>Rava says: Even</b> the testimony of members of the third generation <b>with regard to</b> members of the <b>first</b> generation is valid; e.g., one can testify about his great-uncle.

### Part 6
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi deemed</b> one’s testimony <b>with regard to</b> his <b>father’s father valid,</b> as he considered it a case of testimony of a member of the third generation with regard to a member of the first generation, which Rava deemed valid. <b>But the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi.</b>

### Part 7
§ <b>Rabbi Abba</b> also <b>sent</b> a ruling <b>to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama</b> concerning testimony: If one <b>knew</b> information that could serve as <b>testimony about</b> the boundary of another’s <b>land before he became blind, and</b> then he <b>became blind,</b> he is <b>disqualified</b> from bearing witness in a dispute as to the boundaries of that person’s properties.

### Part 8
<b>And Shmuel said: He is fit</b> to bear witness, as it is <b>possible</b> for him <b>to determine the boundaries</b> of the fields despite his blindness. <b>But</b> he is <b>not</b> fit to identify a movable item, e.g., <b>a cloak,</b> as he cannot see it. <b>And Rav Sheshet said:</b> He can identify <b>even a cloak,</b> as it is <b>possible</b> for him <b>to determine its length and its width. But</b> he is <b>not</b> fit to identify <b>a piece of silver. And Rav Pappa said:</b> He can identify <b>even a piece of silver,</b> as it is <b>possible</b> for him <b>to determine its weight.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 3:5): If one <b>knew</b> information that could serve as <b>testimony about</b> another <b>before he became his son-in-law, and</b> then <b>he became his son-in-law,</b> thereby becoming a relative who is disqualified from bearing witness concerning him; or if he was <b>able to hear</b> at the time he witnessed an incident <b>and</b> then <b>he became deaf;</b> or if he was <b>able to see</b> at the time he witnessed an incident <b>and</b> then <b>became blind;</b> or if he was halakhically <b>competent and</b> then <b>became insane,</b> in all these cases, he is <b>disqualified</b> from bearing witness.

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But</b> if <b>he knew</b> information <b>about him</b> that could serve as <b>testimony before he became his son-in-law, and</b> then <b>he became his son-in-law, and</b> then <b>his daughter died,</b> so that they are no longer related; or if he was <b>able to hear, and</b> then <b>became deaf, and</b> then <b>again became able to hear;</b> or if he was <b>able to see, and</b> then <b>became blind, and</b> then <b>again became able to see;</b> or if he was halakhically <b>competent, and</b> then <b>became insane, and</b> then <b>again became</b> halakhically <b>competent,</b> in all these cases, he is <b>fit</b> to bear witness.

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>This is the principle: Anyone whose initial</b> state <b>or his ultimate</b> state, i.e., his state at the time of the incident or at the time of his testimony in court, <b>is</b> one of <b>disqualification</b> for bearing witness is <b>disqualified</b> from bearing witness. But any-one <b>whose initial</b> state <b>and his ultimate</b> state <b>is</b> one of <b>fitness</b> to bear witness is <b>fit</b> to bear witness, even if he was disqualified in the interim. This <i>baraita</i> clearly states that one who is blind is disqualified from bearing witness.
