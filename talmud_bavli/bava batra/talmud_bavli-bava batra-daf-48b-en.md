### Part 1
<b>in</b> a case where the seller was compelled to sell <b>an unspecified field.</b> Since he had a choice as to which field to sell, the presumption is that he sold it sincerely. <b>But in</b> a case where the one coercing him specified <b>this</b> specific <b>field</b> to be sold, the sale is <b>not</b> valid, as the seller did not decide freely on any aspect of the sale.

### Part 2
<b>And even in</b> a case where the one coercing him specified <b>this</b> specific <b>field</b> to be sold, <b>we said</b> that the sale is invalid <b>only where</b> the seller <b>did not count [<i>artzei</i>]</b> the <b>money</b> for the field, <b>but</b> if the seller <b>did count</b> the <b>money,</b> then we do <b>not</b> say that the sale is invalid.

### Part 3
<b>And we said</b> that the sale is invalid in the case of a specified field when money was not counted <b>only where</b> the seller <b>had no</b> way <b>to avoid</b> the coercion. <b>But</b> if the seller <b>had</b> a way <b>to avoid</b> the coercion and did not avoid it, then we do <b>not</b> say that the sale is invalid.

### Part 4
The Gemara concludes: <b>And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> in all of</b> these cases is that <b>the sale is valid, and</b> this is so <b>even in</b> the case of <b>a specified field.</b> This can be inferred <b>because</b> the case of <b>a woman</b> forced to accept betrothal <b>is comparable to</b> the case of <b>a specified field,</b> as a specific man is performing the betrothal, <b>and Ameimar says:</b> If a man <b>suspended</b> a woman <b>and betrothed</b> her, <b>his betrothal is valid,</b> despite the fact that she was coerced.

### Part 5
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said: In</b> the case of <b>a woman</b> who was forced to accept betrothal, the <b>betrothal is certainly not</b> valid. <b>This</b> man <b>acted improperly; consequently,</b> the Sages <b>acted improperly with him, and the Sages expropriated her betrothal from him.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> This <b>works out well</b> in a case <b>where he betrothed</b> his wife <b>with money,</b> as it is possible to say that the Sages expropriated from the possession of its owner the money used for the betrothal, resulting in a retroactive cancellation of the betrothal. But if <b>he betrothed</b> her <b>by means of sexual intercourse,</b> then <b>what is there to say?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: The Sages deemed his sexual intercourse</b> as <b>licentious sexual intercourse,</b> which does not create a bond of betrothal.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara relates: Someone named <b>Tavi suspended</b> another person named <b>Pafi on a <i>kinara</i> and</b> compelled him to <b>sell</b> his field. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana signed</b> both <b>on</b> Pafi’s preemptive <b>declaration</b> nullifying the sale (see 40b) <b>and on</b> the <b>bill of sale [<i>ashkalta</i>]. Rav Huna said:</b> The <b>one who signed on</b> the preemptive <b>declaration</b> acted <b>well</b> by <b>signing, and</b> the <b>one who signed on</b> the <b>bill of sale</b> acted <b>well</b> by <b>signing.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara challenges: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, Rav Huna’s statement is problematic. <b>If</b> the preemptive <b>declaration</b> is valid, then there is <b>no</b> place for <b>a bill of sale. And if</b> the <b>bill of sale</b> is valid, then there is <b>no</b> place for a preemptive <b>declaration.</b> How can Rav Huna commend signing on both of these mutually exclusive documents? The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is what Rav Huna <b>is saying: If</b> it were <b>not for</b> his also having signed the preemptive <b>declaration,</b> the <b>one who signed on</b> the <b>bill of sale</b> acted <b>well</b> by <b>signing.</b> In this statement, <b>Rav Huna</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rav Huna says:</b> If one was <b>suspended</b> and thereby coerced to sell a certain item <b>and he sold</b> it, <b>his sale is valid.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so</b> that Rabba bar bar Ḥana can, by means of the preemptive declaration, invalidate the bill of sale that he himself signed? <b>But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say:</b> With regard to <b>witnesses who said: Our statement</b> that we signed <b>was</b> a document of <b>trust,</b> i.e., a false promissory note given by one person to another, trusting that he will not make use of it until there is an actual loan,
