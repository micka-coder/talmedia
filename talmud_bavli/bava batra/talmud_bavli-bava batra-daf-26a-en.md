### Part 1
It must shake enough <b>that the lid [<i>nakhtema</i>]</b> positioned <b>at the mouth of a jug shakes</b> if it is placed on a wall.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>When the</b> members of the <b>household of bar Maryon, son of Ravin, would beat</b> their <b>flax, the chaff [<i>rakta</i>] would fly off and harm people.</b> Those people <b>came before Ravina</b> to complain. Ravina <b>said to them: When we say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei concedes with regard to his arrows, this statement</b> applies only <b>when</b> the damaging item <b>moves by his direct force. Here,</b> by contrast, <b>it is the wind that carries</b> the chaff.

### Part 3
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi objects to this:</b> In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> one who <b>winnows</b> on Shabbat by throwing the grain into the wind so that the chaff is blown away <b>and the wind assists him?</b> That is considered a primary category of labor on Shabbat despite the fact that the act is performed partly with the aid of the wind. The Gemara relates that the Sages <b>stated</b> this objection with regard to beating flax <b>before Mareimar.</b> Mareimar <b>said to them: This</b> case <b>is</b> the same as <b>one who winnows and the wind assists him.</b> Just as this is considered his direct force for the purposes of the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, it is likewise considered his direct force with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of damages.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Ravina,</b> who rejects this comparison and claims that flying chaff is not considered one’s arrow, in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this situation <b>different from</b> that of <b>a spark that flies from a hammer and causes damage,</b> in which case all agree <b>that</b> the one wielding the hammer <b>is liable to pay?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> it is <b>preferable for him that</b> the spark <b>go</b> as far as possible, rather than staying nearby. <b>Here</b> it is <b>not preferable for him,</b> i.e., it is immaterial to him, <b>that</b> the chaff <b>go</b> some distance.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person may not plant a tree near the field of another unless he distances it four cubits from</b> the field. This is the case <b>whether</b> he is planting <b>grapevines or any</b> kind of <b>tree.</b> If there <b>was a fence between</b> them, <b>this</b> one <b>may place,</b> i.e., plant, his grapevines or trees <b>close to the fence from here, and that</b> one <b>may place,</b> i.e., plant, his produce <b>close to the fence from there.</b>

### Part 6
If the <b>roots were spreading into</b> the field <b>of another,</b> the owner of the field <b>may dig to a depth</b> of <b>three handbreadths</b> even if he severs those roots, <b>so that</b> they do <b>not impede</b> his <b>plow.</b> If he <b>was digging a cistern</b> in that spot, or <b>a ditch, or a cave,</b> and he came upon the roots of his neighbor’s tree, <b>he may cut downward</b> normally, <b>and the wood</b> from the roots <b>is his.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught:</b> The <b>four cubits that</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> one must leave between a vineyard and a neighbor’s field are <b>for the work of the vineyard,</b> so that the owner of the vineyard does not take oxen and a plow into his neighbor’s field while working his vineyard. <b>Shmuel says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only with regard to Eretz Yisrael, but in Babylonia two cubits</b> are sufficient, as their plows are shorter. <b>This</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not plant a tree near the field of another unless he distances</b> the tree <b>two cubits from</b> the field. <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>Four cubits? Rather, is it not</b> correct that there is a difference between Eretz Yisrael and Babylonia in this regard, <b>as</b> stated <b>by Shmuel?</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that it is so.

### Part 8
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who raise</b> this matter in the form <b>of a contradiction. We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>a person may not plant a tree near the field of another unless he distances it four cubits from</b> the field. <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>two cubits</b> are sufficient? <b>Shmuel said</b> that this is <b>not difficult: Here</b> it is referring <b>to Babylonia,</b> whereas <b>there</b> it is referring <b>to Eretz Yisrael.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara relates: <b>Rava bar Rav Ḥanan had these palm trees</b> that stood <b>adjacent to the boundary of Rav Yosef’s vineyard. Birds would come and roost on the palm trees and</b> would subsequently <b>descend to the vineyard and damage it.</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Rava bar Rav Ḥanan: <b>Go</b> and <b>cut down</b> your palm trees. Rava bar Rav Ḥanan <b>said to him: But I distanced</b> them the required amount. Rav Yosef <b>said to him: This matter,</b> i.e., this specific distance, applies only <b>to trees, but a greater</b> distance <b>is required for vines.</b>

### Part 10
Rava bar Rav Ḥanan protested: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>whether</b> he is planting <b>grapevines or any</b> kind of <b>tree?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: This matter</b> applies only to the distance between one <b>tree and</b> another <b>tree, or</b> the distance between one <b>vine and</b> other <b>vines. But</b> with regard to the space between <b>a tree and vines, one requires a greater distance.</b>

### Part 11
Rava bar Rav Ḥanan <b>said to him: I</b> myself <b>will not cut them down, as Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>this palm tree that produces one <i>kav</i></b> of fruit, it is <b>prohibited to cut it down,</b> due to the verse: “You shall not destroy the trees” (Deuteronomy 20:19). <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina says: My son Shikhḥat died only because he cut down a fig tree before its time.</b> Rava bar Rav Ḥanan continued: <b>If the Master is amenable</b> to do so, he <b>may cut</b> them down, but I will not do it.

### Part 12
The Gemara further relates that <b>Rav Pappa had these palm trees</b> that stood <b>adjacent to the boundary of</b> the property of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua. He went</b> and <b>found</b> Rav Huna <b>digging and cutting his roots.</b> Rav Pappa <b>said to him: What is this?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him</b> that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: If the <b>roots were spreading into</b> the field <b>of another,</b> the owner of the field <b>may dig to a depth</b> of <b>three handbreadths</b> even if he severs those roots, <b>so that</b> they do <b>not impede</b> his <b>plow.</b>

### Part 13
Rav Pappa <b>said to him: This statement</b> applies only up to <b>three</b> handbreadths, whereas the <b>Master is digging</b> and cutting <b>more</b> than three. Rav Huna <b>said to him: I am</b> digging <b>cisterns, ditches, and caves, as we learned</b> in the mishna: If he <b>was digging a cistern, a ditch, or a cave, he may cut downward</b> normally <b>and the wood</b> from the roots <b>is his. Rav Pappa said: I told him all</b> the proofs I could find, <b>but I was unable to</b> convince <b>him</b> that I was correct,
