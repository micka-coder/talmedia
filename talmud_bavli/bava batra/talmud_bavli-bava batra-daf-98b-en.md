### Part 1
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> where he sold him aged wine, he is responsible to provide wine that will <b>continue to age,</b> i.e., maintain its quality, <b>until the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who sells a plot</b> of land <b>to another,</b> with the buyer intending to build a bridal house for his son or a widowhood home for his daughter on that plot, <b>and similarly,</b> with regard to a contractor <b>who receives a plot</b> of land <b>from another</b> under a commission <b>to build for</b> the owner on that land <b>a bridal house for his son, or a widowhood home for his daughter,</b> the terms of the transaction are a matter of dispute. The mishna presents the dispute: In the latter case, the contractor must <b>build</b> a building that is at least <b>four cubits by six</b> cubits in size, and similarly, in the case of the sale, the seller must provide a plot of land that can accommodate a building of that size; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> A structure of <b>this</b> size <b>is a cowshed,</b> and a bridal house or a widowhood home is larger than that.

### Part 3
<b>One who wants to construct a cowshed builds</b> a structure at least <b>four cubits by six</b> cubits in size.

### Part 4
The mishna delineates the standard dimensions for various other structures. <b>A small house</b> is <b>six by eight</b> cubits. <b>A large</b> house is <b>eight by ten</b> cubits. <b>A banquet hall [<i>teraklin</i>]</b> is <b>ten by ten</b> cubits. The standard <b>height</b> for each of these structures is <b>equal to</b> the sum of <b>half its length and half its width.</b> There is <b>a proof of the matter; Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The proportions are <b>like the building of the Sanctuary;</b> it was forty cubits wide and twenty cubits long and its height was thirty cubits, which is the sum of half the width and half the length.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to teach</b> specifically: <b>A bridal house for his son, and: A widowhood home for his daughter?</b> Instead, <b>let it teach: A bridal house for his son or his daughter, and a widowhood home for his son or his daughter.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It teaches us a matter in passing, that it is not the</b> proper <b>manner</b> of conduct <b>for a son-in-law to live in his father-in-law’s home.</b> Therefore, it is the father of the groom who generally provides a bridal home for the couple and the bride will return to live near her parents’ house only if she is widowed or divorced.

### Part 6
Support for this is <b>as it is written in the book of ben Sira: I have weighed everything in the pan of a balance scale and I have not found anything inferior to bran; but inferior to bran is a son-in-law who lives in his father-in-law’s house; and inferior to a son-in-law is a guest who brings in a guest; and inferior to a guest is one who answers a matter before he listens. As it is stated: “He that gives an answer before he listens, it is folly for him and a disgrace”</b> (Proverbs 18:13).

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> A structure of <b>this</b> size <b>is a cowshed.</b> And then the mishna continues: <b>One who wants to construct</b> a cowshed builds a structure at least four cubits by six cubits in size. The Gemara asks: <b>Who teaches</b> this subsequent clause about <b>a cowshed? There is</b> a Sage <b>who says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael teaches it</b> and it is an elaboration of his statement. <b>And there is</b> a Sage <b>who says</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva teaches it</b> in response to Rabbi Yishmael’s statement.

### Part 8
The Gemara elaborates: <b>There is</b> a Sage <b>who says</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva teaches it, and this</b> is what Rabbi Akiva <b>is saying: Even though</b> this structure <b>is</b> of the same dimensions as <b>a cowshed,</b> nevertheless, since there are <b>times when a person constructs his home</b> as small <b>as a cowshed,</b> a contractor has fulfilled his commission if he builds a house to such dimensions. <b>And there is</b> a Sage <b>who says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael teaches it, and this</b> is what Rabbi Yishmael <b>is saying</b> to Rabbi Akiva: The dimensions that you stated are clearly not the correct dimensions for a bridal house or widowhood home, <b>as one who wants to construct a cowshed constructs</b> a structure of <b>four cubits by six</b> cubits. A house for human dwelling is certainly larger than that.

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches: <b>A banquet hall</b> is <b>ten by ten</b> cubits. The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is a banquet hall? A pavilion of roses.</b>

### Part 10
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The standard size of <b>a <i>kanteir</i></b> is <b>twelve by twelve</b> cubits. The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is a <i>kanteir</i>?</b> It is a decorative <b>courtyard of a mansion.</b>

### Part 11
The mishna teaches: The standard <b>height</b> for each of these structures is <b>equal to</b> the sum of <b>half its length and half its width.</b> There is <b>a proof of the matter; Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The proportions are <b>like the building of the Sanctuary.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who teaches</b> the phrase: <b>Proof of the matter? There is</b> a Sage <b>who says</b> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel teaches it, and this</b> is what he <b>is saying: From where</b> can <b>a proof of the matter</b> be derived? The mishna then cites that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said</b> that <b>everything is like the building of the Sanctuary.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And there is</b> a Sage <b>who says</b> that <b>the first <i>tanna</i> teaches it, and,</b> understanding that the proof the <i>tanna</i> wished to cite was from the example of the Sanctuary, <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> interjected and <b>expressed astonishment</b> at the idea. <b>And this is what</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <b>is saying to the first <i>tanna</i>: From where</b> do you derive <b>a proof?</b> Do you derive it <b>from the building of the Sanctuary? Is that to say</b> that <b>everyone constructs</b> their buildings <b>like the building of the Sanctuary?</b> Why should they do so?

### Part 13
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> The standard <b>height of</b> each of these structures is <b>equal to</b> the length of <b>its crossbeams.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> us <b>say</b> more simply that <b>its height</b> is <b>equal to its width.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that formulating the ruling in this way is necessary, because the space inside <b>a house widens at the top,</b> as the walls get thinner toward the top and the crossbeams are actually longer than the width of the floor of the building. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that formulating it in this way is necessary <b>because there are indentations</b> in the wall into which the crossbeams are inserted. The crossbeams are consequently longer than the space inside the house.

### Part 14
§ Apropos the building of the Sanctuary, the Gemara relates the following incident: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> once <b>went out to the villages</b> to teach Torah there, and <b>he raised a contradiction between</b> two <b>verses</b> that detail the dimensions of the Sanctuary: <b>It is written: “And the house that King Solomon built for the Lord, was sixty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in width, and its height was thirty cubits”</b> (I Kings 6:2). <b>But it is</b> also <b>written: “And before the partition was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in width, and its height was twenty cubits”</b> (I Kings 6:20). The first verse states that its height was thirty cubits, whereas the second verse states that its height was only twenty cubits. <b>He said to</b> the villagers that the reason for the difference is that <b>when</b> the latter verse <b>calculated</b> the height, it did so <b>from the</b> upper <b>edge of the cherubs and upward,</b> as the cherubs themselves stood ten cubits high.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the verse <b>teaching us</b> by considering only the area above the cherubs?
