### Part 1
§ The mishna teaches (146b): If a person on his deathbed <b>reserved</b> for himself <b>any amount of land, his gift stands</b> even if he subsequently recovers. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> is meant by the term: <b>Any amount? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> This means <b>land</b> that is <b>sufficient</b> to provide <b>for his livelihood.</b> Since he reserved this land for himself, one can assume that he wished to transfer the rest of his property in any event. <b>And Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says:</b> Even if he reserved for himself <b>movable property</b> that is <b>sufficient</b> to provide <b>for his livelihood,</b> his gift is valid.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: How meticulous</b> are <b>the halakhic statements of the elders</b> Rav Yehuda and Rav Yirmeya. With regard to <b>land, what</b> is <b>the reason</b> that he must have reserved enough for his livelihood? The reason is <b>that if he recovers</b> he will <b>rely on that</b> land for his livelihood. With regard to <b>movable property as well, if he recovers</b> he will <b>rely on it</b> for his livelihood.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yosef objects to</b> Rabbi Zeira’s statement: <b>What is meticulous</b> about these statements? The statement of the <b>one who says</b> the gift is valid even if he reserved for himself <b>movable property</b> is difficult, as <b>we learn</b> in the mishna that he must leave himself <b>land.</b> The statement of the <b>one who says</b> that he must leave himself an amount <b>sufficient</b> to provide <b>for his livelihood</b> is difficult, as <b>we learn</b> in the mishna that his gift is valid if he reserved for himself <b>any amount.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>And anywhere that</b> the term <b>land is taught,</b> does it mean <b>specifically land? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:8): With regard to <b>one who writes,</b> i.e., gives via a document, <b>all of his property to his</b> Canaanite <b>slave,</b> the slave <b>has been emancipated,</b> but if he <b>reserved</b> for himself <b>any amount of land,</b> then he <b>has not been emancipated,</b> as perhaps he reserved the slave for himself as well. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: He always</b> becomes <b>a freeman</b> regardless of the wording of the document, even if the owner reserved land for himself, <b>unless it says</b> in the document: <b>All of my property is given to so-and-so my slave, except for one ten-thousandth of it,</b> as in that case it is possible that the master meant to include the slave in the portion that he is not giving away. Consequently, the slave is not emancipated.
