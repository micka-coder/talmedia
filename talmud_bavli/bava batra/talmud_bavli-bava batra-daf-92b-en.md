### Part 1
<b>If</b> this is a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>does not</b> have sufficient funds for the buyer <b>to be reimbursed by him,</b> then <b>let</b> the buyer <b>retain the ox</b> itself <b>in lieu of his money, as people say:</b> If you wish to ensure that you will get paid, <b>collect</b> even <b>bran,</b> an inferior commodity, <b>from one who is in your debt.</b> Consequently, even according to the opinion of Rav, the buyer will be likely to retain the ox. What, then, is the practical difference between the opinions of Rav and Shmuel?

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to discuss the case <b>where</b> the seller <b>does have</b> sufficient funds for the buyer <b>to be reimbursed by him.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara explains the logic of each opinion: <b>Rav says: This is a mistaken transaction,</b> as in cases of uncertainty <b>we follow the majority, and</b> since <b>the majority</b> of people <b>purchase</b> oxen <b>for plowing,</b> it is presumed that this buyer also purchased the ox for plowing. Accordingly, since the ox he received was not suitable for plowing, the sale is void. <b>And Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you: When we follow the majority,</b> that is only <b>with regard to ritual matters,</b> but <b>with regard to monetary matters,</b> such as this, we do <b>not</b> follow the majority. Accordingly, there is no basis for voiding the sale.

### Part 4
The Gemara cites <b>a mnemonic</b> that indicates the topics of the cases it will reference to challenge either Rav’s or Shmuel’s opinion: <b>Woman, and slave, ox, oxen, and produce.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav’s opinion from a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 15b): With regard to <b>a woman who was widowed or divorced,</b> and is in dispute with her husband or his heirs over the value of the payment she should receive for her marriage contract, <b>and she says:</b> When <b>you married me</b> I was <b>a virgin,</b> and so I am entitled to two hundred dinars, <b>and he says: That is not</b> the case; <b>rather,</b> when <b>I married you,</b> you were <b>a widow,</b> and so you are entitled to only one hundred dinars, then <b>if there are witnesses that she went out</b> of her father’s house to her wedding <b>with a veil [<i>hinnuma</i>] or</b> with the hair of <b>her head loose,</b> in the typical manner of virgin brides, that is considered sufficient evidence in support of her claim, and so the payment of <b>her marriage contract is two hundred</b> dinars.

### Part 6
The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that she receives two hundred dinars is <b>that there are witnesses</b> to her claim. Therefore, if <b>there were no witnesses,</b> her claim would <b>not</b> be successful. The Gemara asks: <b>But why? Let us say</b> that since there is an uncertainty, one should <b>follow</b> the <b>majority of women, and</b> since the <b>majority of women marry as virgins,</b> it should be presumed that this woman also married as a virgin. Accordingly she should be entitled to two hundred dinars. Since this is not the case, it is apparent that the majority is not followed in monetary matters.

### Part 7
<b>Ravina said:</b> In this case, one cannot decide the case based on the majority of women <b>because there is</b> room <b>to say</b> that it is so that the <b>majority of women marry as virgins and</b> only <b>a minority</b> marry <b>as widows</b> or non-virgins. <b>But</b> it is also so that there is an additional presumption: The marriage of <b>anyone who marries</b> as <b>a virgin generates publicity</b> of that fact. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> woman, who is in a dispute over the value of her marriage contract, <b>because her</b> marriage <b>did not generate publicity</b> of her marrying as a virgin, the ability to apply what is true of <b>the majority</b> of women to her case <b>is undermined.</b> Accordingly, there is no proof that the majority is not followed in monetary matters.

### Part 8
The Gemara questions this: <b>If</b> it is really true that the marriage of <b>anyone who marries</b> as <b>a virgin generates publicity</b> of that fact, then even <b>when there are witnesses</b> that she was a virgin bride, <b>what of it? From</b> the fact that <b>her</b> marriage <b>did not generate publicity</b> of her marrying as a virgin, perforce <b>they are false witnesses.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> one must modify the above argument to say that <b>the majority</b> of marriages <b>of women who marry</b> as <b>virgins generate publicity</b> of that fact, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>this</b> woman, <b>since her</b> marriage <b>did not generate publicity</b> of her having been married as a virgin, the ability to apply what is true of <b>the majority</b> of women to her case <b>is undermined.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a challenge to Shmuel’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who sells a slave to another, and</b> the slave <b>is found to be a thief or a gambler [<i>kuvyustus</i>],</b> and the buyer does not wish to have such a slave, nevertheless <b>it has come to him,</b> i.e., the slave is acquired by the one who purchased him and the transaction is nonrefundable. By contrast, if the slave is found to be <b>an armed bandit [<i>listim</i>] or</b> has been judged and <b>written</b> to be executed <b>by the govenment,</b> then the buyer can return the slave to the seller and <b>say to him: That which is yours is before you;</b> return the money I paid for him, as the sale is void.

### Part 11
The Gemara explains the proof from the <i>baraita</i>: In <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>,
