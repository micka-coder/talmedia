### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>they poured one a cup</b> of wine <b>and he said: I am hereby a nazirite</b> and therefore will refrain <b>from it, he is a</b> full-fledged <b>nazirite</b> who must observe all the <i>halakhot</i> of naziriteship. <b>An incident</b> occurred <b>with regard to a certain woman who was intoxicated</b> from wine, <b>and they poured a cup for her and she said: I am hereby a nazirite</b> and therefore will refrain <b>from it. The Sages said: This</b> woman <b>did not intend</b> to accept naziriteship <b>but</b> rather, meant <b>to say: It is hereby</b> forbidden <b>to me</b> as <b>an offering.</b> She vowed against deriving benefit from that cup alone, since she did not want to drink any more.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: Was <b>an incident</b> cited <b>to contradict</b> the previous ruling? <b>You said in the first clause</b> of the mishna that if one said that he is hereby a nazirite and therefore will refrain from a cup that was poured for him, then <b>he is a nazirite. And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>then teaches: An incident</b> occurred <b>with regard to a certain woman</b> who said: I am hereby a nazirite and therefore will refrain from it, which the Sages interpreted as a vow rendering the cup forbidden to her like an offering. <b>Apparently it is</b> only <b>with regard to this</b> cup of wine <b>that is forbidden</b> to her; <b>consequently,</b> any <b>other wine is permitted,</b> and she is not a nazirite.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>is incomplete and is teaching the following:</b> If <b>they poured a cup</b> of wine <b>for one and he said: I am hereby a nazirite</b> and therefore will refrain <b>from it, he is a nazirite. And if he is intoxicated</b> and they pour a cup of wine for him <b>and he said: I am hereby a nazirite</b> and therefore will refrain <b>from it, he is not a nazirite. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>He is</b> considered to be <b>like one who said:</b> This cup <b>is</b> forbidden <b>to me</b> like <b>an offering.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And if you would say</b> that this was his meaning, <b>let him say so</b> explicitly; why would he say: I am hereby a nazirite and therefore will refrain from it? The reason is because <b>he maintains:</b> If I specify this cup, <b>they will bring me another</b> cup <b>and aggravate me</b> with it. It is better that <b>I say to them this statement, which is definitive to them,</b> and they will understand that I do not want to drink any more wine. The mishna continues: <b>And an incident also</b> occurred <b>with regard to a certain woman</b> who was intoxicated and took this vow, and the Sages explained her statement accordingly.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one says: <b>I am hereby a nazirite on the condition that I will</b> be allowed to <b>drink wine and may become</b> ritually <b>impure from corpses,</b> i.e., he wishes to be a nazirite only with respect to the growth of his hair, <b>he is a</b> full-fledged <b>nazirite and is prohibited from</b> engaging in <b>all of the</b> behaviors forbidden to a nazirite, including consuming products of the vine and contracting impurity from a corpse.

### Part 5
If one stated a vow of naziriteship and then said: <b>I know that there is naziriteship, but I do not know that a nazirite is prohibited from wine, he is prohibited</b> in all the prohibitions of naziriteship. <b>But Rabbi Shimon permits</b> him, since he holds that naziriteship takes effect only if the person accepts all the relevant prohibitions. If one said: <b>I know that a nazirite is prohibited from wine, but I thought that the Sages</b> would <b>permit me</b> to drink wine <b>because I cannot live without wine, or:</b> I thought that the Sages would allow me to contract impurity from corpses <b>because I bury the dead, he is permitted</b> and the vow of naziriteship does not take effect, <b>but Rabbi Shimon prohibits</b> him.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> In the second case of the mishna, where one states that he did not know that the prohibitions of naziriteship include wine, Rabbi Shimon says that the naziriteship does not take effect because he did not include all of the prohibitions in his vow. The Gemara therefore asks: <b>Let Rabbi Shimon disagree</b> with the first <i>tanna</i> <b>in the first clause</b> in the mishna <b>as well,</b> where one said: I am hereby a nazirite on the condition that I may drink wine. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> In fact, <b>Rabbi Shimon disagrees even</b> with the first <i>tanna</i> <b>in the first clause</b> of the mishna, and the mishna’s statement: Rabbi Shimon permits him, is referring to both clauses.

### Part 7
<b>Ravina said: Rabbi Shimon does not disagree</b> with the first <i>tanna</i> <b>in the first clause</b> of the mishna. <b>What is the reason</b> for that? It is <b>because one was stipulating counter to that which is written in the Torah</b> by attempting to limit an explicit Torah law, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>anyone who stipulates counter to that which is written in the Torah, his stipulation is void.</b> The statement: I am hereby a nazirite, remains valid, and he is therefore a nazirite in all regards. Conversely, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> could have <b>said to you: This</b> phrase: <b>On the condition,</b> does not mean he accepts upon himself all the <i>halakhot</i> of naziriteship and then adds a stipulation counter to that which is written in the Torah; rather, it is <b>considered like</b> he said: <b>Apart</b> from. It is as though he stated from the outset that he will be a nazirite apart from one particular aspect. According to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, Rabbi Shimon holds that since he is not trying to stipulate alternative <i>halakhot</i> for full naziriteship but is instead accepting a partial naziriteship, his vow takes effect.

### Part 8
The Gemara comments: It <b>is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Nazir</i> 2:2) <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Ravina.</b> If one <b>said: I am hereby a nazirite on the condition that I will be allowed to drink wine and may become</b> ritually <b>impure from corpses, he is a nazirite and is prohibited from all of them because he stipulates counter to that which is written in the Torah, and</b> with regard to <b>anyone who stipulates counter to that which is written in the Torah, his stipulation is void.</b>

### Part 9
§ The final clause of the mishna teaches that if one says: <b>I know that a nazirite is prohibited from</b> drinking <b>wine</b> but I thought that the Sages would permit me to drink, the Rabbis say that the vow is void, but Rabbi Shimon disagrees. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you say in the earlier clause</b> of the mishna that with regard to one who says: But I did not know that a nazirite is prohibited from wine, the first <i>tanna</i> holds that he is <b>prohibited and Rabbi Shimon permits</b> him? What is the difference between the two cases? The Gemara answers: Emend the text and <b>say</b> in the final clause <b>as well: He is prohibited, and Rabbi Shimon permits</b> him. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually, do not reverse</b> the opinions, and leave the text as it is. Instead, distinguish between the two cases, as <b>there</b>
