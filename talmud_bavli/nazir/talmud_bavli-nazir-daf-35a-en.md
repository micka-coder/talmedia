### Part 1
<b>in the manner that it specified with regard to a nazirite: “From pits to grape skin”</b> (Numbers 6:4). The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, who establishes this</b> verse: <b>“From pits to grape skin”</b> (Numbers 6:4), as serving <b>to say that</b> a nazirite <b>is liable only if he eats two grape seeds and a grape skin,</b> if so <b>from where does he</b> derive <b>the detail?</b> It is unclear how he applies this method of a detail, a generalization, and a detail, as according to his interpretation, the phrase “from pits to grape skin” does not serve to limit the previous generalization but to state a different <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, who interprets</b> this by saying that a verse <b>restricts and amplifies.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> that this is a case of a detail, a generalization, and a detail. <b>As, if it should enter your mind</b> that the verse is merely teaching that <b>which was stated</b> by <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, let the Merciful One write this</b> phrase: <b>“From pits to grape skin,” alongside</b> the other <b>details</b> of wine and vinegar. <b>For what <i>halakha</i> did</b> the Torah <b>write:</b> “From pits to grape skin,” <b>after the generalization? Conclude from it that</b> you should <b>derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>by</b> means of the method of <b>a generalization and a detail.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, you can <b>say</b> that the <b>entire</b> phrase <b>comes</b> only <b>for this</b> purpose, for a generalization and a detail, and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya should not derive his <i>halakha</i>, that a nazirite is liable only if he eats two grape seeds and a grape skin, from this verse at all. The Gemara answers that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya would say: <b>If so, let</b> the Torah <b>write either two grape seeds and two grape skins,</b> with both terms in the plural, <b>or a grape seed and a grape skin,</b> with both terms in the singular. <b>For what <i>halakha</i> did the Merciful One write: “From pits to grape skin”? Learn from it</b> that one should <b>interpret it</b> in the manner of <b>a generalization and a detail, and</b> one <b>can also interpret</b> from <b>it</b> that a nazirite is liable <b>only if he eats two grape seeds and a grape skin.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Elazar, who interprets</b> by the method of <b>restriction and amplification</b> that even tendrils and the leaves of a grapevine are included in the prohibition, <b>from where does he</b> derive the method of <b>a detail, a generalization, and a detail?</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Abbahu says: He derives it from this verse,</b> which deals with a bailee: <b>“And if a man deliver to his neighbor a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep,</b> or any animal to guard, and it dies…the oath of the Lord shall be between them both” (Exodus 22:9). The phrase “a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep” is <b>a detail; “or any animal”</b> is <b>a generalization</b> that includes all animals; and in the phrase <b>“to guard”</b> the Torah <b>detailed again.</b> This is <b>a detail, and a generalization, and a detail.</b> In this case, <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail;</b> i.e., items that can be guarded.

### Part 6
<b>Rava said:</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>derives</b> the method of a detail, a generalization, and a detail <b>from this verse:</b> “And if his offering is from the flock, whether of the sheep or of the goats, for a burnt-offering, he shall offer it a male without blemish” (Leviticus 1:10). The phrase <b>“and if</b> his offering is <b>from”</b> is <b>a detail,</b> as it indicates part but not all of something, <b>“the flock”</b> is <b>a generalization</b> that includes animals that have been used sinfully, and when it stated: <b>“Sheep,” and: “Goats,”</b> the Torah has <b>detailed again.</b>

### Part 7
This is <b>a detail, and a generalization, and a detail,</b> and therefore <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail.</b> The details teach that only animals that copulated with a person may not be brought as offerings.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Yehuda of Diskarta said to Rava: And let</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>derive</b> the method of a detail, a generalization, and a detail <b>from this</b> earlier <b>verse,</b> which appears in the same chapter: “From animals, from the herd or from the flock, you shall bring your offering” (Leviticus 1:2), in the following manner: <b>“From”</b> is <b>a detail</b> that excludes an undomesticated animal; <b>“animals”</b> is <b>a generalization</b> which includes undomesticated animals (see Deuteronomy, chapter 14); and when it states: <b>“Herd,” and: “Flock,”</b> the Torah <b>has detailed again.</b> This is <b>a detail, and a generalization, and a detail,</b> and therefore <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail,</b> i.e., domesticated animals.

### Part 9
Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Yehuda of Diskarta: One <b>cannot derive</b> the method of a detail, a generalization, and a detail <b>from this</b> verse, <b>as if</b> the source were <b>from there, I would say</b> the phrase <b>“animals”</b>
