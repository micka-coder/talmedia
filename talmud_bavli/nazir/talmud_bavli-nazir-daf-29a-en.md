### Part 1
said that <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> The purpose is <b>in order to educate him in mitzvot,</b> to teach him how to observe the mitzva of naziriteship. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, even a woman as well</b> should be able to impose naziriteship on her son for educational purposes. The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish <b>holds</b> that <b>a man is obligated to educate his son in mitzvot, but a woman is not obligated to educate her son</b> in mitzvot.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who <b>said it is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>with regard to a nazirite, for that reason</b> one can understand the ruling of the mishna, which indicates that for <b>his son, yes,</b> a father can vow that he should be a nazirite, but with regard to <b>his daughter, no,</b> he cannot do so, as a <i>halakha</i> learned by tradition cannot be questioned. <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish,</b> a father should <b>even</b> be able to impose naziriteship upon <b>his daughter</b> for the sake of her education. Why does the mishna specify a son? The Gemara answers that Reish Lakish <b>holds:</b> A father <b>is obligated to educate his son,</b> whereas <b>he is not obligated to educate his daughter,</b> and for this reason he cannot vow that she should be a nazirite.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks another question: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who <b>said</b> that <b>it is a <i>halakha</i> with regard to a nazirite, this is why</b> the mishna indicates that <b>with regard to naziriteship, yes,</b> a father can impose a vow upon his son, but <b>with regard to</b> other <b>vows, no,</b> he cannot do so. <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish,</b> who says it is for the son’s education, a father should <b>even</b> be able to impose regular <b>vows</b> upon him <b>as well.</b> Why does the mishna specify naziriteship?

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: According to Reish Lakish the <i>tanna</i> of this mishna <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> as follows: <b>It is not necessary</b> to ask whether a father can impose regular <b>vows</b> of a mitzva <b>where there is no deprivation</b> of the son when he fulfills his father’s vow, <b>but even</b> with regard to <b>naziriteship, where there is deprivation</b> of his son, as the son must refrain from wine and shaving, <b>even so</b> the father <b>is obligated to educate him,</b> and therefore he can vow in this manner too.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks another question: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said it is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>with regard to a nazirite, this</b> explanation <b>is</b> consistent with <b>that which</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> If <b>he objected, or his relatives objected for him,</b> the naziriteship is canceled, as the transmitted <i>halakha</i> may be that the acquiescence of the relatives is necessary.

### Part 6
The Gemara continues its question: <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> who said that <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that this vow serves educational purposes, <b>is this</b> really <b>in the power of the relatives to say to</b> the father: <b>Do not teach him mitzvot?</b> The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish <b>holds</b> that with regard to <b>any education</b> that is <b>not important,</b> e.g., the optional mitzva of naziriteship, the son <b>is not amenable</b> to the suffering he must endure for this purpose, and therefore he or his relatives can object.

### Part 7
The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said it is a <i>halakha</i> with regard to a nazirite,</b> it is <b>due to that</b> reason that the son must <b>shave</b> all of his hair at the conclusion of his naziriteship, despite the fact that <b>he</b> thereby <b>performs the rounding</b> of the corners of his head, in violation of the prohibition: “You shall not round the corners of your heads” (Leviticus 19:27). Since a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai has the status of Torah law, a minor nazirite shaves despite this prohibition.

### Part 8
The Gemara continues its question: <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> who said that <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that the reason the vow of naziriteship takes effect is <b>in order to educate him in mitzvot,</b> and it applies only by rabbinic law, how does he explain the fact that this nazirite <b>performs the rounding</b> of the head? How does a naziriteship, which is by rabbinic law, override a Torah prohibition?

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish <b>holds</b> that <b>the rounding of the entire head</b> is prohibited only <b>by rabbinic law,</b> as the Torah itself prohibited shaving only the corners of the head, <b>and the mitzva of education</b> also applies <b>by rabbinic law. And</b> therefore the mitzva of <b>education,</b> which is <b>by rabbinic law, comes and overrides</b> the prohibition against <b>rounding</b> the head, which likewise applies <b>by rabbinic law.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara continues to ask along the same lines: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said it is a <i>halakha</i> with regard to a nazirite, this is why</b> when he <b>shaves</b> at the conclusion of his naziriteship <b>he brings an offering,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is that the minor is a nazirite in all regards, which means his offering is obligatory, like that of an adult nazirite.

### Part 11
The Gemara continues its question: <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> who said that <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that the reason is <b>in order to educate him in mitzvot,</b> the minor’s offering is not a Torah obligation, which means <b>that he brings non-sacred</b> animals <b>into the Temple courtyard</b> for slaughter. The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish <b>holds</b> that the prohibition against slaughtering <b>non-sacred</b> animals <b>in the Temple courtyard</b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>by Torah law</b> but by rabbinic law, and therefore this prohibition is disregarded due to the importance of the son’s education.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks yet another question: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said it is a <i>halakha</i> with regard to a nazirite, this is why when</b> the son <b>becomes ritually impure he brings an offering of birds, and</b> the <b>priest</b> may <b>eat</b> the bird sin-offering that was killed by means of <b>pinching,</b> nipping the neck of the bird, rather than by regular slaughter. This permits a bird to be eaten only in the case of a proper bird offering.

### Part 13
The Gemara continues its question: <b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> who said that <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that the reason the vow takes effect is to educate the son in mitzvot, in this case the priest <b>eats</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass.</b> If the son is not obligated to bring the offering, the priest will be eating a bird that was killed in a manner that does not render it fit for consumption, which means it has the status of an unslaughtered carcass.

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds <b>that slaughter of a bird is not</b> obligatory <b>by Torah law.</b> Rather, by Torah law birds are fit to be eaten no matter how they are killed, and it was the Sages who decreed that they must be slaughtered. <b>And</b> he also maintains that the prohibition against bringing <b>non-sacred</b> animals for slaughter <b>in the Temple courtyard</b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>by Torah law.</b> Consequently the rabbinic mitzva of education overrides these prohibitions, as they too are rabbinic.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yosei hold this</b> opinion? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the bird sin-offering that comes due to uncertainty is not eaten? The verse states: “And they who have an issue, whether a male or a female”</b> (Leviticus 15:33), which <b>juxtaposes a female to a male: Just as a male brings an offering for a definite</b> sin, i.e., for a transgression he is sure he committed inadvertently, <b>so too, a female brings an offering for a definite</b> sin. <b>And just as a male brings</b> a provisional guilt-offering <b>for</b> his <b>uncertain</b> transgression, <b>so too, a female brings</b> an offering <b>for</b> her case of <b>uncertainty.</b>

### Part 16
<b>And</b> furthermore: <b>Just as a male brings</b> an animal <b>for</b> his <b>uncertain</b> transgression, a ram as a guilt-offering, <b>from</b> the same <b>type from</b> which <b>he brings a definite</b> sin-offering, an animal sin-offering, <b>so too, a female brings</b> the same type <b>for her</b> case of <b>uncertainty from</b> the same <b>type from</b> which <b>she brings for a definite</b> offering, i.e., a bird if she is a <i>zava</i> or gave birth. This leads to the following question: <b>If</b> so, one can continue this line of thought: <b>Just as a male brings an offering and</b> it <b>is eaten, so too, a female brings an offering and</b> it should be <b>eaten</b> when she sacrifices an offering for uncertain childbirth. With regard to this case <b>you say:</b>
