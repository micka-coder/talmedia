at <b>the roots of their hair.</b> You can <b>learn from it that</b> hair <b>grows from the bottom,</b> as the new hair is not dyed. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that it is so.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what about <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a nazirite who was shaved by bandits, and they left him</b> with <b>enough</b> hair <b>to bend its end to its root,</b> this <b>does not negate</b> the days of his naziriteship. <b>And if it should enter your mind</b> that hair <b>grows from the bottom, let</b> it <b>negate</b> the days of his naziriteship in that case as well, as the remaining hair grew only after his acceptance of naziriteship. The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <b>where they shaved him after the completion</b> of his naziriteship but before he sacrificed his offerings, <b>and whose</b> opinion is expressed in this <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> nazirite who became ritually impure <b>after the completion</b> of his term, this <b>negates</b> only <b>seven</b> days.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> The Gemara answers: He <b>derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the shaving of ritual purity</b> at the end of his term of naziriteship (see Numbers 6:18) <b>from the shaving of impurity</b> (see Numbers 6:9): <b>Just as</b> with the <b>shaving of impurity,</b> if he became impure on the day of the completion of his term he must wait <b>seven</b> days, at which point he is purified from the impurity imparted by a corpse and shaves his hair, <b>so too</b> with the <b>shaving of purity;</b> if he was shaved before he brought his offerings, he negates only <b>seven</b> days.

### Part 4
<b>And the Sages,</b> including Rabbi Eliezer, <b>have an</b> accepted <b>tradition</b> that <b>every seven days hair grows enough to bend its end to its root.</b> Consequently, if this amount of hair remained after he was shaved on the day of the completion of his naziriteship, he does not forfeit any days and need not wait any longer.

### Part 5
§ The mishna taught: With regard to <b>a nazirite who shaved</b> his hair, <b>whether</b> he did so <b>with scissors or with a razor, or</b> if he <b>pulled out any amount,</b> he is <b>liable. The Sages taught:</b> The Torah states with regard to a nazirite: <b>“A razor</b> shall not come upon his head” (Numbers 6:5). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only a razor; from where</b> do I derive that he is liable if he <b>tore out, uprooted,</b> or <b>pulled out any amount of</b> his hair? <b>The verse states: “He shall be holy, he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long”</b> (Numbers 6:5). This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yonatan says</b> a different interpretation: From <b>“razor” I have</b> derived <b>only a razor,</b> whereas if he <b>tore out, uprooted,</b> or <b>pulled out any amount</b> of his hair, <b>he is exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “He shall be holy”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That is to say that if he shaved</b> his hair <b>with a razor he stands</b> liable <b>for</b> violating both <b>a positive mitzva and a prohibition.</b> By shaving with a razor he also transgresses the positive mitzva of: “He shall be holy, he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long” (Numbers 6:5).

### Part 7
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: From <b>“razor” I have</b> derived <b>only a razor; from where</b> do I derive that he is also liable if he <b>tore out, uprooted,</b> or <b>pulled out any amount of</b> it? <b>The verse states:</b> “A razor <b>shall not come upon his head”</b> (Numbers 6:5), indicating that he may not remove his hair in any manner. The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And since we eventually include everything</b> that removes hair, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “A razor shall not come upon his head”?</b> Why does the verse mention a razor, when other implements are equally forbidden?

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> answers: It is <b>because we have not learned that the last shaving,</b> i.e., the nazirite’s shaving of ritual purity, <b>must be</b> performed specifically <b>with a razor,</b> as the verse merely states: “He shall shave his head” (Numbers 6:18), without specifying an implement. <b>It is impossible to learn</b> this requirement <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a leper</b> must use a razor (see Leviticus 14:9),
