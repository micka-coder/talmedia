### Part 1
These two <i>amora’im</i> have a similar dispute in the case of one who contracted leprosy during his naziriteship and <b>became impure</b> by coming into contact with corpse <b>during the days of his leprosy.</b> Although the days of his leprosy do not negate the previous days of his naziriteship, they are not counted as part of his naziriteship either. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Contraction of impurity from a corpse <b>negates</b> the days of naziriteship observed before his leprosy, which means he must start counting afresh once he is purified of leprosy. <b>Reish Lakish says: It does not negate</b> the days he has observed, and he need observe only the remaining days of his naziriteship after his purification.

### Part 2
The Gemara clarifies their respective approaches. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> the impurity from a corpse <b>negates</b> the days he already observed, <b>since he remains in</b> a period of <b>naziriteship</b> even when he is a leper, as his leprosy does not negate his naziriteship. <b>Reish Lakish says it does not negate</b> the days he observed, since he maintains that <b>leprosy is discrete and naziriteship is discrete.</b> One’s time as a leper is not considered part of his naziriteship.

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this dispute in both cases. <b>As, if it were stated in this first one,</b> with regard to one who became impure during his term of naziriteship for the birth of his son, one might say that it is specifically <b>in that</b> case that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said it</b> also <b>negates</b> the days of his standard naziriteship because <b>there is one label of naziriteship</b> that applies to both vows, <b>but in this</b> case, where the leper became impure from a corpse, one might <b>say he concedes to Reish Lakish</b> that it does not negate the days of his naziriteship that he has counted, <b>since a nazirite is discrete and leprosy is discrete.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if it were stated</b> only <b>in this</b> case, that of the leper who contracted impurity from a corpse, one might say that it is only <b>in this</b> case that <b>Reish Lakish said</b> it does not negate his days of naziriteship, <b>but in that</b> case, where one became impure while observing the term of naziriteship for his son, one might <b>say he concedes to Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that it negates the entire period, since they are all days of naziriteship. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for the dispute to be taught in both cases.

### Part 5
In connection with the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, the Gemara discusses the case of a nazirite <b>who became impure on the day of</b> his <b>hair growth.</b> The case is that of one who contracted leprosy during his naziriteship and then was purified from his condition and shaved, as required of him. At this point he must wait another thirty days so that his hair can grow enough for him to shave it for the end of his naziriteship. If he became impure during this additional period, <b>Rav said: It does not negate</b> the days he previously counted for his naziriteship. The Gemara explains: <b>Even according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says</b> that if one became impure during the days of the term of naziriteship for his son it <b>negates</b> the entire period, <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>where he</b> still <b>remains in</b> a period of <b>naziriteship,</b> but the time of <b>hair growth is an addition to</b> his period of <b>naziriteship</b> and is not considered part of the term itself.

### Part 6
<b>And Shmuel said:</b> It <b>negates</b> the earlier days. The Gemara explains: <b>Even according to Reish Lakish, who says</b> that becoming impure during the naziriteship for his son <b>does not negate</b> the days of his naziriteship, <b>there</b> it is referring to a case of <b>two</b> distinct terms of <b>naziriteship,</b> a standard one for himself and another for his son. But <b>here</b> it is <b>one naziriteship,</b> since the days he observes for the growth of his hair complete his naziriteship.

### Part 7
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda said: All concede that if the hair was consecrated</b> during the sprinkling <b>of the blood, he has no</b> means of <b>remedy.</b> That is, if the nazirite had completed his term and brought his offerings, and the blood of the offerings was sprinkled, and he then became impure before shaving, he has no way to shave or to render wine permitted to himself. It has not been permitted through the offerings he brought because he has become impure, and he cannot bring other offerings for this purpose since one may not bring two sets of offerings for the same term of naziriteship.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Rav Ḥisda state this <i>halakha</i>? <b>If</b> one says that it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> this cannot be, <b>since</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said</b> that <b>shaving is indispensable</b> to the completion of naziriteship. The impurity <b>is</b> therefore contracted <b>within the full term</b> of his naziriteship, in which case it would not make sense that he has no remedy; <b>but let</b> it instead <b>negate</b> his days of naziriteship, and he will observe them again, after which he will shave. <b>Rather,</b> perhaps Rav Ḥisda spoke <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis; didn’t they say</b> that <b>shaving is not indispensable</b> to the completion of naziriteship, which means his impurity occurred when he was no longer a nazirite? The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> Rav Ḥisda ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis, and what</b> is the meaning of: <b>He has no</b> means of <b>remedy?</b> It means: <b>He has no</b> means of <b>remedy for the mitzva of shaving,</b> i.e., he cannot fulfill the mitzva of shaving in purity as required.

### Part 9
§ <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: A nazirite whose days</b> of naziriteship <b>are completed</b> but who has yet to bring his offerings <b>is flogged for the</b> contracting of <b>impurity</b> if he becomes impure from a corpse, like any nazirite who becomes impure, <b>but he is not flogged for the</b> act of <b>shaving, nor for the</b> drinking of <b>wine.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> with regard to <b>impurity that he is flogged</b> for it? It is <b>as the verse states: “All the days that he has consecrated himself unto the Lord</b> he shall not come near to a dead body” (Numbers 6:6). The additional word “all” comes <b>to include</b> the <b>days after the completion</b> of his naziriteship and teaches that they are <b>like the days before</b> its <b>completion</b> with regard to the prohibition against contracting impurity from the dead. Therefore, he is liable to receive lashes.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let him also be liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for shaving, since the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“All the days of his vow of naziriteship there shall no razor come upon his head”</b> (Numbers 6:5). Here too, the word “all” should <b>render</b> the <b>days after</b> the <b>completion</b> of his naziriteship <b>like the days before</b> its <b>completion. And furthermore,</b> with regard to wine as well, the verse states: <b>“All the days of his naziriteship, from anything that is made of the grapevine,</b> from the pressed grapes even to the grapestone, he shall not eat” (Numbers 6:4). Once again, the word “all” should <b>render</b> the <b>days after</b> the <b>completion</b> of his naziriteship <b>like the days before</b> its <b>completion</b> with regard to drinking wine. What is the reason for the difference in <i>halakha</i> between contracting impurity on the one hand, and shaving and drinking wine on the other?
