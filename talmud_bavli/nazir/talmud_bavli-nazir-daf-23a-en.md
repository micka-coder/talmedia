### Part 1
<b>And the mishna</b> is referring to a case <b>where he said to her</b> in the form of a question: <b>I am hereby a nazirite, and what</b> about <b>you?</b> This indicates that he himself has completely accepted his naziriteship, and he is simply asking his wife if she would like to join him. <b>Due to that</b> reason, as he did not link his vow to hers, <b>he may nullify hers and his is intact.</b>

### Part 2
mishna With regard to <b>a woman who vowed to be a nazirite, and</b> she transgressed her vow since <b>she was drinking wine and rendering herself ritually impure by</b> contact with <b>the dead, she incurs the forty</b> lashes for each of the Torah prohibitions she transgressed. If <b>her husband nullified her</b> vow, <b>and she did not know that her husband had nullified her</b> vow, <b>and she was drinking wine and rendering herself impure by</b> contact with <b>the dead, she does not incur the forty</b> lashes, as she is no longer a nazirite. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Even <b>if she does not incur the forty</b> lashes by Torah law, <b>she should incur lashes for rebelliousness [<i>makat mardut</i>],</b> an extrajudicial punishment imposed by the Sages, for her intention to commit a transgression, since she believed that it was prohibited to her.

### Part 3
gemara <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to a verse in the section discussing vows: <b>“Her husband has nullified them, and the Lord will forgive her”</b> (Numbers 30:13), that <b>the verse is speaking of a woman whose husband nullified her</b> vow <b>and she did not know</b> that he had done so. It teaches <b>that</b> if she performs the actions prohibited by the vow <b>she requires atonement and forgiveness.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And when Rabbi Akiva would reach this verse he would cry,</b> saying: <b>And if one who intended to pick up pork in his hand</b> and eat it, <b>and</b> in fact <b>he picked up the meat of a lamb in his hand</b> and ate it, so that he did not in fact commit a transgression, like this woman who tried to sin and was unaware that her husband had nullified her vow, nevertheless <b>requires atonement and forgiveness,</b> then with regard to <b>one who intends to pick up pork in his hand and</b> in fact <b>picked up pork in his hand, all the more so</b> does he require atonement.

### Part 5
<b>On a similar note, you</b> can <b>say</b> and quote the following verse with regard to one who is liable to bring an uncertain guilt-offering, which is brought for a possible transgression: <b>“Though he does not know it yet he is guilty, and shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:17).

### Part 6
This verse teaches: <b>And if</b> in a case similar to <b>one who intended to pick up the meat of a lamb in his hand</b> and eat it, which is permitted, <b>and he picked up pork in his hand</b> and ate it, thereby sinning unintentionally, <b>for example,</b> where one took <b>a piece</b> of meat with regard to which it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it is permitted <b>fat</b> and <b>uncertain</b> whether it is forbidden <b>fat,</b> and he ate it, rendering him liable to bring a provisional guilt-offering, <b>the verse states: “And shall bear his iniquity,”</b> indicating that he requires atonement via an offering; then with regard to <b>one who intends to pick up pork in his hand and</b> in fact <b>picked up pork in his hand, all the more so</b> he requires atonement.

### Part 7
<b>Isi ben Yehuda says</b> that this verse: <b>“Though he does not know it yet he is guilty, and shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:17), should be explained in a slightly different manner: <b>And if</b> in a case similar to <b>one who intended to pick up the meat of a lamb in his hand and he picked up pork in his hand, e.g.,</b> where there were <b>two pieces</b> before him, <b>one of</b> forbidden <b>fat and one of</b> permitted <b>fat,</b> and he picked up one and ate it without knowing which of them was forbidden, it states with regard to him: <b>“And shall bear his iniquity,”</b> i.e., he is obligated to bring an offering; then with regard to <b>one who intends to pick up pork in his hand and picked up pork in his hand, all the more so</b> is he in need of atonement.

### Part 8
The Gemara adds: <b>And with regard to this matter, those who suffer should suffer,</b> i.e., one can see from here the extent to which one requires atonement and forgiveness.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>all these</b> examples for the same idea? The Gemara answers: All of them <b>are necessary, as had we taught</b> this idea only <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>a woman,</b> one might have said that <b>it is there that she requires atonement and forgiveness because at the outset her intention was to sin. However,</b> in the case of one who took <b>a piece</b> with regard to which it was <b>uncertain</b> whether it was permitted <b>fat</b> and <b>uncertain</b> whether it was forbidden <b>fat, who intended</b> to eat <b>permitted</b> food, one might have said that <b>he does not require atonement and forgiveness.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And had this</b> case concerning one who eats a piece that might be forbidden <b>been stated</b> alone, one could say that atonement is required in this situation, <b>as there is</b> possibly <b>a prohibition</b> present before him. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a woman whose husband nullified her</b> vow, <b>where</b> she was in fact <b>permitted</b> to perform the actions she performed, perhaps <b>she does not require atonement and forgiveness.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And had</b> only <b>these two</b> cases <b>been stated, I would say: It is</b> in <b>these two</b> cases in <b>which atonement and forgiveness are enough for them, as the prohibition is not established;</b> even one who ate the piece that was possibly forbidden fat has not necessarily committed a sin. <b>However,</b> if there were <b>two pieces, one of</b> forbidden <b>fat and one of</b> permitted <b>fat, where the prohibition is established,</b> as there was definitely a forbidden piece before him and nevertheless he proceeded to eat one of them, one might have said that <b>atonement and forgiveness should not suffice for him.</b> Isi ben Yehuda therefore <b>teaches us that</b> there, it <b>is no different,</b> as even this individual is included in the verse: “And he shall be forgiven” (Leviticus 5:18).

### Part 12
§ <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥanna said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For the paths of the Lord are right, and the just walk in them, but transgressors stumble over them”</b> (Hosea 14:10)? How can the same path lead to such different outcomes? This is <b>comparable to two people who roasted their Paschal offerings</b> on Passover eve, in the proper manner. <b>One ate it for the sake of the mitzva, and one ate it for the sake of excessive eating. This</b> one, <b>who ate it for the sake of the mitzva,</b> has fulfilled: <b>“And the just walk in them,” while that</b> one, <b>who ate it for the sake of excessive eating,</b> is described by the end of the verse: <b>“But transgressors stumble over them.”</b>

### Part 13
<b>Reish Lakish said to</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥanna: <b>You call this</b> individual <b>wicked?</b> Even <b>though he had not performed the mitzva in the optimal manner</b> when he eats this Paschal offering, <b>he has at least performed</b> the mitzva of the <b>Paschal offering. Rather,</b> this is <b>comparable to two people; this</b> one has <b>his wife and sister</b> in the same house <b>with him, and that</b> one has <b>his wife and sister with him.</b> Each husband arrives home and engages in sexual intercourse with one of the women. <b>This</b> one <b>happened upon his wife, and that</b> one <b>happened upon his sister. This</b> one, <b>who happened upon his wife,</b> is described by the phrase <b>“And the just walk in them,” and that</b> one, <b>who happened upon his sister,</b> is described by the phrase <b>“But transgressors stumble over them.”</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Is it comparable? We said one path;</b> i.e., two people follow the same path by performing the very same action with two different outcomes; whereas <b>here</b> there are <b>two paths.</b> Each person engaged in sexual intercourse with a different relative and therefore they cannot be said to have followed the same path. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>comparable to Lot and his two daughters,</b> who were <b>with him. They, who intended</b> to engage in sexual intercourse with him <b>for the sake of a mitzva,</b> as they thought that the entire world was destroyed and wished to preserve the human race, are described in the first part of the verse: <b>“And the just walk in them.” He who intended</b> to act <b>for the sake of a transgression</b> is described by the last part: <b>“But transgressors stumble over them.”</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And perhaps</b> Lot <b>too intended</b> that his actions should be <b>for the sake of a mitzva?</b> The Gemara answers: This was not the case, as <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> with regard to Lot: <b>This entire verse:</b> “And Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere” (Genesis 13:10), <b>is stated with regard to</b> the <b>sin</b> of licentiousness. Since this verse teaches that Lot was a lustful man, it can therefore be assumed he meant to sin with his daughters as well.

### Part 16
Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: <b>“And Lot lifted up</b> his eyes” employs the same expression as a verse that refers to Joseph’s temptation: <b>“That his master’s wife lifted up her eyes”</b> (Genesis 39:7), which is clearly referring to sin. The phrase used in reference to Lot, <b>“his eyes,”</b> is stated similarly to Samson’s appraisal of the Philistine girl he sought to marry: <b>“For she is pleasing in my eyes”</b> (Judges 14:3).

### Part 17
Rabbi Yoḥanan continues to interpret the verse as a series of references to licentiousness. The phrase <b>“and saw”</b> is reminiscent of the verse dealing with Jacob’s daughter Dinah: <b>“And Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, saw her</b> and he took her, and lay with her” (Genesis 34:2). The verse continues: <b>“All the plain [<i>kikar</i>] of the Jordan,”</b> which alludes to the verse: <b>“For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf [<i>kikar</i>] of bread”</b> (Proverbs 6:26). The last part of the verse: <b>“That it was well watered everywhere,”</b> recalls: <b>“I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink”</b> (Hosea 2:7).

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> Lot <b>was forced</b> to participate in the sexual intercourse, as he was asleep at the time; how can he be considered a sinner? The Gemara answers that this is as a Sage <b>taught in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Rav Ḥoni: Why is there a dot</b> in a Torah scroll <b>over</b> the letter <b><i>vav</i> of</b> the word <b>“<i>uvekumah</i>,” with regard to</b> Lot’s <b>elder</b> daughter, in the verse: “And he did not know when she lay down and when she arose [<i>uvekumah</i>]” (Genesis 19:33)? This dot serves <b>to say that when she lay down he did not know; however, when she arose he knew</b> what she had done, as he later understood what had happened.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>And what could he have done</b> about it? <b>What has happened has happened;</b> i.e., Lot could not change the past. The Gemara answers: The <b>difference</b> is <b>that on the other,</b> following, <b>night, he should not have drunk wine</b> again. By allowing himself to get drunk a second time, he showed that the end result, engaging in sexual intercourse with his younger daughter, was something he desired.

### Part 20
§ <b>Rava interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically</b> with regard to Lot: <b>What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city,</b>
