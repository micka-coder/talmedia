### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one on whose behalf the blood of one</b> of his nazirite offerings <b>was sprinkled</b> on the altar, <b>and he became ritually impure</b> before bringing the rest of his offerings, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> His impurity <b>negates the entire</b> tally, and he remains a nazirite. <b>And the Rabbis say: Let him bring the rest of his offerings and be purified.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>An incident</b> occurred <b>involving Miriam of Tarmod</b> who was a nazirite, <b>that the blood of one</b> of her offerings <b>was sprinkled on her behalf, and they came and told her that her daughter was mortally ill. And she went and found</b> that her daughter <b>was dead,</b> and thereby contracted impurity. <b>And the Rabbis said: Let her bring the rest of her offerings and be purified.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It <b>is taught</b> in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that this <b>negates the entire</b> tally. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Eliezer say</b> (16b): With regard to <b>any</b> nazirite who became ritually impure <b>after the completion</b> of his term, this <b>negates</b> only <b>seven days. Rav said: What</b> does: <b>Negates, that Rabbi Eliezer said</b> in the mishna here mean? It means that his impurity <b>negates</b> all <b>his offerings.</b> Rabbi Eliezer did not mean that the nazirite must count his entire term of naziriteship afresh; rather, he must bring all his offerings a second time, including the one whose blood was sprinkled before he became impure.

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that this is the meaning of Rabbi Eliezer’s statement, <b>as</b> the mishna later <b>teaches: And the Rabbis said: Let her bring the rest of her offerings and be purified. Learn from here</b> that they disagree only with regard to the offerings, but not the naziriteship itself.

### Part 4
The Gemara cites the rest of the mishna, which also indicates that the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree with regard to the offerings. <b>And an incident also</b> occurred <b>involving Miriam of Tarmod, that the blood of one</b> of her offerings <b>was sprinkled on her behalf, and they came and notified her that her daughter was mortally ill. And she went and found</b> that her daughter <b>was dead,</b> and thereby contracted impurity. <b>And the Rabbis said: Let her bring the rest of her offerings and be purified.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from</b> the mishna that this is so.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A High Priest and a nazirite may not become ritually impure</b> even <b>to</b> bury <b>their</b> deceased <b>relatives. However, they become impure to</b> bury <b>a corpse with no one to bury it [<i>met mitzva</i>].</b> If one of them comes across the corpse of a Jew, and there is nobody else available to bury it, he must bury the body. If a High Priest and a nazirite <b>were walking along the way and they found a <i>met mitzva</i>,</b> and one of them can tend to the burial by himself, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Let</b> the <b>High Priest become impure, and</b> do <b>not let</b> the <b>nazirite become impure. And the Rabbis say: Let</b> the <b>nazirite become impure, and</b> do <b>not let</b> even <b>a common priest become impure.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to</b> the Rabbis: It is preferable to <b>let</b> the <b>priest become impure, as he does not bring an offering for his impurity, and</b> do <b>not let</b> the <b>nazirite become impure, as he brings an offering for his impurity.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> On the contrary, <b>let</b> the <b>nazirite become impure, as his sanctity is not permanent, and</b> do <b>not let a priest become impure, as his sanctity is permanent.</b>

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> In light of the mishna’s dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis, the Gemara compares the status of various individuals. <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>a High Priest and a nazirite,</b> one can explain the dispute as follows. <b>This</b> Sage, the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that it is <b>preferable</b> that <b>a High Priest</b> remain ritually pure, as his sanctity is permanent. <b>And this</b> Sage, Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that it is <b>preferable</b> that <b>a nazirite</b> remain ritually pure, as he is obligated to bring an offering for his impurity.

### Part 9
Additionally, if the two walking together were a High Priest <b>anointed with the anointing oil,</b> as was performed during the First Temple period,
