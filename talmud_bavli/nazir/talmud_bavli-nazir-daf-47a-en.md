### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one on whose behalf the blood of one</b> of his nazirite offerings <b>was sprinkled</b> on the altar, <b>and he became ritually impure</b> before bringing the rest of his offerings, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> His impurity <b>negates the entire</b> tally, and he remains a nazirite. <b>And the Rabbis say: Let him bring the rest of his offerings and be purified.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>An incident</b> occurred <b>involving Miriam of Tarmod</b> who was a nazirite, <b>that the blood of one</b> of her offerings <b>was sprinkled on her behalf, and they came and told her that her daughter was mortally ill. And she went and found</b> that her daughter <b>was dead,</b> and thereby contracted impurity. <b>And the Rabbis said: Let her bring the rest of her offerings and be purified.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It <b>is taught</b> in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that this <b>negates the entire</b> tally. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Eliezer say</b> (16b): With regard to <b>any</b> nazirite who became ritually impure <b>after the completion</b> of his term, this <b>negates</b> only <b>seven days. Rav said: What</b> does: <b>Negates, that Rabbi Eliezer said</b> in the mishna here mean? It means that his impurity <b>negates</b> all <b>his offerings.</b> Rabbi Eliezer did not mean that the nazirite must count his entire term of naziriteship afresh; rather, he must bring all his offerings a second time, including the one whose blood was sprinkled before he became impure.

### Part 3
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that this is the meaning of Rabbi Eliezer’s statement, <b>as</b> the mishna later <b>teaches: And the Rabbis said: Let her bring the rest of her offerings and be purified. Learn from here</b> that they disagree only with regard to the offerings, but not the naziriteship itself.

### Part 4
The Gemara cites the rest of the mishna, which also indicates that the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree with regard to the offerings. <b>And an incident also</b> occurred <b>involving Miriam of Tarmod, that the blood of one</b> of her offerings <b>was sprinkled on her behalf, and they came and notified her that her daughter was mortally ill. And she went and found</b> that her daughter <b>was dead,</b> and thereby contracted impurity. <b>And the Rabbis said: Let her bring the rest of her offerings and be purified.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from</b> the mishna that this is so.
