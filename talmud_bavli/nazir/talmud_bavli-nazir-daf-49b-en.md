### Part 1
<b>“In to any”</b> served <b>to exclude</b> contracting impurity to bury <b>distant</b> people, for whom a High Priest may not become impure; <b>“dead”</b> comes <b>to exclude relatives; “bodies”</b> comes <b>to exclude a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of blood that emerges from two corpses, for it renders</b> people and objects <b>impure in a tent, as it is stated: “Neither shall he go in to any dead bodies”</b> (Leviticus 21:11). The plural “bodies” teaches that the blood of two people combines to form the minimum quantity for ritual impurity.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A nazirite shaves for</b> having become impure from <b>these</b> following sources of <b>ritual impurity: For</b> having become impure with impurity imparted by <b>a corpse; and for</b> impurity imparted by <b>an olive-bulk of a corpse; and for</b> impurity imparted by <b>an olive-bulk of fluid [<i>netzel</i>]</b> from a corpse; <b>and for</b> impurity imparted by <b>a full ladle [<i>tarvad</i>] of dust</b> from a corpse; and <b>for</b> impurity imparted by <b>the spine; and for</b> impurity imparted by <b>the skull; and for</b> impurity imparted by <b>a limb from a corpse or for</b> impurity imparted by <b>a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> person, <b>upon</b> either of <b>which there is a fitting</b> quantity of <b>flesh; and for</b> impurity imparted by <b>a half-<i>kav</i> of bones</b> from a corpse; <b>and for</b> impurity imparted by <b>a half-<i>log</i></b> of <b>blood.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And</b> a nazirite shaves in each of these cases for becoming impure <b>by coming into contact with them; and for</b> becoming impure by <b>carrying them; and for</b> becoming impure by <b>their tent,</b> i.e., if he was positioned like a tent over them, or if he entered a tent that contains them, or if they served as a tent over him. <b>And</b> as <b>for a bone that is a barley-grain-bulk,</b> he shaves <b>for</b> becoming impure by <b>coming into contact with it and by carrying it.</b> However, he is not rendered impure with the impurity imparted in a tent, i.e., by being under the same roof as the bone.

### Part 4
<b>For</b> all of <b>these</b> occurrences, <b>a nazirite shaves, and</b> a priest <b>sprinkles</b> the ashes of the red heifer on him <b>on the third and on the seventh</b> days to purify him from the impurity imparted by a corpse. <b>And he negates</b> all <b>the previous</b> days he counted toward his naziriteship, <b>and he begins counting</b> his term of naziriteship again <b>only after he becomes pure and brings his offerings.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: After Rabbi Meir’s death, Rabbi Yehuda said to his students: Do not let the students of Rabbi Meir enter here,</b> into the house of study, <b>because they are vexatious and they do not come to study Torah, but they come to overwhelm me with</b> their <b><i>halakhot</i>.</b> Nevertheless, <b>Sumakhos,</b> a student of Rabbi Meir, <b>forced his way and entered</b> the house of study.

### Part 6
When they reached the topic of the mishna, Sumakhos <b>said to them: Rabbi Meir taught me like this: A nazirite shaves for</b> becoming impure from <b>these</b> following sources of <b>ritual impurity: For</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse and for</b> impurity imparted by <b>an olive-bulk from a corpse. Rabbi Yehuda grew angry and said to</b> his disciples: <b>Didn’t I say to you like this: Do not let the students of Rabbi Meir enter here because they are vexatious?</b> He explained his annoyance. The clause: For a corpse, is unnecessary, as, if a nazirite <b>must shave for</b> impurity imparted by <b>an olive-bulk from a corpse,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> that he must shave <b>for</b> impurity imparted by an entire <b>corpse?</b>
