### Part 1
<b>and he does not negate the earlier</b> days of his naziriteship, but they are considered part of his naziriteship term. <b>And he starts counting</b> the rest of his naziriteship to complete his term <b>immediately</b> after his purification, <b>and he has no</b> obligation to sacrifice <b>an offering</b> of impurity for these sources of ritual impurity. <b>Actually they said</b> an ancient tradition that these <b>days of</b> the impurity of <b>the <i>zav</i></b> (Leviticus 15:1–15) <b>and the <i>zava</i></b> (Leviticus 15:25–30) <b>and the days of the confinement of a leper</b> before he is confirmed as a full-fledged leper (Leviticus 13:4–5) <b>count for him</b> toward the period of his naziriteship.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara explains the terms hangings and projections by citing a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 8:2). <b>And these are the hangings: A tree that overhangs the earth. And</b> the <b>projections</b> are stones <b>that protrude from a fence.</b>

### Part 3
§ The mishna further taught: <b>And the land of the nations</b> does not render a nazirite obligated to shave, despite the fact that it is considered ritually impure. The Gemara inquires with regard to the nature of this impurity. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Did the Sages <b>decree the land of the nations</b> impure <b>with regard to the air,</b> i.e., is one rendered impure merely by being there? <b>Or perhaps they decreed</b> it impure <b>with regard to the earth,</b> i.e., one who touches the ground or overlays it becomes impure.

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this question from the mishna, which lists one who enters the land of the nations and states: <b>And one sprinkles</b> on him <b>on the third and on the seventh</b> days. <b>And if you say</b> that the decree was <b>with regard to the air, why do I</b> need this <b>sprinkling?</b> He neither touched something ritually impure nor overlaid it.

### Part 5
<b>Rather, is it not with regard to the earth</b> that the land of the nations was decreed impure? The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No, actually I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that the decree is <b>due to the air, and when</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that he receives the sprinkling, it is referring <b>to the other</b> items listed in the mishna, e.g., the grave cover, the grave walls, and a quarter-<i>log</i> of blood.

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that this is the case, <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna also <b>teaches: And vessels that are touching a corpse.</b> Now do people who touch <b>these vessels require sprinkling?</b> Does one who touches a vessel that is ritually impure from a corpse require the sprinkling of purification water? This individual is impure only until that evening. <b>Rather, learn from this</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that he is sprinkled on the third and on the seventh days does not refer to all the cases in the mishna but only <b>to</b> some of <b>the others.</b>
