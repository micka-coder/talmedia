### Part 1
<b>Rav Hamnuna says:</b> In the case of <b>a nazirite and one performing</b> the ritual of <b>the Paschal</b> offering <b>who walked by a grave in the depths,</b> i.e., an unknown grave, <b>on their seventh</b> day of <b>their</b> purification, i.e., seven days after they were sprinkled with the purification waters after having contracted ritual impurity imparted by a corpse, <b>they are pure.</b> If the nazirite shaved for his impurity and completed his naziriteship in purity or if the one performing the ritual of the Paschal offering sacrificed his offering, then when he eventually discovers the impurity, it is considered as though he were pure all along. <b>What is the reason</b> for this lenient ruling? It is <b>because the ritual impurity</b> imparted by a grave <b>in the depths is not strong</b> enough <b>to negate</b> their actions, i.e., the nazirite offerings or the Paschal offering.

### Part 2
<b>Rava raised an objection</b> to this ruling from the statement of the mishna that if there is one whose impurity imparted by a grave in the depths is uncertain and he <b>descended to purify himself from the ritual impurity</b> imparted by <b>a corpse,</b> he is <b>impure,</b> as a person or item <b>that has the presumptive status of impurity</b> remains <b>impure, and</b> one that has <b>the presumptive status of purity</b> remains <b>pure.</b> Here too, the nazirite and the one performing the ritual of the Paschal offering people had not completed their purification at the time, as the seventh day following their being sprinkled had not ended. As their presumptive status is impure, they are retroactively rendered impure, even by an impurity of the depths.

### Part 3
Rav Hamnuna <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>I agree with you with regard to a nazirite</b> who descended to purify himself and <b>who is lacking</b> the act of <b>shaving.</b> He has yet to shave his head for his impurity and is therefore not completely pure. Consequently, he follows his prior presumptive status of impurity.

### Part 4
<b>Rava said to him: I, too, agree with you with regard to one performing</b> the ritual of <b>the Paschal offering</b> that he is pure, <b>as he is not lacking anything.</b> Since he does not have to perform any action on his body before he can bring an offering, one can say that he already has a presumptive status of purity on the seventh day. <b>Abaye said to him: But</b> he <b>is</b> still <b>lacking sunset,</b> i.e., he is not fully pure until the sun sets on the seventh day. Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>The sun sets by itself,</b> and therefore this cannot be seen as a deficiency involving an action.

### Part 5
The Gemara comments: <b>And even Abaye</b> accepted Rava’s answer and <b>retracted, as</b> can be seen from that which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. By Torah law, a woman who gives birth to a boy is ritually impure for seven days, and a woman who gives birth to a girl is impure for fourteen days. At that point, the woman immerses in a ritual bath and is purified. Any blood that emerges from the woman during her days of purity, i.e., for forty days following the birth of a male and eighty days following the birth of a female, does not render her impure. She cannot bring the offering brought by a woman who has given birth or miscarried until she has immersed at the end of these days (see Leviticus, chapter 12). The <i>baraita</i> discusses a case where a woman who had given birth became pregnant and miscarried before she had brought her offering for the first birth.

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: If a woman miscarried on <b>the day of the fulfillment</b> of her purity, on the eighty-first day after a female, <b>she must bring</b> a separate offering for the miscarried fetus, as she was obligated to bring one offering before her miscarriage. If she miscarried <b>during the fulfillment,</b> i.e., before the conclusion of the eighty days for the birth of a daughter, <b>she does not bring</b> two offerings but only one, just as is the <i>halakha</i> in the case of one who gives birth to twins.

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>she should not bring</b> an offering <b>for her childbirth,</b> i.e., miscarriage, <b>that</b> occurred <b>before the fulfillment</b> of the days of her purity <b>but she should bring for her childbirth that</b> occurred <b>after</b> its <b>completion.</b> In other words, if she had yet another miscarriage, after the days of her purity for her initial birth but within the eighty days of purity following her first miscarriage, she should bring an extra offering <b>and</b> thereby <b>discharge both</b> obligations, of her birth and her final miscarriage.

### Part 8
Therefore, to counteract this possibility, <b>the verse states: “And when the days of her purity are fulfilled…</b>she shall bring” (Leviticus 12:6). This teaches that it is only if she miscarried <b>on the day of the fulfillment</b> itself that <b>she must bring</b> an offering for a miscarriage, but if she miscarried <b>before the fulfillment</b> of the days of her purity of the earlier miscarriage, even if this occurred more than eighty days after the first birth, <b>she does not bring</b> another offering.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Kahana said</b> in explanation: <b>Here it is different.</b> The reason why she does not bring an offering for a miscarriage during her days of purity is <b>that she lacks</b> the possibility of bringing her <b>offering.</b> Since she cannot bring her offering until the end of her term of purity, she cannot incur another obligation during this period, no matter how many births occur within eighty days of the previous one. However, this leads Rav Kahana to ask: <b>There too,</b> if she had a miscarriage on the day of the completion of her term, she cannot bring her offering either, as she <b>lacks sunset.</b> Why, then, must she bring an additional offering?

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>The sun sets by itself</b> and is not considered a deficiency with regard to her purity. This discussion shows that Abaye accepted Rava’s reasoning, as he submitted the same argument himself in a different context.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who finds a corpse for the first</b> time, i.e., he discovers a single corpse in a place that was not previously established as a cemetery, if the corpse is <b>lying in</b> the <b>usual manner</b> of Jewish burial, <b>he removes it</b> from there <b>and</b> also <b>its surrounding</b> earth. It is assumed that this corpse was buried there alone. There is no concern that this area is a cemetery and therefore the corpse may not be moved, nor does one take into account the possibility that another corpse may be buried in the vicinity.

### Part 12
Similarly, if he found <b>two</b> corpses, <b>he removes them and their surrounding</b> earth. In a case where he <b>found three</b> corpses, <b>if there is</b> a space <b>between this</b> corpse <b>and that</b> corpse <b>of four to eight cubits,</b> in a standard design, <b>this is a graveyard.</b> There is a concern that this might be an ancient cemetery.
