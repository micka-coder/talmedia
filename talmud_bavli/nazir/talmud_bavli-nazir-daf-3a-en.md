### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as even according to Rabbi Elazar HaKappar, who said</b> that <b>a nazirite</b> is <b>a sinner, that applies</b> only <b>with regard to a ritually impure nazirite.</b> This is <b>because it is necessary</b> for him <b>to void</b> the days of his vow that have been observed and to begin his term anew, <b>as the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“But the first days will be void, because his consecration was defiled”</b> (Numbers 6:12). <b>It is there</b> that Rabbi Elazar HaKappar called the nazirite a sinner, because <b>perhaps</b> he will <b>come to transgress his naziriteship</b> now that he is a nazirite for a longer period than he originally intended. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>a ritually pure nazirite,</b> Rabbi Elazar HaKappar <b>does not call him a sinner.</b>

### Part 2
§ The mishna taught that one who says: <b>I am hereby like this,</b> is a nazirite. The Gemara asks: <b>Though</b> this is <b>indeed</b> a case <b>where he is holding his hair</b> at the time, since <b>he did not say: I am hereby like this,</b> how can this statement constitute an acceptance of naziriteship? <b>Shmuel said:</b> It is a case <b>where a nazirite was passing before him</b> when he made his statement. His intention was to declare himself a nazirite like the individual passing before him, and his statement therefore constitutes a nazirite vow.

### Part 3
The mishna rules that one who says: <b>I am hereby a hair curler</b> is a nazirite. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that this</b> term is referring to the <b>curling [<i>silsul</i>]</b> of <b>hair</b> by allowing it to grow? The Gemara answers: <b>As that maidservant of the house of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to a certain man</b> who grew his hair long: <b>Until when will you curl [<i>mesalsel</i>] your hair?</b> This shows that <i>mesalsel</i> means to grow hair.

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>Say</b> that the word <i>mesalsel</i> is referring to the study of <b>Torah, as it is written</b> with regard to Torah: <b>“Extol her [<i>salseleha</i>] and she will exalt you”</b> (Proverbs 4:8). The Gemara responds that <b>Shmuel said: Here too,</b> the case is <b>where he was holding his hair</b> at the time of his pronouncement.

### Part 5
The mishna rules that one who says: <b>I am hereby growing</b> my <b>hair</b> is a nazirite. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that this</b> term <b>is</b> a reference to <b>growing [<i>kilkul</i>] his hair?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 78b): With regard to the measure that determines liability for carrying out <b>lime</b> on Shabbat from a private to a public domain, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The measure is <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to spread on</b> one’s <b><i>kilkul</i>. And Rav said:</b> This is referring to the hair that grows on <b>the areas beneath the temple.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests: <b>Say</b> that he vowed to <b>sustain the poor, as it is written: “And Joseph sustained [<i>vaykhalkel</i>] his father and his brethren”</b> (Genesis 47:12). The Gemara responds that <b>Shmuel said: Here too,</b> in the mishna, the case is one <b>where the individual was holding his hair</b> when he made his pronouncement, so that it was clear that he was referring to growing his hair.

### Part 7
The mishna rules that with regard to one who says: <b>It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me to grow [<i>leshale’aḥ</i>] long hair, he is a nazirite.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that this</b> term <b><i>shilu’aḥ</i>,</b> which is a different form of the word <i>leshale’aḥ</i>, <b>is</b> an expression of <b>increase</b> and growth? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “Your tresses [<i>shelaḥayikh</i>] are a park of pomegranates”</b> (Song of Songs 4:13).

### Part 8
The Gemara suggests: <b>Say</b> that it is referring to <b>a matter</b> involving <b>transfer, as it is written: “And sends [<i>shole’aḥ</i>] water upon the earth”</b> (Job 5:10), where the word <i>shole’aḥ</i> is referring to the transport of water from one place to another. Here too, the individual taking the vow might mean that he intends to transfer, i.e., to remove, his hair.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i> derives</b> the meaning of this term based upon a verbal analogy of the term <b>long locks [<i>pera</i>]</b> written with regard to a nazirite and the term <b>long locks [<i>pera</i>]</b> written with regard to a priest. <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to a nazirite: <b>“He shall be holy, he shall let the</b> hair of his head <b>grow [<i>gadel</i>] long locks [<i>pera</i>]”</b> (Numbers 6:5). <b>And it is written there, with regard to a common priest</b> serving in the Temple: <b>“And they will not let their locks grow long [<i>pera lo yeshaleḥu</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 44:20). Just as the word <i>pera</i> with regard to a nazirite indicates growing long hair, so too, in the case of a priest it is referring to growing long hair. This proves that the term <i>shilu’aḥ</i> means letting one’s hair grow.

### Part 10
The Gemara offers an alternate answer: <b>And if you wish, say</b> that the meaning of the word <i>shole’aḥ</i> in <b>that</b> phrase: <b>Sends [<i>shole’aḥ</i>] water, is also increase</b> and growth, <b>as Rav Yosef translated</b> this verse into Aramaic in the following manner: <b>When one waters produce, it grows.</b> Consequently, the verse is referring to growth by means of water.

### Part 11
§ The mishna taught that if one says: An obligation <b>is hereby</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> with regard to <b>birds, Rabbi Meir says: He is a nazirite,</b> and the Sages say: He is not a nazirite. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir? Reish Lakish said: He accepted upon himself</b> an obligation with regard to the <b>birds</b> that are <b>juxtaposed</b> in a verse <b>to hair, as it is written: “Until his hair was grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws”</b> (Daniel 4:30). Since the verse juxtaposes birds with growing hair, it is understood that when this individual accepted an obligation with regard to birds, he was referring to growing his hair as a nazirite.

### Part 12
The Gemara explains the basis of the dispute: <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>a person associates</b> the object of his vow with <b>something that is juxtaposed</b> to it in a verse, so that when he says that it is incumbent upon him to bring birds, he means that it is incumbent upon him to grow his hair.
