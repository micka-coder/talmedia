### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the derivation of <b>Rabbi Akiva, now</b> consider, it <b>is no different</b> whether the individual was <b>a High Priest alone, and</b> it <b>is no different</b> if he was <b>a High Priest who was</b> also <b>a nazirite;</b> the <i>halakha</i> that he must become impure to bury a <i>met mitzva</i> is <b>derived from</b> the phrase <b>“for his brother,”</b> stated with regard to a nazirite (Numbers 6:7). But if so, <b>why do I</b> need the expression <b>“for his father, or for his mother”</b> (Numbers 6:7)? The general prohibition against contracting impurity from any corpse should suffice.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: Both <b>are necessary, as had</b> the verse <b>written</b> only “for <b>his father,” I would say</b> that <b>this is the reason</b> that a nazirite <b>may not become impure for</b> his father: <b>Because it is merely a presumption</b> that he is his father, as one cannot be absolutely sure of the identity of one’s father. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>his mother, whom we know gave birth to him,</b> perhaps <b>let him become impure to</b> bury <b>her.</b> The verse therefore states: “His mother.”

### Part 3
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>had the Merciful One written</b> only “for <b>his mother,” I would say</b> that it is solely <b>to</b> bury <b>his mother</b> that <b>he may not become impure, as her seed does not follow her,</b> i.e., a man’s lineage is determined by his father, not his mother. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>his father, since the Master said</b> with regard to the verse <b>“by their families, by their fathers’ house”</b> (Numbers 1:2) that one’s family ancestry follows his father, you might <b>say: Let him become impure to</b> bury <b>him.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that a nazirite may not become impure to bury his father either.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: According to the derivation of Rabbi Akiva, <b>why do I</b> need the words <b>“neither shall he go in to any dead bodies”</b> (Leviticus 21:11), stated with regard to a High Priest?
