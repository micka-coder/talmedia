### Part 1
Rav Pappa <b>said to him: And according to your reasoning,</b> which leads to the conclusion that all items can have the status of unallocated funds, consider <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (45a): <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If one <b>brought three</b> different <b>animals</b> for his naziriteship <b>and did not specify</b> which was for which offering, <b>that which is fit for a sin-offering,</b> a ewe, <b>is sacrificed as a sin-offering;</b> the animal suitable <b>for a burnt-offering,</b> a male sheep or bull, <b>is sacrificed as a burnt-offering;</b> and the animal fit <b>for a peace-offering,</b> any other male or female, <b>is sacrificed as a peace-offering.</b> But according to your opinion, <b>why</b> is this so? <b>Didn’t you say</b> that <b>an animal is not considered as allocated,</b> but is instead like unallocated funds; how can one decide which animal to use for each offering?

### Part 3
<b>The Merciful One</b> thereby <b>states</b> that the birds are allocated and designated for their offering <b>either by the acquisition of the owner,</b> by designating each bird for a particular offering upon their purchase, <b>or by the action of the priest.</b> With regard to the ruling of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, it presents no difficulty either, as it is a special case as well. <b>Here too,</b> when one separates these particular animals for his naziriteship offerings,
