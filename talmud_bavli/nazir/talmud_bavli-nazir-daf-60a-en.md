### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sage <b>taught: In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> of the mishna <b>said? With regard to a short naziriteship</b> of thirty days. <b>However, with regard to a naziriteship of a year, he partakes of sacrificial food</b> only <b>after two years.</b> He cannot shave until a year has passed, in case he is not a leper; he may shave the second time only a year later, in case he was impure during the first year and this second year was his naziriteship observed in purity. At this stage he may partake of sacrificial meat, for if he was a full-fledged leper he has shaved twice.

### Part 2
Yet if the first two shavings were for his leprosy, he has not shaved for his naziriteship at all, and therefore he must observe a third year of naziriteship and shave. He then must observe another year of naziriteship and shave again, as perhaps his third shaving was for impurity and the fourth will be for his naziriteship in purity. <b>And</b> consequently <b>he may drink wine and become impure from the dead</b> only <b>after four years.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And it is taught with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the mishna (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:1): <b>And he shaves</b> with <b>four</b> separate acts of <b>shaving,</b> each time for its own reason. How so? For his <b>first shaving,</b> after the thirty days of an unspecified naziriteship or at the end of the period he vowed to observe naziriteship, he <b>brings</b> two <b>birds</b> of a leper: One is slaughtered over spring water and the other is sent away (Leviticus 14:4–7).

### Part 4
<b>And</b> he also brings <b>a bird sin-offering</b> for his shaving of impure naziriteship, as he may have contracted impurity from a corpse, <b>and an animal burnt-offering</b> for his shaving of purity, as he may not have contracted impurity from a corpse. For his <b>second</b> shaving he <b>brings a bird sin-offering and an animal burnt-offering.</b> For his <b>third</b> shaving he again <b>brings a bird sin-offering and an animal burnt-offering.</b> And for the <b>fourth</b> shaving he <b>brings an offering of purity.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara analyzes the details and reasons for this <i>halakha</i>: <b>You said</b> in this <i>baraita</i> that for the <b>first shaving</b> he <b>brings</b> the two birds of a leper, as well as a bird sin-offering and an animal burnt-offering. The Gemara explains: In this manner <b>he brings</b> the <b>proper</b> offerings <b>whichever way you</b> look at it. <b>As, if his</b> status as <b>a leper</b> is <b>definite and he is not impure,</b> the <b>birds</b> he brings are for <b>his obligation</b> to purify himself from leprosy. <b>And</b> as <b>the bird sin-offering</b> in case he was impure was brought due to <b>uncertainty,</b> it <b>goes for burial,</b> like all bird sin-offerings sacrificed in a case of uncertainty, which cannot be eaten. <b>And</b> the bird <b>burnt-offering</b> that he brought in case he was an impure nazirite <b>is a gift</b> offering.

### Part 6
The Gemara further explains: <b>But</b> it <b>is not possible to shave him</b> right <b>after seven days,</b> as one usually does when purified from leprosy, <b>as perhaps he is not a confirmed</b> leper and has no obligation to shave but is bound by the naziriteship vow, <b>and the Merciful One says: “No razor shall come upon his head; until</b> the days are <b>fulfilled</b> in which he consecrated himself to the Lord” (Numbers 6:5). This verse teaches that he cannot shave until the end of his naziriteship. Therefore, he shaves only after thirty days.

### Part 7
The Gemara continues to clarify the various uncertainties concerning the first shaving. <b>And if he is not a definite leper but he is impure</b> from a corpse, <b>the bird sin-offering</b> is for <b>his obligation</b> as an impure nazirite, <b>and</b> there is no problem with the unnecessary rituals of a leper’s <b>birds,</b> as <b>they are performed outside</b> the Temple, <b>and are not</b> subject to the prohibition against bringing <b>non-sacred</b> animals <b>into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b> Therefore, the slaughter of one of the birds outside the Temple is not a transgression. <b>And</b> the <b>animal burnt-offering is</b> considered <b>a gift</b> offering.

### Part 8
<b>And if he is neither a leper nor impure</b> he has also acted correctly, as <b>the birds are performed outside</b> the Temple, which means no transgression is committed, while the <b>bird sin-offering</b> of uncertain necessity goes <b>to burial,</b> and the <b>animal burnt-offering is</b> for <b>his obligation,</b> like any nazirite who completes his naziriteship. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t a leper <b>required</b> to bring <b>a guilt-offering</b> to complete his atonement and permit him to partake of sacrificial food? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who said</b> that one <b>may bring</b> a guilt-offering <b>and stipulate</b> as follows: If I am obligated to bring this offering then it is for my obligation; and if not, it shall be a voluntary peace-offering.

### Part 9
For the <b>second and third shavings</b> he does <b>not need</b> to bring <b>birds</b> again, <b>as he has</b> already <b>performed</b> this ritual. <b>What is</b> the potential concern? That <b>perhaps he</b> was previously <b>a confirmed</b> leper of <b>definite</b> status. For this reason, <b>one</b> of the bird sin-offerings he brings at the second shaving is <b>for</b> the days of <b>his counting</b> when his status was <b>uncertain.</b> After the first purification of a confirmed leper he counts seven days, or thirty days in this case due to the uncertainty, and brings a sin-offering.

### Part 10
<b>And</b> the <b>one</b> sin-offering he brings at his third shaving is <b>for his uncertain impurity.</b> If he was a leper, the offerings he brought on the previous occasion were for purification of his leprosy, not his naziriteship. This means that, if he was impure, he is still required to bring a sin-offering for his impurity as a nazirite. Furthermore, the animal burnt-offerings he brings for his second and third shavings are for his naziriteship of purity. For his <b>fourth shaving he brings an offering of purity and stipulates</b> as follows:
