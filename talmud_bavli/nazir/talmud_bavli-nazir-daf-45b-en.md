### Part 1
<b>lest</b> the <b>young priests [<i>pirḥei khehuna</i>]</b> present <b>will become aroused by her</b> when she uncovers her hair in their presence. One of the other Sages <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon Shezuri: <b>According to your statement,</b> the case of <b>a <i>sota</i> will prove</b> that this is not a concern, <b>as it is written with regard to her: “And he shall set her before the Lord”</b> (Numbers 5:16), <b>and</b> yet <b>we are not concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the <b>young priests will become aroused by her</b> when her hair is uncovered.

### Part 2
Rabbi Shimon Shezuri <b>said to them:</b> There is a difference between a female nazirite and a <i>sota</i>. <b>This</b> one, the nazirite, <b>paints</b> her eyes <b>blue [<i>koḥelet</i>] and applies blush [<i>fokeset</i>]</b> to her face, and therefore there is a concern that young priests might be aroused by her appearance. By contrast, <b>that</b> one, the <i>sota</i>, <b>does not apply blue</b> eye shadow <b>and</b> does not <b>apply blush.</b> Since a <i>sota</i> is not beautified, but is made to appear wretched and looks disheveled, there is no concern that she might arouse the men.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> After the nazirite shaved off his hair, <b>he would take the hair of his consecrated head and throw</b> it <b>under the pot</b> in which the peace-offering was cooked, where it would burn. <b>And if</b> the nazirite <b>shaved in</b> the rest of <b>the country,</b> i.e., outside the Temple, <b>he would not throw</b> the hair <b>under the pot. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to the shaving of purity. However, with regard to the shaving of impurity,</b> i.e., shaving that accompanied his guilt-offering and sin-offering of birds after his term of naziriteship was interrupted by impurity, <b>he would not throw</b> his hair <b>under the pot</b> in which his offerings were cooked, as the Torah stated this requirement only for a pure nazirite.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Meir says: Everyone throws</b> his hair <b>under the pot,</b> including a pure nazirite who shaved outside the Temple and an impure nazirite, <b>except for an impure</b> nazirite <b>who shaved in the</b> rest of <b>the country.</b> In that case <b>alone</b> he refrains from throwing his hair to be burned beneath his offering.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that he would <b>take the hair of his consecrated head. The Sages taught: And afterward,</b> after cooking the peace-offering, he <b>takes the gravy [<i>rotev</i>]</b> in which the offering had been cooked, <b>places</b> it <b>on the</b> shaven <b>hair of his consecrated head, and throws</b> the hair <b>under the pot of</b> his <b>peace-offering. And if he threw</b> his hair <b>under the pot of</b> the <b>sin-offering or</b> the <b>guilt-offering, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation after the fact. The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: <b>Is there a guilt-offering</b> brought <b>by a pure nazirite?</b> Only an impure nazirite brings a guilt-offering. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>said,</b> i.e., meant: <b>And if an impure nazirite threw</b> his hair <b>under the pot of</b> the <b>guilt-offering, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that he must pour gravy from the offering over his hair? <b>Rava said</b> that as <b>the verse states:</b> “And he shall take the hair of his consecrated head and put it on the fire <b>which is under the sacrifice of the peace-offering”</b> (Numbers 6:18), this indicates that part <b>of his sacrifice must be under</b> the hair.

### Part 7
With regard to the statement of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And if he threw</b> his hair <b>under the pot of</b> the <b>sin-offering he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, the Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states:</b> “The <b>sacrifice</b> of the peace-offering,” when it could simply have stated: The peace-offering. This serves <b>to include the sin-offering and</b> the <b>guilt-offering,</b> which are also sacrifices. The Gemara asks: <b>But you have</b> already <b>derived</b> from <b>this</b> term <b>“sacrifice”</b> that he must pour part <b>of the gravy</b> of the peace-offering over his hair. The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let the verse say</b> explicitly: <b>From the gravy of the peace-offering. Why</b> does it state: <b>“Sacrifice”? Learn from here</b> that it serves <b>to include the sin-offering and</b> the <b>guilt-offering.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara questions this statement from a different perspective: <b>And</b> one can <b>say</b> that this verse <b>comes entirely</b> to teach <b>about the sin-offering and guilt-offering,</b> and it does not refer to the gravy at all. The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let it state: Peace-offering and a sacrifice;</b> for <b>what</b> reason does it write: <b>“The sacrifice of the peace-offering”? Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from</b> the verse.

### Part 9
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 4:6): <b>All</b> nazirites <b>would throw</b> their hair <b>under the pot, except for an impure</b> nazirite <b>who shaved in</b> the rest of <b>the country, because</b> that one’s <b>hair is buried.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: Pure</b> nazirites, whether they are <b>here or there,</b> inside or outside the Temple, <b>would throw</b> their hair under the pot; <b>impure</b> nazirites, whether <b>here or there, would not throw</b> it. <b>And the Rabbis say: None would throw</b> their hair <b>under the pot, except for a pure</b> nazirite <b>in the Temple, because</b> only in that case <b>is</b> the mitzva <b>performed properly,</b> as commanded by the Torah.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The nazirite <b>would cook the peace-offering or overcook it,</b> i.e., cook it thoroughly. <b>The priest takes the cooked foreleg from the ram, and one unleavened loaf from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and places</b> them <b>on the palms of the nazirite and waves them,</b> as described in the Torah (Numbers 6:19–20). <b>And afterward the nazirite is permitted to drink wine and to contract ritual impurity</b> imparted <b>by a corpse.</b>
