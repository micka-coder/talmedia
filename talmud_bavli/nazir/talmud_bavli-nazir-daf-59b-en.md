### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The previous mishna described how two nazirites sacrifice offerings of impurity and purity, in a situation in which one of them has become impure but they do not know which one. This mishna discusses what must be done if <b>one of them dies</b> before bringing his offerings. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said:</b> The surviving nazirite <b>asks someone in the marketplace,</b> a non-nazirite, <b>to vow to be a nazirite corresponding to him,</b> i.e., under the same conditions as his own naziriteship, so that he can bring offerings together with him.

### Part 2
<b>And he says</b> to him as follows: <b>If I was impure, you are hereby a nazirite immediately; and if I was pure, you are hereby a nazirite after thirty days. And they</b> both proceed to <b>count thirty days and bring an offering of impurity and an offering of purity. And</b> the nazirite who was defined as having uncertain impurity <b>says: If I am the impure</b> one, <b>the offering of impurity is mine and the offering of purity is yours; and if I am the pure one, the offering of purity is mine and the offering of impurity</b> we brought shall be <b>of uncertain</b> status.

### Part 3
<b>And they</b> subsequently <b>count</b> another <b>thirty days and bring an offering of purity, and</b> the first nazirite <b>says: If I</b> was <b>the impure</b> one, <b>the offering of impurity</b> that we sacrificed at the end of the first thirty days was <b>mine, and the offering of purity</b> we brought then was <b>yours; and this</b> offering I am bringing now is <b>my offering of purity. And if I</b> was <b>the pure</b> one, and the deceased nazirite was impure, <b>the offering of purity</b> we brought thirty days ago was <b>mine, and the offering of impurity</b> we brought earlier was <b>of uncertain</b> status, <b>and this is your offering of purity.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Ben Zoma said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>And who will listen to him to vow to be a nazirite corresponding to him?</b> How can one design a <i>halakha</i> on the assumption that a non-nazirite will agree to be a nazirite for a lengthy term? <b>Rather,</b> a different procedure is available: After thirty days of naziriteship <b>he brings a bird sin-offering and an animal burnt-offering, and says: If I was impure, the sin-offering is for my obligation</b> as an impure nazirite, <b>and the burnt-offering</b> is a regular <b>gift</b> offering. <b>And if I was pure, the burnt-offering is for my obligation</b> as a pure nazirite, <b>and the sin-offering</b> is <b>of uncertain</b> status.

### Part 5
<b>And he counts</b> another <b>thirty days, and brings an offering of purity, and says: If I was impure, the first burnt-offering</b> I brought should be considered <b>a gift</b> offering, <b>and this</b> one I am bringing now is for my <b>obligation. And if I was pure, the first burnt-offering</b> I brought is for my <b>obligation</b> as a pure nazirite, <b>and this</b> one I am bringing now is <b>a gift</b> offering. <b>And these,</b> i.e., the sin-offering and peace-offering I am sacrificing now, comprises <b>the rest of my offerings</b> that I was obligated to bring earlier.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said:</b> According to your opinion, <b>it turns out</b> that <b>this</b> nazirite <b>brings his offerings in halves,</b> i.e., in stages. If he was pure, he brings his burnt-offering thirty days before the rest of his offerings. <b>However, the Rabbis agreed with ben Zoma,</b> and disregarded the concern about splitting up the offerings.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that Rabbi Yehoshua countered ben Zoma’s opinion by pointing out that his solution would cause the nazirite to bring his offerings in stages. The Gemara asks: What is wrong with that? <b>And let him bring</b> the offerings in stages. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Rabbi Yehoshua said</b> this comment <b>only to sharpen</b> the minds of <b>the students.</b> He did not really maintain that it is prohibited to act in this manner; rather, he wanted to test his disciples to see if they were aware of the <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Naḥman said,</b> in a light-hearted vein: <b>What will Rabbi Yehoshua do with the intestines</b> of <b>his</b> animals so <b>that they will not spoil?</b> If he insists that the offerings of purity must all be brought at the same time, the only way to do so is to wait thirty days after slaughtering the burnt-offering before burning its intestines, which is certainly impractical.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a nazirite who,</b> on the first day of his naziriteship, <b>was impure</b> from a corpse as a matter of <b>uncertainty and</b> was also <b>a confirmed leper</b> as a matter of <b>uncertainty,</b> i.e., it was uncertain whether or not he had leprosy, how can he fulfill the shaving obligations of a pure nazirite and an impure leper? The problem facing this nazirite is that a leper must shave both when he begins his purification process and at the close of it, one week later. However, a nazirite is prohibited from shaving. Additionally, a leper may not partake of sacrificial food, but a nazirite may. Therefore, <b>he may partake of sacrificial food sixty days after</b> he may have become impure, when the uncertainty with regard to leprosy will have been clarified. He shaves for the first time for his leprosy after thirty days, and for the second time thirty days later, the shaving of the end of the purification process; at which point he brings the offerings of a purified leper and may partake of sacrificial food.

### Part 10
<b>But</b> he <b>may drink wine and become impure from the dead,</b> effectively ending his naziriteship, only <b>after 120 days.</b> This is because he might have been a full-fledged leper, which means that his shavings count toward his leprosy, not his naziriteship. Consequently, after the first sixty days he must observe another thirty days of naziriteship and shave again. Even then he has yet to fulfill all his obligations, as he might have been impure from a corpse, which means his shaving after ninety days was for his impurity. He must therefore remain a nazirite for another thirty days, before shaving one final time at the end of 120 days to fulfill his naziriteship obligation.

### Part 11
The mishna notes: The reason that he cannot shave for his leprosy after seven days and perform the second shaving of a leper seven days later is <b>because the shaving of leprosy overrides</b> the prohibition of <b>the shaving of a nazirite</b> only <b>when his</b> status as <b>a leper</b> is <b>definite. However, when his</b> status as <b>a leper</b> is <b>uncertain,</b> the shaving <b>does not override</b> his naziriteship, and therefore he must wait thirty days before each of his shavings for leprosy.
