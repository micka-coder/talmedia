### Part 1
<b>that a positive mitzva does not come and override a prohibition and a positive mitzva, let him derive from</b> the fact that a leprous <b>priest</b> must shave <b>that</b> this mitzva <b>does override</b> a prohibition and another positive mitzva.

### Part 2
<b>Rather,</b> he would explain that <b>we do not derive</b> other cases of the Torah <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a priest,</b> for the following reason: <b>What</b> is different about the prohibition <b>of a priest is that</b> it is <b>a prohibition that is not equally</b> applicable <b>to all,</b> i.e., the prohibitions of a priest do not apply to Israelites. For the same reason, the case of <b>a nazirite also cannot be derived from</b> that of <b>a priest, as</b> the prohibition of a priest is <b>a prohibition that is not equally</b> applicable <b>to all,</b> in contrast to that of a nazirite. Consequently, the derivation from “his head” is necessary to teach that the shaving of a leper overrides the prohibition stated with regard to a nazirite.

### Part 3
The Gemara turns its attention to the other opinion: <b>And</b> according to <b>the one who establishes this</b> verse: “He shall shave all his hair; <b>his head</b> and his beard” (Leviticus 14:9), as referring <b>to a nazirite,</b> i.e., he derives from this verse the principle that in certain cases, including that of a leprous priest, a positive mitzva overrides a prohibition and a positive mitzva, <b>why do I</b> need the term <b>“his beard”?</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the shaving of a leper, which must be performed with a razor: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “His beard,”</b> as it already stated that he shaves all his hair? <b>Since it is stated: “Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard”</b> (Leviticus 21:5), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even a priest</b> who is <b>a leper is included</b> in the prohibition against shaving. <b>The verse</b> therefore <b>states: “His beard,”</b> to teach that a leprous priest must shave his beard as well.

### Part 5
<b>And from where do we</b> derive that a leper must shave <b>with a razor? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard”</b> (Leviticus 21:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that priests <b>should be liable even if they shaved</b> their beards <b>with scissors. The verse states: “And you shall not destroy</b> the corners of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27), which teaches that the prohibition applies only to the destruction of the beard from its roots. <b>If</b> the sole criterion is the phrase <b>“you shall not destroy,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>if he extracted</b> his hair <b>with tweezers or</b> removed his hair <b>with</b> a carpenter’s <b>plane, he should</b> likewise <b>be liable</b> due to the prohibition against destroying his hair.

### Part 6
<b>The verse</b> therefore <b>states: “Neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard.”</b> Together the two verses lead to the following conclusion: <b>Which</b> is the type of <b>shaving [<i>giluaḥ</i>] that involves destruction [<i>hashḥata</i>]? You must say it is a razor.</b> The fact that it was necessary for the Torah to permit a leper to shave his beard with a razor, notwithstanding the prohibition against using this implement, proves that the positive mitzva overrides this prohibition, as derived from the term “his beard.”

### Part 7
The Gemara continues to inquire: <b>And</b> according to <b>the one who derives from</b> the term <b>“his head”</b> the principle <b>that</b> a positive mitzva overrides <b>only a prohibition, why do I</b> need the verse <b>to write: “His head,” and why do I</b> also need the same verse <b>to write: “His beard”?</b> Once is it derived from the phrase “his beard” that a positive mitzva overrides a positive mitzva and a prohibition, the same should certainly apply to a prohibition by itself.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: Both the term “his head” and the term “his beard” could come to <b>teach the overriding of only a prohibition, and</b> they also could <b>teach the overriding of a prohibition and a positive mitzva.</b> Since the verse is formulated in general terms, it includes a priest or a nazirite. <b>Therefore,</b> as it cannot be determined to which case the Torah is referring, <b>it is even,</b> i.e., equally balanced, <b>and</b> consequently <b>let both</b> terms <b>come</b> and teach this principle, one with regard to a nazirite, and the other with regard to a priest.

### Part 9
The Gemara adds that both terms are necessary, as the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a priest cannot be derived from</b> that of <b>a nazirite, as</b> the case of a nazirite is lenient in that <b>it is</b> possible to dissolve naziriteship <b>by request</b> from a halakhic authority. Likewise, the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a nazirite cannot be derived from</b> that of <b>a priest, as</b> the case of a priest involves <b>a prohibition that is not equally</b> applicable <b>to all.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And generally,</b> with regard to other <i>halakhot</i>, <b>we cannot derive from</b> these two cases that a positive mitzva overrides a prohibition and a positive mitzva, <b>due to</b> the fact that this argument <b>can be refuted as we said</b> here.

### Part 10
§ <b>Rav said: A person</b> who is not a nazirite <b>may lighten</b> his burden by removing <b>all</b> the hair of <b>his body with a razor.</b> One who feels he has too much hair may shave all of it off with a razor, apart from his beard and the corners of his head. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against this from a <i>baraita</i>: A man <b>who removes</b> the hair <b>of the armpit or the pubic</b> hair <b>is flogged</b> for transgressing the prohibition: “A man shall not put on a woman’s garment” (Deuteronomy 22:5), as this behavior is the manner of women.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: In <b>this</b> case he is flogged because he shaved <b>with a razor,</b> whereas in <b>that</b> case Rav said it is permitted because he was referring to one who removes hair <b>with scissors,</b> an act that is not considered a prohibition. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But Rav said</b> it is permitted <b>with a razor as well.</b> The Gemara answers: He did not mean an actual razor; rather, he said that one may use an implement that is <b>similar to a razor,</b> i.e., scissors that cut very close to the skin, in the manner of a razor.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> A man <b>who removes</b> the hair <b>of the armpit or the pubic</b> hair <b>is flogged.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against this ruling: <b>The removal of hair is not</b> prohibited <b>by Torah law but by rabbinic law.</b> Why, then, is he liable to receive lashes? The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> does it mean <b>that</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>says</b> that he <b>is flogged?</b> This means that he is flogged <b>by rabbinic law,</b> a punishment known as lashes for rebelliousness, for disobeying a rabbinic decree.
