### Part 1
The phrase <b>“or for his mother”</b> serves <b>as a verbal analogy, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It states <b>with regard to a nazirite:</b> “He shall not become defiled for them when they die” (Numbers 6:7), which indicates: It is only <b>when</b> his relatives <b>die</b> that <b>he may not become impure</b> for them. <b>However, he may become impure for their leprosy and for their emission of a <i>zav</i>,</b> i.e., a nazirite is not forbidden to contract those forms of ritual impurity. <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>to a nazirite,</b> the subject of this verse. <b>From where</b> do I derive that this applies <b>to a High Priest</b> as well?

### Part 2
<b>You</b> can <b>say</b> as follows: The verse need <b>not say “his mother” with regard to a High Priest, as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this, <b>since</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> derived <b><i>a fortiori</i>: And if in a case where a common priest becomes impure to</b> bury <b>his paternal brother, a High Priest may not become impure</b> even <b>to</b> bury <b>his father,</b> then <b>in a case where a common priest may not become impure to</b> bury <b>his maternal brother,</b> who is not considered a relative with regard to impurity, <b>is it not logical that a High Priest may not become impure to</b> bury <b>his mother</b> herself?

### Part 3
<b>And if you have successfully</b> derived this <i>halakha</i> <b>from the</b> <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “his mother” with regard to a High Priest?</b> It is <b>free to</b> teach a novel <i>halakha</i>, and one can <b>compare and learn a verbal analogy from it</b> as fol-lows: <b>It is stated “his mother” with regard to a nazirite</b> (Numbers 6:7), <b>and it is stated “his mother” with regard to a High Priest</b> (Leviticus 21:11).

### Part 4
The Gemara explains: <b>Just as</b> the phrase <b>“his mother” stated with regard to a nazirite</b> teaches that <b>in</b> his parents’ <b>death he may not become impure</b> to bury them <b>but he may become impure for their leprosy and for their emission of a <i>zav</i>,</b> as a nazirite is not prohibited from contracting these impurities, <b>so too,</b> the phrase <b>“his mother” stated with regard to a High Priest</b> means that <b>in</b> his parents’ <b>death he may not become impure, but he may become impure for their leprosy and for their emission of a <i>zav</i>.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara clarifies: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a High Priest</b> must become impure for a <i>met mitzva</i>; <b>from where do we</b> derive that <b>a nazirite</b> is likewise obligated? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is stated with regard to a nazirite: <b>“All the days that he consecrated himself to the Lord he shall not come near to a dead body [<i>nefesh met</i>]”</b> (Numbers 6:6).

### Part 6
<b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> from this verse that a nazirite is prohibited from coming near all bodies, <b>including even the body of an animal, similar to that which is stated:</b> “And <b>he who smites the body [<i>nefesh</i>] of an animal”</b> (Leviticus 24:18). Therefore, <b>the verse states: “He shall not come near to a dead body,”</b> employing the dual term <i>nefesh met</i>, which indicates that <b>the verse is speaking of the body of a person. Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> This exposition <b>is unnecessary, as</b> the verse <b>states: “He shall not come near,”</b> indicating that <b>the verse is speaking</b> only <b>of bodies that render</b> people and items <b>ritually impure through going in,</b> i.e., entering. In other words, the verse is referring solely to corpses. Entering into a tent in which the corpse is contained renders one impure. By contrast, an animal carcass imparts impurity only by means of contact and carrying.

### Part 7
In any case, once it has been derived that a nazirite is prohibited from becoming impure to bury any person, both relatives and non-relatives, the passage “he shall not become defiled <b>for his father, or for his mother”</b> (Numbers 6:7) is available to teach another <i>halakha</i>, that it is for only them that a nazirite <b>may not become impure, but he may become impure to</b> bury <b>a <i>met mitzva</i>.</b>

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> asks: Even <b>if</b> the verse <b>had not stated</b> this <i>halakha</i>, <b>I have</b> a way of deriving it <b>by right,</b> i.e., logically, with an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>And if a High Priest, whose sanctity is permanent, may become ritually impure to</b> bury <b>a <i>met mitzva</i>,</b> then in the case of <b>a nazirite, whose sanctity is not permanent, is it not logical that he may become impure to</b> bury <b>a <i>met mitzva</i></b> as well?

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> rejects this inference: <b>No; if you say</b> that this is true <b>with regard to a High Priest, who does not bring an offering for his impurity, shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the case <b>with regard to a nazirite, who does bring an offering for his impurity? Since</b> a nazirite <b>brings an offering for his impurity,</b> perhaps he should <b>not become impure to</b> bury <b>a <i>met mitzva</i>?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “He shall not become defiled for his father, or for his mother”</b> (Numbers 6:7). <b>However,</b> he does <b>become impure to</b> bury <b>a <i>met mitzva</i>.</b>

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> suggests: <b>Or</b> perhaps one should expound this verse differently: <b>He may not become impure to</b> bury <b>his father or for his mother; however, he may become impure to</b> bury <b>other dead people.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>You</b> can <b>say</b> that this argument can be refuted <b><i>a fortiori</i>: And if a common priest, who becomes impure to</b> bury his <b>relatives,</b> nevertheless <b>may not become impure to</b> bury <b>other dead people</b> (see Leviticus 21:1–2), then in the case of <b>a nazirite, who may not become impure to</b> bury his <b>relatives, is it not logical that</b> also <b>he should not become impure to</b> bury <b>other dead people?</b>
