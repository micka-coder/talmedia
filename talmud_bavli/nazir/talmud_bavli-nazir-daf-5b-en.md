### Part 1
<b>And bar Padda</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that although some of these verses are required for an exposition, is <b>there not</b> at least <b>one of them that is not</b> used <b>for an exposition? Rather, since that</b> usage of the term nazirite is stated <b>to</b> indicate <b>the number</b> of days in an unspecified term of naziriteship, <b>all of</b> the other usages of the term <b>are also</b> stated <b>to</b> indicate <b>the number</b> of days in an unspecified term of naziriteship in addition to the specific <i>halakhot</i> that are derived from them.

### Part 2
The Gemara analyzes the opinions of Rav Mattana and bar Padda in light of the mishna and relevant <i>baraitot</i>. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: An <b>unspecified naziriteship</b> lasts for <b>thirty days. Granted,</b> according <b>to Rav Mattana</b> it <b>works out well. However, according to bar Padda</b> it is <b>difficult,</b> since in his opinion the mishna should have stated that an unspecified naziriteship lasts for twenty-nine days.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>Bar Padda</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> The principal days of naziriteship are twenty-nine days. However, <b>since there is the thirtieth day, when</b> the nazirite <b>shaves</b> his hair <b>and brings his offerings,</b> and the prohibitions of naziriteship remain in effect on that day until he has brought these offerings, <b>due to that</b> reason the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that an unspecified naziriteship lasts for <b>thirty</b> days.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (16a): <b>One who said: I am hereby a nazirite, shaves</b> his hair on <b>the thirty-first day. Granted,</b> according <b>to Rav Mattana</b> this <b>works out well,</b> since one must finish his term of naziriteship, which lasts for thirty days, before he can shave his hair. <b>However,</b> according <b>to bar Padda,</b> it is <b>difficult.</b> Why doesnâ€™t he shave his hair on the thirtieth day?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>Bar Padda</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of that mishna: <b>If he shaved</b> his hair <b>on the thirtieth day, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. This indicates that the naziriteship itself lasts only twenty-nine days. <b>Rather, the latter clause</b> of that mishna certainly <b>supports his</b> opinion. As for <b>the first clause,</b> the reason a nazirite must wait until the thirty-first day in order to shave his hair <i>ab initio</i> is as follows: Since one who specifies that he is becoming a nazirite for thirty complete days may shave his hair only on the thirty-first day, the Sages ruled that even one who did not specify a time period <b>becomes like one who said</b> explicitly that he will be a nazirite for thirty <b>complete</b> days. Consequently, he may shave his hair <i>ab initio</i> only after thirty days have passed.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And for Rav Mattana, the latter clause</b> of the mishna is <b>difficult,</b> since it states that one who shaves his hair on the thirtieth day has fulfilled his obligation, whereas Rav Mattana claims that his naziriteship is not yet complete at that time. The Gemara answers: He <b>holds</b> that the legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that <b>of an entire</b> day. Although the term of naziriteship is thirty days, once the thirtieth day begins it is as though it has been completed, and a nazirite who shaves his hair on that day has fulfilled his obligation.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks further: <b>We learned</b> in that same mishna: In the case of one who says: <b>I am hereby a nazirite</b> for <b>thirty days, if he shaved</b> his hair on the <b>thirtieth day, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. This appears to contradict the opinion of Rav Mattana, who holds that part of the day is like an entire day. The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to</b> one who <b>says</b> that he will be a nazirite for thirty <b>complete</b> days, in which case he certainly does not fulfill his obligation by shaving his hair on the thirtieth day itself.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks further: <b>We learned</b> in that mishna: <b>One who accepted two</b> terms of <b>naziriteship shaves</b> his hair for <b>the first</b> naziriteship on the <b>thirty-first day, and</b> he shaves his hair for <b>the second</b> term <b>on the sixty-first day. Granted,</b> according <b>to Rav Mattana</b> this <b>works out well,</b> since he shaves his head for the first naziriteship after a full thirty days have passed. The second term of naziriteship then commences on that day, which is the thirty-first day since he took his vows. He then shaves for the second time on the thirty-first day of his second naziriteship, which is the sixty-first day since he took his vows.
