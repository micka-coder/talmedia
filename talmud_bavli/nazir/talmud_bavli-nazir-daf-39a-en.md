### Part 1
Rav Pappa himself <b>raised</b> his <b>objection to</b> Abaye’s opinion based on the premise that the <i>tanna</i> taught <b>five</b> sets of lashes, <b>and since</b> in the <i>baraita</i> it <b>is not taught five</b> sets of lashes, <b>what is the reason</b> that Rav Pappa <b>raised</b> his <b>objection to</b> Abaye’s opinion? <b>Rav Pappa said: I held</b> that <b>it is not a tradition in</b> Abaye’s <b>hand</b> that a nazirite is also flogged for “anything that is made of the grapevine,” but merely his own opinion, <b>and</b> therefore I assumed that were I to cite a <i>baraita</i> that explicitly contradicts his opinion <b>he</b> would <b>retract</b> his opinion. Consequently, I myself changed the wording of the <i>baraita</i> to see how Abaye would respond. <b>But I did not know that</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is a tradition in</b> Abaye’s <b>hand and</b> that therefore <b>he did not</b> retract his opinion.

### Part 2
§ The mishna taught: <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says:</b> He is liable only if he eats at least two <i>ḥartzannim</i> and one <i>zag</i> that together form the volume of an olive-bulk. The mishna then cites two opinions as to whether <i>ḥartzan</i> is a grape seed and <i>zag</i> is the skin, or the reverse. <b>Rav Yosef said: In accordance with whose</b> opinion do <b>we translate</b> the verse “from <i>ḥartzannim</i> to <i>zag</i>” (Numbers 6:4) as: <b>From the seeds [<i>purtzanin</i>] to the skins [<i>itzurin</i>]?</b> He explains: This translation is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A naziriteship</b> of <b>unspecified</b> length lasts for <b>thirty days.</b> If a nazirite <b>shaved</b> his hair during that period, <b>or if he was shaved by bandits [<i>listim</i>]</b> against his will, this <b>negates thirty days</b> of his naziriteship, which he must count afresh. With regard to <b>a nazirite who shaved</b> his hair, <b>whether</b> he did so <b>with scissors or with a razor, or</b> if he <b>pulled out [<i>sifsef</i> ] any amount,</b> he <b>is liable.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does <b>this hair</b> that grows on the body <b>grow from the bottom or from the top?</b> Which part of the hair is new? The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is the <b>difference</b> between these possibilities? The Gemara answers: It is relevant for the case <b>of a nazirite who was shaved by bandits</b> or shaved himself, <b>but</b> his head was not entirely shaved. Rather, <b>they left</b> part <b>of it,</b> so that the hair is long <b>enough to bend its end to its root.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara explains the two sides of the dilemma: <b>If you say</b> that hair <b>grows from the bottom, he has removed</b> the hair of <b>the naziriteship,</b> which is the hair he vowed not to shave, and therefore he must add extra days to his term of naziriteship to allow for its proper growth. <b>But if you say that</b> it <b>grows from the top, that</b> hair <b>which he sanctified still exists</b> in part. Consequently, he may conclude his naziriteship and perform the mitzva of shaving.

### Part 6
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to this dilemma <b>from</b> an examination of <b>this live louse [<i>inba</i>], which is</b> always <b>found in the root of the hair. And if it should enter your mind</b> that hair <b>grows from the bottom,</b> the louse <b>should be situated on the end of the hair,</b> as it would be pushed up with the hair’s growth. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Actually,</b> one could say that hair <b>grows from the bottom, and because it is alive the louse continuously descends,</b> as it is always crawling toward the scalp from where it draws its nourishment.

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> from the fact that <b>a dead louse is</b> invariably <b>found on the end of the hair. And if it should enter your mind</b> that hair <b>grows from on top,</b> it <b>should be situated on the root of the hair.</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>There too,</b> one could say that <b>because it has no strength it is caught</b> where it was when it died <b>and goes</b> up with the growing hair.

### Part 8
The Gemara proposes a different proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear from</b> an examination of <b>the long hair [<i>belorit</i>] of gentiles,</b> which is grown for idolatrous purposes, by braiding the ends of the hair. <b>As, after they braid it, it becomes loose underneath,</b> which suggests that hair grows from below. The Gemara rejects this: <b>There too, since it crumples from</b> the effect of the person who <b>lies</b> upon it, <b>it becomes loose</b> underneath.

### Part 9
The Gemara offers an additional suggestion: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> from <b>the dye</b> used on sheep, <b>as the</b> dyed <b>wool becomes loose underneath.</b> This shows that hair grows from the bottom. The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> this case of dyeing sheep is not merely anecdotal, as it <b>was taught</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of animal tithe. <b>And furthermore, when old men dye their beards,</b> we see that the beards <b>turn white</b>
