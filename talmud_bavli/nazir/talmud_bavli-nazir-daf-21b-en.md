### Part 1
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> against this. If one said: <b>My hand is a nazirite, and</b> similarly, if he said: <b>My foot is a nazirite, he has not said anything</b> of consequence. However, if he said: <b>My head is a nazirite,</b> or: <b>My liver is a nazirite, he is a nazirite. This is the principle:</b> If one accepted naziriteship by means of <b>an entity upon which life depends,</b> i.e., a limb or a body part that he cannot survive without, <b>he is a nazirite.</b> Conversely, if he mentioned part of the body that is not essential for life, he is not a nazirite. In this case, as he referred to his hair, which is certainly not a vital part of him, he should not be a nazirite.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that it means <b>that he said like this;</b> this is what he intended: <b>Let my mouth be like his mouth</b> with regard to abstention <b>from wine, and my hair</b> be <b>like his hair</b> with regard to abstention <b>from cutting</b> it.

### Part 3
§ The mishna taught that if a woman said: <b>I am hereby a nazirite, and her husband heard and said: And I, he cannot nullify</b> her vow. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: When <b>a husband</b> nullifies the vow of his wife, does he <b>uproot</b> his wife’s vow, making it as though she never vowed, <b>or perhaps</b> he merely <b>severs</b> her vow from that point onward, but her vow was still in effect until he nullified it? The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is there</b> resulting from this dilemma?

### Part 4
The Gemara explains that the difference is <b>with regard to a woman who vowed to be a nazirite, and another</b> woman <b>heard and said: And I, and the husband of the first</b> woman <b>heard and nullified her</b> vow. <b>If you say</b> that the husband <b>uproots</b> the vow entirely, the vow of <b>that</b> second woman should <b>also be dissolved,</b> as she associated herself with a non-existent vow. <b>And if you say</b> he <b>severs</b> it from this point, the vow of his wife <b>is dissolved,</b> but the <b>other</b> woman remains <b>bound</b> by her vow, as the first vow was intact when she associated herself with it. <b>What,</b> then, is the answer to this dilemma?

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the statement of the mishna: If she said: <b>I am hereby a nazirite, and her husband heard and said: And I, he cannot nullify</b> her vow. <b>And if it should enter your mind</b> that the <b>husband severs</b> the vow from that moment onward, <b>let him nullify</b> the vow <b>for his wife and he will</b> remain <b>bound</b> by his vow, since if the vow is not nullified retroactively, her vow was intact when he associated himself with it. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the mishna that <b>the husband uproots</b> the vow entirely, which means he would also uproot his own vow by nullifying hers, and that is why he is unable do so?

### Part 6
The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>No; actually,</b> one can say that the husband <b>severs</b> the vow from that point onward. <b>And</b> if there were no other points to consider, <b>by right</b> the mishna should have taught <b>that he can nullify</b> her vow <b>for her; and this is the reason why he cannot nullify</b> it: <b>Since he said to her: And I,</b> he is <b>considered like one who said: It is upheld for you,</b> and once a husband has upheld his wife’s vow he can no longer nullify it. Consequently, <b>if he requested</b> to have <b>his upholding</b> dissolved by a Sage, <b>he can nullify</b> her vow, <b>and if not, he cannot nullify</b> it. Consequently, the ruling of the mishna does not resolve the dilemma.

### Part 7
The Gemara cites another mishna (24a): <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> With regard to <b>a woman who vowed to be a nazirite and separated her animal</b> for this purpose (see Numbers 6:13–14), <b>and afterward her husband nullified her</b> vow, which means that she is no longer obligated to bring an offering, <b>if the animal was his,</b> which he had given to her, it is as though it were never consecrated at all, and <b>it shall go out and graze among</b> the <b>flock</b> like a regular, non-consecrated animal, until it becomes blemished. <b>And if the animal was hers,</b> and it was designated for <b>a sin-offering, it must</b> be placed in isolation for it to <b>die,</b> in accordance with the general <i>halakha</i> that a sin-offering that may not be sacrificed must be left to die.

### Part 8
The Gemara explains the difficulty from this mishna: <b>And if it should enter your mind</b> that <b>the husband uproots</b> the vow, the sin-offering should <b>be released as a non-sacred</b> animal, in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of a sin-offering of a nazirite whose vow was nullified (31a). <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the mishna that <b>the husband</b> merely <b>severs</b> the vow, which means that she was a nazirite when she separated the animal, and therefore it is consecrated?

### Part 9
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that the <b>husband uproots</b> the vow, <b>and this is the reason</b> for the above ruling: <b>Since she requires no atonement,</b> as the vow is no longer in effect, this animal <b>is</b> treated <b>as a sin-offering whose owners have died, and</b> it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that a sin-offering whose owners have died must</b> be left to <b>die.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara continues to cite relevant sources. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following mishna (23a): With regard to <b>a woman who vowed to be a nazirite and</b> nevertheless <b>was drinking wine and rendering herself ritually impure</b> by contact <b>with the dead, she incurs the forty</b> lashes for violating a Torah prohibition. The Gemara analyzes this mishna: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If we say that</b> her <b>husband did not nullify her</b> vow, <b>need this be said</b> that she is liable to receive lashes? After all, every nazirite who transgresses their vow incurs lashes.

### Part 11
<b>Rather,</b> it <b>is obvious</b> that the <b>husband nullified her</b> vow. <b>And if it should enter your mind</b> that the <b>husband uproots</b> his wife’s vow, <b>why</b> does <b>she incur the forty</b> lashes? It is as though she never vowed at all. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the mishna that the <b>husband severs</b> the vow, and therefore she is liable for her earlier transgression?

### Part 12
The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that the <b>husband uproots</b> the vow, <b>and</b> the reason that the mishna teaches in this manner is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If the <b>husband nullified her</b> vow <b>and she did not know, and she was drinking wine and rendering herself ritually impure</b> by contact <b>with the dead, she does not incur the forty</b> lashes, despite her intention to sin, as she did not commit a transgression in practice.
