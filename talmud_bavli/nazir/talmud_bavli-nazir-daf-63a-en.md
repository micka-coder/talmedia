### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a nazirite who shaved</b> for the conclusion of his naziriteship, <b>and it</b> later <b>became known to him that</b> during his naziriteship <b>he was ritually impure</b> from a corpse, <b>if</b> it was <b>a known impurity,</b> i.e., people were aware of the impurity when he became impure, <b>he negates</b> his entire naziriteship. <b>And if it was ritual impurity</b> imparted by a grave <b>in the depths,</b> one that was unknown at the time, <b>he does not negate</b> his naziriteship. <b>If</b> he discovered he was impure <b>before he shaved, he negates</b> his naziriteship <b>in either case.</b>

### Part 2
The mishna asks: <b>How</b> does one differentiate between a known and an unknown impurity? If a nazirite <b>descended to immerse in a cave, and a corpse was found floating at the mouth of the cave,</b> he is <b>impure,</b> as an openly visible corpse is a known impurity. What, then, is an impurity of the depths? This is referring to a case where the corpse <b>was found sunk into the ground of the cave</b> in such a manner that it was unknown.

### Part 3
However, even here the circumstances of the case must be taken into account. If one <b>descended</b> not descend to immerse himself in the water, as he was ritually pure, but <b>to cool</b> himself, he remains <b>pure.</b> If he was impure and entered the water <b>to purify himself from the impurity from a corpse,</b> he is <b>impure.</b> The reason is that something <b>that</b> has <b>the presumptive status of impurity</b> remains <b>impure, and</b> something that has <b>the presumptive status of purity</b> is <b>pure, as there is a basis for the matter.</b> It is reasonable that items or people retain their presumptive status.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that there is a difference between known and unknown impurity? <b>Rabbi Eliezer said that the verse states</b> with regard to a nazirite: <b>“And if any man shall die very suddenly beside him”</b> (Numbers 6:9). The emphasis provided by the term <b>“beside him”</b> indicates <b>that</b> it is <b>clear to him</b> that he has become impure. However, one is not impure if the presence of the corpse is unknown.

### Part 5
<b>Reish Lakish said</b> a different source: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: “Any man of you <b>who shall be ritually impure due to a corpse or on a road far away”</b> (Numbers 9:10). The word “road” is juxtaposed in the verse to the term “ritually impure,” indicating that the impurity is <b>like a road. Just as a road is in the open, so too, every</b> impurity is <b>in the open.</b> It must be a known impurity.

### Part 6
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> consider <b>that which we learned</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Zavim</i> 2:9): <b>Which is the ritual impurity</b> imparted by a grave <b>in the depths?</b> It is impurity imparted by <b>any</b> corpse <b>of which no one is aware,</b> even <b>at the end of the earth.</b> This type of impurity is permitted for both a nazirite and one who sacrifices the Paschal offering. <b>However,</b> if even <b>one</b> person <b>is aware of it,</b> even <b>at the end of the earth, this is not impurity</b> imparted by a grave <b>in the depths.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara states its question: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the verse that states that ritual impurity is <b>like a road,</b> it is <b>fine,</b> as an item known to someone in the world can be compared to a road. <b>However, according to the one who says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the term “beside him,” i.e., it is referring <b>to</b> an impurity that is <b>clear to him, if one</b> person <b>at the</b> other <b>end of the earth is aware of</b> this impurity, <b>what of it?</b> It was unknown to the nazirite himself.

### Part 8
<b>And furthermore,</b> consider <b>that which is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Zavim</i> 2:8): In the case of <b>one who finds a corpse lying</b> across <b>the width of a road,</b> i.e., it had been buried there in such a way that it was impossible for the passerby to avoid becoming impure by passing over the corpse, then <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>,</b> the passerby is <b>impure.</b> Therefore, if he is a priest, he may not eat <i>teruma</i>. However, <b>with regard to</b> both being <b>a nazirite and</b> being <b>one performing</b> the ritual of <b>the Paschal offering,</b> the passerby is <b>pure. What is different</b> about these situations? <b>Rather,</b> it must be that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>impurity</b> imparted by a grave <b>in the depths is learned as a tradition</b> and not from the verses, which are cited merely in support.

### Part 9
§ The mishna taught that <b>if</b> a nazirite discovered he was ritually impure <b>before he shaved,</b> he negates his naziriteship even if he was rendered impure by impurity of the depths. The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this opinion? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: It is Rabbi Eliezer, who says</b> that <b>shaving is indispensable</b> to the completion of one’s naziriteship. Consequently, if he discovered he was impure before he shaved, he became impure during his naziriteship, and he negates the period he has observed.

### Part 10
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raised a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who <b>became impure during the full term</b> of the regular days of his naziriteship <b>but</b> his impurity <b>became known to him</b> only <b>after the full term</b> but before he shaved? Perhaps <b>we go</b> according to his <b>knowledge, and it is</b> a case of <b>knowledge after the full term, or</b> perhaps the <i>halakha</i> is <b>not</b> determined by the time of his awareness but by the actual time of the impurity, which occurred during his naziriteship. The Gemara adds: <b>And with regard to what</b> issue was this dilemma raised? It was <b>with regard to</b> his possible <b>negation</b> of the period he observed as a nazirite: Does he negate his naziriteship, or is he considered to have contracted impurity after the completion of his term, in which case he need not start his naziriteship afresh?
