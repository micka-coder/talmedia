### Part 1
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who said: I am hereby a nazirite, and another heard</b> him <b>and waited the time required for speaking</b> a short phrase <b>and</b> then <b>said: And I,</b> the first person <b>is bound</b> by his vow <b>and the other is permitted,</b> as too much time passed between their respective vows. <b>And how much</b> time is <b>the time required for speaking?</b> It is the time necessary <b>for a student</b> to <b>inquire</b> after <b>the welfare</b> of his <b>rabbi.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say that</b> the mishna <b>supports</b> Reish Lakish’s opinion? As it is taught: In the case of <b>one who said: I am hereby a nazirite, and another heard him and said: And I,</b> and a third person heard him and said: <b>And I,</b> they are all nazirites. The mishna mentions: And I, twice <b>and no more,</b> which indicates that only two people can associate themselves with the vow of the first one. The reason for this must be because too much time has passed since the first person spoke. The Gemara rejects this argument: This is no proof, as <b>should the <i>tanna</i> have continued reckoning</b> cases <b>like a peddler,</b> who announces his wares over and over again, by repeating: And I, and I, over and over again?

### Part 3
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> if the <i>tanna</i> wishes to be concise, <b>let him teach</b> only <b>one</b> example, <b>and teach us these</b> other cases of others who say: And I, by means of a single example. The Gemara answers: <b>Indeed,</b> this is in fact correct, <b>but because</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches in the latter clause:</b> If the vow of <b>the first was dissolved</b> by a halakhic authority then <b>they are all dissolved,</b> but if the vow of <b>the last</b> individual <b>was dissolved</b> by a halakhic authority then the vow of <b>the last</b> individual <b>is dissolved and all</b> the others remain <b>bound</b> by their vow, one may conclude <b>by inference that there is a middle</b> person between the first and the last. <b>And due to that</b> reason the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: And I, and I,</b> so that the case would include three people, but not because a fourth person is unable to associate himself with the vow of the first in the same manner.

### Part 4
With regard to the same issue, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does each <b>one</b> take a vow by <b>associating</b> himself <b>with</b> the vow of <b>the other,</b> i.e., the individual who spoke immediately before him, <b>or perhaps they</b> all <b>associate</b> themselves <b>with</b> the vow of <b>the first</b> one? The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is there?</b> The Gemara answers that the difference is whether an unlimited number of people <b>can continue to associate</b> themselves with the vows. <b>If you say</b> that each <b>one associates</b> himself <b>with</b> the vow of <b>the other</b> who spoke immediately before him, others can <b>continue to associate</b> themselves with these vows <b>forever,</b> provided that they each do so immediately after the previous individual. <b>And if you say they</b> all <b>associate</b> themselves <b>with</b> the vow of <b>the first</b> one, <b>they may not associate</b> themselves with the vow if <b>more</b> time has elapsed <b>than</b> the time <b>required for speaking</b> a short phrase since the vow of the first individual. <b>What</b> is the answer to this dilemma?

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: With regard to one who said: <b>I am hereby a nazirite, and another heard</b> this vow <b>and said: And I,</b> and a third person added: <b>And I,</b> they are all nazirites. The mishna mentions only two individuals who associated themselves with the initial vow, <b>and no more. Learn from this that they</b> all <b>associated</b> themselves <b>with</b> the vow of <b>the first</b> one, <b>as, if it should enter your mind</b> that each <b>one associates</b> himself <b>with</b> the vow of <b>the other</b> who came immediately before, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach: And I, many</b> times. The Gemara answers as before: This is no proof, as <b>should the <i>tanna</i> have continued reckoning</b> cases <b>like a peddler?</b> It was enough for him to state: And I, twice.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the <i>tanna</i> wished to avoid repeating: And I, so many times, <b>let him teach</b> it only <b>once, and we</b> would <b>learn</b> that <b>they</b> are <b>all</b> nazirites based on that example. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> in the latter clause: If the vow of <b>the first was dissolved</b> by a halakhic authority then <b>they are all dissolved,</b> but if the vow of <b>the last</b> individual <b>was dissolved</b> by a halakhic authority then the vow of <b>the last</b> individual <b>is dissolved and all</b> the others remain <b>bound</b> by their vows, one may conclude <b>by inference that there is a middle</b> person between the first and the last. It is <b>due to that</b> reason that the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: And I, and I,</b> so that the case would include three people, but not because a fourth person is unable to associate himself with the vow of the first in the same manner.

### Part 7
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: If the vow of <b>the first</b> individual <b>was dissolved, they are all dissolved.</b> This indicates that <b>it is</b> only if the <b>first</b> one was <b>dissolved</b> that they are all considered dissolved. <b>However,</b> if the vow of the <b>middle</b> person was dissolved, <b>no,</b> the vows of the individuals following him are not considered dissolved. <b>Learn from this</b> that they all <b>associated</b> themselves <b>with</b> the vow of <b>the first</b> one.

### Part 8
The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>actually, each associates</b> himself <b>with</b> the vow of <b>the other</b> who immediately preceded him, and therefore if the vow of the middle person was dissolved, the vows of all those who came after him are also dissolved. <b>But since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>wanted to teach: They are all dissolved,</b> and <b>had he taught</b> the case where the vow of <b>the middle</b> individual was dissolved, he would have had to state that <b>there is</b> still the vow of the <b>first</b> individual <b>that is not dissolved,</b> because his vow is not dependent on that of the middle one. <b>Due to that</b> reason the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the case where the vow of the <b>first one</b> was dissolved. Consequently, no proof can be brought from here.

### Part 9
The Gemara suggests another proof from the mishna: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> If <b>the last was dissolved, the last is dissolved and they are all bound</b> by their vows. It can be inferred from here that only in that case is the vow of the last one alone dissolved, <b>as he is not followed by anyone. However,</b> if the dissolved vow was of the <b>middle one, who is followed by someone else,</b> the vow of the last one who comes after him <b>is</b> also <b>dissolved.</b> One can <b>learn from this</b> that each <b>one associates</b> himself <b>with</b> the vow of <b>the other</b> individual.

### Part 10
The Gemara rejects this claim as well: <b>Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you that they</b> all <b>associate</b> themselves <b>with</b> the vow of <b>the first</b> one, <b>and what is</b> the meaning of: The <b>last one, that</b> the mishna <b>teaches?</b> It means <b>the middle</b> one, the dissolution of whose vow does not cause the vow of the person who followed him to be dissolved. <b>And</b> why is the middle one called the last one? <b>Since</b> the <i>tanna</i> earlier <b>taught: First,</b> here <b>he taught: Last,</b> despite the fact that he is referring to the middle one.

### Part 11
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>explicitly:</b> If <b>the first</b> one <b>is dissolved, they are all dissolved;</b> if <b>the last</b> one <b>is dissolved, the last</b> one <b>is dissolved and they are all bound</b> by their vows. <b>If</b> the <b>middle</b> one <b>is dissolved,</b> the vows of anyone <b>from him and after</b> him <b>are dissolved;</b> those who vowed <b>from him and before</b> him are <b>bound</b> by their vows. One can <b>learn from this</b> that <b>each associates</b> himself with the vow of <b>the other</b> individual. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from this</b> that it is so.

### Part 12
§ The mishna taught that one stated: <b>I am hereby a nazirite, and</b> if <b>another heard and said, my mouth is like his mouth, and my hair is like his hair,</b> he is a nazirite. The Gemara asks: Just <b>because he said: My mouth is like his mouth and my hair is like his hair,</b> is <b>he a nazirite?</b>
