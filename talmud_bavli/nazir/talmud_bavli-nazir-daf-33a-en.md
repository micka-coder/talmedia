### Part 1
<b>Abaye said:</b> One must correct his understanding of the mishna, so that it deals with a situation <b>where</b> in addition to his first statement <b>he said: Even if it is not so-and-so, I shall be a nazirite. And what is</b> the meaning of the phrase: Whose <b>statement was not fulfilled?</b> It means: <b>His first statement was not fulfilled,</b> as it was not that person; <b>rather,</b> he is a nazirite because <b>his last statement</b> was fulfilled.

### Part 2
ยง The mishna taught that if the individual walking toward them <b>turned back,</b> so that his identity remained unknown, <b>not</b> one of them is <b>a nazirite.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>The reason is</b> only <b>because he turned back,</b> from which it may be inferred that if that person <b>comes before us</b> and is identified, the one who said he would be a nazirite if it is so-and-so <b>is</b> considered to be <b>a nazirite.</b> The Gemara inquires: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this <i>halakha</i>? <br>This <i>amud</i> has no Gemara text, as in the classic Vilna layout it is entirely filled with the commentary of <i>Tosafot</i>.
