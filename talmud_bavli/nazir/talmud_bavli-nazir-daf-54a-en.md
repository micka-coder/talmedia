### Part 1
<b>As the Master said: Ritual impurity</b> in a sealed grave <b>breaks through</b> and <b>ascends and breaks through and descends,</b> so that the grave imparts impurity like the corpse itself. <b>While with regard to contact</b> with these sources of impurity, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse <b>“and</b> upon <b>him that touched a bone, or the slain,</b> or the dead, or the grave” (Numbers 19:18) is expounded as follows: <b>“A bone”; this is a bone that is a barley-grain</b>-<b>bulk. “Or the slain”; this is a limb slain,</b> i.e., severed, <b>from the living, which does not contain</b> enough flesh <b>for it to heal.</b>

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> continues its interpretation of the verse. <b>“Or the dead”; this is a limb slain from a corpse,</b> which is not covered by enough flesh for it to heal were he alive. <b>“Or the grave”; Reish Lakish said: This is a grave</b> that contained a corpse from <b>before</b> the time <b>the command</b> of these <i>halakhot</i> was given to the Jewish people. These graves render people and items ritually impure by contact, but do not carry the <i>halakhot</i> of impurity imparted in a tent.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>this limb from a corpse,</b> which is listed above as imparting ritual impurity by contact, <b>what are the circumstances</b> of the case? <b>If</b> the limb <b>contains a bone that is a barley-grain</b>-<b>bulk, this is</b> included in the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one who touches a bone,</b> and it was already taught that a bone imparts impurity by contact. <b>Rather,</b> it must be <b>that it does not contain a bone that is a barley-grain</b>-<b>bulk, and even so the Merciful One includes it</b> in the <i>halakhot</i> of impurity, despite the fact that it does not contain enough flesh. This indicates that a nazirite shaves for a limb of this kind, in accordance with the opinion of Reish Lakish.

### Part 4
The Gemara responds: In answer to this proof of Reish Lakish, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said to you: Actually,</b> you should explain <b>that it does contain</b> a bone the volume of a barley-grain-bulk, <b>and if it does not</b> need to refer to <b>the matter of its contact,</b> as the verse explicitly states: “Anyone who touches a bone,” <b>have it refer to the matter of its carrying,</b> i.e., that one who carries it is also rendered ritually impure.

### Part 5
§ The mishna taught with regard to any nazirite who became impure from one of the listed sources of impurity: <b>And</b> a priest <b>sprinkles</b> the ashes of the red heifer on him <b>on the third and on the seventh</b> days, <b>and he negates</b> all the previous days he counted toward his naziriteship, and he does not begin counting a fresh term of naziriteship until after he becomes pure and brings his offerings.

### Part 6
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: What is the meaning of <b>that which is taught</b> that a nazirite does not start counting <b>until he is purified?</b> Does the mishna refer to one who is <b>standing on the seventh</b> day of his purification and mean: <b>Until</b> he <b>performs</b> the requisite waiting for <b>sunset? And whose</b> opinion is it? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who rules that a nazirite starts counting from the eighth day, even before he brings his offerings. <b>Or perhaps</b> it is referring to one who is <b>standing on the eighth</b> day. <b>And</b> then, <b>what</b> is the meaning of: <b>Until he is purified?</b> It means: <b>Until he brings his offerings. And who is</b> the author of this opinion? <b>It is the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that he begins his fresh period of naziriteship only after he has sacrificed his offering of impurity (see 18b).

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of this dilemma <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it teaches in the latter clause</b> of the next mishna that a nazirite who does not have to bring an offering <b>starts counting immediately</b> after the conclusion of his seven days of purification. The Gemara infers from this mishna: If so, <b>what is</b> the meaning of the different term used in <b>the first clause: Until he is purified?</b> It means <b>until he brings his offerings, and whose</b> opinion is it? <b>It is</b> that of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that the <b>naziriteship of purity does not commence until the eighth</b> day.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The previous mishna listed the sources of ritual impurity for which a nazirite must shave. This mishna adds: <b>However,</b> the nazirite does not shave for these: <b>The hanging</b> branches over a corpse, i.e., a tree overhanging a body that a nazirite passes, but it is uncertain which branches are over a corpse; <b>and the projecting</b> stones from fences when the place of the impurity is unknown; <b>and a <i>beit haperas</i>,</b> a place that contained a grave and was plowed. In the latter case, the entire area around the grave is impure from a corpse due to an uncertainty, as it might contain human bones.

### Part 9
The mishna continues its list: <b>And the land of the nations,</b> i.e., a nazirite left Eretz Yisrael for another land. The Sages decreed that all land outside of Eretz Yisrael is ritually impure. <b>And the grave cover; and the grave walls</b> upon which the cover rests; <b>and a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of blood</b> from a corpse; <b>and a tent; and a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of bones</b> of a corpse; <b>and vessels that are touching a corpse. And</b> if the nazirite is <b>in the days of his counting,</b> i.e., the seven days a leper must count after purification from his leprosy; <b>or in his days of full</b> leprosy, when he is a full-fledged leper, <b>for these the nazirite does not shave.</b> This is the case even if he is rendered impure by one of the sources listed in the previous mishna.

### Part 10
<b>And</b> in those cases listed that involve ritual impurity from a corpse, <b>one sprinkles</b> the purification water upon him <b>on the third and on the seventh</b> days of his purification,
