### Part 1
<b>who separated money for their nests</b> and then became wealthy, if the owner <b>wishes</b> to change their designation and <b>to bring an animal sin-offering with them, he may bring</b> a sin-offering with them. If he wishes to use them to buy <b>an animal burnt-offering he may bring</b> it, supplementing the required amount with other money.If the owner <b>died and he had unallocated funds,</b> they all <b>will be allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings, including the value of the sin-offering. This shows that the <i>halakha</i> that unallocated funds are used for gift offerings applies in cases other than that of a nazirite.

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>He taught</b> the case of <b>a nazirite and</b> also the case of <b>those obligated to</b> bring <b>nests, which is similar to</b> that of a nazirite and is therefore treated identically with regard to its <i>halakha</i>. This serves <b>to exclude that</b> case <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. The situation discussed in the <i>baraita</i> involves <b>one who was obligated to</b> bring <b>a sin-offering</b> for a transgression he committed, <b>and he</b> also <b>said: It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a gift <b>burnt-offering, and he separated money and said: These are hereby for my obligatory</b> offering. Since he might have meant either his obligation of the sin-offering or his burnt-offering for the new vow, the question arises as to what should be done with the money.

### Part 3
The <i>baraita</i> explains that if he <b>wishes to bring an animal sin-offering with it, he may not bring</b> one; if he wishes to use it to purchase <b>an animal burnt-offering, he may not bring</b> it either. If he <b>died and had unallocated funds,</b> one must <b>take</b> them and cast them into <b>the Dead Sea.</b> Since the two offerings are not part of the same obligation, the unallocated funds may not be used for gift offerings.

### Part 4
ยง <b>Rav Ashi said: That</b> which <b>you said</b> with regard to a nazirite who had <b>allocated</b> money, that he may <b>not</b> use it all for gift offerings because the value of the sin-offering must be taken and cast into the Dead Sea, <b>do not say that</b> this is referring only to a case where he explicitly <b>said: These are for my sin-offering, and these are for my burnt-offering, and these are for my peace-offering,</b> each one separately. <b>Rather, even</b> if <b>he said: These are for my sin-offering and for my burnt-offering and for my peace-offering, they are</b> considered <b>allocated</b> for the purposes of this <i>halakha</i>, despite the fact that he did not designate the money for particular offerings.

### Part 5
<b>And some say</b> a different version of this statement. <b>Rav Ashi said: Do not say</b> they are deemed allocated <b>only if he says: These are for my sin-offering and for my burnt-offering and for my peace-offering; rather, even if he said</b> it in broader terms: <b>These are for my obligation, they are</b> considered <b>as allocated.</b>

### Part 6
ยง <b>Rava said: That</b> which <b>we said,</b> that if one had <b>unallocated funds</b> they <b>will be allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings, applies only if the money for all of the offerings was mixed together. However, <b>if the money for the sin-offering fell</b> and was separated <b>from</b> the others, all the remaining money <b>is</b> now considered <b>as allocated.</b> This means that instead of the entire sum being used for a gift burnt-offering, part of it is used for a peace-offering, which is eaten for one day and does not require bread.
