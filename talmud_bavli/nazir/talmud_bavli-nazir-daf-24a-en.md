### Part 1
<b>she merited to precede</b> the younger daughter by <b>four generations to the monarchy of the Jewish people.</b> The descendants of Ruth the Moabite ruled over the Jewish people for four generations: Obed, Yishai, David, and Solomon, before the reign of Solomon’s son Rehoboam, whose mother was Naamah the Ammonite.

### Part 2
mishna With regard to <b>a woman who vowed to be a nazirite and separated her animals</b> for her offerings of purity at the end of her term, <b>and afterward her husband nullified her vow,</b> which means that she is not in fact a nazirite, what becomes of these animals? <b>If the animal was his, it shall go out and graze among</b> the <b>flock</b> until it becomes blemished, like regular non-consecrated animals.

### Part 3
<b>And if the animal was hers,</b> different <i>halakhot</i> apply to the various offerings: <b>The</b> animal she set aside as <b>a sin-offering must</b> be left to <b>die</b> by being shut in an enclosed area and deprived of food and water, as will be explained in the Gemara. <b>And</b> the animal separated for <b>a burnt-offering is sacrificed</b> on the altar as <b>a burnt-offering,</b> as in any case one may bring a voluntary burnt-offering. As for the one designated for <b>a peace-offering,</b> it is <b>sacrificed</b> as a voluntary <b>peace-offering. And</b> this peace-offering <b>is eaten for</b> only <b>one day,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of the nazirite’s peace-offering, despite the fact that regular peace-offerings may be eaten for two days. <b>But</b> the offering <b>does not require bread,</b> i.e., loaves and wafers, unlike that of a nazirite.

### Part 4
If <b>she had unallocated funds,</b> i.e., she had separated money for her offerings but had not stated which coins were designated for which offering, all the money <b>will be earmarked for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings. If she had <b>allocated funds,</b> i.e., she had decided which coins were for the payment of each offering, even if she had not yet purchased the animals, <b>the money for the sin-offering</b> is <b>taken</b> and cast <b>into the Dead Sea,</b> i.e., it must be destroyed, either by being thrown into the sea or by some other means. One may <b>not benefit</b> from it, as it possesses a measure of sanctity, <b>but</b> one also does <b>not misuse</b> property consecrated to the Temple <b>with it.</b> In other words, if one did derive benefit from this money he is not liable to bring an offering for misusing consecrated property.

### Part 5
As for <b>the money for the burnt-offering, a burnt-offering is brought</b> with those coins, <b>and</b> one who benefits <b>from it</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, as it is sacred since it can be used toward the purchase of a gift offering. Similarly, with regard to <b>the money for a peace-offering, a peace-offering is brought</b> with those coins, <b>and</b> it <b>is eaten for one day and does not require bread.</b>

### Part 6
gemara The Gemara inquires: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that a husband is not indebted to</b> his wife, i.e., he is not required to provide her with her obligatory offerings? It is evident that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna maintains that this is the case, as he rules that the animal does not remain sacred if it belonged to her husband. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: It is</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. As, if it should enter your mind</b> that <b>it is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, why</b> should an animal that belonged to the husband <b>go out and graze among</b> the <b>flock</b> until it becomes blemished? After all, the husband is <b>indebted</b> and required <b>to</b> give <b>her</b> the offerings she requires, which means that her consecration is valid even if she used his animals.

### Part 7
The Gemara provides the source for the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A person brings the offering of a rich</b> man <b>on behalf of his wife.</b> If a wife is obligated to bring an offering that is different depending on whether she is wealthy or poor, e.g., the offering of a childbearing woman, then even if she herself does not own enough to be considered wealthy, if her husband can afford it he must bring the offering of a rich person on her behalf.

### Part 8
<b>And similarly,</b> he brings <b>all her offerings that she is obligated</b> to bring, even those whose obligation preceded their marriage. The reason is <b>that he wrote to her</b> in her marriage contract <b>like this:</b> I accept upon myself <b>all</b> claims of <b>guarantee that you have upon me from beforehand.</b> These obligations include her offerings.

### Part 9
<b>Rava said: You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and nevertheless the husband is under no obligation if he nullified her vow. The reason is as follows: <b>When</b> is <b>he obligated</b> to bring <b>her</b> offerings? It is only <b>in</b> the case of <b>a matter that is necessary for her</b> to bring. However, <b>in</b> the case of <b>a matter that is not necessary for her</b> to bring, he is under <b>no</b> such obligation. Here, too, once he has nullified her naziriteship, she is no longer in need of this offering.

### Part 10
<b>Some say</b> a different version of this discussion: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that only a husband who nullified his wife’s vow is exempt from providing her offerings? <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>it is Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> his opinion is as follows: <b>When</b> is <b>he indebted</b> to fund <b>her</b> offerings? It is <b>in</b> the case of <b>a matter that is necessary for her</b> to bring, but <b>in</b> the case of <b>a matter that is not necessary for her</b> to bring, he is under <b>no</b> such obligation. <b>As,</b> if it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, he is not mortgaged to her</b> in this regard <b>at all.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rather, what are the circumstances</b> in which <b>he is obligated to</b> provide <b>her</b> offering, according to the opinion of the Rabbis? <b>For example, if he transferred</b> the animal <b>to her</b> possession. <b>But</b> in that case, <b>since he has transferred it to her, it is her own,</b> which means that she has effectively separated the offering from her own property. The mishna cannot be referring to this situation, as the animal does not revert to a non-sacred state in a case of this kind. Evidently, the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.
