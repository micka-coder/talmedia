### Part 1
For this reason the <i>tanna</i> <b>also taught: She incurs,</b> in <b>the first clause,</b> despite the fact that this teaches no novelty.

### Part 2
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a woman who vowed to be a nazirite and she became ritually impure, and afterward her husband nullified her</b> vow, <b>she brings the bird sin-offering, and she does not bring the bird burnt-offering. And if it should enter your mind</b> that the <b>husband severs</b> her vow, <b>let her also bring the bird burnt-offering,</b> to complete the atonement for becoming ritually impure when she was a nazirite. This indicates that the husband uproots the vow, which is why she is not required to bring the bird burnt-offering.

### Part 3
The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>Rather, what then?</b> Will you say that the husband <b>uproots</b> the vow entirely? If so, <b>she should also not bring the bird sin-offering.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>So too,</b> she should not have to bring the bird sin-offering either, <b>but</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar HaKappar.</b>

### Part 4
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the esteemed says: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “And make atonement for him, <b>for that he sinned by reason of the soul”</b> (Numbers 6:11)? <b>And with which soul did this</b> nazirite <b>sin? Rather, because he deprived himself of wine he is</b> therefore <b>called a sinner. And are not</b> these <b>matters</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: And if this one, who deprived himself only of wine, is</b> nevertheless <b>called a sinner,</b> in the case of <b>one who deprives himself of everything</b> by fasting or other acts of mortification, <b>all the more so</b> is he labeled a sinner. According to this opinion, she brings a sin-offering to atone for uttering the vow itself, despite the fact that her husband later uprooted it entirely.

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:10) <b>explicitly:</b> With regard to <b>a woman who vowed to be a nazirite, and another</b> woman <b>heard</b> her <b>and said: And I, and</b> the <b>husband of the first one came and nullified her</b> vow, <b>she is permitted and</b> the <b>other</b> woman <b>is prohibited.</b> One can <b>learn from this</b> that the <b>husband severs</b> the vow rather than uproots it.

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that <b>if</b> the second woman <b>said to her,</b> after hearing her vow of naziriteship: <b>I am hereby like you,</b> in that case <b>they are both permitted.</b> Since the second woman made her naziriteship entirely dependent on that of the first, the nullification of the first woman’s vow cancels the second naziriteship as well.
