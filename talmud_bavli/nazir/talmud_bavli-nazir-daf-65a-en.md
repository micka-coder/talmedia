### Part 1
One must therefore <b>examine from that</b> spot <b>outward</b> for <b>twenty cubits.</b> If one <b>finds</b> another corpse <b>at the end of twenty cubits,</b> he <b>examines</b> from that spot <b>outward twenty cubits, as there is a basis for</b> anticipating <b>the matter.</b> It is likely that he has stumbled upon an ancient gravesite. He is not permitted to relocate the corpses, despite the fact <b>that if he had found</b> the single corpse by itself <b>at first</b> he could have <b>removed it and its surrounding</b> earth.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> the following inferences from the mishna: The phrase: He <b>found, excludes</b> a corpse <b>that</b> already had <b>been found.</b> If it was known that there was one corpse buried in a certain place, the discovery of two previously unknown corpses does not raise the concern that perhaps it is a forgotten graveyard. Similarly, the term <b>corpse [<i>met</i>] excludes a killed [<i>harug</i>]</b> person. Even if there were three corpses found, if there are signs that these people were killed, the area is not assumed to be a graveyard, as they may have been buried where they were found killed. Likewise, the term <b>lying excludes a sitting</b> person, as Jews were not generally buried in a seated position. The phrase: <b>In</b> the usual <b>manner, excludes</b> one <b>whose head was placed between his thighs,</b> as that is not the way Jews are buried.

### Part 3
<b>Ulla bar Ḥanina taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Oholot</i> 16:2): <b>A corpse that is lacking</b> a part of his body indispensable to life <b>has no</b> <i>halakha</i> of <b>surrounding</b> earth, i.e., there is no need to remove the nearby earth along with the corpse. <b>Nor</b> does it have the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a graveyard,</b> i.e., it does not join with two other corpses to establish this site as a cemetery. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all these</b> listed above, i.e., a corpse that was buried in a sitting position or with its head between its thighs, <b>what is the reason</b> that they are <b>not</b> considered part of a graveyard? The Gemara answers: <b>We say</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the deceased <b>was a gentile,</b> as Jews are not usually buried in these ways.

### Part 4
The <i>baraita</i> further states: If one <b>found two</b> corpses, with <b>the head of this</b> one <b>by the feet of that</b> one <b>and the head of that</b> one <b>by the feet of this</b> one, <b>they do not have</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>surrounding earth, nor</b> do they have the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a graveyard.</b> This is not the way Jews are buried, as corpses in a Jewish cemetery always face the same direction. If one <b>found three</b> corpses, <b>one</b> of which was previously <b>known, while</b> the other <b>two</b> were found <b>for the first</b> time now, <b>or</b> if one found <b>two for the first</b> time <b>and two</b> that were <b>known, they do not have</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>surrounding</b> earth, <b>and they</b> also <b>do not have</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a graveyard.</b> One does not view these corpses as connected.

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> relates: <b>An incident</b> occurred <b>involving Rabbi Yeshevav, who examined and found two known</b> corpses <b>and one</b> corpse discovered <b>for the first</b> time, <b>and he wished to deem</b> the three corpses <b>a graveyard. Rabbi Akiva said to him: All your toil is in vain. They said</b> it is <b>a graveyard only</b> in a case <b>of three known</b> corpses buried in one spot <b>or three</b> corpses found <b>for the first</b> time. However, if some were known and others were discovered for the first time, one does not combine them.

### Part 6
§ The mishna taught that <b>he removes them and their surrounding</b> earth. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>surrounding</b> earth? <b>Rav Yehuda said: The verse states</b> with regard to Jacob’s instruction to Joseph to transfer his remains to Eretz Yisrael: <b>“You shall carry me out from Egypt”</b> (Genesis 47:30), which indicates: <b>Take</b> some earth out from Egypt <b>with me,</b> i.e., take the earth that is near the corpse.

### Part 7
The Gemara further asks: <b>And what is the measure of surrounding</b> earth? <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, explained: One takes loose dirt</b> from near the corpse, as it is assumed it has been loosened by the blood and moisture from the corpse, <b>and digs virgin,</b> uncultivated, ground to a depth of <b>three fingerbreadths,</b> in case this earth has absorbed the blood.

### Part 8
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this ruling from a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>And what is the measure of surrounding</b> earth? <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, explained: One takes wood chips</b> found nearby, which might have been part of the coffin, <b>and lumps</b> of earth that might have absorbed the blood and moisture from a corpse.

### Part 9
<b>And he discards</b> that which is <b>certainly</b> not from the corpse, e.g., stones. And <b>he sets aside the</b> items with regard to which it is <b>uncertain</b> if they have a connection with the corpse. <b>And the rest,</b> i.e., anything that is apparently from the corpse, <b>combine to</b> reach the amount <b>of the majority of the structure of a corpse, or of a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of bones,</b> or <b>of a full ladle of dust</b> from a corpse. The remains of a corpse impart ritual impurity in a tent only if they meet one of those three qualifications. Anything which is apparently the remains of the corpse is considered dust of a corpse with regard to this <i>halakha</i>. In any event, it is clear that this <i>baraita</i> presents a different definition of surrounding earth.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: With regard to the first statement of Rabbi Elazar, it was <b>he who said in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>,</b> ben Azzai, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And how much is the measure of surrounding</b> earth? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of ben Azzai: One takes loose earth and digs virgin</b> ground to a depth of <b>three fingerbreadths.</b>

### Part 11
§ The mishna taught that one must <b>examine</b> the ground for up to twenty cubits <b>from that</b> spot where a corpse was found.
