### Part 1
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> that the <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>either a spine or a skull</b> and they are two separate <i>halakhot</i>, <b>these are seven</b> cases, rather than six. The Gemara rejects this claim: No proof can be brought from here, <b>as when</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> this tally he lists seven items. However, only six are fully relevant here, and therefore he said they were six. The Gemara inserts <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the ensuing suggestions as to which item in the list is not necessary in this context: <b>An individual</b> disagrees with him; <b>that he;</b> a nazirite <b>shaves</b> for it; <b>and one</b> quarter-<i>log</i>.

### Part 2
The first explanation is: Rabbi Akiva listed the spine and skull as separate items, but the six include <b>anywhere that many</b> Sages <b>disagree with him, to the exclusion of</b> the case of a bone that is <b>a barley-grain-bulk,</b> as here <b>it is an individual who disagrees with</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:7): If <b>a bone that is a barley-grain-bulk was divided into two, Rabbi Akiva deems</b> it <b>impure and Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri deems</b> it <b>pure.</b> In this case, only one Sage disagrees with Rabbi Akiva.

### Part 3
<b>And if you wish, say</b> a different item on the list that is omitted from the tally: <b>When he teaches</b> six, he includes <b>a limb</b> severed <b>from a corpse,</b> but <b>he does not teach a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> person, and that was the case that was not listed.

### Part 4
<b>And if you wish, say</b> a different item on the list that is omitted from the tally: <b>When he teaches</b> six, he mentions <b>anywhere that a nazirite shaves for his overlaying,</b> i.e., he formed a tent over the remains of a corpse, <b>to the exclusion of</b> the case of <b>a bone that is a barley-grain-bulk, as</b> it <b>does not</b> impart ritual impurity in a tent. As stated in the mishna, this bone imparts impurity only through contact and carrying.

### Part 5
<b>And if you wish, say</b> a different item on the list that is omitted from the tally: <b>When he teaches</b> six, he lists <b>anywhere that</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>retracted</b> his opinion, <b>to the exclusion of a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of blood, as he did not retract his</b> opinion in that case, <b>as Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to bar Kappara: Do not teach a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of blood in the</b> list of Rabbi Akiva’s <b>retractions, as Rabbi Akiva held onto his</b> opinion in this regard.

### Part 6
<b>And furthermore, the verse supports his</b> opinion, as it states: <b>“Neither shall he go in to any dead bodies”</b> (Leviticus 21:11). The plural form “bodies” indicates that two corpses can join together, as stated by Rabbi Akiva. Similarly, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: All his days,</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>would deem</b> a quarter-<i>log</i> of blood from two corpses <b>ritually impure. Whether he retracted his</b> opinion <b>after he died,</b> this <b>I do not know.</b> A Sage <b>taught:</b> Rabbi Shimon’s <b>teeth blackened due to his fasts,</b> which he undertook for uttering this irreverent comment about Rabbi Akiva.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara returns to the earlier discussion. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer to the question of whether a spine and skull must be together to impart ritual impurity, <b>as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 1:7) that <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The <b>quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of bones,</b> which imparts impurity in a tent, can be <b>from</b> several <b>bones [<i>ha’atzamim</i>] or from two or from three</b> bones, but they cannot be from one bone. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The <b>quarter</b>-<i>kav</i> of bones must come <b>from the</b> same <b>body,</b> either <b>from the majority of the structure</b> of the skeleton <b>or from the majority of the number</b> of 248 bones in the body. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: I can establish the statement of Beit Shammai and the statement of Beit Hillel as one.</b> In other words, I can explain their opinions so that there is no dispute between them.

### Part 8
How so? <b>As</b> when <b>Beit Shammai say: From two or three</b> bones, they mean <b>either from two shins and one thigh, or from two thighs and one shin. Since the majority of a person’s height</b> is contained <b>in</b> the <b>height</b> of these limbs, they are considered the majority of the structure of the body. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> Parts <b>from the body, or from the majority of the structure, or from the majority of the number</b> of bones, <b>since they include the joints of the hands and feet,</b> which comprise many small bones, impart impurity. <b>Shammai says: Even a bone from the spine or from the skull</b> imparts impurity. In this source, Shammai explicitly refers to a spine or a skull.

### Part 9
The Gemara rejects this proof: One cannot establish a general <i>halakha</i> from this source, for <b>Shammai is different, as he is</b> invariably <b>stringent,</b> whereas the Rabbis might disagree. The Gemara inquires: If so, <b>let us resolve</b> the opposite <b>from</b> this <i>baraita</i>: <b>The reason</b> that Shammai spoke of a spine or a skull <b>is that Beit Shammai are stringent,</b> from which it may be inferred that according to <b>the Rabbis</b> a spine and skull are not ritually impure <b>unless</b> both <b>a spine and skull are present.</b> The Gemara rejects this proof too: <b>No, the Rabbis disagree with Shammai only with regard to one bone that comes from the spine or from the skull, but when it is intact, even</b> if the bone is from <b>one of them,</b> either the spine or the skull, they possibly agree that it imparts impurity.

### Part 10
§ <b>Rami bar Ḥama raised a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of bones from a spine and a skull, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does a nazirite shave for them? The Gemara explains the two sides of the dilemma: <b>When</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that one shaves for <b>a half-<i>kav</i> of bones,</b> does this apply only <b>when</b> they <b>are from his other limbs, but</b> in the case of bones <b>from</b> the <b>spine and skull, which are stringent,</b> as they impart ritual impurity on their own, <b>even a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of bones</b> imparts impurity? <b>Or perhaps</b> it <b>is no different.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from the mishna, which teaches: <b>The spine and the skull. And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of bones that come from a spine and skull is</b> more <b>stringent</b> than other limbs and imparts ritual impurity, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a manner that presents a greater novelty, by stating: <b>For a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of bones that come from the spine</b> and the skull.
