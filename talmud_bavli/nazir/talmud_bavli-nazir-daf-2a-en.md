### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One becomes a nazirite by taking a nazirite vow, in which he simply declares himself a nazirite, as detailed in the Torah (Numbers 6:1–21). Additionally, <b>all substitutes</b> for the language <b>of nazirite vows are like nazirite vows</b> and are binding. Furthermore, intimations of nazirite vows, i.e., incomplete statements that are understood from context to be meant as nazirite vows, are considered binding nazirite vows.

### Part 2
Consequently, <b>one who says: I will be,</b> without further clarification, <b>is a nazirite,</b> as this is his implied intention. <b>Or,</b> if he said: <b>I will be beautiful,</b> he is <b>a nazirite.</b> The substitutes for the language of nazirite vows are as follows: If one says: I will be <b>a <i>nazik</i>,</b> a <b><i>nazi’aḥ</i>,</b> or <b>a <i>pazi’aḥ</i>, he is a nazirite.</b> If one says: <b>I am hereby like this, I am hereby</b> a hair <b>curler, I am hereby growing</b> my <b>hair;</b> or: <b>It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me to grow long hair, he is a nazirite.</b>

### Part 3
If one says: An obligation <b>is hereby</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> with regard to <b>birds, Rabbi Meir says: He is a nazirite.</b> A nazirite brings two bird-offerings if he inadvertently becomes ritually impure from a corpse (Numbers 6:10), and it is understood that the individual used this indirect phrase to take a vow of naziriteship. <b>And the Sages say: He is not a nazirite.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara begins by clarifying why this tractate appears in the order of <i>Nashim</i> within the six orders of the Mishna. <b>Now, the <i>tanna</i> is engaged in</b> the study of <b>the order of <i>Nashim</i>,</b> which discusses laws concerning marriage and the resulting obligations as well as with forbidden sexual relations. <b>What</b> then <b>is the reason</b> that he <b>teaches</b> the laws of the <b>nazirite</b> here?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>The <i>tanna</i> is engaged in</b> the study of <b>the verse</b> pertaining to divorce: <b>“Then it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly matter about her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1). <b>And this is what he is saying: What caused</b> the woman <b>to</b> commit the <b>transgression</b> of adultery, alluded to in the verse by the phrase “unseemly matter”? It was <b>wine. And</b> the <i>tanna</i> is <b>saying: Anyone who sees a <i>sota</i> in her disgrace should abstain from wine.</b> Consequently, tractate <i>Nazir</i> is placed in the order of <i>Nashim</i>, immediately preceding tractate <i>Sota</i>, which is about a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful, and tractate <i>Gittin</i>, which discusses divorce.

### Part 6
§ The Gemara asks a question with regard to the mishna’s presentation of the different topics it addresses: The <i>tanna</i> <b>began with</b> the statement that all <b>substitutes</b> for the language of nazirite vows are considered nazirite vows, <b>but</b> then it <b>explains</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>intimations</b> of nazirite vows by providing examples of intimations rather than examples of substitutes for nazirite vows. Why didn’t the mishna provide examples of substitutes immediately after stating the <i>halakha</i> concerning substitutes?

### Part 7
<b>Rava said, and some say</b> this statement <b>without attribution [<i>kedi</i>]:</b> The mishna <b>is incomplete and is teaching the following: All substitutes</b> for the language <b>of nazirite vows are like nazirite vows. And</b> similarly, all <b>intimations of nazirite vows are like nazirite vows. And these are</b> examples of <b>intimations: One who says: I will be, is a nazirite.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> nevertheless, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>explain</b> the cases of <b>substitutes first,</b> before providing examples of intimations, as the <i>halakha</i> of substitutes is mentioned before the <i>halakha</i> of intimations. The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i></b> employs the general style of the Mishna, which is that <b>the</b> subject <b>with which it concludes is the one that it explains first, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 20b): <b>With what may one light</b> the Shabbat lamp <b>and with what may one not light</b> it? <b>And</b> the mishna <b>explains</b> the details of what <b>one may not light first,</b> before providing examples of fuel that may be used to light the Shabbat lamp.

### Part 9
Similarly, another mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 47b) states: <b>In what may one insulate</b> a pot of cooked food on Shabbat eve, <b>and in what may one not insulate</b> it? <b>And</b> the mishna <b>explains</b> the cases of material in which <b>one may not insulate</b> it <b>first,</b> before providing examples of materials in which one may insulate a pot of cooked food.

### Part 10
A third example of this style is in the following mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 57a): <b>With what</b> items may <b>a woman go out</b> into the public domain on Shabbat <b>and with what</b> items may <b>she not go out? And</b> the mishna <b>explains</b> the items with which <b>a woman may not go out first,</b> before providing examples of items with which she may go out.

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 51b): <b>With what may an animal go out</b> into the public domain on Shabbat, <b>and with what may it not go out? And it explains</b> the items with which <b>a camel may go out first,</b> before providing examples of items with which it may not go out.

### Part 12
Similarly, it is taught in another mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 108a): <b>There are</b> some relatives who <b>inherit and bequeath,</b> e.g., a father and son, who are heirs to each other; some who <b>inherit but do not bequeath;</b> some <b>bequeath but do not inherit;</b> and some <b>do not inherit and do not bequeath. And</b> the mishna <b>explains</b> the cases of <b>those</b> who both <b>inherit and bequeath first,</b> before providing examples of the other categories that were mentioned later in the opening clause of the mishna.

### Part 13
<b>Rather,</b> the mishna <b>actually teaches</b> in <b>this</b> manner at times, <b>and</b> it <b>teaches</b> in <b>that</b> manner at other times. There are instances where the <i>tanna</i> begins by elaborating on the first principle mentioned in the mishna, while on other occasions he first elaborates upon the last principle mentioned.

### Part 14
<b>However,</b> there is a rationale as to when the <i>tanna</i> employs each style. <b>There,</b> in the passages concerning the fuels one may use to light the Shabbat lamp, the materials one may use to insulate a pot on Shabbat eve, and the items with which a woman may go out on Shabbat to the public domain, <b>where it is</b> the individual’s <b>own prohibition</b> that is being discussed, the <i>tanna</i> <b>explains</b> the cases pertaining to the individual’s <b>own prohibition first.</b> By contrast, <b>with regard to</b> the mishna that addresses <b>an animal</b> carrying into the public domain on Shabbat, <b>where the prohibition comes by means of</b> the <b>animal,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>explains</b> what is <b>permitted first.</b>
