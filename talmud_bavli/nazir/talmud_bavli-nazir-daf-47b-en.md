### Part 1
<b>and</b> a High Priest <b>of many garments,</b> i.e., one who was not anointed with oil but who was sanctified by wearing the eight garments of a High Priest, it is <b>preferable</b> that <b>the one who was anointed with the anointing oil</b> remain ritually pure. The Gemara explains: <b>As</b> a High Priest <b>anointed with the anointing oil brings</b> the <b>bull brought for all the mitzvot,</b> i.e., if an anointed priest ruled erroneously with regard to a prohibition that if a Jew transgressed it he would be liable to bring a sin-offering, he brings a bull for his sin-offering (see Leviticus 4:3–12), <b>while</b> a High Priest <b>of many garments does not bring</b> a bull.

### Part 2
In a case where <b>a former anointed</b> High Priest, i.e., a priest who had temporarily substituted for a High Priest, is walking together with one of <b>many garments,</b> it is <b>preferable</b> that the one who wears <b>many garments</b> remain ritually pure. The reason is <b>that</b> a High Priest of <b>many garments</b> still <b>performs the service, whereas a former anointed</b> High Priest <b>is no</b> longer <b>able</b> to perform the <b>service.</b>

### Part 3
In a case where an anointed High Priest who temporarily <b>left</b> his role <b>due to his seminal emission</b> is walking with a former anointed High Priest who left his role <b>due to his blemish,</b> it is <b>preferable</b> that the former High Priest who <b>left due to his seminal emission</b> remain ritually pure, <b>as this one,</b> the High Priest who experienced an emission, <b>is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service the following day, while</b> the former anointed High Priest who <b>left due to his blemish is no</b> longer <b>fit for the service</b> at all (see Leviticus 21:16–24).

### Part 4
§ The above cases are all easily resolved and are mentioned merely to introduce the following inquiries, for which there are no obvious answers. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages. For <b>which of these</b> two is it <b>preferable</b> that he remain ritually pure: A priest <b>anointed for war,</b> who was anointed with oil and appointed to admonish the troops before battle (see Deuteronomy 20:2) <b>or the deputy [<i>segan</i>]</b> High Priest? Is it <b>preferable</b> that the priest <b>anointed for war</b> remain ritually pure, <b>as he is fit for war? Or, perhaps</b> it is <b>preferable</b> that the <b>deputy</b> High Priest remain ritually pure, <b>as he is fit for service</b> in the Temple in place of the High Priest.

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The difference between</b> a priest <b>anointed for war and a deputy</b> High Priest <b>is only that if they were walking along the way and found a <i>met mitzva</i>,</b> the ruling is: <b>Let the one anointed for war become impure, and</b> do <b>not let the deputy become impure.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: A priest <b>anointed for war takes precedence over the deputy</b> High Priest? <b>Mar Zutra said:</b> This is not difficult. <b>With regard to preserving his life</b> and rescuing him from captivity or from a dangerous situation, it is <b>preferable</b> to preserve <b>the one anointed for war. What is the reason</b> for this? The reason is <b>that the public depends on him</b> in a time of war.

### Part 7
<b>But with regard to ritual impurity,</b> it is <b>preferable</b> that the <b>deputy</b> High Priest remain ritually pure, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: Why did</b> the Sages <b>institute a deputy for the High Priest?</b> So <b>that if a disqualification befalls</b> the High Priest, his deputy <b>can enter</b> the Temple <b>and serve in his stead.</b> The deputy High Priest cannot fulfill this function if he is allowed to become ritually impure.

### Part 8
The Gemara turns its attention to the <i>halakha</i> of the mishna. Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis <b>disagree only with regard to a High Priest and a nazirite who are walking together</b> and find a <i>met mitzva</i>, in which case one of them must become impure. <b>However,</b> it is evident that if <b>each of them</b> is walking <b>separately, they are able,</b> i.e., they are required, <b>to become impure. From where are these matters</b> derived? From where is it learned that a High Priest and a nazirite, who are prohibited from becoming impure even to bury their relatives, must nevertheless become impure to bury a <i>met mitzva</i>?

### Part 9
It is <b>as the Sages taught:</b> The verse states with regard to a High Priest: <b>“Neither shall he go in to any dead bodies;</b> nor defile himself for his father or for his mother” (Leviticus 21:11). <b>With regard to what</b> bodies <b>is the verse speaking? If</b> it is referring <b>to distant</b> people, i.e., non-relatives, <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> can be derived by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if a common priest, who becomes impure to</b> bury his <b>close</b> family members, <b>may not become impure to</b> bury <b>distant</b> people, then with regard to <b>a High Priest, who does not become impure</b> even <b>to</b> bury <b>close</b> members of his family, <b>is it not logical that he does not become impure to</b> bury <b>distant</b> people? <b>Rather, the verse is speaking of close</b> family members, and it prohibits a High Priest from becoming impure to bury any person, even his relatives.

### Part 10
The Gemara comments: With regard to the rest of the verse: “Nor defile himself for his father or for his mother” (Leviticus 21:11), each of these clauses must serve to teach a novel <i>halakha</i>. <b>And</b> the phrase “for his father” teaches: <b>It is to</b> bury <b>his father that he may not become ritually impure,</b> from which it may be inferred that <b>he becomes impure to</b> bury <b>a <i>met mitzva</i>.</b>
