### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: Once the blood</b> of <b>one</b> of the offerings <b>has been sprinkled on</b> the nazirite’s <b>behalf, the nazirite is permitted to drink wine and to contract ritual impurity</b> imparted <b>by a corpse.</b> The rest of the ritual is not indispensable for his purification.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> It states at the end of the passage dealing with naziriteship: <b>“And after that the nazirite may drink wine”</b> (Numbers 6:20), which means <b>after all the actions,</b> i.e., after he has sacrificed all the offerings and shaved, thereby completing the entire ritual of a nazirite. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. And the Rabbis say: After a single action.</b> He may drink wine after sacrificing one offering, even if he has yet to shave, as shaving is not indispensable for being permitted to drink wine.

### Part 3
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is the reason of the Rabbis? It is written here: “And after that the nazirite may drink wine,” and it is written there,</b> in the previous verse: “And the priest shall take the cooked foreleg…and place it on the palms of the nazirite <b>after he has shaven his naziriteship”</b> (Numbers 6:19). It is derived by verbal analogy: <b>Just as there</b> the term “after” means <b>after a single action,</b> i.e., shaving, <b>here too,</b> the term “after” means <b>after a single action,</b> sacrificing one offering.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: Perhaps one can <b>say</b> that a nazirite is not permitted to drink wine <b>until there are both</b> actions, i.e., sacrificing an offering and shaving, as implied by a straightforward reading of the verse. The Gemara answers: <b>If so, why do I</b> need this <b>verbal analogy?</b> It must be teaching that a nazirite can drink wine after the performance of a single action.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rav said:</b> The priest’s lack of <b>waving</b> of the offering <b>of a nazirite precludes</b> the release of the prohibitions of his naziriteship. The Gemara asks: <b>According to whose opinion</b> did Rav state this <i>halakha</i>? <b>If we say</b> that he spoke <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> this is difficult, as <b>the Rabbis say</b> that even lack of <b>shaving does not preclude</b> the completion of his naziriteship. <b>Is</b> it <b>necessary,</b> then, to state that <b>waving,</b> which is not indispensable in the case of other offerings, is not essential for the ritual of a nazirite?

### Part 6
<b>Rather,</b> will you say that it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who permits a nazirite to drink wine only after he has completed the entire ritual? This <b>is obvious; didn’t Rabbi Eliezer say</b> that he is permitted to drink wine only <b>after all the actions</b> are completed? The Gemara answers that the statement is necessary, <b>lest you say: Since with regard to</b> the <b>atonement</b> effected by all other offerings, waving <b>is</b> considered <b>a peripheral aspect of the mitzva,</b> i.e., one achieves atonement even if he did not perform the ritual of waving, <b>here too</b> its lack <b>does not preclude</b> the release of a nazirite’s prohibitions. Rav therefore <b>teaches us</b> that according to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer waving is essential in the case of a nazirite.
