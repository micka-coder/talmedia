### Part 1
Similarly, <b>with regard to</b> the mishna that teaches that <b>there are</b> some relatives who <b>inherit</b> and bequeath, the <i>tanna</i> <b>also</b> had a reason for initially providing examples from the first category: He thereby <b>explains the principal</b> case of the Torah’s <i>halakhot</i> of <b>inheritance first.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara now returns to its question: <b>But here, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>explain</b> the cases of <b>substitutes first.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rather, this is</b> the <b>reason: Since intimations are derived from</b> the <b>exposition</b> of verses and are not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, they are <b>dear to</b> the <i>tanna</i> and he therefore mentions them first.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is so, then <b>let him begin with them first</b> in the opening clause of the mishna as well. The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> begins, he begins with the main offering</b> of the nazirite, i.e., with the <i>halakha</i> that has a basis in the Torah. <b>But with regard</b> to the <b>explanation</b> of these <i>halakhot</i>, <b>he explains</b> the cases of <b>intimations first,</b> as he favors that topic.

### Part 4
§ The mishna taught: <b>One who says: I will be, is a nazirite.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Perhaps he is saying: I will be fasting,</b> i.e., his intention is to take a vow that will obligate himself to fast rather than to be a nazirite. The Gemara answers that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The mishna is describing a case <b>where a nazirite was passing before him,</b> so that it is clear that he is taking a nazirite vow.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Shmuel holds</b> as a principle that <b>ambiguous intimations are not</b> considered <b>intimations,</b> i.e., they are not considered vows? The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Say</b> that <b>when a nazirite is passing before him, there is no</b> reason <b>to doubt</b> his intention. There is no possibility that he is referring <b>to another matter,</b> and therefore his statement is definitely an intimation of naziriteship. <b>However,</b> it is <b>certainly</b> the case that when <b>a nazirite is not passing before him,</b> and he states: I will be, <b>we say</b> that <b>perhaps he is saying: I will be fasting.</b> It is only in the latter case, where one’s intimation is so ambiguous that it offers no evidence whatsoever of his intentions, that Shmuel holds that one’s statement is not considered a vow.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even if he made his statement when a nazirite was passing before him, <b>perhaps he was saying</b> that he intends to purchase the animals the nazirite will need for his offerings and thereby <b>exempt</b> the nazirite <b>from</b> paying for <b>his</b> own <b>offerings.</b> The Gemara answers: This is a case <b>where he said in his heart</b> that he accepts upon himself a nazirite vow.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i>? Isn’t it obvious that he becomes a nazirite? The Gemara answers: It is necessary to state this <i>halakha</i>, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>we require his mouth and heart</b> to be <b>identical.</b> If that were the case, then if one did not clearly articulate his nazirite vow, he would not become a nazirite even if he intended to become one. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that since his words can be interpreted as referring to a nazirite vow, and that was his intention, he becomes a nazirite.

### Part 8
§ The mishna taught that if one says: <b>I will be beautiful [<i>na’e</i>],</b> he is <b>a nazirite.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> when he said: I will be beautiful, he meant: <b>I will be beautiful before Him in mitzvot? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“This is my God and I will glorify Him [<i>anvehu</i>]”</b> (Exodus 15:2). <i>Anvehu</i> has the same root as the word <i>na’e</i>; therefore, the verse means: <b>I will be beautiful before Him in mitzvot.</b> How is this done? <b>I will make before Him a beautiful <i>sukka</i>, a beautiful <i>lulav</i>, beautiful ritual fringes. I will write before Him a beautiful Torah scroll, and I will wrap it in beautiful silk cloths [<i>shira’in</i>].</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara answers that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where one is holding his hair and says: I will be beautiful.</b> This clearly indicates that he is referring to naziriteship.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: Since <b>naziriteship</b> is <b>a matter of transgression,</b> can <b>we say about</b> a nazirite that he is <b>beautiful?</b>
