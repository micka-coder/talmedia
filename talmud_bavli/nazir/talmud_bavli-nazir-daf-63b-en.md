### Part 1
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from the mishna: <b>If</b> he discovered he was impure <b>before he shaved, he negates</b> the days of his naziriteship <b>in either case.</b> The Gemara seeks to clarify this: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? When exactly did he find out about the impurity? <b>If</b> it <b>became known to him during the full term</b> of his naziriteship, <b>need this be said,</b> that he negates the previous days? After all, he has yet to complete his naziriteship vow. <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case when the impurity was discovered <b>after the full term</b> of his naziriteship? <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that he negates the days of his naziriteship even if he discovered the impurity after the completion of his term.

### Part 2
The Gemara continues to analyze the aforementioned case. <b>And you</b> can <b>still raise the dilemma:</b> Does <b>he negate</b> the <b>entire</b> period of his naziriteship <b>or</b> does <b>he negate</b> just <b>seven</b> days? The Gemara asks: <b>According to whom</b> is this dilemma raised? <b>If we say</b> this dilemma is referring <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> (see 16b), <b>it is obvious that</b> he <b>negates it all,</b> as they maintain that even a nazirite who becomes impure after the completion of his naziriteship must observe another thirty days. <b>And if</b> it is referring <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> his ruling with regard to <b>any</b> impurity <b>after the full term</b> of his term is that one <b>negates</b> only <b>seven</b> days.

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: The one who raised this dilemma could have <b>said to you: This statement</b> of Rabbi Eliezer that a nazirite negates a mere seven days applies only <b>if he became impure after the full term</b> of his naziriteship, <b>but this one</b> became impure <b>before</b> the end of <b>the full term,</b> and therefore he negates the entire period. <b>Or perhaps it is different here, as it is</b> a case of <b>knowledge</b> that came to light <b>after the full term</b> of his naziriteship.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>And</b> one can resolve the dilemma <b>from this</b> mishna itself. The mishna <b>teaches</b> that if the nazirite discovered he was impure before he shaved <b>he negates</b> his naziriteship <b>in either case. And it does not distinguish</b> between cases where this happened before the end of the full term or after it. This indicates that in any case he negates only seven days.

### Part 5
ยง <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Zavim</i> 2:8): In the case of <b>one who finds a corpse lying</b> across <b>the width of a road, with regard to <i>teruma</i></b> the passerby is <b>impure. But with regard to</b> both <b>a nazirite and one performing</b> the ritual of <b>the Paschal offering,</b> the passerby is <b>pure,</b> as it is considered impurity imparted by a grave in the depths. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> that one is impure with regard to partaking of <i>teruma</i>? It is said in a case <b>where he does not have space to pass by</b> on the road without passing over the corpse.

### Part 6
<b>But</b> if <b>he has space to pass by,</b> then <b>even with regard to <i>teruma</i></b> he is <b>pure.</b> This is because it is possible that the passerby did not become ritually impure, and there is a principle that if an uncertainty arises concerning the ritual purity of a person or item in the public domain, the person or item is considered pure.

### Part 7
Similarly, <b>in what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where one finds</b> the corpse <b>whole. However,</b> if it is <b>broken or dismembered</b> he is pure, <b>even</b> if <b>there is no space to pass by.</b> The reason is that <b>we suspect</b> that <b>perhaps he passed between the parts</b> of the corpse and did not touch or pass over any of them. This applies when he finds the corpse out in the open. <b>But</b> if he finds it <b>in a grave, even</b> if it is <b>broken</b> or <b>dismembered,</b> he is <b>impure.</b> This is <b>because the grave joins</b> the parts into one unit and renders him impure if he passed over any part of the grave, even if he did not pass over part of the corpse.

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> i.e., that if the corpse was dismembered the passerby is pure? It is said <b>with regard to</b> a passerby who <b>travels by foot. However,</b> if he was <b>loaded</b> with a heavy burden <b>or</b> was <b>riding</b> an animal, he is <b>impure.</b> This is <b>because</b> in the case of <b>one who travels by foot, it is possible that he will not touch</b> the corpse <b>and will not move</b> it <b>and will not pass over</b> it, whereas in the case of one who is <b>loaded</b> with a heavy burden and therefore does not walk in a straight line, <b>or</b> one <b>riding</b> an animal, <b>it is impossible that he will not touch</b> the corpse <b>and will not move</b> it <b>and will not pass over</b> it.

### Part 9
<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> that a nazirite and one bringing a Paschal offering are considered pure? It is said <b>with regard to impurity</b> imparted by a grave <b>in the depths. However,</b> if the source of <b>impurity</b> was <b>known</b> to others but not to the individual who became impure, all <b>three of them,</b> i.e., a nazirite, one performing the ritual of the Paschal offering, and the one who wishes to partake of <i>teruma</i>, are <b>impure.</b>

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And which</b> corpse <b>is</b> considered to impart <b>impurity of the depths? Any</b> corpse <b>of which no one is aware,</b> even <b>at the end of the earth.</b> But if even <b>one</b> individual <b>is aware of it,</b> even if that person is <b>at the end of the earth, this is not</b> considered <b>impurity</b> imparted by a grave <b>in the depths.</b>

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> continues: To ascertain whether anyone ever knew about the corpse, its condition is taken into account. If the body <b>was concealed in hay or in pebbles,</b> so the person might have died in an avalanche, it is likely that the corpse had never been found; <b>this is impurity</b> imparted by a grave <b>in the depths.</b> However, if it was found <b>in water, or in a dark</b> place, <b>or in the clefts of the rocks, this is not impurity</b> imparted by a grave <b>in the depths.</b> Although these are places where people do not often go, with the passage of time the corpse is likely to be discovered, and it is quite possible that someone already passed by and saw it.

### Part 12
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>And</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that the leniency of <b>impurity</b> imparted by a grave <b>in the depths</b> applies <b>only with regard to a corpse,</b> but not with regard to other sources of impurity.

### Part 13
ยง The mishna taught: <b>How</b> does one differentiate between a known and an unknown impurity? If a nazirite <b>descended</b> to immerse in a cave, and a corpse was found floating at the mouth of the cave, he is impure. The Gemara comments: <b>A floating</b> impurity <b>does not render</b> a person or item <b>impure in the case of</b> a carcass of <b>a creeping animal. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Teharot</i> 5:6): With regard to the case of <b>uncertain impurity,</b> where an item might have touched something impure that was <b>floating, either</b> in water <b>in a vessel or</b> in water <b>in the ground,</b> e.g., a well, the item is <b>pure. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> If the impurity was floating in water that was <b>in a vessel,</b> the item is <b>impure;</b> if the impurity was in water <b>in the ground,</b> it is <b>pure.</b>
