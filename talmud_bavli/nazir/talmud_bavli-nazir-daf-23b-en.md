<b>and their contentions are like the bars of a castle”</b> (Proverbs 18:19)? <b>“A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city,” this is Lot,</b> called Abraham’s brother (see Genesis 14:14), <b>who separated from Abraham. “And their contentions are like the bars of a castle,”</b> this is <b>because</b> Lot <b>brought contention</b> between the Jewish people and his own descendants <b>like bars,</b> which lock the gates of <b>a castle.</b> Just as no one can enter a locked castle, so too Lot’s descendants, Ammon and Moab, were prevented from joining the Jewish people, as it states: <b>“An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:4).

### Part 2
On the same issue, <b>Rava expounded</b> a verse <b>homiletically, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “He who separates himself seeks his own desire, and snarls against all sound wisdom”</b> (Proverbs 18:1)? <b>“He who separates himself seeks his own desire,” this is Lot,</b> who separated from Abraham. <b>“And snarls [<i>yitgala</i>] against all sound wisdom,”</b> this too describes Lot, <b>as his shame was</b> eventually <b>revealed [<i>nitgala</i>] in the synagogues,</b> when his actions recorded in the Torah are read in public, <b>and in the study halls,</b> where the <i>halakhot</i> of his descendants are taught. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>An Ammonite and a Moabite are prohibited</b> from entering the congregation by marrying a Jewish woman, <b>and their prohibition is permanent.</b>

### Part 3
§ In relation to the preceding discussion with regard to the daughters of Lot, who acted in a wanton manner for the sake of a mitzva, the Gemara cites that which <b>Ulla said: Tamar engaged in licentious</b> sexual intercourse with her father-in-law, Judah (see Genesis, chapter 38), and <b>Zimri</b> ben Salu also <b>engaged in licentious</b> sexual intercourse with a Midianite woman (see Numbers, chapter 25).

### Part 4
Yet despite the similarity between their actions, <b>Tamar engaged in licentious</b> sexual intercourse for the sake of a mitzva, to have children, and therefore she merited that <b>kings</b> of the House of David <b>descended from her.</b> King David’s lineage traces back to Tamar’s son Peretz (see Ruth 4:18–22). <b>And</b> she also merited to be the ancestor of <b>prophets,</b> e.g., Isaiah, who was related to the royal family. Conversely, with regard to <b>Zimri,</b> who <b>engaged in licentious</b> sexual intercourse for the purpose of a transgression, <b>several multitudes of Israel fell due to him;</b> twenty-four thousand in a plague (see Numbers 25:9). This shows that a great deal depends on one’s intentions.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Greater is a transgression</b> committed <b>for its own sake,</b> i.e., for the sake of Heaven, <b>than a mitzva</b> performed <b>not for its own sake.</b> The Gemara questions this comparison: <b>But didn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav said: A person should always occupy himself with Torah and mitzvot even not for their own sake, as</b> it is <b>through</b> acts performed <b>not for their own sake</b> that good deeds <b>for their own sake come</b> about? How, then, can any transgression be considered greater than a mitzva not for the sake of Heaven?

### Part 6
<b>Rather,</b> one must emend the above statement and <b>say</b> as follows: A transgression for the sake of Heaven is <b>equivalent to a mitzva not for its own sake.</b> The proof is <b>as it is written: “Blessed above women shall Yael be, the wife of Hever the Kenite, above women in the tent she shall be blessed”</b> (Judges 5:24), and it is taught: <b>Who are</b> these <b>“women in the tent?”</b> They are <b>Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah.</b> Yael’s forbidden intercourse with Sisera for the sake of Heaven is compared to the sexual intercourse in which the Matriarchs engaged.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: How is it derived that Yael engaged in sexual intercourse with Sisera? As <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That wicked one,</b> Sisera, <b>engaged in seven acts of sexual intercourse</b> with Yael <b>at that time, as it is stated: “Between her feet he sunk, he fell, he lay;</b> between her feet he sunk, he fell; where he sunk, there he fell down dead” (Judges 5:27). Each mention of falling is referring to another act of intercourse.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> Yael at least <b>enjoyed the sexual intercourse</b> with <b>him;</b> why is the verse so effusive in her praise? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: All the good of the wicked,</b> i.e., anything good received from wicked people, <b>is nothing other</b> than <b>evil for the righteous,</b> and therefore she certainly derived no pleasure from the act.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: From where is this principle derived? <b>As</b> it <b>is stated</b> in the verse that God warned Laban the Aramean, when he was chasing Jacob: <b>“Guard yourself from speaking to Jacob, from good to evil”</b> (Genesis 31:24). <b>Granted,</b> with regard to the warning against speaking <b>evil,</b> it is <b>fine</b> that Laban was warned not to harm Jacob. <b>However, why shouldn’t</b> he say anything <b>good</b> to Jacob? <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> this verse that even Laban’s <b>good is bad</b> in Jacob’s eyes? The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from this</b> that it is so.

### Part 10
§ The Gemara returns to analyze in greater detail <b>the</b> above matter <b>itself. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: A person should always occupy himself with Torah and mitzvot even not for their own sake, as through</b> these acts performed <b>not for their own sake,</b> good deeds <b>for their own sake come</b> about. The proof for this is <b>that in reward for the forty-two offerings that the wicked Balak sacrificed</b> (see Numbers, chapter 23), although he did not do so for the sake of Heaven but to facilitate the cursing of the Jewish people, nevertheless <b>he merited that Ruth descended from him.</b> Not only was he the forebear of a righteous convert, but also of King David. <b>And</b> this is as <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Ruth was the daughter of the son of Eglon, king of Moab,</b> who descended from Balak, king of Moab.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not deprive</b> one of <b>even</b> the <b>reward for proper speech,</b> i.e., for speaking in a refined manner? <b>As while</b> there is the case of Lot’s <b>elder</b> daughter, <b>who called</b> her son <b>Moab [<i>mo’av</i>],</b> which alludes to his shameful origins, as <i>me’av</i> means: From father, <b>and the Merciful One says to</b> Moses: <b>“Do not besiege Moab, nor contend with them in war”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:9), which indicates: It is <b>war that is not</b> permitted; <b>however,</b> with regard to <b>harassing,</b> the Jews were permitted <b>to harass them.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And while</b> there is the case of Lot’s <b>younger</b> daughter, <b>who called</b> her son <b>Ben-Ami,</b> son of my people, without explicitly mentioning her father. With regard to her descendants, God <b>said to</b> Moses: <b>“Do not harass them, nor contend with them”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:19), which means <b>even</b> as far as <b>harassing</b> is concerned, <b>you may not harass them at all.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: A person should always come first</b> with regard <b>to a matter of a mitzva, as in reward of</b> the <b>one night that the elder</b> daughter of Lot <b>preceded the younger</b> for the sake of a mitzva,
