### Part 1
The Gemara answers: <b>Bar Padda</b> could have <b>said to you: Say the latter clause</b> of that mishna: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It negates only seven</b> days. <b>If it enters your mind</b> that <b>we require thirty</b> days for a term of naziriteship, the nazirite <b>should negate all of them,</b> since he is still in the middle of his naziriteship. This proves that an unspecified naziriteship is only twenty-nine days long.

### Part 2
The Gemara responds that Rav Mattana can explain Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion as follows: This does not prove that an unspecified term of naziriteship is less than thirty days, as <b>Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that the legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that <b>of an entire</b> day, and it is viewed as though the nazirite has completed his term of naziriteship at the start of the thirtieth day.

### Part 3
The Gemara raises a difficulty with Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna (16a): If one says: <b>I am hereby a nazirite</b> for <b>one hundred days,</b> if <b>he became impure</b> on the <b>one hundredth day, it negates the entire</b> tally. He must bring offerings for having become impure, and he then begins his term of naziriteship anew. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It negates only thirty days.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that the legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that <b>of an entire</b> day, the nazirite <b>should negate seven</b> days because it is considered as though he became impure after completing his term of naziriteship. <b>And if he does not hold</b> that <b>part of the day is like an entire</b> day, <b>he should negate all of</b> the days, since he became impure during his naziriteship.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, we do not say</b> that the legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that <b>of an entire</b> day. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>let him negate all of</b> the days. <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that <b>this is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer: The verse states: “This is the law of the nazirite, on the day when the days of his consecration are complete”</b> (Numbers 6:13). <b>The Torah stated:</b> If <b>he became impure on the day of the completion</b> of his term of naziriteship, <b>give him the <i>halakha</i> of</b> an unspecified <b>nazirite,</b> and he must recount an unspecified term of naziriteship, which is thirty days.

### Part 5
§ Until this point the Gemara has been attempting to prove whether the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rav Mattana or bar Padda. The Gemara now suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Until the days are complete,</b> in which he consecrated himself to the Lord, he shall be holy, he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long” (Numbers 6:5).

### Part 6
<b>I hear</b> from this: The <b>least</b> amount of days that the plural <b>“days”</b> can indicate is <b>two,</b> implying that one can become a nazirite for a term of two days. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “He shall be holy, he shall let</b> the locks of the hair of his head <b>grow long,”</b> and <b>there is no</b> significant <b>growth of hair</b> in <b>less than thirty</b> days. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> This proof is <b>not needed, as</b> the verse <b>says: “Until the days are complete.” What are the days that require completion? You must say</b> this is referring to the days of a month. Since a lunar cycle lasts for approximately twenty-nine and a half days, some months are twenty-nine days, whereas full months are <b>thirty</b> days. This demonstrates that a term of naziriteship must be at least one month.

### Part 8
The Gemara suggests: <b>What, is it not</b> the case that <b>Rav Mattana said in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya,</b> who derives the minimum length of a term of naziriteship from the phrase “he shall be holy, he shall let his hair grow long,” and therefore a term of naziriteship lasts thirty days, <b>and bar Padda said in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan,</b> who derives this <i>halakha</i> from the length of a month, and since a month can be twenty-nine days, the minimum length of a term of naziriteship is also twenty-nine days?

### Part 9
The Gemara responds: <b>Rav Mattana</b> could have <b>said to you: Everyone</b> agrees that <b>we require</b> a term of naziriteship to last at least <b>thirty</b> days, <b>and here they disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>“until”</b> means <b>until and including. Rabbi Yoshiya holds</b> that <b>“until</b> the days are complete” indicates that a term of naziriteship must last <b>until, but not</b> necessarily <b>including,</b> the thirtieth day of a full month. Consequently, he derives the minimum length of a term of naziriteship from the phrase “he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.” <b>And Rabbi Yonatan holds</b> that the term <b>“until”</b> means <b>until and including</b> the thirtieth day of a full month, and he derives the minimum length of a term of naziriteship from the phrase “until the days are complete.”

### Part 10
The Gemara now analyzes the <i>baraita</i> that cites the opinions of Rabbi Yoshiya and Rabbi Yonatan. <b>The Master,</b> Rabbi Yonatan, <b>said: What are the days that require completion? You must say</b> this is referring to the <b>thirty</b> days of a full month. The Gemara asks: <b>But say</b> it is referring to the seven days of <b>a week.</b> The Gemara responds: In the case of <b>a week, is there</b> ever a week that is <b>lacking?</b> All weeks are seven days. Conversely, since some months are twenty-nine days and others are thirty days, it can be said that the thirtieth day completes that which was lacking.
