### Part 1
<b>However, according to bar Padda</b> this is <b>difficult.</b> Why doesn’t he shave his hair on the thirtieth day of each term of naziriteship?

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>Bar Padda</b> could have <b>said to you: Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And if he shaved</b> his hair for <b>the first</b> term <b>on the thirtieth day, he shaves</b> his hair for <b>the second</b> term <b>on the sixtieth day.</b> This demonstrates that the periods of naziriteship really last only twenty-nine days. <b>Rather, the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>supports his</b> opinion, whereas the <b>earlier clause</b> of the mishna, which teaches that he shaves his hair on the thirty-first and sixty-first days, is referring <b>to one who says</b> that his naziriteship will be for thirty <b>complete</b> days.

### Part 3
The Gemara now asks: <b>And according to Rav Mattana, the latter clause</b> of the mishna is <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Mattana</b> could have <b>said to you that</b> it is <b>as the latter clause teaches: The thirtieth day counts for</b> both <b>this and that,</b> i.e., it is considered both the last day of the first term of naziriteship, as well as the first day of the second term.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the novelty of the latter clause of the mishna? Is it that the legal status of <b>part of the day is like</b> that <b>of an entire</b> day? <b>But didn’t he</b> already <b>say this once</b> in an earlier clause in that mishna, as explained above? The Gemara answers: The latter clause was necessary; <b>lest you say</b> that <b>this</b> principle <b>applies</b> only <b>with regard to one</b> term of <b>naziriteship, but</b> with regard <b>to two</b> terms of <b>naziriteship, no,</b> this principle does not apply, the <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that part of the day is like that of an entire day, even to allow counting the beginning of the day as the last day of one term of naziriteship and the end of the day as the first day of another term of naziriteship.

### Part 5
The Gemara raises another question. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna (16a): <b>If he shaved</b> his hair on <b>day sixty less one,</b> i.e., on the fifty-ninth day after he vowed to observe two consecutive terms of naziriteship, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, <b>as the thirtieth day counts</b> as part <b>of his tally. Granted,</b> according <b>to Rav Mattana</b> this <b>works out well,</b> since the mishna is stating that the thirtieth day can be counted for both terms of naziriteship due to the principle that part of a day is like an entire day. <b>However, according to bar Padda, why do I</b> need the mishna to state that the thirtieth day counts in his tally? <b>Didn’t he say</b> that an unspecified term of naziriteship is for <b>thirty</b> days <b>less one?</b> It is obvious that the thirtieth day counts for the second term of naziriteship.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers: Bar Padda could have <b>said to you: I too rely on this.</b> This is my proof for the principle that an unspecified naziriteship lasts for twenty-nine days.

### Part 7
The Gemara continues to ask: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna (16a): In the case of <b>one who said: I am hereby a nazirite,</b> if he <b>became ritually impure</b> on the <b>thirtieth day, it negates the entire</b> tally, and he must start his naziriteship afresh. <b>Granted,</b> according <b>to Rav Mattana</b> it <b>works out well,</b> since he became impure before the conclusion of his naziriteship. <b>However, according to bar Padda</b> it is <b>difficult,</b> as the term of naziriteship ended at the conclusion of the twenty-ninth day, and one who becomes impure after completing his term does not have to observe a new term of naziriteship.
