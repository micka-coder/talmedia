### Part 1
The Gemara analyzes this ruling of the mishna: <b>A half-<i>kav</i> of bones, yes,</b> a nazirite must shave if he contracts impurity from them; <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of bones, no,</b> he does not. <b>What are the circumstances? If we say that they contain bones</b> that are <b>a barley-grain</b>-<b>bulk, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that it imparts ritual impurity <b>due to</b> the fact that it is <b>a bone that is a barley-grain</b>-<b>bulk. Rather,</b> the mishna is referring to a situation <b>where it has been made like flour.</b> In that case, a half-<b><i>kav</i></b> of bones render people and items impure in a tent, although they do not include a bone the volume of a barley-grain-bulk.

### Part 2
§ The mishna taught that a nazirite shaves <b>for a limb</b> severed <b>from a corpse and for a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> person, <b>upon</b> either of <b>which there is a fitting</b> quantity of <b>flesh.</b> The Gemara asks: If <b>there is not a fitting</b> quantity of <b>flesh upon them, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The nazirite does not shave for them. Reish Lakish said: The nazirite does shave for them.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara explains their respective opinions. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The nazirite does not shave for them, as</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches in the first clause</b> of the mishna in the list of sources of ritual impurity for which a nazirite must shave: <b>For a limb</b> severed <b>from a corpse and for a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> person that contains a fitting quantity of flesh. One can infer from this: <b>Those upon which there is an olive-bulk of flesh, yes,</b> he must shave for them, <b>but</b> if <b>there is not</b> that amount of flesh <b>upon them, no,</b> a nazirite need not shave due to them.

### Part 4
<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says</b> that <b>he shaves,</b> employing the following reasoning: <b>From</b> the fact that the mishna <b>does not teach</b> the following <b>in the latter clause,</b> i.e., the subsequent mishna (54a), in the list of sources of impurity for which a nazirite need not shave: A limb that does not contain a fitting quantity of flesh, one can infer that a nazirite is obligated to shave for a limb of that type.

### Part 5
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said to you,</b> in response to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish’s argument: The fact that the mishna omits this case from the list is not proof, as the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach in the latter clause anything that can be understood by inference</b> from the earlier mishna.

### Part 6
The Gemara raises a difficulty against this claim of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>But</b> the first clause of the mishna lists the case of <b>a half-<i>kav</i> of bones,</b> which <b>indicates: A half-<i>kav</i> of bones, yes,</b> a nazirite must shave for that; <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of bones, no,</b> he is not obligated to shave for that. <b>And</b> yet the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches in the latter clause</b> that a nazirite does not shave for <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of bones.</b> This shows that the next mishna does not rely on the rulings of this mishna. Rather, it lists all the items for which a nazirite need not shave.

### Part 7
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>There, had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>not</b> taught <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of bones, I would say</b> that he need <b>not</b> shave <b>even for touching it or carrying it. For this</b> reason it <b>was necessary</b> for the mishna <b>to teach</b> the case of <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of bones,</b> to indicate that <b>it is</b> only <b>for their</b> ritual impurity contracted in <b>a tent</b> that <b>a nazirite does not shave.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>But</b> the mishna lists <b>a half-<i>log</i> of blood</b> among those sources of impurity for which a nazirite must shave, <b>from which you</b> can <b>learn</b> that for <b>a half-<i>log</i> of blood, yes,</b> he shaves; for <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of blood, no,</b> he does not shave. <b>And</b> yet <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> that he need not shave for <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of blood.</b> The Gemara answers: It is also necessary to state this <i>halakha</i> unambiguously <b>there, to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva, as Rabbi Akiva said: A quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of blood that comes from two corpses renders</b> people and items <b>impure in a tent,</b> whereas the mishna simply states: A quarter-<i>log</i>, which indicates that all of the blood comes from a single corpse.

### Part 9
The Gemara analyzes the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this limb</b> severed <b>from a corpse</b> that is not covered by sufficient flesh? <b>If it contains a bone that is a barley-grain</b>-<b>bulk, what is Rabbi Yoḥanan’s reason</b> for maintaining that a nazirite does not have to shave for this ritual impurity? A bone of this size imparts impurity even if there is no flesh upon it. <b>And if it does not contain a bone that is a barley-grain</b>-<b>bulk, what is Reish Lakish’s reason</b> for saying that a nazirite must shave due to this bone? The Gemara explains that <b>Reish Lakish</b> could have <b>said to you: Actually</b> we are dealing with a limb <b>that does not contain a bone that is a barley-grain</b>-<b>bulk, and even so the Merciful One includes it</b> as a source of ritual impurity.

### Part 10
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And whoever in the open field touches one who is slain by the sword, or one who dies on his own,</b> or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days” (Numbers 19:16). This verse is expounded by the Sages as follows: <b>“In the open field”; this</b> is referring to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one who overlies a corpse,</b> even without touching it. <b>“One who is slain”; this</b> is referring to <b>a limb</b> slain, i.e., severed, <b>from a living</b> person, <b>that contains</b> enough flesh <b>for</b> the limb <b>to heal.</b>

### Part 11
The Sages further derive from the phrase “one who is slain by the sword” that the legal status of a metal <b>sword</b> in terms of its degree of ritual impurity <b>is like</b> that of <b>one who is slain,</b> i.e., a metal implement, e.g., a sword, that was rendered impure through contact with a corpse is impure to the same degree of severity as a corpse itself. <b>“Or one who dies on his own”; this is a limb that was slain,</b> i.e., severed, <b>from a corpse</b> and is covered with enough flesh that it would heal if he were alive. <b>“Or a bone of a man”; this is a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of bones. “Or a grave”; this is a sealed grave,</b> which imparts impurity when there is less than a handbreadth between the corpse and its cover.
