### Part 1
<b>and he said: I am hereby a nazirite</b> and therefore will refrain <b>from wine if it does not stand,</b> since I will force it to do so, <b>and it stood of its own accord,</b> without him causing it to stand. <b>Beit Shammai hold: This man’s intention [<i>turpeih</i>] is based upon him having it stand by his</b> own <b>hand, and he did not have it stand.</b> Since he did not cause it to stand, his vow of naziriteship takes effect. <b>And Beit Hillel hold:</b> His intention <b>is based upon</b> the fact <b>that it was prone, and</b> now <b>it has stood.</b> Since the cow stood up it does not matter what caused it to stand, and his vow of naziriteship does not take effect.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of the mishna as follows: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Even when Beit Shammai said</b> the vow is effective <b>they said</b> so <b>only with regard to one who said: They are hereby</b> forbidden <b>to me</b> as <b>an offering.</b> But <b>does he</b> take a vow and <b>extend any</b> prohibition <b>to the cow?</b> Since according to this approach, he explicitly mentions naziriteship, the cow is not rendered forbidden but is merely the subject of a condition of the vow, so why does Rabbi Yehuda speak of a prohibition on the cow?

### Part 3
The Gemara offers another explanation: <b>Rather,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where he said: I am hereby a nazirite</b> and therefore will refrain <b>from its flesh if it does not stand, and it stood of its own accord. Beit Shammai hold: That man’s intention is based upon</b> him <b>having it stand by his own hand, and he did not have it stand.</b> Since he did not cause it to stand, his vow of prohibition takes effect. <b>And Beit Hillel hold: This man’s intention is based upon</b> the fact <b>that it was prone, and</b> now <b>it has stood,</b> so his vow does not take effect.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> do <b>Beit Hillel hold</b> that <b>if</b> the cow <b>does not stand he will be a nazirite? But didn’t they say</b> that if one states: I am hereby a nazirite and therefore will refrain <b>from</b> the cow’s <b>flesh, he is not a nazirite,</b> just as they ruled in a case where one states that he is a nazirite from dried figs?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>They stated</b> their opinion <b>in accordance with the reasoning of Beit Shammai: According to our</b> opinion, <b>even</b> if the cow <b>does not stand he is also not a nazirite,</b> since naziriteship takes effect only if he vowed that products of the vine are forbidden to him. However, <b>according to your</b> reasoning <b>that you say he is a nazirite, in any event concede to us that this man’s intention is based upon</b> the fact <b>that</b> the cow <b>was prone, and it has stood,</b> so the naziriteship should not take effect. <b>And Beit Shammai</b> hold: <b>Isn’t this man’s intention based upon</b> him <b>having it stand by his own hand, and he did not have it stand?</b> Since his condition was not fulfilled, the naziriteship does not take effect.
