### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages with regard to the <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai mentioned in the mishna: Is the <i>halakha</i> that a nazirite must shave for <b>a bone that is a barley-grain</b>-<b>bulk a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>and</b> it was the status of <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of blood</b> that Rabbi Akiva sought to derive as <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, <b>and</b> with regard to this claim they said: <b>One does not derive an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai?

### Part 2
<b>Or perhaps</b> the ruling that <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of blood</b> imparts ritual impurity in a tent is the <b><i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>and</b> Rabbi Akiva sought to use the case of <b>a bone that is a barley-grain</b>-<b>bulk</b> as the source of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that a nazirite must shave for a quarter-<i>log</i> as well, to which the Sages replied that <b>one does not derive an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the unequivocal statement of a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A bone that is a barley-grain</b>-<b>bulk</b> is <b>a <i>halakha</i>, and a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of blood</b> is <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, <b>and one does not derive an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from a <i>halakha</i>.</b>
