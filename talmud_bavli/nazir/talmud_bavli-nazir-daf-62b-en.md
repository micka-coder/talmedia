### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The previous mishna taught that the naziriteship of women includes a stringency that does not apply to slaves. This mishna adds: There is a greater <b>stringency in</b> the case of <b>slaves than in</b> the case of <b>women, as</b> a man <b>can nullify the vows of his wife but he cannot nullify the vows of his slave,</b> despite the fact that he can prevent him from fulfilling them in practice. Similarly, if <b>he nullified</b> the naziriteship <b>of his wife it is permanently nullified,</b> and it remains nullified even if she is later divorced or widowed. Conversely, if <b>he nullified</b> the naziriteship <b>of his slave</b> by forcing him to violate the terms of his vow of naziriteship, when the slave <b>is emancipated he completes his naziriteship.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:4): With regard <b>to what</b> matter can <b>his master force</b> a slave? <b>With regard to naziriteship. However,</b> he <b>cannot</b> force his slave in the case <b>of</b> other <b>vows and valuations.</b> This <i>baraita</i> is apparently saying that a master cannot prevent his slave from fulfilling the terms of a vow.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different with regard to a nazirite</b> that a master can force his slave to transgress his naziriteship, <b>as the Merciful One states: “To bind his soul with a bond”</b> (Numbers 30:3), from which it is inferred that the Torah is referring only <b>to one whose soul is in his possession,</b> i.e., who is not owned by another; this <b>excludes a slave, whose soul is not in his possession</b> because he is under his master’s control. <b>If so,</b> then <b>even with regard to vows</b> that same <i>halakha</i> should apply <b>as well,</b> as that verse is written in the context of vows in general, not specifically vows of naziriteship. Why is a master unable to compel his slave to break a vow?

### Part 4
<b>Rav Sheshet said: With what are we dealing here?</b> With a case <b>where a cluster of grapes was placed before</b> the slave and he vowed not to derive benefit from it. <b>With regard to vows, when</b> he <b>is prohibited from</b> eating <b>this</b> cluster he <b>is not rendered prohibited from</b> eating <b>others;</b> therefore, the master <b>cannot force him</b> to eat it, as he has no reason to insist that the slave consume this particular cluster of grapes.

### Part 5
By contrast, <b>with regard to naziriteship, when</b> he <b>is prohibited from</b> eating <b>this</b> cluster he <b>is rendered prohibited from</b> consuming <b>all others;</b> therefore, the master <b>can force him</b> to eat. This is because the lack of food weakens the slave, who is the property of his master. The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to vows, are we not dealing</b> even with a situation <b>where he has only this cluster</b> before him and he vows not to eat it, in <b>which</b> case <b>if he does not eat it he is weakened?</b> Why can’t the master compel him to eat the grapes in this case?

### Part 6
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the difference between vows of naziriteship and other vows concerns a case <b>where there was a grape seed,</b> which provides only negligible nourishment, that was <b>placed before</b> the slave, and he vowed not to eat it. <b>With regard to vows,</b> concerning <b>which he is prohibited to</b> eat only <b>this</b> one seed, the master <b>cannot force him</b> to eat it, as refraining from eating a grape seed would not weaken him. <b>With regard to a nazirite, who is prohibited from</b> consuming <b>other</b> grape products <b>as well,</b> the master <b>can force him.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara again asks: <b>And with regard to vows, are we not dealing</b> even with a situation <b>where he has only this grape seed</b> in front of him, in <b>which</b> case <b>if he does not eat it he would be weakened?</b> Why, then, can the master compel him to violate only his naziriteship vow but not a regular vow?

### Part 8
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> does not in fact list cases in which a master can compel his slave to violate his vow, but rather means the following: <b>With regard to what</b> situation <b>is a master</b> who wants to negate his slave’s vow <b>required to force</b> his slave to violate his vow by stating explicitly that he does not want him to fulfill it? It is the case <b>of</b> a vow of <b>naziriteship. But he is not required to force him in</b> the case of other <b>vows and he is not required to force him in</b> the case of <b>an oath,</b> as these do not take effect at all.

### Part 9
<b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to oaths: “Or if anyone swear clearly with his lips <b>to do evil, or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). <b>Just as</b> the <b>“good”</b> mentioned in this verse is referring to <b>a voluntary</b> action, <b>so too</b> the <b>“evil”</b> is <b>voluntary,</b> e.g., if he takes an oath not to derive benefit from an item. This <b>excludes</b> a slave, whose oath or vow <b>would cause evil to others, as it is not in his power</b> to affect his master adversely. Therefore, his statement is invalid. Here too, as the owner will suffer if his slave’s diet is restricted, a slave may not accept a vow or an oath upon himself.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case where a slave took a vow of naziriteship but was prevented by his master from fulfilling the terms of his vow, the Sages engaged in a dispute what the <i>halakha</i> would be if he permanently <b>left his</b> master’s <b>presence,</b> i.e., he ran away without being emancipated. <b>Rabbi Meir says: He may not drink</b> wine. Since the slave is free in practice, his vow goes into effect. <b>And Rabbi Yosei says: He may drink</b> wine, as he is not emancipated.

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei <b>disagree with regard to</b> the following statement <b>of Shmuel? As Shmuel said:</b> With regard to one <b>who renounces ownership of his slave,</b> the slave <b>is emancipated, and he does not require a bill of manumission.</b> This <i>halakha</i> indicates that if a slave is free in practice, he no longer requires a bill of manumission but is automatically considered a freeman.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: If so, should one say that <b>Rabbi Meir is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel,</b> and therefore the slave is obligated in naziriteship as soon as he runs away, like any other freed slave, and <b>Rabbi Yosei is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel?</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> it is possible <b>that everyone is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel. Rather,</b> the mishna is referring to a case where the master refused to declare the runaway ownerless, and was intent on recovering him. Consequently, the slave is not in fact a freeman at all, and the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree with regard to the following: Rabbi Yosei, <b>the one who says</b> that <b>he may drink</b> wine, <b>maintains</b> that the slave <b>will ultimately return and come back to</b> his master, and therefore it is preferable for him <b>to drink wine so that he should not be weakened</b> by the time he returns. <b>And according to</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>the one who says</b> that <b>he may not drink</b> wine, he <b>maintains</b> that it is better that the slave <b>should suffer</b> by being deprived of wine, <b>so that he will return to</b> his master, as the desire to drink wine will spur him to return.
