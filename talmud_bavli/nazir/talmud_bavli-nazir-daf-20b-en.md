### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need for Rav to state <b>this</b> at all? <b>Now that it is</b> already <b>said</b> with regard to <b>a stringent</b> case, where there were two sets of witnesses who generally have full credibility yet <b>Rav said</b> that the testimony is considered divided, with regard to <b>a lenient</b> case, involving a conflict within one pair of witnesses, who cannot each obligate him in naziriteship, would he <b>not say</b> that a conflict in their testimony causes it to be disregarded? Of course the testimonies are disregarded if the conflict is within the same set of witnesses. <b>They say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>There is no conflicting</b> testimony <b>in</b> a case of <b>counting,</b> as since one of them counted a smaller number and the second counted a larger number, they do not conflict at all, as the smaller number is included in the larger one.<br>In a standard term of naziriteship, the nazirite shaves on the day after the close of his term, the thirty-first day. One who shaved on the final day of his term, the thirtieth day, has fulfilled his obligation. If one vowed to observe two consecutive terms of naziriteship, he shaves for the end of the second term on the sixty-first day from the start of the first term, as that is the thirty-first day of the second term. If one shaved for the first term on the thirtieth day, then even if he shaved for the second term on the fifty-ninth day, he has fulfilled his obligation.
