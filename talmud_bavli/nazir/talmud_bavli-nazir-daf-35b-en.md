is referring even to undomesticated animals, as <b>an undomesticated animal is included</b> in the general category of <b>animal.</b>

### Part 2
Rav Yehuda of Diskarta <b>said to</b> Rava: How can you suggest that in this verse <b>an undomesticated animal is included</b> in the general category of <b>animal?</b> It is <b>written: “Herd” and: “Flock,” and this</b> entire phrase <b>is a detail, and a generalization,</b> and a detail, from which <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail,</b> which are herd and flock, not undomesticated animals.

### Part 3
§ The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that it is so,</b> that in the methodology of generalizations and details, the generalizations are similar to the details? It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the mitzva to bring money for the second tithe to Jerusalem: “And you shall bestow the money on all that your heart desires, on cattle, on sheep, on wine, and on strong drink, and on whatever your soul requests” (Deuteronomy 14:26).

### Part 4
The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: The phrase <b>“And you shall bestow the money on all that your heart desires”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> as no particular type of food is specified. The phrase <b>“on cattle, on sheep, on wine, and on strong drink”</b> is <b>a detail,</b> as specific foods are mentioned. And when the verse concludes: <b>“On whatever your soul requests,”</b> it <b>then generalized</b> again, as no specific type of food is stated.

### Part 5
Since the verse is formulated as <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, you may deduce</b> that it is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail. Just as</b> the items mentioned in <b>the detail</b> are clearly <b>defined as the produce of produce,</b> i.e., not only the produce itself but also items that come from it, such as grapes from a seed, <b>and</b> they are also items <b>grown from the ground,</b> as all of these items grow from the ground or receive their main sustenance from it, <b>so too,</b> the generalization includes <b>all</b> items that are <b>the produce of produce and are grown from the ground.</b> This includes birds, but it does not include fish, water, or salt.

### Part 6
§ The Gemara discusses a series of problems with regard to these and other methods of halakhic exegesis: <b>Now,</b> in the case of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, one derives</b> that all items which are <b>like the detail</b> are included. However, if that is so, <b>what purpose does the last generalization</b> stated in the verse serve? The same conclusion would be reached if the verse had stated merely a generalization and a detail. The Gemara answers: The <b>purpose</b> of the last generalization is <b>to add all that is similar to it,</b> i.e., even those articles or cases not explicitly listed among the details.

### Part 7
<b>And furthermore,</b> in the case of <b>a detail, and a generalization, and a detail, one</b> again <b>derives</b> that all items which are <b>like the detail</b> are included. If so, <b>what purpose does the last detail</b> stated in the verse serve? The same conclusion would apply if there was simply a detail and a generalization. The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it were <b>not</b> for <b>the last detail, I would say</b> that <b>the generalization becomes added to the detail,</b> which is broadened in all possible ways. Therefore, the last detail limits the generalization to items or cases that are similar to the detail.

### Part 8
The Gemara continues this line of questioning. <b>And now</b> that it has been established that both with regard to <b>two generalizations and a detail,</b> i.e., a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, <b>and two details and a generalization,</b> i.e., a detail, a generalization, and a detail, <b>one derives</b> that all items that are <b>like the detail</b> are included, <b>what</b> difference <b>is there between this</b> method <b>and that</b> one? The two methods are apparently identical.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a difference between them, <b>as whereas</b> in a case of <b>two generalizations and a detail, if there is</b> another <b>detail that is similar to</b> the detail specified in the verse <b>even in one aspect, one includes</b> it, due to the two generalizations. By contrast, in the case of <b>two details and a generalization, if there is</b> another <b>detail that is similar to</b> the one mentioned in the verse <b>in two aspects, one includes it.</b> However, if it is similar <b>in</b> only <b>one aspect one does not include</b> it, as the <i>halakha</i> is limited by two details.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks another question: <b>Now,</b> in the method of <b>a detail and a generalization, the generalization becomes added to the detail, and all matters are included</b> by the generalization. <b>And</b> the method of <b>restriction and amplification also amplifies</b> and includes <b>everything, and</b> therefore <b>all matters are included</b> in both cases. If so, <b>what</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the method of <b>restriction and amplification and</b> that of <b>a detail and a generalization?</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> the following difference, <b>as whereas</b> in the method of <b>a detail and a generalization one includes</b> and renders forbidden to a nazirite <b>even leaves and tendrils</b> of the vine, with the method of <b>restriction and amplification</b> one includes less, as <b>tendrils, yes,</b> they are included in the prohibition, whereas <b>leaves, no,</b> they are not included.

### Part 12
§ <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>all prohibitions that are</b> written <b>in the Torah, a permitted</b> substance <b>does not combine with a forbidden</b> substance. If one eats a permitted food with a forbidden food and together they constitute the minimum prohibited measure, he is exempt from punishment for this act of consumption. This principle applies to all <i>halakhot</i> <b>except for the prohibitions of a nazirite,</b> who is liable for eating a mixture of that kind, <b>as the Torah said</b> with regard to a nazirite: “Neither shall he drink anything <b>soaked</b> in grapes” (Numbers 6:3). This verse indicates that a nazirite is prohibited from consuming not only wine and vinegar, but also any food that was soaked in these liquids.
