### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> the same <i>halakha</i>: The shaving of a leper does not count for the shaving of naziriteship, as <b>this</b> one, a leper, shaves <b>before immersion in water, and that</b> one, an impure nazirite, shaves <b>after immersion water. This</b> one, the leper, shaves <b>before</b> the <b>blood is sprinkled, and that</b> one, the pure nazirite, shaves <b>after</b> the <b>blood is sprinkled.</b>

### Part 2
§ The mishna taught <b>that the shaving of leprosy</b> overrides the shaving of a nazirite only when he is a confirmed leper. <b>Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma: Those four shavings about which</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>spoke,</b> the four that a nazirite performs for his leprosy and impurity, are they all <b>due to</b> the <b>mitzva</b> of shaving, <b>or</b> are some of them not performed for the sake of a mitzva, but <b>for the sake of removing hair</b> that grew in <b>impurity,</b> so that other hair can grow?

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <b>difference</b> whether he shaves for one reason or another? The Gemara explains: It is relevant with regard <b>to removing</b> hair <b>with a depilatory. If you say</b> that the reason is <b>due to a mitzva, removing with a depilatory</b> is <b>not</b> an option, as the mitzva is specifically to shave. <b>But if you say</b> the reason is <b>due to the removal of hair of impurity, even if he rubs it with a depilatory</b> that is <b>also</b> effective.

### Part 4
<b>What</b> then is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:1): <b>And he shaves</b> with <b>four</b> acts of <b>shaving.</b> Now <b>if it should enter your mind</b> that the reason is <b>for the sake of removing hair of impurity, even three</b> shavings should <b>be enough for him,</b> two for his leprosy, and the last one for his naziriteship of purity. Since the third shaving is performed only to remove his hair of impurity so that he can start his pure naziriteship afresh, why is it included? <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that all four shavings are <b>due to</b> the <b>mitzva</b> of shaving. The Gemara says: <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that this is the case.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Gentiles do not have naziriteship,</b> i.e., the <i>halakhot</i> of naziriteship do not apply to gentiles. They are not subject to the prohibitions of a nazirite, nor does one accept their offerings at the end of naziriteship. However, <b>women and</b> Canaanite <b>slaves do have naziriteship.</b> The mishna adds: There is a greater <b>stringency in</b> the case of <b>women than in</b> the case of <b>slaves, as</b> a master <b>may force his slave</b> to drink wine, shave his hair, or become ritually impure from a corpse, despite the slave’s vow of naziriteship, <b>but</b> a husband <b>cannot force his wife</b> to transgress her naziriteship.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna <b>teaches</b> that <b>gentiles do not have naziriteship,</b> whereas women and slaves can be nazirites. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? It is <b>as the Sages taught,</b> that the beginning of the passage about naziriteship, which states: <b>“Speak to the children of Israel”</b> (Numbers 6:2), serves to emphasize that these <i>halakhot</i> apply to Jews, <b>but not to the gentiles.</b> Furthermore, the continuation of the verse: <b>“And say to them,</b> when a man or woman shall clearly utter a vow,” serves <b>to include slaves.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to include slaves? <b>Haven’t you said</b> the following principle: <b>Any mitzva that a woman is obligated in</b> its performance, <b>a slave is</b> also <b>obligated in</b> its performance? Since the <i>halakhot</i> of naziriteship apply to a woman, they should likewise apply to slaves.

### Part 8
<b>Rava said: Here</b> it <b>is different, as</b> with regard to vows <b>the verse states: “To bind his soul with a bond”</b> (Numbers 30:3), and the Sages expounded that this is referring only <b>to one whose soul is in his possession,</b> i.e., who is under his own jurisdiction. This <b>excludes a slave, whose soul is not in his possession,</b> but who is under his master’s control. The verse from Leviticus is necessary, lest you say that <b>since</b> a slave’s <b>soul is not in his possession,</b> one should <b>say</b> that <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a nazirite as well,</b> he <b>cannot</b> undertake this vow notwithstanding the principle that slaves have similar <i>halakhot</i> to women with regard to obligations, who can become nazirites. The aforementioned verse <b>teaches us</b> that a slave can in fact take a vow of naziriteship.

### Part 9
The Gemara returns to the earlier exposition of the verse. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that the verse specifies: <b>“Speak to the children of Israel,” but not to the gentiles.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And anywhere that “Israel” is written,</b> are <b>gentiles not</b> included in that verse? <b>But</b> there is a counterexample in the verse written <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>valuations, as it is written: “Speak to the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), <b>and it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The children of Israel can take a valuation vow but gentiles cannot take a valuation vow.</b> If a gentile declares: I undertake to donate the value of so-and-so, his vow does not take effect.

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that this means that gentiles <b>cannot be</b> the subject <b>of a valuation</b> either, i.e., if a Jew says: I am obligated to give the value of so-and-so the gentile, his vow would not take effect. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the inclusive expression: “When <b>a man</b> shall clearly utter a vow of persons to the Lord, according to your valuation” (Leviticus 27:2), to teach that in this regard, every “man,” even a gentile, is included in <i>halakhot</i> of valuations. Inasmuch as the Torah also states with regard to a nazirite: “When a man or woman shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite” (Numbers 6:2), perhaps one should include gentiles in the <i>halakhot</i> of naziriteship as well.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> in the case of naziriteship, it <b>is different, as the verse states: “For his father, or for his mother,</b> for his brother, or for his sister, <b>he shall not defile himself”</b> (Numbers 6:7). From here it is derived that this mitzva applies only <b>to one who has a father.</b> This <b>excludes a gentile, who does not have a father.</b> The Gemara asks: With regard <b>to what</b> <i>halakha</i> does a gentile lack a father? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>with regard to inheritance, but didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A gentile inherits</b> the estate of <b>his father by Torah law, as it is stated: “Because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as an inheritance”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:5)?

### Part 12
<b>Rather,</b> this mitzva of naziriteship applies <b>to one who is warned concerning the honor of his father,</b> and as the mitzva to honor one’s father does not apply to a gentile, it is as though he has no father. The Gemara asks: <b>Is it written: Honor your father, in the context of a nazirite?</b> What is the connection between these two issues? <b>Rather, the verse states</b> with regard to a nazirite: <b>“For his father, or for his mother,</b> for his brother, or for his sister, <b>he shall not defile himself”</b> (Numbers 6:7), and it should be understood as referring <b>to one who has</b> the potential to become <b>ritually impure,</b>
