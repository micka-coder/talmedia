### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> the same <i>halakha</i>: The shaving of a leper does not count for the shaving of naziriteship, as <b>this</b> one, a leper, shaves <b>before immersion in water, and that</b> one, an impure nazirite, shaves <b>after immersion water. This</b> one, the leper, shaves <b>before</b> the <b>blood is sprinkled, and that</b> one, the pure nazirite, shaves <b>after</b> the <b>blood is sprinkled.</b>

### Part 2
§ The mishna taught <b>that the shaving of leprosy</b> overrides the shaving of a nazirite only when he is a confirmed leper. <b>Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma: Those four shavings about which</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>spoke,</b> the four that a nazirite performs for his leprosy and impurity, are they all <b>due to</b> the <b>mitzva</b> of shaving, <b>or</b> are some of them not performed for the sake of a mitzva, but <b>for the sake of removing hair</b> that grew in <b>impurity,</b> so that other hair can grow?

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <b>difference</b> whether he shaves for one reason or another? The Gemara explains: It is relevant with regard <b>to removing</b> hair <b>with a depilatory. If you say</b> that the reason is <b>due to a mitzva, removing with a depilatory</b> is <b>not</b> an option, as the mitzva is specifically to shave. <b>But if you say</b> the reason is <b>due to the removal of hair of impurity, even if he rubs it with a depilatory</b> that is <b>also</b> effective.

### Part 4
<b>What</b> then is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:1): <b>And he shaves</b> with <b>four</b> acts of <b>shaving.</b> Now <b>if it should enter your mind</b> that the reason is <b>for the sake of removing hair of impurity, even three</b> shavings should <b>be enough for him,</b> two for his leprosy, and the last one for his naziriteship of purity. Since the third shaving is performed only to remove his hair of impurity so that he can start his pure naziriteship afresh, why is it included? <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that all four shavings are <b>due to</b> the <b>mitzva</b> of shaving. The Gemara says: <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that this is the case.
