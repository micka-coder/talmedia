### Part 1
<b>The <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>holds: Once</b> the <b>blood has been sprinkled on her behalf</b> she is <b>immediately permitted</b> to drink <b>wine, and</b> therefore <b>she is not downcast.</b> Consequently, the husband has no right to nullify her naziriteship vow at that point, as her vow does not affect him. <b>And Rabbi Akiva holds: Even</b> if the blood has yet to be sprinkled and wine remains forbidden to her, as soon as <b>an animal is slaughtered</b> for one of her offerings the husband <b>can no</b> longer <b>nullify</b> the vow, <b>due to the loss of consecrated</b> property. If he were to nullify her vow she would have no further need of the offerings, and it is prohibited to waste Sanctuary property.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Zeira objects to this: And why</b> should the result be a loss to the Sanctuary? He can avoid this by <b>sprinkling their blood not for the sake</b> of the offerings of a nazirite, <b>and he will</b> thereby <b>permit the meat</b> of the offering to <b>be eaten,</b> and the consecrated animal will not go to waste. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the communal peace-offering of two <b>sheep</b> that accompanies the two loaves on <b><i>Shavuot</i>, if one slaughtered them not for the sake</b> of that offering, <b>or slaughtered them before their time,</b> on the eve of the Festival, <b>or after their time,</b> after the Festival, <b>the blood shall be sprinkled,</b> although not for the sake of that offering, as it is no longer fit for that purpose, <b>and the meat is eaten.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And if it was a Shabbat,</b> the blood <b>may not be sprinkled.</b> Since the meat cannot be eaten on that day, sprinkling the blood is considered a form of unnecessary labor on Shabbat. <b>And if he sprinkled</b> the blood on Shabbat anyway, the offering <b>is accepted,</b> and he must wait <b>to burn</b> its sacrificial <b>parts</b> on the altar <b>in the evening,</b> after the conclusion of Shabbat. In any case, this shows that it is permitted to sprinkle the blood of an offering not for its own sake <i>ab initio</i> so that its flesh can be eaten.

### Part 4
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>If he had slaughtered</b> only the woman’s naziriteship offerings of the <b>burnt-offering or</b> the <b>peace-offering, so too,</b> he may certainly proceed to sprinkle the blood not for the sake of that offering, to avoid the loss of a consecrated animal. In that case Rabbi Akiva would agree that the husband can still nullify her vow. <b>However, with what are we dealing here?</b> It is with a case <b>where he slaughtered the sin-offering first.</b> Since a sin-offering whose blood was sprinkled not for its sake is invalid, if the husband were to nullify her vow this would cause a loss of consecrated property.

### Part 5
The Gemara cites the source that the order of a nazirite’s offerings may be changed and the sin-offering may be sacrificed first. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (45a): <b>If he shaved</b> after the sacrifice <b>of one of the three</b> nazirite offerings, either the burnt-offering, the peace-offering, or the sin-offering, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation.

### Part 6
§ The mishna taught: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that a husband cannot nullify his wife’s vow, <b>said?</b> It is <b>with regard to a shaving of ritual purity; however, with regard to a shaving of impurity</b> the husband can <b>nullify</b> it if he wishes. <b>And Rabbi Meir says: He may even nullify</b> the vow <b>at</b> her <b>shaving of purity because he can say: I do not want a shaven wife.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara analyzes these opinions: <b>And the first <i>tanna</i></b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response to Rabbi Meir’s argument: It is <b>possible</b> for her to compensate <b>by</b> wearing <b>a wig,</b> and therefore she would not appear shaven, and her husband would have no cause for complaint. <b>And Rabbi Meir holds:</b> As for compensating <b>by</b> wearing <b>a wig, since</b> it is <b>dirty he is not amenable</b> to this solution, and he may therefore nullify her vow.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A man can vow</b> that <b>his</b> minor <b>son should be a nazirite,</b> i.e., a father can declare his son a nazirite, <b>but a woman cannot vow</b> that <b>her son should be a nazirite. How so;</b> what are the details of this naziriteship? If the son <b>shaved</b> his hair, thereby demonstrating his rejection of the vow imposed by his father; <b>or</b> if <b>his relatives shaved him;</b> or if the son <b>objected</b> by saying that he has no desire for this naziriteship; <b>or if his relatives objected</b> on his behalf, the naziriteship is canceled.

### Part 9
If this son who canceled the naziriteship <b>had animals separated</b> for his offerings, the one set aside for <b>the sin-offering must die, and the burnt-offering is sacrificed as a burnt-offering, and</b> the <b>peace-offering is sacrificed as a peace-offering. And</b> the peace-offering <b>is eaten for one day,</b> like the peace-offering of a nazirite, rather than the two days of a regular peace-offering, <b>and it does not require bread,</b> i.e., the loaves that accompany a nazirite’s peace-offering.

### Part 10
If <b>he had unallocated funds,</b> they <b>will be allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings. If he had <b>allocated funds</b> for his offerings, <b>the money for the sin-offering is taken</b> and cast <b>into the Dead Sea,</b> as one may <b>not benefit</b> from it <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but</b> if he benefits <b>from it,</b> he is <b>not</b> liable to bring an offering for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. With <b>the money for</b> the <b>burnt-offering they bring a burnt-offering;</b> it is prohibited to derive benefit from those coins <b>and</b> if he benefits <b>from it,</b> he is liable to bring an offering for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. With <b>the money for</b> the <b>peace-offering they bring a peace-offering, and</b> it <b>is eaten for one day and does not require bread.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that <b>a man</b> can vow that his son should be a nazirite, <b>but a woman cannot</b> do so. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>with regard to a nazirite. And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b>
