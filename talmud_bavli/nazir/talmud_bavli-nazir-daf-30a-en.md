### Part 1
After all, he still <b>remains under his father’s authority</b> with regard to naziriteship, as he has yet to develop two pubic hairs. <b>Rather,</b> one must explain <b>that he said</b> the following: <b>I shall be</b> a nazirite <b>due to</b> my <b>father; I shall be</b> a nazirite <b>due to my own</b> vow. In other words, he did not link his statement to the question of whether he was old enough to vow but to the issue of his father’s authority with regard to naziriteship, i.e., whether he had developed two hairs.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: According to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>if he had developed two</b> pubic <b>hairs from the outset,</b> i.e., before his father vowed, he would <b>stand</b> bound <b>by his own naziriteship, and</b> if he reached physical maturity <b>at the end,</b> i.e., after the vow ended, he would <b>stand</b> bound <b>by his father’s</b> vow of <b>naziriteship. But if he developed</b> two hairs <b>in the middle</b> of his naziriteship term, of <b>what</b> use would the son’s vow be?

### Part 3
The Gemara clarifies: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> that a father can vow on behalf of his son <b>until he reaches the age of vows.</b> The reason is that this stage is by rabbinic law, and therefore the fact that the son has reached this stage does not automatically cancel the father’s vow. The son would complete his term and bring his offerings.

### Part 4
<b>However, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said</b> that a father can vow for his son only <b>until he develops two</b> pubic <b>hairs, what can be said?</b> If he grew two hairs during his father’s naziriteship it is no longer in effect, as by Torah law he is no longer under his father’s authority, so what is the <i>halakha</i> in that case? The Sages <b>say</b> in response: According <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, this child <b>has no rectification until he sits for his</b> term of naziriteship <b>and</b> also <b>sits for</b> the naziriteship <b>of his father,</b> i.e., he must be a nazirite for sixty days, to ensure that he completes a full term of thirty days, either for his own naziriteship or for that of his father.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A man can shave,</b> i.e., bring the offerings at the close of his term of naziriteship, <b>by</b> using offerings originally designated for <b>his father’s naziriteship, but a woman cannot shave by</b> means of the offerings for <b>her father’s naziriteship. How so;</b> how is this <i>halakha</i> applied? It applies to <b>one whose father was a nazirite and separated unallocated money for his naziriteship,</b> i.e., he did not state which coins were for which of his offerings, <b>and he died</b> before buying the animals, <b>and</b> the son <b>said</b> after his father’s death: <b>I am hereby a nazirite on the condition that I will shave by</b> means of <b>the money</b> that my <b>father</b> set aside.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> In that case <b>these</b> coins are <b>allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings, and the son may not use them, as <b>this is not</b> the case of the <i>halakha</i> that a son <b>can shave by</b> using <b>his father’s naziriteship.</b> Rather, <b>who is</b> the son <b>who can shave by</b> using <b>his father’s naziriteship?</b> This is referring to a son <b>and his father who were</b> both <b>nazirites</b> during his father’s lifetime, <b>and his father separated unallocated money for his naziriteship and died; this is the one who may shave by</b> using <b>his father’s naziriteship.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this difference between a man and a woman? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>with regard to a nazirite.</b> The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious</b> that this is so, even without this <i>halakha</i>. <b>What</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this? Is Rabbi Yoḥanan coming to say <b>that a son inherits</b> from <b>his father</b> whereas <b>a daughter</b> does <b>not,</b> and therefore only a son who inherits from his father can use his animals, but not a daughter? This is obvious, as it is stated in the Torah that a daughter does not inherit from her father if he has a son (see Numbers 27:8).

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this <i>halakha</i> is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>when he has only a daughter,</b> who does inherit from him. <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>we learned</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>heirs,</b> i.e., that the <i>halakha</i> is that all heirs, including a daughter, can shave by means of their father’s offerings,
