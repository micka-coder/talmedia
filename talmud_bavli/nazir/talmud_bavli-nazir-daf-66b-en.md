### Part 1
<b>Seize</b> the opportunity <b>and</b> quickly <b>recite a blessing</b> over the cup of blessing for the Grace after Meals. <b>And similarly, Rav Huna said to his son, Rabba: Seize</b> the opportunity <b>and recite a blessing.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that one who recites a blessing is preferable</b> to one who answers amen? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The one who answers amen is greater than the one who recites the blessing? And Rabbi Nehorai said to him: By Heavens, it is so. Know</b> that this is true, <b>as the military assistants [<i>gulyarim</i>]</b> descend to the battlefield an d <b>initiate the war and the mighty</b> follow them and <b>prevail.</b> The amen that follows a blessing is compared to the mighty who join the war after the assistants, illustrating that answering amen is more significant than reciting the initial blessing.

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: This <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Both the one who recites a bless-ing and the one who answers amen are included</b> among those who “stand up and bless” (Nehemiah 9:5), <b>but one hurries to first</b> reward <b>the one who recites the blessing.</b> This <i>baraita</i> apparently holds that reciting the blessing is greater than answering amen.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is stated: “And all your children [<i>banayikh</i>] shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children”</b> (Isaiah 54:13). The Sages interpreted this verse homiletically: Do not read it as: “Your children [<i>banayikh</i>],” but as: Your builders [<i>bonayikh</i>]. Torah scholars are those who build peace for their generation.
