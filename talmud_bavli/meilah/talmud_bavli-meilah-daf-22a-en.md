### Part 1
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> yet another version of Reish Lakish’s question. <b>He raised a contradiction between</b> the mishna here involving <b>purses</b> and another mishna referring <b>to a <i>log</i></b> measure. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 7:4): In the case of <b>one who purchases wine from among the Samaritans [<i>Kutim</i>]</b> and there is reason to suspect that <i>teruma</i> and tithes were not separated, and he cannot separate them before the start of Shabbat, what should he do?

### Part 2
The mishna explains that he proceeds as follows. If, for example, there are one hundred <i>log</i> of wine in the barrels, he <b>says: Two <i>log</i> that I will separate in the future are <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the established average measure of <i>teruma</i> is one-fiftieth; <b>ten</b> <i>log</i> are <b>first tithe;</b> and one-tenth of the remainder, which is <b>nine</b> <i>log</i>, are <b>second tithe. And he desacralizes</b> the second tithe that he will separate in the future, transferring its sanctity to money, <b>and he may drink</b> the wine in the barrel <b>immediately,</b> relying on the separation that he will perform later. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</b> one from doing so. These three Sages reject the principle of retroactive designation, upon which this method relies, as at the time of the declaration the identity of the particular portions of wine that will be <i>teruma</i> and tithes is unknown. Even according to Rabbi Meir, one can rely on retroactive designation only in a case where he says: That I will separate in the future. In the case of the mishna here, each <i>peruta</i> might be the consecrated one, and one cannot rely on the last one. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: The latter clause of the mishna</b> is referring to a situation <b>where one said: This purse will not be exempt from consecration,</b> in which case he is understood as referring to the last <i>peruta</i> left in the purse.
