### Part 1
And in a case where the <b>blood of one</b> of the sin offerings <b>was sprinkled, do you not concede that just as</b> the sprinkling of <b>its blood exempts its meat from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse, so too, it exempts the meat of the other</b> animal <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse?</b>

### Part 2
If so, one may infer from here by an <i>a fortiori</i> inference with regard to the case of sprinkling the blood of meat that left the courtyard: <b>If</b> the sprinkling of its blood <b>spared the meat of the other</b> animal <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse, even though</b> that animal <b>is unfit,</b> as it is a leftover sin offering, it is only <b>right that</b> the blood that was sprinkled should <b>exempt its own meat,</b> despite the fact that it left the courtyard.

### Part 3
With regard to this reply by Rabbi Akiva, <b>Reish Lakish says in the name of Rav Oshaya: Rabbi Akiva gave a deceptive response to that student</b> of his, Rabbi Shimon. Reish Lakish elaborates: Based on Rabbi Akiva’s reply, one would think that if the two sin offerings were slaughtered <b>at the same time,</b> then <b>yes,</b> the blood of one sin offering exempts the meat of the other from the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse. But if they were slaughtered <b>one after the other,</b> it does <b>not</b> exempt the meat of the other offering.

### Part 4
But <b>since</b> in either case the other offering, whose blood was not sprinkled, <b>is unfit,</b> as it is a leftover sin offering, <b>what</b> difference does it make <b>to me whether</b> they were slaughtered <b>at the same time</b> or whether they were slaughtered <b>one after the other?</b> In either case, according to Rabbi Akiva, the sprinkling of one should exempt the meat of the other from the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse.

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Reish Lakish</b> in response: <b>And you,</b> who raise this difficulty, <b>do you not</b> also <b>say the same,</b> that there is a difference between a case where they were slaughtered at the same time, and are therefore considered one entity, when the sprinkling of the blood of one offering exempts the meat of the other, and a case where they were slaughtered one after the other, and are therefore considered two separate entities, which means that the blood of one offering does not exempt the meat of the other?

### Part 6
But in a case <b>where</b> one <b>separated two guilt offerings as a guarantee</b> for his obligation of a single guilt offering, i.e., that if one were lost he could achieve atonement by means of the second, <b>and one slaughtered both of them,</b> and the priest <b>first brought up</b> the <b>sacrificial portions of one of them</b> onto the altar <b>before sprinkling</b> any blood, and then sprinkled the blood of the other offering, <b>would you not concede that</b> even <b>if</b> the sacrificial portions of this offering whose blood was not sprinkled <b>ascended</b> the altar, that <b>they shall descend</b> without being sacrificed? The proper procedure is that first the blood is sprinkled and only then are the sacrificial portions brought up onto the altar to be sacrificed.

### Part 7
Rabbi Yoḥanan analyzes this case: <b>And if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> to say that even when the two offerings were slaughtered one after the other they are still considered as <b>one entity, why</b> is it the <i>halakha</i> that <b>if</b> the sacrificial portions <b>ascended</b> the altar, <b>they shall descend? Doesn’t Ulla say</b> that <b>sacrificial portions of offerings of lesser sanctity which</b> one <b>brought up</b> to the altar <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling of</b> the offering’s <b>blood,</b> and are therefore not yet fit for the altar, <b>shall not descend,</b> but are sacrificed, as the sacrificial portions <b>have become the food of</b> the <b>altar,</b> by virtue of their placement upon it?

### Part 8
Reish Lakish <b>was silent,</b> as he had no answer to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s difficulty. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> in this regard: <b>We have cut off the legs of the child,</b> i.e., I have refuted Reish Lakish’s opinion by raising a difficulty that eliminates the basis for his opinion.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to establishing liability for misuse of consecrated items, <b>there is</b> an aspect of <b>leniency and</b> an aspect of <b>stringency in the act</b> of sprinkling the <b>blood of offerings of the most sacred order. But</b> with regard to the sprinkling of the blood <b>in</b> the case of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> it contains <b>in its entirety</b> aspects of <b>stringency,</b> i.e., there are only aspects of stringency.

### Part 10
<b>How so?</b> The status of <b>offerings of the most sacred order</b> is that <b>before the sprinkling of blood, one is</b> liable <b>for misusing their sacrificial portions</b> that are to be burned on the altar, <b>and for</b> misusing <b>the meat</b> that is to be eaten by the priests. Since the meat is prohibited prior to sprinkling the blood, it is in the category of items consecrated to God, which are subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse. <b>After the sprinkling of the blood</b> of offerings of the most sacred order, <b>one is</b> still liable <b>for misuse of their sacrificial portions,</b> as they remain prohibited to be eaten and are in the category of items consecrated to God, <b>but one is not</b> liable <b>for misuse of the meat,</b> as it is now permitted for consumption by the priests. This explains how there is an aspect of leniency in the sprinkling of the blood of offerings of the most sacred order.

### Part 11
By contrast, <b>for</b> consumption of both <b>this,</b> the sacrificial portions, <b>and that,</b> the meat, after the sprinkling of the blood, <b>one is liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>due to</b> violation of the prohibition against consumption of <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> and the prohibition against consumption of <b><i>notar</i>, and</b> the prohibition against consumption of sacrificial meat while <b>ritually impure.</b> Consequently, <b>the act of</b> sprinkling <b>blood of offerings of the most sacred order</b> is <b>found</b> to contain an aspect of <b>leniency and</b> an aspect of <b>stringency.</b>

### Part 12
<b>But with regard to</b> the sprinkling of the blood of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, all of their</b> aspects are of <b>stringency. How so?</b> The status of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity</b> is that <b>before the sprinkling of</b> the <b>blood, one is not</b> liable for <b>misuse, not for</b> their <b>sacrificial portions nor for the meat. After the sprinkling of</b> the <b>blood, one is</b> liable for <b>misuse of</b> their <b>sacrificial portions, but one is not</b> liable for <b>misuse of the meat.</b> This explains how the sprinkling of the blood in the case of offerings of lesser sanctity causes a stringency in terms of the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse.

### Part 13
And <b>for</b> consumption of both <b>this,</b> the sacrificial portions, <b>and that,</b> the meat, after the sprinkling of the blood, <b>one is liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>due to</b> violation of the prohibition against consumption of <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> and of the prohibition against consumption of <b><i>notar</i>, and</b> of the prohibition against consumption of sacrificial meat while <b>ritually impure.</b> Consequently, in <b>the act of</b> sprinkling the <b>blood of offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> it is <b>found</b> that <b>all of their</b> aspects are of <b>stringency.</b>

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna <b>teaches:</b> After the sprinkling of the blood of offerings of the most sacred order, one is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing the meat.</b> The Gemara infers from this <b>that there is no</b> liability for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>but there is a prohibition</b> for the priest to eat from it even after the blood has been sprinkled. The Gemara therefore asks: <b>But why</b> is there such a prohibition? <b>Isn’t</b> the meat <b>the property of the priests</b> after the blood has been sprinkled, and therefore it is permitted for them in consumption?

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as the above inference is invalid. The reason that the mishna taught that one is not liable, rather than saying that the meat is permitted, is as follows: <b>Since the first clause mentions</b> the phrase: One is liable for <b>misusing, the latter clause also mentions</b> the parallel phrase: One is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing.</b> Therefore, the above inference is incorrect, as there is in fact no prohibition for the priests to eat the meat.

### Part 16
The Gemara continues to analyze the mishna. <b>Say the latter clause:</b> But <b>with regard to</b> the sprinkling of the blood of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, all of their</b> aspects are of <b>stringency. How so?</b> The status of <b>the meat of offerings of lesser sanctity</b> is that <b>before the sprinkling of</b> the <b>blood, one is not</b> liable for <b>misuse, not for</b> their meat <b>nor for their sacrificial portions. And one is not liable due to</b> violation of the prohibition against <b><i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, or</b> the consumption of sacrificial meat while <b>ritually impure. After the sprinkling of</b> the <b>blood, one is</b> liable for <b>misuse of their sacrificial portions, and one is not</b> liable for <b>misuse of the meat.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara infers as above: <b>There is no</b> liability for <b>misuse</b> of the meat of offerings of lesser sanctity, <b>but there is a prohibition</b> for the owners to consume it, even after the blood has been sprinkled. <b>But why</b> is there such a prohibition? <b>Isn’t</b> this meat <b>the property of the owners</b> after the blood has been sprinkled, and it is permitted for them in consumption?

### Part 18
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> in explanation: This is referring to meat <b>that</b> was <b>taken out</b> from the place where it is permitted to be eaten before the sprinkling of the blood, and the blood was later sprinkled. In such a case, the meat is prohibited. <b>And</b> this ruling <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> in the mishna on 6b, who rules that sprinkling is effective in that it exempts the meat of the offerings of the most sacred order from the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse, and renders the meat of offerings of lesser sanctity subject to misuse, even if the meat left the courtyard.

### Part 19
Rabbi Ḥanina continues: The <i>tanna</i> here is teaching that <b>when Rabbi Akiva says</b> that <b>sprinkling is effective</b> with regard to the meat of offerings of the most sacred order or the sacrificial portions of offerings of lesser sanctity <b>that left</b> the courtyard, with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse, <i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, and the prohibition against consumption of sacrificial meat while ritually impure, that applies <b>specifically with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of its <b>burning,</b> that it is not burned right away, but that one must wait until the following morning to burn it.
