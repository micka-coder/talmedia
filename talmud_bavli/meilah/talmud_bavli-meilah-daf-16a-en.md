### Part 1
The mishna <b>taught</b> that all carcasses join together, which indicates that carcasses of non-kosher animals join together with carcasses of kosher animals, <b>only with regard to ritual impurity. But with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>eating</b> animal carcasses, <b>kosher</b> animal carcasses are <b>distinct,</b> i.e., they join together only with other kosher animals, <b>and non-kosher</b> animal carcasses are likewise <b>distinct. And Levi says: Even with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>eating</b> animal carcasses, kosher and non-kosher carcasses <b>join together.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And Rav Asi says: Kosher</b> animal carcasses are <b>distinct, and non-kosher</b> animal carcasses are <b>distinct.</b> Since Rav Asi did not specify whether he is referring only to eating or also to ritual impurity, <b>there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rav Asi <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav,</b> i.e., he interprets the mishna as referring to all carcasses of a similar kind, that is, from kosher animals on the one hand, and from non-kosher animals on the other hand. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rav Asi <b>does not disagree</b> with the opinion of Rav, and concedes that kosher and non-kosher animal carcasses join together with regard to ritual impurity.

### Part 3
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against the first explanation of the opinion of Rav Asi from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to half an olive-bulk from the carcass of <b>a dead cow and</b> half an olive-bulk from the flesh of <b>a live camel,</b> they <b>do not join together with one another.</b> It can be inferred from here that if <b>both of them</b> are <b>dead, they</b> do <b>join together.</b> Rav can explain this <i>baraita</i> as referring to ritual impurity, <b>but</b> this poses <b>a difficulty to Rav Asi.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: One should <b>say</b> that the correct inference from the <i>baraita</i> is not that if both of them, the cow and the camel, are dead, then they join together. Rather, one should infer that if <b>both of them</b> are <b>alive, they join together. And who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>? It <b>is Rabbi Yehuda, who said:</b> The prohibition of eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal <b>applies</b> even <b>to</b> the limb of <b>a non-kosher</b> animal.

### Part 5
The Gemara raises a difficulty with this answer. <b>But</b> in that case, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if <b>both of them,</b> the cow and the camel, <b>are dead?</b> Do they <b>not join together? If so, why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> <b>run specifically</b> to an extreme case <b>and teach:</b> Half an olive-bulk from the carcass of <b>a dead cow and</b> half an olive-bulk from the flesh of <b>a live camel?</b> After all, <b>even</b> if <b>both of them</b> are <b>dead, they</b> do <b>not join together.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And furthermore, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Half an olive-bulk</b> from the flesh of <b>a cow when it is alive and half an olive-bulk</b> from the carcass of <b>a camel when it is dead do not join together; but half an olive-bulk from a cow and half an olive-bulk from a camel, whether alive or dead, do join together. The first clause</b> in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>difficult</b> as it is apparently contradicted <b>by the latter clause. Rather, isnâ€™t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that if there is half an olive-bulk from each of <b>the two of them</b> when they are <b>dead,</b> they <b>join together?</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Asi</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>this <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> even where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists. He maintains that the prohibition of eating an animal carcass takes effect even with regard to the flesh of a non-kosher animal, which is already prohibited, and for this reason the two half olive-bulks join together, as the same prohibition against eating an animal carcass applies to both. By contrast, Rav Asi himself maintains that a prohibition does not take effect where another prohibition already exists, and therefore this <i>baraita</i> does not pose a difficulty to his opinion that the two do not combine.
