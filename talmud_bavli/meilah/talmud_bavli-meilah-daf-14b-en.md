### Part 1
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:5): With regard to the <b>incense left over</b> from the previous year, which could no longer be used, <b>what would they do with it</b> in order to render it usable again? The Temple treasurers <b>would set aside</b> an amount <b>of it</b> equal to the value of the <b>wages of the artisans</b> who worked in the Temple.

### Part 2
<b>And they would</b> then <b>desacralize</b> that incense by transferring its sanctity <b>to</b> non-sacred <b>money</b> in the amount owed to <b>the artisans. And they</b> would subsequently <b>give</b> the incense <b>to the artisans</b> as their wages. <b>And</b> finally, <b>they would return and buy</b> back the incense from the artisans with funds <b>from the new collection</b> of shekels, so that the incense would now be considered to have been acquired from the shekels of the current year.

### Part 3
The Gemara explains its objection: <b>But why</b> was this procedure necessary according to Shmuel, who maintains that one builds the structures in the Temple with non-sacred materials? <b>Let them desacralize</b> the leftover incense by transferring its sanctity <b>to</b> the completed, non-sacred <b>structure,</b> thereby consecrating it with the sanctity of the incense. After the leftover incense is desacralized, it can be given to the artisans as wages and the Temple treasurers can buy it back with funds from the new collection.

### Part 4
The Gemara explains: The mishna is referring to a situation <b>where</b> there is currently no ongoing construction in the Temple, and therefore <b>there is no structure</b> to which they can transfer the sanctity of the leftover incense. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> The <b>wages of the artisans,</b> which indicates that construction is taking place in the Temple. The Gemara responds: Although there is indeed ongoing construction, the mishna in <i>Shekalim</i> is referring to a case <b>where there is no construction equaling the amount of</b> the <b>value</b> of the leftover incense. Therefore, it is not possible to transfer the sanctity of the leftover incense to the construction.

### Part 5
The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>But doesnâ€™t Shmuel say</b> with regard to <b>consecrated</b> property <b>worth one hundred</b> dinars <b>that</b> if the Temple treasurer <b>redeemed it for</b> an object <b>worth</b> only <b>one <i>peruta</i>,</b> it is <b>redeemed,</b> despite the fact that the redemption was performed with an item that was not worth the full value of the consecrated property? The Gemara answers: <b>This statement</b> of Shmuel applies to a case <b>where one did</b> so, i.e., it applies only after the fact, but the Temple treasurer should <b>not</b> act in this manner <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Pappa said: This is</b> the <b>reason that one builds</b> the structures in the Temple <b>with non-sacred</b> materials and afterward consecrates those materials upon completion: It is because the <b>Torah was not given to the ministering angels,</b> who do not tire and do not have physical needs, but rather to human beings. Therefore, the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>perhaps</b> an artisan will <b>want to</b> rest and <b>sit</b> on the stones being used in the construction, <b>and</b> he might in fact <b>sit on them.</b> And <b>if he builds with consecrated</b> materials, it will <b>be found that he misused consecrated</b> property. Consequently, it is preferable for one to build with non-sacred materials, and the structure should be consecrated only upon completion.

### Part 7
The Gemara raises an objection to this reasoning from that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: In the case of <b>the</b> Temple <b>treasurers who purchased</b> non-sacred <b>logs</b> to use for repairs in the Temple, one is liable for <b>misusing</b> the wood itself, <b>but</b> he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> the <b>sawdust, nor</b> is he liable <b>for</b> misusing the <b>leaves</b> that fall from the log.

### Part 8
<b>But why</b> should this be a situation where one could be liable <b>for misusing</b> the wood? <b>Here too, let him work with non-sacred</b> logs and consecrate them only after they have been fixed in the structure. After all, in this case too one can apply the above reasoning that the Sages <b>said that perhaps</b> he will <b>want to</b> rest and <b>sit</b> on the logs he is working with, <b>and</b> he might <b>sit on them, and</b> it will <b>be found that he misused consecrated</b> items.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>if</b> the mishna were referring <b>to logs</b> that the Temple treasurers acquired for use in construction <b>from this</b> point <b>forward,</b> then <b>indeed</b> they should not be consecrated until they are fixed in the structure. <b>But when we learned in the mishna</b> that one is liable for misuse of the wood, the <i>tanna</i> was referring <b>to logs</b> acquired for use <b>on that</b> same <b>day.</b> Since they are meant to be used immediately, there is no concern that one might sit on them.
