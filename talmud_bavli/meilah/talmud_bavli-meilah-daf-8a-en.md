<b>But</b> as for permitting it <b>for eating,</b> in this regard even Rabbi Akiva concedes <b>that</b> the sprinkling of the blood <b>does not effect acceptance.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One</b> who derives benefit <b>from a bird sin offering is</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>from</b> the moment <b>that it was consecrated.</b> Once the nape of its neck <b>was pinched, it was rendered susceptible to disqualification</b> for sacrifice <b>through</b> contact with <b>one</b> who was ritually impure <b>who immersed</b> in a ritual bath <b>that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed, <b>and through</b> contact with <b>one who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering to complete his purification process, e.g., a <i>zav</i> and a leper, who are not yet permitted to partake of sacrificial meat; <b>and through</b> its blood being <b>left overnight,</b> i.e., if its blood was not sprinkled before sunset.

### Part 4
Once <b>its blood was sprinkled, one is liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> and the prohibition of <b><i>notar</i>, and</b> the prohibition of partaking of sacrificial meat while <b>ritually impure. But there is no</b> liability for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, because after the blood is sprinkled it is permitted for priests to partake of its meat and it is no longer consecrated exclusively to God.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna <b>teaches:</b> From the time the nape of its neck was pinched, the bird sin offering <b>was rendered susceptible to disqualification</b> for sacrifice <b>through</b> contact with <b>one who immersed that day, and through</b> contact with <b>one who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering, <b>and through</b> its blood being <b>left overnight.</b> It can be inferred from here that <b>yes,</b> it is susceptible <b>to disqualification, but</b> it is <b>not</b> fit <b>to</b> render other items ritually <b>impure.</b>

### Part 6
In light of the above inference, the Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna?</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Teharot</i> 1:4) that <b>Abba Shaul says:</b> With regard to <b>one who immersed that day,</b>
