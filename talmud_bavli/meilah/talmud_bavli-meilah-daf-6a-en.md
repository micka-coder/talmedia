### Part 1
The Gemara cites another source that might resolve the issue: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i> that can provide a proof with regard to the meaning of Rabbi Yehoshua’s statement about a period of fitness to the priests: <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that <b>there is</b> a case of <b><i>notar</i>,</b> when the blood was left overnight and was rendered unfit, <b>where</b> one is liable for <b>misusing</b> the meat of the offering, <b>and there is</b> also a case of <b><i>notar</i> where</b> one is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing it.</b>

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>How so?</b> If the blood was <b>left over</b> and someone consumed the meat <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, he is liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property. But if it was consumed <b>after</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property, as the sprinkling removes the meat from being subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse.

### Part 3
The Gemara notes: <b>In any event,</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>teaches</b> that if one consumes the meat before the leftover blood was sprinkled, he is liable for <b>misusing it.</b> Is this <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where there was time</b> left in the day <b>to sprinkle</b> the blood that had already been collected in the service vessel, and therefore, <b>if he had desired, he could have sprinkled</b> the blood? Nevertheless, the offering is subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse. This indicates that merely collecting the blood in the service vessel alone, without actually sprinkling it, does not remove the offering from being subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse.

### Part 4
<b>And</b> accordingly, one may <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that it is <b>fitness</b> of <b>consuming</b> the meat of the offering that <b>we learned</b> in Rabbi Yehoshua’s statement in the mishna. It is the fitness of consuming the meat of the offering that removes the possibility of being liable for the prohibition of misuse, not the fitness of sprinkling.

### Part 5
The Gemara refutes this conclusion: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is not referring to a case where there was time left in the day to sprinkle the blood that had already been collected. Rather, it is referring to a situation <b>where</b> the priest <b>collected</b> the blood <b>shortly before sunset, where there was no time</b> left in the day <b>to sprinkle</b> the blood while it was still daytime. Since the blood could not have been sprinkled, the offering is still subject to the prohibition of misuse. But if there had been time to sprinkle the blood, then that blood would be considered ready to be sprinkled, and the offering would no longer be subject to the prohibition of misuse, in accordance with the opinion that the criteria is the fitness of sprinkling of the blood.

### Part 6
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> in that case, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in a situation where there <b>was time</b> in the day to sprinkle the blood? According to the above claim, <b>so too</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> the offering.

### Part 7
If so, <b>why does</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>specifically teach</b> this distinction between a case <b>before sprinkling,</b> when the offering is still subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse, and after sprinkling, when the offering is no longer subject to misuse? <b>Let</b> Rabbi Shimon instead <b>teach</b> a more precise distinction, between a situation where the blood was collected <b>before sunset</b> and there was time to sprinkle it but it was left overnight, in which case the offering is not subject to the prohibition of misuse, <b>and</b> a situation where the blood was collected <b>after sunset,</b> in which case it is still subject to the prohibition of misuse.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers that this is <b>indeed</b> what Rabbi Shimon meant, as he actually <b>taught: Before</b> it was <b>fit for sprinkling,</b> the offering is still subject to the prohibition of misuse, <b>but after</b> it was <b>fit for sprinkling,</b> it is no longer subject to the prohibition of misuse.

### Part 9
The Gemara suggests another proof from a similar <i>baraita</i>. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: Rabbi Shimon says</b> that <b>there is</b> a case of <b>an offering</b> of the most sacred order that was sacrificed with <b><i>piggul</i></b> intent <b>where</b> one is liable for <b>misusing it, and there is</b> also a case of <b><i>piggul</i></b> intent <b>where</b> one is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing it.</b>

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>How so?</b> If someone consumed the meat <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, he is liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property. If he consumed it <b>after</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property, as the sprinkling removed the prohibition of misuse.

### Part 11
<b>In any event,</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>teaches</b> that if one consumes the meat of an offering that was rendered <i>piggul</i> <b>before</b> the blood was <b>sprinkled,</b> he is liable for <b>misusing it.</b> Is this <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where there was time</b> left in the day <b>to sprinkle</b> the blood that had already been collected in the service vessel, and therefore, <b>if he had desired, he could have sprinkled</b> the blood? <b>And</b> yet Rabbi Shimon <b>teaches</b> that one is liable for <b>misusing it.</b> Once again, this would indicate that merely collecting the blood in the service vessel alone, without sprinkling, does not remove the possibility of the prohibition of misuse. <b>And</b> accordingly, one may <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that it is <b>fitness</b> of <b>consuming</b> the meat of the offering that <b>we learned</b> in Rabbi Yehoshua’s statement in the mishna.

### Part 12
The Gemara refutes this conclusion: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a situation where the priest collected the blood shortly before sunset, <b>where there was no time to sprinkle</b> the blood while it was still daytime. Since the blood could not have been sprinkled, the offering is still subject to the prohibition of misuse. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in a case where there <b>was time</b> in the day <b>to sprinkle</b> the blood? According to the above claim, the offering is <b>indeed removed</b> from being subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse.</b>

### Part 13
If so, <b>why does</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>specifically teach</b> this distinction between <b>after sprinkling,</b> when the offering is no longer subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse, and before sprinkling, when the offering is still subject to misuse? <b>Let</b> Rabbi Shimon instead <b>teach</b> a more precise distinction, between a situation where the blood was collected <b>before sunset</b> and there was time to sprinkle it but it was left overnight, in which case the offering is not subject to the prohibition of misuse, <b>and</b> a situation where the blood was collected <b>after sunset,</b> in which case it is still subject to the prohibition of misuse.

### Part 14
The Gemara answers that <b>that is indeed what</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>is saying: Before</b> it was <b>fit for sprinkling,</b> the offering is still subject to the prohibition of misuse, <b>but after</b> it was <b>fit for sprinkling,</b> it is no longer subject to the prohibition of misuse.

### Part 15
§ The Gemara suggests another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: An offering of the most sacred order</b> which is <b><i>piggul</i></b> is subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse.</b> The Gemara analyzes this statement: <b>What, is</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the priest already <b>sprinkled</b> its blood? This would indicate that a fit offering, unlike a <i>piggul</i> offering, is no longer subject to the prohibition of misuse only once the blood is sprinkled. <b>And</b> if so, one may <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that it is <b>fitness</b> of <b>consuming</b> the meat of the offering that <b>we learned</b> in Rabbi Yehoshua’s statement in the mishna, i.e., this fitness of consuming the meat of the offering removes the prohibition of misuse. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> one cannot cite a proof from this <i>baraita</i>, as it is possible that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the priest did <b>not</b> yet <b>sprinkle</b> the blood.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what,</b> then, is the <i>halakha</i> in a case where the priest did <b>sprinkle</b> the blood? Is the <i>halakha</i> <b>indeed that</b> one is <b>no</b> longer liable for <b>misusing it?</b> If so, <b>why does</b> the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> <b>specifically teach:</b> Unlike an offering of the most sacred order, <b>in</b> the case of the sacrificial portions of <b>an offering of lesser sanctity</b> one is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing it?</b>

### Part 17
<b>Let</b> the <i>baraita</i> instead <b>teach</b> a distinction within the category of offerings of the most sacred order themselves: <b>Here,</b> the offering is subject to the prohibition of misuse because it is <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, and <b>there,</b> the offering is not subject to the prohibition of misuse because it is <b>after</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood.

### Part 18
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> could have taught that distinction, but it chose to state a distinction between offerings of the most sacred order and offerings of lesser sanctity because it <b>comes to teach us this</b> following principle: In <b>any</b> case where the result of sprinkling <b>brings</b> the offering <b>into</b> the category of the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse,</b> e.g., the sacrificial portions of offerings of lesser sanctity, to which the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse apply only after the blood had been sprinkled, only <b>sprinkling</b> the blood <b>properly brings</b> the offering <b>into</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse.</b>

### Part 19
By contrast, in <b>any</b> situation where the result of sprinkling is <b>removing</b> the offering <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse,</b> e.g., the meat of an offering of the most sacred order, which was subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse even before the blood was sprinkled, <b>even sprinkling</b> the blood <b>improperly removes</b> the offering <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse.</b> This ruling is not in accordance with the opinion of Rav Giddel.
