### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting [<i>orla</i>]</b> (see Leviticus 19:23), <b>and diverse kinds,</b>i.e., grain sown <b>in a vineyard</b> (see Deuteronomy 22:9) <b>join together</b> to constitute the requisite measure to prohibit a mixture that they are mixed into. This applies when the volume of the permitted produce is less than two hundred times the prohibited produce. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: They do not join together.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Shimon, do</b> the two half-measures <b>need to join</b> together, in order for one who eats them to be liable? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> One who eats <b>any measure</b> of a prohibited food is liable <b>to</b> receive <b>lashes,</b> as the Sages stated the measure of an olive-bulk only with regard to the requirement to bring an offering? The Gemara answers: The wording of the mishna is not precise and must be emended, to <b>teach</b> that Rabbi Shimon says: <b>They do not need to join together,</b> as one is flogged even for less than the minimum measure.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A garment must be at least three by three handbreadths in order to become a primary source of ritual impurity, by means of ritual impurity imparted by the treading of a <i>zav</i>. A sack made from goats’ hair must be at least four by four handbreadths, while an animal hide must be five by five, and a mat six by six. <b>The garment and the sack, the sack and the hide,</b> and <b>the hide and the mat all join together</b> to constitute the requisite measure to become ritually impure in accordance with the material of the greater measure.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Shimon said: What is the reason</b> that they join together, despite the fact that their requisite measures are not equal? <b>Because</b> all the component materials <b>are fit to become ritually impure</b> through the ritual impurity imparted <b>to a seat</b> upon which a <i>zav</i> sits, as they can each be used to patch a saddle or saddlecloth. Since the measure of all these materials is equal in the case of a <i>zav</i>, they join together for other forms of ritual impurity as well.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where one <b>cut from each of</b> the materials listed in the mishna, i.e., the garment, the sack, the hide, and the mat, a piece of less than <b>three</b> by three handbreadths, <b>and</b> sewed them together, thereby <b>fashioning a garment from them;</b> if he formed the garment <b>for lying</b> upon it, then the minimum measure for it to become a primary source of ritual impurity is <b>three</b> handbreadths. If he intended it <b>for sitting,</b> the minimum measure is one <b>handbreadth.</b> If he intended to use it <b>for holding,</b> it becomes impure in <b>any measure.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the reason for the <i>halakha</i> in the case where one intended to use it <b>for holding?</b> Why is this cloth classified as a garment? <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> It is considered a garment <b>because it stands</b> to be used as protection for the hands <b>when weaving [<i>lenavla</i>],</b> so that the weaver does not cut his fingers when straightening the threads. It <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> It is considered a garment <b>since it is suited for fig cutters</b> to place the material on their hands, to prevent them from getting dirty.
