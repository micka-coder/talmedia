### Part 1
<b>to include a mature minor?</b> Explain the <i>baraita</i> as follows: A minor who grew two hairs is included in a <i>zimmun</i>, and we are not exacting with regard to a minor to ascertain whether or not he has reached the age of majority.

### Part 2
The Gemara concludes: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with all of these statements. Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with this</b> statement <b>that Rav Naḥman said: A minor who knows to Whom one recites a blessing is included in a <i>zimmun</i>.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara relates that <b>Abaye and Rava,</b> when they were children, <b>were seated before Rabba. Rabba said to them: To whom does one recite blessings? They said to him: To</b> God, <b>the All-Merciful.</b> Rabba asked them: <b>And where does the All-Merciful reside? Rava pointed to the ceiling. Abaye went outside and pointed toward the heaven. Rabba said to them: You will both become Sages. It is as the popular saying goes: A cucumber can be recognized from its blossoming</b> stage. Similarly, a great person can be recognized even from a young age.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, said in the name of Rav:</b> If <b>nine ate grain and one ate vegetables, they join</b> and form a <i>zimmun</i> of ten. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: I raised a dilemma before Rav Yehuda: What is</b> the ruling if <b>eight</b> ate grain and two ate vegetables? May they join together? <b>What is</b> the ruling if <b>seven</b> ate grain? <b>He said to me: There is no difference. I certainly had no dilemma with regard to six,</b> as it was clear to me that six are insufficient to warrant a <i>zimmun</i>. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to him: You did well that you had no dilemma</b> with regard to six, but for the opposite reason. <b>There,</b> in the case of seven or eight, <b>what is the reason</b> that they form a <i>zimmun</i> of ten? <b>Because there is a majority</b> of those dining who ate grain. <b>Here, too, there is a majority.</b> Rabbi Zeira, however, <b>held: We require an obvious majority.</b> Therefore, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yirmeya, it was clear to him that six who ate grain are insufficient to form a <i>zimmun</i>.

### Part 5
The Gemara relates: <b>King Yannai and the queen ate bread together. And since</b> Yannai <b>executed the Sages, there was no one to recite the</b> Grace after Meals <b>blessing on their behalf. He said to his wife: Who will provide us</b> with <b>a man to recite the blessing on our behalf? She said to him: Swear to me that if I bring you</b> such <b>a man, you will not harass him. He swore,</b> and <b>she brought her brother, Shimon ben Shataḥ. She sat him between</b> the King’s throne <b>and hers.</b> The King <b>said to him: Do you see how much honor I am according you? He responded:</b> It is <b>not you who honors me; rather, the Torah honors me, as it is written: “Extol her and she will exalt you; she will bring you to honor when you embrace her”</b> (Proverbs 4:8). Yannai <b>said to</b> his wife: <b>You see that he does not accept authority.</b>

### Part 6
<b>They gave</b> Shimon ben Shataḥ <b>a cup</b> of wine <b>over which to recite</b> Grace after Meals. <b>He said: How shall I recite the blessing?</b> Shall I say: <b>Blessed is He from Whom Yannai and his companions have eaten?</b> I have not eaten anything. <b>He drank that cup</b> of wine. <b>They gave him another cup, and he recited the</b> Grace after Meals <b>blessing.</b> By drinking the first cup he joined the other diners and was therefore eligible to recite Grace after Meals on their behalf.

### Part 7
With regard to this story, <b>Rabbi Abba, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, said</b> (that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said): That which Shimon ben Shataḥ did,</b> reciting Grace after Meals on their behalf, <b>he did on his own,</b> and not in accordance with the accepted <i>halakha</i>, <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: One</b> who recites Grace after Meals <b>cannot fulfill the obligation of others</b> to recite it <b>until he eats an olive-bulk of grain.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: One who entered and reclined together</b> with those who were dining, <b>even if he only dipped with them</b> a small bit of food <b>in</b> spicy <b>brine</b> that was before them <b>and ate with them only a single dry fig, he joins them.</b> This <i>baraita</i> demonstrates that one need not necessarily eat grain to recite Grace after Meals on their behalf.

### Part 9
The Gemara responds: Indeed, <b>he joins them, but</b> he cannot <b>satisfy the obligation of the many unless he has eaten an olive-bulk of grain.</b>

### Part 10
Similarly, this <i>halakha</i> <b>was also stated: Rav Ḥana bar Yehuda said in the name of Rava: Even if he only</b>
