### Part 1
<b>as it is stated:</b> “And Oved-edom had <b>sons…Peulletai the eighth,” and</b> in the continuation of the same verse <b>it is written: “For God blessed him”</b> (I Chronicles 26:4–5); apparently, these eight children were the blessing, as it is stated: <b>“All these were of the sons of Oved-edom; they and their sons and their brethren, able men in strength for the service; sixty-two of Oved-edom”</b> (I Chronicles 26:8). Each of the nine women gave birth to six sons, for a total of fifty-four. If one adds the original eight, there were sixty-two altogether.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Avin HaLevi said: If one forces the moment</b> and attempts to take advantage of an undeserved opportunity, the <b>moment forces him</b> and he is pushed aside. <b>If one yields to the moment</b> and relinquishes an opportunity that presents itself, the <b>moment yields to him.</b>

### Part 3
This may be derived <b>from</b> an incident involving <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef, as Rav Yosef</b> was <b>Sinai,</b> extremely erudite, <b>and Rabba</b> was <b>one who uproots mountains,</b> extremely sharp. <b>The moment arrived when they were needed;</b> one of them was to be chosen as head of the yeshiva. <b>They sent</b> the following question <b>there,</b> to the Sages of Eretz Yisrael: <b>Which takes precedence, Sinai or one who uproots mountains? They sent to them</b> in response: <b>Sinai takes precedence,</b> for <b>everyone needs the owner of the wheat,</b> one who is expert in the sources. <b>Nevertheless, Rav Yosef did not accept</b> the appointment, <b>as the Chaldean</b> astrologers <b>told him: You will preside</b> as head of the yeshiva for <b>two years.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rabba presided</b> as head of the yeshiva for <b>twenty-two years.</b> After he died, <b>Rav Yosef presided</b> for <b>two and a half years.</b> Though he did not take advantage of the opportunity that presented itself, he ultimately fulfilled that for which he was destined.

### Part 5
The Gemara relates that <b>all those years that Rabba presided,</b> Rav Yosef <b>did not even call a bloodletter to his home.</b> Rav Yosef did not assume even the slightest air of authority, and would go to seek out the bloodletter rather than call upon the bloodletter to accommodate him.

### Part 6
<b>And Rabbi Avin HaLevi said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “The Lord will answer you on the day of distress; the name of the God of Jacob set you upon high”</b> (Psalms 20:2)? Is God specifically <b>the God of Jacob and not the God of Abraham and Isaac?</b> Rather, <b>from here</b> the general principle is derived: <b>One who owns a beam should approach</b> carrying <b>the thick portion of the beam.</b> A builder, carrying a beam in order to affix it in a building, must calibrate it and measure carefully so that the thick part of the beam fits in its place; so too must Jacob, who fathered and raised the children who would become the people of Israel, continue to pray for them and complete the task of nation-building.

### Part 7
<b>And Rabbi Avin HaLevi said: One who partakes of a meal at which a Torah scholar is present, it is as if he enjoyed the radiant splendor of the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “And Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God”</b> (Exodus 18:12). <b>Did they</b> actually <b>eat before God? Didn’t they eat before Moses?</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rather,</b> this verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>one who partakes in a meal at which a Torah scholar is present, it is as if he enjoyed the radiant splendor of the Divine Presence.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And Rabbi Avin HaLevi said: One who takes leave from another should not say to him: Go in peace, but rather,</b> he should say: <b>Go to peace. As we see</b> that, on the one hand, <b>Jethro said to Moses: “Go to peace”</b> (Exodus 4:18), and <b>Moses ascended and was successful.</b> On the other hand, <b>David said to</b> his son, <b>Absalom: “Go in peace”</b> (II Samuel 15:9), and Absalom <b>went and was</b> ultimately <b>hanged.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Avin HaLevi also said: One who takes leave from a dead person should not say to him: Go to peace, but rather,</b> one should say: <b>Go in peace, as it is stated: “But you shall go to your fathers in peace”</b> (Genesis 15:15).

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Levi bar Ḥiyya said: One who leaves the synagogue and</b> immediately <b>enters the study hall and engages in Torah</b> study, <b>is privileged to receive the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “They go from strength to strength, every one of them appears before God in Zion”</b> (Psalms 84:8); those who go from a place of prayer to a place of Torah study are privileged to receive a divine revelation in Zion.

### Part 12
With regard to that same verse, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said: Torah scholars have rest neither in this world nor in the World-to-Come,</b> as in both worlds they are constantly progressing, <b>as it is stated: “They go from strength to strength, every one of them appears before God in Zion.”</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Torah scholars increase peace in the world, as it is said: “And all your children [<i>banayikh</i>] shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children”</b> (Isaiah 54:13). If all the children of Israel are taught of the Lord, there will be peace for all.

### Part 14
The Sages interpreted this verse homiletically: <b>Do not read your children [<i>banayikh</i>], but your builders [<i>bonayikh</i>].</b> Torah scholars are those who build peace for their generation. As it is stated: <b>“Those who love Your Torah have great peace; there is no stumbling block for them”</b> (Psalms 119:165); and <b>“May there be peace within your walls, prosperity within your palaces”</b> (Psalms 122:7), because: <b>“For the sake of my brothers and friends, I shall say: Peace be within you. For the sake of the House of the Lord, our God, I will seek your good”</b> (Psalms 122:8–9), and <b>“May the Lord give strength to His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace”</b> (Psalms 29:11).
