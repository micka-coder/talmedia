### Part 1
<b>but he does become impure for a <i>met mitzva</i>.</b> Here too, the question is asked: <b>Let us say</b> that the obligation to bury a <i>met mitzva</i>, which is predicated on the preservation of human dignity, should not override mitzvot explicitly written in the Torah, as it is stated: <b>“There is neither wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel against the Lord.”</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as it is</b> explicitly <b>written: “And his sister,”</b> from which we derive that although he may not become ritually impure to bury his sister, he must do so for a <i>met mitzva</i>.

### Part 3
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us derive</b> a general principle that human dignity takes precedence over all mitzvot in the Torah <b>from this</b> case. This possibility is rejected: This is a special case, because a case of <b>“sit and refrain from action”</b> [<b><i>shev ve’al ta’aseh</i>] is different.</b> Engaging in the burial of a <i>met mitzva</i> is not actually in contravention of a mitzva. Rather, by doing so he becomes ritually impure and is then rendered incapable of fulfilling that mitzva. We cannot derive a general principle from here that human dignity would also override a Torah prohibition in a case where that prohibition is directly contravened.

### Part 4
The Gemara responds: In the context of the discussion whether or not human dignity overrides honoring God in the sense of fulfilling his mitzvot, <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: What is different about the earlier</b> generations, <b>for whom miracles occurred and what is different about us, for whom miracles do not occur? If it is because of</b> Torah <b>study; in the years of Rav Yehuda all of their learning was</b> confined to <b>the</b> order of <b><i>Nezikin</i>, while we learn</b> all <b>six orders!</b> Moreover, <b>when Rav Yehuda would reach in</b> tractate <b><i>Okatzin</i>,</b> which discusses the extent to which the stems of various fruits and vegetables are considered an integral part of the produce in terms of becoming ritually impure, the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a woman who pickles a vegetable in a pot, and some say</b> when he would reach the <i>halakha</i> that <b>olives pickled with their leaves are pure,</b> because after pickling, it is no longer possible to lift the fruit by its leaves, they are no longer considered part of the fruit; he would find it difficult to understand. He <b>would say:</b> Those are <b>the disputes between Rav and Shmuel that we see here. And we,</b> in contrast, <b>learn thirteen versions of <i>Okatzin</i>. While,</b> with regard to miracles, after declaring a fast to pray for a drought to end, <b>when Rav Yehuda would remove one of his shoes the rain would</b> immediately <b>fall, whereas we torment ourselves and cry out and no one notices us.</b>

### Part 5
Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: <b>The previous</b> generations were wholly <b>dedicated</b> to <b>the sanctification of God’s name,</b> while <b>we are not</b> as <b>dedicated to the sanctification of God’s name.</b> Typical of the earlier generations’ commitment, the Gemara relates: <b>Like this</b> incident involving <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> who <b>saw a non-Jewish woman who was wearing a garment made of a forbidden mixture of wool and linen [<i>karbalta</i>] in the marketplace.</b> Since he <b>thought</b> that <b>she was Jewish, he stood and ripped it from her. It was</b> then <b>divulged that she was a non-Jew</b> and he was taken to court due to the shame that he caused her, and <b>they assessed</b> the payment for the shame that he caused <b>her</b> at <b>four hundred <i>zuz</i>.</b> Ultimately, Rav Adda <b>said to her: What is your name? She replied: Matun.</b> In a play on words, <b>he said to her: Matun,</b> her name, plus <b><i>matun</i>,</b> the Aramaic word for two hundred, <b>is worth four hundred <i>zuz</i>.</b>

### Part 6
It was also related about the earlier generations, that they would degrade themselves in the desire to glorify God. <b>Rav Giddel was accustomed to go and sit</b> at <b>the gates of the</b> women’s <b>immersion</b> sites. <b>He said to them: Immerse yourselves in this way, and immerse yourselves in that way. The Sages said to him: Master,</b> do you <b>not fear the evil inclination? He said to them: In my eyes,</b> they <b>are comparable to white geese.</b>

### Part 7
Similarly, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan was accustomed to go and sit</b> at <b>the gates of the</b> women’s <b>immersion</b> sites. Rabbi Yoḥanan, who was known for his extraordinary good looks, explained this and <b>said: When the daughters of Israel emerge from their immersion, they will look at me, and will have children as beautiful as I. The Sages asked him: Master,</b> do you <b>not fear the evil eye? He said to them: I descend from the seed of Joseph over whom the evil eye has no dominion, as it is written: “Joseph is a bountiful vine, a bountiful vine on a spring [<i>alei ayin</i>]”</b> (Genesis 49:22). “<i>Ayin</i>” can mean both “spring” and “eye.” <b>And Rabbi Abbahu said</b> a homiletic interpretation: <b>Do not read</b> it <b><i>alei ayin</i>, rather <i>olei ayin</i>,</b> above the eye; they transcend the influence of the evil eye.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> cited a different proof, from Jacob’s blessing of Joseph’s sons, Ephraim and Menashe: “The angel who redeems me from all evil shall bless the young and in them may my name be recalled, and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, <b>and may they multiply</b> [<b><i>veyidgu</i>] in the midst of the earth”</b> (Genesis 48:16). <i>Veyidgu</i> is related etymologically to the word fish [<i>dag</i>]. <b>Just as the fish in the sea, water covers them and the evil eye has no dominion over them,</b> so <b>too the seed of Joseph, the evil eye has no dominion over them.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: Joseph’s <b>eye, which did not seek to feast on that which was not his,</b> Potiphar’s wife, <b>the evil eye has no dominion over him.</b>

### Part 10
MISHNA <b>Women, slaves, and minors,</b> who have parallel obligations in various mitzvot, <b>are exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i></b>
