### Part 1
<b>However,</b> in a situation <b>where, when you take the fruit, the branch does not remain and again produce</b> fruit, <b>we do not recite the blessing: Who creates fruit of the tree, but rather: Who creates fruit of the ground.</b>

### Part 2
We learned in the mishna: <b>And on all</b> food items, <b>if he recited:</b> By whose word <b>all things</b> came to be, he fulfilled his obligation. <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disputed the precise explanation of the mishna. <b>Rav Huna said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies to all foods <b>except for bread and wine.</b> Since they have special blessings, one does not fulfill his obligation by reciting the general blessing: By whose word all things came to be. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> One fulfills his obligation with the blessing: By whose word all things came to be, <b>even</b> over <b>bread and wine.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara remarks: <b>Let us say</b> that this dispute is <b>parallel to a tannaitic</b> dispute found elsewhere, as it was taught in a <i>Tosefta</i>: One who <b>saw bread and said: How pleasant is this bread, blessed is the Omnipresent Who created it, fulfilled</b> his obligation to recite a blessing. <b>One who saw a fig and said: How pleasant is this fig, blessed is the Omnipresent Who created it, fulfilled</b> his obligation. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says: One who deviates from the formula coined by the Sages in blessings, did not fulfill his obligation.</b> If so, <b>let us say</b> that <b>Rav Huna,</b> who <b>said</b> that one who recites: By whose word all things came to be, over bread or wine, did not fulfill his obligation, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei; and Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who <b>said</b> that one who recites: By whose word all things came to be, over bread or wine fulfills his obligation, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Rav Huna</b> could have <b>said to you: I said</b> my statement, <b>even</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> as <b>Rabbi Meir only stated</b> his opinion, that one who alters the formula of the blessing fulfills his obligation, <b>there, where</b> the individual explicitly <b>mentions the term bread</b> in his blessing, <b>but where he does not mention</b> the <b>term bread, even Rabbi Meir agrees</b> that he did not fulfill his obligation.

### Part 5
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said to you: I said</b> my statement, <b>even</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> as <b>Rabbi Yosei only stated</b> his opinion, that one who alters the formula of the blessing does not fulfill his obligation, <b>there, because he recited a blessing that was not instituted by the Sages; however,</b> if <b>he recited: By whose word all things came to be, which was instituted by the Sages, even Rabbi Yosei agrees</b> that, after the fact, he fulfilled his obligation to recite a blessing.

### Part 6
Regarding blessings that do not conform to the formula instituted by the Sages, the Gemara relates that <b>Binyamin the shepherd ate bread and</b> afterward <b>recited</b> in Aramaic: <b>Blessed is the Master of this bread. Rav said,</b> he thereby <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation to recite a blessing. The Gemara objects: <b>But didn’t Rav</b> himself <b>say: Any blessing that does not contain mention of God’s name is not</b> considered a <b>blessing?</b> The Gemara emends the formula of his blessing. <b>He said: Blessed is the All-Merciful, Master of this bread.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But don’t we require three blessings</b> in Grace after Meals? How did he fulfill his obligation with one sentence? The Gemara explains: <b>What is: Fulfills his obligation, that Rav also said? He fulfills</b> the obligation <b>of the first</b> of the three <b>blessings,</b> and must recite two more to fulfill his obligation completely.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>What is he teaching us?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Although he recited</b> the blessing <b>in a secular language,</b> other than Hebrew, he fulfilled his obligation.

### Part 9
This remains difficult, as <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> this in a mishna in <i>Sota</i>: <b>And these are recited in any language</b> that one understands: <b>The portion of</b> the swearing of the <b><i>sota</i>,</b> the <b>confession</b> of the <b>tithes</b> when a homeowner declares that he has given all <i>teruma</i> and tithes appropriately, <b>the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, and</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer and Grace after Meals.</b> If Grace after Meals is clearly on the list of matters that may be recited in any language, what did Rav teach us? The Gemara answers: Rav’s ruling with regard to Binyamin the Shepherd <b>is necessary, as it might have entered your mind to say: This,</b> the permission to recite Grace after Meals in any language, <b>applies only</b> to a case where one <b>recited it in a secular language, just as it was instituted by the Sages in the holy tongue. However,</b> in a case <b>where</b> one <b>did not recite</b> the blessing <b>in a secular language, just as it was instituted by the Sages in the holy tongue, say</b> that <b>no,</b> he did <b>not</b> fulfill his obligation. Therefore, Rav <b>teaches us</b> that, after the fact, not only is the language not an impediment to fulfillment of his obligation to recite a blessing, the formula is not an impediment either.

### Part 10
The Gemara considers <b>the matter</b> of Rav’s opinion <b>itself</b> and cites the fundamental dispute in that regard. <b>Rav said: Any blessing that does not contain mention of God’s name is not</b> considered a <b>blessing. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Any blessing that does not contain mention of</b> God’s <b>sovereignty is not</b> considered a <b>blessing. Abaye said: It stands to reason in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, as it was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: In the confession of the tithes, one recites, <b>“I did not transgress your mitzvot and I did not forget”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:13). The meaning of phrase, <b>I did not transgress,</b> is that I did not refrain <b>from blessing You</b> when separating tithes; and the meaning of the phrase, <b>and I did not forget,</b> is that I did not forget <b>to mention Your name in</b> the blessing recited <b>over it. However, this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>did not teach</b> that one must mention God’s <b>sovereignty</b> in the blessing.

### Part 11
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> would say: <b>Emend</b> the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And I did not forget to mention Your name and Your sovereignty in</b> the blessing recited <b>over it;</b> indicating that one must mention both God’s name and God’s sovereignty.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And over</b> a food <b>item whose growth is not from the ground, one recites: By whose word all things came to be.</b> And <b>over vinegar,</b> wine that fermented and spoiled, <b>and over <i>novelot</i>,</b> dates that spoiled, <b>and over locusts, one recites: By whose word all things came to be. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Over <b>any</b> food item <b>that is a type</b> resulting from a <b>curse, one does not recite a blessing over it</b> at all. None of the items listed exist under normal conditions, and they come about as the result of a curse.

### Part 13
On a different note: If there were <b>many types</b> of food <b>before him,</b> over which food should he recite a blessing first? <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If there is one of the seven species</b> for which Eretz Yisrael was praised <b>among them, he recites</b> the first <b>blessing over it. And the Rabbis say: He recites a blessing over whichever of them he wants.</b>

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: Over a</b> food <b>item whose growth is not from the earth, for example, meat from domesticated animals, non-domesticated animals, and fowl and fish, one recites: By whose word all things came to be.</b> So too, <b>over milk, and over eggs, and over cheese, one recites:</b> By whose word <b>all things</b> came to be. This is not only true with regard to items that come from animals, but <b>over moldy bread, and over wine that fermented slightly, and over a cooked dish that spoiled, one recites: By whose word all things came to be,</b> because the designated blessing is inappropriate for food that is partially spoiled. Similarly, <b>over salt and over brine, and over truffles and mushrooms, one recites: By whose word all things came to be.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say</b> that <b>truffles and mushrooms are not</b> items <b>that grow from the ground? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who vows</b> not to eat <b>from the fruit of the earth is forbidden</b> to eat all <b>fruit of the earth;</b> however, he <b>is permitted</b> to eat <b>truffles and mushrooms.</b> And <b>if he said: All</b> items <b>that grow from the ground</b> are forbidden <b>to me, he is forbidden</b> to eat <b>even truffles and mushrooms.</b> Apparently, truffles and mushrooms are items that grow from the ground.

### Part 15
<b>Abaye said:</b> With regard <b>to growth, they grow from the earth,</b> but with regard <b>to sustenance, they do not draw sustenance from the earth.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: Why is that distinction significant? <b>Wasn’t it taught: Over</b> a food <b>item whose growth is not from the ground</b> one recites the blessing: By whose word all things came to be? Even according to Abaye, mushrooms grow from the ground. The Gemara answers: <b>Emend</b> the <i>baraita</i> to read: <b>Over</b> a food <b>item that does not draw sustenance from the ground,</b> one recites: By whose word all things came to be. Consequently, even over mushrooms one recites: By whose word all things came to be.

### Part 17
We learned in the mishna that <b>over <i>novelot</i></b> one recites: By whose word all things came to be. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> are <b><i>novelot</i>?</b> The Gemara responds that the <i>amora’im</i> <b>Rabbi Zeira and Rabbi Il’a</b> disputed this. <b>One said</b> that the term refers to dates that, due to extreme conditions, were <b>burned by the heat</b> of the sun and ripened prematurely. <b>And one said</b> that they are <b>dates</b> that fell from the tree because <b>of the wind.</b>

### Part 18
<b>We learned</b> later in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Over <b>any</b> food item <b>that is a type</b> resulting from a <b>curse, one does not recite a blessing over it</b> at all. <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that <i>novelot</i> are dates <b>burned by the heat</b> of the sun, <b>that is</b> the reason <b>that</b> he <b>considers them a type of curse; however, according to the one who said</b> that <i>novelot</i> are <b>dates that</b> fell because <b>of the wind, what</b> is the reason that it is considered a <b>type of curse?</b> Dates that fell from the tree are no worse than other dates.

### Part 19
The Gemara reconciles: Rabbi Yehuda’s statement was <b>about the rest,</b> the vinegar and locusts, not about the <i>novelot</i>.

### Part 20
<b>Some say</b> that the Gemara raised the question differently: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that <i>novelot</i> are dates <b>burned by the heat</b> of the sun, <b>that is</b> the reason <b>that we recite over them: By whose word all things came to be,</b> as they are of inferior quality. <b>However, to the one who said</b> that <i>novelot</i> are <b>dates that</b> fell because <b>of the wind,</b> should we recite over them: By whose word all things came to be? <b>We should recite: Who creates fruit of the tree.</b>

### Part 21
<b>Rather,</b> the conclusion is, <b>with regard to <i>novelot</i> unmodified, everyone agrees that they are</b> dates that were <b>burned by the heat</b> of the sun. <b>When they argue, it</b> is <b>with regard to</b> those dates known as <b><i>novelot temara</i>, as we learned</b> in a mishna concerning the laws of doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>]: Although, under normal circumstances, fruits that come into one’s possession by means of an <i>am ha’aretz</i> must be tithed due to concern lest the <i>am ha’aretz</i> failed to do so, the following fruits of inferior quality are <b>lenient with regard to <i>demai</i></b> and one need not tithe them: <b><i>Shittin</i>, <i>rimin</i>, <i>uzradin</i>, <i>benot shuaḥ</i>, <i>benot shikma</i>, <i>gufnin</i>, <i>nitzpa</i>, and <i>novelot temara</i>.</b>

### Part 22
The Gemara identifies these plants. <b><i>Shittin</i>, Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> They are <b>a type</b> of <b>figs. <i>Rimin</i></b> are <b>lote. <i>Uzradin</i></b> are <b>crabapples. <i>Benot shuaḥ</i>, Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> They are <b>white figs. <i>Benot shikma</i>, Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> They are <b>the fruit of the sycamore tree. <i>Gufnin</i></b> are <b>the last grapes</b> which remain on the tree at the end of the season. <b><i>Nitzpa</i></b> are the <b>fruit of the caper-bush. <i>Novelot temara</i>, Rabbi Il’a and Rabbi Zeira</b> disagreed. <b>One said</b> that they are dates <b>burned by the heat</b> of the sun, <b>and one said</b> that they are <b>dates</b> that fell because <b>of the wind.</b>

### Part 23
Here too, the Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that <i>novelot temara</i> are dates <b>burned by the heat</b> of the sun, <b>that is</b> the reason <b>that it was taught</b> concerning them: Their <i>halakhot</i> are <b>lenient with regard to <i>demai</i>,</b> meaning that it is <b>those</b> with regard to which there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether or not they were tithed <b>that are exempt</b> from being tithed. <b>Those</b> with regard to which there is <b>certainty</b> that they were not tithed, <b>one is obligated</b> to tithe those dates. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <i>novelot temara</i> are <b>dates</b> felled because <b>of the wind,</b> this is difficult: <b>Those</b> regarding which there is <b>certainty</b> that they were not tithed, <b>one is obligated? They are ownerless,</b> and ownerless produce is exempt from the requirement to tithe.

### Part 24
The Gemara responds: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> With a case where he gathered the dates that fell because of the wind and <b>made them</b> into a pile, like <b>a pile of threshed grain,</b> signifying that the produce is a finished product. <b>As Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov:</b> Even gifts to the poor such as <b>gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and</b> produce of the <b>corners,</b> which are normally exempt from tithes, if a poor person gathered them and <b>made them into a pile of threshed grain,</b> by rabbinic law <b>they were rendered</b> obligated in <b>tithes.</b> In that case, only <i>demai</i> would be exempt from tithes.

### Part 25
<b>Some say</b> that the discussion was as follows:
