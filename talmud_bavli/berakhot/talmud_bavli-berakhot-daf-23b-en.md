### Part 1
<b>they will protect me.</b> Although there were people on hand to whom he could have handed the phylacteries, he kept them to protect himself from danger. <b>Rava said: When we would walk after Rabbi Naḥman,</b> we would see that <b>when he was holding a book of <i>aggada</i>, he would give</b> it <b>to us. When he was holding phylacteries, he would not give</b> them <b>to us,</b> as <b>he said: Since the Sages permitted</b> to hold <b>them, they will protect me.</b>

### Part 2
<b>The Sages taught: One may not hold phylacteries in his hand</b> or <b>a Torah scroll in his arm and pray,</b> because his concern that the phylacteries or Torah scroll might fall will distract him from his prayer. <b>And</b> so too, with regard to sacred objects, <b>one may not urinate with them</b> in his hands <b>and may not sleep with them</b> in his hands, <b>neither a deep sleep nor</b> even <b>a brief nap. Shmuel said:</b> Not only should one holding phylacteries refrain from prayer, but one holding <b>a knife, money, a bowl,</b> or a <b>loaf</b> of bread <b>have a similar</b> status in that his concern that they might fall will distract him from his prayer.

### Part 3
<b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with this <i>baraita</i>, because it</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai. As if</b> it was in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, now</b> Beit Hillel <b>permitted</b> to hold phylacteries in his hand when he defecates in a regular bathroom, <b>is it necessary</b> to say that it is permitted when he urinates in <b>a makeshift bathroom?</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara <b>raised an objection</b> based on the second part of the <i>baraita</i>, where it was taught: <b>Matters which I permitted you</b> to do <b>here, I prohibited you</b> from doing <b>there.</b> In other words, there are matters that were permitted in a regular bathroom and not in a makeshift bathroom. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to <b>phylacteries? Granted, if you say</b> that the prohibition against urinating while wearing phylacteries is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel,</b> then we would understand the <i>baraita</i> as follows: Matters which <b>I permitted you</b> to do <b>here,</b> to hold phylacteries in a regular bathroom, <b>I have prohibited you</b> from doing <b>there,</b> in the <b>makeshift bathroom. But if you hold</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, they did not permit anything</b> in a regular bathroom. What, then, is the meaning of matters which I permitted you to do here?

### Part 5
This challenge is rejected by the Gemara, which explains: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught</b> it was not in reference to phylacteries, but <b>with regard to the matter of one handbreadth and two handbreadths.</b> As is <b>it was taught in one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>When one relieves himself, he</b> must maintain modesty and <b>bare a single handbreadth</b> of his flesh <b>behind him and two handbreadths before him. And it was taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: One may only bare <b>a single handbreadth behind him and nothing before him.</b>

### Part 6
<b>What, are not</b> both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> one referring to <b>a male, and</b> the apparent contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i> <b>is not difficult,</b> as <b>here</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that one may bare a handbreadth behind him and nothing before him is referring to <b>defecation, while here,</b> the other <i>baraita</i> that states that one may bare a handbreadth behind him and two handbreadths before him is referring to <b>urination.</b> Accordingly, despite the fact that one may bare two handbreadths before him when urinating in a makeshift bathroom, matters that I have permitted you to do here, one may bare nothing before him when defecating in an established bathroom, I have prohibited you from doing there.

### Part 7
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>And how can you understand</b> it that way? <b>If</b> that <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>urination, why do I </b>need<b> to</b> bare <b>one handbreadth behind him? Rather,</b> both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are referring to <b>defecation, and</b> the apparent contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i> is<b> not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i> that states that one may bare two handbreadths before him is referring <b>to a man,</b> who must bare himself in case he inadvertently urinates. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i> that states that one may not bare anything in front is referring <b>to a woman,</b> who does not need to uncover herself to account for inadvertent urination. 

### Part 8
The Gemara challenges this: <b>If so, then that which is taught with regard to</b> this <i>halakha</i> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This is an <i>a fortiori</i> </b>inference<b> for which there is no refutation,</b> meaning that even though logically it would seem correct to be stricter in the case of defecating in a regular bathroom than in the case of urinating in a makeshift bathroom, that is not the ruling, is difficult. According to the distinction suggested above, <b>what</b> is the meaning of: <b>for which there is no refutation? That is the nature of the matter;</b> men and women need to uncover themselves differently.

### Part 9
<b>Rather, </b>is it <b>not</b> so that the <i>baraita</i> that states: Matters which I permitted you to do here, I prohibited you from doing there, is referring to <b>phylacteries,</b> and the <i>a fortiori</i> inference that cannot be refuted is similarly referring to phylacteries. <b>And the refutation of</b> that which <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet </b>says, that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai, is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation. </b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Nevertheless, it</b> remains <b>difficult: Now,</b> holding phylacteries in his hand when he defecates in a <b>regular bathroom is permitted, all the more so</b> that it is permitted when he urinates in <b>a makeshift bathroom.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara explains: <b>It says as follows:</b> When defecating in <b>a regular bathroom, where</b> one sits <b>there are no drops</b> of urine on one’s clothes or shoes, he need not dirty his hands to clean his garment, and therefore one is <b>permitted</b> to hold phylacteries in his hand. However, in <b>a makeshift bathroom, where</b> one stands, and <b>there are</b> ricocheting <b>drops</b> which he may touch with his hand, <b>it is prohibited.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so, then why</b> was it referred to as an <i>a fortiori</i> inference that <b>“cannot be refuted”?</b> This seems <b>an excellent refutation</b> that explains the distinction.

### Part 13
The Gemara explains that <b>it says as follows: Derive this matter based on the reason</b> mentioned above that due to different circumstances the ruling is different. <b>Do not derive it by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, as</b> if you were <b>to derive it by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, it would</b> certainly <b>be an <i>a fortiori</i> inference that cannot be rebutted.</b>

### Part 14
<b>The Sages taught: One who wishes to enter</b> and partake of <b>a regular meal</b> that will last for some time, <b>paces</b> a distance of <b>four cubits ten times, or ten cubits four times,</b> in order to expedite the movement of the bowels, and <b>defecates.</b> Only <b>then may he enter</b> and partake of the meal. That way he spares himself the unpleasantness of being forced to leave in the middle of the meal.

### Part 15
On this same subject, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: One who partakes of a regular meal removes his phylacteries and then enters,</b> as it is inappropriate to partake in a meal where there is frivolity while wearing phylacteries. <b>And</b> this statement <b>disputes</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya, as Rabbi Ḥiyya said:</b> During a formal meal <b>one places</b> his phylacteries <b>on his table, and it is admirable for him</b> to do <b>so</b> in order that they will be available to don immediately if he so desires.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And until when</b> in the meal must he refrain from wearing phylacteries? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Until the time of the recitation of the blessing</b> of Grace after Meals.

### Part 17
<b>It was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may bundle his phylacteries with his money in his head covering [<i>apraksuto</i>], and it was taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not bundle</b> phylacteries and money together.

### Part 18
The Gemara explains: <b>This is not difficult,</b> as one must distinguish and say that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which prohibits bundling phylacteries and money together, refers to a case where the vessel <b>was designated</b> for use with phylacteries, while <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which permits one to do so, refers to a case where the vessel <b>was not designated</b> for that purpose. As <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> With regard to <b>this cloth</b> used with <b>phylacteries that one designated to bundle phylacteries in it,</b> if one already <b>bundled phylacteries in it then it is prohibited to bundle coins in it,</b> but if he only <b>designated it</b> for that purpose, <b>but did not yet bundle</b> phylacteries <b>in it,</b> or <b>if he bundled</b> phylacteries <b>in it</b> but did <b>not</b> originally <b>designate it</b> for that purpose, then <b>it is permitted to bundle money in it.</b>

### Part 19
<b>And according to Abaye, who said</b> that <b>designation is significant,</b> as Abaye holds that all relevant <i>halakhot</i> apply to an object designated for a specific purpose, whether or not it has been already used for that purpose, the <i>halakha</i> is: <b>If he designated</b> the cloth, <b>even if he did not bundle</b> phylacteries <b>in it,</b> he is prohibited from bundling money in it. However, if <b>he bundled</b> phylacteries <b>in it, if he designated</b> the cloth for that particular use, <b>it is prohibited</b> to bundle money in it, but <b>if he did not designate it, no,</b> it is not prohibited.

### Part 20
<b>Rav Yosef, son of Rav Neḥunya, raised a dilemma before Rav Yehuda: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>; may <b>a man place his phylacteries</b> in his bed, <b>under his head</b> while he sleeps? He himself explains: With regard to whether or not one may place them <b>under his feet, I have no dilemma, as that would be treating them in a deprecating manner</b> and is certainly prohibited. <b>My dilemma is</b> whether or not one may place them <b>under his head; what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in that case? Rav Yehuda <b>said to him, Shmuel said as follows: It is permitted, even</b> if <b>his wife is with him</b> in his bed.

### Part 21
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A man may not place his phylacteries under his feet, as</b> in doing so, <b>he treats them in a deprecating manner, but he may place them under his head. And if his wife was with him, it is prohibited</b> even to place it under his head. <b>If there was a place</b> where he could place the phylacteries <b>three handbreadths above or three handbreadths below</b> his head <b>it is permissible,</b> as that space is sufficient for the phylacteries to be considered in a separate place.

### Part 22
<b>This is a conclusive refutation of Shmuel’s</b> statement. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>

### Part 23
<b>Rava said: Although</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught</b> that constitutes <b>a conclusive refutation of Shmuel, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his</b> opinion in this matter. <b>What is the reason</b> for this?
