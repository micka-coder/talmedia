### Part 1
<b>thick [<i>ke’avin</i>],</b> so that they appear like loaves of bread, <b>they are obligated</b> in <i>ḥalla</i>, and if he shaped them <b>like boards [<i>kelimmudin</i>], they are exempt,</b> since they will certainly only be used for <i>kutaḥ</i>. <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: What blessing is recited over the dough of the ground?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Do you think that it is bread? It is merely kneaded</b> dough, <b>and</b> just like over all other cooked grains, <b>one recites over it the blessing: Who creates the various kinds of nourishment.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Mar Zutra based his meal on this</b> dough, and <b>he recited: Who brings forth bread from the earth,</b> beforehand and the <b>three blessings</b> of Grace after Meals thereafter. Since he based his meal on it, he considered it to be bread.

### Part 3
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said:</b> With these types of bread, <b>a person fulfills his obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>on Passover. What is the reason?</b> Because <b>we call it bread of affliction,</b> and in that sense, it is in the category of <i>matza</i>.

### Part 4
<b>And</b> with regard to blessings, <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said: Over this date honey one recites: By Whose word all things came to be. What is the reason</b> that one does not recite: Who creates fruit of the tree, as he does over the date itself? Because date honey is not the essence of the fruit, but <b>merely moisture</b> that drips from the ripe fruit.

### Part 5
<b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion does he recite that blessing? <b>In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as we learned</b> in a mishna: If a non-priest ate <b>date honey, apple wine or vinegar made from grapes of autumn</b> that grow stunted at the end of the season and are unfit for wine production, <b>or</b> any <b>other</b> type of <b>juice</b> made <b>from fruits of <i>teruma</i>, Rabbi Eliezer obligates</b> him to repay <b>the principal and</b> an additional <b>fifth</b> as a penalty for misuse of consecrated items. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua exempts</b> him from payment, because he holds that these are byproducts of the fruit and do not have the status of the fruit itself. Mar bar Rav Ashi’s ruling with regard to blessings was based on Rabbi Yehoshua’s ruling with regard to <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 6
<b>One of the Sages said to Rava: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b><i>terima</i>? Rava</b> was unfamiliar with the term <i>terima</i> and <b>did not understand what he was saying to him. Ravina sat before Rava</b> and <b>said to</b> the student who had posed the question to Rava: In posing the question, are <b>you speaking of sesame</b> <i>terima</i> <b>or</b> are <b>you speaking of safflower</b> <i>terima</i> <b>or</b> are <b>you speaking of grape-pits</b> <i>terima</i>?

### Part 7
<b>Meanwhile, Rava comprehended</b> the meaning of the term <b>and said to</b> the Sage: <b>Certainly, you are speaking of pressed</b> items, <b>and you reminded me of a matter that Rav Asi said: Those dates of <i>teruma</i>; one is permitted</b> to press them in order <b>to make <i>terima</i>,</b> because the dates maintain their form, <b>and one is forbidden to make</b> date <b>beer</b> from them, as in so doing the dates are damaged and it is forbidden to damage <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara concludes: The <i>halakha</i> is that <b>over dates</b> that were <b>made into <i>terima</i>, one recites: Who creates fruit of the tree. What is the reason?</b> Because <b>they remain in their original state.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara raises another question with regard to the blessing recited on <b>roasted barley to which honey or vinegar was added [<i>shetita</i>]. Rav said</b> that one recites: <b>By Whose word all things came to be; and Shmuel said</b> that one recites: <b>Who creates the various kinds of nourishment.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: And they do not disagree,</b> as each is referring to a different case. <b>This,</b> where Shmuel said that one recites: Who creates the various kinds of nourishment, <b>is in</b> a case where the mixture is <b>thick,</b> while <b>this,</b> where Rav said that one recites: By Whose word all things came to be, <b>is in</b> a case where the mixture is <b>thin.</b> When it is <b>thick, he made it as food;</b> therefore one recites a blessing just as he would over any food made from the five species of grain. When it is <b>thin, he made it as medicine,</b> therefore one only recites: By Whose word all things came to be.

### Part 10
With regard to the assumption that this mixture is essentially medicinal, <b>Rav Yosef raised a challenge</b> from the laws of Shabbat: <b>And they agree that one may mix <i>shetita</i> on Shabbat and drink Egyptian beer [<i>zitom haMitzri</i>],</b> which contains a mixture of a pungent spice in flour. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that when one prepares <i>shetita</i>, <b>his intention is for medicinal</b> purposes, <b>is medicine permitted on Shabbat?</b>

### Part 11
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Do you not hold</b> that to be true? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>All foods</b> that are commonly eaten; <b>a person may eat</b> them <b>for medicinal</b> purposes <b>on Shabbat, and all drinks</b> that are not designated for medicinal purposes, a person may <b>drink</b> them for medicinal purposes on Shabbat. <b>But what can you say</b> in explaining that ruling? <b>The man’s intention is</b> for the purpose of <b>eating;</b> here <b>too,</b> when he mixes the <i>shetita</i>, <b>the man’s intention is</b> for the purpose of <b>eating.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara cites <b>another version</b> of what was taught above: <b>But what can you say</b> in explaining that ruling? <b>The man’s intention is for</b> the purpose of <b>eating and the cure comes about on its own;</b> here <b>too, the man’s intention is for</b> the purpose of <b>eating and the cure comes about on its own.</b> Ostensibly, after proving that it is permissible to drink the <i>shetita</i> on Shabbat, it is clearly a type of food over which one is required to recite a blessing. If so, it is difficult to understand the need for Rav and Shmuel to point out that one is required to recite a blessing over it.

### Part 13
Therefore the Gemara says: <b>And</b> the statement <b>of Rav and Shmuel is necessary, as if</b> the <i>halakha</i> had been derived solely <b>from this</b> mishna that permits drinking <i>shetita</i> on Shabbat, <b>I would have said:</b> This applies specifically when <b>one’s intention is for</b> the purpose of <b>eating and the cure comes about on its own. Here, however, since from the outset, his intention</b> in eating the <i>shetita</i> <b>is for</b> the purpose of <b>medicine;</b> just as one recites no blessing when he ingests medicine, <b>let him recite no blessing over</b> the <i>shetita</i> <b>at all.</b> Therefore, Rav and Shmuel <b>taught us</b> that here, <b>since he derives pleasure from</b> eating <b>it,</b> he <b>is required to recite a blessing.</b>

### Part 14
We learned in the mishna <b>that over bread one recites: Who brings forth bread from the earth. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What does</b> one who eats bread <b>recite</b> before eating? <b>Who brings forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] bread from the earth. Rabbi Neḥemya says</b> that the blessing is phrased: <b>Who brought forth [<i>motzi</i>] bread from the earth. Rava said: Everyone agrees that</b> the term <b><i>motzi</i> means brought,</b> in the past tense, <b>as it is written: “God who brought them forth [<i>motziam</i>] from Egypt</b> is for them like the horns of the wild ox” (Numbers 23:22). <b>When do they disagree? With regard to</b> the term <b><i>hamotzi</i>, as the Rabbis hold</b> that <b><i>hamotzi</i> means</b> that God <b>brought forth,</b> in the past tense, <b>as it is written: “Who brought forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] for you water from a rock of flint”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:15), which depicts a past event. <b>Rabbi Neḥemya holds</b> that the term <b><i>hamotzi</i> means</b> that God <b>brings forth</b> in the present tense, <b>as it is stated</b> in Moses’ prophecy to the Jewish people in Egypt: “And you will know that I am the Lord your God <b>who is bringing you forth [<i>hamotzi</i>] from under the burdens of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 6:7). Since, in that context, <i>hamotzi</i> is used with regard to an event transpiring in the present or possibly even one that will transpire in the future, it is inappropriate to include this term in a blessing referencing the past.

### Part 15
<b>And the Rabbis,</b> how do they respond to that proof? The Sages interpret <b>that</b> verse to mean that <b>the Holy one, Blessed be He, said to Israel as follows: When I bring you forth, I will perform something for you that you will know that I am the one who brought you forth from Egypt, as it is written: “And you will know that I am the Lord your God who brought you forth [<i>hamotzi</i>]”;</b> in this verse, too, <i>hamotzi</i> refers to the past.

### Part 16
On that note, the Gemara relates: <b>The Sages would praise son of Rav Zevid, brother of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Zevid to Rabbi Zeira, that he is a great man and he is expert in blessings.</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> the Sages: <b>When he comes to you, bring him to me</b> so that I can meet him. <b>One day he happened</b> to come <b>before him. They brought out bread</b> to the guest, <b>he began and recited: Who brought forth [<i>motzi</i>] bread from the earth.</b> Rabbi Zeira grew annoyed <b>and said: This is he of whom they say that he is a great man and expert in blessings? Granted, had he recited: <i>Hamotzi,</i></b>
