### Part 1
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> When breaking bread, one <b>recites the blessing</b> over the complete loaf <b>and</b> only <b>afterwards, he breaks it.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: The Sages <b>of Neharde’a acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> and would recite the blessing as they were breaking the bread and conclude the blessing as he finished breaking off the piece of bread. <b>And the Rabbis acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava</b> and would recite the blessing before breaking the bread. <b>Ravina said: My mother told me: Your father acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya, as Rabbi Ḥiyya said: The blessing must conclude with</b> the beginning of the breaking of <b>the</b> loaf of <b>bread. And the Rabbis acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava,</b> who <b>said</b> one <b>recites the blessing</b> over the complete loaf <b>and</b> only <b>afterwards he breaks it.</b>

### Part 3
<b>It was stated</b> that there was an amoraic dispute with regard to whether to recite the blessing over a whole loaf of bread or to recite it over a piece of bread: If <b>they brought pieces and whole</b> loaves of bread <b>before</b> those partaking of a meal, <b>Rav Huna said: One</b> may <b>recite the blessing over the pieces and</b> with that blessing <b>exempts the whole</b> loaves as well. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The optimal manner</b> in which to fulfill <b>the mitzva</b> is to recite the blessing over the <b>whole</b> loaf. <b>However,</b> if the <b>piece was of wheat</b> bread <b>and the whole</b> loaf <b>was of barley</b> bread, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>one recites a blessing over the piece of wheat</b> bread. Although it is a piece of bread, it is nevertheless of superior quality, <b>and</b> in so doing <b>one exempts the whole</b> loaf <b>of barley</b> bread.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> that the dispute between Rav Huna and Rabbi Yoḥanan is <b>parallel</b> to a <b>tannaitic</b> dispute with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>teruma</i>. We learned: Even though the onions from which the <i>teruma</i> must be separated are divided equally between the two, <b>one separates <i>teruma</i> from a whole small onion but not from half of a large onion. Rabbi Yehuda says: No, rather,</b> he separates <i>teruma</i> from <b>half of a large onion. What, is it not that they disagree over this</b> point, <b>that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>held</b> that the <b>more significant takes precedence;</b> therefore half of a large onion which is of superior quality is preferable, <b>and</b> the first <i>tanna</i> <b>held</b> that the <b>whole</b> item <b>takes precedence?</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects this comparison: <b>Where there is a priest</b> who can immediately take the <i>teruma</i> from him, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>more significant takes precedence. When they disagree</b> is in a case <b>where there is no priest</b> there, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Everywhere that there is a priest, one separates <i>teruma</i> from the best, and whenever there is no priest, one separates <i>teruma</i> from that which will endure,</b> so that when a priest ultimately receives it, he will be able to derive benefit from it. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One</b> always <b>separates <i>teruma</i> only from the best,</b> even though it is not the longest-lasting.

### Part 6
With regard to the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rav Huna, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: A God-fearing individual fulfills both. And who is this</b> God-fearing person? <b>Mar, son of Ravina,</b> as the Gemara relates that <b>Mar, son of Ravina,</b> would <b>place the piece inside the</b> whole <b>loaf and break</b> them together.

### Part 7
Similarly, the Gemara relates that <b>the <i>tanna</i> recited</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak: One places the piece inside the whole</b> loaf, then <b>breaks</b> the bread <b>and recites a blessing.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: What is your name? He answered: Shalman.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>replied</b> with a pun: <b>You are peace [<i>shalom</i>] and</b> the <b>teaching</b> that <b>you</b> recited <b>is complete [<i>shelema</i>] as</b> by means of this <i>baraita</i> the disputing opinions are reconciled and <b>you established peace among students.</b>

### Part 8
This resolution is reinforced in a unique case, as <b>Rav Pappa said: Everyone agrees that</b> while fulfilling the mitzva of eating <i>matza</i> <b>on Passover, one places the piece inside the whole and breaks. What is the reason?</b> With regard to <i>matza</i> the phrase <b>“Bread of affliction”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3) <b>is written,</b> and the poor typically eat their bread in pieces. Therefore, eating <i>matza</i> on Passover evening, the broken <i>matza</i> is also significant.

### Part 9
In connection to the various <i>halakhot</i> with regard to breaking bread, especially on Festivals, the Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rabbi Abba said: And on Shabbat one is obligated to break</b> bread for the meal <b>over two loaves. What is the reason?</b> Because in the Torah portion that discusses gathering manna on Friday for Shabbat, the phrase: <b>“Twice as much bread”</b> (Exodus 16:22) <b>is written.</b> To commemorate this, Shabbat meals are based on two loaves of bread.

### Part 10
With regard to the manner in which these two loaves are to be broken, <b>Rav Ashi said: I saw Rav Kahana who would take two</b> loaves <b>and break one. Rabbi Zeira would break</b> off one large piece from the loaf, and eat from it <b>for the entire</b> Shabbat <b>meal. Ravina said to Rav Ashi</b> about this: <b>Doesn’t it appear gluttonous</b> for one to break off so large a piece? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Since every</b> other <b>day</b> he <b>does not do so, and today he does, it does not appear gluttonous,</b> but rather in deference to the mitzva of the Shabbat meals.

### Part 11
With regard to eating on Shabbat, the Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ami and Rav Asi, when the</b> opportunity to use <b>the bread of the <i>eiruv</i></b> in the Shabbat meal <b>would present itself,</b> they would <b>recite: Who brings forth bread from the earth over it. They said</b> in explanation: <b>Since one mitzva was performed with it, we will perform another mitzva with it.</b>
