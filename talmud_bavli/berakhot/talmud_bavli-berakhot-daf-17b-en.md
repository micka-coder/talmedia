### Part 1
<b>“There is no breach”; that our faction</b> of Sages <b>should not be like the faction of David, from which Ahitophel emerged,</b> who caused a breach in the kingdom of David. <br><b>“And no going forth”; that our faction should not be like the faction of Saul, from which Doeg the Edomite emerged,</b> who set forth on an evil path. <br><b>“And no outcry”; that our faction should not be like the faction of Elisha, from which Geihazi emerged.</b> <br><b>“In our open places”; that we should not have a child or student who overcooks his food in public,</b> i.e., who sins in public and causes others to sin, <b>as</b> in the well-known case of <b>Jesus the Nazarene.</b>

### Part 2
Having cited a dispute with regard to the interpretation of a verse where we are uncertain whether the dispute is between Rav and Shmuel or Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar, the Gemara cites another verse with regard to which there is a similar dispute. It is said: <b>“Hear Me, stubborn-hearted who are far from charity”</b> (Isaiah 46:12). While both agree that the verse refers to the righteous, <b>Rav and Shmuel, and some say Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar,</b> disagreed as to how to interpret the verse. <b>One said: The entire world is sustained by</b> God’s <b>charity,</b> not because it deserves to exist, <b>while</b> the righteous who are far from God’s charity <b>are sustained by force,</b> as due to their own good deeds they have the right to demand their sustenance. <b>And one said: The entire world is sustained by the merit</b> of <b>their</b> righteousness, <b>while they are not sustained</b> at all, <b>not even by their own merit, in accordance with</b> the statement that <b>Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said.</b>

### Part 3
<b>As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Every day a Divine Voice emerges from Mount Horeb and says: The entire world is sustained by</b> the merit of <b>Ḥanina</b> ben Dosa, <b>my son, and</b> for <b>Ḥanina, my son, a <i>kav</i> of carobs is sufficient</b> to sustain him for an entire week, <b>from</b> one <b>Shabbat eve to</b> the next <b>Shabbat eve.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And</b> this exegesis <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda said, who are the stubborn-hearted?</b> They are the <b>foolish</b> heathens <b>of Gova’ei. Rav Yosef said: Know</b> that this is so, <b>as no convert has ever converted from their</b> ranks.

### Part 5
Similarly, <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The heathen residents <b>of</b> the city <b>Mata Meḥasya are the stubborn-hearted, as they witness the glory of the Torah twice a year</b> at the <i>kalla</i> gatherings in Adar and Elul, when thousands of people congregate and study Torah <i>en masse</i>, <b>yet no convert has ever converted from their</b> ranks.

### Part 6
We learned in our mishna that <b>if a groom wishes to recite</b> <i>Shema</i> on the first night of his marriage, he may do so, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel prohibited doing so because of the appearance of presumptuousness.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is concerned about presumptuousness and the Rabbis are not concerned about presumptuousness? Didn’t we learn</b> that <b>they</b> say <b>the opposite? As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>A place where they were accustomed to perform labor on Ninth of Av, one</b> may <b>perform</b> labor. <b>A place where they were accustomed not to perform</b> labor on Ninth of Av, <b>one</b> may <b>not perform</b> labor. <b>And everywhere, Torah scholars are idle</b> and do not perform labor. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> With regard to performing labor on the Ninth of Av, <b>one should always conduct himself as a Torah scholar.</b>

### Part 8
If so, <b>there is a contradiction between</b> the statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> here <b>and</b> the statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> there. And, <b>there is a contradiction between</b> the statement of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> here <b>and</b> the statement of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> there.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The attribution</b> of the opinions <b>is reversed</b> in one of the sources in the interest of avoiding contradiction. <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said: Actually,</b> you need <b>not reverse</b> the opinions, as the contradiction between the statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> here <b>and</b> the statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> there <b>is not difficult.</b> In the case of <b>the recitation of <i>Shema</i></b> on his wedding night, <b>since everyone is reciting</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>and he is also reciting</b> <i>Shema</i>, he is not conspicuous and <b>it does not appear as presumptuousness. Here,</b> in the case of the Ninth of Av, however, <b>since everyone is performing labor and he is not performing labor,</b> his idleness is conspicuous and <b>appears as presumptuousness.</b>

### Part 10
So too, the contradiction <b>between</b> the statement of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> here <b>and</b> the statement of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> there <b>is not difficult. There,</b> in the case of the recitation of <i>Shema</i> on his wedding night, <b>the matter is dependent upon his</b> capacity to <b>concentrate,</b> and <b>it is clear to all</b> that <b>he is unable to concentrate.</b> Reciting <i>Shema</i> under those circumstances is a display of presumptuousness. <b>But here,</b> in the case of the Ninth of Av, <b>one who sees</b> him idle <b>says: It is</b> because <b>he has no labor</b> to perform. <b>Go out and see how many idle people there are in the marketplace,</b> even on days when one is permitted to work. Consequently, his idleness is not conspicuous.
