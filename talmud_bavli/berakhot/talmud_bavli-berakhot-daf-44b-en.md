### Part 1
<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said in the name of Rabbeinu,</b> Rav: <b>Over the egg and types of meat [<i>kupra</i>], at the start, one recites: By Whose word all things came to be, and at the end: Who creates the many forms of life. However,</b> after eating <b>vegetables, no,</b> one does not recite a blessing at all. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Even</b> after eating <b>vegetables</b> one recites a blessing; <b>but</b> after drinking <b>water, no,</b> one does not recite a blessing at all. <b>And Rav Pappa said: Even</b> after drinking <b>water</b> one must recite a blessing.

### Part 2
<b>Mar Zutra acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avdimi</b> and did not recite a blessing after eating vegetables, while <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> and recited a blessing after eating vegetables. <b>And a mnemonic</b> by which to remember which Sage acted in accordance with which: <b>One like two, and two like one.</b> In other words, Mar Zutra, who is known only by his name and not by his patronymic, acted in accordance with Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi who is known by both his name and his patronymic. Rav Shimi bar Ashi, who is known by both his names, followed the opinion of Rabbi Yitzḥak, who is known only by his first name.

### Part 3
On this topic, <b>Rav Ashi said: At times when I remember, I act in accordance with</b> the opinions of <b>all of them</b> and recite a blessing even after drinking water.

### Part 4
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Anything that requires a blessing thereafter requires a blessing beforehand; and there are</b> items <b>that require a blessing beforehand and do not require a blessing thereafter.</b> If so, <b>granted, according to Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi’s</b> opinion, it <b>excludes vegetables</b> from the requirement to recite a blessing thereafter. And, granted, <b>according to Rabbi Yitzḥak’s</b> opinion as well, it <b>excludes water</b> from the requirement to recite a blessing thereafter. <b>However, according to Rav Pappa’s opinion, what does it exclude?</b> What food requires a blessing before eating but does not require a blessing after eating?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: It comes <b>to exclude mitzvot,</b> as one recites a blessing before performing a mitzva, but not thereafter.

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges: <b>And for the residents of the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>who, after they remove their phylacteries, recite: Who has made us holy through His mitzvot and commanded us to keep His laws, what</b> does the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna <b>come to exclude?</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara responds: It serves <b>to exclude</b> types of <b>fragrances.</b> Everyone agrees that no blessing is recited after smelling them.

### Part 8
Since the blessing recited over an egg was mentioned, the Gemara cites what <b>Rabbi Yannai said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: Anything that is an egg’s equivalent</b> in volume, <b>an egg is superior to it.</b> Similarly, <b>when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said: A lightly cooked egg is better than six <i>log</i> of fine flour.</b> Similarly, <b>when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said: A lightly cooked egg is better than six</b> <i>log</i> of fine flour, a <b>roasted</b> egg is better than <b>four,</b> and with regard to a <b>cooked</b> egg, they said: <b>Anything that is an egg’s equivalent, an egg is superior to it except for meat.</b>

### Part 9
We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Even</b> if <b>one ate boiled vegetables, but it is his</b> primary <b>sustenance, he recites</b> the <b>three blessings</b> of Grace after Meals, as he would after eating bread. The Gemara asks: <b>And is there a</b> vegetable <b>where in its boiled</b> state <b>it is</b> primary <b>sustenance? Rav Ashi said: This was taught</b> with regard to <b>a cabbage stalk,</b> which is nourishing.

### Part 10
Similarly, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> dealing with types of sustenance: Meat of the <b>spleen is beneficial for the teeth and harmful for the intestines. Leeks,</b> however, <b>are harmful for the teeth and beneficial for the intestines.</b> They also said that <b>all raw vegetables</b> turn one’s face <b>pale.</b> Generally speaking, <b>anything small</b> that has not yet reached its full size is harmful and <b>impedes growth, and any living creature</b> eaten whole, e.g., a fully grown fish, <b>restores the soul. And anything close to the soul restores the soul. Cabbage</b> is <b>for nourishment and beets for healing. Woe unto the house through which the turnip passes,</b> for it is extremely harmful.

### Part 11
<b>The Master said</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The spleen is beneficial for the teeth and harmful for the intestines.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is its remedy?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>One should chew it,</b> spit it out, <b>and throw it away.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Leeks are harmful for the teeth and beneficial for the intestines.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is its remedy?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>One should boil them and swallow them</b> without chewing.

### Part 13
<b>All raw vegetables</b> turn one’s face <b>pale. Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> It refers here <b>to the first meal after bloodletting,</b> when a person should eat more substantial food.

### Part 14
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who eats vegetables before four hours</b> of the day, <b>it is forbidden to speak with him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> The Gemara explains: This is <b>because the smell</b> of vegetables from his mouth bothers others who have not yet eaten. <b>And</b> in general, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is forbidden to eat raw vegetables before four hours</b> of the day.

### Part 15
The Gemara relates that <b>Ameimar, Mar Zutra, and Rav Ashi were sitting. They brought raw vegetables before them before four hours</b> of the day. <b>Ameimar and Rav Ashi ate and Mar Zutra did not eat. They said to him: What is your thinking</b> that led you not to eat? Was it because <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who eats vegetables before four hours</b> of the day, <b>it is forbidden to speak with him because of the smell? Aren’t we eating and you are</b> nevertheless <b>speaking with us?</b>

### Part 16
<b>He said to them: I hold in accordance with the other</b> <i>halakha</i> of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> simply: <b>It is forbidden to eat raw vegetables before four hours</b> of the day.

### Part 17
<b>Anything small impedes growth. Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This applies <b>even to a small goat,</b> worth <b>a <i>zuz</i>.</b> Although the goat is worth a <i>zuz</i>, it is still small. <b>And we only said</b> this with regard <b>to</b> a goat that <b>has not</b> reached <b>one fourth</b> of its ultimate size. <b>But</b> if <b>it has</b> reached <b>one fourth</b> of its ultimate size, <b>we need not</b> be concerned.

### Part 18
<b>And any living creature</b> eaten whole <b>restores the soul. Rav Pappa said:</b> This includes <b>even small fish</b> that grow <b>among the reeds,</b> as even a small creature is beneficial if it reached its full size.

### Part 19
<b>Anything close to the soul restores the soul. Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> This refers to the <b>neck,</b> which is close to the animal’s vital organs. The Gemara relates that <b>Rava said to his servant: When you bring me a piece of meat, make an effort to bring me</b> a piece <b>from the place of the blessing,</b> the neck, where the animal was slaughtered and the slaughterer recited a blessing over the ritual slaughter.

### Part 20
<b>Cabbage for nourishment and beets for healing.</b> The Gemara asks: Is <b>cabbage</b> good <b>for nourishment and not for healing? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Six things cure the ill</b> person <b>of his disease and their cure is an</b> effective <b>cure, and these are: Cabbage, beets, chamomile water, honey, stomach, <i>heret</i>, and liver.</b> Evidently, cabbage is also good for healing. The Gemara responds: <b>Rather, say: Cabbage is even for sustenance</b> and all the more so for healing, which is not the case with beets.

### Part 21
<b>Woe unto the house through which the turnip passes,</b> as it is extremely damaging. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rava say to his servant: When you see a turnip in the market, do not ask me with what will you eat your bread today?</b> Buy the turnip and bring it for the meal. Apparently, the turnip is a significant and appropriate food.

### Part 22
<b>Abaye said:</b> The turnip is harmful only when it is eaten <b>without meat. And Rava said: Without wine. It was stated</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The turnip is harmful when it is eaten <b>without meat. And Shmuel said: Without wood,</b> meaning when it is not properly cooked. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Without wine.</b>

### Part 23
Along the same lines, <b>Rava said to Rav Pappa: Farmer</b> (<i>ge’onim</i>) <b>we break</b> the harmful aspects of the turnip <b>with meat and wine. You, who do not have a lot of wine, with what do you break its</b> harmful aspects? Rav Pappa <b>said to him: With wood. As that</b> is what <b>Rav Pappa’s wife</b> would do. <b>After she cooked</b> the turnip, <b>she would break it with eighty pieces</b> of wood <b>from a palm tree.</b>

### Part 24
On the topic of foods, the Gemara cites what <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A small salted fish sometimes kills,</b> specifically <b>seven</b> days, <b>seventeen</b> days, <b>and twenty-seven</b> days after it was salted. <b>And some say: Twenty-three. And we only said this when it is roasted and not roasted</b> well, <b>but</b> when it is <b>roasted well, we need not</b> be concerned. <b>And when it is not roasted well, we only said this when one does not drink beer thereafter; however,</b> when <b>one drinks beer thereafter, we need not</b> be concerned.

### Part 25
We learned in the mishna that the <i>tanna’im</i> disagreed with regard to one who <b>drinks water</b> to quench <b>his thirst.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What does</b> this emphasis on his thirst come <b>to exclude? Rav Idi bar Avin said:</b> It comes <b>to exclude one</b>
