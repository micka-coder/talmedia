### Part 1
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rabbi Zeira took ill. Rabbi Abbahu went to visit him and resolved: If the little man with the scorched legs,</b> a nickname for Rabbi Zeira, <b>is cured, I will make a festival,</b> a feast, <b>for the Sages.</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>was cured and</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>made a feast for all the Sages. When it came time to break</b> bread, Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to Rabbi Zeira: Master,</b> please <b>break</b> bread <b>for us.</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Doesn’t the Master hold</b> in accordance with <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who <b>said: The host breaks</b> bread? Rabbi Abbahu <b>broke</b> bread <b>for them.</b>

### Part 2
<b>When</b> the time <b>came to recite the blessing,</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: <b>Master, recite</b> Grace after Meals <b>on our behalf.</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Doesn’t the Master hold</b> in accordance with <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rabbi Huna of Babylonia,</b> who <b>said: He who breaks</b> bread <b>recites</b> Grace after Meals?

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>does</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>hold</b> that he asked Rabbi Zeira to recite Grace after Meals?

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Abbahu holds in accordance with that <i>halakha</i> <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: The host breaks bread and a guest recites</b> Grace after Meals. <b>The host breaks</b> bread <b>so that he will break</b> bread <b>generously,</b> whereas a guest might be embarrassed to break a large piece for himself and other guests; <b>and the guest recites</b> Grace after Meals <b>so that he may bless the host</b> in the course of reciting Grace after Meals, as the Gemara proceeds to explain.

### Part 5
<b>What is</b> the formula of the blessing with which the guest <b>blesses</b> his host?<br><b>May it be Your will that the master of the house shall not suffer shame in this world, nor humiliation in the World-to-Come.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>added to it elements</b> pertaining to material success:<br><b>And may he be very successful with all his possessions,</b> <br><b>and may his possessions and our possessions be successful and near the city,</b> <br><b>and may Satan control neither his deeds nor our deeds,</b> <br><b>and may no thought of sin, iniquity, or transgression stand before him or before us</b> <br><b>from now and for evermore.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Until where</b> does <b>the <i>zimmun</i> blessing</b> extend?

### Part 8
<b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> The blessing extends only <b>until: Let us bless. Rav Sheshet says</b> that the <i>zimmun</i> blessing extends <b>until</b> the end of the first blessing of Grace after Meals: <b>Who feeds</b> all.

### Part 9
The Gemara proposes: <b>Let us say</b> that this amoraic dispute <b>is parallel to a</b> dispute <b>between the <i>tanna’im</i>. As one</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>taught: Grace after Meals</b> is <b>two and three</b> blessings, <b>and another</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>taught: Grace after Meals</b> is <b>three and four</b> blessings. In attempting to understand these conflicting <i>baraitot</i>, the Sages <b>assumed that everyone</b> agrees that the blessing: <b>Who is good and does good,</b> the fourth blessing of Grace after Meals, <b>is not</b> required <b>by Torah law. What</b> then? <b>Is it not that they disagree about this: The one who said</b> that Grace after Meals is <b>two and three</b> blessings <b>holds that the <i>zimmun</i> blessing extends until</b> the end of the blessing: <b>Who feeds</b> all? If there is a <i>zimmun</i>, three blessings are recited; if there is no <i>zimmun</i>, only two blessings are recited, since the blessing: <b>Who feeds</b> all, is not recited. <b>And the one who said</b> that Grace after Meals is <b>three and four</b> blessings <b>holds</b> that the <i>zimmun</i> blessing extends only <b>until: Let us bless,</b> and includes no part of Grace after Meals itself. If there is a <i>zimmun</i>, four blessings are recited, the three blessing of Grace after Meals plus the blessing of the <i>zimmun</i>, while if there is not, only three blessings are recited.

### Part 10
This explanation distinguishing between the <i>baraitot</i> is rejected: <b>No; Rav Naḥman explains in accordance with his reasoning and Rav Sheshet explains in accordance with his reasoning.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rav Naḥman explains in accordance with his reasoning; everyone</b> agrees that the <i>zimmun</i> blessing extends only <b>until Let us bless.</b> According to <b>the one who said</b> that Grace after Meals is <b>three and four</b> blessings, this works out <b>well. And the one who said</b> that Grace after Meals is <b>two and three</b> blessings could have <b>said to you: Here we are dealing with the blessing recited by laborers, as the Master said</b> that when a laborer is working, he is permitted to abridge Grace after Meals, and <b>he begins with</b> the blessing: <b>Who feeds</b> all, <b>and includes</b> the third blessing: <b>Who builds Jerusalem, in</b> the context of the second blessing, <b>the blessing of the land.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Sheshet explains in accordance with his reasoning; everyone</b> agrees that the <i>zimmun</i> blessing extends <b>until</b> the end of the blessing: <b>Who feeds</b> all. According to <b>the one who said</b> that Grace after Meals is <b>two and three</b> blessings, this works out <b>well; and the one who said</b> that Grace after Meals is <b>three and four</b> blessings <b>holds</b> that the blessing: <b>Who is good and does good, is</b> required <b>by Torah law.</b>

### Part 13
With regard to the matter of the blessing: Who is good and does good, <b>Rav Yosef said: Know</b> that the blessing: <b>Who is good and does good, is not</b> required <b>by Torah law, as laborers</b> who recite Grace after Meals at work <b>eliminate it.</b> If it can be eliminated, it could not be a Torah obligation.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta said</b> another proof <b>in the name of Rav: Know</b> that the blessing: <b>Who is good and does good, is not</b> required <b>by Torah law,</b> as one who recites it <b>begins</b> to recite it <b>with: Blessed, but does not conclude reciting it with: Blessed.</b> This is the formula in all comparable blessings, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All blessings,</b> one <b>begins</b> to recite <b>them with: Blessed, and concludes</b> reciting <b>them with: Blessed, except for blessings over fruit, blessings over mitzvot, a blessing that is juxtaposed to another</b> blessing, <b>and the final blessing after <i>Shema</i>. There are among these</b> blessings <b>those that</b> one who recites it <b>begins</b> to recite it <b>with: Blessed, but does not conclude reciting it with: Blessed;</b>
