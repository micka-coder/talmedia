### Part 1
<b>We only said</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where those</b> members of the previous groups <b>did not include them in the <i>zimmun</i> in their</b> original <b>place, but in a case where they included them in the <i>zimmun</i> in their</b> original <b>place, their</b> obligation to participate in a <b><i>zimmun</i> has left them.</b> The obligation incumbent upon these three individuals to form a <i>zimmun</i> stems from their obligation to form a <i>zimmun</i> with the members of their original groups. If their groups already included them in a <i>zimmun</i>, their obligation as individuals has lapsed and they can no longer form another <i>zimmun</i>.

### Part 2
In order to explain the general principle contained in this halakhic ruling, <b>Rava said: From where do I</b> derive to <b>say this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>A</b> ritually impure <b>bed, half of which was stolen or half of which was lost, or it was divided by brothers</b> after they inherited it from their father, or was divided by <b>partners, it is ritually pure.</b> This is true with regard to any ritually impure utensil that was broken or divided; it is no longer a utensil and is therefore ritually pure. However, <b>if they restored it</b> and reattached the parts, <b>it is susceptible to ritual impurity from here on.</b>

### Part 3
Rava infers: <b>From here on, yes,</b> it is susceptible to ritual impurity, <b>retroactively, no,</b> it does not reassume its previous status of ritual impurity. <b>Apparently, once they divided it, the ritual impurity left it.</b> Although it was restored, it does not reassume its previous status of ritual impurity. <b>Here, too, once they included them in the <i>zimmun</i>, their</b> obligation <b>left them</b> and they do not reassume their previous obligation.

### Part 4
The mishna explained the circumstances in which <b>two groups</b> that were eating in one house may combine to form a <i>zimmun</i>. The Gemara adds: <b>It was taught: If there is a</b> common <b>waiter among them,</b> serving both groups, <b>the waiter joins them</b> into a single group, even if they cannot see each other.

### Part 5
In the mishna, we learned: <b>One does not recite a blessing over wine</b> until he adds water to it, that is the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. And the Rabbis say: One recites a blessing over it. Regarding this, <b>the Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Over wine, until he added water to it, one does not recite: Who creates fruit of the vine; rather,</b> he recites: <b>Who creates fruit of the tree,</b> as it is merely fruit juice and not wine. Moreover, since it is not halakhically considered wine, <b>one</b> ritually <b>washes his hands with it. Once he added water to it,</b> however, it is considered wine, and <b>one recites over it: Who creates fruit of the vine, and one does not</b> ritually <b>wash his hands with it,</b> that is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. The Rabbis say: In either case,</b> whether water has been added or not, it is considered wine for all intents and purposes, and <b>one recites over it: Who creates fruit of the vine, and one may not</b> ritually <b>wash his hands from it.</b>

### Part 6
<b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>which Shmuel said: A person may perform all his needs with bread?</b> He may use it for purposes other than food, and he need not be concerned that he is treating the food contemptuously. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion among the tannaitic opinions cited above? The Gemara answers: It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who permits one to wash his hands with undiluted wine.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: The Rabbis agree with Rabbi Eliezer with regard to a cup of blessing,</b> e.g., the cup of wine over which Grace after Meals is recited, <b>that one does not recite a blessing over it until he adds water to it. What is the reason? Rav Oshaya said: We require</b> that <b>a mitzva be</b> performed <b>in the best</b> possible manner.

### Part 8
With regard the issue of wine itself, the Gemara asks: <b>And according to the Rabbis, for what is</b> undiluted wine, which is virtually undrinkable, <b>fit? Rabbi Zeira said:</b> It is good <b>for <i>koraiytei</i>,</b> a medicinal drink made of wine and oil.

### Part 9
The Gemara continues to discuss the topic of using food. <b>The Sages taught: Four things were said with regard to bread: One may not place raw meat on bread</b> so the blood will not drip onto the bread and render it inedible; <b>and one may not pass a full cup</b> of wine <b>over bread</b> lest the wine drip on it and ruin the bread; <b>and one may not throw bread; and one may not prop up a dish with</b> a piece of <b>bread.</b> The basis for these laws is the need to treat bread with respect.

### Part 10
The Gemara recounts: <b>Ameimar, Mar Zutra and Rav Ashi ate bread together when they brought dates and pomegranates before them. Mar Zutra took</b> fruit <b>and threw a portion before Rav Ashi.</b> Rav Ashi was astounded and <b>said to him:</b> Does <b>the Master not hold with that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not throw food?</b> He responded: <b>That was taught with regard to bread,</b> not other foods. Rav Ashi challenged him again: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as one may not throw bread, so too one may not throw</b> other <b>foods?</b> Mar Zutra <b>said to him: Wasn’t</b> the opposite <b>taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Although one may not throw bread, he may throw</b> other <b>foods?</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rather,</b> that is <b>not difficult,</b> as the two <i>baraitot</i> address two different cases. <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i>, in which it is taught that one may not throw other foods, refers to <b>a</b> food <b>item that becomes disgusting</b> when thrown, whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, in which it is taught that one may throw other foods, refers to <b>a</b> food <b>item that does not become disgusting</b> when thrown.

### Part 12
Similarly, <b>the Sages taught: One may draw wine through pipes before a bride and groom</b> as a blessed omen, and one may <b>throw roasted grain and nuts before them in the summer, but not in the rainy season,</b> as in the summer they can be retrieved and eaten, which is not the case in the rainy season. <b>But one may not throw cakes, neither in the summer nor in the rainy season.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav Yehuda said: If one forgot and put food</b> items <b>in his mouth without</b> reciting <b>a blessing, he moves them to one side</b> of his mouth <b>and recites the blessing.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara notes that there are three <i>baraitot</i> on this topic: <b>It was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>He swallows them. It was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>He spits them out. Another</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>taught: He moves them</b> to the side of his mouth.

### Part 15
The Gemara explains: That is <b>not difficult,</b> as each <i>baraita</i> addresses a different case. <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>in which it was taught: He swallows them</b> refers <b>to liquids,</b> as there is no alternative. <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>in which it was taught: He spits them out,</b> refers to <b>a</b> food <b>item that does not become disgusting</b> and if he removes it from his mouth he can subsequently eat it. <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>in which it was taught: He moves them</b> to the side of his mouth, refers to <b>a</b> food <b>item that becomes disgusting,</b> in which case it is sufficient to move it to the side.
