### Part 1
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in tractate <i>Derekh Eretz</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva said: I once entered the bathroom after</b> my teacher <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, and I learned three things from</b> observing <b>his</b> behavior: <b>I learned that one should not defecate</b> while facing <b>east and west, but rather</b> while facing <b>north and south; I learned that one should not uncover himself</b> while <b>standing, but</b> while <b>sitting,</b> in the interest of modesty; <b>and I learned that one should not wipe with his right</b> hand, <b>but with his left. Ben Azzai,</b> a student of Rabbi Akiva, <b>said to him: You were impertinent to your teacher to that extent</b> that you observed that much? <b>He replied: It is Torah, and I must learn.</b>

### Part 2
Similarly, <b>we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ben Azzai said: I once entered a bathroom after Rabbi Akiva, and I learned three things from</b> observing <b>his</b> behavior: <b>I learned that one should not defecate</b> while facing <b>east and west, but rather</b> while facing <b>north and south; I learned that one should not uncover himself</b> while <b>standing, but</b> while <b>sitting; and I learned that one should not wipe with his right</b> hand, <b>but with his left. Rabbi Yehuda said to him: You were impertinent to your teacher to that extent? He replied: It is Torah, and I must learn.</b>

### Part 3
On a similar note, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Kahana entered and lay beneath Rav’s bed. He heard</b> Rav <b>chatting and laughing</b> with his wife, <b>and seeing to his needs,</b> i.e., having relations with her. Rav Kahana <b>said to</b> Rav: <b>The mouth</b> of <b>Abba,</b> Rav, <b>is like</b> one whom <b>has never eaten a cooked dish,</b> i.e., his behavior was lustful. Rav <b>said to him: Kahana, you are here? Leave, as</b> this <b>is an undesirable mode of behavior.</b> Rav Kahana <b>said to him: It is Torah, and I must learn.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>Why must one not wipe</b> himself <b>with his right</b> hand, <b>but with his left? Rava said: Because the Torah was given with the right</b> hand, <b>as it is stated: “At His right hand was a fiery law unto them”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2). <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Because</b> the right hand <b>is close to the mouth,</b> i.e., people eat with the right hand. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Because one ties the phylacteries</b> onto his left hand <b>with</b> his right hand. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Because one points to the</b> cantillation <b>notes of the Torah with</b> his right hand.

### Part 5
The Gemara notes that this is <b>parallel to a tannaitic</b> dispute: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One is forbidden to wipe himself with his right hand <b>because he eats with it. Rabbi Yehoshua says: Because he writes with it. Rabbi Akiva says: Because he points to the notes of the Torah with it.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai said: Anyone who is modest in the bathroom will be saved from three things: From snakes, from scorpions and from demons. And some say</b> that <b>even his dreams will be settling for him.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara relates: <b>There was a particular bathroom in</b> the city of <b>Tiberias, where, when two would enter it, even during the day, they would be harmed</b> by demons. When <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi would each enter alone, they were not harmed. The Sages said to them: Aren’t you afraid?</b> Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi <b>said to them: We have learned</b> through tradition: The <b>tradition</b> to avoid danger in the <b>bathroom</b> is to conduct oneself with <b>modesty and silence. The tradition</b> to end <b>suffering</b> is with <b>silence and prayer.</b>

### Part 8
Because fear of demons in bathrooms was pervasive, the Gemara relates: <b>Abaye’s mother raised a lamb to accompany him to the bathroom.</b> The Gemara objects: She should have <b>raised a goat for him.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>A goat</b> could be <b>interchanged with a goat-demon.</b> Since both the demon and the goat are called <i>sa’ir</i>, they were afraid to bring a goat to a place frequented by demons.

### Part 9
<b>Before Rava became the head of the yeshiva,</b> his wife, <b>the daughter of Rav Ḥisda, would rattle a nut in a copper vessel for him.</b> This was in order to fend off demons when he was in the bathroom. <b>After</b> he was chosen to <b>preside</b> as head of the yeshiva, he required an additional degree of protection, so <b>she constructed a window for him,</b> opposite where he would defecate, <b>and placed her hand upon his head.</b>

### Part 10
With regard to where one may or may not go to defecate, <b>Ulla said: Behind a fence, one</b> need not distance himself from people and <b>may defecate immediately. In a valley</b> or open field, one must distance himself <b>sufficiently so that if he passes wind, no one will hear him. Isi bar Natan taught as follows: Behind a fence</b> one must distance himself <b>sufficiently so that if he passes wind another does not hear him, and in a valley,</b> one must distance himself <b>sufficiently so that no one can see him.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on what we learned in a mishna in <i>Teharot</i>: Physical laborers, who usually fall into the category of <i>am ha’aretz</i> and are not generally cautious with regard to the laws of ritual purity, <b>exit from the entrance of the olive press, defecate behind the fence, and are ritually pure.</b> There is no reason to be concerned that they might become impure in the interim. This indicates that a greater distance is unnecessary.

### Part 12
The Gemara responds: <b>With regard to</b> the laws of <b>ritual purity, they were lenient.</b> To ensure maintenance of purity, they were lenient and did not require a greater distance.

### Part 13
<b>Come and hear</b> from what we learned: <b>How far</b> may workers <b>distance themselves, and</b> the fruit and oil <b>will</b> remain <b>pure?</b> They may distance themselves only <b>so far that he</b> still <b>sees him.</b> This contradicts the opinion of Isi bar Natan, who required them to distance themselves sufficiently that they may not be seen. The Gemara responds: Those <b>who eat in purity are different, as the Sages were lenient with them.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rav Ashi said: What is</b> the meaning of: <b>So long as another does not see him, which</b> was the standard that <b>Isi bar Natan said? Sufficient that another person cannot see his nakedness, although he does see him.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara relates: <b>There was a particular eulogizer who went</b> to eulogize an important person <b>in the presence of Rav Naḥman.</b> Of the deceased, <b>he said: This</b> man <b>was modest in his ways. Rav Naḥman said to him: Did you go to the bathroom with him and know whether or not he was modest? As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One can only describe as modest one who is modest</b> even <b>in the bathroom,</b> when no one else is there.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And what difference</b> did it make <b>to Rav Naḥman,</b> that he was so insistent upon the details of whether or not this man was modest? The Gemara answers: <b>Because it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as the deceased are punished, so too are the eulogizers and those who answer after them.</b>The deceased are punished for transgressions committed in their lifetimes. The eulogizers and those who answer are punished for accepting the attribution of virtues that the deceased did not possess.

### Part 17
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Who is a modest person? One who defecates at night where he defecates during the day,</b> i.e., who distances himself at night, in order to relieve himself, no less than he distances himself during the day.

### Part 18
The Gemara challenges: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav said: One must always accustom himself</b> to defecate <b>in the morning and at night,</b> when it is dark, <b>so that he will not need to distance himself? Moreover, during the day, Rava would go up to a <i>mil</i></b> outside the city, <b>and at night he would tell his servant: Clear a place for me in the city street. And so too, Rabbi Zeira told his servant: See who is behind the study hall, as I need to defecate.</b> These Sages did not defecate at night in the same place where they defecated during the day. <b>Rather,</b> emend the statement and <b>say</b> as follows: <b>In the manner that one defecates during the day,</b> i.e. he should conduct himself at night with the same degree of modesty with which he removes his clothing when defecating during the day.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Ashi said: Even if you say</b> that the text can remain as it was: <b>Where he defecates during the day,</b> it <b>was only necessary in</b> the case of <b>a corner,</b> where one may conceal himself. In the interest of modesty, he should go around the corner at night, just as he does during the day.

### Part 20
The Gemara discusses <b>the matter itself. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: One must always accustom himself</b> to defecate early <b>in the morning and</b> late <b>at night so that he will not need to distance himself.</b>

### Part 21
<b>That</b> opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ben Azzai said: Rise early</b> in the morning <b>and go</b> defecate, wait for <b>evening and go</b> defecate, <b>so that you will not</b> need to <b>distance yourself.</b> He also said: <b>Touch</b> around the anus first to assist in the opening of orifices <b>and</b> then <b>sit; do not sit and</b> then <b>touch, for anyone who sits and</b> then <b>touches, even if sorcery is performed in</b> a distant place like <b>Aspamia,</b> the sorcery <b>will come upon him.</b>

### Part 22
The Gemara says: <b>And if one forgets and sits and then touches, what is his remedy? When</b> he <b>stands,</b> he should <b>recite the following</b> incantation: <b>Not for me, not for me, neither <i>taḥim</i> nor <i>taḥtim</i>,</b> types of sorcery, <b>neither these nor from these, neither the sorcery of a sorcerer nor the sorcery of a sorceress.</b>
