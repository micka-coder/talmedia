### Part 1
<b>while its inner side, and its rim,</b> the edge of the vessel that protrudes outwards, <b>and its</b> ear-shaped handle, <b>and its</b> straight <b>handles</b> are <b>pure.</b> However, if <b>the inside</b> of the vessel <b>became ritually impure, it is all ritually impure.</b>

### Part 2
Although the decrees of Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai are different, they are based on realistic contingencies and on concerns shared by both parties. The Gemara seeks to clarify: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> What is the crux of their dispute?

### Part 3
The Gemara explains: <b>Beit Shammai hold: It is prohibited to use a vessel the outer side of which has been rendered ritually impure by liquids.</b> This prohibition stems from <b>a decree</b> of the Sages, due to concern <b>for drips</b> of liquid that would fall from inside the vessel to its outer side, as those drips themselves would be rendered ritually impure by virtue of their contact with the outer side of the vessel. <b>And</b> Beit Shammai hold that <b>there is no</b> reason to <b>issue a decree</b> due to the concern of Beit Hillel <b>lest the liquid on one’s hands will be rendered ritually impure by the cup, as</b> Beit Shammai hold that the use of a vessel of that kind is prohibited.

### Part 4
<b>And Beit Hillel hold: One is permitted to use a vessel the outer side of which has been rendered ritually impure by liquid,</b> as they <b>say: Drips are uncommon,</b> and decrees are not issued on the basis of an uncommon case. Because Beit Hillel permit the use of a vessel of that kind, <b>there is concern lest the liquid on one’s hands will be rendered ritually impure due to the cup.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Alternatively,</b> Beit Hillel hold that one mixes the water with the wine in the cup and then washes his hands due to the principle: <b>Immediately</b> after <b>the washing of the hands</b> comes <b>the meal.</b> Therefore, he mixes the water and wine in the cup, then he washes his hands, and then he immediately proceeds to the meal.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the point of Beit Hillel adding: <b>Alternatively?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai as follows:</b> Even <b>according to you, who said</b> that <b>it is prohibited to use a vessel the outer side of which is ritually impure as we issued a decree due to</b> concern for <b>drips, even so,</b> our opinion <b>is preferable</b> to yours, <b>as</b> our opinion adheres to the principle: <b>Immediately</b> after <b>the washing of the hands</b> comes <b>the meal.</b>

### Part 7
We learned in the mishna that Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai disagree over where the cloth that one used to dry his hands should be placed. <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> After washing, <b>one dries</b> his hands with a cloth and places it on the table. And Beit Hillel say: One places it on the cushion upon which he is sitting.

### Part 8
In a <i>Tosefta</i>, <b>the Sages taught</b> in greater detail: <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> After washing, <b>one dries his hands with a cloth and places it on the table, as if you say</b> that he should place the cloth <b>on the cushion,</b> there is room to issue a <b>decree lest the liquids on the cloth,</b> which is wet because he used it to dry his hands, <b>become ritually impure due to</b> their contact <b>with the cushion, and</b> the liquids <b>would in turn render the hands</b> of anyone who touches the towel <b>ritually impure.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: Even without the liquid, <b>let the cushion render the towel ritually impure</b> directly? The Gemara answers: There is a principle: <b>A vessel does not render</b> another <b>vessel ritually impure.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Let the cushion render the man</b> sitting upon it <b>ritually impure.</b> The Gemara answers: There, too, there is a general principle: <b>A vessel does not render a person ritually impure.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> One places it <b>on the cushion</b> upon which he is sitting, <b>as if you say</b> that he should place it <b>on the table,</b> there is room to issue a <b>decree lest the liquids on the towel might be rendered ritually impure</b> by their contact <b>with the table,</b> and those liquids <b>in turn will render the food</b> placed on the table <b>ritually impure.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>Let the table render the food upon it ritually impure</b> directly. The Gemara explains: <b>Here we are dealing with a table</b> that has <b>second</b> degree ritual impurity status, and an object of <b>second</b> degree ritual impurity status <b>can only confer third</b> degree ritual impurity status <b>upon non-sacred items by means of liquids.</b> By rabbinic decree, liquids that come into contact with second degree ritual impurity assume first degree ritual impurity status and, consequently, can render non-sacred items impure.

### Part 13
The Gemara seeks to clarify: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: The basis of their dispute is that <b>Beit Shammai hold: It is prohibited to use a table</b> that has <b>second</b> degree ritual impurity status for purposes of eating because of <b>a decree due to those who eat <i>teruma</i>.</b> A table with that status renders <i>teruma</i> ritually impure through contact. To prevent priests who partake of <i>teruma</i> from unwittingly eating off a table of that sort, a decree was issued prohibiting its use even with non-sacred foods.

### Part 14
<b>And Beit Hillel hold: It is permitted to use a table</b> that has <b>second</b> degree ritual impurity status, and we are not concerned about the priests. As <b>those who eat <i>teruma</i> are vigilant</b> and would ascertain the status of a table before eating.

### Part 15
<b>Alternatively,</b> Beit Hillel hold that <b>there is no</b> requirement of <b>washing of the hands for non-sacred items by Torah law.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the point of Beit Hillel adding the additional reason introduced with: <b>Alternatively?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai as follows: And if you say, what is the difference with regard to food that we are concerned</b> that it might be rendered ritually impure by the cloth on the table; <b>and what is the difference with regard to hands that we are not concerned</b> that they might be rendered ritually impure by the cloth placed on the cushion? Beit Hillel continue: We can respond that <b>even so, this is preferable,</b> as <b>there is no</b> requirement of <b>washing of the hands for non-sacred items by Torah law. It is preferable that hands,</b> whose impurity <b>has no basis in Torah law, will become ritually impure</b> with second degree ritual impurity status, <b>and food,</b> whose impurity <b>has a basis in Torah law, will not become ritually impure.</b>

### Part 17
We learned in the mishna that Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai disagree over whether cleaning the place where one ate or washing one’s hands should be performed first after the meal. <b>Beit Shammai say: One sweeps the</b> area of the <b>house</b> where the meal took place <b>and he washes his hands</b> with the final waters <b>thereafter. And Beit Hillel say: One washes his hands and sweeps the house thereafter.</b>

### Part 18
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i> where this issue is discussed in greater detail: <b>Beit Shammai say: One sweeps the</b> area of the <b>house</b> where the meal took place <b>and washes his hands thereafter, as if you say that one washes his hands first,</b> the water is liable to splash on the remaining crumbs and <b>you will have ruined the food. But Beit Shammai do not hold that the washing of the hands is first. What is the reason? Due to</b> concern, lest the <b>crumbs</b> will be made disgusting.

### Part 19
<b>And Beit Hillel say: If the attendant is a Torah scholar,</b> he <b>removes the crumbs that are an olive-bulk</b> from the table at the end of the meal <b>and leaves</b> only <b>crumbs that are not an olive-bulk,</b> as food that is less than an olive-bulk is not considered food and there is no prohibition to ruin it.

### Part 20
This <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Crumbs that are less than an olive-bulk</b> in size, <b>one may destroy them with his hand</b> without violating the prohibition against ruining food.

### Part 21
Here too the Gemara poses the question: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: The basis of their argument is that <b>Beit Hillel hold: One is forbidden to use</b> the services of <b>a waiter</b> who is an <b><i>am ha’aretz</i>.</b> Therefore, there is no room for concern that food will be ruined as only crumbs remain on the table. <b>And Beit Shammai hold: One is permitted to use</b> the services of <b>an attendant</b> who is an <b><i>am ha’aretz</i>.</b> Food will remain on the table and, therefore, there is room for concern that food will be ruined. The solution is to clean the food off the table and only then wash one’s hands.

### Part 22
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: In our entire chapter, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, except for this</b> case, <b>where the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai. And Rabbi Oshaya would teach the opposite</b> and reverse the opinions of Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai as they appear in our mishna, <b>and in this</b> case <b>as well, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel.</b>

### Part 23
We learned in the mishna that <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> One recites the blessing over the <b>candle,</b> then the Grace after <b>Meals</b> blessing, then the blessing over the spices, and finally the blessing of <i>havdala</i>. And Beit Hillel say: The order is candle, spices, Grace after Meals, and <i>havdala</i>.

### Part 24
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda happened</b> to come <b>to Rava’s house. He saw that Rava recited a blessing over the spices first.</b> Rav Huna bar Yehuda <b>said to him: Now since Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai do not disagree with regard to</b> the blessing over <b>light, as we learned</b> in our mishna that <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> One recites the blessing over the <b>candle,</b> then the Grace after <b>Meals</b> blessing, then the blessing over the <b>spices,</b> and finally the blessing of <b><i>havdala</i>. And Beit Hillel say:</b> The order is <b>candle, and spices,</b> Grace after <b>Meals, and <i>havdala</i>,</b> why did you recite the blessing over the spices first?

### Part 25
<b>Rava answered after him:</b> Indeed, <b>that is the statement of Rabbi Meir. However, Rabbi Yehuda says in</b> a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai neither disagree with regard to</b> Grace after <b>Meals that it is</b> recited <b>first, nor with regard to <i>havdala</i>, which is</b> recited <b>last. With regard to what do they disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to the light and the spices. Beit Shammai say:</b> One recites a blessing <b>over light and over spices thereafter, and Beit Hillel say:</b> One recites a blessing <b>over spices and over light thereafter.</b>

### Part 26
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The people were accustomed</b> to conduct themselves <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel according to</b> the interpretation of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The blessing over the spices is recited first.

### Part 27
The mishna cited a dispute between Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai with regard to the formula of the blessing over fire in <i>havdala</i>. <b>Beit Shammai say: Who created [<i>bara</i>]</b> the light of fire. And Beit Hillel say: Who creates [<i>boreh</i>] the lights of fire.

### Part 28
Regarding this, Rava says: <b>With regard to</b> the word <b><i>bara</i>, everyone agrees that it means created</b> in the past. <b>Where they disagree is with regard to</b> the word <b><i>boreh</i>. Beit Shammai hold: <i>Boreh</i></b> means that God <b>will create in the future, and Beit Hillel hold: <i>Boreh</i> also means that He has created</b> in the past.

### Part 29
<b>Rav Yosef raised an objection:</b> How can there be a dispute over the meaning of the word <i>boreh</i>? In the following verses it is clear that it refers to acts of creation in the past: <b>“Who forms light and creates [<i>boreh</i>] darkness”</b> (Isaiah 45:7), <b>“Who forms mountains and creates [<i>boreh</i>] wind”</b> (Amos 4:13), or <b>“Who creates [<i>boreh</i>] the heavens and stretches them out”</b> (Isaiah 42:5). <b>Rather, said Rav Yosef: With regard to both <i>bara</i> and <i>boreh</i>, everyone agrees that</b> they <b>mean created. Where they disagree is with regard to the light</b> of the fire or <b>the lights</b> of the fire. <b>As Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>there is one light in a fire, and Beit Hillel hold</b> that <b>there are many lights in a fire,</b> as a flame consists of red, green, and white light. <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: There are many lights in the fire.</b>

### Part 30
We learned in the mishna that <b>one may neither recite a blessing</b> over the candle nor over the spices of gentiles. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the prohibition against the recitation of a blessing over <b>a candle</b> of gentiles in <i>havdala</i>, <b>as</b> the flame of the candle <b>did not rest.</b> Because it was burning during Shabbat, one should not recite a blessing over it at the conclusion of Shabbat. <b>However, what is the reason that</b> one may <b>not</b> recite a blessing over <b>spices</b> of gentiles?

### Part 31
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Here we are dealing with a party</b> arranged by <b>gentiles</b> and the spices used at that party were prohibited because <b>the parties of gentiles are generally</b> devoted <b>to idolatry.</b>

### Part 32
The Gemara asks: <b>But from that which was taught in the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>One may neither recite a blessing over the candle nor over the spices of idolatry,</b> infer <b>by implication that</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of our mishna <b>we are not dealing with idolatry?</b> There must be a different reason why the spices of gentiles are prohibited.

### Part 33
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina of Sura said:</b> These two <i>halakhot</i> are complementary, and the mishna <b>states</b> the <i>halakha</i> employing the style of: <b>What is the reason.</b> The mishna should be understood as follows: <b>What is the reason that one may neither recite a blessing over the candle nor over the spices of gentiles? Because the parties of gentiles are generally</b> devoted <b>to idolatry</b> and one may neither recite a blessing over the candle nor over the spices of idolatry.

### Part 34
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Over fire that rested, one may recite a blessing</b> in <i>havdala</i>, <b>and over</b> fire <b>that did not rest, one may not recite a blessing.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by <b>rested, and what is</b> meant by <b>did not rest?</b>ב
