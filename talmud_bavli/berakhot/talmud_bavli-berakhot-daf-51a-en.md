### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to a</b> food <b>item that does not become disgusting as well, let him shift it to the side and recite the blessing.</b> Why need he spit it out? <b>Rav Yitzḥak Kaskesa’a explained before Rabbi Yosei bar Avin, in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> One spits it out <b>because it is stated: “My mouth will be filled with Your praise”</b> (Psalms 71:8), meaning that one should recite God’s praises with his entire mouth, not merely half.

### Part 2
<b>They raised a dilemma before Rav Ḥisda: One who ate and drank and did not recite a blessing, what is</b> the ruling? Does he <b>return and recite</b> the blessing that he should have recited beforehand before he continues eating or not? In response, Rav Ḥisda <b>said to them</b> an analogy: Should <b>one who ate garlic and the odor</b> on <b>his</b> breath <b>smells return and eat another garlic so that the odor</b> on <b>his</b> breath <b>will smell?</b> That is to say, one must recite a blessing. Should one who committed a transgression and failed to recite a blessing before eating, remedy his situation by continuing to eat without reciting a blessing (<i>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yona</i>)?

### Part 3
<b>Ravina said: Therefore, even if one finished his meal, he must return and recite a blessing.</b> He cites a proof, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the laws of immersion: <b>One</b> who was ritually impure <b>who immersed</b> himself in a ritual bath <b>and emerged, as he emerges he recites: Blessed…Who has made us holy through His mitzvot and has commanded us about ritual immersion.</b> Evidently, in certain cases, one may recite the blessing after completing the act.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects the parallel between the cases: <b>That is not so,</b> as <b>there,</b> in the case of immersion, <b>initially,</b> before he immersed himself, <b>the man was unfit</b> to recite the blessing because he was ritually impure; <b>here,</b> in the case where one did not recite a blessing before eating, <b>initially he was fit</b> to recite the blessing, <b>and since</b> he did not recite the blessing before he ate and he concluded his meal <b>and is, therefore, excluded</b> from reciting the blessing, he is completely <b>excluded</b> and has no way to remedy the situation.

### Part 5
Tangential to the laws concerning wine that the Gemara cited earlier, <b>the Sages taught: <i>Asparagus</i>,</b> wine or other alcoholic beverages that they were accustomed to drink early in the morning before eating, <b>is agreeable for the heart and beneficial for the eyes, and all the more so for the intestines. And</b> in extolling the virtues of this drink, the Gemara says: <b>One who is accustomed to</b> drink it, <b>it is agreeable for his entire body.</b> However, one must be careful, as <b>one who</b> drinks excessively and <b>becomes drunk, it is harmful for his entire body.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara discusses this: <b>From the fact that it was taught</b> that <i>asparagus</i> is <b>agreeable for the heart,</b> it may be inferred that <b>we are dealing with</b> <i>asparagus</i> made from <b>wine,</b> which is known to be agreeable for the heart. <b>And we learned: And all the more so,</b> <i>asparagus</i> is <b>beneficial for the intestines. Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For <i>L-E-T</i>,</b> which is an acronym for <i>lev</i>, heart; <i>einayim</i>, eyes; <i>teḥol</i>, spleen, <b>it is beneficial,</b> but <b>for <i>R-M-T</i>,</b> <i>rosh</i>, head; <i>me’ayim</i>, intestines; <i>taḥtoniot</i>, hemorrhoids, <b>it is harmful.</b> Apparently, <i>asparagus</i> is harmful for one’s intestines.

### Part 7
The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, in which <b>it was taught</b> that <i>asparagus</i> is beneficial to one’s intestines, refers to <i>asparagus</i> made <b>with old</b> wine. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna concerning the laws of vows that one who vowed: <b>Wine is <i>konam</i> for me to taste because it is harmful to the intestines, and</b> those who heard him <b>said to him: But isn’t old</b> wine <b>beneficial to the intestines? If he was silent</b> and did not argue the point, he is <b>forbidden</b> to drink <b>new</b> wine because of his vow, <b>but he is permitted</b> to drink <b>old</b> wine. <b>Conclude from this</b> that old wine is beneficial for the intestines.

### Part 8
<b>The Sages taught: Six things were said with regard to <i>asparagus</i>: One only drinks it undiluted and</b> from a <b>full</b> cup; <b>he receives it</b> from the attendant <b>in</b> his <b>right</b> hand <b>and drinks it with</b> his <b>left</b> hand; <b>one should not converse after</b> drinking it <b>and one does not stop</b> while drinking <b>it,</b> but should drink it all at once; <b>one only returns it to</b> the one <b>who gave it to him; and he spits after</b> drinking <b>it; and one may only supplement it with its own kind,</b> meaning that after drinking <i>asparagus</i>, one should only eat something that is used to make similar beverages, e.g., dates after date beer, etc.

### Part 9
The Gemara challenges: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>one may only supplement</b> <i>asparagus</i> <b>with bread?</b> The Gemara responds: That is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i><b>,</b> in which it was taught that one supplements it with bread, refers to <i>asparagus</i> made <b>of wine,</b> while <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i><b>,</b> in which it was taught that one supplements it with its own kind, refers to <i>asparagus</i> made <b>of beer.</b>

### Part 10
<b>It was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that <i>asparagus</i> <b>is beneficial for <i>L-E-T</i>,</b> heart, eyes, and spleen, <b>and harmful for <i>R-M-T</i>,</b> head, intestines, and hemorrhoids. <b>And it was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <i>asparagus</i> <b>is beneficial for <i>R-M-T</i>,</b> head, intestines, and hemorrhoids, <b>and harmful for <i>L-E-T</i>,</b> heart, eyes, and spleen. The Gemara responds: That is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita,</i> in which it was taught that <i>asparagus</i> is beneficial for <i>L-E-T</i>, refers to <i>asparagus</i> made <b>of wine,</b> while <b>that</b> <i>baraita,</i> in which it was taught that <i>asparagus</i> is harmful for <i>L-E-T</i>, refers to <i>asparagus</i> made <b>of beer.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara resolves a contradiction between two other <i>baraitot</i> in the same manner. <b>It was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>if he spit after</b> drinking <i>asparagus</i>, he <b>suffers</b> an illness. <b>And it was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>if he did not spit after</b> drinking <i>asparagus</i>, he <b>suffers</b> an illness. The Gemara responds: That is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita,</i> in which it was taught that if he spit after drinking it he <b>suffers</b> an illness, refers to <i>asparagus</i> made <b>of wine,</b> while <b>that</b> <i>baraita,</i> in which it was taught that if he did not spit he suffers an illness, refers to <i>asparagus</i> made <b>of beer.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Ashi said: Now</b> that <b>you said</b> that <b>if he did not spit after</b> drinking it he <b>suffers</b> an illness, <b>its water,</b> the saliva in his mouth after drinking <i>asparagus</i><b>,</b> may be expelled <b>even</b> when standing <b>before the king,</b> as failure to do so will endanger him.

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Yishmael ben Elisha said: Suriel, the</b> heavenly <b>ministering</b> angel <b>of the Divine Presence, told me three things</b> from on high: <b>Do not take your cloak in the morning from the hand of your servant and wear it; do not</b> ritually <b>wash your hands from one who has not</b> ritually <b>washed his</b> own <b>hands; and only return a cup of <i>asparagus</i> to</b> the one <b>who gave it to you.</b> Why is this? <b>Because a band of demons and some say a band of angels of destruction</b> lie in <b>wait for a person and say: When will a person encounter one of these circumstances and be captured?</b>

### Part 14
Similarly, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The Angel of Death told me three things: Do not take your cloak in the morning from the hand of your servant and wear it; do not</b> ritually <b>wash your hands from one who has not</b> ritually <b>washed his</b> own <b>hands; and do not stand before the women when they return from</b> the burial of <b>the deceased, because I dance and come before them and my sword is in hand, and I have license to destroy.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And if one encounters</b> women returning from a funeral, <b>what is his remedy?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Let him jump four cubits from where he stands; if there is a river, let him cross it; if there is another path, let him go down it; if there is a wall, let him stand behind it; and if not, he should turn his face around and recite</b> the verse: <b>“And the Lord said to the Satan: The Lord rebukes you,</b> Satan, the Lord that has chosen Jerusalem rebukes you; is not this man a brand plucked from the fire?” (Zechariah 3:2), <b>until they pass him.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu said, and some say that this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: Ten things were said with regard to a cup of blessing,</b> e.g., the cup of wine over which Grace after Meals is recited: <b>It requires rinsing and washing;</b> it must be <b>undiluted</b> wine, <b>and full;</b> it requires <b>adorning and wrapping; he takes it in his two hands and places it in his right</b> hand, <b>and he lifts it</b> at least <b>one handbreadth from the ground, and</b> when reciting the blessing <b>he fixes his eyes upon it. And some say: He also sends it as a gift to members of his household.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: We only have four</b> of those ten things: <b>Rinsing, washing,</b> the wine must be <b>undiluted, and</b> the cup must be <b>full.</b> In explanation, <b>it was taught: Rinsing is from the inside</b> of the cup, <b>and washing is from the outside</b> of the cup.

### Part 18
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who recites a blessing over a full cup, they give him a boundless inheritance, as it is stated: “And full of the blessing of the Lord, possess the sea and the south”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:23), indicating that one whose cup is full will receive God’s blessing and will inherit from all sides. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: He merits and inherits two worlds, this world and the World-to-Come.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara continues explaining the ten things said with regard to the cup of blessing: The Sages would <b>adorn</b> the cup of blessing in different ways. <b>Rav Yehuda</b> would <b>adorn it with students,</b> as when he recited the blessing he would surround himself with students to accord honor to the blessing. <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> however, would <b>adorn it with</b> other <b>cups;</b> he would surround the cup of blessing with other cups. <b>Rabbi Ḥanan said: And</b> specifically <b>with undiluted</b> wine. <b>Rav Sheshet said: And in the blessing of the land.</b>

### Part 20
The Sages also had different customs with regard to <b>wrapping. Rav Pappa</b> would <b>wrap</b> himself in his prayer shawl <b>and sit</b> and recite Grace after Meals. <b>Rav Asi spread a cloth on his head</b> as an sign of respect.

### Part 21
With regard to what was said that <b>he takes it in his two hands, Rabbi Ḥinnana bar Pappa said: What is the verse</b> that proves this? As it is stated: <b>“Lift your hands in holiness and bless the Lord”</b> (Psalms 134:2).

### Part 22
As for what was said after he takes it in his two hands: <b>And he places it in his right</b> hand, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The early</b> Sages <b>asked: What is</b> the ruling, may <b>the left</b> hand <b>assist the right</b> when taking the cup? <b>Rav Ashi said: Since the early</b> Sages <b>raised this dilemma and it was not resolved for them,</b>
