### Part 1
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara begins by clarifying the rationale for Beit Shammai’s opinion. <b>Granted, Beit Hillel explain the rationale</b> for <b>their</b> opinion <b>and the rationale for Beit Shammai’s</b> opinion<b>.</b> Beit Hillel explain both the verse that ostensibly supports Beit Shammai’s opinion: When you lie down<b>,</b> at the time when people lie down<b>,</b> etc<b>.,</b> and the verse that proves that their own explanation is more reasonable: “And when you walk along the way.” <b>However, what is the reason that Beit Shammai do not state</b> their opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel?</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara answers, <b>Beit Shammai</b> could <b>have said to you: If so</b> that the verse means only to denote the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, as claimed by Beit Hillel, <b>then let the verse say: “In the morning and in the evening.” What</b> is the meaning of the ambiguous formulation: <b>“When you lie down, and when you rise”?</b> It must mean that <b>at the time of lying down</b> one must recite <i>Shema</i> while <b>actually lying down, and at the time of arising</b> one must recite <i>Shema</i> while <b>actually risen.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara continues, asking: <b>And what do Beit Shammai do with this</b> verse: <b>“And when you walk along the way,”</b> which Beit Hillel use to prove that every person recites <i>Shema</i> as he is?

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: Beit Shammai <b>need this</b> verse in order to derive other <i>halakhot</i>, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> which interpreted this verse that the obligation to recite <i>Shema</i> applies <b>when you sit in your home, to the exclusion of one who is engaged in</b> performance of <b>a mitzva,</b> who is exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i>; <b>and when you walk along the way, to the exclusion of a groom,</b> who is also exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. The <i>baraita</i> adds that <b>from here,</b> from this interpretation of the verses, <b>they said: One who marries a virgin is exempt</b> from the recitation of <i>Shema</i> on his wedding night, <b>but one who marries a widow is obligated.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara clarifies the meaning of this <i>baraita</i>, and asks: <b>From where may it be inferred</b> that the verse, when you walk along the way, exempts a groom from the obligation to recite <i>Shema</i>?

### Part 6
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that we learn: <b>Like the way; just as</b> the journey along a specific <b>way</b> described in the verse <b>is voluntary</b> and involves no mitzva, <b>so too all</b> of those who are obligated to recite <i>Shema</i> are engaged in <b>voluntary</b> activities. However, one engaged in the performance of a mitzva, like a groom, is exempt from the obligation to recite <i>Shema</i>.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Are we not dealing with</b> a case where <b>one walks</b> along the way <b>to perform a mitzva?</b> The Torah did not designate the objective of his walk and, <b>nevertheless, the Torah said to recite</b> <i>Shema</i>, indicating that one is obligated even if he set out to perform a mitzva. Rather, the proof is from the formulation of the verse. <b>If so,</b> that the intention was to obligate in all cases, <b>let the Torah write: When sitting and when walking. What is</b> the meaning of: <b>When you sit and when you walk?</b> Certainly these additions come to emphasize <b>in your sitting down and in your walking,</b> meaning that when one does this for his own purposes and of his own volition, <b>he is obligated</b> to recite <i>Shema</i>, <b>but</b> when he does with the objective of performing <b>a mitzva, he is exempt</b> from reciting <i>Shema</i>, as in that case he is sitting or walking at God’s behest.

### Part 8
The conclusion is that anyone engaged in the performance of a mitzva is exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. <b>If so, even one who marries a widow should be</b> exempt, for he, too, is engaged in performance of a mitzva. That, however, contradicts the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 9
The Gemara responds that there is nevertheless a distinction between one marrying a virgin and one marrying a widow. <b>One</b> who marries a virgin <b>is preoccupied</b> by his concern lest he discover that his bride is not a virgin, while <b>one</b> who marries a widow <b>is not preoccupied.</b> The conclusion is that the groom is exempt from reciting <i>Shema</i> because he is preoccupied.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the exemption is <b>due to preoccupation,</b> then <b>even one</b> who is preoccupied because <b>his ship sank at sea</b> should <b>also</b> be exempt. The Gemara reinforces its question: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>in this case as well,</b> when one’s ship sank at sea, one is exempt, <b>why</b> then <b>did Rabbi Abba bar Zavda say</b> that <b>Rav said: A mourner is obligated in all the mitzvot mentioned in the Torah except for</b> the mitzva to don <b>phylacteries,</b> from which a mourner is exempt, <b>as</b> the term <b>splendor is stated</b> with regard to phylacteries, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Make no mourning for the dead, <b>bind your splendor upon yourself”</b> (Ezekiel 24:17). It is inappropriate for a mourner to wrap himself in phylacteries, with regard to which, the term splendor was employed (<i>Tosafot</i>). If a mourner, who is clearly pained and preoccupied, is obligated to recite <i>Shema</i>, then certainly all others who are preoccupied, even one whose ship sank at sea, whose loss was merely monetary (<i>Birkat Hashem</i>), should be obligated. Why, then, is a groom exempted because of his preoccupation and one who lost his property is not?

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, there is a distinction between the cases. For <b>there,</b> in the case of a groom, <b>he is preoccupied with the preoccupation of a mitzva</b> that he must perform; <b>here,</b> in the case of a ship lost at sea, <b>he is preoccupied with the preoccupation of a voluntary</b> act that he chooses to perform.

### Part 12
Here, the Gemara returns to its initial question: <b>And</b> how do <b>Beit Shammai</b> explain the passage: “When you walk along the way” (Rashash)?

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: Beit Shammai <b>need this</b> passage in order to <b>exclude one who is on the path</b> to perform <b>a mitzva</b> from the obligation to recite <i>Shema</i>.

### Part 14
Beit Hillel also agree that one engaged in the performance of a mitzva is exempt from reciting <i>Shema</i>? If so, the <i>halakha</i> that they derived from: When you walk along the way lacks a source and is therefore unfounded. <b>And Beit Hillel say: Derive from this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>itself</b> that one who is not an agent in the performance of a mitzva <b>recites</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>even along the way.</b>

### Part 15
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> One may recite <i>Shema</i> in any situation: <b>Standing and reciting, sitting and reciting, reclining and reciting, walking and reciting</b> and even <b>working and reciting. And</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>an incident</b> is related where two <i>tanna’im</i>, <b>Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya,</b> who were both disciples of Beit Hillel, <b>were reclining</b> at a meal <b>in one place</b> together with their students, <b>and Rabbi Yishmael was reclined</b> as was the customary dining position, <b>and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya was upright. When the time to recite</b> the evening <b><i>Shema</i> arrived, Rabbi Elazar reclined</b> to recite <i>Shema</i> in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai, <b>while Rabbi Yishmael</b> sat <b>upright</b> to recite <i>Shema</i>. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya</b> appeared to take offense, and <b>said to Rabbi Yishmael: Yishmael, my brother, I will tell you a parable to which this is similar. It is comparable to</b> a situation where <b>one to whom people say</b> as a compliment: <b>Your beard is full</b> and suits you. That man <b>says to them: May it be against those who</b> shave and <b>destroy</b> their beards, i.e., the only reason I grow my beard is to irritate those who cut their own (Rashba). <b>You are the same. As long as I am upright, you are reclined, and now when I reclined</b> lauding your conduct and emulating you, <b>you</b> sat <b>upright</b> as if to demonstrate that whatever I do, you do the opposite.

### Part 16
Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: I acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel,</b> according to whom one may recite <i>Shema</i> in any position, <b>while you acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai.</b> I am the one who acted in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>. <b>And furthermore,</b> I was concerned <b>lest the students see</b> your conduct <b>and establish the <i>halakha</i> for generations</b> accordingly. It was therefore necessary for me to demonstrate that there is no obligation to do so.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>And furthermore?</b> Why was it necessary for Rabbi Yishmael to add additional justification for his actions when the reason that he acted in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel was sufficient?

### Part 18
The Gemara answers: It was necessary for him to add this reason, as <b>if you say: Beit Hillel also hold</b> that one is permitted to recite <i>Shema</i> while <b>reclining</b> and Rabbi Yishmael could have remained reclining even in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel, but <b>this only applies when one had already been reclining originally,</b> in which case it is like any other position. <b>However, here, since until now he had been upright, and now he is reclined,</b> the students <b>will say: Conclude from this, that they hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai.</b> Due to the concern that <b>the students might see and establish the <i>halakha</i> for generations</b> in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai, it was necessary for Rabbi Yishmael to sit upright.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Yeḥezkel taught: One who acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai</b> has <b>acted</b> appropriately and is not in violation of the <i>halakha</i>. One who acted <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel acted</b> appropriately as well. According to this opinion, Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai agree that one who acted in accordance with the opinion of the other fulfilled his obligation. Although the <i>halakha</i> was ruled in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel, Beit Hillel would agree that one who acted in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai fulfilled his obligation.

### Part 20
However, <b>Rav Yosef said: One who acts in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai has done nothing</b> and must repeat <i>Shema</i> in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel, <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of a <i>sukka</i>: <b>One who had his head and most of his</b> body <b>in the <i>sukka</i>, and his table</b> upon which he was eating <b>inside the house, Beit Shammai invalidate</b> his action, as he is liable to be drawn after the table and end up eating outside the <i>sukka</i>. <b>And Beit Hillel validate</b> his action, since his head and most of his body remain inside the <i>sukka</i>.

### Part 21
<b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai</b> as a proof: <b>There was an incident where the elders of Beit Shammai and the elders of Beit Hillel went</b> on <i>Sukkot</i> <b>to visit Rabbi Yoḥanan ben HaḤoranit. They found him with his head and most of his</b> body <b>in the <i>sukka</i> and his table inside the house and they said nothing to him.</b> In other words, even Beit Shammai did not object.

### Part 22
Beit Shammai <b>said to them: And</b> is there <b>proof from there?</b> That is not what happened, rather <b>they said to him</b> explicitly: <b>If you have been</b> accustomed to <b>act in this manner, you have never in your life fulfilled the mitzva of <i>sukka</i>.</b> We see that Beit Shammai held that anyone who did not act in accordance with their opinion, did not fulfill his obligation at all. Similarly, since Beit Hillel’s opinion was accepted as <i>halakha</i>, anyone who acts in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai fails to fulfill his obligation.

### Part 23
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak stated</b> an even more extreme opinion: <b>One who acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai</b> has acted so egregiously that he <b>is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty, <b>as we learned</b> in our mishna that <b>Rabbi Tarfon said</b> to his colleagues: Once, <b>I was coming on the road</b> when I stopped and <b>reclined to recite</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai.</b> Yet in so doing, <b>I endangered myself due to the highwaymen</b> who accost travelers. The Sages <b>said to him: You deserved</b> to be in a position where you were <b>liable</b> to pay <b>with your life, as you transgressed the statement of Beit Hillel.</b>

### Part 24
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> From the laws of the recitation of <i>Shema</i> itself, the mishna proceeds to discuss the blessings recited in conjunction with <i>Shema</i>. Here, the order is established: <b>In</b> the <b>morning</b> when reciting <i>Shema</i>, <b>one recites two blessings beforehand,</b> the first on the radiant lights and the second the blessing on the love of Torah, <b>and one thereafter,</b> which begins with: True and Firm [<i>emet veyatziv</i>]. <b>And in the evening one recites two blessings beforehand,</b> on the radiant lights and on the love of God, <b>and two thereafter,</b> the blessing of redemption: True and Faithful [<i>emet ve’emuna</i>], and the blessing: Help us lie down. With regard to the blessing: True and Faithful, <b>whether</b> one recites it in its <b>long</b> formula <b>and whether</b> one recites it in its <b>short</b> formula, he fulfills his obligation (<i>Tosafot</i>).

### Part 25
However, the general principle is: <b>Where</b> the Sages <b>said</b> to recite <b>a long</b> blessing, <b>one may not shorten it,</b> and so too, wherever they said to recite <b>a short</b> blessing, <b>one may not lengthen it.</b> Where the Sages said that a blessing <b>must conclude</b> with a second blessing at the end, <b>he may not fail to conclude</b> with that blessing. Similarly, if the Sages said that a blessing must <b>not conclude</b> with a second blessing, <b>one may not conclude</b> with a blessing.

### Part 26
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara begins by determining the formula of the two blessings preceding the morning <i>Shema</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>What blessing does one recite?</b>

### Part 27
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov said in the name of Rabbi Oshaya:</b> The blessing focuses on the verse:
