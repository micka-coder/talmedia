### Part 1
On a similar note, the Gemara relates that the Roman <b>emperor said to Rabbi Yehoshua, son of Rabbi Ḥananya: You</b> Jews <b>say that you are extremely wise.</b> If that is so, <b>tell me what I will see in my dream.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: You will see the Persians capture you, and enslave you, and force you to herd unclean animals with a golden staff. He thought the entire day</b> about the images described to him by Rabbi Yehoshua <b>and that night he saw</b> it in his dream. <b>King Shapur</b> of Persia <b>said to Shmuel: You</b> Jews <b>say that you are extremely wise.</b> If that is so, <b>tell me what I will see in my dream. Shmuel said to him: You will see the Romans come and take you into captivity</b> and force you <b>to grind date pits in mills of gold. He thought the entire day</b> about the images described to him by Shmuel, <b>and that night he saw</b> it in his dream.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: <b>Bar Haddaya was an interpreter of dreams.</b> For <b>one who gave him a fee, he would interpret</b> the dream <b>favorably, and</b> for <b>one who did not give him a fee, he would interpret</b> the dream <b>unfavorably.</b> The Gemara relates: There was an incident in which both <b>Abaye and Rava saw an</b> identical <b>dream</b> and they asked bar Haddaya to interpret it. <b>Abaye gave him money</b> and paid his fee, <b>while Rava did not give him</b> money. <b>They said to him:</b> The verse: <b>“Your ox shall be slain before your eyes</b> and you shall not eat thereof” (Deuteronomy 28:31) <b>was read to us in our dream. He</b> interpreted their dream and <b>to Rava he said: Your business will be lost and you will derive no pleasure from eating because of the</b> extreme <b>sadness of your heart. To Abaye he said: Your business will profit and you will be unable to eat due to the joy in your heart.</b>

### Part 3
<b>They said to him:</b> The verse, <b>“You shall beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours; for they shall go into captivity”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:41), <b>was read to us</b> in our dream. He interpreted their dreams, and <b>to Rava he said its</b> literal, <b>adverse</b> sense. <b>To Abaye he said: Your sons and daughters will be numerous, and your daughters will be married to outsiders and it will seem to you as if they were taken in captivity.</b>

### Part 4
They said to him: <b>The verse: “Your sons and your daughters shall be given unto another people”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:32), <b>was read to us</b> in our dream. <b>To Abaye he said: Your sons and daughters will be numerous. You say,</b> that they should marry <b>your relatives and</b> your wife <b>says</b> that they should marry <b>her relatives and she will impose</b> her will <b>upon you and they will be given</b> in marriage <b>to her relatives, which is like another nation</b> as far as you are concerned. <b>To Rava he said: Your wife will die and your sons and daughters will come into the hands of another woman. As Rava said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written</b> in the verse: <b>“Your sons and your daughters shall be given unto another people”? This</b> refers to <b>the father’s wife,</b> the stepmother.

### Part 5
They said to him: The verse: <b>“Go your way, eat your bread with joy,</b> and drink your wine with a merry heart” (Ecclesiastes 9:7) <b>was read to us in our dream. To Abaye he said: Your business will profit and you will eat and drink and read the verse out of the joy of your heart. To Rava he said: Your business will be lost, you will slaughter but not eat, you will drink</b> wine and <b>read</b> passages from the Bible in order <b>to allay your fears.</b>

### Part 6
They said to him: The verse: <b>“You shall carry much seed out into the field,</b> and shall gather little in; for the locust shall consume it” (Deuteronomy 28:38), <b>was read to us</b> in our dream. <b>To Abaye he said from the beginning</b> of the verse, that he will enjoy an abundant harvest. <b>To Rava he said from the end</b> of the verse, that his harvest will be destroyed.

### Part 7
They said to him: The verse: <b>“You shall have olive-trees throughout all your borders,</b> but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olives shall drop off” (Deuteronomy 28:40), <b>was read to us</b> in our dream. And again, <b>to Abaye he said from the beginning</b> of the verse. <b>To Rava he said from the end</b> of the verse.

### Part 8
They said to him: The verse: <b>“All the peoples of the earth shall see</b> that the name of the Lord is called upon you; and they shall be afraid of you” (Deuteronomy 28:10), <b>was read to us</b> in our dream. <b>To Abaye he said: Your name will become well-known as head of the yeshiva, and you will be feared by all. To Rava he said: The king’s treasury was broken</b> into <b>and you will be apprehended as a thief, and everyone will draw an <i>a fortiori</i> inference from you:</b> If Rava who is wealthy and of distinguished lineage can be arrested on charges of theft, what will become of the rest of us? Indeed, <b>the next day, the king’s treasury was burglarized, and they came and apprehended Rava.</b>

### Part 9
Abaye and Rava <b>said to him: We saw lettuce on the mouth of the barrels. To Abaye he said: Your business will double like lettuce</b> whose leaves are wide and wrinkled. <b>To Rava he said: Your work will be bitter like</b> a <b>lettuce</b> stalk.

### Part 10
<b>They said to him: We saw meat on the mouth of barrels. To Abaye he said: Your wine will be sweet and everyone will come to buy meat and wine from you. To Rava he said: Your wine will spoil, and everyone will go to buy meat in order to eat with it,</b> to dip the meat in your vinegar.

### Part 11
<b>They said to him: We saw a barrel hanging from a palm tree. To Abaye he said: Your business will rise like a palm tree. To Rava he said: Your work will be sweet like dates</b> which are very cheap in Babylonia, indicating that you will be compelled to sell your merchandise at a cheap price.

### Part 12
<b>They said to him: We saw a pomegranate taking root on the mouth of barrels. To Abaye he said: Your business will increase in value like a pomegranate. To Rava he said: Your work will go sour like a pomegranate.</b>

### Part 13
<b>They said to him: We saw a barrel fall into a pit. To Abaye he said: Your merchandise will be in demand as</b> the adage <b>says: Bread falls in a pit and is not found.</b> In other words, everyone will seek your wares and they will not find them due to increased demand. <b>To Rava he said: Your merchandise will be ruined and you will throw it</b> away <b>into a pit.</b>

### Part 14
<b>They said to him: We saw a donkey-foal standing near our heads, braying. To Abaye he said: You will be a king,</b> that is to say, <b>head of the yeshiva, and an interpreter will stand near you</b> to repeat your teachings to the masses out loud. <b>To Rava he said:</b> I see the words <b><i>peter ḥamor</i>, first-born donkey, erased from your phylacteries.</b> Rava <b>said to him: I myself saw it and it is there.</b> Bar Haddaya <b>said to him:</b> The letter <b><i>vav</i> of</b> the word <b><i>peter ḥamor</i> is certainly erased from your phylacteries.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Ultimately, Rava went to</b> bar Haddaya <b>alone.</b> Rava <b>said to him: I saw the outer door of my house fall.</b> Bar Haddaya <b>said to him: Your wife will die,</b> as she is the one who protects the house. Rava <b>said to him: I saw my front and back teeth fall out. He said to him: Your sons and daughters will die.</b> Rava <b>said to him: I saw two doves that were flying. He said to him: You will divorce two women.</b> Rava <b>said to him: I saw two turnip-heads [<i>gargelidei</i>]. He said to him: You will receive two blows with a club</b> shaped like a turnip. <b>That same day Rava went and sat in the study hall the entire day. He discovered these two blind people who were fighting with each other. Rava went to separate them and they struck Rava two</b> blows. When <b>they raised</b> their staffs <b>to strike him an additional blow, he said:</b> That is <b>enough for me, I</b> only <b>saw two.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Ultimately, Rava came and gave him,</b> bar Haddaya, <b>a fee. And</b> then Rava, <b>said to him: I saw my wall fall.</b> Bar Haddaya <b>said to him: You will acquire property without limits.</b> Rava <b>said to him: I saw Abaye’s house [<i>appadna</i>] fall and its dust covered me.</b> Bar Haddaya <b>said to him: Abaye will die and his yeshiva will come to you.</b> Rava <b>said to him: I saw my house fall, and everyone came and took the bricks. He said to him: Your teachings will be disseminated throughout the world.</b> Rava <b>said to him: I saw that my head split and my brain fell out. He said to him: A feather will fall out of the pillow</b> near your head. Rava <b>said to him: The Egyptian <i>hallel</i>,</b> the <i>hallel</i> that celebrates the Exodus, <b>was read to me in a dream. He said to him: Miracles will be performed for you.</b>

### Part 17
Bar Haddaya <b>was going with</b> Rava <b>on a ship;</b> bar Haddaya <b>said: Why am I</b> going <b>with a person for whom miracles will be performed,</b> lest the miracle will be that the ship will sink and he alone will be saved. <b>As</b> bar Haddaya <b>was climbing</b> onto the ship <b>a book fell from him. Rava found</b> it <b>and saw: All dreams follow the mouth, written therein. He said</b> to bar Haddaya: <b>Scoundrel. It was</b> dependent <b>on you, and you caused me so much suffering. I forgive you for everything except for the daughter</b> of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> Rava’s wife, whom bar Haddaya predicted would die. <b>May it be</b> Your <b>will that this man be delivered into the hands of a kingdom that has no compassion on him.</b>

### Part 18
Bar Haddaya <b>said</b> to himself: <b>What will I do? We learned</b> through tradition <b>that the curse of a Sage,</b> even if <b>baseless, comes</b> true? <b>And all the more so</b> in the case of <b>Rava, as he cursed</b> me <b>justifiably. He said</b> to himself: <b>I will get up and go into exile,</b> as <b>the Master said: Exile atones for transgression.</b>

### Part 19
<b>He arose and exiled himself to the seat of the Roman</b> government. <b>He went and sat by the entrance,</b> where <b>the keeper of the king’s wardrobe</b> stood. <b>The wardrobe guard dreamed a dream.</b> He <b>said to</b> bar Haddaya: <b>I saw in the dream that a needle pierced my finger.</b> Bar Haddaya <b>said to him: Give me a <i>zuz</i>. He did not give him</b> the coin <b>so</b> bar Haddaya <b>said nothing to him.</b> Again, the guard <b>said to him: I saw a worm that fell</b> between <b>my two fingers,</b> eating them. Bar Haddaya <b>said to him: Give me a <i>zuz</i>. He did not give him</b> the coin, <b>so</b> bar Haddaya <b>said nothing to him.</b> Again, the guard <b>said to him: I saw that a worm fell</b> upon <b>my entire hand,</b> eating it. Bar Haddaya <b>said to him: A worm fell</b> upon and ate <b>all the silk</b> garments. <b>They heard</b> of this <b>in the king’s palace and they brought the wardrobe keeper and were</b> in the process of <b>executing him. He said to them: Why me? Bring the one who knew and did not say</b> the information that he knew. <b>They brought</b> bar Haddaya <b>and said to him: Because of your <i>zuz</i>, ruin</b> came upon
