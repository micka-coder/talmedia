### Part 1
<b>and that,</b> the covenant of circumcision, <b>was given with thirteen covenants,</b> as the word <i>brit</i>, covenant, appears thirteen times in the portion dealing with the circumcision of Abraham (Genesis 17:1–14).

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Abba says: One must mention thanks</b> in the blessing of thanksgiving in Grace after Meals <b>at the beginning and the end</b> of the blessing. <b>And one who decreases</b> the number of expressions of thanksgiving <b>may not decrease</b> their number <b>to fewer than one, and</b> if <b>anyone decreases</b> their number <b>to fewer than one, it is reprehensible.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara added that the conclusions of the blessing of the land and the blessing: Who builds Jerusalem, may also not be changed. <b>Anyone who concludes the blessing of the land: Who bequeaths lands and</b> concludes <b>the blessing: Who builds Jerusalem,</b> with the formula: <b>Who redeems Israel, is an ignoramus,</b> as he thereby corrupts the intention of the blessing. <b>And anyone who does not mention covenant and Torah in the blessing of the land and the royal house of David in</b> the blessing: <b>Who builds Jerusalem, did not fulfill his obligation.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara notes: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Il’a, as Rabbi Il’a said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa said in the name of Rabbeinu,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Anyone who did not mention covenant and Torah in the blessing of the land and the royal house of David in</b> the blessing: <b>Who builds Jerusalem, did not fulfill his obligation.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Abba Yosei ben Dostai and the Rabbis disagreed</b> whether or not God’s sovereignty must be invoked in the blessing: Who is good and does good. <b>One said: Who is good and does good, requires</b> mention of God’s <b>sovereignty, and one said: It does not require</b> mention of God’s <b>sovereignty.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>The one who said that it requires</b> mention of God’s <b>sovereignty holds that</b> this blessing was instituted <b>by the Sages,</b> so it is not a continuation of the previous blessings. As an independent blessing, God’s sovereignty must be mentioned. <b>The one who said that it does not require</b> mention of God’s <b>sovereignty holds that</b> the obligation to recite this blessing <b>is by Torah law.</b> Therefore, it is a continuation of the previous blessings.

### Part 6
The Sages taught in a <i>baraita</i>: With <b>what</b> formula <b>does he conclude</b> the third blessing of Grace after Meals, which discusses <b>the building of Jerusalem? Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He concludes it with: <b>Who redeems Israel.</b> This is perplexing: Is that to say that with: <b>Who redeems Israel, yes,</b> he concludes the blessing; with: <b>The building of Jerusalem, no,</b> he does not conclude the blessing? The Gemara responds: <b>Rather, say</b> that Rabbi Yosei son of Rabbi Yehuda said the following: One who recites the blessing concludes either with: The building of Jerusalem, <b>or even</b> with: <b>Who redeems Israel.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna happened</b> to come <b>to the house of the Exilarch.</b> While reciting the blessing: Who builds Jerusalem in Grace after Meals, <b>he opened with one</b> theme: Have compassion on Jerusalem, <b>and concluded with two</b> themes: Both the building of Jerusalem and Who redeems Israel. <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> derisively: It takes <b>great fortitude to conclude with two</b> themes. How could you conclude with two themes? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One may not conclude with two</b> themes? Each blessing has its own particular ending.

### Part 8
The Gemara discusses <b>the matter itself: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One may not conclude with two</b> themes. <b>Levi,</b> his student, <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi based on the standard conclusions of various blessings. The second blessing of Grace after Meals concludes: <b>For the land and for the food.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi explained that the conclusion to that blessing is actually a single theme: <b>The land that produces food.</b> Levi raised a similar objection from the blessing that concludes: <b>For the land and for the fruit.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi explained that there, too, it means: <b>The land that produces fruit.</b>

### Part 9
Levi cited two other blessings: <b>Who sanctifies Israel and the seasons.</b> It means: <b>Who sanctifies Israel, who sanctify the seasons. Who sanctifies Israel and the New Moon.</b> It means: <b>Who sanctifies Israel, who sanctify the New Moons.</b>

### Part 10
Levi cited an additional blessing that concludes with two themes, the blessing recited when Shabbat coincides with a Festival: <b>Who sanctifies Shabbat, Israel, and the seasons.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi answered: <b>Except for that</b> one.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about this blessing? The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> the blessing thanks God <b>for one</b> matter, the sanctity of the day. However, <b>there,</b> in the conclusion of the third blessing of Grace after Meals, the building of Jerusalem and redemption of Israel are <b>two</b> themes, and <b>each one is distinct</b> from the other.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason that one does not conclude</b> a blessing <b>with two</b> themes? The Gemara responds: <b>Because</b> there is a general principle: <b>One does not perform mitzvot in bundles;</b> rather, each mitzva must have its own blessing.

### Part 13
The Gemara has yet to arrive at a clear conclusion regarding the conclusion of the third blessing of Grace after Meals. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion was reached <b>about it?</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> If <b>he opened with: Have compassion on Your people, Israel,</b> mentioning redemption of Israel at the start, <b>he concludes with: Who redeems Israel;</b> if <b>he opened with: Have compassion on Jerusalem, he concludes with: Who builds Jerusalem. Rav Naḥman said: Even if he opened with: Have compassion on Israel, he concludes with: Who builds Jerusalem, because it is stated: “The Lord builds Jerusalem; He gathers in the exiles of Israel”</b> (Psalms 147:2). This verse is interpreted to mean: <b>When does God build Jerusalem? When He gathers in the exiles of Israel.</b> The rebuilding of Jerusalem symbolizes Israel’s redemption.

### Part 15
On a similar topic, the Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rav Ḥisda: Let the Master come and teach</b> Mishna. <b>He responded: I have not</b> yet <b>learned Grace after Meals, and I will teach Mishna? He responded: What is this?</b> Why do you say that you have not yet learned Grace after Meals? <b>He said to him: I happened</b> to come <b>to the house of the Exilarch and recited Grace after Meals, and Rav Sheshet stiffened his neck over me like a snake,</b> i.e., he got angry and challenged me. Rabbi Zeira asked: <b>And why</b> did Rav Sheshet become angry with you? He answered: <b>I did not mention covenant, Torah, or sovereignty</b> in Grace after Meals. Rabbi Zeira wondered: <b>And why did you not mention</b> those themes? He answered that he did so <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion that <b>Rav Ḥananel</b> said that <b>Rav said, as Rav Ḥananel said</b> that <b>Rav said: If one does not mention covenant, Torah or sovereignty</b> in Grace after Meals, <b>he</b> nevertheless <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation because these themes are not applicable to all of Israel. <b>Covenant does not apply to women; Torah and sovereignty apply neither to women nor to slaves.</b> Rabbi Zeira said to him: Rav Sheshet should have been angry with you. <b>And you abandoned all of these <i>tanna’im</i> and <i>amora’im</i></b> who disagree with him, <b>and followed Rav?</b> Evidently, many <i>tanna’im</i> and <i>amora’im</i> hold that covenant, Torah, and sovereignty must be mentioned in the second blessing of Grace after Meals.

### Part 16
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The blessing: <b>Who is good and does good, requires</b> mention of God’s <b>sovereignty.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is he teaching us</b> that we did not already know? If you say that he is teaching us that <b>any blessing that does not contain mention of</b> God’s <b>sovereignty is not</b> considered a <b>blessing, didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan already say that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>once? Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>is saying that</b> the blessing: Who is good and does good, <b>requires two</b> mentions of <b>sovereignty, one for itself and one for</b> the blessing: <b>Who builds Jerusalem.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that God’s sovereignty must be mentioned a second time in the blessing: Who is good and does good, to compensate for the fact that it was not mentioned in the blessing: Who builds Jerusalem, <b>it should require three</b> mentions; <b>one of its own, one for</b> the blessing: <b>Who builds Jerusalem, and one for the blessing of the land,</b> in which sovereignty is also not mentioned. <b>Rather,</b> in <b>the blessing of the land, what is the reason</b> that sovereignty is <b>not</b> mentioned? <b>Because it is a blessing juxtaposed to another</b> preceding blessing. <b>Who builds Jerusalem, should also not require</b> its own mention of God’s sovereignty, <b>as it is a blessing juxtaposed to another</b> preceding blessing.

### Part 18
The Gemara responds: <b>The same is true even</b> with regard to the blessing: <b>Who builds Jerusalem,</b> that it <b>does not require</b> mention of sovereignty. However, <b>since he mentioned the royal house of David</b> in the blessing, <b>it would not be proper</b> if <b>he did not mention God’s sovereignty</b> as well. On the other hand, <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The blessing: Who is good and does good, <b>requires two</b> mentions of <b>sovereignty besides its own;</b> one to compensate for its lack of mention in the blessing: Who builds Jerusalem, and one for the blessing of the land.

### Part 19
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rabbi Zeira sat behind Rav Giddel</b> in the study hall, <b>and Rav Giddel sat before Rav Huna, and he sat and he said: One who erred and did not mention</b> the formula <b>for Shabbat</b> in Grace after Meals, <b>says</b> the following abridged version instead: <b>Blessed…Who gave <i>Shabbatot</i> for rest to His people Israel with love, as a sign and a covenant; Blessed…Who sanctifies the Shabbat.</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: Who said</b> this <i>halakha</i>? He answered: <b>Rav.</b>

### Part 20
<b>Again</b> Rav Giddel <b>sat and said: One who erred and did not mention</b> the formula <b>for Festivals</b> in Grace after Meals, <b>says: “Blessed…Who gave Festivals to His people Israel for joy and for commemoration; Blessed…Who sanctifies Israel and the seasons.”</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: Who said</b> this <i>halakha</i>? He answered: <b>Rav.</b>

### Part 21
<b>Again</b> Rav Giddel <b>sat and said: If one erred and did not mention the New Moon, he says: “Blessed…Who gave the New Moon to His people Israel for commemoration.</b> Rabbi Zeira, who related this incident, said: <b>I do not know whether he mentioned joy in</b> the formula <b>or whether he did not mention joy, whether he concluded this</b> formula with a blessing as he did in the parallel formulas for Shabbat and Festivals <b>or if he did not conclude it</b> with a blessing; <b>and whether</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is his or whether it is his teacher</b> Rav’s statement.

### Part 22
The Gemara relates: <b>Giddel bar Manyumi was standing before Rav Naḥman, Rav Naḥman erred</b> and did not mention the special formula for Shabbat in Grace after Meals,
