### Part 1
He may <b>even</b> say: <b>Bless; nevertheless: Let us bless, is preferable as Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> that <b>they said in the school of Rav: We learned:</b> A group of <b>six to ten</b> people may <b>divide</b> into two groups, each forming its own <i>zimmun</i>. However, a group of ten, which invokes God’s name in the <i>zimmun</i>, may not divide into two groups as that would negate the opportunity to invoke God’s name.

### Part 2
The Gemara proceeds: <b>Granted, if you say: Let us bless is preferable, that is why</b> six people who ate together may <b>divide</b> into two groups. <b>However, if you say: Bless is preferable, why</b> are they permitted to <b>divide</b> into two groups? Neither group would be able to say: Bless. <b>Rather, mustn’t one conclude from this: Let us bless is preferable</b> as the one reciting the <i>zimmun</i> does not exclude himself from the group? The Gemara sums up the discussion: Indeed, <b>conclude from this</b> that that is the case.

### Part 3
<b>That was also taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Both</b> if <b>he said: Bless, and</b> if <b>he said: Let us bless, we do not reprimand him for</b> doing <b>so; and the punctilious reprimand him for</b> doing <b>so. And</b> the Gemara says: As a rule, <b>from</b> the style of <b>one’s blessings it is obvious whether or not he is a Torah scholar. How so?</b> For example, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> In a <i>zimmun</i>, one who recites: Blessed be the One from Whose food we have eaten <b>and by Whose goodness</b> we live, <b>he is a Torah scholar.</b> However, one who recites: Blessed be the One from Whose food we have eaten <b>and from Whose goodness</b> we live, <b>he is an ignoramus,</b> as that expression insinuates that only some of God’s goodness was bestowed upon him, which is tantamount to a denial of God’s loving-kindness.

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said to Rav Dimi: Isn’t it written</b> that King David articulated his prayer in that manner: “Be pleased, therefore, to bless Your servant’s house, that it abide before You forever; for You, Lord God, have spoken. <b>And from Your blessing may Your servant’s house be blessed forever”</b> (II Samuel 7:29). David said: From Your blessing. The Gemara answers: <b>In</b> a case of <b>request it is different,</b> as it is inappropriate to demand the full bounty of God’s blessing. The Gemara questions this: <b>In</b> a case of <b>request, too, is it not written</b> that a request for the full bounty of God’s blessing is granted: <b>“Open your mouth wide, that I will fill it”</b> (Psalms 81:11)? What one receives corresponds to what he requests. The Gemara answered: <b>That</b> verse <b>is written with regard to matters of Torah,</b> where it is wholly appropriate to make excessive requests.

### Part 5
On the topic of the <i>zimmun</i> formula, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> One who recites in a <i>zimmun</i>: <b>And by His goodness we live, he is a Torah scholar.</b> However, one who recites: And by His goodness <b>they live, he is a fool,</b> as he excluded himself from the collective. The Sages <b>of Neharbela taught the opposite.</b> In their opinion, they live is preferable because it is a more inclusive formula, whereas, we live is more limited and personal. Nonetheless, the Gemara concludes: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of the Sages <b>of Neharbela.</b>

### Part 6
On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> One who recites in a <i>zimmun</i>: <b>Let us bless the One Whose food we have eaten, he is a Torah scholar.</b> However, one who recites: Let us bless <b>to Him from Whose food we have eaten, he is an ignoramus,</b> as it appears that the blessing is directed to the host of the meal.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Aḥa the son of Rava</b> questioned this and <b>said to Rav Ashi: Don’t we say</b> during the Passover seder: <b>To He Who performed all of these miracles for our ancestors and for us,</b> using the expression: To He Who? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: There,</b> in the case of miracles performed for our ancestors and for us, <b>it is self-evident</b> that the blessing refers to God. <b>Who performs miracles? The Holy One, blessed be He.</b> In the case of food, however, it is not self-evident, as the host of the meal also provided the food that was eaten.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> with regard to the formula of the <i>zimmun</i> that one who recites in a <i>zimmun</i>: <b>Blessed be the One from Whose food we have eaten, he is a Torah scholar.</b> However, one who recites: <b>For the food we have eaten, he is an ignoramus,</b> as it appears that he is blessing the host of the meal. If he was blessing God, why would he restrict the blessing to food (<i>Tosafot</i>)?

### Part 9
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua said: We only said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> a <i>zimmun</i> of <b>three, where there is no</b> mention of <b>God’s name. In</b> a <i>zimmun</i> of <b>ten, however, where there is</b> mention of <b>God’s name, it is self-evident</b> to whom the blessing refers, <b>as we learned</b> in our mishna: <b>Just as he recites the blessing, so too</b> do those present <b>recite in response: Blessed be the Lord our God, the God of Israel, the God of Hosts, Who sits upon the cherubs, for the food that we have eaten.</b>

### Part 10
We learned in our mishna with regard to the formula of <i>zimmun</i>: This formula is recited <b>both</b> in a group of <b>ten and in</b> a group of <b>one hundred thousand.</b> The Gemara raises an objection: <b>The</b> mishna <b>itself is difficult.</b> On one hand, <b>you said:</b> This formula is recited <b>both</b> in a group of <b>ten and in</b> a group of <b>one hundred thousand; consequently,</b> the two cases <b>are the same.</b> On the other hand, <b>it is then taught: In</b> a group of <b>one hundred</b> people, the one reciting the <i>zimmun</i> <b>says; in</b> a group of <b>one thousand</b> people, the one reciting the <i>zimmun</i> <b>says; in</b> a group of <b>ten thousand</b> people, the one reciting the <i>zimmun</i> <b>says.</b> Evidently, the formula depends on the number of people.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> as these two statements are the opinions of different Sages. <b>This is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, and that is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. As we learned</b> in our mishna: <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: According to the size of the crowd, they recite the blessing, as it is stated: “Bless you God in full assemblies,</b> even the Lord, you who are from the fountain of Israel” (Psalms 68:27). We also learned in our mishna that <b>Rabbi Akiva said</b> that there are no distinctions based on the size of the crowd: <b>What do we find in the synagogue?</b> Both when there are many and when there are few, as long as there is a quorum of ten, the prayer leader says: Bless the Lord. In the case of Grace after Meals as well, the formula remains the same regardless of the number of people participating in the <i>zimmun</i>.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Akiva, what does he do with that verse</b> cited by <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He needs it to</b> derive <b>that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that even fetuses in their mother’s womb recited</b> the <b>song at the</b> Red <b>Sea? As it is stated</b> in the chapter of Psalms that describes the exodus from Egypt: <b>“In assemblies, bless God, the Lord, from the source of Israel,”</b> and fetuses are included in these assemblies. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, derive the matter of the singing of the fetuses? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> it <b>from </b>“from<b> the source</b> of Israel,” which he interprets as an allusion to the womb.

### Part 13
<b>Rava said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Gemara recounts that <b>Ravina and Rav Ḥama bar Buzi happened</b> to come <b>to</b> a banquet at <b>the house of the Exilarch.</b> At the end of the meal, <b>Rav Ḥama rose and was seeking</b> to gather a group of <b>one hundred</b> participants in the meal so that the <i>zimmun</i> for one hundred could be recited. <b>Ravina said to him: You need not</b> do so, as <b>Rava declared the following: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> and the formula remains the same regardless of the number of people participating in the <i>zimmun</i>, as long as there are at least ten.

### Part 14
The Gemara discusses Rava’s conduct at meals at the house of the Exilarch. <b>Rava said: When we would eat bread at the house of the Exilarch, we would recite the</b> Grace after Meals <b>blessing in groups of three.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Let them recite the blessing in groups of ten.</b> The Gemara answers: Then <b>the Exilarch would hear and become angry</b> upon seeing a large group of Sages reciting Grace after Meals before he completed his meal. The Gemara asks: <b>Why could they not satisfy their obligation with the Exilarch’s blessing?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since everyone is making noise, they do not hear</b> and would not fulfill their obligation.

### Part 15
<b>Rabba Tosefa’a said: These three</b> people, <b>who break bread together and one of them went ahead and recited</b> Grace after Meals <b>on his own</b> without a <i>zimmun</i>, <b>they,</b> the other two diners, <b>fulfill</b> their obligation <b>with his</b> participation in their <b><i>zimmun</i>; he,</b> however, <b>does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with</b> his participation in <b>their <i>zimmun</i> because there is no retroactive <i>zimmun</i>,</b> and once he recited his blessing, participating in the <i>zimmun</i> accomplishes nothing for him.

### Part 16
The mishna states that Rabbi Akiva holds that in the synagogue, one recites: Bless the Lord, while <b>Rabbi Yishmael said</b> that he recites: <b>Bless the Lord the blessed One. Rafram bar Pappa happened</b> to come <b>to the synagogue of Abei Givar when he rose to read from the</b> Torah <b>scroll and recited: Bless the Lord, and was silent, and did not recite: The blessed One.</b> Because Rafram bar Pappa followed the principle that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, and those present were not accustomed to that ruling, <b>everyone</b> in the synagogue <b>cried out: Bless the Lord the blessed One. Rava said</b> to Rafram bar Pappa: <b>You black pot,</b> a fond nickname for a Torah scholar who invests great effort in Torah study and worship of God, <b>why are you</b> involving yourself <b>in this</b> tannaitic <b>dispute?</b> Although Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael disagree, Rabbi Yishmael’s formula, in which Rabbi Akiva’s formula is included, is acceptable to both. <b>Furthermore, standard practice is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael.</b>

### Part 17
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Three</b> people <b>who ate as one are not permitted to divide</b> and recite Grace after Meals individually; rather, they recite the <i>zimmun</i> together. <b>And the same</b> is true of <b>four</b> who ate together, <b>and the same</b> is true of <b>five.</b> However, a group of <b>six, up to</b> but not including <b>ten</b> people who ate as one, <b>may divide</b> into two groups, each reciting its own <i>zimmun</i>. <b>And</b> a group of <b>ten may not divide</b> into two groups <b>until there are twenty</b> people present. The general principle is that a group may not divide unless the smaller groups will be able to recite the same <i>zimmun</i> formula that the whole group would have recited.

### Part 18
The mishna states a <i>halakha</i> with regard to two groups joining together: <b>Two groups that were eating in one house, when some</b> members of each group <b>can see each other, they may combine to</b> form a <b><i>zimmun</i>. And if not, these recite a <i>zimmun</i> for themselves and those recite a <i>zimmun</i> for themselves.</b>

### Part 19
The mishna also speaks of the blessing over wine: <b>One does not recite a blessing over wine until he adds water to it,</b> that is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b> Undiluted wine is too strong to drink and a blessing is inappropriate. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Since it is possible to drink undiluted wine, one <b>recites a blessing over it.</b>

### Part 20
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> At the beginning of the mishna, we learned that three people who ate together may not disperse. The Gemara asks: <b>What does this</b> mishna <b>teach us? We</b> already <b>learned this once: Three</b> people <b>who ate as one are required to form a <i>zimmun</i>.</b>

### Part 21
The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>which Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Three</b> individuals <b>who sat to eat as one, and they have not yet begun to eat,</b> nevertheless, <b>they are not permitted to divide</b> and recite Grace after Meals individually.

### Part 22
The Gemara cites <b>another version: Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Shmuel said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>teaches: Three</b> individuals <b>who sat to eat as one, even though</b> they do not share a meal, but <b>each and every one</b> of them <b>eats from his own loaf, they</b> are considered a single group in terms of <i>zimmun</i>, and <b>are not permitted to divide. Alternatively,</b> perhaps the mishna comes to teach <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rav Huna, as Rav Huna said: Three</b> individuals <b>who came from three</b> different <b>groups</b> and sat together to continue their meals also form a <i>zimmun</i> and <b>are not permitted to divide.</b>

### Part 23
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: And that</b> is only the <i>halakha</i> in a case where the three individuals <b>came from three groups of three people</b> each, so that each original group was independently obligated to recite the <i>zimmun</i>, and that obligation never lapsed.

### Part 24
<b>Rava</b> qualified this, and <b>said:</b>
