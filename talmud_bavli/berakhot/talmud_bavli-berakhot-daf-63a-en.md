### Part 1
<b>and say</b> as follows: With regard to <b>the Temple Mount,</b> where one is <b>prohibited</b> from wearing <b>shoes, let us derive</b> the prohibition of spitting <b>from</b> the case of <b>shoes. However,</b> with regard to <b>a synagogue,</b> where one is <b>permitted</b> to wear <b>shoes, instead of deriving</b> the law with regard to spitting <b>from</b> the case of <b>shoes and permitting</b> it, <b>derive it from</b> the case of <b>a shortcut, and prohibit</b> it.

### Part 2
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> a different reason: The synagogue is <b>like one’s house. Just as one objects to</b> a person using <b>his house as a shortcut,</b> but <b>does not mind spitting and</b> wearing <b>shoes</b> therein, <b>so too</b> in the case of a <b>synagogue, a shortcut is prohibited</b> while <b>spitting and</b> wearing <b>shoes are permitted.</b>

### Part 3
We learned in the mishna: <b>At the conclusion of all blessings</b> recited <b>in the Temple,</b> the one reciting the blessing would say: Blessed are You Lord, God of Israel, until everlasting.

### Part 4
The Gemara explains: <b>Why</b> were they insistent upon this formula <b>to that extent? Because one does not answer amen in the Temple.</b> Because there is a unique response to the blessings in the Temple, a unique formula for their conclusion was instituted. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one does not answer amen in the Temple? As it is stated: “Stand up and bless the Lord, your God, from everlasting to everlasting”</b> (Nehemiah 9:5), which refers to the conclusion. <b>The verse</b> in Nehemiah <b>continues: “And let them say: Blessed be Your glorious name, that is exalted above all blessing and praise”</b> (Nehemiah 9:5). The response is exalted above other blessings.

### Part 5
From the beginning of the verse, I <b>might</b> have thought that <b>all of the blessings there will have</b> only <b>a single</b> expression of <b>praise,</b> amen. Therefore, <b>the verse teaches: “That is exalted above all blessing and praise”; for every blessing, a</b> unique <b>praise is offered.</b> Therefore, the appropriate response to a blessing in the Temple is: Blessed are You Lord, God of Israel, from everlasting until everlasting.

### Part 6
We learned in the mishna that the Sages <b>instituted that a person will greet another</b> with the name of God, and several biblical sources were cited. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is it necessary for the mishna to cite all of those sources, introduced with the phrase: <b>And it says?</b> Why was the proof from Boaz’s statement to the harvesters: The Lord is with you, insufficient?

### Part 7
The Gemara explains: <b>And if you say: Boaz said this on his own,</b> and it proves nothing with regard to normative practice, <b>come and hear</b> a proof from the verse: <b>“The Lord is with you, mighty man of valor”</b> (Judges 6:12). <b>And if you say</b> that <b>it was an angel who said</b> this <b>to Gideon,</b> that perhaps this verse was the angel informing Gideon that the Lord is with him, but it is not the standard formula of a greeting, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the verse: <b>“And despise not your mother when she is old”</b> (Proverbs 23:22); the customs of the nation’s elders are an adequate source from which to derive <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 8
<b>And</b> the verse <b>states: “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void Your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126). Of this, <b>Rava said: This verse</b> can be <b>interpreted from beginning to end, and</b> can be <b>interpreted from end to beginning.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara elaborates: This verse can be <b>interpreted from beginning to end: It is time to work for the Lord; what is the reason? Because they have made void Your Torah,</b> so it must be remedied. Conversely, it can be <b>interpreted from end to beginning</b> as follows: <b>They have made void Your Torah; what is the reason? Because it is time to work for the Lord.</b> By means of violating the Torah, it is possible to fundamentally rectify the situation.

### Part 10
With regard to this verse, <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Hillel the Elder says: At the time of gathering,</b> if the Sages of the generation see to it that the Torah remains the purview of the few, <b>disseminate</b> it to the public at large. <b>At the time of dissemination, gather,</b> and leave it to others to disseminate the Torah. <b>And if you see a generation for whom Torah is beloved, disseminate, as it is stated: “There is who scatters, and yet increases”</b> (Proverbs 11:24). However, <b>if you see a generation for whom Torah is not beloved, gather;</b> do not cause the Torah to be disgraced, <b>as it is stated: “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void Your Torah.”</b> Preventing Torah study in that situation is a manifestation of work for the Lord.

### Part 11
On a similar note, <b>bar Kappara taught:</b> If the price of the merchandise has <b>declined, jump and purchase from it; and where there is no man, there be a man;</b> where there is no one to fill a particular role, accept that role upon yourself. <b>Abaye said: Infer from this</b> that <b>where there is a man, there do not be a man.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: Isn’t Abaye’s conclusion <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> statement <b>is only necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> there are <b>two who are equal.</b> Although you, too, are suited to fill that role, since another qualified person is already filling that role, allow him to succeed.

### Part 13
<b>Bar Kappara taught: Which is a brief passage upon which all fundamental</b> principles of <b>Torah are dependent? “In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct your paths”</b> (Proverbs 3:6). <b>Rava said:</b> One must apply this principle <b>even to acts of transgression,</b> as even then one must adhere to God and refrain from sinning excessively.

### Part 14
<b>Bar Kappara taught: A person should always teach his child a clean and simple craft.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> craft is considered clean and simple? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Cutting precious stones.</b>

### Part 15
Several ethical tenets and guidelines for life <b>were taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: One should never have too many friends in his house,</b> i.e., people should not become accustomed to being overly intimate in his house, <b>as it is stated: “There are friends that one has to his own hurt”</b> (Proverbs 18:24); one with friends of that kind will ultimately come to quarrel.

### Part 16
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Do not appoint an administrator [<i>apitropos</i>] within your house, as had Potiphar not appointed Joseph as administrator within his house,</b> Joseph <b>would not have come to that incident</b> involving him in allegations of sexual impropriety.

### Part 17
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Why is the portion of the Nazirite</b> (Numbers ch. 6) <b>juxtaposed with the portion of the <i>sota</i></b> (Numbers ch. 5)? They are juxtaposed <b>to tell you that anyone who sees a <i>sota</i> in her disgrace,</b> her transgression, <b>should renounce wine,</b> as wine is one of the causes of that transgression.

### Part 18
<b>Ḥizkiya, son of Rabbi Parnakh, said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Why is the portion of <i>sota</i> juxtaposed with the portion of <i>terumot</i> and tithes</b> (Numbers ch. 5)? They are juxtaposed <b>to tell you: Anyone who has <i>terumot</i> and tithes and does not give them to a priest,</b> will <b>ultimately require</b> the services of <b>a priest by means of his wife, as it is stated: “And every man’s hallowed things shall be his” (</b>Numbers 5:10). This refers to one who keeps those hallowed items for himself. <b>To this</b> the Torah <b>juxtaposed: “If any man’s wife go aside and act unfaithfully against him”</b> (Numbers 5:12). <b>And it is written: “Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest”</b> (Numbers 5:15). <b>Moreover, ultimately</b> that man <b>will require</b> assistance from the tithe given to the poor, <b>as it is stated: “And every man’s hallowed things shall be his”</b> (Numbers 5:10). He will himself need those very hallowed items that he was unwilling to give to others.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: And if he gave them, ultimately</b> he will <b>become wealthy, as it is said: “Whatsoever any man gives the priest, it shall be his”</b> (Numbers 5:10); <b>much property shall be his.</b>

### Part 20
<b>Rav Huna bar Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Elazar HaKappar: Anyone who includes the name of heaven in his distress,</b> i.e., who turns and prays to God in his time of trouble, <b>his livelihood will</b> ultimately <b>be doubled, as it is stated: “And the Almighty be your treasure, and precious [<i>toafot</i>] silver unto you”</b> (Job 22:25). If you include God in your trouble, your silver will be doubled. <i>Eif</i>, which in Aramaic means double, is etymologically similar to <i>toafot</i>.

### Part 21
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> a different explanation: This means that <b>his sustenance flies [<i>meofefet</i>] to him like a bird, as it is stated: “And precious silver [<i>toafot</i>] unto you.”</b>

### Part 22
<b>Rabbi Tavi said in the name of Rabbi Yoshiya: Anyone who is lax in his</b> study of <b>matters of Torah will</b> ultimately <b>lack the strength to stand on a day of adversity, as it is stated: “If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small indeed”</b> (Proverbs 24:10). <b>Rav Ami bar Mattana said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: And even</b> if he was lax in the performance of <b>a single</b> mitzva, <b>as it is stated: If you faint;</b> this applies <b>in any case,</b> even in the case of a single mitzva.

### Part 23
<b>Rav Safra said: Rabbi Abbahu would relate: When Ḥanina, son of Rabbi Yehoshua’s brother, went to the Diaspora,</b> Babylonia, <b>he would intercalate years and establish months outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. Because Judaism in Eretz Yisrael had declined in the wake of the bar Kokheva rebellion, he considered it necessary to cultivate the Jewish community in Babylonia as the center of the Jewish people. Among other things, he intercalated the years and established the months even though the <i>halakha</i> restricts those activities to Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 24
Eventually, the Sages of Eretz Yisrael <b>sent two Torah scholars after him, Rabbi Yosei ben Keifar and the grandson of Zekharya ben Kevutal. When</b> Ḥanina <b>saw them, he asked them: Why did you come? They responded: We came to study Torah.</b> Since he saw his standing enhanced by the Sages of Eretz Yisrael coming to study Torah from him, <b>he proclaimed about them: These people are eminent</b> scholars <b>of our generation, and their fathers served in the Temple. As we learned</b> in tractate <i>Yoma</i>: <b>Zekharya ben Kevutal says: Many times I read before</b> the High Priest from <b>the book of Daniel</b> on the eve of Yom Kippur.

### Part 25
These two scholars, however, began to dispute every decision Ḥanina rendered in response to questions raised in the study hall. <b>He</b> ruled it <b>impure and they</b> ruled it <b>pure; he prohibited</b> it <b>and they permitted</b> it. Eventually, <b>he proclaimed about them: These people are worthless. They are</b> good <b>for nothing</b> and they know nothing. <b>They said to him: You have already built</b> up our names and glorified us; <b>you cannot now demolish. You have already built a fence and you cannot break through it.</b>

### Part 26
<b>He said to them: Why is it that</b> when <b>I</b> rule something <b>impure, you</b> rule it <b>pure;</b> when <b>I prohibit</b> it, <b>you permit</b> it? <b>They said to him:</b> We do this <b>because you intercalate the years and establish the months outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.

### Part 27
<b>He said to them: Didn’t</b> Rabbi <b>Akiva ben Yosef</b> also <b>intercalate years and establish months outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael? <b>They replied to him: Leave</b> the case of <b>Rabbi Akiva, as,</b> when he left, <b>he did not leave behind anyone</b> as great in Torah <b>as he in Eretz Yisrael.</b> Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to them: I also did not leave behind anyone</b> as great <b>as me in Eretz Yisrael. They said to him: The kids who you left behind have grown into goats with horns;</b> they are greater than you are. <b>And they sent us to you, and this is what they said to us: Go and tell him in our name: If he obeys, fine; and if</b> he does <b>not</b> obey, <b>he will be ostracized.</b>
