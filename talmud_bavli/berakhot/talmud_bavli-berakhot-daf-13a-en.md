### Part 1
<b>not that</b> the name <b>Jacob will be</b> entirely <b>uprooted from its place, but that</b> the name <b>Israel</b> will be the <b>primary</b> name <b>to which</b> the name <b>Jacob</b> will be <b>secondary,</b> as the Torah continues to refer to him as Jacob after this event. <b>And it also says</b> that the ultimate redemption will overshadow the previous redemption in the verse: <b>“Do not remember the former events, and do not ponder things of old”</b> (Isaiah 43:18), and the Gemara explains: <b>“Do not remember the former events,” that is the subjugation to the kingdoms, and “do not ponder things of old,” that is the exodus from Egypt,</b> which occurred before the subjugation to the nations.

### Part 2
With regard to the following verse: <b>“Behold, I will do new things, now it will spring forth”</b> (Isaiah 43:19), <b>Rav Yosef taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>This refers to the</b> future <b>war of Gog and Magog,</b> which will cause all earlier events to be forgotten.

### Part 3
The Gemara cites <b>a parable: To what is this comparable? To a person who was walking along the way and a wolf accosted him and he survived it, and he continued to relate the story of the wolf. A lion accosted him and he survived it, and he continued to relate the story of the lion. A snake accosted him and he survived it, he forgot both</b> the lion and the wolf, <b>and he continued to relate the story of the snake.</b> Each encounter was more dangerous and each escape more miraculous than the last, so he would continue to relate the most recent story. <b>So too</b> with <b>Israel; more recent troubles cause the earlier</b> troubles <b>to be forgotten.</b>

### Part 4
Having mentioned the changing of Jacob’s name, the Gemara addresses the changing of the names of Abraham and Sarah. What is the meaning of changing Abram’s name to Abraham? As it is stated: <b>“Abram is Abraham”</b> (I Chronicles 1:27).

### Part 5
The Gemara explains: <b>Initially he became a father,</b> a minister, and prominent person, only <b>to Aram,</b> so he was called Abram, father [av] of Aram, <b>and ultimately</b> with God’s blessing <b>he became the father of the entire world,</b> so he was called Abraham, father of the masses [<i>av hamon</i>], as it is stated: “I have made you the father of a multitude of nations” (Genesis 17:5).

### Part 6
Similarly, what is the meaning of changing Sarai’s name to Sarah? The same concept applies to Sarai as to Abram: <b>Sarai is Sarah.”</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara explains: <b>Initially she was a princess</b> only <b>to her nation:</b> My princess [<i>Sarai</i>], <b>but ultimately she became Sarah,</b> a general term indicating that she was princess <b>for the entire world.</b>

### Part 8
Also, with regard to Abraham’s name, <b>bar Kappara taught: Anyone who calls Abraham Abram transgresses a positive mitzva, as it is stated: “And your name will be Abraham”</b> (Genesis 17:5). This is a positive mitzva to refer to him as Abraham. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One who calls Abraham Abram <b>transgresses a negative mitzva, as it is stated: “And your name shall no longer be called Abram,</b> and your name will be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations” (Genesis 17:5).

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if we consider these obligatory statements, then <b>from here</b> we must infer that <b>one who calls Sarah Sarai also</b> transgresses a positive or negative mitzva.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> in the case of Sarah, it is not a general mitzva, rather <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Abraham</b> alone: “And God said to Abraham, <b>your wife Sarai, you shall not call her name Sarai; rather, Sarah is her name”</b> (Genesis 17:15). In contrast, this is stated regarding Abraham in general terms: “Your name shall no longer be called Abram.”

### Part 11
Again, the Gemara asks: <b>But if that is so, one who calls Jacob Jacob,</b> about whom it is written: “Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel” (Genesis 32:29), <b>also</b> transgresses a mitzva.

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there, as the verse reverts back</b> and God Himself refers to Jacob as Jacob, <b>as it is written</b> before his descent to Egypt: <b>“And God said to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob,</b> and he said, ‘Here I am’” (Genesis 46:2).

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin, and some say Rabbi Yosei bar Zevida, raised an objection</b> to the statements of bar Kappara and Rabbi Eliezer based on what is said in the recounting of the history of the Jewish people: <b>“You are the Lord, God, Who chose Abram</b> and took him out of Ur Kasdim and made his name Abraham” (Nehemiah 9:7). Here the Bible refers to him as Abram.

### Part 14
The Gemara responds: <b>There, the prophet is recounting God’s praises,</b> including <b>that which was</b> the situation <b>originally,</b> before his name was changed to Abraham. Indeed, the verse continues: “You took him out of Ur Kasdim and made his name Abraham, and found his heart faithful before You and made a covenant with him to give him the land of Canaan…to give to his descendants, and You fulfilled Your words for You are righteous” (Nehemiah 9:7–8).
