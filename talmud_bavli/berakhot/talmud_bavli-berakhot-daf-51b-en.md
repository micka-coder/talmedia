<b>we will act stringently</b> and not assist the right hand with the left.

### Part 2
<b>And he lifts it</b> at least <b>one handbreadth from the ground. Rav Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: What is the verse</b> that proves this? <b>“I will lift the cup of salvation and upon the name of the Lord I will call”</b> (Psalms 116:13).

### Part 3
<b>And he fixes his eyes upon</b> the cup; <b>so that his attention will not be distracted from it.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And he sends it as a gift to members of his household; so that his wife will be blessed.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara relates: <b>Ulla happened</b> to come <b>to the house of Rav Naḥman. He ate bread, recited Grace after Meals, and gave the cup of blessing to Rav Naḥman. Rav Naḥman said to him: Master, please send the cup of blessing to Yalta,</b> my wife. Ulla <b>responded to him:</b> There is no need, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: The fruit of a woman’s body is blessed only from the fruit of a man’s body, as it is stated:</b> “And He will love you, and bless you, and make you numerous, <b>and He will bless the fruit of your body”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:13). The Gemara infers: “He will bless <b>the fruit of her body” was not stated. Rather,</b> “He will bless <b>the fruit of your</b> [masculine singular] <b>body.”</b> For his wife to be blessed with children, it is sufficient to give the cup to Rav Naḥman.

### Part 6
<b>That</b> opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the fruit of a woman’s body is only blessed from the fruit of a man’s body? As it is stated: And He will bless the fruit of your body;</b> He will bless <b>the fruit of her body was not stated. Rather,</b> He will bless <b>the fruit of your body.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara relates that <b>meanwhile Yalta heard</b> Ulla’s refusal to send her the cup of blessing. Yalta was the daughter of the Exilarch and was accustomed to being treated with deference, so <b>she arose in a rage, entered the wine-storage, and broke four hundred barrels of wine.</b> Afterward, <b>Rav Naḥman said to</b> Ulla: <b>Let the Master send her another cup.</b> Ulla <b>sent</b> Yalta a different cup with a message saying that <b>all</b> of the wine in <b>this barrel is</b> wine <b>of blessing;</b> although you did not drink from the cup of blessing itself, you may at least drink from the barrel from which the cup of blessing was poured. <b>She sent him</b> a stinging response: <b>From itinerant</b> peddlers, Ulla traveled regularly from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia and back, come meaningless <b>words, and from rags</b> come <b>lice.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rav Asi said: One may not speak over a cup of blessing</b> from the moment he takes it in his hand until he drinks it. <b>And Rav Asi said: One may not recite a blessing over a cup of punishment.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is a cup of punishment? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: A second cup. That</b> opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who drinks in pairs should not recite a blessing, because it is stated: “Prepare to meet your God, O Israel”</b> (Amos 4:12). One must be well-prepared in order to stand before his Creator, <b>and this</b> person who drank two cups of wine <b>is not prepared,</b> as drinking an even number of cups of wine is dangerous due to demons.

### Part 9
In concluding the <i>halakhot</i> of blessings, the Gemara cites that <b>Rabbi Abbahu said, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: One who eats and walks, recites the blessing</b> of Grace after Meals <b>standing</b> in one place, <b>and one who eats standing, recites the blessing</b> while <b>seated, and one who eats reclining</b> on a divan <b>sits and</b> then <b>recites the blessing. And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: <b>In all of these cases one sits and</b> then <b>recites the blessing.</b>
