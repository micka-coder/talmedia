### Part 1
The Gemara deduces: This proves <b>by inference that if he purchases</b> a new object <b>and then purchases</b> a similar object, <b>everyone agrees that he is not required to recite a blessing,</b> as he has already recited a blessing over the purchase of that type of item.

### Part 2
<b>Some say</b> a different version of this dispute: <b>Rav Huna said: They only taught</b> that one recites the blessing: Who has given us life, on a new vessel <b>if he did not purchase</b> that item in the past <b>and purchased</b> the item now, for the first time. <b>However, if he purchased</b> that item in the past <b>and purchased</b> the item <b>again, he need not recite a blessing. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even if one purchased</b> that item in the past <b>and purchased</b> a similar item <b>again, he must recite a blessing.</b> This proves <b>by inference that if one</b> already <b>has</b> a vessel <b>and</b> then <b>purchased</b> similar vessels, <b>everyone agrees that he must recite a blessing.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: One who <b>built a new house and does not</b> already <b>own a similar</b> house, <b>or purchased new vessels and does not</b> already <b>own similar</b> vessels, <b>must recite a blessing.</b> However, if <b>he</b> already <b>owns a similar</b> one, <b>he need not recite a blessing,</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda,</b> on the other hand, <b>says: In either case, he must recite a blessing.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the first version</b> of the dispute between Rav Huna and Rabbi Yoḥanan, one could say that <b>Rav Huna</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. However, according to the latter version</b> of the dispute, <b>granted, Rav Huna</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, but in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>did Rabbi Yoḥanan state</b> his opinion? His statement <b>is neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir nor in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara responds: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said to you: The same is true according to Rabbi Yehuda’s</b> opinion; in a case where <b>one has purchased</b> an item in the past <b>and purchased</b> a similar item <b>again, he must recite a blessing.</b> The fact <b>that they</b> only <b>disagreed with regard to</b> a case <b>where he</b> already <b>owned</b> similar vessels <b>and he purchased</b> new ones does not indicate that this is their only disagreement. The dispute was presented in this way <b>to convey the far-reaching nature of Rabbi Meir’s</b> opinion<b>; even</b> in a case where <b>one purchased</b> an item <b>while owning a</b> similar item, <b>he need not recite a blessing; all the more so</b> in a case where <b>he purchased</b> an item <b>and then purchased</b> a similar item <b>again, he need not recite a blessing.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if that is the reason for presenting the dispute in this manner, <b>let them disagree with regard to</b> a case <b>where one purchased</b> an item in the past <b>and</b> then <b>purchased</b> a similar item <b>again,</b> where according to Rabbi Meir <b>one need not recite a blessing, in order to convey the far-reaching nature of Rabbi Yehuda’s</b> opinion; as Rabbi Yehuda requires a blessing in that case. The Gemara responds: The Gemara preferred the version before us in order to demonstrate the extent to which Rabbi Meir was lenient in not requiring a blessing because <b>the strength of leniency is preferable.</b>

### Part 7
We learned in the mishna: <b>One recites a blessing for the bad</b> that befalls him just as he does for the good. This is to say that one recites the blessing appropriate for the present situation even if it is bad, despite the fact that it may develop into a positive situation in the future.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>In a case where a dam was breached</b> and water flowed <b>onto one’s land, despite</b> the fact <b>that this will</b> ultimately <b>be beneficial for him, for his land will be covered with sediment</b> from the flowing water <b>which will enhance</b> the quality of his soil, <b>it is</b> nonetheless <b>bad at present.</b>

### Part 9
One must recite a blessing <b>for the good</b> that befalls him just as for the bad.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>In a case where one found a lost object, despite</b> the fact <b>that it is</b> ultimately <b>bad for him</b> because <b>if the king heard about it, he would</b> certainly <b>take it from him.</b> At that time, the law deemed all found objects the property of the king’s treasury and one who did not report such an object would be punished. Nevertheless, <b>it is favorable at present.</b>

### Part 11
We learned in the mishna: <b>One whose wife was pregnant and he said: May it be</b> God’s <b>will that</b> my wife <b>will give birth</b> to a male child, <b>it is a vain prayer.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Is a prayer</b> in that case <b>ineffective? Rav Yosef raises an objection</b> based on a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated: <b>“And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dina”</b> (Genesis 30:21). The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> meant by the addition of the word: <b>Afterwards?</b> What does the verse seek to convey by emphasizing that after the birth of Zebulun she gave birth to Dina? <b>Rav said: After Leah passed judgment on herself and said: Twelve tribes are destined to descend from Jacob, six came from me and four from the maidservants, that is ten,</b> and <b>if this</b> fetus <b>is male, my sister</b> Rachel <b>will not</b> even <b>be</b> the equivalent <b>of one the maidservants; immediately</b> the fetus <b>was transformed into a daughter, as it is stated: And she called her name Dina;</b> meaning she named her after her judgment [din]. The Gemara rejects this: <b>One does not mention miraculous acts</b> to teach general <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 13
The Gemara introduces an alternative explanation: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the <b>story of Leah</b> and her prayer with regard to the fetus <b>was within forty days</b> of conception. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: During <b>the first three days</b> after intercourse, <b>one should pray that</b> the seed <b>not putrefy,</b> that it will fertilize the egg and develop into a fetus. <b>From the third</b> day <b>until the fortieth, one should pray that it will be male. From the fortieth</b> day <b>until three months, one should pray that it will not be</b> deformed, in the shape of a <b>flat fish,</b> as when the fetus does not develop it assumes a shape somewhat similar to a flat sandal fish. <b>From the third month until the sixth, one should pray that it will not be stillborn.</b> And <b>from the sixth</b> month <b>until the ninth, one should pray that it will be emerge safely.</b> Therefore, during the first forty days from conception, one may still pray to affect the gender of the fetus.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>Is prayer effective</b> for that purpose? <b>Didn’t Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Ami, say:</b> The tradition teaches that the gender of the fetus is determined at the moment of conception. If the <b>man emits seed first,</b> his wife <b>gives birth to a female;</b> if the <b>woman emits seed first, she gives birth to a male, as it is stated: “When a woman emitted seed and bore a male”</b> (Leviticus 12:2). The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with a case where they both emit seed simultaneously.</b> In that case, the gender is undetermined and prayer may be effectual.

### Part 15
We learned in the mishna: <b>One who was walking along the way</b> and heard a scream from the city, and says: May it be God’s will that this scream will not be from my house, it is a vain prayer.

### Part 16
<b>The Sages taught: There was an incident involving Hillel the Elder, who was coming on the road when he heard a scream in the city. He said: I am certain that</b> the scream <b>is not</b> coming <b>from my house. And of him, the verse says: “He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord”</b> (Psalms 112:7). <b>Rava said: Any way that you interpret this verse,</b> its meaning is clear. <b>It</b> can be <b>interpreted from beginning to end</b> or <b>it</b> can be <b>interpreted from end to beginning.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>It</b> can be <b>interpreted from beginning to end: Why is it that: He shall not be afraid of evil tidings?</b> Because <b>his heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord.</b> The Gemara continues: <b>And it</b> can be <b>interpreted from end to beginning:</b> One whose <b>heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord</b> is a person who <b>shall not be afraid of evil tidings.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara relates: <b>This student was once walking after Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, in the marketplace of Zion.</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>saw that</b> the student <b>was afraid. He said to him: You are a sinner, as it is written: “The transgressors in Zion are afraid,</b> trembling has seized the ungodly” (Isaiah 33:14). The student <b>replied: And is it not written: “Happy is the man that fears always”</b> (Proverbs 28:14)? Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: That</b> verse <b>is written with regard to matters of Torah,</b> that one should be afraid lest he forget them. For everything else, one must trust in God.

### Part 18
In a similar vein, the Gemara relates: <b>Yehuda bar Natan was coming and going after Rav Hamnuna.</b> Yehuda bar Natan <b>sighed;</b> Rav Hamnuna <b>said to him: Do you wish to bring suffering upon yourself; as it is stated: “For that which I did fear is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of has overtaken me”</b> (Job 3:25)? He responded: <b>Is it not said: “Happy is the man who fears always”?</b> Rav Hamnuna answered: <b>That</b> verse <b>is written with regard to matters of Torah.</b>

### Part 19
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One who enters a large city</b> recites two prayers; Ben Azzai says he recites four prayers.

### Part 20
<b>The Sages taught</b> the details of Ben Azzai’s teaching in a <i>baraita</i>: <br><b>Upon his entrance</b> to the city <b>what does he recite?</b> <br><b>May it be Your will, O Lord my God, that You bring me into this city to peace.</b> <br>After <b>he entered</b> the city, <b>he recites: I thank You, O Lord my God</b>, <b>that You brought me into this city to peace.</b> <br>When he <b>seeks to leave</b> the city, <b>he recites: May it be Your will, O Lord my God and God of my ancestors, that You take me out of this city to peace.</b> <br>After <b>he left, he recites: I give thanks before You, O Lord my God, that You took me out of this city to peace;</b> <br><b>and just as You took me out to peace,</b> <br><b>so too lead me to peace, support me to peace, direct my steps to peace,</b> <br><b>and rescue me from the hand of any enemy or</b> those <b>lying in ambush along the way.</b>

### Part 21
<b>Rav Mattana said: This was taught only with regard to a city where</b> criminals <b>are not tried and executed,</b> as in a place like that he may be killed without trial. <b>However, in a city where</b> criminals <b>are tried and executed,</b> these prayers <b>do not apply,</b> as if one is not guilty he will not be harmed.

### Part 22
<b>Some say</b> that <b>Rav Mattana said</b> the opposite: <b>Even in a city where</b> criminals <b>are tried and executed</b> one must pray for mercy, <b>as sometimes he may not encounter a person who will plead in his favor.</b>

### Part 23
<b>The Sages taught: One who enters a</b> Roman <b>bathhouse,</b> where a fire burns beneath the pool of water used for bathing, and where there is the risk of collapse, <b>says:</b> <br><b>May it be Your will, O Lord my God, that you save me from this and similar</b> matters, <br><b>and do not let ruin or iniquity befall me,</b> <br><b>and if ruin or iniquity does befall me, let my death be atonement for all of my transgressions.</b>

### Part 24
<b>Abaye said: One should not say:</b> If ruin befalls me, <b>so as not to open his mouth to Satan</b> and provoke him. <b>As Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said and as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei: One should never open his mouth to Satan</b> by raising, at his own initiative, the possibility of mishap or death.

### Part 25
<b>Rav Yosef said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>As it is written: “We should have almost been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah”</b> (Isaiah 1:9), after which <b>what did</b> the prophet <b>reply to them? “Hear the word of the Lord, rulers of Sodom;</b> give ear unto the law of our God, people of Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:10). After the analogy to Sodom was raised, it was realized.

### Part 26
Returning to the subject of the Roman bathhouse, the Gemara asks: <b>When he emerges</b> from the bathhouse, <b>what does he say? Rav Aḥa said: I give thanks to You, Lord, that You saved me from the fire.</b>

### Part 27
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Abbahu entered a bathhouse when the bathhouse</b> floor <b>collapsed beneath him and a miracle transpired on his behalf. He stood on a pillar and saved one hundred and one men with one arm.</b> He held one or two people in his arm, with others holding on them and so on, so that all were saved. <b>He said: This is</b> confirmation of the statement <b>of Rav Aḥa,</b> who said that one should offer thanks upon leaving the bathhouse safely.

### Part 28
<b>As Rav Aḥa said: One who enters to let blood says:</b> <br><b>May it be Your will, O Lord my God,</b> <br><b>that this enterprise be for healing and that You should heal me.</b> <br><b>As You are a faithful God of healing and Your healing is truth.</b> <br><b>Because it is not the way of people to heal, but they have become accustomed.</b> <br>Rav Aḥa is saying that people should not practice medicine as they lack the ability to heal; rather, healing should be left to God.

### Part 29
<b>Abaye</b> responded and <b>said: One should not say this, as</b> it was <b>taught</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael</b> that from the verse, <b>“And shall cause him to be thoroughly healed”</b> (Exodus 21:19), <b>from here</b> we derive <b>that permission is granted to a doctor to heal.</b> The practice of medicine is in accordance with the will of God.

### Part 30
As for bloodletting, the Gemara asks: <b>When one stands</b> after having let blood, <b>what does he say? Rav Aḥa said:</b> He recites in gratitude: <b>Blessed…Who heals without payment.</b>
