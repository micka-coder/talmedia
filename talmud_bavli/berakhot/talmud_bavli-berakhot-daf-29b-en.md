### Part 1
<b>This</b> case, where we require him to return to the beginning of the prayer and repeat it, refers to a situation where <b>he recalls his error after</b> he reaches the blessing: <b>Who listens to prayer,</b> in which case the option of asking for rain in that blessing no longer exists and he must return to the beginning of the prayer.

### Part 2
On a similar note, the Gemara cites an additional statement of Rabbi Tanḥum. <b>Rabbi Tanḥum said</b> that <b>Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who erred and did not mention the New Moon,</b> the addition: May there rise and come [<i>ya’aleh veyavo</i>] <b>in the</b> blessing of Temple <b>service,</b> the seventeenth blessing in the <i>Amida</i> prayer, <b>he returns to the</b> blessing of Temple <b>service.</b> So too, if he <b>remembers during</b> the blessing of <b>thanksgiving, he returns to the</b> blessing of Temple <b>service.</b> If he remembers in the blessing: <b>Grant peace, he returns to the</b> blessing of Temple <b>service. If</b> he remembers after he <b>completed</b> the <i>Amida</i> prayer, <b>he returns to the beginning</b> of the prayer.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Pappa son of Rav Aḥa bar Adda said: That which we said</b> that if he already <b>finished</b> the <i>Amida</i> prayer <b>he returns to the beginning, we only said</b> that in a case <b>where he</b> already <b>moved his feet</b> from where he stood in prayer. <b>However,</b> if he <b>did not</b> yet <b>move his feet, he</b> need only <b>return to the</b> blessing of Temple <b>service,</b> and include the addition for the New Moon therein.

### Part 4
<b>He said to him: From where do you</b> derive <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>He said to him: My father my teacher told</b> it to <b>me and my father my teacher</b> heard it <b>from Rav.</b>

### Part 5
On a similar note, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: That which we said</b> that if he already <b>moved his feet he returns to the beginning, we only said</b> that in a case <b>where he is unaccustomed to reciting</b> additional <b>supplications after his prayer. However,</b> if <b>he is accustomed to reciting supplications after his prayer,</b> and while reciting them he remembers that he omitted mention of the New Moon from his prayer, <b>he</b> need only <b>return to the</b> blessing of Temple <b>service,</b> and he includes the addition for the New Moon therein.

### Part 6
<b>Some say, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: That which we said</b> that if he <b>did not</b> yet <b>move his feet, he</b> need only <b>return to the</b> blessing of Temple <b>service, we only said</b> that in a case <b>where he is accustomed to reciting</b> additional <b>supplications after his prayer. However,</b> if <b>he is unaccustomed to reciting supplications after his prayer, he must return to the beginning of the prayer,</b> as it is considered as if he already completed it.

### Part 7
We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One whose prayer is fixed, his prayer is not supplication.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>fixed</b> in this context? <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya said:</b> It means <b>anyone for whom his prayer is like a burden upon him,</b> from which he seeks to be quickly unburdened. <b>The Rabbis say:</b> This refers to <b>anyone who does not recite</b> prayer <b>in the language of supplication,</b> but as a standardized recitation without emotion. <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both said:</b> It refers to <b>anyone unable to introduce</b> a novel <b>element,</b> i.e., something personal reflecting his personal needs, to his prayer, and only recites the standard formula.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: I could introduce</b> a novel <b>element</b> in every prayer, but <b>I am afraid that perhaps I will</b> become <b>confused.</b> Consequently, there is no room to require the masses to introduce a novel element into their prayers.

### Part 9
The brothers, <b>Abaye bar Avin and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Avin, both said:</b> One whose prayer is fixed refers to <b>anyone who does not</b> make the effort to <b>pray with the reddening of the sun,</b> just after sunrise and just before sunset, which are auspicious times for prayer. As <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is a mitzva to pray with the reddening of the sun. And Rabbi Zeira said: What is the verse</b> that alludes to this? <b>“Let them fear You with the sun and before the moon, generation after generation”</b> (Psalms 72:5). Prayer, the manifestation of the fear of God, should be undertaken adjacent to sunrise and sunset. Nevertheless, <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they cursed one who prays with the reddening of the sun</b>, adjacent to sunset. <b>What is the reason? Perhaps,</b> due to preoccupation, he will become <b>confused about the hour</b> and the time for prayer will pass.

### Part 10
We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: One who is walking in a place of danger, recites a brief prayer…at <i>parashat ha’ibur</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b><i>parashat ha’ibur</i>? Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Mar Ukva said:</b> This can be interpreted in a manner underscoring two connotations of the term <i>ibur</i>: <b>Even at a time when You are as filled with anger [<i>evra</i>], towards them, as a pregnant woman [<i>ubara</i>], may all of their needs be before You. Some say</b> a different version of what <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Mar Ukva said: Even when they violate [<i>ovrim</i>] the commandments of the Torah, may all of their needs be before You.</b>

### Part 11
One formula for the prayer recited in places of danger is cited in the mishna. Additional formulas are cited in the <i>Tosefta</i>. <b>The Sages taught: One who walks in a place where there are groups of wild beasts and robbers recites an abbreviated prayer. Which is an abbreviated prayer? Rabbi Eliezer says, “Carry out Your will in the heavens above, and give peace of mind to those who fear You below, and perform that which is good in Your eyes. Blessed are You, Lord, Who listens to prayer.”</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> that he recites: <b>Hear the cry of Your nation, Israel, and quickly fulfill their request. Blessed are You, Lord, Who listens to prayer.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok says</b> that he recites: <b>Hear the shout of Your nation, Israel, and quickly fulfill their request. Blessed are You, Lord, Who listens to prayer.</b>

### Part 14
<b><i>Aḥerim</i> say</b> that he recites: <b>The needs of Your nation, Israel, are many and their intelligence is limited,</b> and, consequently, they are unable to effectively articulate their thoughts in prayer (Maharsha). So <b>may it be Your will, Lord our God, to provide each and every one with his necessary sustenance, and to each and every body all that it lacks. Blessed are You, Lord, Who listens to prayer.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rav Huna said: The <i>halakha</i></b> with regard to the version of the prayer recited in a place of danger <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>.</b>

### Part 16
On the topic of prayers recited while traveling and in times of danger, the Gemara discusses the traveler’s prayer. When he appeared to him, <b>Elijah</b> the Prophet <b>said to Rav Yehuda brother of Rav Sala Ḥasida: Do not get angry and you will not sin. Do not get drunk and you will not sin. And when you set out on a journey, consult with your Creator, and</b> then <b>set out. The Gemara asks: <b>What </b>is the meaning of: <b>Consult with your Creator, and </b>then <b>set out? </b>Rabbi Ya’akov said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said: That is the traveler’s prayer. And Rabbi Ya’akov said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is not only good advice, but established <i>halakha</i> that <b>anyone who sets out on a journey must recite the traveler’s prayer</b> prior to embarking on his journey.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the formula for <b>the traveler’s prayer?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>May it be Your will, Lord my God, to lead me to peace, direct my steps to peace, and guide me to peace, and rescue me from the hands of any enemy or ambush along the way, and send blessing to the work of my hands, and let me find grace, kindness, and compassion in Your eyes and in the eyes of all who see me. Blessed are You, Lord, Who hears prayer.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Abaye said: At all times</b>
