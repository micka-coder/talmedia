### Part 1
<b>and</b> this <i>Tosefta</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, who said,</b> with regard to the Divine Voice that emerged and proclaimed that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer in the case of the oven of <i>akhnai</i> (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 59b), that <b>one disregards a Heavenly Voice.</b> Just as he disregarded the Divine Voice in his dispute with Rabbi Eliezer, so too, one disregards the Divine Voice that proclaimed that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel.

### Part 2
As to the substance of these statements, the Gemara asks: <b>Do Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>the blessing over the day takes precedence? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who enters his house at the conclusion of Shabbat recites a blessing over the wine,</b> then over <b>the candle,</b> then over <b>the spices, and recites <i>havdala</i> thereafter? And if he has only one cup</b> of wine, <b>he leaves it for after the</b> last Shabbat <b>meal and arranges all</b> of the blessings: Grace after Meals, the blessings of <i>havdala</i> and the blessing over wine <b>together thereafter.</b> Evidently, the blessing over wine precedes the primary <i>havdala</i> blessing.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And this</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>from where</b> is it ascertained <b>that it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai? Perhaps it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel.</b> Beit Shammai’s opinion cannot be challenged with an unattributed <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 4
The Gemara responds: <b>It cannot enter your mind</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel, <b>as it was taught</b> at the beginning of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Light</b> and <b>spices thereafter. And who, did you hear, adopts that reasoning? Beit Shammai. As it was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not dispute that</b> Grace after <b>Meals is</b> recited <b>first and that <i>havdala</i> is</b> recited <b>last. With regard to what did they disagree?</b> With regard to the blessings recited in the middle of <i>havdala</i>, the blessings <b>over the light and over the spices. Beit Shammai say: Light and spices thereafter; and Beit Hillel say: Spices and light thereafter.</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i>, where it is taught that the blessing over the candle precedes the blessing over the spices, must be according to Beit Shammai and it says that wine precedes <i>havdala</i>.

### Part 5
The Gemara presents another challenge: <b>And from where</b> do you ascertain <b>that this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai in accordance with</b> the interpretation of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? Perhaps it is</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel in accordance with</b> the interpretation of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara responds: <b>It cannot enter your mind</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is the opinion of Beit Hillel in accordance with the interpretation of Rabbi Meir. <b>As it was taught here in the mishna,</b> which like all unattributed <i>mishnayot</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir: <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> One recites the blessing over the <b>candle,</b> then the Grace after <b>Meals</b> blessing, then the blessing over the <b>spices,</b> and finally the blessing of <b><i>havdala</i>. And Beit Hillel say:</b> The order is <b>candle, spices,</b> Grace after <b>Meals, and <i>havdala</i>. And there, in the <i>baraita</i>, it was taught: And if he has only one cup</b> of wine, <b>he leaves it for after the</b> last Shabbat <b>meal and arranges all</b> of the blessings: Grace after Meals, the blessings of <i>havdala</i>, and the blessing over wine <b>together thereafter.</b> According to the <i>baraita</i>, all of the blessings follow Grace after Meals. Since the <i>baraita</i> and the mishna do not correspond, <b>conclude from here</b> that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, in accordance with</b> the interpretation of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And, nevertheless,</b> after the Gemara has proven that the <i>baraita</i> corresponds to the opinion of Beit Shammai as interpreted by Rabbi Yehuda, the contradiction between Beit Shammai’s statement in the <i>baraita</i> and their statement in the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>is difficult.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>the arrival of the day</b> of Shabbat or a Festival <b>is different from the departure of the day.</b> As with regard to <b>the arrival of the day, the more that we can advance it, the better;</b> with regard to <b>the departure of the day, the more we postpone it, the better, so that</b> Shabbat <b>should not be like a burden to us.</b> Consequently, although Beit Shammai situate <i>kiddush</i> before the blessing over the wine, they agree that one should recite <i>havdala</i> after the blessing over the wine.

### Part 8
The above discussion referred to Beit Shammai’s opinion with regard to Grace after Meals recited over a cup of wine. The Gemara poses the question: <b>And do Beit Shammai hold</b> that <b>Grace after Meals requires a cup</b> of wine? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>Wine came before</b> the diners <b>after the meal; if only that cup</b> of wine <b>is there, Beit Shammai say: One recites a blessing over the wine and recites a blessing over the food,</b> Grace after Meals, <b>thereafter. What? Is it not that he recites a blessing over</b> the wine <b>and drinks it,</b> leaving Grace after Meals without wine? The Gemara rejects this: <b>No.</b> The mishna means that <b>he recites a blessing over</b> the cup of wine <b>and leaves it</b> to drink from it after Grace after Meals.

### Part 9
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Didn’t the Master say</b> that <b>one who recites a blessing is required to taste?</b> The Gemara answers: Indeed, this refers to a case <b>where he tasted it.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Didn’t the Master say</b> that one who <b>tasted</b> the cup of wine <b>disqualified it</b> and it is no longer suitable to be used for a cup of blessing? The Gemara answers: This does not refer to a case where he drank the wine; but rather, where <b>he tasted it with his hand</b> or poured a bit into another cup and drank from it.

### Part 10
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Didn’t the Master say: A cup of blessing requires</b> a minimum <b>measure</b> of wine? By drinking the wine, <b>doesn’t he diminish</b> the cup <b>from</b> containing <b>its</b> minimum <b>measure?</b> The Gemara answers: This refers to a case where <b>the cup contained more than the</b> required <b>measure</b> of wine.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> explicitly: <b>If he has only one cup</b> of wine? If there is more than the required measure of wine, he does not have only one cup. The Gemara responds: Indeed, <b>there are not two</b> cups, <b>but</b> there is <b>more than one.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Shammai say: He recites a blessing over the wine and drinks it, and recites Grace after Meals thereafter?</b> Evidently, according to Beit Shammai, wine is not required for Grace after Meals. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>two <i>tanna’im</i></b> hold <b>in accordance with Beit Shammai</b> and differ with regard to their opinion.

### Part 13
We learned in our mishna that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree over whether the washing of the hands or mixing water with the wine takes precedence. <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> One washes his hands and mixes water with the wine in the cup thereafter, and Beit Hillel say: One mixes water with the wine in the cup and only washes his hands thereafter.

### Part 14
<b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>Tosefta</i> where this issue is discussed in greater detail: <b>Beit Shammai say: One washes</b> his <b>hands and mixes water</b> with the wine <b>in the cup thereafter, as if you say</b> that <b>one mixes water</b> with the wine <b>in the cup first,</b> his hands will remain ritually impure, as the Sages <b>decreed</b> that unwashed hands have second degree ritual impurity status as if they touched something rendered ritually impure by a creeping animal. Consequently, there is room for concern that <b>the liquid that</b> inevitably drips <b>on the outside of the cup might become ritually impure due to his hands, and</b> those liquids <b>will in turn render the cup ritually impure.</b> Consequently, Beit Shammai said that the hands must be washed first in order to prevent that result.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: If the concern is with regard to ritual impurity to the cup, why mention the liquids on the outside of the cup? <b>Let</b> his <b>hands render the cup ritually impure</b> directly.

### Part 16
The Gemara answers: <b>Hands have second</b> degree ritual impurity status, <b>and</b> there is a general halakhic principle that an object of <b>second</b> degree ritual impurity status <b>cannot confer third</b> degree ritual impurity status <b>upon non-sacred items,</b> as opposed to <i>teruma</i> or consecrated food, <b>except by means of liquids.</b> By rabbinic decree, liquids that come into contact with second degree ritual impurity assume first degree ritual impurity status and, consequently, can render non-sacred items impure.

### Part 17
<b>And Beit Hillel say: One mixes water</b> with the wine <b>in the cup and</b> only <b>washes</b> his <b>hands thereafter, as if you say</b> that <b>one washes</b> his <b>hands first,</b> there is <b>a decree lest the liquid</b> from the outside of the cup that dampened <b>one’s hands will be rendered ritually impure due to the cup</b> which is liable to be impure, <b>and</b> the liquid <b>will in turn render his hands ritually impure.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>Let the cup render</b> his <b>hands ritually impure</b> directly, without any liquid? The Gemara responds that, according to a general principle in the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity, <b>a vessel does not render a person ritually impure.</b> The cup alone does not render his hands ritually impure.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: If the back of the cup is ritually impure, <b>let it render the liquids that are within</b> the cup <b>ritually impure?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with a vessel</b> that only <b>the outside of which has been rendered ritually impure by liquids</b> by rabbinic law and not by Torah law. In that case, <b>the inside</b> of the cup <b>is pure and the outside is impure. As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>A vessel whose outer side is rendered ritually impure by liquid,</b> only <b>the outer side</b> of the vessel <b>is impure,</b>
