### Part 1
<b>The Sages taught: One who sees the sun in</b> the beginning of <b>its cycle, the moon in its might, the planets in their orbit, or the signs of the zodiac</b> aligned <b>in their order recites: Blessed…Author of creation.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And when is it</b> that the sun is at the beginning of its cycle? <b>Abaye said: Every twenty-eight years</b> when the <b>cycle</b> is complete and <b>returns</b> to its genesis, <b>and the Nisan,</b> vernal, <b>equinox,</b> when the spring days and nights are of equal length, <b>falls within</b> the constellation of <b>Saturn on the night of the third and eve of the fourth</b> day of the week, as then their arrangement returns to be as it was when the constellations were first placed in the heavens.

### Part 2
We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: One who sees the great sea</b> intermittently <b>recites:</b> Blessed…Who has made the great sea. The Gemara asks: <b>How much</b> is <b>intermittently? Rami bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak said: Thirty days.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And Rami bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak said: One who sees the Euphrates River near the bridge of Babylonia recites: Blessed…Author of creation.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>And now that the Persians have rerouted</b> the course of the river, one only recites the blessing <b>from Beit Shavor upriver.</b> Downriver, it no longer flows as it did at creation, so there one does not recite the blessing: Author of creation. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> One only recites the blessing <b>from Ihi Dekira upriver. And Rami bar Abba said: One who sees the Tigris on the bridge of Shabistana recites: Blessed…Author of creation.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara proceeds to explain the names of these rivers. <b>What is</b> the source of the name <b><i>Ḥidekel</i> [</b>Tigris]? <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> Its name is an acronym derived from the fact that <b>its waters are sharp [<i>ḥadin</i>] and light [<i>kalin</i>]</b> and therefore good for drinking. <b>What is</b> the source of the name <b><i>Perat</i></b> [Euphrates]? It is so named <b>because its waters are fruitful [<i>parin</i>] and multiply [<i>ravin</i>];</b> there are many fish in it.

### Part 5
As for the Tigris River, <b>Rava said: The inhabitants</b> of the city <b>Meḥoza are sharp because they drink the water of the Tigris; they are red because they engage in</b> conjugal <b>relations in the daytime; and their eyes move</b> constantly <b>because they live in dark houses.</b>

### Part 6
We learned in our mishna that <b>over rain</b> one recites the blessing: Blessed…Who is good and does good. The Gemara asks: <b>And over rain</b> does <b>one</b> really <b>recite the blessing: Who is good and does good? Didn’t Rabbi Abbahu say, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: From when does one recite the blessing on rain? From when the groom went out to meet the bride.</b> In other words, there are puddles of water on the ground. The groom, meaning the raindrops from above, cause the bride, meaning the water below, to splash.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>What blessing does one recite? Rav Yehuda said:</b> The formula of the blessing is: <b>We thank You for each and every drop that You have made fall for us. And Rav Yoḥanan concludes</b> the blessing <b>as follows: If our mouths were as full of song as the sea…we could not sufficiently praise You O Lord our God,</b> and he continues with the formula of <i>nishmat</i> that is recited on Shabbat morning, <b>until: Shall bow</b> before You. <b>Blessed are You, O Lord,</b> to Whom <b>abundant thanksgivings</b> are offered.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: Does the blessing say: <b>Abundant thanksgivings, and not: All thanksgivings?</b> Certainly all thanksgivings are due to God. <b>Rava said:</b> Emend the formula of the blessing and <b>say: The God of thanksgivings. Rav Pappa said: Therefore, we will recite them both: Abundant thanksgivings, and: The God of thanksgivings.</b>

### Part 9
<b>However, it is</b> still <b>difficult,</b> as apparently the blessing for rain is not: Who is good and does good, as it appears in our mishna. The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult. This,</b> which we learned in our mishna, that one recites: Who is good and does good, refers to a case <b>where one heard</b> that rain fell. <b>This,</b> where we learned that one recites: We thank You, etc., refers to a case <b>where one saw</b> the rain fall.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>One heard</b> that the rain fell; <b>that is</b> a case of <b>good tidings. And we learned</b> in the mishna <b>that upon</b> hearing <b>good tidings one recites: Who is good and does good.</b> Therefore, there is no reason for the mishna to mention rain separately.

### Part 11
<b>Rather,</b> the difficulty can be otherwise resolved: <b>This,</b> Rabbi Abbahu’s statement, <b>and that,</b> the mishna, both refer to a case where one saw the rain fall, <b>and</b> this is <b>not difficult. This,</b> Rabbi Abbahu’s statement that one recites We thank You, etc., <b>refers to</b> a case <b>where a little</b> rain <b>fell,</b> while <b>that,</b> the mishna which says that one recites: Who is good and does good, refers to a case <b>where a lot</b> of rain <b>fell. And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this and that</b> refer to cases <b>where a lot</b> of rain <b>fell, and</b> this is <b>not difficult. This,</b> the mishna, <b>refers to</b> a case <b>where one owns land,</b> while <b>that,</b> Rabbi Abbahu’s statement that one recites: We thank You, etc., <b>refers to</b> a case <b>where one does not own land,</b> so the rain does not benefit him directly.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>One who owns land recites: Who is good and does good? Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>One who built a new house or purchased new vessels recites: Blessed…Who has given us life…and brought us to this time.</b> However, if the land belonged <b>to him and others</b> in partnership, <b>he recites: Who is good and does good?</b> For rain falling onto land that one owns exclusively, he recites: Who has given us life and not: Who is good and does good.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This,</b> the mishna where we learned that one recites: Who is good and does good, <b>refers to</b> a case <b>where one</b> owns his land <b>in partnership</b> with another; <b>that,</b> Rabbi Abbahu’s statement that one recites: Who has given us life, <b>refers to</b> a case <b>where one</b> owns the land exclusively and <b>does not have a partnership. And</b> indeed, this <i>halakha</i> <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The gist of the matter is, for</b> that which <b>is</b> exclusively <b>his, he recites: Blessed…Who has given us life and sustained us; for</b> that which <b>belongs to him and to another</b> in partnership, <b>he recites: Who is good and does good.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara challenges this principle: <b>And in every case where others are not with him, one does not recite: Who is good and does good? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If they told him that his wife gave birth to a male, he recites: Who is good and does good?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>There too, his wife is with him, as she is also happy that a male</b> child was born.

### Part 15
The Gemara challenges further: <b>Come and hear</b> a contradiction from what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: One whose <b>father died and he is his heir, initially recites: Blessed…the true Judge,</b> upon hearing of his father’s death, <b>and ultimately,</b> upon receiving his inheritance, <b>he recites: Blessed…Who is good and does good.</b> Despite the fact that the son alone benefits, he nevertheless recites: Who is good and does good. The Gemara responds: <b>There, too,</b> it refers to a case <b>where he has brothers who inherit along with him.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara cites an additional challenge: <b>Come and hear</b> a contradiction based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a change in</b> the type of <b>wine</b> during a meal, <b>one need not recite the blessing:</b> Who creates fruit of the vine, a second time. However, in the case of <b>a change in place, one must recite a</b> second <b>blessing</b> over the wine. <b>And Rabbi Yosef bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Although</b> the Sages <b>said that</b> in the case of <b>a change in</b> the type of <b>wine one need not recite a</b> second <b>blessing</b> over the wine, <b>he does recite: Blessed…Who is good and does good.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>There, too,</b> it refers to a case where he is not alone, but where <b>members of the group are drinking with him.</b>

### Part 17
We learned in the mishna: One who <b>built a new house or purchased new vessels</b> recites: Blessed…Who has given us life, sustained us and brought us to this time. With regard to this blessing, <b>Rav Huna said: They only taught</b> that one recites: Who has given us life, upon purchasing a new vessel when <b>he does not</b> already <b>have something similar,</b> i.e., something he inherited. <b>However, if he</b> already <b>has something similar he need not recite a blessing,</b> as it is not new to him. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even</b> if <b>one</b> already <b>has something similar</b> that he inherited, <b>he must recite a blessing</b> because he never before purchased a vessel of that kind.
