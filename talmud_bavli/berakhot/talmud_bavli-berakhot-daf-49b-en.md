<b>and he returned to the beginning</b> of Grace after Meals and repeated it. Giddel bar Manyumi <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>Why did the master act in that manner? He said: As Rabbi Sheila said</b> that <b>Rav said: If one erred, he returns to the beginning.</b>

### Part 2
Giddel bar Manyumi challenged: <b>Didn’t Rav Huna say</b> that <b>Rav said: If one erred, he recites: Blessed…Who gave?</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Wasn’t it stated about this</b> that <b>Rabbi Menashya bar Taḥlifa said</b> that <b>Rav said: They only taught that</b> one recites the short blessing in a case where <b>he did not</b> yet <b>begin</b> reciting: <b>Who is good and does good; however,</b> if <b>he</b> already <b>began</b> reciting: <b>Who is good and does good, he must return to the beginning</b> of Grace after Meals?

### Part 3
<b>Rav Idi bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rav Amram said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: If one erred and did not mention the</b> formula for the <b>New Moon in his</b> <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer, we require him to return</b> to the beginning of the prayer and repeat it. However, if one erred and forgot to mention the New Moon <b>in Grace after Meals, we do not require him to return</b> to the beginning and repeat it.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Avin said to Rav Amram</b> about this: <b>What is the difference between</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer and Grace after Meals? He said to him: That</b> question <b>was also difficult for me and I asked Rav Naḥman</b> about <b>it, and he said to me: I did not hear</b> the reason <b>from Mar Shmuel</b> himself, <b>but let us see</b> if we can analyze it ourselves. For the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer, which is an obligation, we require him to return</b> to the beginning of the prayer and repeat it. For <b>Grace after Meals, which</b> is not an obligation, as <b>if he wants</b> to eat, <b>he eats and if he wants</b> not to eat, <b>he does not eat, we do not require him to return</b> to the beginning and repeat it. Grace after Meals is not a full-fledged obligation; it is dependent upon eating, which is optional. Consequently, failure to mention the New Moon in Grace after Meals is not a source of concern.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, on Shabbatot and Festivals,</b> when there is a mitzva to eat and <b>when it is not possible to refrain from eating,</b> there <b>too, if he erred</b> and failed to mention them in Grace after Meals, would you say that <b>he must return</b> to the beginning and repeat it? <b>He said: Yes. As Rabbi Sheila said</b> that <b>Rav said: If one erred, he returns to the beginning</b> of Grace after Meals. The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t Rav Huna say</b> that <b>Rav said: If one erred, he recites: Blessed…Who gave?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>Wasn’t it stated about this: They only taught that</b> one recites the short blessing in a case where <b>he did not</b> yet <b>begin</b> reciting: <b>Who is good and does good; however,</b> if <b>he</b> already <b>began</b> reciting: <b>Who is good and does good, he must return to the beginning</b> of Grace after Meals.

### Part 6
There is a dispute in the mishna: <b>How much</b> must one eat <b>to obligate</b> those with whom they ate <b>in a <i>zimmun</i>?</b> An olive-bulk; Rabbi Yehuda says: An egg-bulk.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that Rabbi Meir considers an olive-bulk significant and Rabbi Yehuda considers an egg-bulk significant? Didn’t we hear them</b> say <b>the opposite</b> elsewhere? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>And similarly, one who left Jerusalem and remembered that there was consecrated meat in his hand,</b> which may not be removed from Jerusalem, <b>if he passed</b> Mount <b>Scopus,</b> or anywhere that is a comparable distance from the Temple Mount, <b>he burns</b> the sanctified meat <b>at the site</b> where <b>he</b> is located; <b>and if</b> he has <b>not</b> yet traveled that distance, <b>he must return to burn it before the Temple with the wood of the arrangement</b> that was designated for burning consecrated items that were disqualified.

### Part 8
The mishna continues: <b>How much</b> meat must be in their possession in order to obligate <b>them to return? Rabbi Meir says:</b> One must return <b>for an egg-bulk of this,</b> sanctified meat, <b>and that,</b> leaven mentioned there previously. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One must return <b>for an olive-bulk of this and that.</b> Their opinions there seem to contradict their opinions in our mishna.

### Part 9
To resolve this contradiction, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The opinions are reversed</b> in one of these sources and must be emended. <b>Abaye said: Actually do not reverse</b> them. <b>Here,</b> with regard to <i>zimmun</i>, <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the interpretation of <b>verses. Rabbi Meir holds: “And you shall eat,” that is eating; “and be satisfied,” that is drinking</b> after eating. The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the standard halakhic principle that <b>eating</b> is defined as the consumption of <b>an olive-bulk. And Rabbi Yehuda holds: “And you shall eat and be satisfied,”</b> refers to <b>eating that includes satisfaction. And what is</b> considered eating with satisfaction? The consumption of <b>an egg-bulk.</b>

### Part 10
On the other hand, <b>there,</b> in the case of leaven and sanctified foods, <b>they disagree</b> not with regard to the interpretation of verses, but <b>with regard to logical reasoning. Rabbi Meir holds:</b> The requirement to <b>return</b> consecrated food <b>is analogous to its ritual impurity, and just as its</b> susceptibility to <b>ritual impurity is</b> only when it is the size of an <b>egg-bulk, so too,</b> the requirement to <b>return it is</b> only when it is the size of an <b>egg-bulk. And Rabbi Yehuda holds:</b> The requirement to <b>return</b> consecrated food <b>is analogous to its prohibition, and just as its prohibition is</b> only when it is the size of an <b>olive-bulk, so too,</b> the requirement to <b>return it is</b> only when it is the size of an <b>olive-bulk.</b>

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna delineates distinctions in the <i>halakhot</i> of the <i>zimmun</i> blessing, based on the number of people present. <b>How does one recite the <i>zimmun</i>? In</b> a group of <b>three</b> people, the one reciting the <i>zimmun</i> <b>says: Let us bless</b> the One from Whose food we have eaten. <b>In</b> a group of <b>three</b> people <b>and him,</b> the one reciting the <i>zimmun</i> <b>says: Bless</b> the One from Whose food we have eaten, as even without him there are enough people to recite the <i>zimmun</i>.

### Part 12
With the increase in the number of participants, the blessing is more complex. <b>In</b> a group of <b>ten</b> people, the one reciting the <i>zimmun</i> <b>says: Let us bless our God. In</b> a group of <b>ten</b> people <b>and him,</b> the one reciting the <i>zimmun</i> <b>says: Bless</b> our God. This formula is recited <b>both</b> in a group of <b>ten and in</b> a group of <b>one hundred thousand.</b>

### Part 13
<b>In</b> a group of <b>one hundred</b> people, the one reciting the <i>zimmun</i> <b>says: Let us bless the Lord our God. In</b> a group of <b>one hundred</b> people <b>and him,</b> the one reciting the <i>zimmun</i> <b>says: Bless</b> the Lord our God. <b>In</b> a group of <b>one thousand</b> people, the one reciting the <i>zimmun</i> <b>says: Let us bless the Lord our God, the God of Israel. In</b> a group of <b>one thousand</b> people <b>and him, he says: Bless</b> the Lord our God, the God of Israel. <b>In</b> a group of <b>ten thousand</b> people, the one reciting the <i>zimmun</i> <b>says: Let us bless the Lord our God, the God of Israel, the God of Hosts, Who sits upon the cherubs, for the food that we have eaten. In</b> a group of <b>ten thousand</b> people <b>and him,</b> the one reciting the <i>zimmun</i> <b>says: Bless</b> the Lord our God, the God of Israel, the God of Hosts, Who sits upon the cherubs, for the food that we have eaten.

### Part 14
The principle is that <b>just as he recites the blessing, so too</b> those present <b>recite in response: Blessed be the Lord our God, the God of Israel, the God of Hosts, Who sits upon the cherubs, for the food that we have eaten.</b>

### Part 15
On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: According to the size of the crowd, they recite the blessing, as it is stated: “Bless you God in full assemblies, even the Lord, you who are from the fountain of Israel”</b> (Psalms 68:27). <b>Rabbi Akiva said</b> that there are no distinctions based on the size of the crowd: <b>What do we find in the synagogue? Both</b> when there are <b>many and</b> when there are <b>few,</b> as long as there is a quorum of ten, the prayer leader <b>says: Bless [<i>barekhu</i>] the Lord. Rabbi Yishmael said</b> that in the synagogue, one recites: <b>Bless the Lord the blessed One.</b>

### Part 16
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Shmuel said: One should never exclude himself from the collective.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara raises a challenge from what <b>we learned</b> in our mishna: <b>In</b> a group of <b>three</b> people <b>and him,</b> the one reciting the <i>zimmun</i> <b>says: Bless</b> the One from Whose food we have eaten. He thereby excludes himself from the collective.

### Part 18
The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the meaning of the mishna is:
