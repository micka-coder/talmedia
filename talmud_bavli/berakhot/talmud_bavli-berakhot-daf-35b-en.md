### Part 1
and <b>here,</b> where it says that He gave the earth to mankind refers to <b>after a blessing</b> is recited.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: Anyone who derives benefit from this world without a blessing, it is as if he stole from God and the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Whoever robs his father and his mother and says: It is no transgression, he is the companion of a destroyer”</b> (Proverbs 28:24). The phrase, <b>his father, refers to none other than God, as it is stated: “Is He not your Father Who created you,</b> Who made you and established you” (Deuteronomy 32:6). The phrase <b>his mother refers to none other than the community of Israel, as it is stated: “Hear, my son, the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the Torah of your mother”</b> (Proverbs 1:8). The mention of the Torah as emanating from the mouth of the mother, apparently means that your mother is the community of Israel.

### Part 3
<b>What</b> is the meaning of the continuation of the verse: <b>He is the companion of a destroyer? Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said:</b> He is <b>a companion of Jeroboam ben Nevat, who corrupted Israel before their Father in heaven</b> by sinning and causing others to sin.

### Part 4
On a similar note, the Gemara cites that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa raised a contradiction: It is written, “I will take back My grain at its time</b> and wine in its season” (Hosea 2:11), <b>and it is written: “And you shall gather your grain,</b> your wine and your oil” (Deuteronomy 11:14). To whom does the grain belong: To God, or to the people?

### Part 5
The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where God promises Israel that they will gather their grain, the verse refers to <b>a time when they perform God’s will. Here,</b> where the verse indicates that the grain belongs to God, it refers to <b>a time when they do not perform God’s will,</b> as then He will take back the grain, demonstrating that it belongs to Him.

### Part 6
<b>The Sages taught: What</b> is the meaning of that which <b>the verse states: “And you shall gather your grain”? Because it is stated: “This Torah shall not depart from your mouths,</b> and you shall contemplate in it day and night” (Joshua 1:8), <b>I might</b> have thought <b>that these matters are</b> to be understood <b>as they are written;</b> one is to literally spend his days immersed exclusively in Torah study. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall gather your grain,</b> your wine and your oil,” <b>assume in their</b> regard, <b>the way of the world;</b> set aside time not only for Torah, but also for work. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Is it possible that a person plows in the plowing season and sows in the sowing season and harvests in the harvest season and threshes in the threshing season and winnows in the windy season,</b> as grain is separated from the chaff by means of the wind, and is constantly busy; <b>what will become of Torah? Rather,</b> one must dedicate himself exclusively to Torah at the expense of other endeavors; as <b>when Israel performs God’s will, their work is performed by others, as it is stated: “And strangers will stand and feed your flocks,</b> and foreigners will be your plowmen and your vinedressers” (Isaiah 61:5). <b>When Israel does not perform God’s will, their work is performed by them</b> themselves, as it is stated: <b>“And you shall gather your grain.” Moreover,</b> if Israel fails to perform God’s will, <b>others’ work will be performed by them, as it is stated: “You shall serve your enemy</b> whom God shall send against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness and in want of all things” (Deuteronomy 28:48).

### Part 8
Summing up this dispute, <b>Abaye said:</b> Although there is room for both opinions, <b>many have acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> and combined working for a living and learning Torah, <b>and</b> although they engaged in activities other than the study of Torah, <b>were successful</b> in their Torah study. <b>Many have acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai and were not successful</b> in their Torah study. They were ultimately forced to abandon their Torah study altogether.

### Part 9
Similarly, <b>Rava said to the Sages</b> who would attend his study hall: <b>I implore you; during</b> the months of <b>Nisan and Tishrei,</b> the crucial agricultural periods, <b>do not appear before me.</b> Engage in your agricultural work then <b>so that you will not be preoccupied with your sustenance all year.</b>

### Part 10
Summarizing these statements, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi El’ai: Come and see that the latter generations are not like the earlier generations;</b> rather they are their inferiors. <b>The earlier generations made their Torah permanent and their work occasional,</b> and <b>this,</b> Torah study, <b>and that,</b> their work, <b>were successful for them.</b> However, <b>the latter generations who made their work permanent and their Torah occasional, neither this nor that was successful for them.</b>

### Part 11
Along these lines, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi El’ai: Come and see that the latter generations are not like the earlier generations.</b> In the <b>earlier generations,</b> people <b>would bring their fruits into their courtyards through the main gate in order to obligate them in tithes.</b> However, <b>the latter generations bring their fruits through roofs, through courtyards and through enclosed courtyards,</b> avoiding the main gate <b>in order to exempt them from</b> the mitzva of <b>tithing. As Rabbi Yannai said: Untithed produce is not obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>tithing until it sees the front of the house</b> through which people enter and exit, and it is brought into the house that way <b>as it is stated</b> in the formula of the confession of the tithes: <b>“I have removed the consecrated from the house”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:13), as the obligation to tithe produce whose purpose has not yet been designated takes effect only when it is brought into the house.

### Part 12
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even</b> bringing it into the <b>courtyard determines</b> its status as having completed the production process and obligates the produce to be tithed, <b>as it is written</b> in the confession of the tithes: “And I have given to the Levite, the stranger, the orphan and the widow, <b>and they shall eat in your gates and be satisfied”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:12).

### Part 13
We learned in our mishna: Over fruits that grow on a tree one recites: Who creates fruit of the tree, <b>with the exception of wine</b> that even though it originates from fruit of the tree, a separate blessing was established for it: Who creates the fruit of the vine. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>wine,</b> that a separate blessing was established for it? <b>If you say that because the fruit changed for the better</b> into wine, therefore, <b>the blessing changed.</b> Olive <b>oil changed for the better and</b> nevertheless, <b>its blessing did not change. As Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said, and so too Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Over olive oil, one recites: Who creates fruit of the tree,</b> just as he does over the fruit itself.

### Part 14
The Sages <b>said: There,</b> in the case of oil, <b>it is because it is impossible</b> to find an appropriate blessing, as <b>how shall we recite the blessing?</b> If <b>we recite the blessing: Who creates fruit of the olive, the fruit itself is called olive</b> and that is what was created. The oil is a man-made product of that fruit, rendering that formula inappropriate. Similarly, reciting a formula parallel to the blessing on wine: Who creates the fruit of the vine, is inappropriate as the grapes themselves are the fruit that was created, as opposed to oil which was not.

### Part 15
The Gemara challenges: Nevertheless, it is still possible to formulate a blessing, <b>as we may recite the blessing: Who creates fruit of the olive tree,</b> which would be parallel to the blessing recited over wine. <b>Rather, Mar Zutra offered</b> a different rationale: The reason that no separate blessing was established over oil is because, as opposed to <b>wine</b> that <b>nourishes, oil does not nourish.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And oil does not nourish? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>One who vows that nourishment</b> is forbidden to him <b>is permitted</b> to eat <b>water and salt,</b> as they are not considered nourishment. <b>And we discussed this</b> <i>halakha</i>: By inference, <b>water and salt are not considered nourishment, but all</b> other edible <b>items are considered nourishment.</b>

### Part 17
<b>Let us say that this is a conclusive refutation of Rav and Shmuel, who said: One only recites: Who creates various kinds of nourishment, over the five species</b> of grain <b>alone,</b> as they alone are considered nourishing. <b>And Rav Huna said</b> as a solution that this mishna referred to a case <b>where</b> he vows <b>and says: Anything that nourishes</b> is prohibited <b>to me.</b> That formula includes anything that is at all nourishing and therefore only water and salt are excluded. Olive oil is not excluded.

### Part 18
<b>Apparently, oil nourishes. Rather,</b> there is another distinction between wine and oil: <b>Wine satisfies, oil does not satisfy.</b> Wine not only nourishes, but it is also filling. The Gemara asks: <b>And does wine satisfy? Wouldn’t Rava drink wine all</b> day on <b>the eve of Passover in order to stimulate his heart,</b> i.e., whet his appetite <b>so that he might eat more <i>matza</i></b> at the seder? Wine does not satisfy, it whets the appetite. The Gemara answers: <b>A lot</b> of wine <b>stimulates, a little satisfies.</b>

### Part 19
Again, the Gemara asks: <b>Does</b> wine <b>satisfy at all? Isn’t it written: “Wine gladdens the heart of man,</b> making the face brighter than oil, <b>and bread fills man’s heart”</b> (Psalms 104:15); <b>bread is that which satisfies, wine does not satisfy. Rather,</b> this verse is not a proof; <b>wine has two</b> advantages, <b>it satisfies and gladdens. Bread,</b> however, <b>satisfies but does not gladden.</b>

### Part 20
Since wine possesses all of these virtues, the Gemara asks: <b>If so, let us recite</b> the <b>three blessings</b> of Grace after Meals <b>over it</b> after drinking, just as we do after eating bread. The Gemara answers: <b>People do not base their meals on</b> wine.

### Part 21
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: If one based his meal on it, what is the</b> ruling? Must he recite the Grace after Meals as he does after bread? He replied: <b>When Elijah comes and says whether</b> or not <b>it can serve as the basis</b> for a meal, this will be resolved. <b>Nevertheless, now,</b> until then, <b>his intention is</b> rendered <b>irrelevant by</b> the opinions of <b>all other men</b> and he is not required to recite the complete Grace after Meals.

### Part 22
Previously, the Gemara cited the <i>halakha</i> that one recites the blessing: Who creates fruit of the tree, over olive oil. The Gemara discusses <b>the matter itself. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said, and so too Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One recites the blessing: Who creates fruit of the tree, over olive oil</b> just as he does over the fruit itself. <b>What are the circumstances? If you say that he drank it</b> plain, <b>it causes damage to</b> the drinker. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who drinks oil of <i>teruma</i>,</b> while unaware that it was <i>teruma</i>, <b>pays the principal and does not pay</b> the additional <b>fifth</b> which is the typical penalty for unintentional misuse of consecrated property, as in that case the individual is considered to have only damaged consecrated property without deriving benefit from it. <b>One who anoints</b> his body <b>with the oil of <i>teruma</i> pays the principal and pays the fifth,</b> as he derived benefit from it. Apparently, one who drinks oil derives no benefit and it even causes him damage.

### Part 23
<b>Rather,</b> it is referring to a case where <b>he eats</b> the oil <b>by</b> dipping <b>bread</b> into it. <b>If so,</b> the <b>bread is primary and</b> the oil <b>secondary, and we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>This is the principle: Any</b> food <b>that is primary, and</b> is eaten <b>with</b> food that is <b>secondary, one recites a blessing over the primary</b> food, and that blessing <b>exempts the secondary</b> from the requirement to recite a blessing before eating it. A blessing need only be recited over the bread, not over the oil. <b>Rather,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he is drinking it by means of an <i>anigeron</i>, as Rabba bar Shmuel said: <i>Anigeron</i></b> is <b>water</b> in which a <b>beet</b> was boiled, <b><i>ansigeron</i></b> is <b>the water</b>
