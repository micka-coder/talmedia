### Part 1
There is a <b>contradiction</b> between one statement <b>of Rabbi Meir</b> and the other statement <b>of Rabbi Meir.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Two <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> students of Rabbi Meir, expressed different opinions <b>in accordance with Rabbi Meir’s</b> opinion.

### Part 2
So too, the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer</b> cited in the mishna <b>contradicts</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer</b> cited in the <i>baraita</i>. In the mishna, Rabbi Eliezer holds that the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> begins with the emergence of the stars: From the time when the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma</i>, while in the <i>baraita</i>, he states that the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> begins when the day becomes sanctified on the eve of Shabbat.

### Part 3
The Gemara responds: There are two possible resolutions to the apparent contradiction in Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion. Either <b>two</b> <i>tanna’im</i> expressed different opinions <b>in accordance with Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion, <b>or if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, according to which we begin to recite <i>Shema</i> when the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma</i>, <b>is not</b> actually <b>Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion. Only the second half of the statement: Until the end of the first watch, was stated by Rabbi Eliezer.

### Part 4
In the mishna, we learned that Rabbi Eliezer establishes that one may recite the evening <i>Shema</i> <b>until the end of the first watch.</b> These watches are mentioned in the Bible as segments of the night, but it must be established: Into precisely how many segments is the night divided, three or four? Moreover, why does Rabbi Eliezer employ such inexact parameters rather than a more precise definition of time (<i>Tosefot HaRosh</i>)?

### Part 5
<b>What does Rabbi Eliezer</b> actually <b>hold? If he holds that the night consists of three watches, let him say</b> explicitly that one recites the evening <i>Shema</i> <b>until the fourth hour. If he holds that the night consists of four watches, let him say</b> explicitly <b>until the third hour.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>holds that the night consists of three watches,</b> and he employs this particular language of watches <b>in order to teach us: There are watches in heaven and there are watches on earth;</b> just as our night is divided into watches, so too is the night in the upper worlds. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The night consists of three watches, and over each and every watch, the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits and roars like a lion</b> in pain over the destruction of the Temple. This imagery is derived from a reference in the Bible, <b>as it is stated: “The Lord roars [<i>yishag</i>] from on high, from His holy dwelling He makes His voice heard. He roars mightily</b> [<b><i>shaog yishag</i></b>] <b>over His dwelling place,</b> He cries out like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth” (Jeremiah 25:30). The three instances of the root <i>shin-alef-gimmel</i> in this verse correspond to the three watches of the night.

### Part 7
<b>And signs of</b> the transition between each of <b>these</b> watches in the upper world can be sensed in this world: In <b>the first watch, the donkey brays;</b> in <b>the second, dogs bark;</b> and in <b>the third</b> people begin to rise, <b>a baby nurses from its mother’s breast and a wife converses with her husband.</b>

### Part 8
With regard to these earthly manifestations of the three heavenly watches as established in the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>What did Rabbi Eliezer enumerate? If</b> he <b>enumerated the beginning of the watch, why do I need a sign for the beginning of the first watch? It is</b> when <b>evening</b> begins; an additional sign is superfluous. <b>If he enumerated the end of the watches, why do I need a sign for the end of the last watch? It is</b> when <b>day</b> begins; an additional sign is similarly superfluous.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, he enumerated</b> the signs for <b>the end of the first watch and the beginning of the last watch,</b> both of which require a sign, as well as <b>the middle of the middle</b> watch. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>He enumerated the ends of all</b> of the watches. <b>And if you say</b> that a sign indicating the end of the <b>final</b> watch <b>is unnecessary</b> because it is day, nevertheless, that sign is useful.

### Part 10
<b>What is the practical ramification</b> of this sign? It is relevant <b>to one who recites</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>while lying in a dark house,</b> who cannot see the dawn and <b>who does not know when the time for reciting <i>Shema</i></b> arrives. That person is provided with a sign that <b>when a woman speaks with her husband and a baby nurses from its mother’s breast,</b> the final watch of the night has ended and <b>he must rise and recite</b> <i>Shema</i>.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel said in the name of Rav: The night consists of three watches, and over each and every watch the Holy One, Blessed be He sits and roars like a lion,</b> because the Temple service was connected to the changing of these watches (<i>Tosefot HaRosh</i>), <b>and says: “Woe to Me, that due to their sins I destroyed My house, burned My Temple and exiled them among the nations of the world.”</b>

### Part 12
Incidental to the mention of the elevated significance of the night watches, the Gemara cites a related story: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said: I was once walking along the road when I entered</b> the <b>ruins</b> of an old, abandoned building <b>among the ruins of Jerusalem</b> in order <b>to pray.</b> I noticed that <b>Elijah, of blessed memory, came and guarded the entrance for me and waited at the entrance until I finished my prayer. When I finished praying</b> and exited the ruin, Elijah <b>said to me,</b> deferentially as one would address a Rabbi: <b>Greetings to you, my Rabbi. I answered him: Greetings to you, my Rabbi, my teacher. And</b> Elijah <b>said to me: My son, why did you enter this ruin? I said to him:</b> In order <b>to pray. And</b> Elijah <b>said to me: You should have prayed on the road. And I said to him:</b> I was unable to pray along the road, because <b>I was afraid that I might be interrupted by travelers</b> and would be unable to focus. Elijah <b>said to me: You should have recited the abbreviated prayer</b> instituted for just such circumstances.

### Part 13
Rabbi Yosei concluded: <b>At that time,</b> from that brief exchange, <b>I learned from him, three things: I learned that one may not enter a ruin; and I learned</b> that one need not enter a building to pray, but <b>he may pray along the road; and I learned that one who prays along the road recites an abbreviated prayer</b> so that he may maintain his focus.

### Part 14
<b>And</b> after this introduction, Elijah <b>said to me: What voice did you hear in that ruin?</b> <br><b>I responded: I heard a Heavenly voice,</b> like an echo of that roar of the Holy One, Blessed be He (Maharsha), <b>cooing like a dove and saying: Woe to the children, due to whose sins I destroyed My house, burned My Temple, and exiled them among the nations.</b><br><b>And</b> Elijah <b>said to me:</b> By <b>your life and by your head, not only</b> did that voice <b>cry out in that moment, but it cries out three times each and every day. Moreover,</b> any time that God’s greatness is evoked, such as <b>when Israel enters synagogues and study halls and answers</b> in the <i>kaddish</i> prayer, <b>May His great name be blessed, the Holy One, Blessed be He, shakes His head and says: Happy is the king who is thus praised in his house.</b> When the Temple stood, this praise was recited there, but now: <b>How</b> great is the pain of <b>the father who exiled his children, and woe to the children who were exiled from their father’s table,</b> as their pain only adds to that of their father (Rabbi Shem Tov ibn Shaprut).

### Part 15
<b>The Sages taught, for three reasons one may not enter a ruin: Because of suspicion</b> of prostitution, <b>because</b> the ruin is liable to <b>collapse,</b> and <b>because of demons.</b> Three separate reasons seem extraneous, so the Gemara asks: Why was the reason <b>because of suspicion</b> necessary? <b>Let this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>be derived because of collapse.</b>
