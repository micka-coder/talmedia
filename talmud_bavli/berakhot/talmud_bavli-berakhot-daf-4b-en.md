### Part 1
<b>And if</b> they explain this verse <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel</b> who says that “when you lie down” refers to the entire night, then <b>let</b> the Rabbis also <b>say</b> that one may recite the evening <i>Shema</i> until dawn, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the Rabbis <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel,</b> and the fact <b>that they say until midnight is</b> in order <b>to distance a person from transgression. As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, <b>the Rabbis created a “fence” for their pronouncements</b> with regard to the recitation of <i>Shema</i> <b>in order to prevent</b> a situation where <b>a person comes home from the field in the evening,</b> tired from his day’s work, and knowing that he is permitted to recite <i>Shema</i> until dawn <b>says</b> to himself: <b>I will go home, eat a little, drink a little, sleep a little and then I will recite</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>and recite</b> the evening prayer. In the meantime, <b>he is overcome by sleep and ends up sleeping all night. However,</b> since one is concerned lest he fall asleep and fail to wake up before midnight in order to recite <i>Shema</i> at the appropriate time, <b>he will come from the field in the evening, enter the synagogue,</b> and until it is time to pray, he will immerse himself in Torah. <b>If he is accustomed to reading the Bible, he reads. If he is accustomed to learning</b> <i>mishnayot</i>, a more advanced level of study, <b>he learns. And</b> then <b>he recites</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>and prays</b> as he should. When he arrives home, <b>he eats his meal</b> with a contented heart <b>and recites a blessing.</b>

### Part 3
The <i>baraita</i> concludes with a warning: <b>Anyone who transgresses the pronouncements of the Sages is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty.

### Part 4
This is a startling conclusion. <b>What is different in all</b> other <b>places that it is not taught that one is liable</b> to receive <b>the death penalty and what is different here that it is taught that he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death penalty?</b> There is no unique stringency apparent in the rabbinic restriction on the recitation of <i>Shema</i>.

### Part 5
The Gemara offers two answers, explaining that the conclusion of the <i>baraita</i> essentially stems not from the magnitude of the transgression, but rather from concern that the “fence” created around this particular mitzva may be neglected. <b>If you wish, say</b> that one returning from work is quite anxious to go to sleep, and due to the risk that he will be <b>overcome by sleep,</b> he must be particularly vigilant in the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that strong language is employed here in order <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>he who says that</b> although the morning prayer and the afternoon prayer are mandatory, <b>the evening prayer is optional.</b> Therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> that the evening prayer <b>is mandatory,</b> and anyone who transgresses the pronouncement of the Sages in this regard is liable to receive the death penalty.

### Part 6
In this <i>baraita</i>, <b>the Master said</b> that when one returns from work in the evening, he enters the synagogue, <b>recites <i>Shema</i>, and prays.</b> From this <i>baraita</i>, we see that at night, just as during the day, one first recites <i>Shema</i> and then prays. This <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Who</b> is assured <b>of</b> a place in <b>the World-to-Come? It is</b> one <b>who juxtaposes</b> the blessing of <b>redemption,</b> recited after <i>Shema</i>, <b>to the evening prayer. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: The prayers were instituted</b> to be recited <b>between</b> the two recitations of <i>Shema</i>. According to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, one recites the morning <i>Shema</i>, then recites all of the prayers and only after the recitation of the evening prayer does he recite the evening <i>Shema</i>.

### Part 7
Although the practical difference between these two positions is clear, the Gemara seeks to determine: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> What is the basis of their argument?

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that they disagree over the interpretation of <b>a verse; if you wish, say</b> instead that they disagree on a point of <b>logic.</b>

### Part 9
<b>If you say</b> that they disagree on a point of <b>logic,</b> then the argument relates to the redemption recited after <i>Shema</i>, whose focus is the exodus from Egypt, the first redemption. The question is whether that redemption began at night, which would render it appropriate to juxtapose redemption to the blessing of the evening prayers as well, in prayer for immediate redemption. Or, perhaps, the redemption from Egypt only began during the day.

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan holds: Redemption occurred in the evening as well;</b> however, <b>the full-fledged redemption was only in the morning.</b> Since the redemption began in the evening, it is appropriate to juxtapose the blessing of redemption to the daily evening prayer. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi,</b> on the other hand, <b>holds: Since</b> full-fledged redemption <b>only occurred in the morning,</b> and the redemption of the previous evening <b>was not a full-fledged redemption,</b> there is no need to juxtapose the blessing of redemption to the evening prayer.

### Part 11
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is not a difference over a point of logic, but over the interpretation of <b>a verse. Both derived their opinions from the same verse: “When you lie down, and when you rise.”</b> Both interpreted that the juxtaposition in this verse of the recitation of <i>Shema</i> at night and the recitation of <i>Shema</i> in the morning draws a parallel between them.

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan holds:</b> The verse <b>juxtaposes lying down and rising. Just as when one rises, the recitation of</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>is followed by prayer,</b> as everyone agrees that in the morning one juxtaposes redemption to the morning prayer, <b>so too, when one lies down, the recitation of</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>is followed by prayer. And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi maintains:</b> The verse <b>juxtaposes lying down and rising</b> in a different sense. <b>Just as when one rises,</b> he recites <i>Shema</i> <b>adjacent to</b> rising from <b>his bed,</b> as the verse, when you rise, means when one awakens, <b>so too when one lies down, he recites</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>adjacent to</b> lying down in <b>his bed.</b> Therefore, the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> should be performed as close as possible to the moment when one actually lies down.

### Part 13
According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, it is a mitzva to recite <i>Shema</i> before the evening prayer. <b>Mar, son of Ravina, raises an objection</b> from a mishna: How can one do that? We learn in a later mishna: <b>In the evening, one recites two</b> blessings <b>prior to</b> the recitation of <i>Shema</i> <b>and two</b> blessings <b>afterward. And if you say</b> that <b>one must juxtapose</b> redemption to prayer, <b>doesn’t he fail to juxtapose redemption to prayer, as he must recite: Help us lie down [<i>hashkivenu</i>],</b> the blessing recited after the blessing of redemption, which constitutes an interruption between redemption and prayer?

### Part 14
<b>They say</b> in response: <b>Since the Sages instituted</b> the practice of reciting: <b>Help us lie down, it is considered one extended blessing of redemption,</b> and therefore does not constitute an interruption. <b>As if you fail to say</b> that the sections added by the Sages are considered no less significant than the original prayers, <b>then can one juxtapose redemption to prayer</b> even <b>in the morning? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Before</b> every prayer <b>one recites</b> the verse: <b>“Lord, open my lips, that my mouth may declare Your glory”</b> (Psalms 51:17) as a prelude to prayer? <b>Afterward, one recites</b> the verse: <b>“May the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable before You”</b> (Psalms 19:15). Doesn’t the verse: Lord, open my lips, constitute an interruption between redemption and prayer?

### Part 15
<b>Rather, there, since the Sages instituted</b> that one must <b>recite: Lord, open my lips, it is considered as an extended prayer</b> and not as an interruption. <b>Here, too,</b> with regard to the evening prayer, <b>since the Sages instituted to recite</b> the blessing <b>Help us lie down, it is considered as one extended</b> blessing of <b>redemption.</b>

### Part 16
Tangential to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that one who juxtaposes redemption and prayer is assured of a place in the World-to-Come, a similar statement is cited. <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Avina said: Anyone who recites: “A Psalm of David”</b> (Psalms 145) <b>three times every day is assured of</b> a place in <b>the World-to-Come.</b>

### Part 17
This statement extolling the significance of this particular chapter of Psalms, usually referred to as <i>ashrei</i> because its recitation is preceded by recitation of the verse, “Happy [<i>ashrei</i>] are those who dwell in Your House, they praise You Selah” (Psalms 84:5), raises the question: <b>What is the reason</b> that such significance is ascribed to this particular chapter?

### Part 18
<b>If you say that it is because it is arranged alphabetically,</b> then <b>let us say: “Happy are they who are upright in the way”</b> (Psalms 119) <b>where</b> the alphabetical arrangement <b>appears eight times</b>.

### Part 19
<b>Rather,</b> if you suggest that this particular chapter is recited <b>because it contains</b> praise for God’s provision of sustenance to all of creation: <b>“You open Your hand</b> and satisfy every living thing with favor” (Psalms 145:16), then <b>let him recite the great <i>hallel</i></b> (Psalms 136), <b>in which</b> numerous praises are <b>written,</b> including: <b>“Who provides food to all flesh,</b> Whose kindness endures forever” (Psalms 136:25).

### Part 20
<b>Rather,</b> the reason why <i>tehilla leDavid</i> is accorded preference <b>is because it contains both</b> an alphabetic acrostic as well as mention of God’s provision of sustenance to all creation.

### Part 21
Additionally, with regard to this psalm, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Why is there no</b> verse beginning with the letter <b><i>nun</i> in <i>ashrei</i>? Because it contains</b> an allusion to <b>the downfall of the enemies of Israel,</b> a euphemism for Israel itself. <b>As it is written: “The virgin of Israel has fallen and she will rise no more;</b> abandoned in her land, none will raise her up” (Amos 5:2), which begins with the letter <i>nun</i>. Due to this verse, <i>ashrei</i> does not include a verse beginning with the letter <i>nun</i>.

### Part 22
In order to ease the harsh meaning of this verse, <b>in the West,</b> in Eretz Yisrael, <b>they interpreted it</b> with a slight adjustment: <b>“She has fallen but she shall fall no more; rise, virgin of Israel.” Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> adds: <b>Even so, David went and</b> provided <b>support, through divine inspiration.</b> Although King David did not include a verse beginning with the letter <i>nun</i> alluding to Israel’s downfall, he foresaw the verse that would be written by Amos through divine inspiration; and the very next verse, which begins with the letter <i>samekh</i>, reads: <b>“The Lord upholds the fallen</b> and raises up those who are bowed down” (Psalms 145:14). Therefore, through divine inspiration, David offered hope and encouragement; although the virgin of Israel may have fallen, the Lord upholds the fallen.

### Part 23
After this discussion of the statement that Rabbi Elazar said that Rabbi Avina said, another statement of Rabbi Elazar is cited. <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Avina said: What was said about</b> the angel <b>Michael is greater than what was said about</b> the angel <b>Gabriel. As about Michael, it is written: “And one of the seraphim flew to me”</b> (Isaiah 6:6), indicating that with a single flight, the seraph arrived and performed his mission, while <b>regarding Gabriel, it is written: “The man, Gabriel, whom I had seen at the beginning, in a vision, being caused to fly swiftly,</b> approached close to me about the time of the evening offering” (Daniel 9:21). The double language used in the phrase “to fly swiftly [<i>muaf biaf]</i>,” indicates that he did not arrive at his destination in a single flight, but rather, that it took him two flights.

### Part 24
To Rabbi Elazar bar Avina, it is clear that “one of the seraphim” refers to Michael, and the Gemara asks: <b>From where is it inferred that the one</b> mentioned in the verse <b>is Michael?</b>

### Part 25
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the words <b>one and one. Here, it is written: “And one of the seraphim flew to me”</b> (Isaiah 6:6), <b>and there, it is written: “And behold, Michael, one of the chief ministers of the king, came to my aid”</b> (Daniel 10:13). Since the verse from Daniel refers to Michael as “one,” which aggadic midrash interprets as “the unique one,” so, too, “one of the seraphs” described in Isaiah must also refer to the unique one, Michael.

### Part 26
This discussion in the Gemara concludes with a <i>Tosefta</i> that arrives at a hierarchy of angels based on the number of flights required by each to arrive at his destination. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Michael,</b> as stated above, <b>in one</b> flight; <b>Gabriel, in two</b> flights; <b>Elijah</b> the Prophet, <b>in four</b> flights; <b>and the Angel of Death, in eight</b> flights. <b>During a time of plague,</b> however, when the Angel of Death seems ubiquitous, he arrives everywhere <b>in one</b> flight.

### Part 27
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Even though one recited <i>Shema</i> in the synagogue, it is a mitzva to recite it upon his bed</b> in fulfillment of the verse: “When you lie down.” <b>Rabbi Yosei said: What verse</b> alludes to the fact that one must recite <i>Shema</i> in the evening, upon his bed, as well? <b>“Tremble, and do not sin; say to your heart upon your bed and be still, Selah”</b> (Psalms 4:5). This is understood to mean: Recite <i>Shema</i>, about which it is written, “on your hearts,” upon your bed, and afterward be still and sleep.

### Part 28
With regard to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s statement, <b>Rabbi Naḥman said:</b>
