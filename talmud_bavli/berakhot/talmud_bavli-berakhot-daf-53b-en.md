### Part 1
We learned in the mishna: <b>And one does not recite the blessing over the candle until he derives benefit</b> from its light.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yehuda says </b>that <b>Rav says: Derives benefit does not </b>mean that the one reciting the blessing must<b> actually derive benefit </b>from the light of the candle. <b>Rather, as long as if one were to stand close </b>to the candle <b>he could utilize its light, </b>if he sees it he may recite a blessing over it, <b>even </b>if he is now standing <b>at a distance.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who had a candle hidden in his lap</b> or placed <b>inside an</b> opaque <b>lamp, or if he saw a flame and did not utilize its light, or if he utilized its light and did not see a flame, may not recite a blessing until he</b> both <b>sees the flame and utilizes its light.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara first clarifies the content of the <i>Tosefta</i> itself: <b>Granted,</b> a case where one <b>utilizes its light and did not see a flame, can be found where</b> the flame <b>is situated</b> around <b>a corner,</b> illuminating the area but hidden from his view. But <b>how can</b> a case where one <b>saw a flame and did not utilize its light be found? Is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where one is distant?</b> Apparently, one must actually utilize the flame; merely having the potential to utilize it is not sufficient.

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No.</b> This refers to <b>a case where</b> the flame is <b>gradually dimming.</b> One sees the flame, but is unable to utilize its light.

### Part 6
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may recite a blessing over smoldering coals</b> just as he does over a candle; however, <b>over dimming [<i>omemot</i>]</b> coals, <b>one may not recite a blessing.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances of smoldering coals? Rav Ḥisda said:</b> Smoldering coals are <b>any</b> coals <b>that, if one places a wood chip among them, it ignites on its own</b> without fanning the flame.

### Part 7
With regard to the wording of the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara <b>raises a dilemma:</b> Does the <i>baraita</i> say <b><i>omemot</i></b> beginning with an <i>alef</i>, or <b><i>omemot</i></b> beginning with an <i>ayin</i>?

### Part 8
<b>Come and hear</b> a resolution, <b>as Rav Ḥisda bar Avdimi said:</b> The correct version is <i>omemot</i> beginning with an <i>ayin</i>, as it is stated: <b>“The cedars in the garden of God could not dim it</b> [<b><i>amamuhu</i></b>]<b>”</b> (Ezekiel 31:8).

### Part 9
<b>And</b> with regard to the question whether or not one must actually benefit from the flame’s light in order to recite a blessing, <b>Rava said:</b> When the mishna said <b>benefit,</b> it meant that he must <b>actually</b> derive benefit from the light.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And how</b> adjacent must one be in order to be considered to have derived benefit from the flame? <b>Ulla said: So that he can distinguish between an <i>issar</i> and a <i>pundeyon</i>,</b> two coins of the period. <b>Ḥizkiya said: So that he can distinguish between a weight</b> used in <b>Tiberias and a weight</b> used in <b>Tzippori,</b> which were slightly different.

### Part 11
The Gemara relates that the <i>amora’im</i> conducted themselves in accordance with their above-stated opinions. At the conclusion of Shabbat, <b>Rav Yehuda</b> would <b>recite a blessing over</b> the light <b>of the house of Adda, the servant,</b> which was far from his house. <b>Rava</b> would <b>recite a blessing over</b> the light <b>of the house of Gurya bar Ḥama,</b> which was adjacent to his house. <b>Abaye</b> would <b>recite a blessing over</b> the light <b>of the house of bar Avuh.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said</b> a general halakhic principle: <b>One need not seek out light</b> at the conclusion of Shabbat <b>in the manner that one seeks out</b> other <b>mitzvot.</b> If no flame is available over which to recite a blessing, it does not prevent one from reciting <i>havdala</i>. And <b>Rav Zeira said: Initially I would seek out</b> light, <b>once I heard this</b> <i>halakha</i> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, I too do not seek</b> out light. <b>However, if</b> a candle <b>happens</b> to become available <b>to me, I recite a blessing</b> over it.

### Part 13
Our mishna cited a dispute regarding <b>one who ate</b> and forgot and did not recite a blessing; Beit Shammai say: He returns to the place where he ate and recites the blessing. Beit Hillel say: That is unnecessary. He recites the blessing at the place where he remembered. <b>Rav Zevid said and some say Rav Dimi bar Abba</b> said: This <b>dispute is</b> only with regard to a case <b>where one forgot</b> to recite the blessing, <b>but</b> if he did so <b>intentionally, everyone agrees that he must return to</b> the <b>place</b> where <b>he</b> ate <b>and recite a blessing.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>This is obvious. We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>And forgot,</b> not if he did so intentionally.

### Part 15
The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>the same is true,</b> that Beit Hillel permit one to recite a blessing without returning to the place where he ate, <b>even</b> in a case where he <b>willfully</b> did not recite a blessing, <b>and that which was taught: And forgot, is to convey the far-reaching</b> nature <b>of</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> who require him to return to the place where he ate even if he forgot, Rav Zevid <b>teaches us</b> that there is no disagreement in that case.

### Part 16
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: According to your statement, one who ate atop</b> the Temple Mount, <b>God’s chosen place of residence, and forgot and descended without reciting a blessing, must he return to the top of</b> the Temple Mount, <b>God’s chosen place of residence, to recite a blessing? Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel:</b> Why not? <b>And according to your statement, one who forgot his purse atop</b> the Temple Mount, <b>God’s chosen place of residence, would he not ascend to retrieve it? If one ascends in deference to his own</b> needs, <b>all the more so</b> he should ascend <b>in deference to Heaven.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara relates: There were <b>these two students</b> who ate and did not recite a blessing. <b>One of them did so unwittingly,</b> and, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> returned to where he ate, <b>and found a purse of gold. One of them did so intentionally,</b> and, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel,</b> albeit in circumstances where they agree with Beit Shammai, did not return <b>and a lion ate him.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara further relates: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana was once traveling with a caravan. He ate and forgot and did not recite a blessing. He said</b> to himself: <b>What shall I do? If I say to them: I forgot to recite a blessing, they</b> will <b>say to me to recite a blessing</b> here, as <b>wherever you recite a blessing, you recite a blessing to God.</b> It is <b>better that I say to them: I forgot a golden dove.</b> Then they will wait for me while I retrieve it. <b>He said to them: Wait for me, as I forgot a golden dove. He went and recited a blessing and found a golden dove.</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about a <b>dove,</b> that he specifically said that that was the object that he forgot? The Gemara answers: <b>Because the community of Israel is likened to a dove, as it is written: “The wings of a dove, covered in silver, and its pinions with the shimmer of gold”</b> (Psalms 68:14). The Gemara explains the parable: <b>Just as a dove is saved</b> from its enemies <b>only by its wings, so too, Israel is saved only by</b> the merit of the <b>mitzvot.</b>

### Part 20
We learned in the mishna: <b>And until when does he</b> recite the blessing? Until the food is digested in his intestines.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the duration of digestion? Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> As <b>long as he is not</b> yet <b>hungry</b> again. <b>And Reish Lakish said: As long as he is thirsty due to his eating.</b>

### Part 22
<b>Rav Yeimar bar Shelamya said to Mar Zutra, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Yeimar bar Sheizevi</b> who said to <b>Mar Zutra: Did Reish Lakish say that? Didn’t Rav Ami say</b> that <b>Reish Lakish said: What is the duration of digestion? As long as</b> it takes <b>to walk four <i>mil</i>?</b>

### Part 23
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where Reish Lakish said the duration is as long as it takes to walk four <i>mil,</i> is <b>in</b> a case where he ate <b>a sizable meal, here,</b> where Reish Lakish said the duration is as long as he remains thirsty, is <b>in</b> a case where he ate <b>a meager meal.</b>

### Part 24
We learned in the mishna a tannaitic dispute with regard to a case where <b>wine came before</b> the diners after the meal, and we also learned in the mishna that one answers amen after a Jew recites a blessing even if he did not hear the entire blessing.

### Part 25
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that</b> if <b>a Jew</b> recites a blessing, <b>even though one did not hear the entire blessing, he responds</b> amen? <b>If he did not hear</b> the entire blessing, <b>how did he fulfill</b> his obligation?

### Part 26
<b>Ḥiyya bar Rav said:</b> This is not a case where one seeks to fulfill his obligation by responding amen; rather, it is a case <b>where he did not eat with them</b> yet still wishes to answer amen to their blessing. <b>And so Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b> It is a case <b>where he did not eat with them.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Rav said to his son, Ḥiyya: My son, seize</b> the opportunity <b>and recite a blessing</b> quickly. <b>And similarly Rav Huna said to his son, Rabba, seize</b> the opportunity <b>and recite a blessing.</b>

### Part 27
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that one who recites a blessing is preferable to one who answers amen? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The reward of <b>the one who answers amen is greater than</b> the reward of <b>the one who recites the blessing?</b>

### Part 28
<b>Rabbi Nehorai said to him: By Heavens,</b> an oath in the name of God, <b>it is so. Know</b> that this is true, <b>as the military assistants [<i>gulyarin</i>] descend to the</b> battlefield <b>and initiate the war</b> and <b>the mighty descend and prevail.</b> The amen that follows a blessing is compared to the mighty who join the war after the assistants, illustrating that answering amen is more significant than reciting the initial blessing.

### Part 29
The Gemara responds: This is subject to <b>a tannaitic dispute, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Both the one who recites a blessing and the one who answers</b> amen <b>are included</b> among those who “stand up and bless” (Nehemiah 9:5), but <b>they hurry to</b> reward, i.e., <b>the one who recites the blessing, more than</b> they hurry to reward, i.e., <b>the one who answers amen.</b>

### Part 30
<b>Shmuel raised a dilemma before Rav: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>answering amen after</b> the blessings of <b>schoolchildren?</b> Rav <b>said to him: One answers amen following everyone</b> whom we hear recite a blessing, <b>except for schoolchildren, as they</b> recite blessings merely in order <b>to learn</b> them, not as expressions of thanksgiving. <b>This applies</b> specifically <b>at a time when they are not fulfilling their obligation</b> with the recitation of the blessing, but are simply learning. <b>However, at a time when they are fulfilling their obligation</b> through the recitation of a blessing, <b>one answers</b> amen after their blessing.

### Part 31
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one does not have <b>oil</b> to spread on and cleanse his hands after eating, this <b>prevents</b> him from reciting <b>the</b> Grace after Meals <b>blessing;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Zilai. Rabbi Zivai says:</b> Lack of that <b>oil does not prevent one</b> from reciting Grace after Meals. <b>Rav Aḥa says:</b> Lack of <b>fine oil prevents one</b> from reciting Grace after Meals. One must wait until he rubs oil on his hands. <b>Rav Zuhamai says: Just as one who is filthy is unfit for Temple service, so too are filthy hands unfit for</b> reciting <b>the</b> Grace after Meals <b>blessing.</b>

### Part 32
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> of this: <b>I do not know of Zilai or Zivai or Zuhamai; rather, I know a <i>baraita</i>, as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, and some say</b> that it was <b>taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> It is stated: “And you shall sanctify yourselves, and you shall be holy, for holy am I, the Lord your God” (Leviticus 20:26). With regard to this verse, the Sages said: <b>And you shall sanctify yourselves, these are the first waters</b> with which one washes his hands before the meal; <b>and you shall be holy, these are the final waters; for holy, this is oil</b> which one spreads on his hands; <b>am I, the Lord your God, this is</b> the Grace after Meals <b>blessing.</b>
