### Part 1
Additionally: If <b>wine came before them during the meal, each and every</b> diner <b>recites a blessing</b> over the wine <b>for himself.</b> If the wine came <b>after the meal, one recites a blessing on behalf of them all. And he,</b> who recited the blessing over the wine, also <b>says</b> the blessing <b>over the incense</b> [<b><i>mugmar</i></b>], <b>although they only bring the incense</b> to the diners <b>after the meal.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement that wine that precedes a meal exempts wine that follows a meal, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>was only taught with regard to Shabbat and Festivals, since,</b> because one can continue drinking at his leisure, <b>one bases his meal on the wine. However, during the rest of the days of the year,</b> one who drinks wine at a meal <b>recites a blessing over each and every cup,</b> as his original intention was not to drink a lot.

### Part 3
<b>It was also stated: Rabba bar Mari said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: This was only taught</b> in the mishna <b>with regard to Shabbat and Festivals, and when a person emerges</b> tired <b>from the bathhouse,</b> and wishes to eat and rest, <b>and during bloodletting,</b> after which one tends to drink a lot, <b>since</b> on these occasions <b>one</b> typically <b>bases his meal on wine. However, during the rest of the days of the year,</b> one who drinks wine at a meal <b>recites a blessing over each and every cup.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabba bar Mari happened</b> to come <b>to the house of Rava during the week. He saw him recite a blessing</b> over wine <b>before the meal, and again recite a blessing</b> on the wine <b>after the meal. He said to him: Well done. And so too, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> that this was proper conduct.

### Part 5
The Gemara also relates: <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Yosef happened</b> to come <b>to the house of Abaye on a Festival. He saw that he recited a blessing over each and every cup</b> of wine. Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to him:</b> Does the <b>Master not hold</b> in accordance with <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi,</b> who said that one blessing is sufficient? Abaye <b>said to him:</b> My original intention was not to base my meal upon wine and with each cup <b>I change my mind</b> and decide to drink it. Even Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi would agree that under those circumstances, one must recite a blessing over each and every cup.

### Part 6
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>wine came out to them during the meal, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>exempting the wine after the meal</b> from a blessing? The dilemma is as follows: <b>If you say: One who recited a blessing over the wine that</b> one drank <b>before the meal,</b> with that blessing <b>he exempted the wine that</b> he drinks <b>after the meal,</b> perhaps that <b>is because</b> the purpose of drinking <b>this,</b> wine before the meal, <b>is to drink, and that,</b> wine after the meal, <b>is to drink</b> for its own sake. <b>However, here, where</b> the purpose of drinking <b>this,</b> the wine after the meal, <b>is to drink and that,</b> the wine during the meal, <b>is to moisten</b> the food and to facilitate its consumption, <b>no.</b> The blessing on one cannot exempt the other. <b>Or perhaps there is no difference,</b> and all drinking is considered the same.

### Part 7
Opinions differed: <b>Rav said: It exempts, and Rav Kahana said: It does not exempt. Rav Naḥman said: It exempts, and Rav Sheshet said: It does not exempt. Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda and all the students of Rav said: It does not exempt. Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from our mishna: If <b>wine came before them during the meal, each and every</b> diner <b>recites a blessing</b> over the wine <b>for himself.</b> If the wine came <b>after the meal, one recites a blessing on behalf of them all.</b> Apparently, even though they recited a blessing over wine during the course of the meal, they must recite a blessing over the wine after the meal as well. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> The mishna <b>says as follows:</b> There are two independent cases. The second case is: <b>If wine did not come before them during the meal, but only after the meal, one recites a blessing on behalf of them all.</b>

### Part 8
We learned in the mishna: <b>One who recited a blessing over the bread exempted the appetizers,</b> as they are considered secondary to the bread. However, one who recited a blessing <b>over the appetizers did not exempt the bread. Beit Shammai say:</b> The blessing recited over the appetizers <b>did not exempt even a cooked dish</b> that he eats during the meal.

### Part 9
With regard to this case, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Do <b>Beit Shammai disagree with the first clause</b> in the mishna <b>or with the latter clause,</b> as it may be explained in both ways? It can be understood that <b>the first <i>tanna</i> says: One who recited a blessing over the bread exempted the appetizers and all the more so</b> it exempted <b>a cooked dish. And Beit Shammai come to say: It goes without saying that</b> the blessing over <b>bread does not exempt appetizers; as</b> the blessing over bread <b>does not even exempt a cooked dish. Or perhaps they disagree with the latter clause, as it was taught: One who recited a blessing over the appetizers did not exempt the bread.</b> By inference, the blessing <b>did not exempt bread, but it did exempt a cooked dish. And Beit Shammai come to say</b> that the blessing over the appetizers <b>did not exempt even a cooked dish.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara concludes: <b>Let it stand,</b> as this dilemma remains unresolved.

### Part 11
The mishna distinguished between a case where several people <b>were sitting</b> to eat, which is not a joint meal, <b>and each and every</b> diner recites a blessing for himself; and a case where they were reclined on divans, which renders it a joint meal, and one recites a blessing on behalf of all of them. The Gemara infers: If <b>they reclined, yes,</b> it is considered a joint meal; if <b>they did not recline, no. And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction: Ten</b> people <b>who were walking on the road, even if they are all eating from one loaf, each and every one recites a blessing for himself.</b> If <b>they sat to eat, even if each and every one is eating from his</b> own <b>loaf, one recites a blessing on behalf of them all</b> as it is considered a joint meal. In any case, <b>it was taught:</b> If <b>they sat</b> to eat, <b>even though they did not recline.</b> Apparently, sitting together is enough to render it a joint meal and reclining is not required.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> With regard to those walking along the road, it was <b>in a case where they said: Let us go and eat in such-and-such a place.</b> Since they designated a specific location to eat together in advance, it is considered a joint meal.

### Part 13
On a similar note, the Gemara relates: <b>When Rav died, his students went after his</b> casket to the city where he was to be buried. <b>When they returned, they said: Let us go and eat bread on</b> the banks of <b>the Dannak River. After they ate, they sat, and raised a dilemma: Did we learn</b> in the mishna <b>specifically</b> if <b>they reclined,</b> it is considered a joint meal; <b>however,</b> if they merely <b>sat</b> together, <b>no,</b> it is not considered a joint meal? <b>Or perhaps, since they said: Let us go and eat in such-and-such a place,</b> it is considered <b>as if they reclined? It was not within their capability</b> to resolve this dilemma.
