### Part 1
The Gemara questions this: <b>If so, why discuss</b> a case of <b>one who is marrying a virgin</b> in particular? <b>Even one who is marrying a widow</b> is performing a mitzva and should <b>also</b> be exempt.

### Part 2
The Gemara responds that nevertheless, there is a distinction between one marrying a virgin and one marrying a widow. <b>Here,</b> in the case of one who marries a virgin, the groom is <b>preoccupied</b> by his thoughts, <b>while here,</b> in the case of one who marries a widow, <b>he is not preoccupied.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b> a groom is exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i> simply <b>due to preoccupation,</b> then <b>even</b> one who is preoccupied because <b>his ship sank at sea should</b> be exempt. If so, <b>why then did Rabbi Abba bar Zavda say</b> that <b>Rav said: A mourner is obligated in all the mitzvot mentioned in the Torah except for</b> the mitzva to don <b>phylacteries, as</b> the term <b>splendor is stated</b> with regard to phylacteries, <b>as it is stated</b> that the prophet Ezekiel was prohibited to mourn and was told: <b>“Bind your splendor upon yourself”</b> (Ezekiel 24:17). If even a mourner, who is pained and preoccupied, is obligated to recite <i>Shema</i>, clearly preoccupation has no bearing upon one’s obligation.

### Part 4
The Gemara responds: Nevertheless, there is a distinction between the cases. <b>There,</b> it is a case of <b>preoccupation with a voluntary</b> act, as there is no mitzva to be preoccupied with his mourning, but <b>here,</b> in the case of a groom, the cause of <b>the preoccupation is</b> the <b>mitzva</b> itself.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna relates another episode portraying unusual conduct by Rabban Gamliel. <b>He bathed on the first night after his wife died. His students said to him:</b> Have <b>you</b> not <b>taught us, our teacher, that a mourner is prohibited to bathe?</b> He answered them: <b>I am not like other people, I am delicate [<i>istenis</i>].</b> For me, not bathing causes actual physical distress, and even a mourner need not suffer physical distress as part of his mourning.

### Part 6
Another exceptional incident is related: <b>And when his slave, Tavi, died,</b> Rabban Gamliel <b>accepted condolences for his</b> death as one would for a close family member. <b>His students said to him: Have you</b> not <b>taught us, our teacher, that one does not accept condolences for</b> the death of <b>slaves?</b> Rabban Gamliel said to his students: <b>My slave, Tavi, is not like all the rest of the slaves, he was virtuous</b> and it is appropriate to accord him the same respect accorded to a family member.

### Part 7
With regard to the recitation of <i>Shema</i> on one’s wedding night, the Sages said that <b>if,</b> despite his exemption, <b>a groom wishes to recite <i>Shema</i> on the first night,</b> he may do so. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Not everyone who wishes to assume the reputation</b> of a God-fearing person <b>may assume</b> it, and consequently, not everyone who wishes to recite <i>Shema</i> on his wedding night may do so.

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to Rabban Gamliel’s bathing on the first night after the death of his wife, the Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>Rabban Gamliel</b> did not practice the customs of mourning after his wife died? The Gemara answers: <b>He holds that</b> acute mourning [<i>aninut</i>] is in effect only on the day of the death itself, but <b>acute mourning at night is</b> only <b>by rabbinic law, as it is written:</b> “And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentations; I will bring sackcloth upon your loins and baldness upon every head; and I will make you like a mourner for an only child, <b>and the end will be like a bitter day”</b> (Amos 8:10). Therefore, by Torah law one’s acute mourning is only during the day, like a bitter day, while the acute mourning at night that follows is only rabbinic. <b>And in the case of a delicate person, the Sages did not issue a decree</b> that one should afflict himself during the period of acute mourning.

### Part 9
We learned in our mishna that: <b>When his servant, Tavi, died,</b> Rabban Gamliel accepted condolences for him.

### Part 10
<b>The Sages</b> taught in a <i>baraita</i>: For <b>slaves and maidservants</b> who die, <b>one does not stand in a row</b> of comforters to console the mourners, <b>and one recites neither the blessing of the mourners nor the consolation of the mourners.</b>

### Part 11
<b>An incident</b> is related that when <b>Rabbi Eliezer’s maidservant died, his students entered to console him. When he saw them</b> approaching <b>he went up to the second floor, and they went up after him. He entered the gatehouse [<i>anpilon</i>], and they entered after him. He entered the banquet hall [<i>teraklin</i>],</b> and <b>they entered after him.</b> Having seen them follow him everywhere, <b>he said to them: It seems to me that you would be burned by lukewarm water,</b> meaning that you could take a hint and when I went up to the second floor, you would understand that I did not wish to receive your consolations. <b>Now</b> I see that <b>you are not even burned by boiling hot water. Did I not teach you the following:</b> For <b>slaves and maidservants</b> who die, <b>one does not stand in a row</b> of comforters to console the mourners, <b>and one neither recites the blessing of the mourners nor</b> does he recite <b>the consolation of the mourners,</b> as the relationship between master and slave is not like a familial relationship? <b>Rather, what does one say about them</b> when they die? <b>Just as we say to a person about his ox or donkey which died: May the Omnipresent replenish your loss, so too do we say for one’s slave or maidservant</b> who died: <b>May the Omnipresent replenish your loss,</b> as the connection between a master and his slave is only financial in nature.

### Part 12
<b>It was taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One does not eulogize slaves and maidservants. Rabbi Yosei says: If he was a virtuous servant, one recites over him</b> a eulogy of sorts: <b>Alas, a good and loyal man who enjoyed</b> the fruits <b>of his hard labor. They said to him: If so, what</b> praise <b>have you left for virtuous</b> Jews? A Jewish person would be proud to be eulogized in that manner.

### Part 13
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may only call three</b> people <b>patriarchs,</b> Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but not Jacob’s children. <b>And one may only call four</b> people <b>matriarchs,</b> Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this exclusivity with regard to the <b>Patriarchs? If you say</b> that it is <b>because we do not know whether we descend from Reuben or from Simon,</b> so we cannot accurately say our father Reuben, for example, <b>if so,</b> with regard to the Matriarchs as well, <b>we do not know whether we descend from Rachel or from Leah,</b> and we should not call Rachel and Leah matriarchs either. <b>Instead,</b> the reason the sons of Jacob are not called patriarchs is not for that reason, but because <b>until</b> Jacob <b>they are significant</b> enough to be referred to as patriarchs, but <b>beyond</b> Jacob, <b>they are not significant</b> enough to be referred to as patriarchs.

### Part 15
This serves as an introduction; although older people are often referred to with the honorific: Father so-and-so, <b>it was taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not refer to slaves and maidservants as father [<i>abba</i>] so-and-so or mother [<i>imma</i>] so-and-so. But they would call</b> the slaves and maidservants <b>of Rabban Gamliel “father so-and-so” and “mother so-and-so.”</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: Is a <b>story</b> cited in order <b>to contradict</b> the previously stated <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: There is no contradiction; rather, <b>because</b> Rabban Gamliel’s servants <b>were significant,</b> they were addressed with these honorifics.

### Part 17
The Gemara cites an aggadic statement concerning prayer and the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “So I will bless You as I live, to Your name I will raise my hands”</b> (Psalms 63:5)? <b>So I will bless You as I live, refers to the recitation of <i>Shema</i>,</b> and <b>to Your name I will raise my hands, refers to</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer,</b> which is characterized as lifting one’s hands to God. <b>And if one does so,</b> recites <i>Shema</i> and prays, <b>the verse says about him: “As with fat and marrow, my soul will be satisfied”</b> (Psalms 63:6). <b>And not only</b> does he receive this reward, <b>but he inherits two worlds, this world and the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “With lips of joys [<i>renanot</i>], my mouth praises You”</b> (Psalms 63:6). The plural, joys, refers to two joys, that of this world and that of the World-to-Come.

### Part 18
The Gemara describes how <b>after Rabbi Elazar concluded his prayer, he said the following</b> additional prayer: <br><b>May it be Your will, Lord our God,</b> <br><b>to cause to dwell in our lot love and brotherhood, peace and friendship.</b> <br><b>And may You make our borders rich in disciples</b> <br><b>and cause us to ultimately succeed,</b> that we will have a good <b>end and hope.</b> <br><b>And may You set our portion in the Garden of Eden,</b> <br><b>and may You establish for us a good companion and a good inclination in Your world.</b> <br><b>And may we rise early and find the aspiration of our hearts to fear Your name,</b> <br><b>and may the satisfaction of our souls come before You,</b> i.e., may You hear our prayers that we may have spiritual contentment in this world <b>for the best.</b>

### Part 19
Similarly, the Gemara recounts that <b>after Rabbi Yoḥanan concluded his prayer, he said the following</b> additional prayer: <br><b>May it be Your will, Lord our God,</b> <br><b>that You look upon our shame and behold our plight,</b> <br><b>that You clothe Yourself in Your mercy,</b> <br><b>and cover Yourself with Your might,</b> <br><b>that You wrap Yourself in Your loving-kindness,</b> <br><b>and gird Yourself with Your grace,</b> <br><b>and may Your attributes of goodness and humility come before You.</b>

### Part 20
Similarly, <b>after Rabbi Zeira concluded his prayers he said the following</b> additional prayer: <br><b>May it be Your will, Lord our God,</b> <br><b>that we not sin or shame ourselves,</b> <br><b>and that we not disgrace ourselves before our forefathers,</b> <br>in the sense that our actions should not disgrace the actions of our forefathers.

### Part 21
<b>After Rabbi Ḥiyya prayed he said the following:</b> <br><b>May it be Your will, Lord our God,</b> <br><b>that Your Torah should be our vocation,</b> <br><b>and may our heart not become faint nor our eyes dim.</b>

### Part 22
<b>After his prayer, Rav said the following:</b> <br><b>May it be Your will, Lord our God,</b> <br><b>that You grant us long life, a life of peace,</b> <br><b>a life of goodness, a life of blessing,</b> <br><b>a life of sustenance, a life of freedom of movement</b> from place to place, where we are not tied to one place, <br><b>a life of dread of sin, a life without shame and disgrace,</b> <br><b>a life of wealth and honor,</b> <br><b>a life in which we have love of Torah and reverence for Heaven,</b> <br><b>a life in which You fulfill all the desires of our heart for good.</b>

### Part 23
<b>After his prayer, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said the following:</b> <br><b>May it be Your will, Lord our God, and God of our forefathers,</b> <br><b>that You save us from the arrogant and from arrogance</b> in general, <br><b>from a bad man, from a bad mishap,</b> <br><b>from an evil instinct, from a bad companion,</b> <br><b>from a bad neighbor, from the destructive Satan,</b> <br><b>from a harsh trial and from a harsh opponent,</b> <br><b>whether he is a member of the covenant,</b> a Jew, <br><b>or whether he is not a member of the covenant.</b>

### Part 24
<b>And</b> the Gemara notes that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would recite this prayer every day <b>despite the fact that</b> royal <b>officers stood</b> watch <b>over Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi for his protection; nevertheless, he prayed to avoid conflict or hindrance resulting from arrogance.

### Part 25
<b>After his prayer, Rav Safra said the following:</b> <br><b>May it be Your will, Lord our God, that You establish peace</b>
