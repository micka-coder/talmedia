as an impure vessel loses its status as a vessel and consequently its impurity when it can no longer be used, if they have holes <b>the size of pomegranates.</b>

### Part 2
<b>A land of olive oil: Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said</b> that the verse should be expounded as follows: <b>A land, all of whose measures are</b> the size of <b>olives.</b> The Gemara poses a question: <b>Can it enter your mind</b> that it is a land <b>all of whose measures</b> are the size of olives? <b>Aren’t there those</b> measures <b>that we mentioned</b> above, which are not the size of olives? <b>Rather, say: A land, most of whose measures are</b> the size of <b>olives,</b> as most of the measures relating to forbidden foods and other matters are the size of olives.

### Part 3
<b>Honey,</b> i.e., dates from which date honey is extracted, also alludes to a measurement. With regard to Yom Kippur, one is only liable if he eats the equivalent <b>of a large date on Yom Kippur.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what will <b>the other</b> <i>amora</i>, who interpreted the verse as referring to the <i>halakhot</i> of precedence in blessings, say with regard to this midrash? The Gemara responds: <b>Are these measures written explicitly</b> in the Torah? <b>Rather,</b> they are <b>by rabbinic</b> law, <b>and the verse</b> is <b>a mere support,</b> an allusion to these measures.

### Part 4
With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of precedence in blessings, the Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rav Hamnuna were sitting at a meal. They brought dates and pomegranates before them. Rav Hamnuna took and recited a blessing over the dates first. Rav Ḥisda said to him:</b> Does <b>the Master not hold that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>which Rav Yosef, and some say Rabbi Yitzḥak, said: Each</b> food that <b>precedes</b> the others <b>in this verse, precedes</b> the others <b>in terms of blessing as well?</b> The pomegranate precedes the date in that verse.

### Part 5
Rav Hamnuna <b>said to him: This,</b> the date, <b>is</b> mentioned <b>second to</b> the word <b>land,</b> in the verse: “A land of olive oil and honey,” just after the olive, <b>and this,</b> the pomegranate, is <b>fifth to</b> the word <b>land.</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him</b> admiringly: <b>Who will give us iron legs that we may serve you</b> and constantly hear from you novel ideas.

### Part 6
<b>It was stated:</b> If <b>they brought figs and grapes before them during a meal,</b> what blessings need to be recited? <b>Rav Huna said: They require a blessing before</b> eating <b>them, and do not require a blessing after</b> eating <b>them,</b> as Grace after Meals exempts them. <b>And so too, Rav Naḥman said: They require a blessing before</b> eating <b>them, and do not require a blessing after</b> eating <b>them. And Rav Sheshet said: They require a blessing both before</b> eating <b>them and after</b> eating <b>them,</b> even if he ate them during the meal, <b>as you have nothing which requires a blessing before</b> eating <b>it and does not require a blessing after</b> eating <b>it,</b> because it is exempted by Grace after Meals, <b>except bread,</b> a sweetened and spiced pastry, <b>that comes as dessert,</b> as it, too, is a type of bread. The statements of both Rav Huna and Rav Sheshet <b>disagree with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya, as Rabbi Ḥiyya said: Bread exempts all the types of food</b> that one eats after it, <b>and wine exempts all types of drinks</b> that one drinks after it, and one need not recite a blessing either before or after eating them.

### Part 7
Summarizing, <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is: Food <b>items that come due to the meal,</b> which are eaten together with the bread as part of the meal, <b>during the meal, neither require a blessing before</b> eating <b>them nor after</b> eating <b>them,</b> as they are considered secondary to the bread. <b>And</b> food items like fruit, <b>that do not come due to the meal,</b> as part of the meal, but may be brought <b>during the meal, require a blessing before</b> eating <b>them and do not require a blessing after</b> eating <b>them.</b> If they come <b>after the meal, they require a blessing both before</b> eating <b>them and after</b> eating <b>them.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara relates that the students <b>asked Ben Zoma: Why did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that food <b>items that come due to the meal during the meal, neither require a blessing before</b> eating <b>them nor after</b> eating <b>them? He said to them: Because bread exempts them.</b> They asked: <b>If so, bread should also exempt wine.</b> Yet, one recites a blessing over wine during the meal. The Gemara responds: <b>Wine is different,</b>
