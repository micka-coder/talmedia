<b>nor with</b> regard to <b>dirty hands,</b> i.e., with regard to washing hands at the end of a meal.

### Part 2
The Gemara recounts: <b>Ravin and Abaye were traveling along the road</b> on donkeys. <b>Ravin’s donkey preceded Abaye’s and</b> Ravin <b>did not say</b> to Abaye: <b>Let the Master go</b> first. Abaye <b>said</b> to himself: Ever <b>since this one of the Sages,</b> Ravin, <b>ascended from the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>he has become arrogant. When they reached the door of the synagogue,</b> Ravin <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Let the Master enter</b> first. Abaye <b>said to him: Until now was I not Master?</b> Why do you only begin deferring to me now but did not do so while we were traveling? Ravin <b>said to him: Rabbi Yoḥanan said the following: One only defers</b> to those greater than he <b>at a doorway that has a <i>mezuza</i>,</b> as only there is it appropriate to allow him to go first.

### Part 3
The Gemara challenges: A doorway <b>that has a <i>mezuza</i>, yes,</b> one defers; a doorway <b>that does not have a <i>mezuza</i>, no,</b> one does not defer? <b>If so, a synagogue or study hall that has no <i>mezuza</i>,</b> there <b>too, does one not defer</b> at their doorways? <b>Rather, say</b> that this is the principle: One only shows deference <b>at a doorway</b> where it is worthy <b>of</b> affixing <b>a <i>mezuza</i>,</b> but not on a road or a bridge.

### Part 4
The Gemara continues with the subject of deferring to one’s superior during a meal: <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, said in the name of Rav: Those reclining</b> at a meal <b>may not eat anything until the one breaking bread has tasted</b> the bread. <b>Rav Safra sat and said:</b> May not <b>taste, was stated</b> by Rav, and not: May not eat.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>What difference does</b> it <b>make</b> whether Rav said taste or eat? The Gemara explains that there is no difference and that Rav Safra’s insistence teaches that <b>one must say</b> what he was taught <b>in the</b> precise <b>language</b> employed <b>by his teacher</b> without altering a single detail.

### Part 6
The Gemara continues to discuss the subject of honors during a meal. <b>The Sages taught: Two people</b> who are eating <b>from a single dish must wait for each other,</b> but if there are <b>three,</b> everyone eats when he wishes and <b>they need not wait</b> for each other. Generally, <b>the one who breaks bread extends his hand</b> to take food <b>first,</b> but <b>if he wishes to defer to his teacher or to one who is greater</b> than he, <b>he has permission</b> to do so.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana engaged in</b> preparations <b>for his son’s</b> wedding <b>in the house of Rav Shmuel bar Rav Ketina. He arrived early and sat and taught his son</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of meals: <b>The one who breaks bread may not break</b> the bread <b>until amen has ended from the mouths of those responding. Rav Ḥisda said:</b> One need only wait until amen has ended <b>from the mouths of the majority of those responding.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rami bar Ḥama said to him: What is different</b> regarding <b>the majority</b> that one must wait until their amen ends before proceeding? <b>That</b> until then, <b>the blessing has not yet concluded.</b> If so, when the amen of <b>the minority</b> has not yet ended <b>as well, the blessing has not yet concluded.</b> Why doesn’t the one breaking bread need to wait in that case?

### Part 9
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: Because I say</b> that <b>anyone who answers</b> an <b>amen</b> of <b>excessive</b> duration <b>is merely mistaken.</b>

### Part 10
With regard to answering amen, <b>the Sages taught: One should not respond</b> with <b>an abbreviated [<i>ḥatufa</i>] amen,</b> in which the first syllable is not properly enunciated, <b>and a truncated [<i>ketufa</i>] amen,</b> in which the second syllable is not properly enunciated, <b>and an orphaned [<i>yetoma</i>] amen,</b> in which the respondent is unaware of the blessing to which he is responding. Similarly, <b>one should not</b> quickly and indifferently <b>discharge a blessing from his mouth.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Ben Azzai says: Anyone who recites an orphaned amen, his children will be orphaned;</b> one who recites an <b>abbreviated</b> amen, <b>his days will be abbreviated</b> and incomplete; one who recites <b>a truncated</b> amen, <b>his days will be truncated. One who extends his amen, they will extend his days and years for him.</b> Nonetheless, one should not prolong it extensively.

### Part 12
Returning to matters of <i>zimmun</i>, the Gemara relates: <b>Rav and Shmuel were sitting at a meal</b> when, much later, <b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya arrived and was hurrying and eating. Rav said to him: What is your thinking?</b> Are you rushing in order <b>to join together with us</b> for a <i>zimmun</i>? <b>We have already eaten</b> and finished <b>our</b> meal before you arrived. <b>Shmuel said to</b> Rav: We have not really finished our meal, as <b>if they brought me truffles or a young pigeon for Abba,</b> Rav, <b>wouldn’t we eat it?</b> Since we would still eat, we have not yet finished our meal and Rabbi Shimi bar Ḥiyya can join us in the <i>zimmun</i>.

### Part 13
<b>Rav’s students were seated at a meal</b> when <b>Rav Aḥa entered.</b> The students <b>said: A great man has come who can recite the blessing on our behalf.</b> Rav Aḥa <b>said to them: Do you think that the greatest recites the blessing?</b> That is not so. Rather, one of <b>the main</b> participants who was present from the beginning <b>of the meal recites the blessing.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b>, however, <b>is that the greatest</b> person present <b>recites the blessing, even if he arrived at the end</b> of the meal.

### Part 14
In the mishna, we learned that if, among the diners, <b>one ate doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>],</b> he is included among the three to obligate those with whom he ate in a <i>zimmun</i>. The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But</b> <i>demai</i> <b>is not fit for his</b> consumption. He is forbidden to eat <i>demai</i>. The Gemara responds: He may recite Grace after Meals over it <b>because, if he wants, he could declare all of his property ownerless [<i>hefker</i>] and he would be a pauper,</b> in which case the <i>demai</i> would be <b>fit for his</b> consumption. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>One may feed the impoverished <i>demai</i> and</b> one may feed <b>soldiers [<i>akhsania</i>],</b> whose support is imposed upon the residents of the city, <b><i>demai</i>. And Rav Huna said: It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Shammai say: One may not feed the impoverished and soldiers <i>demai</i>.</b>

### Part 15
We learned in the mishna: If, among the diners, one ate <b>first tithe from which its <i>teruma</i> was</b> already <b>taken,</b> he may be included in a <i>zimmun</i>. The Gemara remarks: <b>It is obvious</b> that if the <i>teruma</i> was already taken there is no problem. Why was it necessary for the mishna to teach that one can join a <i>zimmun</i>? The Gemara explains: <b>It was only necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>in</b> a case where the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest while the grain was still <b>on the stalks, and he separated the <i>teruma</i> of the tithes</b> but <b>did not separate the <i>teruma gedola</i>.</b> <i>Teruma gedola</i> was not separated from the tithe that was eaten by the Levite. Although this should not be done <i>ab initio</i>, after the fact it is permitted, and one who eats first tithe produce under these circumstances may be included in a <i>zimmun</i>. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abbahu, as Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Reish Lakish said: First tithe</b> in which the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest while the grain was still <b>on the stalks is exempt from <i>teruma gedola</i>, as it is stated: “And you shall set apart from it a gift for the Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe”</b> (Numbers 18:26). This verse <b>teaches</b> that the Levite is obligated to set apart <b>a tenth part of the tithe,</b> i.e., the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe <b>and not <i>teruma gedola</i> and the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: If so, even if</b> the Levite <b>preceded</b> the priest after the kernels of grain were removed from the stalks and placed <b>in a pile,</b> the Levite should not have to separate <i>teruma gedola</i>. Abaye <b>said to him: With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse stated:</b>
