### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This story proves that <b>prayer is greater than good deeds</b> without prayer (<i>Tosafot</i>), as <b>there was none greater in</b> the performance of <b>good deeds than Moses our teacher; nevertheless, his request was granted,</b> albeit in a limited manner, in his request to enter Eretz Yisrael, <b>only through prayer,</b> when God permitted him to climb the mountain and look out over the land. <b>As,</b> initially <b>it is stated: “Speak no more to Me,” juxtaposed to which is: “Go up to the summit of the mountain.”</b>

### Part 2
After comparing and contrasting prayer and good deeds, the Gemara explores another comparison. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: A fast is greater than charity. What is the reason</b> that fasting is greater? Because a fast <b>is</b> a mitzva performed <b>with one’s body</b> as he afflicts himself, <b>while</b> charity <b>is</b> performed only <b>with one’s money.</b>

### Part 3
In another comparison, <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Prayer is greater than sacrifices, as it is stated: “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me,</b> says the Lord. I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; I do not desire the blood of bulls and sheep and goats” (Isaiah 1:11). <b>And</b> several verses later <b>it is written: “And when you spread forth your hands</b> I will hide My eyes from you, and even if you increase your prayer, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood” (Isaiah 1:15). Not only Israel’s sacrifices, but even their prayers, which are on a higher spiritual level, will not be accepted.

### Part 4
Speaking of that verse in Isaiah, the Gemara cites that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Any priest who killed a person may not lift his hands</b> in the Priestly Blessing <b>as it is stated:</b> “And when you spread forth your hands I will hide My eyes from you…<b>your hands are full of blood.”</b> Here we see that the Priestly Blessing, performed with hands spread forth, is not accepted when performed by priests whose “hands are full of blood.”

### Part 5
On the subject of prayer, <b>Rabbi Elazar also said: Since the day the Temple was destroyed the gates of prayer were locked</b> and prayer is not accepted as it once was, <b>as it is said</b> in lamentation of the Temple’s destruction: <b>“Though I plead and call out, He shuts out my prayer”</b> (Lamentations 3:8). Yet, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that the gates of prayer were locked</b> with the destruction of the Temple, <b>the gates of tears were not locked,</b> and one who cries before God may rest assured that his prayers will be answered, <b>as it is stated: “Hear my prayer, Lord, and give ear to my pleading, keep not silence at my tears”</b> (Psalms 39:13). Since this prayer is a request that God should pay heed to the tears of one who is praying, he is certain that at least the gates of tears are not locked.

### Part 6
With regard to the locking of the gates of prayer, the Gemara relates that <b>Rava did not decree a fast on a cloudy day because it is stated: “You have covered Yourself in a cloud, through which prayer cannot pass”</b> (Lamentations 3:44). The verse indicates that clouds are a bad omen, indicating that God has averted His face (Rav Hai Gaon).

### Part 7
<b>And Rabbi Elazar said: Since the day the Temple was destroyed an iron wall separates Israel from their Father in heaven, as it is stated</b> to the prophet Ezekiel, instructing him to symbolize that separation: <b>“And take for yourself an iron griddle, and set it as an iron wall between yourself and the city…</b>it will be a sign for the house of Israel” (Ezekiel 4:3).

### Part 8
The Gemara cites other statements in praise of prayer: <b>Rabbi Ḥanin said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Anyone who prolongs his prayer is</b> assured that <b>his prayer does not return unanswered;</b> it will surely be accepted. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From Moses our teacher, as it is stated</b> that Moses said: “So I fell down before the Lord the forty days and forty nights that I fell down; <b>and I prayed to the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:26–27), <b>and it is written thereafter: “And the Lord heard me that time as well,</b> the Lord would not destroy you” (Deuteronomy 10:10).

### Part 9
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who prolongs his prayer and expects it to be answered, will ultimately come to heartache,</b> as it will not be answered. <b>As it is stated: “Hope deferred makes the heart sick”</b> (Proverbs 13:12). <b>And what is the remedy</b> for one afflicted with that illness? He should <b>engage in Torah</b> study, <b>as it is stated: “But desire fulfilled is the tree of life”</b> (Proverbs 13:12), <b>and tree of life is nothing other than Torah, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to those who hold fast to it,</b> and those who support it are joyous” (Proverbs 3:18). This is <b>not difficult. This,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba’s statement that one will suffer heartache refers to one <b>who prolongs</b> his prayer <b>and expects it to be answered; that,</b> Rabbi Ḥanin’s statement that one who prolongs his prayer is praiseworthy refers to <b>one who prolongs his prayer and</b> does <b>not expect it to be answered.</b>

### Part 10
On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: A person who prayed and saw that he was not answered,</b> should <b>pray again, as it is stated: “Hope in the Lord, strengthen yourself, let your heart take courage, and hope in the Lord”</b> (Psalms 27:14). One should turn to God with hope, and if necessary turn to God again with hope.

### Part 11
Connected to the emphasis on the need to bolster one’s effort in prayer, the Gemara notes that <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Four</b> things <b>require bolstering,</b> constant effort to improve, <b>and they are: Torah, good deeds, prayer, and occupation.</b>

### Part 12
For each of these, a biblical proof is cited: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>Torah and good deeds</b> require bolstering? <b>As it is stated</b> in the instruction to Joshua: <b>“Only be strong and be extremely courageous, observe and do all of the Torah</b> that Moses My servant commanded you; do not deviate to the right or to the left, that you may succeed wherever you go” (Joshua 1:7). In this verse, observe refers to Torah study and do refers to good deeds (Maharsha); the apparently repetitive language is not extraneous. The Gemara derives: <b>Be strong in Torah and be courageous in good deeds.</b>

### Part 13
<b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>prayer</b> requires bolstering? <b>As it is said: “Hope in the Lord, strengthen yourself, let your heart take courage, and hope in the Lord.”</b>

### Part 14
<b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>occupation</b> requires bolstering? <b>As it is stated: “Be strong and we will be strong for the sake of our nation</b> and for the cities of our God” (II Samuel 10:12). All of one’s labor requires bolstering.

### Part 15
The Gemara cites a midrash on the following verse from Isaiah, relating to the sin of the Golden Calf and Moses’ supplication for forgiveness: <b>“But Zion said: The Lord has forsaken me and the Lord has forgotten me.</b> Can a woman forget her suckling baby, that she would not have compassion for the child of her womb? These may forget, but you I will not forget” (Isaiah 49:14–15). The Gemara seeks to clarify: <b>Forsaken is the same as forgotten.</b> They are synonymous; why repeat the same idea twice? <b>Reish Lakish said: The community of Israel said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> even when <b>a man marries</b> a second <b>wife after his first wife, he</b> certainly <b>recalls the deeds of his first</b> wife. Yet <b>You have</b> not only <b>forsaken me,</b> but You have <b>forgotten me</b> as well.

### Part 16
<b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to</b> Israel: <b>My daughter, I created twelve constellations in the firmament, and for each and every constellation I have created thirty armies, and for each and every army I have created thirty legions [<i>ligyon</i>], and for each and every legion I have created thirty infantry division leaders [<i>rahaton</i>], and for each and every infantry division leader I have created thirty military camp leaders [<i>karton</i>], and for each and every military camp leader I have created thirty leaders of forts [<i>gastera</i>], and on each and every leader of a fort I have hung three hundred and sixty-five thousand stars corresponding to the days of the solar year. And all of them I have created only for your sake; and you said</b> the Lord <b>has forsaken me and</b> the Lord <b>has forgotten me?</b>

### Part 17
The verse goes on to say: <b>“Can a woman forget her suckling baby,</b> that she would not have compassion for the child of her womb? These may forget, but you I will not forget.” The meaning of this verse is that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said</b> to the community of Israel: <b>Have I forgotten the ram offerings and firstborn animals that you offered before Me in the desert?</b> The community of Israel <b>replied to Him: Master of the Universe, since there is no forgetfulness before the Throne of Your Glory, perhaps you will not forget my sin of the Golden Calf?</b> God <b>responded to</b> Israel: <b>“These [<i>elu</i>] too shall be forgotten.” “</b>These” is a reference to the sin of the Golden Calf, regarding which Israel said: “These [<i>elu</i>] are your gods.”

### Part 18
The community of Israel <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, since there is forgetfulness before the Throne of Your Glory, perhaps You will</b> also <b>forget the events</b> revolving around the revelation at <b>Sinai?</b> God <b>said to</b> Israel: <b>I [<i>anokhi</i>] will not forget you</b> the revelation at Sinai, which began with: “I [<i>anokhi</i>] am the Lord your God.”

### Part 19
The Gemara notes: <b>That</b> is what <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rav Oshaya said: What is</b> the meaning of that which is <b>written: “These too will be forgotten”? That is the sin of the Golden Calf.</b> And what is the meaning of <b>I will not forget you? Those are the events</b> that transpired at <b>Sinai.</b>

### Part 20
We learned in the mishna that <b>the early</b> generations of <b>pious</b> men <b>would wait one hour</b> in order to achieve the solemn frame of mind appropriate for prayer.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> This is alluded to when <b>the verse states: “Happy are those who dwell in Your House”</b> (Psalms 84:5), immediately after which it is said: “They will yet praise You, Selah.”

### Part 22
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who prays must</b> also <b>wait one hour after his prayer, as it is stated: “Surely the righteous will give thanks unto Your name, the upright will sit before You”</b> (Psalms 140:14), meaning that after thanking God through prayer, one should stay and sit before Him.

### Part 23
<b>That</b> opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who prays must wait one hour before his prayer and one hour after his prayer. From where</b> is it derived that one must wait one hour <b>before his prayer? As it is stated: “Happy are those who dwell in Your House.” And from where</b> is it derived that one must stay one hour <b>after his prayer? As it is written: “Surely the righteous will give thanks unto Your name, the upright will sit before You.”</b>

### Part 24
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to waiting before and after prayer: <b>The early</b> generations of <b>pious</b> men <b>would wait one hour, pray one hour, then wait one hour again.</b> This raises the question: <b>Since</b> the early pious men <b>would spend nine hours per day</b> engaged either <b>in prayer</b> or the requisite waiting periods before and after prayer, three hours each for the morning, afternoon, and evening prayers, <b>how is their Torah preserved?</b> There was little time remaining to review their studies. <b>And how was their work accomplished?</b>

### Part 25
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, because they were pious</b> they merited that <b>their Torah is preserved and their work is blessed.</b>

### Part 26
Additionally, we learned in the mishna: <b>Even</b> if <b>the king greets him</b> while he is praying, <b>he should not respond to him</b> as one may not interrupt his prayer.

### Part 27
In limiting application of this principle, <b>Rav Yosef said: They only taught</b> this mishna <b>with regard to kings of Israel,</b> as a Jewish king would understand that the individual did not fail to respond to his greeting due to disrespect for the king. <b>However, with regard to kings of the nations of the world, he interrupts</b> his prayer and responds to their greeting due to the potential danger.

### Part 28
The Gemara <b>raised an objection</b> to Rav Yosef’s statement: <b>One who is praying and saw a violent person,</b> feared by all, <b>coming toward him,</b> or <b>a carriage coming toward him</b> and he is in the way, <b>he should not stop</b> his prayer <b>but rather abridge it and move</b> out of the way.

### Part 29
The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult.</b> Rather, <b>this</b> that teaches to abridge one’s prayer rather than stopping, refers to a case <b>where it is possible to abridge</b> his prayer and complete it in time, in which case he <b>should abridge</b> it. <b>And if</b> it is <b>not</b> a situation where he can abridge his prayer, <b>he interrupts</b> his prayer.

### Part 30
<b>The Sages taught:</b> There was <b>a</b> related <b>incident, involving a particular pious man who was praying</b> while traveling <b>along his path</b> when <b>an officer [<i>hegmon</i>] came and greeted him.</b> The pious man did not pause from his prayer <b>and did not respond with a greeting.</b> The officer <b>waited for him until he finished his prayer.</b><br><b>After he finished his prayer,</b> the officer <b>said to him:</b> You <b>good for nothing.</b> You endangered yourself; I could have killed you.<br><b>Isn’t it written in your Torah: “Take utmost care and guard yourself diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9)? <br><b>And it is</b> also <b>written: “Take therefore good heed unto yourselves”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:15)? Why did you ignore the danger to your life? <br><b>When I greeted you, why did you not respond with a greeting?</b> <br><b>Were I to sever your head with a sword, who would hold me accountable for your</b> spilled <b>blood?</b>

### Part 31
The pious man <b>said to him: Wait for me until I will appease you with</b> my <b>words.</b> <br><b>He said to him: Had you been standing before a flesh and blood king and your friend came and greeted you,</b> would <b>you</b><br><b>return his</b> greeting?
