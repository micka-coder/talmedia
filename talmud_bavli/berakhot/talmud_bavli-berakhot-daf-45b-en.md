### Part 1
in the case of a waiter, <b>because from the outset, they prefer to establish</b> their <i>zimmun</i> <b>as an obligation</b> rather than as an option.

### Part 2
The Gemara cites yet another proof. <b>Come and hear: Women form a <i>zimmun</i> for themselves and slaves form a <i>zimmun</i> for themselves;</b> however, <b>women, slaves, and minors,</b> even <b>if they wish to form a <i>zimmun</i></b> together, <b>they may not form a <i>zimmun</i>. <b>But aren’t one hundred women</b> considered <b>the equivalent of two men,</b> in that they cannot constitute a prayer quorum? <b>And</b> yet, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>women form a <i>zimmun</i> for themselves and </b>Canaanite<b> slaves form a <i>zimmun</i> for themselves</b>. Apparently, like women, two men can form a <i>zimmun</i> on their own.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara rejects this: <b>There it is different because,</b> although women cannot constitute a prayer quorum, since <b>there are</b> three individual <b>minds,</b> i.e., people, three women can fulfill the verse: “Praise God with me, and we will exalt His name together.” Two men cannot.

### Part 4
The Gemara objects: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Women and slaves, if they wish to form a <i>zimmun</i>, they may not form a <i>zimmun</i>. Why not? Aren’t</b> they individual <b>minds,</b> which should enable the collective praise of God?

### Part 5
The Gemara responds: That is not the reason that women and slaves were prohibited from forming a <i>zimmun</i> together. Rather, <b>it is different there,</b> as the Sages were concerned with regard to women and slaves joining together <b>due to promiscuity.</b>

### Part 6
In the dispute between Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan, it is unclear which <i>amora</i> held which opinion. The Gemara seeks to resolve this: <b>Conclude that Rav</b> is the one who <b>said: If they wanted to join together, they may not form a <i>zimmun</i>. As Rav Dimi bar Yosef said</b> that <b>Rav said: Three</b> people <b>who ate as one and one of them went out to the marketplace, they call him and include him in the <i>zimmun</i>. The reason is because they call him;</b> by inference, <b>if they do not call him, no,</b> they cannot form a <i>zimmun</i>.

### Part 7
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>It is different there,</b> in the case of three who ate together and one of them left, because <b>from the outset, they established themselves as</b> a group of three who were <b>obligated</b> to form a <i>zimmun</i>. That is why they need to call him and include him in their <i>zimmun</i>.

### Part 8
The Gemara now attempts to prove the opposite: <b>Rather, conclude that Rabbi Yoḥanan is the one who said: If they wanted to join together, they may not form a <i>zimmun</i>, as Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Two</b> people <b>who ate as one, one fulfills his obligation</b> to recite a blessing <b>with the</b> recitation of the <b>blessing of the other.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara comments: <b>And we discussed it</b> in an attempt to clarify the <i>halakha</i>. <b>What is he teaching us? We</b> already <b>learned this</b> <i>halakha</i> explicitly: <b>One who heard</b> a blessing <b>and did not respond,</b> nevertheless <b>he fulfilled</b> his obligation <b>And Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement teaches us that <b>there is no blessing of <i>zimmun</i> among them.</b> Indeed, <b>conclude</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan is the <i>amora</i> who held that two may not form a <i>zimmun</i>.

### Part 10
With regard to this, <b>Rava bar Rav Huna said to</b> his father <b>Rav Huna: Didn’t the Sages who came from the West,</b> from Eretz Yisrael, <b>say that</b> two individuals who ate together, <b>if they wanted to join together, they may form a <i>zimmun</i>? What, is it not that they heard</b> it <b>from Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who was from Eretz Yisrael? Rav Huna answered: <b>No,</b> this is not a proof, as it is possible <b>that they heard</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from Rav before he</b> left Eretz Yisrael and <b>descended to Babylonia.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara now explains <b>the matter</b> of Rav’s statement <b>itself: Rav Dimi bar Yosef said</b> that <b>Rav said: Three</b> people <b>who ate as one and one of them went out to the marketplace, they call him and include him in the <i>zimmun</i>,</b> even if he is not beside them. And <b>Abaye said: This is</b> only in a case <b>that they call him and he responds,</b> but if he is too far away to answer he cannot be included.

### Part 12
<b>Mar Zutra said: We only said</b> this, that it is sufficient to hear and answer, <b>with regard to</b> a <i>zimmun</i> of <b>three; but, with regard to</b> a quorum of <b>ten,</b> they may not form a <i>zimmun</i> which includes mention of God’s name <b>until</b> the one who left <b>comes</b> and sits with them.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ashi strongly objects to this: On the contrary, the opposite is more reasonable. Nine</b> people who ate together <b>appear like ten,</b> so even if one is missing, the quorum does not seem to be incomplete. <b>Two</b> people who ate together <b>do not appear like three,</b> so it would be reasonable to require the actual presence of the third.

### Part 14
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Mar Zutra. <b>What </b>is<b> the reason? Because </b>in<b> </b>a <i>zimmun</i> of ten <b>they need to mention the Name of Heaven, </b>and<b> </b>it is<b> not proper conduct </b>to invoke the Name of Heaven with <b>fewer than ten</b> people present.</b>

### Part 15
With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>zimmun</i>, <b>Abaye said</b> that <b>we have a tradition: Two</b> people <b>who ate as one, it is a mitzva</b> for them <b>to separate</b> and for each to recite a blessing for himself. <b>This was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Two</b> people <b>who ate as one, it is a mitzva</b> for them <b>to separate</b> The <i>baraita</i>, however, adds: <b>In what</b> case <b>are these matters stated?</b> Specifically <b>when both</b> individuals <b>are learned people [<i>soferim</i>]</b> and capable of reciting prayers and blessings. <b>However,</b> if <b>one of them was a learned person and the other an ignoramus, the learned person recites the blessing</b> and <b>the ignoramus thereby fulfills</b> his obligation.

### Part 16
<b>Rava said: This is a statement that I said and it was stated in the name of Rabbi Zeira in accordance with my</b> opinion: <b>Three</b> people <b>who ate as one</b> but did not conclude their meals together, <b>one interrupts</b> his meal in order <b>to</b> join the other <b>two</b> in a <i>zimmun</i>, <b>but two do not interrupt</b> their meal <b>to</b> join the other <b>one</b> in a <i>zimmun</i>.

### Part 17
The Gemara challenges: <b>And</b> do two really <b>not</b> interrupt their meal to join the other one in a <i>zimmun</i>? <b>Didn’t Rav Pappa interrupt</b> his meal <b>to</b> enable <b>Abba Mar, his son,</b> to recite the <i>zimmun</i> blessing; and, in that case, it was Rav Pappa <b>and one</b> other person? The Gemara responds: The case of <b>Rav Pappa is different, as</b> he <b>acted beyond the letter of the law.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara relates that three Sages, <b>Yehuda bar Mareimar, Mar bar Rav Ashi and Rav Aḥa of Difti ate bread together. None among them was greater than the other</b> in either age or wisdom, rendering him the obvious choice to <b>recite the blessing on their behalf. They sat down and raised a dilemma: That which we learned</b> in our mishna: <b>Three</b> people <b>who ate as one are required to join together</b> and recite Grace after Meals, does <b>that apply only when there is a great man</b> among them, <b>but where they are on a par with each other,</b> perhaps <b>separating</b> and reciting independent <b>blessings is preferable?</b>

### Part 19
Indeed, that is what they did, and <b>each person recited the blessing for himself.</b> Later, <b>they came before Mareimar</b> to ask him if they had acted correctly. Mareimar <b>said to them:</b> Although <b>you fulfilled your</b> obligation to recite a <b>blessing</b> over your food, <b>you did not fulfill</b> your obligation to form a <b><i>zimmun</i>. And if you say: Let us go back and form a <i>zimmun</i>, there is no retroactive <i>zimmun</i>.</b> Once the blessing over the meal has been recited, one can no longer recite the <i>zimmun</i>.

### Part 20
The Gemara discusses another question: <b>One who came and found them reciting the</b> <i>zimmun</i> <b>blessing, what does he say after them</b> in response to the <i>zimmun</i>.<b>Rav Zevid said</b> that he says: <b>Blessed</b> is He <b>and blessed</b> is His Name for ever and all time (<i>Tosafot</i>). <b>Rav Pappa said: He answers amen.</b>

### Part 21
The Gemara explains that Rav Zevid and Rav Pappa <b>do not disagree. This is</b> in a case <b>where he found them saying: Let us bless; and that is</b> in a case <b>where he found them saying: Blessed be.</b> The Gemara specifies: <b>Where he found them saying: Let us bless, he says: Blessed</b> is He <b>and blessed</b> is His Name for ever and all time; <b>where he found them saying: Blessed be, he answers amen.</b>

### Part 22
A similar explanation resolves a difficulty in a related topic. <b>One</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>taught: One who answers amen after his</b> own <b>blessings, it is praiseworthy. Another</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>taught: It is reprehensible.</b>

### Part 23
The Gemara resolves this apparent contradiction: This is <b>not difficult. This,</b> where the first <i>baraita</i> says that it is praiseworthy to answer amen after his own blessing, <b>is in</b> the blessing: <b>Who builds Jerusalem; this,</b> where the second <i>baraita</i> deems it offensive, <b>is in other blessings.</b>

### Part 24
The Gemara relates: <b>Abaye would answer</b> amen <b>aloud</b> after reciting the blessing: Who builds Jerusalem, <b>so the workers would hear and stand</b> to return to work, <b>as</b> the ensuing blessing: <b>Who is good and does good, is not</b> required <b>by Torah law,</b> so the laborers working for the homeowner need not recite it. <b>Rav Ashi,</b> on the other hand, would <b>answer</b> amen <b>in a whisper, so that</b> those who heard him <b>would not relate to</b> the blessing: <b>Who is good and does good, with contempt.</b>
