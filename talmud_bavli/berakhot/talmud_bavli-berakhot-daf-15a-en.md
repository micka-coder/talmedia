### Part 1
<b>should relieve himself, wash his hands, don phylacteries, recite <i>Shema</i>, and pray, and that is</b> acceptance of <b>the complete Kingdom of Heaven.</b>

### Part 2
On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who relieves himself, washes his hands, dons phylacteries, recites <i>Shema</i>, and prays, the verse ascribes</b> credit <b>to him as if he built an altar and offered a sacrifice upon it, as it is written: “I will wash in purity my hands, and I will encircle the altar of the Lord”</b> (Psalms 26:6). <b>Rava said to him: Do you not maintain, Master,</b> that one who does so, <b>it is as if he immersed</b> his entire body, <b>as it is written: “I will wash in purity,” and it is not written: “I will wash my hands”?</b>

### Part 3
<b>Ravina said to Rava: My Master, look at this Torah scholar [<i>tzurva merabbanan</i>] who came from</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>and said</b> something astonishing: <b>One who has no water with which to wash his hands,</b> it is sufficient that <b>he wipes his hands with earth, a rock, or a sliver</b> of wood.

### Part 4
Rava <b>replied to</b> Ravina: <b>He spoke well,</b> as, <b>is it written: I will wash with water? In purity, is written</b> referring to anything that cleans, <b>as Rav Ḥisda</b> would <b>curse one who</b> went out of his way <b>to seek water at the time of prayer.</b>

### Part 5
With regard to seeking water, the Gemara comments: <b>This applies only to the recitation of <i>Shema</i>,</b> as the time for its recitation is limited, and if one goes seeking water he may run out of time. <b>However, for prayer,</b> which may be recited all day, <b>one</b> must go out of his way <b>to seek</b> water. <b>And how</b> far must one go out of his way to seek water? <b>As far as a parasang [<i>parsa</i>]. And this,</b> one <i>parsa</i>, <b>applies only before him but behind him, he need not return even one <i>mil</i>. From this</b> one may infer that <b>he need not return one <i>mil</i>, but one must return less than one <i>mil</i>.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who recites <i>Shema</i> and did not</b> recite in a manner <b>audible to his own ear,</b> either because he read inaudibly or because he is deaf, <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: He did not fulfill</b> his obligation.

### Part 7
<b>One who recited</b> <i>Shema</i> and <b>was not</b> sufficiently <b>precise in</b> his enunciation of <b>its letters, Rabbi Yosei says: He fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He did not fulfill</b> his obligation.

### Part 8
<b>One who recited</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>out of order,</b> meaning he did not read the verses sequentially, <b>he did not fulfill</b> his obligation. <b>One who recited and erred, should return to the place</b> in <i>Shema</i> <b>that he erred.</b>

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The discussion in our mishna dealt with the question of whether or not one who recites <i>Shema</i> without hearing it fulfilled his obligation. The Gemara clarifies the opinions cited in the mishna: <b>What is the reason for Rabbi Yosei’s</b> opinion that one must recite <i>Shema</i> in a manner audible to his own ear? <b>Because it is written: <i>Shema</i>,</b> hear, and Rabbi Yosei holds that this is to be understood literally, meaning: <b>Make your ears hear what your mouth utters. The first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who holds that one fulfills his obligation even if he does not hear his recitation of <i>Shema</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b><i>Shema</i>,</b> hear, comes to teach something else; one may recite <i>Shema</i> <b>in any language that one</b> can <b>hear</b> and understand, and there is no requirement to recite <i>Shema</i> specifically in Hebrew.

### Part 10
<b>And Rabbi Yosei</b> agrees with the principle derived by the first <i>tanna</i> from the word <i>Shema</i>; however Rabbi Yosei holds: <b>Derive two</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>from</b> the word <i>Shema</i>; first, one may recite <i>Shema</i> in any language, and second, one must recite it in a manner audible to his own ears.

### Part 11
<b>We learned there</b> in a mishna regarding the laws of separating tithes: <b>A deaf person who can speak but cannot hear may not separate <i>teruma</i></b> <i>ab initio</i>, because he must recite a blessing over the separation of <i>teruma</i> and he is unable to hear the blessing. <b>But</b> after the fact, <b>if he did separate it, his <i>teruma</i> is</b> valid <b><i>teruma</i>.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> this <b><i>tanna</i></b> who holds that if <b>a deaf person who can speak but cannot hear</b> separates <i>teruma</i>, <b>it is</b> considered <i>teruma</i> <b>after the fact,</b> but <b><i>ab initio</i></b> he may <b>not</b> do so?

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: It is Rabbi Yosei, as we learned</b> in our mishna: <b>One who recites <i>Shema</i> and did not</b> recite it so it was <b>audible to his own ear, he fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>This is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: He did not fulfill</b> his obligation.

### Part 14
Rav Ḥisda elaborates: <b>Rabbi Yosei only stated</b> that a deaf person <b>did not fulfill</b> his obligation even after the fact <b>with regard to the recitation of <i>Shema</i>,</b> which is a <b>biblical</b> obligation. <b>But</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> the concern is <b>due to the blessing recited over</b> its separation. <b>And the blessing is</b> by <b>rabbinic law,</b> and the separation of <i>teruma</i> itself <b>is not contingent upon the blessing.</b> The separation of <i>teruma</i> takes effect regardless of whether or not a blessing is recited, so in the case of a deaf person, he fulfilled his obligation after the fact.

### Part 15
The Gemara challenges the assertion that this mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei: <b>And from where</b> do you infer that <b>this is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei? Perhaps it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and he said that with regard to the recitation of <i>Shema</i> as well,</b> if one did not recite it in a manner audible to his own ears, <b>he has</b> fulfilled his obligation <b>after the fact,</b> but <b><i>ab initio</i></b> he may <b>not</b> do so. This opinion is identical to that of the <i>tanna</i> in the case of <i>teruma</i>. <b>Know</b> that this is true because <b>it was taught</b> in the mishna: <b>One who recites</b> <i>Shema</i> without it being audible to his own ear. The <i>tanna</i> formulated the dispute in a case which was <b>after the fact.</b> If one already recited <i>Shema</i> in this manner, <b>yes,</b> he fulfilled his obligation. The <i>tanna</i> did not formulate the case in the mishna using <i>ab initio</i> language, i.e., one may recite <i>Shema</i> in a manner inaudible to his own ears because, <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> he may <b>not</b> do so according to Rabbi Yehuda.

### Part 16
The Gemara rejects this proof. In explanation, <b>they say:</b> The fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> utilizing the after the fact language: <b>One who recited,</b> does not prove that Rabbi Yehuda also holds that one may not <i>ab initio</i> recite <i>Shema</i> in a manner inaudible to his own ears. Rather, the mishna formulated the <i>halakha</i> in that manner <b>is to convey the far-reaching</b> nature of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei, who said that</b> if one does so, even <b>after the fact, he did not fulfill</b> his obligation to recite <i>Shema</i>. <b>As, if it</b> sought to convey the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> then <b>even <i>ab initio</i> he</b> may <b>fulfill</b> his obligation without hearing the recitation.

### Part 17
The Gemara challenges this conclusion: <b>How did you establish</b> the reasoning of the mishna dealing with the laws of <i>terumot</i>? <b>In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who holds that one who does not hear his recitation does not fulfill his obligation even after the fact. <b>But</b> what about <b>that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not recite the Grace after Meals,</b> which like <i>Shema</i> and unlike the blessing on separating <i>teruma</i> is a Torah commandment, <b>in his heart,</b> inaudibly, <b>and if he recited</b> the blessing in that manner, <b>he fulfilled</b> his obligation?

### Part 18
In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance <b>neither</b> with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei nor</b> with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. As if</b> you say that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, didn’t he say</b> according to the way the Gemara explained his position that even <b><i>ab initio</i> he may fulfill</b> his obligation in that manner, and he need not recite it audibly. In that case, why should one refrain from reciting the blessing in his heart? And <b>if</b> you say that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei;</b> he holds that even <b>after the fact, he did not</b> fulfill his obligation.

### Part 19
<b>Rather, what</b> must we say? We must revert to the explanation that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> who holds that <b>after the fact, yes,</b> he fulfilled his obligation, but <b><i>ab initio</i>, no,</b> one may not recite it in a manner inaudible to his own ears. Therefore the <i>baraita</i> concerning Grace after Meals is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.

### Part 20
The Gemara questions this: <b>But</b> what about <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>which was taught by Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi: A deaf</b> person <b>who speaks but does not hear may, <i>ab initio</i>, separate <i>teruma</i>.</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is that</b> <i>baraita</i>?

### Part 21
According to what we have said, <b>it is</b> in accordance <b>neither</b> with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda nor</b> with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. As if</b> you say that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, didn’t he say</b> that <b>after the fact, yes,</b> he fulfilled his obligation, although it was inaudible to his own ears, but <b><i>ab initio</i>, no,</b> he may not fulfill his obligation in that manner? And <b>if</b> you say that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, didn’t he say</b> that if he does not hear himself, <b>even after the fact he</b> did <b>not</b> fulfill his obligation? If so, whose opinion is reflected in this <i>baraita</i>?

### Part 22
<b>Rather,</b> we must revert to the previous explanation but with a slight revision, and say that <b>actually it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and even <i>ab initio</i>,</b> a deaf person may <b>also</b> separate <i>teruma</i>. <b>And this is not difficult</b> and there is no contradiction between the mishna and the <i>baraita</i>, <b>as this is his</b> own opinion <b>and that is his teacher’s</b> opinion. <b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: One who recites <i>Shema</i> must make it audible to his ears, as it is stated: “Hear, Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.”</b> This means that he must do so, but after the fact, if he failed to do so, he nevertheless fulfilled his obligation. The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Meir said to him: It says: “Which I command you this day, upon your heart;”</b> which Rabbi Meir explains to mean that <b>the</b> significance of the <b>words follows the intention of the heart</b> and even <i>ab initio</i> one need not recite <i>Shema</i> audibly.

### Part 23
The Gemara notes: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> point and the entire <i>baraita</i> has been cited, <b>even</b> if <b>you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>his teacher,</b> that only after the fact, does a deaf person fulfill his obligation, <b>it is,</b> nevertheless, <b>not difficult</b> and the different <i>baraitot</i> are not contradictory. As <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> permitting a deaf person to separate <i>teruma ab initio</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> while <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> that holds that he may not recite Grace after Meals <i>ab initio</i> but after the fact he fulfilled his obligation is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 24
The Gemara cites a similar discussion with regard to the reading of the Megilla: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> in tractate <i>Megilla</i>: <b>All are fit to read the Megilla except a deaf person, an imbecile, and a minor. And Rabbi Yehuda deems a minor fit.</b>

### Part 25
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who holds that even <b>after the fact,</b> the reading of <b>a deaf person</b> is <b>not</b> valid? <b>Rav Mattana said: It is Rabbi Yosei, as we learned</b> in our mishna: <b>One who recites <i>Shema</i> and did not</b> recite it so it was <b>audible to his own ear, fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: He did not fulfill</b> his obligation.

### Part 26
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> do you conclude that the mishna cited from tractate <i>Megilla</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, and</b> that <b>after the fact</b> his reading is <b>also not</b> valid?
