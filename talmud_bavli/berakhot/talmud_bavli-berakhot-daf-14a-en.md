### Part 1
<b>And at the</b> breaks between the <b>paragraphs one may greet due to respect and respond with a greeting to any person.</b> And if that is the case, the mishna is no longer difficult.

### Part 2
The Gemara remarks: <b>This</b> version of the dispute <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who is reciting <i>Shema</i> and happens upon his teacher or one who is greater than he, at the</b> breaks between the <b>paragraphs he may greet him due to respect and, needless to say, he may respond. And in the middle</b> of each paragraph, <b>he may greet</b> another <b>due to fear and, needless to say, he may respond.</b> This is the <b>statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: In the middle</b> of each paragraph <b>one may greet due to fear and respond due to respect. And in the</b> breaks between the <b>paragraphs one may greet due to respect and respond with a greeting to any person.</b> The proposed additions to the mishna appear in the version of the dispute cited in the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 3
<b>Aḥai, the <i>tanna</i></b> who recited <i>mishnayot</i> <b>in the school of Rabbi Ḥiyya, raised a dilemma before Rabbi Ḥiyya: May one interrupt during</b> the recitation of <b><i>hallel</i> and</b> the reading of <b>the Megilla,</b> Esther, to greet someone? Do <b>we say that</b> it is an <b><i>a fortiori</i> inference;</b> if in the middle of <b><i>Shema</i>, which is</b> a <b>biblical</b> obligation, <b>one may interrupt</b> in order to greet someone, <b>all the more so,</b> in the middle of <b><i>hallel</i>, which is</b> a <b>rabbinic</b> obligation, <b>one may interrupt? Or, perhaps, publicizing the miracle is more significant,</b> so one may not interrupt <i>hallel</i> or the Megilla at all.

### Part 4
Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: One interrupts and it is of no concern. Rabba said:</b> On <b>days when the individual completes</b> the entire <b><i>hallel</i>,</b> i.e., the days on which there is a rabbinic obligation to recite <i>hallel</i>, an individual <b>may interrupt between one paragraph and another;</b> however, <b>one may not interrupt in the middle of the paragraph.</b> On <b>days where the individual does not complete</b> the entire <b><i>hallel</i>,</b> i.e., days on which the recitation of <i>hallel</i> is merely a custom, not a rabbinic obligation, <b>one may interrupt even in the middle of the paragraph.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara questions this: <b>It that so? Didn’t Rav bar Shaba once happen</b> to come <b>before Ravina</b> on one of <b>the days when the individual does not complete</b> the entire <b><i>hallel</i>,</b> and Ravina <b>did not interrupt</b> his recitation of <i>hallel</i> to greet him?

### Part 6
The Gemara responds: The case of Rav bar Shaba <b>is different, as Rav bar Shaba was not considered important</b> to <b>Ravina.</b> That is the reason that he did not interrupt his recitation of <i>hallel</i> to greet him.

### Part 7
Having mentioned the dilemma raised by one of those who recite the <i>mishnayot</i> in the study hall, the Gemara cites that <b>Ashyan, the <i>tanna</i></b> who recited <i>mishnayot</i> <b>in the school of Rabbi Ami, raised a dilemma before Rabbi Ami: May one who is fasting taste</b> the food that he is preparing to determine if it spiced properly? <b>Did he accept upon himself</b> to refrain from <b>eating and drinking, and that</b> is <b>not</b> eating and drinking; it is merely tasting? <b>Or, perhaps, he accepted upon himself</b> to refrain from deriving <b>pleasure</b> from food, <b>and that is</b> pleasure when he tastes.

### Part 8
Rabbi Ami <b>said to him: He tastes and it is of no concern. This was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Tasting</b> a cooked dish <b>does not require a blessing</b> beforehand, <b>and one who is fasting</b> may <b>taste and it is of no concern.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>How much</b> may one who is fasting taste?

### Part 10
The Gemara responds: When <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> would fast, <b>they would taste up to a quarter</b> of a <i>log</i>.

### Part 11
<b>Rav said: Anyone who greets another</b> person in the morning <b>before he prayed, it is as if he built an altar</b> for idol worship, <b>as it is stated: “Cease you from man, in whose nostrils there is breath, for how little is he to be accounted”</b> (Isaiah 2:22). When one’s soul is breathed in through his nostrils in the morning (<i>ge’onim</i>) he should turn to no one other than God. <b>And do not read</b> it as it is written, <b><i>bameh</i>, how; but rather,</b> read <b><i>bama</i>, altar.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And Shmuel said:</b> The word <i>bameh</i> should not be taken in anything other than its literal connotation. The verse must therefore be understood: <b>How did you consider him</b> so significant, that you gave him priority <b>and not God?</b> Certainly you should have honored God first.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Sheshet raises an objection:</b> We learned in our mishna that <b>in the</b> breaks between the <b>paragraphs one may greet</b> an individual <b>due to respect, and respond</b> to another’s greeting due to respect, despite the fact that the recitation of <i>Shema</i> precedes the <i>Amida</i> prayer.

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Abba explained this:</b> The prohibition against greeting another in the morning refers specifically to <b>when one</b> sets out <b>early to</b> greet him at <b>his door.</b> If one simply happens to encounter another person, he is permitted to greet him.

### Part 15
With regard to this same verse, <b>Rabbi Yona said</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira said: Anyone who tends to his own affairs before he prays, it is as though he built an altar. They said to Rabbi Yona: Did you say</b> that it was as if one built <b>an altar?</b> Rabbi Yona <b>responded to them: No; I said</b> simply that it is <b>prohibited.</b>

### Part 16
<b>And as Rav Idi bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashyan said: A person is prohibited to attend to his own affairs before he prays, as it is stated: “Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall make His footsteps on a path”</b> (Psalms 85:14). One should first pray and acknowledge the righteousness of his Creator, and only then should he set out on his way.

### Part 17
And, <b>Rav Idi bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashyan said: Anyone who</b> first <b>prays and</b> only <b>then sets out on his way, the Holy One, Blessed be He, tends to his affairs, as it is stated: “Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall make His footsteps on a path.”</b> God will set righteousness before him and satisfy all his wishes, when he sets out on his way.

### Part 18
Having mentioned his name, the Gemara tangentially cites what <b>Rabbi Yona said</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira said: One who goes seven nights without a dream, is called evil, as it is stated: “He who has it will abide satisfied [<i>save’a</i>], he will not be visited by evil”</b> (Proverbs 19:23). Rabbi Yona reinterprets the verse: <b>Do not read <i>save’a</i>, satisfied, but <i>sheva</i>, seven.</b> One who sleeps for seven nights without being visited by a dream, is called evil.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, said to him: Rabbi Ḥiyya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: Anyone who fills himself with matters of Torah and goes to sleep, they do not deliver evil tidings to him, as it is stated: “He who lies satisfied, will not be visited by evil.”</b>

### Part 20
We learned in the mishna: <b>These are</b> the breaks <b>between the paragraphs</b> at which one is permitted to interrupt under certain circumstances. According to the first <i>tanna</i>, one may interrupt between the last paragraph of <i>Shema</i> and the blessing that follows it, but Rabbi Yehuda prohibits this.

### Part 21
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda who said that one may not interrupt between <i>eloheikhem</i> and <i>emet veyatziv</i>.</b> Furthermore, <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason for Rabbi Yehuda’s</b> opinion? This phrase evokes the verse <b>as it is written:</b>
