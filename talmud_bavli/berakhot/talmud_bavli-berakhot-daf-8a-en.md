### Part 1
<b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “But as for me, let my prayer be unto You, Lord, in a time of favor;</b> O God, in the abundance of Your mercy, answer me with the truth of Your salvation” (Psalms 69:14)? It appears that the individual is praying that his prayers will coincide with a special time of Divine favor. <b>When is a time of favor?</b> It is <b>at the time when the congregation is praying.</b> It is beneficial to pray together with the congregation, for God does not fail to respond to the entreaties of the congregation.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said that</b> the unique quality of communal prayer is derived <b>from here: “Thus said the Lord, in a time of acceptance I have answered you and on a day of salvation I have aided you”</b> (Isaiah 49:8).

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said</b> that it is derived <b>from here: “Behold, God is mighty, He despises no one”</b> (Job 36:5). He adopts an alternative reading of the verse: “Behold, God will not despise” the prayer of “the mighty,” i.e., the community. <b>And it is written: “He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came upon me; for there were many with me.</b> God shall hear and answer them…” (Psalms 55:19–20). This verse teaches that the prayer was answered because there were many with me when it was offered.

### Part 4
<b>That</b> last proof <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Natan says: From where do we know that the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not despise the prayer of the masses? As it is stated: “Behold, God does not despise the mighty,” and it is written: “He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came upon me;</b> for there were many with me.” Rabbi Natan interprets this not as David speaking about himself, but as God speaking to Israel. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, says: Anyone who engages in Torah</b> study, which is called peace in the verse: “All its ways are peace” (Proverbs 3:17); <b>and in acts of kindness, and prays with the congregation, I ascribe to him</b> credit <b>as if he redeemed Me and My children from among the nations of the world.</b>

### Part 5
Continuing to extol communal prayer, <b>Reish Lakish said: One who has a synagogue</b> nearby <b>in his city but does not enter to pray there is called an evil neighbor, as it is stated: “Thus said the Lord: As for all My evil neighbors who touch My inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit,</b> behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck the house of Judah up from among them” (Jeremiah 12:14). One who only touches, but does not enter the place of prayer, My inheritance, is considered an evil neighbor. <b>And furthermore,</b> he is punished in that <b>he causes himself and his children</b> to go into <b>exile, as it is stated: “Behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck the house of Judah up from among them.”</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara relates that when the Sages <b>told Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that <b>there are elders in Babylonia, he was confounded and said: It is written: “So that your days will be lengthened and the days of your children upon the land</b> the Lord swore to your forefathers to give to them like the days of heaven on the earth” (Deuteronomy 11:21); lengthened in Eretz Yisrael <b>but not outside of the Land.</b> Why then, do the residents of Babylonia live long lives? <b>When they told him</b> that the people in Babylonia <b>go early</b> in the morning <b>and go late</b> in the evening <b>to the synagogue, he said: That is what was effective for them</b> in extending their lives.

### Part 7
<b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said to his sons: Go early and go late and enter the synagogue, so that your lives will be extended.</b> And <b>Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> Upon <b>what verse</b> is this based? As it is stated: <b>“Happy is the man who listens to Me, watching daily at My gates, guarding at My door posts”</b> (Proverbs 8:34). <b>And</b> the reward for doing so <b>is written thereafter: “For whoso finds Me finds life and obtains the favor of the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 8:35).

### Part 8
Based on this verse, <b>Rav Ḥisda said: A person should always enter two doorways into the synagogue.</b> This statement is unclear. Immediately, the Gemara asks: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> that Rav Ḥisda meant that one should enter <b>two doorways</b> literally? What if a synagogue only has a single doorway? Rather, emend his statement and <b>say</b> that Rav Ḥisda meant that <b>one should enter a distance of two doorways</b> into the synagogue <b>and then pray.</b> In entering a distance of two doorways, one fulfills the verse: Guarding at My door posts, in the plural.

### Part 9
Having mentioned the verse, “For whoso finds Me finds life,” the Gemara seeks to clarify its meaning. It is said, <b>“For this, let every pious man pray to You in the time of finding,</b> that the overflowing waters may not reach him” (Psalms 32:6). With regard to the phrase, the time of finding, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: The time of finding</b> refers to the time one must find <b>a wife,</b> that one should pray to find a suitable woman to marry. <b>As it is said: “He who finds [<i>matza</i>] a wife finds [<i>matza</i>] good</b> and obtains favor from the Lord” (Proverbs 18:22).

### Part 10
<b>In Eretz Yisrael,</b> the custom was that <b>when a man married a woman, they would ask him: <i>Matza</i> or <i>motzeh</i>?</b> In other words, they would ask the groom whether the appropriate passage for his wife is the above verse from Proverbs that begins with the word <b><i>matza</i>, as it is written: “He who finds a wife finds good and obtains favor from the Lord”</b> or whether the more appropriate verse is the one beginning with the word <b><i>motzeh</i>, as it is written: “And I find [<i>motzeh</i>] the woman more bitter than death”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:26).

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Natan says: The time of finding</b> refers to the time of finding <b>Torah, as it is stated</b> in a verse referring to Torah: <b>“He who finds Me finds life.”</b> The Torah is the object most sought.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The time of finding</b> refers to <b>death.</b> One should pray that when death comes, he will leave the world peacefully, <b>as it is stated: “Issues [<i>totzaot</i>] of death”</b> (Psalms 68:21). Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s statement is based on the etymological similarity between <i>totzaot</i> and <i>matza</i>, finding.

### Part 13
<b>It was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Nine hundred and three types of death were created in the world, as it is stated: “Issues [<i>totzaot</i>] of death,” and that,</b> 903, <b>is the numerical value [<i>gimatriya</i>] of <i>totzaot</i></b>. The Gemara explains that <b>the most difficult of</b> all these types of death <b>is croup [<i>askara</i>],</b> while <b>the easiest is</b> the <b>kiss</b> of death. <b>Croup is like a thorn</b> entangled <b>in a wool fleece, which, when pulled out backwards,</b> tears the wool. <b>Some say that</b> croup <b>is like ropes at the entrance to the esophagus,</b> which would be nearly impossible to insert and excruciating to remove. The <b>kiss</b> of death <b>is like drawing a hair from milk.</b> One should pray that he does not die a painful death.

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The time of finding</b> refers to a respectful <b>burial,</b> for which one should pray. Supporting Rabbi Yoḥanan’s interpretation, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: What</b> is the <b>verse</b> that teaches that the time of finding refers to burial? <b>“Who rejoice in exultation and are glad when they can find a grave”</b> (Job 3:22), as there are situations in which one is relieved when his body finds a grave in which to rest. <b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila said, that is the</b> meaning of the <b>folk saying: A person should even pray for mercy until the final shovelful</b> of dirt <b>is thrown</b> upon his grave.

### Part 15
<b>Mar Zutra said: The time of finding</b> refers to finding <b>a lavatory.</b> As most places did not have a sewage system, one was forced to relieve himself outside the city. Because of this unpleasantness, finding a suitable location was called by Mar Zutra, the time of finding. <b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say: This</b> explanation <b>of Mar Zutra is preferable to all of them,</b> as the term <i>motza</i> is explicitly associated in the Bible (see II Kings 10:27) with the lavatory (Rabbi Abraham Moshe Horovitz).

### Part 16
Returning to the tractate’s central topic, <b>Rava said to Rafram bar Pappa: Let the Master say to us some of those outstanding statements that you said in the name of Rav Ḥisda with regard to matters of the synagogue.</b>

### Part 17
Rafram <b>said to him, Rav Ḥisda said as follows: What is</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“The Lord loves the gates of Zion [<i>Tziyyon</i>] more than all the dwellings of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 87:2)? This means that <b>the Lord loves the gates distinguished [<i>metzuyanim</i>] through</b> the study of <i>halakha</i> as they are the gates of Zion, the outstanding gates, <b>more than the synagogues and study halls.</b> Although those places are the most outstanding of the dwellings of Jacob, they are not engaged in the study of <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 18
<b>And this</b> concept, that <i>halakha</i> is the most sublime pursuit, is expressed in that which <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: Since the day the Temple,</b> where the Divine Presence rested in this world, <b>was destroyed, the Holy One, Blessed be He, has only</b> one place <b>in His world</b> where he reveals His presence exclusively; <b>only the four cubits</b> where the study <b>of <i>halakha</i></b> is undertaken<b>.</b>

### Part 19
This statement has practical ramifications. <b>Abaye said: At first I studied in the house and prayed in the synagogue. Once I heard what Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: Since the day the Temple was destroyed, the Holy One, Blessed be He, has only</b> one place <b>in His world, only the four cubits of <i>halakha</i> alone,</b> from which I understood the significance of the four cubits of <i>halakha</i>, and <b>I pray only where I study.</b>

### Part 20
Similarly, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, despite</b> the fact <b>that they had thirteen synagogues in Tiberias, they would only pray between the pillars where they studied.</b>

### Part 21
<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: One who benefits from his hard labor is greater than a God-fearing</b> person, i.e., one who is so enthralled by his fear of God that he sits idly by and does not work. <b>As with regard to a God-fearing</b> person, <b>it is written: “Happy is the man who fears the Lord,</b> who greatly desires His mitzvot” (Psalms 112:1), <b>while with regard to one who benefits from his hard work, it is written: “By the labor of your hands you will live; you are happy and it is good for you”</b> (Psalms 128:2). The Gemara explains this verse to mean that <b>you are happy in this world, and it is good for you in the World-to-Come. And regarding a God-fearing</b> person, happy is the man, is written about him but <b>and it is good for you, is not written about him.</b>

### Part 22
<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: One should always live in the place where his teacher</b> lives; thereby he will avoid sin. <b>For as long as Shimi ben Gera,</b> who according to tradition was a great Torah scholar and teacher of Solomon (see <i>Gittin</i> 59a), <b>was alive, Solomon did not marry Pharaoh’s daughter.</b> Immediately after the Bible relates the death of Shimi (I Kings, end of ch. 2), Solomon’s marriage to Pharaoh’s daughter is recorded (beginning of ch. 3).

### Part 23
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that one <b>should not live</b> where his teacher lives?

### Part 24
The Gemara answers: <b>This is not difficult. This,</b> which says that one should live where his teacher lives, is referring to a case <b>where he is acquiescent to</b> his teacher and will heed his teaching and instruction. <b>While this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which says that one should not live where his teacher lives, is referring to a case <b>where he is not acquiescent to him</b> and that will lead them to quarrel.

### Part 25
The Gemara again returns to the topic of the synagogue. <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Menaḥem said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said: What is</b> the practical halakhic meaning of <b>that which is written: “They who forsake the Lord will perish”</b> (Isaiah 1:28)? <b>This</b> verse <b>refers to one who abandons the Torah</b> scroll when it was taken out to be read <b>and leaves</b> the synagogue, as it appears that he is fleeing from God.

### Part 26
Practically speaking, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Abbahu would go out between</b> one <b>person</b> who read the Torah <b>and the</b> next <b>person</b> who did so. Since the scroll was closed between readers, it was not considered to be a show of contempt.

### Part 27
<b>Rav Pappa raised a dilemma: What is</b> the ruling with regard to leaving <b>between</b> one <b>verse and</b> the next <b>verse?</b> Is one permitted to leave during a break in the Torah reading while the verse was translated into Aramaic?

### Part 28
An answer to this question was not found, so the dilemma <b>stands</b> unresolved.

### Part 29
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Sheshet would turn his face</b> away from the Torah while it was being read <b>and study.</b> Explaining this practice, <b>he said: We are</b> engaged <b>in ours,</b> the study of the Oral Torah <b>and they are</b> engaged <b>in theirs,</b> listening to the Written Torah. Since Rav Sheshet was engaged in Torah study, he is not considered one who forsakes the Lord.

### Part 30
<b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said: A person should always complete his</b> Torah <b>portions with the congregation.</b> The congregation reads a particular Torah portion every Shabbat, and during the week prior to each Shabbat, one is required to read the <b>Bible</b> text of the weekly portion <b>twice and</b> the <b>translation once.</b>
