### Part 1
Because <b>whatever</b> offers more <b>protection is preferable</b> even at the cost of deprecation. <b>And where</b> under his head <b>does he place them? Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> He places them <b>between the pillow and the mattress, not</b> directly <b>aligned with his head</b> but rather a bit to the side.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach a</b> <i>baraita</i> that in that case <b>he places them in a pouch</b> used for phylacteries, directly <b>under his head?</b> The Gemara replies: He does so in a manner <b>that the bulge</b> in the <b>pouch,</b> where the phylacteries are, <b>protrudes out</b> and is not beneath his head.

### Part 3
On this note, the Gemara relates that <b>Bar Kappara would tie them in</b> his <b>bed curtain and project their bulge outward. Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, would place them on a bench and spread a cloth over them.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Hamnuna, son of Rav Yosef, said: I was once standing before Rava and he told me: Go</b> and <b>bring me</b> my <b>phylacteries. And I found them</b> in his bed, <b>between the mattress and the pillow, not aligned with his head. And I knew</b> that <b>it was the day of</b> his wife’s <b>immersion</b> in the ritual bath for purification from the ritual impurity of a menstruating woman, and he certainly engaged in marital relations in order to fulfill the mitzva, <b>and he did so,</b> he sent me to bring him his phylacteries, <b>to teach us the practical <i>halakha</i></b> in that case.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yosef, son of Rav Neḥunya,</b> who raised a dilemma above, <b>raised a dilemma before Rav Yehuda: Two individuals sleeping in a single bed,</b> given that it was standard practice to sleep without clothing, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>; is it permissible <b>for this</b> one <b>to turn his head</b> aside <b>and recite <i>Shema</i> and for that</b> one <b>turns his head and recites <i>Shema</i>;</b> or is it prohibited because they are unclothed and are considered unfit to recite <i>Shema</i> even though they are covered with a blanket? <b>He said to him: Shmuel said as follows:</b> This is permitted <b>even</b> if <b>his wife</b> is in bed <b>with him.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Yosef strongly objects to</b> this response: You say that he is permitted to recite <i>Shema</i> in bed with <b>his wife, and needless to say</b> he is permitted to do so when in bed with <b>another. On the contrary,</b> since <b>his wife is like his own flesh,</b> and he will not have lustful thoughts of her, it is permitted; <b>another is not like his own flesh</b> and it is prohibited.

### Part 7
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this from the resolution of an apparent contradiction between two <i>baraitot</i>. It was taught in one <i>baraita</i>: <b>Two</b> unclothed <b>individuals who are sleeping in a single bed, this</b> one <b>turns his head</b> aside <b>and recites</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>and that</b> one <b>turns his head</b> aside <b>and recites</b> <i>Shema</i>. <b>And it was taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who is sleeping in bed and his</b> unclothed <b>children and members of his household are beside him, may not recite <i>Shema</i> unless a garment separates between them. If his children and the members of his household were minors, it is permitted</b> to recite <i>Shema</i> even without a garment separating between them.

### Part 8
<b>Granted, according to Rav Yosef,</b> the apparent contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i> <b>is not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where his wife</b> is in the bed with him, <b>while this</b> other <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where another</b> person is in bed with him and there is concern lest he will have lustful thoughts. <b>However, according to Shmuel,</b> who permits one to recite <i>Shema</i> regardless of who is in bed with him, <b>it is</b> indeed <b>difficult.</b> How would he interpret the <i>baraita</i> that prohibits?

### Part 9
The Gemara replies: <b>Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you: And according to Rav Yosef’s</b> opinion, <b>does it</b> work out <b>well? Wasn’t it taught</b> in that same <i>baraita</i> that <b>one who is sleeping in bed and his children and members of his household are beside him, may not recite <i>Shema</i> unless a garment separates between them?</b> Doesn’t Rav Yosef hold that his wife is like his own flesh and no separation is necessary? <b>Rather, what have you to say</b> in response? <b>Rav Yosef holds that there is a tannaitic</b> dispute in the case of <b>one’s wife; I, too, hold that it is a tannaitic</b> dispute, and I accept the ruling of one of the <i>baraitot</i>.

### Part 10
The Gemara reverts to clarify something mentioned above. <b>The Master said</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>This</b> one <b>turns his head</b> aside <b>and recites <i>Shema.</i></b> The Gemara notes a difficulty: <b>Aren’t there</b> bare <b>buttocks?</b> This <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, as Rav Huna said: Buttocks do not constitute nakedness. Let us say</b> that the following mishna <b>supports Rav Huna’s</b> opinion: <b>A woman sits and separates her <i>ḥalla</i> naked,</b> despite the fact that she must recite a blessing over the separation of the <i>ḥalla</i>, <b>because she can cover her face,</b> a euphemism for her genitals, <b>in the ground, but a male,</b> whose genitals are not covered when he sits, may <b>not</b> do so. The mishna teaches that exposed buttocks do not constitute nakedness.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak interpreted</b> the mishna as referring to <b>a case where her face,</b> genitals, <b>was completely covered in the ground</b> such that her posterior was covered by the ground. Therefore, proof for Rav Huna’s opinion cannot be brought from this mishna.

### Part 12
<b>The Master said</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If his children and the members of his household were minors,</b> even though they are unclothed, <b>it is permitted</b> to recite <i>Shema</i> even without a garment separating between them. The Gemara asks: <b>Until what</b> age is one still considered a minor? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: A girl</b> until she is <b>three years and one day old, and a boy</b> until <b>he is nine years and one day old,</b> for these are the ages from which a sexual act in which they participate is considered a sexual act. <b>Some say: A girl eleven years and one day old and a boy of twelve years and one day old,</b> as that is the age at which they are considered adults in this regard. This age is only approximate, as the age of majority for both <b>this,</b> the boy, <b>and that,</b> the girl, is <b>at</b> the onset of puberty in accordance with the verse: <b>“Your breasts were formed and your hair was grown”</b> (Ezekiel 16:7).

### Part 13
<b>Rav Kahana said to Rav Ashi: There,</b> with regard to the law of phylacteries, <b>Rava said: Despite a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Shmuel, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel. Here, what</b> is the ruling? <b>He said to him: Were all of them woven in the same</b> act of <b>weaving?</b> Are there no distinctions between different cases? <b>Rather, where it is stated, it is stated, and where it is not stated, it is not stated,</b> and there is no comparison.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Mari said to Rav Pappa:</b> Does it constitute nakedness <b>if one’s</b> pubic <b>hair protruded from his garment?</b> Rav Pappa said <b>about him: A hair, a hair.</b> You are splitting hairs and being pedantic over trivialities.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak stated: An</b> exposed <b>handbreadth in a woman</b> constitutes <b>nakedness.</b> The Gemara asks: Regarding <b>which</b> <i>halakha</i> was this said? <b>If you say</b> that it comes to prohibit <b>looking at</b> an exposed handbreadth in <b>her, didn’t Rav Sheshet say: Why did the verse enumerate</b> “anklets and bracelets, rings, earrings and girdles” (Numbers 31:50), <b>jewelry that is</b> worn <b>externally,</b> over her clothing, e.g., bracelets, <b>together with jewelry</b> worn <b>internally,</b> beneath her clothing, near her nakedness, e.g., girdles? This was <b>to tell you: Anyone who gazes upon a woman’s little finger</b> is considered <b>as if he gazed upon her</b> naked <b>genitals,</b> for if his intentions are impure, it makes no difference where he looks or how much is exposed; even less than a handbreadth.

### Part 16
<b>Rather,</b> it is referring even to <b>his wife, with regard to</b> the <b>recitation of <i>Shema</i>.</b> One may not recite <i>Shema</i> before an exposed handbreadth of his wife.

### Part 17
Along these lines, <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> Even <b>a woman’s</b> exposed <b>leg</b> is considered <b>nakedness, as it is stated: “Uncover the leg and pass through the rivers”</b> (Isaiah 47:2), <b>and it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“Your nakedness shall be revealed and your shame shall be seen”</b> (Isaiah 47:3). <b>Shmuel</b> further <b>stated: A woman’s</b> singing <b>voice is</b> considered <b>nakedness,</b> which he derives from the praise accorded a woman’s voice, <b>as it is stated: “Sweet is your voice and your countenance is alluring”</b> (Song of Songs 2:14). Similarly, <b>Rav Sheshet stated:</b> Even <b>a woman’s hair is</b> considered <b>nakedness,</b> for it too is praised, <b>as it is written: “Your hair is like a flock of goats,</b> trailing down from Mount Gilead” (Song of Songs 4:1).

### Part 18
The Gemara resumes its discussion of phylacteries. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: I saw Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>hang his phylacteries.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection:</b> It was taught in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>one who hangs his phylacteries will have his life hang</b> in the balance.

### Part 19
Moreover, <b>the Symbolic Interpreters</b> of the Torah <b>said</b> that the verse: <b>“And your life shall hang in doubt before you [<i>minneged</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:66), that is the punishment of <b>one who hangs his phylacteries.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara replies: This apparent contradiction <b>is not difficult, as this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which condemns one who hangs his phylacteries, refers to one who hangs them <b>by the strap,</b> allowing the leather boxes into which the parchment is placed to dangle in a deprecating way, which is certainly prohibited. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which relates that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would hang his phylacteries and that it is clearly permitted, refers to when one hangs them <b>from the box</b> with the straps dangling.

### Part 21
<b>And if you wish, say</b> another explanation instead: <b>There is no difference</b> whether he hangs the phylacteries from the <b>strap and there is no difference</b> whether he hangs the phylacteries from <b>the box;</b> both <b>are prohibited. And when Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>hung</b> his phylacteries, <b>he hung them in</b> their <b>pouch.</b>

### Part 22
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what</b> is the purpose <b>to relate</b> that incident? The Gemara replies: <b>Lest you say</b> that phylacteries <b>would require placement</b> atop a surface, <b>as</b> is the custom with <b>a Torah scroll.</b> Therefore, <b>it teaches us</b> that this is unnecessary.

### Part 23
Since Rabbi Ḥanina related a story involving Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the Gemara cites another such story. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: I saw Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, while he was praying, <b>belch, yawn, sneeze, spit,</b>
