### Part 1
<b>“And the Lord, God, is True”</b> (Jeremiah 10:10).

### Part 2
After the conclusion of the final paragraph of <i>Shema</i> along with the first word of the subsequent blessing, with the words: “The Lord, your God, is True [<i>Hashem Eloheikhem emet</i>],” the question is posed: <b>Does one repeat <i>emet</i></b> when he begins the blessing of <i>emet veyatziv</i>, <b>or does he not repeat <i>emet</i>?</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He repeats <i>emet</i>. Rabba said: He does not repeat <i>emet</i>.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>This person who descended</b> to lead the service <b>before Rabba, Rabba heard that he said <i>emet</i>, <i>emet</i> twice. Rabba</b> mocked him and <b>said: Every <i>emet</i>, <i>emet</i> has caught this one;</b> he must be passionate about the pursuit of truth.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yosef said: How excellent is this tradition</b> that I heard, <b>as when Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he said: <b>In Eretz Yisrael, at the evening prayer</b> they do not recite the entire third portion of <i>Shema</i>, which deals with ritual fringes, as there is no obligation to wear ritual fringes at night. Rather, <b>they say</b> a condensed version of that portion that includes an excerpt from the beginning and an excerpt from the end: <b>“Speak to the children of Israel and say to them…I am the Lord, your God, True”</b> (Numbers 15:38, 41).

### Part 5
<b>Abaye said to him: What is excellent</b> about this tradition? <b>Didn’t Rav Kahana say</b> that <b>Rav said: One</b> should <b>not begin</b> to recite the portion of ritual fringes at night, <b>but if he does begin, he completes</b> it? <b>And if you say that:</b> Speak to the children of Israel <b>and say to them, is not considered the beginning</b> of the portion of ritual fringes, <b>didn’t Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak say</b> that <b>Rav said: Speak to the children of Israel, is not</b> considered <b>a beginning</b> of the portion of ritual fringes, as many passages in the Torah begin this way; <b>and say to them, is</b> considered <b>a beginning.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rav Pappa said: In Eretz Yisrael, they hold</b> that <b>and say to them, is not</b> considered <b>a beginning, until he said: And make for them ritual fringes.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said: Therefore, we begin</b> to recite the portion of ritual fringes, <b>since they begin</b> to recite it <b>in Eretz Yisrael. And once we begin</b> to recite it, <b>we complete it as well, as Rav Kahana said</b> that <b>Rav said: One</b> should <b>not begin</b> to recite the portion of ritual fringes at night, <b>but if he does begin, he completes</b> it.

### Part 8
<b>Ḥiyya bar Rav said: If</b> in the evening <b>one recited</b> the portion of ritual fringes concluding with: <b>I am the Lord, your God, he must recite: True</b> and Faithful [<b><i>emet</i></b> <i>ve’emuna</i>], and the entire blessing of redemption. However, <b>if he did not recite: I am the Lord, your God, he need not recite <i>emet</i></b> <i>ve’emuna</i>.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t he required to mention the exodus from Egypt</b> at night as well?

### Part 10
The Gemara responds: In place of reciting <i>emet ve’emuna</i> <b>he said the following</b> shorter passage: <b>We give thanks to You, Lord, our God, Who took us out from Egypt and redeemed us from the house of bondage, and performed miracles and mighty deeds on our behalf on the sea, and we sang unto You,</b> as this formula includes all of the content comprising <i>emet ve’emuna</i>.

### Part 11
We learned in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: Why did the portion of <i>Shema</i> precede</b> that of <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i>? So that one will first accept upon himself the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven and only then accept upon himself the yoke of the mitzvot.

### Part 12
<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai</b> offers a different explanation for the order of the portions of <i>Shema</i>. He <b>says: By right, <i>Shema</i> should precede <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> because</b> the <i>Shema</i> includes the directive <b>to learn, while</b> <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> includes the directive <b>to teach.</b> Similarly, <b><i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i></b> should precede <b><i>VaYomer</i>,</b> the final paragraph of <i>Shema</i>, because <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> includes the directive <b>to teach, while</b> the portion of ritual fringes includes the directive <b>to perform.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that</b> the portion of <b><i>Shema</i> contains</b> the directive <b>to learn</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to teach and perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall teach them</b> to your children” (Deuteronomy 6:7), a directive to teach, as well as: <b>“And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 6:8) and: <b>“And write them</b> on your door posts of your house” (Deuteronomy 6:9), directives to perform? <b>Furthermore, does <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> contain</b> the directive <b>to teach</b> but <b>it does not contain</b> the directive <b>to perform? Isn’t it written: “And you shall bind them</b> as a sign upon your arm” (Deuteronomy 11:18), a directive to perform?

### Part 14
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai <b>said as follows: By right,</b> the portion of <b><i>Shema</i> should precede <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> because</b> the portion of <i>Shema</i> includes the directives <b>to learn, to teach, and to perform,</b> while <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> includes the directives to teach and to perform. <b><i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> should precede <i>VaYomer</i> because</b> <i>VeHaya im Shamoa</i> includes the directives <b>to teach and to perform, while</b> <i>VaYomer</i> <b>only</b> includes the directive <b>to perform.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>Let him derive this,</b> that the portion of <i>Shema</i> is recited first, <b>from</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>He stated one</b> reason <b>and another.</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai does not disagree with Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa; he simply suggested as additional explanation as follows: <b>One</b> reason the portion of <i>Shema</i> is recited first is <b>so that one will first accept the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven upon himself and afterward the yoke of the mitzvot; and</b> the second reason is <b>because</b> the portion of <i>Shema</i> <b>contains these other elements</b> as well.

### Part 16
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav washed his hands, recited <i>Shema</i>, donned phylacteries, and prayed</b> in that order. The Gemara asks: <b>How could he do that? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who digs a grave for the dead</b> in the wall of the family burial cave <b>is exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, from prayer, from phylacteries, and from all mitzvot mentioned in the Torah.</b> When <b>the</b> appointed <b>time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> arrives, he emerges</b> from the cave, <b>washes his hands, dons phylacteries, recites <i>Shema</i>, and prays.</b>

### Part 17
Before clarifying the problem, the Gemara comments: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself is difficult;</b> it appears to be contradictory. <b>The first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>stated</b> that one digging a grave <b>is exempt</b> from the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, <b>and the latter clause</b> stated that <b>he is obligated</b> to emerge and recite <i>Shema</i>

### Part 18
The Gemara responds: <b>That is not difficult. The latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> refers to a case <b>of two</b> individuals digging the grave together; one pauses to recite <i>Shema</i> while the other continues digging. <b>The first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> refers to a case <b>of one</b> individual digging alone, who may not stop.

### Part 19
<b>In any case, this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>contradicts Rav</b> in terms of the order in which the mitzvot are performed. The Gemara responds: <b>Rav holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa, who said</b> that the acceptance of <b>the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven</b> takes precedence and should <b>come first, followed by</b> the acceptance of <b>the yoke of the mitzvot.</b> Therefore, Rav first recited <i>Shema</i>, and only then donned phylacteries.

### Part 20
The Gemara challenges: <b>Say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said</b> to <b>give precedence to recitation</b> of the portion concerning the acceptance of the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven over <b>recitation</b> of other portions. But <b>did you hear him</b> say the <i>halakha</i> gives precedence to <b>recitation over performance?</b>

### Part 21
<b>And furthermore, does</b> Rav <b>really hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa? But didn’t Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi say: Many times I stood before Rav, and he first washed his hands, recited a blessing, taught us our lesson, donned phylacteries, and then recited <i>Shema</i>. And if you say:</b> This was when <b>the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> had not</b> yet <b>arrived</b> and that is why he donned his phylacteries first, <b>then what is</b> the point of <b>the testimony of Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi?</b>

### Part 22
The Gemara responds: Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi’s story comes <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>the one who said that one need not recite the blessing</b> on Torah study <b>for</b> the study of <b>mishna. It teaches us that even for mishna, one must recite a blessing.</b>

### Part 23
<b>In any case</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>is difficult for Rav.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>The messenger was at fault</b> and brought Rav his phylacteries late, so Rav recited <i>Shema</i> at its appropriate time and later donned phylacteries.

### Part 24
With regard to the recitation of <i>Shema</i> without phylacteries, <b>Ulla said: Anyone who recites <i>Shema</i> without phylacteries, it is as if he has borne false testimony against himself,</b> as in <i>Shema</i>, he mentions his obligation to don phylacteries and in this case fails to don them himself (<i>Talmidei Rabbeinu Yona</i>). <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> One who recites <i>Shema</i> without phylacteries, <b>it is as if he has offered a burnt-offering without a meal-offering or a peace-offering without libations.</b> Despite the fact that he fulfilled his obligation, his offering is incomplete.

### Part 25
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who seeks to accept upon himself the complete yoke of the kingdom of Heaven</b>
