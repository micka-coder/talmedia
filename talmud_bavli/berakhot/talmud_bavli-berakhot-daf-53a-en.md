### Part 1
<b>If we say</b> that did not rest means that <b>it did not rest from labor, even from labor that is permitted? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>over light</b> that was kindled on Shabbat <b>for a woman giving birth or a</b> dangerously <b>ill person,</b> for whom one is permitted to perform prohibited labor on Shabbat, <b>one may recite a blessing</b> during <i>havdala</i> at the conclusion of Shabbat?

### Part 2
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: What is</b> meant by <b>rested?</b> Light <b>that rested from labor of transgression</b> on Shabbat. However, if the light burned for the entire Shabbat or was kindled on Shabbat in a permissible manner, one may recite a blessing over it. <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A lantern that was continuously burning throughout the entire day</b> of Shabbat, <b>one may recite a blessing over it at the conclusion of Shabbat.</b>

### Part 3
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A gentile who lit</b> a candle <b>from</b> a candle that was in the possession of <b>a Jew or if a Jew lit</b> a candle <b>from a gentile, one may recite a blessing over it</b> at the conclusion of Shabbat. However, <b>if a gentile</b> lit a candle <b>from a gentile, one may not recite a blessing over it.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about a candle that <b>a gentile</b> lit <b>from a gentile, that</b> one may <b>not</b> recite a blessing over it? <b>Because</b> the light <b>did not rest</b> on Shabbat. <b>If so,</b> the light of <b>a Jew</b> who lit a candle <b>from a gentile also did not rest</b> on Shabbat.

### Part 5
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>this prohibited</b> flame <b>has gone and this</b> flame <b>is a</b> new and <b>different</b> one which <b>came into being in the possession of a Jew,</b> as a flame is not a concrete, static object, but rather it constantly recreates itself; <b>however, this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i> in tractate <i>Shabbat</i> states: <b>One who carries out a flame</b> from the private <b>to the public domain</b> on Shabbat <b>is liable</b> for carrying out from one domain to another. If the flame is constantly recreating itself, <b>why is he liable? That</b> flame <b>which he lifted</b> from the private domain <b>he did not place</b> in the public domain <b>and that which he placed he did not lift.</b> One is only liable for carrying out on Shabbat if he lifted an object from one domain and placed that same object in another domain. Since one who carries out a flame on Shabbat is considered liable, evidently, despite any change that it may undergo, the flame is essentially considered a single entity.

### Part 6
<b>Rather, actually that prohibited</b> flame <b>is also extant, and when one recites the blessing, he recites the blessing over the permitted addition</b> to that flame. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> even if <b>a gentile</b> lit a candle <b>from a gentile as well,</b> the flame should be considered essentially new; one should be able to recite a blessing over the addition.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so.</b> Fundamentally, there is no reason to prohibit doing so. However, the Sages issued <b>a decree because of the first gentile,</b> who did not light the flame from another gentile, <b>and the first pillar</b> of flame that was kindled on Shabbat. Consequently, they prohibited all somewhat similar cases, including when a gentile lights a flame from another gentile.

### Part 8
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If one was walking outside the city, saw fire</b> there, and wanted to recite the blessing over it as part of <i>havdala</i>, <b>if</b> the city has a <b>majority of gentiles he may not recite the blessing</b> over the fire, but <b>if</b> the city has a <b>majority of Jews, he may recite the blessing.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara notes: <b>The matter itself is difficult</b> in this <i>baraita</i>. <b>You said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that if the town has a <b>majority of gentiles he may not recite the blessing.</b> By inference, if the town population was <b>half</b> gentiles <b>and half</b> Jews, <b>one may recite a blessing. And then you teach</b> that <b>if</b> the town has a <b>majority of Jews, he may recite the blessing.</b> By inference, if the town population was <b>half</b> gentiles <b>and half</b> Jews, <b>one may not recite a blessing.</b> The inferences from two sections of the <i>baraita</i> are contradictory.

### Part 10
The Gemara responds: <b>By right,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should have taught that <b>even</b> if the town population was <b>half</b> gentiles <b>and half</b> Jews, <b>one may recite a blessing,</b> but <b>since in the first clause it taught: The majority of gentiles, in the latter clause it</b> used the same expression and <b>taught: The majority of Jews.</b>

### Part 11
And <b>the Sages taught: One who was walking outside the city</b> at the conclusion of Shabbat <b>and saw a child with a torch in his hand, he</b> must <b>check after his</b> background. <b>If</b> the child <b>is a Jew, he may recite a blessing</b> over this flame, <b>but if</b> the child <b>is a gentile, he may not recite a blessing</b> over it.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>Why was it taught</b> specifically with regard to <b>a child? Even if he were an adult,</b> one would <b>also</b> need to investigate whether he was a Jew or a gentile in order to determine whether or not he may recite a blessing over the torch.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Here we are dealing with</b> a case where, although it was the conclusion of Shabbat, it was still <b>soon after sunset.</b> Therefore, in the case of <b>an adult, it is self-evident that he is a gentile,</b> as a Jew would not be so quick to take fire in his hand immediately after Shabbat. In the case of <b>a child,</b> however, <b>say that</b> perhaps <b>he is a Jew</b> and <b>it happened that he took</b> the torch.

### Part 14
And <b>the Sages taught: One who was walking outside the city</b> at the conclusion of Shabbat <b>and saw a fire, if</b> the fire <b>is</b> at least <b>as thick as the opening of a furnace, one may recite a blessing over it,</b> as a fire of that kind is kindled for the light it produces as well. <b>And if</b> it is <b>not</b> at least that thick, <b>one may not recite a blessing over it.</b>

### Part 15
<b>It was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: During <i>havdala</i>, <b>one may recite a blessing over the fire of a furnace; and it was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not recite a blessing over</b> the fire of a furnace. There is an apparent contradiction between the <i>baraitot</i>.

### Part 16
The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> which prohibits reciting the blessing is speaking <b>at the beginning</b> when the furnace was just kindled and the fire is designated solely to heat the objects in the furnace; <b>that</b> <i>baraita,</i> which permits reciting the blessing, is speaking <b>at the end,</b> when the fire is no longer needed to heat the objects in the furnace, and its light is used for other purposes.

### Part 17
The Gemara cites a similar contradiction between <i>baraitot</i>: <b>It was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: During <i>havdala</i>, <b>one may recite a blessing over the fire of an oven or a stove; and it was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not recite a blessing over it.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as a similar distinction between the <i>baraitot</i> may be suggested. <b>This</b> <i>baraita,</i> which prohibits reciting the blessing, is speaking <b>at the beginning,</b> when the oven or stove was just kindled and the fire is designated solely to heat the objects on the stove or in the oven; <b>that</b> <i>baraita,</i> which permits reciting the blessing, is speaking <b>at the end,</b> when the fire is no longer needed to heat the objects on the stove or in the oven and its light is used for other purposes.

### Part 19
The Gemara cites another contradiction: <b>It was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: During <i>havdala</i>, <b>one may recite a blessing over the light of a synagogue or a study hall; and it was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not recite a blessing over it.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> <i>baraita,</i> which prohibits reciting the blessing, is speaking in a case <b>where there is an important person</b> in the synagogue and the fire is kindled in his honor and not to provide light; <b>that</b> <i>baraita,</i> which permits reciting the blessing, is speaking in a case <b>where there is no important person</b> present and the fire is kindled to provide light.

### Part 21
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> and <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> are speaking in a case <b>where there is an important person</b> present in the synagogue, <b>and</b> this is <b>not difficult</b> because the contradiction can be resolved as follows: <b>This</b> <i>baraita,</i> which permits reciting the blessing, is speaking in a case <b>where there is a caretaker</b> in the synagogue who uses the light; <b>that</b> <i>baraita,</i> which prohibits reciting the blessing, is speaking in a case <b>where there is no caretaker</b> and the light is kindled for purposes of honor.

### Part 22
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are both referring to a case <b>where there is a caretaker</b> present in the synagogue, <b>and</b> this is <b>not difficult</b> because the contradiction can be resolved as follows: <b>This</b> <i>baraita,</i> which prohibits reciting the blessing, is speaking in a case <b>where there is moonlight,</b> so the caretaker did not light the fire to provide light as the moonlight is sufficient; <b>that</b> <i>baraita,</i> which permits reciting the blessing, is speaking in a case <b>where there is no moonlight,</b> and the caretaker lights the fire to provide light.

### Part 23
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>People were seated in the study hall and they brought fire before them</b> at the conclusion of Shabbat. <b>Beit Shammai say: Each and every individual recites a blessing for himself; and Beit Hillel say: One recites a blessing on behalf of everyone</b> and the others answer amen. Beit Hillel’s reasoning is <b>as it is stated: “The splendor of the King is in the multitude of the people”</b> (Proverbs 14:28). When everyone joins together to hear the blessing, the name of God is glorified.

### Part 24
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, Beit Hillel,</b> they <b>explain</b> their <b>reasoning, but what is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai</b> to prohibit reciting the blessing communally? The Gemara answers: <b>They hold</b> that it is prohibited <b>due to</b> the fact that it will lead to <b>suspension of</b> study in <b>the study hall.</b> Waiting for someone to recite the blessing will interrupt Torah study for several minutes.

### Part 25
<b>This</b> concern for disrupting Torah study <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The members of <b>the house of Rabban Gamliel would not say good health</b> when someone sneezed <b>in the study hall, due to</b> the fact that it would lead to <b>suspension of</b> study in <b>the study hall.</b>

### Part 26
We learned in the mishna: <b>One may neither recite a blessing over the candle nor over the spices</b> designated to honor <b>the dead.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason?</b> Because <b>a candle</b> of the dead <b>is kindled for</b> the purpose of <b>honoring</b> the dead, not for light; <b>the spices</b> are <b>to neutralize the</b> bad <b>odor,</b> not for their pleasant fragrance.

### Part 27
And <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Any</b> deceased <b>before whom</b> a candle <b>is taken out</b> both <b>by day and by night,</b> it is evident that the candle is for the purpose of honoring the deceased; therefore, <b>one may not recite a blessing over it. And any</b> deceased <b>before whom</b> a candle <b>is taken out only by night,</b> it is evident that the purpose of the candle is for its light alone, and <b>one may recite a blessing over it.</b>

### Part 28
Similarly, <b>Rav Huna said: Over spices</b> used to deodorize <b>the bathroom and</b> fragrant <b>oil</b> intended <b>to remove filth, one may not recite a blessing</b> as they are not used for their pleasant fragrance.

### Part 29
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>any</b> case <b>where it is not used for its</b> pleasant <b>fragrance, one may not recite a blessing over it?</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who enters the store of a perfumer, and smelled a fragrance, even if he sat there throughout the entire day, he only recites a blessing once.</b> However, <b>if one entered and exited, entered and exited, he recites a blessing on each and every occasion. Isn’t</b> it a case <b>here, where</b> the spices <b>are not intended for fragrance,</b> as they are not used to improve the scent in the store, <b>and,</b> nevertheless, <b>one recites a blessing?</b>

### Part 30
The Gemara responds: <b>Yes,</b> in this case the spices <b>are also intended for fragrance;</b> they are used to generate a scent in the store <b>so that people will smell</b> them <b>and come and purchase from him.</b>

### Part 31
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who was walking outside a city and smelled a scent; if the majority</b> of the town’s residents <b>are gentiles he may not recite a blessing</b> over the scent, but <b>if the majority are Jews, he may recite a blessing. Rabbi Yosei says: Even if the majority are Jews, one may not recite a blessing, as the daughters of Israel burn incense to witchcraft</b> and the spices were certainly made for witchcraft, not for their fragrance.

### Part 32
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that they all burn incense to witchcraft?</b> Rather, <b>there is a minority</b> of people who burn incense <b>to witchcraft, and a</b> different <b>minority</b> who burn spices in order <b>to perfume</b> their <b>garments with incense. A majority,</b> therefore, exists that <b>does not use it for fragrance, and in a case where the majority does not use it for fragrance, one does not recite a blessing.</b>

### Part 33
Similarly, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who walks on Shabbat eve in Tiberias</b> or <b>at the conclusion of Shabbat in Tzippori, and smelled the scent</b> of incense <b>may not recite a blessing, as the presumption is</b> that <b>it was intended to perfume garments.</b>

### Part 34
On a related note, the Gemara cites the following: <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who was walking in the marketplace of idolators and willingly smelled</b> the incense wafting there, <b>he is a sinner,</b> as he should not have the intention to smell it.
