### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Everyone takes</b> vows of <b>valuation</b> and is thereby obligated to donate to the Temple treasury the value fixed by the Torah (see Leviticus 27:3–7) for the age and sex of the person valuated. <b>And</b> similarly, everyone <b>is valuated,</b> and therefore one who vowed to donate his fixed value is obligated to pay. Likewise, everyone <b>vows</b> to donate to the Temple treasury the assessment of a person, based on his market value to be sold as a slave, and is thereby obligated to pay; <b>and</b> everyone is the object of <b>a vow</b> if others vowed to donate his assessment. This includes <b>priests, Levites and Israelites, women, and</b> Canaanite <b>slaves.</b>

### Part 2
<b>A <i>tumtum</i>,</b> whose sexual organs are concealed, <b>and a hermaphrodite [<i>androginos</i>], vow, and</b> are the object of <b>a vow, and take</b> vows of <b>valuation, but they are not valuated.</b> Consequently, if one says, with regard to a <i>tumtum</i>: The valuation of so-and-so is incumbent upon me to donate to the Temple treasury, he is not obligated to pay anything, <b>as only a definite male or a definite female are valuated.</b>

### Part 3
<b>A deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor</b> are the object of <b>a vow and are valuated, but neither vow</b> to donate the assessment of a person <b>nor take</b> a vow of <b>valuation, because they lack the</b> presumed <b>mental competence</b> to make a commitment.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the mishna’s statement: <b>Everyone [<i>hakol</i>] takes</b> vows of <b>valuation?</b> When a principle is stated in a mishna, it serves to include a particular case that it does not mention explicitly in its <i>halakha</i>. Which case is included by the broad statement here? The Gemara answers: The mishna teaches it <b>to add a discriminating</b> minor <b>on</b> the <b>brink of adulthood [<i>mufla samukh le’ish</i>],</b> i.e., during the year before a minor reaches majority.

### Part 5
The Gemara similarly asks: <b>What is added</b> by the statement: And everyone <b>is valuated?</b> The Gemara answers: The mishna serves <b>to add a repulsive</b> man <b>and one afflicted with boils,</b> who have no market value.

### Part 6
The Gemara explains why this addition is necessary: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that as <b>it is written</b> in the verse: <b>“A vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), which juxtaposes one who is valuated to one who is the object of a vow, <b>anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments,</b> i.e., if he vows to pay his assessment he must pay it to the Temple, <b>is</b> also included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations. But anyone who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations.</b> Since these people, a repulsive man and one afflicted with boils, are not subject to assessment, as they have no market value, perhaps they are also not subject to valuation.

### Part 7
Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that these too are subject to valuation, as the same verse also states: <b>“Persons [<i>nefashot</i>],”</b> indicating anyone who has <b>any amount</b> of life [<i>nefesh</i>] is subject to valuation.

### Part 8
The Gemara further asks: <b>What is added</b> by the mishna’s statement: Everyone <b>vows</b> to donate the assessment of a person? The Gemara answers: Actually, this statement is not necessary, but it is mentioned because the continuation: And everyone is the object of <b>a vow, was necessary.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara inquires: <b>What,</b> then, <b>is added</b> by the clause: And everyone is the object of <b>a vow? If</b> one were to suggest that this serves <b>to add a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite,</b> that cannot be correct, as they <b>are explicitly taught</b> in the mishna itself. <b>And if</b> one were to suggest that it serves <b>to add a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor,</b> they too <b>are explicitly taught</b> in the mishna.

### Part 10
And <b>if</b> you say that this clause serves <b>to add</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a child who is <b>less than a month old,</b> who is not subject to valuation, is nevertheless subject to assessment, this too <b>is explicitly taught</b> in a mishna (5a). And <b>if</b> one were to say that it serves <b>to add a gentile,</b> that <b>is</b> also <b>explicitly taught</b> in a mishna (5b). The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the phrase: And everyone is the object of a vow, is mentioned in the mishna in order <b>to add</b> a child who is <b>less than a month old, and</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i> in general terms <b>and then explains</b> it in detail later.

### Part 11
§ The Gemara inquires about similar general expressions that appear in other <i>mishnayot</i>. <b>What is added</b> by the mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 93a): <b>Everyone</b> who brings an offering <b>places hands</b> on the head of the animal? The Gemara answers: This clause serves <b>to add</b> that <b>an heir</b> places hands on the offering of the deceased, <b>and</b> the mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that an heir does not place his hands on an offering he inherited.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the mishna (<i>Temura</i> 2a): <b>Everyone substitutes</b> a non-sacred animal for a consecrated animal? The Gemara answers: Here too, the mishna serves <b>to add</b> that <b>an heir</b> substitutes a non-sacred animal for his father’s consecrated animal, i.e., the non-sacred animal also becomes sanctified. <b>And</b> this mishna is also <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as he maintains that an heir cannot substitute a non-sacred animal for the consecrated animal he inherited.

### Part 13
The Gemara cites the source for these two opinions of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An heir places hands</b> on his father’s offering, and <b>an heir can effect substitution</b> for an offering inherited from his father. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: An heir does not place hands</b> and <b>an heir cannot effect substitution.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> With regard to placing of hands, he expounds the term: <b>“His offering”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), as teaching that one places his hands only on his own offering, <b>but not</b> on <b>his father’s offering. And</b> with regard to the ruling that an heir cannot effect substitution, Rabbi Yehuda <b>derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the initial stage of consecration,</b> i.e., substitution, in which a previously non-sacred animal is consecrated, <b>from the final stage of consecration,</b> the act of placing hands, which is performed upon an already-consecrated animal immediately before it is slaughtered: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>the final stage of consecration, an heir does not place hands, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the initial stage of consecration, an heir cannot effect substitution.</b>

### Part 15
<b>And</b> from where do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive their opinion? The verse states: “If <b>he shall substitute [<i>hamer yamir</i>]</b> animal for animal” (Leviticus 27:10), with the doubled form of <i>hamer yamir</i> serving <b>to include the heir</b> as one capable of effecting substitution. <b>And</b> the Rabbis <b>derive the final stage of consecration,</b> i.e., the placing of hands, <b>from the initial stage of consecration,</b> i.e., substitution: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>the initial stage of consecration an heir can effect substitution, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the final stage of consecration, an heir can place hands.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, what do they do with this</b> term: <b>“His offering,”</b> from which Rabbi Yehuda derives that an heir does not place his hands? The Gemara explains how the Rabbis expound each mention of the term, which appears three times (Leviticus 3:2, 7, 12). One instance of <b>“his offering”</b> teaches that one places hands only on one’s own offering, <b>but not</b> on the <b>offering of a gentile.</b> Another instance of <b>“his offering”</b> teaches that one places hands only on one’s own offering, <b>but not</b> on the <b>offering of another</b> person. The third instance of <b>“his offering”</b> serves <b>to include all</b> the <b>owners of</b> a jointly owned <b>offering in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands,</b> i.e., they are all required to place their hands on the offering.

### Part 17
The Gemara clarifies: <b>And</b> how does Rabbi Yehuda respond to this claim? The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Yehuda does not hold</b> that one of the mentions serves <b>to include all owners</b> of a jointly owned <b>offering in</b> the requirement of <b>placing hands.</b> Rather, one of the owners places his hands on the offering on behalf of the entire group. Consequently, he is left with one spare mention of “his offering,” from which he derives that an heir does not place his hands. The Gemara adds: <b>Alternatively,</b> one can say that Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> that one of the mentions serves to include owners of a jointly owned offering,
