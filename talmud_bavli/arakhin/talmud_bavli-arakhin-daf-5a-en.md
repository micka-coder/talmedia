### Part 1
<b>The leg of this</b> animal <b>is a burnt offering,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>all of</b> the animal <b>will be a burnt offering.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if it is an animal of those that they bring as an offering to the Lord, <b>anything of it that one gives to the Lord, it shall be sacred”</b> (Leviticus 27:9). The verse indicates that the part <b>of it</b> that one gives will be <b>sacred, but not all of</b> the animal will be <b>sacred.</b>

### Part 2
A non-sacred animal with a consecrated limb may not be sacrificed. Accordingly, one <b>might</b> have thought that the consecrated limb may be redeemed and thereby <b>transferred to non-sacred</b> status. Therefore <b>the verse states: “Shall be,”</b> meaning: <b>It shall be as it is,</b> i.e., the limb remains consecrated. <b>How</b> is <b>this</b> possible, i.e., what should one do in this case? The animal <b>should be sold for the needs of burnt offerings,</b> i.e., to an individual who will sacrifice the entire animal as a burnt offering, <b>and the payment</b> received <b>for</b> the animal will be <b>non-sacred, except for the payment</b> received in exchange <b>for that limb of it</b> that was consecrated. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one who says: The leg of this</b> animal <b>is a burnt offering, all of</b> the animal <b>becomes a burnt offering? The verse states: “All that any man give of such to the Lord shall be holy”</b> (Leviticus 27:9). The term “shall be” serves <b>to include all of</b> the animal, indicating that it all becomes sacred.

### Part 4
<b>And even according to the one,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>who says</b> that if one states: The leg of this animal is a burnt offering, <b>not all of</b> the animal <b>is a burnt offering, that statement</b> applies only <b>if</b> one <b>consecrated an item that its life does not depend</b> on, e.g., its leg. <b>But</b> if he consecrated <b>an item that its life depends</b> on, such as its head, <b>the entire</b> animal is <b>consecrated.</b> This presents a difficulty for Rava, who holds that the <i>baraita</i> that discusses consecration of the head is referring to items consecrated in order to purchase offerings for the altar. Why, then, isn’t the entire animal consecrated?

### Part 5
Rava responds: <b>Rather,</b> both <i>baraitot</i> are referring to items consecrated for the altar, and even so it is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which indicates that if one consecrated the head the entire animal is consecrated, is referring <b>to inherent sanctity,</b> i.e., where he consecrated the head for the purpose of sacrificing it on the altar. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that if he consecrated the head it alone is consecrated, is referring <b>to sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>value,</b> that is, where he consecrated the head for the sake of purchasing offerings.

### Part 6
Abaye responded: <b>But wasn’t it</b> you, <b>Master, who said</b> that if one <b>consecrated a male</b> animal <b>for its value,</b> it is <b>sanctified</b> with <b>inherent sanctity</b> and it is itself sacrificed? This undermines the distinction that Rava is attempting to draw between inherent sanctity and sanctity that inheres in value.

### Part 7
Rava responds: It is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement, that an animal that was consecrated for its value attains inherent sanctity, applies only in a case <b>where he consecrated the entire</b> animal. <b>There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> discussing the consecration of the head, it is referring to a situation <b>where he consecrated</b> only <b>one limb.</b> In such a case, the animal does not attain inherent sanctity.

### Part 8
Abaye replied: Actually, <b>we also raised a dilemma</b> with regard to a case where one consecrated only <b>one limb. As Rabba raised a dilemma:</b> If one <b>consecrated a limb for its value</b> in order to bring an offering with the proceeds, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as to whether or not the entire animal is consecrated? If your interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> is correct, Rabba can resolve his question based on the <i>baraita</i> and conclude definitively that the entire animal is not sanctified for the altar.

### Part 9
Rava responded: <b>We raised</b> this <b>dilemma</b> and entertained the possibility that the entire animal might be sanctified to the altar only <b>in</b> a case where the animal is <b>unblemished,</b> and is therefore fit to be used as an offering. But <b>here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a blemished</b> animal, <b>similar to</b> the parallel case of the <b>donkey,</b> which is unfit to be sacrificed. Since the animal in question is unfit for the altar, it is clear that the entire animal is not sanctified.

### Part 10
Abaye responded: In fact, <b>we also raised a dilemma</b> with regard to a case where the animal is <b>blemished</b> and unfit to be sacrificed. <b>As Rabba raised a dilemma:</b> If one said: It is incumbent upon me to donate the <b>value of my head</b> to purchase offerings <b>to</b> be sacrificed <b>on the altar, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he obligated in his entire value or not? A person is certainly not fit to be an offering, and yet Rabba does not resolve his question based on the <i>baraita</i>. Rava answered: <b>We</b> only <b>raised</b> this <b>dilemma before hearing this <i>baraita</i>. Now that we</b> have <b>heard this <i>baraita</i>, we no</b> longer <b>raise</b> this <b>dilemma,</b> as we concluded from the <i>baraita</i> that the entirety of the animal is not consecrated.

### Part 11
§ The Gemara returns to <b>the</b> aforementioned matter itself. <b>Rabba raised a dilemma:</b> If one said: It is incumbent upon me to donate the <b>value of my head</b> to purchase offerings <b>to</b> be sacrificed <b>on the altar, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it <b>assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part in question, and since he consecrated a vital organ he is obligated in his entire value? <b>Or</b> perhaps it is <b>not assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part in question, and only the head is consecrated.

### Part 12
The Gemara explains the underlying issue: It can be argued that <b>we have not found</b> a case <b>of assessments that</b> is <b>not assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that was specified. Therefore, if one obligated himself in the value of a vital organ he should have to pay the entity’s entire value. <b>Or perhaps</b> he should be obligated only in the value of the head, as <b>we have not found</b> a case <b>of</b> an animal that is sacrificed <b>on the altar that</b> is <b>assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part in question, i.e., that if one consecrates the value of one vital organ the entire animal is consecrated. The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand [<i>teiku</i>]</b> unresolved.

### Part 13
<b>Rava raised</b> a further <b>dilemma:</b> If one said: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>my valuation for the altar,</b> rather than for Temple maintenance, as is usually the case, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this case <b>determined based on affordability</b> if he is poor, like regular valuations? <b>Or</b> perhaps it is <b>not determined based on affordability,</b> and he is obligated in the full valuation even if he is poor.

### Part 14
The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: One can argue that <b>we have not found</b> a case <b>of valuations that is not determined based on affordability.</b> Therefore, the principle of affordability should apply even when one vows for the purpose of sacrificing offerings on the altar. <b>Or perhaps</b> this case should not be determined based on affordability, as <b>we have not found</b> an item that is consecrated for the purpose of sacrificing offerings <b>on the altar that</b> is <b>redeemed</b> in a manner <b>other than according to its value.</b> The Gemara again concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Ashi raised</b> a similar <b>dilemma:</b> If a person <b>consecrated an ancestral field for</b> the purpose of sacrificing offerings <b>on the altar,</b> rather than for Temple maintenance, as is usually the case, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>we have not found</b> a case of <b>an ancestral field that is redeemed other than</b> by the standard rate established by the Torah, which is that <b>an area</b> fit <b>for the sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i>,</b> a <i>kor</i>, of <b>barley seed</b> is redeemed <b>for fifty silver shekels? Or perhaps</b> it should be redeemed according to its market value, as <b>we have not found</b> a case of an item that is consecrated for the purpose of sacrificing offerings <b>on the altar that</b> is <b>redeemed</b> in a manner <b>other than according to its value.</b> Once again, the Gemara states: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 16
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A child <b>less than one month old is</b> the object of <b>a vow</b> if others vowed to donate his assessment, <b>but is not valuated</b> if one vowed to donate his fixed value, as the Torah did not establish a value for anyone less than a month old.

### Part 17
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a case of <b>one who takes</b> a vow of <b>valuation</b> concerning a child <b>less than one month old, Rabbi Meir says:</b> The person who valuated is obligated to <b>give</b> the child’s <b>assessment. The Rabbis say: He has said nothing,</b> i.e., he is not obligated to give anything.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do they <b>disagree? Rabbi Meir holds: A person does not issue his statement</b> of consecration <b>for naught.</b> The assumption is that a person <b>knows that there are no valuations for</b> a child <b>less than one month old, and</b> therefore <b>he intended and said</b> his statement <b>for the sake of assessments,</b> i.e., he meant to vow to give the child’s market value. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>a person does make his statement</b> of consecration <b>for naught.</b> Therefore, his statement is taken at face value, and he is not obligated to give anything.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: One who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate the <b>valuation of</b> this <b>utensil,</b> is obligated to <b>give its assessment?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who holds that a person does not issue a statement of consecration for naught. Since utensils are not subject to valuation, he presumably intended to obligate himself in its assessment. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious that</b> Rav’s statement <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir?</b> Why was it necessary for the Gemara to state this?

### Part 20
The Gemara explains that it was necessary to state that Rav’s statement is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, <b>lest you say</b> that it is <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who exempt one who valuates a child under a month old. The Gemara elaborates: One could say that <b>it is</b> only <b>there,</b> in the case of the child, <b>that one errs</b> and <b>thinks</b> that <b>just as there are valuations for</b> a child who is <b>one month old,</b> there are <b>also</b> valuations <b>for</b> a child <b>less than one month old.</b> Since his vow was based on an error, he is not obligated to pay anything.

### Part 21
<b>But here,</b> in the case of one who valuates a utensil, <b>where there is no</b> possibility <b>of erring,</b> it can be argued that <b>a person certainly knows that there is no valuation for a utensil, and he</b> therefore <b>intended and said</b> his statement <b>for the sake of assessments,</b> i.e., he meant to vow to donate the utensil’s value. Therefore, the Gemara <b>teaches us</b> that Rav’s statement is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir only, and not with that of the Rabbis. The Rabbis hold that a person does issue a statement of consecration for naught even in such a case, and therefore his declaration is taken at face value.
