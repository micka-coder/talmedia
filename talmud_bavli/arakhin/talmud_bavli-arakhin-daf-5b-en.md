### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as Rav stated his <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with Rabbi Meir,</b> who says that one who valuates a child less than a month old must pay his assessment, <b>for what</b> reason <b>was it necessary</b> for Rav to state his ruling? Isn’t this obvious?

### Part 2
The Gemara answers: It was necessary for him to state this <i>halakha</i>, <b>lest you say</b> that the <b>reason that Rabbi Meir</b> obligates him to pay the assessment <b>there,</b> in the case of the child, is <b>that</b> he <b>decrees</b> one must pay if the child is <b>less than a month old, due to</b> concern that otherwise people might mistakenly refrain from paying the valuation of a child who is <b>a month old. But here,</b> in the case of one who valuates a utensil, <b>where</b> there is no cause for such an error and therefore <b>no</b> need <b>to decree,</b> one might <b>say</b> that Rabbi Meir would <b>not</b> obligate him to pay. Therefore, Rav <b>teaches us</b> that since the <b>reason of Rabbi Meir</b> is that <b>a person does not make his statement</b> of consecration <b>for naught,</b> there <b>is no difference</b> between <b>here,</b> the case of a child, <b>and there,</b> with regard to a utensil. Rather, the <i>halakha</i> is the same in both cases.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rabba bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Yeiva bar Yosei says</b> that <b>Rav says: One who consecrates the animal of another</b> must <b>give its assessment. In accordance with whom?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> that one does not issue a statement of consecration for naught. Since he knows that he cannot consecrate that which is not his, he meant to obligate himself in the animal’s assessment.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rav</b> already <b>say</b> it <b>once? As Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says: One who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate the <b>valuation of a utensil,</b> must <b>give its assessment.</b> The Gemara answers: Rav found it necessary to issue both statements, <b>lest you say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies only <b>there,</b> with regard to a utensil, <b>as</b> a person <b>knows that a utensil has no valuation,</b> i.e., that the term: Valuation, is not relevant to a utensil, <b>and</b> therefore it must be that he <b>decided</b> to donate money <b>and says</b> this expression as a reference <b>to</b> its monetary <b>value,</b> using the term: Valuation, imprecisely.

### Part 5
<b>But</b> in the case where one obligated himself in the valuation of another’s <b>animal, which is subject to consecration,</b> albeit not by him, <b>there is</b> room <b>to say that this</b> is what he <b>is saying</b> to himself: <b>Were I to say to the owner</b> that I want to buy it, <b>he would sell it to me.</b> Therefore, <b>let it be consecrated from now, and I will sacrifice it</b> once I purchase it from him. His intent is to consecrate the animal itself in order to sacrifice it. <b>But</b> since he did <b>not say</b> to himself that he would give its <b>assessment,</b> his statement is meaningless, as one cannot consecrate property that does not belong to him. Therefore, Rav <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case. Rather, his statement should be interpreted in such a manner that he is obligated to give the assessment of the animal to the Temple treasury.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ashi says: And</b> Rav’s ruling applies only in a case <b>where</b> one <b>says: It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate to the Temple treasury. <b>But</b> if he <b>says: This</b> animal <b>is</b> consecrated, he is <b>not</b> obligated to pay its assessment. This formulation clearly indicates that he intended to consecrate this animal, which he cannot do, as it does not yet belong to him.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a gentile, Rabbi Meir says:</b> He <b>is valuated</b> in a case where a Jew says: It is incumbent upon me to donate the fixed value of this gentile. <b>But</b> a gentile <b>does not take</b> a vow of <b>valuation</b> to donate his fixed value or the value of others. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He takes</b> a vow of <b>valuation, but is not valuated. And</b> both <b>this</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Meir, <b>and that</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yehuda, <b>agree that</b> gentiles <b>vow</b> to donate the assessment of another <b>and are</b> the object of <b>vows,</b> whereby one donates the assessment of a gentile.

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> the following in a <i>baraita</i> that deals with the reasoning for the rulings of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda. It is written in the beginning of the passage in the Torah delineating valuations: “Speak to the children of Israel” (Leviticus 27:2). This teaches that <b>“the children of Israel” can take</b> a vow of <b>valuation, but gentiles cannot take</b> a vow of <b>valuation.</b>

### Part 9
One <b>might</b> have thought that this means that gentiles <b>cannot be</b> the object <b>of a valuation</b> either. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the inclusive expression: “When <b>a man</b> shall clearly utter a vow of persons to the Lord, according to your valuation” (Leviticus 27:2), to teach that in this regard, every “man,” even a gentile, is included in <i>halakhot</i> of valuations. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Meir says</b> in explanation of his opinion: <b>Since one verse,</b> “a man,” <b>includes</b> gentiles, <b>and another verse,</b> “the children of Israel,” <b>excludes</b> gentiles, <b>for what</b> reason <b>do I say</b> that a gentile <b>can be</b> the object <b>of a valuation but cannot take</b> a vow of <b>valuation,</b> rather than the reverse?

### Part 11
It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the verse included more</b> people <b>in</b> the category of those <b>who are</b> the object <b>of a valuation than in</b> the category of those <b>who take</b> a vow of <b>valuation. As</b> the mishna teaches (2a): <b>A deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor</b> are the object of a vow and <b>are valuated, but</b> they can neither vow to donate the assessment of a person <b>nor take</b> a vow of <b>valuation.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the verses should be interpreted in the reverse manner: <b>“The children of Israel,” can be</b> the object <b>of a valuation but gentiles cannot be</b> the object <b>of a valuation.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that gentiles <b>cannot take</b> a vow of <b>valuation</b> either. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the inclusive expression: <b>“A man”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), to teach that in this regard, every “man,” even a gentile, is included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuations.

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Since one verse,</b> “a man,” <b>includes</b> gentiles, <b>and another verse,</b> “the children of Israel,” <b>excludes</b> gentiles, <b>for what</b> reason <b>do I say</b> that <b>a gentile can take</b> a vow of <b>a valuation but cannot be</b> the object <b>of a valuation?</b> It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the verse included more</b> people <b>in</b> the category of those <b>who take</b> a vow of <b>valuation than in</b> the category of those <b>who are</b> the object <b>of a valuation. As</b> the mishna teaches (2a): <b>A <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite</b> vow, are the object of a vow, and <b>take</b> vows of <b>valuation, but they are not valuated.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rava says: Rabbi Meir’s <i>halakha</i> is reasonable,</b> but <b>his explanation is not reasonable.</b> Conversely, <b>Rabbi Yehuda’s explanation is reasonable,</b> but <b>his <i>halakha</i> is not reasonable.</b>

### Part 15
Rava elaborates: <b>Rabbi Meir’s <i>halakha</i></b> that gentiles cannot take a valuation vow <b>is reasonable, as it is written</b> that the Jews who returned to Eretz Yisrael from Babylonia rejected the Samaritans’ request to assist them in the construction of the Second Temple, saying: <b>“You have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God”</b> (Ezra 4:3). This supports Rabbi Meir’s contention that gentiles may not take vows of valuation, which are used for Temple maintenance. But <b>his explanation is not reasonable, as he adduces</b> proof <b>for</b> his <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the fact that <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor</b> cannot take a vow of valuation. This proof is unconvincing, since <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor are different, as</b> unlike gentiles, they <b>lack the</b> presumed <b>mental competence</b> to make a commitment.

### Part 16
By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yehuda’s explanation is reasonable,</b> in <b>that he adduces</b> proof <b>for</b> his <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the case of <b>a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite, as even though they possess the</b> presumed <b>mental competence</b> to make a commitment, nevertheless <b>the Merciful One excludes them</b> from being valuated. Since they are comparable to gentiles, they can serve as a precedent. But <b>his <i>halakha</i></b> that gentiles can take a valuation vow <b>is not reasonable, as it is written: “You have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God,”</b> which indicates that they may not contribute anything to Temple maintenance.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that gentiles can take valuation vows and that the funds go to Temple maintenance, <b>what does he do with this</b> verse: <b>“You have nothing to do with us”? Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Avimi said:</b> He derives from it that if a gentile takes a vow of valuation <b>and</b> he brings the money to the Temple, <b>his valuation</b> money <b>is</b> not utilized but rather is <b>interred.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the valuation is not utilized for the Temple, <b>one</b> who uses it <b>should not</b> be considered to have violated the prohibition of <b>misuse.</b> One who unwittingly derived benefit from the valuation should not be obligated to bring a guilt offering for misuse of consecrated property, as the Temple treasury does not derive benefit from it. <b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the five sin offerings</b> that may not be sacrificed and are left to <b>die, and</b> similarly, with regard to consecrated <b>money that is taken</b> and cast <b>into the Dead Sea,</b> as it is not fit for any purpose, one <b>may not derive benefit</b> from them <i>ab initio</i>. <b>But</b> after the fact, if one derived benefit from them he is <b>not liable</b> for <b>misuse,</b> as the Temple treasury has no use for them.

### Part 19
<b>Why</b> then <b>is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> the <b>consecrations of gentiles: In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that consecrations of gentiles are not subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse, <b>said?</b> It is specifically <b>with regard to consecrations for the altar. But with regard to consecrations for Temple maintenance,</b> one who derives benefit <b>from</b> them is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. Why is this the <i>halakha</i>, given the fact that the consecrations of a gentile are interred?

### Part 20
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that actually Rabbi Yehuda maintains that the valuation of a gentile is given to Temple maintenance and is not interred. And as for that which the Jews said to the gentiles in the time of the Second Temple: “You have nothing to do with us,” that refusal was not for halakhic reasons. Rather, <b>it</b> was <b>due to</b> the gentiles’ attempt to foster <b>weakening of the hands</b> of those rebuilding the Temple. <b>As it is written: “Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and harried them while they were building”</b> (Ezra 4:4).
