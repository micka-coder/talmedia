<b>in</b> his <b>second</b> year <b>he ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>and conquered Jehoiakim.</b>

### Part 2
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the <i>baraita</i>, which teaches: When the Temple was destroyed for the first time, that day was the Ninth of Av; and it was the conclusion of Shabbat; and it was the year after a Sabbatical Year; <b>and likewise,</b> the same happened <b>when the Second</b> Temple was destroyed.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>Can you find</b> such a possibility, that the <b>Second</b> Temple was destroyed <b>in the year after a Sabbatical Year? Now,</b> for <b>how many</b> years did <b>the Second Temple stand?</b> It stood for <b>420</b> years. <b>Four hundred</b> years include exactly <b>eight Jubilees,</b> as the Jubilee cycle is fifty years. An additional <b>fourteen</b> years consist of <b>two Sabbatical cycles.</b> There are <b>six</b> years <b>remaining</b> during which the Temple stood, which means that the last year <b>was the sixth</b> year <b>of the Sabbatical cycle,</b> and therefore when the Temple was destroyed the following year it was a Sabbatical Year, not the year after the Sabbatical Year.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i> stated? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>the fiftieth year is counted for here and for there,</b> i.e., it is both the Jubilee Year and the first year of the next Sabbatical cycle and Jubilee cycle, and therefore each Jubilee cycle is only forty-nine years rather than fifty years. Consequently, when calculating the number of years of the Sabbatical and Jubilee cycles until the destruction of the Second Temple, <b>bring</b> an additional <b>eight</b> years <b>from the eight</b> complete Jubilee cycles during which the Temple stood. The eight years <b>and those six</b> years that remained according to the previous calculation <b>equal fourteen</b> years, which are two complete Sabbatical cycles. Therefore, <b>it is found that</b> the Second Temple <b>was destroyed in the year following the Sabbatical</b> Year.

### Part 5
The Gemara objects: But <b>if</b> one explains the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> is problematic, as <b>you do not find</b> that <b>the first</b> time the Temple was destroyed was in the year after the Sabbatical Year. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Jewish people counted seventeen Jubilees from when they entered Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>until they left,</b> when the First Temple was destroyed. <b>And you cannot say</b> that <b>they counted from the time they entered, because if you say this, the result is</b> that <b>the Temple was destroyed at the beginning of the Jubilee</b> cycle, <b>and you do not find</b> that the Jubilee Year was <b>“in the fourteenth year after the city was smitten”</b> (Ezekiel 40:1).

### Part 6
<b>Rather, remove from them</b> the <b>seven</b> years <b>when they conquered</b> the land <b>and</b> the <b>seven</b> years <b>when they divided</b> the land, as they did not start counting the first Jubilee cycle until after those events. <b>And you</b> then <b>find</b> that the Jubilee Year was <b>“in the fourteenth year after the city was smitten.”</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara explains the difficulty from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>But if</b> one holds in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> that each Jubilee cycle is forty-nine years rather than fifty years, you must <b>bring</b> an additional <b>seventeen</b> years, one <b>from</b> each of <b>the seventeen Jubilee</b> cycles and <b>add</b> them <b>to these</b> seventeen cycles, and it turns out that the destruction of the Temple <b>was in the third</b> year <b>of the Sabbatical</b> cycle.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: Throughout <b>those years from</b> when <b>Sennacherib exiled</b> the ten tribes <b>until Jeremiah came and returned them</b> to their land, <b>they did not count</b> the Jubilee cycle, as the Jubilee applies only when all twelve tribes are in their ancestral lands. When the exiles returned, a new Jubilee cycle was started, and the Temple was destroyed thirty-six years later, in the year after a Sabbatical Year.

### Part 9
The Gemara suggests a second answer to its question about the statement of the <i>baraita</i> which equates the destructions of the First Temple and the Second Temple. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and when it teaches: And likewise,</b> the same happened <b>when the Second</b> Temple was destroyed, it is not asserting that the Temple was destroyed in a year after a Sabbatical Year, because in fact the Second Temple was destroyed during a Sabbatical Year. Rather, it is referring <b>to the other</b> details the <i>baraita</i> provides with regard to the timing of the destruction, i.e., that it occurred on the Ninth of Av and on a Sunday.

### Part 10
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to conclude that not all of the details pertaining to the destruction of the First Temple also apply to the destruction of the Second Temple. <b>As, if you do not say so,</b> then with regard to the statement that the destruction occurred during the week of the priestly watch of Jehoiarib, <b>was the priestly watch of Jehoiarib present during</b> the time of <b>the Second</b> Temple?

### Part 11
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the watch of Jehoiarib did not exist during the Second Temple era? As it is taught: Only <b>four priestly watches ascended from the</b> Babylonian <b>exile,</b> while the other twenty stayed in Babylonia. And these are the watches who returned: The descendants of <b>Jedaiah, Harim, Pashḥur, and Immer. The prophets among</b> those who returned <b>arose and divided</b> these four families <b>into twenty-four watches.</b> They achieved this as follows: They wrote the names of these new twenty-four watches on pieces of paper, <b>mixed them up, and put them in a receptacle [<i>kalpi</i>]</b> from which lots were drawn. A representative from the family of <b>Jedaiah came and drew his portion and the lot of</b> five <b>other</b> watches, for a total of <b>six.</b>
