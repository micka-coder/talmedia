### Part 1
The Gemara objects: <b>This works out well according to the Rabbis, who say</b> that the <b>fiftieth year is not</b> included <b>in the counting</b> of the cycle of Sabbatical Years. It was therefore necessary to count the Jubilee Year. <b>But according to Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that the <b>fiftieth year is counted for here and for there,</b> i.e., it is both the fiftieth year of the previous cycle and the first year of the subsequent cycle, <b>why do I</b> need for them to count the Jubilee Years? If the Jubilee Year is not in effect, then it is <b>enough to</b> count the <b>Sabbatical</b> Years. The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is certainly not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And did they not count Sabbatical</b> Years <b>and Jubilee</b> Years once the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh were exiled? <b>But isn’t it written</b> that Jeremiah, who lived many years later, said: <b>“At the end of seven years you shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, that has been sold unto you,</b> and has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you; but your fathers did not listen unto Me, nor inclined their ear” (Jeremiah 34:14)?

### Part 3
The Gemara continues: <b>And we discussed this</b> verse: Why does it state: <b>“At the end of seven years</b> you shall let go every man”? <b>But isn’t it written</b> in the same verse: <b>“And has served you six years”? And Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> The verse is referring to two separate individuals. The phrase “and has served you <b>six</b> years” is referring <b>to</b> a typical Hebrew slave who <b>was sold,</b> who goes free after six years (see Exodus 21:2), <b>and</b> the phrase “at the end of <b>seven</b> years” is referring <b>to</b> a slave whose ear <b>was pierced</b> with an awl to extend his tenure. Such an individual remains a slave until the Jubilee Year, even if that is the following year, i.e., the end of the seventh year. If so, the verse indicates that the Jubilee Year was in effect in the times of Jeremiah, even though the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh were exiled.

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse was not stated by Jeremiah in the form of a command; rather, it <b>is written in</b> the form of <b>reproof.</b> That is, the <b>prophet</b> Jeremiah is <b>saying</b> to the Jewish people: <b>Did you send</b> free the pierced slaves when the Jubilee Year was observed? The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> there: <b>“And they listened and let them go”</b> (Jeremiah 34:10)? Evidently, the entire passage is referring to matters occurring in the present.

### Part 5
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Indeed, the Jubilee Year was not in effect once the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh were exiled. But <b>Jeremiah brought back</b> all the exiled tribes, <b>and Josiah, son of Amon, ruled over them. And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> Jeremiah <b>brought them back? As it is written: “For the seller shall not return to that which he has sold”</b> (Ezekiel 7:13). Ezekiel prophesied that there will come a time when fields will not be returned to the owners in the Jubilee Year. Now, is it <b>possible</b> that the <b>Jubilee</b> Year had already been <b>nullified and</b> yet <b>the prophet is prophesying that it will be annulled</b> in the future? <b>Rather,</b> this <b>teaches that Jeremiah brought back</b> the exiled tribes.

### Part 6
<b>And from where do we</b> derive that <b>Josiah ruled over</b> all <b>the</b> ten tribes exiled by Assyria? <b>As it is written:</b> “And as Josiah turned himself, then he spied the sepulchres…<b>then he said: What monument is that which I see? And the men of the city told him: It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed</b> these <b>things</b> that you have done <b>against the altar of Bethel”</b> (II Kings 23:16–17).

### Part 7
<b>Now, what connection does Josiah,</b> king of Judah, <b>have with the altar at Bethel,</b> a city in the kingdom of Israel? <b>Rather,</b> this indicates that <b>when Jeremiah brought back</b> the ten tribes, <b>Josiah ruled over them. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The fact that the tribes returned may be derived <b>from here: “Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you, when I would return the captivity of My people”</b> (Hosea 6:11). That is, when the ten tribes will return from their captivity, a king of Judah will rule over them.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA</strong> With regard to the <b>houses of the</b> unwalled <b>courtyards</b> mentioned in the Torah (see Leviticus 25:31), i.e., houses in villages that are not surrounded by walls, <b>one accords them the exceptional provisions that</b> apply <b>to houses of walled cities and the exceptional provisions that</b> apply <b>to fields.</b> Therefore, <b>they are redeemed immediately and</b> for <b>the entire twelve months</b> following the sale, <b>like</b> in <b>the</b> sale of <b>houses</b> of walled cities, and not like fields, which may be redeemed only after two years. <b>And they leave</b> the possession of the buyer <b>during the Jubilee</b> Year <b>or with</b> a per annum <b>deduction</b> from the <b>money</b> of the sale price, <b>like the</b> sale of <b>fields.</b> By contrast, houses of walled cities become the possession of the buyer in perpetuity after one year, and if they are redeemed within the year, one pays the full sale price.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “But the houses of the courtyards that have no wall round about them <b>shall be reckoned with the fields of the country;</b> they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the Jubilee” (Leviticus 25:31). <b>The verse juxtaposed</b> houses of unwalled courtyards <b>to an ancestral field: Just as an ancestral field leaves</b> the possession of the buyer <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year <b>or with</b> a per annum <b>deduction</b> from the <b>money</b> of the sale price, <b>so too, houses of the</b> unwalled <b>courtyards leave</b> the possession of the buyer <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year <b>or with the</b> per annum <b>deduction</b> from the <b>money</b> of the sale price.

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If</b> one derives the <i>halakha</i> from an ancestral field, then <b>just as an ancestral field may not be redeemed less than two years</b> after its sale, <b>so too, houses of the</b> unwalled <b>courtyards may not be redeemed less than two years</b> after their sale. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “They may be redeemed,”</b> indicating that they may be redeemed <b>immediately.</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Since you have accorded</b> houses of the unwalled courtyards <b>the exceptional provisions that</b> apply <b>to fields and the exceptional provisions that</b> apply <b>to the houses</b> of walled cities, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they do not leave</b> the possession of the buyer <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And they shall go out in the Jubilee.”</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>saying</b> in the last clause, i.e., why might one think that such houses do not leave the possession of the buyer in the Jubilee Year? After all, ancestral fields leave the possession of the buyer in the Jubilee Year, and the <i>tanna</i> teaches that the exceptional provisions of an ancestral field apply to houses in unwalled courtyards. <b>Rav Huna said:</b> The verse <b>is necessary only for</b> the case of <b>one who consecrates a house among the houses of the</b> unwalled <b>courtyards, and another redeemed it from the possession of</b> the <b>Temple</b> treasury, <b>and the Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrived in</b> the <b>second year</b> after its redemption.

### Part 12
Rav Huna elaborates: <b>To what will you compare</b> this case? <b>If you compare</b> this house <b>to houses of walled cities</b> that were consecrated and redeemed by another, then the house belongs <b>to the buyer in perpetuity</b> by the end of the first year (see 31b). <b>If you compare</b> it <b>to an ancestral field</b> that was consecrated and redeemed by another, <b>it leaves to</b> the possession of <b>the priests</b> in the Jubilee Year (see 25a). <b>For this</b> reason it <b>was necessary</b> for the verse to state: <b>“And they shall go out in the Jubilee,”</b> to teach that houses in unwalled courtyards which were consecrated and redeemed by another are returned to their owners in the Jubilee Year.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Zeira objects to this: Why</b> is it necessary to interpret this verse as referring <b>specifically</b> to a case where <b>another redeemed</b> the house from the Temple treasury? <b>Even</b> if another <b>did not redeem it,</b> the house should <b>also</b> be returned to its owner in the Jubilee Year, as the verse states simply: “And they shall go out in the Jubilee.” <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Zeira: An unredeemed house is not returned to its owners in the Jubilee Year, so <b>that</b> people <b>will not say</b> that <b>consecrated</b> property can <b>leave</b> the possession of the Temple treasury <b>without redemption.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara adds: And <b>from where do we</b> derive that consecrated property does not leave the possession of the Temple treasury without redemption? We derive it <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a Levite:</b> And <b>what,</b> if with regard to <b>a Levite, whose power is enhanced with regard to his sale,</b> as a Levite may always redeem a field or house that he sold (see mishna in 33b), <b>his power is diminished with regard to his consecration,</b> as a field that he consecrated does not leave the possession of the Temple treasury until he redeems it; then with regard to <b>an Israelite, whose power is diminished with regard to his sale,</b> since if he sells an ancestral field he may not redeem it for the first two years, and he may redeem a house of a walled city only within one year of the sale, <b>is it not logical that his power is diminished with regard to his consecration</b> and that if he consecrated a house of an unwalled courtyard he must redeem it from the Temple treasury before it enters his possession?

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to a Levite, <b>from where do we</b> derive that his consecrated property does not leave the possession of the Temple treasury without redemption? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And if a man purchases from the Levites, the house that was sold in the city of his possession shall go out during the Jubilee Year” (Leviticus 25:33). From the phrase <b>“that was sold…shall go out” I</b> would <b>derive</b> that any item sold by a Levite returns to him in the Jubilee Year, <b>even his slaves, movable property, and promissory notes.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “House…in the city of his possession,”</b> which teaches that these items do not return to the Levite without redemption.

### Part 16
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “That was sold”?</b> The verse teaches that a house or field <b>that was sold</b> by a Levite <b>leaves</b> the possession of the buyer and enters the Levite’s possession <b>for free in the Jubilee Year, but the consecration</b> of a Levite <b>does not leave for free in the Jubilee Year; rather,</b> it leaves only <b>with redemption.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> Rav Huna, who says that a house in an unwalled courtyard that was consecrated and subsequently redeemed by another returns to the original owner in the Jubilee Year, <b>disagrees with Rabbi Oshaya. As Rabbi Oshaya says: All</b> items <b>were included in</b> the command: <b>And he will give the money and it will be assured to him</b> (see Leviticus 27:19), i.e., one who redeems an item from the Temple treasury becomes its owner in all regards.

### Part 18
<b>When the verse specified with regard to an ancestral field: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord,</b> as a field dedicated; his ancestral field shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:21), one derives that <b>it is</b> only with regard to <b>a field that</b> one can <b>redeem it and</b> yet <b>it leaves</b> the possession of the Temple treasury to enter the possession of <b>the priests</b> in the Jubilee Year. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>these</b> houses in unwalled courtyards that were consecrated and redeemed by another, <b>they remain in their current state,</b> i.e., in the possession of the one who redeemed them.

### Part 19
The Gemara asks: According to Rabbi Oshaya, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“and they shall go out in the Jubilee”? Rav Pappa said: It is necessary only for</b> the case of <b>one who sells a house among the houses of the</b> unwalled <b>courtyards and the Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrived in</b> the <b>second year.</b> The verse indicates that the house is nevertheless returned to the seller.

### Part 20
Rav Pappa elaborates: <b>To what will you compare</b> this case? <b>If you compare</b> this case <b>to</b> one of the <b>houses of walled cities</b> that was sold, then the house belongs <b>to the buyer in perpetuity</b> at the end of the first year. And <b>if you compare it to</b> the case of <b>an ancestral field</b> that was sold, then <b>it requires completion</b> of another year after the Jubilee Year, as taught in a <i>baraita</i> cited earlier (29b): If the buyer consumed an ancestral field’s produce for one year before the Jubilee Year, he completes another year after the Jubilee Year. <b>For this</b> reason <b>it was necessary</b> for the verse to state: <b>“And they shall go out in the Jubilee,”</b> to teach that in such a case the house of an unwalled courtyard returns to the possession of the original owner.

### Part 21
The Gemara notes: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Huna, and</b> this <i>baraita</i> is <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Oshaya:</b> With regard to <b>one who consecrates a house among the houses of</b> unwalled <b>courtyards, this</b> individual <b>may redeem</b> the house <b>immediately and he may redeem it always.</b> If <b>another</b> individual <b>redeemed it from the possession of the Temple</b> treasury, and the <b>Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrived and it was not redeemed</b> by the original owner, the house <b>returns to the owner in the Jubilee</b> Year.
