### Part 1
<b>Rava said: Everyone</b> agrees that <b>uncertain interest is prohibited; and here,</b> the dispute <b>between</b> Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis concerns the permissibility <b>of interest</b> given <b>on the condition that it will be returned.</b> That is, in addition to the arrangement described in the <i>baraita</i>, the parties agreed that the buyer will consume the produce, and if the sale will later be nullified, then the buyer will reimburse the seller for the value of the produce. One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that although the interest is subsequently refunded, this practice is <b>prohibited, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that this is permitted.

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to one who sells a house from among the houses of walled cities, if <b>the seller died, his son may redeem</b> the house from the buyer. The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious,</b> as a son inherits his father’s property. The Gemara responds: <b>Lest you say</b> that when <b>the Merciful One states: “And if a man sells a dwelling house</b> in a walled city, then he may redeem it until the completion of the year after it is sold” (Leviticus 25:29), this indicates that the man who redeems the house must be the same man who sold it, <b>and this</b> son did <b>not sell;</b> therefore, the same verse <b>teaches us: “And he shall have the right of redemption,”</b> indicating that the right of redemption applies <b>in any case,</b> either to the seller or his son.

### Part 3
The mishna further teaches: If <b>the buyer died,</b> the seller <b>may redeem</b> the house <b>from the possession of</b> the buyer’s <b>son.</b> The Gemara asks: This, too, is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “Then the house that is in the walled city shall stand in possession <b>of the one who bought it</b> in perpetuity” (Leviticus 25:30), <b>and</b> as <b>this</b> son did <b>not buy</b> the house, the buyer cannot redeem it from him; therefore, the previous verse <b>teaches us: “He shall have the right of redemption,”</b> indicating that this right applies <b>in any case,</b> even from the buyer’s son.

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches that if the buyer sold the house to another, <b>one calculates</b> the <b>year only from the time that</b> the owner <b>sold</b> the house to the first buyer, as it is stated: “And if it is not redeemed until the passage of a full year for him” (Leviticus 25:30). <b>The Sages taught:</b> When the verse states <b>“year,” I do not know if</b> one counts the <b>year</b> from when the owner sold it <b>to the first</b> buyer, or <b>if</b> one counts the <b>year</b> from when the first buyer sold it <b>to</b> the <b>second. When</b> the verse <b>states: “Until the passage of a full year for him,” you must</b> say that it is <b>a year</b> from when the owner sold it <b>to the first</b> buyer.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: In such a case, if the owner did not redeem the house within one year of the first sale, <b>to whom</b> does it belong <b>in perpetuity? Rabbi Elazar says:</b> It belongs <b>in perpetuity to</b> the <b>first</b> buyer. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It belongs <b>in perpetuity to</b> the <b>second</b> buyer. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> it is understandable why the house belongs to the first buyer, <b>as one calculates</b> the year <b>according to his</b> acquisition. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, what is the reason</b> that the house belongs to the second buyer after the conclusion of one year from the acquisition of the first buyer? <b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel says: What did</b> the <b>first</b> buyer <b>sell to the second</b> buyer? He sold him <b>any right</b> to the field <b>that will come into his possession.</b> This includes the fact that the house will belong to him in perpetuity after the conclusion of one year from the first purchase.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel says:</b> If one <b>sold two houses of walled cities, one on the fifteenth</b> day <b>of the first</b> month of <b>Adar</b> in a leap year, <b>and</b> the other <b>one on the first</b> day <b>of the second Adar,</b> then the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: With regard to <b>this</b> house <b>that he sold to him</b> on the first day <b>of the second Adar, once the first day of Adar of the next year arrives, it is counted as</b> though a full <b>year</b> has elapsed. With regard to <b>this</b> house <b>that he sold to him on the fifteenth</b> day <b>of the first Adar, it is not counted as</b> though a full <b>year</b> has elapsed <b>until the fifteenth</b> day <b>of Adar of the next year.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Ravina objects to this: But let</b> the first buyer <b>say</b> to the second: <b>I preceded</b> you and <b>kindled a fire before you,</b> i.e., I bought my house before you acquired yours. How, then, can you gain possession in perpetuity before me? The Gemara responds: This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the second buyer can <b>say to him: You descended to</b> the house during the <b>intercalated</b> month, i.e., the first Adar, and as it is taught in the mishna, the seller has the right to redeem the house for an entire year, including the intercalated month.

### Part 8
<b>And Rabbi Abba bar Memel says:</b> If <b>two lambs were born to</b> a single owner, <b>one on the fifteenth</b> day <b>of the first Adar, and</b> the other <b>one on the first</b> day <b>of the second Adar,</b> then the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: With regard to <b>this</b> lamb <b>that was born</b> on the first day <b>of the second Adar, once the first day of Adar of the next year arrives, it is counted as</b> though a full <b>year</b> has elapsed, and if it was a firstborn it should be sacrificed before that time arrives <i>ab initio</i>. With regard to <b>this</b> lamb <b>that was born to him on the fifteenth</b> day <b>of the first Adar, it is not counted as</b> though a full <b>year</b> has elapsed <b>until the fifteenth</b> day <b>of Adar of the next year.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Ravina</b> again <b>objects to this: But let</b> the lamb that was born first <b>say</b> to the other lamb: <b>I preceded</b> you and <b>ate vegetables before you,</b> i.e., I was born first. The Gemara responds: This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the second lamb can <b>say to</b> the first: <b>You descended to</b> the world during the <b>intercalated</b> month, which is added to the year, whereas <b>I did not descend to</b> the world during the <b>intercalated</b> month.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I also</b> need <b>this</b> second <i>halakha</i>? <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> with regard to the lambs is identical to <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> concerning the houses. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>there,</b> with regard to houses of walled cities, <b>where it is written: “A full</b> year” (Leviticus 25:30), this is indeed the <i>halakha</i>, but <b>here,</b> with regard to lambs, <b>where it is not written: A full</b> year, perhaps this is <b>not</b> the case; Rabbi Abba bar Memel therefore <b>teaches us that</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the words <b>“year”</b> and <b>“year”</b> the two cases <b>derive</b> their <i>halakhot</i> <b>from each other.</b> With regard to houses of walled cities, it is written: “And if it is not redeemed until the passage of a full year for him” (Leviticus 25:30), and it is written with regard to lambs: “Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year” (Exodus 12:5).

### Part 11
§ The mishna teaches: <b>When it states: “A full</b> year” (Leviticus 25:30), this serves to include the intercalated month in the year calculated from the sale. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> This serves <b>to give</b> the seller <b>a year</b> and <b>its addition.</b> With regard to this matter, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“A full year”; Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> This means that one <b>counts 365 days, in accordance with the number</b> of <b>days</b> in <b>a solar</b> year, which are eleven more than in a lunar year. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> One <b>counts twelve months from day to day, and if</b> an additional month <b>was intercalated</b> into the year, then the month <b>was intercalated to</b> the benefit of the seller, i.e., he has thirteen months to redeem his house.

### Part 12
§ The mishna teaches: If the final <b>day of the twelve-month</b> period <b>arrived and</b> the house <b>was not redeemed,</b> it becomes the property of the buyer in perpetuity. This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who buys a house in a walled city and one to whom it is given as a gift, as it is stated: “In perpetuity [<i>latzemitut</i>]” (Leviticus 25:30). With regard to this matter, <b>the Sages taught: “<i>Latzemitut</i>”</b> means <b>in perpetuity;</b> that is, the seller can no longer redeem the house against the buyer’s will, nor does it return to his possession in the Jubilee Year. <b>Another matter</b> derived from this verse is that <b>“<i>latzemitut</i>”</b> serves <b>to include</b> a house given as <b>a gift. What is the reason,</b> i.e., how is this derived from “<i>latzemitut</i>”? The verse could have stated <b><i>tzemit</i>,</b> but instead it states <b><i>tzemitut</i>.</b> The expanded term serves to include a house given as a gift.

### Part 13
<b>The Sages said</b> the above <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Pappa,</b> and then asked: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this ruling? Ostensibly, it is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as if</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, doesn’t he say</b> with regard to the return of an ancestral field in the Jubilee Year that <b>a gift is not like a sale,</b> i.e., an ancestral field given as a gift does not return to the original owner in the Jubilee Year? Likewise, a house in a walled city given as a gift should not become the perpetual property of the buyer after twelve months. <b>Rav Pappa said: You may even say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> and it <b>is different here, as the Merciful One includes</b> a house given as a gift through the term <b>“<i>latzemitut</i>.”</b>

### Part 14
<b>The Sages said to Rav Pappa, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> said <b>to Rav Pappa: But</b> consider the case <b>of the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>as it is written:</b> “In this year of Jubilee <b>you shall return</b> every man unto his possession” (Leviticus 25:13), and the Sages teach that this verse serves <b>to include the gift, and</b> yet <b>Rabbi Meir does not include</b> a gift. <b>Rather, this</b> <i>baraita</i> is <b>certainly not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 15
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>one who consecrates a house among the houses of walled cities, this</b> individual <b>may redeem</b> it from the Temple treasury, <b>and he may always redeem</b> it, even after the first year, unlike a sale. If <b>another redeemed</b> the house <b>from the possession of the Temple</b> treasury, and <b>the</b> final <b>day of</b> the <b>twelve-month</b> period from its redemption <b>arrived and</b> the house <b>was not redeemed</b> by its owner, the house <b>has</b> become the property of the other individual <b>in perpetuity.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Shmuel says: As the verse states:</b> “And if it is not redeemed until the passage of a full year for him, then the house that is in the walled city shall stand in possession of the one who bought it in perpetuity, throughout his generations; it shall not go out in the Jubilee” (Leviticus 25:30). The verse indicates that the house belongs in perpetuity to <b>“the one who bought it,” even</b> if he purchased it <b>from the possession of the Temple</b> treasury. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why is the consecrator always capable of redeeming the house from the possession of the Temple treasury? <b>Let it</b> belong to the <b>Temple</b> treasury <b>in perpetuity</b> if it is not redeemed within one year. The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “Throughout his generations.” Excluded,</b> therefore, is the <b>Temple</b> treasury, <b>as</b> it is not a person and it <b>does not have generations.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the phrase in the above verse: <b>“It shall not go out in the Jubilee”?</b> After all, it already stated: “In perpetuity.” <b>Rav Safra said:</b> This phrase <b>is necessary only for</b> the case of <b>one who sells a house among the houses of walled cities and the Jubilee</b> Year <b>arrived during the year</b> of the sale. It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the house <b>should leave</b> the possession of the buyer to enter the possession of its owner <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us: “It shall not go out in the Jubilee,”</b> to teach that this is not the case.

### Part 18
<strong>MISHNA</strong> <b>At first,</b> the buyer <b>would conceal himself</b> on the final <b>day of the twelve-month</b> period, <b>in order to</b> ensure <b>that it would become his in perpetuity. Hillel instituted that</b> the seller <b>would place [<i>ḥolesh</i>] his money in the chamber</b> of the court <b>and</b> that <b>he will break the door and enter</b> the house, and <b>when the other</b> individual, i.e., the buyer, <b>will wish</b> to do so, <b>he may come</b> to the chamber <b>and take his money.</b>

### Part 19
<strong>GEMARA</strong> <b>Rava says:</b> It may be inferred <b>from the ordinance of Hillel</b> in the mishna that if one says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce on the condition that you will give me two hundred dinars, and she gave</b> the money to <b>him with his consent,</b> then she is <b>divorced.</b> But if she gave it to him <b>against his will, she is not divorced.</b>
