### Part 1
<b>the owner gives twenty-six</b> <i>sela</i> and takes the field. He pays the twenty that he initially offered; plus five <i>sela</i>, which is one-fifth of the total future sum, i.e., one-quarter of his initial offer. In addition, he adds one <i>sela</i>, the difference between his initial offer and that of the other person, so that the Temple treasury will not receive less than the twenty-one <i>sela</i> offer proposed by the other person. If the owner says he will pay twenty <i>sela</i> and another person said: The field is hereby mine for a payment <b>of twenty-two</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>the owner gives twenty-seven</b> <i>sela</i> and takes the field.

### Part 2
If the owner says he will pay twenty <i>sela</i> and another said: The field is hereby mine for a payment <b>of twenty-three</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>the owner gives twenty-eight</b> <i>sela</i> and takes the field. If the owner says he will pay twenty <i>sela</i> and another said: The field is hereby mine for a payment <b>of twenty-four</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>the owner gives twenty-nine</b> <i>sela</i> and takes the field. If the owner says he will pay twenty <i>sela</i> and another said: The field is hereby mine for a payment <b>of twenty-five</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>the owner gives thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>as</b> the owner adds one-fifth only to the amount that he bid, and <b>does not add one-fifth to the addition of that</b> other person.

### Part 3
If the owner said he will pay twenty <i>sela</i> and <b>one</b> other person <b>said:</b> The field is <b>hereby mine</b> for a payment <b>of twenty-six</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>if the owner wished to pay thirty-one</b> <i>sela</i> <b>and a dinar the owner takes precedence; and if not,</b> the treasurer <b>says to the other person:</b> The field <b>has come into your</b> possession based on your bid, as it is more than the Temple treasury can compel the owner to pay.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if one said: The field is mine for ten <i>sela</i>, and another said for twenty, and another said thirty, and another said forty, and yet another said fifty; and then the one who bid fifty reneged on his offer, the treasurer repossesses from his property up to ten <i>sela</i>, and it is redeemed by the one who bid forty. In this manner, the Temple treasury does not lose. <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> that the treasurer repossesses ten <i>sela</i> from the one who initially offered fifty <i>sela</i> <b>only when the one who</b> offered <b>forty stands in his place</b> and intends to purchase the field, as the Temple treasury would have lost only ten <i>sela</i>.

### Part 5
<b>But</b> if <b>the one who</b> offered <b>forty does not stand in his place,</b> i.e., he too reneged on his offer, then the additional amount they had offered is <b>divided between</b> the one who initially offered fifty and the one who offered forty, as follows: The one who offered fifty pays all ten of the difference between fifty and forty, but he must also pay half of the extra ten that is the difference between the offer of forty and the previous offer of thirty. The reason is that the one who bid fifty agreed to that extra ten that raised the price from thirty to forty. In sum, the one who offered fifty pays fifteen, and the one who said forty pays five.

### Part 6
The Gemara raises an objection to the statement of Rav Ḥisda from that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: If the one who bid <b>forty reneged</b> on his offer, the treasurer <b>repossesses from his property up to ten</b> <i>sela</i>. The Gemara explains the objection: According to Rav Ḥisda, there is a difficulty: <b>Why</b> does the mishna rule that his property is repossessed by ten <i>sela</i>? <b>Let the one who</b> offered <b>fifty give together with him,</b> and therefore the one who offered forty should give only five. The Gemara responds: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where there is no one who</b> offered <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i>.

### Part 7
The Gemara further objects: The mishna also teaches that if the one who bid <b>thirty reneged</b> on his offer, the treasurer <b>repossesses from his property up to ten</b> <i>sela</i>. But according to Rav Ḥisda, <b>why</b> is only his property repossessed? <b>Let</b> the one <b>who</b> offered <b>forty give together with him.</b> The Gemara again responds: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where there is no one who</b> offered <b>forty</b> <i>sela</i>. The Gemara persists: The mishna states that if the one who bid <b>twenty reneged</b> on his offer, the treasurer <b>repossesses from his property up to ten</b> <i>sela</i>. According to Rav Ḥisda, <b>why</b> is only his property repossessed? <b>Let</b> the one <b>who</b> offered <b>thirty give together with him.</b> Once again, the Gemara responds: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where there is no one who</b> offered <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i>.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If the one who bid <b>ten reneged</b> on his offer, the treasurer <b>sells</b> the field <b>at its value and collects the remainder from</b> the property <b>of the one</b> who bid <b>ten,</b> to complete the sum of ten <i>sela</i>. Why is payment collected only from the one who offered ten? <b>Let the one who</b> offered <b>twenty give together with him. And if you would say that here too, there is no one who</b> offered <b>twenty</b> <i>sela</i>, then <b>if so,</b> why does the mishna state: And <b>collects from</b> the one who bid <b>ten?</b> The mishna <b>should have</b> stated simply: And <b>collects from him,</b> as there is no one else who submitted an offer.

### Part 9
<b>Rather, Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> when the potential loss incurred by the Temple treasury is divided, they reneged on their offers <b>simultaneously;</b> whereas <b>there,</b> in the mishna, where only one individual must cover the loss, two individuals reneged <b>one after the other.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>all of them reneged at once they divide</b> the potential loss incurred by the Temple treasury <b>between them.</b> Now <b>didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: The treasurer <b>repossesses from his property up to ten</b> <i>sela</i>, without any mention of a division? <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who holds that when two individuals renege on their offers simultaneously they divide the loss between them? The Gemara comments: Indeed, <b>conclude from it</b> that this is the case.

### Part 10
The Gemara notes that <b>there are</b> those <b>who raise</b> this <i>baraita</i> as a contradiction: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that if the one <b>who</b> bid <b>ten reneged</b> on his offer, the treasurer <b>sells</b> the field <b>at its value and collects the remainder from</b> the property <b>of the one</b> who bid <b>ten. But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>they divide</b> the potential loss to the Temple treasury <b>between them? Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here</b> in the <i>baraita</i> they reneged on their offers <b>simultaneously,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> in the mishna, two individuals reneged <b>one after the other.</b>

### Part 11
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>the owner says</b> he will pay <b>twenty</b> <i>sela</i> <b>and any</b> other <b>person says</b> he will pay <b>twenty</b> <i>sela</i>, the owner’s offer takes precedence because he adds one-fifth. The Gemara asks: Is this <b>to say that</b> an offer of the owner, which perforce includes an additional <b>one-fifth,</b> is <b>preferable</b> to a higher offer for the principal submitted by another? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 4:3): If one is unable to transport his second-tithe produce to Jerusalem to consume it there, the produce is redeemed and the redemption money is spent on food in Jerusalem. If <b>the owner</b> of second tithe <b>says</b> he will redeem it <b>for one <i>sela</i> and one</b> other <b>says</b> he will redeem it <b>for one <i>sela</i> and one <i>issar</i>,</b> the offer <b>of one <i>sela</i> and one <i>issar</i> takes precedence, because he adds to the principal.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>Here, where the</b> additional <b>one-fifth is a gain of the Temple</b> treasury, a calculation that includes the <b>one-fifth</b> is <b>preferable.</b> By contrast, <b>there, where the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> belongs to <b>the owner,</b> i.e., the Temple treasury gains nothing from it, as the redemption money for second-tithe produce belongs to the owner and must be taken to Jerusalem for him to spend it there, <b>let the principal be redeemed</b> for <b>a proper</b> sum, and <b>we do not care</b> about the additional <b>one-fifth.</b>

### Part 13
§ The mishna teaches that if the owner says he will pay twenty <i>sela</i> and <b>one</b> other person <b>said:</b> The field <b>is hereby mine for</b> a payment of <b>twenty-five</b> <i>sela</i>, the owner <b>gives thirty</b> <i>sela</i>. The Gemara suggests: <b>And let the owner say: A man has come in my place [<i>baḥarikin</i>]</b> to redeem the field, as even when accounting for the one-fifth that I must add, my offer stands at twenty-five <i>sela</i>, identical to this man’s offer. Why, then, am I forced to redeem the field for a greater sum? The Gemara responds: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where the owner</b> initially <b>said</b> he would pay twenty <i>sela</i> and an additional <b>dinar,</b> one-quarter of one <i>sela</i>. When the additional one-fifth is taken into account, the owner’s offer is greater than twenty-five <i>sela</i>.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> explicitly that he offered an additional <b>dinar.</b> The Gemara responds: The <i>tanna</i> was <b>not meticulous</b> with regard to the mention of small sums of money such as one dinar. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> was the <i>tanna</i> <b>not</b> meticulous? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the mishna that in a case where one said: The field is hereby mine for a payment of twenty-six <i>sela</i>, <b>if the owner wished to pay thirty-one</b> <i>sela</i> <b>and a dinar the owner takes precedence? Rather, Rava said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where the owner said</b> he would redeem it for twenty <i>sela</i> and <b>one <i>peruta</i>, and</b> the <i>tanna</i> was <b>not meticulous</b> with regard to mentioning such a tiny sum.

### Part 15
§ The mishna teaches that even when the owner must give the amount offered by the second person for the field, he adds one-fifth only to the amount that he himself bid, <b>as he does not add one-fifth to the addition</b> of the other person. <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> that the owner does not add one-fifth to the addition of the other person <b>only when</b> the <b>consecrated</b> property <b>was not appraised by three</b> people. <b>But</b> if the <b>consecrated</b> property <b>was appraised by three</b> people, and the field was found to be worth the amount offered by the other person, the owner <b>does add</b> one-fifth to the addition of the other person.

### Part 16
The Gemara notes that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say</b> the owner <b>adds</b> one-fifth to the addition of the other person <b>and Beit Hillel say</b> the owner <b>does not add</b> that one-fifth. The Gemara explains: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this <i>baraita</i>? <b>If</b> it is discussing a case where the field was <b>not appraised</b> by three people, then <b>what is the reasoning of Beit Shammai</b> for their ruling that the owner must add one-fifth to the addition of the other person? <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> must be referring to a case <b>where</b> the field was <b>appraised</b> by three people and the appraisal matched the offer of the other person. The owner must therefore add one-fifth to the addition of that other person.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say that Rav Ḥisda says</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai?</b> This is difficult, as there is a principle that the <i>halakha</i> is ruled in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel. The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the field was <b>not appraised</b> by three people, <b>and Beit Shammai are stringent</b> and rule that the owner must nevertheless add one-fifth to the addition of the other person. Rav Ḥisda rules in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel that the owner adds one-fifth to the addition of the other person only when the field was appraised by three people.

### Part 18
And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the field was <b>appraised</b> by three people and the appraisal matched the offer of the other person; <b>and</b> one should <b>reverse</b> the opinions, i.e., <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that even in such a case the owner <b>does not add</b> one-fifth to the addition of the other person. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this interpretation, <b>let</b> the dispute <b>be taught alongside</b> the other rare instances of <b>leniencies of Beit Shammai and stringencies of Beit Hillel</b> (see tractate <i>Eduyyot</i>, chapters 4 and 5). Yet, this dispute does not appear there. <b>Rather,</b> one must accept the previous answer, that the <i>baraita</i> is <b>actually</b> discussing a case <b>where</b> the field was <b>not appraised</b> by three people, <b>and Beit Shammai are stringent.</b>

### Part 19
§ The mishna teaches that in a case where the owner offers to pay twenty <i>sela</i> and <b>one</b> other person <b>said:</b> The field is <b>hereby mine for twenty-six</b> <i>sela</i>, if the owner wished to pay thirty-one <i>sela</i> and a dinar, the owner takes precedence. The Gemara elaborates: If the owner <b>wished</b> to pay the additional sum, then <b>yes,</b> he redeems the field, but if the owner <b>did not wish</b> to do so, <b>no,</b> he is not forced to redeem it.

### Part 20
The Gemara explains that the reason is that the owner can <b>say: A man has come in my place</b> to redeem the field for a higher sum, since even when accounting for the additional one-fifth that I must give, my offer amounts to a total of only twenty-five <i>sela</i>, whereas this other person has offered to pay twenty-six. Nevertheless, if the owner chooses to redeem the field, he gives the other person’s offer, twenty-six <i>sela</i>, plus an additional one-fifth of his initial offer, for a total of thirty-one <i>sela</i>.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> the additional <b>dinar</b> that the owner gives, <b>what is its purpose? Rav Sheshet said this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: If the owner wished from the outset to give</b> based on <b>a calculation that reaches thirty-one</b> <i>sela</i> <b>and</b> one <b>dinar,</b> the owner takes precedence.
