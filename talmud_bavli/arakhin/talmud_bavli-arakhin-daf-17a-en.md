### Part 1
<b>A calamity awaits him.</b>

### Part 2
§ The Gemara returns to the topic of rebuke. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: Were the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> to have <b>entered into judgment with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, they would not have been able to stand before</b> the <b>rebuke. As it is stated: “Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before the Lord concerning all the righteous acts of the Lord, which He did to you and to your fathers”</b> (I Samuel 12:7). This indicates that God acted towards the patriarchs with righteousness, i.e., mercy, not as they deserved according to the strict letter of the law.

### Part 3
§ The verse states: <b>“This is the generation of them that seek after Him, that seek Your face, Jacob. Selah”</b> (Psalms 24:6). This verse teaches that the level of the generation and those who lead them, i.e., those who seek after Him, are the same. <b>Rabbi Yehuda Nesia and the Rabbis disagree about this. One says:</b> The level of the <b>generation follows</b> the level of the <b>leader, and one says:</b> The level of the <b>leader follows</b> the level of <b>his generation.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., matter, is this stated? <b>If we say for good, that</b> one <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>if</b> the <b>generation is good</b> then their <b>leader</b> will be <b>good, and</b> one <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>if</b> the <b>leader is good</b> then his <b>generation will be good,</b> this cannot be correct, as <b>there is</b> the case of King <b>Zedekiah, who was good, but his generation was not good. And</b> conversely, there is the case of <b>Jehoiakim who was not good, but his generation was good.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara cites proof for these claims. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word from the Lord, saying”</b> (Jeremiah 26:1), and similarly with regard to Zedekiah the verse states: “And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah, son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the Lord, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying” (Jeremiah 28:1). Why did the prophet use the term “in the beginning” exclusively with regard to these two kings, as opposed to: During the first year of his reign, or a similar formulation?

### Part 6
This term teaches that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, sought to revert the world to chaos and void,</b> as it was in the beginning before Creation (Genesis 1:1–2), <b>on account of Jehoiakim,</b> who did evil in the eyes of God. <b>Once He observed the</b> people of <b>his generation, His mind was settled.</b> Likewise, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, sought to revert the world to chaos and void, on account of the generation of Zedekiah,</b> but <b>once He observed Zedekiah, His mind was settled.</b> This shows that the leader and his generation are not necessarily on the same level in terms of righteousness.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, we are speaking in terms of harshness and gentleness.</b> One Sage holds that if the leader is harsh, then the generation will be harsh. If the leader is gentle and kind, the generation will be the same. The other Sage holds that if the people of a certain generation are harsh, they will have a harsh leader; if the generation is gentle and kind, the leader will be similar.
