### Part 1
<b>But here,</b> with regard to their opinion that even if the son consecrated the field before his father’s death it is considered an ancestral field, this is because they <b>found</b> another allusion in the <b>verse and interpreted</b> it as follows: If the verse meant to indicate only the <i>halakha</i> that Rabbi Meir derives from it, <b>let the Merciful One write:</b> And <b>if</b> he will consecrate unto the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not his ancestral field, or: Which is not an ancestral field. What</b> is the meaning of the extra word “of” in the phrase: “Which is not <b>of his ancestral field”</b> (Leviticus 27:22)? It teaches that only <b>a field that is not due to become</b> his <b>ancestral field</b> is treated like a purchased field, thereby <b>excluding this</b> field, <b>which is due to become</b> his <b>ancestral field.</b>

### Part 2
§ The mishna teaches: <b>The priests and the Levites may always consecrate</b> their ancestral fields and may always redeem their ancestral fields, both before the Jubilee Year and after the Jubilee Year. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the mishna’s statement that they <b>may</b> always <b>redeem</b> their ancestral fields <b>was necessary,</b> in order <b>to exclude</b> them <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> that applies to the ancestral field <b>of an Israelite, which may be redeemed only until</b> the <b>Jubilee</b> Year, and if not redeemed by then, it is given to the priests. In contrast, the mishna <b>teaches us that priests and Levites may always redeem</b> their fields. <b>But</b> with regard to the statement that they <b>may</b> always <b>consecrate</b> their fields, <b>why</b> does the mishna <b>specifically</b> mention <b>priests and Levites? Even an Israelite</b> may always consecrate his field, both before and after the Jubilee Year.

### Part 3
The Gemara continues: <b>And if you would say</b> that the mishna means that priests and Levites may consecrate their fields <b>during the Jubilee Year itself,</b> whereas an Israelite may not, <b>this works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who says</b> (24a) that if an Israelite consecrated his field <b>during the Jubilee Year itself it is not consecrated.</b> Accordingly, the mishna <b>teaches us that priests and Levites may always consecrate</b> their fields, even in the Jubilee Year itself. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, why</b> does the mishna <b>specifically</b> mention <b>priests and Levites? Even an Israelite</b> may consecrate his field during the Jubilee.

### Part 4
The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> one may similarly ask: <b>Why do I</b> need the statement that priests and Levites may consecrate their fields <b>both before the Jubilee</b> Year <b>and after the Jubilee</b> Year? Doesn’t the mishna already state that they may always consecrate their fields? <b>Rather, since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in the <b>first</b> mishna in this chapter (24a) that Israelites may not consecrate their fields less than two years <b>before the Jubilee and</b> they may not redeem them less than one year <b>after the Jubilee,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>also taught</b> in the <b>latter</b> mishna that priests and Levites may consecrate their fields <b>both after the Jubilee and before the Jubilee,</b> despite the fact that there is no novelty in this statement.

### Part 5
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in the <b>first</b> mishna that Israelites <b>may neither consecrate</b> their fields less than two years before the Jubilee <b>nor redeem</b> them less than one year after the Jubilee, the <i>tanna</i> <b>also taught</b> in the <b>latter</b> mishna that priests and Levites <b>may</b> always <b>consecrate and redeem</b> their fields, despite the fact that there is no novelty with regard to consecrating in this statement either, as Israelites may also consecrate their fields both after the Jubilee and before the Jubilee.
