### Part 1
<b>It is</b> merely <b>cutting flesh,</b> and there is no reason why it should be prohibited. <b>Rabba said: No,</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning cutting open her abdomen is <b>necessary</b> only to teach that it is permitted <b>to bring a knife by way of the public thoroughfare</b> for that purpose, despite the fact that this constitutes a prohibited labor by Torah law.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> does <b>this teach us?</b> Does it teach <b>that</b> even in a case <b>of uncertainty we desecrate Shabbat</b> for the chance of saving a life? But <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> this in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 83a): With regard to <b>one upon whom a rockslide fell,</b> and there is <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether <b>he is there</b> under the debris or whether <b>he is not there,</b> and there is also <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether he is still <b>alive</b> or whether he is <b>dead,</b> and finally there is <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether the person under the debris is <b>a gentile</b> or <b>a Jew, one clears the pile</b> from <b>atop him</b> on Shabbat.

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: It is necessary to teach that one may bring a knife in the case of a woman, <b>lest you say</b> that it is <b>specifically there</b> that one may desecrate Shabbat, <b>as</b> the person who was buried under the rockslide <b>had a presumptive status of being alive</b> and therefore he is assumed to still be alive. <b>But here, where</b> the child <b>had no prior presumptive status of being alive,</b> as he was not yet born, you might <b>say</b> that one may <b>not</b> desecrate Shabbat in order to save his life. Therefore, it is necessary for Shmuel to <b>teach us</b> that even here one may desecrate Shabbat for the possibility of saving the fetus’s life.

### Part 4
§ The mishna taught: In the case of <b>a woman who was killed</b> through court-imposed capital punishment, one may derive benefit from her hair. The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> is it permitted? After all, a corpse and its hair <b>are items from which deriving benefit is prohibited. Rav said</b> that this is referring to a case <b>where she says</b> before she dies: <b>Give my hair to my daughter.</b> The Gemara asks: Is the prohibition contingent on the deceased’s wishes? <b>Were she to say: Give my hand to my daughter, would we give</b> the hand <b>to her?</b>

### Part 5
Rather, <b>Rav said:</b> This is not referring to the actual hair of the deceased, but <b>to a wig [<i>pe’a nokhrit</i>],</b> which is not part of the deceased’s body. The Gemara infers from Rav’s statement that the <b>reason</b> it is permitted is <b>that</b> she <b>said</b> to <b>give</b> her wig to her daughter, thereby indicating that she did not consider it part of her body. <b>But</b> if she <b>did not say</b> to <b>give</b> her wig to her daughter, <b>it is</b> considered part of <b>her body, and</b> it <b>is forbidden</b> to derive benefit from it.

### Part 6
The Gemara explains why this implication is problematic: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, raise this</b> as <b>a dilemma? As Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina raised a dilemma:</b> With regard to the <b>hair of righteous women</b> in a city whose residents were incited to idolatry and, therefore, all of their property must be burned, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered their property and burned, or part of their body and not burned?

### Part 7
<b>And Rava said:</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, was not referring to actual hair, but rather <b>he raised</b> his <b>dilemma with regard to a wig.</b> This is difficult according to the opinion of Rav, as his ruling indicates that a wig should be considered part of a woman’s body unless she stipulated otherwise. The Gemara answers: <b>When Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, raised</b> his <b>dilemma</b> as to whether a wig is considered part of the body, he was referring specifically to a case <b>where</b> the wig was <b>hanging on a peg.</b> The dilemma is whether it is considered part of her clothing, which, like her body, is not burned, or whether it is considered like any other property of hers, since she was not wearing it at the time.

### Part 8
On the other hand, <b>here</b> Rav is referring to a wig <b>that is</b> actually <b>attached to her.</b> In such a case, one may correctly infer that the <b>reason</b> that it is permitted is <b>that</b> the deceased <b>said</b> to <b>give</b> her wig to her daughter, thereby indicating that she did not consider it part of her body. <b>But</b> if she <b>did not say</b> to <b>give</b> her wig to her daughter, <b>it is</b> considered to be part of <b>her body and is prohibited.</b>

### Part 9
This claim, that the mishna is dealing with a wig rather than natural hair, is <b>difficult for Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak.</b> He explains the difficulty: The mishna <b>teaches</b> the issue of the prohibition of the woman’s hair as being <b>similar</b> to the other prohibition it mentions, that <b>of</b> the <b>animal. Just as there,</b> in the case of the animal, it is referring to deriving benefit from <b>its body, so too here,</b> it must be referring to benefit from <b>her body</b> itself, not from a wig.

### Part 10
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman</b> bar Yitzḥak <b>says:</b> The mishna is referring to natural hair, and there is a distinction between the hair of an animal and that of a woman. In the case of <b>this</b> woman, it is <b>her death</b> that <b>causes her to be forbidden.</b> Therefore, the hair, which does not undergo any change when she dies, remains permitted. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>that</b> animal, the <b>verdict causes it to be forbidden,</b> even before it is killed. It is prohibited to derive benefit from the animal as soon as the verdict is issued. Therefore, the hair that is attached to the animal is forbidden as well.

### Part 11
<b>Levi teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav,</b> and <b>Levi</b> also <b>teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Levi teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav:</b> In the case of <b>a woman who was being taken to be killed and</b> who <b>said: Give my hair to my daughter, one gives</b> it to the daughter. If she <b>died</b> without instructing that it be given to her daughter, <b>one does not give</b> it to the daughter, <b>because</b> it <b>is forbidden to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from <b>a corpse.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that this is the reason her hair is prohibited? The Gemara explains that this is referring not to the hair itself, but <b>rather</b> to a wig, and the <i>baraita</i> is teaching that it is <b>forbidden to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> even from the <b>adornments</b> of <b>the deceased,</b> such as a wig.

### Part 13
The Gemara further explains: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak,</b> as follows: Whereas in the case of <b>a woman who died, one may derive benefit from her hair,</b> with regard to <b>an animal that was put to death, it is forbidden to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it. <b>And what is the difference between this</b> case <b>and that</b> one? In <b>this</b> case it is <b>her death</b> that <b>causes her to be forbidden, but</b> in <b>that</b> case the <b>verdict causes</b> the animal <b>to be forbidden.</b>
