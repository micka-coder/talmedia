### Part 1
§ The Gemara notes that there is an apparent contradiction with regard to the issue of whether or not a gentile may donate for the purpose of Temple maintenance. <b>It was taught in one</b> <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a gentile who pledged a gift for Temple maintenance, one accepts</b> it <b>from him. And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One does not accept</b> it from him.

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Ila says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that the donation is not accepted, is stated <b>with regard to the beginning</b> of the building of the Temple. The donation is refused in order that the Jews not rely upon on the donations of gentiles. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that the donation is accepted, is stated <b>with regard to the end</b> of the building of the Temple, i.e., after it is already built.

### Part 3
<b>As Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> with regard to donations of gentiles for Temple maintenance: <b>With regard to the beginning</b> of the building of the Temple, <b>one may not accept even water and salt from them. With regard to the end</b> of the building of the Temple, <b>one may not accept a defined item,</b> i.e., if it will be clear that this was donated by a gentile. But <b>one may accept</b> their gift of <b>an item that is not defined.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is considered</b> to be <b>a defined item? Rav Yosef says: For example, the cubit-</b>wide spiked plates placed on the roof of the Sanctuary, which were designed to <b>eliminate the ravens.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Rav Yosef raises an objection</b> to the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> as interpreted by Rabbi Yoḥanan, that with regard to the beginning of the building of the Temple nothing is accepted from gentiles. Nehemiah requested from the king of Persia: <b>“And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s park,</b> that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle that pertains to the house” (Nehemiah 2:8). Here Nehemiah clearly asked for material from gentiles. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: Actions taken by <b>the government are different, as</b> the government <b>does not retract</b> its decisions. <b>As Shmuel says: If the government says: I will uproot mountains, it will uproot mountains and not retract</b> what it said.

### Part 5
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile who separated <i>teruma</i> from his pile</b> of grain, <b>one examines him</b> to determine his intent. <b>If he separated it with</b> the <b>intent</b> that it be like the <i>teruma</i> of <b>Jews, it should be given to a priest. If not, it requires interment,</b> as <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps his heart was</b> directed <b>toward Heaven,</b> i.e., his intent was to consecrate it to the Temple and he did not want it to be given to a priest. Since there is uncertainty with regard to his intent, nothing can be done with that produce.

### Part 6
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a gentile who donated a</b> cross <b>beam</b> and brought it to a synagogue, <b>and</b> the <b>name</b> of God <b>is written on it, one examines him</b> to determine his intent. <b>If he says: I separated it with</b> the <b>intent</b> that it be like the donations of <b>Jews,</b> the name should be <b>cut off [<i>yagod</i>]</b> and interred, <b>and one uses the remainder</b> for a synagogue. <b>And if not,</b> the entire beam <b>requires interment,</b> as <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps his heart was</b> directed <b>toward Heaven,</b> i.e., his intent was to consecrate it to the Temple, and therefore it may not be used.

### Part 7
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: The <b>reason that</b> the beam <b>requires interment</b> is <b>that</b> the <b>name</b> of God <b>is written on it,</b> from which it may be inferred that if God’s <b>name</b> is <b>not written on it,</b> it <b>does not require interment.</b> Why, then, did Rav Yehuda say that if a gentile separated <i>teruma</i> it requires interment?

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>Even though</b> the <b>name</b> of God is <b>not written on</b> the beam, <b>the same</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is true,</b> and the beam <b>requires interment,</b> due to the concern that he might have intended to consecrate it. <b>And</b> as for why the <i>baraita</i> specifically discusses the case where God’s name was written on the beam, <b>this teaches us that</b> if his intention was for it to be used in a synagogue, then <b>even though</b> God’s <b>name is written on it,</b> nevertheless the rest of the beam is not prohibited. Rather, the name should be <b>cut off</b> and interred, <b>and</b> one may <b>use the remainder</b> for a synagogue. The reason is <b>that</b> if God’s <b>name</b> is written on an item, only the place where it is written is sanctified, but that part of the item <b>that is not in its place is not sanctified.</b>

### Part 9
<b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one of the names of God <b>was written on the handles of vessels or on legs of a bed, one must cut off</b> the name <b>and inter</b> it, and the remainder is permitted.

### Part 10
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Abbahu says: One who says:</b> I am contributing <b>this <i>sela</i> to charity, is permitted to change its</b> purpose, i.e., to use the money himself and later replace it. The Gemara comments: It was initially <b>understood from this</b> that if one wants to change its purpose <b>for his own</b> benefit, <b>yes,</b> this is permitted, as he originally had this stipulation in mind. But it is <b>not</b> permitted to lend it <b>to another.</b> Yet it <b>was stated</b> that <b>Rav Ami says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is permitted to change its purpose <b>whether for himself or for another.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Zeira says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that one may change the purpose of the coin, only in a case <b>where he said: It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate a <i>sela</i> to charity. <b>But</b> if he <b>said: This</b> <i>sela</i> <b>is</b> for charity, then he is <b>required to give</b> the <i>sela</i> to charity <b>as is,</b> and he may not use it and replace it.

### Part 12
<b>Rava objects to this: On the contrary, the opposite is</b> more <b>reasonable.</b> In a case where one <b>said: This</b> <i>sela</i> is for charity, it makes sense to allow him to <b>use it, so that he should bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for its</b> loss from that point onward. <b>But</b> if he said: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate a <i>sela</i> to charity, he should <b>not</b> be allowed to use the <i>sela</i>, as in any event he must donate a <i>sela</i>. <b>Rather,</b> as there is a reason in either situation to permit its use, there <b>is no difference</b> between the cases, and in both cases he may use the <i>sela</i>.

### Part 13
The Gemara notes that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava: A vow</b> is <b>charity, but consecrated</b> property <b>is not charity.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>saying?</b> After all, <b>neither a vow nor consecrated</b> property <b>is charity.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> correct that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Charity</b> is like a vow to consecrate property, in that it <b>is</b> subject to the prohibition <b>of: You shall not delay,</b> which is derived from the verse: “When you shall vow a vow to the Lord your God, you shall not delay to pay it” (Deuteronomy 23:22). <b>But</b> nevertheless <b>it is not like consecrated</b> property, <b>as</b> in the case of <b>consecrated</b> property it is <b>prohibited to use it, while</b> in the case of <b>charity</b> it is <b>permitted to use it.</b> Since with regard to the option of using the money the <i>baraita</i> does not distinguish between a case where one says: It is incumbent upon me to donate a <i>sela</i> to charity, and a case where he says: This <i>sela</i> is for charity, it evidently supports the opinion of Rava.

### Part 15
<b>Rav Kahana said: I said</b> this <b><i>halakha</i></b> of Rav Naḥman’s, with regard to one who says: This <i>sela</i> is for charity, along with the accompanying discussion, <b>before Rav Zevid from Neharde’a. He said</b> to me: <b>You teach this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>in this manner,</b> that Rav Naḥman merely stated that it is permitted to change the purpose of the <i>sela</i>, and the Sages clarified that it is permitted in all cases. But <b>we teach this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>in this manner,</b> that it was all stated citing Rav Naḥman: <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> that <b>Rav says: One who said:</b> I am contributing <b>this <i>sela</i> to charity, is permitted to change its</b> purpose, <b>whether for himself or for another,</b> and <b>whether</b> he <b>said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me,</b> or <b>whether he said: This</b> <i>sela</i> <b>is</b> for charity.

### Part 16
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> which further deals with these matters. One who said: <b>This <i>sela</i> is for charity,</b> is <b>permitted to change</b> its purpose and replace it, as long as it has <b>not</b> yet <b>come into the possession</b> of the <b>charity collectors.</b> But <b>once it has come into the possession</b> of the <b>charity collectors</b> it is <b>prohibited to change</b> its purpose.
