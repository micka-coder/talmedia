### Part 1
Rather, the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> stated: <b>With regard to the male and with regard to the female,</b> which are the terms the Torah uses with regard to valuations. The terms son and daughter are used in <i>Yotze Dofen</i>.

### Part 2
With regard to valuations, the Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> with regard to <b>a female, that when she ages</b> past sixty years she <b>stands at</b> a valuation of ten shekels, <b>one-third</b> of her previous valuation of thirty shekels, <b>and what is different</b> with regard to <b>a male, that</b> when he ages past sixty, at which point he has a valuation of fifteen shekels, he does not <b>stand at</b> even <b>one-third</b> of his previous valuation of fifty shekels? <b>Ḥizkiya said</b> that <b>people say</b> a popular saying: If there is <b>an elderly man in the home,</b> there is <b>a burden [<i>paḥa</i>] in the home,</b> as he does not help with anything; if there is <b>an elderly woman in the home,</b> there is <b>a treasure in the home,</b>as she assists with various domestic labors.
