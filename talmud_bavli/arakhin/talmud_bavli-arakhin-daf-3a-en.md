### Part 1
<b>what?</b> The Gemara answers: They serve <b>to add women, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Women are obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>reading</b> the <b>Megilla, as they too were</b> participants <b>in that miracle.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is obligated to form a <i>zimmun</i></b> and recite Grace after Meals as a group? The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> serves <b>to add women and slaves. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Women form a <i>zimmun</i> for themselves and slaves form a <i>zimmun</i> for themselves.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara further inquires: <b>What is added</b> by the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is included in a <i>zimmun</i>?</b> This serves <b>to add a minor who knows to Whom</b> one <b>recites a blessing. As Rav Naḥman says:</b> A minor who <b>knows to Whom</b> one <b>recites a blessing is included in a <i>zimmun</i>.</b>

### Part 4
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the clause in the mishna (<i>Zavim</i> 2:1): <b>Everyone becomes impure by</b> means of <b>a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>ziva</i>]?</b> This serves <b>to add</b> that even <b>a day-old baby</b> who has such a discharge becomes impure. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It would have been sufficient for the verse to state: <b>A man. Why</b> does <b>the verse state:</b> “When <b>any man</b> has an issue out of his flesh, his issue is impure” (Leviticus 15:2)? This serves <b>to include a day-old baby</b> who has such a discharge, to teach <b>that</b> even <b>he becomes impure as</b> one who experiences <b><i>ziva</i>.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says</b> that this amplification <b>is not necessary,</b> as the verse <b>states: “And of them that have an issue, whether it be a male or a female”</b> (Leviticus 15:33). <b>“A male”</b> includes <b>anyone who is male, whether a small child or an adult; “a female”</b> includes <b>anyone who is female, whether a small child or an adult. If so, why</b> does <b>the verse state: “Any man”? The Torah spoke in the language of men,</b> i.e., this is a normal way to phrase the sentence, and therefore one should not derive a <i>halakha</i> from the extra word.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone becomes impure with impurity</b> imparted by <b>a corpse?</b> The <i>baraita</i> teaches it <b>to add a minor.</b> The Gemara elaborates: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since the verse states: “But the <b>man that shall be impure and shall not purify himself”</b> (Numbers 19:20), one should derive from here that <b>a man,</b> i.e., an adult, <b>yes,</b> he becomes impure, but <b>a minor</b> does <b>not.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> in the context of purification with purification water from impurity imparted by a corpse: “And sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, <b>and upon the persons that were there”</b> (Numbers 19:18). This indicates that all persons who were there became impure, regardless of age.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what</b> does the term “the <b>man”</b> serve <b>to exclude?</b> The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to exclude a minor from excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>],</b> which is mentioned in that verse: “That soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the Sanctuary of the Lord” (Numbers 19:20). In other words, the term “the man” serves to teach that if a minor becomes impure and then enters the Temple, he is not liable to receive <i>karet</i>.

### Part 8
The Gemara further asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 3:1): <b>Everyone becomes impure by</b> means of <b>leprous marks?</b> The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to add a minor.</b> As it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>it is written</b> in the verse: “He is <b>a leprous man,</b> he is impure” (Leviticus 13:44), this is teaching that <b>a man,</b> i.e., an adult, <b>yes,</b> he does become impure, but <b>a minor</b> does <b>not.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that a minor becomes impure by means of leprous marks.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say that</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>indeed so,</b> that a minor does not become impure by means of leprous marks? The Gemara answers that the verse states: <b>“When a person shall have in the skin of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 13:2), to include all people, <b>in any case,</b> irrespective of age.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in that case, <b>why do I</b> need the term: “He is a leprous <b>man”</b> (Leviticus 13:44)? The Gemara answers: It comes <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the phrase “he is a leprous <b>man” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> a leprous <b>man. From where</b> is it derived that leprous marks also render <b>a woman</b> impure? <b>When</b> the subsequent verse <b>states: “And the leper</b> in whom the affliction is” (Leviticus 13:45), <b>there are two</b> individuals indicated <b>here,</b> male and female, as this verse did not need to restate: “And the leper,” since the subject of this clause was clear from the previous verse.

### Part 11
<b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “A leprous <b>man”?</b> This is referring <b>to the matter of</b> the leper rending his clothes and letting his hair grow wild, which is stated in the verse <b>below:</b> “His clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose” (Leviticus 13:45). The verse therefore teaches that <b>a man</b> who is a leper <b>lets</b> his hair <b>grow and rends</b> his garments, <b>but a woman</b> who is a leper <b>does not let</b> her hair <b>grow and</b> does not <b>rend</b> her garments.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone may inspect leprous marks</b> in order to declare them pure or impure, and the clause of another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Everyone is fit to inspect leprous marks</b> in order to declare them pure or impure. The Gemara answers: These statements serve <b>to add</b> a priest who <b>is not expert in</b> distinguishing between <b>them,</b> the different types of leprous marks, <b>and in</b> identifying <b>their names.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t the Master say</b> that any priest who is <b>not expert in</b> distinguishing between <b>them and in</b> identifying <b>their names is not</b> authorized to <b>inspect the leprous marks</b> and make a decision with regard to them? <b>Ravina said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement, that the priest is fit, is referring to a situation <b>where</b> if <b>they explain to him he understands;</b> whereas <b>that</b> statement, that he is not fit, is referring to a case <b>where</b> even if <b>they explain to him he</b> still <b>does not understand.</b>

### Part 14
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of the mishna (<i>Para</i> 5:4): <b>Everyone</b> is <b>fit to sanctify</b> the ashes of the red heifer, i.e., to pour the water over them? The Gemara answers that <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda</b> the statement serves <b>to add a minor, and according to the Rabbis,</b> who disqualify a minor, it serves <b>to add a woman. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 5:4): <b>Everyone is fit to sanctify</b> the ashes of the red heifer <b>except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor. Rabbi Yehuda deems a minor fit, but deems a woman and a hermaphrodite,</b> who has both male and female characteristics, <b>unfit.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of the mishna (<i>Para</i> 12:10): <b>Everyone is qualified to sprinkle</b> the purification waters on one who is ritually impure with impurity imparted by a corpse? The Gemara answers that this serves <b>to add one who is uncircumcised. And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar says:</b> If <b>one who is uncircumcised sprinkled</b> the purification water, <b>his sprinkling is valid.</b>

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the ruling of the mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 2a, 15b): <b>Everyone slaughters?</b> The Gemara explains that the mishna teaches this <b>once to add a Samaritan</b> who slaughters, i.e., his slaughter is valid. <b>And</b> the <b>one</b> other mention of this serves <b>to add a Jew</b> who is <b>an apostate [<i>meshummad</i>].</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara further asks: <b>What is added</b> by the statement of the mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 110b): <b>Everyone</b> can force others <b>to ascend to Eretz Yisrael,</b> i.e., one can compel his family and household to immigrate to Eretz Yisrael?
