### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who purchases the fetus of a donkey that belongs to a gentile, and one who sells</b> the fetus of his donkey <b>to</b> a gentile <b>although he is not permitted</b> to sell a large animal to a gentile, and <b>one who enters into a partnership with</b> a gentile in ownership of a donkey or its fetus, <b>and one who receives</b> a donkey <b>from</b> a gentile in order to care for it in exchange for partnership in its offspring, <b>and one who gives</b> his donkey <b>to</b> a gentile <b>in receivership,</b> in all of these cases the donkeys are <b>exempt from the</b> obligations of <b>firstborn status,</b> i.e., they do not have firstborn status and are not redeemed, <b>as it is stated:</b> “I sanctified to Me all the firstborn <b>in Israel,</b> both man and animal” (Numbers 3:13), indicating that the mitzva is incumbent upon the Jewish people, <b>but not upon others.</b> If the firstborn belongs even partially to a gentile, it does not have firstborn status.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>all these</b> examples in the mishna to demonstrate the principle that a firstborn donkey must belong exclusively to a Jew for the obligations of firstborn status to apply?

### Part 3
The Gemara explains: All of these examples <b>are necessary. As, had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> that a donkey is exempt from the obligations of firstborn status only in the case where a Jew <b>purchases</b> a fetus from a gentile, <b>I would say</b> that this is <b>because</b> the Jew <b>brings it to</b> a state of <b>sanctity</b> in that it will not be worked on Shabbat. <b>But</b> in the case where a Jew <b>sells</b> the fetus of his donkey to a gentile, <b>where he abrogates</b> its state of <b>sanctity,</b> I would <b>say</b> that the Sages <b>should penalize him [<i>likneseih</i>]</b> for his actions by rendering the fetus subject to the obligations of firstborn status. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that it is exempt from these obligations.

### Part 4
<b>And why do I</b> need the mishna to state the case of <b>one who enters into a partnership with</b> a gentile? The case is necessary <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, who says:</b> An animal owned in <b>partnership</b> with <b>a gentile is obligated,</b> i.e., subject to accounting its offspring <b>a firstborn.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us that</b> it <b>is exempt from</b> its offspring being counted <b>a firstborn.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And why do I</b> need the mishna to state that the fetus does not have firstborn status in the case of <b>one who receives</b> a donkey from a gentile in exchange for partnership in its offspring? This <i>halakha</i> is already included in the previous one. The Gemara answers: It is <b>because</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>wants to teach</b> in the parallel case of: <b>And one who gives</b> his donkey <b>to</b> a gentile <b>in receivership,</b> that its offspring does not have firstborn status.

### Part 6
<b>And why do I</b> need the case of <b>one who gives</b> his donkey <b>to</b> a gentile <b>in receivership</b> to be stated? It <b>was necessary,</b> because it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since the primary animal belongs to the Jew,</b> the Sages <b>should penalize him</b> by treating the offspring as a firstborn and requiring it to be redeemed, <b>lest</b> this case <b>be confused with another</b> case of an <b>animal</b> that the Jew puts in the care of a gentile where the gentile does not own rights to the offspring, and the offspring is counted a firstborn. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that he is not penalized.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara cites a discussion where the mishna is used as a proof: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Avoda Zara</i> 14b) with regard to the prohibition against selling large livestock to a gentile due to concern that it will be worked on Shabbat: <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the sale <b>of a damaged</b> animal <b>permitted</b> because it is incapable of performing labor, <b>and ben Beteira deems</b> the sale <b>of a horse</b> for riding <b>permitted,</b> because riding a horse on Shabbat is not prohibited by Torah law.

### Part 8
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>a fetus, what</b> would <b>Rabbi Yehuda say to me</b> about selling it to a gentile? Is the <b>reason that Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> selling the animal <b>permitted there because</b> it is <b>damaged</b> and it cannot work, <b>and a fetus is also damaged</b> in the sense that it cannot work? <b>Or, perhaps</b> it is permitted to sell <b>a damaged</b> animal because <b>that is not its natural</b> state; it is defective and is therefore not included in the prohibition against selling large livestock. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a fetus, since that is its natural</b> state, and it will become capable of working after growing up, perhaps it <b>is not</b> considered <b>damaged,</b> as it is not defective.

### Part 9
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from the mishna: <b>And one who sells</b> the fetus of his donkey <b>to</b> a gentile, his donkey is exempt from the obligations of firstborn status, <b>although</b> the owner <b>is not permitted</b> to do so. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda does not disagree</b> and claim that he may sell it. Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda agrees that it is prohibited to sell the fetus of one’s animal to a gentile.

### Part 10
The Gemara rejects the resolution: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> concerning the other cases in the mishna, namely, <b>one who enters into a partnership with</b> a gentile, <b>and one who receives</b> a donkey <b>from</b> a gentile in exchange for partnership in its offspring, <b>and one who gives</b> his donkey <b>to</b> a gentile <b>in receivership,</b> with regard to <b>which</b> the mishna <b>does not teach</b> that Rabbi Yehuda disagrees, <b>so too</b> does this indicate <b>that he does not disagree</b> with the ruling in the mishna in these cases? That is impossible, as Rabbi Yehuda holds that an animal subject to a partnership between a Jew and gentile is subject to accounting its offspring a firstborn, as is evident from a <i>baraita</i> that will soon be cited.

### Part 11
<b>Rather,</b> clearly Rabbi Yehuda <b>does disagree, but</b> the mishna <b>does not teach</b> his opinion. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to selling the fetus, <b>he disagrees, but</b> the mishna <b>does not teach</b> his opinion.

### Part 12
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that in the case of <b>one who receives an animal from a gentile</b> in order to care for it and receives some of the offspring in exchange for his work, <b>and it gave birth</b> to a firstborn, <b>they assess its value, and</b> the Jew <b>gives half of its value to the priest</b> to redeem his portion, which is sanctified by the firstborn status. <b>And</b> in the case of <b>one who gives</b> the gentile an animal <b>in receivership even though he is not permitted</b> to do so, the Sages <b>penalize him</b> by requiring that he purchase the gentile’s portion of the animal for <b>up to ten</b> times <b>its value, and he gives all of its value to the priest.</b>
