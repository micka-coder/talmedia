<b>fat of the</b> kidney adjacent to the <b>thigh,</b> which is forbidden, in place <b>of fat of the intestines,</b> which is permitted. <b>Rava penalized him</b> and prohibited him <b>even from selling nuts. Rav Pappa said to Rava: In accordance with</b> which opinion in the mishna is your ruling? It must be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. If it is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> then you should prohibit this butcher from selling <b>even water and salt.</b>

### Part 2
Rava replied: <b>Actually,</b> my ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that one is suspected only about those items that are related to the prohibition in question. <b>And we are</b> in fact <b>penalizing him with regard to</b> items related to <b>the prohibition itself.</b> How so? <b>Ordinary children are enticed by nuts, and</b> that individual <b>went and misled the children of butchers and enticed them with nuts, and they brought him fat of the</b> kidney that is adjacent to the <b>thigh, and he sold it as</b> though it were <b>fat of the intestines.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who is suspect with regard to the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>is not suspect with regard to tithes;</b> and likewise, <b>one who is suspect with regard to tithes is not suspect with regard to the Sabbatical</b> Year. <b>One who is suspect with regard to this,</b> the Sabbatical Year, <b>or with regard to that,</b> tithes, is <b>suspect with regard to</b> selling ritually impure foods as though they were <b>ritually pure</b> items. <b>But there are those who are suspect with regard to ritually pure</b> items <b>who are not suspect with regard to this,</b> the Sabbatical Year, <b>nor with regard to that,</b> tithes. <b>This is the principle</b> with regard to these matters: Anyone <b>who is suspect with regard to</b> a specific <b>matter</b> may <b>neither adjudicate</b> cases <b>nor testify</b> in cases involving that matter.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who is suspect with regard to the Sabbatical Year is not suspect with regard to tithes. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> One is <b>not required</b> to eat produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year within the <b>wall</b> of Jerusalem, and therefore he treats it lightly. As for second <b>tithe, since</b> one is <b>required</b> to eat it only within the <b>wall</b> of Jerusalem, it is possible that it seems more <b>stringent for him,</b> and therefore he is not suspect, despite the suspicions with regard to produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year.

### Part 5
The mishna teaches: <b>One who is suspect with regard to tithe</b> is not suspect with regard to the Sabbatical Year. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> The Gemara answers: Since <b>there is redemption</b> for <b>tithes,</b> one might treat them lightly. As for produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>since it is</b> always <b>prohibited to him and there is no redemption</b> of it, it is possible that it seems more <b>stringent for him,</b> and therefore he is not suspect.

### Part 6
The mishna teaches: <b>One who is suspect with regard to this,</b> the Sabbatical Year, <b>or with regard to that,</b> tithes, is suspect with regard to selling ritually impure foods as though they were ritually pure items. The Gemara explains: <b>Since he is suspect</b> with regard to matters that apply <b>by Torah law, all the more so that he</b> is suspect with regard to matters that are <b>by rabbinic law.</b> Eating non-sacred food in a state of ritual purity is an ordinance of the Sages; it does not apply by Torah law. Consequently, he is certainly not trusted with regard to that matter.

### Part 7
The mishna teaches: <b>But there are those who are suspect with regard to ritually pure</b> items who are not suspect with regard to this, the Sabbatical Year, or with regard to that, tithes. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? Granted,</b> he is <b>suspect</b> with regard to prohibitions that are <b>by rabbinic law,</b> but <b>he is not suspect</b> with regard to prohibitions that are <b>by Torah law. And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If one is <b>trusted with regard to ritually pure</b> items he is <b>trusted with regard to</b> produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year. It can be inferred from here that if he is <b>suspect</b> with regard to ritually pure items he is likewise <b>suspect</b> with regard to produce of the Sabbatical Year.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Ilai says: The mishna</b> is referring to a case <b>where they saw him practicing</b> stringencies with regard to produce of the Sabbatical Year and tithes <b>privately, within his home.</b> Since he himself is known to be trustworthy in these matters in private, he is not suspected of violating these prohibitions in his business, despite his lack of trustworthiness with regard to ritual purity.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Yannai, son of Rabbi Yishmael, said</b> that there is an alternative answer: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where one was suspect with regard to both</b> ritually pure items and produce of the Sabbatical Year, <b>and he came before the Sages and accepted</b> upon himself <b>that</b> he would observe <b>both of them, and afterward he was suspected with regard to one of them.</b> The reason for the <i>halakha</i> here is <b>that we say: Since he is suspect with regard to this</b> one of them, <b>he is also suspect with regard to the other</b> one. Although one of the prohibitions is more stringent than the other, the court has seen that he cannot be trusted to keep his word about either of them.

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches: One who is suspect with regard to the Sabbatical Year is not suspect with regard to tithes. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is the statement of Rabbi Akiva, the unattributed.</b> Most unattributed statements of <i>tanna’im</i> were formulated by Rabbi Akiva’s students and reflect his opinions. <b>But the Rabbis say:</b> One who is <b>suspect with regard to</b> produce of <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>is suspect with regard to tithe.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> are the Sages referred to here as <b>the Rabbis?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as in Rabbi Yehuda’s locale they</b> considered produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year an especially <b>stringent</b> prohibition. Therefore, if a resident of that place was suspect with regard to the Sabbatical Year, he was certainly not trusted with regard to tithes. <b>As</b> in that locale, if <b>a certain</b> person <b>would call another: A convert, son of</b> a female <b>convert,</b> wishing to insult him, that person would <b>say to him</b> in reply: <b>I have</b> a blessing <b>coming to me, as I do not eat produce of the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>like you</b> do. This indicates that the accusation of eating produce of the Sabbatical Year was a great insult, since they treated the Sabbatical Year stringently.

### Part 12
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is the statement of Rabbi Akiva, the unattributed. But the Rabbis say:</b> One who is <b>suspect with regard to tithe is suspect with regard to</b> produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year. <b>And who</b> are the Sages referred to here as <b>the Rabbis? It is Rabbi Meir, who says:</b> One who is <b>suspect with regard to one matter is suspect with regard to the entire Torah.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yona and Rabbi Yirmeya,</b> who were <b>students of Rabbi Zeira,</b> disagreed about this matter. <b>And some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Yona and Rabbi Zeira, students of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who disagreed. <b>One said: But the Rabbis say</b> that one who is <b>suspect with regard to</b> produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year
