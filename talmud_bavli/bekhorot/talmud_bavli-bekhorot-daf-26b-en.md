### Part 1
<b>being brought for atonement</b> is <b>not</b> its <b>primary</b> function, there is a concern that <b>one</b> might <b>keep it? Or perhaps, since a burnt offering also effects atonement for</b> neglecting to perform <b>a positive</b> mitzva, <b>one does not keep</b> the animal longer than necessary.

### Part 2
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who plucks the wool from an unblemished firstborn, even though it</b> later <b>developed a blemish</b> and the owner then <b>slaughtered it,</b> use of the wool is <b>prohibited.</b> The Gemara infers: The <b>reason</b> use of the wool is prohibited is <b>because he plucks</b> it. <b>But</b> if <b>it was torn out</b> not by human intervention it is <b>permitted. And</b> this is correct <b>all the more so</b> with regard to <b>a burnt offering, where one does not keep</b> the animal any longer than necessary.

### Part 3
The Gemara rejects this proof: Actually, <b>the same is true even</b> if the wool of an unblemished firstborn animal <b>was torn out</b> by some other means; it is <b>also prohibited. And</b> the reason <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> using the term: One who <b>plucks, is to convey to you the far-reaching</b> nature of the opinion <b>of Akavya</b> ben Mahalalel, <b>as</b> he maintains that in the case of <b>a blemished</b> animal, discussed in the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>even</b> if <b>one plucks</b> the wool it is <b>permitted.</b> Since the latter clause discusses a case where one plucked the wool himself, it is inferred that the former clause discusses the same situation.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that the hair <b>was shed</b> rather than plucked? The Gemara explains that the mishna <b>taught</b> a case where the hair of the blemished animal <b>was shed</b> in order <b>to convey to you the far-reaching</b> nature of the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> who deem the wool prohibited even in such a case. Conversely, the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> a case where <b>one plucks</b> the hair in order <b>to convey to you the far-reaching</b> nature of the opinion of <b>Akavya.</b>

### Part 5
§ The mishna teaches that it is permitted to derive benefit from <b>wool that is dangling</b> from a firstborn but was not completely shed if it appears to be part of the fleece when the animal is shorn after death, but otherwise it is prohibited. The Gemara inquires: <b>What is considered: That which does not appear</b> to be part <b>of the fleece? Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> This includes <b>any</b> strand of wool <b>whose root is overturned</b> and is facing <b>toward the top,</b> i.e., outward. <b>Rav Natan bar Oshaya says:</b> This includes <b>any</b> strand of wool <b>that is not compressed</b> together <b>with</b> the rest of <b>the fleece,</b> i.e., it sticks out when the fleece is pressed down.

### Part 6
<b>And what is the reason Reish Lakish did not state</b> his explanation <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Natan bar Oshaya,</b> whose explanation is the more straightforward meaning of the phrase: That which does not appear to be part of the fleece? <b>Rabbi Ile’a says: Reish Lakish holds</b> that the Sages did not deem strands of wool that are not compressed together with the rest of the fleece prohibited, <b>because it is impossible for</b> there to be <b>fleece without dangling hairs.</b> If Rav Natan bar Oshaya’s explanation were accepted, it would never be permitted to use such fleece of a dead firstborn animal. Consequently, Reish Lakish explains the statement of the mishna in a more lenient manner.
