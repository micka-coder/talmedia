### Part 1
<b>And neither does a woman</b> take these portions, i.e., any enhancement of the value of the property or the property due the husband, from her husband’s property <b>for</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract</b> upon her divorce or her husband’s death; <b>nor</b> do <b>the daughters</b> take this share of the property <b>for their sustenance,</b> to which they are entitled from their late father’s possessions. <b>Nor</b> does <b>a man whose married brother died childless [<i>yavam</i>]</b> receive these portions, even though he acquires his brother’s portion of their shared father’s inheritance after performing levirate marriage with his brother’s wife. The mishna summarizes: <b>And all of them do not take</b> a portion <b>in</b> any <b>enhancement</b> of the value of the property after the death of the owner, <b>nor</b> do they take a portion <b>in</b> property <b>due</b> the deceased, <b>as</b> they do in property <b>in</b> his <b>possession.</b>

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the firstborn son does not receive a double portion when inheriting the property of his mother. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states: “The law of primogeniture is his”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17); this is understood to mean that there is <b>a law of primogeniture for a man,</b> i.e., a duty to bequeath a double portion to his firstborn son, <b>and there is no law of primogeniture for a woman.</b>

### Part 3
The mishna teaches further: <b>And neither does he take</b> twice the portion <b>in</b> any <b>enhancement</b> of the value of the property after the death of his father. The Gemara explains that this is <b>because it is written:</b> “A double portion <b>of all that he has”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), and this enhancement was not in his father’s possession at the time of his death. The mishna also teaches: <b>Nor</b> does he take twice the portion in property <b>due</b> the father, <b>as</b> he does in the property <b>in possession</b> of the father. The Gemara explains that this too is <b>because it is written: “Of all that he has”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), and property due the father is not in his possession.

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And neither does a woman</b> take any enhancement of the value of the property or the property due the husband, from her husband’s property <b>for</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Shmuel say a creditor collects</b> the value of <b>the enhancement</b> of the field of a borrower after the latter’s death? Since a wife’s marriage contract is like a promissory note, she is considered a creditor. <b>Rabbi Abba says:</b> The Sages <b>taught here</b> one <b>of the leniencies</b> for the husband that apply to <b>a marriage contract:</b> That a woman does not collect the value of the enhancement despite the fact that she is a creditor.

### Part 5
The mishna teaches: <b>Nor</b> do <b>the daughters</b> take this share of the property <b>for their sustenance,</b> to which they are entitled from their late father’s possessions. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara explains that <b>a stipulation in the marriage contract,</b> such as that the daughters are entitled to sustenance from the father’s property after his death, <b>is comparable to the marriage contract</b> itself, and therefore they cannot claim that which cannot be claimed from a marriage contract, i.e., an enhancement to the father’s property.

### Part 6
The mishna teaches: <b>Nor</b> does <b>the <i>yavam</i></b> receive these portions. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers that <b>the Merciful One calls</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>a firstborn,</b> in the verse: “And it shall be, the firstborn” (Deuteronomy 25:6). <b>Abaye says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only with regard to an enhancement by</b> which <b>the property</b> was <b>enhanced between the death</b> of the brother <b>and the levirate marriage. But</b> concerning the enhancement <b>that</b> occurs <b>between the levirate marriage and the distribution</b> of the inheritance, <b>he does take</b> it. <b>What is the reason? The Merciful One states: “Shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:6), <b>and</b> by that stage <b>he has succeeded</b> him, and the enhancement occurred at that stage.

### Part 7
<b>Rava says: Even with regard to</b> the enhancement that occurs <b>between the levirate marriage and the distribution</b> of the inheritance, the <i>yavam</i> <b>does not take</b> it. <b>What is the reason?</b> He is compared <b>to a firstborn: Just as a firstborn does not have</b> any special right to the inheritance <b>before</b> its <b>distribution, so too, a <i>yavam</i> does not have</b> any right to the inheritance <b>before</b> its <b>distribution.</b>

### Part 8
The mishna teaches: <b>And all of them do not take</b> a portion <b>in</b> any <b>enhancement.</b>
