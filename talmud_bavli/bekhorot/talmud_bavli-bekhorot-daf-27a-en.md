### Part 1
the <b>benefit of discretion for the owners</b> of the produce, i.e., benefit accrued from the option of giving <i>teruma</i> and tithes to any priest or Levite of their choosing.

### Part 2
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>How so?</b> With regard to <b>an Israelite who separated <i>teruma</i> from his pile</b> of grain, <b>and another Israelite found him and said to him: Take this <i>sela</i></b> coin <b>for yourself and give</b> the <i>teruma</i> and tithes <b>to my daughter’s son</b> who is <b>a priest,</b> it is <b>permitted.</b> But <b>if it was a priest</b> who gave the <i>sela</i> coin for the right to give the <i>teruma</i> and tithes <b>to</b> another <b>priest,</b> it is <b>prohibited.</b> Priests may not pay for the gifts that they receive.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of this <i>baraita</i>, <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>he does not state</b> that the owners also have the benefit of discretion with regard to the <b>gifts of the priesthood,</b> i.e., the foreleg, jaw, and maw, which must be given to the priest from every non-sacred animal that one slaughters? Why does he mention <i>teruma</i> alone? The Gemara answers that <b>he</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> In the case of <b><i>teruma</i>, which has inherent sanctity,</b> and <b>which</b> therefore <b>cannot be redeemed,</b> the priest <b>will not come to err with it</b> and treat it as though it has no sanctity, even if the owner receives payment for it.

### Part 4
By contrast, with regard to <b>these</b> gifts of the priesthood, <b>since they have sanctity</b> that inheres in their <b>value,</b> which means that once the priest has received them he may sell them, the priest might <b>come to err with them</b> by saying <b>that</b> the <b>sanctity</b> that they have <b>can be redeemed with four <i>zuz</i>,</b> i.e., the one <i>sela</i>, <b>and</b> he might <b>come to treat them in the manner that</b> one treats <b>non-sacred</b> food. This would be a mistake, as a priest must eat his priestly gifts in a dignified manner, i.e., roasted and with seasoning (see <i>Ḥullin</i> 132b).

### Part 5
§ On a related topic, <b>Rava says: <i>Teruma</i> from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>does not have</b> any prohibition <b>due to a priest assisting at the threshing floor.</b> The Sages decreed that one must separate <i>teruma</i> from produce grown in certain places outside of Eretz Yisrael. Yet, the <i>halakhot</i> governing this <i>teruma</i> are not as stringent as those that apply to <i>teruma</i> from produce grown within Eretz Yisrael. Consequently, one may give such <i>teruma</i> to a priest for helping at the threshing floor. In support of this claim, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ḥama gave</b> <i>teruma</i> from outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>to his servant,</b> who was a priest, as his wages.

### Part 6
With regard to <i>teruma</i> from outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>Shmuel says: <i>Teruma</i> from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael that became mixed with non-sacred produce <b>is nullified in a majority,</b> unlike ordinary <i>teruma</i>, which requires one hundred parts of non-sacred produce to nullify it. The Gemara relates that <b>Rabba,</b> who was a priest, would <b>nullify</b> his <i>teruma</i> from outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>in a majority</b> <i>ab initio</i> <b>and eat it during his days of impurity.</b> Both of these acts are prohibited in the case of <i>teruma</i> from produce grown in Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, when he would happen</b> to have <b>wine of <i>teruma</i></b> from produce grown outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>would pour two jugs of non-sacred</b> wine <b>and one jug of <i>teruma</i></b> wine into a vat in order to nullify the <i>teruma</i> wine, <b>and</b> then <b>take out one</b> jug’s worth of wine to drink. Having done so, <b>from here onward</b> every time he received more <i>teruma</i> wine grown outside of Eretz Yisrael, he would <b>pour one</b> jug of <i>teruma</i> wine into the same vat, which still contained two jugs’ worth of wine, <b>and take out one</b> jug’s worth of wine.

### Part 8
<b>And Shmuel</b> further <b>says: <i>Teruma</i> from</b> produce grown <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael does not need to be separated before one eats the produce. Rather, one may <b>proceed to eat and afterward separate</b> the <i>teruma</i> from the remainder.

### Part 9
<b>And Shmuel</b> also <b>says: <i>Teruma</i> from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>is prohibited only</b> to a member of a priestly household <b>whose impurity comes from his body,</b> e.g., a man who experiences a seminal emission or a menstruating woman. It is not prohibited to a priest who came into contact with a corpse, an animal carcass, or the carcass of a creeping animal. <b>And this statement,</b> that such <i>teruma</i> is forbidden to one whose impurity comes from his body, applies only <b>with regard to eating</b> it. <b>But with regard to touching</b> <i>teruma</i> from outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Ravina says: Therefore, a menstruating woman,</b> whose impurity comes from her body, <b>may separate <i>ḥalla</i></b> from dough outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>and a minor priest,</b> who has never experienced a seminal emission and is therefore ritually pure, <b>may eat it. And if there is no minor priest</b> available, <b>she takes</b> the <i>ḥalla</i> <b>with the top of a skewer [<i>massa</i>] and throws it in the oven, and then separates another</b> piece from the dough as <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> not because it is necessary but <b>so that the</b> halakhic <b>category of <i>ḥalla</i> should not be forgotten. And an adult priest</b> may <b>eat it,</b> even if he is ritually impure.

### Part 11
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Naḥman, Rav Amram, and Rami bar Ḥama were traveling in a ferry. Rav Amram went to relieve himself. A certain woman came before</b> Rav Naḥman and Rami bar Ḥama and <b>said to them:</b> In the case of one who is <b>impure</b> through contact with <b>a corpse, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> whether <b>he may immerse</b> himself in a ritual bath <b>and partake of <i>teruma</i> from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael? <b>Rav Naḥman said to Rami bar Ḥama:</b>
