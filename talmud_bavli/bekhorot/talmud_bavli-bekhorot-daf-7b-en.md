### Part 1
<b>the non-kosher</b> animal [<i>min hattamei</i>], one can infer that any type [<i>min</i>] of non-kosher substance is included. <b>And these</b> fluids, i.e., the urine of a donkey, <b>are also a type of non-kosher</b> substance, as they resemble the milk of a donkey, which is forbidden.

### Part 2
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> there is a different version of the discussion about the urine of a donkey: With regard to the urine <b>of horses and camels,</b> the students of Rav Sheshet <b>did not raise the dilemma, because people do not drink</b> it. <b>When they raised the dilemma</b> it was with regard to the urine <b>of a donkey, which people drink and</b> which <b>is beneficial for</b> curing <b>jaundice. What,</b> then, is the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 3
<b>Rav Sheshet said to them: You learned</b> the answer to your dilemma in the mishna: <b>That which emerges from the non-kosher</b> animal <b>is non-kosher and that which emerges from the kosher</b> animal <b>is kosher, and these</b> fluids <b>also come from</b> a donkey, which is <b>non-kosher.</b> Therefore, they are forbidden.

### Part 4
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For what</b> reason did the Sages <b>say</b> that <b>the honey of bees is permitted?</b> It is <b>because they bring</b> the nectar from the flowers <b>into their body, but they do not excrete it from their body</b> as a bodily excretion. So too, the urine of a donkey is not an excretion produced by the body itself. Rather, it is simply ejected in the same form that it entered the body. Why, then, should it be forbidden?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: Rav Sheshet <b>stated</b> his answer <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov, who says</b> that with regard to <b>honey, the Merciful One permits it</b> as an exception to the principle that a substance that emerges from a non-kosher animal is non-kosher.

### Part 6
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that it is stated: <b>“Yet these may you eat of all winged creatures”</b> (Leviticus 11:21). The word “these” indicates that <b>you may eat these, but you may not eat a non-kosher winged creature.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: Why is this inference necessary? The prohibition against eating <b>a non-kosher winged creature is written explicitly:</b> “All winged creatures that go upon all fours are a repugnance to you” (Leviticus 11:20). <b>Rather,</b> the inference must be understood as follows: <b>You may not eat a non-kosher winged creature, but you may eat that which a non-kosher winged creature discharges</b> from its body, <b>and what is that? That is the honey of bees.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara cites the continuation of the <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even the honey of <i>gizzin</i> and wasps</b> should be permitted. Nevertheless, <b>you</b> should <b>say no.</b> The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And what did you see to include</b> the honey of <b>bees</b> as being permitted to eat <b>and to exclude</b> the honey of <b><i>gizzin</i> and wasps</b> as being forbidden? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>I include the honey of bees, as</b> its name <b>does not have a modifier,</b> i.e., the word honey alone always refers to the honey of bees. <b>And I exclude the honey of <i>gizzin</i> and wasps, which have a modifier,</b> i.e., one must always add the word <i>gizzin</i> or wasp to specify these particular types of honey.

### Part 9
The Gemara comments: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The honey of <i>gizzin</i> and wasps is not susceptible to ritual impurity and is permitted for consumption?</b> It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara infers from the expression: <b>Is not susceptible</b> to <b>ritual impurity,</b> that <b>apparently,</b> in order for the honey of <i>gizzin</i> and wasps to become susceptible to ritual impurity it <b>requires</b> specific <b>intention</b> to eat it, which renders it food. Furthermore, the <i>baraita</i> indicates that honey from bees does not require specific intention to eat it in order for it to become susceptible, because it is normally used for food. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>honey</b> of bees that is still <b>in its hive is susceptible</b> to <b>ritual impurity</b> as <b>food</b> even <b>without intent.</b>

### Part 11
§ The Gemara discusses additional cases of animal secretions. With regard to <b>chunks</b> that are discharged from the womb <b>of</b> a female <b>fallow deer, the Sages thought to say</b> that <b>they are</b> its <b>egg cells, and</b> therefore <b>are forbidden</b> as a limb severed from a living animal. <b>Rav Safra said: It is the semen of a hart, which pursues the hind, but since</b> the hind’s <b>womb is narrow it does not mate</b> with the hart, <b>and</b> instead the hart <b>pursues the</b> female <b>fallow deer</b> and mates with it, <b>and</b> chunks of its semen that have hardened <b>fall out</b> of the fallow deer’s body.

### Part 12
<b>Rav Huna says: The skin that emerges opposite the face of a donkey</b> when it is born, i.e., the fetal sac that envelopes it during birth, is <b>permitted</b> to be consumed. <b>What is the reason? It is merely a secretion,</b> and is not an integral part of the mother or the offspring.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to him:</b> That which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>supports your</b> opinion: <b>The skin that emerges opposite the face of a person,</b> i.e., a newborn baby, <b>whether</b> the newborn is <b>alive or dead,</b> is <b>ritually pure</b> and does not transmit ritual impurity imparted by a corpse. <b>What, is it not</b> the case that <b>whether it is alive and its mother is alive</b> or <b>whether it is dead and its mother is dead,</b> it is not considered a part of the body of the fetus or the mother, but merely a secretion, and therefore even when they are both dead it does not transmit impurity?

### Part 14
Rav Huna answered him: <b>No,</b> there is no proof from this <i>baraita</i>, as it may mean that <b>whether it is alive and its mother is dead</b> or <b>whether it is dead and its mother is alive,</b> meaning only one is alive, the skin is ritually pure. But if both are dead it is impure. Rav Ḥisda said to him: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>whether it is alive and its mother is alive</b> or <b>whether it is dead and its mother is dead,</b> the skin is pure? Rav Huna said to Rav Ḥisda: <b>If this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught, it is taught,</b> and I cannot dispute it.

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a non-kosher fish that swallowed a kosher fish, consumption</b> of the kosher fish is <b>permitted. And</b> in the case of <b>a kosher</b> fish <b>that swallowed a non-kosher fish, consumption</b> of the non-kosher fish is <b>prohibited due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the host fish <b>is not</b> the place of <b>its development.</b>

### Part 16
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the language of the mishna: In the case of a non-kosher fish that swallowed a kosher fish: <b>The reason</b> consumption of the kosher fish is permitted is <b>that we saw that</b> the non-kosher fish <b>swallowed</b> the kosher fish. <b>But</b> if <b>we did not see it swallow</b> the kosher fish <b>we say</b> that perhaps the non-kosher fish <b>spawned</b> the kosher fish, and it is forbidden.

### Part 17
<b>From where do we</b> derive that we must have this concern? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A non-kosher fish spawns</b> offspring, while <b>a kosher fish lays eggs</b> from which the offspring hatch. The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> even <b>when we saw it swallowing</b> a kosher fish <b>we</b> should <b>say</b> that <b>that</b> fish that it swallowed <b>was digested, and this</b> one, which was found inside of the non-kosher fish, it <b>spawned,</b> and should be forbidden.

### Part 18
<b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> It is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>found</b> the kosher fish in <b>the digestive tract,</b> which is not where the non-kosher fish normally spawns its offspring. <b>Rav Pappa says</b> similarly: It is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>found</b> the kosher fish in <b>the passageway of the gullet. Rav Naḥman says:</b> It is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>found it whole</b> and in complete form, and not as a newly hatched fish.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Ashi says:</b> Do not infer from the mishna that it is referring to a case where the non-kosher fish was seen swallowing the kosher fish. Rather, the reason it is permitted to consume the swallowed fish is that <b>the majority of fish spawn</b> offspring <b>of their</b> own <b>species, and</b> therefore the case of a kosher fish discovered inside a non-kosher fish <b>is considered as if</b> the non-kosher fish had <b>swallowed</b> the kosher fish <b>in our presence.</b>

### Part 20
§ The Gemara cites the entirety of the previously mentioned <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Sages taught</b> that <b>a non-kosher fish spawns</b> its offspring, while <b>a kosher fish lays eggs. Any</b> animal <b>that gives birth</b> to its offspring <b>nurses</b> them, <b>and any</b> animal <b>that lays eggs gathers</b> food and feeds it to its young. This applies to all animals <b>except for a bat [<i>atallef</i> ], as although it lays eggs, it nurses</b> its young.
