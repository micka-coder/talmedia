### Part 1
<b>he may not say: I will separate ten</b> and bring them into the pen, <b>and I will take one of them</b> as animal tithe, <b>and the rest</b> will be <b>exempt. Rather,</b> he must <b>bring</b> them all <b>into the pen and remove ten</b> of them by causing them to emerge from the opening, <b>and take one of them,</b> the tenth one, as animal tithe. <b>And the remainder combine</b> with animals born later, to be tithed <b>in another</b> designated time of <b>gathering.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if one has <b>nineteen lambs he may not say: I will separate ten</b> and bring them into the pen, <b>and I will take one of them</b> as animal tithe <b>and the rest</b> will be <b>exempt; rather,</b> he must <b>bring</b> them all <b>into the pen and remove ten</b> of them by causing them to emerge from the opening, <b>and take one of them,</b> the tenth one, <b>and the remainder are exempt?</b> According to this <i>baraita</i>, the remainder are not combined with animals born later.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Huna bar Seḥora interpreted</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rava at</b> the time of the <b>Festival</b> discourse: <b>We are dealing with a pen that has two openings. And nine</b> of the lambs <b>emerged</b> through <b>this opening and nine</b> of them went out through <b>that opening, and this</b> last <b>one</b> remaining in the pen <b>is fit to</b> come out <b>here or to</b> come out <b>there.</b> Therefore, all the lambs emerged as part of a tally fit to reach ten.

### Part 4
The Gemara challenges: <b>But let him teach</b> instead that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he counted nine, and when the tenth</b> lamb <b>arrived</b> to be counted <b>he called</b> it number <b>one</b> and began counting again <b>from the start.</b> In such a case he designated only the nineteenth lamb that emerged as number ten, and therefore all the other lambs are exempt. The Gemara explains that Rav Huna bar Seḥora <b>holds</b> that the <b>tenth</b> animal to come out of the pen <b>is sanctified of its own</b> accord, even if it was designated as number one.

### Part 5
The Gemara challenges: <b>But let him teach</b> instead that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a case of a designated time for <b>gathering</b> the animals, and that the pen has only one opening, <b>but he counted them pair by pair,</b> i.e., he called the first pair number one, the second pair number two, and so on. In this manner, the nineteenth lamb would be designated as number ten and thereby exempt the others. The Gemara explains that Rav Huna bar Seḥora <b>holds</b> that the <b>tenth according to the number of animals is sanctified,</b> regardless of how he counts them. Accordingly, one of the fifth pair would be the tithed animal, and the remaining nine would not be considered part of a tally fit to reach ten.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> with regard to this incident: <b>The mother of Rav Huna bar Seḥora merited</b> to give birth to such a son, <b>who explained the <i>halakha</i></b> before Rava <b>at</b> the time of <b>the Festival</b> discourse <b>in accordance with</b> Rava’s <b>own <i>halakha</i>.</b>

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>two</b> animals <b>emerged as one, one counts them as twos,</b> i.e., as though they came out one after the other. If he mistakenly <b>counted</b> two of the animals at the beginning or in the middle of the ten as <b>one,</b> and then continued his count, the <b>ninth and</b> the <b>tenth are flawed,</b> as he called the tenth: Ninth, and he called the eleventh: Tenth.

### Part 8
If he mistakenly <b>called</b> the <b>ninth: Tenth, and</b> the <b>tenth: Ninth, and the eleventh: Tenth,</b> the <b>three of them are sacred,</b> although each has a different halakhic status. <b>The ninth is eaten in its blemished</b> state; <b>and the tenth is</b> animal <b>tithe,</b> which is sacrificed in the Temple and eaten by its owner; <b>and</b> the <b>eleventh is sacrificed as a peace offering,</b> from which the breast and the thigh are given to the priest. <b>And</b> the eleventh <b>renders</b> a non-sacred animal that is exchanged for the peace offering consecrated as <b>a substitute</b> and he sacrifices it as a peace offering; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> The eleventh animal itself, which he called tenth, is a substitute for animal tithe, <b>and does a substitute render</b> another animal <b>a substitute?</b> Everyone agrees that a substitute is created only in exchange for an originally consecrated animal. The Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> The eleventh animal is not considered a substitute for the animal tithe, since <b>if it were a substitute it would not be sacrificed,</b> as the substitute for an animal tithe is not sacrificed. If <b>one called the ninth</b> animal: <b>Tenth, and the tenth: Tenth, and the eleventh: Tenth, the eleventh is not consecrated. This is the principle:</b> In <b>any</b> situation <b>where the name</b> of the <b>tenth was not removed from</b> the tenth animal, the <b>eleventh</b> that was called the tenth <b>is not consecrated.</b>

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>counted</b> the animals <b>pair by pair,</b> i.e., he called the first pair: One, and the second pair: Two, and so on, or if one counted them <b>hundred [<i>kinteran</i>]</b> by <b>hundred,</b> the <b>tenth</b> according <b>to his number is sanctified.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: When Rabbi Yoḥanan says that the tenth is sanctified according <b>to his number, what</b> does he mean? <b>Rav Mari says: It is sanctified according to his counting,</b> i.e., all the animals in whichever pair or group he calls: Ten, are sanctified, e.g., the tenth pair, which consists of the nineteenth and twentieth animals. <b>Rav Kahana says: It is sanctified according to the number of animals,</b> regardless of how he designates them.

### Part 12
The Gemara cites support for Rav Mari’s opinion. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>two</b> animals <b>emerged as one, one counts them as twos.</b> If he mistakenly <b>counted</b> a pair of animals in the middle as <b>one</b> and continued his count, the <b>ninth and</b> the <b>tenth are flawed,</b> as he called the tenth: Ninth, and the eleventh: Tenth.

### Part 13
<b>Granted, according to the one who says: It is sanctified according to his counting,</b> i.e., Rav Mari, it is <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>the ninth and</b> the <b>tenth are flawed,</b> because the number by which one designates them is significant, <b>and he called the tenth</b> animal the <b>ninth, and the eleventh</b> he designated as <b>tenth. But according to the one who says</b> that the animal <b>is sanctified according to the number of animals</b> regardless of how the owner designates each one, i.e., Rav Kahana, why are they flawed? It should be considered as though <b>he called the ninth</b> animal the <b>ninth, and the tenth</b> animal <b>he called: Tenth.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara answers that according to Rav Kahana, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said to you: When I said</b> the designation goes according to the animal I was referring only to a case <b>where he intended to take out</b> the animals <b>pair by pair,</b> and he did not err. In such a case his designation is nullified and the animals are sanctified in accordance with the order they left the pen. But with regard to a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>emerged by itself</b> and the owner miscounted I did <b>not</b> say the designation goes according to the number of the animal, as the Torah explicitly includes a case where the sanctification follows a mistaken designation (see 60b).

### Part 15
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>counted them backward,</b> i.e., ten, nine, eight, and so on, the <b>tenth</b> animal <b>in the numbering,</b> which he designated as number one, <b>is sanctified. Granted, according to the one who says</b> that the tithe <b>is sanctified according to the</b> number of <b>animals</b> regardless of how he designates each animal, i.e., Rav Kahana, this works out <b>well,</b> as the tenth animal is sanctified. <b>But according to the one who says it is sanctified</b> according <b>to his counting,</b> i.e., Rav Mari, why is the tenth animal sanctified? After all, <b>he called</b> the <b>tenth</b> animal number <b>one.</b>

### Part 16
<b>Rava said:</b> The tenth animal is sanctified according to Rav Mari <b>because it</b> has been counted as number ten <b>in Persian counting, as they call the tenth</b> one in their language by the term <b>one,</b> i.e., they count only in units of ten, and call these units: One. Therefore, in this case there is no contradiction between the designation and the number of the animal.
