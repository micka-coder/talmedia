### Part 1
The Gemara answers: One can <b>say that Rabbi Meir says</b> that priests are suspect with regard to causing blemishes only to the extent <b>that</b> there is <b>a concern</b> that they might have caused a blemish. But <b>did he say</b> this ruling <b>to establish them</b> as those who definitely cause blemishes? Certainly not.

### Part 2
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>testimony</b> based on <b>hearsay,</b> where one repeats the testimony of another witness, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>in</b> a case of such <b>testimony</b> about a blemished <b>firstborn</b> animal? <b>Rav Asi deems prohibited</b> the slaughter of the animal based on such testimony, <b>and Rav Ashi deems</b> it <b>permitted. Rav Asi said to Rav Ashi: But isn’t it taught in</b> a <i>baraita</i> in the <b>school of Menashe</b> that <b>hearsay testimony is valid only for</b> the <b>testimony of a woman,</b> where one testifies that her husband is dead? This indicates that such testimony is not accepted in all other instances.

### Part 3
Rav Ashi responded: Emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>teach</b> it like this: Testimony based on hearsay is valid <b>only for</b> that <b>testimony for which</b> the testimony of <b>a woman is valid.</b> According to Rav Ashi, the <i>baraita</i> is teaching that any case where the testimony of a woman is valid, hearsay testimony is valid as well, and this includes testimony concerning a blemished firstborn animal.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Yeimar deemed fit testimony</b> based on <b>hearsay with regard to</b> a blemished <b>firstborn</b> animal. <b>Mareimar</b> condescendingly <b>called him: Yeimar</b> who <b>permits firstborn</b> animals. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>testimony</b> based on <b>hearsay is valid</b> in the case <b>of a firstborn</b> animal.

### Part 5
§ The Gemara discusses a related matter. <b>Rabbi Ile’a says:</b> In a case where a blemished animal <b>was not established as being a firstborn, and one</b> priest <b>came</b> to an expert <b>and said that it is a firstborn</b> animal <b>and</b> yet <b>its blemish is with it,</b> i.e., it was unintentionally blemished, <b>he is deemed credible,</b> and the expert may deem the animal fit for slaughter based on the priest’s testimony.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Ile’a <b>teaching us?</b> Is he teaching us the principle <b>that the mouth that prohibited</b> it <b>is the mouth that permitted</b> it, i.e., when the only source that an item was prohibited is the statement of one who says that it is now permitted, his claim is accepted? But <b>we learn</b> this in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 22a): With regard to <b>a woman who said: I was a married woman and</b> now <b>I am a divorcée, she is deemed credible</b> and permitted to remarry, <b>as the mouth that prohibited</b> her by establishing that she was married <b>is the mouth that permitted</b> her by establishing that she was divorced.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Ile’a’s statement is necessary, <b>lest you say it is</b> only <b>there,</b> in the case of the mishna, that the woman’s testimony is accepted, <b>as, if she wants</b> to remarry illegally, <b>she</b> does <b>not</b> need to <b>say</b> anything at all about previously being married. <b>But here,</b> with regard to the firstborn animal, it is different, <b>as,</b> if the priest wishes to eat the meat of the animal, <b>it not sufficient</b> for him <b>not to</b> bring the animal to an expert, i.e., he has no recourse other than to <b>say</b> that it is a firstborn animal which has a blemish requiring examination, <b>as</b> he cannot determine on his own whether this blemish permanently disqualifies the firstborn animal from sacrifice, and <b>he would not eat sacrificial</b> meat <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, which is punishable by <i>karet</i>.

### Part 8
Since the priest must admit that this is a firstborn animal, <b>I</b> might <b>say</b> that <b>this is not</b> a case of: <b>The mouth that prohibited</b> it is the mouth that permitted it, and therefore the priest is not deemed credible. To dispel this possibility, Rabbi Ile’a <b>teaches us</b> that he is deemed credible, <b>because if it due to that</b> reason, that the priest is suspected of causing the blemish, <b>he would have caused a blemish that</b> is <b>obvious to all.</b> In such a case, he would violate a mere prohibition, not one that is punishable by <i>karet</i>, since he would not be eating sacrificial meat outside the Temple courtyard, as the animal is blemished.

### Part 9
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi objects to this: What is different</b> between this case and <b>that</b> incident involving <b>a certain man who rented a donkey to another?</b> The owner <b>said to</b> the renter: <b>Look, do not go on the path of Nehar Pekod, where there is water</b> and the donkey is likely to drown. Instead, <b>go on the path of Neresh, where there is no water.</b> The renter <b>went on the path of Nehar Pekod and the donkey died. When he came</b> back, <b>he said:</b> Yes, <b>I went on the path of Nehar Pekod, but there was no water</b> there, and therefore the donkey’s death was caused by other factors.

### Part 10
<b>And Rava said:</b> The renter’s claim is accepted, due to the reasoning of: <b>Why would he lie</b> and state this claim? In other words, <b>if</b> this man <b>wanted</b> to lie, <b>he</b> could have <b>told</b> the donkey’s owner: <b>I went on the path of Neresh,</b> as the owner instructed. <b>And Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>We do not say</b> the principle of: <b>Why would he lie, in a place</b> where there are <b>witnesses.</b> Since witnesses can be summoned to establish conclusively whether there was water along the path of Nehar Pekod, the reasoning that the renter could have stated a different claim is not employed. Similarly, the priest’s contention that the blemish occurred inadvertently should not be deemed credible, as it is known that priests are suspected of causing blemishes.

### Part 11
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> with regard to the path of Nehar Pekod, <b>there is certainly water there, but</b> here, the possibility <b>that</b> the priest <b>caused a blemish in</b> the firstborn animal <b>is</b> only <b>a concern, and in a place of</b> mere <b>concern we</b> do <b>say</b> the reasoning of: <b>Why would he lie?</b> The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina was sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i></b> of Rabbi Ile’a <b>anonymously. Rava Zuti said to Ravina: We learned this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>in the name of Rabbi Ile’a.</b>

### Part 12
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Tzadok,</b> an erudite priest, <b>had a firstborn</b> animal. <b>He placed barley in</b> wicker <b>baskets for it,</b> and <b>while it was eating, its lip split,</b> rendering the animal blemished. Rabbi Tzadok <b>came before Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> to ask whether or not he is suspected of intentionally causing a blemish in his firstborn animal offering. Rabbi Tzadok <b>said to him: Didn’t we differentiate between</b> a priest who is <b>a <i>ḥaver</i>,</b> i.e., learned, <b>and</b> a priest who is <b>an ignoramus,</b> with regard to their credibility about blemishes found on a firstborn animal? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: Yes,</b> we did. Since you are a learned priest, you are deemed credible to testify that this blemish was caused inadvertently.

### Part 13
Rabbi Tzadok then <b>came before Rabban Gamliel,</b> the <i>Nasi</i> and head of the academy of Yavne at the time. Rabbi Tzadok <b>said to him:</b> Didn’t <b>we differentiate between</b> a priest who is <b>a <i>ḥaver</i> and</b> a priest who is <b>an ignoramus</b> with regard to credibility about blemishes found on a firstborn animal? <b>Rabban Gamliel said to him: No,</b> we did not. Rabbi Tzadok <b>said to him: But Rabbi Yehoshua said to me</b> that <b>yes,</b> we did differentiate in this manner. Rabban Gamliel <b>said to</b> Rabbi Tzadok: <b>Wait until the masters of the shields [<i>ba’alei terisin</i>],</b> a reference to the Torah scholars who battle in the war of Torah, <b>enter the study hall,</b> at which point we will discuss this issue.

### Part 14
<b>When</b> the Torah scholars <b>entered the study hall, the questioner stood</b> before everyone present <b>and asked:</b> With regard to blemishes found on a firstborn animal, <b>didn’t we differentiate between</b> a priest who is <b>a <i>ḥaver</i> and</b> a priest who is <b>an ignoramus? Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: No,</b> we did not. <b>Rabban Gamliel said to him: But they said to me in your name</b> that <b>yes,</b> we did differentiate.

### Part 15
Rabban Gamliel continued: <b>Yehoshua, stand on your feet and they will testify against you</b> that you did, in fact, say that we differentiated in such a case. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua stood on his feet and said: How should I act</b> in this situation? <b>If I were alive and</b> Rabbi Tzadok <b>were dead, the living can contradict the dead,</b> and I could deny issuing that ruling. <b>Now that I am alive and he is alive, how can the living contradict the living?</b> I have no choice but to admit that I said it.

### Part 16
In the meantime, <b>Rabban Gamliel was standing and lecturing, and Rabbi Yehoshua</b> all the while <b>was standing on his feet,</b> as Rabban Gamliel did not instruct him to sit. He remained standing in deference to the <i>Nasi</i>. This continued for some time, <b>until</b> it aroused great resentment against Rabban Gamliel, and <b>all of the people</b> assembled began <b>murmuring and said to Ḥutzpit the disseminator: Stop</b> conveying Rabban Gamliel’s lecture, <b>and he stopped.</b>

### Part 17
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A priest is deemed credible to say: I showed this firstborn</b> animal to an expert <b>and</b> he ruled that <b>it is blemished.</b>

### Part 18
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: A priest is deemed credible to say: An Israelite gave me this firstborn</b> animal <b>with its blemish</b> already inflicted upon it. <b>What is the reason?</b> With regard to <b>any matter that is likely to be revealed, people do not lie about it.</b> Since the Israelite can be questioned with regard to the veracity of the priest’s claim, it is assumed that the priest will not risk lying. <b>Rav Ashi said: We learn</b> a similar principle in the mishna <b>as well: A priest is deemed credible to say: I showed this firstborn</b> animal to an expert <b>and</b> he ruled that <b>it is blemished. What is the reason</b> the priest’s claim is deemed credible? <b>Is it not because we say</b> that with regard to <b>any matter that is likely to be revealed, people do not lie about it?</b>

### Part 19
The Gemara rejects the claim that the mishna’s ruling is based on the principle that people do not lie about a matter that is likely to be revealed: Perhaps <b>there,</b> in the case of the mishna, the reason the priest’s claim is accepted is that <b>he</b> would <b>not eat sacrificial</b> meat <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard. If an expert had not permitted the meat, the priest would not eat it. <b>But here,</b> in Rav’s case, where the priest claims an Israelite gave him an already blemished animal, <b>since</b> priests <b>are suspected</b> of causing blemishes and claiming that it was inadvertent, <b>they are</b> also <b>suspected</b> of causing a blemish and claiming it was given to them in that state by an Israelite.

### Part 20
<b>Rav Sheizevi raises an objection</b> to Rav’s ruling from a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 4:5): In the case of <b>one who says to someone who is not trusted with regard to tithe: Purchase</b> produce <b>for me from someone who is trusted</b> with regard to tithes, i.e., one who does not purchase produce from an ignoramus, who generally does not separate tithes; <b>or</b> if he says: Purchase produce for me <b>from someone who tithes,</b> i.e., even from one who purchases produce from an ignoramus but is careful to set aside tithes upon purchasing the produce, the agent <b>is not deemed credible</b> to claim that he fulfilled the condition of the one who appointed him. According to Rav, <b>why</b> isn’t the agent deemed credible? <b>Say</b> the principle that with regard to <b>any matter that is likely to be revealed, people do not lie about it.</b>

### Part 21
The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there,</b>
