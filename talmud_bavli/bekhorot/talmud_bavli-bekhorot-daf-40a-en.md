### Part 1
<b>in</b> the chamber of <b>Shushan the capital,</b> which was located above the eastern gate of the Temple Mount, <b>one in the northeast corner and one in the southeast corner.</b> The one <b>that was in the northeast corner was longer than</b> the cubit used <b>by Moses</b> in the building of the Tabernacle, which was six handbreadths, by <b>half a fingerbreadth,</b> and the one <b>that was in the southeast corner was longer than</b> the other one by another <b>half a fingerbreadth.</b> One therefore <b>finds it longer than Moses’</b> cubit by a full <b>fingerbreadth.</b>

### Part 2
The mishna continues: <b>And why did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that there should be two measures of a cubit, <b>one large and one small?</b> It was <b>so that the artisans</b> who were working in the Temple <b>would take</b> payment according the amount of work they did, as measured <b>by the small</b> cubit, <b>and return</b> it to the Temple through their work, as measured <b>by the large</b> cubit, <b>so they would not come to misuse consecrated property.</b> If they would accept any payment that they did not deserve, they would be misusing consecrated property. It was with regard to the fingerbreadth mentioned in this mishna that the <i>baraita</i> cited above teaches that it is one-fourth of a handbreadth of any average person.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>two</b> large cubits? The Gemara answers: <b>One,</b> the shorter of the two, was used <b>to</b> measure <b>silver and gold.</b> Since silver and gold were valuable, the difference between the two measurements was set at only half a fingerbreadth, so that the artisans would not suffer too great a loss. <b>And</b> the other <b>one,</b> which was longer than Moses’ cubit by a full fingerbreadth, was used <b>in</b> the <b>construction</b> of wood and stone structures.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, and some say Rav Huna bar Natan,</b> said: This <i>baraita</i>, which states that a fingerbreadth is one-fourth of a handbreadth of any average person, is referring <b>to that which we learned</b> in the mishna here with regard to the blemishes of a firstborn animal: In a case <b>where there is a full fingerbreadth of flesh between one joint and another joint.</b> That measure of a full fingerbreadth is one-fourth of a handbreadth.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The firstborn animal may be slaughtered if <b>it has no testicles or</b> if <b>it has only one testicle. Rabbi Yishmael says: If</b> the animal <b>has two</b> scrotal <b>sacs,</b> it can be assumed that <b>it has two testicles;</b> if the animal <b>does not have two</b> scrotal <b>sacs,</b> it can be assumed that <b>it has only one testicle. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The matter can be ascertained: <b>One seats</b> the animal <b>on its rump and mashes</b> the sac; <b>if there is a testicle, ultimately</b> it is going <b>to emerge.</b> There was <b>an incident where one mashed</b> the sac <b>and</b> the testicle <b>did not emerge.</b> Then, the animal <b>was slaughtered and</b> the testicle <b>was discovered attached to the loins. And Rabbi Akiva permitted</b> the consumption of its flesh, as the testicle had not previously emerged, <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri prohibited</b> its consumption.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that a firstborn may be slaughtered if it has no testicles or if it has only one testicle. The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that with regard to a case where <b>it has only one testicle you said</b> that <b>it is a blemish, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state the same in a case where <b>it has no</b> testicles <b>at all?</b> The Gemara answers that the mishna <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> If <b>it does not have two testicles in two</b> scrotal <b>sacs, but in one sac,</b> or <b>alternatively,</b> if it has <b>two sacs and one testicle, it is a blemish.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara continues this version of the mishna. <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> If the animal <b>has two</b> scrotal <b>sacs, it is known that it has two testicles,</b> and therefore it is not blemished and may not be slaughtered; if the animal <b>has only one</b> scrotal <b>sac it is considered like one that has only one testicle,</b> even if it actually has two testicles. <b>And Rabbi Akiva comes to say:</b> If it has two sacs, <b>we do not say</b> the claim of: <b>It is known. Rather, one seats</b> the animal <b>on its rump and mashes</b> the sac; <b>if there is a testicle, ultimately</b> it is going <b>to emerge.</b> If the testicle does not emerge, clearly it has only one testicle and is blemished.

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> there was <b>an incident where one mashed</b> the sac <b>and</b> the testicle <b>did not emerge.</b> Then the animal was slaughtered and the testicle was discovered attached to the loins. And Rabbi Akiva permitted the consumption of its flesh, and Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri prohibited its consumption. The Gemara elaborates on this incident: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said:</b> There was <b>an incident in Piran of Beit Menaḥem where</b> a firstborn animal apparently had only one testicle, and someone <b>mashed</b> its sac <b>and</b> the other testicle <b>did not emerge. And</b> the animal <b>was slaughtered and</b> the testicle <b>was discovered attached to the loins. And Rabbi Akiva permitted</b> its consumption, <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri prohibited</b> its consumption.

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Akiva said to Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri: Until when will you consume the property of the Jewish people</b> by prohibiting animals in such cases? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri said to Rabbi Akiva: Until when will you feed the Jewish people</b> unslaughtered animal <b>carcasses?</b> The Gemara asks: How could Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri use the term animal carcasses here? After all, <b>aren’t they</b> properly <b>slaughtered?</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara responds: <b>Rather,</b> Yoḥanan ben Nuri actually referred to <b>animals with a wound that will cause them to die within twelve months [<i>tereifot</i>].</b> The Gemara challenges: But <b>it is not a prohibition of <i>tereifot</i>. Rather,</b> he said: <b>Until when will you feed the Jewish people sacrificial</b> animals <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard? According to Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri this is not a blemish, and therefore the animal is an unblemished offering, which may not be eaten outside the Temple.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> An animal <b>with five legs, or</b> one <b>that has only three, or</b> one <b>whose</b> hooves on its <b>legs were closed like</b> those <b>of a donkey</b> and not split, <b>or the <i>shaḥul</i>, or the <i>kasul</i></b> may be slaughtered. <b>What is a <i>shaḥul</i>?</b> It is an animal with <b>a thighbone that was dislocated. And</b> what is <b>a <i>kasul</i>?</b> It is an animal whose build is asymmetrical in <b>that one of its thighs is higher</b> than the other.

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that an animal with five legs or three legs is blemished. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>was missing or had an additional foreleg. But</b> if it was missing or had <b>an</b> additional <b>hind leg,</b> not only is it blemished, but <b>it is also a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> The reason is <b>that any extra</b> limb <b>is like a removed</b> limb, and an animal whose hind leg was removed is a <i>tereifa</i>.

### Part 13
With regard to the ruling of the mishna that an animal whose hooves were closed like those of a donkey is blemished, <b>Rav Pappa says: Do not say</b> that it is a blemish only in a case <b>where</b> its hooves are entirely like those of a donkey, i.e., <b>round and not split</b> at all. <b>Rather, when they are round, even though they are</b> also <b>split,</b> it is still considered a blemish.

### Part 14
The mishna teaches: <b>Or the <i>shaḥul</i>, or the <i>kasul</i></b> may be slaughtered. In this regard, <b>the Sages taught: What is</b> the <b><i>kasul</i> and what is</b> the <b><i>shaḥul</i>?</b> The <b><i>shaḥul</i></b> is an animal with <b>a thighbone that was dislocated.</b> The <b><i>kasul</i></b> is an animal that is irregular in <b>that one of its legs is inside the loin,</b> i.e., in its proper place, <b>and</b> in <b>one of its legs</b> the bone is dislocated and is <b>above the loin.</b> It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: What are <b>the <i>saru’a</i> and <i>kalut</i></b> mentioned in the Torah (see Leviticus 22:23) among the animals disqualified from being sacrificed? The <b><i>saru’a</i></b> is one <b>whose thigh is longer</b> than the other; the <b><i>kalut</i></b> is one <b>whose</b> hooves on <b>its legs are closed like</b> those <b>of a donkey and like</b> those <b>of a horse.</b>

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Additional blemishes that permit the slaughter of the firstborn include those where <b>the bone of its foreleg or the bone of its hind leg was broken, even though it is not conspicuous.</b> With regard to <b>these blemishes</b> listed in this chapter, <b>Ila,</b> who was expert in blemishes of the firstborn, <b>enumerated</b> them <b>in Yavne, and the Sages deferred to his</b> expertise.

### Part 16
<b>And</b> Ila <b>added three additional</b> blemishes, and the Sages <b>said to him: We did not hear</b> about <b>those.</b> Ila added: An animal <b>whose eye is round like</b> that <b>of a person, or whose mouth is similar to</b> that <b>of a pig, or where most of</b> the segment of <b>its tongue</b> corresponding to the segment that facilitates <b>speech</b> in the tongue of a person <b>was removed. The court that followed them said</b> with regard to each of those three blemishes: <b>That is a blemish</b> that enables the slaughter of the firstborn.

### Part 17
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if the bone of its foreleg or the bone of its hind leg was broken it is considered a blemish, despite the fact that it is not conspicuous. The Gemara asks: If <b>it is not conspicuous, is it a blemish?</b> A blemish must be on an exposed part of the body (see 37b). <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The mishna means that <b>it is not conspicuous on its own account,</b> i.e., the shape of the leg is no different from the usual. <b>But it is conspicuous on account of</b> its <b>work,</b> i.e., the manner in which the animal walks.

### Part 18
§ The mishna teaches that with regard to <b>these blemishes</b> listed in this chapter, Ila <b>enumerated</b> them in Yavne, and he added three more, including an animal whose eye is round like that of a person. The Gemara asks: Is this <b>to say that it is not the manner</b> of animals to have eyes of this kind? <b>And</b> one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 21a): With regard to a woman <b>who miscarries</b> a fetus in the form of <b>a type of domesticated animal, undomesticated animal, or bird, whether it is a non-kosher</b> animal <b>or whether it is a kosher</b> animal, <b>if it is male,</b> the woman <b>observes</b> the periods of impurity, i.e., seven days, and purity, i.e., thirty-three days, established in the Torah <b>for</b> a woman who gives birth to <b>a male.</b>

### Part 19
<b>If</b> it is <b>female,</b> the woman <b>observes</b> the periods of impurity, i.e., fourteen days, and purity, i.e., sixty-six days, established in the Torah <b>for</b> a woman who gives birth to <b>a female.</b> If its sex <b>is unknown,</b> the woman <b>observes</b> the more severe restrictions from the case of the birth <b>of a male and</b> the more severe restrictions from the case of the birth <b>of a female:</b> She is impure for fourteen days like a woman who gave birth to a female, but blood that she sees thereafter is pure until only forty days after birth, like a woman who gave birth to a male. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

### Part 20
<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What is the reason of Rabbi Meir? Since the eye</b> of these animals <b>is round like</b> that <b>of a person,</b> a woman who miscarries a fetus of this kind is impure. <b>Rav Yosef said</b> in resolution of this apparent contradiction: It is <b>not difficult; this</b> is referring <b>to the black</b> portion of the eye, whereas <b>that</b> is referring <b>to the white</b> portion of the eye.

### Part 21
The mishna teaches: <b>Or its mouth is similar to</b> that <b>of a pig. Rav Pappa says: Do not say</b> that this is referring only to a case <b>where</b> the mouth is <b>pointed and</b> the upper lip <b>overlaps</b> the bottom lip, exactly like that of a pig. <b>Rather, when it overlaps, even though it is not pointed,</b> this is a blemish.

### Part 22
The mishna teaches: <b>Or that most of</b> the segment of <b>its tongue</b> corresponding to the segment that facilitates <b>speech</b> in the tongue of a person <b>was removed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna? It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Or that most of its tongue was removed; Rabbi Yehuda says: Most of</b> the segment of <b>its tongue</b> corresponding to the segment that facilitates <b>speech</b> in the tongue of a person must be removed to be considered a blemish.

### Part 23
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And</b> there was <b>an incident where the lower jaw</b> of the firstborn <b>protruded beyond the upper</b> jaw, <b>and Rabban Gamliel asked the Sages</b> for a ruling, <b>and they said: That is a blemish</b> that enables the slaughter of the firstborn.

### Part 24
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the ruling <b>taught</b> in the previous mishna <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> is referring to when he <b>teaches</b> here: <b>And</b> there was <b>an incident?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since we learned</b> in the list of blemishes in the previous mishna the case where <b>its mouth is similar to</b> that <b>of a pig, and the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi</b> Ila in that case, <b>we say</b> here that <b>when the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi</b> Ila, it is only in a case <b>where its upper lip overlaps the lower</b> lip. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where the lower</b> jaw <b>protrudes beyond the upper</b> jaw, everyone agrees that <b>this is a blemish.</b>
