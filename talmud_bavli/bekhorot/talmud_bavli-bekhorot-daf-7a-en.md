### Part 1
it <b>is different from</b> an ordinary <b>camel</b> and has some characteristics of its mother, perhaps it is <b>permitted</b> to eat it. <b>Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference,</b> and with regard to consumption Rabbi Shimon also requires that its head and the majority of its body resemble its mother.

### Part 2
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a kosher animal that gave birth to a non-kosher animal of sorts,</b> the offspring <b>is forbidden for consumption,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon; <b>but if its head and the majority of</b> its body are <b>similar to its mother, it is obligated in,</b> i.e., subject to the obligations of, <b>firstborn</b> status. <b>Learn from it</b> that <b>with regard to consumption, Rabbi Shimon also requires</b> that <b>its head and the majority of</b> its body resemble the mother.

### Part 3
The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>No,</b> the requirement that its head and the majority of its body resemble the mother is relevant <b>specifically with regard to firstborn</b> status. The Gemara comments: The language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise, as</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>leaves</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>consumption</b> with which he began <b>and addresses</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>firstborn</b> status. <b>Learn from it</b> that it <b>is with regard to firstborn</b> status <b>that Rabbi Shimon requires</b> that <b>its head and the majority of</b> its body resemble the mother, <b>but with regard to consumption</b> he does <b>not</b> require this, and even a partial similarity suffices.

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects this conclusion as well: <b>Actually, I will say to you</b> that <b>with regard to</b> the permissibility of <b>consumption he also requires</b> that its head and the majority of its body be similar to the mother. <b>But</b> it <b>was necessary</b> to state this condition specifically with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>firstborn</b> status, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “But the firstborn of an ox”</b> (Numbers 18:17), perhaps firstborn status does not apply <b>unless it is an ox and its firstborn is an ox, and</b> a resemblance <b>of the</b> offspring’s <b>head and the majority of</b> its body to the mother <b>does not suffice unless its whole</b> body <b>has</b> the appearance of an ox. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that a resemblance of its head and the majority of its body to the mother do suffice.

### Part 5
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states: <b>“Nevertheless these shall you not eat from them that only chew the cud, or from them that only have a split hoof:</b> The camel” (Leviticus 11:4). The phrase: “From them that only chew the cud,” which is referring to animals that are forbidden for consumption, indicates that a camel or other non-kosher animal that is born to a kosher animal is forbidden. Furthermore, the word “these” teaches that concerning <b>these</b> animals that resemble a non-kosher animal, <b>you may not eat</b> them when they are born to a kosher animal, <b>but you may eat</b> a non-kosher animal <b>that comes with one characteristic</b> of its mother.

### Part 6
<b>And which</b> animal <b>is this that comes with one characteristic</b> of its mother? <b>This is a non-kosher</b> animal <b>that is born from a kosher</b> female animal <b>and its impregnation</b> came <b>from a kosher</b> male animal.

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if <b>its conception</b> came <b>from a non-kosher</b> male animal it should be permitted. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “These are the beasts which you may eat: “The ox, <b>the sheep [<i>seh kesavim</i>], and goat [<i>veseh izzim</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:4). The plural form of “<i>kesavim</i>” and “<i>izzim</i>” indicates that a lamb is not kosher <b>unless its father is a male lamb and its mother is a female lamb.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Offspring whose father and mother are both kosher are permitted, and <b>this verse</b> which renders permitted an offspring that partially resembles its mother <b>does not come to permit that which is permitted,</b> i.e., where both parents are kosher, but it comes <b>rather to add to that which is permitted; and which</b> case <b>is this?</b> It is a case of <b>a non-kosher</b> animal <b>that is born from a kosher</b> animal <b>and its conception</b> came <b>from a non-kosher</b> animal. <b>Or</b> perhaps it permits <b>only</b> an animal whose <b>conception</b> came <b>from a kosher</b> animal? <b>The verse states: “The ox, the sheep [<i>seh kesavim</i>], and goat [<i>veseh izzim</i>].”</b> The repetition of the word <i>seh</i> indicates that it is permitted to be eaten <b>in any case,</b> even if only its mother was a ewe.

### Part 9
In any event, the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>refers to</b> a non-kosher animal that was born to a kosher animal as <b>non-kosher, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who deems a camel that was born to a cow forbidden to eat, <b>and he says: But you may eat</b> a non-kosher animal <b>that comes with one characteristic</b> that is similar to its mother. Apparently, Rabbi Shimon does not require that the head and the majority of the body resemble the mother for it to be rendered fit for consumption.

### Part 10
The Gemara responds: No proof may be brought from here, as <b>this <i>tanna</i> holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Shimon <b>with regard to one</b> matter, where a kosher animal gave birth to a non-kosher animal, maintaining that it is forbidden, <b>and disagrees with his</b> opinion <b>with regard to one</b> other matter, where the animal has some characteristics of the mother, in which case this <i>tanna</i> deems it permitted to be eaten. Concerning the second matter, Rabbi Shimon deems it forbidden unless the head and majority of the body resemble the mother.

### Part 11
The Gemara comments that <b>there are those who raise a difficulty</b> with this <i>baraita</i> <b>and resolve</b> it, thereby resolving the dilemma concerning the opinion of Rabbi Shimon: The <i>baraita</i> states that the kosher animal’s <b>impregnation</b> came <b>from a non-kosher</b> animal. <b>Can</b> a kosher animal <b>become pregnant</b> from a non-kosher animal?

### Part 12
<b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi say: A non-kosher</b> animal <b>never becomes pregnant from a kosher</b> one, e.g., a camel from an ox, <b>nor a kosher</b> animal <b>from a non-kosher</b> one, e.g., a cow from a horse, <b>nor a large</b> animal <b>from a small</b> animal, e.g., a cow from a goat, <b>nor a small</b> one <b>from a large</b> one, e.g., a ewe from an ox, <b>nor a domesticated animal from an undomesticated animal,</b> e.g., a goat from a deer, <b>nor an undomesticated animal from a domesticated animal,</b> e.g., a gazelle from a goat.

### Part 13
With regard to all these cases, everyone agrees that pregnancy is impossible <b>except for Rabbi Eliezer and his disputants, who would say</b> that <b>an undomesticated animal can become pregnant from a domesticated animal</b> (see Ḥullin 79b). Those Sages disagree with regard to whether slaughtering the offspring of a gazelle that became pregnant from a goat is included in the prohibition against slaughtering a mother and its offspring on the same day.

### Part 14
<b>And Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> in response to the difficulty: When the <i>baraita</i> discusses the case of a kosher animal that became pregnant from a non-kosher animal, the reference is to a case <b>where</b> the kosher animal <b>became pregnant from</b> an animal <b>with closed hooves</b> that is <b>the offspring of a cow.</b> A cow can become pregnant from such an animal because the mother of that animal was a cow. <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>said</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon,</b> that a non-kosher animal that was born from a kosher animal is considered non-kosher, <b>and he says: But you may eat that which comes with one characteristic</b> of its mother. Apparently, Rabbi Shimon does deem permitted the consumption of an animal with some characteristics similar to its mother.

### Part 15
The Gemara responds: <b>This <i>tanna</i> holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Shimon <b>with regard to one</b> matter, where a kosher animal gave birth to a non-kosher animal, maintaining that it is forbidden, <b>and disagrees with his</b> opinion <b>with regard to one</b> other matter, where the animal has some characteristics of the mother, in which case this <i>tanna</i> deems it fit for consumption. Concerning the second matter, Rabbi Shimon deems it forbidden unless the head and majority of the body resemble the mother.

### Part 16
§ The Gemara asks concerning the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Is this to say that Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that when both <b>this and that cause</b> it, i.e., both permitted and forbidden items contribute to a result, the result is <b>permitted,</b> and he therefore permits the consumption of the offspring of a kosher animal that became pregnant from a non-kosher animal; <b>and Rabbi Yehoshua holds</b> that when both <b>this and that cause</b> it, it is <b>forbidden?</b>

### Part 17
<b>But we have heard them</b> saying <b>the opposite:</b> With regard to <b>the offspring of an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>]</b> and is forbidden to be eaten or sacrificed as an offering upon the altar, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The offspring <b>may not be sacrificed upon the altar</b> either, despite the fact that its father is kosher, <b>and Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The offspring <b>may be sacrificed upon the altar</b> despite the fact that its mother is a <i>tereifa</i>, since its father is kosher.

### Part 18
The Gemara answers: <b>Generally, Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that when both <b>this and that cause</b> the result, it is <b>forbidden. But</b> it <b>is different here</b> in the case of a kosher animal that became pregnant from a non-kosher animal, <b>because if</b> it is <b>so,</b> i.e., that the offspring is forbidden, <b>let the verse write: Sheep and goats [<i>seh kesavim ve’izzim</i>]. Why do I</b> need the verse to repeat the term “<i>seh</i>” in the phrase <b>“<i>seh</i></b> <i>kesavim <b>veseh</b> izzim</i>”? <b>Learn from it</b> that <b>a <i>seh</i></b> is permitted <b>in any case,</b> i.e., even if only the mother is kosher it is permitted to eat the offspring.

### Part 19
<b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> he could have <b>said to you: Generally,</b> if both <b>this and that cause</b> the result it is <b>permitted. But here</b> it is different, as <b>if so,</b> i.e., if the offspring of a kosher animal that became pregnant from a non-kosher animal is permitted, <b>let the verse write:</b> These are the animals that you may eat: <b>An ox, a lamb, and a goat. Why do I</b> need it to state: <b>“<i>Seh kesavim veseh izzim</i>,”</b> in the plural? <b>Learn from it</b> that the offspring may not be eaten <b>unless its father is a male lamb and its mother is a female lamb.</b>

### Part 20
§ The Gemara returns to the dilemma of whether Rabbi Shimon permits the consumption of the offspring of a kosher animal that resembles a non-kosher animal but has some of the characteristics of its mother. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> it is stated: <b>“Camel”</b> (Leviticus 11:4), <b>“camel”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:7), i.e., the term is written <b>two times</b> with regard to the prohibition against consumption. This teaches that <b>both a camel that is born from a camel and a camel that is born from a cow</b> are non-kosher. <b>And if</b> in the latter case <b>its head and the majority of</b> its body <b>are similar to its mother, it is permitted for consumption.</b>

### Part 21
<b>Learn from it</b> that not only with regard to firstborn status, but <b>with regard to consumption as well Rabbi Shimon requires</b> that <b>its head and the majority of</b> its body resemble the mother, and a partial resemblance does not suffice. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that this is so.

### Part 22
§ The mishna (5b) teaches: This is <b>because that which emerges from the non-kosher</b> animal is non-kosher and that which emerges from the kosher animal is kosher. The Sages <b>raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet:</b> With regard to <b>the urine of a donkey, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it forbidden, like the milk of a donkey?

### Part 23
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> should they <b>raise the dilemma</b> also <b>with regard to</b> the urine <b>of horses and camels?</b> The Gemara answers: With regard to the urine <b>of horses and camels they did not raise the dilemma, as</b> their urine <b>is not turbid and</b> consequently <b>is not similar to milk.</b> Rather, <b>water enters</b> their body and <b>water exits</b> their body. <b>When they raised the dilemma</b> it was concerning the urine <b>of a donkey, which is turbid and is</b> consequently <b>similar to milk. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Does it get excreted from its body, and it is</b> therefore <b>forbidden, or perhaps water enters</b> and <b>water exits, and</b> the fact <b>that it is turbid is</b> due to <b>the heat of the flesh?</b>

### Part 24
<b>Rav Sheshet said to them: You learned</b> the answer in the mishna: This is <b>because that which emerges from the non-kosher</b> animal <b>is non-kosher and that which emerges from the kosher</b> animal <b>is kosher.</b> From the fact that it <b>does not state:</b> That which emerges <b>from a non-kosher</b> animal [<i>mittamei</i>], meaning from the body of a non-kosher animal, but <b>rather</b> it says: <b>From</b>
