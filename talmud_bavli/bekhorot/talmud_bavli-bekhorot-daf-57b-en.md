### Part 1
<b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that a human child <b>born by caesarean section is a full-fledged offspring</b> and renders its mother ritually impure with the impurity of childbirth. Likewise, with regard to an animal born by caesarean section, he holds the birth was a proper birth and the animal may be brought as an offering, and therefore it also enters the pen to be tithed. <b>And</b> this is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who holds that Rabbi Shimon concedes that an animal born by caesarean section is disqualified from being brought as an offering (see <i>Nidda</i> 40a).

### Part 2
And <b>with regard to</b> an animal <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, this <i>tanna</i> <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda,</b> who maintains that the obligation of animal tithe applies to such an animal. As for <b>an orphan</b> animal, he is referring to a case <b>where</b> the mother’s <b>hide exists</b> at birth, i.e., the mother’s hide is present after the birth, and therefore the animal is not considered an orphan. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> whose opinion this <i>tanna</i> follows, conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says: Even if its mother was slaughtered but its hide exists</b> at birth, i.e., if the mother’s hide is present after the birth, <b>this is not an orphan.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yishmael ben Satriel, from</b> a place called <b>Arkat Leveina, testified before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>In our locale,</b> if an animal dies while giving birth <b>they flay the dead</b> mother’s skin <b>and clothe the living</b> newborn animal with it for protection. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> This testimony of yours <b>reveals the reason for</b> the ruling of <b>the mishna</b> that if the hide of the mother still exists the offspring is not considered to be an orphan; the hide serves as a substitute for the mother.

### Part 4
Rabbi Yishmael ben Satriel also testified before Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>The lettuce in our locale has 600,000 leaves in its omasum,</b> i.e., in its core. Rabbi Yishmael ben Satriel further testified before Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Once one cedar</b> tree <b>fell in our locale, and</b> it was so wide that <b>sixteen wagons passed over its back,</b> meaning the width of its trunk, as <b>one,</b> i.e., side by side.

### Part 5
Rabbi Yishmael ben Satriel also testified before Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Once an egg of</b> the bird called <b><i>bar yokhani</i> fell, and</b> the contents of the egg <b>drowned sixty cities and broke three hundred cedar</b> trees. The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> the <i>bar yokhani</i> bird <b>throw</b> its eggs to the ground? <b>But isn’t it written: “The <i>kenaf renanim</i> bird rejoices,</b> but are her wings and feathers those of the stork? For she leaves her eggs on the earth, and warms them in dust” (Job 39:13–14)? The Sages understood that <i>kenaf renanim</i> is another name for the <i>bar yokhani</i> bird. If so, how could its egg fall if it lays its eggs on the ground? <b>Rav Ashi said</b> in explanation: <b>That</b> egg <b>was unfertilized,</b> and since it would never hatch the bird threw it to the ground.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <b>three</b> times during the year designated for <b>gathering</b> the animals that were born since the last date <b>for animal tithe: Adjacent to Passover, and adjacent to <i>Shavuot</i>, and adjacent to <i>Sukkot</i>. And those are the gathering</b> times <b>for animal tithe;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Ben Azzai says</b> the dates are: <b>On the twenty-ninth of Adar, on the first of Sivan,</b> and <b>on the twenty-ninth of Av. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say</b> that the dates are: <b>On the first of Nisan, on the first of Sivan,</b> and <b>on the twenty-ninth of Elul. And why did</b> Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon <b>say the twenty-ninth of Elul, and</b> why <b>did they not say the first of Tishrei?</b> It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the first of Tishrei <b>is</b> the <b>festival</b> of Rosh HaShana, <b>and one cannot tithe on a Festival. Consequently, they brought it earlier, to the twenty-ninth of Elul.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The beginning of <b>the new year for animal tithe is on the first of Elul. Ben Azzai says:</b> The animals born in <b>Elul are tithed by themselves,</b> due to the uncertainty as to whether the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, i.e., that the new year begins on the first of Elul, or in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon, which would mean that the new year begins on the first of Tishrei.

### Part 9
According to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon, with regard to <b>all</b> animals <b>that are born from the first of Tishrei until the twenty-ninth of Elul, those</b> animals <b>join</b> to be tithed <b>together.</b> If <b>five</b> were born <b>before Rosh HaShana and five after Rosh HaShana,</b> those animals <b>do not join</b> to be tithed <b>together.</b> If <b>five</b> were born <b>before</b> a time designated for <b>gathering and five after</b> that time designated for <b>gathering, those</b> animals <b>join</b> to be tithed <b>together. If so, why were three</b> times <b>stated</b> for <b>gathering</b> the animals <b>for animal tithe?</b> The reason is <b>that until the</b> time designated for <b>gathering arrives</b> it is <b>permitted to sell and slaughter</b> the animals. Once <b>the</b> time designated for <b>gathering arrives one may not slaughter</b> those animals before tithing them; <b>but if he slaughtered</b> an animal without tithing it he is <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that there are three times during the year designated for gathering the animals born since the last date for animal tithe. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about these dates, i.e., why are there specifically <b>three</b> times designated in the year? <b>Rabba bar Sheila said:</b> There are three times in order <b>to collect</b> the animals born <b>early</b> in winter, <b>and</b> the animals born <b>later</b> in spring, <b>and</b> the animals born in the <b>summer.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different about these</b> three <b>times,</b> i.e., before Passover, <i>Shavuot</i>, and <i>Sukkot</i>, that they are chosen? <b>Rabbi Tanḥum, son of Rav Ḥiyya, of the village of Akko, says:</b>
