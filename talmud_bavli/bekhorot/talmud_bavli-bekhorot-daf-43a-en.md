### Part 1
There is a practical difference <b>with regard to disqualifying</b> the widow, through his <i>ḥalitza</i>, from entering into levirate marriage <b>in a case</b> where there are other <b>brothers.</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda, who maintains that this individual is certainly a eunuch whose condition is caused naturally, his <i>ḥalitza</i> is of no effect whatsoever, and therefore she may enter into levirate marriage with one of the other brothers. Conversely, according to Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, since it is possible that he is not a eunuch and his <i>ḥalitza</i> is valid, she is forbidden to the other brothers as their brother’s wife.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> there is also a practical difference <b>between their</b> opinions <b>with regard to performing <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with the widow <b>in a case where there are no brothers</b> other than this <i>tumtum</i>. According to Rabbi Yehuda, <i>ḥalitza</i> is not necessary in this case, as she requires <i>ḥalitza</i> only if her late husband had brothers who are obligated to perform levirate marriage, and this individual is definitely a eunuch whose condition is caused naturally. By contrast, Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, maintains that he must perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with her, in case he is a male and not a eunuch.
