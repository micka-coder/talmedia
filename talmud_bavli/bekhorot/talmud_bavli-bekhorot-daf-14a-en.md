### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All sacrificial</b> animals in <b>which a permanent blemish preceded their consecration</b> do not assume inherent sanctity and only their value is consecrated, <b>and</b> once <b>they were redeemed,</b> they <b>are obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>a firstborn,</b> i.e., their offspring are subject to being counted a firstborn, <b>and in the</b> priestly <b>gifts</b> of the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw, <b>and they can emerge</b> from their sacred status and assume complete <b>non-sacred</b> status in order <b>to be shorn and to be utilized for labor.</b> And <b>their offspring and their milk are permitted after their redemption.</b>

### Part 2
<b>And one who slaughters them outside</b> the Temple courtyard is <b>exempt</b> from <i>karet</i>, <b>and</b> those animals <b>do not render</b> an animal that was <b>a substitute</b> for them consecrated. <b>And if</b> these animals <b>died</b> before they were redeemed, <b>they may be redeemed</b> and fed to dogs, and they do not require burial, <b>except for the firstborn and the</b> animal <b>tithe.</b> With regard to these two types of offerings, even if they were blemished before they became consecrated they assume inherent sanctity, like other offerings that were consecrated and subsequently became blemished.

### Part 3
<b>And all</b> sacrificial animals <b>whose consecration preceded their blemish, or</b> who had <b>a temporary blemish</b> prior <b>to their consecration and afterward developed a permanent blemish and they were redeemed, they are exempt from,</b> i.e., their offspring are not counted, <b>a firstborn, and from the gifts</b> of the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw, <b>and they do not</b> completely <b>emerge</b> from their sacred status and assume <b>non-sacred</b> status in order <b>to be shorn and to be utilized for labor.</b>

### Part 4
And <b>their offspring,</b> which were conceived prior to redemption, <b>and their milk, are prohibited after their redemption. And one who slaughters them outside</b> the Temple courtyard is <b>liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i>, <b>and</b> those animals <b>render</b> an animal that was <b>a substitute</b> for them consecrated. <b>And if</b> these animals <b>died</b> before they were redeemed, they may not be redeemed and fed to dogs; rather, <b>they must be buried.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that all animals that were blemished prior to their consecration are subject to their offspring being counted a firstborn and to the obligation of the gifts once they have been redeemed. The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that they are subject to the obligations of a firstborn and the gifts is <b>that they were redeemed. But if they were not redeemed, they are exempt from</b> their offspring being counted <b>a firstborn and from the</b> obligation of the priestly <b>gifts.</b> The Gemara comments: This indicates that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>holds: Sanctity</b> that inheres in an animal’s <b>value defers,</b> i.e., renders it exempt, <b>from</b> the mitzva <b>of the firstborn and from the gifts.</b>

### Part 6
§ The mishna further teaches: <b>And they can emerge</b> from their sacred status and assume complete <b>non-sacred</b> status in order to be shorn and to be utilized for labor. The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> they become non-sacred is <b>that they were redeemed. But if they were not redeemed,</b> they remain sacred and <b>are prohibited with regard to shearing and labor.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>This supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer, who says:</b> Animals <b>consecrated for the Temple maintenance are prohibited with regard to shearing and labor.</b> Since animals consecrated for the Temple maintenance are equivalent to animals that possess sanctity that inheres in their value, the mishna supports Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion.

### Part 7
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: The Sages <b>said: No;</b> the mishna does not necessarily support the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. It is possible that <b>it is</b> only with regard to an animal that has <b>sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>value</b> and that was consecrated <b>for the altar, which</b> can be mistakenly <b>exchanged</b> with an animal that possesses <b>inherent sanctity</b> and was likewise consecrated <b>for the altar,</b> that <b>the Sages decreed</b> that it is prohibited to shear it and perform labor <b>with it,</b> due to a concern that one might confuse it with an animal that possesses inherent sanctity and ultimately violate a Torah prohibition. <b>But</b> with regard to animals <b>consecrated for the Temple maintenance, no</b> such decree was issued, as this concern does not apply.

### Part 8
§ The mishna teaches that <b>their offspring and their milk are permitted</b> after their redemption. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case of the mishna, in which the offspring of blemished redeemed animals are permitted? <b>If we say</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the animals <b>became pregnant and gave birth after their redemption,</b> then it is <b>obvious</b> that the offspring are permitted, as <b>they are non-sacred</b> animals from the moment of conception. <b>Rather,</b> it must be referring to a case <b>where they became pregnant before their redemption, and gave birth after their redemption,</b> and the mishna is teaching that the offspring are permitted despite the fact they were conceived while their mothers were consecrated.

### Part 9
The Gemara infers from this ruling: <b>But</b> if the animals gave birth <b>before their redemption,</b> the offspring <b>are prohibited</b> until they are redeemed.
