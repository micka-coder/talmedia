### Part 1
The reason is <b>so that animals will be</b> readily <b>available to</b> those <b>ascending</b> to Jerusalem <b>for the pilgrimage Festivals.</b> The animals are tithed shortly before each of the Festivals so that their owners will refrain from selling or killing them until those times, when they gather them together to set aside the animal tithe. As a result, there are plenty of non-sacred animals ready to be sold, for food or offerings, to those on their way to Jerusalem.

### Part 2
<b>And even though we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Until the</b> time designated for <b>gathering arrives,</b> it is <b>permitted to sell and slaughter</b> the animals, which means that there is no obligation to keep the animals until those dates and there is no concern that the owners will sell the animals before tithing them. This is because a person <b>prefers to perform a mitzva with his money,</b> by separating the animal tithe, <b>and</b> only <b>afterward sell or eat</b> those animals.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And why does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>call</b> the time designated for gathering animal tithe <b><i>goren</i>,</b> which literally means threshing floor? The Gemara explains that it is due to the fact <b>that</b> the arrival of this time <b>renders</b> the halakhic status of new animals like that of <b>untithed produce</b> gathered <b>on a threshing floor,</b> as from the time that produce is gathered on the threshing floor one becomes obligated to tithe it. Likewise, from this stage onward it is prohibited to slaughter the new animals until they have been tithed.

### Part 4
The mishna states that according to Rabbi Akiva the times for tithing animals are adjacent to Passover, <i>Shavuot</i>, and <i>Sukkot</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much is adjacent [<i>peras</i>]? Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, explained</b> that the term <b>adjacent</b> means <b>not less than fifteen days.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this <b>inferred? Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that the term <b><i>peros</i></b> means <b>half.</b> The Gemara inquires: <b>Half of what?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Half of</b> the time during which one must learn <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover,</b> and this is <b>like that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One asks</b> about <b>and teaches the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover</b> for <b>thirty days before Passover. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> One begins studying those <i>halakhot</i> <b>two weeks</b> before the Festival.

### Part 6
§ The mishna states that <b>ben Azzai says</b> the times are <b>on the twenty-ninth of Adar, on the first of Sivan,</b> and on the twenty-ninth of Av. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do Rabbi Akiva,</b> who says fifteen days before Passover, <b>and ben Azzai,</b> who refers to the twenty-ninth of Adar, <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that the month of <b>Adar that</b> immediately <b>precedes Nisan is sometimes a full</b> month of thirty days <b>and sometimes a defective</b> month of only twenty-nine days. Therefore, <b>sometimes</b> the fifteenth day before Passover <b>occurs on the thirtieth</b> of Adar <b>and sometimes it occurs on the twenty-ninth</b> of Adar. <b>Due to that</b> reason Rabbi Akiva <b>does not fix a time</b> by date, but simply states fifteen days before Passover. <b>And ben Azzai holds</b> that the <b>Adar that</b> immediately <b>precedes Nisan is always defective. Therefore, he fixes a time</b> in the calendar that the animals must be tithed, which is <b>on the twenty-ninth of Adar.</b>

### Part 7
With regard to the fact that ben Azzai does not require fifteen days before <i>Shavuot</i> but maintains that the animals must be tithed on <b>the first of Sivan,</b> the reason is that <b>since</b> there are <b>not</b> so <b>many</b> animals born between the previous time of tithing and this one, <b>if you say that</b> the owner <b>should tithe earlier,</b> then <b>before the pilgrimage Festival arrives</b> all the animals will already be gone, their sales having been <b>completed.</b> If so, there will be no animals remaining for those coming to Jerusalem for <i>Shavuot</i>.

### Part 8
The mishna teaches that ben Azzai says the last gathering time is <b>on the twenty-ninth of Av,</b> rather than fifteen days before <i>Sukkot</i>. The Gemara notes that <b>ben Azzai</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he said: The</b> animals born <b>in Elul are tithed by themselves,</b> because it is uncertain whether the new year for animal tithes begins on the first of Tishrei or the first of Elul. Consequently, he sets the time for animal tithe before the beginning of Elul to avoid the possibility of tithing animals born in one year with animals born in the next year.

### Part 9
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> him require that <b>one tithe</b> the animals <b>on the thirtieth day</b> of Av, which is the last day before Elul begins. The Gemara explains: <b>Sometimes</b> the month <b>of Av is defective,</b> i.e., it has only twenty-nine days, and therefore the thirtieth day after the start of Av is the first day of Elul. <b>And we are required to implement a distinction between the new</b> animals born in Elul <b>and the old</b> animals born in Av, which is considered to be the previous year.

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say</b> that the times are <b>on the first of Nisan, on the first of Sivan,</b> and on the twenty-ninth of Elul. The Gemara explains with regard to the first date: <b>On the first of Nisan,</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who says</b> one begins studying and teaching the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover <b>two weeks</b> before the Festival. And Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon hold that the second time for animal tithe is <b>on the first of Sivan,</b> and this is <b>as we said</b> with regard to the opinion of ben Azzai, so that there will be enough animals born since the previous time.

### Part 11
Finally, they hold that the third time for animal tithe is <b>on the twenty-ninth of Elul,</b> since <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon</b> conform <b>to their</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as they say: On the first of Tishrei</b> is the <b>new year for animal tithe.</b> All animals born prior to that date belong to the previous year for tithe and are tithed as a single unit, whereas those born after that date belong to the next year for tithe, and therefore there is a distinction drawn between the new animals and the old.

### Part 12
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And why did</b> Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon <b>say the twenty-ninth of Elul and</b> why <b>did they not say the first of Tishrei?</b> It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the first of Tishrei <b>is</b> the <b>festival</b> of Rosh HaShana and one cannot tithe on a Festival; consequently, they brought it earlier, to the twenty-ninth of Elul. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But let</b> the mishna <b>derive it</b> from the fact <b>that we require a distinction between the new</b> animals born in Tishrei <b>and the old</b> animals born in Elul, which is considered to be the previous year.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>states one</b> reason <b>and</b> adds <b>another. One</b> reason is <b>that we require a distinction between the new</b> animals <b>and the old</b> animals. <b>And another</b> reason is <b>because it is</b> the <b>festival</b> of Rosh HaShana <b>and one cannot tithe on a Festival, due to the <i>sakreta</i>,</b> a lead-based red paint for marking every tenth animal, as explained on 58b. It is prohibited to apply paint on a Festival.

### Part 14
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The beginning of <b>the new year for animal tithe is on the first of Elul. Ben Azzai says:</b> The animals born in Elul are tithed by themselves, due to the uncertainty as to whether the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir or in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon. The Gemara notes that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>ben Azzai said: Since these</b> Rabbis, Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon, <b>say this,</b> that the first of Tishrei is the beginning of the new year for animal tithe, <b>and those,</b> i.e., Rabbi Meir, <b>say that</b> the first of Elul is the beginning of the new year for animal tithe, <b>the</b> animals born in <b>Elul are tithed by themselves.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But let</b> ben Azzai <b>see whose opinion</b> is more <b>reasonable,</b> and decide accordingly. <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>it is not possible</b> for him <b>to establish their reasoning,</b> that is difficult: <b>But it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>ben Azzai says: All the Sages of Israel appear to me</b> to be as unimpressive in their intellect <b>as garlic peel, except for this bald</b> one, i.e., Rabbi Akiva.

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that ben Azzai was unable to establish their reasoning in this particular case, as <b>they said</b> their opinions <b>by tradition, from</b> a chain of transmission stretching back to <b>Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi,</b> the last of the prophets. Each Sage claimed his tradition concerning their ruling was the correct one. Since this dispute is based on tradition, it cannot be resolved by logical reasoning.

### Part 17
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what manner</b> did <b>ben Azzai say</b> that animals born in <b>Elul are tithed by themselves?</b> For example, if <b>five</b> animals <b>were born in Av and five</b> were born <b>in Elul, they do not combine</b> to make ten animals that require tithing. Likewise, if <b>five</b> were born <b>in Elul and five in Tishrei, they do not combine.</b> But if <b>five</b> were born <b>in Tishrei and five</b> were born <b>in</b> the following <b>Av, they do combine.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious;</b> what is the novelty of the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>? The Gemara answers: This ruling is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>just as years separate</b> between animals that may be tithed together, so too, the designated times for <b>gathering</b> and tithing the animals <b>separate</b> between those animals born before and after each one of them. If so, animals born in Tishrei and those born in the following Av would not combine. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that these designated times do not prevent animals born before and after them from being tithed together.

### Part 19
This is <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>five</b> were born <b>before Rosh HaShana and five after Rosh HaShana,</b> those animals <b>do not combine</b> to be tithed; if <b>five</b> were born <b>before</b> the time designated for <b>gathering and five after</b> the time designated for <b>gathering, those</b> animals <b>combine</b> to be tithed.

### Part 20
<b>Rava says: According to the statement of ben Azzai,</b> if <b>five</b> animals <b>were born in Av and five</b> animals were born <b>in Elul and five</b> animals were born <b>in Tishrei,</b> the owner <b>gathers them</b> all <b>in a pen to be tithed,</b>
