### Part 1
<b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> The mitzva of redeeming a firstborn donkey takes effect immediately after it is born, as is stated in the first <i>baraita</i>. The second <i>baraita</i>, which states that it applies only after thirty days, means <b>to say that</b> until that time, <b>one does not transgress</b> a prohibition if he has not yet performed the redemption. After thirty days, though, one transgresses a prohibition if he still has not redeemed his firstborn donkey.

### Part 2
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raises an objection</b> to Rav Sheshet from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The mitzva of</b> a firstborn donkey applies <b>throughout</b> the period of <b>thirty days</b> from its birth; <b>from that</b> point <b>forward he must either redeem it</b> immediately <b>or break its neck. What,</b> does it <b>not</b> mean that there is <b>a mitzva to wait</b> to redeem <b>it</b> until <b>all thirty days</b> have passed? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it means that there is <b>a mitzva to redeem it throughout</b> the period of <b>thirty days,</b> and after that point one has transgressed a prohibition.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> it <b>should have</b> stated: <b>From that</b> point <b>forward, either he redeems it or he transgresses</b> a prohibition, rather than stating: From that point forward he must either redeem it or break its neck. <b>Rather, Rava says:</b> The contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i> is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that the redemption is performed after thirty days, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who compares</b> the redemption of a firstborn donkey to the redemption of a woman’s firstborn son, where it is stated: “From a month old shall you redeem them” (Numbers 18:16). <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that one must perform the mitzva immediately, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who do not compare</b> the two mitzvot of redemption.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one did not wish to redeem</b> the firstborn donkey, <b>he breaks its neck from behind and buries it. The mitzva of redeeming</b> the firstborn donkey <b>takes precedence over the mitzva of breaking the neck, as it is stated: “If you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck”</b> (Exodus 13:13).

### Part 5
The mishna proceeds to enumerate other mitzvot in which one option takes precedence over another. <b>The mitzva of designating</b> a Hebrew maidservant to be betrothed to her master <b>takes precedence over the mitzva of redeeming</b> the maidservant from her master with money, <b>as it is stated:</b> “If she does not please her master, <b>who has not betrothed her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed”</b> (Exodus 21:8).

### Part 6
<b>The mitzva of levirate marriage takes precedence over the mitzva of <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> which dissolves the levirate bond, as it is stated: “And if the man does not wish to take his brother’s wife” (Deuteronomy 25:7). The mishna adds: This was the case <b>initially, when</b> people <b>would intend</b> that their performance of levirate marriage be <b>for the sake of the mitzva. But now that they do not intend</b> that their performance of levirate marriage be <b>for the sake of the mitzva,</b> but rather for reasons such as the beauty of the <i>yevama</i> or for financial gain, the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>the mitzva of <i>ḥalitza</i> takes precedence over the mitzva of levirate marriage.</b>

### Part 7
With regard to a non-kosher animal that was consecrated to the Temple, <b>the mitzva of redemption by the owner</b> who consecrated it <b>takes precedence over</b> redemption by <b>any</b> other <b>person, as it is stated:</b> “And if it is of a non-kosher animal…<b>and if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:27).
