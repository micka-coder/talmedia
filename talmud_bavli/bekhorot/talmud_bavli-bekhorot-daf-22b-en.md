Nevertheless, the mixture may not be allowed to come in contact with water, so that it does not become susceptible to ritual impurity, <b>and</b> therefore it must <b>be eaten dry or roasted. Or</b> alternatively, <b>it may be kneaded with fruit juice,</b> which does not render a substance susceptible to impurity. <b>Or</b> alternatively, if one wants to knead it with water, <b>it may divided</b> into <b>small batches, provided that</b> there is <b>not an egg-bulk</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>in a single</b> batch, as an egg-bulk is the minimum volume needed for food to be susceptible to contracting impurity.
