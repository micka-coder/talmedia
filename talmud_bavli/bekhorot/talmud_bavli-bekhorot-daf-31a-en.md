### Part 1
With regard to an <i>am ha’aretz</i> who accepts upon himself the stringent practices of a <i>ḥaver</i>, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of them, when they retract</b> and return to being <i>amei ha’aretz</i>, <b>they are never accepted</b> as <i>ḥaverim</i>; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If <b>they retracted in private,</b> while in public they continue to act as <i>ḥaverim</i>, <b>they are not accepted,</b> but if they retract <b>in public [<i>befarheseya</i>], they are accepted,</b> as they can be trusted.

### Part 2
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> another version of this discussion: If <b>they performed their actions</b> as <i>ḥaverim</i> even <b>in private,</b> when they initially accepted the status of <i>ḥaverim</i>, then <b>they are accepted</b> when they wish to return to that status. Conversely, if they performed their actions as <i>ḥaverim</i> only <b>in public, they are not accepted.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa say: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case <b>they are accepted, as it is stated: “Return, you backsliding children;</b> I will heal your backslidings” (Jeremiah 3:22). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak of the village of Akko says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that pair,</b> Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa, i.e., those who return are accepted in both cases.

### Part 4
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Initially,</b> the Sages <b>would say</b> with regard to one who is <b>a <i>ḥaver</i> and became</b> a tax <b>collector</b> that <b>he is rejected from his</b> status as <b>a <i>ḥaver</i>.</b> Even if he later <b>resigns</b> from his position as a tax collector, <b>he is not accepted.</b> In later generations <b>they went back to saying</b> that if <b>he resigns</b> from his position as a tax collector <b>he is like any other person</b> and may be accepted once again as a <i>ḥaver</i>.

### Part 5
The Gemara relates that one <b>time</b> the Sages <b>needed Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya</b> for a certain matter. <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef and four hundred pairs of Sages ascended to his</b> home. When <b>he heard that they were coming,</b> he <b>tied</b> for <b>them four hundred chairs [<i>takhtekei</i>]</b> to sit on. <b>Eventually</b> the Sages <b>heard that he had become</b> a tax <b>collector. They sent him</b> the following message: <b>Go to your</b> important position as a tax collector, and <b>go to your former</b> status, as we no longer need you. <b>He sent to them</b> the following message: <b>I have repented</b> and am no longer a tax collector. <b>Rav Yosef did not go</b> to him, but <b>Rabba went</b> to him.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> in explanation of why he did not go: <b>We learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that even if such an individual <b>resigns</b> from his position as a tax collector <b>he is not accepted. Rabba said: We learn</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that in later generations <b>they went back to saying</b> that if <b>he resigns</b> from his position as a tax collector <b>he is like any other person</b> and may be accepted once again as a <i>ḥaver</i>.

### Part 7
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may inspect all firstborns</b> for blemishes <b>except for his own</b> firstborns, as he has a vested interest. <b>And</b> despite his vested interest in these cases, one may <b>inspect his own sanctified animals</b> that he consecrated for the Temple, to determine whether they have blemishes and may be redeemed; <b>and</b> he may inspect <b>his</b> animal <b>tithes</b> to decide whether they are fit for sacrifice in the Temple; <b>and</b> one <b>may ask</b> himself <b>with regard to his ritually pure</b> foods, i.e., he may decide for himself whether or not they have become impure, and he is not suspected of claiming that impure food is actually pure.

### Part 8
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said: A person may inspect all firstborns except for his own</b> firstborns. <b>What are we dealing with</b> here? <b>If we say</b> that we are dealing with a case <b>of one</b> person examining a blemish, <b>is he trusted</b> by himself to deem any firstborn animal permitted for slaughter? The mishna on 36b states that only three people may permit a firstborn animal to be slaughtered. <b>Rather,</b> it must be dealing with one <b>of three</b> who jointly decide the status of the firstborn animal. <b>And is he suspect</b> in such a case? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 25b): A judge before whom a woman <b>performed refusal</b> when she was a minor, by declaring that she did not desire the husband chosen for her by her family, <b>or before whom she performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, may marry her,because</b> he was only one member of <b>the court,</b> and therefore there is no suspicion of conflict of interest?

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> we are dealing with a case <b>of a single</b> judge, <b>and</b> this is <b>as Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> with regard to a different matter: Vows may be dissolved even <b>by a single expert,</b> and a three-member court is not always necessary. <b>Here too,</b> we are dealing <b>with a single expert</b> who deems the firstborn animal permitted. A single expert may rule with regard to the firstborn animals belonging to others, but not his own animals, due to his vested interest.

### Part 10
The Gemara analyzes the last section of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>And</b> despite his vested interest, one may <b>inspect his own sanctified animals.</b> Why is it permitted for him to inspect them? The reason is <b>that if he wants</b> to avoid giving the animal to the Temple, he can <b>issue a request</b> from a halakhic authority to annul his oath. Consequently, he does not truly have a vested interest.

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> also teaches: <b>And</b> he may rule with regard to <b>his</b> own animal <b>tithes</b> to decide whether they are fit to be sacrificed in the Temple. The Gemara explains that the reason is <b>that if he wants</b> to avoid bringing the animals as offerings, he can <b>inflict a blemish upon his entire herd</b> before separating the tithe, which would render them all unfit for sacrifice in the Temple.

### Part 12
Finally, the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And</b> one <b>may ask</b> himself <b>with regard to his ritually pure</b> foods, i.e., he may decide for himself whether or not they have become impure, and he is not suspected of claiming that impure food is actually pure. The Gemara explains that his vested interested in this case is not so great, <b>as</b> the food <b>is fit for him</b> to eat <b>in his days of impurity.</b>
