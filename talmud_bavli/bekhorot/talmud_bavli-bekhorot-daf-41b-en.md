### Part 1
<b>Rava raises a dilemma: What is the reason of Rabbi Yishmael</b> that a hermaphrodite is definitely blemished? Is it <b>obvious to him</b> that <b>a hermaphrodite</b> animal <b>is</b> a male that has <b>firstborn</b> status, <b>and</b> it comes <b>with its blemish,</b> i.e., the female sex organ, and therefore it is permitted to slaughter it outside the Temple? <b>Or perhaps</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>is uncertain</b> whether or not a hermaphrodite is considered a male, <b>and he says</b> his ruling in the manner of: <b>If you say.</b> In other words, <b>if you say</b> that a hermaphrodite animal <b>is a firstborn,</b> it comes <b>with its blemish,</b> and it may be slaughtered outside the Temple.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> between the reasons? The Gemara answers that there is a difference with regard <b>to being flogged on account of</b> this animal <b>due to</b> violating the prohibition of <b>shearing and</b> utilizing a firstborn animal for <b>labor</b> (see Deuteronomy 15:19). If it is definitely a firstborn, then one would be flogged for violating the prohibition. But if one is uncertain whether it is a firstborn, although one may not shear it or perform labor with it, one is not liable to flogging for doing so. <b>Alternatively,</b> there is a difference with regard <b>to giving it to a priest.</b> If its status is uncertain, the priest cannot demand the animal from him, in accordance with the principle that the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.

### Part 3
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Ilai says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: A hermaphrodite is a firstborn, and</b> it comes <b>with its blemish. Learn from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that it is <b>obvious to Rabbi Yishmael</b> that a hermaphrodite is a firstborn. The Gemara responds: <b>But perhaps he said</b> his ruling in the manner of: <b>If you say,</b> as explained earlier.

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another <i>baraita</i>. It states with regard to a burnt offering from cattle: <b>“A male”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), from which it can be inferred: <b>But not a female. When it says below,</b> with regard to a burnt offering from sheep: <b>“A male”</b> (Leviticus 1:10), a second time, it is difficult to understand, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this. <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> “a male” again? This serves <b>to exclude a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite,</b> which are disqualified from being sacrificed as burnt offerings.

### Part 5
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Whose</b> opinion is this? <b>If we say</b> it is the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna, who maintains that a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite may not be slaughtered in the Temple or in the rest of the country, then the status of a hermaphrodite <b>is uncertain,</b> as it is unknown whether it is male or female. <b>But</b> does <b>a verse come to exclude</b> a case of <b>uncertainty?</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the latter Rabbis</b> in the mishna, who hold that a hermaphrodite is definitely not a male, but a distinct entity. Therefore, it is necessary for a verse to exclude it. This, too, is difficult, as according to these Rabbis the exclusion of a female, a <i>tumtum</i>, and a hermaphrodite is <b>derived from one verse</b> alone. The Gemara elaborates: <b>As with regard to a firstborn, it is one “male” alone that is written,</b> from which the Rabbis <b>exclude all</b> of the three categories <b>from</b> firstborn status. By contrast, the <i>baraita</i> excludes a female from one mention of the word “male” and a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite from another mention of the word “male.”

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael. And</b> in that case, <b>granted, if you say</b> that it is <b>obvious to Rabbi Yishmael</b> that a hermaphrodite is a firstborn male, <b>that is</b> why <b>a verse was necessary to exclude</b> a hermaphrodite from being brought as a burnt offering. <b>But if you say</b> that Rabbi Yishmael <b>is uncertain</b> whether or not a hermaphrodite is considered a male, is it <b>necessary</b> for <b>the verse to exclude</b> a case of <b>uncertainty?</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the latter Rabbis,</b> who maintain that a hermaphrodite is not a male, but a distinct entity. <b>And</b> as for the difficulty that in the case of a firstborn they excluded a female, a <i>tumtum</i>, and a hermaphrodite from a single verse, that is not so. <b>With regard to a firstborn</b> there are also <b>two verses written: “Males”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19), and: <b>“That is a male”</b> (Exodus 13:12). As in the case of a burnt offering, one of these serves to exclude a female, while the other serves to exclude a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite.

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> A hermaphrodite <b>does not</b> have <b>firstborn</b> status; rather, its status is that of a non-sacred animal that may be shorn and utilized for labor. <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> This <b>dispute</b> applies <b>to a hermaphrodite,</b> which the Rabbis maintain is a distinct entity, as it has both male and female sex organs, and therefore it does not have firstborn status. <b>But with regard to a <i>tumtum</i>,</b> whose genitalia is covered by skin, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>it is an uncertain</b> case, as it is definitely either a male or a female, but there is uncertainty as to which it is. <b>And</b> consequently, it is <b>consecrated due to uncertainty,</b> and it may not be slaughtered either in the Temple or in the rest of the country.

### Part 10
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>If that is so,</b> that a <i>tumtum</i> is certainly either a male or a female, <b>with regard to valuations,</b> when someone vows to give the valuation of a <i>tumtum</i>, <b>it should be valuated,</b> either in accordance with the valuation of a man or a woman.
