### Part 1
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one wishes to know how much to give for the redemption of the firstborn son, take <b>the worn-out</b> gold <b>dinars of Hadrian</b> and <b>Trajan, which are sold at twenty-five dinars,</b> and <b>deduct from them one-sixth. And these</b> that remain are the five <i>sela</i> that one must give <b>for the redemption of the</b> firstborn <b>son,</b> i.e., twenty dinars, as there are four dinars in a <i>sela</i>. The Gemara challenges: After deducting one- sixth from twenty-five, one <b>is</b> not left with twenty dinars, but <b>twenty-one</b> dinars <b>less one-sixth [<i>danka</i>]</b> of a dinar.

### Part 2
<b>Rather, deduct one-sixth and</b> another <b>dinar, and these</b> that are left are <b>for the redemption of the</b> firstborn <b>son.</b> The Gemara challenges: But the calculation is <b>still</b> inexact, as this sum is <b>twenty</b> dinars <b>less one-sixth</b> of a dinar. <b>Rather,</b> first <b>deduct</b> one <b>dinar, and</b> from the remainder, i.e., twenty-four dinars, deduct <b>one-sixth, and these</b> that are left are the five <i>sela</i> coins that one must give <b>for the redemption of the son.</b> The Gemara notes <b>that these are</b> a weight of <b>twenty <i>matkalei</i> of</b> the small golden <b>dinars</b> known as <b><i>matkalei</i>, which are</b> worth <b>twenty-eight and a half dinars, and half of a sixth</b> of a dinar, in Arabian silver dinars.

### Part 3
§ <b>Rava says: The biblical <i>sela</i></b> coins, i.e., the shekels that must be given for the redemption of the firstborn son, <b>are</b> each <b>three and one-third</b> dinars in weight, not four dinars. <b>As it is written: “The shekel is twenty <i>gera</i>”</b> (Exodus 30:13), <b>and we translate</b> “twenty <i>gera</i>” as <b>twenty <i>ma’a</i>. And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Six silver <i>ma’a</i></b> equal <b>a dinar.</b> If so, twenty <i>ma’a</i>, which is equal to the <i>sela</i> of the Torah, is worth three and one-third dinars.

### Part 4
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>, which discusses the <i>halakha</i> of one who redeems an ancestral field from the Temple treasury. The Torah states that one who consecrates his field in the Jubilee year gives as its redemption, for each of the upcoming forty-nine years, fifty <i>sela</i> for each area fit for the sowing of a <i>kor</i> of barley seed. In this regard, the Sages have said that one gives a <i>sela</i> and a <i>pundeyon</i>, which is half a <i>ma’a</i>, per year. The <i>baraita</i> notes a discrepancy here: <b>But</b> in <b>the <i>sela</i></b> coins <b>of the Sanctuary</b> there are <b>forty-eight <i>pundeyon</i>,</b> which means that according to the statement of the Sages, the redemption for forty-nine years amounts to forty-nine <i>sela</i> and forty-nine <i>pundeyon</i>, i.e., fifty <i>sela</i> and a <i>pundeyon</i>, one <i>pundeyon</i> more than the sum required by the Torah.

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>This <i>pundeyon</i>, what is its function?</b> It is <b>a premium [<i>kilbon</i>] for exchanging</b> the <i>sela</i> into <i>pundeyon</i>. In any case, this <i>baraita</i> teaches that there are forty-eight <i>pundeyon</i> in the <i>sela</i> of the Torah, which is twenty-four <i>ma’a</i>. This contradicts the statement of Rava, who said that the <i>sela</i> of the Torah is worth only twenty <i>ma’a</i>.

### Part 6
The Gemara answers that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the period <b>after</b> the Sages <b>added</b> one-sixth <b>to</b> the coins, i.e., four <i>ma’a</i> to each <i>sela</i>. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the verse: <b>“Twenty <i>gera</i></b> shall be <b>the shekel”</b> (Leviticus 27:25): <b>We learn</b> from here <b>with regard to the shekel</b> mentioned in the Torah <b>that it is twenty <i>gera</i>. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if one wants to add</b> to the number of <i>ma’a</i> in the shekel <b>he may add? The verse states:</b> “Twenty <i>gera</i> <b>shall be</b> the shekel,” whereby the term “shall be” denotes an increase. One <b>might</b> have thought that one <b>may reduce</b> the number of <i>ma’a</i> in the shekel to fewer than twenty. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The same</b> is twenty <i>gera</i>” (Numbers 18:16), i.e., it may not be fewer than that.

### Part 7
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ashi sent seventeen dinars to Rav Aḥa, son of Ravina,</b> a priest, <b>for the redemption of the</b> firstborn <b>son.</b> Along with the money, Rav Ashi <b>sent him</b> the following message: <b>Let the Master send me</b> back <b>the extra one-third</b> of a dinar <b>that is</b> included <b>in</b> the sum. Since according to Rava the <i>sela</i> of the Torah is worth three and one-third dinars, five <i>sela</i> amount to sixteen dinars and two-thirds, which is one-third less than the seventeen dinars he sent. Rav Aḥa <b>sent him</b> in response: <b>Let the Master send me the other three</b> dinars <b>that</b> the Sages <b>added to them,</b> since after the Sages added to the <i>sela</i> of the Torah, five <i>sela</i> are equal to twenty dinars, three more than the seventeen Rav Ashi sent.

### Part 8
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the value of coins. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: Any silver</b> shekel <b>that is stated in the Torah</b> but which is <b>unspecified</b> is referring to one <b><i>sela</i>.</b> Additionally, any unspecified silver shekel mentioned <b>in the Prophets</b> is a silver <b><i>litra</i>,</b> weighing twenty-five <i>sela</i>, and any unspecified silver shekel mentioned <b>in the Writings</b> is in <b>centenaria [<i>kintarin</i>],</b> silver weighing one hundred <i>sela</i>. This is the case throughout the Bible <b>except for the silver of Ephron, where even though it is written in the Torah:</b> “Shekels of silver,” <b>without specification,</b> it is in <b>centenaria, as it is written: “Four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant”</b> (Genesis 23:16). This means that the silver was acceptable as shekels everywhere, <b>and there is a place where they call a centenarius a shekel.</b>

### Part 9
With regard to the worn-out dinars of Hadrian and Trajan mentioned earlier, <b>Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> The Sages <b>wished to sequester all the silver and gold in the world because of the silver and gold of Jerusalem,</b> i.e., that which was kept in the Temple treasury and was appropriated by gentiles and mixed with other silver and gold. They did not permit its use <b>until they found a verse in the Torah</b> indicating <b>that it is permitted, as it is stated: “And robbers shall enter into it, and profane it”</b> (Ezekiel 7:22). This verse teaches that once robbers plundered the silver and gold it is profaned and does not retain its sanctity.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And is Jerusalem the majority of the world</b> such that that all of the silver and gold of the world should be prohibited due to a concern that it comes from Jerusalem? <b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> The Sages <b>wished to sequester all the worn-out dinars of Hadrian and Trajan because of the coins of Jerusalem,</b> as these coins contained a large quantity of the Temple treasury’s gold and silver, <b>until they found a verse in the Torah</b> indicating <b>that it is permitted, as it is stated: “And robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.”</b>
