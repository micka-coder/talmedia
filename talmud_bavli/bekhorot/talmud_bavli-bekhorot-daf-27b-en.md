### Part 1
<b>But do we have sprinkling</b> of the ashes of the red heifer? Since without such sprinkling one remains impure after contact with a corpse, how does it help to immerse in a ritual bath? <b>Rami bar Ḥama said to him: Shouldn’t</b> Rav Naḥman <b>be concerned for</b> the opinion <b>of the old man,</b> i.e., Rav Amram? Wouldn’t it be better to wait until he returns before answering? <b>Meanwhile, Rav Amram came</b> back. <b>He said to them</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>Rav says:</b> One who became impure with <b>impurity</b> imparted by <b>a corpse may immerse and partake of <i>teruma</i> from</b> produce grown <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.

### Part 2
The Gemara comments: <b>But the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with his</b> opinion. <b>Mar Zutra said in the name of Rav Sheshet:</b> One who became <b>impure</b> through contact with the carcass of <b>a creeping animal may immerse</b> in a ritual bath <b>and partake of <i>teruma</i> from</b> produce grown <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. <b>But the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with his</b> opinion.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches: <b>The firstborn animal is eaten year by year,</b> i.e., within its first year, whether it is blemished or unblemished. The Gemara comments: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>says: If a blemish developed within its</b> first <b>year,</b> rather than within the first year, that is <b>to say that we count</b> according <b>to its year,</b> not by the calendar year. In other words, the year is calculated from the day of the animal’s birth. <b>From where is this matter</b> derived?

### Part 4
It is derived from a verse, <b>as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says that the verse states: “You shall eat it before the Lord your God, year by year [<i>shana beshana</i>]</b> in the place that the Lord shall choose, you and your household” (Deuteronomy 15:20). The phrase “<i>shana beshana</i>,” which can also be translated as: A year in a year, indicates that the verse is referring to one year that enters another year. <b>Which</b> type of <b>year enters another</b> year? <b>You must say</b> that this is speaking of the <b>year of the firstborn</b> animal, which enters the following calendar year, since if the animal is born in the middle of the year, its first year includes part of the subsequent calendar year.

### Part 5
<b>The school of Rav taught</b> that there is a different <i>halakha</i> derived from the phrase <b>“year by year.”</b> This phrase indicates that it may be eaten on <b>one day of this year and one day of that</b> next <b>year.</b> The verse thereby <b>taught with regard to</b> an unblemished <b>firstborn</b> animal, which is sacrificed in the Temple, <b>that it is eaten for two days and one night,</b> like a peace offering.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> does <b>the school of Rav</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that a firstborn must be eaten within its own year and that its year is not calculated according to the calendar year? <b>They derive it from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of other <b>sacrificial</b> animals, whose age is counted from their birth rather than by the calendar year. <b>And</b> with regard to the other <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>themselves, from where do we</b> derive that their age is counted from their birth? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov says</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “And when the days of her purification are fulfilled, for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring <b>a lamb in its first year</b> for a burnt offering, and a pigeon or a dove for a sin offering, to the door of the Tent of Meeting, to the priest” (Leviticus 12:6). This description of the lamb is referring to <b>its</b> own <b>year, and not a year of the counting of the world.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav, from where does he</b> derive that a firstborn <b>is eaten for two days and one night?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> a verse in which Moses spoke to Aaron and his sons with regard to eating the firstborn: <b>“And their flesh shall be yours, as the breast of waving and as the right thigh, it shall be yours”</b> (Numbers 18:18). <b>The verse</b> thereby <b>juxtaposed</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the firstborn <b>with the breast and thigh of a peace offering. Just as there,</b> it may be eaten for <b>two days and one night,</b> as stated explicitly in a verse (see Leviticus 7:16), <b>so too here,</b> a firstborn may be eaten for <b>two days and one night.</b>
