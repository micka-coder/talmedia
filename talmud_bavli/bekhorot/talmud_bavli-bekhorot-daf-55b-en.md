### Part 1
<b>springs that are higher</b> in the mountains than the Euphrates; how can their water come from the Euphrates? <b>Rav Mesharshiyya said: These are ladders of the Euphrates,</b> i.e., the waters of the Euphrates seep through the ground and are drawn upward to emerge from these springs.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written:</b> “And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it was separated, and became four heads…And the name of the third river is Tigris; that is the one that goes toward the east of Ashur. <b>And the fourth river is the Euphrates”</b> (Genesis 2:10, 14)? This indicates that the Euphrates, which is mentioned last, is the least of the four rivers, not the source of the other three.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov</b> who said: <b>It is the Euphrates that</b> the verse mentions <b>initially</b> as the river that went out of Eden, which divided into all the other rivers. After the other three branched out from it, the Euphrates continued to flow.

### Part 4
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says: Yuval is the name of</b> the Euphrates River where it emerges from Eden, <b>as it is stated: “For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreads out its roots by the river [<i>yuval</i>],</b> and shall not see when heat comes, but its foliage shall be luxuriant; and shall not be anxious in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit” (Jeremiah 17:8). <b>And why is it named Euphrates [<i>perat</i>]? Because its waters are fruitful [<i>parim</i>] and multiply</b> without the need for rainfall.

### Part 5
The Gemara adds that this <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel says: The river is blessed from its riverbed;</b> the additional water in the river is not from rainfall but rather from subterranean sources. <b>And</b> this statement <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion <b>of Rav, as Rav Ami says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> When <b>rain</b> falls <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>the great witness</b> attesting to that fact is <b>the Euphrates,</b> as the water flow in the Euphrates increases after the rainy season.

### Part 6
The Gemara relates that <b>Shmuel’s father fashioned a ritual bath for his daughters during the days of Nisan, and</b> placed <b>mats</b> in the Euphrates River <b>during the days of Tishrei</b> when his daughters immersed in the river. He fashioned <b>a ritual bath during the days of Nisan,</b> because <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, as Rav Ami says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> When <b>rain</b> falls <b>in the West, the great witness</b> attesting to that fact is <b>the Euphrates.</b> Shmuel’s father was concerned that <b>perhaps</b> the rainwater and snow water <b>that fell</b> and accumulated in the river <b>would exceed</b> the amount of naturally <b>flowing</b> spring water that originated in the river’s sources, <b>and the</b> flowing <b>rainwater would be the majority.</b> Rainwater purifies only when it is collected; it does not purify when it is flowing. Therefore, Shmuel’s father fashioned ritual baths of standing water for his daughters.

### Part 7
<b>And</b> he placed <b>mats during the days of Tishrei,</b> when his daughters immersed in the river itself, to give them privacy. During Tishrei the waters of the Euphrates do not come from rainwater; rather, the waters are from the river itself, and therefore immersion is valid even when that water is flowing.

### Part 8
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this statement <b>of</b> Shmuel’s, that the additional water in the Euphrates is not from rainfall but from subterranean sources, <b>disagrees</b> with another ruling that he <b>himself</b> issued. <b>As Shmuel says: Waters purify when flowing,</b> i.e., when they are not collected into a ritual bath, <b>only</b> in the <b>Euphrates during the days of Tishrei.</b> Since rain does not fall in the summer, only after the summer, in Tishrei, is it clear that the water one is immersing in is in fact river water.

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who purchases</b> an animal <b>or</b> has an animal <b>that was given to him as a gift</b> is <b>exempt from</b> separating <b>animal tithe.</b>

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rav Kahana says that the verse states:</b> “You shall not delay to offer of the fullness of your harvest, and of the outflow of your presses. <b>The firstborn of your sons you shall give to Me. So you shall do with your oxen, and with your sheep:</b> Seven days it shall be with its mother; on the eighth day you shall give it to Me” (Exodus 22:28–29).
