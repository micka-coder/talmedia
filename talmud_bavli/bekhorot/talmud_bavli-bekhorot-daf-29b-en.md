### Part 1
<b>And Rav Yehuda bar Ami says in the name of Rav Yehuda: A <i>beit haperas</i> that has been trodden</b> underfoot, thereby creating a path, is <b>pure,</b> and one no longer needs to be concerned about bones, as the entire prohibition is a stringency by rabbinic law. Nevertheless, a priest who walks through such a field may not partake of <i>teruma</i> until he has purified himself.

### Part 2
<b>Alternatively,</b> the Gemara suggests that the mishna is referring to a case where the priest becomes impure <b>with other</b> forms of <b>impurity,</b> with regard to <b>which</b> priests <b>are not admonished.</b> A priest is prohibited from becoming impure only through contact with a corpse. Yet, he may not partake of <i>teruma</i> if he becomes impure even in any other manner.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches: <b>If</b> the one examining the firstborn, or the judge, or the witness, <b>was an elderly person,</b> the one who required his services <b>transports him on a donkey.</b> And in all these cases, although it is prohibited to take wages, the one who required his services gives him his wages like the wages of a laborer, as he was unable to perform his usual labor that day. The Sages <b>taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 4:11): The owner <b>gives him his wage as</b> if he were <b>an idle laborer. Abaye says:</b> It means that he is paid <b>as a laborer</b> who is <b>idle from that</b> typical <b>labor</b> of his from which he is kept idle. In other words, he must receive the amount of money a person would be willing to accept to refrain from his current occupation and engage in the actions discussed in the mishna. This calculation accounts for both the degree of difficulty of his steady employment and the amount of his remuneration.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who is suspect with regard to firstborn</b> animals of slaughtering them and selling their meat when it is prohibited to do so, <b>one may neither purchase</b> meat <b>from him,</b> including <b>even deer meat, nor</b> may one purchase from him <b>hides that are not tanned. Rabbi Eliezer says: One</b> may <b>purchase hides of female animals from him,</b> as the <i>halakhot</i> of firstborn animals are in effect only with regard to males. <b>And one</b> may <b>not purchase bleached or dirty wool from him. But one</b> may <b>purchase spun</b> thread <b>from him, and</b> all the more so may one purchase <b>garments</b> from him.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one may not purchase from him even <b>deer meat.</b> The Gemara explains that the reason is <b>that</b> it could be <b>confused with</b> meat <b>of a calf,</b> as they are similar in appearance.

### Part 6
The mishna teaches: <b>Nor</b> may one purchase from him <b>hides that are not tanned.</b> The Gemara infers from here that <b>we</b> may <b>purchase tanned</b> hides from one who is suspect with regard to firstborn animals. The reason is that <b>if it is so that it is</b> a hide <b>of a firstborn, he would not make</b> such <b>an effort with it</b> to tan it. This is because he would <b>think: If the Sages hear that</b> this hide is from a firstborn, they will <b>cause me a loss</b> by confiscating it <b>from me.</b>

### Part 7
The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One</b> may <b>purchase hides of female animals from him,</b> as the <i>halakhot</i> of firstborn animals are in effect only with regard to males. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> People <b>know</b> the difference between the hide of a male animal and the hide of a female animal, due to the differences in anatomy.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, according to <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> why is it prohibited to purchase hides of female animals from one who is suspect with regard to firstborn animals? The Gemara answers that the first <i>tanna</i> claims as follows: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if it is permitted to purchase hides of female animals, one might <b>also</b> come to sell hides of <b>male</b> animals, as he will <b>sever the male</b> reproductive organ <b>and say</b> that <b>mice ate</b> this part of the hide. The Gemara asks: <b>And the other,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, why is he not concerned that one might cut off that part of the hide and sell it as the hide of a female? The Gemara answers that Rabbi Eliezer maintains that the <b>place of</b> the <b>mice is known,</b> i.e., one can tell by looking at the hide whether it was eaten by mice or cut with a knife.

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And one</b> may <b>not purchase bleached or dirty wool from him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that the mishna has taught that <b>we</b> may <b>not purchase bleached</b> wool <b>from him,</b> despite the fact he has expended effort in bleaching it, which indicates that it is not from a firstborn, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach that one may not purchase <b>dirty</b> wool from him? The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>is teaching one</b> case here, that of <b>wool</b> that was <b>bleached</b> and cleaned <b>from its dirt.</b>

### Part 10
The mishna teaches: <b>But one</b> may <b>purchase spun</b> thread <b>from him, and</b> all the more so one may purchase <b>garments</b> from him. The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that the mishna has taught that <b>we may purchase spun</b> thread from one who is suspect with regard to firstborn, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach that one may purchase <b>garments?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> does the mishna mean which it says: <b>Garments?</b> It is referring to <b>felt [<i>namtei</i>]</b> garments, which are not made of spun thread.

### Part 11
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who is suspect with regard to the Sabbatical</b> Year, i.e., of sowing or engaging in commerce with Sabbatical-Year produce, <b>one may not purchase flax from him, and</b> this applies <b>even</b> to <b>combed</b> flax, in which much labor and exertion was invested. <b>But one</b> may <b>purchase spun</b> thread <b>and woven</b> fabric <b>from</b> such individuals.

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that the mishna has taught that <b>we may purchase spun</b> thread from one who is suspect with regard to the Sabbatical Year, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach the case of <b>woven fabric?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> does the mishna mean when it says: <b>Woven?</b> It means wool woven into <b>chains,</b> which is not spun.

### Part 13
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who is suspect with regard to selling <i>teruma</i> under the guise of non-sacred</b> produce, <b>one</b> may <b>not purchase even water and salt from him;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says: One</b> may <b>not purchase from him any</b> item <b>that has relevance to <i>teruma</i> and tithes.</b> However, one may purchase water and salt from him, as <i>teruma</i> and tithes do not apply to them.

### Part 14
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by Rabbi Shimon’s statement that one may not purchase any item that has relevance to <i>teruma</i> and tithes from one who is suspect with regard to selling <i>teruma</i>? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon’s statement serves <b>to add fish innards</b> to this prohibition, <b>as</b> people <b>mix olive oil with them,</b> and it might be oil of <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 15
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain butcher who was suspected of selling</b>
