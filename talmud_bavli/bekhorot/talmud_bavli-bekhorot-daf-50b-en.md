### Part 1
§ <b>Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Rav Asi says: Every</b> sum of <b>money stated in the Torah without specifying</b> that it is in shekels is referring to silver dinars of <b>Tyrian coinage,</b> which have a high value. <b>And</b> every mention of coins in <b>statements of</b> the Sages is referring to <b>provincial coinage,</b> which was worth roughly one-eighth of Tyrian coinage.

### Part 2
The Gemara challenges: <b>And is</b> it an established <b>principle</b> that all money mentioned in the Torah is a silver dinar of Tyrian coinage? <b>But there is</b> the case of one who admits to part of <b>a claim that</b> he has not returned a deposit or loan, where <b>it is written: “If a man deliver to his neighbor money or vessels to guard</b> and it is stolen out of the man’s house…the cause of both parties shall come before the judges” (Exodus 22:6–8). This teaches that the case is brought to a court, where the defendant must take an oath.

### Part 3
<b>And we learned</b> in a mishna with regard to one who admits to part of a claim (<i>Shevuot</i> 38b): <b>The oath</b> administered <b>by the judges</b> to one who admits to part of a claim is administered only when <b>the claim</b> is for at least <b>two silver</b> <i>ma’a</i>, and the defendant’s admission is to at least the value of one <i>peruta</i>. If every sum of money mentioned in the Torah is referring to Tyrian coinage, how did the Sages arrive at the amount of two <i>ma’a</i> in this case?

### Part 4
The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is derived from a juxtaposition, as the “money” mentioned in the verse is <b>similar to “vessels”: Just as</b> the word <b>“vessels”</b> indicates at least <b>two, so too, “money”</b> is referring to at least <b>two</b> coins. <b>And just as money is a significant item,</b> i.e., silver <i>ma’a</i>, <b>so too,</b> the <b>vessels</b> must be <b>a significant item.</b> Rav Asi, by contrast, is referring to a mention of money where there is no juxtaposition.

### Part 5
The Gemara challenges: <b>But there is</b> the case of the redemption of second <b>tithe, as it is written: “And bind up the money in your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:25). <b>And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 2:8): With regard to <b>one who exchanges</b> copper coins <b>of second-tithe money</b> for <b>a <i>sela</i>,</b> Beit Shammai say: He may exchange the copper coins for the entire silver <i>sela</i>. This mishna indicates that second-tithe money, mentioned in the Torah, can be in the form of copper coins, and is not required to be in the form of silver coins. The Gemara explains that the verse states: <b>“Money,” “money,”</b> using the term more than once. This <b>serves as an amplification.</b> In other words, this addition teaches that second-tithe money can be in any coinage, including copper coins.

### Part 6
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>consecrated</b> property, <b>as it is written: “And he will give the money and it will be assured to him”</b> (see Leviticus 27:19). <b>And Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>consecrated</b> property <b>worth one hundred dinars, which was redeemed for</b> an item <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>, it is redeemed.</b> Although the word “money” is stated in the Torah, a copper <i>peruta</i> may be used. The Gemara answers: <b>There too,</b> there is a reason for this unusual <i>halakha</i>, as <b>he derives</b> this ruling from a verbal analogy using the term <b>“holy”</b> mentioned here and <b>“holy” from</b> second <b>tithe</b> (see Leviticus 27:14, 30). Consequently, one may use any type of coin in this case as well.

### Part 7
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> there is the case of <b>the betrothal of a woman, as it is written: “Then shall she go out for nothing, without money”</b> (Exodus 21:11). <b>And</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 2a) that <b>Beit Shammai say that</b> one can betroth her <b>with one dinar or with</b> an item that is <b>worth one dinar, and Beit Hillel say</b> one can betroth a woman <b>with one <i>peruta</i> or with</b> any item that is <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b> If so, <b>shall we say</b> that <b>Rav Asi,</b> who claims that all sums of money mentioned in the Torah are in Tyrian coinage, <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> even though the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel?

### Part 8
The Gemara suggests an alternative explanation: <b>Rather, if</b> this <b>was stated,</b> it <b>was stated like this: Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says: Every set</b> amount of <b>money stated in the Torah,</b> i.e., when a specific amount is mentioned, such as the fifty shekels paid by a rapist (Deuteronomy 22:29), is referring to <b>Tyrian coinage, and</b> any amount of money set <b>by rabbinic law</b> is in <b>provincial coinage.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>what is</b> Rav Asi <b>teaching us? We</b> already <b>learn</b> all of these <i>halakhot</i> explicitly in the mishna: The payment of <b>five <i>sela</i> for</b> the redemption of a firstborn <b>son,</b> the thirty for a Canaanite slave killed by an ox, the fifty of a rapist and of a seducer, and the one hundred of the slanderer are all paid in the shekel of the Sanctuary, which is determined based on Tyrian coinage.

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> Rav Asi to clarify that payments mentioned in <b>statements of</b> the Sages are referring to <b>provincial coinage,</b> as that <i>halakha</i> was not taught in the mishna. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 90a): The Sages established that <b>one who strikes another</b> as an act of disrespect <b>must give him a <i>sela</i></b> as a fine for striking him. <b>And</b> Rav Asi teaches: <b>Do not say</b> that this <b><i>sela</i></b> is a Tyrian <i>sela</i> worth <b>four dinars. Rather,</b> it is the <i>sela</i> of provincial coinage, which is worth <b>one-half a dinar, as people</b> commonly <b>call a one-half dinar</b> by the name <b><i>sela</i>.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara relates that <b>Ḥanan the wicked struck a certain man. He came before Rav Huna</b> for judgment, and Rav Huna <b>said to him: Go give him half a dinar,</b> which is the fine imposed for such an action. Ḥanan <b>had</b>
