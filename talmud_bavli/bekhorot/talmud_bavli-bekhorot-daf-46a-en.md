<b>to</b> the priest based <b>on the consent of the public,</b> making it a type of vow that cannot be dissolved without their consent.

### Part 2
<b>Ameimar says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is as follows: <b>Even according to the one who says a vow that was taken in public has</b> the option of <b>nullification,</b> if it was taken based <b>on the consent of the public</b> it <b>has no</b> option of <b>nullification.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And this matter applies</b> only to when the nullification of a vow is in order to enable one <b>to</b> perform <b>an optional matter, but to</b> enable one to perform <b>a matter of a mitzva it has</b> the option of <b>nullification. As</b> in the incident involving <b>a certain teacher of children,</b>upon <b>whom Rav Aḥa administered a vow</b> to cease teaching based <b>on the consent of the public, as he was negligent with regard to the children</b> by hitting them too much; <b>and Ravina</b> had his vow nullified and <b>reinstated him, as they did not find</b> another teacher <b>who was as meticulous as he</b> was.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches that a priest <b>who becomes impure</b> through exposure <b>to corpses</b> is disqualified from performing the Temple service until he accepts upon himself that he will no longer become impure in that manner. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different here that it is sufficient for him</b> merely to <b>accept</b> upon himself a commitment in order to continue serving in the Temple, <b>and what is different there,</b> where the priest marries by a transgression, <b>that we administer a vow to him?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>There his desire seizes him,</b> and it is therefore necessary for the priest to take a vow.
