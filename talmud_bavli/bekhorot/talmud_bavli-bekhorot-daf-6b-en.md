### Part 1
<b>This</b> is what it <b>is saying: You shall not eat a being that comes from</b> one of those animals that <b>chew their cud and have split hooves</b> if it itself does not have the signs of being kosher. To counter this, the continuation of <b>the verse states: “The camel…is impure</b> for you” (Leviticus 11:4). This indicates that a camel itself <b>is non-kosher, but a non-kosher</b> animal <b>that is born from a kosher</b> animal <b>is not non-kosher; rather,</b> it is <b>kosher.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> it is stated: <b>“Camel”</b> (Leviticus 11:4), <b>“camel”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:7), teaching the term <b>two times</b> with regard to the prohibition of consumption. This teaches that <b>both a camel that is born from a camel and a camel that is born from a cow</b> are non-kosher. According to Rabbi Shimon, a non-kosher animal born to a kosher animal is forbidden for consumption, in contrast to the ruling in the mishna.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, who disagree with Rabbi Shimon, <b>what do they do with this</b> repetition of <b>“camel,” “camel”?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>one</b> of the verses is written <b>to prohibit</b> the camel <b>itself and one</b> is written <b>to prohibit</b> the female camel’s <b>milk.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Shimon, from where does he</b> derive that a camel’s <b>milk is forbidden?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the phrase <b>“the camel [<i>et hagamal</i>].”</b> The verse could have stated just the term “<i>hagamal</i>.” The addition of the word “<i>et</i>” teaches that the prohibition applies also to its milk. <b>And the Rabbis do not interpret instances of “<i>et</i>”</b> as a means to derive new <i>halakhot</i>; they consider it to be an ordinary part of the sentence structure and not a source for exegetical exposition.

### Part 4
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Shimon HaAmasoni would interpret each and every</b> occurrence of the word <b>“<i>et</i>” in the Torah,</b> deriving additional <i>halakhot</i> with regard to the particular subject matter. <b>Once he reached</b> the verse: <b>“You shall fear the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13), which is written with the added word “<i>et</i>,” <b>he withdrew</b> from this method of exposition, as whose fear could be an extension of the fear of God? <b>His students said to him: Our teacher, what will be with all</b> the occurrences of <b>“</b><i>et</i><b>” that you interpreted</b> until now? Shimon HaAmasoni <b>said to them: Just as I received reward for the exposition, so I receive reward for</b> my <b>withdrawal</b> from using this method of exposition.

### Part 5
The word “<i>et</i>” in this verse was not explained <b>until Rabbi Akiva came and taught: “You shall fear the Lord your God”;</b> the word “<i>et</i>” in the verse serves <b>to include Torah scholars,</b> i.e., that one is commanded to fear them just as one fears God. In any event, Shimon HaAmasoni no longer derived additional <i>halakhot</i> from “<i>et</i>.” The Rabbis follow the conclusion of Shimon HaAmasoni that “<i>et</i>” is not expounded.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: If that is so,</b> that <b>the reason of the Rabbis</b> for the <i>halakha</i> that a camel’s milk is forbidden is that it is derived <b>from</b> the words <b>“camel,” “camel,”</b> written twice, <b>and Rabbi Shimon</b> derives it <b>from “the camel [<i>et hagamal</i>],”</b> then could it be reasoned <b>that</b> if <b>not</b> for <b>this</b> derivation <b>I would say</b> that <b>milk of a non-kosher animal is permitted?</b>

### Part 7
In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states with regard to the prohibition against eating creeping animals: “These are they <b>that are impure [<i>hateme’im</i>]</b> to you among all the creeping animals” (Leviticus 11:31). The Sages interpret the letter <i>heh</i> in the term “that are impure [<i>hateme’im</i>]” <b>to prohibit their juice</b> that oozes from their body <b>and their gravy</b> that is produced when they are cooked, <b>and sediments</b> of <b>their</b> flesh that congeal at the bottom of the dish when cooked. Evidently, any liquid that emerges from a non-kosher animal is forbidden.

### Part 8
Rav Ashi responded: The additional exposition to derive that camel’s milk is forbidden <b>was necessary,</b> because it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> it may be permitted, <b>since</b> the permissibility of consumption of the milk <b>of a kosher animal is also a novelty.</b> The milk originates from the blood, which is forbidden for consumption, <b>as the Master said</b> that the reason a nursing woman does not experience menstruation is because <b>the blood is spoiled and becomes milk. Since it is a novelty</b> that the Torah permits milk despite its origins, it might enter your mind to say that <b>with regard to a non-kosher animal it should also be permitted.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that it is forbidden.

### Part 9
The Gemara challenges: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that a nursing woman does not menstruate because <b>the blood is spoiled and becomes milk. But according to the one who says</b> that the milk does not originate from blood, but rather the reason she does not menstruate is because <b>her limbs become disjointed and her soul,</b> i.e., her health, <b>does not return to her until twenty-four months</b> later, <b>what is there to say?</b> Why does the Torah employ a verse to render forbidden the milk of a non-kosher animal?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary,</b> because it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> it may be permitted; <b>since</b> generally speaking <b>there is nothing that comes from a living</b> animal <b>that the Merciful One permits, and</b> yet <b>this milk</b> of a kosher animal <b>is similar to a limb</b> severed <b>from the living and is</b> nevertheless <b>permitted,</b> the permissibility of milk is a novelty of the Torah. <b>And consequently</b> it might enter your mind to say that <b>even</b> the milk <b>of a non-kosher animalshould be permitted</b> in line with that novelty. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that it is forbidden.

### Part 11
§ The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that the milk of a kosher animal is</b> in fact <b>permitted? If we say</b> that it is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One prohibits</b> eating <b>meat</b> that was cooked <b>in milk,</b> indicating <b>that</b> milk <b>by itself is permitted,</b> one can reject this proof <b>and say</b> that <b>milk alone is forbidden</b> only <b>for consumption but permitted with regard to</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it. By contrast, <b>meat</b> that was cooked <b>in milk is forbidden with regard to</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>as well.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And according to Rabbi Shimon, who deems</b> meat that was cooked in milk <b>permitted with regard to</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it, <b>you find</b> a reason for the Torah to mention the prohibition of meat and milk together, even if milk alone is forbidden as well, and that is in order to render one liable <b>to receive lashes for cooking them</b> together, which would not apply to cooking milk alone.

### Part 13
<b>Rather,</b> one can prove that milk is permitted for consumption <b>since the Merciful One revealed that with regard to disqualified consecrated</b> animals that were redeemed: “You may slaughter and eat meat” <b>(Deuteronomy 12:15).</b> This verse is interpreted in the following manner: <b>“You may slaughter,” but</b> you may <b>not</b> use its wool from <b>shearing.</b> You may eat its <b>“meat,” but</b> you may <b>not</b> consume its <b>milk.</b> It can be inferred from here that milk <b>of non-sacred</b> kosher animals is <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But</b> one could <b>say</b> the distinction between non-sacred milk and milk from sacrificial animals is not with regard to the permissibility of consumption. Rather, milk <b>of non-sacred</b> animals <b>is forbidden for consumption but is permitted with regard to</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it, but the milk <b>of sacrificial</b> animals is <b>forbidden with regard to</b> deriving <b>benefit as well.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rather,</b> proof may be brought that milk is permitted <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written: “And there will be goats’ milk enough for your food, for the food of your household, and maintenance for your maidens”</b> (Proverbs 27:27). According to the verse, goats’ milk serves as food, and therefore must be kosher.

### Part 16
The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>But perhaps</b> the verse is referring <b>to</b> selling the milk as <b>merchandise</b> and using the money to buy food, and not to consuming the milk itself. <b>Rather,</b> proof may be brought <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written</b> with regard to Jesse’s instructions to his son David upon sending him with provisions for his brothers, who were at war against the Philistines: <b>“And these ten cheeses</b> you shall bring to the captain of their thousand” (I Samuel 17:18), which indicates they ate dairy products.

### Part 17
The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>But perhaps</b> this verse too means the captain can sell the cheese <b>as merchandise.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Is that to say</b> that it is <b>the norm during war to</b> engage in <b>commerce?</b> Clearly the cheese was meant for consumption, which proves it is permitted to eat dairy products.

### Part 18
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that proof may be brought <b>from here:</b> The Torah praises Eretz Yisrael as: <b>“A land flowing with milk and honey”</b> (Exodus 3:17), <b>and if</b> milk <b>was not permitted, would the verse praise</b> the land <b>to us with an item that is not suitable</b> for consumption? <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead a proof <b>from here: “Come, buy, and eat; and come, buy wine and milk without money and without price”</b> (Isaiah 55:1).

### Part 19
§ The Gemara returns to the dispute between Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis, who interpret the repetition of the word “camel” as indicating the prohibitions against eating a camel born from a cow and consuming its milk, respectively, and asks: <b>But if that is so,</b> that the repetition indicates these <i>halakhot</i>, then with regard to the words: <b>“Hare,” “hare,” “rock badger,” “rock badger,” “swine,” “swine”</b> (see Leviticus 11:5–7; Deuteronomy 14:7–8), which are all mentioned twice as being forbidden, <b>do</b> these words <b>come to</b> teach <b>these</b> <i>halakhot</i> as well?

### Part 20
The Gemara explains: They are necessary <b>only for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why were</b> all of the non-kosher animals and birds <b>repeated</b> in Deuteronomy (14:7–20), after having been mentioned already in Leviticus (11:10–20)? <b>With regard to the animals,</b> it is <b>because of the <i>shesua</i></b> (see Deuteronomy 14:7), an animal with two backs and two spines, which is not mentioned in Leviticus, <b>and with regard to the birds,</b> it is <b>because of the <i>ra’a</i></b> (see Deuteronomy 14:13).

### Part 21
The Gemara challenges: If so, then the double reference of <b>“camel,” “camel,” also comes for this</b> purpose of teaching about the <i>shesua</i>, and not to teach a separate <i>halakha</i> about the camel. The Gemara explains: Nevertheless, <b>anywhere that it is</b> possible <b>to interpret</b> the verse as teaching an additional <i>halakha</i>, <b>we interpret</b> it in that manner. Only where there is no possibility of such an interpretation is the concept of repeating the passage merely to introduce one additional detail invoked.

### Part 22
§ The Gemara discusses an additional source that cites the opinion of Rabbi Shimon: <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that in the case of <b>a ewe that gave birth to a goat of sorts and a goat that gave birth to a ewe of sorts,</b> in each case the mother <b>is exempt from</b> its offspring being counted <b>a firstborn. And if it has some of the characteristics</b> of its mother, the mother <b>is obligated,</b> i.e., subject to accounting its offspring a firstborn. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The offspring does not have firstborn status <b>unless its head and the majority of</b> its body <b>are similar to</b> the appearance of <b>its mother.</b>

### Part 23
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>With regard to</b> the permissibility of <b>eating</b> a non-kosher animal that was born to a kosher animal, <b>does Rabbi Shimon require its head and most of</b> its body to resemble its mother, <b>or not,</b> and possessing some of the characteristics of its mother suffices?

### Part 24
The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>firstborn</b> status, <b>it is written: “But the firstborn of an ox”</b> (Numbers 18:17), which indicates that it does not have firstborn status <b>unless it is an ox and its firstborn is an ox.</b> If its head and most of its body do not resemble an ox, it does not have firstborn status according to Rabbi Shimon. <b>But with regard to consumption,</b> where Rabbi Shimon holds a camel born to a kosher animal is forbidden, perhaps it <b>is</b> only an ordinary-looking <b>camel that the Merciful One states is forbidden, but</b> if
