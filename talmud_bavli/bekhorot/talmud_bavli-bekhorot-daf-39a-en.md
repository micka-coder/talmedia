### Part 1
<b>or perhaps</b> does it mean it is fed the amount of a fig-bulk <b>at each and every meal? If you say</b> that it is fed a fig-bulk only <b>at the first meal,</b> is it fed this fodder <b>before</b> its regularly scheduled <b>eating or after eating?</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Before eating,</b> it is <b>certainly effective for it like a medicine,</b> which people imbibe before their meals. With regard to <b>after eating, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is this an effective manner of examining the animal? The Gemara further inquires: Is the animal fed this fodder as a medicine <b>before drinking or after drinking? Before drinking it is certainly effective for it, like barley,</b> which is fed to an animal before it drinks. With regard to <b>after drinking, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 2
The Gemara continues to inquire: Is the animal given the fodder when it is <b>tied or untied?</b> The Gemara explains: When it is <b>untied,</b> the fodder is <b>certainly effective for this</b> animal. When it is <b>tied, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Furthermore, is it fed the fodder when it is <b>by itself, or with another</b> animal? When it is <b>with another</b> animal, the fodder <b>is certainly effective for</b> this animal, as it is comfortable. When it is <b>by itself, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 3
Likewise, is the animal fed it <b>in the city or in the field?</b> When it is <b>in the field,</b> the fodder <b>is certainly effective for</b> this animal, as it is calm. When it is <b>in the city, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Ashi raises</b> a further <b>dilemma: If you say</b> that this treatment is effective only when it is <b>in the field,</b> not when it is the city, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a garden adjacent to the city?</b> No resolution is found for any of these inquiries, and with regard to each of them the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches with regard to constant pale spots that <b>Rabbi Ḥananya ben Antigonus says:</b> One examines the animal three times within eighty days. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>provided that they are divided into</b> equal <b>thirds,</b> i.e., there must be an even gap between each of these examinations.

### Part 5
With regard to the statement of the mishna that constant tears are examined by feeding the animal moist and then dry fodder for a period of three months, <b>Pineḥas, the brother of Mar Shmuel, raises a dilemma before Shmuel:</b> If the animal <b>ate</b> the fodder in the required manner <b>and was not healed,</b> which means that it is blemished, <b>is it a retroactive blemish</b> from the day it was discovered, <b>or is it a blemish from that point forward?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>with regard to</b> whether one has violated the prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>concerning its redemption</b> money in a case where a consecrated animal was redeemed before the end of the three months of examination and someone derived benefit from the money paid for its redemption. <b>If you say</b> that <b>it is a retroactive blemish,</b> he thereby <b>misuses</b> consecrated property, as the redemption was effective and the money belongs to the Temple treasury.

### Part 7
<b>But if it is a blemish from that point forward,</b> then one who derived benefit from money paid before that point has <b>not misused</b> consecrated property, as an unblemished animal cannot be redeemed, and the money remains non-sacred. <b>What,</b> then, is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Shmuel read</b> this verse <b>with regard to his</b> brother: <b>“The lame take the prey”</b> (Isaiah 33:23), i.e., one who is not learned in Torah has managed to ask a question for which I have no answer.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> For these additional blemishes, one may slaughter a firstborn animal outside the Temple: <b>Its nose that was pierced, or that was damaged</b> and is lacking, <b>or that was split.</b> Likewise, <b>its lip that was pierced,</b> or <b>that was damaged,</b> or <b>that was split</b> is considered a blemish.

### Part 9
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the case of the nose that was pierced, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>its nostrils were pierced one into the other,</b> if the perforation is visible <b>on the outside</b> of the nostril, <b>this is a blemish;</b> if it is visible only <b>on the inside</b> of the nostril, <b>it is not a blemish.</b> With regard to the case of: <b>Its lip that was pierced or that was damaged or that was split, Rav Pappa says:</b> This is referring to <b>the outer row,</b> i.e., the front, protruding part <b>of its lip.</b>

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna lists additional blemishes that permit the slaughter of the firstborn: <b>The external gums that were damaged</b> and lacking <b>or that were scratched,</b> and likewise, <b>the internal</b> gums <b>that were extracted. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: One does not examine from the double teeth,</b> i.e., the large molars that appear like two teeth, <b>and inward, and</b> one does <b>not</b> examine <b>even the</b> place of the <b>double teeth</b> themselves. This is because even if they were extracted, it is a concealed blemish, and it does not permit the slaughter of the firstborn.

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the mishna is referring to <b>the double teeth, what are the double teeth?</b> The area <b>from the double teeth and inward, and the double teeth themselves, are</b> considered <b>like the inward</b> part, i.e., the location of a concealed blemish, for which one may not slaughter the animal. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Kefutzai says: One slaughters</b> the firstborn <b>only for</b> a blemish of <b>the outer</b> teeth <b>alone. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: One does not consider the double teeth at all.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara notes that the <i>baraita</i> asks about the double teeth but does not answer the question: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>saying? And furthermore,</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Kefutzai is</b> the same as that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> as they both maintain that a blemish to the double teeth is considered a concealed blemish.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching: What</b> are <b>the inner</b> gums, for which a firstborn is not slaughtered if a blemish was found there? The inner gums are located <b>from</b> the place of <b>the double teeth and inward, and the double teeth themselves are</b> considered <b>like the inward</b> part. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that one does not slaughter the animal, <b>said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where</b> the inner gums <b>were damaged or were scratched. But</b> if <b>they were extracted, one does slaughter</b> the firstborn for this blemish.

### Part 14
The Gemara continues its interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Kefutzai says: One slaughters</b> the firstborn <b>only for</b> a blemish of <b>the outer</b> teeth. <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>inner</b> gums <b>that were extracted, one does not slaughter</b> the animal <b>for them, but it is disqualified</b> as an offering. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: One does not pay attention to the double teeth at all, and</b> a blemish there <b>does not even disqualify</b> the firstborn from sacrifice.

### Part 15
§ <b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami raises a dilemma:</b> Is <b>there</b> halakhic significance to <b>the lack of a limb</b> that is <b>internal, or is there no</b> halakhic significance to <b>the lack of a limb</b> that is <b>internal?</b> The Gemara inquires: <b>With regard to what</b> issue did he raise this dilemma? <b>If</b> it was <b>with regard to</b> whether such a blemish renders permitted the slaughter of <b>a firstborn</b> outside the Temple, <b>it is written: “Lameness or blindness”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:21), which indicates that the blemish must be exposed.

### Part 16
<b>If</b> the dilemma was raised <b>with regard to</b> whether other <b>sacrificial</b> animals with such a blemish are thereby disqualified from being sacrificed and may be redeemed, <b>it is written: “Blind or broken”</b> (Leviticus 22:22), which are also types of exposed blemishes. The Gemara explains that <b>we do not raise</b> this <b>dilemma with regard to slaughtering</b> the firstborn <b>or redeeming</b> other sacrificial animals, as it is clearly not considered a blemish to that extent. Rather, <b>we raise the dilemma with regard to disqualifying</b> the animal from sacrifice. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 17
The Gemara clarifies the dilemma. <b>The Merciful One states: “It shall be complete to be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 22:21), which indicates that <b>a complete</b> animal, <b>yes,</b> is fit as a sacrifice, but if it is <b>lacking</b> in any manner, even on the inside, it is <b>not</b> fit. <b>Or perhaps</b> one should interpret this phrase: <b>“It shall be complete to be accepted,”</b> in light of what is stated immediately afterward: <b>“There shall be no blemish therein.” Just as a blemish is on the outside,</b> as taught by the next verse, which says: “Blind or broken,” <b>so too,</b> the status of <b>lacking</b> a limb applies only if it is lacking <b>on the outside.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that this matter is subject to a dispute. It is taught in one <i>baraita</i>: When it states with regard to the burning of the sacrificial portions of a peace offering: <b>“And the two kidneys”</b> (Leviticus 3:4), this teaches that one sacrifices only an animal that has two kidneys, <b>but not</b> an animal that <b>has one kidney, nor</b> one that <b>has three kidneys. And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that when that verse states: “And the two kidneys…<b>he shall take it away,”</b> the singular form serves <b>to include</b> an animal that <b>has one kidney,</b> which may be sacrificed. Evidently, these <i>tanna’im</i> disagree as to whether an animal lacking a kidney is fit to be sacrificed.

### Part 19
The Sages initially <b>assumed that everyone</b> agrees that there is <b>no entity</b> born <b>with one</b> kidney, and only one kidney is found <b>because</b> this offering <b>became lacking</b> a kidney only after birth. If so, <b>let us say</b> that <b>they disagree about this: That</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>a lack</b> of <b>an internal</b> limb <b>is considered a lack, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>a lack</b> of <b>an internal</b> limb <b>is not considered a lack.</b>

### Part 20
<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef says:</b> There is no dispute here, <b>as everyone agrees</b> that <b>there is</b> such <b>an entity</b> born <b>with one</b> kidney, <b>and</b> everyone also agrees that the <b>lack of an internal</b> limb <b>is considered a lack</b> that disqualifies the animal. <b>And</b> the contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i> is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>where it was created with two</b> kidneys <b>and</b> one <b>is lacking,</b> the animal is disqualified. Whereas <b>there, where it was created with one</b> kidney <b>from the outset,</b> it is not lacking and therefore it is fit.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the first <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> the case of an animal that has one kidney as <b>similar</b> to that <b>of</b> an animal that <b>has three kidneys.</b> One can therefore infer: <b>Just as</b> these <b>three</b> kidneys were present <b>from the outset,</b> as an animal does not grow new limbs, <b>so too,</b> the animal with <b>one</b> kidney alone was like that <b>from the outset.</b>

### Part 22
<b>Rather,</b> everyone agrees that a lack of an internal limb is considered a lack, and <b>here</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> the matter of whether <b>there is an entity</b> created with one kidney <b>from the outset.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>there is an entity</b> created <b>with one</b> kidney, and it may be assumed that this is such an animal, and it is not lacking a limb. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>there is no entity</b> created <b>with one</b> kidney, and this animal is lacking a limb and is disqualified for sacrifice.

### Part 23
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Everyone agrees</b> that there is <b>no entity</b> born <b>with one</b> kidney, <b>and</b> that <b>a lack of an internal</b> limb <b>is considered a lack, and</b> yet it is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, it is referring to a case <b>where it lacked</b> a kidney <b>before</b> its <b>slaughter.</b> Whereas <b>there,</b> the second <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case <b>where it lacked</b> a kidney only <b>after</b> its <b>slaughter,</b> and therefore it is fit. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if the animal lacked a kidney <b>after</b> its <b>slaughter</b> but <b>before</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood in a vessel for sprinkling, <b>is it permitted</b> to sacrifice it?
