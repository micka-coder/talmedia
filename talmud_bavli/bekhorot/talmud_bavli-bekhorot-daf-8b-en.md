### Part 1
The Gemara responds: <b>Is it written:</b> Cursed are you <b>from among all beasts, and from among all animals?</b> No, <b>it is written: “From among all animals, and from among all beasts,”</b> meaning that <b>it is cursed from among the domesticated animals, which were cursed from among the undomesticated animals.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara challenges: Why must it mean that the snake was cursed more than the donkey in the same proportion that the donkey was cursed more than the cat? <b>But say</b> instead that <b>just as the domesticated animals were cursed</b> more <b>than the undomesticated animals</b> by a measure of <b>one to three;</b> the Gemara interjects: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> case <b>is that?</b> It is in the case of <b>a goat,</b> whose gestation period is five months, compared <b>to a cat,</b> whose gestation period is fifty-two days. The Gemara continues its challenge: <b>So too,</b> the snake <b>was cursed</b> more <b>than the domesticated animals,</b> i.e., the goat, by a proportion of <b>one to three, which is fifteen months.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>it is written:</b> “Cursed are you <b>from among all animals,”</b> including the most accursed of them, i.e., the donkey. <b>If you wish, say</b> instead that since <b>it is a curse</b> that the snake received here, the verse <b>imposes upon it</b> the most extreme <b>curse</b> that can be derived from the text.

### Part 4
§ With regard to the gestation time of a snake, the Gemara relates that <b>the</b> Roman <b>emperor said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya:</b> In the case of <b>a snake, after how long</b> a period of <b>gestation does it give birth?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya <b>said to him: After seven years.</b> The emperor said to him: <b>But the elders,</b> i.e., the sages, <b>of the school of Athens bred</b> snakes <b>and they gave birth after three</b> years. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya responded: <b>Those</b> snakes <b>were</b> already <b>pregnant from beforehand</b> for <b>four</b> years. The emperor asked: <b>But they engaged in intercourse,</b> and animals do so only in order to give birth, not when they are already pregnant. Rabbi Yehoshua responded: Snakes <b>also engage in intercourse like people,</b> i.e., they do not do so solely for reproduction.

### Part 5
The emperor said to him: <b>But</b> how can you disagree with the sages of Athens? <b>Aren’t they wise?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya responded: <b>We are wiser than they.</b> The emperor said: <b>If you are wiser</b> than they, then <b>go defeat them</b> in debate <b>and bring them to me.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: How many are there?</b> The emperor answered: <b>Sixty men.</b>

### Part 6
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya <b>said to him: Construct a ship that has sixty rooms for me, and each room</b> should <b>have sixty mattresses [<i>bistarkei</i>] in it.</b> The emperor <b>constructed</b> it <b>for him.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua then set out on the ship for Athens. <b>When</b> he <b>arrived there,</b> he entered <b>a butcher shop</b> and <b>found a certain man,</b> the butcher, <b>flaying an animal.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: Is your head for sale?</b> The butcher <b>said to him: Yes</b> it is. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: For how much</b> is it being sold? The butcher <b>said to him: For half a dinar.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>gave him</b> the money.

### Part 7
<b>After</b> Rabbi Yehoshua paid the butcher, <b>he said to him:</b> Did <b>I say to you</b> that I wanted <b>the head of the animal?</b> I was referring to your head, and you must now keep your word and give me your head. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: If you wish for me to let you be, go</b> and <b>show me the entrance to the school of</b> the sages of <b>Athens.</b> The butcher <b>said to him: I am afraid, as they kill anyone who shows</b> its location to another. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: Carry a bundle of reeds, and when you arrive there, stand it up like one who is resting,</b> to mark the location. The butcher did this, and Rabbi Yehoshua successfully found the entrance.

### Part 8
Rabbi Yehoshua <b>found guards</b> stationed <b>on the inside and guards</b> stationed <b>on the outside</b> to ensure that no one could enter or exit. They also spread sand on the ground in the entranceway so that they could detect if anyone entered or left. <b>If they saw footsteps that were entering</b> they would <b>kill the outer</b> guards for allowing people to enter, <b>and</b> if they saw footsteps <b>that were exiting</b> they would <b>kill the inner</b> guards for allowing people to leave.

### Part 9
Rabbi Yehoshua <b>reversed his sandal</b> so it was facing away from the entrance, walked on the sand, and snuck away, thereby creating the appearance of someone who had left the building. When the authorities saw the footsteps, <b>they killed the inner</b> guards. Rabbi Yehoshua then returned, <b>reversed his sandal,</b> and made footsteps in the sand indicating that someone had entered the building. They then <b>killed all</b> the guards, including the outer ones, and Rabbi Yehoshua succeeded in entering the building.

### Part 10
Rabbi Yehoshua <b>found the younger</b> sages sitting in the <b>upper,</b> more prominent section, and <b>the elder</b> ones in the <b>lower</b> section. <b>He said</b> to himself: I must first greet the younger sages, as they are sitting in the upper section, prior to the elder sages; but <b>if I greet these</b> younger sages first, <b>those</b> elder sages will <b>kill me,</b> as <b>they maintain: We are better, because we are older and they are children.</b>

### Part 11
Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said: Greetings to you,</b> but did not directly address either group. <b>They said to him: What are you doing</b> here? Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: I am a Sage of the Jews,</b> and <b>I desire to learn wisdom from you.</b> They said to him: <b>If so, we will ask you</b> questions and see if you are worthy of this privilege. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: Very well. If you win, you may do to me anything you wish, and if I defeat you,</b> then <b>eat with me on my ship.</b>

### Part 12
The sages of Athens <b>said to him:</b> In the case of <b>a certain man who goes and asks</b> to marry <b>a woman and</b> her family <b>does not give</b> her <b>to him, why would he see</b> fit <b>to go to</b> a family <b>that is greater than</b> the first? Rabbi Yehoshua <b>took a peg</b> and <b>stuck it</b> into the <b>lower</b> part of the wall, but it did <b>not go in.</b> He then stuck it <b>into the upper</b> portion of the wall where there was a hole, and it <b>went in. He said</b> to them: In <b>this</b> case <b>too,</b> where he goes to a more distinguished family than the first, perhaps he will <b>find the girl destined</b> for him.

### Part 13
The sages of Athens asked him another question: In the case of <b>a man who lends</b> money to an individual and the borrower does not repay the loan, <b>and</b> the lender <b>repossesses</b> the borrower’s property as payment instead, <b>why would</b> he <b>see</b> fit <b>to lend</b> to others <b>again?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them:</b> This is what people do: If <b>a man goes to the pond, initially cuts a bundle</b> of reeds, <b>but</b> finds that he <b>cannot</b> lift <b>it,</b> he does not stop cutting wood. Instead, he <b>cuts</b> more wood <b>and places</b> it <b>upon</b> the first, <b>until a person happens</b> to pass by and helps him <b>raise it</b> upon his shoulders, so that he can carry it home. So too, a person continues to lend based on the assumption that he will eventually find an appropriate borrower.

### Part 14
The sages of Athens <b>said to him: Say to us a matter of nonsense.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: There was a certain mule that gave birth, and a note was hanging on</b> the newborn mule’s neck <b>and on it was written that it is owed 100,000 dinars by its father’s household. They said to him: But can a mule give birth?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: This is</b> why it is <b>a matter of nonsense,</b> as it is impossible for a mule to give birth.

### Part 15
The sages of Athens then asked another question: <b>When salt is spoiling, with what does one salt it</b> to preserve it? Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: With the placenta of a mule.</b> They said to him: <b>But is there a placenta of a mule?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: <b>And does salt spoil?</b>

### Part 16
They said to him: <b>Build us a house in the air of the world.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>uttered a Name</b> of God and <b>hovered between the sky and the earth. He said to them: Bring up to me bricks and mortar</b> and I will build you a house here. They asked him: <b>Where is the center of the world?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>raised his finger</b> and <b>said to them: Here. They said to him: And who says</b> that you are correct? He said to them: <b>Bring ropes and measure.</b>

### Part 17
They said to him: <b>We have a pit in the field; bring it to the city.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: Braid ropes</b> made <b>of bran for me and I will bring it</b> to the city with them. They then said to him: <b>We have a mill that broke; sew it</b> back together. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said</b> to them: <b>Pull out threads from</b> the mill <b>for me and I will sew them</b> together.

### Part 18
They asked him another question: <b>With what does one harvest a field of knives?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua answered: <b>With the horn of a donkey.</b> They said to him: <b>But is there</b> such an item as <b>a horn of a donkey?</b> He said to them: <b>But is there</b> such a thing as <b>a field of knives?</b>

### Part 19
<b>They brought him two eggs</b> and <b>said to him: Which is</b> the egg <b>of a black hen and which is</b> the egg <b>of a white hen?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>brought them two cheeses,</b> and <b>said to them: Which</b> is the cheese <b>from the black goat and which</b> is <b>from the white goat?</b>

### Part 20
They asked him: <b>And</b> in the case of <b>a chick that dies</b> inside the egg, <b>from where does its spirit exit?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: <b>From where it enters, it departs.</b> They said to him: <b>Show us a utensil that is not worth the damage</b> that it causes. Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: <b>Each one of you bring a mat</b> and <b>spread it out.</b> When they did so, each mat <b>did not enter the gate</b> due to its size. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: Bring axes</b> and <b>break</b> the gate so that you can bring it inside. <b>This is a utensil that is not worth its damage.</b>

### Part 21
§ After Rabbi Yehoshua defeated the sages of Athens in debate, <b>he brought them</b> to his ship as they had agreed. He then brought each one to a different room. <b>When each one saw the sixty mattresses</b> in his room, <b>he said</b> to himself: <b>All of my colleagues are coming here,</b> and waited for them without attempting to leave. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to the sailor: Release your ship,</b> i.e., begin sailing. <b>While they were coming</b> to the emperor in Rome, <b>he took</b> out some <b>dirt</b> that he had taken <b>from the dirt of</b> Athens.
