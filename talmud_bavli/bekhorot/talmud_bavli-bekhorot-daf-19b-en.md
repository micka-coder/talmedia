### Part 1
<b>If</b> it serves <b>to exclude</b> a case <b>where a female emerged</b> from the womb <b>before it,</b> that <b>is derived from</b> the phrase <b>“that which opens</b> any <b>womb.” Rather, conclude from it</b> that <b>“firstborn”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> a case <b>where</b> an animal <b>emerged</b> from the womb <b>after</b> its older sibling was <b>born by caesarean section.</b> According to Ravina, the word “firstborn” is referring to an animal that is a firstborn even in only one aspect, but as it is extraneous it serves to exclude an animal whose older sibling was born by caesarean section.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: If it enters your mind</b> that <b>a firstborn in one aspect is</b> called <b>a firstborn</b> and the derivation is based on the fact that the term “firstborn” is superfluous, that <b>works out well</b> in a case <b>where a male emerged by caesarean section and</b> then another <b>male</b> emerged <b>through the womb.</b> It stands to reason <b>that it is not sanctified, as</b> this <b>birth is excluded by</b> the word <b>“firstborn,” as it is</b> the <b>firstborn of the womb,</b> but <b>it is not</b> the <b>firstborn of the males.</b>

### Part 3
<b>But</b> in a case <b>where a female emerged by caesarean section and</b> afterward <b>a male</b> was born <b>through the womb, let it be sanctified, as it is</b> the <b>firstborn of the males and</b> the <b>firstborn of the womb.</b> One cannot derive the exclusions of both of these cases from the word “firstborn,” and yet the <i>baraita</i> indicates that even if a female was born first by caesarean section, the male born afterward is not considered the firstborn. The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather, it is clear</b> that the <i>baraita</i> must be interpreted <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Abaye,</b> that a firstborn in one aspect is not called a firstborn.
