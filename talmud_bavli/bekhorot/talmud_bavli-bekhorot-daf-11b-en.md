that is gathered in <b>smoothed</b> piles, <b>from a gentile, he tithes</b> the piles <b>but they are his,</b> as he is not required to give the <i>teruma</i> to a priest or the tithes to a Levite.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Who smoothed</b> the piles? <b>If we say that a gentile smoothed them,</b> doesn’t <b>the Merciful One state: “Your grain”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17, 18:4), with regard to <i>teruma</i> and tithes, indicating that only grain whose processing is completed by a Jew is subject to the rules of <i>teruma</i> and tithes, <b>but not the grain of a gentile?</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> clearly <b>a Jew smoothed them</b> while they were <b>in the possession of the gentile</b> before purchasing them. Therefore, <b>he tithes them, as a gentile has no</b> capability of <b>acquisition</b> of land <b>in Eretz Yisrael that would cause the abrogation</b> of the sanctity of the land, thereby removing it <b>from</b> the obligation to <b>tithe</b> its produce. <b>But</b> the tithes <b>are</b> still the Jew’s, <b>as</b> he <b>says to</b> the priest: <b>I have come</b> to own this produce <b>on the basis of</b> the rights of <b>a man with whom you cannot engage in litigation,</b> i.e., a gentile, from whom I bought the produce. Since he is not obligated to give <i>teruma</i> or tithes to the priest, I am not required to give them either.

### Part 4
§ The Gemara cites an additional discussion involving this issue: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Demai</i> 3:4) that with regard to <b>one who deposits his produce with a Samaritan or with one who is unreliable with regard to tithes [<i>am ha’aretz</i>],</b> when they return it to him, the produce retains <b>its presumptive status with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>tithe and</b> produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, both of which must be removed from one’s property. The Samaritan or <i>am ha’aretz</i> is not suspected of having exchanged the deposited produce with untithed produce or produce of the Sabbatical Year.

### Part 5
But in the case of one who deposits his produce <b>with a gentile,</b> the produce returned to him is treated <b>as the produce of</b> the gentile, as he presumably exchanged it with his own. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> It is treated as <b>doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>],</b> as it is uncertain whether the gentile exchanged the produce or not.

### Part 6
The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Everyone agrees</b> that one is obligated <b>to separate</b> <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the produce that the gentile returned to him. <b>When they disagree</b> it is <b>with regard to giving it to the priest</b> following the separation. <b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that the gentile <b>certainly exchanged</b> the produce, <b>and</b> therefore the owner <b>needs to give</b> the <i>teruma</i> <b>to the priest. And Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that the produce is treated as <b><i>demai</i>,</b> so in order to receive <i>teruma</i>, the priest must bring proof that the produce requires tithing.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Dimi sat and stated this <i>halakha</i></b> of Rabbi Elazar. <b>Abaye said to him: The reason</b> that Rabbi Shimon disagrees is <b>that we are uncertain whether</b> the gentile <b>exchanged it</b> or <b>whether he did not exchange it. But</b> if <b>he definitely exchanged it, everyone</b> agrees <b>that</b> he is <b>required to give</b> the <i>teruma</i> and tithes <b>to a priest.</b> Why? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Shmuel say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> In the case of <b>one who purchases untithed produce from a gentile</b> that is gathered in <b>smoothed</b> piles, i.e., it was completely processed, <b>he tithes</b> and separates <i>teruma</i> from the piles of produce <b>but they are his,</b> and he is not required to give the <i>teruma</i> to a priest?

### Part 8
Rav Dimi said to him: <b>Perhaps here,</b> in the mishna that indicates that he must give the <i>teruma</i> to a priest, it is referring <b>to <i>teruma gedola</i>,</b> i.e., the <i>teruma</i> that is separated from the produce before tithes, whereas <b>there,</b> Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement that he separates tithes from them but they are his is referring <b>to</b> the <b><i>teruma</i></b> that is separated from <b>the tithe.</b>

### Part 9
Abaye said to him: <b>You reminded me of a statement that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who purchases from a gentile untithed produce</b> that is gathered in <b>smoothed</b> piles <b>is exempt from</b> separating the <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall speak to the Levites, and say to them: When you take</b> the tithe from <b>the children of Israel</b>…then you shall set apart of it a gift for the Lord, even a tithe of the tithe” (Numbers 18:26). It can be inferred from here that concerning <b>untithed produce that you purchase from the children of Israel, you separate <i>teruma</i> of the tithe from it and give</b> the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe <b>to a priest,</b> but concerning <b>untithed produce that you purchase from a gentile, you do not separate <i>teruma</i> of the tithe from it and give it to a priest.</b>

### Part 10
§ The mishna teaches with regard to the lamb that is used to redeem the firstborn donkey: <b>And if it dies, one may derive benefit from it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Where did it die? If we say that it died</b> in <b>the house of the priest, and</b> the mishna means that <b>the priest may derive benefit from it,</b> isn’t it <b>obvious?</b> The lamb <b>is his property. Rather,</b> perhaps the mishna means <b>that it died</b> in <b>the house of the owner</b> before it was given to the priest, <b>and</b> teaches that <b>the priest may derive benefit from it.</b> Isn’t <b>this also obvious?</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara responds: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>as long as</b> the lamb <b>has not reached the possession of</b> the priest, the priest <b>has not acquired it.</b> Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us that from the time that</b> the Israelite <b>separated it, it stands in the possession of the priest.</b>
