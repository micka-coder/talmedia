### Part 1
<b>and he takes one of</b> the animals born <b>in Elul</b> as the tithe, <b>and the remainder are exempt, whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it. Rava explains: <b>If the new year</b> for animal tithe <b>is on the first of Elul,</b> then the animals born <b>in Elul and Tishrei combine</b> to form a total of ten, <b>and</b> the animals born <b>in Av are exempt,</b> as they are from the previous year and there are less than ten of them. <b>And if the new year is on the first of Tishrei,</b> the animals born <b>in Av and Elul combine</b> to form a total of ten, whereas the animals born <b>in Tishrei are exempt.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the opinion of Rava: <b>What are you saying?</b> Why are the five animals born in Tishrei exempt? <b>Let them combine</b> with animals at <b>another</b> time of <b>gathering</b> to form a total of ten. Rather, what is the reason one is not required to tithe these five animals born in Tishrei? It is because <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32), from which it is derived that <b>a definite tenth</b> must be tithed, <b>and not an uncertain tenth,</b> i.e., an animal that is not definitely the tenth. If the first of Elul is the new year, then the five born in Tishrei would have combined with the five of Elul and are exempt. Therefore, the obligation in this case is uncertain.

### Part 3
Rava said he takes one of the animals born in Elul as the tithe. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that he must take one of those animals, as those are the only ones concerning which the obligation is definite? The Gemara answers: It is necessary for Rava to specify this <b>lest you say</b> the Sages <b>should decree</b> that one should not even take one of the animals born in Elul as a tithe, as <b>perhaps he</b> might <b>come to take from those</b> that were born in Av or Tishrei by mistake. Therefore, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that the Sages are not concerned about this error.

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>In what manner does one tithe</b> the animals? <b>He gathers them in a pen and provides them with a small,</b> i.e., narrow, <b>opening, so that two</b> animals <b>will not be able to emerge together. And he counts</b> the animals as they emerge: <b>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine; and he paints</b> the animal <b>that emerges tenth with red paint and declares: This is tithe.</b> Even if <b>he did not paint it with red paint, or if he did not count</b> the animals <b>with a rod</b> in accordance with the verse: “Whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32), <b>or if he counted</b> the animals when they were <b>prone or standing</b> in place and did not make them pass through a narrow opening, <b>these</b> animals <b>are tithed</b> after the fact.

### Part 5
But <b>if he had one hundred</b> animals <b>and he took ten</b> as tithe, or if he had <b>ten</b> animals <b>and he</b> simply <b>took one</b> as tithe, <b>that is not tithe,</b> as he did not count them one by one until reaching ten. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> In that case too, it is <b>tithe.</b> If before the owner completed tithing his animals, <b>one of</b> those already <b>counted jumped</b> back into the pen <b>among</b> the animals that had not yet been counted, <b>all those</b> in the pen <b>are exempt</b> from being tithed, as each of them might be the animal that was already counted. If one <b>of</b> those animals that had been <b>tithed,</b> i.e., designated as the tenth, jumped back into the pen <b>among</b> the animals that had not yet been counted, creating uncertainty with regard to all the animals there which was the animal tithe, <b>all</b> the animals <b>must graze until they become unfit</b> for sacrifice, <b>and</b> each of them <b>may be eaten in its blemished</b> state <b>by</b> its <b>owner</b> once it develops a blemish.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what manner does</b> one <b>tithe</b> his animals? <b>He gathers them in a pen and provides them with a small,</b> i.e., narrow, <b>opening so that two</b> animals <b>will not be able to emerge together. The mothers</b> of those animals stand <b>outside, and</b> the newborn animals to be tithed <b>are inside</b> the pen. <b>And</b> the mothers <b>bleat and</b> the young ones <b>emerge toward their mothers.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why is it performed this way? Let the owner simply <b>make them emerge</b> from the pen by pushing them. The Gemara answers that it is <b>written:</b> “Whatever <b>passes</b> under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). This means that the animal must pass under the rod of its own volition, <b>and not that</b> one <b>will cause it to pass</b> by pushing it out of the pen.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not simply <b>throw</b> the animals <b>a vegetable</b> outside the pen, <b>and they will go out toward it</b> to eat it? <b>Rav Huna said:</b> The use of the mothers is a rabbinic <b>decree due to a purchased</b> animal <b>and due to an orphan,</b> i.e., a baby animal whose mother died before it was born. Neither of these animals is subject to tithing. Since neither a purchased animal nor an orphaned animal will have its mother outside calling to it, these animals will remain in the pen and will not be tithed accidentally.

### Part 9
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Whatever passes under</b> the rod, the tenth shall be sacred to the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32); this teaches that all animals may be sanctified as animal tithe, <b>excluding a <i>tereifa</i>, as</b> on account of its physical state <b>it does not pass</b> under the rod. The phrase <b>“under the rod”</b> teaches that it is <b>a mitzva to count them with a rod. If one did not count them with a rod, or he counted them</b> when they were <b>prone or standing, from where</b> is it derived that the tenth animal is nevertheless sanctified? <b>The verse states: “The tenth shall be sacred,”</b> indicating that the tenth animal is sacred <b>in any case,</b> even if it was not tithed correctly.

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only that</b> an animal that <b>one</b> explicitly <b>called</b> by the <b>name of</b> the <b>tenth</b> one is the animal tithe. <b>From where</b> do I derive that the tenth animal is sanctified even if <b>one did not</b> explicitly <b>call</b> it <b>the tenth</b> one? <b>The verse states: “Shall be sacred.”</b> This teaches that it shall be sacred <b>in any case,</b> even if it was not called the tenth. One <b>might</b> have thought with regard to <b>one</b> who <b>had one hundred</b> animals <b>and</b> simply <b>took ten</b> of them without counting them, or one who had <b>ten</b> animals <b>and took one</b> of them without counting, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they should be</b> considered <b>tithed.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “The tenth,” and this</b> animal that he removed <b>is not the tenth,</b> as he did not count the animals. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> Even if he simply removed one animal from ten without counting, that animal is <b>tithe.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abba Elazar ben Gomel. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abba Elazar ben Gomel says</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And your <i>teruma</i> shall be reckoned to you</b> as though it were the grain of the threshing floor” (Numbers 18:27), that in using the plural form of the term “your,” <b>the verse speaks about two <i>terumot</i>. One is standard <i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e. the grain of the threshing floor, <b>and</b> the other <b>one is <i>teruma</i> of the tithe.</b> The verse equates these two <i>terumot</i>.

### Part 12
Abba Elazar ben Gomel explains: <b>Just as standard <i>teruma</i> is taken by estimate,</b> as there is no requirement for the amount separated to be measured precisely, <b>and</b> it can be taken <b>by thought,</b> as one is not required to physically separate it before consuming the remaining produce,
