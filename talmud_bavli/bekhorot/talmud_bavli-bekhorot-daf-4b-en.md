### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that the priests and Levites are exempt from their offspring being counted a firstborn <b>for</b> all <b>generations?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “And the Levites shall be Mine”</b> (Numbers 3:12). The term <b>“shall be”</b> indicates that <b>they shall be,</b> i.e., shall remain, <b>in their</b> current <b>state</b> of sanctity. Just as firstborn status did not apply to the priests or the Levites in the wilderness, it does not apply to priests or Levites in subsequent generations.

### Part 2
§ Rav Safra (4a) referred to the fact that the sanctity of the firstborn donkeys of the Israelites was abrogated by the lambs of the Levites. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> this abrogation was accomplished <b>with a lamb? Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The word <b>“silver” is stated</b> with regard to the redemption of a woman’s firstborn son <b>for</b> later <b>generations</b> in the verse: “And their redemption money…shall be, according to your valuation, five shekels of silver” (Numbers 18:16). <b>And</b> in addition, the word <b>“lamb” is stated</b> with regard to the redemption of a firstborn donkey <b>for</b> later <b>generations</b> in the verse: “And every firstborn donkey you shall redeem with a lamb” (Exodus 13:13).

### Part 3
Therefore, one can derive that <b>just as</b> concerning <b>silver, which was mentioned with regard to</b> later <b>generations,</b> the Israelites <b>redeemed with it in</b> later <b>generations</b> and <b>they</b> also <b>redeemed with it at that time,</b> as the surplus firstborn in the wilderness were redeemed with five shekels (see Numbers 3:47), <b>so too</b> concerning the <b>lamb, which was mentioned with regard to</b> later <b>generations, they redeemed with it in</b> later <b>generations,</b> and <b>they redeemed with it at that time.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara rejects the comparison: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about silver?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> it is also used for redemption in other cases, as <b>one can redeem consecrated property and second-tithe</b> produce <b>with it,</b> which is not the <i>halakha</i> with regard to lambs.

### Part 5
<b>Rather,</b> it can be derived from the fact that <b>the verse states: “Yet you shall redeem the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of non-kosher animals you shall redeem”</b> (Numbers 18:15). The juxtaposition of the two cases demonstrates that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>a</b> woman’s <b>firstborn son you have not distinguished between</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>for</b> later <b>generations and</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>for that time,</b> as the redemption is performed <b>with silver</b> in both cases, <b>so too,</b> with regard to the redemption of <b>a non-kosher animal, you should not distinguish between</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>for</b> later <b>generations and for that time,</b> as it must be performed <b>with a lamb</b> in both situations.

### Part 6
§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the procedure for the redemption of the firstborn donkeys in the wilderness: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> that <b>one lamb of a Levite</b> in the wilderness <b>rendered several firstborn donkeys of the Israelites exempt</b> from the obligations of firstborn status. <b>Abaye says: Know</b> that this is so, <b>as the verse enumerates the surplus of</b> firstborn <b>humans</b> when it says that there were 273 more firstborn Israelites than Levites who needed to be redeemed with silver (see Numbers 3:46); <b>but</b> the verse <b>does not enumerate</b> any <b>surplus of</b> Israelite <b>animals.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this proven? <b>Perhaps</b> the Israelites <b>did not have many animals,</b> and their firstborn donkeys did not outnumber the lambs of the Levites. The Gemara answers: Do <b>not</b> let this possibility <b>enter your mind, as it is written: “Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock”</b> (Numbers 32:1).

### Part 8
The Gemara challenges: <b>Perhaps even so,</b> the number of <b>ordinary</b> animals <b>of the Levites</b> that were not firstborn <b>corresponded to</b> the number of <b>firstborn</b> animals belonging to <b>the Israelites.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states:</b> “Take the Levites in exchange for all the firstborn among the children of Israel, <b>and the animal of [<i>behemat</i>] the Levites in exchange for their animals [<i>behemtam</i>]”</b> (Numbers 3:45). The use of the word <i>behemat</i> in the singular indicates that the transaction involved <b>one animal</b> of the Levites <b>in exchange for many animals</b> of the Israelites.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> the word <i>behemat</i> is referring to many animals, as in the phrase: <b>“And many animals [<i>uvhema rabba</i>]”</b> (Jonah 4:11). The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let the verse write either: <i>Behema</i></b> of the Levites <b>in exchange for <i>behema</i>, or: <i>Behemtam</i> in exchange for <i>behemtam</i>. What</b> is the significance of the phrase <b>“<i>behemat</i></b> the Levites <b>in exchange for <i>behemtam</i>”? Learn from it</b> that <b>one</b> lamb of a Levite <b>rendered many</b> donkeys of Israelites <b>exempt.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rava said: We learn</b> in a mishna (9a), <b>as well,</b> a support for Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement: <b>And</b> if the priest returns the lamb to him, he may <b>redeem</b> firstborn donkeys <b>with it many times</b> if he repurchases the lamb from the priest each time upon redeeming a donkey. <b>And</b> actually, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina is</b> not offering his own opinion, but is rather <b>explaining the reasoning of the mishna, and this</b> is what he <b>is saying: What is the reason</b> that the owner <b>may redeem</b> firstborn donkeys <b>with</b> the same lamb <b>many times?</b> It is <b>because one lamb of a Levite renders exempt several firstborn donkeys belonging to an Israelite.</b>

### Part 11
§ It <b>was stated</b> with regard to the sanctity of the firstborn in the wilderness: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that both <b>firstborn</b> animals and firstborn sons born <b>in the wilderness were sanctified, and Reish Lakish says:</b> The <b>firstborn</b> that were born <b>in the wilderness were not sanctified.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara explains the reason for each opinion: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the <b>firstborn</b> that were born <b>in the wilderness were sanctified, since the Merciful One states they should be sanctified, as it is written</b> prior to the Jews leaving Egypt: <b>“Sanctify to Me all the firstborn”</b> (Exodus 13:2).

### Part 13
<b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> Although the firstborn in Egypt were sanctified, <b>the firstborn</b> that were born <b>in the wilderness were not sanctified, as it is written: “And it shall be when</b> the Lord <b>shall bring you</b> into the land of the Canaanites” (Exodus 13:11), <b>and it is written afterward: “And you shall set apart</b> all firstborn of the womb to the Lord” (Exodus 13:12). <b>By inference,</b> it can be derived <b>that initially,</b> before the Jewish people entered Eretz Yisrael, those that were born in the wilderness <b>were not sanctified.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> from a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 112b): <b>Until the Tabernacle was established,</b> private <b>altars were permitted and</b> the sacrificial <b>service</b> was performed <b>by the firstborn.</b> Clearly, then, the firstborn in the wilderness were sanctified. Reish Lakish <b>said to him:</b> That mishna is referring <b>to those</b> firstborn <b>who left Egypt,</b> who performed the sacrificial service, and not to the ones born in the wilderness.

### Part 15
The Gemara comments: <b>This too stands to reason, as if you do not say so, is</b> an infant <b>in its</b> first <b>year capable of performing the</b> sacrificial <b>service?</b> Since the Tabernacle was established only a year after the Jewish people left Egypt, clearly the firstborn who performed the sacrificial service at that time were born in Egypt.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And he who asked it, why did he ask it?</b> Isn’t it obvious that the firstborn born in Egypt performed the sacrificial service in the first years of the Tabernacle?

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: <b>This was his difficulty: Granted, if you say that the sanctity of</b> the firstborn <b>did not cease</b> from the time that the mitzva of: “Sanctify to Me all the firstborn” (Exodus 13:2), was given in Egypt, and those born in the wilderness were also sanctified, then with regard to <b>these</b> firstborn <b>who</b> were <b>originally</b> in Egypt, <b>their sanctity also did not lapse.</b> Therefore, they could perform the sacrificial service in the first years of the Tabernacle. <b>But if you say that the sanctity of</b> the firstborn <b>ceased</b> and the firstborn born in the wilderness were not sanctified, then with regard to <b>these</b> firstborn <b>that</b> were <b>originally</b> born in Egypt, <b>their sanctity also lapsed.</b>

### Part 18
<b>And the other</b> <i>amora</i>, Reish Lakish, responded: No proof may be derived from here, as those <b>who were sanctified</b> in Egypt <b>were sanctified</b> and did not then lose their sanctity in the wilderness, while those <b>who were not sanctified</b> in Egypt <b>were not sanctified</b> in the wilderness.

### Part 19
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Reish Lakish from a <i>baraita</i>: On <b>the same day that the Tabernacle was established,</b> many types of offerings <b>were sacrificed by the Jewish people,</b> including <b>vow</b> offerings <b>and gift</b> offerings, <b>sin offerings and guilt offerings,</b> kosher <b>firstborn</b> animal offerings <b>and</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offerings. If firstborn animal offerings were sacrificed in the wilderness, then evidently the firstborn animals were sanctified in the wilderness. Reish Lakish answered him: This is referring <b>also to those</b> firstborn animals <b>that left Egypt</b> and were already sanctified there. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it may be understood <b>from</b> the <i>baraita</i> itself that the opinion of Reish Lakish is correct, as one can infer from it: <b>That day is when</b> the firstborn <b>were sacrificed,</b> but <b>beyond that they were not sacrificed.</b>

### Part 20
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> the discussion proceeded as follows: <b>Reish Lakish raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> On <b>the same day that the Tabernacle was established,</b> many types of offerings <b>were sacrificed by the Jewish people,</b> including <b>vow</b> offerings <b>and gift</b> offerings, <b>sin offerings and guilt offerings,</b> kosher <b>firstborn</b> animal offerings <b>and</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offerings. It may be inferred that on <b>that day, yes,</b> the firstborn animals were sacrificed, but <b>beyond that</b> the firstborn animals were <b>not</b> sacrificed, indicating that the male firstborn animals in the wilderness were not sanctified. The Gemara responds: One can <b>say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means that <b>from that day onward,</b> all of those offerings were sacrificed.

### Part 21
The Gemara asks: <b>And what,</b> then, <b>is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaching us?</b> The Gemara answers: It is teaching that <b>from that day</b> onward, <b>yes,</b> the Jewish people brought those offerings, but <b>initially,</b> prior to the establishment of the Tabernacle, they were <b>not</b> brought. <b>Evidently, obligatory</b> offerings such as these <b>were not sacrificed on</b> a private <b>altar;</b> only voluntary offerings were sacrificed on such altars.

### Part 22
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>You are found</b> to be <b>saying</b> that <b>the firstborn of the Jewish people were sanctified in three locations: In Egypt, and in the wilderness, and upon the entry of the Jewish people into Eretz</b> Yisrael. <b>In Egypt, what does</b> the verse <b>state? “Sanctify to Me all the firstborn”</b> (Exodus 13:2). <b>In the wilderness,</b> the verse <b>states: “For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are Mine”</b> (Numbers 8:17). <b>With regard to their entry into Eretz</b> Yisrael, the verse <b>states: “And it shall be when</b> the Lord <b>shall bring you</b> into the land of the Canaanites…<b>and you shall set apart</b> all firstborn of the womb to the Lord” (Exodus 13:11–12). This <i>baraita</i> indicates that the firstborn born in the wilderness were sanctified.

### Part 23
The Gemara rejects this proof. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> means that the Jewish people <b>were commanded in three locations with regard to the firstborn,</b> that is, <b>to sanctify</b> them, <b>but they did not sanctify</b> them in practice. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this, <b>were they not sanctified in Egypt either? Didn’t we say that they were sanctified</b> even according to Reish Lakish? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b> They were commanded in three locations to sanctify the firstborn. In some <b>of those</b> cases, i.e., in Egypt and in Eretz Yisrael, <b>they sanctified</b> them, <b>and</b> in some <b>of them,</b> i.e., in the wilderness, <b>they did not sanctify</b> them.

### Part 24
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this: And did they not sanctify</b> them <b>in the wilderness? But isn’t it written: “Count all the firstborn males of the children of Israel</b> from a month old and upward” (Numbers 3:40), a commandment that was fulfilled (see Numbers 3:42)? The firstborn referred to certainly include those born in the wilderness, as this counting occurred in the second year after the exodus from Egypt. <b>Rather, if</b> a dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish <b>was stated</b> with regard to this matter, it <b>was stated like this: Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> the firstborn that were born in the wilderness <b>were sanctified and</b> their sanctity <b>did not cease, and Reish Lakish says</b> they <b>were sanctified</b> only until the time of the counting referred to above,
