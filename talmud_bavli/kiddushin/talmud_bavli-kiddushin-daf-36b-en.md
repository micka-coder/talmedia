### Part 1
<b>“And</b> the sons of Aaron <b>shall present,” this is collecting the blood.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara discusses the mishna’s ruling that women do not perform <b>sprinkling: To which sprinkling</b> is this referring? <b>If</b> this is the sprinkling of the ashes <b>of</b> the red <b>heifer, “Elazar” is written with regard to that</b> action (Numbers 19:4), i.e., this sprinkling is performed by the deputy High Priest. If even other priests cannot perform it, certainly women cannot. <b>If</b> this is referring <b>to</b> the sprinkling performed <b>inside</b> the Holy of Holies, the phrase: <b>“The anointed priest”</b> (Leviticus 4:16), <b>is written with regard to that</b> rite, and consequently there is no question that women are ineligible. <b>Rather,</b> it is referring to <b>sprinkling</b> the blood <b>of a bird</b>-offering.

### Part 3
The Gemara explains <b>that this is derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from a sheep</b> offering: <b>If</b> with regard to <b>a sheep</b> offering, concerning <b>which</b> the Torah <b>did not establish a priest for its slaughter,</b> since it may be slaughtered by anybody, the Torah nevertheless <b>established a priest for its sprinkling,</b> as the verse states: “And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood” (Leviticus 1:11), <b>is it not logical</b> that with regard to <b>a bird</b>-offering, concerning <b>which</b> the Torah <b>established a priest for its pinching,</b> an act parallel to slaughtering a sheep, the Torah likewise <b>established a priest for its sprinkling?</b> This proves that the sprinkling of the blood of a bird-offering can be performed only by priests, not by women.

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches that these mitzvot apply specifically to men but not to women, <b>except for the meal-offering of a <i>sota</i> and a nazirite woman,</b> which these women wave. <b>Rabbi Elazar said to Rabbi Yoshiya of his generation,</b> i.e., the <i>amora</i> who was his contemporary, not the <i>tanna</i> with the same name who lived earlier: <b>Do not sit down until you explain this statement to me; from where</b> is it derived <b>that the meal-offering of a <i>sota</i> requires waving?</b> The Gemara expresses surprise: What is the meaning of the question: <b>From where do we</b> derive it? <b>It is written in</b> the chapter dealing with a <i>sota</i> <b>itself: “And he shall wave the meal-offering”</b> (Numbers 5:25). <b>Rather,</b> the question is as follows: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the <b>waving</b> is performed <b>by the owners?</b> Perhaps only the priest waves it?

### Part 5
Rabbi Yoshiya responded: This <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived</b> through the verbal analogy of the term <b>“hand”</b> stated with regard to a <i>sota</i> <b>from</b> the term <b>“hand”</b> stated with regard to <b>a peace-offering. It is written here,</b> with regard to the meal-offering of a <i>sota</i>: <b>“And the priest shall take</b> the meal-offering of jealousy <b>from the woman’s hand</b> and he shall wave the meal-offering” (Numbers 5:25), <b>and it is written there: “His own hands shall bring</b> the offerings of the Lord made by fire; the fat with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be waved before the Lord” (Leviticus 7:30).

### Part 6
<b>Just as here,</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>, <b>a priest</b> performs the waving, <b>so too there,</b> with regard to a peace-offering, <b>a priest</b> performs the waving. And <b>just as there,</b> with regard to a peace-offering, the <b>owner</b> performs the waving, as indicated by the verse, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>, the <b>owner</b> performs the waving. <b>How so?</b> How can both the priest and the owner perform the waving? The owner places his hands beneath the peace-offering, and the <b>priest places his hand under the hand of the owner and waves</b> it together with him.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the meal-offering of <b>a <i>sota</i>; from where do we</b> derive that <b>a nazirite woman</b> also waves her meal-offering? The Gemara answers: <b>It is derived</b> through a verbal analogy of the term <b>“palm”</b> stated with regard to naziriteship <b>from</b> the term <b>“palm”</b> stated with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i>.</b> The verse concerning naziriteship states: “And he shall place them upon the palms of the nazirite” (Numbers 6:19), and the verse concerning a <i>sota</i> states: “And he shall place it on her palms” (Numbers 5:18). Just as a <i>sota</i> waves her meal-offering, so too, a nazirite woman waves hers.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Any mitzva that is dependent on the land [<i>aretz</i>] applies only in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>and</b> any mitzva <b>that is not dependent on the land applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.
