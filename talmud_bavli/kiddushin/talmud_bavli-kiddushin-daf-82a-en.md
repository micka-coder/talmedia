### Part 1
<b>All</b> such actions <b>are</b> permitted <b>for the sake of Heaven.</b> In other words, if one is acting out of familial affection, without any element of licentiousness, they are permitted.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A bachelor may not act as a teacher of children, nor may a woman act as a teacher of children. Rabbi Elazar says: Even one who does not have a wife may not act as a teacher of children. Rabbi Yehuda says: A bachelor may not herd cattle, nor may two bachelors sleep with one covering,</b> lest they transgress the prohibition against homosexual intercourse, <b>but the Rabbis permit</b> it.

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> that a bachelor may not teach children? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>due to the children</b> themselves, that it is suspected that he may engage in homosexual intercourse with them, <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:10): <b>They said to Rabbi Yehuda: Jews are not suspected of</b> engaging in <b>homosexual intercourse nor of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>an animal. Rather,</b> the reason is as follows: <b>A bachelor</b> may not be a teacher of children <b>due to the mothers of the children,</b> who come to the school from time to time, with whom he might sin. Similarly, <b>a woman</b> may not serve as a teacher to children <b>because</b> she may come to be secluded with <b>the fathers of the children.</b>

### Part 4
The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Even one who does not have</b> a wife may not act as a teacher of children. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the students in the study hall: Does Rabbi Elazar mean <b>one who does not have a wife at all, or perhaps</b> he is referring even to one who has a wife, <b>in</b> a circumstance <b>where she is not residing with him? Come</b> and <b>hear: Even one who has</b> a wife <b>but she is not residing with him may not act as a teacher of children.</b> This statement is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar and indicates that his restriction applies even if the man is married.

### Part 5
The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> A bachelor <b>may not herd</b> cattle, nor may two bachelors sleep with one covering. <b>It is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (5:10): <b>They said to Rabbi Yehuda: Jews are not suspected of</b> engaging in <b>homosexual intercourse nor of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>an animal.</b>

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Anyone who has professional dealings</b> primarily <b>with women may not be secluded with women.</b> There is more of a concern that such a man might sin due to his familiarity with the women. <b>And a person may not teach his son a trade</b> that necessitates frequent interaction with <b>women,</b> for the same reason. With regard to teaching one’s son a trade, <b>Rabbi Meir says: A person should always teach his son a clean and easy trade and pray</b> for success <b>to the One to Whom wealth and property belong, as</b> ultimately <b>there is no trade that does not include</b> both <b>poverty and wealth,</b> since a person can become rich from any profession. <b>Poverty does not</b> come <b>from a</b> particular <b>trade, nor does wealth</b> come <b>from a</b> particular <b>trade,</b> but <b>rather, all is in accordance with</b> a person’s <b>merit.</b> Therefore, one should choose a clean and easy trade, and pray to God for success.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Have you ever seen a beast or a bird that has a trade? And</b> yet <b>they earn their livelihood without anguish. But</b> all these <b>were created only to serve me, and I,</b> a human being, <b>was created to serve</b> the One Who <b>formed me. Is it not right that I should earn my livelihood without anguish? But I,</b> i.e., humanity, <b>have</b> committed <b>evil actions and have lost my livelihood.</b> This is why people must work to earn a living.

### Part 8
<b>Abba Guryan of Tzadyan says in the name of Abba Gurya: A person may not teach his son</b> the trades of <b>a donkey driver, a camel driver, a pot maker, a sailor, a shepherd, or a storekeeper.</b> The reason for all these is the same, <b>as their trades are the trades of robbers;</b> all of these professions involve a measure of dishonesty and are likely to lead to robbery. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in</b> Abba Gurya’s <b>name: Most donkey drivers are wicked,</b> since they engage in deceit, <b>and most camel drivers,</b> who traverse dangerous places such as deserts, <b>are</b> of <b>fit</b> character, as they pray to God to protect them on their journeys. <b>Most sailors are pious,</b> since the great danger of the seas instills in them the fear of Heaven. <b>The best of doctors is to Gehenna, and</b> even <b>the fittest of butchers is a partner of Amalek.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Nehorai says: I set aside all the trades in the world, and I teach my son only Torah, as a person partakes of its reward in this world and the principal</b> reward <b>remains for him in the World-to-Come, which is not true of other professions,</b> whose rewards are only in this world. Furthermore, <b>if a person comes to be ill, or old, or undergoes suffering, and is unable to be involved in his trade, behold, he dies in hunger. But</b> with regard to <b>the Torah it is not so,</b> since one can study it under all circumstances. <b>Rather, it preserves him from all evil</b> and sin <b>in his youth, and provides him with a future and hope in his old age.</b>

### Part 10
The mishna explains: <b>With regard to his youth, what does it say</b> about a Torah scholar? <b>“But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength”</b> (Isaiah 40:31). <b>With regard to his old age, what does it say? “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age”</b> (Psalms 92:15), <b>and it likewise states with regard to Abraham our forefather: “And Abraham was old,</b> well stricken in age; <b>and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things”</b> (Genesis 24:1). <b>We found that Abraham our forefather fulfilled the entire Torah before it was given, as it is stated: “Because that Abraham listened to My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws”</b> (Genesis 26:5), which indicates that Abraham observed all the mitzvot of his own accord and was rewarded in his old age as a result.

### Part 11
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who has professional dealings</b> primarily <b>with women, his practice</b> and company are <b>bad,</b> and it is best to keep away from him. This category includes, <b>for example, the smiths, and the carders, and the fixers of hand mills</b> of women, <b>and the peddlers</b> of jewelry and perfume to women, <b>and the weavers [<i>gardiyyim</i>], and the barbers, and the launderers, and the bloodletter, and the bathhouse attendant [<i>ballan</i>], and the tanner [<i>burseki</i>]. One may not appoint from</b> among those who have these professions <b>neither a king nor a High Priest. What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>not because they are disqualified,</b> since there is nothing wrong with these jobs, <b>but because their trades are demeaning,</b> and they would not be respected when appointed to a position of authority.

### Part 12
<b>The Sages taught: Ten things were stated with regard to a bloodletter: He walks on his side,</b> i.e., in a haughty manner; <b>and his spirit is arrogant; and he leans and sits,</b> i.e., he does not sit down like others do but leans on an object in a conceited fashion; <b>and he is stingy; and he is envious;</b> and <b>he eats much and discharges</b> only <b>a little; and he is suspected of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>those with whom relations are forbidden, and of stealing, and of bloodshed</b> in the course of his work.

### Part 13
<b>Bar Kappara taught: A person should always teach his son a clean and easy trade.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> such a profession? <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b>
