### Part 1
The Gemara questions this analysis: <b>But</b> doesn’t <b>the mishna</b> deal <b>with</b> a case where the <b>stolen item</b> is <b>hers, and</b> yet <b>Rav says she is not betrothed.</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; this</b> case, in the <i>baraita</i>, is referring to a situation <b>where he had arranged</b> to betroth her beforehand, which indicates that she has released him from his obligation to return it, but <b>that</b> case, in the mishna, is referring to a situation <b>where he had not arranged</b> his marriage with her, so it is stolen property and she is not betrothed.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain woman who was washing her feet in a vessel of water. A certain man came</b> along, <b>grabbed</b> a few <b>dinars from another</b> person, <b>and threw</b> them <b>to her,</b> and <b>said to her: You are betrothed to me. That man</b> subsequently <b>came before Rava,</b> to inquire as to the status of the woman. Rava <b>said: There is not</b> anyone <b>who is concerned for this</b> opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, who said:</b> In <b>an ordinary</b> case of <b>robbery</b> the <b>owner has despaired</b> of recovering the stolen item, and it belongs to the robber. Rather, the assumption is that the owner has not despaired of recovering the stolen item. In this case, since the stolen dinars do not belong to the man, his betrothal is of no effect.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates another incident: The was <b>a certain sharecropper who betrothed</b> a woman <b>with a handful [<i>bemoza</i>] of onions [<i>deshamkhei</i>]</b> taken from the field where he worked. <b>He came before Rava</b> to ask about the status of the woman. Rava <b>said to him: Who relinquished</b> these onions <b>to you?</b> Since the owner did not allow you to take them, they are stolen property, and the woman is not betrothed. The Gemara comments: <b>And this matter applies</b> only <b>to a handful, but</b> if he took <b>a bundle</b> of onions and betrothed a woman with them, the sharecropper <b>can say to</b> the owner: <b>I took a bundle, you take a bundle; one bundle for</b> another <b>bundle.</b> Since in any case they divide the crop between them, it is not considered theft.

### Part 4
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <b>a certain brewer [<i>sarseya</i>]</b> who was making date beer for someone, <b>who betrothed</b> a woman <b>with sediment [<i>bifruma</i>] from the beer. The owner of the beer came</b> and <b>found him.</b> The owner <b>said to him: Why don’t you give</b> her the betrothal <b>from this,</b> the <b>sharp</b> sediments that are of better quality than the kind you chose? The brewer <b>came before Rava</b> to ask whether the owner’s comment indicated that he had relinquished his rights to the sediment, which would mean the woman is betrothed. Rava <b>said</b> to him: The Sages <b>said</b> that if the owner discovers that someone has taken something of his without permission and says: <b>Go to</b> and take <b>the</b> item of <b>better</b> quality, that it is a sign he agrees with the man’s action <b>only with regard to <i>teruma</i> alone,</b> and you did not have the right to use the sediment.

### Part 5
The Gemara explains the previous statement: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 1:5): <b>When did they say</b> that in the case where <b>one separates <i>teruma</i> without</b> the owner’s <b>consent, his <i>teruma</i> is</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>?</b> The <i>baraita</i> clarifies: In a case where <b>there was</b> someone <b>who entered another’s field and gathered</b> produce from it, <b>and separated <i>teruma</i> without</b> the owner’s <b>permission, if</b> the owner is <b>concerned about</b> his actions and view it <b>as robbery, his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>, but if</b> he is <b>not</b> concerned, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is <i>teruma</i>.</b>

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where would</b> the gatherer <b>know whether</b> he should be <b>concerned</b> that the owner objects and views it <b>as robbery or not?</b> If <b>the owner came and found him</b> separating <i>teruma</i> <b>and said to him: Go to</b> take <b>the</b> produce of <b>better</b> quality and separate <i>teruma</i> from that, then <b>if</b> produce of <b>better</b> quality <b>than</b> the produce he had separated <b>is found, his <i>teruma</i> is</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> since the owner is assumed to have been sincere and pleased that the other has separated <i>teruma</i> from his produce. <b>But if not, his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>,</b> as it may be assumed that the owner was angry at him and was speaking sarcastically. The <i>baraita</i> adds: If <b>the owners were gathering and adding</b> to the <i>teruma</i> he had separated, indicating that they agree to his act of separation, <b>either way,</b> whether or not better-quality produce was found, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>.</b>

### Part 7
Rava concludes the explanation of his ruling: This <i>halakha</i> applies only to <i>teruma</i>, which is a mitzva that the owner must in any case perform. <b>But here,</b> in the case of the brewer who betrothed a woman with sediment from the beer, the owner <b>acts because of embarrassment,</b> and while he does not feel comfortable protesting, he did not in fact relinquish his rights to the sediment, <b>and she is not betrothed.</b>

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to a priest <b>who betroths</b> a woman <b>with his portion</b> of offerings, <b>whether</b> he did so with <b>offerings of the most sacred order</b> or <b>whether</b> he did so with <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, she is not betrothed.</b> One who betroths a woman <b>with second tithe, whether unwittingly</b> or <b>intentionally, has not betrothed</b> her; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he did so <b>unwittingly he has not betrothed</b> her, but if he did so <b>intentionally he has betrothed</b> her.

### Part 9
<b>And</b> with regard to one who betroths a woman <b>with consecrated</b> property belonging to the Temple treasury, if he does so <b>intentionally he has betrothed</b> her, <b>and</b> if he does so <b>unwittingly he has not betrothed</b> her; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says</b> the opposite: If he does so <b>unwittingly he has betrothed</b> her, but if he does so <b>intentionally he has not betrothed</b> her.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states with regard to the obligation to bring an offering for taking a false oath concerning unlawful possession of the property of another: “If any one sin, <b>and he commits a trespass against the Lord,</b> and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). As the verse is discussing property belonging to another, the phrase “a trespass against the Lord” serves <b>to include</b> in the obligation of an offering a false oath with regard to possession of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity</b> of another person, <b>which are the property</b> of the owner; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> According to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, the portion of an offering of lesser sanctity that the priest receives belongs to him, so he should be able to betroth a woman with it.

### Part 11
The Gemara rejects this: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, as Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says</b> that an offering of lesser sanctity belongs to its owner only <b>while</b> the animal is still <b>alive, but after</b> its <b>slaughter</b> it does <b>not</b> belong to the priest who receives portions from it. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>When</b> the priests <b>receive</b> their portion after the animal has been slaughtered <b>they receive</b> their portion <b>from the table of the Most High,</b> and do not own the portion itself.

### Part 12
The Gemara adds: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches:</b> With regard to a priest <b>who betroths</b> a woman <b>with his portion</b> of offerings, <b>whether</b> he did so with <b>offerings of the most sacred order or whether</b> he used <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, has not betrothed</b> her. The mishna does not speak of a priest who betroths a woman with a living offering of lesser sanctity but of one who betroths with the portion of the slaughtered animal he has received. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from it</b> that it is only in this case that she is not betrothed.

### Part 13
<b>The Sages taught: After the death of Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Yehuda said to his students: Do not let the students of Rabbi Meir enter here</b> into our house of study, <b>because they are vexatious [<i>kanteranim</i>]. And they do not come to study Torah,</b> but <b>rather they come to overwhelm me with <i>halakhot</i>. Sumakhos,</b> a student of Rabbi Meir, <b>pushed and entered</b> anyway. <b>He said to them: This</b> is what <b>Rabbi Meir taught me:</b> With regard to a priest <b>who betroths</b> a woman <b>with his portion</b> of the offerings, <b>whether</b> he did so with <b>offerings of the most sacred order or whether</b> he used <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, he has not betrothed</b> her.

### Part 14
Upon hearing this, <b>Rabbi Yehuda became angry with</b> his students. <b>He said to them: Didn’t I say this to you: Do not let the students of Rabbi Meir enter here</b> into our house of study, <b>because they are vexatious? And they do not come to study Torah,</b> but <b>rather they come to overwhelm me with <i>halakhot</i>.</b> Rabbi Yehuda explained his objection to the statement of Rabbi Meir: This <i>halakha</i> is not relevant, <b>as from where</b> would <b>a woman</b> appear <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard?</b> Women may not enter the area of the Temple courtyard where the priests eat the offerings of the most sacred order, so there is no reason to address an impossible scenario.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who was present, <b>said: They will say: Meir died, Yehuda grew angry,</b> and <b>Yosei remained silent; what will become of the words of Torah?</b> He said: In fact, this <i>halakha</i> is relevant; <b>but isn’t it common</b> for <b>a man to accept betrothal for his daughter in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard?</b> There is no need to give the betrothal item directly to the woman; it can be given to her father. <b>And</b> additionally, <b>isn’t it common</b> for <b>a woman to designate an agent for herself to accept her betrothal in the courtyard? And furthermore: What</b> would be the <i>halakha</i> if the woman <b>pushed and entered?</b> Since it is possible for her to do so, the <i>halakha</i> in such a case must be determined.

### Part 16
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Sages discussed the issue of a priest who betroths a woman with his portion of offerings of the most sacred order: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says she is betrothed,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yosei says she is not betrothed. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Both of them derived</b> their opinions from <b>one verse,</b> which states that the priests have a right to a portion of offerings of the most sacred order, but they explained it in different ways. The verse states: <b>“This shall be yours of the most holy things, reserved from the fire”</b> (Numbers 18:9). <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the term <b>“yours”</b> indicates that the portion the priest receives is intended for you, i.e., a priest, <b>and for all your needs,</b> including betrothing a woman. <b>And Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that the verse compares the priest’s portion <b>to the fire</b> on the altar: <b>Just as</b> the portion burned on the <b>fire</b> is <b>for</b> the fire’s <b>consumption, so too,</b> the priest’s portion <b>is also for consumption</b> alone, and not for any other purpose.

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b>
