### Part 1
<b>Needlework for embroidery</b> is a clean and easy trade.

### Part 2
<b>It is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (5:12): <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: There is no trade that disappears from the world,</b> since all occupations are needed, but <b>fortunate is he who sees his parents in an elevated trade; woe is he who sees his parents in a lowly trade</b> and follows them into their trade. Similarly, <b>it is impossible for the world</b> to continue <b>without a perfumer and without a tanner. Fortunate is he whose trade is</b> as <b>a perfumer, and woe is he whose trade is</b> as <b>a tanner,</b> who works with materials that have a foul smell. Likewise, <b>it is impossible for the world</b> to exist <b>without males and without females,</b> yet <b>fortunate is he whose children are males, and woe is he whose children are females.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Meir says: A person should always teach his son a clean and easy trade, and he should request compassion from the One to Whom wealth and property belong, as poverty</b> does <b>not</b> come <b>from a trade, nor</b> does <b>wealth</b> come <b>from a trade; rather,</b> they come <b>from the One to Whom wealth belongs, as it is stated: “Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold, says the Lord of hosts”</b> (Haggai 2:8).

### Part 4
The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Have you ever seen</b> a beast or a bird that has a trade? <b>It is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (5:13): <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: I never saw a deer</b> work as one who <b>dries figs, nor a lion</b> work as <b>a porter, nor a fox</b> work as <b>a storekeeper. And</b> yet <b>they earn their livelihood without anguish. But</b> all these <b>were created only to serve me, and I,</b> a human being, <b>was created to serve</b> the One Who <b>formed me. If these, who were created only to serve me, earn their livelihood without anguish,</b> then <b>is it not right that I, who was created to serve</b> the One Who <b>formed me, should earn my livelihood without anguish? But I,</b> i.e., humanity, <b>have</b> committed <b>evil actions and have lost my livelihood, as it is stated: “Your iniquities have turned away</b> these things, and your sins have held back good from you” (Jeremiah 5:25).

### Part 5
The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Nehorai says: I set aside all the trades</b> and I teach my son only Torah. It <b>is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (5:14): <b>Rabbi Nehorai says: I set aside all the trades in the world, and I teach my son only Torah, as all other trades serve one only in the days of his youth,</b> when he has enough strength to work, <b>but in the days of his old age, behold, he</b> is left to <b>lie in hunger. But Torah is not like this: It serves a person in the time of his youth and provides him with a future and hope in the time of his old age. With regard to the time of his youth, what does it say</b> about a Torah scholar? <b>“But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength”</b> (Isaiah 40:31). <b>With regard to</b> the time of <b>his old age, what does it say? “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age, they shall be full of sap and richness”</b> (Psalms 92:15).
