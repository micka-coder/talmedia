<b>Alternatively,</b> the buyer can lift an elephant <b>by</b> using <b>bundles of vines.</b> He leads the elephant to them, and when the elephant stands on the bundles of vines this is considered lifting the elephant.

### Part 2
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land or other items that are fixed in the earth, <b>can be acquired by</b> means of giving <b>money, by</b> means of giving <b>a document, or by</b> means of taking <b>possession</b> of it. Property <b>that does not serve as a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, <b>can be acquired only by pulling. Property that does not serve as a guarantee can be acquired</b> along <b>with property that serves as a guarantee by</b> means of giving <b>money, by</b> means of giving <b>a document, or by</b> means of taking <b>possession</b> of them. The movable property is transferred to the buyer’s possession when it is purchased together with the land, by means of an act of acquisition performed on the land.

### Part 3
Generally, one is not obligated to take an oath concerning the denial of a claim with regard to land. The mishna continues: <b>And</b> in a legal dispute involving both land and movable property, if the defendant makes a partial admission of the claim with regard to the movable property, thereby rendering himself obligated to take an oath denying any responsibility for the remaining property, the movable property <b>binds the property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., the land, so that he is forced <b>to take an oath concerning</b> the land as well, despite the fact that one is generally not obligated to take an oath for a claim involving land.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara inquires: <b>From where do we</b> derive that land can be acquired <b>by</b> means of <b>money? Ḥizkiyya said</b> that <b>the verse states: “They shall acquire fields with money”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44). The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the proof is from that verse, one can <b>say</b> that the acquisition is not valid <b>unless there is a document</b> as well, <b>as it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“And write a document and sign”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44). The Gemara answers: <b>If it were written: They shall acquire</b> fields with money, <b>at the end</b> of the verse, it would be <b>as you said,</b> that one must also write a document so that he can acquire the land with money. <b>Now that it is written “they shall acquire” at the beginning</b> of the verse, this teaches that the <b>money</b> itself <b>effects acquisition</b> of the land, and the <b>document is merely a proof.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav says: They taught</b> that land can be acquired by means of money alone, i.e., without a document, <b>only in a place where</b> the custom is that <b>they do not write documents; but in a place where</b> the custom is that <b>they write documents one does not acquire</b> land until a document is given to him. <b>And if he specified</b> that he wishes to acquire the land from the time of the money transfer, then <b>he has specified</b> his wishes, and the land is acquired once the money is given.

### Part 6
The Gemara comments: This is <b>like that which Rav Idi bar Avin</b> would do. <b>When purchasing land,</b> Rav Idi bar Avin <b>would say: If I wish</b> to acquire it <b>by</b> means of <b>money, I will acquire</b> it in that manner, and <b>if I wish</b> to acquire it <b>by</b> means of <b>a document, I will acquire</b> it by that method. He would stipulate at the outset that he reserves the right to choose how the transaction will be finalized. The Gemara elaborates: <b>If I wish</b> to acquire it <b>by</b> means of <b>money, I will acquire</b> it in that way, <b>as, if you wish to retract</b> your participation in the sale <b>you cannot retract</b> it, because the money has already changed hands. <b>And if I wish</b> to acquire the land <b>by</b> means of <b>a document, I will acquire</b> it in that way, <b>as, if I wish to retract</b> my participation in the sale <b>I can retract</b> it provided that I have not received a document of purchase.

### Part 7
§ The mishna teaches that land can be purchased <b>by</b> means of <b>a document.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>because it is written: “And write in a document and sign, and witnesses shall testify”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44), <b>but didn’t you say</b> that the document mentioned in the verse <b>is merely a document of proof? Rather,</b> it is derived <b>from here: “And I took the deed of purchase”</b> (Jeremiah 32:11), an expression that indicates that the document itself effects the acquisition. <b>Shmuel said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the document itself effects acquisition <b>only</b> in the case <b>of a deed of a gift. But with regard to a sale, it does not effect acquisition until</b> the buyer <b>gives</b> the seller <b>money.</b> The document itself does not effect the acquisition.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Hamnuna raises an objection</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How</b> is acquisition performed <b>by</b> means of <b>a document?</b> If he <b>wrote for him on paper or earthenware, even though</b> the paper or the earthenware <b>is not worth one <i>peruta</i>: My field is sold to you,</b> or: <b>My field is given to you</b> as a gift, <b>it is thereby sold or given.</b> This indicates that a document is sufficient to effect acquisition both in the case of a sale and in the case of a gift. Rav Hamnuna <b>raised the objection and he resolved it:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to one <b>who sells his field due to its poor</b> quality. The seller wants to be rid of his field due to its decreasing value and would like to transfer ownership of it as quickly as possible. In this case writing a document is enough to complete the acquisition.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Ashi says:</b> It can be claimed that the entire <i>baraita</i> is referring to one case, that <b>of a gift</b> one <b>wished to give</b> another. The <i>baraita</i> does not deal with a sale at all. <b>And why does he write for him</b> a deed for a gift containing the <b>language of a sale? He does it in order to enhance his power.</b> If it turns out that there was a lien on this land, the beneficiary can collect the value of the field from the giver’s other property, as though this land had been sold to him. In other words, by writing that it is a sale, the giver grants the beneficiary the acquisition power of a buyer, but since the transaction is actually a gift, the document itself completes the acquisition.

### Part 10
§ The mishna further teaches that land can be acquired <b>by</b> means of taking <b>possession</b> of it. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Ḥizkiyya said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And dwell in your cities that you have taken”</b> (Jeremiah 40:10). <b>In what</b> manner <b>have you taken</b> these cities? They are taken <b>by dwelling,</b> which indicates that taking possession of a plot of land and dwelling there is an act demonstrating ownership, and it is itself a valid act of acquisition. A Sage from <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a different proof: <b>“And you shall possess it and dwell there”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:31). <b>How have you possessed</b> it? You have done so <b>by dwelling</b> there. This teaches that land can be acquired through an act that demonstrates ownership.

### Part 11
§ The mishna teaches that property <b>that does not serve as a guarantee can be acquired only by pulling.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written: “And if you sell any item to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor’s hand”</b> (Leviticus 25:14). This verse speaks of <b>an item that is acquired from hand to hand,</b> i.e., by pulling.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says</b> that <b>by Torah law</b> giving <b>money effects acquisition</b> but pulling does not, <b>what can be said?</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that acquisition through pulling is a rabbinic decree, and by Torah law movable property can be acquired only by means of giving money. Why does the mishna not mention this mode of acquisition? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan could answer that the <b><i>tanna</i> teaches a rabbinic ordinance,</b> which reflects the accepted practice, but he does not find it necessary to mention a mode of acquisition that applies by Torah law.

### Part 13
§ The mishna further states that <b>property that does not serve as a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, can be acquired along with property that serves as a guarantee, i.e., land. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Ḥizkiyya said</b> that <b>the verse states: “And their father gave them</b> great <b>gifts,</b> of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, <b>with fortified cities in Judah”</b> (II Chronicles 21:3). This indicates that he gave them movable items together with the cities. He did not need to give the items to them directly, as he was able to transfer these gifts by means of the cities he gave them.

### Part 14
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages with regard to this matter of acquisition of movable property by way of land: Do <b>we require</b> that this movable property be actually <b>piled</b> on the land that is sold <b>or not? Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:6). <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The owner of <b>any amount of land is obligated in <i>pe’a</i> and in first fruits,</b>
