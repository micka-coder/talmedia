and this action <b>brings him to the life of the World-to-Come.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> One <b>such as Avimi, my son,</b> properly <b>fulfilled the mitzva of honoring</b> his parents. The Gemara relates: <b>Avimi had five sons during his father’s lifetime</b> who were <b>ordained</b> to issue halakhic rulings, and he too was ordained. <b>And</b> yet <b>when Rabbi Abbahu,</b> his father, <b>came and called at the gate</b> to enter, Avimi <b>would</b> himself <b>run and go to open</b> the door <b>for him. And before he arrived there, he</b> would already <b>say: Yes, yes,</b> so that his father would not think that he was being ignored.

### Part 3
<b>One day</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to</b> Avimi his son: <b>Give me water to drink. Before he brought him</b> the water, Rabbi Abbahu <b>dozed off.</b> Avimi <b>bent over</b> and <b>stood over him until</b> his father <b>awoke.</b> The performance of this mitzva <b>aided him,</b> i.e., as a reward God helped him in his studies, <b>and</b> Avimi succeeded in homiletically <b>interpreting</b> the psalm: <b>“A song to Asaph”</b> (Psalms 79).

### Part 4
<b>Rav Ya’akov bar Avuh said to Abaye:</b> With regard to one <b>such as I,</b> so beloved by my parents that <b>before I return from the study hall my father brings me a cup and my mother pours for me, how should I act?</b> Is it disrespectful to accept this honor from them? Abaye <b>said to him: Accept</b> it <b>from your mother, but do not accept it from your father, as, since he is a Torah scholar he will be disheartened</b> if his son does not show him the proper level of respect.

### Part 5
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Tarfon had a certain</b> manner of treating his <b>mother, that whenever she wished to ascend into</b> her <b>bed he would bend over and</b> help <b>her to ascend, and whenever she wished to descend</b> from the bed, <b>she would descend onto him. He came and praised</b> himself in the <b>study hall</b> for performing the mitzva of honoring one’s father and mother so thoroughly. <b>They said to him: You still have not reached even half of</b> the <b>honor</b> due to her. <b>Has</b> it ever happened that <b>she threw a purse into the sea in front of you, and you did not embarrass her?</b>

### Part 6
<b>When Rav Yosef heard his mother’s footsteps, he</b> would <b>say: I will stand before the arriving Divine Presence. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Fortunate is one who never saw</b> his father and mother, as it is so difficult to honor them appropriately. The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> himself never saw his parents. <b>When his mother was pregnant with him, his father died;</b> and when <b>she gave birth to him, his mother died. And the same</b> is true of <b>Abaye.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so,</b> that Abaye never saw his mother? <b>But didn’t Abaye say</b> on many occasions: <b>My mother told me?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> mother <b>was</b> actually <b>his foster mother,</b> not his birth mother.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Asi had an elderly mother. She said to him: I want jewelry,</b> and <b>he made</b> jewelry <b>for her.</b> She said to him: <b>I want a man</b> whom I can marry, and he said to her: <b>I will seek</b> one <b>for you.</b> She said to him: <b>I want a husband who is as handsome as you.</b> At this point, he realized that she was senile, and that he would be unable to fulfill all her requests. Therefore, <b>he left her and went to Eretz Yisrael.</b>

### Part 8
Rav Asi <b>heard that she was following him</b> to Eretz Yisrael. <b>He came before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> and <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>leaving Eretz</b> Yisrael to go <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>prohibited.</b> Rav Asi further asked: If one is going <b>to greet</b> his <b>mother, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: I do not know.</b> Rav Asi <b>waited a little</b> while, and <b>then came</b> back to him. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Asi, you are</b> evidently <b>determined to leave.</b> May <b>the Omnipresent return you in peace,</b> and he said no more.

### Part 9
Rav Asi <b>came before Rabbi Elazar,</b> because he did not know how to interpret Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement. <b>He said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>God forbid, perhaps</b> he <b>is angry</b> with me that I wished to leave? Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: What</b> exactly <b>did he say to you?</b> Rav Asi <b>said to him:</b> May <b>the Omnipresent return you in peace.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: If it is so that he was angry, he would not have blessed you.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan certainly gave you permission to leave. <b>In the meantime,</b> while he was traveling to meet her, Rav Asi <b>heard that her coffin was coming,</b> i.e., his mother had died and her coffin was being brought to Eretz Yisrael. <b>He said: Had I known I would not have left,</b> as after his mother’s death he was not obligated to leave Eretz Yisrael to honor her.

### Part 10
<b>The Sages taught: One honors</b> his father <b>in his life and honors him in his death. How</b> does he honor him <b>in his life? One who goes to a place on the command of his father should not say</b> to the people to whom he has been sent, to hurry them along: <b>Send me</b> on my journey <b>on my own behalf,</b> or: <b>Hurry up on my own behalf,</b> or: <b>Allow me</b> to <b>take leave</b> of this business <b>on my own behalf. Rather,</b> he should say <b>all</b> of the above in the following manner: Act in this manner <b>on Father’s behalf,</b> as a mark of respect for his father.

### Part 11
<b>How</b> does he honor him <b>in his death?</b> If <b>he says a matter he heard from his</b> father’s <b>mouth, he should not say: So said Father. Rather,</b> he should say: <b>So said Father, my teacher, may I be an atonement for his resting</b> soul. <b>And this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>applies within twelve months</b> of his death. <b>From this</b> time <b>onward he says: May his memory be for a blessing, for the life of the World-to-Come.</b>

### Part 12
<b>The Sages taught: A Sage</b> who lectures in public must <b>change the name of his father,</b> i.e., when he quotes his father he should not mention him by name. <b>And</b> similarly, he changes the <b>name of his teacher. The disseminator,</b> who explains the statements of a Sage to the audience, <b>changes neither the name of his father nor the name of his teacher.</b> The Gemara asks: To <b>whose father</b> is this referring? <b>If we say</b> it is referring to <b>the father of the disseminator,</b> whom the Sage mentioned in his lecture, <b>is that to say</b> that <b>the disseminator is not obligated</b> to observe the mitzva of honoring one’s father? How can a disseminator mention his own father by name?

### Part 13
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> This is referring to the <b>name of the Sage’s father and the name of the Sage’s teacher.</b> This is <b>like that which Mar bar Rav Ashi</b> would do, as <b>when he would teach</b> Torah <b>at his regular lecture</b> and would mention a <i>halakha</i> in the name of his father, Rav Ashi, <b>he would say:</b> So said <b>my father, my teacher; and his disseminator</b> would <b>say: So said Rav Ashi.</b> Although a son may not mention his father’s name, the disseminator of his lecture may do so.

### Part 14
<b>The Sages taught: What is fear and what is honor? Fear</b> of one’s father includes the following: <b>One may not stand in his</b> father’s fixed <b>place, and may not sit in his place, and may not contradict his statements</b> by expressing an opinion contrary to that of his father, <b>and he may not choose sides</b> when his father argues with someone else. What is considered <b>honor? He gives</b> his father <b>food and drink, dresses and covers</b> him, and <b>brings</b> him <b>in and takes</b> him <b>out</b> for all his household needs.

### Part 15
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages:
