### Part 1
The obligation to pay <b>a wage is</b> incurred <b>only at the end</b> of the labor, when he returns the item to her. Since it is at this stage that he forgives the money due him and converts it to money for betrothal, it was never considered to be a loan. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds:</b> The obligation to pay <b>a wage is</b> incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end,</b> at which point the debt is viewed as a loan that has accumulated throughout the period of hire.

### Part 2
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone agrees</b> that the obligation to pay <b>a wage is</b> incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end. And</b> they also agree that in the case of <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan, she is not betrothed. And here</b> the case is not discussing a hired worker but a contractor, who is entitled to payment only upon completion of the job, and they <b>disagree with regard to</b> the question of whether or not <b>a craftsman acquires</b> ownership rights through <b>enhancement of the vessel.</b> Is it viewed that the contractor has acquired the item by improving it, and he is then selling it back to the one who hired him? Or is he merely being paid for his labor? One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds: A craftsman acquires</b> ownership rights <b>through enhancement of the vessel,</b> and since he partly owns the jewelry he can betroth a woman with it. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds: A craftsman does not acquire</b> ownership rights <b>through enhancement of the vessel.</b>

### Part 3
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>a craftsman does not acquire</b> ownership rights <b>through enhancement of the vessel, and</b> also that the obligation to pay <b>a wage is</b> incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end. And</b> everyone also agrees that in the case of <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan, she is not betrothed. And with what are we dealing here?</b> A case <b>where he added a jewel [<i>nofekh</i>] of his own for her, as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that if a man betroths a woman with <b>a loan and one <i>peruta</i>, his mind</b> is focused <b>on the <i>peruta</i>. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>his mind</b> is focused <b>on the loan.</b> Here too, the question is whether her intention is to become betrothed with the payment for the work, which is a loan, or with the jewel he added.

### Part 4
<b>And</b> they disagree <b>in the dispute</b> between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:4): If one says to a woman: Be betrothed to me <b>with the payment</b> for that <b>which I have worked for you, she is not betrothed</b> because it is a loan, since she already owes him the money. But if he said: Be betrothed to me <b>with the payment</b> for that <b>which I will work for you, she is betrothed,</b> as at the moment he becomes entitled to the money it is considered as though he gives it to her for her betrothal. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> If he says: <b>With the payment</b> for that <b>which I will work for you, she is not betrothed,</b> as Rabbi Natan holds that the obligation to pay a wage is incurred continuously from the beginning of the period he was hired to its end, which means that by the end of the job it is a loan. <b>And</b> this is <b>all the more so</b> if he says: <b>With the payment</b> for that <b>which I have worked for you.</b>

### Part 5
The <i>baraita</i> cites a third opinion: <b>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: Actually, they said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>whether</b> he said: <b>With the payment</b> for that <b>which I have worked for you, or: With the payment</b> for that <b>which I will work for you, she is not betrothed. But if he added a <i>nofekh</i> of his own for her, she is betrothed.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara clarifies the dispute: The difference <b>between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Natan</b> concerns <b>a wage:</b> Is the obligation incurred continuously or only at the end? The difference <b>between Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi</b> is the issue of <b>a loan and one <i>peruta</i>.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Natan, <b>holds</b> that if a man betroths a woman with <b>a loan and one <i>peruta</i> his mind</b> is focused <b>on the loan,</b> and his jewel is disregarded. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that <b>his mind</b> is focused <b>on the <i>peruta</i>,</b> and she is betrothed with the jewel.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a man said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with this cup of wine, and it was found</b> to be a cup <b>of honey;</b> or if he said: With this cup <b>of honey, and it was found</b> to be a cup <b>of wine;</b> or if he said: <b>With this dinar</b> made <b>of silver, and it was found</b> to be made <b>of gold;</b> or if he said: With this dinar made <b>of gold, and it was found</b> to be made <b>of silver;</b> or if he said: <b>On the condition that I am wealthy, and he was found</b> to be <b>poor;</b> or if he said: On the condition that I am <b>poor, and he was found</b> to be <b>wealthy, she is not betrothed</b> in any of these cases. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: If he misled her to</b> her <b>advantage</b> by giving her something better than what he stated, or if his status was greater than he claimed, she is <b>betrothed.</b>

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to one who says to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with this cup,</b> without further specification, it <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:3) that the betrothal is effected <b>with</b> the cup <b>and</b> also <b>with its contents. And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that the betrothal is effected <b>with</b> the cup <b>but not with its contents. And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in yet <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that the betrothal is effected <b>with its contents but not with it.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this is <b>not difficult:</b> The <i>baraitot</i> do not contradict one another since <b>this</b> one is stated <b>with regard to</b> a cup of <b>water, this</b> one is stated <b>with regard to</b> a cup of <b>wine,</b> and <b>this</b> one is stated <b>with regard to</b> a cup of <b>oil.</b>

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches that Rabbi Shimon says: <b>If he misled her to</b> her <b>advantage,</b> she is <b>betrothed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Shimon accept</b> the statement of the mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 83a) that if one sells <b>wine and it was found</b> to be <b>vinegar,</b> or if he sold <b>vinegar and it was found</b> to be <b>wine, both</b> the buyer and the seller <b>can retract from</b> the sale? Although wine is more valuable than vinegar, the seller is not considered to have defrauded the buyer, in which case only the buyer could retract. <b>Apparently,</b> this is because <b>there is</b> one <b>for whom</b> it is <b>preferable</b> to have <b>vinegar and there is</b> one <b>for whom</b> it is <b>preferable</b> to have <b>wine.</b> Consequently, receiving wine instead of vinegar is not objectively better. If so, <b>here too, there is</b> one <b>for whom</b> it is <b>preferable</b> to have <b>silver and</b> it is <b>not preferable for him</b> to have <b>gold.</b> Why does Rabbi Shimon say that she is betrothed if he gave her gold instead of silver?

### Part 10
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi says: I found Abaye sitting and explaining</b> this mishna <b>to his son: With what are we dealing here?</b> With a case <b>where one said to his agent: Lend me a dinar</b> made <b>of silver and go and betroth for me such and such a woman</b> with it, <b>and he went and lent</b> him a dinar made <b>of gold</b> and betrothed her with that. One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that he is <b>particular</b> in his requirement that a silver dinar be used, and consequently she is not betrothed. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>he is</b> merely <b>indicating</b> his position <b>to him.</b> He stated silver only as a guideline, but does not care if it is gold.

### Part 11
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> if the case involves an agent, why does the mishna state: <b>Be betrothed to me?</b> The mishna <b>should have</b> stated: <b>Be betrothed to him.</b> Furthermore, why does it say: <b>He misled her to</b> her <b>advantage?</b> The mishna <b>should have</b> stated: <b>He misled him to</b> his <b>advantage,</b> as the agent did not mislead the woman but the one who designated him. Similarly, there is a difficulty with regard to the wording: If it was <b>found</b> to be made of gold, as according to this explanation, <b>from the outset,</b> when the agent gave it to the woman, <b>it was also</b> known to be made <b>of gold.</b> This fact was not discovered later.

### Part 12
<b>Rather, Rava says: I and the lion of the group explained it,</b> and the Gemara interjects: <b>And who is</b> the lion of the group? It is <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin: With what are we dealing here?</b> With a case <b>where she said to her agent: Go and accept my betrothal for me from so-and-so, who said to me: Be betrothed to me with a dinar</b> made <b>of silver, and</b> the prospective husband <b>went and gave</b> the agent <b>a dinar</b> made <b>of gold.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that she is <b>particular</b> about becoming betrothed with a silver dinar rather than a gold one. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>she is</b> merely <b>indicating</b> her position <b>to him</b> but does not care what the agent receives from the man. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of: It was <b>found,</b> as it was evident from the outset that it was gold? The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the coin <b>was wrapped in a cloth,</b> and the agent was unaware that he was receiving a different dinar from what she had requested.

### Part 13
<b>Abaye said:</b> With regard to <b>Rabbi Shimon, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and Rabbi Elazar, they all hold</b> that when one instructs an agent in such a manner <b>he is</b> merely <b>indicating</b> his position <b>to him,</b> as opposed to expressing an insistence on certain details. If the agent makes insignificant changes to the instructions the agency is still fulfilled. <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> holds this, as seen in <b>this</b> mishna <b>that we</b> just <b>said. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> holds this, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 160a):
