<b>they sacrificed the <i>omer</i> and</b> only <b>afterward</b> did they <b>eat.</b>

### Part 2
<b>But according to the one who says</b> that the term dwelling indicates that the prohibition of the new crop applies only <b>after inheritance and settlement</b> of Eretz Yisrael, <b>let</b> the Jews <b>eat</b> the produce of the land <b>immediately.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They did not need</b> to eat the new produce, as they still had manna. Although they did not eat the new crop of Eretz Yisrael, the reason was not that it was prohibited.

### Part 3
This is <b>as it is written: “And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years until they came to a settled land; they ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan”</b> (Exodus 16:35). The Gemara analyzes this verse: <b>One cannot say</b> they ate <b>“until they came to a settled land,”</b> i.e., that they were still eating the manna when they entered Eretz Yisrael, <b>as it is already stated: “To the borders of the land of Canaan,”</b> which indicates that they stopped eating manna before entering Eretz Yisrael, on the plains of Moab. <b>And one cannot say</b> that they ate manna only until they reached <b>“to the borders of the land of Canaan,” as it is already stated: “Until they came to a settled land.” How</b> can <b>these</b> clauses be reconciled? <b>Moses died on the seventh of Adar and the manna ceased falling, and they ate the manna that was</b> left <b>in their vessels until the sixteenth of Nisan,</b> even after they entered Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 4
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years”</b> (Exodus 16:35). <b>But did they</b> really <b>eat</b> it for <b>forty years? But didn’t they eat</b> it for <b>forty years less thirty days?</b> The manna began to fall on the sixteenth of Iyyar in the first year in the wilderness, and they stopped eating it on the sixteenth of Nisan in the fortieth year. <b>Rather, this</b> verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>they tasted the taste of manna</b> in the unleavened <b>cakes that they took out from Egypt</b> on the fifteenth of Nisan in their first year, and this sustained them until the manna fell.

### Part 5
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Moses died on the seventh of Adar, and he was</b> likewise <b>born on the seventh of Adar. From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> Moses <b>died on the seventh of Adar? As it is stated: “So Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5), <b>and it is written: “And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:8). <b>And it is written: “Now it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord”</b> (Joshua 1:1), <b>and it is written: “Moses, My servant, is dead; now arise, cross</b> this Jordan” (Joshua 1:2).

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And it is written: “Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying: Prepare your victuals, for within three days you are to cross the Jordan”</b> (Joshua 1:11). <b>And it is written: “And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month”</b> (Joshua 4:19). <b>Subtract retroactively from</b> that date, the tenth of Nisan, <b>the last thirty-three days,</b> i.e., the thirty days of mourning for Moses and the three days of preparation before crossing the Jordan, and you <b>learn</b> from here <b>that Moses died on the seventh of Adar.</b>

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where</b> is it derived that <b>Moses was born on the seventh of Adar?</b> It is <b>as it is stated: “And he said to them, I am one hundred and twenty years old today; I can no more go out and come in”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:2). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state “today,”</b> since Moses could have said simply: I am one hundred and twenty years old. <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “today”?</b> One can learn from it that Moses was born on that date, i.e., he was exactly one hundred and twenty years old. <b>This teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits and completes the years of the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as it is stated: “The number of your days I will fulfill”</b> (Exodus 23:26).

### Part 8
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: The Jewish people were commanded</b> to perform <b>three mitzvot</b> immediately <b>upon entering Eretz</b> Yisrael: The new crop, diverse kinds, and <i>orla</i>, <b>and</b> these <b>apply both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.

### Part 9
<b>And it is logical,</b> i.e., one can derive through an <i>a fortiori</i> argument <b>that</b> each of these mitzvot <b>should apply</b> everywhere. <b>If</b> the prohibition of the <b>new crop, whose prohibition is not a permanent prohibition,</b> as it does not apply to grain that grows after the <i>omer</i> has been sacrificed on the sixteenth of Nisan, <b>and whose prohibition is not a prohibition against</b> deriving <b>benefit,</b> since usages other than eating are permitted, <b>and there is dissolution for its prohibition,</b> i.e., grain that grew before the sixteenth of Nisan becomes permitted after the <i>omer</i> offering has been brought, <b>applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, the same <i>halakha</i> should certainly apply to diverse kinds.

### Part 10
Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai elaborates: With regard to <b>diverse kinds, whose prohibition is a permanent prohibition,</b> as it never expires, <b>and whose prohibition is a prohibition against</b> deriving <b>benefit,</b> since one may not benefit in any manner from diverse kinds of the vine, <b>and there is no dissolution for its prohibition, is it not logical that it should apply both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael? <b>And the same is true of <i>orla</i> with regard to two</b> of those points. <i>Orla</i> is not a permanent prohibition, as it applies only for the first three years that a tree produces fruit, but one may not derive benefit from it, and produce from the first three years never becomes permitted.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says:</b>
