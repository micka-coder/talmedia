### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A woman is acquired</b> by, i.e., becomes betrothed to, a man to be his wife <b>in three ways, and she acquires herself,</b> i.e., she terminates her marriage, <b>in two ways.</b> The mishna elaborates: <b>She is acquired through money, through a document, and through sexual intercourse.</b> With regard to a betrothal <b>through money,</b> there is a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that she can be acquired <b>with one dinar or with</b> anything that is <b>worth one dinar. And Beit Hillel say:</b> She can be acquired <b>with one <i>peruta</i>,</b> a small copper coin, <b>or with</b> anything that is <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b> The mishna further clarifies: <b>And how much is</b> the value of <b>one <i>peruta</i>,</b> by the fixed value of silver? The mishna explains that it is <b>one-eighth of the Italian <i>issar</i>,</b> which is a small silver coin.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> a woman <b>acquires herself through a bill of divorce or through the death of the husband. A woman whose husband, who had a brother, died childless [<i>yevama</i></b>], can be <b>acquired</b> by the deceased husband’s brother, the <i>yavam</i>, only <b>through intercourse. And she acquires herself,</b> i.e., she is released from her levirate bond, <b>through <i>ḥalitza</i> or through the death of the <i>yavam</i>.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that <b>a woman</b> can be <b>acquired</b> in three ways. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different here that</b> this mishna <b>teaches: A woman is acquired,</b> using the language of acquisition, <b>and what is different there,</b> in the beginning of the next chapter (42a), <b>which teaches: A man betroths,</b> using the language of betrothal? The Gemara explains: In this mishna the <i>tanna</i> utilized the language of acquisition <b>because he wanted to teach</b> about betrothal through <b>money,</b> which is the standard means of exchange in an act of acquisition.

### Part 4
The Gemara continues its explanation: <b>And from where do we</b> derive that betrothal is accomplished by means of giving <b>money?</b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term expressing <b>taking</b> stated with regard to betrothal and <b>from</b> the term expressing <b>taking</b> with regard to <b>the field of Ephron.</b> How so? <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to marriage: <b>“When a man takes a woman”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and it is written there,</b> concerning Abraham’s purchase of the field of the Cave of Machpelah from Ephron the Hittite: <b>“I will give money for the field; take it from me”</b> (Genesis 23:13). This verbal analogy teaches that just as Ephron’s field was acquired with money, so too, a woman can be acquired with money.

### Part 5
The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> the <b>taking</b> of Ephron’s field <b>is called an acquisition</b> in the Torah, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the same issue: <b>“The field which Abraham acquired”</b> (Genesis 25:10).
