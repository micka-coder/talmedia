### Part 1
that <b>anywhere that there are only five <i>sela</i></b> available, i.e., enough to redeem only one man, and one is obligated to redeem both himself and his son, <b>he,</b> the father, <b>takes precedence over his son. What is the reason?</b> It is that <b>his own mitzva is preferable</b> to one that he performs on behalf of others. <b>When they disagree</b> is in a case <b>where there is</b> land worth <b>five</b> <i>sela</i> that is <b>liened</b> property that has been sold, i.e., he sold this land to other people but it can be reclaimed by his prior creditor, <b>and five</b> <i>sela</i> which is entirely <b>unsold</b> property.

### Part 2
And the reasoning behind the dispute is as follows: <b>Rabbi Yehuda maintains</b> that <b>a loan that is written in the Torah,</b> i.e., any financial obligation that applies by Torah law, is <b>considered as though it is written in a document,</b> and therefore it can be collected from liened property, like any loan recorded in a document. This means that the liened property worth five <i>sela</i> is available for one’s own redemption, but not for that of his son, as the sale of the property occurred before the birth of his firstborn. Consequently, <b>with these five</b> <i>sela</i> upon which there is no lien <b>he redeems his son, and</b> the <b>priest goes and repossesses</b> the land worth <b>five</b> <i>sela</i> that is <b>liened</b> property <b>for his</b> own redemption. In this manner one can fulfill both mitzvot.

### Part 3
<b>And the Rabbis maintain: A loan that is written in the Torah is not considered as though it is written in a document,</b> since buyers will not be aware of this obligation, so that they should be aware that the land may be repossessed. <b>And therefore</b> there is no advantage for this man to redeem his son with the five <i>sela</i> upon which there is no lien, and <b>his own mitzva is preferable,</b> which means he redeems himself with the free land. With the liened property that is left he cannot redeem his son, as the land was sold before the birth of his firstborn.

### Part 4
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If one has money <b>to redeem his son and to ascend to</b> Jerusalem on <b>the pilgrimage Festival, he redeems his son and then ascends</b> to Jerusalem <b>on the pilgrimage Festival. Rabbi Yehuda says: He ascends</b> to Jerusalem <b>on the pilgrimage Festival and then redeems his son.</b> His reasoning is <b>that this</b> trip to Jerusalem for the pilgrimage Festival is <b>a mitzva</b> whose time soon <b>passes, and this,</b> the redemption of the firstborn son, is <b>a mitzva</b> whose time does <b>not</b> soon <b>pass,</b> as it can be fulfilled later.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> it is <b>as he stated</b> in <b>his reasoning,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda provided the rationale for his opinion. <b>But what is the reasoning of the Rabbis,</b> who say that he should first redeem his son? The Gemara answers that the reason is <b>that the verse states: “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 34:20), <b>and</b> it <b>then</b> states, in the same verse: <b>“And none shall appear before me empty,”</b> referring to the pilgrimage Festival in Jerusalem. The order of the verse indicates that one should redeem his firstborn son before traveling to Jerusalem on the pilgrimage Festival.

### Part 6
<b>The Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if one had five</b> firstborn <b>sons, from five</b> different <b>women, he is obligated to redeem them all? The verse states: “All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem”</b> (Exodus 34:20), and the emphasis of “all” includes any of one’s firstborn sons. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> it <b>obvious</b> this is the case? After all, <b>the Merciful One made</b> this mitzva <b>dependent upon the opening of the womb,</b> as it states: “Sanctify to Me all the firstborn, whoever opens the womb” (Exodus 13:2). Since each of these sons is the firstborn of his mother, it is clear that the father is required to redeem each of them.

### Part 7
The Gemara answers that this ruling is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>we should derive</b> a verbal analogy between <b>“firstborn”</b> stated here and <b>“firstborn” from</b> the verses dealing with <b>inheritance: Just as there,</b> the verse describes a firstborn who receives a double portion of the inheritance as: <b>“The first fruit of his strength”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), i.e., he is the firstborn son to his father, and not the first child born to his mother; <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the redemption of the firstborn son, it is referring to the <b>first fruit of his strength,</b> which would mean that the father need redeem only his oldest child. Therefore, this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case. Rather, every firstborn son to his mother must be redeemed.

### Part 8
§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches that a father is obligated <b>to teach</b> his son <b>Torah.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this requirement? <b>As it is written: “And you shall teach them [<i>velimadtem</i>] to your sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:19). <b>And</b> in a case <b>where his father did not teach him he is obligated to teach himself, as it is written,</b> i.e., the verse can be read with a different vocalization: <b>And you shall study [<i>ulmadtem</i>].</b>

### Part 9
<b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> a woman <b>is not obligated</b> to teach her son Torah? <b>As it is written: “And you shall teach [<i>velimadtem</i>],”</b> which can be read as: <b>And you shall study [<i>ulmadtem</i>].</b> This indicates that <b>whoever is commanded to study</b> Torah <b>is commanded to teach, and whoever is not commanded to study is not commanded to teach.</b> Since a woman is not obligated to learn Torah, she is likewise not obligated to teach it.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that she is not obligated to teach herself?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “And you shall teach [<i>velimadtem</i>],”</b> which can be read as: <b>And you shall study [<i>ulmadtem</i>],</b> which indicates that <b>whoever others are commanded to teach is commanded to teach himself, and whoever others are not commanded to teach is not commanded to teach himself. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that others are not commanded to teach</b> a woman? <b>As the verse states: “And you shall teach them to your sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:19), which emphasizes: <b>Your sons and not your daughters.</b>

### Part 11
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If <b>one</b> wishes <b>to study</b> Torah himself <b>and his son</b> also wants <b>to study, he takes precedence over his son. Rabbi Yehuda says: If his son is diligent and sharp, and his study will endure, his son takes precedence over him.</b> This is <b>like that</b> anecdote <b>which</b> is told about <b>Rav Ya’akov, son of Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov, whose father sent him to Abaye</b> to study Torah. <b>When</b> the son <b>came</b> home, his father <b>saw that his studies were not sharp,</b> as he was insufficiently bright. Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov <b>said to</b> his son: <b>I am preferable to you,</b> and it is better that I go and study. Therefore, <b>you sit</b> and handle the affairs of the house <b>so that I can go</b> and study.

### Part 12
<b>Abaye heard</b> that Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov <b>was coming. There was a certain demon in the study hall of Abaye,</b> which was so powerful <b>that when two</b> people would <b>enter they would be harmed, even during the day.</b> Abaye <b>said to</b> the people of the town: <b>Do not give</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov <b>lodging [<i>ushpiza</i>]</b> so that he will be forced to spend the night in the study hall. Since Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov is a righteous man, <b>perhaps a miracle will occur</b> on his behalf and he will kill the demon.

### Part 13
Rav Aḥa found no place to spend the night, and <b>he entered and spent the night in that study hall</b> of <b>the Sages.</b> The demon <b>appeared to him like a serpent</b> with <b>seven heads.</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov began to pray, and with <b>every bow</b> that <b>he bowed one</b> of the demon’s <b>heads fell off,</b> until it eventually died. The <b>next day</b> Rav Aḥa <b>said to</b> the townspeople: <b>If a miracle had not occurred, you would have placed me in danger.</b>

### Part 14
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If one has to decide whether <b>to study Torah or to marry a woman,</b> which should he do first? <b>He should study Torah and afterward marry a woman. And if it is impossible for him</b> to be <b>without a wife, he should marry a woman and then study Torah. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that one should <b>marry a woman and afterward study Torah.</b>

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> How can one do this? With <b>a millstone</b> hanging <b>from his neck,</b> i.e., with the responsibility of providing for his family weighing upon him, can <b>he engage in Torah</b> study? The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> the <i>amora’im</i> <b>do not disagree; this is for us and that is for them.</b> In other words, one statement applies to the residents of Babylonia, whereas the other is referring to those living in Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 16
§ With regard to marriage, the Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ḥisda would praise Rav Hamnuna to Rav Huna</b> by saying <b>that he is a great man.</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: When he comes to you, send him to me. When</b> Rav Hamnuna <b>came</b> before him, Rav Huna <b>saw that he did not cover</b> his head with <b>a cloth,</b> as Torah scholars did. Rav Huna <b>said to him: What is the reason</b> that <b>you do not cover</b> your head <b>with a cloth?</b> Rav Hamnuna <b>said to him:</b> The reason is <b>that I am not married,</b> and it was not customary for unmarried men to cover their heads with a cloth. Rav Huna <b>turned his face away from him</b> in rebuke, and <b>he said to him: See</b> to it <b>that you do not see my face until you marry.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara notes: <b>Rav Huna</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says:</b> If one is <b>twenty years old and has not</b> yet <b>married a woman, all of his days</b> will be <b>in</b> a state of <b>sin</b> concerning sexual matters. The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that he will be <b>in</b> a state of <b>sin</b> all of his days? <b>Rather, say</b> that this means the following: <b>All of his days</b> will be <b>in</b> a state of <b>thoughts of sin,</b> i.e., sexual thoughts. One who does not marry in his youth will become accustomed to thoughts of sexual matters, and the habit will remain with him the rest of his life.

### Part 18
<b>Rava said, and similarly, the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Until</b> one reaches the age of <b>twenty years the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits and waits for a man,</b> saying: <b>When will he marry a woman? Once he reaches</b> the age of <b>twenty and has not married, He says: Let his bones swell,</b> i.e., he is cursed and God is no longer concerned about him.

### Part 19
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The fact <b>that I am superior to my colleagues</b> is <b>because I married</b> at the age of <b>sixteen, and if I would have married at</b> the age of <b>fourteen,</b>
