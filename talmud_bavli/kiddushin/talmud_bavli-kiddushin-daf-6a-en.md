### Part 1
<b>last expressions</b> are <b>what he teaches us.</b> The novelty of Shmuel’s statement is that with regard to the second set of pronouncements there is no concern at all that a valid betrothal or divorce might have been performed. The Gemara explains why according to Shmuel these pronouncements are not of concern. <b>Here,</b> in the case of betrothal, it is <b>written: “When</b> a man <b>takes</b> a woman” (Deuteronomy 24:1), which indicates that the man is acting to change the status of the woman, <b>and</b> it is <b>not</b> written <b>that he takes himself</b> or gives himself to her, as in the case of one who says: I am hereby your man. <b>And</b> likewise, it is <b>written here,</b> with regard to divorce: <b>“And sends her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>and</b> it is <b>not</b> written <b>that he sends himself</b> from her, as in the case of one who says: I am not your man.

### Part 2
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if a man says to a woman: <b>You are hereby my wife,</b> or: <b>You are hereby my betrothed,</b> or: <b>You are hereby acquired to me,</b> then <b>she is betrothed.</b> If he said to her: <b>You are hereby mine,</b> or: <b>You are hereby under my authority,</b> or: <b>You are hereby bound to me,</b> then <b>she is betrothed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is that she is betrothed with regard to both sets of statements, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach all of them together.</b> Why does the <i>baraita</i> divide these statements into two groups? The Gemara answers: <b>The <i>tanna</i> heard them as two sets of three, and</b> consequently <b>he taught them</b> in that form. He heard each sequence of three cases as a separate <i>halakha</i> from his teachers, and therefore he preserved them as two sets of three.

### Part 3
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a man betrothing a woman said: You are hereby <b>unique to me, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this woman betrothed? Similarly, if he said to her: You are hereby <b>designated to me, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my helper, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my counterpart, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my gathered one, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my rib, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my closed one, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>beneath me, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he said: You are hereby <b>my seized one, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Finally, if he said: You are hereby <b>my taken one, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 4
The Gemara suggests: <b>Resolve at least one</b> of these dilemmas, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says</b> to a woman: You are hereby <b>my taken one, she is betrothed, because it is stated: “When a man takes a woman”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1).

### Part 5
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a man says to a woman: You are hereby <b>my espoused one [<i>ḥarufati</i>], what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that with regard to <b>one who says:</b> You are hereby <b>my espoused one, she is betrothed, as in Judea they call a betrothed woman a <i>ḥarufa</i>, an espoused woman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And is Judea most of the world?</b> Even if this is true in Judea, why should a <i>halakha</i> that applies in all locations be based on this local custom?

### Part 6
The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>one who says:</b> You are hereby <b>my espoused one, she is betrothed, as it is stated: “Who is a maidservant espoused [<i>neḥerefet</i>] to a man”</b> (Leviticus 19:20). This verse means that she is betrothed to a certain man. <b>And furthermore,</b> the <i>baraita</i> adds another proof for this claim: <b>In Judea they call a betrothed woman a <i>ḥarufa</i>, an espoused woman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it reasonable to introduce the custom in <b>Judea</b> with the term: <b>And furthermore,</b> as proof <b>to</b> a <i>halakha</i> derived from <b>a verse? Rather,</b> the Gemara explains that <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>one who says:</b> You are hereby <b>espoused, in Judea, she is betrothed, as in Judea they call a betrothed woman a <i>ḥarufa</i>, an espoused woman.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks a general question with regard to all the previously mentioned expressions: <b>With what are we dealing? If we say</b> that these dilemmas are referring to a case <b>where he was not speaking with her about matters of her bill of divorce or her betrothal,</b> but suddenly issued this statement to her, <b>from where does she know what he is saying to her?</b> Out of context, these statements are not necessarily referring to betrothal. <b>Rather,</b> they are referring to a case <b>where he was speaking to her about matters of her bill of divorce and her betrothal.</b>But if so, <b>even though he did not say</b> anything, she would <b>also</b> be betrothed if he gave her money for the purpose of betrothal.

### Part 8
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 4:7): If <b>one was speaking with a woman about matters of her bill of divorce or her betrothal, and he gave her a bill of divorce or her betrothal,</b> i.e., the money or a document of betrothal, <b>but did not clarify</b> his action, <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> This <b>is sufficient for him,</b> i.e., it is a valid divorce or betrothal because she will understand his intention from the context. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He is required to clarify</b> the meaning of his behavior. <b>And Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> If so, even if he said nothing to her she would still be betrothed, and this should certainly be the case if he says one of the statements under discussion.

### Part 9
The Sages <b>say</b> in explanation of this matter: <b>Actually,</b> we are dealing with cases <b>where he was speaking to her about matters of her bill of divorce and her betrothal, and if</b> it was referring to a case <b>where he</b> had <b>given her</b> the money <b>and been silent, so too</b> it would have been a valid betrothal. <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where he gave her</b> something <b>and said to her</b> one <b>of these expressions.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And this is the dilemma raised before</b> the Sages: <b>These expressions, did he say them to her for</b> the purpose of <b>betrothal, or perhaps he said</b> them <b>to her for</b> the purpose of <b>labor?</b> He might have intended to hire her, withdrawing his previous intention to betroth her. In other words, his statement in conjunction with his giving of an item renders the meaning of the expression less clear than if he had remained silent. The Gemara leaves most of these issues unanswered, and states that the dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 11
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself:</b> If <b>he was speaking to the woman about matters of her bill of divorce or her betrothal, and he gave her bill of divorce or her betrothal to her and did not clarify</b> his intention, <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> This <b>is sufficient for him. Rabbi Yehuda says: He is required to clarify. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: And this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> provided <b>that they were discussing the same issue</b> and had not moved on to a different topic.

### Part 12
<b>And likewise, Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: And this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> provided <b>that they were discussing the same issue.</b> The Gemara comments: This disagreement is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> on this topic. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: And this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> provided <b>that they were discussing the same issue. Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon says:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that they were not discussing the same issue.</b>

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And if they were not discussing the same issue, from where does she know what he is saying to her?</b> They have already changed the topic of conversation, and these expressions on their own are ambiguous. <b>Abaye said:</b> They have not changed to an entirely different topic; rather, they changed <b>from</b> discussing one <b>topic to</b> discussing another <b>topic within the same</b> general <b>topic.</b> In other words, they were no longer speaking directly about divorce or betrothal, but they were still discussing related matters. Therefore, his intention was clear to her when he made his statement.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi: But</b> if so, with regard to <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Anyone who does not know the nature of bills of divorce and betrothals should have no dealings in them,</b> i.e., he may not serve as a judge in cases of this kind lest he permit that which is prohibited, does this principle apply <b>even</b> if that individual <b>did not hear this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Shmuel says?</b> Since this type of case is uncommon, should such an individual be considered unfamiliar with the <i>halakhot</i> of bills of divorce and betrothals? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so;</b> this person is considered to lack the requisite knowledge to deal with these cases. This ruling is an important matter with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of betrothal, and one who is unaware of it might err.

### Part 15
The Gemara returns to Shmuel’s statement. <b>And similarly, with regard to divorce:</b> If a husband <b>gave</b> his wife <b>her bill of divorce and said to her: You are hereby sent away,</b> or: <b>You are hereby divorced,</b> or: <b>You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man,</b> then <b>she is divorced.</b> The Gemara comments: It <b>is obvious</b> that if a husband <b>gave her a bill of divorce and said to his wife: You are hereby a free woman,</b>
