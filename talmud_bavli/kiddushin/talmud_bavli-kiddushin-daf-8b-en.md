### Part 1
<b>There is no one hundred dinars here,</b> as he has not yet given her one hundred dinars, and <b>there is no collateral here,</b> since this collateral is not a gift but merely a security. He has therefore not given her anything. <b>Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he betrothed her with collateral, she is betrothed.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> it is referring <b>to collateral</b> belonging <b>to other</b> people, which was in the possession of the man who betrothed her, <b>and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak.</b>

### Part 2
<b>As Rabbi Yitzḥak says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a creditor acquires collateral,</b> i.e., that the individual in possession of the collateral has the actual rights to it? <b>As it is stated:</b> “You shall surely restore him the pledge when the sun goes down that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you; <b>and it shall be righteousness to you”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13). <b>If</b> the creditor <b>does not acquire</b> the pledge or collateral, <b>from where</b> does this considering his return of the collateral as <b>righteousness</b> stem? The creditor is not giving an item belonging to him; why is this considered a righteous act? Rather, <b>from here</b> it is derived <b>that a creditor acquires collateral</b> to a certain extent.

### Part 3
The Gemara relates: <b>The sons of Rav Huna bar Avin bought a certain maidservant</b> on the condition that they would pay <b>with</b> copper <b><i>perutot</i>. They did not have</b> the money at the time, and therefore <b>they gave a piece of silver [<i>naskha</i>] for her</b> as collateral. <b>Ultimately,</b> the price of the <b>maidservant increased</b> and the sellers wanted to cancel the sale. <b>They came before Rabbi Ami</b> for his ruling and <b>he said to them: There are no <i>perutot</i> here,</b> and <b>there is no piece of silver here</b> either. There was no valid act of acquisition at all because they did not actually give the money, and the collateral does not transfer ownership.

### Part 4
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:9): If a man said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with one hundred dinars,</b> and <b>she took it</b> from his hand <b>and threw it into the sea, or into the fire, or into anything that destroys, she is not betrothed.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this ruling: The <i>baraita</i> indicates that she is not betrothed only if the one hundred dinars are destroyed, <b>but</b> if she <b>threw the coins before him</b> but did not destroy them, <b>that is a betrothal.</b> Why should this be? By throwing the coins at him <b>she is</b> effectively <b>saying to him: Take</b> this; <b>I do not want</b> your betrothal.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is speaking</b> using the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> as follows: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state in a case where <b>she throws</b> the money <b>before him that it is not a betrothal,</b> as her action indicates that she does not want to be betrothed. <b>But</b> when <b>she throws it into the sea or into the fire,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>since she is obligated</b> to pay <b>for</b> the money he gave her, perhaps <b>she betrothed herself</b> with the money she received. <b>And as</b> for the reason why <b>she did this</b> act of destroying the money, <b>she thought: I will test this man</b> to see <b>if he is</b> an individual of <b>an angry</b> temperament <b>or not.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that even in that case it is not a betrothal.

### Part 6
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:9): If a man said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with one hundred dinars,</b> and she said to him: <b>Give</b> the money <b>to</b> my <b>father,</b> or: Give the money <b>to your father, she is not betrothed.</b> If she said: Give the money to my father, or Give the money to your father <b>on the condition that he accepts them for me, she is betrothed.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara comments: The <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> the case where she said: Give the money to my <b>father, to convey the far-reaching nature of</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the first clause.</b> If she simply said that he should give the money to anybody else, even her own father, whom it can be assumed she wants to benefit, she is still not betrothed. And the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> the case where she said: Give the money to <b>your father, to convey the far-reaching nature of</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the latter clause.</b> If she said that someone else should receive the money on her behalf, it is a valid betrothal even if she said the money should be given to his father.

### Part 8
The Gemara cites a similar case. If he said to her: <b>Be betrothed to me with one hundred dinars,</b> and she said to him: <b>Give them to so-and-so, she is not betrothed.</b> But if she said to him: <b>On the condition that he accepts them for me, she is betrothed.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>It is necessary</b> to issue this ruling, despite the fact that it is apparently identical to the previous <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 9
The Gemara elaborates: This is <b>because if</b> the <i>tanna</i> had <b>taught us</b> only the case where she said: <b>Give</b> the money <b>to</b> my <b>father,</b> or: Give the money <b>to your father,</b> one would say that <b>it is</b> in that case <b>there, when she said: On the condition that</b> one of these relatives <b>accepts them for me,</b> that <b>it is a betrothal, as she relies on them</b> and she <b>thinks: They will do my bidding for me</b> and will hold this money on my behalf. <b>But</b> if she says: Give it to <b>so-and-so,</b> someone who is not related to either of them, <b>no,</b> the betrothal is not valid.

### Part 10
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if</b> the <i>tanna</i> had <b>taught us</b> only the case of <b>so-and-so,</b> one might say: <b>It is here, when she said: Give it to so-and-so,</b> that <b>it is not a betrothal,</b> as <b>she is not close to him</b> and is not interested in <b>giving him</b> this money <b>as a gift. But</b> if she said: <b>Give</b> the money <b>to</b> my <b>father,</b> or: Give the money <b>to your father, to whom she is close,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>she gave it to them as a gift,</b> i.e., she accepted the sum as her betrothal money and decided to give it as a gift. If so, she should be betrothed. <b>It was</b> therefore <b>necessary</b> for the <i>tanna</i> to issue both rulings and clarify that she is not betrothed in either case.

### Part 11
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If a man said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with one hundred dinars,</b> and she said to him: <b>Place them on a rock, she is not betrothed. And if</b> the <b>rock was hers, she is betrothed. Rav Beivai raises a dilemma:</b> If the <b>rock was</b> the property <b>of both of them, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? No answer was found, and the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 12
The Gemara discusses a similar case. If a man said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with a loaf</b> of bread, and she said to him: <b>Give it to a dog, she is not betrothed. And if</b> this <b>dog was hers, she is betrothed. Rav Mari raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>a dog</b> was <b>chasing her</b> to bite her, and she said to him: Give the loaf to the dog, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

### Part 13
The Gemara presents the two sides of the dilemma: Does one say that <b>she commits herself</b> to betrothal <b>and transfers herself</b> to him <b>through this benefit that</b> she receives <b>by being rescued</b> from the dog? <b>Or perhaps she can say to him: By Torah law you are required to rescue me,</b> due to the injunction: “Neither shall you stand idly by the blood of your neighbor” (Leviticus 19:16), and therefore she is not betrothed with the loaf because she does not owe him anything. This problem is also left unanswered, and the Gemara again states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 14
If a man said to a woman: <b>Be betrothed to me with a loaf</b> of bread, and she said: <b>Give it to a poor person, she is not betrothed, even</b> if it was <b>a poor person who is dependent upon her,</b> i.e., a poor person who regularly receives food from that woman. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? She could <b>say to him: Just as I am required</b> to give charity to <b>him, so too you are required</b> to give charity to <b>him.</b> Therefore, this donation is not an indication that she has agreed to the betrothal.

### Part 15
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who was selling</b>
