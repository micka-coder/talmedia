### Part 1
<b>Before the hoary head of an elder you shall stand and revere; you shall stand and revere the face of an elder. From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the Merciful One <b>did not write this</b> and thereby divide the two concepts, <b>learn from it</b> that “elder” and “hoary head” are together referring to <b>one</b> type of person.

### Part 2
<b>The Master said</b> previously in the <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should revere him through money,</b> i.e., he is required to give him money in his honor; therefore, <b>the verse states: “You shall stand and you shall revere”</b> (Leviticus 19:32). <b>Just as standing includes no monetary loss, so too, reverence</b> is referring to an action <b>that includes no monetary loss.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>standing include no monetary loss</b> at all? <b>Are we not dealing</b> with a case <b>where he was piercing pearls,</b> a highly remunerative task, <b>and in the meantime he must stand</b> for the elder <b>and</b> thereby <b>neglect his work,</b> which causes him a loss?

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes standing to reverence: Just as reverence does not include neglect</b> of work, <b>so too, standing does not include neglect</b> of work; therefore, one who is engaged in work is not obligated to stand before an elder. <b>And</b> the verse <b>also juxtaposes reverence to standing: Just as standing includes no monetary loss,</b> as standing applies only when it does not entail neglect of work, as explained previously, <b>so too, reverence</b> is referring to an action <b>that includes no monetary loss. From here</b> the Sages <b>stated: Craftsmen are not permitted to stand before Torah scholars when they are engaged in their work.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> are craftsmen <b>not</b> required to stand before Torah scholars? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:3): When farmers bring their first fruits to Jerusalem, <b>all craftsmen stand before them, and greet them, and say to them: Our brothers from such and such a place, welcome!</b> Since craftsmen would stand even for those engaged in a mitzva, all the more so should they stand for Torah scholars. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> There is no difficulty here, as indeed <b>they stood before</b> those bringing first fruits, and yet <b>they would not stand before Torah scholars.</b>

### Part 5
Based on this <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin says: Come and see how beloved is a mitzva</b> performed <b>in its</b> proper <b>time, as</b> the craftsmen <b>stood before those</b> who were fulfilling a mitzva, whereas <b>they did not stand before Torah scholars.</b> The Gemara responds: This does not prove that the same applies to all mitzvot performed in their proper times, as <b>perhaps it is different there,</b> with regard to the bringing of the first fruits; for <b>if so,</b> i.e., if one does not treat those who bring first fruits with such honor, they will not want to come at all, <b>and you will cause them to stumble</b> and sin <b>in the future.</b> Consequently, the Sages instituted that those bringing first fruits should be treated with special honor. This reasoning does not apply to people performing other mitzvot.

### Part 6
<b>The Master said</b> previously: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one should</b> also <b>stand before</b> an Elder <b>in the lavatory or in the bathhouse;</b> therefore, the verse said: “You shall stand and you shall revere,” which indicates that the mitzva of standing applies only in a place where there is reverence. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does one <b>not</b> show honor in a lavatory? <b>But Rabbi Ḥiyya was sitting</b> in <b>a bathhouse and Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>passed by, and he did not stand before him. And</b> Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>became angry and went and said to his father,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>I taught</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>two</b> of the <b>five</b> parts <b>of the book of Psalms, and</b> yet <b>he did not stand before me.</b> This indicates that a display of honor is appropriate even in a bathhouse.

### Part 7
<b>And furthermore, bar Kappara, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yosei, was sitting in a bathhouse. Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>entered and passed by, and he did not stand before him.</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>became angry and went and said to his father: I taught him two</b> of the <b>nine</b> parts <b>of <i>Torat Kohanim</i>,</b> the halakhic midrash on Leviticus, <b>and</b> yet <b>he did not stand before me. And</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon: <b>Perhaps he was sitting and contemplating</b> what you taught him and did not see you come in.

### Part 8
The Gemara explains the proof: The fact that <b>the reason</b> he might have been exempt was <b>that he was sitting and pondering</b> the lessons indicates that <b>if that were not so,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would <b>not</b> have justified such behavior. One must stand before a Sage even in a bathhouse.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>halakha</i>, that one is not required to stand in a bathhouse, applies <b>to the inner rooms,</b> where everyone is naked; standing in a place of this kind certainly does not bestow honor. <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i>, that one is obligated to stand in a bathhouse, applies <b>to the outer rooms,</b> where people are still dressed. Standing is a sign of respect in these rooms.

### Part 10
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that this is the correct explanation, <b>as Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One is permitted to contemplate</b> matters of Torah <b>everywhere, except for the bathhouse and the lavatory.</b> Since Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi suggested that the student might have been sitting and pondering his studies, it can be assumed that the episode occurred in a location where only some of the <i>halakhot</i> governing one’s behavior in a bathhouse apply, i.e., the outer rooms. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Perhaps one</b> whose studies are <b>beyond his control is different;</b> it is possible he was so absorbed in Torah study that he forgot that he was in a place where it is prohibited to think about sacred matters.

### Part 11
It is taught in the same <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one may close his eyes like one who does not see</b> the elder; therefore, the verse states: “Before the hoary head you shall stand, and you shall revere the face of an elder, and you shall fear your God” (Leviticus 19:32). The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>we are dealing with wicked people</b> who would intentionally act this way to avoid fulfilling a mitzva?

### Part 12
<b>Rather,</b> this means: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one may close his eyes before the obligation</b> to stand <b>arrives,</b> i.e., when the elder is still far off. This would mean <b>that when the obligation</b> does <b>arrive he will not see him,</b> such <b>that</b> he would be required <b>to stand before him.</b> In this manner he thinks that he can avoid the obligation altogether. Therefore <b>the verse states: “You shall stand…and you shall fear,”</b> i.e., one should fear He who knows the secrets of one’s heart.

### Part 13
§ A Sage <b>taught: What is</b> the type of <b>standing that indicates reverence? You must say</b> that this applies when it is clear that one is standing in the elder’s honor, which is within <b>four cubits</b> of him. <b>Abaye said: We said</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that one must stand within four cubits of the elder, <b>only with regard to</b> one <b>who is not his primary teacher; but for his primary teacher</b> he must stand when he is <b>within his range of vision,</b> i.e., as soon as he sees him, even if he is more than four cubits away.

### Part 14
The Gemara likewise reports that <b>Abaye would stand as soon as he saw the ear of Rav Yosef’s donkey coming</b> toward him. The Gemara relates: <b>Abaye was riding a donkey along the bank of the Sagya River. Rav Mesharshiyya and</b> other <b>rabbis were sitting on the other bank</b> of the river, <b>and they did not stand before him.</b> Abaye <b>said to them: Am I not</b> your <b>primary teacher?</b> You are therefore required to stand before me, despite the fact that I am far away. <b>They said to him: That</b> did <b>not</b> enter <b>our minds,</b> i.e., we did not see you at all.

### Part 15
§ It was further stated in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>an elder should not trouble</b> others to honor him? <b>The verse states:</b> “And you shall revere the face of <b>an elder, and you shall fear</b> your God.” <b>Abaye said: We have a tradition that if</b> a Sage <b>circumnavigates</b> an area so that people will not have to stand before him, he <b>will live</b> a long life. The Gemara relates that <b>Abaye</b> would <b>circumnavigate</b> an area, and likewise <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> would <b>circumnavigate</b> an area.

### Part 16
The Gemara cites another incident involving honor one demonstrates for his teacher. Once, when <b>Ravina was sitting before Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti, a certain man passed before him and did not cover his head.</b> Ravina <b>said: How rude is this man,</b> who does not show respect by covering his head in honor of a rabbi. Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti <b>said to him: Perhaps he is from</b> the city of <b>Mata Meḥasya, where rabbis are common</b> and the people living there are consequently not as careful to display honor as those in other places.

### Part 17
§ It was stated previously that <b>Isi ben Yehuda says</b> that as the verse states: <b>“Before the hoary head you shall stand,”</b> it indicates that <b>even anyone of hoary head is included,</b> not only a Torah scholar. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Isi ben Yehuda.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> himself <b>would stand before Aramean,</b> i.e., gentile, <b>elders. He said: How many experiences [<i>harpatkei</i>] have occurred to these</b> individuals. It is appropriate to honor them, due to the wisdom they have garnered from their long lives. <b>Rava would not stand before them,</b> but <b>he displayed reverence to them.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Abaye would extend a hand to elders</b> so that they could lean on him. <b>Rava would send his agent</b> to help them. <b>Rav Naḥman would send officers [<i>goza’ei</i>],</b> his servants, to assist elders. <b>He said: If not for the Torah, how many</b> people named <b>Naḥman bar Abba would there be in the marketplace?</b> In other words, I am not permitted to treat my Torah study lightly by assisting them myself, as I can perform this mitzva through others.

### Part 19
<b>Rabbi Aivu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b>
