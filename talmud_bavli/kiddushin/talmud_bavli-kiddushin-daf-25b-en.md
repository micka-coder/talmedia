### Part 1
The Gemara comments that the first question with regard to castration of the testicles is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> It is stated with regard to animals that cannot be used as offerings due to blemishes: <b>“That whose stones are bruised, or crushed, or torn, or cut</b> you shall not sacrifice to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:24). <b>All</b> of these blemishes <b>are</b> referring <b>to</b> the animal’s <b>testicles;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: Could Rabbi Yehuda possibly mean that these blemishes apply only <b>to the testicles and not to the penis?</b> Certainly these should also be considered blemishes if they affect the penis, which is more exposed than the testicles. <b>Rather,</b> this is what the <i>baraita</i> is saying: <b>All of</b> these blemishes apply <b>to the testicles also;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: All of them</b> apply only <b>to the penis. Rabbi Yosei states</b> the following distinction: <b>“Bruised or crushed”</b> applies <b>to the testicles also.</b> Conversely, when there are areas that are <b>“broken or cut” on the penis, yes,</b> these are considered a blemish, but <b>on the testicles, no,</b> they are not a blemish.

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A large domesticated animal is acquired by passing,</b> when its current owner transfers it to a buyer by giving him the reins or the bit. <b>And a small</b> domesticated animal is acquired <b>by lifting.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Eliezer. And the Rabbis say: A small domesticated animal can be acquired by pulling</b> also, and there is no need to lift it.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav taught in</b> the town of <b>Kimḥonya: A large domesticated animal is acquired by pulling. Shmuel found Rav’s students</b> and <b>said to them: Did Rav</b> actually <b>say that a large domesticated animal is acquired by pulling? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that it is acquired <b>by passing? And</b> several times I <b>also</b> heard <b>Rav say</b> that it is acquired <b>by passing.</b> Did <b>he retract that</b> ruling? Rav’s students replied: In fact, Rav retracted that ruling and <b>he states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And the Rabbis say: Both</b> small and large domesticated animals <b>are acquired by pulling. Rabbi Shimon says: Both</b> are acquired <b>by lifting.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yosef objects to</b> this: <b>If that is so, by what</b> mode of acqui-sition <b>can an elephant be acquired, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon?</b> It is impossible to lift an elephant. <b>Abaye said to him:</b> It is possible to acquire it <b>by the</b> mode of acquisition of symbolic <b>exchange,</b> a legal act of acquisition formalizing the transfer of ownership of an article. <b>Alternatively,</b> one can acquire an elephant <b>by renting its place</b> temporarily and acquiring the elephant by means of the ground upon which it is standing.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that there is another method: One <b>brings four vessels and places them under</b> the elephant’s <b>feet,</b> and he thereby acquires it like any other item that is inside the buyer’s vessels. The Gemara asks: Can <b>you learn from</b> Rabbi Zeira’s statement that if the <b>buyer’s vessels,</b> being used to acquire an item from the seller, <b>are in the seller’s domain, the buyer acquires</b> the item? The Gemara rejects this: This is no proof, as <b>with what are we dealing here?</b> The case in question is one where the vessels are not in the seller’s domain but <b>in an alley [<i>simta</i>],</b> which is neither a public nor a private domain. In a place of this kind the buyer’s vessels certainly effect acquisition for him.
