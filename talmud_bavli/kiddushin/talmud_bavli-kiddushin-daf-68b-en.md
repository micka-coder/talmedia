### Part 1
<b>from where do we</b> derive that <b>her offspring is like her?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew slave who marries a Canaanite maidservant: <b>“The wife and her children shall be her master’s”</b> (Exodus 21:4). This indicates that the offspring of a Canaanite maidservant and a Hebrew slave are slaves, as she is.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that betrothal with <b>a gentile woman</b> is ineffective? <b>The verse states: “Neither shall you make marriages with them”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:3), which teaches that marrying gentile women is halakhically meaningless. The Gemara asks: <b>We have found that betrothal is ineffective with her; from where do we</b> derive that <b>her offspring is like her?</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: As the verse states</b> with regard to the same issue: “Your daughter you shall not give to his son…<b>for he will turn away your son from following Me”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:3–4). Since the verse is concerned that after one’s daughter marries a gentile, the father will lead his children away from the service of God, this indicates that <b>your son,</b> i.e., your grandson, <b>from a Jewish woman is called “your son”</b> by the Torah, <b>but your son from a gentile woman is not called your son, but her son.</b>

### Part 4
<b>Ravina said: Learn from</b> it that <b>the son of your daughter, born to a gentile, is called your son</b> in all regards. The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Ravina holds</b> that with regard to <b>a gentile or</b> a Canaanite <b>slave who engaged in sexual intercourse with a Jewish woman, the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>?</b> One can infer from the fact that the offspring of this union is called “your son” that he is a Jew, and therefore the principle stated in the mishna should apply: If a woman cannot join in betrothal with someone, their child is a <i>mamzer</i>.

### Part 5
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Although he is not a fit</b> offspring, <b>he is</b> also <b>not a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> Rather, <b>he is</b> merely <b>called disqualified.</b> Since betrothal is inapplicable to a gentile, a gentile is not included in the category of someone with whom a Jewish woman cannot personally join in betrothal, as no Jewish women can be betrothed to him. Nevertheless, as their child’s birth is the result of a transgression, he is considered disqualified.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement. <b>That</b> verse: “Neither shall you make marriages with them” (Deuteronomy 7:3), <b>is written with regard to the seven nations</b> of Canaan. <b>From where do we</b> derive that betrothal does not take effect with the <b>other nations?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> as a reason for prohibiting intermarriages: <b>“For he will turn away your son</b> from following Me,” which serves <b>to include all those who might turn</b> a child <b>away,</b> no matter from which nation.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who expounds the reason</b> for the mitzvot of <b>the verse</b> and rules accordingly. Since the reason is that the gentile might turn away the son’s heart, there should be no distinction between the Canaanite nations and other gentiles. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who do not expound the reason for the mitzvot of the verse and rule accordingly, since the verse mentions only the Canaanite nations, <b>what is the reason,</b> the source for the prohibition, with regard to the other nations?

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a beautiful captive woman: <b>“And after that you may go in to her and be her husband,</b> and she shall be your wife” (Deuteronomy 21:13). One can derive from here <b>by inference that at the outset,</b> before she became a Jew, <b>betrothal would not take effect with her,</b> despite the fact that he had already brought her into his house, and according to some opinions, had even engaged in sexual intercourse with her.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks another question: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>betrothal is ineffective with her; from where do we</b> derive that <b>her child is like her?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “If a man has</b> two wives, the one beloved and the one hated, <b>and they have borne him</b> children” (Deuteronomy 21:15), from which it is derived: <b>Anywhere that we read: “If he has,”</b> i.e., that a woman can be betrothed, <b>we</b> also <b>read: “And they have borne him,”</b> meaning that their children follow his lineage. <b>And anywhere that we do not read: “If he has,” we</b> likewise <b>do not read: “And they have borne him,”</b> as the offspring inherit their mother’s status.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> one should learn from here with regard to a Canaanite <b>maidservant too,</b> that her child is like her, which means that the earlier proof from the verse: “The wife and her children” (Exodus 21:4), is not necessary. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so;</b> this source also teaches the <i>halakha</i> that the offspring of a maidservant is like her. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse <b>“The wife and her children shall be her master’s”?</b> This verse apparently teaches nothing new with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of lineage. The Gemara answers: It is required <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:
