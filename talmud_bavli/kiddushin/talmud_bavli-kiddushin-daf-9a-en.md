### Part 1
<b>beads [<i>ḥumrei</i>]of glass [<i>petakhyata</i>]. A certain woman came</b> and <b>said to him: Give me one string. He said to her: If I give you</b> this string <b>will you be betrothed to me</b> with it? <b>She said to him: Give, give. Rav Ḥama said: Any</b> use of the expression: <b>Give, give, is nothing.</b> Although she said: Give, give, she did not agree to the condition, as she was mocking him and had no intention of actually becoming betrothed.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates a similar incident: There was <b>a certain man who was drinking wine in a store. A woman came</b> in and <b>said to him: Give me one cup</b> of wine. <b>He said to her: If I give you</b> a cup of wine will <b>you be betrothed to me</b> with it? <b>She said to him: Give to drink, give</b> it <b>to me to drink. Rav Ḥama said</b> that <b>any</b> use of the expression: <b>Give to drink, give</b> it <b>to me to drink, is nothing,</b> i.e., she certainly did not intend to accept the condition and she is not betrothed.

### Part 3
The Gemara further relates: There was <b>a certain man who was picking dates from a date tree. A certain woman came</b> and <b>said to him: Throw me two. He said to her: If I throw</b> two dates <b>to you</b> will <b>you be betrothed to me</b> with them? <b>She said to him: Throw, throw. Rav Zevid said: Any use</b> of the expression: <b>Throw, throw, is nothing,</b> and she is not betrothed.

### Part 4
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If she said: <b>Give,</b> or: <b>Give to drink,</b> or: <b>Throw,</b> without the additional emphasis of the repetition, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does this straightforward statement indicate that she actually meant him to give it to her in accordance with his stated condition, or does she not agree to betrothal even here? <b>Ravina said: She is betrothed. Rav Sama bar Rakta said</b> in the form of an oath: <b>By the king’s crown! She is not betrothed.</b> The Gemara states: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>she is not betrothed.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara issues further rulings concerning the previous cases. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: With regard to <b>silk</b> garments that are worth more than one <i>peruta</i>, <b>appraisal</b> is <b>not necessary</b> before a woman can be betrothed with them. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> that if a man promised a woman one hundred dinars as betrothal money and gave her only a dinar, she is betrothed. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava,</b> who said that <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that if he promised one hundred dinars and gave her only collateral, this is not a valid betrothal.

### Part 6
§ <b>The Sages taught: How is</b> betrothal performed <b>with a document?</b> If he <b>wrote</b> the following <b>for</b> a young woman’s father <b>on paper or earthenware, despite</b> the fact <b>that</b> the paper or earthenware <b>is not worth one <i>peruta</i>: Your daughter is betrothed [<i>mekuddeshet</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>Your daughter is betrothed [<i>me’oreset</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>Your daughter is to me as a wife,</b> then <b>she is betrothed.</b> There is no requirement for the paper or earthenware to be worth one <i>peruta</i>, as she is not betrothed through the value of the paper or earthenware.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Zeira bar Memel objects to this</b> description of the writing of the document: <b>But this document is not comparable to a bill of sale. There,</b> in the case of a bill of sale, the <b>seller</b> is the one who <b>writes to</b> the buyer: <b>My field is sold to you. Here,</b> the <b>husband,</b> who is akin to a buyer, is the one who <b>writes: Your daughter is betrothed to me.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rava said: There,</b> in the case of a sale, the formulation of the document is taken <b>from the context of the verse, and here,</b> in the case of betrothal, the formulation of the document is likewise taken <b>from the context of the verse.</b> Rava elaborates: <b>There,</b> with regard to a sale, <b>it is written: “And sells of his ancestral land”</b> (Leviticus 25:25), which indicates that <b>the Merciful One renders</b> the transaction <b>dependent on the seller. Here, it is written: “If</b> a man <b>takes</b> a woman” (Deuteronomy 22:13), meaning that <b>the Merciful One renders</b> the betrothal <b>dependent on the husband.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>There,</b> in the case of a sale, <b>it is also written: “Men shall buy [<i>yiknu</i>] fields for money”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44), which indicates that the matter depends upon the buyer. The Gemara answers: <b>Read into</b> the verse: Shall sell <b>[<i>yikkanu</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you read it</b> as <b><i>yikkanu</i>; because it is written</b> in the verse in Leviticus: <b>“And sells,”</b> and there is a preference to have the verse from the Prophets accord with that of the Torah? <b>So too,</b> instead of: “If a man takes [<i>ki yikaḥ</i>]” (Deuteronomy 22:13), <b>read into</b> the verse: When he is given <b>[<i>ki yakiaḥ</i>], as it is written: “I gave my daughter to this man”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16), so that the verses will accord with each other.

### Part 10
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> There is no proof from the verses for these rulings, as <b>they are a <i>halakha</i></b> received through tradition, <b>and the Sages based them on</b> the <b>verses. And if you wish, say: There too,</b> in the case in Jeremiah, <b>it is written</b> with regard to the buyer: <b>“And I took the deed of purchase”</b> (Jeremiah 32:11), thereby indicating that it is the seller who writes the document.

### Part 11
<b>And Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> If he <b>wrote</b> the following <b>for him on paper or earthenware, despite</b> the fact <b>that</b> the paper or earthenware <b>is not worth one <i>peruta</i>: Your daughter is betrothed [<i>mekuddeshet</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>Your daughter is betrothed [<i>me’oreset</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>Your daughter is to me as a wife, whether</b> he gave it <b>to her father or whether</b> he gave it directly <b>to her, she is betrothed with the consent</b> of her father. <b>And this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> provided <b>that she has not</b> yet <b>reached her majority,</b> before which her father alone has the authority to betroth her.

### Part 12
<b>If he wrote for her on paper or earthenware, despite</b> the fact <b>that</b> the paper or earthenware <b>is not worth one <i>peruta</i>: You are hereby betrothed [<i>mekuddeshet</i>] to me,</b> or: <b>You are hereby to me as a wife,</b> or: <b>You are hereby betrothed [<i>me’oreset</i>] to me,</b> then <b>she is betrothed whether</b> he gave it <b>to her father</b> or <b>to her,</b> as long as this was <b>with her consent. And this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> provided <b>that she has reached her majority</b> and is under her own authority.

### Part 13
§ <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a document of betrothal that was written not for her sake,</b> i.e., not for this particular woman, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do <b>we juxtapose</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the <b>modes of becoming</b> betrothed <b>to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the <b>modes of leaving</b> a marriage, i.e., divorce? If so, one should say: <b>Just as</b>
