### Part 1
<b>“Say to wisdom: You are my sister,</b> and call understanding your kinswoman” (Proverbs 7:4), which indicates that one should be as knowledgeable in the Torah as in the identity of his sister. <b>And it states: “Bind them upon your fingers, you shall write them upon the tablet of your heart”</b> (Proverbs 7:3). <b>And it states: “As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of one’s youth”</b> (Psalms 127:4). <b>And it states: “Sharp arrows of the mighty”</b> (Psalms 120:4). <b>And it states: “Your arrows are sharp, the peoples fall under you”</b> (Psalms 45:6). <b>And it states: “Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them; they shall not be put to shame when they speak with their enemies in the gate”</b> (Psalms 127:5).

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“enemies in the gate”</b> with regard to Torah study? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: Even a father and his son,</b> or <b>a rabbi and his student, who are engaged in Torah</b> together <b>in one gate become enemies with each other</b> due to the intensity of their studies. <b>But they do not leave there until they love each other, as it is stated</b> in the verse discussing the places the Jewish people engaged in battle in the wilderness: “Therefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord, <b>Vahev in Suphah [<i>beSufa</i>],</b> and the valleys of Arnon” (Numbers 21:14). The word “<i>vahev</i>” is interpreted as related to the word for love, <i>ahava</i>. Additionally, <b>do not read</b> this as <b>“in Suphah [<i>beSufa</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as <b>“at its end [<i>besofa</i>],”</b> i.e., at the conclusion of their dispute they are beloved to each other.

### Part 3
<b>The Sages taught: “And you shall place [<i>vesamtem</i>]</b> these words of Mine in your hearts” (Deuteronomy 11:18). Read this as though it stated <b><i>sam tam</i>, a perfect elixir. The Torah is compared to an elixir of life.</b> There is <b>a parable that</b> illustrates this: <b>A person hit his son with a strong blow and placed a bandage on his wound. And he said to him: My son, as long as this bandage is on your wound</b> and is healing you, <b>eat what you enjoy and drink what you enjoy, and bathe in either hot water or cold water, and you do not need to be afraid,</b> as it will heal your wound. <b>But if you take it off,</b> the wound <b>will become gangrenous.</b>

### Part 4
<b>So</b> too <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Israel: My children, I created an evil inclination,</b> which is the wound, <b>and I created Torah as its antidote. If you are engaged in Torah</b> study <b>you will not be given over into the hand</b> of the evil inclination, <b>as it is stated: “If you do well, shall it not be lifted up?”</b> (Genesis 4:7). One who engages in Torah study lifts himself above the evil inclination.

### Part 5
<b>And if you do not engage in Torah</b> study, <b>you are given over to its power, as it is stated: “Sin crouches at the door”</b> (Genesis 4:7). <b>Moreover, all</b> of the evil inclination’s <b>deliberations</b> will be <b>concerning you, as it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“And to you is its desire.” And if you wish you shall rule over it, as it is stated</b> in the conclusion of the verse: <b>“But you may rule over it”</b> (Genesis 4:7).

### Part 6
<b>The Sages taught:</b> So <b>difficult is the evil inclination that even its Creator calls it evil, as it is stated: “For the inclination of a man’s heart is evil from his youth”</b> (Genesis 8:21). <b>Rav Yitzḥak says: A person’s</b> evil <b>inclination renews itself to him every day, as it is stated:</b> “And that every inclination of the thoughts in his heart was <b>only evil all day [<i>kol hayyom</i>]”</b> (Genesis 6:5). “<i>Kol hayyom</i>” can also be understood as: Every day.

### Part 7
<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Levi says: A person’s inclination overpowers him every day, and seeks to kill him, as it is stated: “The wicked watches the righteous and seeks to slay him”</b> (Psalms 37:32). <b>And if not</b> for the fact that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, assists</b> each person in battling his evil inclination, <b>he could not</b> overcome <b>it, as it is stated: “The Lord will not leave him in his hand”</b> (Psalms 37:33).

### Part 8
A Sage from <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: My son, if this wretched one,</b> the evil inclination, <b>encounters you, pull it into the study hall,</b> i.e., go and study Torah. <b>If it is a stone</b> it will <b>melt, and if it is iron</b> it will <b>break, as it is stated</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“Is not My word like fire, says the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29). Just as a stone shatters a hammer, so too one can overcome his evil inclination, which is as strong as iron, through Torah study. With regard to the second part of the statement: <b>If it is a stone</b> it will <b>melt,</b> this is <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1), <b>and it states: “The water wears the stones”</b> (Job 14:19), indicating that water is stronger than stone.

### Part 9
§ The <i>baraita</i> (29a) teaches that a father is commanded <b>to marry</b> his son to <b>a woman.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this matter? <b>As it is written: “Take wives and bear sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to men”</b> (Jeremiah 29:6).

### Part 10
The Gemara analyzes this verse: <b>Granted</b> with regard to <b>his son,</b> this is <b>in his power,</b> i.e., he can instruct him to marry a woman, as a man is the active agent in a marriage. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>his daughter, is</b> this <b>in his power?</b> She must wait for a man to marry her. The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> Jeremiah was <b>saying to them</b> in the aforementioned verse: Her father should <b>give her something</b> for her dowry, <b>and he should dress and cover her</b> with suitable clothing <b>so that men will leap to</b> marry <b>her.</b>

### Part 11
§ The <i>baraita</i> further states that a father is commanded <b>to teach</b> his son <b>a trade.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>Ḥizkiyya said: As the verse states: “Enjoy life with the wife whom you love”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:9). <b>If</b> this verse is interpreted literally, and <b>it</b> is referring to <b>an actual woman,</b> then one can derive as follows: <b>Just as</b> a father <b>is obligated to marry</b> his son <b>to a woman, so too, he is obligated to teach him a trade,</b> as indicated by the term: Life. <b>And if</b> the wife mentioned in this verse is allegorical, and <b>it is the Torah,</b> then one should explain the verse in the following manner: <b>Just as he is obligated to teach him Torah, so too, he is obligated to teach him a trade.</b>

### Part 12
§ The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And some say</b> that a father is <b>also</b> obligated <b>to teach</b> his son <b>to swim in a river.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>It is</b> necessary for <b>his life,</b> i.e., this is potentially a lifesaving skill.

### Part 13
§ The <i>baraita</i> further teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Any</b> father <b>who does not teach</b> his son <b>a trade teaches him banditry.</b> The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that he actually teaches him <b>banditry? Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that it is <b>as though he taught him banditry.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> and that of Rabbi Yehuda? Both state that a father must teach his son a trade. The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> in a case <b>where</b> the father <b>teaches him</b> to engage in <b>business.</b> According to the first <i>tanna</i> this is sufficient, whereas Rabbi Yehuda maintains that he must teach him an actual trade.

### Part 15
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>all mitzvot of a father with regard to his son,</b> both men and women are obligated to perform them. The Gemara inquires: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the expression: <b>All mitzvot of a father with regard to his son? If we say</b> that this is referring to <b>all of the mitzvot that a father is required to perform for his son,</b> are <b>women obligated</b> in these? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A father is obligated with regard to his son to circumcise him, and to redeem him?</b> This indicates that <b>his father, yes,</b> he is obligated to do these, but <b>his mother, no,</b> she is not obligated to perform these mitzvot for her son.

### Part 16
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>each mitzva</b> for <b>the father that is incumbent upon the son to perform for his father, both men and women are obligated</b> in them. The Gemara comments: <b>We</b> already <b>learned this, as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the verse: <b>“A man</b> shall fear [<i>tira’u</i>] his mother and his father” (Leviticus 19:3). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a man</b> is obligated in this mitzva; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>a woman</b> is also obligated? <b>When it says</b> in the same verse: <b>“A man shall fear [<i>tira’u</i>] his mother and his father”</b> (Leviticus 19:3), employing the plural form of the verb, this indicates that <b>there are two</b> that are obligated <b>here,</b> both a man and a woman.

### Part 17
<b>If so,</b> that both of them are obligated, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Man”?</b> In the case of <b>a man,</b> it is <b>in his power to perform</b> this mitzva; whereas with regard to <b>a woman,</b> it is <b>not</b> always <b>in her power to perform</b> this mitzva, <b>because she is under the authority of another</b> person, i.e., her husband. As she is obligated to her husband to maintain her household, she is not always able to find time for her parents. <b>Rav Idi bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> Consequently, if a woman <b>is divorced,</b> then <b>both of them,</b> a daughter and a son, are <b>equal</b> with regard to honoring and fearing their father and mother.

### Part 18
<b>The Sages taught</b> that <b>it is stated: “Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:11), <b>and it is stated: “Honor the Lord with your wealth”</b> (Proverbs 3:9). In this manner, <b>the verse equates the honor of one’s father and mother to the honor of the Omnipresent,</b> as the term “honor” is used in both cases.

### Part 19
Similarly, <b>it is stated: “A man shall fear his mother and his father”</b> (Leviticus 19:3), <b>and it is stated: “You shall fear the Lord your God and Him you shall serve”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13). <b>The verse equates the fear of one’s father and mother to the fear of the Omnipresent.</b>

### Part 20
Likewise, <b>it is stated: “He who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:17), <b>and it is stated: “Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin”</b> (Leviticus 24:15). <b>The verse equates the blessing,</b> a euphemism for cursing, <b>of</b> one’s <b>father and mother to the blessing of the Omnipresent. But with regard to striking,</b> i.e., with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that one who strikes his father or mother is liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, <b>it is certainly not possible</b> to say the same concerning the Holy One, Blessed be He.

### Part 21
<b>And so</b> too, the equating of one’s attitude toward his parents to his attitude toward God is <b>a logical derivation, as the three of them are partners in his</b> creation. As <b>the Sages taught: There are three partners in</b> the forming of <b>a person: The Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> who provides the soul, <b>and his father and his mother. When a person honors his father and mother, the Holy One, Blessed be He, says: I ascribe</b> credit <b>to them as if I dwelt between them and they honor Me</b> as well.

### Part 22
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: It is revealed and known before the One Who spoke and the world came into being that a son honors his mother more than</b> he honors <b>his father, because</b>
