### Part 1
And he <b>renders impure the object upon which he lies like the upper one.</b> One who engages in sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman renders the objects upon which he lies ritually impure even if he has no direct contact with them.

### Part 2
<b>And if she marries a priest she may partake of <i>teruma</i></b> from that point onward. <b>And if one of those with whom sexual relations are forbidden by the Torah</b> (see Leviticus, chapter 18) <b>engages in intercourse with her, he is put to death due to</b> his sin with <b>her, and she is exempt</b> from punishment as a minor. <b>And if someone of unfit</b> lineage, i.e., a man who would disqualify her from marrying a priest if he engaged in sexual intercourse with her, <b>engages in intercourse with her, he has disqualified her from</b> marrying into <b>the priesthood.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 3
The Gemara analyzes this source. <b>It is taught</b> in that <i>baraita</i>: She can be betrothed through <b>sexual intercourse, and it is taught</b> separately: And if <b>she marries</b> a priest. This indicates that intercourse does not effect marriage. The Gemara rejects this: <b>This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>said: If this</b> betrothal through intercourse <b>is a marriage to a priest, she may partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b> It is possible that there are not two separate stages here but a single action, as sexual intercourse effects marriage.

### Part 4
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And Yoḥanan ben Bag Bag already sent</b> a message <b>to Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira in</b> the city of <b>Netzivin: I heard about you that you say</b> that <b>the daughter of a non-priest betrothed</b> to a priest <b>may partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira <b>sent</b> back this reply <b>to him: And do you not say so? I know about you that you are an expert in</b> many <b>areas of Torah; do you not know how to teach</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>based on an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference?

### Part 5
The <i>a fortiori</i> inference is as follows: <b>If</b> in the case of <b>a Canaanite maidservant, whose sexual intercourse</b> with a priest <b>does not allow her to partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as she is not betrothed to him, <b>her money,</b> i.e., if a priest acquires her through money, <b>allows her to partake of <i>teruma</i>, is it not logical</b> with regard to <b>this</b> betrothed woman, <b>whose sexual intercourse</b> with a priest <b>allows her to partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> that <b>her</b> betrothal <b>money</b> from the priest should <b>allow her to partake of <i>teruma</i>?</b> If this is indeed the case, the daughter of a non-priest betrothed to a priest should be permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>But what can I do, as the Sages said:</b> By rabbinic law, <b>the daughter of a non-priest betrothed</b> to a priest <b>may not partake of <i>teruma</i> until she enters the</b> wedding <b>canopy.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the comparison between money and sexual intercourse? <b>If</b> it is referring to a case <b>of sexual intercourse by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy,</b> i.e., after they are married, <b>and</b> betrothal through <b>money</b> where the marriage is then completed <b>by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy, in both</b> cases <b>she may partake of</b> <i>teruma</i> even by rabbinic law, as she is a full-fledged married woman.

### Part 7
<b>Or rather</b> one could say that this comparison is referring to <b>sexual intercourse by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy, and</b> betrothal through <b>money not by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy.</b> If so, the <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not valid, as <b>here,</b> in the case of intercourse, there are <b>two</b> stages of acquisition, intercourse followed by the wedding canopy, <b>and here,</b> in the case of money, there is only <b>one</b> stage. <b>Rather, is it not</b> correct to say that the comparison between money and intercourse is referring <b>to sexual intercourse not by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy and</b> also <b>money not by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy?</b>

### Part 8
<b>Granted, if you say</b> that intercourse by itself <b>effects marriage,</b> it is <b>due to that</b> reason that it <b>is obvious to</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira <b>that</b> the mode of <b>sexual intercourse is stronger than money,</b> and allows her to partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>But if you say</b> that sexual intercourse <b>effects</b> only <b>betrothal, what is different here,</b> in the case of betrothal through intercourse, <b>that it is obvious to him</b> that it allows her to partake of <i>teruma</i>, <b>and what is different here,</b> in the case of betrothal through money, <b>that he is uncertain</b> and must derive the matter through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference? In both cases she is only betrothed.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Actually, I will say to you</b> that he is speaking <b>about sexual intercourse by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy and money not by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy. And</b> as for <b>that which you said</b> in opposition to this <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>Here</b> there are <b>two</b> stages of acquisition, <b>and here</b> there is only <b>one</b> stage. <b>In any event, there is</b> a valid <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference.

### Part 10
<b>And this is what</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira <b>sent him,</b> i.e., his statement should be understood as follows: <b>If a Canaanite maidservant, whose intercourse</b> with a priest <b>does not allow her to partake of <i>teruma</i>, even by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy,</b> and yet <b>her money allows her to partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>without</b> the means of a wedding <b>canopy, is it not logical</b> with regard to <b>this</b> betrothed woman, <b>whose intercourse</b> with a priest <b>allows her to partake of <i>teruma</i> by means of</b> a wedding <b>canopy,</b> that <b>her</b> betrothal <b>money</b> from the priest should <b>allow her to partake of <i>teruma</i> without</b> the means of a wedding <b>canopy?</b>

### Part 11
<b>But what can I do, as the Sages said:</b> By rabbinic law, <b>the daughter of a non-priest betrothed</b> to a priest <b>may not partake of <i>teruma</i> until she enters the</b> wedding <b>canopy, due to</b> the reason stated <b>by Ulla.</b> According to Ulla, there is a concern that she may feed her siblings or members of her family <i>teruma</i> while she is still living in her father’s house.

### Part 12
<b>And ben Bag Bag</b> explains why one cannot accept this <i>a fortiori</i> inference involving a Canaanite maidservant: <b>With regard to a Canaanite maidservant</b> who is purchased with money, the buyer <b>does not leave out</b> anything <b>from her acquisition,</b> i.e., he completes the purchase in full. <b>Here,</b> in the case of betrothal, <b>he leaves out</b> part <b>of her acquisition,</b> as the stage of marriage has yet to be performed. Therefore, these two cases are dissimilar.

### Part 13
<b>Ravina said</b> that <b>by Torah law, it is obvious to</b> Yoḥanan ben Bag Bag <b>that</b> she <b>may partake of</b> <i>teruma</i> also when she is betrothed to a priest through money alone, as she is acquired with his money. <b>And</b> the question <b>that he sent him</b> is referring to the <i>halakha</i> <b>by rabbinic law.</b>

### Part 14
Ravina elaborates: <b>And this is</b> the question <b>that he sent to him: I heard about you that you say</b> that in practice <b>the daughter of a non-priest betrothed</b> to a priest <b>may partake of <i>teruma</i>, and we are not concerned about an annulling factor [<i>simfon</i>],</b> i.e., that he might find some blemish in her through which the betrothal would be considered retroactively invalid. If so, she would have eaten <i>teruma</i> when she was not permitted to do so. And it was with regard to this issue that Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira <b>sent to him: And do you not say this? I know about you that you are an expert in</b> many <b>areas of Torah; do you not know how to teach</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>based on an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference?

### Part 15
The <i>a fortiori</i> inference is as follows: <b>If a Canaanite maidservant, whose</b> engaging in <b>intercourse</b> with a priest <b>does not allow her to partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> and yet <b>her</b> receiving purchase <b>money allows her to partake of <i>teruma</i>, and we are not concerned about <i>simfon</i>,</b> i.e., that the Canaanite maidservant may have some physical blemish that nullifies her purchase retroactively, <b>is it not logical</b> with regard to <b>this</b> betrothed woman, <b>whose intercourse</b> with a priest <b>allows her to partake of <i>teruma</i>, that her</b> receiving betrothal <b>money</b> from the priest should <b>allow her to partake of <i>teruma</i></b> even before entering the wedding canopy, <b>and we should not be concerned about <i>simfon</i>? But what can I do, as the Sages said:</b> By rabbinic law <b>the daughter of a non-priest betrothed</b> to a priest <b>may not partake of <i>teruma</i></b>
