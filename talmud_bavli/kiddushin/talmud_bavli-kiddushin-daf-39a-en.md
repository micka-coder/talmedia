### Part 1
<b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> in the same manner in both cases, <b>either</b> by stating in <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case that <b>one may go down and purchase</b> the produce, <b>or</b> by stating in <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case that <b>one may go down and gather</b> the produce. The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t Shmuel say to Rav Anan</b> that one should <b>teach it either</b> as stating in <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case that <b>one may go down and purchase</b> the produce, <b>or</b> in <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case that <b>one may go down and gather</b> the produce? <b>Mar, son of Rabbana, taught this</b> mishna according to the following <b>lenient</b> version: In <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case <b>one may go down and gather</b> the produce, <b>provided that he does not gather</b> it <b>with</b> his own <b>hand.</b>

### Part 2
§ With regard to the prohibition of <i>orla</i> outside of Eretz Yisrael, the Gemara relates that <b>Levi said to Shmuel: Aryokh,</b> Shmuel’s nickname, <b>supply me</b> with such food, as I will not pick it on my own, <b>and</b> if you do so <b>I will eat</b> it. There is no reason for concern with regard to <i>orla</i> outside of Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rav Avya and Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan would supply</b> produce whose <i>orla</i> status was uncertain <b>for each other,</b> as it is forbidden only if one takes the <i>orla</i> on his own. <b>The sharp</b> Sages <b>of Pumbedita said:</b> The prohibition of <b><i>orla</i> does not</b> apply at all <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yehuda sent</b> a question <b>to Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> concerning the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <i>orla</i> outside of Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan sent him</b> the following response: <b>Conceal,</b> i.e., do not publicize, the <i>halakha</i> that produce whose <i>orla</i> status is <b>uncertain</b> is permitted; <b>and destroy,</b> i.e., prohibit entirely, produce whose <i>orla</i> status is <b>certain; and with regard to</b> the <b>produce of</b> those who are lenient in this <i>halakha</i>, <b>declare that it requires interment,</b> as it is prohibited to derive benefit from such produce. <b>And whoever says</b> that there is <b>no</b> prohibition of <b><i>orla</i> outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>will have neither a child nor a grandchild “who shall cast the line by lot in the congregation of the Lord”</b> (Micah 2:5).

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>And in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do</b> the sharp Sages of Pumbedita <b>hold</b> when they state this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: They hold <b>in accordance with that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, says in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Durmaska, who said in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, who said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer the Great:</b> The prohibition of <b><i>orla</i></b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.

### Part 5
The Gemara expresses surprise at this ruling: <b>But</b> does it <b>not</b> apply? Does Rabbi Eliezer maintain that the prohibition of <i>orla</i> does not apply outside of Eretz Yisrael? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Even</b> the <b>new crop,</b> which indicates that he agrees that <i>orla</i> and diverse kinds are forbidden outside of Eretz Yisrael? The Gemara answers that one should not <b>teach</b> that Rabbi Eliezer said: Even the new crop, but rather teach only the words: The <b>new crop,</b> i.e., Rabbi Eliezer maintains that only this prohibition applies outside of Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: <i>Orla</i></b> is forbidden <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael by <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai. Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Asi: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to produce whose status concerning <b><i>orla</i></b> is <b>uncertain, in Eretz</b> Yisrael it is <b>forbidden, in Syria</b> it is <b>permitted,</b> and <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>one goes down and gathers</b> it? And if <i>orla</i> is forbidden outside of Eretz Yisrael by a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, why is produce whose status concerning <i>orla</i> is uncertain permitted in Syria? Rabbi Zeira <b>“was dismayed for a while”</b> (Daniel 4:16), and then Rabbi Asi <b>said to him: Say</b> that <b>it is stated like this,</b> i.e., explain that the <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai was that outside of Eretz Yisrael produce whose status concerning <i>orla</i> is <b>uncertain</b> is <b>permitted, and</b> produce whose status concerning <i>orla</i> is <b>certain</b> is <b>forbidden.</b>

### Part 7
§ <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Offenders <b>are flogged for</b> transgressing the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>by Torah law. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said to him: But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (<i>Orla</i> 3:9) that the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law</b> outside of Eretz Yisrael? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.</b> The mishna <b>here</b> is referring <b>to diverse kinds in a vineyard,</b> which is prohibited outside of Eretz Yisrael by rabbinic law, whereas <b>there,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is referring <b>to</b> the <b>grafting of a tree</b> onto a different species.

### Part 8
The Gemara adds that this <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel. As Shmuel says:</b> The verse states: <b>“You shall keep My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 19:19), which means that one must keep even the <b>statutes that I have already instituted for you</b> when you were merely descendants of Noah, before the giving of the Torah. Shmuel elaborates: This is referring to the prohibitions stated in that same verse: <b>“You shall not let your cattle gender with a diverse kind; you shall not sow your field</b> with two kinds of seed” (Leviticus 19:19).

### Part 9
Additionally, the juxtaposition of these prohibitions teaches that <b>just as</b> the prohibition of diverse kinds stated with regard to <b>your animal</b> applies only <b>to mating</b> one species with another, <b>so too,</b> the prohibition of diverse kinds with regard to <b>your field</b> is referring only <b>to grafting</b> one type of tree to another type, and it does not apply to planting two species together. Furthermore, <b>just as</b> the prohibition of diverse kinds with regard to <b>your animal applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, as this prohibition does not relate to the land, <b>so too,</b> the prohibition against grafting <b>your field applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “Your field,”</b> which indicates that the field belongs to you in your portion of Eretz Yisrael? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse serves <b>to exclude</b> the prohibition of diverse kinds of <b>seeds,</b> which does not apply <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. Planting different types of seeds together is prohibited only in Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 11
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ḥanan and Rav Anan were</b> once <b>going</b> together <b>on a road</b> outside of Eretz Yisrael and <b>they saw a certain man planting seeds</b> of diverse kinds <b>together.</b> One of them <b>said to</b> the other: <b>Let the Master come</b> and <b>ostracize him,</b> as he is performing a prohibited act. The other <b>said to him:</b> These <i>halakhot</i> <b>are not understood by you.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And furthermore, they</b> also <b>saw a certain man who was planting wheat and barley between grapevines.</b> One of them <b>said to</b> the other: <b>Let the Master come</b> and <b>ostracize him. He</b> again <b>said to him:</b> These <i>halakhot</i> are <b>not clear to you.</b> He explained: <b>Don’t we hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya, who says:</b> One who sows diverse kinds is not liable by Torah law <b>until he sows wheat, and barley, and</b> a grape <b>seed with a single hand motion,</b> i.e., by sowing in the vineyard he violates the prohibition of diverse kinds that applies to seeds and to the vineyard simultaneously. Since this man was not planting in that manner, he should not be ostracized.

### Part 13
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yosef</b> was <b>mixing</b> diverse <b>seeds and planting</b> them. <b>Abaye said to him: But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that mixing <b>diverse kinds</b> is prohibited outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>by rabbinic law?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>here,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to diverse kinds in a vineyard,</b> and <b>there,</b> I am planting legally because I am planting only <b>diverse kinds of seeds.</b> The reason for the difference between these two cases is as follows: With regard to planting <b>diverse kinds in a vineyard, which in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>is prohibited</b> even <b>with regard to</b> deriving <b>benefit, the Sages issued a decree</b> prohibiting this mixture <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael as well. Conversely, with regard to planting <b>diverse kinds of seeds, which in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>is not prohibited with regard to</b> deriving <b>benefit, the Sages did not issue a decree</b> prohibiting <b>them outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.

### Part 14
<b>Rav Yosef then said: The matter that I said,</b> i.e., that diverse kinds of seeds are entirely permitted outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>is not</b> so. The proof is that <b>Rav planted the garden</b> around <b>the study hall in rows [<i>mesharei</i>]</b> of different species. <b>What is the reason</b> that he did that rather than plant different species together? Is it <b>not because</b> he was concerned about <b>mixtures of diverse kinds? Abaye said to him:</b> That is not proof. <b>Granted, if he taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> through his actions,
