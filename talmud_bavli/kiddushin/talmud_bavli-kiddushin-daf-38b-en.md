### Part 1
<b>Any mitzva that the Jewish people were commanded</b> to perform <b>before entering Eretz</b> Yisrael, i.e., it was not linked to entry into the land, <b>applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael. Conversely, any mitzva that they were commanded to perform <b>after they entered Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>applies only in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>except for</b> the <b>abrogation of monetary</b> debts in the Sabbatical Year (see Deuteronomy 15:1–2), <b>and</b> the <b>emancipation of slaves</b> in the Jubilee Year (see Leviticus 25:39–41). <b>Even though</b> the Jews <b>were commanded with regard to these</b> mitzvot that they were to perform them only <b>after their entry into Eretz</b> Yisrael, these mitzvot <b>apply both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.

### Part 2
The Gemara questions the need for this ruling: <b>The abrogation of monetary</b> debts <b>is an obligation of the body.</b> Since this mitzva is not referring to the land, what is the novelty of the ruling that it applies even outside of Eretz Yisrael?

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: <b>It is necessary</b> to mention the cancellation of debts <b>only for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The verse states in the context of the cancellation of debts: <b>“And this is the manner of the abrogation: He shall abrogate”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:2). <b>The verse speaks of two</b> types of <b>abrogation: One</b> is <b>the release of land and one</b> is the <b>abrogation of monetary</b> debts. Since the two are juxtaposed, one can learn the following: <b>At a time when you release land,</b> when the Jubilee Year is practiced, <b>you abrogate monetary</b> debts; <b>at a time when you do not release land,</b> such as the present time, when the Jubilee Year is no longer practiced, <b>you</b> also <b>do not abrogate monetary</b> debts.

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that one can learn the following from this juxtaposition: <b>In a place</b> where <b>you release land,</b> i.e., in Eretz Yisrael, <b>you abrogate monetary</b> debts, <b>and in a place</b> where <b>you do not release land, you do not abrogate monetary</b> debts. If so, the abrogation of debts would apply only in Eretz Yisrael, despite the fact that this obligation is not related to the land. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Because the Lord’s abrogation has been proclaimed”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:2), to indicate that this obligation applies <b>in any case,</b> even outside of Eretz Yisrael. This is the novelty of the statement of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon.

### Part 5
The Gemara questions the need for second ruling of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: <b>The emancipation of slaves is</b> also <b>an obligation of the body,</b> not one that applies to the land. What is novel about this ruling? The Gemara answers that <b>it might enter your mind to say: Since it is written: “And proclaim liberty throughout the land</b> unto all the inhabitants thereof” (Leviticus 25:10), one could say: <b>“Throughout the land,” yes,</b> this mitzva applies, but <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>no,</b> the emancipation does not take effect. Therefore <b>the</b> same <b>verse</b> also <b>states</b> the seemingly superfluous phrase: <b>“It shall be a Jubilee”</b> (Leviticus 25:10), to indicate that it applies <b>in any case,</b> in all places.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Throughout the land”?</b> The Gemara answers that this phrase teaches: <b>When the liberty</b> of slaves <b>applies in Eretz</b> Yisrael, it also <b>applies outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, and when <b>the liberty</b> of slaves <b>does not apply in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>it does not apply outside</b> of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael. The mitzva depends on whether the Jubilee Year is in effect, not on the place in question.

### Part 7
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Orla</i> 3:9): <b>The new crop is forbidden by Torah law everywhere; <i>orla</i></b> is forbidden outside of Eretz Yisrael according to <b>a <i>halakha</i>,</b> as the Gemara will immediately explain; <b>and diverse kinds</b> are forbidden outside the land <b>by rabbinic law.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> mentioned with regard to <i>orla</i>? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> It is the <b>local <i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., this was the practice of Jews in places where they settled. <b>Ulla</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Ulla said to Rav Yehuda: Granted, according to my</b> opinion, <b>as I say</b> in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan that the mishna means that this is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai, this is</b> the reason <b>why we distinguish between</b> fruit whose status as <b><i>orla</i></b> is <b>uncertain,</b> which is forbidden outside of Eretz Yisrael according to the <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <b>and</b> produce whose status as <b>diverse kinds</b> is <b>uncertain,</b> which is permitted outside of Eretz Yisrael, as the prohibition of diverse kinds applies outside of Eretz Yisrael only by rabbinic law.

### Part 9
This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 3:9): Fruit whose status as <b><i>orla</i></b> is <b>uncertain is forbidden in Eretz</b> Yisrael, and <b>it is permitted in Syria</b> with no concern about its uncertain status. <b>Outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, a Jew may <b>go down</b> into the gentile’s field <b>and purchase</b> fruit that is <i>orla</i> from the gentile, <b>provided that</b> the Jew <b>does not see him gather</b> it.

### Part 10
<b>Nevertheless, we learned</b> in a mishna <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>diverse kinds</b> (<i>Orla</i> 3:9): If <b>a vineyard has vegetables planted in it, and</b> there are <b>vegetables being sold outside</b> the vineyard, but there is no proof that these vegetables came from the vineyard, <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael they are <b>forbidden.</b> The reason is that as it is possible that the vegetables came from the vineyard, the <i>halakha</i> is stringent in a case involving a prohibition by Torah law. <b>In Syria</b> these vegetables are <b>permitted.</b>

### Part 11
<b>Outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, if the gentile owner of a field containing diverse kinds <b>goes down</b> into his field <b>and gathers</b> produce, then, <b>provided that</b> the Jew <b>does not gather</b> it <b>by hand,</b> he may purchase the produce from the gentile. This indicates that outside of Eretz Yisrael there is a difference between <i>orla</i> of uncertain status and diverse kinds of uncertain status. This is understandable if <i>orla</i> is forbidden by a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, while diverse kinds are forbidden by rabbinic law.

### Part 12
<b>But according to your</b> opinion, that neither <i>orla</i> nor diverse kinds is forbidden by Torah law,
