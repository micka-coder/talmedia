### Part 1
<b>And</b> the donning of <b>phylacteries</b> (Deuteronomy 6:8), which are not worn at night or on Shabbat and Festivals, is also a positive, time-bound mitzva.

### Part 2
<b>And what is a positive mitzva that is not time bound?</b> Examples include the affixing of <b>a <i>mezuza</i></b> (Deuteronomy 11:20), the construction of <b>a parapet</b> on a roof (Deuteronomy 22:8), returning <b>a lost item</b> (Deuteronomy 22:1–3), <b>and the release</b> of the mother bird from <b>the nest,</b> i.e., the mitzva of sending away a mother bird when one finds it sitting on chicks or eggs (Deuteronomy 22:6–7).

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>But is</b> this an established <b>principle?</b> But <b>there are</b> the mitzvot of eating <b><i>matza</i></b> on the first night of Passover (Exodus 23:15), of <b>rejoicing</b> on a Festival (Deuteronomy 16:9–11), and <b>assembly</b> on <i>Sukkot</i> following the Sabbatical Year (Deuteronomy 31:10–13). <b>And</b> each of these is <b>a positive, time-bound mitzva, and</b> yet <b>women are obligated</b> in them. <b>And furthermore,</b> one can raise a difficulty as follows: <b>But there are</b> the mitzvot of <b>Torah study</b> (Deuteronomy 6:7), <b>procreation</b> (Genesis 1:28), <b>and redemption of the firstborn</b> (Exodus 13:12–13), each of which <b>is not a positive, time-bound mitzva, and</b> yet <b>women are exempt</b> from them.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One does not learn</b> practical <i>halakhot</i> <b>from general statements,</b> i.e., when a general statement appears in a mishna and uses the term: All, it is not to be understood as an all-inclusive statement without exceptions. This is the case <b>even in a place where it says: Except,</b> to exclude a specific matter.

### Part 5
A proof for this is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eiruvin</i> 26b): <b>One can establish a joining</b> of houses in courtyards [<i>eiruv ḥatzerot</i>] and a joining of Shabbat boundaries [<i>eiruv teḥumin</i>], <b>and</b> similarly, <b>one can merge</b> courtyards to permit carrying in a joint alleyway on Shabbat. This can be done <b>with all</b> types of food <b>except for water and salt.</b> This is stated as a <i>halakha</i> with specific exceptions, <b>and</b> yet one can ask: <b>Is there nothing else</b> that cannot be used for an <i>eiruv</i>? <b>But there are truffles and mushrooms,</b> which also cannot be used for an <i>eiruv</i>, because they do not offer nourishment. <b>Rather, conclude from this</b> that <b>one may not learn from general statements, even in a place where it says: Except.</b>

### Part 6
§ The Gemara turns to the sources of this principle. <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>women are exempt from positive, time-bound mitzvot?</b> It is <b>derived</b> by juxtaposition <b>from</b> the mitzva of <b>phylacteries: Just as women are exempt from</b> donning <b>phylacteries, so too, women are exempt from all positive, time-bound mitzvot. And</b> the exemption of women from donning <b>phylacteries is derived from</b> their exemption from <b>Torah study: Just as women are exempt from Torah study,</b> as derived from Deuteronomy 11:19, <b>so too women are exempt from</b> donning <b>phylacteries,</b> as the two issues are juxtaposed in the Torah (Deuteronomy 6:7–8).

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And let us</b> say the opposite <b>and juxtapose phylacteries to <i>mezuza</i>,</b> which is also mentioned in that passage. <i>Mezuza</i> is a mitzva in which women are also obligated. Based on this comparison, women would be obligated in phylacteries as well. The Gemara answers: <b>Phylacteries are juxtaposed to Torah study</b> in <b>both the first paragraph and in the second paragraph</b> of <i>Shema</i>, whereas <b>phylacteries are not juxtaposed to <i>mezuza</i> in the second paragraph.</b> It is therefore preferable to compare phylacteries to Torah study.

### Part 8
The Gemara says: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let us juxtapose <i>mezuza</i> to Torah study</b> and say that women are also exempt from the obligation of a <i>mezuza</i>. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: This <b>could not enter your mind, as it is written</b> with regard to the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>: <b>“That your days may be multiplied”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21). Can it be said that <b>men need life</b> but <b>women do not need life?</b> Since the reward for the performance of the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i> is extended life, this mitzva applies to women as well.

### Part 9
The Gemara further asks: <b>But there is</b> the mitzva of residing in <b>a <i>sukka</i>, which is a positive, time-bound mitzva, as it is written: “In <i>sukkot</i> you shall reside seven days”</b> (Leviticus 23:42), referring to seven specific days of the year. Nevertheless, <b>the reason</b> women are exempt from this mitzva is <b>that the Merciful One writes</b> in the continuation of the verse: “All <b>the homeborn</b> in Israel shall reside in <i>sukkot</i>.” The definite article “the” is an exclusion, and serves <b>to exclude the women</b> from the obligation to reside in a <i>sukka</i>. It may be derived from here that <b>if that was not so, women</b> would be <b>obligated.</b> This indicates that women do not receive a blanket exemption from every positive, time-bound mitzva.

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said:</b> In the case of residing in a <i>sukka</i> a special verse <b>was necessary</b> to exempt women, as otherwise <b>it might enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written:</b> “In <i>sukkot</i> you shall reside,” this means that you should <b>reside as you dwell</b> in your permanent home: <b>Just as a man and his wife</b> live together in <b>a residence, so too, a man and his wife</b> are obligated to reside together in a <b><i>sukka</i>.</b>
