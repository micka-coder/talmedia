<b>does not render herself acquired</b> by a man.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>The number in the latter clause</b> of the mishna, that a woman acquires herself in two ways, serves <b>to exclude what?</b> The Gemara answers that it serves <b>to exclude <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> i.e., a woman is not released from marriage through <i>ḥalitza</i>. Without this exclusion it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that this <b>can be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a <i>yevama</i>,</b> as follows: <b>Just as a <i>yevama</i>, who is not released</b> from the <i>yavam</i> <b>through a bill of divorce, is</b> nevertheless <b>released</b> from him <b>through <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> with regard to <b>this</b> married woman, <b>who can be released</b> from her husband <b>through a bill of divorce, is it not logical that she can be released</b> from him <b>through <i>ḥalitza</i>?</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that a married woman cannot be released from her husband by means of <i>ḥalitza</i>.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> perhaps one should <b>say</b> that <b>so too,</b> this is the case, i.e., a married woman can be released from marriage through <i>ḥalitza</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to divorce: <b>“A scroll of severance”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:3), which teaches: <b>A scroll,</b> i.e., a written document, <b>severs her</b> from her husband, <b>and nothing else severs her</b> from him.

### Part 4
§ The mishna teaches that a woman can be acquired <b>with money.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that a woman can be acquired through money? <b>And furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 46b): <b>A father has authority</b> over <b>his daughter with regard to her betrothal,</b> whether it is <b>through money, through a document, or through sexual intercourse, from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> she <b>is acquired</b> by her husband <b>with money, and</b> that this <b>money is her father’s?</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The reason is <b>that the verse states</b> with regard to a Hebrew maidservant acquiring freedom from her master: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing, without money”</b> (Exodus 21:11). The extraneous phrase: Without money, indicates that <b>there is no money for this master,</b> i.e., in this case the master she leaves loses the money he paid for her, <b>but there is money for a different master,</b> i.e., another master receives money for her when she leaves his authority. <b>And who is</b> the other master who can transfer her to someone else and receives money for her? This is her <b>father.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that this money is given <b>to her?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>How can</b> one suggest <b>this? Her father receives her betrothal,</b> i.e., the money or document of betrothal, when he marries her off to her husband, <b>as it is written: “I gave my daughter to this man”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:16), <b>and</b> shall <b>she take the money?</b> Since he is the one who marries her off, he is certainly entitled to the money of her betrothal.

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>applies</b> only when she is <b>a minor girl, as she does not have the power to receive</b> her <b>betrothal.</b> Since she lacks the intellectual capacity, she likewise does not have the legal right to conduct this transaction. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a young woman, who does have the power to receive</b> her <b>betrothal,</b> as a female older than twelve years is considered an adult, <b>let her betroth herself and take the money.</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states: “Being in her youth, in her father’s house”</b> (Numbers 30:17), which teaches: <b>Any profit</b> she gains in her <b>youth</b> belongs <b>to her father.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the earnings of a daughter,</b> i.e., the profit from her labor, belongs <b>to</b> her <b>father? As it is stated: “And if a man sells his daughter as a maidservant”</b> (Exodus 21:7). This comparison between a daughter and a Hebrew maidservant teaches the following: <b>Just as</b> with regard to a Hebrew <b>maidservant, her earnings</b> belong <b>to her master, so too,</b> with regard to <b>a daughter, her earnings</b> belong <b>to her father.</b> The Gemara now asks: Why does Rav Huna need this derivation? <b>Let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the verse <b>“being in her youth, in her father’s house,”</b> which indicates that any profit from her earnings as a young woman belongs to her father.

### Part 9
<b>Rather,</b> Rav Huna maintains that <b>that</b> verse <b>is written with regard to the nullification of vows,</b> and it is not referring to the <i>halakhot</i> of acquisition. The Gemara asks: If that is so, then <b>so too,</b> with regard to her betrothal money, one can say that this verse <b>is written</b> only <b>with regard to the nullification of vows</b> and does not apply to betrothal money. <b>And if you would say: Let us derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of her betrothal money <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the nullification of vows, i.e., just as a father has the right to nullify his daughter’s vows when she is a young woman, so too, he has rights to her money, this is not possible, as there is a principle: <b>We do not derive monetary matters from ritual matters.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And if you would say: Let us derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> of the betrothal of a young woman <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>fines,</b> as it is stated explicitly in the Torah that a man who rapes a young woman must pay a fine to her father, there is another principle that is applicable here: <b>We do not derive monetary matters from fines,</b> as the imposition of a fine is considered a unique case from which ordinary monetary rights cannot be derived.

### Part 11
<b>And if you would say: Let us derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the reimbursements for the <b>humiliation and degradation</b> of a young woman who was raped, which are also given to the father, one can answer that the following distinction applies: Reimbursement for <b>humiliation and degradation</b> are <b>different, as her father has an interest in them.</b> The father has the ability to derive benefit from her humiliation and degradation in other ways, e.g., by marrying her to a man afflicted with boils. which would humiliate her and cause a reduction in her value. Therefore, one cannot derive from the fact that the father receives the reimbursements for the humiliation and degradation of a young woman who was raped that he receives other monies due to her.

### Part 12
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a young woman’s betrothal money belongs to her father is derived from the verse: “Then shall she go out for nothing, without money” (Exodus 21:11), as previously stated. As for the question why the money does not belong to her, the Gemara answers that <b>it is reasonable that when</b> the verse <b>excludes</b> another situation and indicates that there is no money for this master but there is money for a different master,
