<b>of dying animals</b> that were <b>slaughtered, and let them not eat the meat of dying animals</b> that were not slaughtered but which will become <b>carcasses.</b> In other words, it is preferable for this act to be performed in a somewhat permitted way rather than in a manner that is entirely prohibited. The expression: <b>“And you have a desire</b> for her and would take her to you as a wife” (Deuteronomy 21:11), teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even if she is not pretty,</b> as this is a subjective judgment dependent on one’s desire. The term <b>“for her”</b> indicates that he may take her, <b>but not her and another</b> woman. A soldier is allowed to take only one captive in this manner.

### Part 2
The phrase <b>“and would take her”</b> teaches: <b>You have</b> the ability to <b>take her,</b> i.e., to marry her. <b>“To you as a wife”</b> teaches <b>that he may not take two women, one for him and one for his father,</b> or <b>one for him and one for his son.</b> The verse: <b>“Then you shall bring her</b> home into your house” (Deuteronomy 21:12), <b>teaches that he should not pressure her</b> to engage in sexual intercourse <b>during the war,</b> but he should first take her into his home.

### Part 3
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> It is stated with regard to a pierced slave: <b>“But if</b> the slave <b>shall say [<i>amor yomar</i>]:</b> I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go out free” (Exodus 21:5). The repeated verb teaches that he is not pierced <b>unless he says</b> this statement <b>and repeats</b> it. If <b>he said at the beginning</b> of his <b>six</b> years of service that he wants to be pierced, <b>but he did not say</b> it <b>at the end of six</b> years, <b>he is not pierced, as it is stated: “I will not go out free,”</b> i.e., he is not pierced <b>unless he says</b> it <b>when he leaves.</b>

### Part 4
If <b>he said</b> this statement <b>at the end of six</b> years <b>but did not say</b> it <b>at the beginning of</b> his <b>six</b> years, he is likewise <b>not pierced, as it is stated: “If the slave shall say [<i>amor yomar</i>],”</b> which indicates that he is not pierced <b>unless he states</b> it <b>while he is</b> still <b>a slave.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.

### Part 5
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said</b> above: If <b>he said</b> it <b>at the beginning of</b> his <b>six</b> years <b>and he did not say</b> it <b>at the end of six</b> years, <b>he is not pierced, as it is stated: “I will not go out free.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> learn this <i>halakha</i> <b>specifically from</b> the phrase <b>“I will not go out free”? Let him derive</b> it from the fact <b>that we require</b> another condition. He has to be able to say: <b>“I love my master, my wife, and my children”</b> (Exodus 21:5) in order to become a pierced slave, <b>and</b> he <b>cannot</b> say this, as at the start of the six years he does not yet have children from the Canaanite maidservant his master provided for him.

### Part 6
<b>And furthermore,</b> the <i>baraita</i> states that if <b>he said</b> this statement <b>at the end of six</b> years <b>but did not say</b> it <b>at the beginning of</b> his <b>six</b> years, he is likewise <b>not pierced, as it is stated “the slave.” Is that to say</b> that <b>he is not a slave at the end of six</b> years? <b>Rava said: What</b> is the meaning of: <b>At the beginning of six?</b> This is not referring to the actual beginning of his six years of service, but <b>to the beginning of</b> the <b>last <i>peruta</i>,</b> i.e., when he reaches the start of his final stage of work worth one <i>peruta</i>, when he is still a slave. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>At the end of six? At the end of</b> the <b>last <i>peruta</i>.</b>

### Part 7
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If the slave <b>has a wife and children and his master does not have a wife and children, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “Because he loves you and your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16). The word “house” is referring to a wife and children, and therefore if the master does not have a wife and children the verse cannot be fulfilled, and the slave is not pierced. Similarly, if <b>his master has a wife and children and he does not have a wife and children, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “I love my master, my wife, and my children”</b> (Exodus 21:5).

### Part 8
Furthermore, if <b>he loves his master but his master does not love him, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “Because he fares well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16), which indicates that it is good for both of them to be with each other. If <b>his master loves him but he does not love his master, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “Because he loves you.”</b> If <b>he is ill and his master is not ill, he is not pierced, as it is stated: “Because he fares well with you,”</b> which excludes a sick person. Similarly, if <b>his master is ill and he is not ill, he is not pierced, as it is stated “with you,”</b> which equates the well-being of the pair.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye raised a dilemma:</b> If <b>both of them are ill, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we require</b> only that the slave be <b>“with you,”</b> i.e., in the same condition as the master, <b>and that is</b> the case <b>here,</b> as they are both ill, and the slave can be pierced? <b>Or perhaps we require “because he fares well with you,”</b> i.e., it must be good for both of them, <b>and that is not</b> the case <b>here,</b> as they are both ill. If so, he cannot be pierced. No answer was found, and therefore the Gemara says that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 10
<b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states concerning a Hebrew slave: <b>“Because he fares well with you,”</b> which teaches that the slave should be <b>with you,</b> i.e., treated as your equal, <b>in food,</b> meaning that his food must be of the same quality as yours, and <b>with you in drink.</b> This means <b>that there shall not</b> be a situation in <b>which you eat fine bread and he eats inferior bread,</b> bread from coarse flour mixed with bran, which is low quality. There shall not be a situation in which <b>you drink aged wine and he drinks</b> inferior <b>new wine.</b> There shall not be a situation in which <b>you sleep</b> comfortably <b>on</b> bedding made from <b>soft sheets and he sleeps on straw. From here</b> the Sages <b>stated: Anyone who acquires a Hebrew slave</b> is considered <b>like one who acquires a master for himself,</b> because he must be careful that the slave’s living conditions are equal to his own.

### Part 11
<b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to a verse that deals with the emancipation of a slave: <b>“Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him”</b> (Leviticus 25:41). <b>Rabbi Shimon said:</b> This verse is puzzling, as, <b>if he is sold, are his sons and daughters sold?</b> Rather, <b>from here</b> it is derived that <b>his master is obligated to</b> provide <b>sustenance for his children,</b> and when the slave is emancipated his sons are released as well. <b>You say something similar</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“If he is married then his wife shall go out with him”</b> (Exodus 21:3). <b>Rabbi Shimon said: If he is sold, is his wife sold?</b> Rather, <b>from here</b> it is derived <b>that his master is obligated to</b> provide <b>sustenance for his wife.</b>

### Part 12
The Gemara comments: <b>And it is necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to mention both cases, <b>as if it</b> had <b>taught us</b> only that the master is required to provide sustenance for the slave’s <b>children,</b> one might say that this is <b>because they are not fit to work and eat.</b> Since they are unable to support themselves, the master is required to support them. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>his wife, who can eat and work,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>she should work and eat</b> in payment for her work, and the master is not required to support her for free.

### Part 13
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if</b> the <i>baraita</i> had <b>taught us</b> only about <b>his wife,</b> one might say that the master is required to support her <b>since it is not her manner to circulate</b> and collect charity, as she is too embarrassed to do this. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>his children, since it is their manner to circulate</b> and beg, i.e., this is not beneath their dignity, one might <b>say no,</b> he is not required to support them. Therefore it is <b>necessary</b> to issue both rulings.

### Part 14
