### Part 1
Therefore the superfluous phrase: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing,</b> without money” (Exodus 21:11), <b>teaches us</b> that even an <i>ailonit</i> can be sold as a Hebrew maidservant and is released upon reaching adulthood.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi, who said: But is it not an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that adulthood releases a woman from her master’s authority, how does he respond to the fact that <b>we say</b> in general, with regard to <b>a matter that can be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, the <b>verse</b> nevertheless <b>takes the trouble and writes it</b> explicitly? The Gemara answers: <b>That matter</b> applies only where there <b>is no</b> other way <b>to resolve</b> the difficulty of why a <i>halakha</i> is written when it could be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference. <b>But when there is</b> another, more substantial way <b>to resolve</b> the difficulty, <b>one resolves</b> it in that manner.

### Part 3
§ The Gemara notes: <b>And a <i>tanna</i> cites</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a woman can be betrothed with money <b>from here,</b> a different source. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when the verse states: <b>“When a man takes a woman and engages in sexual intercourse with her, and it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found</b> some unseemly matter <b>in her,</b> and he writes her a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1), in this verse, the term <b>taking is only with money. And so it says: “I will give money for the field; take it from me”</b> (Genesis 23:13).

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is there any need for this derivation? Could this <b>not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference,</b> as follows: <b>And if</b> a Hebrew <b>maidservant, who cannot be acquired</b> as a maidservant <b>through intercourse,</b> nevertheless <b>can be acquired through money, is it not logical that this</b> woman, <b>who can be acquired through intercourse</b> for the purpose of betrothal, <b>can</b> likewise <b>be acquired through money?</b>

### Part 5
Nevertheless, this <i>a fortiori</i> inference can be refuted. <b>A <i>yevama</i> proves</b> otherwise, <b>as she is acquired</b> by the <i>yavam</i> <b>through intercourse, and</b> yet <b>she cannot be acquired through money.</b> The Gemara rejects this refutation: <b>What</b> is unique about <b>a <i>yevama</i></b> is <b>that</b> she <b>cannot be acquired through a document. Will you say</b> that the same applies <b>to this</b> woman, <b>who can be acquired through a document</b> for the purpose of betrothal, and consequently the acquisition of money applies to her as well?

### Part 6
The Gemara reiterates its question. <b>The verse states: “When a man takes</b> a woman.” <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> for <b>this</b> purpose? <b>It was</b> already <b>derived</b> through this <i>a fortiori</i> inference, as the proposed refutation of this inference was rejected. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is needed <b>because one can say that</b> the <b>refutation of the</b> <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference</b> is present <b>from the outset,</b> i.e., there is a difficulty with the comparison between a woman and a Hebrew maidservant.

### Part 7
Rav Ashi elaborates: <b>From where do you derive</b> that a woman can be betrothed with money? It is derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>from</b> the case of <b>a Hebrew maidservant.</b> This derivation can be refuted. <b>What</b> is unique <b>about a Hebrew maidservant is that</b> she can be <b>released with money,</b> i.e., she pays her master her value as a maidservant and she is then freed, and therefore she can likewise be acquired through money. <b>Will you say</b> the same with regard to <b>this</b> woman, <b>who cannot be released,</b> i.e., divorced, <b>through money?</b> Since this <i>a fortiori</i> inference is rejected, one must rely on the source cited in the <i>baraita</i>, that <b>the verse states: “When a man takes.”</b>

### Part 8
After mentioning an additional proof for the option of betrothal with money, the Gemara comments: <b>And it was necessary</b> for the Torah <b>to write,</b> with regard to a Hebrew maidservant: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing,” and it was</b> also <b>necessary to write: “When a man takes</b> a woman.” <b>As, if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“When he takes,” I would say:</b> The <b>betrothal money that the husband gives her is</b> invariably <b>hers.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “Then shall she go out for nothing,”</b> to teach that when she is not an adult her father has the right to her betrothal money.

### Part 9
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>had the Merciful One written</b> only: <b>“Then shall she go out for nothing,” I would say</b> that in a case <b>where she gave him</b> money <b>and betrothed him, it is</b> a valid <b>betrothal,</b> as this verse does not specify who gives the money to whom. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “When he takes,” and not: When she takes,</b> to teach that only a man may betroth a woman, not vice versa.

### Part 10
The <i>baraita</i> continues to interpret the verse. The phrase: <b>“And engages in sexual intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:1), <b>teaches that</b> a woman <b>can be acquired through intercourse.</b> Why is it necessary for the verse to state this explicitly? Could this <b>not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference: And if a <i>yevama</i>, who cannot be acquired through money, can be acquired through intercourse, is it not logical that this</b> woman, <b>who can be acquired through money,</b> as derived above, <b>can</b> also <b>be acquired through intercourse?</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara counters: The case of <b>a Hebrew maidservant proves</b> otherwise, <b>as she is acquired through money and</b> yet she <b>cannot be acquired through intercourse.</b> The Gemara dismisses this refutation: <b>What</b> is distinct about <b>a Hebrew maidservant</b> is <b>that her acquisition is not for the sake of marriage,</b> as she is acquired as a servant. <b>Will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to this</b> woman, <b>whose acquisition is for the sake of marriage?</b> Therefore, it is logical that a woman can be acquired through sexual intercourse.

### Part 12
The Gemara reiterates its question. <b>The verse states: “And engages in sexual intercourse with her.” But why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> for this purpose? <b>It was</b> already <b>derived</b> through the above <i>a fortiori</i> inference. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is needed <b>because it</b> is possible <b>to say that</b> the <b>refutation of the</b> <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference</b> is present <b>from the outset. From where do you derive</b> that intercourse is a mode of acquisition? <b>From</b> the case of <b>a <i>yevama</i>.</b>

### Part 13
One could say: <b>What</b> is unique about <b>a <i>yevama</i></b> is that she <b>is bound</b> to the <i>yavam</i> <b>and stands</b> waiting for him to act, and for this reason sexual intercourse is sufficient to render her his wife. <b>Will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to this</b> woman, <b>who is not bound and</b> is not <b>standing</b> waiting for anyone? It is therefore possible that intercourse is not enough to acquire a woman in ordinary circumstances. Consequently, the <i>a fortiori</i> inference does not bear close scrutiny. For this reason an additional proof is required, that <b>the verse states: “And engages in sexual intercourse with her.”</b>
