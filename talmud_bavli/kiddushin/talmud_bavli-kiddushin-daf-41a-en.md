### Part 1
<b>has managed</b> to acquire <b>only anger [<i>ragzanuta</i>],</b> i.e., nothing beneficial comes through anger; in the end he is left with nothing but the anger itself. <b>And a good person is given the fruit of his actions to taste. And</b> with regard to <b>any</b> person <b>who does not engage in</b> the study of <b>Bible, nor</b> the study of <b>Mishna, nor</b> the <b>desired mode of behavior,</b> one should <b>vow to not</b> derive <b>benefit from him,</b> and one should have no contact with him, <b>as it is stated: “Nor sat in the seat of the scornful”</b> (Psalms 1:1). The <b>seat</b> of this person is certainly the <b>seat of the scornful,</b> as he is engaged in nothing but idle matters.
