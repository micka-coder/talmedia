### Part 1
<b>a person should view himself as though he were</b> exactly <b>half-liable and half-meritorious.</b> In other words he should act as though the plates of his scale are balanced, so that if <b>he performs one mitzva he is fortunate, as he tilts his</b> balance <b>to the scale of merit.</b> If <b>he transgresses one prohibition, woe to him, as he tilts his</b> balance <b>to the scale of liability, as it is stated: “But one sin destroys much good”</b> (Ecclesiastes 9:18), which means that <b>due to one sin that</b> a person <b>transgresses he squanders much good.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: Since the world is judged by its majority,</b> i.e., depending on whether people have performed a majority of mitzvot or a majority of sins, <b>and an individual is</b> likewise <b>judged by his majority,</b> each person must consider that if <b>he performs one mitzva he is praiseworthy, as he tilts</b> the balance of <b>himself and the entire world to the scale of merit.</b> Conversely, if <b>he transgresses one prohibition, woe to him, as he tilts</b> the balance <b>for himself and the entire world to the scale of liability, as it is stated: “But one sin</b> destroys much good,” i.e., <b>due to one sin that this</b> individual <b>commits, he squanders much goodness from himself and from the entire world.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Even</b> if one was <b>completely righteous all his life and he rebelled</b> by sinning <b>at the end</b> of his life, <b>he loses</b> his <b>early</b> merit, <b>as it is stated: “The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him on the day of his transgression”</b> (Ezekiel 33:12). <b>And</b> similarly, <b>even</b> if one was <b>completely wicked all his life and repented in the end, he is no longer reminded of his wickedness, as it is stated</b> in the continuation of the verse: <b>“And as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not stumble over it on the day that he turns from his wickedness.”</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> an individual who performed mitzvot all of his life and then sins <b>should</b> at least <b>be like</b> one whose acts have been <b>half sins and half merits,</b> i.e., each should be of equal weight. Why, then, is he pronounced guilty? <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> This is not referring to an individual who has merely sinned but <b>to</b> one who <b>regrets all</b> the <b>initial</b> mitzvot he performed in the past. In this case the mitzvot he performed are not taken into account.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Anyone who is engaged in</b> the study of <b>Bible, and in</b> the study of <b>Mishna, and in</b> the <b>desired mode of behavior,</b> i.e., he performs labor and generally acts in an appropriate manner, <b>will not be quick to sin, as it is stated: “And a threefold cord is not quickly broken”</b> (Ecclesiastes 4:12). One who is involved in all three of these activities will not sin easily. <b>And anyone who does not engage in</b> the study of <b>Bible, nor</b> the study of <b>Mishna, nor</b> the <b>desired mode of behavior, is not part of society,</b> i.e., he is not considered a civilized person at all.

### Part 6
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: To what are the righteous in this world compared? To a tree that is standing entirely in a pure place and its branches hang over an impure place.</b> If <b>its branches are cut, it will stand entirely in a pure place. So too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, brings afflictions upon the righteous in this world</b> to cleanse them of their few sins. He makes them suffer <b>so that they will inherit the World-to-Come</b> entirely, <b>as it is stated: “And your beginning was in pain, your end shall greatly increase”</b> (Job 8:7).

### Part 7
<b>And to what are the wicked in this world compared? To a tree that stands entirely in an impure place and whose branches hang over a pure place.</b> If <b>its branches are cut off, it stands entirely in an impure place. So too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, bestows good upon the wicked in this world</b> for the few mitzvot they have performed, <b>in order to expel them and banish them to the lowest level</b> of Gehenna in the future, <b>as it is stated: “There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end are the ways of death”</b> (Proverbs 14:12).

### Part 8
In connection to the mishna’s statement about the importance of Torah study, the Gemara relates the following incident: <b>And</b> there <b>already was</b> an incident in which <b>Rabbi Tarfon and the Elders were reclining in the loft of the house of Nit’za in Lod,</b> when <b>this question was asked of them:</b> Is <b>study greater or is action greater? Rabbi Tarfon answered and said: Action is greater. Rabbi Akiva answered and said: Study is greater. Everyone answered and said: Study is greater,</b> but not as an independent value; rather, it is greater <b>as study leads to action.</b>

### Part 9
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> Torah <b>study is greater, as it preceded</b> the mitzva of separating <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> by <b>forty years.</b> The Torah was given to the Jewish people soon after they left Egypt, whereas the mitzva of separating <i>ḥalla</i> came into effect only after they entered Eretz Yisrael. And it preceded the mitzva of <b><i>terumot</i> and tithes</b> by <b>fifty-four</b> years, as the Jews become obligated in these mitzvot only fourteen years after they entered Eretz Yisrael, once they had conquered and divided the land. Furthermore, the Torah preceded the observance of <b>Sabbatical</b> Years by <b>sixty-one</b> years, as they began to count the seven-year cycle only once they had divided the land. Finally, it preceded the <b>Jubilee</b> Years by <b>103</b> years, as the fifty-year count to the first Jubilee Year began only after they had divided Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: Why does the <i>baraita</i> state <b>103</b> years? <b>It was</b> actually <b>104</b> years. If one adds fifty to the fifty-four years that passed before the Jews began fulfilling the mitzvot dependent on the land, one arrives at a total of 104. The Gemara answers: This <i>tanna</i> <b>maintains</b> that <b>the Jubilee</b> Year <b>releases</b> slaves and returns fields to their original owners <b>from</b> the <b>start</b> of the year. Therefore, 103 years passed before the mitzva of the Jubilee Year took effect.

### Part 11
<b>And just as study</b> comes <b>before action,</b> i.e., the mitzva of Torah study takes precedence over other mitzvot, <b>so too,</b> the <b>judgment</b> concerning Torah study <b>precedes</b> the judgment for <b>an action</b> of the performance of a mitzva. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rav Hamnuna, as Rav Hamnuna says: The beginning of a person’s judgment is only concerning matters of Torah, as it is stated: “The beginning of judgment is as one lets out water”</b> (Proverbs 17:14). This is understood to refer to the sin of neglecting Torah, as the Torah is compared to water, which brings life to the world.

### Part 12
<b>And just as</b> the <b>judgment</b> concerning Torah study <b>precedes</b> the judgment for <b>an action</b> of the performance of a mitzva, <b>so too does</b> the <b>reward</b> for Torah study <b>precede</b> the reward for <b>an action</b> of the performance of a mitzva, <b>as it is stated: “And He gave them the lands of nations, and they took the labor of peoples in possession, that they might observe His statutes and protect His laws”</b> (Psalms 105:44–45). The first reward is for observing the statutes, and as explained on 37a, this is a reference to Torah study.

### Part 13
§ The mishna teaches that <b>anyone who does not engage in</b> the study of <b>Bible, nor</b> the study of <b>Mishna,</b> nor the desired mode of behavior, is not part of society. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And he is disqualified from bearing witness,</b> as this individual cannot be trusted. <b>The Sages taught: One who eats in the marketplace is comparable to a dog,</b> as he disrespects himself through his lack of embarrassment over eating in public. <b>And some say he is</b> even <b>disqualified from bearing witness. Rabbi Idi bar Avin said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion cited in the name of: <b>Some say.</b>

### Part 14
Similarly, <b>bar Kappara taught: An angry person</b>
