### Part 1
<b>he has said nothing,</b> as this statement is not a valid expression of divorce. Similarly, if a master <b>said to his female</b> Canaanite <b>slave</b> upon emancipating her: <b>You are hereby permitted to any man, he has not said anything.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara addresses a less straightforward case: If a man <b>said to his wife: You are hereby for yourself, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>he said</b> this <b>to her only with regard to work?</b> In other words, he might have meant that she may keep her earnings. <b>Or perhaps he said to her</b> that she is on her own <b>entirely,</b> i.e., she is divorced.

### Part 3
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The essence of a bill of manumission</b> is the expression: <b>You are hereby a freeman,</b> or: <b>You are hereby for yourself. Now</b> consider, <b>if</b> in the case of <b>a Canaanite slave, whose body belongs to</b> the master, even so, <b>when</b> the master <b>says to him: You are hereby for yourself,</b> this is considered as though <b>he said to him</b> that he <b>is entirely</b> on his own and is freed, then <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear <b>that a wife, whose body is not owned</b> by her husband, is divorced by means of this expression?

### Part 4
With regard to the same issue, <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> If <b>one said to his</b> Canaanite <b>slave: I have no business with you, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that when <b>he said to him: I have no business with you,</b> he meant <b>entirely,</b> and therefore the slave is freed? <b>Or</b> did he <b>perhaps say</b> this <b>to him with regard to labor?</b> In other words, it is possible that the master is relieving the slave of his obligation to perform labor without actually emancipating him from slavery.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Naḥman said to Rav Ashi, and some say Rav Ḥanin from Meḥoza</b> said <b>to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> With regard to <b>one who sells his</b> Canaanite <b>slave to a gentile,</b> the slave <b>is emancipated but</b> nevertheless <b>requires a bill [<i>get</i>] of manumission from his first master.</b> In this manner the Sages penalized this owner for preventing the slave from fulfilling the mitzvot in which he is obligated.

### Part 6
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says</b> in addition to this: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> This is referring to a situation <b>where he did not write a document [<i>ono</i>] for</b> the slave when he sold him to the gentile. <b>But</b> if <b>he wrote a document for him, this</b> itself <b>is his emancipation.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this <b>document? Rav Sheshet said</b> that <b>he writes to him: When you escape from him I have no business with you.</b> This indicates that the formula: I have no business with you, is a valid expression of emancipation.

### Part 7
§ <b>Abaye says:</b> With regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan,</b> i.e., he previously lent this woman money and he now says that she is betrothed to him by means of that loan, <b>she is not betrothed.</b> The reason is that a woman can be betrothed only through her acceptance of money, or an item that has monetary value, at the time of the betrothal. Although this woman owes the man money, at the time the man states that she is betrothed to him, the loan is not in fact money but an obligation. Therefore, he does not actually give her anything at the time of the betrothal. By contrast, if he betroths her <b>by</b> means of <b>the benefit of the loan, she is betrothed. But it is prohibited to do so, due to</b> the fact that betrothing a woman via the benefit of a loan is <b>an artifice</b> used to circumvent the prohibition <b>of</b> receiving <b>interest,</b> as this enables the husband to gain an additional benefit from the loan.

### Part 8
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is meant</b> by <b>this</b> term: <b>The benefit of the loan? If we say that</b> it means that <b>he established</b> interest <b>upon it</b> when she took the loan, e.g., <b>he said to her</b> that he is lending her <b>four</b> coins <b>in</b> exchange for the repayment of <b>five,</b> and he betroths her by releasing her from the obligation to pay this additional coin, <b>this is</b> a case of <b>full-fledged interest,</b> not merely an artifice used to circumvent the prohibition of receiving interest. He is receiving full payment of the loan and an additional benefit. <b>And furthermore,</b> when he releases her from the obligation to pay this additional coin, he is simply forgoing another obligation she has toward him; he is not giving her anything. <b>This is</b> like a regular case of a betrothal with <b>a loan,</b> and therefore she should not be betrothed.

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where he extended the time</b> of the loan <b>for her.</b> When the time for her to repay the loan arrived he extended the deadline and betrothed her with the financial benefit she receives from the extra time he is giving her to use the money. In this case he does betroth her with the value he is giving her at that time, but it is similar to interest, as it is included in the prohibition of interest to pay the creditor for an extension of the time of a loan.

### Part 10
§ <b>Rava says:</b> With regard to one who says to another: <b>Here are one hundred dinars for you</b> that I am giving you <b>on the condition that you return them to me,</b> if he gave these one hundred dinars as part <b>of a purchase, he does not acquire</b> the item, as he has not given the seller any money. And similarly, <b>with regard to a woman,</b> if he gave her money for her betrothal on the condition that she return it, <b>she is not betrothed.</b> If one gave money in this manner <b>for</b> the <b>redemption of</b> his firstborn <b>son,</b> for which a priest must receive five <i>sela</i>, <b>his son is not redeemed.</b>

### Part 11
If one does this <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., he gives produce to a priest as <i>teruma</i> on the condition that it will be returned, <b>he has</b> technically <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation of <b>giving.</b> Once he gets the <i>teruma</i> back it belongs to him, as he is the original owner, and although it is prohibited for him to partake of it, as he is a non-priest, he may sell it to a different priest. <b>But it is prohibited to do this,</b> i.e., give <i>teruma</i> in this manner, <i>ab initio</i>, <b>because</b> this priest receiving the <i>teruma</i> <b>appears like a priest who assists at the threshing floor,</b> as he presumably agrees to this arrangement in return for some gain.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What does Rava maintain? If he maintains</b> that <b>a gift</b> given <b>on the condition that it is returned is called a gift,</b> this should apply not only to <i>teruma</i> but <b>even</b> to <b>all</b> the other cases, i.e., it should be considered a valid gift in all of the above cases. <b>And if he maintains</b> that a gift of this kind <b>is not called a gift,</b> then <b>even</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i> it</b> should <b>not</b> be considered a legitimate form of giving.

### Part 13
<b>And furthermore, Rava is the one who says: A gift given on the condition that it is</b> later <b>returned is called a gift. As Rava said</b> that if one says to another on the first day of the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>: <b>Take this <i>etrog</i> on the condition that you return it to me,</b> and the recipient <b>takes it,</b> recites a blessing over it, <b>and returns it, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation, despite the fact that one must own the <i>etrog</i> he uses for the mitzva on the first day of <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>And if he does not</b> return it <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, as he gave him the gift only on the condition that it would be returned. This indicates that in the opinion of Rava, a gift that is given on the condition that it is returned is considered a gift.

### Part 14
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: In all of these</b> cases the gift is <b>acquired, except for</b> the betrothal of <b>a woman, because a woman cannot be acquired by</b> means of symbolic <b>exchange. Rav Huna Mar, son of Rav Neḥemya, said to Rav Ashi: We say this in the name of Rava in accordance with your</b> opinion, not in accordance with the previous ruling.

### Part 15
§ <b>Rava says</b> that if a woman said to a man: <b>Give one hundred dinars to so-and-so</b>
