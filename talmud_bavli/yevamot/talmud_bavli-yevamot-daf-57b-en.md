### Part 1
<b>There is</b> significance <b>to</b> a priest entering <b>a wedding canopy</b> with women who are <b>unfit</b> to marry a priest. If a priest’s daughter who is unfit to marry a priest enters the wedding canopy with a priest, she becomes disqualified from partaking of <i>teruma</i> from her father’s household. This is the case even if the priest did not betroth her and they did not engage in sexual intercourse. <b>And Shmuel said: There is no</b> significance <b>to</b> a priest entering the <b>wedding canopy</b> with women who are <b>unfit</b> to marry a priest. Only sexual intercourse disqualifies her from the privileges of priesthood.

### Part 2
<b>Shmuel said: And Abba,</b> i.e., Rav, whose first name was Abba, <b>concedes to me, with regard to a girl less than three years and one day old,</b> that she is not disqualified by merely entering the wedding canopy. <b>Since there is no</b> legal significance to an act of <b>intercourse</b> with <b>her, there is no</b> legal significance to entering the <b>wedding canopy</b> with <b>her.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rava said: We, too, learn</b> in the following <i>baraita</i> that there is no legal significance to an act of intercourse with a girl less than three years old: <b>A girl three years and one day old can be betrothed via sexual intercourse; and if</b> she was a <i>yevama</i> and her <b><i>yavam</i> had intercourse with her, he has acquired her; and</b> a man who has intercourse with her while she is married to someone else <b>is liable on her account because</b> of the prohibition of intercourse with <b>a married woman; and</b> if she experiences a menstrual discharge <b>she renders ritually impure a man who has intercourse with her, so that he renders impure the object upon which he lies like the upper one.</b>

### Part 4
If <b>she is married to a priest she may partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b> If <b>one of those</b> who render women <b>unfit</b> for marrying a priest <b>had intercourse with her, he has disqualified her</b> from being able to partake of <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 5
Rava infers from this <i>baraita</i> that <b>it is a girl three years and one day old who is disqualified via intercourse,</b> and consequently <b>she is</b> also <b>disqualified via the wedding canopy.</b> However, a girl who is <b>less than three years and one day old, who is not disqualified via intercourse, is also not disqualified via the wedding canopy.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that it is so.

### Part 6
<b>Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> With regard to the question of whether <b>there is</b> legal significance <b>to</b> a priest entering the <b>wedding canopy</b> with women who are <b>unfit</b> to marry a priest, <b>we have arrived at the dispute</b> cited in the mishna between <b>Rabbi Meir</b> on the one hand <b>and Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon</b> on the other.
