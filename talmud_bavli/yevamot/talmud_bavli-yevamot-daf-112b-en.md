### Part 1
the mishna <b>should have said</b> that the court <b>asks</b> the <i>yavam</i> to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> rather than forces him. The court would not force him to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> in a case where she deliberately attempted to avoid fulfilling the mitzva of levirate marriage. The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here? With a woman who has children</b> with her husband when she vows, <b>so that it did not enter her mind to the extent</b> that her children would die, and later her husband would also die, and she would happen before his brother for levirate marriage.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But if she has no children, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is it that <b>we ask</b> him to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, but do not force him? If so, then <b>instead of teaching</b> the more remote case that <b>if she intended to do so,</b> to avoid levirate marriage in the event of her husband’s death, <b>even</b> if she vowed <b>during her husband’s lifetime,</b> the court merely <b>asks him to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with her, let</b> the mishna <b>distinguish and teach</b> the distinction <b>within</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>itself,</b> as follows: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When she has children, but if she does not have children,</b> the court merely <b>asks</b> him.

### Part 3
<b>Rather, learn from it</b> that <b>there is no difference</b> between <b>when she has children and when she does not have children.</b> Either way the court <b>forces him</b> to perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> as there is no assumption that the woman planned to avoid levirate marriage unless she says so explicitly. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that the <i>halakha</i> follows Rav’s opinion.
