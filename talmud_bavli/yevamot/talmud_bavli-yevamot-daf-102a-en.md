### Part 1
<b>By Torah law a convert may judge his fellow</b> convert, <b>as it is stated: “You shall set a king over you, whom the Lord your God shall choose; one from among your brothers you shall set king over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15). The Gemara deduces from the terminology of the phrase <b>“over you,”</b> i.e., when presiding over Jews by birth either as a king, a judge, or any other official, that from here it <b>is where we require</b> that the official must be: <b>“From among your brothers,”</b> meaning a Jew by birth. <b>However, a convert may judge his fellow convert,</b> as the requirement of “one from among your brothers” doesn’t apply when presiding over fellow converts.

### Part 2
<b>And if the</b> convert’s <b>mother was from Israel, he may even</b> preside as a judge in a court to <b>adjudicate</b> legal matters involving a native-born <b>Jew. But with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> he may not act as a judge <b>unless both his father and his mother were from Israel</b> from birth, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>: <b>“And his name shall be called in Israel:</b> The house of he who had his shoe removed” (Deuteronomy 25:10), implying that he must be born as a member of the Jewish people from both of his parents.

### Part 3
§ <b>Rabba said</b> that <b>Rav Kahana said</b> that <b>Rav said: If Elijah</b> the Prophet <b>should come and say: One may perform <i>ḥalitza</i> using</b> a soft leather <b>shoe,</b> the Rabbis <b>would listen to him.</b> But if he says: <b>One may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> using</b> a hard leather <b>sandal, they would not listen to him, for the people already have</b> established <b>the practice of</b> performing <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>using a sandal.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rav Kahana said</b> that <b>Rav</b> said: <b>If Elijah</b> the Prophet <b>should come and say: One may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> using</b> a soft leather <b>shoe, they would listen to him.</b> But if he says: <b>One may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> using</b> a hard leather <b>sandal, they would not listen to him, for the people already have</b> established <b>the practice of</b> performing <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>using a sandal.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical <b>difference between</b> these two opinions? Seemingly, they both say the same thing. The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> practical difference <b>between them</b> is with respect to performing <i>ḥalitza</i> with a soft leather <b>shoe <i>ab initio</i>.</b> According to Rabba’s opinion, one may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> this way <i>ab initio</i>, as Rabba said that only if Elijah comes and permits it would he be heeded, implying that until Elijah does so one may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> this way. According to Rav Yosef’s opinion, one may perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with a soft leather shoe until Elijah comes and teaches us otherwise.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that one may <b>even</b> perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with a soft leather shoe <b><i>ab initio</i>, didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (101a): <b>If she performed <i>ḥalitza</i> with</b> a soft leather <b>shoe, her <i>ḥalitza</i> is valid,</b> and the past tense wording indicates <b>after the fact, yes, but it is not</b> valid <b><i>ab initio</i>?</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>The same is</b> true that one may perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with a soft leather shoe <b>even <i>ab initio</i>, but since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>wished to teach in the latter clause</b> of that mishna: If <b>an <i>anpileya</i>,</b> a soft shoe made of cloth, was used for <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>her <i>ḥalitza</i> is disqualified even after the fact, he also taught the first clause</b> of the mishna using wording that indicates validity <b>after the fact,</b> even though it is in fact permitted even <i>ab initio</i>.

### Part 8
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> performing <i>ḥalitza</i> with a soft leather <b>shoe <i>ab initio</i> is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Yosei said: One time I went to</b> the city of <b>Netzivin</b> in Babylonia, and <b>I found</b> there <b>a certain Elder. I said to him: Do you know Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira,</b> who was from Netzivin? <b>He said to me: Yes, and he is</b> a <b>frequent</b> visitor <b>at my table.</b> I asked the Elder: <b>Have you ever seen if he</b> conducted <b>the <i>ḥalitza</i> of a <i>yevama</i>?</b>

### Part 9
<b>He said to me: I saw that he</b> conducted <b><i>ḥalitza</i> many times.</b> I asked him: <b>Using a</b> soft leather <b>shoe or a</b> hard leather <b>sandal? He said to me: Does anyone</b> allow <b>performing <i>ḥalitza</i> with a</b> soft leather <b>shoe? But the Torah said: “His shoe [<i>na’alo</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:9) <b>and not: His shoe [<i>minalo</i>]. I said to him: If so, what did Rabbi Meir see that</b> made <b>him say</b> that if <b>a woman performed <i>ḥalitza</i> using</b> a soft leather <b>shoe her <i>ḥalitza</i> is valid?</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov says in the name</b> of Rabbi Meir: <b>One may perform <i>ḥalitza</i> using</b> a soft leather <b>shoe <i>ab initio</i>.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>And for the one who said one may not</b> perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with a soft leather <b>shoe <i>ab initio</i>, what is the reason</b> for this?

### Part 11
<b>If we say</b> that a soft leather shoe is disqualified <b>because the upper side of the</b> soft leather <b>shoe [<i>panta</i>] is on</b> his foot directly, <b>and the straps</b> [<b><i>arketa</i></b>] tied around the upper portion of the shoe <b>are</b> like a second shoe <b>on top</b> of the shoe that is directly <b>on top</b> of his foot, <b>and the Torah says:</b> “Remove the shoe <b>from on</b> his foot,” indicating that the entire shoe must be “on his foot” <b>but not from on</b> something else <b>that is on</b> his foot, <b>if so,</b> then <b>even after the fact as well,</b> it should <b>not</b> be fit for use. If a soft leather shoe is unfit for <i>ḥalitza</i> by Torah law, it should be prohibited under all circumstances.

### Part 12
Rather, it is <b>a</b> rabbinic <b>decree due to</b> the concern that one might use a <b>torn</b> soft leather <b>shoe,</b> which may nevertheless be worn if torn due to its softness but is prohibited as it does not cover his foot. No similar concern exists with regard to a torn sandal, as due to its hard exterior it would never be worn if torn, and therefore there is no concern that it will be used for <i>ḥalitza</i>.

### Part 13
<b>Alternatively,</b> it is a rabbinic decree <b>due to</b> concern that one might perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with <b>a half shoe,</b> as the <i>ḥalitza</i> shoe must cover most of the foot, yet there are some who wear soft leather shoes that cover only half of the foot. Therefore, there is a prohibition against using a soft leather shoe for <i>ḥalitza ab initio</i> for fear that a half shoe might also accidentally be used. No similar fear exists with a hard leather sandal as a half sandal is never worn.

### Part 14
<b>Rav said: If I had not seen my beloved</b> uncle, Rabbi Ḥiyya, <b>conduct a <i>ḥalitza</i> using a sandal with laces, I would not have conducted <i>ḥalitza</i> with anything other than a sandal of Arabs, which is more tight fitting</b> and snug. The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> sandal <b>of ours,</b> i.e., the customary sandal of that day, <b>although it does have a ring [<i>ḥumrata</i>]</b> on top to ensure that it will not fall off the foot easily, <b>we tie a strap to it</b> during <i>ḥalitza</i> in order to make it tighter, <b>so that her <i>ḥalitza</i> will be</b> of the <b>highest standard.</b> The strap is tied on so that the sandal will not come off by itself, to ensure that the <i>yevama</i> will have to untie the strap in order to remove the sandal.

### Part 15
§ The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the following three <i>halakhot</i> that Rav Yehuda taught in the name of Rav: <b><i>Hatarat</i>,</b> meaning release of; <b><i>yevama</i>; <i>sandal</i>.</b> This mnemonic serves as a reminder that the release of a <i>yevama</i> is done through removing a sandal. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: The release of a <i>yevama</i></b> to enable her marriage <b>to</b> a member of <b>the public occurs when most of the heel is removed</b> from the shoe. Even though the shoe has not been entirely removed, or even removed from most of the <i>yavam’s</i> foot; it is still permitted for her to remarry.

### Part 16
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>If the straps of</b> a soft leather shoe <b>or</b> a hard leather <b>sandal were untied,</b> but not through the actions of the <i>yevama</i>, <b>or if</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>removed most of his foot</b> from the shoe him-self before the <i>yevama</i> completed the removal, <b>her <i>ḥalitza</i> is disqualified.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> her <i>ḥalitza</i> is disqualified <b>is</b> specifically <b>that he removed</b> most of his foot and she only completed the removal, <b>but had she removed</b> most of the foot from the shoe, then <b>her <i>ḥalitza</i></b> would be <b>valid.</b> The Gemara continues: If so, <b>yes,</b> only when the <i>yevama</i> removes <b>most of the foot</b> is the <i>ḥalitza</i> valid, but if she removed only <b>most of the heel,</b> it would <b>not</b> be sufficient.

### Part 18
The Gemara rejects this question: <b>No, most of the foot is</b> the same as <b>most of the heel,</b> and therefore the inference should be that even if she removed most of the heel from the shoe the <i>ḥalitza</i> is valid. <b>And why do they call it: Most of the foot? Because the whole weight of the leg puts pressure on</b> the heel.

### Part 19
The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>supports Rabbi Yannai, as Rabbi Yannai said: Whether he unties</b> the shoe <b>and she removes it,</b> or <b>whether she unties it and he removes it, her <i>ḥalitza</i> is disqualified unless she both unties it and takes it off.</b> And on the same topic, <b>Rabbi Yannai asked: If she</b> did not remove the sandal, but instead <b>ripped it</b> off him, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>If she burned it</b> using coals, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara presents the real issue in question: Is <b>exposure of the foot</b> the essential act of <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>that we require,</b> through any act of removing that which covers the foot, <b>which exists</b> here? <b>Or perhaps it is removal</b> of the shoe from over the foot <b>that we require, which is lacking</b> here? No answer was found to this question, so the Gemara concludes: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 20
<b>Rabbi Neḥemya asked Rabba</b> the following question: If the man were wearing <b>two shoes, one on top of the other, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case? <b>If we say</b> that <b>she removed the outer shoe and the inner shoe remains in place,</b> but <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“From on</b> his foot” <b>and not: From on that which is on</b> his foot. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this question wasn’t asked in a case where the inner shoe remained on his foot. Rather, <b>it is necessary</b> in a case <b>where she tore the outer shoe and took off the inner shoe, and the outer one still remains</b> on his foot although it is torn. The question centers around the previous one with regard to the nature of <i>ḥalitza</i>: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> for valid <i>ḥalitza</i>? Is it <b>removal</b> of the shoe that <b>we require, which we have</b> brought about in this example? <b>Or perhaps</b> it is <b>exposing the foot</b> that <b>we require, which is lacking</b> here, as the foot is still covered by the torn outer shoe.
