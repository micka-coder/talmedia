### Part 1
§ <b>The Sages taught: There is</b> a case in which one <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with his mother due to uncertainty,</b> or <b>with his sister due to uncertainty,</b> or <b>with his daughter due to uncertainty.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> despite the fact that a levirate bond cannot be created between these relatives.

### Part 2
<b>How so?</b> If <b>his mother and another woman had two sons,</b> one each, <b>and they</b> then <b>gave birth to two</b> other <b>sons in hiding,</b> whose identities were confused, such that their lineage was consequently indeterminate, <b>and the</b> known <b>son of this woman came and married the mother of that</b> other known son, <b>and the</b> known <b>son of that woman married this</b> son’s <b>mother, and they died without children,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>this one</b> of the mixed sons <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with both women,</b> as it is unknown which is his mother and which his <i>yevama</i>, <b>and that one</b> likewise <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with both women. It is</b> therefore <b>found</b> that <b>each one of them performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with his mother, due to</b> the <b>uncertainty.</b>

### Part 3
There is a case where a man performs <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>with his sister due to uncertainty. How so?</b> If <b>his mother and another woman gave birth to two females in hiding,</b> and they were mixed, <b>and</b> the paternal, but <b>not maternal,</b> half <b>brothers</b> of this man and of the son of the other woman <b>came and married them, and</b> those half brothers <b>died without children,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that the living half brothers <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with both</b> wives, each with his half sister-in-law. <b>It is</b> therefore <b>found</b> that <b>one performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with his</b> half <b>sister due to uncertainty.</b>

### Part 4
There is a case where one performs <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>with his daughter due to uncertainty. How so?</b> If <b>his wife and another woman gave birth to two females in hiding,</b> and they were mixed, <b>and his brothers</b> and the brothers of the other woman’s husband <b>came and married them, and they died without children,</b> then <b>this one performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with his daughter due to uncertainty, and that one</b> also <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with his daughter due to uncertainty.</b>

### Part 5
§ Following the previous <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara cites two additional <i>baraitot</i> that discuss unusual family situations. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: A man and a woman can sometimes bear</b> children of <b>five nations,</b> i.e., of five separate categories of lineage.

### Part 6
<b>How so?</b> If <b>a Jew bought a slave and a maidservant from the market, and</b> the slave and maidservant <b>had two children</b> at the time, <b>and one of</b> these children <b>converted, it is found</b> that <b>one</b> child <b>is a convert and</b> the other <b>one is a gentile.</b> If the master <b>immersed</b> the slave and maidservant <b>for the sake of</b> giving them the status of <b>slaves, and they engaged in intercourse with each other</b> and had a child, <b>here there are</b> three children in the family who are <b>a convert, and a gentile, and a slave.</b> If he <b>freed the maidservant,</b> which renders her a Jewess, <b>and</b> her husband <b>the slave engaged in intercourse with her,</b> and they had another child, <b>here there are a convert, a gentile, a slave, and a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> The offspring of a slave and a Jewess, according to Rabbi Meir, have the same status as a son born from an incestuous or adulterous relationship. If the master subsequently <b>freed both</b> the maidservant and the slave <b>and married them to each other</b> and they had another child, <b>here there are a convert, a gentile, a slave, a <i>mamzer</i>, and</b> a regular <b>Jew.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaching us?</b> The Gemara answers: It is teaching us that if <b>a gentile or a slave engaged in intercourse with a Jewish woman,</b> their <b>offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b>

### Part 8
<b>The Sages taught: There is</b> a case in which a man <b>sells his father</b> in order <b>to collect his mother’s marriage contract for her. How so? A Jew bought a slave and a maidservant from the market, and they had a son, and</b> the master <b>freed the maidservant and married her, and he arose and wrote</b> that <b>all his property</b> should go <b>to her son,</b> including her son’s father, the slave. <b>It is found</b> that <b>this</b> son, after receiving the master’s property, might <b>sell his father to collect</b> for <b>his mother her marriage contract.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaching us?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The entire</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Meir, and</b> it is teaching us that although the legal status of <b>a slave is</b> like that of <b>movable property, and</b> there are those who hold that movable property cannot be mortgaged, Rabbi Meir holds that <b>movable property is mortgaged for a marriage contract.</b> This is also Rabbi Meir’s ruling elsewhere. Therefore, one might be obligated to sell his slave to pay a marriage contract. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that it is <b>teaching us this:</b> The legal status of <b>a slave is like</b> that of <b>real estate,</b> and therefore, according to all opinions one is obligated to sell his slave to pay a marriage contract.

### Part 10
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a woman whose offspring was mixed with the offspring of her daughter-in-law,</b> and their lineage was consequently indeterminate, and <b>the mixed</b> sons <b>matured and married women, and</b> subsequently <b>they died, the</b> certain <b>sons of the daughter-in-law perform <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with the wives, <b>but not levirate marriage, as</b> with regard to each wife <b>it is uncertain</b> whether she is <b>his brother’s wife,</b> and therefore his <i>yevama</i>, and <b>uncertain</b> whether she is <b>his father’s brother’s wife,</b> who is forbidden to him.

### Part 11
However, <b>the</b> certain <b>sons of the elder woman,</b> i.e., the mother-in-law, <b>perform either <i>ḥalitza</i> or levirate marriage, as</b> with regard to each wife <b>it is uncertain</b> whether she is <b>his brother’s wife,</b> in which case levirate marriage is valid, <b>or his brother’s son’s wife,</b> in which case she is permitted to him, after having performed <i>ḥalitza</i> with a son of the daughter-in-law.

### Part 12
If <b>the</b> sons of certain, <b>unflawed</b> lineage were the ones who <b>died,</b> then <b>the mixed</b> sons <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with</b> the widows of <b>the elder woman’s sons but not levirate marriage, as it is uncertain</b> whether she is <b>his brother’s wife or his father’s brother’s wife. With</b> the widows of <b>the</b> certain <b>sons of the daughter-in-law, one</b> of the mixed sons <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> in case she is his brother’s wife. <b>And</b> the other <b>one performs levirate marriage,</b> as even if she is his brother’s son’s wife, she is permitted to him.

### Part 13
In the case of <b>a priestess whose offspring was mixed with her maidservant’s offspring, they may partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as both a priest and the slave of a priest partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>And they receive one share</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>in the granary.</b>
