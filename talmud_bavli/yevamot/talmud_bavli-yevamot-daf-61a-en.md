### Part 1
<b>The graves of gentiles do not render</b> items <b>impure though a tent, as it is stated: “And you My sheep, the sheep of My pasture, are men [<i>adam</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 34:31), from which it is derived that <b>you,</b> the Jewish people, <b>are called men [<i>adam</i>] but gentiles are not called men [<i>adam</i>].</b> Since the Torah introduces the <i>halakha</i> of ritual impurity of a tent with the words: “When a man [<i>adam</i>] dies in a tent” (Numbers 19:14), this <i>halakha</i> applies only to corpses of Jews but not those of gentiles.

### Part 2
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based upon the verse with regard to captives taken during the war against Midian: <b>“And the persons [<i>nefesh adam</i>] were sixteen thousand”</b> (Numbers 31:40), which indicates that gentiles are also referred to as <i>adam</i>. The Gemara answers: They are given this title <b>due to</b> the need to distinguish the people taken captive from the <b>animals</b> that were taken as spoils of war.

### Part 3
The Gemara raises another difficulty based upon a verse with regard to the city of Nineveh: <b>“Wherein are more than one hundred and twenty thousand men [<i>adam</i>] that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle”</b> (Jonah 4:11). The Gemara answers: There, too, the gentiles are given this title <b>due to</b> the need to distinguish them from the <b>animals</b> mentioned in the verse.

### Part 4
The Gemara continues to question Rabbi Shimon’s ruling based upon a verse pertaining to the war against Midian: <b>“Whoever has killed anyone, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves”</b> (Numbers 31:19). This indicates that gentile corpses convey ritual impurity. The Gemara answers: <b>Perhaps a Jew was killed,</b> and the concern was for impurity caused by his corpse. <b>And the Rabbis</b> reply that the verse attests: <b>“Not one man of us is missing”</b> (Numbers 31:49). No Jewish soldiers fell in battle, and therefore the concern for impurity must have been due to the corpses of gentiles. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai</b> responds: The intent of that verse is that <b>not one man of us is missing</b> due to <b>transgression,</b> i.e., none of them sinned.

### Part 5
<b>Ravina said</b> that the explanation above is unnecessary: <b>Granted, the verse excluded</b> gentiles <b>from rendering</b> items <b>impure through a tent, as it is written: “When a man [<i>adam</i>] dies in a tent”</b> (Numbers 19:14); but <b>did the verse exclude them from</b> rendering items impure via <b>touching and carrying?</b> Since gentile corpses convey impurity in these ways, they could have rendered impure the Jews involved in the war with Midian, even according to Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai.

### Part 6
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a priest <b>betrothed a widow and was</b> subsequently <b>appointed to be High Priest, he may marry</b> her. <b>And</b> there was <b>an incident with Yehoshua ben Gamla, who betrothed Marta bat Baitos,</b> a widow, <b>and the king</b> subsequently <b>appointed him to be High Priest, and</b> he nevertheless <b>married her.</b> Conversely, in the case of <b>a widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i> who happened before a common priest,</b> i.e., the priest was her <i>yavam</i>, <b>and he was</b> subsequently <b>appointed to be High Priest,</b> then <b>even if he</b> had already <b>performed levirate betrothal with her, he may not marry her,</b> because she is a widow.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> a priest <b>betrothed a widow and was</b> subsequently <b>appointed to be High Priest, that he may marry</b> her? <b>The verse states: “Shall he take for a wife”</b> (Leviticus 21:14), an inclusive phrase that indicates that he may marry her in this situation despite the general prohibition for a High Priest to marry a widow. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, a widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i></b> should <b>also</b> be permitted to a High Priest. The Gemara answers: The word <b>“wife”</b> indicates that this does <b>not</b> include <b>a <i>yevama</i>,</b> who was not initially his wife but his brother’s.

### Part 8
The mishna related <b>an incident with Yehoshua</b> ben Gamla. The Gemara notes that the mishna states that the king <b>appointed him, yes,</b> but <b>not</b> that he <b>was</b> worthy of being <b>appointed. Rav Yosef said: I see a conspiracy here,</b> as this was clearly not a proper appointment by the priests and the Sanhedrin but rather a political appointment, <b>as Rav Asi said: Marta bat Baitos brought</b> a vessel the size of <b>a half-<i>se’a</i> [<i>tarkav</i>]</b> full <b>of dinars to King Yannai until he appointed Yehoshua ben Gamla High Priest.</b>

### Part 9
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A High Priest whose brother died</b> without children <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> and he does not perform levirate marriage,</b> as he may not marry a widow.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: The mishna <b>teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>categorically,</b> indicating that <b>it is no different</b> if she is his brother’s widow <b>from betrothal, and it is no different</b> if she is his widow <b>from marriage.</b> The Gemara analyzes this <i>halakha</i>: <b>Granted,</b> she is forbidden to him if she was widowed <b>from marriage, as,</b> if he were to marry her, <b>it</b> would be a violation of both the <b>positive mitzva</b> that the High Priest marry a virgin <b>and</b> the <b>prohibition</b> for him to marry a widow. <b>And a positive mitzva,</b> i.e., levirate marriage, <b>does not override a prohibition and a positive</b> mitzva together. <b>However,</b> if she was a widow <b>from betrothal</b> and is therefore still a virgin, <b>the positive mitzva</b> of levirate marriage <b>should come and override the prohibition</b> for a High Priest to marry a widow.

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: By Torah law, levirate marriage is permitted in this case. However, there is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> prohibiting their <b>first</b> act of <b>intercourse due to</b> their <b>second</b> act of <b>intercourse.</b> After they have engaged in intercourse once, they have fulfilled the mitzva of levirate marriage, and any subsequent act of intercourse would constitute a violation of the prohibition without the fulfillment of a mitzva.

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A common priest may not marry a sexually underdeveloped woman [<i>aylonit</i>],</b> who is incapable of bearing children, <b>unless he</b> already <b>has a wife and children. Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> if <b>he has a wife and children, he may not marry a sexually underdeveloped woman, as she is the <i>zona</i></b> about whom it is <b>stated in the Torah</b> that a priest may not marry her. Intercourse with her is considered a licentious act because she is incapable of bearing children. <b>And the Rabbis say: The only</b> women in the category of <b><i>zona</i>,</b> who are therefore forbidden to a priest, are <b>a female convert, a freed</b> maidservant, <b>and</b> any woman <b>who engaged in licentious sexual intercourse</b> with a man she is prohibited from marrying.

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Exilarch said to Rav Huna: What is the reason</b> for the <i>halakha</i> that a priest may not marry a sexually underdeveloped woman? It is <b>because</b> he is obligated to fulfill the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply. Is it</b> only <b>priests who were commanded to be fruitful and multiply, but Israelites were not commanded?</b> Why does the mishna specify that a priest may not marry a sexually underdeveloped woman? Rav Huna <b>said to him:</b> This <i>halakha</i> does in fact apply even to Israelites, and the <i>tanna</i> mentions priests <b>because he wants to teach</b> it in a way that would parallel <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which states that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> if <b>he has a wife</b>
