### Part 1
<b>and who lends a <i>sela</i> to a pauper at his time of need, about him the verse states: “Then shall you call, and the Lord will answer; you shall cry, and He will say: Here I am”</b> (Isaiah 58:9).

### Part 2
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> device for a series of statements cited in the name of Rabbi Elazar: <b>Woman; and land; helper; this; two; the blessings; merchants; lowly.</b> The Gemara presents these statements: <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Any man who does not have a wife is not a man, as it is stated: “Male and female He created them…and called their name Adam”</b> (Genesis 5:2). <b>And Rabbi Elazar said: Any man who does not have</b> his own <b>land is not a man, as it is stated: “The heavens are the heavens of the Lord; but the earth He has given to the children of men”</b> (Psalms 115:16).

### Part 3
<b>And Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that</b> which <b>is written: “I will make him a helpmate for him [<i>kenegdo</i>]”</b> (Genesis 2:18)? If one is <b>worthy</b> his wife <b>helps him;</b> if he is <b>not worthy</b> she is <b>against him. And some say</b> a slightly different version: <b>Rabbi Elazar raised a contradiction: It is written</b> in the Torah with a spelling that allows it to be read: <b>Striking him [<i>kenagdo</i>], and we read</b> it as though it said: <b>For him [<i>kenegdo</i>].</b> If he is <b>worthy</b> she is <b>for him</b> as his helpmate; if he is <b>not worthy</b> she <b>strikes him.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yosei encountered Elijah</b> the prophet and <b>said to him: It is written: I will make him a helpmate. In what</b> manner <b>does a woman help a man?</b> Elijah <b>said to him:</b> When <b>a man brings wheat</b> from the field, does he <b>chew</b> raw <b>wheat?</b> When he brings home <b>flax,</b> does he <b>wear</b> unprocessed <b>flax?</b> His wife turns the raw products into bread and clothing. Is his wife <b>not found</b> to be the one who <b>lights up his eyes and stands him on his feet?</b>

### Part 5
<b>And Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that</b> which <b>is written: “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh”</b> (Genesis 2:23)? This <b>teaches that Adam had intercourse with each animal and beast</b> in his search for his mate, <b>and his mind was not at ease,</b> in accordance with the verse: “And for Adam, there was not found a helpmate for him” (Genesis 2:20), <b>until he had intercourse with Eve.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And Rabbi Elazar said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that</b> which <b>is written: “And in you shall all the families of the earth be blessed [<i>nivrekhu</i>]”</b> (Genesis 12:3)? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Abraham: I have two good shoots to graft</b> [<b><i>lehavrikh</i></b>] <b>onto you: Ruth the Moabite,</b> the ancestress of the house of David, <b>and Naamah the Ammonite,</b> whose marriage with Solomon led to the ensuing dynasty of the kings of Judea. <b>“All the families of the earth”</b> means: <b>Even families that live in the earth,</b> i.e., who have land of their own, <b>are blessed only due to the Jewish people.</b> Similarly, when the verse states: <b>“All the nations of the earth</b> shall be blessed in him” (Genesis 18:18), it indicates that <b>even ships that come from Galia to Hispania are blessed only due to the Jewish people.</b>

### Part 7
<b>And Rabbi Elazar said: All craftsmen are destined to stand upon</b> and work <b>the land, as it is stated: “And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land”</b> (Ezekiel 27:29). <b>And Rabbi Elazar said: There is no occupation lowlier than</b> working <b>the land, as it is stated: “And they shall come down,”</b> implying that one who works the land is of lower stature than even a sailor. The Gemara similarly relates: <b>Rabbi Elazar saw land that was plowed</b> across <b>its width. He said to it:</b> Even <b>if they plow you</b> once more <b>lengthwise,</b> for further improvement, <b>conducting business is better than</b> farming with <b>you,</b> as the potential profits gained by selling merchandise are far greater than those from working the land.

### Part 8
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <b>Rav entered between the sheaves</b> in a field and <b>saw them waving</b> in the wind. <b>He said to them: If you</b> want to <b>wave</b> go ahead and <b>wave,</b> but <b>conducting business is better than</b> farming with <b>you. Rava</b> similarly <b>said:</b> One who has <b>a hundred dinars</b> that are invested <b>in</b> a <b>business</b> is able to eat <b>meat and wine every day,</b> whereas he who has <b>a hundred dinars</b> worth <b>of land</b> eats only <b>salt and vegetables. And what is more,</b> working the land <b>causes him to lie on the ground</b> at night in order to guard it, <b>and</b> it <b>draws quarrels upon him</b> with other people.

### Part 9
<b>Rav Pappa said: Sow</b> your own produce <b>and do not buy</b> it. <b>Even though they are equal to each other</b> in value, <b>these</b> that you sow <b>will be blessed.</b> Conversely, <b>buy</b> your clothes <b>rather than weave [<i>teizul</i>]</b> them yourself. The Gemara comments: <b>This applies</b> only to <b>mats [<i>bistarkei</i>], but</b> with regard to the <b>cloak</b> one wears, perhaps <b>he will not find it</b> precisely to his liking, and therefore he should make his own cloak, which fits his measurements.

### Part 10
Rav Pappa further advised: If there is a hole in your house, <b>close</b> it <b>up and do not</b> enlarge it and then <b>plaster</b> it, or at least <b>plaster</b> it <b>and do not</b> knock it down and <b>build</b> it again. <b>As, whoever engages in construction becomes poor. Hurry</b> to <b>buy land</b> so that you do not lose the opportunity. Be <b>patient and marry a woman</b> who is suitable for you. <b>Descend a level</b> to <b>marry a woman</b> of lower social status, and <b>ascend a level</b> to <b>choose a friend [<i>shushevina</i>].</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Elazar bar Avina said: Calamity befalls the world only due to</b> the sins of <b>the Jewish people, as it is stated: “I have cut off nations, their corners are desolate; I have made their streets waste”</b> (Zephaniah 3:6), <b>and it is written: “I said: Surely you will fear Me, you will receive correction”</b> (Zephaniah 3:7). This indicates that other nations were punished so that the Jewish people would mend their ways.

### Part 12
The Gemara cites more statements with regard to wives. When <b>Rav was taking leave of</b> his uncle and teacher, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> upon his return from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: May the Merciful One save you from something that is worse than death.</b> Rav was perplexed: <b>Is there anything that is worse than death? He went, examined</b> the sources, <b>and found</b> the following verse: <b>“And I find more bitter than death the woman, etc.”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:26). Rabbi Ḥiyya was hinting at this verse, and indeed, <b>Rav’s wife would</b> constantly <b>aggravate him. When he would say to her: Prepare me lentils, she would prepare him peas;</b> if he asked her for <b>peas, she would prepare him lentils.</b>

### Part 13
<b>When Ḥiyya, his son, grew up, he would reverse</b> the requests Rav asked him to convey <b>to her,</b> so that Rav would get what he wanted. Rav <b>said to</b> his son Ḥiyya: <b>Your mother has improved</b> now that <b>you</b> convey my requests. <b>He said to</b> Rav: <b>It is I who reverse</b> your request <b>to her.</b> Rav <b>said to him: This is</b> an example of the well-known adage <b>that people say:</b> He <b>who comes from you shall teach you wisdom;</b> I should have thought of that idea myself. <b>You,</b> however, <b>should not do so,</b> i.e., reverse my request, <b>as it is stated: “They have taught their tongue to speak lies, they</b> weary themselves to <b>commit iniquity, etc.”</b> (Jeremiah 9:4). If you attribute such a request to me, you will have uttered a falsehood.

### Part 14
The Gemara relates a similar story. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya’s wife would</b> constantly <b>aggravate him.</b> Nevertheless, <b>when he would find something</b> she would appreciate, <b>he would wrap it in his shawl and bring</b> it <b>to her. Rav said to him: Doesn’t she</b> constantly <b>aggravate you?</b> Why do you bring her things? Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: It is enough for us</b> that our wives <b>raise our children and save us</b>
