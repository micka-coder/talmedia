### Part 1
<b>It is derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the terms <b>entering</b> and <b>entering.</b> The verse states in the context of a prohibition: “A <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:3), and in the context of a prohibition derived from a positive mitzva: “The children that are born to them of the third generation may enter into the assembly of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:9). Consequently, these types of prohibitions are equated.

### Part 2
The Gemara poses another question: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the initial stage of intercourse is considered sexual intercourse with regard to the prohibition against a <b><i>yevama</i></b> having intercourse with a man from <b>the general public?</b> The Gemara answers that there is no need for an independent source in this case: <b>If</b> you are asking <b>according to the one who said</b> that this is an ordinary <b>prohibition,</b> it is <b>a prohibition</b> like any other. <b>If</b> you are asking <b>according to the one who said</b> that this is <b>a positive mitzva,</b> it is <b>a positive mitzva</b> like any other.

### Part 3
<b>Rather,</b> the question is as follows: <b>From where do we</b> derive that a <b><i>yevama</i></b> is acquired by her <b><i>yavam</i></b> via the initial stage of intercourse? The Gemara answers: <b>It is derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the <b>words entering</b> and <b>entering.</b> This verb is used with regard to ordinary Torah prohibitions, as mentioned above, and also with regard to levirate marriage, in the verse “Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her” (Deuteronomy 25:5).

### Part 4
The Gemara asks further: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>a woman</b> is betrothed <b>to her husband</b> through the initial stage of intercourse? The Gemara answers: <b>It is derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the words <b>taking</b> and <b>taking.</b> With regard to betrothal, the verse states: “When a man takes a wife and marries her” (Deuteronomy 24:1). This verb is also used with regard to forbidden intercourse, as in the verse: “And if a man shall take his sister” (Leviticus 20:17).

### Part 5
§ <b>Rava said:</b> Now that it has been established that the initial stage of intercourse is considered an act of sexual intercourse, <b>why do I</b> need the expression <b>“cohabitation with seed”</b> (Leviticus 19:20) <b>that the Merciful One writes with regard to a designated maidservant;</b> the expression <b>“cohabitation with seed”</b> (Leviticus 18:20) written <b>with regard to a married woman;</b> and the expression <b>“cohabitation with seed”</b> (Numbers 5:13) written with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i>?</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara explains that the expression is necessary with regard to <b>a designated maidservant as we said</b> above (55a), because it indicates that one is liable to receive punishment only for a complete act of intercourse with a designated maidservant but not for the initial stage of intercourse. With regard to <b>a married woman,</b> the word seed <b>excludes one who has intercourse</b> with a <b>dead</b> organ, i.e., one that is not erect, as this cannot lead to childbirth.

### Part 7
The Gemara questions this resolution: <b>This</b> works out <b>well according to the one who said</b> that one who <b>has intercourse</b> while his organ is <b>dead</b> with <b>those with whom relations are forbidden, is exempt,</b> as this is not considered an act of intercourse. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>he is liable, what is there to say? Rather,</b> according to this opinion, the verse <b>excludes one who has intercourse with a dead</b> woman. <b>As</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since after death</b> she <b>is also called</b> her husband’s <b>kin, say that</b> one who had intercourse with her <b>should be liable</b> to receive punishment for committing adultery <b>with a married woman.</b> It therefore <b>teaches us</b> that intercourse with a dead woman is not considered intercourse at all.

### Part 8
The Gemara addresses the third case: <b>Why do I need</b> the expression cohabitation with seed in the context of <b>a <i>sota</i>?</b> It is needed <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that the expression <b>a cohabitation with seed excludes something else.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this <b>something else? Rav Sheshet said: It excludes</b> a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>was jealous with regard to her</b> and warned her not to seclude herself and have <b>atypical,</b> i.e., anal, sexual intercourse with another man. <b>Rava</b> objected to this explanation and <b>said to him: It is written: “The cohabitations of a woman”</b> (Leviticus 18:22), indicating that there are two types of intercourse with a woman, and the same <i>halakha</i> applies to both.

### Part 9
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> It <b>excludes</b> a situation <b>where</b> the husband <b>was jealous with regard to her</b> and warned her not to seclude herself with another man and engage in intimate contact <b>by way of</b> other <b>limbs.</b> The verse indicates that the wife does not become prohibited to her husband if she secludes herself with the man after this warning. <b>Abaye said to him:</b> Does <b>the Merciful One prohibit</b> a woman to her husband due merely to <b>licentious</b> behavior without sexual intercourse? Since this behavior would not render a woman prohibited to her husband, it is obvious that a warning that explicitly mentions this behavior is insufficient to cause the woman to become a <i>sota</i> if she then secludes herself with the man.

### Part 10
<b>Rather, Abaye said: It excludes</b> a case <b>where</b> he <b>was jealous with regard to her</b> and warned her not to seclude herself with another man and <b>kiss,</b> i.e., have external contact of the sexual organs. The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> works out <b>well according to the one who said</b> that the definition of <b>the initial stage of intercourse is the insertion of the corona;</b> therefore, mere external contact is not considered sexual intercourse. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that the definition of the initial stage of intercourse is a <b>kiss, what is there to say?</b>

### Part 11
<b>Rather,</b> the expression: Something else, in the <i>baraita</i>, is <b>actually</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>was jealous with regard to her</b> and warned her not to seclude herself with another man and engage in intimate contact <b>by way of</b> other <b>limbs. And it is necessary</b> to state that the woman does not become prohibited to her husband as a <i>sota</i> in this case, as <b>it might enter your mind to say that the Merciful One made</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>dependent on the husband’s objection,</b> as it is his decision to warn his wife, <b>and</b> since <b>he objects</b> to contact of this nature, she becomes a <i>sota</i> if she secludes herself after this warning. The Torah therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not considered a warning.

### Part 12
§ The Gemara returns to the precise definition of the initial stage of intercourse. <b>Shmuel said:</b> The definition of <b>the initial stage of intercourse is a kiss,</b> i.e., external contact of the sexual organs. Shmuel explains: This is <b>comparable to a person who places his finger on his mouth;</b> it is <b>impossible that he not press the flesh</b> of his lips. Similarly, when there is contact of the sexual organs, there will certainly be at least a small amount of penetration, and this is considered an act of sexual intercourse.

### Part 13
<b>When Rabba bar bar Ḥana came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said: <b>The completion of intercourse</b> stated <b>with regard to a designated maidservant is the insertion of the corona,</b> and no more. <b>Rav Sheshet raised an objection</b> based upon the following <i>baraita</i>: The phrase <b>cohabitation with seed</b> indicates that <b>one is liable</b> to receive punishment <b>only for a complete</b> act of <b>sexual intercourse. What, does</b> this <b>not</b> refer to the <b>complete</b> insertion of the <b>member?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is possible that it is referring to the <b>complete</b> insertion of the <b>corona.</b>

### Part 14
<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said: The definition of <b>the initial stage of intercourse is the insertion of the corona. They said to him: But Rabba bar bar Ḥana did not say so,</b> as he taught that Rabbi Yoḥanan said that the insertion of the corona constitutes a complete act of sexual intercourse and is not considered merely the initial stage of intercourse. <b>He said to them: Either he lied or I am lying.</b> There is clearly a contradiction, and one of us cited Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion incorrectly.

### Part 15
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said: The definition of <b>the initial stage of intercourse is the insertion of the corona.</b> The Gemara comments: He <b>certainly disagrees with Rabba bar bar Ḥana,</b> who cited Rabbi Yoḥanan as stating that insertion of the corona constitutes a complete act of sexual intercourse. <b>Shall we say that he</b> also <b>disagrees with Shmuel,</b> who defined the initial stage of intercourse as external contact of the sexual organs?

### Part 16
The Gemara responds: <b>No;</b> it is possible that there is no dispute between them, and Ravin said that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>calls</b> the entire process <b>from a kiss until the insertion of the corona the initial stage of intercourse,</b> while anything beyond that point is a complete act of sexual intercourse.

### Part 17
<b>When Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda came</b> from Eretz Yisrael he reported that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The definition of <b>the initial stage of intercourse is the insertion of the corona,</b> whereas <b>a complete</b> act of <b>sexual intercourse is literally a complete</b> act of <b>sexual intercourse,</b> i.e., insertion of the male organ beyond the corona.
