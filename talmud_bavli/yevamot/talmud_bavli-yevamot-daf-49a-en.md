### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Which</b> offspring of forbidden relations have the status of <b>a <i>mamzer</i>?</b> It is the offspring of a union with <b>any next of kin that is subject to</b> a Torah prohibition that <b>he should not engage in sexual relations</b> with them; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Shimon HaTimni says:</b> It is the offspring of a union with <b>any</b> forbidden relation <b>for which one is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> at the hand of Heaven. And the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his statement. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> It is the offspring of a union with <b>any</b> forbidden relation <b>for which one is liable to</b> receive <b>court-</b>imposed <b>capital punishment.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Azzai said: I found a scroll</b> recording people’s <b>lineages in Jerusalem, and it was written in it</b> that <b>so-and-so is a <i>mamzer</i> from</b> an adulterous union with <b>a married woman,</b> a sin punishable by court-imposed capital punishment. The only reason for the scroll to state the reason that this individual is a <i>mamzer</i> is in order <b>to support the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua.</b>

### Part 3
The mishna delineates the circumstances in which it is prohibited to engage in relations with the sister of one’s wife and the sister of one’s <i>yevama</i>: If a man’s <b>wife died, he is permitted to her sister.</b> If <b>he divorced her and</b> then <b>she died, he is permitted to her sister.</b> If he divorced his wife and then <b>she was married to another and</b> then <b>died, he is permitted to her sister.</b> If <b>his <i>yevama</i> died, he is permitted to her sister.</b> If <b>he performed <i>ḥalitza</i> with her and</b> then <b>she died, he is permitted to her sister.</b> If after <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>she was married to another and</b> then <b>died, he is permitted to her sister.</b> The principle underlying all these cases is that the prohibition against engaging in relations with her sister only applies while the wife or <i>yevama</i> remain alive, irrespective of their current relationship to the man.

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is Rabbi Akiva’s reasoning? As it is written: “A man shall not take his father’s wife, and he shall not uncover his father’s cloak”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:1). This teaches that a <b>cloak that his father saw,</b> i.e., a woman with whom his father engaged in sexual relations, the son <b>may not uncover.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And</b> in this interpretation of the verse, Rabbi Akiva <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said:</b> The verse states only that such relations are forbidden, but they would not render him liable to receive <i>karet</i>; perforce <b>the verse speaks of a woman raped by one’s father,</b> since <b>she is</b> one of the women with whom relations render one <b>liable for</b> violating <b>a prohibition.</b> The verse could not refer to one’s father’s wife since relations with her render one liable to receive <i>karet</i>.

### Part 6
The Gemara completes its explanation of Rabbi Akiva’s opinion: <b>And in close proximity to that</b> verse is the verse: <b>“A <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:3). <b>Apparently,</b> even <b>from these</b> forbidden relations, which render one liable for the violation of a prohibition, the offspring <b>is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rabbi Simai, who</b> holds that Rabbi Akiva <b>includes</b> as a <i>mamzer</i> the offspring of all <b>other</b> forbidden relations <b>for which one is liable</b> for violation of <b>a prohibition,</b> even those <b>that are not</b> with his <b>next of kin; and</b> also <b>according to Rabbi Yeshevav, who</b> holds that Rabbi Akiva <b>includes even</b> the offspring of relations <b>for which one is liable for</b> the violation of a <b>positive mitzva;</b> since according to them, Rabbi Akiva includes cases that are not similar to the case a woman raped by his father, what is his source?

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>They derive</b> it <b>from</b> the verse that states: <b>“And he shall not</b> uncover his father’s cloak” (Deuteronomy 23:1). The word “and” is superfluous and serves to include additional cases.

### Part 9
<b>And Shimon HaTimni holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say:</b> It is <b>with regard to the widow waiting for his father</b> to perform <b>levirate marriage that the verse is speaking,</b> and it indicates <b>that she is</b> one of the women with whom relations <b>render one liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>. And in close proximity to that</b> verse is the verse: <b>“A <i>mamzer</i> shall not enter</b> into the congregation of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:3). <b>Apparently,</b> only the offspring of a union <b>for which one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehoshua</b> derive his opinion? If the verses should be derived as Rabbi Akiva and Shimon HaTimni suggest, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> only: <b>“He shall not uncover</b> his father’s cloak.” It is unnecessary for the verse to mention the prohibition with regard to one’s father’s wife, as the fact that the offspring of that union is a <i>mamzer</i> would be known through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, since that prohibition is more stringent than the one derived from the verse: “And shall not uncover his father’s cloak.” <b>Why do I</b> need both the clause <b>“a man shall not take</b> his father’s wife” and the clause <b>“and shall not uncover</b> his father’s cloak”? <b>Rather, is it not</b> that <b>this is what</b> the Torah <b>is saying:</b> Only the offspring of relations with the woman mentioned in the verse <b>after</b> the words <b>“a man shall not take” until</b> the words <b>“he shall not uncover,”</b> i.e., his father’s wife, <b>is a <i>mamzer</i>, but</b> the offspring of relations with the woman mentioned <b>beyond</b> that point, i.e., the woman referred to as “his father’s cloak,” <b>is not a <i>mamzer</i>.</b>

### Part 11
§ <b>Abaye said: All</b> <i>tanna’im</i> in the mishna <b>agree with regard to one who engages in sexual relations with a menstruating woman,</b>
