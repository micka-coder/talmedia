### Part 1
<b>as initially,</b> before the flour was consecrated, <b>it was among</b> all other foods that are <b>permitted to him,</b> and then when the flour was consecrated as a meal-offering, <b>it became forbidden</b> to him, <b>and</b> then once a handful of the offering was brought on the altar, <b>it reverted</b> from its forbidden status <b>and became permitted to him.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>it would revert to its original permitted status;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “It shall be eaten unleavened in a sacred place”</b> (Leviticus 6:9), which indicates that it is <b>a mitzva</b> to eat it.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rava, who said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis;</b> according to him, <b>here,</b> in the first clause, <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: “It shall be eaten unleavened in a sacred place”</b> indicates that it is <b>a mitzva</b> for the priest who prepares the offering to eat it himself. <b>As, initially,</b> before the flour was consecrated, <b>it was among</b> all other foods that are <b>permitted to him:</b> If <b>he wishes, he may eat it, and if he wishes, he may</b> choose <b>not</b> to <b>eat it.</b> When the flour was consecrated, <b>it became forbidden</b> to him, <b>and</b> then once a handful was brought on the altar, <b>it reverted</b> from its forbidden status <b>and became permitted to him.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>it would revert to its original permitted status,</b> so that if <b>he wishes, he may eat it, and</b> if <b>he wishes, he may</b> choose <b>not</b> to <b>eat it.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara interjects that the logic of this last statement seems implausible: Could it be that if <b>he wishes, he may</b> choose <b>not</b> to <b>eat it? But isn’t it written: “And they shall eat those things through which atonement is attained”</b> (Exodus 29:33), which <b>teaches that the priests eat</b> portions of the offering <b>and</b> by their doing so <b>the owners</b> who brought the offering <b>attain atonement?</b> Clearly, then, the eating of the offerings is not volitional.

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should be understood as saying: One might have thought that if <b>he wishes, he may eat it, and if he wishes, another priest may eat it;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “It shall be eaten unleavened in a sacred place”</b> (Leviticus 6:9), to teach that it is <b>a mitzva</b> for the priest who prepares the offering to eat it himself. This explanation of the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> is entirely consistent with Rava’s explanation of the latter clause concerning the mitzvot of levirate marriage. In his opinion, both clauses demonstrate that there is a mitzva to perform an action in a case where one might have thought there was none.

### Part 5
<b>However, according to Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi, who said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul</b> and explained the <i>baraita</i> accordingly as teaching the correct manner in which the mitzva is to be performed, <b>here,</b> in the first clause concerning the meal-offering, <b>what two manners</b> of eating <b>are there</b> of which one would be prohibited?

### Part 6
<b>And if you would say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> might refer to two types of eating and is saying: One might have thought that if <b>he wishes he may eat it with an appetite, and if he wishes he may eat it</b> though an act of <b>excessive eating,</b> forcing himself to eat despite already being fully satiated; perforce this is not correct, as does <b>excessive eating have the</b> legal <b>status of</b> an act of <b>eating? Didn’t Reish Lakish say: One who eats</b> through an act of <b>excessive eating on Yom Kippur is exempt from</b> the punishment of <i>karet</i> indicated in the verse: “For whatever soul it be that <b>shall not be afflicted</b> in that same day shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 23:29)? From this it is apparent that excessive eating does not have the legal status of an act of eating.

### Part 7
The Gemara therefore suggests a different interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> that is consistent with Rav Yitzḥak’s opinion: <b>Rather,</b> say the <i>baraita</i> is referring to two different manners in which the meal-offering was prepared: If <b>he wishes he may eat it unleavened,</b> and if <b>he wishes he may eat it leavened.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara interjects that the logic of this last statement seems implausible: Could it be that if he wishes, the offering could be leavened? <b>But isn’t it written: “Their portion shall not be baked leavened”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), <b>and Reish Lakish said</b> that both the handful brought on the altar <b>and even the</b> priest’s <b>portion shall not be baked leavened? Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should be understood as saying: One might have thought that if <b>he wishes he may eat it unleavened,</b> and if <b>he wishes he may eat it</b> even if it was prepared by being <b>boiled.</b> Therefore, the verse taught that one must eat it unleavened. Understood in this way, this clause of the <i>baraita</i> is also consistent with Rav Yitzḥak’s opinion.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>this</b> possibility of eating the meal-offering <b>boiled, what are the circumstances,</b> i.e., how is it classified? <b>If it is</b> considered to be <b>unleavened</b> because it is presumed that the flour never managed to rise before it was cooked, <b>then it is unleavened</b> and there is no reason to prohibit its use; <b>and if it is not</b> considered to be <b>unleavened</b> because it is presumed that the flour managed to rise before it was cooked, then it is certainly disqualified from use because <b>the Merciful One states</b> that the offering must be <b>“unleavened”</b> (Leviticus 10:12). How, then, could one ever have questioned whether it is permitted to eat the meal-offering if it was boiled?

### Part 10
The Gemara explains: <b>No; actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that the boiled meal-offering <b>is</b> considered to be <b>unleavened, and</b> nevertheless it is disqualified because it is <b>for this</b> very reason that <b>the verse repeated</b> the requirement that it be unleavened, in order <b>to invalidate</b> a meal-offering that was boiled.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if boiled flour is invalid as a meal offering, then with regard to this statement <b>that we said</b> that <b>boiled</b> flour <b>is unleavened, for what <i>halakha</i></b> is it relevant? The Gemara answers: It is <b>to say that a person fulfills his obligation with it on Passover.</b> This is because <b>even though he initially boiled it, since he subsequently baked it in an oven, it is called “bread of affliction”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3), <b>and</b> therefore <b>a person fulfills his obligation with it on Passover.</b>

### Part 12
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with his <i>yevama</i> is like</b> any <b>one of the</b> other <b>brothers with respect to</b> the <b>inheritance</b> of the deceased brother’s estate, i.e., each of the brothers takes an equal share of the inheritance. <b>And if there is a father</b> of the deceased, who is still alive, <b>the property</b> of the deceased <b>belongs to the father. One who consummates</b> levirate marriage with <b>his <i>yevama</i></b> thereby <b>acquires his</b> deceased <b>brother’s property</b> solely for himself. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: In either</b> case, whether he consummated the levirate marriage or performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>if there is a father</b> who is still alive, <b>the property belongs to the father.</b>

### Part 13
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks with regard to the opening clause of the mishna: The fact that one who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> does not gain any special rights to the inheritance of the deceased brother <b>is obvious;</b> why did the mishna teach it? The Gemara answers: <b>It could enter your mind to say</b> that the <b><i>ḥalitza</i> takes the place of the levirate marriage and</b> therefore the brother who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>should take all the property</b> in the same way as one who consummates the levirate marriage. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that the mishna’s point is to teach that by performing <i>ḥalitza</i> one is not afforded any additional rights to the inheritance, why is the mishna formulated as: <b>He is like</b> any <b>one of the</b> other <b>brothers,</b> placing the emphasis on what he gains? <b>It should have</b> instead taught: <b>He is</b> still <b>only like one of the</b> other <b>brothers,</b> which would emphasize the mishna’s point that by performing <i>ḥalitza</i> he does not gain any additional rights.

### Part 15
<b>Rather,</b> the mishna needs to teach the opening clause in this manner because <b>it could enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> by performing <i>ḥalitza</i> with his <i>yevama</i> <b>he caused her to forfeit</b> the possibility of consummating the <b>levirate marriage, he should be penalized</b> and should forfeit any entitlement to his brother’s property. Therefore the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so.

### Part 16
§ The mishna states: <b>If there is a father</b> of the deceased, who is still alive, the property of the deceased belongs to the father. The Gemara explains: <b>As the Master said</b> with regard to the laws of inheritance (<i>Bava Batra</i> 115a): <b>A father</b> of the deceased <b>takes precedence over all</b> the father’s <b>descendants.</b> Therefore, since the father is still alive, the brothers do not inherit at all.

### Part 17
The mishna states: <b>One who consummates</b> levirate marriage with his <i>yevama</i> thereby acquires his deceased brother’s property. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“He shall succeed in the name of his</b> dead <b>brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:6), <b>and he has succeeded</b> him by marrying his wife; consequently, he succeeds him by acquiring his property as well.

### Part 18
§ The mishna continues by citing an opposing opinion. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In either case, whether he consummated levirate marriage or performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, if there is a father who is still alive, the property belongs to the father. The Gemara cites a ruling on this dispute: <b>Ulla said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. And similarly, Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 19
<b>And Ulla said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa</b> who said: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda? As it is written: “And it shall be that the firstborn that she bears</b> shall succeed in the name of his dead brother” (Deuteronomy 25:6). The term “firstborn” is understood to be a reference to the <i>yavam</i>. By referring to him in this way the Torah indicates that his rights to his brother’s estate are <b>like</b> those of <b>a firstborn</b> child’s rights to his father’s estate: <b>Just as a firstborn has no</b> rights to any of his father’s estate <b>during the lifetime of the father,</b> and he may take his double portion only upon the father’s death, <b>so too, this</b> <i>yavam</i> <b>as well has no</b> rights to any of his brother’s estate <b>during the lifetime of the father.</b>

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> there is truly a comparison between the <i>yavam</i> who consummated the levirate marriage and a firstborn, then one should also say that <b>just as the firstborn takes a double portion</b> of his father’s estate <b>after the death of the father, so too, this</b> <i>yavam</i> <b>should</b> become entitled to <b>take a double portion</b> of the father’s estate <b>after the father’s death,</b> i.e., the portion due to him as a son, and that portion that would have been awarded to his brother. However, this is not the case; if the <i>yavam</i> is not actually the father’s firstborn then he receives only an equal portion of the inheritance together with the other brothers.

### Part 21
The Gemara explains: <b>Is it written</b> in the Torah: <b>He shall succeed in the name of his father?</b> No, <b>it is written: “He shall succeed in the name of his dead brother,”</b> which indicates that he succeeds his brother <b>but not in the name of his father,</b> i.e., the Torah never granted him any special entitlement to his father’s estate, and so he should not receive a double portion of it.

### Part 22
The Gemara asks: Since Rabbi Yehuda holds that the <i>halakha</i> that the <i>yavam</i> inherits from his brother, which is stated in the verses describing levirate marriage, applies only when the father is no longer alive, perhaps the other <i>halakhot</i> in those verses also apply only when the father is no longer alive, and accordingly one should <b>say: When there is no father</b> who is still alive, which means <b>that</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>takes the inheritance,</b> only then <b>should the mitzva of levirate marriage apply,</b> but <b>when there is a father</b> who is still alive, which means <b>that</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>does not take the inheritance,</b> in that case <b>the mitzva of levirate marriage should not apply.</b>

### Part 23
The Gemara rejects the possibility of saying this: <b>Does the Merciful One make</b> the mitzva of <b>levirate marriage dependent upon inheritance?</b> Certainly not; rather, in all cases the <i>yavam</i> <b>should consummate the levirate marriage, and</b> then <b>if there is an inheritance</b> to which he is entitled, <b>he takes</b> it, <b>and if not, he does not take</b> it.

### Part 24
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina Kara,</b> the Bible expert, <b>was sitting before Rabbi Yannai, and he was sitting and saying:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Rabbi Yannai <b>said to him: Leave</b> the study hall <b>and recite your verses outside,</b> as you are incorrect in your ruling; in fact, the <b><i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 25
In another incident, <b>a <i>tanna</i></b> who would recite <i>baraitot</i> in the study hall <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. Rav Naḥman said to him: But</b> then it follows that <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion is the <i>halakha</i>? It is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> The Gemara asks: But this fact <b>is obvious,</b> as in a dispute between <b>one</b> individual Sage <b>and many</b> other Sages, the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is always decided in accordance with the opinion of <b>the many.</b>

### Part 26
The <i>tanna</i> <b>said to him:</b> Are you saying that this statement in the <i>baraita</i> is unnecessary and so <b>I should remove that</b> ruling from the <i>baraita</i> when I recite it in the future? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: No,</b> do not remove it, as although the statement is unnecessary, it is correct. Rav Naḥman explained further: It must be that originally the <i>baraita</i> that <b>you were taught</b> stated: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, and <b>that</b> ruling <b>was difficult for you</b> because you knew that the <i>halakha</i> is always decided in accordance with many, <b>and</b> so <b>you reversed</b> the statement of the <i>baraita</i> to say, as you presently recited it, that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>And</b> with regard to the manner in <b>which you reversed it, you reversed it well,</b> and therefore you should leave it in its current form.

### Part 27
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with his <i>yevama</i>,</b> by rabbinic decree it is as though she had been married to him and then he divorced her. Consequently, <b>he is forbidden</b> to engage in relations <b>with her relatives and she is forbidden</b> to engage in relations <b>with his relatives.</b>
