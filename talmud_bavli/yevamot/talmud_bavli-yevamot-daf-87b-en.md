### Part 1
was <b>empty, and now</b> her <b>body</b> is <b>full</b> with the child, and therefore she is no longer “as in her youth.” <b>But</b> in a situation where <b>“she has no child,” when at the outset</b> her <b>body</b> was <b>empty and now</b> her <b>body</b> is also <b>empty,</b> as she has given birth, you might <b>say</b> that she should <b>not</b> be disqualified. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to write both verses.

### Part 2
Parenthetically, the Gemara lists terms signifying the following discussions, to serve as <b>a mnemonic</b> device: <b>Said to him, we should not make, by death, we should make and not make, by a child, <i>yavam</i> and <i>teruma</i>, levirate marriage and <i>teruma</i>.</b> This list of terms, taken from the introductions or key phrases in each of the ensuing discussions, is the <b>mnemonic.</b>

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yehuda from De’iskarta said to Rava,</b> in continuation of the discussion of the <i>baraita</i>: Should <b>we not make the</b> <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>dead</b> children <b>like the</b> <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>living</b> children <b>with regard to levirate marriage by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, and say: <b>And if in a place where</b> the Torah <b>made</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a child from the first</b> husband <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a child from the second</b> husband, <b>to disqualify her from <i>teruma</i>,</b> for as long as she has a child who is not a priest she is prohibited from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, the Torah nevertheless <b>did not make dead</b> children <b>like living</b> ones; therefore, in a <b>place where</b> the Torah <b>did not make a child from the first</b> husband <b>like a child from the second to exempt her from levirate marriage, is it not right that we should not make the dead like the living?</b> Why, then, is a <i>yevama</i> exempt from levirate marriage if her late husband’s only child dies?

### Part 4
<b>The verse states: “Her ways are the ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace”</b> (Proverbs 3:17). In other words, since the ways of Torah are those of pleasantness, the Torah would not obligate a woman who has married in the meantime to subsequently perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, as this might demean her in her husband’s eyes.

### Part 5
The Gemara inquires: <b>And let us make</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>dead</b> children <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>living</b> ones <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>, from an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if in a place where</b> the Torah <b>did not make a child from the first</b> husband <b>like a child from the second to exempt her from levirate marriage,</b> it nevertheless <b>made the living like the dead,</b> as a woman whose husband died and left a child is exempt from levirate marriage even if that child subsequently dies; then, in <b>a place where</b> the Torah <b>made a child from the first like a child from the second to disqualify her from <i>teruma</i>, is it not right that we should make the living like the dead?</b> The Gemara responds: Therefore, <b>the verse states “and she have no child,</b> she is returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth” (Leviticus 22:13), <b>and</b> here <b>she does not</b> currently <b>have</b> children.

### Part 6
The Gemara further suggests: <b>And let us make</b> her <b>child from the first</b> husband <b>like</b> her <b>child from the second</b> one <b>with regard to levirate marriage,</b> again <b>from an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if in a place where</b> the Torah <b>did not make the living like the dead with regard to <i>teruma</i>,</b> it still <b>made a child from the first</b> husband <b>like a child from the second,</b> then in <b>a place where it made the living like the dead, with regard to levirate marriage, is it not right that we should make a child from the first</b> husband <b>like a child from the second,</b> and thereby exempt her from levirate marriage? The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> about levirate marriage: <b>“And he has no child”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), <b>and</b> in fact <b>he had none</b> at the time of his death.

### Part 7
The Gemara offers another possibility: <b>And should we make a child from the first</b> husband <b>not like a child from the second</b> one <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>, from an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If in a place where</b> the Torah <b>made the living like the dead to exempt her from levirate marriage,</b> it still <b>did not make a child from the first</b> husband <b>like a child from the second,</b> then in <b>a place where</b> the Torah <b>did not make the living like the dead, with regard to <i>teruma</i>, is it not right that we should not make</b> the <b>child from the first</b> husband <b>like</b> the <b>child from the second?</b> The Gemara responds: Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And <b>she have no</b> child,” <b>but</b> in fact this woman <b>has</b> children.
