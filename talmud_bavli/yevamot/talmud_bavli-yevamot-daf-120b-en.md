### Part 1
<b>is an unambiguous distinguishing mark</b> that <b>they disagree.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer ben Mahavai, <b>holds</b> that a mole <b>is an unambiguous distinguishing mark</b> and may be relied upon by Torah law. Consequently, if a man’s corpse was identified in this manner, his wife may remarry. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the anonymous first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that a mole <b>is not an unambiguous distinguishing mark.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>According to the</b> first <b>version, that Rava said</b> that <b>distinguishing marks are</b> recognized as valid identification <b>by Torah</b> law, there is a question: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in the mishna: <b>Although there are distinguishing marks on his body and his personal belongings,</b> one may not rely on these as identification, implying that distinguishing marks are not valid identification by Torah law?

### Part 3
The Gemara answers: The mishna’s intent is that ordinary distinguishing marks on <b>one’s body,</b> which constitute only weak evidence to a person’s identity, e.g., <b>that he was tall or short,</b> are not valid identification. Additionally, one cannot rely upon distinguishing marks on his <b>personal belongings, as we are concerned about borrowing,</b> i.e., perhaps the deceased had borrowed the clothes he was wearing from someone else. The Gemara asks: <b>But if we are concerned about borrowing,</b> then, with regard to returning lost property, <b>how can we return a donkey based</b> solely <b>upon distinguishing marks on the saddle?</b> Why don’t we consider the possibility that the saddle was borrowed?

### Part 4
The Gemara answers: <b>People do not</b> normally <b>borrow a saddle because it bruises the donkey,</b> as the saddle must fit exactly to the donkey’s measurements. The Gemara raises further objections based upon the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier: <b>If he found</b> the lost bill of divorce <b>tied to a purse, or a money bag, or a ring,</b> he may rely upon the distinguishing marks on those items and deliver the bill of divorce to the woman. But <b>how can we return it</b> and not be concerned that these belongings may have been lent to someone else whose bill of divorce is tied to them?

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: The case of the <b>ring</b> is referring to a signet ring, which one does not lend, <b>because he is concerned about forgery,</b> i.e., that the borrower might use it to forge his consent on documents without his knowledge. With regard to <b>a purse or a money bag, people consider it a bad omen</b> to lend them out <b>and do not lend</b> them to others. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that the reason not to permit a woman to remarry and not to accept that her husband is dead based upon the distinguishing marks found on <b>his personal belongings</b> is that the distinguishing marks referred to are only general ones, e.g., he wore <b>white or red</b> clothing, but they are not unambiguous distinguishing marks.

### Part 6
§ We learned in the mishna: <b>And even if one saw him cut open [<i>meguyyad</i>]</b> and severely wounded, one may not testify that he died. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> a person who is <b>cut open is</b> fit <b>to live</b> for much time afterward? The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from what was taught in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 1:6): A dead <b>person renders</b> other people and objects <b>impure only when his soul</b> actually <b>departs, even if he is cut open</b> and severely wounded, <b>and even if he is</b> clearly <b>dying.</b> From this we may deduce that <b>he does not</b> yet <b>render</b> others <b>ritually impure,</b> as he still has some life in him, <b>but he is not</b> fit <b>to live</b> for much time afterward.

### Part 7
<b>Abaye said:</b> The contradiction raised is <b>not difficult: This</b> mishna here <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> while <b>that</b> mishna from tractate <i>Oholot</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may testify about</b> the death of a person who is <b>cut open, but one may not testify about a crucified person. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Even concerning</b> a person who is <b>cut open, one may not testify</b> that he is dead <b>because</b> his wound <b>can be scorched,</b> and this cauterization of the wound may stop the flow of blood <b>and</b> allow him to <b>survive.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara challenges this: <b>But can you establish</b> the mishna to be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar? Isn’t it taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> (121a): <b>An incident</b> occurred <b>in Asya in which they lowered a certain</b> man <b>into the sea</b> on a rope, <b>and</b> when they pulled the rope back to land <b>only his leg came up in their hands.</b> They were not certain whether he was alive or dead. <b>The Sages said:</b> If his leg was cut <b>from the knee and above,</b> his wife <b>may marry,</b> as he would not survive such a wound; if his leg was cut only <b>from the knee and below, she may not marry.</b> This indicates that someone cut open in the first manner is assumed to be dead. If this follows Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar’s opinion, why doesn’t it say that there is a concern that he might be alive even if the leg was cut from the knee and above?

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: <b>Water is different, as it aggravates the wound.</b> Since he was in the water, it can be assumed that such a wound will certainly lead to death.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥanna say: I myself saw an Arab who took his sword [<i>safseira</i>] and cut open his camel, and</b> the camel died so quickly that it <b>could not</b> even <b>cease its braying</b> before it died? This indicates that a living being that is cut open has no chance of surviving. <b>Abaye said: That</b> camel <b>was emaciated</b> and weak, causing it to die immediately, but a normal camel would not have died so quickly.

### Part 11
<b>Rava said</b> a different resolution to the apparent contradiction between the mishna here and the mishna in tractate <i>Oholot</i>: The mishna here is referring to a case where the man was cut open <b>with a white-hot knife, and everyone agrees</b> that one may not testify to the death of a person wounded in such a manner, as the wound would close due to the heat.

### Part 12
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>Or</b> even if one saw that a wild <b>animal was eating</b> parts of him, one may not testify that he died. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> where the animal was eating <b>from a place</b> on his body <b>that does not</b> cause <b>his soul to depart,</b> i.e., does not inevitably lead to death, such as his hand or foot. <b>But</b> if the animal was eating <b>from a place</b> on his body <b>that does</b> cause <b>his soul to depart, one may testify</b> to his death.

### Part 13
<b>And Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: If</b> someone <b>cut</b> a man’s <b>two</b> passageways, the trachea and the esophagus, <b>or most of</b> the way through the <b>two</b> passageways, <b>and</b> the maimed person <b>fled, one may testify</b> to his death.

### Part 14
The Gemara challenges that conclusion: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Shmuel said: If</b> someone <b>cut</b> a man’s <b>two</b> passageways, <b>or most of</b> the way through the <b>two</b> passageways, <b>and</b> the maimed person <b>gestured and</b> thereby <b>communicated: Write a bill of divorce for my wife, then these</b> onlookers <b>should write</b> it <b>and deliver</b> it to her. Since only a living person may give a bill of divorce, this indicates that the maimed man is considered alive. The Gemara answers: <b>He is</b> still <b>alive</b> at the moment, <b>but he will eventually die</b> from the wound. Consequently, he may appoint an agent to deliver a bill of divorce to his wife, but after a while one may testify that he is dead.

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that such a wound is definitely fatal, one who unintentionally wounds another in this manner <b>should be exiled on his account,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of one who unintentionally kills another. <b>Why is</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> one unintentionally <b>cut</b> the <b>two</b> passageways of another person, <b>or most of</b> the thickness of <b>the two, he is not exiled?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>But it was stated with regard to</b> that <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rav Hoshaya said: We are concerned that perhaps the wind aggravated his</b> condition and actually caused his death, in which case the perpetrator is not culpable for the death and should not be exiled. <b>Alternatively, perhaps he,</b> the maimed person,
