### Part 1
<b>Let her stay with him,</b> as she is permitted <b>whichever way you</b> look at it: <b>If she is acquired, then she is</b> fully <b>acquired; and if she is not acquired</b> at all, <b>then she is merely an unrelated</b> woman. If the marriage to the deceased brother was not a true marriage, there is no reason for her to be forbidden to him.

### Part 2
<b>And if you would say</b> that the same question could be asked if you claim that it is the minor whose acquisition is uncertain: <b>Why should</b> she <b>wait until she reaches majority and performs <i>ḥalitza</i>? Let her stay with him: If she is acquired, then she is</b> fully <b>acquired;</b> and <b>if she is not acquired</b> at all, <b>then she is merely an unrelated</b> woman. However, you cannot say that because, <b>if that is so, how shall the deaf-mute be released?</b> As a deaf-mute, she cannot perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, and he cannot consummate the levirate marriage with her since the minor may be considered to be acquired by him, in which case the deaf-mute would be disqualified as the rival wife of his <i>yevama</i>. Rav’s suggestion was meant to find a way for both of them to be able to remarry, and that is only possible if the minor and deaf-mute’s statuses are as Rav Ḥisda argues.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Sheshet said: Indeed, this too stands to reason,</b> i.e., only the way <b>that Rav Ḥisda explained</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav</b> is reasonable.

### Part 4
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> about the following case: <b>Two brothers married two orphaned sisters,</b> one of them <b>a minor and</b> one of them <b>a deaf-mute.</b> If <b>the husband of the minor dies</b> and she happens before the husband of the deaf-mute for levirate marriage, <b>the deaf-mute must be released by means of a bill of divorce</b> due to her sister’s levirate bond, <b>and the minor must wait until she reaches majority and perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b>

### Part 5
<b>If the deaf-mute’s husband dies, the minor must be released by means of a bill of divorce and the deaf-mute is forbidden forever.</b> He must divorce the minor because of the levirate bond with her sister. He may not consummate the levirate marriage with the deaf-mute because she is his ex-wife’s sister; and he cannot perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with her, because she is not capable of performing <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>And if he</b> transgresses and <b>consummates</b> the levirate marriage <b>with the deaf-mute, he gives her a bill of divorce</b> afterward, <b>and she is</b> thereby <b>released.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Granted,</b> this argument works <b>if you say that the deaf-mute is partially acquired,</b> and <b>the minor is either acquired or not acquired; it is due to that</b> reason <b>that if he</b> transgresses and <b>consummates</b> the levirate marriage <b>with the deaf-mute, he gives her a bill of divorce and she is released. You would say</b> she is released <b>whichever way you</b> look at it: <b>If the minor is</b> fully <b>acquired</b> by her husband, <b>then the deaf-mute is released due to</b> her status as <b>the sister of his wife,</b> who is a forbidden relative and as such is entirely exempt from levirate marriage. <b>And if the minor is not acquired at all, then he may rightly consummate the levirate marriage</b> and afterward divorce her.

### Part 7
<b>But if you say that the deaf-mute is either acquired or not acquired,</b> i.e., the status of a marriage with a deaf-mute is uncertain, <b>while the minor is partially acquired,</b> then <b>when he</b> transgresses and <b>has intercourse with the deaf-mute, why should he give her a bill of divorce and</b> she thereby <b>be released? It is an invalid sexual act,</b> as the minor is partially acquired, which disqualifies her sister from levirate marriage. <b>And an invalid sexual act does not exempt her,</b> i.e., does not constitute full consummation of the levirate marriage, making it possible for him to divorce her. She still requires <i>ḥalitza</i>, and a deaf-mute cannot perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. Therefore it must be, as Rav Ḥisda suggested, that the deaf-mute is partially acquired while it is uncertain whether the minor is acquired or not.

### Part 8
The Gemara rejects the conclusion that the <i>baraita</i> provides evidence for Rav Ḥisda’s explanation, as it is possible to say: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya, who said: An invalid sexual act</b> also <b>exempts</b> a woman <b>from <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> one accepts the suggestion that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya, say the latter clause</b> of this same <i>baraita</i>: Consider the case of <b>one who was married</b> to <b>two orphans, a minor and a deaf-mute, and he died. If the <i>yavam</i> had intercourse with the minor and then had intercourse with the deaf-mute, or if one of his brothers had intercourse with the deaf-mute</b> after the first brother engaged in intercourse with the minor, <b>they are both forbidden to</b> the first brother. <b>How</b> can their situation <b>be rectified? The deaf-mute must be released with a bill of divorce, and the minor must wait until she reaches majority and</b> then <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Granted,</b> this <i>halakha</i> makes sense <b>if you say</b> that <b>a deaf-mute is partially acquired,</b> meaning that she was never fully acquired in the first place; that <b>a minor is either acquired or not acquired; and</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance</b> with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> who state that an invalid sexual act does not exempt a woman from <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>For these</b> reasons, <b>the minor must wait until she reaches majority and</b> then <b>perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.</b> The Sages decreed that she must perform <i>ḥalitza</i> no matter what, <b>as perhaps he may precipitately have intercourse with the deaf-mute first, so that the</b> subsequent <b>intercourse with the minor is considered an invalid sexual act,</b> because he is already partially married to her rival wife. However, since the deaf-mute is only partially acquired, her levirate marriage does not exempt the minor and the minor still must perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.

### Part 11
<b>But if you say it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya,</b> and also that the status of a deaf-mute’s marriage is uncertain while the status of the minor is that she is partially acquired, there is no explanation why the minor must perform <i>ḥalitza</i> when she reaches majority, as <b>he said</b> that <b>an invalid sexual act exempts her.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rather, conclude from</b> this reasoning that this <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from it.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav Ashi said: One may learn also from the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>that it is</b> in accordance with <b>the</b> opinion of the <b>Rabbis, as it teaches: If he</b> transgresses and <b>consummates</b> the levirate marriage <b>with the</b> sister, who is <b>a deaf-mute, he gives her a bill of divorce</b> afterward, <b>and she is</b> thereby <b>released. And it does not teach: If he consummates</b> the levirate marriage <b>with the minor, he gives her a bill of divorce and she is released.</b> This is presumably because consummation of levirate marriage with the minor is an invalid sexual act, as her deaf-mute sister is partially married to the <i>yavam</i>. Even if he does engage in intercourse with her, she will still require <i>ḥalitza</i>.

### Part 14
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>If it is due to that</b> reason, <b>there is no</b> conclusive <b>argument,</b> as one may say that for <b>the deaf-mute, whose</b> situation <b>has no rectification that is permitted</b> because she cannot perform <i>ḥalitza</i>, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches a prohibited rectification;</b> but for <b>the minor, whose</b> situation <b>has a permitted rectification,</b> in that she can perform <i>ḥalitza</i> after she reaches majority, the <i>baraita</i> <b>does not teach a prohibited rectification.</b>

### Part 15
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>a man was married to two minor orphans and he died, and a <i>yavam</i> engaged in intercourse with the first</b> of them to consummate the levirate marriage, <b>and then engaged in intercourse with the second, or if his brother</b> who is also their <i>yavam</i> <b>engaged in intercourse with the second,</b>
