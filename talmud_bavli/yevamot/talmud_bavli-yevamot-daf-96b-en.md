### Part 1
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a boy <b>aged nine years and one day had</b> sexual <b>relations with his <i>yevama</i>, and afterward his brother, who is</b> also <b>nine years and one day old, had relations with her,</b> the second brother <b>disqualifies</b> her <b>to</b> the first one. <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> he does <b>not disqualify</b> her. If a minor <b>aged nine years and one day had relations with his <i>yevama</i>, and afterward</b> that same boy <b>had relations with her rival wife,</b> he thereby <b>disqualifies her to himself,</b> and both women are now forbidden to him. <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> he does <b>not disqualify</b> her.

### Part 2
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon said to the Rabbis: If</b> the <b>first sexual act</b> of a nine-year-old is considered a proper act of <b>sexual relations,</b> then the <b>second act is not an act</b> of consequence, just as the intercourse of one adult <i>yavam</i> after that of another adult <i>yavam</i> is of no effect. <b>And if</b> you say that the <b>first sexual act is not</b> considered <b>a sexual act,</b> the <b>second act</b> of himself or his brother <b>is also not a sexual act.</b> However, the Rabbis maintain that as the intercourse of a nine-year-old is like a levirate betrothal, one sexual act can take effect after another.

### Part 3
The Gemara comments that according to this explanation, <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>ben Azzai. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>ben Azzai says: There is levirate betrothal after levirate betrothal</b> in a case <b>of two <i>yevamin</i> and one <i>yevama</i>.</b> In other words, if they both performed levirate betrothal with her, their actions are effective and she is forbidden to them both. The reason is that she has ties to each of the two men, which means that each levirate betrothal is effective in forbidding the other man.

### Part 4
<b>But there is no levirate betrothal after a levirate betrothal</b> in a case <b>of two <i>yevamot</i> and one <i>yavam</i>,</b> as the <i>yavam</i> did not have a full-fledged levirate bond with both of them. Therefore, if he performs a levirate betrothal with one of them, he has completed the bond. In contrast, the conclusion of the mishna is that the sexual relations of a nine-year-old with two <i>yevamot</i> is effective, and as the intercourse of a boy of this age is considered like a levirate betrothal the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna evidently maintains that there is levirate betrothal after levirate betrothal even in a case of one <i>yavam</i>.

### Part 5
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a boy <b>aged nine years and one day had relations with his <i>yevama</i> and died,</b> that <i>yevama</i> <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i> and may not enter into levirate marriage.</b> If the minor <b>married a woman</b> in a regular manner <b>and died, she is exempt</b> from levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>, as by Torah law a minor cannot marry. If a boy <b>aged nine years and one day had relations with his <i>yevama</i>, and after he matured he married a different woman and</b> then <b>died</b> childless, <b>if he did not</b> carnally <b>know the first</b> woman <b>after he matured,</b> but only when he was a minor, <b>the first one performs <i>ḥalitza</i> and may not enter into levirate marriage,</b> as she is in essence a <i>yevama</i> who had relations with a minor, <b>and the second</b> woman <b>either performs <i>ḥalitza</i> or enters into levirate marriage,</b> as she is his full-fledged wife.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The brother <b>consummates levirate marriage with whichever</b> woman <b>he chooses, and performs <i>ḥalitza</i> with the second one.</b> The mishna comments: This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>both</b> for a boy <b>who is nine years and one day old, and also</b> for one <b>who is twenty</b> years <b>old who has not developed two</b> pubic <b>hairs.</b> He has the status of a nine-year-old boy in this regard, as his intercourse is not considered a proper act of intercourse.

### Part 7
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> If a brother performed levirate betrothal with a <i>yevama</i> and died, she has a levirate bond in relation to the remaining brothers from two deceased brothers. <b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>that which the Rabbis said,</b> that when <b>the bond of two <i>yevamin</i></b> exists, <b>she performs <i>ḥalitza</i> and she does not enter into levirate marriage, you should not say</b> that <b>this</b> applies only <b>when there is a rival wife, as there is</b> reason <b>to decree due to a rival wife.</b> The suggestion is that as the rival wife can enter into levirate marriage by Torah law, if the woman who performed levirate betrothal with the second brother was also permitted to enter into levirate marriage, people might mistakenly permit levirate marriage to two rival wives from the same family.

### Part 8
The proof that this is not the case is <b>that here,</b> in the first clause of the mishna, <b>there is no rival wife,</b> as it is referring to one woman, which means that this <i>yevama</i> who had relations with the nine-year-old is tied by the bonds of both her first husband and the underage <i>yavam</i>, whose intercourse is like levirate betrothal, and even so <b>she performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b> but <b>she does not enter into levirate marriage.</b>

### Part 9
§ The mishna teaches that if a nine-year-old boy <b>married a woman and died,</b> she is exempt from levirate marriage and <i>ḥalitza</i>. The Gemara comments: <b>We</b> already <b>learned this, as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an imbecile and a minor who married</b> women <b>and died, their wives are exempt from <i>ḥalitza</i> and from levirate marriage,</b> as the marriage of a minor or an imbecile is of no account.

### Part 10
§ The mishna further teaches the case of <b>a nine-year-old</b> boy who had relations with his <i>yevama</i> and <b>after he matured</b> married another woman. The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> the Sages at least <b>establish the sexual relations of a nine-year-old</b> to be <b>like the levirate betrothal of an adult, and</b> it would therefore <b>override</b> the requirement of the <b>rival wife to</b> enter into <b>levirate marriage,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of the rival wife of a woman who has the bond of two <i>yevamin</i>. <b>Rav said: They did not establish the intercourse of a nine-year-old</b> to be <b>like the levirate betrothal of an adult</b> in all regards, <b>and Shmuel said: They certainly did. And similarly, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They certainly did.</b>

### Part 11
If so, the question remains: <b>And let them establish</b> the sexual relations of a nine-year-old to be considered like levirate betrothal. Why is he able to perform levirate marriage with her rival wife? The Gemara answers: This <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. This <i>tanna</i></b> who discusses the case <b>of four brothers,</b> one of whom died, followed by the brother who performed levirate betrothal with the <i>yevama</i> (31b), he maintains that the <i>yevama</i> and her rival wife may not perform levirate marriage with one of the surviving brothers. The reason is that <b>he</b> maintains that the Sages <b>decreed</b> that a woman who has the bond of two deceased brothers may not perform levirate marriage <b>due to a rival wife.</b> They must both perform <i>ḥalitza</i> so that people will not say that two <i>yevamot</i> from one family can perform levirate marriage.

### Part 12
<b>And</b> that <i>tanna</i> <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to an adult</b> brother who performed levirate marriage, <b>and the same is true of a minor</b> who had relations with her. <b>And</b> the reason <b>that he stated</b> the case of <b>an adult</b> in particular is <b>because</b> he was <b>referring to an adult.</b>

### Part 13
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>this <i>tanna</i>, of</b> the mishna <b>here, holds that they established</b> the sexual relations of a minor entirely like the levirate betrothal of an adult, <b>and he</b> maintains that the Sages <b>did not decree</b> that a woman who has the bond of two deceased brothers may not perform levirate marriage <b>due to</b> the case of <b>a rival wife. And he taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a minor, and the same is true of an adult. And</b> the reason <b>that he stated</b> the case of <b>a minor</b> in particular is <b>because</b> he was <b>referring to a minor.</b>

### Part 14
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar went</b> and <b>said this <i>halakha</i></b> in <b>the study hall, but he did not state it in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> Instead, he issued the <i>halakha</i> without attribution. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan heard</b> that Rabbi Elazar omitted mention of his name <b>and became angry</b> with him. <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi visited</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, to placate him so that he would not be annoyed with his beloved disciple. <b>They said to him: Wasn’t there an incident in the synagogue of Tiberias involving a bolt</b> that secures a door in place and <b>that has</b> a thick <b>knob [<i>gelustera</i>] at its end?</b> The question was whether it may be moved on Shabbat as a vessel, or whether it is considered <i>muktze</i> as raw material.

### Part 15
And it was stated <b>that Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yosei argued over</b> this case <b>until</b> they became so upset with each other <b>that they tore a Torah scroll in their anger.</b> The Gemara interrupts this account to clarify exactly what happened: <b>Tore?</b> Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that such great Sages would intentionally tear a Torah scroll? <b>Rather,</b> you must <b>say that a Torah scroll was torn through their anger.</b> In the heat of their debate they pulled the scroll from one side to another until it tore. <b>And Rabbi Yosei ben Kisma,</b> who <b>was there</b> at the time, <b>said: I would be surprised if this synagogue does not become</b> a place of <b>idolatrous worship.</b> This unfortunate event is a sign that this place is unsuitable for a synagogue. <b>And</b> indeed <b>this</b> eventually <b>occurred.</b>

### Part 16
Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi cited this <i>baraita</i> to hint to Rabbi Yoḥanan how careful one must be to avoid anger. However, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>grew even angrier, saying:</b> You are <b>even</b> making us <b>colleagues</b> now? Those two Sages were peers, whereas Rabbi Elazar is merely my student.

### Part 17
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi visited</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan and <b>said to him:</b> The verse states: <b>“As God commanded His servant Moses, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua, he left nothing undone of all that the Lord commanded Moses”</b> (Joshua 11:15). <b>Now did Joshua, with regard to every matter that he said, say to</b> the Jews: <b>Thus Moses said to me? Rather, Joshua</b> would <b>sit and teach</b> Torah <b>without attributing</b> his statements, <b>and everyone would know that it was</b> from <b>the Torah of Moses. So too, your disciple Rabbi Elazar sits and teaches without attribution, and everyone knows that</b> his teaching <b>is</b> from <b>your</b> instruction. Hearing this, Rabbi Yoḥanan was appeased.

### Part 18
Later, after calming down, <b>he said to</b> Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi: <b>Why don’t you know how to appease me like our colleague ben Idi?</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan, what is the reason</b> that <b>he was so angry</b> about this matter? The Gemara answers that this is <b>as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I will dwell in Your tent in worlds”</b> (Psalms 61:5), literally, forever? <b>And is it possible for a person to live in two worlds</b> simultaneously? <b>Rather, David said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, let it be Your will</b>
