### Part 1
we would have said that the <i>halakha</i> is stringent in this case <b>because they are prohibited by any amount,</b> i.e., a creeping animal or insect is prohibited on pain of lashes even if it is very small, provided that it is a whole creature (<i>Tosafot</i>). <b>However,</b> with regard to eating <b>blood, which</b> is not a Torah prohibition <b>unless there is</b> at least the volume of <b>a quarter</b><i>-log</i>, one might <b>say</b> that there is <b>no</b> prohibition against directly feeding minors, as this prohibition is more lenient. <b>And</b> had the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught us</b> only the case of <b>blood,</b> we would have said that they were stringent with regard to blood <b>because there is</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i></b> for eating blood. <b>However, for creeping animals,</b> whose consumption does not entail <i>karet</i>, one might <b>say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> does <b>not</b> apply.

### Part 2
<b>And</b> had the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught us</b> only <b>these two</b> cases, we would have said it is <b>because their prohibitions apply equally to all</b> Jews. <b>However,</b> in the case of <b>ritual impurity,</b> which is a mitzva for priests alone, one might <b>say</b> that there is <b>no</b> prohibition against directly rendering minors ritually impure. <b>And</b> had the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught us</b> only the case of <b>ritual impurity,</b> we would have said that the case of <b>priests is different</b> and more stringent, <b>because</b> the Torah <b>includes</b> extra mitzvot <b>for them. However,</b> with regard to <b>these</b> prohibitions of creeping animals and blood, one might <b>say</b> that there is <b>no</b> prohibition against directly feeding minors. Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> to state all these cases.

### Part 3
§ The Gemara cites another relevant source with regard to a minor who eats the meat of unslaughtered animals. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> If <b>two brothers, one</b> of whom is <b>a deaf-mute and</b> the other <b>one</b> halakhically <b>competent,</b> were <b>married to two</b> halakhically <b>competent sisters, and the deaf-mute married to the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> sister <b>died, what should the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> brother <b>married to the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> sister <b>do?</b> His brother’s wife is <b>released</b> without levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i>, <b>due to</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a wife’s sister.</b>

### Part 4
If <b>the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> brother <b>married to the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> sister <b>died, what should the deaf-mute</b> brother <b>married to the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> sister <b>do? He divorces his wife with a bill of divorce,</b> which is as valid as their original marriage. <b>And his brother’s wife is forbidden</b> to him <b>forever.</b> He must divorce his wife, as the levirate bond applies by Torah law, whereas his marriage is valid by rabbinic law. However, in practice he is unable to consummate levirate marriage with the <i>yevama</i> or perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with her.

### Part 5
The Gemara inquires: <b>Why</b> should <b>he divorce his wife with a bill of divorce? Let her</b> continue to <b>live with him,</b> as a deaf-mute <b>is</b> in the same category <b>as a minor who eats</b> the meat of <b>unslaughtered animals,</b> for he is not legally competent. Consequently, even if he were to engage in sexual relations with her, this would not be considered a transgression. The Gemara answers: If the matter concerned the deaf-mute alone, this would be the case. However, here he must divorce her <b>due to the prohibition</b> that applies to <b>her,</b> as his wife is legally competent, and just as she is forbidden to him, he is also forbidden to her.

### Part 6
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> If <b>two</b> halakhically <b>competent brothers</b> were <b>married to two sisters, one</b> of whom is <b>a deaf-mute and</b> the other <b>one</b> halakhically <b>competent, and the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> brother <b>married to the deaf-mute</b> sister <b>died, what should the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> brother <b>married to the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> sister <b>do?</b> The deaf-mute is <b>released due to</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a wife’s sister.</b> If <b>the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> brother <b>married to the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> sister <b>died, what should the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> brother <b>married to the deaf-mute</b> sister <b>do? He divorces his wife with a bill of divorce,</b> as the halakhically competent sister came before him for levirate marriage, and the legal status of her levirate bond is higher than that of his marriage to his wife, a deaf-mute. <b>And he</b> releases <b>his brother’s wife,</b> who is not a deaf-mute, <b>by means of <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> as they are both competent and can therefore perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.

### Part 7
The Gemara again asks: <b>But why</b> should <b>he divorce his wife with a bill of divorce? Let her</b> continue to <b>live with him,</b> as a deaf-mute <b>is</b> in the same category <b>as a minor who eats</b> the meat of <b>unslaughtered animals.</b> The Gemara answers as above: He must divorce her <b>due to the prohibition</b> that applies to <b>him.</b>

### Part 8
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> If <b>two brothers, one</b> of whom is <b>a deaf-mute and</b> the other <b>one</b> halakhically <b>competent,</b> were <b>married to two sisters, one</b> of whom is <b>a deaf-mute and</b> the other <b>one</b> halakhically <b>competent, and the deaf-mute</b> brother <b>married to the deaf-mute</b> sister <b>died, what should the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> brother <b>married to the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> sister <b>do?</b> The deaf-mute woman is <b>released due to</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a wife’s sister.</b> If <b>the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> brother <b>married to the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> sister <b>died, what should the deaf-mute</b> brother <b>married to the deaf-mute</b> sister <b>do? He divorces his wife with a bill of divorce, and his brother’s wife is forbidden</b> to him <b>forever.</b>

### Part 9
Rava elaborates: <b>But here</b> is a case <b>where there is no prohibition</b> that applies to <b>her and there is no prohibition</b> that applies to <b>him,</b> as they are both deaf-mutes who are not prohibited to each other, <b>and</b> yet it <b>is taught</b> that <b>he divorces his wife with a bill of divorce. Rav Shemaya said:</b> This is a rabbinic <b>decree due to</b> the danger of <b>permitting a <i>yevama</i> to</b> a member of the <b>public.</b> Since people might think that the deaf-mute sister is his full-fledged wife, they are likely to conclude that it is permitted for this <i>yevama</i> to marry someone other than the <i>yavam</i>, like any other sister of the wife of the <i>yavam</i>. However, in actual fact she is not the sister of the wife of her <i>yavam</i>, as the deaf-mutes are not married by Torah law, and she may not marry any other man because she is a <i>yevama</i> whose <i>yavam</i> cannot marry her or perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. For this reason, the Sages decreed that this deaf-mute husband must divorce his wife. In sum, this source too does not provide conclusive proof with regard to the question of a minor who eats meat from unslaughtered animals.
