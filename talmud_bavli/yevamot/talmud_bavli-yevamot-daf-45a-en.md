<b>to</b> forbidden relations <b>for which one is liable for</b> violation of <b>a prohibition</b> concerning <b>which a betrothal</b> between the couple <b>would take effect. However, here,</b> with regard to <b>a gentile and a slave, since their betrothal</b> of a Jewish woman <b>would not take effect,</b> a union with them <b>is comparable to</b> forbidden relations <b>for which one is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>,</b> and therefore the offspring of such a union will be a <i>mamzer</i>.

### Part 2
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a gentile or a slave who engaged in intercourse with a Jewish woman, the offspring</b> born from such a union <b>is a <i>mamzer</i>. Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says:</b> The offspring is <b>a <i>mamzer</i> only</b> if born <b>from</b> relations with <b>one who is forbidden by a prohibition of forbidden relations</b> that are <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>.</b> It is apparent from the <i>baraita</i> that one who holds, as does Shimon HaTimni, that only the offspring from forbidden relations for which one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> is a <i>mamzer</i>, nevertheless holds that the offspring of a slave or gentile and a Jewish woman is not a <i>mamzer</i>.

### Part 3
<b>Rather, Rav Yosef said: Who</b> is included by saying: <b>All agree?</b> It is <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, as <b>although Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (52b) concerning the mishna (50a–51b) that states that a levirate betrothal between a <i>yavam</i> and a <i>yevama</i> with whom he had already performed <i>ḥalitza</i> is ineffective: <b>This statement was said only according to the statement of Rabbi Akiva, as he would consider a <i>ḥalutza</i> like a forbidden relative</b> such that if the <i>yavam</i> betrothed her it would not take effect. <b>And</b> although Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>himself does not hold accordingly</b> with regard to that issue, <b>with regard to</b> the offspring of a union with <b>a gentile or a slave he concedes</b> that the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>. <b>As, when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he said that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi said in the name of our Master,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: With regard to <b>a gentile or a slave who engaged in intercourse with a Jewish woman, the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara cites a related incident: <b>Rabbi Aḥa, lord of the capital, and Rabbi Tanḥum, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> the <b>man of Akko village, redeemed those captives who came from Armon to Tiberias. One of them had been impregnated by a gentile, and they came before Rabbi Ami</b> to ask what the offspring’s status would be when born. <b>He said to them</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Ḥanina</b> all <b>say:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile or a slave who engaged in intercourse with a Jewish woman, the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b>

### Part 5
Upon hearing this, <b>Rav Yosef said: Is it so great to enumerate men?</b> The fact that several great Sages held this opinion does not prove that their opinion is the accepted <i>halakha</i>. <b>But</b> there are <b>Rav and Shmuel in Babylonia, and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi and bar Kappara in Eretz Yisrael, and some say</b> to <b>remove bar Kappara</b> from this list <b>and insert</b> instead <b>the Elders of the South, who</b> all <b>say:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile or a slave who engaged in intercourse with a Jewish woman,</b> the lineage of <b>the offspring is unflawed,</b> and he or she may marry into the congregation of Israel.

### Part 6
<b>Rather, Rav Yosef said</b> the <i>halakha</i> is in fact that the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i> because this <b>is Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion, <b>as when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael he said that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi said in the name of our Master,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, that <b>they say:</b> With regard to <b>a gentile or a slave who engaged in intercourse with a Jewish woman, the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> The lineage of <b>the offspring is sullied,</b> and if the child is a girl she is restricted in whom she may marry. The Gemara asks: <b>To whom</b> is she prohibited from marrying? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>to the congregation</b> of Israel, but <b>didn’t Rabbi Yehoshua</b> himself <b>say</b> that the lineage of <b>the offspring is unflawed</b> and he or she may marry into the congregation of Israel? <b>Rather,</b> the offspring is prohibited <b>to</b> marry into <b>the priesthood, as all of the <i>amora’im</i> who render</b> the offspring <b>fit</b> to enter the congregation of Israel <b>agree that the offspring has flawed</b> lineage and is forbidden <b>to</b> marry into <b>the priesthood.</b>

### Part 8
This is derived <b>from an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a widow,</b> as follows: <b>Just as</b> in the case of <b>a widow</b> who is married <b>to a High Priest, where the prohibition</b> that pertains <b>to her is not equally applicable to all</b> Jews, i.e., only a High Priest is prohibited from marrying a widow, and nevertheless <b>her child</b> from that union will <b>have flawed</b> lineage, then so too with regard to <b>this</b> woman who engaged in relations with a gentile or slave, <b>where the prohibition</b> that pertains <b>to her is equally applicable to all</b> Jews, <b>isn’t it logical that her child</b> from that union will <b>have flawed</b> lineage?

### Part 9
And if one would say that the logic of this <i>a fortiori</i> inference could be refuted by claiming that <b>what</b> is true with regard <b>to a widow</b> who is married <b>to a High Priest, where</b> her union with him is what makes <b>her herself disqualified</b> from subsequently marrying any priest and, if she is the daughter of a priest, from eating <i>teruma</i>, is not true with regard to the prohibition against a Jewish woman engaging in relations with a gentile or a slave. This is not correct, because <b>here, too, once he has engaged in intercourse with her, he</b> thereby <b>renders her unfit</b> to marry into the priesthood.

### Part 10
<b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to a gentile or a slave who engaged in intercourse with a daughter of a priest or with a female Levite or with a female Israelite that they</b> thereby <b>render her unfit</b> to marry into the priesthood? <b>As it is stated: “But a priest’s daughter when she will become a widow, or a divorcée,</b> and have no child, she returns to her father’s house as in her youth” (Leviticus 22:13). The verse indicates that she returns to her father’s house and enjoys the rights of the priesthood only in a case where she engaged in intercourse with <b>one to whom widowhood and divorce can apply,</b> i.e., one with whom her marriage would be valid and would be broken only through death or divorce. <b>Excluded</b> from this is a union with <b>a gentile or a slave, to whom neither widowhood nor divorce can apply,</b> as no marriage bond can be formed with them.

### Part 11
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>What did you see that you rely upon Rav Dimi</b> and his tradition that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that the offspring of a gentile or a slave and a Jewish woman is a <i>mamzer</i>? <b>Rely</b> instead <b>upon Ravin, as when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi</b> both <b>rule</b> that the offspring is <b>permitted</b> to marry into the congregation of Israel. <b>And who is</b> the <b>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi</b> referred to in Ravin’s report? It is the one who is simply referred to as <b>Rabbi,</b> the redactor of the Mishna, whose opinion is accepted as the <i>halakha</i>.

### Part 12
The Gemara notes: <b>And even Rav rules</b> that the offspring is <b>permitted, as</b> is evident from an incident involving <b>a certain</b> individual <b>who came before Rav</b> and <b>said to him:</b> With regard to the offspring of <b>a gentile or a slave who engaged in intercourse with a Jewish woman, what is</b> its halakhic status?

### Part 13
Rav <b>said to him:</b> The lineage of <b>the offspring is unflawed.</b> The individual who asked the question was himself such a child, and <b>he said to</b> Rav: If so, <b>give me your daughter</b> in marriage. He said to him: <b>I will not give</b> her <b>to you.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Shimi bar Ḥiyya,</b> Rav’s grandson, <b>said to Rav: People</b> often <b>say</b> that <b>a camel in Medes</b> can <b>dance upon</b> a small space that holds only a single <b><i>kav</i></b> of produce. However, clearly that is an exaggeration, since if one would go to Medes one could demonstrate that <b>this is</b> a space that holds a <b><i>kav</i>, and this is a camel, and this is Medes, and</b> yet the camel <b>is not dancing,</b> i.e., the truth of a statement becomes apparent when it is put to the test. So too, it would appear that you do not truly believe in your ruling because when put to the test, you are unwilling to rely on it.

### Part 15
<b>He said to him:</b> Even <b>if he were as</b> great as <b>Joshua, son of Nun, I would not give him my daughter</b> in marriage. My refusal to give her to him in marriage is not that I do not stand by my ruling; it is for other reasons. <b>He said to him: If he were as</b> great as <b>Joshua, son of Nun,</b> then even <b>if the Master would not give him</b> his daughter, <b>others would</b> still <b>give him</b> their daughters. However, with regard to <b>this</b> man, <b>if the Master does not give him</b> his daughter, <b>others will not give him</b> their daughters either out of fear of damaging the family lineage. Nevertheless, Rav remained unwilling to give his daughter to that individual.

### Part 16
That individual <b>would not go from</b> standing <b>before</b> Rav and continued to plead with him. Rav <b>placed his eyes upon him and he died.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara adds: <b>And even Rav Mattana rules</b> that the offspring is <b>permitted, and even Rav Yehuda rules</b> that the offspring is <b>permitted, as</b> is evident from the fact that <b>when</b> a child of a gentile or slave and a Jewish woman <b>came before Rav Yehuda, he said to him: Go</b> and <b>conceal</b> your paternal lineage so that people will not refrain from giving you their daughters in marriage, as it is permitted for you to marry into the congregation of Israel, <b>or</b> otherwise, <b>marry</b> a woman <b>of your own kind,</b> i.e., a woman of similar lineage. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>when</b> such a person <b>came before Rava, he said to him: Either go into exile</b> to a place where your lineage is unknown, so that others will give you their daughters in marriage, <b>or marry a woman of your own kind.</b>

### Part 18
<b>The residents of Bei Mikhsei sent</b> the following question <b>to Rabba:</b> With regard to the offspring of <b>one who is a half-slave half-freeman, who engaged in intercourse with a Jewish woman, what is</b> its halakhic status? <b>He said to them: Now</b> that with regard to the offspring of <b>a full slave we say</b> that his lineage is <b>unflawed, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to ask about <b>a half-</b>slave?

### Part 19
<b>Rav Yosef said: The Master</b> who is responsible for dissemination <b>of</b> this <b><i>halakha</i></b> that the offspring of a slave and a Jewish woman is not a <i>mamzer</i>,
