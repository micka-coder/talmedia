### Part 1
<b>and we saw them immediately</b> when they came out of the water, <b>and</b> the women <b>stated distinguishing marks</b> that identified these people. <b>As,</b> in this case <b>we do not rely upon</b> the women, <b>but</b> upon <b>the distinguishing marks.</b>

### Part 2
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who deposited sesame plants with his friend.</b> Sometime later <b>he said to him: Give me the sesame plants.</b> The friend <b>said to him: You</b> already <b>took them.</b> The owner replied: <b>But they were</b> of <b>such-and-such</b> an amount, <b>and placed in a barrel;</b> go and check that barrel and you will see that I am right. The bailee <b>said to him: You took your</b> sesame plants, <b>and these</b> in the barrel at my house <b>are other ones.</b>

### Part 3
The case came before the Sages for a ruling. <b>Rav Ḥisda thought to say: This</b> situation <b>is</b> the same as the situation involving the <b>two Torah scholars</b> who drowned, when they used distinguishing marks to identify them. <b>And we do not say</b> in that case: <b>Those</b> men <b>went</b> elsewhere <b>in the world, and these</b> men who floated up <b>are different people.</b> Here too one may rely upon the distinguishing marks of the sesame plants given by the owner, and there is no reason to think that these sesame plants are different ones.

### Part 4
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>Is it comparable? There they said distinguishing marks</b> that identified the victims. <b>Here,</b> in the case of <b>sesame plants, what distinguishing marks might they have,</b> by which they could be identified? <b>And</b> as for <b>that which he said: They were</b> of <b>such-and-such</b> an amount, one can <b>say it happened by chance</b> that this second time it <b>was</b> the same <b>amount,</b> and there is no proof that these are the same sesame plants.

### Part 5
With regard to the same issue, <b>Mar Kashisha, son of Rav Ḥisda, said to Rav Ashi: And are we concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the one guarding the plants <b>moved them</b> from their place? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 4:11): If one <b>found a vessel on which</b> the letter <b><i>kuf</i> was written,</b> all objects inside the vessel are designated for a <b><i>korban</i>,</b> an offering; if the letter <b><i>mem</i></b> was written on it, it is <b><i>ma’aser</i>,</b> tithes; if it was the letter <b><i>dalet</i>,</b> it is <b><i>dimua</i>,</b> a mixture of <i>teruma</i> and non-sacred produce; if <b><i>tet</i>,</b> it signifies <b><i>tevel</i>,</b> untithed produce; and finally, if it is a <b><i>tav</i>,</b> it indicates <b><i>teruma</i>. As during a time of danger,</b> i.e., religious persecution against Jews, <b>they would write,</b> for example, <b><i>tav</i> instead of <i>teruma</i>.</b> In this case, no concern is expressed that someone might have moved the <i>teruma</i> from that vessel to somewhere else.

### Part 6
In response to this claim, <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: And aren’t we concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> someone <b>moved</b> the <i>teruma</i> from their place? <b>Say the latter clause</b> of that same mishna <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even if</b> one <b>found a barrel on which</b> the full word <b><i>teruma</i> was written, these</b> contents <b>are non-sacred. As I say: Last year it was full of <i>teruma</i>, and</b> someone <b>removed</b> the contents and replaced them with non-sacred produce. This proves that the possibility that someone moved the original contents is taken into consideration.

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> say as follows: <b>Everyone</b> agrees that <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> someone <b>moved</b> the contents of a container from their place, <b>and here,</b> with regard to the marked vessels, <b>they disagree about this</b> issue: <b>The Sage</b> who claims that one may rely on the inscription <b>holds</b> that <b>if it is so, that he moved</b> the <i>teruma</i>, <b>he would have erased</b> the inscription. <b>And the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Yosei, responds that one can <b>say he forgot</b> to do so. <b>Alternatively, he left the label to preserve [<i>panaḥya</i>]</b> the contents, so that people would mistakenly think that it contained <i>teruma</i> and would refrain from taking the produce.

### Part 8
§ The Gemara relates a story that deals with the permission of a woman to remarry. <b>Yitzḥak the Exilarch, son of the sister of Rav Beivai, was walking from Cortva to Spain and died</b> along the way. <b>They sent</b> this message <b>from</b> Spain: <b>Yitzḥak the Exilarch, son of the sister of Rav Beivai, was walking from Cortva to Spain and died.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Are we concerned about</b> the possibility of <b>two</b> men named <b>Yitzḥak or not?</b> Perhaps there is someone else with the same name, and therefore the mention of his name is not a sufficiently distinguishing mark. <b>Abaye said: We are concerned</b> about this possibility. <b>Rava said: We are not concerned.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Abaye said: From where do I say</b> my reasoning that there might be another man with the same name? <b>As a certain bill of divorce was found in</b> the city of <b>Neharde’a, and</b> this passage was <b>written</b> on it: <b>On the colonial [<i>kelonya</i>] side of the city, I, Androlinai of Neharde’a, excused, sent away,</b> and divorced <b>my wife so-and-so.</b> Androlinai’s wife requested permission to remarry based on this bill of divorce, but they did not know if he was the man who gave the divorce or if it was given by another man of the same name. <b>And the father of Shmuel sent this</b> question <b>before Rabbi Yehuda Nesia</b> in Eretz Yisrael. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <b>sent</b> a message <b>to him: All of Neharde’a must be examined,</b> to see whether there is another man by that name. This shows that one must be concerned that there might be two people with the same name.

### Part 10
<b>And Rava said:</b> This story provides no proof. <b>If it is so,</b> that there were grounds to suspect that someone else of the same name wrote the bill of divorce, Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <b>should have</b> said: <b>The entire world must be examined,</b> in case there is someone else with the same name somewhere. Since he did not say this, evidently there was no legitimate reason for this suspicion at all. Why, then, did Rabbi Yehuda Nesia send instructions to examine all of Neharde’a? <b>Rather,</b> Rava added, <b>it was due to respect for the father of Shmuel that he sent this</b> message. He did not want to write explicitly that Shmuel’s father had inquired unnecessarily, and therefore he wrote his reply in a manner which indicated his partial agreement with the concern.

### Part 11
<b>Rava said: From where do I say</b> my reasoning that we are not concerned about two people with identical names? <b>As there were two</b> promissory <b>notes produced in Meḥoza, and</b> these names of the creditors were <b>written on them: Ḥavai bar Nanai and Nanai bar Ḥavai, and Rava bar Avuh collected dinars</b> for them <b>with these</b> promissory notes, without concerning himself with the possibility that they might be referring to other people. <b>And</b> the names <b>Ḥavai bar Nanai and Nanai bar Ḥavai are very common in Meḥoza,</b> i.e., there are certainly other people with these names, and yet he was not worried about this matter. The Gemara asks: <b>And Abaye,</b> how does he answer this proof?
