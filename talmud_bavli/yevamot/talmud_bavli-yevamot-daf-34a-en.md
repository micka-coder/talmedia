### Part 1
The Gemara asks: According to Rabbi Ḥiyya, who teaches that this case incurs sixteen sin-offerings, <b>who is this <i>tanna</i> who holds</b> that a prohibition takes effect where another prohibition already exists for <b>a more inclusive prohibition, an expanded prohibition, and a simultaneous prohibition?</b> If these men are brothers, the moment that one betrothed a woman, that woman was immediately rendered forbidden to the second brother both as a married woman and as his brother’s wife. When the second brother betrothed her sister, this added the prohibition pertaining to his wife’s sister. This is a more inclusive prohibition because, as a result of this betrothal, the second brother is prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse not only with his wife’s sister, who is his brother’s wife, but also with all of her other sisters. When this woman becomes a menstruating woman, she is forbidden to her husband as well, which is an expanded prohibition. Consequently, the mishna includes examples of all three types of prohibitions and asserts that they all take effect in this case. Therefore, the Gemara wonders which <i>tanna</i> holds that in each of these cases the prohibition takes effect even where another prohibition exists.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: This is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There is</b> one who performs a single act of <b>eating</b> an olive-bulk of food, <b>and he is liable to bring four sin-offerings and one guilt-offering.</b>

### Part 3
How so? This <i>halakha</i> applies to one who is <b>ritually impure who ate</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> that was <b><i>notar</i> from a consecrated offering,</b> i.e., it remained after the time when it was permitted to eat it, and this occurred <b>on Yom Kippur.</b> One who did this is liable to bring one sin offering for eating consecrated food while impure, one for eating forbidden fat, one for eating <i>notar</i>, and one for eating on Yom Kippur. He is also liable to bring a guilt-offering for misuse of consecrated items. In this case, it was prohibited to eat the fat from the moment the animal was born. When the animal was consecrated, the prohibition against deriving benefit from it took effect on the entire animal, rendering this an expanded prohibition. When the priest became ritually impure and thereby prohibited from partaking of all sanctified foods, a more inclusive prohibition took effect. The moment the fat was rendered <i>notar</i>, it became prohibited to offer it on the altar as well, so that that is another instance of an expanded prohibition. Lastly, on Yom Kippur, an additional, more inclusive prohibition took effect because on Yom Kippur it is prohibited to eat all food, even that which is not consecrated.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> There is one more sin-offering for which he may be liable. <b>If it was Shabbat and he carried</b> this olive-bulk of food from one domain to another <b>in his mouth, he is liable</b> for carrying out on Shabbat. The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Meir: Liability for the sin-offering that you added <b>is not</b> incurred <b>from</b> violation <b>of the</b> same <b>type</b> of prohibition. He is liable for carrying out the food, not for eating it. In this example, the prohibitions of Shabbat and Yom Kippur take effect at the same moment, and therefore this last case would be an instance of simultaneous prohibitions, and Rabbi Meir holds that they take effect as well. Therefore, this <i>baraita</i> demonstrates that Rabbi Meir holds that prohibitions take effect where other prohibitions already exist in all of these instances: More inclusive prohibitions, expanded prohibitions, and simultaneous prohibitions.

### Part 5
The Gemara continues to clarify the opinion of Rabbi Meir: <b>And in accordance with whose opinion is</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Meir? If</b> you say that <b>it is in accordance</b> with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> this is difficult. <b>Didn’t</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>say that one who erred with regard to a mitzva is exempt</b> from bringing a sin-offering, i.e., one who unwittingly performed a transgression while intending to perform a mitzva is exempt from punishment? In the case in the mishna as well, the men intended to perform the mitzva of marriage but unwittingly violated a transgression because the wives were switched. Therefore, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua, they should be exempt from a sin-offering. <b>Rather,</b> this must be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who holds that even if one mistakenly transgressed while attempting to perform a mitzva, he is still obligated to bring a sin-offering.

### Part 6
<b>If you wish,</b> resolve this differently and <b>say: Actually,</b> this can be explained even <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua. When Rabbi Yehoshua says that one who erred with regard to a mitzva is exempt, this applies</b> only <b>to</b> the case of <b>babies</b> who were mixed up in such a way that on Shabbat the <i>mohel</i> mistakenly circumcised a baby whose time had not yet come for circumcision. Since the <i>mohel</i> did not fulfill the mitzva of circumcision, he should be liable for performing prohibited labor on Shabbat. However, Rabbi Yehoshua exempts him from a sin-offering <b>since</b> he is <b>pressed for time.</b> Because circumcision must be performed only on the day specified, he was rushed and anxious to perform the circumcision, and due to this sense of urgency he erred and thought that the proper time was on Shabbat. <b>In this</b> case in the mishna, <b>however,</b> where the mistake involved marriage, <b>since</b> the brothers were <b>not pressed for time</b> Rabbi Yehoshua does <b>not</b> deem the brothers exempt.

### Part 7
The Gemara objects: <b>And yet</b> in the case of eating <b><i>teruma</i>, where one is not pressed for time and</b> nevertheless Rabbi Yehoshua <b>exempts</b> him if the act involved a mitzva, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 72b): If a priest <b>was partaking of <i>teruma</i> and it became known that he was the son of a divorced woman or the son of a <i>ḥalutza</i></b> and thereby disqualified from the priesthood and prohibited from eating <i>teruma</i>, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to pay <b>the</b> value of the <b>principal and</b> an additional <b>fifth,</b> like any non-priest who unwittingly ate <i>teruma</i>. However, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua exempts</b> him because at the time of consumption he intended to perform a mitzva, for he thought that he was a priest eating of the <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 8
The Gemara responds: <b>But wasn’t it stated with regard to</b> that mishna: <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye said: Here we are dealing with</b> leavened <b><i>teruma</i></b> that was being eaten by the priest <b>on the eve of Passover, for he is pressed for time.</b> In this case, he would rush to eat it so that it would not have to be burned.

### Part 9
The Gemara offers a different attribution of the mishna: <b>And if you wish, say</b> a different explanation: The mishna is not according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who deems one liable in cases of more inclusive prohibitions and expanded prohibitions. Rather, the mishna is referring only to cases <b>of simultaneous prohibitions, and in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>all of</b> the prohibitions in the mishna, <b>you can find that they</b> take effect simultaneously in the case <b>where</b> the men <b>appointed</b> a single <b>agent</b> to betroth the women for them, <b>and</b> the women <b>appointed an agent</b> to accept the betrothals for them, <b>and</b> one <b>agent encounters</b> the other <b>agent.</b> In this scenario, all the men become betrothed to all the women the moment that the agents meet, and the prohibitions all take effect simultaneously. <b>However,</b> with regard to the prohibition pertaining to <b>menstruating women, how can you find</b> the case where both women become menstruating women at the exact time of betrothal?

### Part 11
<b>Rav Amram said that Rav said:</b> This is referring to a situation <b>where</b> the women <b>continuously discharge</b> menstrual blood <b>from within the thirteenth</b> year of the brothers <b>until after</b> they reached the age of <b>thirteen,</b> in order <b>to deem</b> the men <b>liable</b> for the prohibition pertaining to a menstruating woman. At the moment that the boys reached maturity and the betrothals went into effect, the sisters were forbidden as menstruating women. And the women were continuously discharging blood <b>from within the twelfth</b> year of the women <b>until after</b> the age of <b>twelve, in order to deem</b> the women <b>liable</b> for engaging in relations as a menstruating woman. Therefore, if this took place in such a way that on the exact day when the men reached maturity, i.e., their thirteenth birthday, the women reached maturity, i.e., their twelfth birthday, and at that moment they were menstruating, then all of the prohibitions would take effect simultaneously and they would be liable on all counts, according to Rabbi Shimon as well.

### Part 12
§ The mishna taught that <b>we separate</b> these women from their husbands for three months, as perhaps they became pregnant. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> it known that a virgin <b>woman does not become pregnant from her first sexual act? Rav Naḥman said that Rabba bar Avuh said:</b> This is referring to a situation <b>where they engaged in intercourse and then repeated</b> the act, so that it is possible that the women were impregnated during the second act of intercourse. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if this is so, how can one explain <b>that which Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches: Here, then, are sixteen sin-offerings?</b> If there were indeed two acts of intercourse, then <b>there</b> should <b>be thirty-two</b> sin-offerings, since each prohibition was violated twice.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>And according to your reasoning, that</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya’s enumeration of sin-offerings applies to all acts of intercourse, then <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who deems one liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for each and every thrusting</b> movement during a single act of intercourse, there would <b>be many</b> prohibitions that were violated. This would greatly multiply the number of sin-offerings required. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that Rabbi Ḥiyya, with regard to Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, <b>is enumerating</b> only <b>the first thrusting</b> movement <b>in the intercourse. And so too,</b> with regard to the Rabbis’ opinion, <b>he is enumerating</b> only <b>the first act of intercourse.</b> If there were two acts of intercourse, however, the number of sin-offerings would be doubled.

### Part 14
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman:</b>
