### Part 1
<b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara clarifies the dilemma: <b>Do we follow</b> the time of <b>marriage,</b> at which point she was unfit for him according to most <i>tanna’im</i>, who hold that a High Priest may not marry a grown woman, as she is no longer called “a wife in her virginity” (Leviticus 21:13)? <b>Or do we follow</b> the time of <b>betrothal,</b> at which point she was of suitable age?

### Part 2
Shmuel <b>said to him: You learned it</b> in the mishna: If <b>they were widowed or divorced from marriage, they are disqualified</b> from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, but if they were widowed or divorced <b>from betrothal, they are fit</b> to partake of <i>teruma</i>. This indicates that disqualifications from the privileges of priesthood are determined based upon marriage rather than betrothal.

### Part 3
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef <b>said to</b> Shmuel: With regard to <b>causing her</b> to become <b>a <i>ḥalala</i> I did not raise a dilemma, as</b> it is clear <b>that it is intercourse that causes her</b> to become <b>a <i>ḥalala</i>. When I raised a dilemma,</b> it was with regard to the verse pertaining to a High Priest: <b>“And he shall take a wife in her virginity”</b> (Leviticus 21:13). <b>What</b> does “take” mean in this verse? <b>Do we require</b> that only <b>the taking of betrothal</b> must occur when she is in her virginity, i.e., when she is a minor or a young woman, <b>or</b> perhaps <b>we require</b> even <b>the taking of marriage</b> to be performed when she is a minor or young woman?

### Part 4
Shmuel <b>said to him: This, too, you learned</b> in a mishna (61a): If <b>he betrothed a widow and was</b> subsequently <b>appointed to be High Priest, he may marry</b> her, despite the fact that a High Priest is prohibited from marrying a widow. This indicates that her permissibility to him is determined according to the time of the betrothal rather than the time of marriage. The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>There it is different, as it is written: “He shall take for a wife”</b> (Leviticus 21:14). The superfluous expression “for a wife” indicates that he is permitted to marry the widow in this case.

### Part 5
The Gemara objects: <b>Here, too,</b> with regard to a woman who matured after betrothal, <b>it is written:</b> “And he shall take <b>a wife</b> in her virginity,” and this should indicate that he may marry the grown woman in this case. The Gemara answers that the term “wife” allows for the inclusion of <b>one</b> case <b>but not two.</b> Consequently, since a High Priest may marry a widow he had betrothed before he was appointed High Priest, it cannot also be derived that he may marry a grown woman that he had betrothed before she matured.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you to include the case of a widow and exclude that of a grown woman? The Gemara answers: In <b>this</b> case, of the grown woman, <b>her body has changed,</b> and therefore she is forbidden to him even though she was betrothed before she matured. In <b>that</b> case, of the widow, <b>her body has not changed.</b> It is the priest’s personal status that has changed, and therefore she remains permitted.

### Part 7
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A High Priest may not marry a widow, whether</b> she is <b>a widow from betrothal or a widow from marriage. And he may not marry a grown woman.</b> He may marry only a minor or a young woman. <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon declare a grown woman fit</b> to marry a High Priest. <b>And he may not marry a woman whose hymen was torn accidentally.</b>

### Part 8
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states with regard to a High Priest: <b>“A widow…he shall not take”</b> (Leviticus 21:14), which prohibits him from marrying any widow, <b>whether</b> she is <b>a widow from betrothal or a widow from marriage.</b> The Gemara is surprised by this statement: This is <b>obvious,</b> as the verse is referring to a widow without further specification. The Gemara answers: It is necessary; <b>lest you say that one should derive</b> a verbal analogy between the words <b>“widow”</b> and <b>“widow,”</b> based upon the usage of that term in a verse with regard to <b>Tamar,</b> Judah’s daughter-in-law (Genesis 38:11), as follows: <b>Just as there,</b> Tamar was a widow <b>from marriage, so too here</b> the verse is referring only to a widow <b>from marriage.</b> The <i>tanna</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that <b>it is indeed so,</b> that the suggested verbal analogy is correct. The Gemara answers: It is <b>similar to</b> the case of <b>a divorcée: Just as a divorcée</b> is forbidden to a priest <b>whether</b> she was divorced <b>from marriage or from betrothal, so too a widow</b> is forbidden to a High Priest <b>whether</b> she is a widow <b>from marriage or from betrothal.</b>

### Part 10
§ It was taught in the mishna: <b>And</b> a High Priest <b>may not marry a grown woman. The Sages taught</b> that the verse: <b>“And he shall take a wife in her virginity”</b> (Leviticus 21:13) <b>excludes a grown woman, whose hymen has worn away,</b> i.e., it is no longer as complete as that of a minor or a young woman; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon declare a grown woman fit</b> to marry a High Priest.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that were the verse referring simply to <b>a virgin</b> it would have <b>indicated</b> that <b>even</b> a woman with <b>partial</b> signs of <b>virginity,</b> i.e., a grown woman, is permitted. Since the verse states <b>“her virginity,”</b> it means that she is fit to marry a High Priest only <b>if all of</b> the signs of <b>her virginity are</b> intact, which excludes a grown woman. The full expression <b>“in her virginity”</b> indicates that if she has experienced sexual intercourse in <b>a typical</b> manner, which takes place in the area of her virginity, i.e., her hymen, <b>yes,</b> she is disqualified from marrying a High Priest; but if she has experienced sexual intercourse in <b>an atypical</b> manner i.e., anal intercourse, <b>no,</b> she is not disqualified.

### Part 12
<b>And Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon hold</b> that were the verse referring simply to <b>a virgin,</b> it would have <b>indicated</b> that only <b>a complete virgin</b> is fit to marry a High Priest, but not a grown woman. When it states <b>“her virginity,”</b> it indicates that <b>even</b> a woman with <b>partial</b> signs of <b>virginity,</b> i.e., a grown woman, is fit to marry the High Priest. The full expression <b>“in her virginity”</b> indicates that she is not fit to marry to marry a High Priest <b>unless all of her virginity is intact,</b> i.e., she has not engaged in intercourse of any kind, <b>whether typical</b> sexual intercourse <b>or atypical</b> sexual intercourse.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If <b>she had atypical sexual intercourse, she is disqualified from</b> the High <b>Priesthood,</b> i.e., from marrying the High Priest. <b>Rava raised an objection</b> based upon a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to rape: <b>“And she shall be his wife”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:19), and the Sages explained that this is referring only <b>to a woman suitable for him, excluding a widow for a High Priest</b> and <b>a divorcée or a <i>ḥalutza</i> for a common priest.</b> In these cases, the rapist is not permitted to marry his victim.

### Part 14
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this <i>halakha</i>? <b>If we say</b> that the High Priest raped her by engaging <b>in typical</b> intercourse, <b>why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> <b>specifically</b> state that she is forbidden to him <b>because</b> she is <b>a widow? Let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the fact <b>that she is</b> now <b>a non-virgin. Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> that he had <b>atypical</b> intercourse with her, <b>and due to</b> the fact that she is <b>a widow, yes,</b> that is the reason she is forbidden, but <b>due to</b> the fact that she is <b>a non-virgin, no,</b> that is not the reason she is forbidden? This indicates that a woman who had intercourse in an atypical manner is not considered a non-virgin and is not disqualified from marrying a High Priest.
