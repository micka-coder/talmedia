### Part 1
<b>However,</b> if <b>she is rumored</b> to have engaged in intercourse <b>with him, even if she is</b> also <b>rumored</b> to have engaged in intercourse <b>with others, we cast</b> the child <b>after him.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rava said: From where do I say that?</b> My source is the mishna that <b>teaches</b> that if a priest engaged in extramarital intercourse with an Israelite woman and she <b>gave birth, she may partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> due to her child. <b>What are the circumstances? If we say that she is rumored</b> to have engaged in intercourse <b>with him and she is not rumored</b> to have engaged in intercourse <b>with others, need it be said that she may partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>? It can easily be assumed that the priest is the father. <b>Rather, is it not</b> a case <b>where she is rumored</b> to have engaged in intercourse <b>with others as well?</b>

### Part 3
<b>And if there, where</b> for her <b>to</b> engage in intercourse with <b>this</b> priest is in violation of <b>a prohibition and to</b> engage in intercourse with <b>that</b> non-priest is in violation of <b>a prohibition</b> of the same degree, and she is rumored to have engaged in intercourse with both, nevertheless, <b>we cast</b> the child <b>after</b> the priest, then <b>here, where</b> for her <b>to</b> engage in intercourse with <b>that</b> man who is not her betrothed is in violation of a Torah <b>prohibition and to</b> engage in intercourse with <b>this</b> man, her betrothed, <b>is permitted</b> by Torah law, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that he should be considered the father?

### Part 4
<b>Abaye said to him: Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>anywhere that she is rumored</b> to have engaged in intercourse <b>with others, even if she is</b> also <b>rumored</b> to have engaged in intercourse <b>with him, Rav said</b> that <b>the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>. And the mishna,</b> which you cited as support for your claim, is referring to a situation <b>where she is not rumored</b> to have engaged in intercourse with anyone <b>at all.</b> Therefore, if they both concur that he is the father, the child is considered his.

### Part 5
§ It is stated in the mishna that <b>a slave disqualifies</b> a woman from partaking of <i>teruma</i> <b>due to</b> his engaging in <b>intercourse</b> with her, but not due to his being her offspring. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that he does not disqualify a woman whose offspring he is? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a maidservant married to a Hebrew slave, that when he is released, <b>“the wife and her children shall be</b> her master’s” (Exodus 21:4). This indicates that the maidservant’s children are considered her own and are not considered their father’s offspring at all. Therefore, a maidservant’s child does not disqualify his paternal grandmother from partaking of <i>teruma</i>.

### Part 6
§ It is stated in the mishna that <b>a <i>mamzer</i> disqualifies</b> a woman from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, <b>and he</b> also <b>enables</b> a woman <b>to partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>. <b>The Sages taught:</b> The Torah states, “But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, <b>and have no child</b>…she may eat of her father’s bread” (Leviticus 22:13). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>her</b> own <b>child</b> disqualifies her from partaking of <i>teruma</i>; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>her child’s child</b> disqualifies her as well? <b>The verse states: “And she has no child [<i>zera</i>]” at all,</b> indicating that even her grandchild disqualifies her, as <i>zera</i> means offspring.

### Part 7
<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>an unflawed child</b> disqualifies her; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>an unfit child</b> disqualifies her as well? <b>The verse states: “And she has no [<i>ein la</i>] child,”</b> which can be homiletically interpreted as <b>examine her [<i>ayyein ala</i>]</b> to check if she has any offspring, fit or unfit.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you</b> already <b>derive</b> from that phrase <b>that her child’s child</b> disqualifies her? The Gemara answers: To derive the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>her child’s child, no verse was necessary,</b> as <b>the children of children are</b> considered <b>like children. The verse was</b> therefore <b>necessary for</b> deriving the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an unfit child.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Reish Lakish said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: In accordance with whose</b> opinion is the assumption of the mishna that the child of a Jewess and a slave or a gentile is a <i>mamzer</i>? Is it <b>in accordance</b> only <b>with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who said</b> that the offspring of relations <b>for which</b> one <b>is liable</b> for violating <b>a prohibition is a <i>mamzer</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that it is in accordance with <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i> only if the parents are liable to receive <i>karet</i>. This is because <b>they concede with regard to a slave and a gentile, as when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said in the name of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: With regard to <b>a gentile or a slave who engaged in intercourse with a Jewish woman, the offspring is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b>

### Part 10
§ It was taught in the mishna that even <b>a High Priest sometimes disqualifies</b> his grandmother from partaking of <i>teruma</i>. <b>The Sages taught</b> that she can say in disapproval: <b>I am hereby atonement for my daughter’s son, the small jug [<i>kuza</i>],</b> i.e., the <i>mamzer</i>. He is dear to me and I am willing to suffer to atone for him, <b>as he</b> is my offspring from a priest and therefore <b>enables me to partake of <i>teruma</i>. However, I am not</b> willing to be <b>atonement for my daughter’s son, the large jug [<i>kada</i>],</b> the High Priest, <b>as he</b> is my offspring from an Israelite and therefore <b>disqualifies me from</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>.</b>
