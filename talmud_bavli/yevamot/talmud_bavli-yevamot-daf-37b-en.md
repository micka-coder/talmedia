### Part 1
one <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., that the <i>halakha</i> in this case is in accordance with the opinion of Rav, <b>and</b> another <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., that the <i>halakha</i> is always decided in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.

### Part 2
<b>Abaye said: From where do I say that</b> concerning <b>anyone</b> whose status as a <i>mamzer</i> is <b>uncertain, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov</b> they <b>are treated equivalently to</b> one who is <b>definitely</b> a <i>mamzer</i>?

### Part 3
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> With regard to one <b>who engaged in intercourse with</b> and impregnated <b>many women, but he does not know with which</b> women <b>he had intercourse, and similarly,</b> with regard to a woman, if <b>many men had intercourse with her</b> and she became pregnant, <b>but she does not know from which</b> man <b>she received</b> the seed that caused her to become pregnant, since the identities of the parents of those children are not known, <b>it could emerge</b> that <b>a father marries his daughter, and a brother marries his sister. And</b> in this way, <b>the entire world could become filled with <i>mamzerim</i>. And concerning this, it is stated: “And lest the land become full of lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 19:29). Abaye demonstrates his claim from the fact that even though it is not certain that the children in this situation are <i>mamzerim</i>, nevertheless, Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov labels them as <i>mamzerim</i> and not as those whose status as a <i>mamzer</i> is uncertain.

### Part 4
<b>And Rava</b> could have <b>said to you: This is what</b> the verse <b>is saying:</b> The word “lewdness [<i>zima</i>]” can be understood as an acronym of the words: <i>Zo ma hi</i>, meaning: <b>What is this.</b> It is plausible to say that Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov’s citation of this verse indicates that he regards their status to be uncertain.

### Part 5
The Gemara cites the continuation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Furthermore, Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov said</b> that even in marriage, one should be careful not to create a situation that could lead to the birth of <i>mamzerim</i>. Therefore, <b>a man should not marry a woman in this country and</b> then <b>go and marry</b> another <b>woman in a different country, lest</b> a son from one marriage and a daughter from the other, unaware that they are both children of the same father, <b>unite with one another, and it could emerge</b> that <b>a brother marries his sister,</b> the children of whom would be <i>mamzerim</i>.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so;</b> is there really such a prohibition? <b>But didn’t Rav, when he happened</b> to come <b>to Dardeshir, make a public announcement saying: Which</b> woman <b>will be</b> my wife <b>for the day,</b> i.e., for the duration of his visit? Since his wife did not accompany him to Dardeshir, he wished to be married to another woman while he was there, in order to avoid a situation that could lead him to having forbidden thoughts. <b>And</b> also <b>Rav Naḥman, when he happened</b> to come <b>to Shakhnetziv, made a public announcement saying: Which</b> woman <b>will be</b> my wife <b>for the day?</b> It would appear, from the fact that both Sages married wives in two different places, that there is no prohibition in doing so.

### Part 7
The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>Sages are different, as their names are renowned,</b> and therefore their children are always identified by their connection to their father. Therefore, Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov’s concern does not apply to them.

### Part 8
The Gemara examines Rav and Rav Naḥman’s actions: <b>But didn’t Rava say:</b> With regard to a woman <b>who had an offer of marriage and accepted,</b> the emotional excitement may have caused her to have a flow of menstrual blood, which would making her ritually impure and prohibit her from engaging in intercourse. Even if she was unaware of any flow, she must consider the possibility that it occurred. To purify herself, <b>she needs to wait seven</b> consecutive days that are <b>clean</b> from any flow of menstrual blood and then immerse in a ritual bath. Only then may she marry. If so, how could Rav and Rav Naḥman marry women on the day they arrived?

### Part 9
The Gemara explains: These <b>Sages would send messengers</b> seven days ahead of their arrival and <b>they</b> would <b>inform</b> the women of the Sage’s arrival. In this way, the woman who agreed to marry the Sage would have time to count the seven clean days. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>the Sages’</b> intentions <b>were merely to be in seclusion [<i>meyaḥadi</i>] with</b> the woman but not to engage in intercourse with her. Therefore, it was permitted to marry her even if she became ritually impure. Being in seclusion with a woman was sufficient to help the Sages avoid any forbidden thoughts, <b>as the Master said: One who has bread in his basket is incomparable to one who does not have bread in his basket,</b> i.e., just as the knowledge that food is readily available is sufficient to psychologically alleviate one’s feelings of hunger, so too, the knowledge that one’s sexual desires could be met lessens the strength of the desire itself.

### Part 10
The Gemara cites an additional statement of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov: It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: A man should not marry his wife</b> when at the same time <b>his intention is to divorce her, because it is stated: “Do not devise evil against your neighbor, as he dwells securely with you”</b> (Proverbs 3:29). It is wrong for one to intend to undermine the feelings of security that another has with him.

### Part 11
§ The mishna raises a case in which a <i>yavam</i> consummated the levirate marriage with his <i>yevama</i> and seven months later she gave birth. With respect to that child, there is an uncertainty whether he is the child of the deceased brother or whether he is the child of the <i>yavam</i>. The Gemara discusses the ramifications of this uncertainty in a dispute concerning inheritance. The case concerns one whose identity as the son of the deceased is <b>uncertain, and a <i>yavam</i></b> who consummated the levirate marriage with the <i>yevama</i>, <b>who</b> both <b>came to divide up</b> the <b>possessions of the deceased</b> brother and each one claims to be the sole heir.

### Part 12
The one of <b>uncertain</b> descent <b>said: I am the son of the deceased, and</b> therefore, as the only heir, his <b>possessions are mine. And the <i>yavam</i> said</b> to him: <b>You are my son, and you have absolutely no</b> rights <b>to</b> the <b>possessions;</b> rather, by virtue of the fact that I consummated the levirate marriage with the widow of the deceased, I should inherit him. The Gemara rules on this case: This <b>is</b> a case of <b>property of uncertain ownership,</b> as there is no way to determine who is the rightful heir, and the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>property of uncertain ownership</b> the claimants <b>divide up</b> between them.

### Part 13
The Gemara brings another case, that of one concerning whom there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether he is the son of the deceased or of the <i>yavam</i> <b>and the sons of</b> the <b><i>yavam</i>,</b> who consummated the levirate marriage with the <i>yevama</i> and has since died, <b>who came to divide up</b> the <b>possessions of the deceased,</b> and each one makes claim to the inheritance. The one of <b>uncertain</b> descent <b>said: That man,</b> referring to himself, <b>is the son of the deceased, and</b> therefore, as his sole heir, his <b>possessions are mine.</b> And the <b>sons of the <i>yavam</i> said</b> to him: <b>You are our brother, and</b> our uncle, the deceased, was not survived by any offspring and so by virtue of our father’s levirate marriage he inherited our uncle’s possessions, and now that our father has died and we are dividing up his possessions <b>you have</b> a right to inherit only <b>a portion</b> of the inheritance <b>together with us.</b>

### Part 14
<b>The Rabbis</b> who studied <b>before Rav Mesharshiyya thought to say:</b> This case <b>is</b> analogous to a case in <b>a mishna, as we learned</b> a similar case in a mishna (100a) in which a woman gave birth shortly after remarrying and there is uncertainty whether the child’s father is the first or second husband. The mishna considers a case in which the husbands died and were each survived by a set of sons: If a son from either set died, the other sons of that set will inherit from him because as brothers they have an uncontested claim to the inheritance. However, <b>he,</b> the son of uncertain descent, <b>does not inherit</b> from <b>them</b> because his claim as a brother is uncertain and is therefore not powerful enough to allow him to take part of the inheritance from the other sons. <b>However,</b> if the son of uncertain descent died, <b>they,</b> the sons of both husbands, <b>will</b> jointly <b>inherit</b> from <b>him.</b> The claims of each set of sons to be his brothers are equally uncertain; therefore, since there is no one who has a definite claim to his inheritance, his possessions are split between them.

### Part 15
The Rabbis qualify their comparison of the cases: <b>But here,</b> the positions are <b>in reverse,</b> as follows: <b>There,</b> in the case of the mishna, when one of the sons dies, <b>they,</b> the other sons of that set, can <b>say to him,</b> the son of uncertain descent: <b>Bring proof</b> that you are actually a son of our father <b>and</b> only then can you <b>take</b> a portion. Since he cannot prove this, he will not receive any of the inheritance.

### Part 16
However, <b>here,</b> in the case where the son of uncertain descent is in dispute with the sons of the <i>yavam</i>, <b>he,</b> the son of uncertain descent, can <b>say to them: Bring proof</b> that I am not the son of the deceased, <b>and</b> only then can you <b>take</b> a portion together with me. The Rabbis claim that the principle in both cases is identical: When one party has an uncontested claim to the inheritance, and another party advances a claim to receive part of the inheritance that is based on an uncertainty, the uncertain claim is not accepted. In the mishna’s case, it is the son of uncertain descent who has an uncertain claim. The Rabbis suggest that the reverse is true in the Gemara’s case: The son of uncertain decent has an uncontested claim to the inheritance because whether he is the son of the first or second husband, he certainly has a right to some inheritance. It is the sons of the <i>yavam</i> who have an uncertain claim because they have a right to the inheritance only if the son of uncertain decent is actually their brother.

### Part 17
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya said to them: Is</b> the case in the mishna really <b>comparable? There,</b> in the mishna’s case, when one of the sons dies, <b>they,</b> the other sons in that set, have a <b>definite</b> claim to the inheritance, since their claim is based on the fact that they are the dead son’s brothers, which is certainly true, <b>and he,</b> the son of uncertain descent, only has an <b>uncertain</b> claim. However, <b>here, each</b> party has only an <b>uncertain</b> claim. Although the son of uncertain descent claims that ultimately, whatever the nature of his relationship with the deceased is, he should have the right to inherit, nevertheless, since it is not actually known what that relationship is, his claim in reality is merely a composite of uncertain claims.

### Part 18
Having rejected the analogy offered by the Rabbis, Rav Mesharshiyya offers his own analogy to the case in the mishna that the Rabbis cited: <b>Rather, if</b> there is a case that <b>is analogous to</b> the case in <b>the mishna,</b> then it is <b>to this</b> following case that it is <b>analogous:</b> It is comparable <b>to</b> a case in which following the levirate marriage a son was born, and there is uncertainty whether he is the son of the deceased or of the <i>yavam</i>, and that son of <b>uncertain</b> descent <b>and</b> the <b>sons of the <i>yavam</i> come to divide up</b> the <b>possessions of the <i>yavam</i> himself. As there,</b> those who are unquestionably the sons of the <i>yavam</i> have a definite claim; therefore, <b>they</b> can <b>say to him,</b> the son of uncertain descent: <b>Bring proof that you are</b> actually <b>our brother and</b> only then can you <b>take</b> a portion. Since he cannot prove this, he will not receive any of the inheritance.

### Part 19
The Gemara brings yet another case, that of one concerning whom there is an <b>uncertainty</b> whether he is the son of the deceased or of the <i>yavam</i> <b>and</b> the <b>sons of the <i>yavam</i>,</b> i.e., the sons of the man who consummated the levirate marriage with the <i>yevama</i> and has since died, <b>who came to divide up</b> the <b>possessions of the <i>yavam</i> after the <i>yavam</i> had</b> already <b>divided up</b> the <b>possessions of the deceased</b> brother between himself and the son of uncertain descent, as per the Gemara’s ruling in the first case above.

### Part 20
The <i>yavam</i> then died and his sons and the son of uncertain descent each made a claim to the inheritance: <b>The sons of the <i>yavam</i> say</b> to the son of uncertain descent: <b>Bring proof that you are our brother, and</b> only then can you <b>take</b> a portion. The son of <b>uncertain</b> descent <b>said to them: Whichever way you</b> look at it, I should receive a portion of the inheritance. <b>If</b> you assume that <b>I am your brother,</b> then <b>give me a portion</b> of the inheritance <b>together with</b> all of <b>you, and if</b> you assume that <b>I am the son of the deceased,</b> then <b>give me the half</b> of the possessions <b>that your father</b> took when he <b>divided up</b> the possessions <b>with me</b> upon the deceased’s death, because if you assume I am his son, then I am his sole heir and your father never had any rights to his possessions.

### Part 21
The son of uncertain descent’s claim assumes that the original verdict to divide up the possessions of the deceased between the two sides may be reexamined in light of later developments. This assumption, however, is subject to a dispute: <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav</b> said: <b>The</b> original <b>verdict stands,</b> i.e., the original division of the deceased’s possessions is considered a closed matter, and the new dispute concerning the possessions of the <i>yavam</i> is considered independently of it. Accordingly, the son of uncertain descent’s claim cannot succeed, and so he receives no portion of the inheritance of the <i>yavam</i>. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: The</b> original <b>verdict is reconsidered</b> in light of the new circumstances, and therefore in this case the son of uncertain descent can put forward his undeniable claim to some of the possessions of the <i>yavam</i> based on the original uncertainties that existed with regard to the division of the deceased’s possessions.

### Part 22
<b>Let us say that</b> Rabbi Abba and Rabbi Yirmeya <b>disagree over the dispute between Admon and the Rabbis. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 109b): With regard to <b>one</b> who owns a field and has the rights to a path that passes through land belonging to another, and <b>he traveled to a country overseas, and</b> when he returned the <b>path to his field was lost,</b> i.e., he forgot where the path was located, <b>Admon says: He may go</b> only <b>on the shortest</b> path to his field, as although it is not known where the path is, he definitely did have a path, and therefore at the very least he has a right to the shortest path. <b>The Rabbis say: He must</b> either <b>purchase for himself</b> a new <b>path for</b> whatever price is asked, even if it is <b>one hundred dinars, or he will</b> have to <b>fly through the air</b> to reach his field, i.e., as long as he cannot prove where the original path was, he has no rights to any other path.

### Part 23
<b>And we discussed</b> the mishna and thereby established the parameters of the dispute as follows: It is difficult <b>for the Rabbis</b> because <b>Admon is saying well,</b> i.e., the logic of his opinion would seem to be compelling. <b>And</b> in defense of the Rabbis’ opinion, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: With what are we dealing here?</b> It is with a case <b>where</b> his field was <b>surrounded by four individuals</b> who owned the land <b>on</b> each of its <b>four sides.</b> Therefore, he cannot demand a path from any one of the surrounding owners, since each one can deflect his claim by suggesting that the path might have passed through one of the other owners’ land.

### Part 24
However, this creates a further difficulty: <b>If so,</b> that the surrounding land is owned by different people, <b>what is Admon’s rationale</b> for ruling that the owner of the field has a claim to the shortest path? <b>And</b> in order to justify Admon’s opinion, <b>Rava said: With regard to</b> a case in which there are <b>four</b> current owners <b>who came</b> to own their land <b>on the basis of</b> purchase from <b>four</b> previous owners, i.e., each of the current owners acquired their land from a different previous owner, <b>and</b> also in a case in which there are <b>four</b> current owners <b>who came</b> to own their land <b>on the basis of</b> purchase from <b>one</b> previous owner who originally owned all four pieces of land, <b>everyone agrees that</b> the current owners <b>are able to deflect him</b> and his claim to a path.

### Part 25
<b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>in</b> a case in <b>which</b> there is only <b>one</b> current owner of all four pieces of land, <b>who came</b> to own his land <b>on the basis of</b> purchase from <b>four</b> previous owners. <b>Admon holds</b> that the owner of the field <b>can say to</b> the current owner of the surrounding land: <b>Whichever way</b> you construe the case, <b>my path</b> to my field is somewhere <b>with you</b> in the surrounding land. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that the owner of the surrounding land can deflect this claim because <b>he can say to him: If you</b> do not press your claim and <b>are silent,</b> then <b>be silent,</b> and I will sell you a path at a reasonable price. <b>But if not,</b> and you insist on pressing your claim, then <b>I will return the bills</b> of purchase of the land <b>to their</b> previous <b>owners, and</b> then <b>you will not be able to</b> successfully <b>engage in a legal dispute with them,</b> as each one could claim that the path went through one of the other pieces of land not owned by them.

### Part 26
Having established the parameters of the dispute, the Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the statement of <b>Rabbi Abba, who said</b> that the original verdict stands, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> When the owner of the field forgot where his path was located, the surrounding land was owned by four different owners, and therefore at that time the verdict was that he had no ability to successfully claim his path. The Rabbis apparently assume that that verdict stands, and therefore the field owner is considered to have lost any rights to the path. Consequently, even if the surrounding pieces of land are later purchased by a single person, the owner of the field cannot make a claim for his path.

### Part 27
The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yirmeya, who said</b> that the original verdict is repealed, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Admon.</b> Admon apparently assumes that although the original verdict was that the field owner has no ability to successfully claim his path, nevertheless, that does not mean he loses his rights to the path. Rather, once the situation changes and the surrounding pieces of land are purchased by a single person, the original uncertainty is revived to allow him to make a claim for at least the shortest path to his field.

### Part 28
The Gemara rejects the comparison: <b>Rabbi Abba</b> could have <b>said to you: When I stated</b> my ruling, it was <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Admon. Admon states</b> his ruling <b>only there,</b> in the case of the lost path, <b>because</b> the field owner <b>said to</b> the owner of the surrounding land: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it,
