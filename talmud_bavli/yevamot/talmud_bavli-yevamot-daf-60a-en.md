### Part 1
<b>that he does not pay the fine of a seduced</b> woman. One who seduced a woman and does not wish to marry her must pay a fine (see Exodus 22:14–15). Since in this case he did marry her, he is not liable to pay the fine even though he is required to divorce her.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates that when <b>Rav Geviha went from Bei Ketil he stated</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> before Rav Ashi,</b> who <b>said to him: Isn’t it Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan who both say:</b> A High Priest <b>may not marry a grown woman and a woman whose hymen was torn accidentally, but if he married</b> one of them <b>he is married?</b>

### Part 3
<b>Apparently,</b> the reason for this <i>halakha</i> is that since <b>she will eventually be a grown woman under him,</b> i.e., while married to him, and <b>she will eventually be a woman whose hymen was torn under him,</b> as she will not remain a virgin, they are permitted to remain married after the fact. <b>Here too,</b> in the case of a High Priest who married a woman he raped or seduced, since <b>she will eventually be a non-virgin under him,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should be understood as stating that they may remain married. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, this is <b>difficult</b> for Rav Huna.

### Part 4
§ The <i>baraita</i> cited above taught: With regard to a woman who was <b>raped by another</b> man <b>and</b> a woman <b>seduced by another</b> man, the High Priest <b>may not marry</b> her. <b>And if he married</b> her, <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says</b> that <b>the child</b> born from this union <b>is a <i>ḥalal</i>, and the Rabbis say</b> the lineage of <b>the offspring is unflawed. Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. And, so too, Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Some say</b> a different version of this statement. <b>Rav Huna said that Rav said: What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov? He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> that an unmarried man who has intercourse with an unmarried woman has thereby caused her to become a <i>zona</i>. Consequently, since the other man had intercourse with this woman outside of the context of marriage, she is a <i>zona</i>.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>Does</b> he really <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Elazar? <b>Don’t we maintain</b> that <b>the teaching of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov</b> measures <b>a <i>kav</i> but is clean,</b> i.e., not many of his rulings have been recorded, but those that have been recorded are considered authoritative, and the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with his opinion? <b>However, with regard to this</b> ruling of Rabbi Elazar, <b>Rav Amram said that Rav said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with Rabbi Elazar.</b> The Gemara comments: This is indeed <b>difficult.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> This is not the reason for the dispute. Rather, they <b>disagree with regard to whether there is a <i>ḥalal</i> from</b> a relationship for which the man and woman are <b>liable for</b> transgressing <b>a positive mitzva.</b> The marriage of a High Priest to a non-virgin is a violation of the mitzva that a High Priest marry a virgin, but it is not expressed in the Torah as a prohibition against a High Priest marrying a non-virgin. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov holds</b> that <b>there is a <i>ḥalal</i> from</b> a relationship for which the man and woman are <b>liable for</b> violating <b>a positive mitzva, and the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>there is no <i>ḥalal</i> from</b> a relationship for which the man and woman are <b>liable for</b> violating <b>a positive mitzva.</b>

### Part 8
<b>What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov? As it is written: “A widow, or one divorced, or a <i>ḥalala</i>, or a <i>zona</i>, these shall he not take; but a virgin</b> of his own people shall he take for a wife” (Leviticus 21:14), <b>and it states</b> subsequently: <b>“And he shall not profane his seed among his people”</b> (Leviticus 21:15). Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov maintains that this profanation is referring <b>to all of them,</b> i.e., he profanes his seed by marrying any woman unfit for him, including a non-virgin.

### Part 9
<b>And</b> what do <b>the Sages</b> hold? The word <b>“these” concluded</b> discussion of <b>that matter.</b> Consequently, only the prohibitions listed before the phrase “these shall he not take” result in the offspring being a <i>ḥalal</i>. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov said:</b> The word <b>“these”</b> comes <b>to exclude a menstruating woman.</b> If a priest has relations with a menstruating woman, the offspring is not a <i>ḥalal</i>, as this is not a prohibition specific to priests.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>From</b> the prohibitions preceding the phrase <b>“these</b> shall he not take” <b>you cause</b> your offspring to be <b>a <i>ḥalal</i>, but you do not cause</b> your offspring to be <b>a <i>ḥalal</i></b> by having a child <b>with a menstruating woman. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is it? <b>It is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, let</b> the verse <b>write</b> the word <b>these at the end,</b> after stating that a High Priest must marry a virgin, in order to make it clear that if he marries a non-virgin their child is a <i>ḥalal</i>. The Gemara responds: Indeed, this is <b>difficult.</b>

### Part 11
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to a priest’s <b>betrothed sister, Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda say: He</b> must <b>become impure for her</b> upon her death. <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say: He</b> may <b>not become impure for her.</b> With regard to his sister who has been <b>raped or seduced, all agree</b> that <b>he may not become impure for her</b> upon her death. With regard to his sister <b>whose hymen was torn accidentally, he may not become impure for her;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon, as Rabbi Shimon would say</b> the following principle: If his sister was <b>fit for a High Priest, he</b> must <b>become impure for her,</b> but if she was <b>not fit for a High Priest, he may not become impure for her.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And</b> if his sister was <b>a grown woman, he</b> must <b>become impure for her according to everyone.</b> Even those who hold that a High Priest may not marry a grown woman because her hymen is no longer whole agree that with regard to a priest becoming impure, she is considered a virgin and he must therefore become impure for her upon her death.

### Part 13
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda? They expound</b> the verse <b>as follows:</b> “And for his virgin sister, who is near to him, who has had no man, for her must he defile himself” (Leviticus 21:3). <b>“And for his virgin sister” excludes</b> one who has been <b>raped or seduced,</b> as they are not virgins.

### Part 14
One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I should exclude even a woman whose hymen was torn accidentally</b> via a foreign object. <b>The verse</b> therefore <b>states: “Who has had no man,”</b> to include only <b>one whose becoming</b> a non-virgin was caused <b>by a man,</b> i.e., through intercourse. <b>This</b> case of a woman <b>whose becoming</b> a non-virgin <b>was not</b> caused <b>by a man</b> but rather by an object is thereby <b>excluded</b> from the category of a non-virgin, and her brother does become impure for her. <b>“Who is near”;</b> this is <b>to include a betrothed</b> sister. <b>“To him”;</b> this is <b>to include a grown woman.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I need a verse</b> to include a grown woman? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Meir say</b> that the word <b>“virgin” indicates even</b> a woman who is <b>partly a virgin,</b> i.e., a grown woman, whose hymen is partially intact? Consequently, when the verse states that the priest becomes impure for his virgin sister, a grown woman is included. The Gemara answers: The derivation from the verse is <b>necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>we should derive</b> a verbal analogy from the word <b>“virgin”</b> in this context and the word <b>“virgin” from there,</b> the context of a High Priest: In the analogy, <b>just as there</b> the virgin referred to is <b>a young woman and not a grown woman, so too here</b> she must be <b>a young woman.</b> The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that a priest becomes impure for his sister even if she is a grown woman.

### Part 16
<b>And Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon, what is their reason? They expound as follows: “And for his virgin sister” excludes</b> a woman who was <b>raped or seduced and a woman whose hymen was torn accidentally,</b> who is also not considered a virgin. <b>“Who has had no</b> man” <b>excludes a betrothed</b> sister, although she is not yet fully married. <b>“Who is near”;</b> this is <b>to include a betrothed</b> woman <b>who was</b> then <b>divorced,</b> as she is once again near to her brother. <b>“To him”;</b> this is <b>to include a grown woman.</b> The Gemara asks: Can the term <b>“who is near”</b> come <b>to include a betrothed</b> woman <b>who was divorced?</b>
