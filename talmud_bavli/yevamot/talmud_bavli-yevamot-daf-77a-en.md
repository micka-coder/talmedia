### Part 1
<b>Doeg raised before them all those objections</b> from the others who are disqualified from entering into the congregation, and <b>they were silent,</b> not knowing how to respond. Doeg then <b>wanted to proclaim</b> that David was disqualified from entering into the congregation. He was <b>immediately</b> answered. Here it says: <b>“Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Jithra the Israelite, that went into Abigal the daughter of Nahash”</b> (II Samuel 17:25), <b>and</b> yet elsewhere <b>it is written</b> that Amasa’s father was named <b>“Jether the Ishmaelite”</b> (I Chronicles 2:17). <b>Rava said:</b> This <b>teaches that he girded his sword like Ishmael,</b> i.e., like an Arab, <b>and said: Whoever does not accept this <i>halakha</i></b> and act accordingly <b>shall be stabbed with the sword. This is</b> the tradition that <b>I received from the court of Samuel from Rama: An Ammonite</b> man is prohibited from entering into the congregation, <b>but not an Ammonite woman; a Moabite</b> man is prohibited from entering into the congregation, <b>but not a Moabite woman.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks about this incident: <b>And is he trusted</b> to offer such testimony? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Abba say</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>every Torah scholar who issues a halakhic ruling</b> based on a tradition he claims to have received from his teacher, and that ruling has practical ramifications for himself as well, <b>if he stated</b> the ruling already <b>before the incident,</b> i.e., before it had a bearing on his own case, <b>one listens to him; but if not,</b> if he reported the tradition only after it was personally relevant to him, <b>one does not listen to him,</b> as he is an interested party. Since Amasa was the son of Jesse’s daughter Abigail, as stated in the aforementioned verse in Chronicles, the matter certainly affected his own status. The Gemara answers: <b>Here it is different, as Samuel and</b> the other members of <b>his court were</b> still <b>living,</b> and the truth of Amasa’s report could be easily verified.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>In any case,</b> the unanswered question raised by Doeg is <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they explained</b> the matter based on the verse: <b>“The king’s daughter is all glorious within”</b> (Psalms 45:14), which indicates that it is unbefitting for a woman to venture outside at all, and therefore the Ammonite women would not have been expected to go forth to meet the Jewish women. <b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> who said: <b>The verse states: “And they said to him: Where is Sarah your wife?</b> And he said: Behold, in the tent” (Genesis 18:9), which teaches that it is praiseworthy for a woman to remain inside her home.

### Part 4
The Gemara comments that this disagreement with regard to the source of the <i>halakha</i> that it is permitted for an Ammonite or Moabite woman to enter into the congregation is <b>like the</b> following dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>:</b> The verse states: “An Ammonite or a Moabite” (Deuteronomy 23:4); <b>an Ammonite</b> man is barred from entering into the congregation, <b>but not an Ammonite woman,</b> and similarly, <b>a Moabite</b> man is barred from entering into the congregation, <b>but not a Moabite woman.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who derives the <i>halakha</i> from the masculine form of these two terms. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse states: <b>“Because they did not meet you with bread and with water</b> on the way” (Deuteronomy 23:5). Since <b>it is the way of a man,</b> but not the way of a woman, to go forth <b>to meet</b> guests, females were not included in the prohibition.

### Part 5
With regard to the same issue, <b>Rava taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “You have loosened my bands”</b> (Psalms 116:16)? <b>David said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, You have loosened the two bands that were on me,</b> on account of which I and my entire family might have been disqualified, i.e., <b>Ruth the Moabite woman and Na’ama the Ammonite woman.</b> Owing to the allowance granted to Moabite and Ammonite women, we are permitted to enter the congregation.

### Part 6
<b>Rava</b> further <b>taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Many things have You done, O Lord my God, Your wonders and Your thoughts are upon us”</b> (Psalms 40:6)? <b>Upon me is not stated, but</b> rather <b>“upon us,”</b> which <b>teaches that Rehoboam,</b> son of Solomon and grandson of David, was <b>sitting on the lap of David,</b> who <b>said to him: These two verses were stated about me and about you,</b> as Rehoboam’s mother was Na’ama the Ammonite.

### Part 7
With regard to the same issue, <b>Rava</b> also <b>taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Then I said: Behold, I have come; in the scroll of a book it is written about me”</b> (Psalms 40:8)? <b>David said: I</b> had <b>said</b> that <b>I have come</b> only <b>now;</b> my life was created only recently, at the time of my birth. <b>But I did not know that it was</b> already <b>written about me in the scroll of a book,</b> that an ancient text already hints at my existence. <b>There,</b> with regard to the daughters of Lot, <b>it is written:</b> “And your two daughters <b>that are found</b> here” (Genesis 19:15), and <b>here,</b> with regard to David, <b>it is written: “I have found David, My servant; I have anointed him with My holy oil”</b> (Psalms 89:21). The lost article that was found among the daughters of Lot, the mothers of Ammon and Moab, is David and his royal house.

### Part 8
<b>Ulla said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The daughter of an Ammonite convert is fit</b> not only to marry an ordinary Israelite, but even <b>to</b> marry into <b>the priesthood. Rava bar Ulla said to Ulla: In accordance with whose</b> opinion did you state this <i>halakha</i>? <b>If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, didn’t he say</b> that <b>the daughter of a male convert is like the daughter of a male <i>ḥalal</i>,</b> one rendered unfit for the priesthood, which means that the daughter of any convert should be disqualified from the priesthood? <b>And if</b> you spoke <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> it <b>is obvious</b> that this is the case, <b>as he said</b> that <b>even</b> if <b>a male convert marries a female convert, his daughter is fit to</b> marry into <b>the priesthood.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And if you would say</b> that Rabbi Yosei spoke only <b>of those</b> converts <b>who are fit to enter into the congregation, but</b> with regard to <b>this one,</b> an Ammonite convert, <b>who is not fit to enter into the congregation,</b> his daughter is <b>not</b> fit to marry a priest, there is a difficulty: <b>From where</b> does <b>he</b> derive this distinction?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> this <b>from</b> the case of <b>a High Priest</b> who married <b>a widow,</b> a woman whom he is prohibited from marrying. Just as his daughter is disqualified from marrying into the priesthood, so too is the daughter of an Ammonite convert disqualified from marrying into the priesthood. However, an objection may be raised: <b>What</b> comparison can be made to <b>a High Priest</b> who married <b>a widow,</b> which is a stringent prohibition, <b>as his intercourse involves a transgression?</b> Can one say the same with regard to the daughter of an Ammonite convert, who could be born from a permitted relationship, e.g., from a male Ammonite convert who married a female Ammonite convert?

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>Let</b> the case of <b>a <i>ḥalal</i> prove</b> that this is not relevant, as his intercourse does not involve a transgression and yet his children are also <i>ḥalalim</i>, who are prohibited from marrying into the priesthood. However, another objection may be raised: <b>What</b> comparison can be made to <b>a <i>ḥalal</i>,</b> seeing <b>that his</b> essential <b>formation involved a transgression,</b> and therefore it is understandable that his disqualification extends to his offspring. Can one say the same with regard to the daughter of an Ammonite convert who was not the product of a forbidden union?

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>Let</b> the case of <b>a High Priest</b> who marries a widow <b>prove</b> that this is not relevant, as he was not the product of a forbidden union but nevertheless his daughter is disqualified from marrying into the priesthood. <b>And the derivation has reverted</b> to its starting point, and the discussion can go back and forth.

### Part 13
At this point, however, the <i>halakha</i> can be derived from a combination of the two sources: <b>The aspect of this</b> case, that of a High Priest, <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> case, that of a <i>ḥalal</i>, <b>and the aspect of that</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> case; <b>their common denominator is that he is not included in the majority of the congregation,</b> i.e., the man is governed by a <i>halakha</i> that differs from that of most Jews. The High Priest’s intercourse with a widow involves a transgression, and the <i>ḥalal</i> is the product of a forbidden union. <b>And</b> in each case, the man’s <b>daughter is disqualified</b> from marrying into the priesthood. <b>So too,</b> an Ammonite convert <b>is not included in the majority of the congregation,</b> as it is prohibited for him to enter the congregation of Israel, <b>and</b> so <b>his daughter is</b> also <b>disqualified</b> from marrying into the priesthood.

### Part 14
The Gemara objects: <b>What</b> is <b>the common denominator</b> between the case of the High Priest and that of the <i>ḥalal</i> that prevents one from utilizing it as a paradigm for other cases? Both of those cases <b>include an aspect of transgression;</b> the High Priest engaged in a forbidden act of intercourse, and the <i>ḥalal</i> is the product of a forbidden union. Perhaps that is the reason that the daughter in each of these cases is prohibited from marrying into the priesthood. In the case of the Ammonite convert, however, there is no transgression.

### Part 15
The Gemara answers: <b>Perhaps you spoke of an Ammonite</b> convert <b>who married the daughter of a Jew,</b> and Rabbi Yoḥanan wished to teach that <b>although his intercourse involves a transgression,</b> as it is prohibited for him to enter into the congregation, <b>his daughter is</b> nevertheless <b>fit</b> to marry into the priesthood. Ulla <b>said to him: Yes,</b> this was Rabbi Yoḥanan’s teaching.

### Part 16
<b>As, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>the daughter of an Ammonite convert</b> who is the offspring of his forbidden marriage with a woman of Jewish birth, <b>and</b> similarly, with regard to <b>the daughter of a second-</b>generation <b>Egyptian</b> convert from his forbidden marriage with a woman of Jewish birth, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that she is <b>fit</b> to marry into the priesthood, <b>whereas Reish Lakish said</b> that she is <b>disqualified</b> from marrying a priest. <b>Reish Lakish said</b> she is <b>disqualified, as he derives from</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>a High Priest</b> who married <b>a widow</b> that the daughter of any forbidden union is disqualified from the priesthood. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> she is <b>fit,</b>
