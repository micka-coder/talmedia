### Part 1
<b>this is Ḥadyab. The river of Gozan; this is Ginzak. And the cities of the Medes; this is Ḥamadan and its surroundings. And some say: This is Nihar and its surroundings.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Which are its surroundings? Shmuel said: Kerakh, Mushkhei, Ḥidkei, and Domakya</b> are the surroundings of Ḥamadan. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And all of them are for disqualification.</b> In other words, if someone from one of these places wishes to convert, there is concern that he might be a descendant of a Jew and therefore a <i>mamzer</i>. Consequently, they all are disqualified.

### Part 2
Rav Yehuda continued his recounting: <b>When I said this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that there is a concern about the betrothal of gentiles nowadays, <b>before Shmuel, he said to me:</b> One need not worry about this, as <b>your son from a Jewish woman is called your son,</b> i.e., he inherits his lineage from you, <b>and your son from a gentile woman is not called your son,</b> but <b>rather her son.</b> Consequently, all children born to Jews from gentile women are not considered Jews, as their lineage is determined by their gentile mothers.

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>Aren’t there</b> Jewish <b>girls</b> who were captured by gentiles, whose children are considered to be Jews? <b>And Ravina said: Learn from this</b> that <b>the son of your daughter from a gentile is called your son.</b> If so, the descendants of Jewish women captured by gentiles would indeed be Jews. The Gemara answers: This is no concern, as it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that the girls</b> from the ten tribes <b>of that generation became barren</b> and did not give birth to any offspring, whereas some of the exiled men of the ten tribes married gentile women. Consequently, all of the children born there were gentiles.

### Part 4
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rav Yehuda actually related the following: <b>When I said this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>before Shmuel, he said to me: They did not move from there,</b> the place where they deliberated on this matter, <b>until they rendered</b> all of <b>them,</b> including those who intermingled with the ten tribes in different locations, <b>full-fledged gentiles.</b> Consequently, there is no concern that their betrothals might be of any effect, <b>as it is stated: “They have dealt treacherously against the Lord, for they have begotten strange children”</b> (Hosea 5:7).

### Part 5
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yosef sat behind Rav Kahana, and Rav Kahana sat before Rav Yehuda, and he sat and he said</b> this tradition: <b>In the future, the Jews will establish a Festival day when Tarmod is destroyed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But it has</b> already <b>been destroyed.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> place that was destroyed <b>was Tamud,</b> not Tarmod. <b>Rav Ashi said: Tarmod is</b> the same as <b>Tamud.</b> However, the city <b>is doubled.</b> In other words, when it <b>is destroyed from this side it is settled on that side, and</b> when it <b>is destroyed from that side it is settled on this side.</b> Consequently, it has not yet been entirely destroyed.

### Part 6
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Hamnuna sat before Ulla and was engaged in</b> the study of <b><i>halakha</i>.</b> Ulla <b>said</b> about him: <b>What a man; what a man.</b> In other words: What a great man this Rav Hamnuna is. <b>If only Harpanya were not his city,</b> as the inhabitants of that place are all of flawed lineage, which indicates that the lineage of Rav Hamnuna is likewise impaired. Rav Hamnuna <b>was ashamed.</b> Ulla <b>said to him: Where do you give the money for</b> payment of the <b>poll</b> tax? <b>He said to him:</b> I pay it <b>to</b> the city of <b>Pum Nahara,</b> as my city is subject to taxation by that city. <b>He said to him: If so, you are from Pum Nahara,</b> not Harpanya, and your lineage is evidently not flawed.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the name <b>Harpanya? Rabbi Zeira said:</b> It means <b>the mountain to which all turn [<i>har shehakol ponin bo</i>].</b> In other words, it is the destination for all those who could not find wives anywhere else, as most of its population is of flawed lineage. <b>It is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: All those who do not know their family or tribe turn there. Rava said: This</b> type of flaw is appalling and <b>is deeper than the netherworld, as is stated: “Shall I ransom them from the power of the netherworld? Shall I redeem them from death?”</b> (Hosea 13:14). This verse indicates that it is possible to be ransomed and released from the netherworld, <b>whereas their disqualification cannot be rectified.</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara comments: <b>Those</b> who are <b>disqualified from Harpanya</b> are unfit <b>due to the disqualification</b> of the inhabitants <b>of</b> nearby <b>Meishon,</b> who were unfit and intermarried with the residents of Harpanya. <b>Those disqualified from Meishon</b> are unfit <b>due to those disqualified from Tarmod, and those disqualified from Tarmod</b> are disqualified <b>due to the servants of Solomon.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara comments: <b>And this</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say</b> in this regard: <b>A large ephah and a small ephah,</b> which are both inaccurate utensils that may not be used for measuring, <b>roll onward to the netherworld, and from the netherworld to Tarmod, and from Tarmod to Meishon, and from Meishon to Harpanya.</b> The same idea expressed by the Sages with regard to the disqualification of lineage was also incorporated into a well-known adage among commoners.
