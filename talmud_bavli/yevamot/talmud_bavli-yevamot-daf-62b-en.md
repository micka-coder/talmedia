### Part 1
<b>Grandchildren are</b> considered <b>like children.</b> This indicates that if one’s children have passed away, he has fulfilled the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply only if they had children of their own, as they are considered like his own children. The Gemara responds: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught</b> it is with regard <b>to completing</b> the required number of children, e.g., if he had only a son, but his son had a daughter, he has fulfilled the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply.

### Part 2
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Huna from another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Grandchildren are</b> considered <b>like children.</b> If <b>one of</b> a man’s children <b>died or was discovered</b> to be <b>a eunuch,</b> the father has <b>not fulfilled</b> the mitzva to be <b>fruitful and multiply.</b> This directly contradicts Rav Huna’s statement that one fulfills the mitzva even if his children die. The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Huna is</b> indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>

### Part 3
§ It was taught in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>grandchildren are</b> considered <b>like children. Abaye thought to say</b> that if one’s children die, he fulfills the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply through grandchildren, provided <b>a son</b> was born <b>to</b> his <b>son and a daughter to</b> his <b>daughter, and all the more so</b> if <b>a son</b> was born <b>to</b> his <b>daughter,</b> as his grandchildren take the place of his children in these cases. <b>However,</b> if <b>a daughter</b> was born <b>to</b> his <b>son, no,</b> she cannot take the place of her father. <b>Rava said to him:</b> We <b>require</b> merely fulfillment of the verse: <b>“He formed it to be inhabited,” and there is</b> fulfillment in this case, as the earth is inhabited by his descendants.

### Part 4
The Gemara comments: <b>In any event, everyone</b> agrees that if one has <b>two</b> grandchildren <b>from one</b> child, <b>no,</b> he has not fulfilled the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply, even if he has both a grandson and a granddaughter. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> has he <b>not? Didn’t the Rabbis say to Rav Sheshet: Marry a woman and have sons,</b> as you have not yet fathered any sons, <b>and</b> Rav Sheshet <b>said to them: The sons of my daughter are my sons?</b> This indicates that one can fulfill the mitzva through grandchildren even if he did not have a son and daughter of his own.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> Rav Sheshet <b>was</b> merely <b>putting them off.</b> The real reason he did not want to get remarried was <b>because Rav Sheshet became impotent from Rav Huna’s discourse.</b> Rav Huna’s discourses were so lengthy that Rav Sheshet became impotent after waiting for so long without relieving himself.

### Part 6
<b>Rabba said to Rava bar Mari: From where is this matter that the Sages stated</b> derived, that <b>grandchildren are</b> considered <b>like children? If we say</b> it is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written</b> in Laban’s speech to Jacob: <b>“The daughters are my daughters and the children are my children”</b> (Genesis 31:43), which indicates that Jacob’s children were also considered to be the children of their grandfather Laban, <b>if</b> that is <b>so,</b> does the continuation of Laban’s statement: <b>“And the flocks are my flocks”</b> (Genesis 31:43), indicate that <b>so too,</b> Jacob’s flocks were considered as belonging to Laban? <b>Rather,</b> Laban was saying <b>that you,</b> Jacob, <b>acquired</b> them <b>from me. Here too,</b> with regard to the children, Laban was saying: <b>You acquired</b> them <b>from me,</b> i.e., it is only due to me that you have children.

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> the proof is <b>from here: “And afterward Hezron went in to the daughter of Machir, the father of Gilead…and she bore him Segub”</b> (I Chronicles 2:21), <b>and it is written: “Out of Machir came down governors”</b> (Judges 5:14), <b>and it is written: “Judah is my governor”</b> (Psalms 60:9). Consequently, the governors, who were from the tribe of Judah, were also called the sons of Machir, who was from the tribe of Manasseh. This must be because they were the children of Machir’s daughter and Hezron, indicating that grandchildren are considered like children.

### Part 8
§ The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua. As it is taught in a</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> If <b>a man married a woman in his youth,</b> and she passed away, <b>he should marry</b> another <b>woman in his old age.</b> If <b>he had children in his youth, he should have</b> more <b>children in his old age, as it is stated: “In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not withhold your hand; for you do not know which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both alike shall be good”</b> (Ecclesiastes 11:6). This verse indicates that a man should continue having children even after he has fulfilled the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that the verse should be understood as follows: If one <b>studied Torah in his youth he should study</b> more <b>Torah in his old age;</b> if <b>he had students in his youth he should have</b> additional <b>students in his old age, as it is stated: “In the morning sow your seed, etc.” They said</b> by way of example that <b>Rabbi Akiva had twelve thousand pairs of students</b> in an area of land that stretched <b>from Gevat to Antipatris</b> in Judea, <b>and they all died in one period</b> of time, <b>because they did not treat each other with respect.</b>

### Part 10
<b>And the world was desolate</b> of Torah <b>until Rabbi Akiva came to our Rabbis in the South and taught</b> his Torah <b>to them.</b> This second group of disciples consisted of <b>Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Yosei, Rabbi Shimon, and Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua. And these are the very ones</b> who <b>upheld</b> the study of <b>Torah at that time.</b> Although Rabbi Akiva’s earlier students did not survive, his later disciples were able to transmit the Torah to future generations.

### Part 11
With regard to the twelve thousand pairs of Rabbi Akiva’s students, the Gemara adds: It is <b>taught</b> that <b>all of them died</b> in the period <b>from Passover until <i>Shavuot</i>. Rav Ḥama bar Abba said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin: They all died a bad death.</b> The Gemara inquires: <b>What is it</b> that is called a bad death? <b>Rav Naḥman said: Diphtheria.</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rav Mattana said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who said that one must attempt to have more children even if he has already fulfilled the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply.

### Part 13
§ Apropos the discussion with regard to the mitzva to have children, the Gemara cites statements about marriage in general. <b>Rabbi Tanḥum said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanilai said: Any man who does not have a wife is</b> left <b>without joy, without blessing, without goodness.</b> He proceeds to quote verses to support each part of his statement. He is <b>without joy, as it is written: “And you shall rejoice, you and your household”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:26), which indicates that the a man is in a joyful state only when he is with his household, i.e., his wife. He is <b>without blessing, as it is written: “To cause a blessing to rest in your house”</b> (Ezekiel 44:30), which indicates that blessing comes through one’s house, i.e., one’s wife. He is <b>without goodness, as it is written: “It is not good that man should be alone”</b> (Genesis 2:18), i.e., without a wife.

### Part 14
<b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, they <b>say:</b> One who lives without a wife is left <b>without Torah,</b> and <b>without a wall</b> of protection. He is <b>without Torah, as it is written: “Is it that I have no help in me, and that sound wisdom is driven from me?”</b> (Job 6:13), indicating that one who does not have a wife lacks sound wisdom, i.e., Torah. He is <b>without a wall, as it is written: “A woman shall go round a man”</b> (Jeremiah 31:21), similar to a protective wall.

### Part 15
<b>Rava bar Ulla said:</b> One who does not have a wife is left <b>without peace, as it is written: “And you shall know that your tent is in peace; and you shall visit your habitation and shall miss nothing”</b> (Job 5:24). This indicates that a man has peace only when he has a tent, i.e., a wife.

### Part 16
On the same verse, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Whoever knows that his wife fears Heaven</b> and she desires him, <b>and he does not visit her,</b> i.e., have intercourse with her, is <b>called a sinner, as it is stated: And you shall know that your tent is in peace;</b> and you shall visit your habitation. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A man is obligated to visit his wife</b> for the purpose of having intercourse <b>when he</b> is about to <b>depart on a journey, as it is stated: “And you shall know that your tent is in peace, etc.”</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: Is <b>this</b> last statement <b>derived from here?</b> It is <b>derived from there: “And your desire shall be to your husband”</b> (Genesis 3:16), which <b>teaches that a wife desires her husband when he is about to depart on a journey. Rav Yosef said:</b> The additional derivation cited by Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>is necessary only near</b> the time of <b>her set pattern,</b> i.e., when she expects to begin experiencing menstrual bleeding. Although the Sages generally prohibited intercourse at this time due to a concern that the couple might have intercourse after she begins bleeding, if he is about to depart on a journey he must have intercourse with her.

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> before the expected onset of menstrual bleeding is considered near the time of her set pattern? <b>Rava said: An interval</b> of time, i.e., half a daily cycle, either a day or a night. The Gemara comments: <b>And this</b> statement that a man must have intercourse with his wife before he departs on a journey <b>applies</b> only if he is traveling <b>for an optional matter, but</b> if he is traveling in order to attend <b>to a matter</b> pertaining to a <b>mitzva,</b> he is not required to have intercourse with his wife so that he not become <b>preoccupied</b> and neglect the mitzva.

### Part 19
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> One <b>who loves his wife as</b> he loves <b>himself, and who honors her more than himself, and who instructs his sons and daughters in an upright path, and who marries them off near the time</b> when <b>they</b> reach maturity, <b>about him the verse states: And you shall know that your tent is in peace.</b> As a result of his actions, there will be peace in his home, as it will be devoid of quarrel and sin. One <b>who loves his neighbors, and who draws his relatives close, and who marries the daughter of his sister,</b> a woman he knows and is fond of as a family relative and not only as a wife,
