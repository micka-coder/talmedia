### Part 1
<b>And they may not become ritually impure</b> with impurity imparted <b>by a corpse,</b> as each of them might be a priest. <b>And they may not marry women, whether unflawed</b> women, who may not marry a slave, <b>or</b> women <b>unfit</b> to marry into the priesthood, as with regard to each of them it is uncertain whether he is a priest or a slave. If <b>the mixed</b> sons <b>matured and freed each other, they may marry women fit</b> to marry <b>into the priesthood,</b> as a freed slave may marry such women. However, neither may marry a woman unfit for the priesthood, in case he is a priest.

### Part 2
<b>And they may not become ritually impure</b> with impurity imparted <b>by a corpse,</b> since they are uncertain priests. <b>However, if they became impure, they do not receive the forty</b> lashes, as each of them might not be priest. <b>And they may not partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as one of them is not a priest. <b>However, if they ate</b> <i>teruma</i> unwittingly <b>they do not pay</b> the <b>principal and the</b> additional <b>fifth,</b> as each of them might be a priest. <b>And they do not receive a share</b> of <i>teruma</i> <b>in the granary,</b> as neither can prove that he is a priest. <b>However, they may sell the <i>teruma</i></b> that they remove from their own produce, <b>and</b> although they may not eat it, <b>the money is theirs.</b> Since it cannot be proven with regard to either of them that he is not a priest, <i>teruma</i> cannot be appropriated from them.

### Part 3
<b>And they do not receive a share of the consecrated</b> offerings <b>of the Temple,</b> as each of them might not be a priest. <b>And one may not give them consecrated</b> offerings to sacrifice for the same reason. <b>However,</b> the hides of <b>their own</b> offerings <b>may not be appropriated from their possession,</b> as it cannot be proven with regard to either of them that he is not a priest.

### Part 4
<b>And they are exempt from</b> giving a priest <b>the foreleg, and from</b> giving him <b>the jaw, and from</b> giving him <b>the maw</b> of their non-consecrated kosher animals. <b>And</b> with regard to either of them, the <b>firstling of his</b> kosher animal <b>should graze until it becomes unfit</b> to be sacrificed, i.e., until it gets a blemish. It is against his interest to sacrifice the animal before it gets a blemish, thereby letting it be eaten by the priests. Once it gets a blemish, it cannot be appropriated from him. Since he is possibly a priest, he may claim that the animal is the property of a priest. The animal then becomes his private property, and he may eat it if he wishes. <b>And</b> in general, <b>we place upon him</b> both <b>the stringencies of priests and the stringencies of Israelites.</b>

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is stated in the mishna that if <b>the</b> sons of certain, <b>unflawed</b> lineage were the <b>ones who died,</b> the mixed sons perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with the widows of the elder woman’s sons, but not levirate marriage. The Gemara asks: Does this indicate that <b>because these</b> sons <b>were mixed up they are</b> rendered <b>unfit?</b> The fact that their lineage is unclear should not render them unfit. <b>Rava Pappa said: Say</b> that the correct wording is: <b>And if the certain</b> sons were the ones who <b>died.</b>

### Part 6
It is stated in the mishna that <b>with</b> the widows of <b>the</b> certain <b>sons of the daughter-in-law, one</b> of the mixed sons <b>performs <i>ḥalitza</i></b> and the other one performs levirate marriage. The Gemara comments that <b><i>ḥalitza</i> is specifically performed</b> first, <b>and afterward levirate marriage. However, levirate marriage is not</b> performed <b>first, because</b> if she is not his own <i>yevama</i> but rather his brother’s daughter-in-law, doing so <b>breaches</b> the prohibition against <b>a <i>yevama</i></b> engaging in intercourse <b>with</b> a member of <b>the public.</b>

### Part 7
§ It is stated in the mishna that in the case of <b>a priestess</b> whose offspring <b>was mixed</b> with her maidservant’s offspring, they receive one share of <i>teruma</i> in the granary. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> it <b>obvious</b> that they receive <b>one share</b> and no more? Rather, <b>say</b> that they receive <b>a share as one,</b> i.e., they receive a share at the granary only if they come together.

### Part 8
The Gemara comments: According to this modification, <b>we</b> have <b>learned</b> in the mishna a ruling that is <b>in accordance with the one who said</b> that <b>one may distribute <i>teruma</i> to a slave only if his master is with him, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may distribute <i>teruma</i> to the slave</b> of a priest who is possibly a priest himself <b>only if his master is with him;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says</b> that <i>teruma</i> is distributed to him alone, even without the accompaniment of his master, as <b>he can say: If I am a priest, give me</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>due to my</b> own priesthood, <b>and if I am the slave of a priest, give me due to my master.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara explains the background behind this dispute: <b>In Rabbi Yehuda’s place, they would elevate</b> a person <b>to</b> the presumptive status of priesthood for the purpose of <b>lineage on</b> the basis of his having received <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> If they saw a person receive <i>teruma</i>, they would assume that he is a priest and testify to that effect. Therefore, <i>teruma</i> was not distributed to someone who might be a slave, unless he was accompanied by his master, lest the slave be assumed to be a priest himself. Conversely, <b>in Rabbi Yosei’s place they would not elevate</b> a person <b>to</b> the presumptive status of priestly <b>lineage</b> on the basis of his having received <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> Therefore, he was allowed to receive <i>teruma</i> independently.

### Part 10
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok said: In</b> all <b>my days I never</b> had the opportunity to <b>testify</b> in court, <b>besides one testimony, and they promoted a slave to</b> the presumptive status of <b>priesthood on</b> the basis of <b>my word.</b> Although they presumably examined the matter carefully, an error occurred.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that <b>they</b> actually <b>promoted</b> him? <b>Now</b> consider: If, even <b>through the animals of the righteous, the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not bring</b> about <b>a stumbling block,</b> then through <b>the righteous themselves, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> so that He does not bring about stumbling blocks?

### Part 12
<b>Rather, say</b> that this is what Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok meant: <b>They sought to promote a slave to</b> the presumptive status of <b>priesthood on</b> the basis of <b>my word.</b> How did this happen? Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok <b>saw</b> a man receiving <i>teruma</i> <b>in Rabbi Yosei’s locale and went and testified in Rabbi Yehuda’s locale</b> about what he saw, not realizing that this testimony would be sufficient grounds to assume that the man is a priest. Since <i>teruma</i> is distributed there only to priests, the slave was almost promoted to the presumptive status of priesthood erroneously.

### Part 13
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> There are <b>ten</b> types of priests <b>to whom one may not distribute <i>teruma</i> in the granary, and they are: A deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, a person whose sexual organs are concealed [<i>tumtum</i>], and a hermaphrodite, and a slave, and a woman, and an uncircumcised man, and a ritually impure man, and</b> one who <b>marries a woman</b> who is <b>unfit for him,</b> i.e., who is unfit to marry a priest. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of them, one may send</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>to them, to their homes, with the exception of a ritually impure man and</b> one who <b>marries a woman</b> who is <b>unfit for him.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> <i>teruma</i> may not be distributed to <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor,</b> as <b>they are not competent,</b> and it is unbecoming to give them <i>teruma</i> in public. It is <b>also</b> inappropriate to distribute <i>teruma</i> to <b>a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite,</b>
