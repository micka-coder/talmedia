### Part 1
<b>There,</b> in that mishna, <b>if</b> it is <b>according to the one who said</b> that the levirate <b>bond is substantial,</b> then <b>there is a bond</b> in that case, as two sisters were certainly married to the brothers and require levirate marriage. <b>And if</b> it is <b>according to the one who said that it is prohibited to nullify the levirate mitzva</b> through marrying the sister of the <i>yevama</i>, then the explanation of that mishna is that <b>it is prohibited to nullify the levirate mitzva</b> and for this reason they must perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and may not enter into levirate marriage. However, <b>here,</b> in this mishna, there is uncertainty concerning the betrothal such that with regard to <b>each one</b> of the brothers, one could <b>say that</b> possibly he <b>encountered his own</b> <i>yevama</i>. Perhaps each brother took his own brother’s wife in levirate marriage, and for this reason the Sages did not issue a decree.

### Part 2
§ The mishna states that if <b>they married</b> their wives <b>before</b> consulting the court, the <b>court does not remove them</b> from the marriage. <b>Sheila teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> that clarifies the mishna: <b>And</b> this is the case <b>even</b> if <b>both of</b> the brothers were <b>priests.</b> A woman who performed <i>ḥalitza</i> is normally forbidden to a priest, yet in this case, although the brother of the other man performed <i>ḥalitza</i>, they are not required to divorce. <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? It is as follows: <b>A <i>ḥalutza</i> is</b> forbidden to a priest by <b>rabbinic law</b> because her status is similar to that of a divorcée, who is forbidden to a priest by Torah law. <b>And</b> in a case of <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether she is a <b><i>ḥalutza</i>,</b> since it may not have been her <i>yavam</i> who performed the ceremony, <b>the Sages did not issue a decree.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> the prohibition against a <b><i>ḥalutza</i></b> marrying a priest really <b>by rabbinic</b> law<b>? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profaned; neither shall they take a woman <b>divorced</b> from her husband; for he is holy unto his God” (Leviticus 21:7). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only a divorcée; from where</b> do I derive that a priest may not marry <b>a <i>ḥalutza</i>? The verse states:</b> “Neither shall they take <b>a woman.”</b> The repetition of the word “woman” extends the <i>halakha</i> to include a <i>ḥalutza</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> prohibition <b>is by rabbinic</b> law, <b>and the verse is a mere support.</b>

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>It is a mitzva for the eldest to consummate the levirate marriage,</b> i.e., the eldest takes precedence over the other brothers, though they too are obligated. <b>But if the younger</b> brother consummated the levirate marriage <b>first, he acquires</b> the <i>yevama</i> as his wife.

### Part 5
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> the following interpretation of the verse: <b>“And it shall be that the firstborn</b> that she bears shall be established in the name of his dead brother and his name will not be blotted out of Israel” (Deuteronomy 25:6). <b>From here</b> the Sages derive <b>that the mitzva to consummate the levirate marriage is upon the eldest.</b> The next phrase: <b>“That she bears,”</b> is interpreted <b>to exclude</b> levirate marriage in the case of a widow who is <b>an <i>aylonit</i>, who cannot bear children.</b> From the next phrase: <b>“Shall be established in the name of his dead brother,”</b> it is derived that the same brother who performs the mitzva of levirate marriage is established in his brother’s name with regard <b>to inheritance,</b> i.e., he inherits his brother’s property.

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> continues and asks: Do <b>you say</b> that he succeeds in the name of his brother <b>for inheritance, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only to</b> inherit <b>his name?</b> If, e.g., the deceased brother was named <b>Yosef, they</b> must <b>call</b> the son born from levirate marriage <b>Yosef,</b> or if his name was <b>Yoḥanan,</b> then <b>they</b> must <b>call him Yoḥanan.</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>It is stated here: “He shall succeed in the name of his brother,” and it is stated there: “They shall be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance”</b> (Genesis 48:6). <b>Just as</b> the word <b>“name” stated there</b> in Genesis is referring explicitly to <b>inheritance, so too,</b> the word <b>“name” stated here</b> in Leviticus means with regard <b>to inheritance.</b>

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> continues to expound the next phrase of the verse: <b>“And his name will not be blotted out</b> of Israel” (Deuteronomy 25:6). This <b>excludes</b> the case where the deceased was <b>a eunuch, as his name is</b> already <b>blotted out,</b> since it is impossible for him to have children.

### Part 8
<b>Rava said: Even though in the entire Torah a verse does not depart from its literal meaning,</b> and even if the Sages offer a homiletical interpretation of the verses, the literal meaning remains intact, <b>here the verbal analogy</b> teaching that the word “name” is referring to inheritance <b>comes to remove</b> the verse <b>from its literal meaning altogether.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>Were it not for the verbal analogy, would I have said</b> that the meaning of the word <b>“name” is the actual name?</b> The verse would be incomprehensible according to the literal reading. <b>Whom is the Merciful One instructing</b> in this verse? To whom does the possessive pronoun in the phrase “his brother” apply? If He is speaking <b>to the <i>yavam</i>, He should have</b> stated: <b>Shall succeed in the name of your dead brother. And if</b> the verse is instructing <b>the court</b> about the <i>halakha</i> in general, <b>it should have</b> said: <b>Shall succeed in the name of his father’s brother.</b>

### Part 10
The Gemara rejects this question: <b>And perhaps this is what the Merciful One is saying to</b> the <b>court: Say to the <i>yavam</i></b> that the child born to him <b>shall be established in the name of his brother.</b> Were it not for the verbal analogy, the verse could have been understood according to its literal meaning. <b>Rather, the verbal analogy comes to remove it</b> from its literal meaning <b>altogether.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara challenges the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Now that you say that the verse:</b> “And it shall be that the firstborn that she bears” <b>is written</b> in reference to <b>the eldest</b> brother, <b>say</b> that <b>the firstborn</b> brother <b>consummates the levirate marriage</b> but that <b>an ordinary</b> brother, i.e., not the firstborn, <b>may not consummate the levirate marriage,</b> and that if the firstborn son is unable to enter into levirate marriage or is no longer alive, no one else may perform the mitzva.

### Part 12
The Gemara answers: <b>If so</b> that the mitzva of levirate marriage applies only to the firstborn, then in the case of <b>a wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist,</b> which <b>the Merciful One excluded</b> by the verse: “If brothers dwell together,” <b>why do I</b> need such an exclusion? If only the firstborn is obligated to perform levirate marriage, then there is no need to separately exclude the case of a wife of one’s brother with whom one did not coexist, because by definition one in that position cannot be the firstborn.

### Part 13
<b>Rav Aḥa refutes</b> the Gemara’s answer: <b>But say that</b> the verse comes <b>to exclude</b> the case of a brother with whom one did not coexist when one is nevertheless <b>the firstborn of the mother,</b> e.g., if the father had two wives. The Gemara rejects this: <b>You cannot say that, as the Merciful One made levirate marriage dependent upon inheritance, and inheritance</b> comes <b>from the father and not from the mother.</b>

### Part 14
The Gemara again challenges the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Then say</b> that <b>when there is a firstborn the mitzva of levirate marriage can be fulfilled</b> by any of the brothers, <b>but that when there is no firstborn,</b> e.g., if he had already died, <b>the mitzva of levirate marriage may not be fulfilled</b> by any of the younger brothers. The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states: “And one of them dies”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), without specifying which brother dies. <b>Are we not dealing</b> even <b>with</b> the case <b>where the firstborn died, and</b> yet <b>the Merciful One states</b> that <b>the younger</b> brother <b>should consummate the levirate marriage?</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara refutes this answer: <b>Say that</b> the case in the Torah is referring to when <b>the younger</b> brother <b>died, and</b> only then <b>the Merciful One states that the firstborn must consummate the levirate marriage.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t the Merciful One</b> explicitly <b>exclude the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist,</b> which can apply only to a brother who was not the firstborn?

### Part 16
The Gemara challenges the <i>halakha</i>: <b>Say</b> that <b>when there is no firstborn</b> brother, if <b>a younger</b> brother <b>went ahead</b> and consummated the levirate marriage, then <b>he acquires</b> his <i>yevama</i> as a wife. <b>But if there is a firstborn,</b> and <b>the younger</b> brother <b>went ahead</b> and performed levirate marriage first, then <b>he does not acquire</b> his <i>yevama</i> as a wife, because the Torah specifies that the firstborn brother must perform the mitzva. The Gemara rejects this: <b>The verse states: “If brothers dwell together”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), implying that <b>the brothers’ dwellings were equated one with the other,</b> and all the brothers are equally obligated in this mitzva.

### Part 17
The Gemara challenges the <i>halakha</i> again: <b>Then say: When there is a firstborn, let</b> the mitzva <b>return to the eldest</b> brother if the other brothers refuse to perform levirate marriage. But <b>when there is no firstborn,</b> the court <b>does not return to the eldest,</b> as the mitzva primarily applies specifically to the firstborn, and if there is no firstborn, none of the brothers take precedence. <b>Why did Abaye the Elder teach: It is a mitzva for the eldest</b> of the brothers <b>to consummate the levirate marriage? If</b> the eldest <b>did not wish</b> to do so, then the court <b>goes to his younger brother.</b> If <b>he</b> also <b>did not wish</b> to do so, the court <b>returns</b> again <b>to the eldest.</b> This implies that the eldest, even if he is not the firstborn, has a greater mitzva than the younger brothers.

### Part 18
The Gemara answers: Since it is derived that the eldest brother takes precedence from the verse about the firstborn, then <b>just as</b> with regard to the firstborn, <b>his status as firstborn causes him</b> to take precedence, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>the eldest, his status as eldest causes him</b> to take precedence.

### Part 19
The Gemara challenges the <i>halakha</i> again: <b>Then say</b> that <b>if the firstborn consummates the levirate marriage he receives</b> his deceased brother’s <b>inheritance,</b> but <b>if an ordinary brother consummates the levirate marriage he does not receive the inheritance.</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states:</b> “The firstborn that she bears <b>shall be established in the name of his</b> dead <b>brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:6), <b>and</b> if the younger brother performs levirate marriage he has <b>established</b> his brother’s name and thereby earns the inheritance.

### Part 20
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if there is no difference between the firstborn and the eldest, why does <b>the Merciful One call</b> the brother who enters levirate marriage the <b>firstborn?</b>
