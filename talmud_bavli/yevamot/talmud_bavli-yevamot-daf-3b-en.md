### Part 1
The Gemara answers that these enumerations come <b>to exclude</b> those additions <b>of Rav and of Rav Asi.</b> Rav added the rival wife of a woman suspected by her husband of adultery [<i>sota</i>], while Rav Asi added the rival wife of an <i>aylonit</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Asi,</b> the enumeration of the mishna comes <b>to exclude what?</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara responds: <b>If each maintains</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of the other,</b> then <b>one</b> enumeration of the mishna comes <b>to exclude the rival wife of a wife who performed refusal.</b> If the deceased brother had two wives, one of whom was a minor, and she refused the <i>yavam</i>, her rival wife is prohibited from levirate marriage with him. However, the latter is not entirely exempt and must perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>And</b> the other <b>one comes to exclude the rival wife</b> of the wife <b>of one who remarries his divorcée,</b> i.e., a woman who was illicitly remarried by her former husband after she had been married to another man.

### Part 3
<b>And if</b> Rav and Rav Asi <b>do not</b> each <b>maintain</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of the other,</b> then <b>one</b> enumeration comes <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of the other,</b> as they do not agree that the <i>halakha</i> stated by the other should be included in the mishna, <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> comes <b>to exclude</b> one of the above suggestions, <b>either the rival wife of</b> a wife <b>who performed refusal or the rival wife</b> of the wife <b>of one who remarries his divorcée.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Asi, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach these</b> cases. Since in their opinions there are more than fifteen women to whom the principle of the mishna applies, why weren’t they all stated by the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna? The Gemara answers: They were not taught because they do not completely fit all of the halakhic rulings here.

### Part 5
The Gemara elaborates: This is <b>because they do not</b> involve the case <b>of a rival wife of a rival wife.</b> With regard to the fifteen women listed, the discussion of the mishna concerning rival wives and rival wives of rival wives is appropriate. However, the two cases cited by Rav and Rav Asi do not leave room for such deliberations, as both a <i>sota</i> and an <i>aylonit</i> are exempt and forbidden equally to all of the brothers, because their prohibition does not result from a familial relation to one of the living brothers but from a personal issue relating to the women themselves. Since none of the brothers may marry her rival wife, there is no possibility of a rival wife of a rival wife, and consequently these cases were omitted from the mishna’s list of fifteen women.

### Part 6
§ After analyzing the order and language of the mishna, the Gemara discusses the <i>halakhot</i> themselves. <b>From where are these matters,</b> that if one’s forbidden relative comes before him for levirate marriage he is prohibited from marrying her or her rival wife, derived? It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness, with her in her lifetime”</b> (Leviticus 18:18). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the apparently superfluous phrase: <b>“With her”?</b>

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>Since it is stated</b> with regard to the wife of a deceased brother: <b>“Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that when <b>the verse speaks of</b> the mitzva of levirate marriage, it includes <b>even any one of those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> as <b>mentioned in the Torah.</b> Therefore, one derives a verbal analogy: <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to a wife’s sister: <b>“With her,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to a levirate marriage: <b>“With her.”</b>

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> explains the verbal analogy. <b>Just as there,</b> a levirate marriage involves <b>the performance of a mitzva, so too, here,</b> the statement “uncover her nakedness with her” includes <b>the performance of a mitzva, and the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“You shall not take.”</b> The phrase “with her” teaches that even in a case where there is an obligation of levirate marriage, the Torah prohibition proscribing forbidden relatives remains in force.

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>she,</b> his wife’s sister, is exempt from levirate marriage; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>her rival wife</b> is also exempt? <b>The verse states: “To be a rival</b> to her” (Leviticus 18:18), which indicates that not only is she prohibited, but so too is her rival wife. <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only her rival wife; from where</b> is it derived that <b>the rival wife of her rival wife</b> is also exempt? <b>The verse states: “To be a rival [<i>litzror</i>],”</b> using the full spelling with a double <i>reish</i>, <b>and not <i>latzor</i>;</b> this indicates that there are several rival wives, one after another.

### Part 10
<b>And I have</b> derived from this verbal analogy <b>only</b> that the mitzva of levirate marriage does not apply to <b>a wife’s sister. From where</b> is it derived that the same applies to <b>the other</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden? You</b> can <b>say</b> as follows: <b>Just as</b> the case of <b>a wife’s sister is specific</b> in <b>that she is a forbidden relative, and</b> this is a prohibition <b>for whose intentional</b> violation, i.e., for intentional sexual relations with her, <b>one is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>, and for whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, and</b> she is <b>prohibited to the <i>yavam</i></b> in levirate marriage; <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>all</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden</b> by a prohibition <b>for whose intentional</b> violation <b>one is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> and for whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering,</b> they are <b>prohibited to the <i>yavam</i></b> in levirate marriage.

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the cases of <b>those</b> women themselves with whom relations are forbidden; <b>from where</b> is it derived that <b>their rival wives</b> are also exempt from levirate marriage? <b>You</b> can <b>say</b> as follows: <b>Just as a wife’s sister is specific</b> in <b>that she is a forbidden relative and</b> this is a prohibition <b>for whose intentional</b> violation <b>one is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>, and for whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering,</b> and she is <b>prohibited to the <i>yavam</i></b> in levirate marriage, <b>and her rival wife is</b> likewise <b>prohibited; so too, any</b> woman <b>with whom relations are forbidden and</b> this is a prohibition <b>for whose intentional</b> violation <b>one is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>, and for whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, and</b> this woman is one <b>who is forbidden to the <i>yavam</i>, her rival wife is</b> likewise <b>forbidden.</b> The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>From here the Sages stated</b> that <b>fifteen women exempt their rival wives and the rival wives of their rival wives from <i>ḥalitza</i> and from levirate marriage forever.</b>

### Part 12
§ One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>include</b> in this principle <b>even the six</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden that are more severe than these,</b> i.e., one’s mother, his father’s sister, and so on, as stated in a later mishna (13b), since they too are forbidden by a prohibition entailing <i>karet</i>. This would mean <b>that their rival wives should</b> likewise <b>be prohibited</b> to enter into levirate marriage with this <i>yavam</i> as forbidden rival wives.

### Part 13
In response, <b>you</b> can <b>say: Just as a wife’s sister is specific</b> in <b>that she is a forbidden relative and</b> this is a prohibition <b>for whose intentional</b> violation <b>one is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> and for whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, and</b> yet she is <b>permitted to marry</b> one of the <b>brothers but</b> she is <b>prohibited to the <i>yavam</i></b> in levirate marriage, <b>and her rival wife is</b> likewise <b>prohibited</b> in levirate marriage; <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>any</b> woman <b>with whom relations are forbidden and</b> this is a prohibition <b>for whose intentional</b> violation <b>one is liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i> and for whose unwitting</b> violation one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, and</b> who is <b>permitted to marry</b> one of the <b>brothers but</b> she is <b>prohibited to the <i>yavam</i></b> in levirate marriage, <b>her rival wife is</b> also <b>prohibited</b> in levirate marriage.

### Part 14
<b>This excludes</b> the <b>six</b> women <b>with whom relations are forbidden</b> by <b>a more severe</b> prohibition <b>than those, since they may not marry the brothers,</b> i.e., they are forbidden to all of the brothers. One’s mother may never marry his brother, either because she is also that brother’s mother, or because she is his father’s wife. Consequently, <b>their rival wives are permitted, as</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a rival wife applies only</b> due <b>to the brother.</b> In other words, the prohibition against marriage to the rival wife of a forbidden relative is applicable only in instances of levirate bonds. When the levirate bond does not take effect at all, the rival wife is not forbidden.

### Part 15
The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>We have learned the warning</b> concerning this prohibition that the <i>yavam</i> may not marry his forbidden relative from the verse: “And you shall not take a woman to her sister, to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness, with her in her lifetime” (Leviticus 18:18). <b>From where</b> is <b>the punishment</b> that he incurs if he transgresses and marries her derived? <b>The verse states: “For whoever shall do any</b> of these <b>abominations,</b> the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 18:29).

### Part 16
§ Up until this point, the Gemara has cited the <i>baraita</i> that interprets the biblical basis for the <i>halakha</i> of the mishna. The Gemara further analyzes the foundational principles of this topic. <b>The reason</b> that these women are exempt from levirate marriage is <b>that the Merciful One writes “with her,”</b> from which it may be inferred that <b>if that was not so, I would say</b> that <b>a wife’s sister enters into levirate marriage</b> with her sister’s husband. <b>What is the reason</b> that one would have assumed that this is the case? It is <b>as we say,</b> in accordance with a principle, that <b>a positive</b> mitzva <b>comes and overrides a prohibition.</b> In this case, the positive mitzva to enter into levirate marriage overrides the prohibition against marrying one’s wife’s sister.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks if that principle is applicable in this case. One can <b>say that we said</b> that <b>a positive</b> mitzva <b>comes and overrides a prohibition</b> only when there is <b>a prohibition</b> for which one is punished by lashes <b>alone.</b> However, with regard to <b>a prohibition that includes</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>, does</b> a positive mitzva <b>override</b> it? This prohibition is more severe than a regular one, and therefore perhaps a positive mitzva does not override it. <b>And furthermore,</b> with regard to <b>a prohibition</b> for which one is punished by lashes <b>alone, from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> a positive mitzva <b>overrides</b> it?
