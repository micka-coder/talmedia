### Part 1
If she is his father’s <b>paternal</b> half sister, <b>he may maintain</b> her as his wife. If she is his <b>mother’s maternal</b> half <b>sister, he must divorce</b> her. If she is his mother’s <b>paternal</b> half sister, <b>Rabbi Meir says he must divorce</b> her, <b>and the Rabbis say he may maintain</b> her. This is <b>as Rabbi Meir would say: Any relative forbidden due to kinship with the mother,</b> whether the woman is his paternal relative, e.g., his father’s maternal half sister, or his maternal relative, <b>he must divorce</b> her. However, if she is forbidden <b>due to the father, he may maintain</b> her.

### Part 2
<b>And he is permitted to</b> marry <b>his maternal brother’s wife and his father’s brother’s wife, and all other forbidden relatives are</b> also <b>permitted to him.</b> The expression: And all other relatives are also permitted to him, is added <b>to include the father’s wife.</b>

### Part 3
With regard to one who <b>married a woman and her daughter</b> and they converted, <b>he may remarry one but must divorce</b> the other <b>one. He should not marry</b> her <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> If <b>his wife,</b> the daughter, <b>died, he is permitted to</b> maintain <b>his mother-in-law</b> as his wife. <b>And some teach</b> that <b>he is prohibited from</b> maintaining <b>his mother-in-law.</b>

### Part 4
<b>In any event,</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>he is permitted to</b> marry <b>his brother’s wife.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where his brother married her when he was</b> already <b>a convert?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where he married her while he was a gentile.</b> The Gemara asks: If so, <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this obvious <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that the Sages <b>should decree</b> that the marriage is prohibited if the brother married her <b>while he was a gentile, due to</b> the prohibition against their marriage if the brother married her <b>when he was</b> already <b>a convert.</b> The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that there is no such decree.

### Part 5
<b>The Master said:</b> If one <b>married a woman and her daughter</b> and they converted, <b>he may remarry one but must divorce</b> the other <b>one. He should not marry</b> her <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that <b>he must divorce</b> her, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that he should not marry her <b><i>ab initio</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: That statement <b>is standing there,</b> i.e., it is referring to the previous sentence, <b>and this is what it is saying: Those</b> wives <b>that the Sages said</b> that <b>he may maintain,</b> e.g., his paternal half sister, <b>he should not marry</b> them <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b>

### Part 6
The <i>baraita</i> taught: If <b>his wife,</b> the daughter, <b>died, he is permitted to</b> maintain <b>his mother-in-law</b> as his wife. <b>And some teach</b> that <b>he is prohibited to</b> maintain <b>his mother-in-law.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>One</b> of the teachings <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, and</b> the other <b>one is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 7
<b>The one who prohibits</b> the convert from maintaining his mother-in-law <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who said</b> that one’s <b>mother-in-law after</b> his wife’s <b>death remains forbidden</b> to him to the same degree as during her lifetime. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>with regard to a convert, the Sages decreed</b> that she is forbidden to him, lest one marry his mother-in-law who is a Jew from birth after his wife’s death. <b>And the one who permits</b> him to maintain her <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who said</b> that <b>the prohibition</b> against engaging in intercourse with one’s <b>mother-in-law is weakened after</b> his wife’s <b>death,</b> as they are not liable to receive the death penalty. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>with regard to a convert, the Sages did not decree</b> that she is forbidden to him.

### Part 8
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>five women whose offspring were mixed,</b> i.e., their lineage became indeterminate, and they had other sons as well who were not mixed, and <b>the mixed</b> sons <b>matured and married women and</b> subsequently <b>died,</b> then <b>four</b> sons who were not mixed, each one from a different mother, <b>must perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with one</b> of the widows, as she might be the sister-in-law of any of them. <b>And one</b> son of the mother whose sons did not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> <b>may perform levirate marriage with her</b> instead of <i>ḥalitza</i>; even if she is not his sister-in-law, once she has received <i>ḥalitza</i> from the others she may marry any man.

### Part 9
Subsequently, <b>he and three</b> of the four other sons <b>must perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with one</b> of the remaining widows, <b>and</b> the other <b>one may perform levirate marriage.</b> When this process has been completed for all the widows, <b>four <i>ḥalitzot</i> and a levirate marriage are found</b> altogether <b>for each and every</b> widow.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the mishna that <b><i>ḥalitza</i> specifically is performed</b> first, <b>and afterward levirate marriage. However, levirate marriage may not be performed first, as</b> that <b>would breach</b> the prohibition against <b>a <i>yevama</i></b> engaging in intercourse <b>with</b> a member of <b>the public,</b> if she is not his sister-in-law.

### Part 11
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the reason for the mishna’s ruling that the son who performed levirate marriage <b>and three</b> of the four others <b>must perform <i>ḥalitza</i> with one</b> of the remaining widows, and the remaining son may perform levirate marriage? Why can’t the same son who performed levirate marriage with the first widow be the one to perform levirate marriage with the other widows, too, after the other four sons perform <i>ḥalitza</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Do not say</b> that <b>one</b> of the brothers <b>may perform levirate marriage with all of them. Rather, each one of them should perform levirate marriage with one,</b> as <b>perhaps one will happen upon his own</b> sister-in-law, whereas if one performs levirate marriage with all of them, the others will not have a chance to perform the mitzva.

### Part 12
§ A continuation of a case in the mishna is stated in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>some of them are brothers, and some of them are not brothers, the brothers perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and those who are not brothers perform levirate marriage.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>saying? Rav Safra said</b> that <b>this is what it is saying:</b> If <b>some of</b> the sons who were not mixed <b>are</b> only <b>paternal brothers</b> of the mixed sons, <b>and some of them,</b> in addition to being paternal half brothers, <b>are</b> also <b>maternal</b> half <b>brothers</b> of other members of the mixed group, then the <b>maternal</b> half <b>brothers must perform <i>ḥalitza</i></b> with all of the women, since each of them might be his maternal sister-in-law, who is forbidden to him, as levirate marriage applies only to a paternal sister-in-law. <b>And</b> those who are only <b>paternal brothers perform levirate marriage.</b>

### Part 13
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If <b>some of them are priests and some of them are not priests,</b> the <b>priests perform <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> and <b>those who are not priests perform levirate marriage,</b> as it is prohibited for a priest to marry a woman who underwent <i>ḥalitza</i>. If <b>some of them are priests and some of them are maternal</b> half <b>brothers,</b> both <b>these and those perform <i>ḥalitza</i> and not levirate marriage.</b>
