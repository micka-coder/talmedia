<b>that they will say a matter of <i>halakha</i> in my name in this world</b> when I have passed on to another world. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> With regard to <b>any Torah scholar in whose name a matter of <i>halakha</i> is said in this world, his lips mouth</b> the words <b>in the grave,</b> as though he is talking. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Ze’eira said, and some say</b> this was stated by <b>Shimon the Nazirite: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? <b>“And the roof of your mouth is like the best wine that glides down smoothly for my beloved, moving gently the lips of those who are asleep”</b> (Song of Songs 7:10).

### Part 2
He explains: This is <b>like a pile [<i>komer</i>] of grapes</b> left to warm before they are pressed: <b>Just as</b> in the case of <b>a pile of grapes, when a person places his finger on it, immediately it moves,</b> as the wine bursts through and the whole pile shakes, <b>so too</b> with <b>Torah scholars: When a teaching is said in their name in this world their lips mouth</b> the words <b>in the grave.</b> For this reason Rabbi Yoḥanan wanted his Torah statements to be attributed to him, so that he would earn eternal life.

### Part 3
§ The Gemara addresses the statement of the mishna that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>both</b> for a boy <b>who is nine years</b> and one day old as well as a twenty-year old who has not developed two pubic hairs. In both cases, their sexual relations are not considered proper intercourse with regard to levirate marriage. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> against this from the following source: With regard to a man <b>twenty years old who has not developed two</b> pubic <b>hairs, they must bring proof that he is twenty years old, and</b> he <b>is</b> established as <b>a eunuch,</b> who <b>may neither perform <i>ḥalitza</i> nor perform levirate marriage.</b>

### Part 4
Likewise, in the case of a woman who is <b>twenty years old and has not developed two</b> pubic <b>hairs, they must bring proof that she is twenty years old, and</b> that <b>she is a sexually underdeveloped woman,</b> who <b>may neither perform <i>ḥalitza</i> nor enter into levirate marriage.</b> This shows that the status of a nine-year-old male and a twenty-year old man without pubic hairs are not the same, as the intercourse of a nine-year-old is considered of some significance, whereas that of a eunuch is entirely disregarded, as he may not even perform <i>ḥalitza</i>.

### Part 5
The Gemara answers: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rav said: And this</b> <i>halakha</i> applies only <b>if he developed</b> other <b>signs of a eunuch</b> by the age of twenty. The mishna, by contrast, is referring to one who merely showed the signs of maturity at a late age. <b>Rava said:</b> The language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise, as it teaches: And he is the eunuch.</b> One can <b>learn from here</b> that this is referring to one who is definitely a eunuch.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks a question with regard to the <i>halakha</i> itself: <b>And</b> in a case <b>where he does not develop the signs of a eunuch, until what</b> age is he considered a minor? <b>The school of Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: Until most of his years</b> have passed, i.e., until he reaches the age of thirty-five, i.e., halfway to seventy, the standard length of a man’s life.

### Part 7
On the same issue, the Gemara relates: <b>When they would come before Rava</b> to inquire about someone who had reached the age of maturity but had not yet developed the physical signs, <b>if</b> the person in question was <b>thin, he would say to them: Go</b> and <b>fatten him</b> up before we decide on his status. <b>And if he</b> was <b>fat, he would say to them: Go</b> and <b>make him thin. As these signs,</b> the pubic hairs of maturity, <b>sometimes they fall off due to thinness and sometimes they fall off due to fatness.</b> It is therefore possible that after his bodily shape is adjusted he will develop the signs of maturity and will not have the status of a eunuch.
