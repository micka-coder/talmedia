### Part 1
The Gemara addresses another case in which the court forces a man to divorce his wife who has not had children after ten years. If <b>he said: You miscarried within</b> the <b>ten</b> years of our marriage, and since less than ten years have elapsed since that time he should not have to divorce her, <b>and she said: I did not miscarry, Rabbi Ami said: Even in this</b> case <b>she is believed, because if it is so that she miscarried she</b> would <b>not establish herself as barren</b> through denying his claim.

### Part 2
If <b>she miscarried, and</b> then <b>miscarried again, and miscarried again, she has been established to</b> be a woman who is prone to <b>miscarriages,</b> and her husband must divorce her so that he can have children with another woman. If <b>he said she miscarried twice, and she said</b> it occurred <b>three</b> times, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Elazar said: There was an incident</b> of this kind that was adjudicated in <b>the study hall and they said</b> that <b>she is believed, because if it is so that</b> she had <b>not miscarried</b> a third time <b>she</b> would <b>not establish herself</b> as one who is prone to <b>miscarriages.</b>

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A man is commanded with regard to</b> the mitzva to be <b>fruitful and multiply, but not a woman. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says</b> that a woman is also commanded, as the verse <b>states with regard to both of them: “And God blessed them, and God said to them: Be fruitful and multiply”</b> (Genesis 1:28).

### Part 4
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where are these matters</b> derived, that a woman is not obligated in the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply? <b>Rabbi Ile’a said in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: The verse states:</b> “Be fruitful and multiply, <b>and fill the land and conquer it”</b> (Genesis 1:28). <b>It is the manner of a man to conquer and it is not the manner of a woman to conquer.</b> Consequently, it is evident that the entire command, including the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply, was given only to men and not to women.

### Part 5
The Gemara raises a difficulty. <b>On the contrary,</b> the plural term: <b>“And conquer it [<i>vekhivshuha</i>],” indicates</b> that the <b>two</b> of them are included. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It is written</b> in the Torah without the letter <i>vav</i>, so that it can be read: <b>And conquer it [<i>vekhivsha</i>],</b> in the singular. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The proof is <b>from here:</b> “And God said to him: <b>I am God Almighty, be fruitful and multiply [<i>perei urvei</i>]”</b> (Genesis 35:11), which is in singular, <b>and it does not state: Be fruitful and multiply [<i>peru urvu</i>]</b> in the plural.

### Part 6
The Gemara cites other statements made by Rabbi Ile’a in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon. <b>And Rabbi Ile’a said in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: Just as it is a mitzva for a person to say that which will be heeded, so is it a mitzva for a person not to say that which will not be heeded.</b> One should not rebuke those who will be unreceptive to his message. <b>Rabbi Abba says:</b> It is <b>obligatory</b> for him to refrain from speaking, <b>as it is stated: “Do not reprove a scorner lest he hate you; reprove a wise man and he will love you”</b> (Proverbs 9:8).

### Part 7
<b>And Rabbi Ile’a</b> further <b>said in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: It is permitted for a person to depart</b> from the truth <b>in a matter</b> that will bring <b>peace, as it is stated: “Your father commanded</b> before he died, saying: <b>So you shall say to Joseph: Please pardon</b> your brothers’ crime, etc.” (Genesis 50:16–17). Jacob never issued this command, but his sons falsely attributed this statement to him in order to preserve peace between them and Joseph.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> It is <b>a mitzva</b> to depart from the truth in order to preserve peace, <b>as it is stated: “And Samuel said: How can I go, and Saul will hear and kill me”</b> (I Samuel 16:2). God responded in the next verse that Samuel should say he went to sacrifice an offering, indicating that God commands one to lie in order to preserve peace.

### Part 9
It was <b>taught</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael: Great is peace, as even the Holy One, Blessed be He, departed</b> from the truth for <b>it. As, initially it is written</b> that Sarah said of Abraham: <b>“And my lord is old”</b> (Genesis 18:12), <b>and in the end it is written</b> that God told Abraham that Sarah said: <b>“And I am old”</b> (Genesis 18:13). God adjusted Sarah’s words in order to spare Abraham hurt feelings that might lead Abraham and Sarah to quarrel.

### Part 10
§ It is taught in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says</b> that women are also included in the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply. <b>It was stated</b> that two <i>amora’im</i>, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi,</b> disagreed concerning this matter. <b>One said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, and one said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude that it was Rabbi Yoḥanan who said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i> is not</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, <b>as Rabbi Abbahu sat and said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, <b>and Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi,</b> who were sitting across from him, <b>turned their faces</b> as an indication that they disagreed with this report of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion, but did not want to explicitly contradict Rabbi Abbahu’s statement out of respect for him.

### Part 12
<b>And some say</b> a different version of the incident, that it was <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> who <b>said</b> this statement, <b>and Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi turned their faces. Rav Pappa said: Granted, according to the one who said</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu said it,</b> it makes sense that <b>due to the honor of Caesar’s court,</b> where Rabbi Abbahu maintained close ties, Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi <b>did not say anything to him</b> and merely hinted at their disagreement. <b>However, according to the one who said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said it, let them say to him explicitly: Rabbi Yoḥanan did not say this.</b> In any event, it is clear that according to Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, Rabbi Yoḥanan disagreed with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this issue? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina said</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi said: There was an incident</b> that came <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan in the synagogue of Caesarea</b> involving a woman who wanted a divorce from her husband after ten years of childless marriage, <b>and he said</b> that the husband <b>must divorce</b> her <b>and give</b> her the payment for her <b>marriage contract. If it enters your mind</b> to say <b>that she is not commanded</b> to be fruitful and multiply, <b>what is</b> payment for <b>a marriage contract doing</b> here? Why does she have a right to demand to be divorced and to receive the payment for her marriage contract?

### Part 14
The Gemara responds: <b>Perhaps</b> that was <b>in</b> a case when <b>she came</b> to demand a divorce <b>due to</b> another <b>claim,</b> i.e., she wanted children for a reason other than the fulfillment of the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply. Since this claim has merit, her husband must divorce her and pay her marriage contract.

### Part 15
This is <b>like</b> the case of <b>a certain</b> woman <b>who came before Rabbi Ami</b> and requested a divorce due to her husband’s inability to father children. <b>She said to him</b>: <b>Give me</b> the payment for my <b>marriage contract. He said to her: Go</b> away, as <b>you are not commanded</b> to be fruitful and multiply and have no right to demand a divorce. <b>She said to him: In her old age, what will be with this woman,</b> i.e., if I have no children, who will take care of me when I grow old? Rabbi Ami <b>said:</b> In a situation <b>such as this, we certainly force</b> the husband to divorce and her and pay her marriage contract.

### Part 16
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <b>A certain</b> woman <b>came before Rav Naḥman</b> and requested a divorce due to her husband’s inability to father children. <b>He said to her: You are not commanded</b> to be fruitful and multiply. <b>She said to him: Does this woman not require a staff for her hand and a hoe for</b> her <b>burial?</b> In other words, the woman said that she wanted children so that they could care for her in her old age and bury her when she would die. Rav Naḥman <b>said:</b> In a case <b>such as this, we certainly force</b> the husband to divorce her.

### Part 17
The Gemara relates that Rabbi Ḥiyya’s sons, <b>Yehuda and Ḥizkiyya, were twins,</b> but <b>one</b> of them <b>was fully developed after nine</b> months of pregnancy <b>and one was fully developed at the beginning of the seventh</b> month, and they were born two months apart. <b>Yehudit, the wife of Rabbi Ḥiyya, had</b> acute <b>birthing pain</b> from these unusual deliveries. She <b>changed her clothes</b> to prevent Rabbi Ḥiyya from recognizing her <b>and came before Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> to ask him a halakhic question. <b>She said: Is a woman commanded</b> to be <b>fruitful and multiply? He said to her: No. She went and drank an infertility potion.</b>

### Part 18
<b>Eventually the matter was revealed,</b> and Rabbi Ḥiyya found out about what Yehudit had done. <b>He said to her: If only you had given birth to one more belly for me,</b> i.e., another set of twins. <b>As the Master said: Yehuda and Ḥizkiyya</b> were twin <b>brothers</b> and became prominent Torah scholars, and <b>Pazi and Tavi,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya’s daughters,
