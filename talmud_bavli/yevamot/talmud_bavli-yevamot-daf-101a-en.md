### Part 1
§ It is stated in the mishna that if <b>both</b> uncertain fathers <b>were priests,</b> the son is exempt from punishment for striking and for cursing them. <b>The Sages taught:</b> If <b>he struck this</b> uncertain father, <b>and then struck that one,</b> or if <b>he cursed this one and then cursed that one,</b> or if <b>he cursed both of them simultaneously</b> or <b>struck both of them simultaneously,</b> in all these cases <b>he is liable</b> to receive capital punishment, as one of them is certainly his father. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Although if he struck or cursed both of them <b>simultaneously he is liable,</b> if he stuck or cursed them <b>one after the other, he is exempt.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He is exempt</b> even if he struck or cursed them <b>simultaneously?</b> The Gemara answers: These are the opinions of <b>two <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> and they each expressed their opinion <b>in accordance with</b> that <b>of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of the one who exempts</b> the son from punishment? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Blessing is stated below</b> (Leviticus 20:9), with regard to cursing parents, <b>and blessing is stated above</b> (Exodus 22:27), with regard to cursing God. The Sages used the word blessing as a euphemism for cursing, as it was their custom to avoid uncouth language. <b>Just as</b> the statement <b>above,</b> in Exodus, is referring to a curse <b>that does not involve partnership,</b> as God is One, <b>so too</b> the statement <b>below,</b> in Leviticus, is referring exclusively to a curse of a parent <b>that does not involve partnership,</b> i.e., when there is no doubt with regard to his identity. <b>And striking is juxtaposed with cursing.</b> Just as one is not liable for cursing when it is unclear who his father is, the same applies to striking.

### Part 4
§ It is stated in the mishna: <b>And he ascends</b> to the Temple service <b>with the priestly watch</b> of both uncertain fathers. However, he does not receive a share of the offerings of either watch. The Gemara asks: <b>Since he does not receive a share, why does he ascend?</b> The Gemara is puzzled by this question: <b>Why does he ascend? Doesn’t he</b> naturally <b>say: I wish to perform a mitzva</b> by serving as a priest? The Gemara explains: <b>However,</b> note that the mishna <b>does not state:</b> If <b>he ascended, but rather: He ascends,</b> in the present tense. Apparently he is obligated to ascend, even <b>against his will.</b> Why is he under obligation to serve in the Temple?

### Part 5
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ḥanina said</b> that <b>Abaye said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> He is obligated <b>due to</b> the potential <b>family flaw,</b> i.e., harm to the family name. If he does not serve with these watches, people will infer that both families are unfit for the priesthood, which is not the case.

### Part 6
It is stated in the mishna: <b>And if both</b> uncertain fathers <b>were in one priestly watch,</b> he receives one share. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about the case in which the uncertain fathers belonged to <b>two priestly watches,</b> with regard to which the mishna states <b>that</b> the son <b>does not</b> receive a share, and the case in which they belonged to the same watch? Just <b>as</b> in the case where they belonged to two watches, <b>he goes to this watch</b> to receive a share <b>and they reject him,</b> claiming that he belongs to the other watch, <b>and he goes to that watch and they reject him</b> in the same manner, <b>so too,</b> where they belonged to <b>one watch, he goes to this patrilineal family</b> to receive a share on their day, <b>and they reject him,</b> and the other patrilineal family rejects him too, as his true patrilineal family is unknown.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: If they were both in one priestly watch and one patrilineal family, he receives one share,</b> as he cannot be rejected.
