### Part 1
<b>or with a <i>sota</i>, that the offspring is not a <i>mamzer</i>.</b>

### Part 2
With regard to <b>a menstruating woman</b> the offspring is not a <i>mamzer</i> <b>because</b> one’s <b>betrothal of her takes effect, as it is stated: “And her impurity shall be upon him”</b> (Leviticus 15:24). The phrase “shall be” alludes to the fact that a betrothal with her takes effect. The verse teaches that <b>even at the time of her</b> menstrual <b>impurity, betrothal with her takes effect.</b>

### Part 3
With regard to <b>a <i>sota</i>, too,</b> the offspring is not a <i>mamzer</i> <b>because</b> one’s <b>betrothal of her takes effect.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara notes: <b>This</b> teaching of Abaye <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All agree with regard to one who engages in sexual relations with a menstruating woman, or with a <i>sota</i>, or with a widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i></b> to perform levirate marriage, <b>that the offspring is not a <i>mamzer</i>.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara explains: <b>And Abaye</b> did not mention the case of a <b>widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i></b> because <b>he is uncertain whether,</b> if someone other than the <i>yavam</i> betrothed her, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav</b> that it does not take effect or <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel</b> that it might take effect.

### Part 6
§ The mishna states: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Azzai said:</b> I found a scroll recording people’s lineages. The Gemara cites an expanded version of the contents of the scroll. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Azzai said: I found a scroll</b> recording people’s <b>lineages, in Jerusalem, and it was written in it</b> that <b>so-and-so is a <i>mamzer</i> from</b> an adulterous union with <b>a married woman. And it was</b> also <b>written in it: The teachings of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov</b> measure only <b>a <i>kav</i> but are clean</b> and accurate, and so the <i>halakha</i> is decided in accordance with his opinions. <b>And it was written in it: Manasseh,</b> king of Israel, <b>killed Isaiah</b> the prophet.

### Part 7
The Gemara expands on the events surrounding Isaiah’s death: <b>Rava said:</b> Manasseh <b>judged him</b> as a false witness for issuing statements contradicting the Torah <b>and</b> only then <b>killed him.</b> Manasseh <b>said to</b> Isaiah: <b>Moses your master said</b> in the Torah: “And He said: You cannot see My face, <b>for man cannot see Me and live”</b> (Exodus 33:20), <b>and</b> yet <b>you said: “I saw the Lord sitting upon a high and lofty throne”</b> (Isaiah 6:1). <b>Moses your master said:</b> “For <b>which</b> great nation is there, that has God so near to it, <b>as the Lord our God is, whenever we call upon Him?”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:7), <b>and</b> yet <b>you said: “Seek the Lord while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near”</b> (Isaiah 55:6), which implies that God is not always near. <b>Moses your master said: “I will fulfill the number of your days”</b> (Exodus 23:26), which implies that each individual has a preordained allotted lifespan that he cannot outlive, <b>and</b> yet <b>you said</b> in a prophecy to King Hezekiah: <b>“And I will add to your days, fifteen years”</b> (II Kings 20:6).

### Part 8
<b>Isaiah said</b> to himself: <b>I know him,</b> i.e., Manasseh, <b>that he will not accept whatever</b> explanation <b>that I will say to him</b> to resolve my prophecies with the words of the Torah. <b>And</b> even <b>if I say it to him, I will make him into an intentional transgressor</b> since he will kill me anyway. Therefore, in order to escape, <b>he uttered a</b> divine <b>name</b> and <b>was swallowed within a cedar</b> tree. Manasseh’s servants <b>brought the cedar</b> tree <b>and sawed through it</b> in order to kill him. <b>When</b> the saw <b>reached to where his mouth was,</b> Isaiah <b>died.</b> He died specifically as this point <b>due to that which he said: “In the midst of a people of unclean lips, I dwell”</b> (Isaiah 6:5). He was punished for referring to the Jewish people in a derogatory manner.

### Part 9
The Gemara asks: <b>In any case,</b> as Manasseh pointed out, these <b>verses contradict each other;</b> how are these contradictions to be resolved?

### Part 10
The Gemara resolves the first contradiction: <b>“I saw the Lord”</b> is to be understood <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All of the prophets observed</b> their prophecies <b>through an obscure looking glass [<i>aspaklaria</i>],</b> i.e., their prophecies were given as metaphoric visions but were not a direct perception of the matter. However, <b>Moses our master observed</b> his prophecies <b>through a clear looking glass,</b> i.e., he gained a direct and accurate perception of the matter.

### Part 11
The Gemara resolves the second contradiction: Isaiah’s prophecy: <b>“Seek the Lord while He may be found,”</b> does not contradict the verse in the Torah that God is near to His nation “whenever we call upon Him,” because <b>this</b> prophecy of Isaiah was made <b>with regard to the individual</b> and <b>this</b> verse in the Torah is stated <b>with regard to a community,</b> as the prayer of the community is always accepted. The Gemara asks: <b>And when</b> is the time that God is to be found near <b>the individual? Rav Naḥman said Rabba bar Avuh said: These are the ten days between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur.</b>

### Part 12
The resolution of the third contradiction from the verse: <b>“I will fulfill the number of your days,” is</b> subject to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“I will fulfill the number of your days”;</b>
