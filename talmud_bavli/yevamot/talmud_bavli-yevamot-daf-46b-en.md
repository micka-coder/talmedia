### Part 1
<b>With regard to one who immersed but was not circumcised, everyone,</b> i.e., both Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Eliezer, <b>agrees that</b> the <i>halakha</i> is derived from the foremothers that immersion alone <b>is effective. Where they disagree</b> is <b>with regard to one who was circumcised but had not immersed; Rabbi Eliezer derives</b> that it is effective <b>from the forefathers, and Rabbi Yehoshua</b> disagrees because he maintains that <b>in</b> the conversion of the <b>forefathers there was also an immersion.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>From where did he</b> derive this? <b>If we say</b> that he derived it <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written</b> that in preparation for the revelation at Sinai, God commanded Moses: <b>“Go unto the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments”</b> (Exodus 19:10), as Rabbi Yehoshua understands that the washing mentioned in this verse is the ritual immersion of clothes, this leads to the following <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>Just as in a case where</b> one became impure through contact with some source of impurity, <b>washing,</b> i.e., immersion, of clothes <b>is not required</b> but <b>immersion</b> of one’s body <b>is required,</b> then <b>in a case where washing</b> of clothes <b>is required,</b> as in the preparation for the revelation at Sinai, <b>isn’t it logical that immersion</b> of one’s body <b>should</b> also <b>be required?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>But perhaps</b> when the verse states that they had to wash their clothes, it was <b>merely for cleanliness</b> and not for the sake of ritual purity. If so, no <i>a fortiori</i> inference can be drawn from it to the case of immersion for ritual purity.

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua derived it <b>from here,</b> where the verse states with regard to the formation of the covenant at Sinai: <b>“And Moses took the blood and sprinkled it upon the people”</b> (Exodus 24:8), <b>and it is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that there is no</b> ritual <b>sprinkling without immersion.</b> Therefore, our forefathers also must have immersed at Sinai, and consequently that is also an essential requirement for all conversions.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, from where do we</b> derive that also <b>in</b> the case of our <b>foremothers</b> there was <b>immersion?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning, as, if so,</b> that they did not immerse, then <b>with what were they brought under the wings of the Divine Presence?</b> Therefore, they also must have immersed.

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> A man is <b>never</b> considered <b>a convert until he is</b> both <b>circumcised and has immersed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> this <b>obvious?</b> In all disputes between <b>an individual</b> Sage <b>and many</b> Sages the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the many</b> Sages; it is therefore obvious that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the Rabbis.

### Part 7
The Gemara explains: <b>Who are the Rabbis</b> referred to in the <i>baraita</i>? It is <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> Since Rabbi Yosei is merely an individual Sage, it was necessarily for Rabbi Yoḥanan to state explicitly that the <i>halakha</i> is ruled in accordance with his opinion.

### Part 8
Rabbi Yosei’s opinion is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a convert <b>who came and said: I was circumcised</b> for the sake of conversion <b>but I did not immerse,</b> the court <b>should immerse him,</b> as <b>what</b> would be the problem <b>with that;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Since in any case the court immerses him, Rabbi Yehuda does not require proof of the convert’s claim that he was circumcised for the sake of conversion because he holds that it is sufficient to be either circumcised or immersed for the sake of conversion. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The court <b>does not immerse</b> him. He holds that both circumcision and immersion must be performed specifically for the sake of conversion and are indispensable parts of the conversion process. Therefore, since it is impossible to verify the convert’s claim with regard to his circumcision, there is no benefit to having him immerse.

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> states a ramification of their dispute: <b>Therefore,</b> the court <b>may immerse a convert</b> who was already circumcised <b>on Shabbat;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Since he holds that circumcision alone effected conversion, the immersion will not effect any further change in his status, and so it is permitted on Shabbat. <b>And Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The court <b>may not immerse</b> him. Since he holds that both circumcision and immersion are necessary to effect a conversion, the immersion will effect a change in his status by making him Jewish. Therefore it is prohibited to do so on Shabbat by rabbinic decree, because it appears similar to preparing a vessel for use.

### Part 10
The Gemara analyzes the latter clause: <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Therefore,</b> the court <b>may immerse a convert</b> who was already circumcised <b>on Shabbat.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> this an <b>obvious</b> extension of his opinion; <b>since Rabbi Yehuda said that</b> either <b>one</b> of circumcision or immersion <b>is sufficient, where</b> a convert <b>was circumcised in our presence</b> the court may certainly <b>immerse</b> him, even on Shabbat. <b>What,</b> then, is the need for the <i>baraita</i> to include the clause that begins with: <b>Therefore?</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara explains: It is necessary to explicitly teach this ramification <b>lest you say</b> that <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda the immersion is</b> in fact <b>the principal</b> act that effects conversion, and when he said in the first clause that a convert who claims to have been circumcised should be immersed since there is no problem with that, his reasoning was that he holds it is only immersion that effects the conversion. <b>And</b> therefore performing the <b>immersion on Shabbat</b> would <b>not</b> be permitted, <b>as it establishes the person</b> with a new status and so would be prohibited by a rabbinic decree because it appears similar to preparing a vessel for use. The latter clause is therefore necessary to <b>teach us that Rabbi Yehuda requires either this or that,</b> i.e., either immersion or circumcision alone is sufficient to effect a conversion.

### Part 12
The Gemara analyzes the next statement in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The court <b>may not immerse</b> him. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> this an <b>obvious</b> extension of his opinion? <b>As, since Rabbi Yosei requires two</b> acts, both circumcision and immersion, to effect conversion, <b>we may</b> certainly <b>not establish</b> that <b>person</b> with a new status <b>on Shabbat</b> by completing his conversion by immersing him.

### Part 13
The Gemara explains: It is necessary to explicitly teach this ramification <b>lest you say</b> that <b>according to Rabbi Yosei circumcision is</b> in fact <b>the principal</b> act that effects conversion, <b>and</b> it is only <b>there,</b> in the first clause of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>where the circumcision was not performed in our presence</b> and so there is no way to verify whether it was done for the sake of conversion, that Rabbi Yosei states that the court should not proceed to immerse him; <b>however, where the circumcision was performed in our presence,</b> one might <b>say</b> that the conversion was already effected by the circumcision, and therefore <b>let us immerse this</b> convert <b>on Shabbat.</b> The latter clause is therefore necessary to <b>teach us that Rabbi Yosei requires two</b> acts, both circumcision and immersion, to effect conversion.

### Part 14
<b>Rabba said: There was an incident in the house of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Rabbi, and</b> as <b>Rav Yosef teaches</b> it, <b>Rabbi Oshaya bar Rabbi</b> was also present, <b>and</b> as <b>Rav Safra teaches</b> it, a third Sage, <b>Rabbi Oshaya, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> was also present, in <b>which a convert came before him who was circumcised but had not immersed. He said to</b> the convert: <b>Remain here</b> with us <b>until tomorrow, and</b> then <b>we will immerse you.</b>

### Part 15
Rabba said: <b>Learn from</b> this incident <b>three</b> principles: <b>Learn from it</b> that <b>a convert requires</b> a court of <b>three</b> people to preside over the conversion, as Rav Safra taught that the case involved three Sages. <b>And learn from it</b> that <b>one is not</b> considered to be <b>a convert until he has been</b> both <b>circumcised and immersed. And learn from it</b> that the court <b>may not immerse a convert at night,</b> as they instructed him to remain there until the following day. The Gemara suggests: <b>And let us say</b> that one should <b>also learn from it</b> that <b>we require</b> a court of <b>experts</b> to preside over the conversion, as Rav Safra identified that three expert Sages were present. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Perhaps they</b> simply <b>happened to be</b> there, but in fact three laymen would suffice.

### Part 16
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A convert requires</b> a court of <b>three</b> to preside over conversion, because <b>“judgment,” is written with regard to him,</b> as the verse states: “And one judgment shall be both for you and for the convert that sojourns with you” (Numbers 15:16), and legal judgments require a court of three judges.

### Part 17
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>someone who came and said: I am a convert,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>we should accept him;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if a convert sojourns <b>with you</b> in your land, you shall not oppress him” (Leviticus 19:33). The emphasis on “with you” suggests that only someone who was already <b>presumed by you</b> to be a valid convert should be accepted as a convert. If <b>he came and</b> brought <b>witnesses</b> to his conversion <b>with him, from where</b> is it derived that he is to be accepted? It is from <b>the</b> beginning of that <b>verse,</b> which <b>states: “And if a convert sojourns with you in your land.”</b>
