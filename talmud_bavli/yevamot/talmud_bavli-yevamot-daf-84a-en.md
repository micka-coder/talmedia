### Part 1
<b>Forbidden crossbred livestock, an animal with a condition that will cause it to die within twelve months</b> [<b><i>tereifa</i></b>], an animal <b>delivered through the abdominal wall,</b> and an animal that is <b>a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite do not become sacred and do not render</b> another animal <b>sacred</b> in their place.

### Part 2
<b>And Shmuel said: They do not become sacred by way of substitution,</b> i.e., if one had an animal that had been designated as an offering, and he wished to substitute one of these animals for it, the substituted animal does not become sacred. <b>And they</b> themselves <b>do not render</b> another animal <b>sacred when it is made a substitute</b> for them. If one designated one of these animals as an offering and he wished to substitute another animal for it, it does not become sacred. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from this</b> that Rabbi Eliezer does not consider a hermaphrodite to be a proper male.

### Part 3
It is taught in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If one had intercourse with <b>a hermaphrodite,</b> one <b>is liable to</b> be punished with <b>stoning on his account as if</b> one had relations with <b>a male. It is taught</b> on this matter in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: When I went to learn Torah from Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua, his students joined</b> together <b>against me like the roosters of Beit Bukya,</b> highly aggressive animals that do not allow other creatures to remain among them, <b>and they did not let me learn</b> there. Therefore, I managed to learn <b>only one thing in our mishna,</b> which is that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If one had intercourse with <b>a hermaphrodite,</b> one <b>is liable to</b> be punished with <b>stoning on his account as if</b> one had relations with <b>a male.</b>
