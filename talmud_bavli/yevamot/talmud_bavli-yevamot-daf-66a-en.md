The Gemara asks: <b>Are</b> women <b>not commanded</b> to be fruitful and multiply? <b>Didn’t Rav Aḥa bar Rav Ketina say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> There was <b>an incident with a certain woman who</b> was <b>half-slave and half-free woman</b> and therefore could marry neither a Canaanite slave nor a Jew, <b>and they forced her master and he made her a free</b> woman. Presumably, the reason the court forced her master to free her was so that she could fulfill the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The reason they forced her master to free her was because others <b>treated her in a loose manner.</b> Since she knew that she could not marry she engaged in promiscuous activity, and the court forced her master to free her in order to save her and others from sin.
