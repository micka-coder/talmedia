and <b>drizzle [<i>urpila</i>] is even beneficial to a seed [<i>partzida</i>] under a clod</b> of earth, as it can reach anywhere without causing any harm. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the word <b>drizzle?</b> The Gemara explains: It is a contraction of the phrase: <b>Arise, furrows [<i>uru pilei</i>]. And</b> the Gemara cites another saying in which Rava uses the same imagery. <b>Rava said: This Torah scholar [<i>tzurva</i>] is like a seed under a clod</b> of earth, <b>as once he sprouts</b> and begins to develop, <b>he</b> continues to <b>sprout</b> and his greatness increases.

### Part 2
§ <b>And,</b> incidentally, the Gemara relates that which <b>Rava said: This Torah scholar who grows angry,</b> it can be presumed that <b>it is his Torah study that angers him.</b> Therefore, he must be given the benefit of the doubt, <b>as it is stated: “Is not my word like fire, says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29). <b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rav Ashi said: Any Torah scholar who is not as hard as iron,</b> but is indecisive and wavers, he <b>is not a Torah scholar, as it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“And as a hammer that breaks rock in pieces”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29).

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi: You learned</b> the proof for this idea <b>from</b> that verse <b>there; we learned it from here, as it is written: “A land whose stones [<i>avaneha</i>] are iron”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9). <b>Do not read</b> this phrase as <b>“whose stones [<i>avaneha</i>],” rather,</b> read it as <b>whose builders [<i>boneha</i>],</b> since Torah scholars build the land spiritually and are as tough as iron. With regard to these statements praising the toughness of a Torah scholar, <b>Ravina said: And even so, one is required to teach himself to act gently, as it is stated: “And remove anger from your heart,</b> and put away evil from your flesh” (Ecclesiastes 11:10).

### Part 4
As a preamble to the statement of Rabbi Berekhya, below, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: Three</b> people <b>entreated</b> God in an <b>unreasonable</b> manner, i.e., in situations where their requests might have received an unfavorable answer. <b>To two</b> of them God <b>responded reasonably,</b> with a favorable response to their requests, <b>and to one</b> God <b>responded unreasonably,</b> i.e., unfavorably, in a manner befitting the unreasonable request. <b>And they are: Eliezer, servant of Abraham; Saul, son of Kish; and Jephthah the Gileadite.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara clarifies each of these cases in turn: With regard to <b>Eliezer, servant of Abraham,</b> he made a request when he prayed beside the well, <b>as it is written: “That the maiden to whom I shall say: Please let down your pitcher</b> that I may drink; and she shall say: Drink, and I will also give your camels to drink; that she be the one whom you have appointed for your servant Isaac” (Genesis 24:14). Eliezer entreated God unreasonably, as his request allowed for the possibility that she <b>might even</b> be <b>lame</b> or <b>even blind,</b> and yet he had promised to take her to Isaac. Nevertheless, God <b>responded</b> to him <b>reasonably and</b> the eminently suitable <b>Rebecca happened</b> to come <b>to him.</b>

### Part 6
With regard to <b>Saul, son of Kish,</b> he made an offer when Goliath the Philistine challenged the Jews, <b>as it is written: “And it shall be that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter”</b> (I Samuel 17:25). The man who killed Goliath <b>might even</b> have been <b>a slave or a <i>mamzer</i>,</b> one born from an incestuous or adulterous union, who would be unfit to marry his daughter. Nevertheless, God <b>responded</b> to him <b>reasonably and David happened</b> to come <b>to him.</b>

### Part 7
By contrast, there is the case of <b>Jephthah the Gileadite.</b> Upon leaving for battle he issued a statement, <b>as it is written: “Then it shall be that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house</b> to meet me when I return in peace…it shall be to the Lord and I will bring it up for a burnt-offering” (Judges 11:31). This <b>might even</b> have been <b>an impure,</b> non-kosher <b>animal,</b> which he had committed himself to sacrifice. In this instance, God <b>responded</b> to him <b>unreasonably, and his daughter happened</b> to come <b>to him.</b>

### Part 8
Regarding the incident of Jephthah, the Gemara remarks: <b>And this is what the prophet said to the Jewish people: “Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there?</b> Why then has the health of the daughter of my people not recovered?” (Jeremiah 8:22). This verse alludes to the fact that had he sought a means to do so, Jephthah could have had his vow annulled.

### Part 9
<b>And it is written,</b> with regard to human sacrifice: “And they have also built the high places of the Ba’al, to burn their sons in the fire for burnt offerings to Ba’al, <b>which I did not command, and I did not speak, nor did it come into My heart”</b> (Jeremiah 19:5).

### Part 10
The Gemara interprets each phrase of this verse: <b>“Which I did not command,” this</b> is referring to <b>the son of Mesha, king of Moab.</b> King Mesha sacrificed his son, <b>as it is stated: “Then he took his firstborn son, who would reign after him, and he offered him as a burnt-offering”</b> (II Kings 3:27). <b>“And I did not speak,” this</b> is referring to <b>Jephthah,</b> who sacrificed his daughter as an offering. <b>“Nor did it come into my heart,” this</b> is referring to <b>Isaac, son of Abraham.</b> Although God commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, there was no intent in God’s heart that he should actually do so; it was merely a test.

### Part 11
§ In light of the above statement, the Gemara returns to the issue of rain. <b>Rabbi Berekhya said: The Congregation of Israel also entreated</b> God <b>unreasonably, and</b> yet <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, responded reasonably, as it is stated: “And let us know, eagerly strive to know the Lord. His going forth is sure as the morning, and He will come to us as the rain”</b> (Hosea 6:3). They compared the revelation of God to the rain.

### Part 12
In response, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to</b> the Jewish people: <b>My daughter, you request</b> the manifestation of My Presence by comparing Me to <b>a matter,</b> rain, <b>that is sometimes desired, but is sometimes undesired,</b> e.g., during the summer. <b>However, I will be to you</b> like <b>a matter that is always desired,</b> dew, <b>as it is stated: “I will be as the dew to Israel”</b> (Hosea 14:6), since dew appears in all seasons and is invariably a blessing.

### Part 13
<b>And</b> the Congregation of Israel <b>further entreated</b> God <b>unreasonably</b> in another context, <b>saying before Him: Master of the Universe: “Set me as a seal upon Your heart, as a seal upon Your arm”</b> (Song of Songs 8:6). <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to her: My daughter, you ask</b> that I be manifest to you in <b>a matter that is sometimes visible and sometimes not visible,</b> as the heart and arm are not covered. <b>However, I will act</b> so that I manifest Myself <b>for you</b> like <b>a matter that is always visible, as it is stated: “Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of My hands,</b> your walls are continually before me” (Isaiah 49:16).

### Part 14
§ The Gemara returns to the <i>halakhot</i> of the mishna: <b>One requests rain</b> only immediately preceding the rainy season. The Sages <b>assumed that requesting and mentioning are one</b> and the same <b>thing,</b> and consequently they asked: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that <b>Rava said: It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, who said</b> that one mentions rain <b>from the time of putting down</b> the <i>lulav</i>, i.e., the Eighth Day of Assembly, which is indeed near the rainy season.

### Part 15
<b>Abaye said to him: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that <b>it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who holds that one mentions rain from the first day of the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, this ruling of the mishna can be explained by distinguishing between the two terms: <b>Requesting is</b> a <b>discrete</b> concept <b>and mentioning is</b> another <b>discrete</b> concept. In other words, even according to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, one begins to request rain just before the rainy season, on the Eighth Day of Assembly, whereas one starts to mention rain already on the first day of <i>Sukkot</i>.

### Part 16
<b>And some say</b> a different version of this discussion: <b>Let us say</b>
