### Part 1
The <i>halakha</i> is <b>that which you said,</b> that <b>one may fast for</b> a few <b>hours,</b> provided that one took a fast of a few hours upon himself, <b>and that he</b> fasted and <b>did not taste anything until the evening. Abaye said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>This</b> ruling is obvious, since <b>it is a full-fledged fast,</b> as one ultimately fasts the entire day. Rav Ḥisda answered: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to say this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where he changed his mind,</b> i.e., he began the day without intending to fast, but for various reasons he did not eat, and halfway through the day he decided to continue fasting for another few hours until nightfall. Rav Ḥisda maintains that this kind of fasting for hours is considered a fast.

### Part 2
<b>And Rav Ḥisda said: Any fast upon which the sun does not set,</b> i.e., when one eats in the middle of the day, it <b>is not called a fast</b> at all. The Gemara <b>raises an objection: The members of the priestly watch,</b> the priests and Levites who are serving in the Temple that week, <b>fast</b> on a communal fast, like the members of the non-priestly watch who are attached to specific groups of priests, <b>but they do not complete</b> the fast with the rest of the community. This indicates that even a fast lasting only a few hours is called a fast. The Gemara explains: <b>There</b> they abstained from food <b>merely to cause themselves distress,</b> as an act of solidarity with the rest of the community, but this was not considered a full-fledged fast.

### Part 3
The Gemara cites another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, said: I am a descendant of Senaah, son of</b> the tribe of <b>Benjamin, and once the Ninth of Av occurred on Shabbat, and we postponed</b> the fast <b>until after Shabbat,</b> as Shabbat supersedes the fast of the Ninth of Av. <b>And we fasted on that</b> day, <b>but we did not complete</b> the fast, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the tenth of Av <b>is a holiday of ours,</b> a private holiday for our family (26a), and one does not fast on holidays. This proves that a fast of only a few hours is nevertheless called a fast. The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>There too,</b> they did so <b>merely to cause themselves distress.</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara again attempts to disprove the opinion of Rav Ḥisda, this time by citing a custom of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> occasionally <b>said: I shall be in</b> observance of <b>a fast until I come to my house.</b> This indicates that one can take a fast upon himself even for just a few hours. The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>There he did</b> this <b>to excuse himself from the household of the <i>Nasi</i>.</b> At times, Rabbi Yoḥanan received an invitation to dine at the house of the <i>Nasi</i>, but wanted to decline. To avoid insulting the <i>Nasi</i>, he would say that he had taken a fast upon himself, and afterward he would eat at home. Since this was not a real fast, it is not proof of the legitimacy of a partial-day fast.

### Part 5
<b>Shmuel said: Any fast that one did not take upon himself while it was still day</b> is <b>not called a fast.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And if</b> one happened to <b>sit</b> in observance of a fast that day, <b>what</b> is that considered? <b>Rabba bar Sheila said:</b> He is <b>likened to a bellows that is full of air.</b> His behavior does not constitute a fast, as he is merely a container full of air, without food.

### Part 6
§ The Gemara asks: <b>When</b> does one <b>take</b> a fast <b>upon himself? Rav said:</b> One takes a fast upon himself <b>in the afternoon</b> of the day preceding the fast, from midday onward. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> One must take a fast upon himself for the following day <b>at</b> the end of <b>the afternoon prayer. Rav Yosef said:</b> It <b>stands to reason</b> that the halakha should be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, as it is written in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>,</b> after a list of all of the Festivals established by the Sages in commemoration of various events throughout Jewish history: <b>Therefore, whoever has bound himself beforehand</b> with an obligation to fast on one of these commemorative days, he <b>will be bound.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara explains the apparent proof from the text of <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>. <b>What, is it not</b> the case that this means that <b>he binds himself</b> to the obligation <b>at</b> the time of <b>prayer,</b> and if he did not do so at that point in time his fast does not go into effect? The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>No;</b> the text should be amended by one letter so that it does not read <i>yeisar</i>, he shall bind himself, but <i>yei’aser</i>, <b>he shall render himself prohibited</b> from transgressing these instructions. In other words, the text is explaining that despite a prior vow to fast, it is prohibited for one to do so on the commemorative days enumerated in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>.

### Part 8
The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>disagree</b> with regard to <b>this</b> dispute. <b>One</b> of them <b>said</b> that the text of <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> reads: He <b>will be bound, and</b> the other <b>one said</b> that it reads: He <b>will be prohibited. The one who said:</b> He <b>will be bound, this is as we</b> just <b>say.</b> However, <b>according to the one who said:</b> He <b>will be prohibited, what</b> does <b>it</b> mean?

### Part 9
The Gemara explains: This is <b>as it is taught in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>: Whoever has taken upon himself beforehand</b> to fast on one of these Festivals days, he <b>will be prohibited</b> to eat and drink. <b>How so?</b> With regard to <b>an individual who took upon himself</b> to fast on each <b>Monday, Thursday, and Monday</b> series <b>of the entire year, and the</b> commemorative <b>holidays</b> written <b>in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> occurred on</b> these days, <b>if his vow preceded our decree,</b> i.e., the decree of the Sages establishing these commemorative days, <b>his vow annuls our decree</b> and he must fast, <b>but if our decree preceded his vow, our decree annuls his vow</b> and he may not fast on those days.

### Part 10
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Until when may one eat and drink</b> on communal fasts, when one fasts during the day but not the preceding evening? <b>Until dawn.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: Until the call of the rooster,</b> which is before dawn. <b>Abaye said: They taught</b> this ruling, that one may eat all night, <b>only if he has not finished his evening meal,</b> as he may continue eating the same meal all night. <b>However,</b> if he has <b>finished his meal, he may not eat</b> any more.

### Part 11
<b>Rava raised an objection to</b> Abaye from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one finished his meal and stood up,</b> nevertheless, <b>he may eat</b> more. This shows that one may in fact eat throughout the night, even if he has finished his meal. Abaye answered: <b>There</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a situation <b>where he has not</b> yet <b>removed</b> or cleared the table, and therefore it is as though he has not yet finished his meal. <b>Some say</b> a slightly different version of this discussion. <b>Rava said: They taught</b> this ruling <b>only if he did not sleep</b> after eating, <b>but</b> if <b>he slept he may not eat</b> anything else that night. <b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rava from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one slept and arose</b> from his sleep during the night, <b>he may eat.</b> Rava explained: <b>There</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to one who was merely <b>dozing,</b> and was not fully asleep.

### Part 12
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>dozing? Rav Ashi said:</b>
