### Part 1
is in a case <b>where he is sitting in a boat.</b> The traveler must be concerned about his food supply, but he need not worry that the jostling of the road might force him to exert himself, which has a tendency to cause digestive problems. <b>Alternatively,</b> the practical difference is in a case <b>where he is traveling from station [<i>avna</i>] to station.</b> Here the exertion of the road might cause digestive problems, but one need not be concerned about running out of food, as he can resupply along the way.

### Part 2
The Gemara relates that when <b>Rav Pappa</b> traveled, along <b>each and every parasang</b> he would <b>eat one</b> loaf of <b>bread.</b> Rav Pappa did so because he <b>maintained</b> that the prohibition was <b>due to</b> the <b>bowels,</b> and as he was healthy he was not concerned that travel by road would irritate his digestion.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Anyone who</b> has food for himself but nevertheless <b>starves himself in years of famine will be saved from an unusual death, as it is stated: “In famine, He will redeem you from death”</b> (Job 5:20). This is derived from the precise wording of the verse. According to its straightforward meaning, instead of “in famine,” it <b>should have</b> said: <b>From famine,</b> as one is delivered from famine. <b>Rather, this is what</b> the verse <b>is saying: As a reward for starving himself in years of famine,</b> Job <b>will be saved from an unusual death.</b>

### Part 4
Similarly, <b>Reish Lakish said: It is prohibited for a person to have conjugal relations in years of famine,</b> so that children not be born during these difficult years. <b>As it is stated: “And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came”</b> (Genesis 41:50). It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Nevertheless, <b>those without children may have marital relations in years of famine,</b> as they must strive to fulfill the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply.

### Part 5
Likewise, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When the Jewish people is immersed in distress, and one of them separates himself</b> from the community and does not share their suffering, the <b>two ministering angels who accompany a person come and place their hands on his head,</b> as though he was an offering, <b>and say: This</b> man, <b>so-and-so, who has separated himself from the community, let him not see the consolation of the community.</b>

### Part 6
A similar idea <b>is taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>When the community is immersed in suffering, a person may not say: I will go to my home and I will eat and drink, and peace be upon you, my soul. And if he does so, the verse says about him: “And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine; let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die”</b> (Isaiah 22:13). <b>And</b> the prophecy continues with <b>what is written afterward,</b> in the following verse: <b>“And the Lord of hosts revealed Himself in my ears: Surely this iniquity shall not be expiated by you until you die”</b> (Isaiah 22:14).

### Part 7
The <i>baraita</i> comments: Up <b>to this point</b> is the <b>attribute of middling people,</b> who merely exclude themselves from the suffering of the community. <b>However,</b> with regard <b>to</b> the <b>attribute of wicked people, what is written</b> about those who hope for more of these days? <b>“Come, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day,</b> and much more abundant” (Isaiah 56:12). <b>And what is written afterward? “The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart,</b> and godly men are taken away, none considering <b>that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come”</b> (Isaiah 57:1). This verse teaches that righteous people suffer early death to prevent them from witnessing the harm that will befall these evil people.

### Part 8
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rather, a person should be distressed together with the community. As we found with Moses our teacher that he was distressed together with the community, as it is stated</b> during the war with Amalek: <b>“But Moses’ hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat upon it”</b> (Exodus 17:12). <b>But didn’t Moses have one pillow or one cushion to sit upon;</b> why was he forced to sit on a rock? <b>Rather, Moses said as follows: Since the Jewish people are immersed in suffering, I too will be with them in suffering,</b> as much as I am able, although I am not participating in the fighting. The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And anyone who is distressed together with the community will merit seeing the consolation of the community.</b>

### Part 9
The <i>baraita</i> further states: <b>And lest a person say,</b> I have acted in secret; <b>who will testify against me</b> on the Day of Judgment? The <i>tanna</i> explains that the <b>stones of a person’s house and</b> the <b>beams of a person’s house</b> will <b>testify against him, as it is stated: “For a stone shall cry out from the wall, and a beam out of the timber shall answer it”</b> (Habakkuk 2:11). In <b>the school of Rabbi Sheila they say:</b> The <b>two ministering angels who accompany a person</b> will <b>testify against him, as it is stated: “For He will give His angels charge over you,</b> to keep you in all your ways” (Psalms 91:11).

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Ḥidka said: A person’s soul</b> will <b>testify against him, as it is stated: “Keep the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your bosom”</b> (Micah 7:5). <b>And some say: A man’s limbs</b> will <b>testify against him, as it is stated: “You are My witnesses, says the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 43:10).

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> cites another verse that deals with judgment. <b>“A God of faithfulness and without iniquity,</b> He is just and righteous” (Deuteronomy 32:4). The <i>baraita</i> interprets <b>“a God of faithfulness”</b> to mean that <b>just as punishment is exacted from the wicked in the World-to-Come even for a light transgression that they commit, so too, punishment is exacted from the righteous in this world for a light transgression that they commit.</b> The righteous suffer their punishment in this world to purify them so they can enjoy the World-to-Come.

### Part 12
The <i>baraita</i> turns to the second section of the verse: <b>“And without iniquity.”</b> This teaches that <b>just as reward is paid to the righteous in the World-to-Come even for a minor mitzva that they fulfill, so too, reward is paid to the wicked in this world for even a minor mitzva that they fulfill,</b> to give the wicked all the reward they deserve for the performance of mitzvot in this world, and deprive them of any share in the World-to-Come.

### Part 13
With regard to the third section of the verse: <b>“He is just and righteous,”</b> the Sages <b>said: At the hour of a person’s departure to his eternal home, all his deeds are enumerated before him</b> and are rendered visible to him once again, <b>and</b> the deeds themselves <b>say to him: You did such and such, in such and such a place, on such and such a day, and he says: Yes,</b> that is exactly what happened. <b>And they say to him: Sign</b> a statement that this is correct, <b>and he signs</b> it, <b>as it is stated: “He makes the hand of every man sign”</b> (Job 37:7). <b>And not only that,</b> but after a one has been shown all his deeds, <b>he justifies the judgment upon himself, and says to them: You have judged me well.</b> This response serves <b>to fulfill that which is stated: “That You may be justified when You speak and be right when You judge”</b> (Psalms 51:6).

### Part 14
§ The Gemara returns to the primary topic of the tractate, the issue of fasts. <b>Shmuel said: Whoever sits in</b> observance of <b>a fast is called a sinner,</b> as it is inappropriate to take unnecessary suffering upon oneself. The Gemara comments: Shmuel <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the following <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the Great says: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states,</b> with regard to a nazirite: <b>“And he will atone for him for that he sinned by the soul [<i>nefesh</i>]”</b> (Numbers 6:11). <b>But with what soul did this</b> nazirite <b>sin? Rather,</b> the nazirite sinned <b>by</b> the <b>distress</b> he caused <b>himself when he abstained from wine,</b> in accordance with the terms of his vow.

### Part 15
<b>And are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>? And if this</b> nazirite, <b>who distressed himself</b> by abstaining <b>only from wine, is</b> nevertheless <b>called a sinner</b> and requires atonement, then with regard to <b>one who distresses himself</b> by abstaining <b>from each and every matter</b> of food and drink when he fasts, <b>all the more so</b> should he be considered a sinner.

### Part 16
Conversely, <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> One who accepts a fast upon himself is <b>called sacred, as it is stated</b> with regard to the nazirite: <b>“He shall be sacred, he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long”</b> (Numbers 6:5). Here too, one can apply an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>And if this</b> nazirite, <b>who distressed himself</b> by abstaining <b>from only one matter,</b> wine, is nevertheless <b>called sacred,</b> then with regard to <b>one who distresses himself</b> by abstaining from <b>every matter, all the more so</b> should he be considered sacred.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> the nazirite <b>is</b> indeed <b>called sacred,</b> as stated by Rabbi Elazar. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is referring to</b> the sanctity of the <b>growth of the locks,</b> as the nazirite’s hair does possess an element of sanctity, but it does not refer to the nazirite himself. The Gemara reverses the question: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> the nazirite <b>is called a sinner.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>refers</b> specifically <b>to</b> a nazirite <b>who rendered himself ritually impure</b> by coming into contact with a dead body, an act that is prohibited for him. This particular nazirite must bring an offering to atone “for that he sinned by the soul.”

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Elazar</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that fasting is a virtuous act? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Elazar say: A person should always consider himself</b>
