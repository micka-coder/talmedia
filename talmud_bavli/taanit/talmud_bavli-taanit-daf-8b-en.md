### Part 1
Reish Lakish elaborates: <b>Closing up is stated with regard to a woman</b> who cannot give birth, <b>as it is stated: “For the Lord has fast close up all the wombs”</b> (Genesis 20:18), <b>and closing up is stated with regard to rains, as it is written: “And He will close up the heavens”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:17).

### Part 2
Likewise, an expression of <b>giving birth is stated with regard to a woman, and</b> an expression of <b>giving birth is</b> also <b>stated with regard to rain.</b> Specifically, <b>giving birth is stated with regard to a woman, as it is written</b> in the case of Rachel, when God had mercy on her: <b>“And she conceived and gave birth to a son”</b> (Genesis 30:23). <b>And giving birth is stated with regard to rain, as it is written:</b> “For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and does not return there, except it waters the earth <b>and causes it to give birth and bud”</b> (Isaiah 55:10).

### Part 3
Lastly, an expression of <b>remembering is stated</b> in connection <b>with a woman, and</b> an expression of <b>remembering is</b> also <b>stated</b> in connection <b>to rain. Remembering is stated</b> in connection <b>with a woman, as it is written: “And the Lord remembered Sarah”</b> (Genesis 21:1), <b>and remembering is stated</b> in connection <b>to rain, as it is written: “You have remembered the earth and have watered it; greatly enriching it, with the pool of God that is full of water”</b> (Psalms 65:10).

### Part 4
The Gemara asks a question with regard to this verse. <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“With the pool of God that is full of water”?</b> The Gemara answers that it was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There is a kind of vault [<i>kuba</i>] in the sky, out of which the rain falls.</b>

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “Whatever he commands them upon the face of the habitable world, <b>whether it is for correction, or for His earth, or for mercy that He causes it to come”</b> (Job 37:12–13)? The phrase <b>“whether it is for correction”</b> means that if the people are judged unfavorably, the rain will fall <b>on the mountains and on the hills.</b> The phrase “or for His earth” indicates that if they have been judged <b>“for mercy,” He will cause it to come “for His earth,” on the fields and on the vineyards.</b>

### Part 6
Alternatively, the phrase <b>“whether it is for correction”</b> means that the rain will provide benefit only <b>for the trees; “or for His earth”</b> indicates that rain will fall solely for the benefit <b>of seeds;</b> and <b>“or for mercy that He causes it to come”</b> means that rain will fill the <b>cisterns, ditches, and caves</b> with enough water to last the dry season.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara relates: <b>In the days of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani there was a famine and a plague.</b> The Sages <b>said: What</b> should we <b>do? Should we pray for mercy for two</b> troubles, both the famine and the plague? This is <b>not possible,</b> as it is improper to pray for the alleviation of two afflictions at once. <b>Rather, let us pray for mercy for the plague, and</b> as for the <b>famine, we</b> must <b>bear</b> it. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said to them:</b> On the contrary, <b>let us pray for mercy for the famine, as when the Merciful One provides plenty, He gives it for</b> the sake of <b>the living,</b> i.e., if God answers this prayer then he will certainly bring an end to the plague as well, <b>as it is written: “You open Your hand and satisfy every living thing with favor”</b> (Psalms 145:16).

### Part 8
The Gemara explains: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> one should not pray <b>for two</b> troubles simultaneously? <b>As it is written: “So we fasted and beseeched our God for this”</b> (Ezra 8:23). <b>From the fact</b> that the verse states: “For this,” it may be inferred <b>that there is another</b> trouble about which the people did not pray. <b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say in the name of Rabbi Ḥaggai</b> that this idea comes <b>from here: “That they might ask mercy of the God of Heaven concerning this secret”</b> (Daniel 2:18). <b>From the fact</b> that the verse states: “This secret,” it may be inferred <b>that there is another</b> trouble about which they did not pray.

### Part 9
In a similar vein, the Gemara relates: <b>In the days of Rabbi Zeira a decree of</b> religious <b>persecution</b> was decreed against the Jews. <b>And</b> as the <b>decree</b> was <b>that they were not</b> allowed <b>to fast,</b> the Jews were certainly unable to fast and pray for the nullification of the decree itself. <b>Rabbi Zeira said to</b> the people: <b>Let us take</b> a fast <b>upon ourselves,</b> despite the fact that in practice we cannot observe it, <b>and when</b> the decree of religious <b>persecution is annulled we will observe the fast.</b>

### Part 10
<b>They said to him: From where do you</b> know <b>this,</b> the fact that one may take a fast upon himself that he cannot observe? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to them</b> that the reason is <b>as it is written: “Then he said to me: Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to fast before your God, your words were heard”</b> (Daniel 10:12). This verse indicates that from the moment one turns his heart to fast, his prayers are heard.

### Part 11
The Gemara returns to the topic of rain. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Even</b> in <b>years like the years of Elijah,</b> when God decreed that no rain would fall, if <b>rain falls on Shabbat eves it is nothing other</b> than <b>a sign of a curse,</b> as the rain disrupts the preparations for Shabbat. <b>This is</b> the same as that <b>which Rabba bar Sheila said: A rainy day is as difficult as a judgment day. Ameimar</b> even <b>said: Were</b> it <b>not</b> for the fact <b>that</b> rain is needed <b>by people, we would pray for mercy and</b> to <b>annul it,</b> due to the nuisances that rain causes.

### Part 12
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Sun on Shabbat is charity for the poor,</b> who are then able to enjoy the outdoors without suffering from cold. <b>As it is stated: “But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in its wings”</b> (Malachi 3:20). <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> further <b>said: The day of the rains is great, as even a <i>peruta</i> in</b> one’s <b>pocket is blessed on it, as it is stated: “To give the rain of your land in its due time, and to bless all the work of your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:12).

### Part 13
<b>And</b> apropos blessings, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A blessing is found only in an object that is hidden [<i>samui</i>] from the eye,</b> not in an item visible to all, as public miracles are exceedingly rare. <b>As it is stated: “The Lord will command His blessing upon you in your barns [<i>ba’asamekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:8). Rabbi Yitzḥak’s exposition is based on the linguistic similarity between <i>samui</i> and <i>asamekha</i>. Likewise, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: A blessing is found only in an object that is not exposed to the eye, as it is stated: “The Lord will command His blessing upon you in your barns.”</b>

### Part 14
<b>The Sages taught: One who enters to measure</b> produce <b>in his granary recites: May it be Your will, Lord our God, that You send a blessing upon the work of our hands.</b> After he has <b>begun to measure, he recites: Blessed</b> is He <b>who sends a blessing upon this pile.</b> If one first <b>measured and afterward recited the blessing, it is a prayer</b> in <b>vain, as a blessing is not found either in an object that is weighed or in an object that is measured or in an object that is counted,</b> as these would constitute open miracles. <b>Rather,</b> a blessing is found only <b>in an object that is hidden from the eye.</b>

### Part 15
§ The Gemara cites five statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan, in accordance with the following <b>mnemonic: Ingathering; armies; charity; tithe; sustainer. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The day of the rains is as great as the day of the ingathering of the exiles, as it is stated: “Turn our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the dry land”</b> (Psalms 126:4), <b>and “streams”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>rain, as it is stated: “And the streams of the sea appeared”</b> (II Samuel 22:16).

### Part 16
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The day of the rains is great, as even armies stop fighting on it</b> due to the rain and mud. <b>As it is stated: “Watering its ridges abundantly; settling down its furrows [<i>gedudeha</i>]”</b> (Psalms 65:11). As the word <i>gedudim</i> can mean both furrows or armies and is spelled identically with each meaning, this alludes to the idea that during the rainy season soldiers become entrenched in place. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> further <b>said: Rain is withheld only due to those who pledge charity in public but do not give</b> it, <b>as it is stated: “As vapors and wind without rain, so is he who boasts of a false gift”</b> (Proverbs 25:14).

### Part 17
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b>
