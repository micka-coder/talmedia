### Part 1
In the case of <b>one who vows</b> to prohibit from himself a type of benefit <b>until the rains,</b> the vow is in effect <b>from when the rains</b> begin to <b>fall until the second rainfall,</b> as this is considered the time of the rains.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Zevid said:</b> The time of the second rainfall is also significant with regard to a <i>halakha</i> that deals <b>with olives, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>From when is any person permitted to</b> collect <b>gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and <i>pe’a</i>,</b> produce of the corners of a field, which may normally be taken only by the poor? Any individual is permitted to collect them only <b>from when the searchers [<i>namoshot</i>],</b> the last of the poor to arrive, <b>have left</b> the field. From when may anyone collect yield of the vineyard in the case <b>of</b> the <b>single grapes and small, incompletely formed clusters of grapes,</b> likewise reserved for the poor? <b>From when the poor have left the vineyard and come</b> back after the second time, an indication that they have collected all that they wish. From when may anyone collect yield of the trees in the case <b>of</b> forgotten <b>olives? From when the second rainfall falls.</b>

### Part 3
Incidentally, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the term for searchers, <b><i>namoshot</i>? Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is referring to <b>elders who walk with a staff [<i>atigra</i>].</b> Since they walk very slowly, they certainly see everything they wish to collect. <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> It is referring to the <b>gleaners</b> who come <b>after</b> all the <b>gleaners,</b> i.e., who arrive after two rounds of the poor have passed through the field.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that the time of the second rainfall is significant <b>so that</b> one can know until when it is permitted <b>to walk on the permitted paths</b> in fields. One may utilize certain paths on private property, provided no damage is caused to the field. <b>As the Master said: Anyone</b> may <b>walk on the permitted paths until the second rainfall falls.</b> One who walks on them at a later point in time is likely to trample the plowed field and damage its crops.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that the time of the second rainfall is significant for determining when <b>to remove the produce of the Sabbatical Year</b> from one’s possession. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Until when may one derive benefit and burn</b> the <b>straw and</b> the <b>hay of the Sabbatical Year? Until the second rainfall falls.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that one must remove the produce of the Sabbatical Year from one’s possession? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to the Sabbatical Year: <b>“And for your cattle and for the beasts in your land</b> all its increase shall be for food” (Leviticus 25:7). This verse indicates that <b>as long as a beast,</b> i.e., a non-domesticated animal, is able to find and <b>eat</b> produce <b>in the field, you</b> may <b>feed your cattle,</b> your domesticated animals, from that type of food <b>in the house.</b> However, when a given type of produce <b>has ceased</b> to be available <b>to the beast in the field, cease</b> providing it to <b>your cattle in the house.</b> After the time of the second rainfall there is no longer any straw or hay in the fields.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara returns to the subject of rain. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: What is</b> the meaning of the <b>term</b> for rainfall, <b><i>revia</i>?</b> It is referring to <b>a matter that penetrates [<i>rove’a</i>],</b> i.e., which causes <b>the earth</b> to bear fruit. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda said: Rain is the husband of the earth, as it is stated: “For as the rain comes down and the snow from heaven, and returns not there, except it waters the earth, and makes it give birth and sprout”</b> (Isaiah 55:10). This verse indicates that rain fructifies the earth in the manner of a husband and wife.

### Part 8
<b>And Rabbi Abbahu</b> further <b>said:</b> For rainfall to be considered the <b>first rainfall</b> it must be <b>sufficient to enter the ground</b> and saturate it to a depth of one <b>handbreadth.</b> The <b>second</b> rainfall must be <b>sufficient</b> that the soil is moistened enough <b>to seal the opening of a barrel with its</b> mud. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Rains which fall</b> and create <b>sufficient</b> mud <b>to seal the opening of a barrel with them</b> means that the year <b>does not constitute</b> a fulfillment of the verse: <b>“And He will close up</b> the heavens and there will be no rain” (Deuteronomy 11:17).

### Part 9
<b>And Rav Ḥisda said: Rain that falls</b> early in the day, <b>prior to</b> the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, which includes the verse: <b>“And He will close up</b> the heavens,” is enough to ensure that the hour <b>does not constitute</b> a fulfillment of the verse: <b>“And He will close up</b> the heavens,” even if no more rain falls at that time.

### Part 10
<b>Abaye said: We said</b> this <b>only</b> if the rain fell during the day, <b>prior to</b> the recitation of <b>“and He will close up” of the evening</b> <i>Shema</i>. <b>However,</b> if a small amount of rain falls <b>prior to</b> the recitation of <b>“and He will close up” of the morning</b> <i>Shema</i>, <b>this</b> rain could still <b>constitute</b> an expression of <b>“and He will close up.” As Rav Yehuda bar Yitzḥak said: These morning clouds have no substance;</b> they generally yield minimal or no rain. <b>As it is written: “What can I do for you, Ephraim, what can I do for you, Judah, for your goodness is like a morning cloud”</b> (Hosea 6:4). This verse indicates that morning clouds contain little benefit.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But people say</b> the well-known maxim: <b>When the gates,</b> i.e., doors, <b>are opened</b> in the morning and <b>there is rain, donkey-driver, fold your sack</b> and go to <b>sleep,</b> as it is certain to rain all day, which will render the work of donkey-drivers infeasible. This shows that morning clouds are a sign that it will rain all day. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement of Rav Pappa is referring to <b>when</b> the sky is <b>overcast with heavy clouds,</b> from which rain will fall all day, whereas <b>that</b> statement of Rav Ḥisda is referring to a morning <b>when</b> the sky is <b>overcast with light clouds</b> which will not bring substantial rain.

### Part 12
§ <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> It is <b>good for the year when</b> the month of <b>Tevet is a widower,</b> i.e., when it features no rainfall. The Gemara explains: <b>Some say</b> that this is so <b>that the gardens [<i>tarbitzei</i>]</b> should <b>not be desolate,</b> as too much rain damages vegetables. <b>And some say:</b> The reason is <b>that it</b> should <b>not suffer blight</b> caused by excessive rain. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Ḥisda say:</b> It is <b>good for the year when</b> the month of <b>Tevet is disgusting,</b> i.e., muddy from rain. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement of Rav Yehuda is referring to a year <b>when it rained initially,</b> i.e., before Tevet, in which case rain during Tevet is not beneficial. <b>That</b> statement of Rav Ḥisda is referring to a year <b>when it did not rain initially,</b> before Tevet, and therefore rain during Tevet is beneficial.

### Part 13
<b>And Rav Ḥisda</b> also <b>said: Rain that fell on</b> one <b>part of a country and did not fall on another part of</b> the <b>country does not constitute</b> a fulfillment of the verse: <b>“And He will close up</b> the heavens.” The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Is that so? But isn’t it written: “And I have also withheld the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest; and I would cause it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city; one piece was rained upon,</b> and the piece upon which it did not rain withered” (Amos 4:7). <b>And Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Both</b> the area that receives rain and the area that does not receive rain <b>are cursed.</b> This statement indicates that rain that falls on only part of a country is a curse.

### Part 14
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This,</b> Rav Yehuda’s statement, is referring to a case <b>when excessive</b> rain <b>falls</b> in one part of the country and causes damage; whereas <b>that,</b> Rav Ḥisda’s statement, is referring to a situation <b>when the requisite amount</b> of rain falls in one part of the country. In this case, it is not a sign of a curse, but is a blessing for that particular part of the country. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The language <b>is also precise</b> in the verse in Amos that deals with excessive rain in one place, <b>as it is written: “Was rained upon,”</b> which indicates that <b>it shall be a place of rain,</b> i.e., an area filled with rain and water. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that this is the correct interpretation.

### Part 15
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said: From when does one recite a blessing over rain? From when the groom goes out to meet the bride,</b> that is, when there are puddles of water on the ground such that the water below, represented as the bride in this metaphor, is splashed from above by the raindrops, represented as the groom.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>What blessing</b> does one recite over rain? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: We thank you, O Lord our God, for each and every drop that You have made fall for us. And Rabbi Yoḥanan concludes</b> the blessing <b>as follows: If our mouth were as full of song as the sea, and our tongue with singing like the multitude of its waves,</b> etc. And one continues with the formula of the <i>nishmat</i> prayer recited on Shabbat morning, <b>until: May Your mercy not forsake us, O Lord our God, and You have not forsaken us. Blessed</b> are You, O Lord, to Whom <b>abundant thanksgivings</b> are offered.

### Part 17
The Gemara asks: Why does the blessing specify <b>abundant thanksgivings and not all thanksgivings? Rava said:</b> Emend the formula of the blessing and <b>say: God of thanksgivings. Rav Pappa said: Therefore,</b> as there are differences of opinion on this,
