### Part 1
The Gemara asks a question concerning the explanation of Rabbi Yehuda: One who has <b>dependent</b> children <b>and does not have</b> anything with which to support them <b>is</b> apparently <b>the same as</b> one whose <b>house is empty.</b> Why does Rabbi Yehuda list both descriptions? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: This</b> expression means <b>that his house is empty of transgression. And</b> Rabbi Yehuda further said that the prayer leader must be one <b>whose youth was becoming.</b> In explanation of this phrase, <b>Abaye said: This</b> is <b>one who did not have a bad reputation</b> at any time <b>during his youth.</b>

### Part 2
The Gemara cites a verse in relation to the prayer leader: <b>“My heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest. She has uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her”</b> (Jeremiah 12:8). <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“She has uttered her voice against me”? Mar Zutra bar Toviyya said</b> that <b>Rav said, and some say Rabbi Ḥama said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: This is an unworthy prayer leader who descends before the ark.</b> When this person calls out to God, He thinks, so to speak: I hate the sound of his prayer.

### Part 3
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> the prayer leader <b>recites twenty-four blessings before them:</b> The <b>eighteen</b> blessings <b>of</b> the <b>everyday</b> <i>Amida</i> prayer, <b>to which he adds another six</b> blessings. The Gemara asks: Are <b>these six</b> blessings? In fact, <b>they are seven, as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>For the seventh he recites,</b> Blessed are You, Lord, <b>Who has mercy on the Land. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: What</b> is the meaning of the <b>seventh</b> blessing? This is referring to the <b>seventh for length,</b> i.e., there were actually six new blessings, but as the prayer leader lengthens the sixth weekday blessing it is considered an additional blessing.

### Part 4
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In</b> the blessing of: <b>Redeemer of Israel,</b> the prayer leader <b>lengthens</b> the blessing, <b>and for its conclusion he recites: He Who answered Abraham on Mount Moriah, He will answer you and hear the sound of your cry on this day. Blessed</b> are You, Lord, <b>Redeemer of Israel. And</b> the community <b>answers amen after him. And the sexton says to them: Blow</b> a long, unwavering sound, <b>sons of Aaron, blow.</b>

### Part 5
<b>And</b> the prayer leader <b>resumes and recites</b> the second blessing, concluding: <b>He Who answered our forefathers by the Red Sea, He will answer you and hear the sound of your cry on this day. Blessed</b> are You, Lord, <b>Who remembers the forgotten. And</b> the community <b>answers amen after him. And the sexton says to them: Blast</b> a wavering sound, <b>sons of Aaron, blast. And similarly,</b> this is the procedure <b>for each and every</b> additional <b>blessing: After one</b> blessing <b>he says: Blow</b> a long, unwavering sound, <b>and after</b> the next <b>one he says: Blast</b> a wavering sound.

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> This method applies <b>in the outlying areas,</b> i.e., everywhere except in the Temple. <b>However, in the Temple</b> itself this <b>is not</b> the correct procedure, <b>as one does not answer amen in the Temple.</b> Instead, one responds with a long blessing. The Gemara inquires: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that one does not answer amen in the Temple?</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>As it is stated: “Stand up and bless the Lord, your God, from everlasting to everlasting, and let them say: Blessed be Your glorious name, that is exalted above all blessing and praise”</b> (Nehemiah 9:5). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>for all blessings there should be only one praise,</b> i.e., all blessings are answered with amen. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “That is exalted above all [<i>al kol</i>] blessing and praise,”</b> which indicates that <b>for every [<i>al kol</i>] blessing,</b> you should <b>give it</b> its own <b>praise.</b>

### Part 8
<b>But</b> if so, <b>in the Temple, what</b> would the prayer leader <b>recite?</b> He would conclude the blessing: <b>Blessed be the Lord, God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Blessed</b> are You, Lord, <b>Redeemer of Israel. And</b> instead of amen, <b>they answer after him: Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom forever and all time. And the sexton says to them: Blow, priests, sons of Aaron, blow.</b>

### Part 9
<b>And</b> the prayer leader <b>resumes and recites</b> the second blessing, concluding: <b>He Who answered Abraham on Mount Moriah, He will answer you and hear the sound of your cry on this day. Blessed be the Lord, God of Israel, Who remembers the forgotten. And</b> the community <b>answers after him: Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom forever and all time. And the sexton says to them: Blast, priests, sons of Aaron, blast, etc. And similarly,</b> this is the procedure <b>for each and every</b> additional <b>blessing: After one</b> blessing <b>he says: Blow</b> a long, unwavering sound, <b>and after</b> the next <b>one he says: Blast</b> a wavering sound, <b>until he concludes all</b> the blessings.

### Part 10
§ The Gemara relates: <b>And this was the custom Rabbi Ḥalafta established in</b> the city of <b>Tzippori, and Rabbi Ḥananya ben Teradyon in</b> the city of <b>Sikhni. And when</b> this <b>matter came before the Sages, they said: They would act</b> in accordance with <b>this custom only at the Eastern Gate</b> of the Temple <b>and on the Temple Mount,</b> but not outside the Temple.

### Part 11
<b>And</b> some <b>say</b> that they acted <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And he recites twenty-four blessings before them:</b> The <b>eighteen</b> blessings <b>of</b> the <b>everyday</b> <i>Amida</i> prayer, <b>to which he adds another six</b> blessings. <b>And those</b> extra <b>six, where does he recite them? Between</b> the blessings: <b>Redeemer</b> of Israel, <b>and: Healer of the sick. And he lengthens</b> the earlier prayer <b>of redemption, and</b> the congregation <b>answers amen after him, for each and every blessing. And this was the custom in the outlying areas,</b> outside the Temple.

### Part 12
<b>However, in the Temple they would recite: Blessed be the Lord, God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Blessed</b> are You, Lord, <b>Redeemer of Israel, and they would not answer amen after him. And why</b> did the practice differ <b>so much? Because one does not answer amen in the Temple. And from where</b> is it derived <b>that one does not answer amen in the Temple? As it is stated: “Stand up and bless the Lord, your God, from everlasting to everlasting, and let them say: Blessed be Your glorious Name, that is exalted above all blessing and praise”</b> (Nehemiah 9:5). As stated above, this verse indicates that <b>for every blessing,</b> you should <b>give it</b> its own <b>praise.</b>

### Part 13
<b>The Sages taught: In</b> concluding <b>the first</b> blessing <b>he recites: Blessed be the Lord, God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Blessed</b> are You, Lord, <b>Redeemer of Israel, and they would answer after him: Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom forever and all time. And the sexton says: Blow, priests, blow. And he resumes</b> the blessings <b>and recites: He Who answered Abraham on Mount Moriah, He will answer you and hear the sound of your cry on this day. And they blow</b> a long, unwavering sound, <b>and blast</b> a wavering sound, <b>and blow. And for the second</b> blessing <b>he recites: Blessed be the Lord, God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting, who remembers the forgotten, and they would answer after him: Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom forever and all time.</b>

### Part 14
<b>And the sexton says: Blast, sons of Aaron, blast. And he recites: He Who answered our forefathers by the Red Sea, He will answer you and hear the sound of your cry on this day. And they blow, and blast, and blow. And similarly, for each and every blessing: After one he says: Blow, and after</b> the next <b>one he says: Blast, until he concludes all of them. And this was the custom Rabbi Ḥalafta established in Tzippori, and Rabbi Ḥananya ben Teradyon in Sikhni. And when</b> this <b>matter came before the Sages, they said: They would act</b> in accordance with <b>this custom only at the Eastern Gate and on the Temple Mount.</b>

### Part 15
§ The mishna taught: Rabbi Yehuda says: The prayer leader <b>did not need to recite</b> the <b>Remembrances</b> and <i>Shofarot</i> passages. Instead, he recited verses dealing with famine and suffering. <b>Rabbi Adda from Jaffa said: What is Rabbi Yehuda’s reason?</b> Rabbi Yehuda maintains <b>that one recites Remembrances and <i>Shofarot</i></b>
