### Part 1
<b>due to embarrassment,</b> to make it appear that she was baking, despite the fact that there was no bread in her house. <b>She had a certain evil neighbor</b> who <b>said</b> to herself: <b>Now, I know that they have nothing. What,</b> then, <b>is all this</b> smoke? <b>She went and knocked on the door</b> to find out what was in the oven. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa’s wife was <b>embarrassed, and she ascended to an inner room [<i>inderona</i>].</b>

### Part 2
<b>A miracle was performed for</b> Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa’s wife, <b>as</b> her neighbor <b>saw the oven filled with bread and the kneading basin filled with dough. She said to</b> Rabbi Ḥanina’s wife, calling her by name: <b>So-and-so, so-and-so, bring a shovel, as your bread is burning. She said to</b> her neighbor: <b>I too went inside for that</b> very purpose. A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught: She too had entered</b> the inner room <b>to bring a shovel, because</b> she was <b>accustomed to miracles</b> and anticipated that one would occur to spare her embarrassment.

### Part 3
The Gemara further relates: Rabbi Ḥanina’s <b>wife said to him: Until when will we continue to suffer this</b> poverty? <b>He said to her: What can we do?</b> She responded: <b>Pray for mercy that something will be given to you</b> from Heaven. <b>He prayed for mercy</b> and something <b>like</b> the <b>palm of a hand emerged and gave him one leg of a golden table. That night, his wife saw in a dream</b> that in <b>the future,</b> i.e., in the World-to-Come, <b>the righteous will eat at a golden table that has three legs, but</b> she will be eating <b>on a table that has two legs.</b>

### Part 4
When she told her husband this story, <b>he said to her: Are you content that everyone will eat at a complete table and we</b> will eat <b>at a defective table? She said to him: But what can we do? Pray for mercy, that</b> the leg of the golden table should <b>be taken from you. He prayed for mercy, and it was taken</b> from him. A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The last miracle was greater than the first, as</b> it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that Heaven gives but <b>does not take back.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara relates that <b>one</b> Shabbat <b>evening,</b> Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa <b>saw that his daughter was sad. He said to her: My daughter, why are you sad? She said to him: I confused a vessel of vinegar for a vessel of oil and I lit</b> the <b>Shabbat lamp with</b> vinegar. Soon the lamp will be extinguished and we will be left in the dark. <b>He said to her: My daughter, what are you concerned</b> about? <b>He Who said to the oil</b> that it should <b>burn can say to the vinegar</b> that it should <b>burn.</b> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught:</b> That lamp <b>burned continuously the entire day, until they brought from it light for <i>havdala</i>.</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa had some goats.</b> His neighbors <b>said to him:</b> Your goats <b>are damaging</b> our property by eating in our fields. <b>He said to them: If they are causing damage, let them be eaten by bears. But if</b> they are <b>not</b> eating your property, let <b>each of them,</b> this <b>evening, bring a bear</b> impaled <b>between its horns.</b> That <b>evening, each one brought in a bear</b> impaled <b>between its horns.</b>

### Part 7
Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa <b>had a certain neighbor who was building a house, but the ceiling beams</b> were <b>not</b> long enough to <b>reach</b> from one wall to the other. <b>She came before</b> Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa and <b>said to him: I built my house, but my</b> ceiling <b>beams do not reach the walls. He said to her: What is your name? She said to him:</b> My name is <b>Ikku.</b> He said: <b>If so [<i>ikku</i>], may your beams reach</b> your walls.

### Part 8
A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught:</b> The beams were lengthened to such an extent that they not only <b>reached</b> the walls, but they continued <b>until they jutted out a cubit from this side and a cubit from that side. And some say</b> that <b>they extended with segments [<i>senifin</i>],</b> adding new walls at both ends of the beams. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Sage <b>Palaimo says: I saw that house, and its beams jutted out a cubit on this side and a cubit on that side. And they said to me: This</b> is the <b>house that Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa roofed by means of his prayer.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara asks a question about one of the details of this story. <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa, from where did he have goats? Wasn’t he poor,</b> as stated above? <b>And furthermore, the Sages</b> have <b>said: One may not raise small, domesticated animals in Eretz Yisrael,</b> as they destroy the fields and property of others. How, then, could Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa raise goats? <b>Rav Pineḥas</b> said that this is how it came to pass: <b>An incident</b> occurred in which <b>a certain man passed by the entrance of</b> Rabbi Ḥanina’s <b>house and left chickens there. And Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa’s wife found them</b> and cared for them.

### Part 10
<b>And</b> Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said her: Do not eat of their eggs,</b> as they are not ours. <b>And</b> the chickens <b>laid many eggs, and chickens</b> hatched from the eggs. <b>And</b> as the noise and mess of the chickens <b>were distressing them, they sold them and bought goats with their proceeds. Once that same man who lost the chickens passed by and said to his companion: Here is where I left my chickens. Rabbi Ḥanina heard</b> this and <b>said to him: Do you have a sign</b> by which to identify <b>them? He said to him: Yes. He gave him the sign and took the goats.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And these are the very goats that brought bears</b> impaled <b>between their horns.</b>

### Part 11
§ The Gemara relates more stories of desperately poor righteous individuals. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat was hard-pressed</b> for money. Once <b>an act</b> of bloodletting <b>was performed on him, but he did not have anything to taste</b> afterward. <b>He took a clove of garlic and put it in his mouth. His heart became weak and he fell asleep. The Sages came to inquire</b> about <b>his</b> welfare. They <b>saw him weeping and laughing, and a ray of light was shining from his forehead.</b>

### Part 12
<b>When he awoke they said to him: What is the reason that you were laughing and crying? He said to them:</b> The reason is <b>that</b> in my dream <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, was sitting with me, and I said to Him: Until when will I suffer</b> such poverty <b>in this world? And He said to me: Elazar, My son,</b> is it more <b>convenient</b> for <b>you that I return the world to its</b> very <b>beginning? Perhaps you will be born in an hour of sustenance</b> and not be poor.

### Part 13
<b>I said before Him:</b> You suggest doing <b>all this,</b> to return the world to its beginning, <b>and</b> even then is it only <b>a possibility</b> that things will be different, not a certainty? <b>I said to Him:</b> Are the years <b>that I have</b> already <b>lived more</b> numerous, <b>or</b> are <b>that I will live</b> more numerous? <b>He said to me:</b> Those years <b>that you have lived</b> are greater. <b>I said before Him: If so, I do not want</b> You to recreate the world for the sake of a brief few years.

### Part 14
<b>He said to me: As a reward for saying: I do not want, I will give you in the World-to-Come thirteen rivers of pure balsam oil as large as the Euphrates and the Tigris for you to enjoy. I said before Him: This and no more? He said to me: But</b> if I give you more, <b>what will I give to your colleagues? I said to Him: And do I request</b> this <b>from a person, who does not have enough?</b> You are omnipotent. <b>He</b> playfully <b>snapped His finger [<i>askutla</i>] on my forehead and said to me: Elazar, my son, My arrows</b> I cast <b>upon you, My arrows.</b> This touch caused the ray of light to shine from his forehead.

### Part 15
The Gemara returns to the topic of fasting for rain. <b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina decreed a fast but rain did not come. They said to him: Didn’t Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi decree a fast and rain came? He said to them: This is I; this is a son of a Levite,</b> i.e., we are two different people of unequal stature. <b>They said to him: Let us come and focus our minds. Perhaps the hearts of</b> the members of <b>the community will break and rain will come. They prayed for mercy, but rain did not come.</b>

### Part 16
Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina <b>said to them: Are you content that rain should come on our account,</b> and through our merit? <b>They said to him: Yes. He said: Skies, skies, cover your face</b> with clouds. The sky was <b>not covered</b> with clouds. <b>He said</b> in rebuke: <b>How impudent is the face of the sky,</b> to ignore me. The sky became <b>covered</b> with clouds <b>and rain came.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara relates a similar story. <b>Levi decreed a fast but rain did not come. He said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, You have ascended and sat up high, and You do not have mercy upon Your children. Rain came, but</b> as a punishment for his harsh statement toward God, Levi <b>became lame.</b> Consequently, <b>Rav Elazar said: A person should never cast</b> harsh <b>statements toward</b> God on <b>High, as a great person cast statements toward</b> God on <b>High, and he became lame. And who was</b> this individual? <b>Levi.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> did <b>this</b> comment of Levi’s <b>cause him</b> to become lame? <b>But</b> it is stated that <b>Levi demonstrated <i>kidda</i>,</b> a particular type of bowing on one’s face, performed by the High Priest, <b>before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and he became lame</b> as a result (see <i>Megilla</i> 22b). The Gemara explains: Both <b>this and that caused his</b> lameness. As a punishment for acting improperly, he suffered an injury while he was attempting a difficult physical feat and was vulnerable.

### Part 19
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Lulyani heard these clouds saying to one another, let us go and bring water for Ammon and Moab</b> in Transjordan. <b>He said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, when You gave</b> Your <b>Torah to Your nation Israel, You approached all the nations of the world</b> to see if they would accept the Torah, <b>and they did not accept it. And</b> yet <b>now You are giving them rain. Throw</b> the water <b>here.</b> The clouds <b>threw the rain in their place</b> in Eretz Yisrael.

### Part 20
Since the Gemara has mentioned Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Lulyani, it cites a statement in his name. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Lulyani taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon”</b> (Psalms 92:13)? <b>If it is stated “palm tree” why does it state “cedar,” and if it is stated “cedar” why does it state “palm tree”?</b> What is added by this double comparison? He explains: <b>Were it stated “palm tree” and were it not stated “cedar,” I would say</b> that <b>just as</b> in the case of <b>a palm tree,</b>
