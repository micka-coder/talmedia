<b>to he who is despised of men, to he who is abhorred of nations, to a servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise”</b> (Isaiah 49:7); <b>and ministers by bowing, as it is written,</b> in the same verse: <b>“Ministers, and they shall bow.” Rabbi Zeira strongly objects to this</b> interpretation, <b>and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani</b> who objected. <b>Had</b> the verse <b>written: And ministers shall bow,</b> the meaning would have been <b>as you said.</b> However, <b>now that it is written: “Ministers, and they shall bow,”</b> this indicates that ministers will <b>do this and that,</b> i.e., they will both arise and bow.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: I too say</b> a similar idea. <b>Not all</b> are fit <b>for light, and not all</b> are fit <b>for gladness. The righteous</b> are fit to be rewarded <b>with light, and the upright</b> are fit to be rewarded <b>with gladness. The righteous</b> are fit to be rewarded <b>with light,</b> as it is written: <b>“Light is sown for the righteous”</b> (Psalms 97:11), <b>and the upright</b> are fit to be rewarded <b>with gladness, as it is written,</b> in the same verse: <b>“And gladness for the upright in heart.”</b>

### Part 4
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>What is</b> the customary <b>order of fast days?</b> Normally the sacred ark in the synagogue, which was mobile, was kept in a locked room. However, on fast days <b>they remove the ark to the</b> main <b>city square and place burnt ashes upon the ark,</b> as a sign of mourning. <b>And</b> they also place ashes <b>on the head of the <i>Nasi</i>, and on the head of the deputy <i>Nasi</i>, and each and every</b> member of the community likewise <b>places</b> ashes <b>upon his head.</b>

### Part 5
<b>The eldest</b> member <b>of the</b> community <b>says to</b> the congregation <b>statements of reproof,</b> for example: <b>Our brothers, it is not stated with regard to the people of Nineveh: And God saw their sackcloth and their fasting. Rather,</b> the verse says: <b>“And God saw their deeds, that they had turned from their evil way”</b> (Jonah 3:10). <b>And in the Prophets it says: “And rend your hearts and not your garments,</b> and return to the Lord your God” (Joel 2:13). This teaches that prayer and fasting are insufficient, as one must also repent and amend his ways in practice.

### Part 6
<b>They stood for prayer.</b> The congregation appoints <b>an elder,</b> who is <b>experienced</b> in leading prayer, <b>to descend before the ark</b> as communal prayer leader. <b>And</b> this prayer leader must <b>have children and</b> must have <b>an empty house,</b> i.e., he must be poor, <b>so that his heart will be fully</b> concentrated <b>on the prayer</b> for the needs of his community.

### Part 7
<b>And he recites twenty-four blessings before the</b> congregation: The <b>eighteen</b> blessings <b>of</b> the <b>everyday</b> <i>Amida</i> prayer, <b>to which he adds another six</b> blessings, <b>and they are</b> as follows: The special series of blessings recited on Rosh HaShana, the <b>Remembrances and <i>Shofarot</i>;</b> and the sections of Psalms that begin with the verses: <b>“In my distress I called to the Lord and He answered me”</b> (Psalms 120:1), <b>“I will lift up my eyes to the mountains;</b> from where will my help come” (Psalms 121:1), <b>“Out of the depths I have called You, O Lord”</b> (Psalms 130:1), and <b>“A prayer of the afflicted, when he faints”</b> (Psalms 102:1).

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The prayer leader <b>did not need to recite</b> the <b>Remembrances and <i>Shofarot</i></b> passages. <b>Rather, he recites instead of them</b> the passage beginning with: <b>“If there be famine in the land, if there be pestilence”</b> (I Kings 8:37), followed by the verse <b>“The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the droughts”</b> (Jeremiah 14:1).

### Part 9
<b>And he recites</b> at the end of all of these six blessing <b>their</b> unique <b>conclusions. For</b> the conclusion of <b>the first</b> blessing: Redeemer of Israel, <b>he recites: He Who answered Abraham on Mount Moriah</b> (see Genesis 22:11–18), <b>He will answer you and hear the sound of your cry on this day. Blessed are You, Lord, Redeemer of Israel. For the second</b> blessing, to which he adds the verses of Remembrances, <b>he recites: He Who answered our forefathers at the Red Sea</b> (see Exodus 14:15–31), <b>He will answer you and hear the sound of your cry on this day. Blessed are You, Lord, Who remembers the forgotten.</b>

### Part 10
<b>For the third</b> blessing, which includes the verses of <i>Shofarot</i>, <b>he recites: He Who answered Joshua at Gilgal,</b> when they sounded the <i>shofar</i> in Jericho (see Joshua 5:6), <b>He will answer you and hear the sound of your cry on this day. Blessed are You, Lord, Who hears the <i>terua</i>. For the fourth</b> blessing, <b>he recites: He Who answered Samuel in Mizpah</b> (see I Samuel, chapter 7), <b>He will answer you and hear the sound of your cry on this day. Blessed are You, Lord, Who hears cries. For the fifth he recites: He Who answered Elijah on Mount Carmel</b> (see I Kings, chapter 18), <b>He will answer you and hear the sound of your cry on this day. Blessed are You, Lord, Who hears prayer.</b>

### Part 11
<b>For the sixth</b> blessing <b>he recites: He Who answered Jonah from within the innards of the fish</b> (see Jonah 2:2–11), <b>He will answer you and hear the sound of your cry on this day. Blessed are You, Lord, Who answers in a time of trouble. For</b> the conclusion of <b>the seventh</b> blessing, which is actually the sixth additional blessing, as the first blessing listed here is an expanded version of a regular weekday blessing, <b>he recites: He Who answered David and Solomon his son in Jerusalem</b> (see I Kings 8:12–53), <b>He will answer you and hear the sound of your cry on this day. Blessed are You, Lord, Who has mercy on the Land.</b>
