<b>to he who is despised of men, to he who is abhorred of nations, to a servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise”</b> (Isaiah 49:7); <b>and ministers by bowing, as it is written,</b> in the same verse: <b>“Ministers, and they shall bow.” Rabbi Zeira strongly objects to this</b> interpretation, <b>and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani</b> who objected. <b>Had</b> the verse <b>written: And ministers shall bow,</b> the meaning would have been <b>as you said.</b> However, <b>now that it is written: “Ministers, and they shall bow,”</b> this indicates that ministers will <b>do this and that,</b> i.e., they will both arise and bow.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: I too say</b> a similar idea. <b>Not all</b> are fit <b>for light, and not all</b> are fit <b>for gladness. The righteous</b> are fit to be rewarded <b>with light, and the upright</b> are fit to be rewarded <b>with gladness. The righteous</b> are fit to be rewarded <b>with light,</b> as it is written: <b>“Light is sown for the righteous”</b> (Psalms 97:11), <b>and the upright</b> are fit to be rewarded <b>with gladness, as it is written,</b> in the same verse: <b>“And gladness for the upright in heart.”</b>
