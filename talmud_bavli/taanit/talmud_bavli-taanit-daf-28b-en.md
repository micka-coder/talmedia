### Part 1
<b>What is different</b> about <b><i>hallel</i> that it overrides its own</b> watch, i.e., the watch in the morning service, when <i>hallel</i> is recited; <b>and what is different</b> about <b>the additional offering, that it does not override its own</b> watch, of the morning service, but it does override the watch of the afternoon service and the closing prayer?

### Part 2
<b>Rav Ashi said to him: Now,</b> as the additional offering <b>overrides</b> the watch of the afternoon service, <b>which is not its own,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> that it should take precedence over <b>its own</b> watch? Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: I meant the opposite, as this <b>is what I am saying to you:</b> It should not take precedence over another watch, that of the closing prayer; rather, <b>let it override only its own</b> watch, the one performed in the additional service.

### Part 3
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: There is Rabbi Yosei, who holds in accordance with your</b> opinion, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> On <b>any day on which there is an additional offering, there is a non-priestly watch.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>To which non-priestly watch</b> is he referring? <b>If we say</b> that Rabbi Yosei means <b>the non-priestly watch of the morning prayer, but the first <i>tanna</i> also said this. Rather,</b> Rabbi Yosei must mean the <b>non-priestly watch of the additional prayer.</b> However, this too is problematic; is it possible that the additional offering does <b>not override</b> even <b>its own</b> watch, during the additional service itself?

### Part 4
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yosei must be referring to the watch <b>of the afternoon prayer.</b> However, this is also puzzling, for if <b>the wood offering overrides</b> the watch of the afternoon service, the additional offering should certainly take precedence over it. <b>Rather, is it not</b> the case that Rabbi Yosei is speaking of the watch <b>in the closing prayer?</b> One can <b>learn from this</b> that the additional offering <b>overrides its own</b> watch, but it does <b>not override</b> a watch <b>that is not its own.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this</b> that this is the case.

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> the mishna <b>also teach: On the first of Nisan there was no non-priestly watch because</b> it is a day <b>on which <i>hallel</i> is</b> recited, <b>and</b> it is the New Moon, on which <b>an additional offering</b> is sacrificed, <b>and</b> there was also <b>a wood offering.</b> Rava said: <b>That is to say</b> that <b>the <i>hallel</i></b> recited <b>on a New Moon</b> is <b>not</b> required <b>by Torah law</b> but is a custom.

### Part 6
<b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak:</b> On <b>eighteen days a year, the individual completes</b> the full <b><i>hallel</i>. And they are: The eight days of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, including the Eighth Day of Assembly; <b>the eight days of Hanukkah; the first Festival</b> day <b>of Passover; and the Festival</b> day <b>of Assembly,</b> i.e., <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>And in the Diaspora,</b> where a second day is added to each Festival due to uncertainty over the correct date, there <b>are twenty-one days, and they are: The nine days of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, including the last day, known as the Celebration of the Torah, <b>the eight days of Hanukkah, the first two days of Passover, and the two Festival</b> days <b>of Assembly.</b>

### Part 7
On this topic, the Gemara relates: <b>Rav happened</b> to come to <b>Babylonia,</b> where <b>he saw that they were reciting <i>hallel</i> on a New Moon.</b> Unfamiliar with this practice, <b>he thought to stop them,</b> as he assumed that they were reciting <i>hallel</i> unnecessarily. <b>Once he saw that they were omitting</b> portions, <b>he said:</b> I can <b>learn from this</b> that <b>they are maintaining the custom of their forefathers,</b> i.e., they know that it is a custom, not an obligation. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An individual should not begin</b> reciting <i>hallel</i> on a New Moon, <b>but if he has begun he should complete</b> it.

### Part 8
§ The mishna taught: <b>Five</b> calamitous <b>matters occurred to our forefathers on the seventeenth of Tammuz,</b> one of which was that <b>the tablets were broken.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that the tablets were broken on this day? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>On the sixth of the month</b> of Sivan <b>the Ten Commandments were given to the Jewish people. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It was <b>on the seventh of that</b> month. The Gemara comments: According to <b>the one who said</b> that <b>they were given on the sixth</b> of Sivan, <b>they were given on the sixth, and on the seventh Moses ascended</b> to Mount Sinai.

### Part 9
According to <b>the one who said</b> that the Ten Commandments <b>were given on the seventh</b> of Sivan, <b>they were given on the seventh, and on the seventh Moses ascended</b> to Mount Sinai, <b>as it is written: “And He called to Moses on the seventh day</b> out of the midst of the cloud” (Exodus 24:16), <b>and it is written: “And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and he went up into the mount, and Moses was on the mount forty days and forty nights”</b> (Exodus 24:18). The calculation is as follows: There were <b>twenty-four</b> days remaining <b>in Sivan, plus</b> the first <b>sixteen days of Tammuz,</b> which <b>comes to forty</b> days.

### Part 10
<b>On the seventeenth of Tammuz,</b> Moses <b>descended, came,</b> observed the people worshipping the Golden Calf, <b>and broke the tablets. And it is written: “And it came to pass, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing, and Moses’ anger burned, and he cast the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount”</b> (Exodus 32:19). This shows that the tablets were shattered on the seventeenth of Tammuz.

### Part 11
§ The mishna taught that on the seventeenth of Tammuz <b>the daily offering was nullified.</b> The Gemara explains: It is <b>a tradition</b> that this occurred on that date.

### Part 12
The mishna further taught that on the seventeenth of Tammuz <b>the city</b> walls of Jerusalem <b>were breached.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Was</b> this tragedy something that occurred <b>on the seventeenth</b> of Tammuz? <b>But isn’t it written: “In the fourth month, on ninth of the month, the famine was severe in the city”</b> (Jeremiah 52:6), <b>and it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “Then a breach was made in the city”</b> (Jeremiah 52:7), which clearly indicates that the city was breached on the ninth.

### Part 13
<b>Rava said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>here</b> the verse is referring <b>to the First</b> Temple, whereas <b>there,</b> in the mishna, it describes the destruction <b>of the Second</b> Temple, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Upon the destruction <b>of the First</b> Temple, <b>the city</b> walls <b>were breached on the ninth of Tammuz;</b> and at the destruction <b>of the Second</b> Temple they were breached <b>on the seventeenth of</b> Tammuz.

### Part 14
The mishna further taught that on the seventeenth of Tammuz <b>Apostemos</b> publicly <b>burned a Torah scroll.</b> The Gemara explains: This, too, is <b>a tradition.</b>

### Part 15
The mishna also stated that on the seventeenth of Tammuz Manasseh <b>placed an idol in the Sanctuary.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that this occurred on the seventeenth of Tammuz? <b>As it is written: “And from the time that the daily offering shall be taken away and the abomination that causes appallment is set up”</b> (Daniel 12:11), which indicates that an idol was placed in the Temple on the very day that the daily offering was suspended.

### Part 16
The Gemara asks: <b>And was there</b> only <b>one</b> idol placed there? <b>But isn’t it written: “And upon the wing of detestable things shall be that which causes appallment”</b> (Daniel 9:27)? The plural, “detestable things,” indicates the presence of at least two idols. <b>Rava said: There were</b> initially <b>two</b> idols, <b>but one fell upon the other and broke its hand.</b> Since only one idol was whole, the mishna mentions only that one. Rava continues: <b>And</b> an inscription was found on the broken idol <b>that read:</b>
