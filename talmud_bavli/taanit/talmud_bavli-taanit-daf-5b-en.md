### Part 1
<b>equivalent to two. And what is this</b> sin? <b>Idol worship, as it is written: “For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, to hew for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns”</b> (Jeremiah 2:13), <b>and it is written about</b> the Jewish people: <b>“For pass over the isles of the Kittim and see; and send to Kedar and observe carefully, and</b> see if there has been such a thing. <b>Has a nation exchanged its gods, although they are no gods? But My people has exchanged its glory for that which does not profit”</b> (Jeremiah 2:10–11).

### Part 2
It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to this verse: <b>Kittites,</b> i.e., the people of the isles of Kittim, <b>worship fire</b> and <b>the people of Kedar worship water, and even though they know that water extinguishes fire,</b> nevertheless <b>they have not exchanged their god: “But My people has exchanged its glory for that which does not profit.”</b>

### Part 3
<b>And Rav Naḥman said to Rabbi Yitzḥak: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And it came to pass when Samuel was old”</b> (I Samuel 8:1)? <b>And did Samuel really grow so old? But he was</b> only <b>fifty-two years old</b> when he died, <b>as the Master said</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>that deals with</b> the Divine punishment of <i>karet</i>: <b>One who dies at</b> the age of <b>fifty-two years</b> is not considered to have suffered the premature death of <i>karet</i>, as <b>this is the</b> age of the <b>death of Samuel of Rama.</b> This shows that Samuel died at the relatively young age of fifty-two.

### Part 4
Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: Old age sprang upon</b> Samuel, which caused him to appear older than his actual age, <b>as it is written: “I regret that I made Saul king”</b> (I Samuel 15:11). Samuel <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, You have</b> considered <b>me the equivalent of Moses and Aaron, as it is written: “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who call upon His Name”</b> (Psalms 99:6). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>Moses and Aaron, their handiwork was not annulled in their lifetimes, so too, let my handiwork not be annulled in my lifetime.</b> I anointed Saul; please do not annul his reign.

### Part 5
<b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: What shall I do? Shall Saul die</b> now? <b>Samuel will not allow it,</b> as he has petitioned that Saul should not die. <b>Shall Samuel die young,</b> with Saul passing away immediately afterward? The people <b>will murmur about him,</b> and wonder what transgression Samuel committed that caused his early demise. <b>Shall neither Saul nor Samuel die?</b> The time of <b>David’s reign has already arrived, and one kingdom does not overlap with another</b> and subtract from the time allotted to it <b>even</b> by <b>a hairbreadth [<i>nima</i>].</b>

### Part 6
Therefore, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: I will spring old age upon him</b> and everyone will think that Shmuel is elderly. <b>This is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And Saul dwelled in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree in Rama”</b> (I Samuel 22:6). <b>What does Gibeah have to do with Rama;</b> these are two separate places. <b>Rather,</b> the verse comes <b>to tell you: Who caused Saul to dwell in Gibeah for two and a half years? The prayer of Samuel of Rama.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> one <b>man set aside before</b> another <b>man?</b> In other words, is Samuel’s life set aside simply because the time for David’s reign has arrived? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Therefore I have hewn by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of My mouth”</b> (Hosea 6:5)? It <b>is not stated: By their deeds, but</b> rather: <b>“By the words of My mouth,”</b> i.e., God sometimes ends the life of an individual simply by virtue of His decree. <b>Apparently,</b> one <b>man is</b> indeed <b>set aside before</b> another <b>man.</b>

### Part 8
§ In continuation of Rav Naḥman’s questions of Rabbi Yitzḥak, the Gemara relates: <b>Rav Naḥman and Rabbi Yitzḥak were sitting</b> and eating together <b>at a meal. Rav Naḥman said to Rabbi Yitzḥak: Let</b> the <b>Master say a matter,</b> i.e., share a Torah idea with me. Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One may not speak during a meal, lest the trachea will precede the esophagus.</b> Food is meant to enter the esophagus, and when one speaks his trachea opens and the food might enter there. <b>And</b> therefore, one should not speak during a meal, as he might <b>come into</b> the <b>danger</b> of choking.

### Part 9
<b>After they had eaten,</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: Our patriarch Jacob did not die.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>asked him</b> in surprise: <b>And was it for naught that the eulogizers eulogized</b> him <b>and the embalmers embalmed</b> him <b>and the buriers buried</b> him? Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>replied to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>I am interpreting a verse, as it is stated: “Therefore do not fear, Jacob My servant, says the Lord, neither be dismayed, Israel, for I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity”</b> (Jeremiah 30:10). This verse <b>juxtaposes Jacob to his seed: Just as his seed is alive</b> when redeemed, <b>so too,</b> Jacob himself <b>is alive.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who says: Rahab Rahab, immediately experiences a seminal emission,</b> due to the arousal of desire caused by Rahab’s great beauty. <b>Rav Naḥman said to him: I say</b> Rahab <b>and it does not affect me.</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>When I said</b> this I was specifically referring <b>to</b> a man <b>who knew her and to</b> one <b>who recognized her.</b> With regard to anyone who had met Rahab in person, the mere mention of her name would arouse his lust.

### Part 11
The Gemara relates: <b>When they were taking leave of one another,</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak: <b>Master, give me a blessing.</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to him: I will tell you a parable. To what is this matter comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to one who was walking through a desert and who was hungry, tired, and thirsty. And he found a tree whose fruits were sweet and whose shade was pleasant, and a stream of water flowed beneath it.</b> He <b>ate from the fruits of</b> the tree, <b>drank from the water in</b> the stream, <b>and sat in the shade of</b> the tree.

### Part 12
<b>And when he wished to leave, he said: Tree, tree, with what shall I bless you? If I say to you that your fruits should be sweet, your fruits are</b> already <b>sweet;</b> if I say <b>that your shade should be pleasant, your shade is</b> already <b>pleasant;</b> if I say <b>that a stream of water should flow beneath you, a stream of water</b> already <b>flows beneath you. Rather,</b> I will bless you as follows: <b>May it be</b> God’s <b>will that all saplings which they plant from you</b>
