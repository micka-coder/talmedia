<b>to her, and He opened her womb”</b> (Genesis 30:22). <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>the key of the resurrection of the dead</b> is maintained by God Himself? <b>As it is written: “And you shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your graves”</b> (Ezekiel 37:13).

### Part 2
<b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say: The key of livelihood</b> is <b>also</b> in God’s hand, <b>as it is written: “You open Your hand</b> and satisfy every living thing with favor” (Psalms 145:16). The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan did not consider this</b> key of livelihood in his list? The Gemara answers that Rabbi Yoḥanan could have <b>said to you: Rain is</b> the same as <b>livelihood</b> in this regard, as rain is indispensable to all livelihoods.

### Part 3
§ The mishna taught that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One mentions rain <b>from the first Festival day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>etc. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>From where did Rabbi Eliezer derive this</b> <i>halakha</i>? He must have learned it from one of the two mitzvot of <i>Sukkot</i> that are linked to rain. Did he <b>derive it from</b> the mitzva to wave the <b><i>lulav</i>, or</b> did he <b>derive it from</b> the obligation of <b>the water libation?</b>

### Part 4
The Gemara clarifies the significance of this dilemma: Did he <b>derive this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the <b><i>lulav</i>,</b> in which case one would say: <b>Just as</b> the mitzva to take the <b><i>lulav</i></b> applies <b>during the day</b> and not at night, <b>so too,</b> the <b>mention</b> of rain begins <b>during the day</b> of the first Festival day of <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>Or perhaps</b> he <b>derives this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from the water libation,</b> in which case one would say: <b>Just as the water libation</b> can be prepared <b>from the</b> first <b>night</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>as the Master said,</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And their meal-offerings and their libations”</b> (Numbers 29:18), and certain meal-offerings and libations may be brought <b>even at night, so too,</b> the <b>mention</b> of rain begins <b>from the evening.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara seeks to resolve this dilemma: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer derived this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from nothing other</b> than the case of <b><i>lulav</i>. Some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu learned this</b> claim <b>by</b> way of a <b>tradition,</b> which was the source of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion; <b>and some say</b> that <b>he learned it from a <i>baraita</i>.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>baraita</i> from which Rabbi Abbahu may have derived his statement? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From when does one</b> begin to <b>mention the rains</b> in his prayers? <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: From the time that one takes</b> the <b><i>lulav</i>,</b> i.e., the first day of <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: From the time that one puts</b> the <i>lulav</i> <b>down,</b> i.e., at the conclusion of <i>Sukkot</i>.

### Part 7
§ The <i>baraita</i> cites a discussion of these opinions. <b>Rabbi Eliezer said:</b> It is <b>since these four species,</b> the <i>lulav</i> and the other species taken with it, <b>come only to offer appeasement for water,</b> as they symbolize the rainfall of the coming year. <b>And</b> this symbolism is as follows: <b>Just as these four species cannot</b> exist <b>without water,</b> as they need water to grow, <b>so too, the world cannot</b> exist <b>without water.</b> Therefore, it is proper to mention rain in one’s prayers when taking the four species.

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him</b> in response: <b>But rain during the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>is nothing other</b> than <b>a sign of a curse. Rabbi Eliezer said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>I too did not say</b> that it is proper <b>to ask</b> for rain at this time, <b>but</b> only <b>to mention</b> it. And <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>the resurrection of the dead, one mentions</b> it <b>the entire year and</b> yet <b>it</b> will <b>come only at its</b> proper <b>time,</b> when God wills the resurrection, <b>so too, one mentions the might of the rains all the year, and they</b> fall <b>only in their season. Therefore, if one seeks to mention</b> rain <b>throughout the year, he</b> may <b>mention it. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that <b>when one ceases to request</b> rain, <b>one also ceases to mention</b> it.

### Part 9
<b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: On the second day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>one mentions</b> rain, rather than on the first day. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: On the sixth day one mentions</b> rain. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua:</b> With regard to <b>the one who passes before the ark</b> as prayer leader <b>on the concluding Festival day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, the Eighth Day of Assembly, <b>the last</b> prayer leader of the additional prayer <b>mentions</b> rain, whereas <b>the first</b> prayer leader for the morning prayer <b>does not</b> mention rain. Conversely, <b>on the first Festival day of Passover, the first</b> prayer leader <b>mentions</b> rain, while <b>the last</b> prayer leader <b>does not mention</b> rain.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>Rabbi Eliezer is speaking well to Rabbi Yehoshua.</b> How does Rabbi Yehoshua respond to Rabbi Eliezer’s powerful argument that one can mention God’s praises at any time of the year? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua</b> could have <b>said to you: Granted,</b> with regard to <b>the resurrection of the dead, one mentions</b> this daily, <b>as</b> although it is not fulfilled every day, <b>any day is</b> fit to be <b>its proper time.</b>

### Part 11
<b>However,</b> in the case of <b>rain,</b> are <b>all</b> times <b>when it falls its proper time? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (12b): <b>If</b> the month of <b>Nisan has ended and rains</b> subsequently <b>fall, they are a sign of a curse, as it is stated: “Is not the wheat harvest today?</b> I will call to the Lord that He may send thunder and rain, and you will know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the Lord, in asking you a king” (I Samuel 12:17).

### Part 12
§ The <i>baraita</i> states that <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: On the second day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>one</b> begins to <b>mention</b> rain. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> this ruling of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught,</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that deals with the source for the water libation on <i>Sukkot</i>, that <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> The Torah alludes to the water libation in its description of the libations of the additional offerings of <i>Sukkot</i>. The Torah uses a slightly different term for the libations of certain days. On most days, it states that the sin-offering must be brought with “its libation [<i>veniskah</i>]” (e.g., Numbers 29:16), in the singular form.

### Part 13
By contrast, <b>it is stated on the second day</b> that one must offer <b>“their libations [<i>veniskeihem</i>]”</b> (Numbers 29:19). The plural form indicates the presence of multiple offerings. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>it is stated</b> concerning the sin-offering libations <b>on the sixth day: “And its libations [<i>unsakheha</i>]”</b> (Numbers 29:31), which is again a plural form that is referring to many libations. <b>And</b> finally, <b>it is stated,</b> with regard to the libations of the additional offering <b>on the seventh day,</b> that they must apportion the respective animals, i.e., oxen, rams, and sheep: <b>“According to their laws [<i>kemishpatam</i>]”</b> (Numbers 29:33), using another plural form which differs from the phrase used on the other Festival days: “According to the law [<i>kamishpat</i>]” (e.g., Numbers 29:19), in the singular.

### Part 14
<b>These</b> variations yield the three superfluous letters <b><i>mem</i>, <i>yod</i>,</b> and <b><i>mem</i>,</b> from <i>veniskeiheM</i>, <i>unsakhEha</i>, and <i>kemishpataM</i>, <b>which</b> together spell the Hebrew word for <b>water [<i>MaYiM</i>].</b> The letter <i>yod</i> is represented in <i>unsakhEha</i> with the letter E and in <i>MaYiM</i> with the letter Y. <b>From here</b> one learns <b>an allusion to the</b> mitzva of <b>the water libation in the Torah.</b>

### Part 15
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different about the second</b> day <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira <b>took</b> it as the day on which one begins to mention rain? The Gemara answers: The reason is <b>that when the verse</b> first <b>alludes</b> to the water libation, <b>it is on the second</b> day of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>that it alludes</b> to it (Numbers 29:19). <b>Therefore, on the second</b> day one begins to <b>mention</b> rain.

### Part 16
The <i>baraita</i> stated that <b>Rabbi Akiva says: On the sixth day one</b> begins to <b>mention</b> rain. The Gemara explains that this ruling is based on the allusion to the water libation in the offering of this day. <b>As it is stated on the sixth day: “And its libations [<i>unsakheha</i>]”</b> (Numbers 29:31). The allusion is written in the plural, which indicates that <b>the verse is speaking of two libations: One</b> is <b>the water libation and</b> the other <b>one</b> is <b>the</b> standard <b>wine libation.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara raises an objection: Even if it is accepted that the verse is referring to two libations, one can <b>say</b> that <b>both</b> libations are <b>of wine.</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Akiva <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, who said</b> that the superfluous letters of these verses <b>allude</b> to <b>water [<i>mayim</i>].</b> This proves that the additional libation of the sixth day must be a water libation.
