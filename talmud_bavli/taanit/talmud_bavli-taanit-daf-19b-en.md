### Part 1
this is considered <b>a drought.</b> If produce must be brought <b>from</b> one <b>province to</b> another <b>province,</b> this is considered <b>a famine. And Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> If <b>a <i>se’a</i></b> of grain is sold <b>for a <i>sela</i>, but</b> it is <b>available,</b> this is considered <b>a drought.</b> Although prices have risen, there is still grain for those who can afford it. However, if <b>four <i>se’a</i></b> of grain is sold <b>for a <i>sela</i>, and</b> it is <b>not available,</b> this is considered <b>a famine.</b>

### Part 2
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> with regard to a time <b>when money is cheap</b> and everyone has it, <b>and produce is expensive. However,</b> when <b>money is expensive,</b> i.e., unavailable, <b>and produce is cheap, they cry out about it immediately,</b> as this is considered a famine. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I remember when four <i>se’a</i></b> of produce <b>were</b> sold <b>for</b> one <b><i>sela</i>, and</b> yet <b>there were many swollen by famine in Tiberias, as they did not have</b> even one <b><i>issar</i></b> with which to purchase food.

### Part 3
§ The mishna taught: If sufficient rain <b>fell for the vegetation but not</b> enough <b>fell for the trees;</b> if it was enough for the trees but not for the vegetation; or if sufficient rain fell for both this and that, i.e., vegetation and trees, but not enough to fill the cisterns, ditches, and caves with water to last the summer, they cry out about it immediately. The Gemara comments: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to rain that fell in sufficient quantities <b>for the vegetation but not for the trees,</b> this case <b>can be found,</b> e.g., <b>if gentle</b> rain <b>fell but heavy</b> rain <b>did not fall,</b> this is insufficient for the trees. Furthermore, it is possible for enough rain to fall <b>for the trees but</b> it is <b>not</b> effective <b>for the vegetation, if heavy</b> rain <b>fell but gentle</b> rain <b>did not fall.</b>

### Part 4
Likewise, in the case of rain that benefits <b>both this and that,</b> trees and vegetation, <b>but not cisterns, ditches, and caves, you</b> can <b>find</b> this too, <b>if</b> both <b>heavy and gentle</b> rain <b>fell, however,</b> they did <b>not fall in abundance,</b> and therefore the water in the cisterns will not last through the summer. <b>However, that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If sufficient rain <b>fell for cisterns, ditches, and caves, but not for</b> either <b>this or that,</b> i.e., trees or plants, <b>how can you find these</b> circumstances? If the rain is enough to fill cisterns, how could it not be enough for plants and trees? The Gemara answers: <b>Where rain comes in</b> a single <b>downpour,</b> it will fill the cisterns but will provide no benefit to plants and trees.

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught: They cry out about trees</b> that have not received enough rain, until <b>near Passover,</b> as beyond that time any rain will no longer benefit trees. However, they sound the alarm <b>over cisterns, ditches and caves</b> that have not been filled until <b>before the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>. <b>And</b> at any time, <b>if they have no water to drink, they sound the alarm over them immediately.</b>

### Part 6
<b>And what</b> exactly is the meaning of <b>their</b> use of: <b>Immediately,</b> in these cases? <b>Monday, Thursday, and Monday</b> of the week in which the court became aware of the crisis, but not necessarily on the very day that it became evident. <b>And in all of these</b> cases of interrupted rainfall, <b>they sound the alarm over them only in their district [<i>iparkheya</i>],</b> but not in other areas where rain is falling normally.

### Part 7
<b>And</b> with regard to a plague of <b>diphtheria, when it has</b> the potential to cause <b>death they sound the alarm over it,</b> but <b>when it does not have</b> the potential to cause <b>death they do not sound the alarm over it. And they sound the alarm over</b> the arrival of <b>locusts, for any amount,</b> as it is likely that more locusts are on the way. However, they do not sound the alarm over the arrival of grasshoppers. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> They sound the alarm <b>even over grasshoppers,</b> as they too can cause a great deal of damage if they swarm in large numbers.

### Part 8
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>They sound the alarm over trees during the other</b> six <b>years of the</b> seven-year Sabbatical <b>cycle,</b> when the earth is tilled, but not during the Sabbatical Year, when one must refrain from working the land. However, <b>for cisterns, ditches, and caves, they sound the alarm even in the Sabbatical Year. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Even for trees</b> they sound the alarm <b>in the Sabbatical Year, because they serve as sustenance for the poor.</b> Since the poor rely on these trees for their food in the Sabbatical Year, they will lose their means of subsistence if it does not rain.

### Part 9
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>They sound the alarm over trees during the other years of the</b> Sabbatical <b>cycle,</b> and <b>for cisterns, ditches and caves they sound the alarm even in the Sabbatical Year. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Even for trees.</b> Furthermore, <b>they sound the alarm for aftergrowths</b> of crops that have grown of their own accord <b>in the Sabbatical Year, because they serve as sustenance for the poor,</b> as it is permitted to eat aftergrowths.

### Part 10
§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Perata said: Since the day that the Temple was destroyed, rain has been meager,</b> i.e., overall, not enough has fallen <b>in the world. There are years whose rains are abundant, and there are years whose rains are scare. There are years whose rains fall in their proper time,</b> and <b>there are years whose rains do not fall in their proper time.</b>

### Part 11
With regard to <b>a year whose rains fall in their proper time, to what</b> may <b>it be compared? To a servant whose master gave him his</b> weekly <b>portion on Sunday.</b> It is thereby <b>found</b> that his <b>dough is baked properly</b> throughout the week, <b>and it is eaten properly,</b> as he has a sufficient amount. Conversely, with regard to <b>a year whose rains do not fall in their proper time, to what</b> may <b>it be compared? To a servant whose master gave him his portion on Shabbat eve,</b> when there is insufficient time to prepare it fully. It is thereby <b>found</b> that his <b>dough is baked improperly, and it is eaten improperly.</b>

### Part 12
With regard to <b>a year whose rains are abundant, to what</b> may <b>it be compared? To a servant whose master gave him his portion</b> for a long period of time all <b>at once.</b> He performs all of his milling at one time, and it is therefore <b>found</b> that <b>the mill grinds</b> and produces waste <b>from a <i>kor</i></b> of produce in the same amount <b>as it grinds</b> and produces waste <b>from</b> the much smaller <b><i>kav</i></b> of produce. During each milling process, the same amount of flour goes to waste. Consequently, milling a large amount of flour in a single milling process preserves flour. <b>And</b> similarly, it is <b>found</b> that <b>dough is diminished from a <i>kor</i>, as it diminishes from a <i>kav</i>.</b>

### Part 13
In contrast, with regard to <b>a year whose rains are scarce, to what</b> may <b>it be compared? To a servant whose master gave him his portion little by little.</b> It is thereby <b>found that</b> the amount <b>that the mill</b> would have <b>ground from a <i>kor</i></b> of produce is that which in practice <b>it grinds</b> and produces <b>from</b> each <b><i>kav</i>.</b> It is likewise <b>found</b> that the <b>dough</b> that would have been <b>diminished from a <i>kor</i></b> is the same amount that is <b>diminished from a <i>kav</i>.</b> In sum, one retains less dough when given his sustenance little by little.

### Part 14
<b>Alternatively, when its rains are abundant, to what</b> may this year <b>be compared? To a person who kneads clay. If he has a lot of water,</b> his <b>water is not used up</b> and <b>the clay</b> will be <b>well kneaded. If he has</b> only <b>a little water,</b> the <b>water</b> will be <b>used up and the clay will not be well kneaded.</b>

### Part 15
§ <b>The Sages taught: Once all the Jewish people ascended for</b> the <b>pilgrimage Festival to Jerusalem and there was not</b> enough <b>water for them to drink. Nakdimon ben Guryon,</b> one of the wealthy citizens of Jerusalem, went to <b>a certain</b> gentile <b>officer [<i>hegemon</i>]</b> and <b>said to him: Lend me twelve wells of water for the pilgrims, and I will give back to you twelve wells of water. And if I do not give</b> them <b>to you, I will give you twelve talents of silver. And</b> the officer <b>set him a time</b> limit for returning the water.

### Part 16
<b>When the</b> set <b>time arrived and no rain had fallen, in the morning</b> the official <b>sent</b> a message <b>to</b> Nakdimon: <b>Send me either</b> the <b>water or</b> the <b>coins that you owe me.</b> Nakdimon <b>sent</b> a message <b>to him: I still have time,</b> as <b>the entire day is mine. At noontime</b> the official again <b>sent</b> a message <b>to him: Send me either</b> the <b>water or</b> the <b>coins that you owe me.</b> Nakdimon <b>sent</b> a message <b>to him: I still have</b> time <b>left in the day.</b> In the afternoon he <b>sent</b> a message <b>to him: Send me either</b> the <b>water or</b> the <b>coins that you owe me.</b> Nakdimon <b>sent</b> a message <b>to him: I still have</b> time <b>left in the day. That officer ridiculed him, saying:</b> Throughout <b>the entire year rain has not fallen,</b>
