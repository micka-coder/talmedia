### Part 1
<b>“But he sent ambassadors to him saying: What have I to do with you, king of Judea? I do not come against you this day, but against the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to make haste. Forbear from meddling with God, Who is with me, so that He will not destroy you”</b> (II Chronicles 35:21). This clearly shows that Pharaoh Neco had no intention of engaging Josiah in battle.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase <b>“God, Who is with me”? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: This</b> is referring to Neco’s <b>idolatry,</b> which he brought for assistance. In other words, it is a secular reference and should be read as: The god that is with me, in my possession. Josiah <b>said: Since</b> he trusts in idolatry, <b>I will be able</b> to defeat <b>him.</b>

### Part 3
With regard to Josiah’s battle with Pharaoh Neco, the verse states: <b>“And the archers shot at King Josiah and the king said to his servants: Move me away, for I am seriously wounded”</b> (II Chronicles 35:23). <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“For I am seriously wounded”? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> the Egyptian archers <b>made his entire body like a sieve</b> from the many arrows they shot at him.

### Part 4
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: For what</b> reason <b>was Josiah punished? Because he should have consulted with</b> the prophet <b>Jeremiah</b> to find out if he should go to war, <b>but he did not consult</b> with him. <b>How did</b> Josiah <b>interpret</b> the verses of the Torah? How did they lead him to go to war? The verse states: <b>“Neither shall a sword go through your land”</b> (Leviticus 26:6).

### Part 5
<b>What is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>“Sword”? If we say</b> that it is referring to <b>a sword that is not of peace, but isn’t it written</b> earlier in the same verse: <b>“And I will give peace in the land”? Rather,</b> the verse must mean that <b>even</b> a sword <b>of peace</b> shall not pass through the land, and Josiah sought to prevent this occurrence, in fulfillment of the blessing. <b>But he did not know that his generation did not merit</b> these blessings, and he would therefore not receive divine assistance in this regard.

### Part 6
The Gemara discusses Josiah’s deathbed reflections. <b>When</b> Josiah <b>was dying, Jeremiah saw his lips moving.</b> Jeremiah <b>said: Perhaps, Heaven forbid, he is saying something improper</b> and complaining about God’s judgment <b>on account of his</b> great <b>distress.</b> Jeremiah <b>bent over and heard that he was justifying</b> God’s <b>judgment against himself.</b> Josiah <b>said: “The Lord is righteous, for I have rebelled against His word”</b> (Lamentations 1:18). <b>At that moment,</b> Jeremiah <b>began</b> his eulogy <b>for</b> Josiah: <b>“The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord,</b> was trapped in their pits” (Lamentations 4:20).

### Part 7
§ The mishna taught: <b>An incident</b> occurred in <b>which Elders descended from Jerusalem to their cities</b> and decreed a fast throughout the land because a small amount of blight was seen in the city of Ashkelon, enough to fill the mouth of an oven. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Did they mean enough <b>grain to fill</b> an entire <b>oven, or perhaps</b> they meant enough grain to prepare <b>bread to fill an oven?</b> This is far less, as bread is stuck to the walls of the oven and does not fill its inner area.

### Part 8
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the phrase of the mishna: Enough <b>to fill the mouth of an oven.</b> This indicates that the bread referred to does not fill the entire oven, but rather covers the mouth of the oven. The Gemara further asks: <b>And still you can raise this dilemma before them:</b> Is the mishna referring to the bread <b>of the cover of the oven? Perhaps</b> it is referring <b>to a row of bread around the mouth of the oven.</b> No resolution was found, and the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

### Part 9
§ The mishna taught: <b>And furthermore, they decreed a fast because wolves had eaten two children</b> in Transjordan. <b>Ulla said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: An incident</b> occurred in <b>which wolves swallowed two children and excreted them. And the incident came before the Sages</b> for a ruling. They were asked if the remains were ritually impure even after they had passed through the animal’s digestive tract, <b>and they pronounced the flesh ritually pure,</b> as it had been digested, but they <b>pronounced</b> the intact <b>bones ritually impure.</b>

### Part 10
§ The mishna further taught: <b>For the following</b> calamities <b>they sound the alarm</b> even <b>on Shabbat:</b> For a city that is surrounded by gentile troops, for a place in danger of being flooded by a river that has swelled its banks, or for a ship tossed about at sea. <b>The Sages taught:</b> In the case of <b>a city that is surrounded by gentile</b> troops <b>or a river</b> that has swelled beyond its banks, and this also applies to <b>both a ship tossed about at sea and an individual who is being pursued by gentiles, or by thieves, or by an evil spirit,</b> which may lead him to harm himself, <b>they sound the alarm</b> even <b>on Shabbat. And in all these</b> cases, <b>an individual is permitted to afflict himself by fasting</b> to annul the evil decrees against him.

### Part 11
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: An individual is not permitted to afflict himself by fasting, lest</b> he become too weak to work and <b>be beholden to other beings, and</b> those <b>beings will not have mercy on him. Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: What is the reason of Rabbi Yosei?</b> It is <b>as it is written: “And man became a living soul”</b> (Genesis 2:7). Rabbi Yosei interprets this verse as a command: <b>The soul I placed within you,</b> preserve and <b>sustain it.</b>

### Part 12
§ The mishna taught that <b>Shimon the Timnite says:</b> One may cry out on Shabbat <b>even for pestilence,</b> but the Rabbis did not agree with him. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does this mean that <b>the Rabbis did not agree with him</b> with regard to crying out in these cases <b>on Shabbat,</b> but if they occur <b>on a weekday they agreed with him? Or perhaps they did not agree with him at all,</b> as they maintain that one never cries out over pestilence.

### Part 13
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One cries out for</b> a plague of <b>pestilence on Shabbat, and needless to say on weekdays. Rabbi Ḥanan ben Pitom, the student of Rabbi Akiva, says in the name of Rabbi Akiva: One does not cry out for pestilence at all.</b> This opinion attributed to Rabbi Akiva is the ruling of the Rabbis in the mishna.

### Part 14
§ The mishna further states that they sound the alarm <b>on</b> account of any <b>trouble that should not befall the community,</b> a euphemism for trouble that may befall the community, except for an overabundance of rain. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For any trouble that should not befall the community, they sound the alarm for it, except for an overabundance of rain.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Because one does not pray over an excess of good.</b> Since rain is generally good for the world, it is not appropriate to pray for it to stop, even when it falls in excess.

### Part 15
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one does not pray over an excess of good?</b> It <b>is stated: “Bring the whole tithe into the storeroom,</b> that there may be food in My house, and test Me now by this, said the Lord of hosts, if I will not open for you the windows of heaven, and pour out for you a blessing that there shall be more than sufficiency” (Malachi 3:10). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“That there shall be more than sufficiency [<i>ad beli dai</i>]”? Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> It means that the abundance will be so great <b>that your lips will be worn out [<i>yivlu</i>],</b> similar to the word <i>beli</i>, <b>from saying enough [<i>dai</i>].</b> In other words, even when a blessing is delivered in gross excess, one should not pray for it to cease, as the verse blesses the people with an excess.

### Part 16
<b>Rami bar Rav Yud said:</b> This is true in Eretz Yisrael, but in the Diaspora, i.e., Babylonia, <b>they do sound the alarm over</b> excessive rain. The reason is that Babylonia is in a low-lying region, where excessive rain poses a real danger. <b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In <b>a year whose rains are abundant, the members of the priestly watch</b> in the Temple <b>would send</b> a message <b>to the members of the non-priestly watch: Cast your eyes on your brothers in the Diaspora</b> and have them in mind when you pray, so <b>that their houses</b> should not collapse from excessive rain and <b>become their graves.</b>

### Part 17
<b>They asked Rabbi Eliezer: How much rain must fall</b> until <b>they</b> should <b>pray that it should not fall</b> anymore? <b>He said to them</b> by way of exaggeration: Enough rain must fall <b>so that a person stands at</b> the colossal cliff <b>Keren Ophel and dips his feet in water.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Eliezer said he must be able to place <b>his hands</b> in water? Rabbi Eliezer could answer: When <b>I said to you</b> that he must be able to place <b>his feet,</b> I meant <b>like his hands,</b> i.e., the water must be high enough that he can dip both his hands and feet into the water with ease.

### Part 18
With regard to the height of this great cliff, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: I</b> personally <b>saw Keren Ophel,</b> and when I peered down I saw <b>that an Arab was positioned below,</b> and <b>while riding a camel and</b> holding <b>a spear in his hand, he looked like a worm [<i>iniva</i>].</b>

### Part 19
<b>The Sages taught: “Then I will give your rains in their season”</b> (Leviticus 26:4). This means that the earth will be <b>neither drunk nor thirsty; rather, a moderate</b> amount of rain will fall. <b>For as long as the rains are abundant, they muddy</b> the soil of <b>the land, and it does not give out</b> its <b>produce. Alternatively,</b>
