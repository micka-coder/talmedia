### Part 1
Rabbi Yehoshua replied: <b>Had they been ugly, they would have been even more learned. Alternatively,</b> the Torah is likened to water, wine, and milk because <b>just as these three liquids are spoiled only by diversion of attention, so too, are Torah matters forgotten only through diversion of attention.</b> If water, wine and milk are guarded, they will not spoil or have dirty objects fall into them.

### Part 2
§ The Gemara returns to the issue of rain. <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: The day of the rains is</b> as <b>great as the day on which the heavens and earth were created, as it is stated: “Drop down, heavens, from above, let the skies pour down righteousness; let the earth open that they may bring forth salvation, and let it cause righteousness to spring up together; I, the Lord, have created it”</b> (Isaiah 45:8). The Gemara explains that the verse <b>does not say: I have created them,</b> in the plural, <b>but: I have created it.</b> In other words, the verse is referring to rain, rather than to the heavens and the earth, which indicates that rainfall is as important as the creation of the world.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Oshaya</b> likewise <b>said: The day of rain is great, as</b> rain <b>even</b> facilitates <b>salvation,</b> which <b>is fruitful and multiplies on</b> that day. It is a time of God’s favor, when salvation is brought forth into the world, <b>as it is stated: “Let the earth open that they may bring forth salvation”</b> (Isaiah 45:8). <b>Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai said: Rain falls only if the Jewish people’s transgressions have been forgiven, as it is stated: “Lord, You have been favorable to Your land; You have turned the captivity of Jacob; You have forgiven the iniquity of Your people; You have pardoned all their sin. Selah”</b> (Psalms 85:2–3). This chapter proceeds to discuss rainfall: “And righteousness has looked down from Heaven” (Psalms 85:12), in the form of rain.

### Part 4
The Sage <b>Ze’iri from</b> the town of <b>Dihavat said to Ravina: You learned this</b> idea <b>from here,</b> whereas <b>we learned it from here,</b> a different verse: “When heaven is closed up, and there is no rain, when they sin against You, if they pray toward this place and confess Your name and turn from their sin, when You afflict them, <b>then You, hear in heaven and forgive the sin of</b> Your servants and of Your people Israel, when You teach them the good way in which they should walk, and send rain upon Your land, which You have given to Your people as an inheritance” (I Kings 8:35–36).

### Part 5
<b>Rabbi Tanḥum, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya of village of Akko, said: The rains are withheld only if the enemies of the Jewish people,</b> a euphemism for the Jewish people, <b>have been sentenced to destruction</b> for their sins, <b>as it is stated: “Drought and heat will steal the snow waters; to the grave those who have sinned”</b> (Job 24:19). According to this interpretation, snow water will be stolen by drought, i.e., there will be none available, when people have sinned to the point that they deserve the grave. <b>Ze’iri from Dihavat said to Ravina: You learned this</b> idea <b>from here; we learned it from here:</b> “And the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you, <b>and He will close up the heavens,</b> and there will be no rain, and the earth will not give its fruit, <b>and you will perish quickly”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:17).

### Part 6
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: The rains are withheld only due to</b> the sin of <b>the nullification of <i>teruma</i> and tithes, as it is stated: “Drought and heat will steal the snow waters”</b> (Job 24:19). The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> in the verse may this idea <b>be inferred</b> from the verse? <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Due to matters that I have commanded you to do in the summer,</b> e.g., take <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the summer produce, <b>and that you did not do, the snow waters will be stolen from you in the rainy season.</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said: The rains are withheld only due to</b> the sin of those <b>who speak slander, as it is stated: “The north wind brings forth rain, but a backbiting tongue, an angry countenance”</b> (Proverbs 25:23). This verse indicates that if the countenance of the heavens is angry, with neither clouds nor rain, it is due to slanderous speech.

### Part 8
<b>Rav Salla said</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna said: The rains are withheld only due to impudent</b> people, <b>as it is stated: “Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no last rain, yet you had a harlot’s forehead,</b> you refused to be ashamed” (Jeremiah 3:3). <b>And Rav Salla said</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna said,</b> with regard to the same verse: <b>Any man who is insolent will ultimately stumble over</b> the <b>transgression</b> of prostitution, <b>as it is stated: “Yet you had a prostitute’s forehead.” Rav Naḥman said:</b> The verse does not mean that he will commit a sexual transgression in the future; rather, <b>it is known that he has</b> already <b>stumbled over</b> this <b>transgression, as it is stated: “You had,”</b> in the past tense, <b>and it is not stated: You will.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to <b>any man who is insolent, it is permitted to call him wicked</b> to his face, <b>as it is stated: “A wicked man makes his face insolent”</b> (Proverbs 21:29). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It is permitted to hate him, as it is stated: “And the insolence of his face is changed”</b> (Ecclesiastes 8:1). <b>Do not read</b> it as: <b>“Is changed [<i>yeshunne</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>Is hated [<i>yissane</i>],</b> as the two words are spelled the same way in Hebrew, albeit with different vocalization and pronunciation.

### Part 10
<b>Rav Ketina said: The rains are withheld only due to</b> the sin of <b>dereliction in</b> the study of <b>Torah, as it is stated: “By slothfulness the rafters [<i>hamekare</i>] will sink in [<i>yimakh</i>],</b> and through idleness of the hands the house leaks” (Ecclesiastes 10:18). <b>Due to slothfulness that was</b> present <b>amongst the Jewish people, that they did not occupy</b> themselves <b>with Torah, the enemy of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> a euphemism for God Himself, has <b>sunk. And sunk [<i>makh</i>]</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>poor, as it is stated: “But if he is too poor [<i>makh</i>] for your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:8). <b>And “rafters [<i>mekare</i>]”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than a reference to <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Who lays the beams [<i>hamekare</i>] of Your upper chambers in the water”</b> (Psalms 104:3).

### Part 11
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> that this idea is derived <b>from here: “And now that men do not see the light, it is bright in the skies, but the wind passes and cleanses them”</b> (Job 37:21). <b>And “light”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>Torah, as it is stated: “For a mitzva is a lamp and Torah is a light”</b> (Proverbs 6:23). According to this interpretation, the verse means that when “men do not see the light,” i.e., when they are not occupied with Torah, <b>“it is bright in the skies,”</b> as there are no rainclouds. With regard to this verse, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Even when the sky is comprised of bright clouds</b> that serve <b>to bring down dew and rain,</b> no rain will fall, as <b>“the wind passes and cleanses them.”</b>

### Part 12
<b>Rabbi Ami said: The rains are withheld only due to the sin of robbery, as it is stated: “He covers His hands with the light,</b> and He has commanded it due to imploring” (Job 36:32). This means that due <b>to the sin of</b> stealing <b>hands,</b> God <b>has covered the light</b> and no rain will fall. <b>And</b> Rabbi Ami adds that the term <b>“hand”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than a sin of <b>violence, as it is stated:</b> “And from the violence that is in their hands” (Jonah 3:8). And “light” means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>rain, as it is stated: “He spreads abroad the cloud of His light”</b> (Job 37:11).

### Part 13
<b>What is the remedy</b> of one who has caused the rain to be withheld? He should <b>increase</b> his <b>prayers, as it is stated</b> in the same chapter: <b>“And He has commanded it due to imploring”</b> (Job 37:12), <b>and “imploring”</b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>prayer, as it is stated: “Therefore, do not pray you for this nation,</b> neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, <b>neither implore Me”</b> (Jeremiah 7:16).

### Part 14
<b>And Rabbi Ami said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “If the iron is blunt, and does not whet the edge”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:10)? <b>If you see a sky that is blunt as iron, in that</b> it does not <b>bring down dew and rain,</b> this is <b>due to</b> the <b>deeds of the generation, which are corrupt, as it is stated: “And does not whet [<i>kilkal</i>] the edge [<i>panim</i>].”</b> <i>Panim</i>, which also means face, is often used in reference to the leaders of a generation, while the term <i>kilkal</i> is similar to the word for corrupt, <i>mekulkalin</i>.

### Part 15
<b>What is their remedy? They</b> must <b>increase</b> their prayers <b>for mercy, as it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“Then must he increase his strength, but wisdom is profitable to direct”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:10). This verse hints that rain will fall if one increases his strength, i.e., his prayers for mercy. The last part of the verse means that, <b>all the more so, if their deeds</b> had been righteous and <b>direct from the beginning,</b> the rains would not have been withheld.

### Part 16
The Gemara cites a different interpretation of the same verse. <b>Reish Lakish said: If you see a student</b>
