### Part 1
In a case of this kind, <b>that city fasts and cries out</b> by blowing the <i>shofar</i>, <b>and all of its surrounding areas</b> join them in their <b>fast, but they do not cry out. Rabbi Akiva</b> disagrees and <b>says: They cry out but they do not fast.</b> The mishna continues: <b>And likewise,</b> if a <b>city is</b> afflicted <b>by pestilence or collapsing buildings, that city fasts and cries out, and all of its surrounding areas fast but they do not cry out. Rabbi Akiva says: They cry out but they do not fast.</b>

### Part 2
The mishna inquires: <b>What is</b> considered a plague of <b>pestilence?</b> When is a series of deaths treated as a plague? The mishna answers: If <b>a city that sends out five hundred infantrymen,</b> i.e., it has a population of five hundred able-bodied men, <b>and three dead are taken out of it on three consecutive days, this</b> is a plague of <b>pestilence,</b> which requires fasting and crying out. If the death rate is <b>lower than that, this is not pestilence.</b>

### Part 3
<b>For the following</b> calamities <b>they cry out in every place: For blight; for mildew; for locusts; for caterpillars,</b> a type of locust that comes in large swarms and descends upon a certain place; <b>for dangerous beasts</b> that have entered a town; <b>and for the sword,</b> i.e., legions of an invading army. The reason that <b>they cry out about these</b> misfortunes in every place is <b>because</b> these are <b>calamities that spread.</b>

### Part 4
<b>An incident</b> occurred in <b>which Elders descended from Jerusalem to their cities</b> throughout Eretz Yisrael <b>and decreed a fast</b> throughout the land <b>because there was seen in</b> the city of <b>Ashkelon</b> a small amount of <b>blight,</b> enough <b>to fill the mouth of an oven.</b> This fast was observed throughout Eretz Yisrael, as blight spreads quickly. <b>And furthermore, they decreed a fast because wolves had eaten two children in Transjordan. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> This fast was decreed <b>not because they ate</b> the children, <b>but because</b> these wolves <b>were</b> merely <b>seen</b> in an inhabited area.

### Part 5
<b>For the following</b> calamities <b>they cry out</b> even <b>on Shabbat: For a city that is surrounded by gentile</b> troops, <b>or</b> for a place in danger of being flooded by <b>a river</b> that has swelled its banks, <b>or for a ship tossed about at sea. Rabbi Yosei said:</b> One may cry out on Shabbat <b>to</b> summon <b>help, but</b> it may <b>not</b> be sounded <b>for crying out</b> to God. <b>Shimon the Timnite says:</b> One may cry out on Shabbat <b>even for pestilence, but the Rabbis did not agree with him.</b>

### Part 6
§ The mishna adds: In general, they cry out <b>on</b> account of any <b>trouble that should not befall the community,</b> a euphemism for trouble that may befall the community, <b>except for an overabundance of rain.</b> Although too much rain may be disastrous, one does not cry out over it, because rain is a sign of a blessing. The mishna relates: <b>An incident</b> occurred in <b>which</b> the people said <b>to Ḥoni HaMe’aggel: Pray that rain should fall. He said to them: Go out and bring in</b> the clay <b>ovens</b> used to roast the Paschal lambs, <b>so that they will not dissolve</b> in the water, as torrential rains are certain to fall. <b>He prayed, and no rain fell</b> at all.

### Part 7
<b>What did he do? He drew a circle</b> on the ground <b>and stood inside it and said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, Your children have turned their faces toward me, as I am like a member of Your household.</b> Therefore, <b>I take an oath by Your great name that I will not move from here until You have mercy upon Your children</b> and answer their prayers for rain. <b>Rain began to trickle</b> down, but only in small droplets. <b>He said: I did not ask for this, but</b> for <b>rain to</b> fill the <b>cisterns, ditches, and caves</b> with enough water to last the entire year. Rain <b>began to fall furiously. He said: I did not ask for this</b> damaging rain either, <b>but</b> for <b>rain of benevolence, blessing, and generosity.</b>

### Part 8
Subsequently, the rains <b>fell in their standard manner</b> but continued unabated, filling the city with water <b>until all of the Jews exited</b> the residential areas of <b>Jerusalem</b> and went <b>to the Temple Mount due to the rain. They came and said to him: Just as you prayed over</b> the rains <b>that they should fall, so too, pray that they should stop. He said to them: Go out and see if the Claimants’ Stone,</b> a large stone located in the city, upon which proclamations would be posted with regard to lost and found articles, <b>has been washed away.</b> In other words, if the water has not obliterated the Claimants’ Stone, it is not yet appropriate to pray for the rain to cease.

### Part 9
<b>Shimon ben Shetaḥ,</b> the <i>Nasi</i> of the Sanhedrin at the time, <b>relayed to</b> Ḥoni HaMe’aggel: <b>Were you not Ḥoni, I would have decreed that you be ostracized, but what can I do to you? You nag [<i>mitḥatei</i>] God and He does your bidding, like a son who nags his father and</b> his father <b>does his bidding</b> without reprimand. After all, rain fell as you requested. <b>About you, the verse states: “Let your father and your mother be glad, and let her who bore you rejoice”</b> (Proverbs 23:25).

### Part 10
The mishna teaches another <i>halakha</i> with regard to fast days: If <b>they were fasting</b> for rain, <b>and rain fell for them before sunrise,</b> they need <b>not complete</b> their fast until the evening. However, if it fell <b>after sunrise, they</b> must <b>complete</b> their fast. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If rain fell <b>before midday,</b> they need <b>not complete</b> their fast; but if it rains <b>after midday, they</b> must <b>complete</b> their fast.

### Part 11
The mishna relates: <b>An incident</b> occurred in <b>which</b> the court <b>decreed a fast in Lod</b> due to a lack of rain, <b>and rain fell for them before midday. Rabbi Tarfon said to</b> the people: <b>Go out, and eat, and drink, and treat</b> this day as <b>a Festival. And they went out, and ate, and drank, and treated</b> the day as <b>a Festival, and</b> in the <b>afternoon they came</b> to the synagogue <b>and recited the great <i>hallel</i>,</b> to thank God for answering their prayers.

### Part 12
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught: <b>The order of these fasts is stated</b> only when the fast concerns <b>the first rainfall. And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> between this statement and the following <i>baraita</i>: If the periods of <b>the first and second rainfall</b> pass without rain, this is the time <b>to ask</b> and pray for rain; if <b>the third</b> passes without rain, this is the time <b>to fast.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: When</b> does <b>the order of</b> these <b>fasts</b> that <b>is stated</b> apply? <b>When</b> the periods of the <b>first, second, and third rainfall have passed and rain has not fallen. However, if rain fell in</b> the time of <b>the first rainfall, and</b> the people <b>sowed but</b> the plants <b>did not sprout, or, alternatively, if they sprouted</b> a little, <b>but</b> their appearance <b>changed back</b> for the worse, as no rain fell after the first rainfall, <b>they cry out about it immediately.</b>

### Part 14
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This applies <b>specifically</b> if their appearance <b>changed. However,</b> if they <b>dried</b> out entirely, they do <b>not</b> cry out, as this condition cannot be improved. The Gemara asks: It <b>is obvious</b> that this is the case, because in the mishna <b>we learned</b> the word <b>changed.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for Rav Naḥman to issue his statement with regard to a case <b>where they produced stalks</b> after they dried out. <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>producing stalks is a matter</b> of significance, as it is a sign of strengthening, and the crops might be saved through prayer, Rav Naḥman therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.

### Part 15
The mishna further taught: <b>And likewise,</b> if <b>rain ceased</b> for a period of <b>forty days</b> between <b>one rainfall and another,</b> they cry out about this, because it is a plague of drought. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>A plague of drought?</b> Isn’t this simply a drought? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The mishna means that a period of forty days between one rainfall and the next <b>is a plague that</b> may <b>cause a drought.</b> In this regard, <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> When crops do not grow in one place due to lack of rain and must be imported by means of one <b>river to</b> another <b>river,</b>
