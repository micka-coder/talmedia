that <b>they may ascend to wherever they wish,</b> i.e., they may go to Jerusalem, Bethel, or Dan.

### Part 2
<b>Rav Mattana said:</b> There was an additional salvation on this day, as it was the <b>day that the slain of Beitar were brought to burial,</b> several years after the battle at Beitar (see <i>Gittin</i> 57a). <b>And Rav Mattana said: On the same day that the slain of Beitar were brought to burial, they instituted</b> the blessing: <b>Who is good and does good, at Yavne. Who is good,</b> thanking God that the corpses <b>did not decompose</b> while awaiting burial, <b>and does good,</b> thanking God <b>that they were</b> ultimately <b>brought to burial.</b>

### Part 3
It is <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef who both say:</b> The fifteenth of Av was the <b>day on which they stopped chopping down trees for the arrangement</b> of wood that burned on the altar, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: From the fifteenth of Av onward, the strength of the sun grows weaker, and</b> from this date <b>they would not cut</b> additional <b>wood for the arrangement, as they</b> would <b>not</b> be properly <b>dry,</b> and they would therefore be unfit for use in the Temple.

### Part 4
<b>Rav Menashya said: And they called</b> the fifteenth of Av the <b>day of the breaking of the scythe,</b> as from this date onward no more trees were cut down, and therefore it was a celebration for the trees. The Gemara adds: <b>From</b> the fifteenth of <b>Av onward,</b> when the days begin to shorten, <b>one who adds</b> to his nightly Torah study <b>will add</b> years to his life, <b>and he who does not add [<i>mosif</i> ] will be gathered [<i>ye’asef</i> ].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>He will be gathered? Rav Yosef said:</b> It means that <b>his mother will bury him,</b> as he will be gathered to his grave (see Genesis 49:33).

### Part 5
§ The mishna taught: <b>As on them the daughters of Jerusalem</b> would go out in white clothes, and on the fifteenth of Av they would go out to the vineyards and dance. <b>The Sages taught</b> this tradition in greater detail: <b>The daughter of the king borrows</b> white garments <b>from the daughter of the High Priest; the daughter of the High Priest</b> borrows <b>from the daughter of the deputy High Priest; the daughter of the deputy High Priest</b> borrows <b>from the daughter of</b> the priest <b>anointed for war,</b> i.e., the priest who would read verses of Torah and address the army as they prepared for battle; <b>the daughter of</b> the priest <b>anointed for war</b> borrows <b>from the daughter of a common priest; and all the Jewish people borrow from each other.</b> Why would they all borrow garments? They did this <b>so as not to embarrass one who did not have</b> her own white garments.

### Part 6
The mishna further taught: <b>All the garments</b> that the women borrowed <b>require immersion,</b> as those who previously wore them before might have been ritually impure. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Even</b> if the garments were <b>folded and placed in a box [<i>kufsa</i>],</b> an indication that they had not been touched for a long time, they nevertheless require ritual immersion before being worn.

### Part 7
The mishna also stated that <b>the daughters of the Jewish people</b> would <b>go out and dance in the vineyards.</b> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught: One who did not have a wife</b> would <b>turn to there</b> to find one.

### Part 8
It is taught that <b>those</b> women <b>of distinguished lineage among them would say: Young man,</b> please lift up your eyes and see what you choose for a wife. <b>The Sages taught</b> this practice in greater detail in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What would the beautiful women among them say? Set your eyes toward beauty, as a wife is only for her beauty. What would those of distinguished lineage among them say? Set your eyes toward family, as a wife is only for children,</b> and the children of a wife from a distinguished family will inherit her lineage. <b>What would the ugly ones among them say? Acquire your purchase for the sake of Heaven, provided that you adorn us with golden jewelry</b> after our marriage to beautify us.

### Part 9
The tractate concludes with a statement related to the topic of dancing. <b>Ulla</b> of the city of <b>Bira’a said</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> In the <b>future,</b> in the end of days, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, will arrange a dance of the righteous, and He</b> will <b>be sitting among them in</b> the <b>Garden of Eden, and each and every one</b> of the righteous will <b>point</b> to God <b>with his finger, as it is stated: “And it shall be said on that day: Behold, this is our God, for whom we waited, that He might save us. This is the Lord; for whom we waited. We will be glad and rejoice in His salvation”</b> (Isaiah 25:9). God will be revealed, so that every righteous individual will be able to say: This is our God, as though they were pointing at Him with a finger.
