### Part 1
<b>and for</b> commemorative <b>holidays that are written in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>,</b> which contains a list of dates on which the Sages prohibited fasting.

### Part 2
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person should not say: I am</b> only <b>a student,</b> and consequently <b>I am unworthy to be</b> considered <b>an individual</b> who fasts, as stated in the mishna. <b>Rather,</b> with regard to the fasts of individuals, <b>all Torah scholars are individuals.</b> The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>Who is an individual and who is a student? An individual</b> is <b>anyone who is</b> learned in Torah <b>and worthy to be appointed leader</b> and teacher <b>over the community. A student</b> is <b>any</b> Torah scholar <b>who is asked a matter of <i>halakha</i> in his studies and he says</b> the correct answer, <b>and</b> this is the case <b>even</b> if he is familiar only <b>with</b> the <b>tractate of</b> the <b><i>kalla</i></b> month, i.e., the tractate the community studied that year.

### Part 3
<b>The Sages taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Not everyone who wishes to make himself an individual</b> and conduct himself accordingly <b>may do</b> so, and nor may everyone who wants to act like <b>a student do</b> so. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> One <b>may do</b> so, <b>and</b> he is even <b>remembered for good, as</b> the conduct of a Torah student <b>is not</b> a source of <b>praise for him, but it is</b> a source of <b>pain for him.</b> It is proper for one to take these obligations upon himself and he is not considered to be acting inappropriately.

### Part 4
It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Not everyone who wishes to make himself an individual may do</b> so, and nor may everyone who wishes to act like <b>a student do</b> so. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to a matter of praise,</b> e.g., adorning oneself with the garments of a Torah scholar. <b>However, with regard to a matter of pain,</b> when Torah scholars act strictly, one <b>may do</b> so, <b>and</b> one who acts strictly is <b>remembered for good, as</b> it <b>is not</b> a source of <b>praise for him, but it is</b> a source of <b>pain for him.</b>

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who was fasting for</b> a certain <b>trouble and</b> the trouble <b>passed,</b> or if one was fasting <b>for</b> the recovery of <b>a sick person and</b> that person <b>was healed,</b> one may not cease his fast merely because its cause has been removed; rather, <b>he completes</b> his <b>fast.</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>one who goes from a place where they are not fasting to a place where they are fasting, he fasts with them.</b> Conversely, with regard to one who goes <b>from a place where they are fasting to a place where they are not fasting, he completes his fast</b> as a resident of his hometown.

### Part 6
With regard to one who <b>forgot</b> the fast <b>and ate and drank, he should not show himself before the community</b> while satiated, <b>and he should not indulge in luxuries.</b> One should not think that because one has already eaten, his fast is completely nullified, and one may conduct himself as if it were not a fast day at all. Rather, one should minimize one’s eating, <b>as it is stated: “And Jacob said to his sons: Why do you show yourselves?”</b> (Genesis 42:1). <b>Jacob said to his sons: Do not show yourselves when you are satiated, not before</b> the members of the house of <b>Esau, nor before</b> those of <b>Ishmael, so that they not be jealous of you,</b> as they suffer from hunger. This teaches that one should not show he is full when others are hungry.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara presents another piece of advice related to the story of Joseph and his brothers. Joseph said to them: <b>“See that you not fall out by the way”</b> (Genesis 45:24). <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Joseph said to his brothers: Do not become occupied in a matter of <i>halakha</i>, lest you fall out on the way.</b> If you discuss a <i>halakha</i> while traveling you might get into an argument, and it is important for travelers to remain on good terms.

### Part 8
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Elai bar Berekhya say:</b> With regard to <b>two Torah scholars who are walking along the road and there are no Torah matters</b> discussed <b>between them, they are worthy of being burned, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both asunder”</b> (II Kings 2:11). The <b>reason that</b> the chariot of fire did not harm Elisha is because there <b>was</b> a Torah <b>matter</b> between them, from which it may be inferred that had they <b>not</b> been discussing a Torah <b>matter, they</b> would have been <b>worthy of being burned.</b>

### Part 9
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> opinion of Rabbi Elai bar Berekhya is referring to <b>studying</b> by rote, by reviewing material one has already learned, which is permitted and even appropriate while traveling, whereas <b>that</b> opinion of Rabbi Elazar is referring to <b>examining</b> a <i>halakha</i> in depth, in which case it is likely that the scholars will come into conflict.

### Part 10
It <b>is taught in a <i>baraita</i></b> that Joseph said to his brothers: <b>Do not take long strides and bring the sun into the city,</b> i.e., you should enter the city to spend the night there before the sun has set. The Gemara elaborates: <b>Do not take long strides, as the Master said: A long stride takes away one five-hundredth of a person’s eyesight,</b> and this loss is not worth the time saved.

### Part 11
The Gemara further explains: <b>And bring the sun into the city,</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said. As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: A person</b> should <b>always leave</b> the place where he has spent the night <b>with “it is good”</b> (Genesis 1:4), i.e., after sunrise, as the Torah uses the expression “it is good” with regard to the creation of light. This goodness is manifest in the sense of security one feels when it is light. <b>And</b> likewise, when one comes into an unfamiliar city <b>he</b> should <b>enter with “it is good,”</b> before sunset, <b>as it is stated: “As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away”</b> (Genesis 44:3).

### Part 12
Similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said: One who is walking along the road</b> should <b>not eat more</b> each day <b>than</b> he would normally eat each day <b>in a year of famine.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Here</b> in Babylonia <b>they interpreted</b> that the reason is <b>due to</b> one’s <b>bowels.</b> Since the exertion of traveling can damage full bowels, it is preferable to eat less than the normal amount. <b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, they <b>say</b> that the reason is <b>due to food,</b> i.e., if one eats too much, his food may not last the entire journey, and therefore he should ration his meals. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these two opinions? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them</b>
