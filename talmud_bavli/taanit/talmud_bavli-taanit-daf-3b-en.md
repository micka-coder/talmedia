### Part 1
<b>is not withheld,</b> and therefore it continued even during this time of drought. The Gemara asks: <b>And since dew is not withheld, why did Elijah swear</b> that there would be no dew as well as no rain? The Gemara explains that <b>this is what</b> Elijah <b>said to</b> Ahab: Not only will there be no rainfall, but <b>even</b> the <b>dew of blessing,</b> which helps crops grow, <b>will not come.</b> This prediction was indeed fulfilled. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> God <b>restore</b> the <b>dew of blessing</b> when He ended the drought of rain, in the aforementioned verse. The Gemara answers: This was not necessary, <b>because the matter is not recognizable,</b> i.e., people cannot distinguish between dew of blessing and the regular dew which is always present.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>winds, from where do we</b> derive that <b>it is not withheld</b> but perpetually blows? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said that the verse states: “For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, says the Lord”</b> (Zechariah 2:10). He clarifies: <b>What is</b> God <b>saying to them? If we say</b> that <b>this is what the Holy One, Blessed be He, is saying to the Jewish people: I have scattered you to the four winds of the world; if so,</b> why did He say <b>“as the four</b> winds”? He <b>should have</b> said: <b>To the four</b> winds. <b>Rather, this is what</b> God <b>is saying: Just as the world cannot</b> exist <b>without winds, so too, the world cannot</b> exist <b>without the Jewish people.</b> This interpretation of the verse is based on the claim that the winds never cease.

### Part 3
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Therefore,</b> since wind and dew are always present, if <b>during the summer one recited: He makes the wind blow, we do not require him to return</b> and repeat the blessing since the wind blows during the summer as well. However, if <b>one recited</b> during the summer: <b>He makes the rain fall, we require him to return</b> and repeat the blessing, because rain in the summer is a curse.

### Part 4
Conversely, <b>in the rainy season,</b> if <b>one did not recite: He makes the wind blow, we do not require him to return</b> to the beginning, because the wind blows regardless. If <b>one did not recite: He makes the rain fall, we require him to return</b> and repeat the blessing. <b>And not only that, but even</b> if <b>one</b> mistakenly <b>recited: He removes the wind and lifts the dew,</b> i.e., that there should be no wind or dew, <b>we do not require him to return</b> and repeat the blessing, because wind and dew are always present.

### Part 5
It was <b>taught</b> in a similar <i>baraita</i>: With regard <b>to clouds and</b> with regard <b>to wind, the Sages did not obligate one to mention</b> them, but <b>if one wishes to mention</b> them, <b>he may mention</b> them. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> The Gemara answers, as above: <b>Because</b> clouds and winds are constant and <b>are not withheld.</b>

### Part 6
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> are <b>they not withheld? But didn’t Rav Yosef teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“And He will close up the heavens”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:17), means that God will stop up the heavens <b>from the clouds and from the winds?</b> Do <b>you say</b> that “close up the heavens” means <b>from the clouds and from the winds, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> referring to the absence <b>of rainfall? When</b> the same verse <b>says: “So that there will be no rain,” rain is</b> already <b>mentioned</b> explicitly. <b>How</b> then <b>do I uphold</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And He will close up the heavens”?</b> This must mean <b>from the clouds and from the winds.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara summarizes its question: This is <b>difficult</b> due to the contradiction between the statement about <b>wind</b> in the first <i>baraita</i> and the statement about <b>wind</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, and is similarly <b>difficult</b> due to the contradiction between the statement about <b>clouds</b> in the first <i>baraita</i> and the statement about <b>clouds</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara answers: The contradiction between one statement about <b>clouds</b> and the other statement about <b>clouds</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> first <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>early</b> clouds that precede the rain, which come whether or not rain actually falls, whereas <b>this</b> second <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>late</b> clouds, which materialize after rainfall. These late clouds are sometimes withheld by God as a punishment.

### Part 8
Likewise, the contradiction between the first statement about <b>wind</b> and the second statement about <b>wind</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> first <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a typical wind,</b> which is never withheld, while <b>this</b> second <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>an atypical wind,</b> which may be withheld. The Gemara asks: <b>An atypical wind is fit for</b> winnowing grain on <b>the threshing floor.</b> Since this wind is also a necessity, one should pray for it as well. The Gemara answers: Since it is <b>possible</b> to winnow grain <b>with sieves</b> when there is no wind, there is no great need for these winds.

### Part 9
§ It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Clouds and winds are</b> so significant that, in terms of their benefit, they are <b>secondary</b> only <b>to rain.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which this claim is correct? <b>Ulla, and some say Rav Yehuda, said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to the clouds and winds <b>that</b> come <b>after rainfall.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> clouds and winds that come after rain <b>are beneficial? But isn’t it written</b> in the chapter of the curses: <b>“The Lord will make the rain of your land powder and dust”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:24), <b>and Ulla, and some say Rav Yehuda, said:</b> This curse is referring to <b>winds that come after rain,</b> as they raise up powder and dust?

### Part 10
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> since <b>this</b> first statement of Ulla is referring to beneficial wind <b>that comes gently,</b> whereas <b>this</b> second statement of Ulla is referring to harmful wind <b>that comes forcefully [<i>razya</i>],</b> raises up powder and dust, and reduces the effectiveness of the rain. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>This,</b> Ulla’s second statement, is referring to wind <b>that raises dust;</b> whereas <b>this,</b> Ulla’s first statement, is referring to wind <b>that does not raise dust.</b>

### Part 11
<b>And</b> on a related topic, <b>Rav Yehuda said: Wind that</b> blows <b>after rain is</b> as beneficial to the earth <b>as rain</b> itself. <b>Clouds that</b> appear <b>after rain are</b> as beneficial <b>as rain,</b> while <b>sunlight that</b> follows <b>after rain is</b> as beneficial <b>as two rainfalls.</b> The Gemara asks: If wind, clouds, and sun are all beneficial after rainfall, <b>what</b> does Rav Yehuda’s statement serve <b>to exclude?</b> The Gemara answers: He comes <b>to exclude the glow of the evening and the sun that</b> shines <b>between the clouds,</b> appearing only in patches. These phenomena are harmful after rain.

### Part 12
On a related note, <b>Rava said: Snow is as beneficial to the mountains as five rainfalls to the earth</b> of the plains, <b>as it is stated: “For He says to the snow: Fall on the earth, likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of His mighty rain”</b> (Job 37:6). This verse compares snow to rain by means of five allusions to types of rainfall: The word “rain,” which appears twice; the word “shower”; and the plural “showers,” which indicates two rainfalls. This teaches that snow is as beneficial as five rainfalls.

### Part 13
<b>And</b> on the same topic, <b>Rava said: Snow</b> brings benefits <b>to the mountains; strong rain</b> provides benefits <b>to trees; light rain</b> brings benefit <b>to fruit;</b>
