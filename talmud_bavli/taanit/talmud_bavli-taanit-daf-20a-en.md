### Part 1
<b>and now it will rain? He entered the bathhouse in</b> a state of <b>joy,</b> anticipating the large sum of money he was about to receive. <b>As the master entered the bathhouse in his joy, Nakdimon entered the Temple in</b> a state of <b>sadness. He wrapped himself</b> in his prayer shawl <b>and stood in prayer.</b>

### Part 2
<b>He said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, it is revealed and known before You that I did not act for my own honor, nor did I act for the honor of my father’s house. Rather, I acted for Your honor, so that there should be water for the Festival pilgrims. Immediately the sky became overcast and rain fell until the twelve cisterns were filled with water, and</b> there was even more water, so that <b>they overflowed.</b>

### Part 3
<b>As the master left the bathhouse, Nakdimon ben Guryon left the Temple. When they met one another,</b> Nakdimon <b>said to him: Give me</b> the <b>money you owe me</b> for <b>the extra water</b> you received. The official <b>said to him: I know that the Holy One, Blessed be He, has shaken His world and caused rain to fall only for you. However, I still maintain a claim against you,</b> by <b>which I can</b> legally <b>take my coins from you, as</b> you did not pay me on the agreed date, <b>for the sun had already set, and</b> therefore <b>the rain fell onto my property.</b>

### Part 4
Nakdimon <b>went back and entered the Temple, wrapped himself</b> in his prayer shawl, <b>and stood in prayer. He said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, let it be known that You have beloved ones in Your world. Immediately, the clouds scattered and the sun shined. At that time, the master said to him: If the sun had not broken through</b> the clouds, <b>I would have</b> had a claim <b>against you,</b> by <b>which I could</b> have <b>taken my coins from you.</b> A Sage <b>taught: Nakdimon was not his</b> real <b>name; rather his name was Buni. And why was</b> he <b>called Nakdimon? Because the sun broke through [<i>nikdera</i>] for him.</b>

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>three</b> people, <b>the sun broke through</b> and shone at an irregular time <b>for their sake: Moses, Joshua, and Nakdimon ben Guryon.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the case of <b>Nakdimon ben Guryon</b> is known by the aforementioned <b>tradition. The case of Joshua too</b> is derived from <b>a verse, as it is written: “And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed</b> until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies” (Joshua 10:13). <b>However, from where do we</b> derive that the sun shined in a supernatural way for <b>Moses?</b>

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> It is <b>derived</b> by verbal analogy between <b>“I will begin”</b> and <b>“I will begin.” Here,</b> with regard to Moses, <b>it is written:</b> “This day <b>I will begin to put the dread of you</b> and the fear of you upon the peoples that are under all the whole heaven” (Deuteronomy 2:25). <b>And there,</b> with regard to Joshua, <b>it is written:</b> “On this day <b>I will begin to magnify you</b> in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you” (Joshua 3:7). The repeated use of the phrase “I will begin” indicates that all the miracles performed for Joshua were also performed for Moses.

### Part 7
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said:</b> The fact that the sun stood still for Moses is <b>derived</b> by a different verbal analogy, between the terms <b>“put”</b> and <b>“put.” Here,</b> with regard to Moses, <b>it is written: “I will begin to put the dread of you”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:25). <b>And there,</b> with regard to Joshua, <b>is it written:</b> “Then Joshua spoke to the Lord, <b>on the day when the Lord put the Amorites</b> before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel: Sun, stand still upon Gibeon, and you, moon, in the valley of Aijalon” (Joshua 10:12).

### Part 8
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This idea is <b>derived from the verse itself,</b> as it says with regard to Moses: “This day I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you upon the peoples that are under all the whole heaven, <b>who, when they hear the report of you, shall tremble, and be in anguish due to you”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:25). <b>When</b> did the nations of the world <b>tremble and</b> when were they <b>in anguish due to you? When the sun broke through for Moses.</b>

### Part 9
§ The mishna taught: <b>And likewise,</b> if there is a particular <b>city upon which it did not rain,</b> while the surrounding area did receive rain, this is considered a divine curse, as it is written: “And I will cause it to rain on one city, but on one city I will not cause it to rain, one portion will be rained upon, and the portion upon which it did not rain shall wither” (Amos 4:7). <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: And both of</b> the cities are faced <b>with a curse,</b> as one city suffers from drought while the other is afflicted with destructive storms.

### Part 10
This statement reverses the plain meaning of a verse. The Gemara provides other interpretations that Rav Yehuda attributed to Rav, which also run contrary to the simple meaning of a verse. <b>“Jerusalem among them was a like a menstruating woman”</b> (Lamentations 1:17). <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> Although the simple meaning of this verse is a curse, it can also be understood <b>as a blessing.</b> Jerusalem was <b>like a menstruating woman: Just as a menstruating woman</b> will become <b>permitted</b> to her husband after the conclusion of her days of ritual impurity, <b>so too, Jerusalem</b> will be <b>repaired</b> from its destruction.

### Part 11
Similarly, with regard to the verse: <b>“How she has become like a widow”</b> (Lamentations 1:1), <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> This too is <b>for a blessing.</b> The verse states that Jerusalem is <b>like a widow, but is not an actual widow. Rather,</b> Jerusalem is <b>like a woman whose husband has gone to a country overseas.</b> Without her husband by her side she is likened to a widow, <b>and</b> yet <b>he intends to return to her.</b>

### Part 12
The same manner of explanation is provided for the verse: <b>“Therefore I have also made you contemptible and base”</b> (Malachi 2:9). <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> This too can be interpreted <b>as a blessing, as</b> meaning that the nations view us as lowly, but nevertheless, they do not assign us unpleasant jobs. <b>They do not</b> appoint <b>from us either river officials or government officials [<i>geziripatei</i>].</b>

### Part 13
The prophet Ahijah the Shilonite cursed Israel in the following terms: <b>“For the Lord will smite Israel as a reed is shaken in the water”</b> (I Kings 14:15). <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> This too is <b>for a blessing, as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful”</b> (Proverbs 27:6)? <b>The curse with which Ahijah the Shilonite cursed the Jewish people is more</b> effective <b>than the blessing with which Balaam the wicked blessed them.</b>

### Part 14
Rabbi Yoḥanan elaborates: <b>Ahijah the Shilonite cursed</b> the Jewish people <b>by</b> comparing them to <b>a reed: “For the Lord will smite Israel as a reed is shaken in the water.”</b> Although it seems to be a curse, this verse is actually a blessing. <b>Just as this reed stands in a place of water, and its shoots replenish</b> themselves when cut, <b>and its roots are numerous</b> for a plant of its size, <b>and even if all the winds in the world come and blow against it, they cannot move it from its place, rather, it sways with them</b> until <b>the winds subside, and the reed</b> still <b>stands in its place,</b> the same applies to the Jewish people. After all the difficulties that they endure, they will ultimately survive and return home.

### Part 15
<b>However, Balaam the wicked blessed</b> the Jews <b>by</b> comparing them to <b>a cedar, as it is stated: “As cedars beside the waters”</b> (Numbers 24:6). <b>Just as this cedar does not stand in a place of water, and its shoots do not replenish</b> themselves, <b>and its roots are not numerous,</b> Balaam wished that the same should apply to the Jewish people. Furthermore, while it is true that <b>even</b> if <b>all the winds in the world blow</b> against <b>it they will not move it from its place, once the southern wind blows</b> against <b>it, it uproots</b> the cedar <b>and turns it on its face. And not only that, but</b> the <b>reed merited</b> that <b>a quill [<i>kulmos</i>] is taken from it to write with it a Torah scroll, the Prophets, and the Writings.</b> Evidently, the curse comparing Israel to a reed is better than the blessing likening them to a cedar.

### Part 16
<b>The Sages</b> further <b>taught</b> in praise of the reed: <b>A person should always be soft like a reed, and he should not be stiff like a cedar. An incident</b> occurred in <b>which Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, came from Migdal Gedor, from his rabbi’s house, and he was riding on a donkey and strolling on the bank of the river. And he was very happy, and his head was swollen with pride because he had studied much Torah.</b>
