### Part 1
<b>we will recite them both: God of thanksgivings, and: Abundant thanksgivings.</b>

### Part 2
§ The Gemara cites statements in praise of rainfall. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: The day of rain is greater than the resurrection of the dead.</b> The reason is that <b>while the resurrection of the dead</b> benefits only <b>the righteous, rain</b> benefits <b>both the righteous and the wicked.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this statement <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef, as Rav Yosef said: Since</b> rainfall <b>is equivalent to the resurrection of the dead,</b> the Sages <b>established</b> its recitation <b>in</b> the second blessing of the <i>Amida</i>, the blessing of <b>the resurrection of the dead.</b> According to Rav Yosef, rainfall is the equivalent to, but not superior to, the resurrection of the dead.

### Part 3
Similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda said: The day of the rains is as great as the day</b> on which <b>the Torah was given, as it is stated: “My doctrine [<i>likḥi</i>] shall drop as the rain”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:2), <b>and <i>lekaḥ</i> means nothing other</b> than <b>Torah, as it is stated: “For I give you good doctrine [<i>lekaḥ</i>]; do not forsake My Torah”</b> (Proverbs 4:2). <b>Rava said:</b> Rainfall is even <b>greater than the day on which the Torah was given, as it is stated: “My doctrine shall drop as the rain,”</b> and when one makes a comparison, <b>which</b> object <b>is</b> made <b>dependent upon which? You must say</b> that <b>the lesser</b> object <b>is dependent upon the greater</b> one. If Torah is compared to rain, it follows that rain is greater than Torah.

### Part 4
The Gemara cites another interpretation of the verse from Deuteronomy. <b>Rava raised a contradiction:</b> At the beginning of the verse <b>it is written: “My doctrine shall drop [<i>ya’arof</i>] as the rain,”</b> in a harsh manner, <b>and</b> yet later in the verse, <b>it is written: “My speech shall distill as the dew,”</b> in a gentle tone. He resolves this apparent contradiction as follows: <b>If he is a worthy Torah scholar,</b> the Torah flows through him <b>like the dew, but if</b> he is <b>not</b> worthy, <b>it snaps his neck [<i>orfehu</i>] like the</b> powerful <b>rain.</b>

### Part 5
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Bena’a would say: Anyone who engages in Torah for its own sake, his Torah</b> study <b>will be an elixir of life for him, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to them who lay hold upon it”</b> (Proverbs 3:18), <b>and it says: “It shall be health to your navel”</b> (Proverbs 3:8), <b>and it says: “For whoever finds Me finds life”</b> (Proverbs 8:35). <b>And anyone who engages in Torah not for its own sake,</b> e.g., for self-aggrandizement, his Torah <b>will be an elixir of death for him, as it is stated: “My doctrine shall drop [<i>ya’arof</i> ] as the rain,” and <i>arifa</i></b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>killing, as it is stated: “And they shall break the heifer’s neck [<i>arefu</i>] there in the valley”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:4).

### Part 6
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya</b> once <b>said to Rabbi Zeira: Let the Master come and teach</b> a halakhic discourse. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: My heart is weak and I cannot</b> strain myself over a halakhic discourse. Rabbi Yirmeya replied to him: In that case, <b>let the Master tell us a matter of <i>aggada</i>,</b> which does not require as much effort. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For man is a tree of the field”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:19)? <b>And is man</b> actually <b>a tree of the field?</b>

### Part 7
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>because it is written</b> earlier in the same verse: <b>“You may eat of them but you may not cut them down,” and it is written</b> in the next verse: <b>“Them you may destroy and cut down”</b> (Deuteronomy 20:20). This indicates that there are certain trees which may be cut down, while others may not be destroyed. <b>How so? If a Torah scholar is worthy: “You may eat of them but you may not cut them down,” but if</b> he is <b>not</b> worthy: <b>“He you may destroy and cut down.”</b>

### Part 8
The Gemara cites other expositions that deal with Torah study. <b>Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Iron sharpens iron,</b> so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend” (Proverbs 27:17)? This verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as</b> with <b>these iron implements, one sharpens the other</b> when they are rubbed against each other, <b>so too,</b> when <b>Torah scholars</b> study together, they <b>sharpen one another in <i>halakha</i>.</b>

### Part 9
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Why are matters of Torah compared to fire, as it is stated: “Is not My word like fire, says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 23:29)? <b>To tell you: Just as fire does not ignite</b> in <b>a lone</b> stick of wood but in a pile of kindling, <b>so too, matters of Torah are not retained</b> and understood properly by <b>a lone</b> scholar who studies by himself, but by a group of Sages.

### Part 10
<b>And this is what Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “A sword is upon the boasters [<i>habaddim</i>], and they shall become fools [<i>noalu</i>]”</b> (Jeremiah 50:36)? This verse can be interpreted homiletically: There is a <b>sword upon the enemies of Torah scholars,</b> a euphemism for Torah scholars themselves, <b>who sit alone [<i>bad bevad</i>] and study Torah. And not only that, but</b> those who study by themselves <b>grow foolish</b> from their solitary Torah study, <b>as it is stated: “And they shall become fools.”</b>

### Part 11
<b>And not only that, but they sin, as it is written here: “And they shall become fools,” and it is written there: “For that we have done foolishly [<i>noalnu</i>] and for that we have sinned”</b> (Numbers 12:11). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived <b>from here: “The princes of Zoan have become fools [<i>noalu</i>]…they have caused Egypt to go astray”</b> (Isaiah 19:13).

### Part 12
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Why are Torah matters likened to a tree, as it is stated: “It is a tree of life to them who lay hold upon it”</b> (Proverbs 3:18)? This verse comes <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as a small</b> piece of <b>wood can ignite a large piece, so too, minor Torah scholars can sharpen great</b> Torah scholars and enable them to advance in their studies. <b>And this is what Rabbi Ḥanina said: I have learned much from my teachers and even more from my friends, but from my students</b> I have learned <b>more than</b> from <b>all of them.</b>

### Part 13
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa raised a contradiction.</b> In one verse <b>it is written: “To him who is thirsty bring water”</b> (Isaiah 21:14), which indicates that the one who has water must bring it to the thirsty person, <b>and it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1), from which it may be inferred that the thirsty person must seek out water himself. Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa resolves this apparent contradiction by explaining that <b>if he is a worthy student</b> the teacher must seek him out, as in <b>“to him who is thirsty bring water,” but if</b> the student is <b>not</b> worthy, then <b>“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water,”</b> i.e., this student must seek out a teacher himself.

### Part 14
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥama raised</b> another <b>contradiction.</b> In one verse <b>it is written: “Let your springs be dispersed abroad”</b> (Proverbs 5:16), whereas in the next verse <b>it is written: “Let them be your own”</b> (Proverbs 5:17). Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥama explains: <b>If the student</b> sitting before you <b>is worthy,</b> then <b>“Let your springs be dispersed abroad,”</b> as you should teach him, but <b>if</b> he is <b>not</b> worthy, then <b>“Let them be your own.”</b>

### Part 15
<b>And Rabbi Ḥanina bar Idi said: Why are matters of Torah likened to water, as it is written: “Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1)? This verse comes <b>to tell you: Just as water leaves a high place and flows to a low place, so too, Torah matters are retained only by one whose spirit is lowly,</b> i.e., a humble person.

### Part 16
<b>And Rabbi Oshaya said: Why are matters of Torah likened to these three liquids: To water, wine and milk? As it is written</b> with regard to water: <b>“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water,” and it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“Come, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.”</b> This verse comes <b>to tell you: Just as these three liquids can be retained only in the least of vessels,</b> e.g., clay pots, but not vessels of silver and gold, as they will spoil, <b>so too, matters of Torah are retained only by one whose spirit is lowly.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara cites a related incident: This <b>is as the daughter of the</b> Roman <b>emperor said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya,</b> who was an ugly man: <b>Woe to glorious wisdom</b> such as yours, which is contained <b>in an ugly vessel.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya <b>said to her,</b> in a seemingly unrelated response: Does <b>your father keep his wine in</b> simple <b>clay vessels?</b> The emperor’s daughter <b>said to him: Rather, in what,</b> then, <b>should he keep it?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya <b>said to her: You, who are so important,</b> should <b>put it in vessels of gold and silver.</b>

### Part 18
The emperor’s daughter <b>went and said</b> this <b>to her father. He put the wine in vessels of gold and silver and it turned sour.</b> When his advisors <b>came and told the emperor</b> that the wine had turned sour, <b>he said to</b> his daughter: <b>Who told you</b> to do <b>this?</b> His daughter <b>responded: Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya.</b> The emperor <b>summoned him</b> and <b>said to him: Why did you say this to her?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya <b>said to him: Just as she said to me, so I said say to her,</b> to demonstrate to her that fine material is best preserved in the least of vessels. The emperor said to him: <b>But there are handsome people who are learned.</b>
