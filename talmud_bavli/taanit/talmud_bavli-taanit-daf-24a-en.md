### Part 1
<b>One day</b> Rabbi Yosei bar Avin <b>heard</b> Rav Ashi <b>studying</b> and reciting the following statement. <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>one who removes a fish from the sea</b> on Shabbat, <b>when</b> an area <b>on</b> the skin of the fish <b>the size of a <i>sela</i></b> coin <b>has dried up,</b> he is <b>liable</b> for violating the prohibition against slaughtering an animal on Shabbat. A fish in that condition cannot survive, and therefore one who removed it from the water is liable for killing it. Rabbi Yosei bar Avin <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: <b>And let the Master say</b> that this is the case provided that the skin that dried is <b>between its fins.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: And doesn’t the Master maintain that Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Avin said this</b> ruling? Why didn’t you state it in his name? Rabbi Yosei bar Avin <b>said to him: I am he.</b>

### Part 2
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: And didn’t the Master</b> sit <b>before</b> and <b>frequent</b> the study hall <b>of Rabbi Yosei from Yokrat?</b> Rabbi Yosei bar Avin <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: And what is the reason</b> that <b>the Master left</b> him <b>and came here?</b> Rabbi Yosei bar Avin <b>said to him:</b> I was concerned and departed because he is so severe and unforgiving. He is <b>a man who has no mercy on his</b> own <b>son, and no mercy on his daughter. How,</b> then, <b>could he have mercy on me?</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the incident involving <b>his son? One day</b> Rabbi Yosei from Yokrat <b>hired</b> day <b>laborers to</b> work his <b>field. It grew late and he did not bring them food.</b> The workers <b>said to the son of</b> Rabbi Yosei from Yokrat: <b>We are starving. They were sitting under a fig tree,</b> so the son <b>said: Fig tree, fig tree. Yield your fruits,</b> so that my <b>father’s workers may eat.</b> The fig tree <b>yielded</b> fruit, <b>and they ate.</b>

### Part 4
<b>In the meantime, his father came</b> and <b>said to</b> the workers: <b>Do not be angry with me for being late, as I was engaged in a mitzva, and until just now I was traveling</b> for that purpose and could not get here any sooner. <b>They said to him:</b> May <b>the Merciful One satisfy you just as your son satisfied us</b> and gave us food. <b>He said to them: From where</b> did he find food to give you? <b>They said: Such-and-such an incident occurred.</b> Rabbi Yosei from Yokrat <b>said to</b> his son: <b>My son, you troubled your Creator</b> to cause <b>the fig to yield its fruit not in its</b> proper <b>time,</b> so too, you will die young. And indeed, his son <b>died before his time.</b>

### Part 5
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the incident involving <b>his daughter? He had</b> a very <b>beautiful daughter. One day</b> Rabbi Yosei from Yokrat <b>saw a certain man piercing a hole in the hedge</b> surrounding his property <b>and looking at</b> his daughter. Rabbi Yosei <b>said to him: What is this?</b> The man <b>said to him: My teacher, if I have not merited taking her</b> in marriage, shall <b>I not</b> at least <b>merit to look at her? Rabbi Yosei said to her: My daughter, you are causing people distress. Return to your dust, and let people no</b> longer <b>stumble</b> into sin <b>due to you.</b>

### Part 6
§ The Gemara relates another story involving Rabbi Yosei from Yokrat. <b>He had a certain donkey that people hired each day</b> for work. <b>In the evening they would send it back</b> with <b>the money for its hire on its back, and</b> the animal would <b>go to its owner’s house. But if they added or subtracted from</b> the appropriate sum, the donkey <b>would not go. One day</b> someone <b>forgot a pair of sandals on</b> the donkey, <b>and it did not move until they removed</b> the sandals <b>from</b> its back, <b>after which it went off.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara cites more stories about miracles that occurred to righteous individuals. <b>Whenever the charity collectors would see Elazar of</b> the village of <b>Birta, they would hide from him, as any</b> money Elazar <b>had with him he would give them,</b> and they did not want to take all his property. <b>One day,</b> Elazar <b>went to the market to purchase</b> what he needed <b>for his daughter’s dowry. The charity collectors saw him and hid from him.</b>

### Part 8
<b>He went and ran after them, saying to them: I adjure you,</b> tell me, <b>in what</b> mitzva <b>are you engaged? They said to him:</b> We are collecting money for the wedding <b>of an orphan boy and an orphan girl. He said to them:</b> I swear <b>by the Temple service that they take precedence over my daughter. He took everything he had with him and gave it to them. He was left with one</b> single <b>dinar,</b> with which <b>he bought himself wheat, and</b> he then <b>ascended</b> to his house <b>and threw it into the granary.</b>

### Part 9
Elazar’s <b>wife came and said to her daughter: What has your father brought? She said to</b> her mother: <b>Whatever he brought he threw into the granary. She went to open the door of the granary,</b> and <b>saw that the granary was full of wheat,</b> so much so that <b>it was coming out through the doorknob, and the door would not open</b> due <b>to the wheat.</b> The granary had miraculously been completely filled. Elazar’s <b>daughter went to the study hall</b> and <b>said to</b> her father: <b>Come and see what your He Who loves You,</b> the Almighty, <b>has performed for you. He said to her:</b> I swear <b>by the Temple service,</b> as far <b>as you</b> are concerned this wheat <b>is consecrated</b> property, <b>and you have</b> a share <b>in it only as one of the poor Jews.</b> He said this because he did not want to benefit from a miracle.

### Part 10
The Gemara returns to the topic of fasting for rain. <b>Rabbi Yehuda Nesia decreed a fast</b> and <b>prayed for mercy, but rain did not come. He said,</b> lamenting: <b>How great</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the prophet <b>Samuel of Rama,</b> for whom rain fell even when he prayed for it in summer, <b>and</b> myself, <b>Yehuda ben Gamliel. Woe to the generation that is stuck</b> with this leadership; <b>woe to him in whose days this has occurred. He grew upset, and rain came.</b>

### Part 11
The Gemara relates another story involving a <i>Nasi’s</i> decree of a fast for rain. <b>In the house of the <i>Nasi</i> a fast was declared, but they didn’t inform Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish</b> of the fast the day before. <b>In the morning they informed them. Reish Lakish said to Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> What are we to do? <b>We did not accept</b> this fast <b>upon ourselves the evening before,</b> and a fast must be accepted in the afternoon service of the day preceding the fast. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: We are drawn after</b> the community, and therefore, when the <i>Nasi</i> declares a public fast there is no need for an individual to accept it upon himself the day before.

### Part 12
The Gemara further states that on another occasion, <b>a fast was declared in the house of the <i>Nasi</i>, but rain did not come. Oshaya, the youngest</b> member <b>of the group</b> of Sages, <b>taught them</b> a <i>baraita</i>. It is written: <b>“Then it shall be, if it shall be committed in error by the congregation, it being hidden from their eyes”</b> (Numbers 15:24). This verse indicates that the leaders are considered the eyes of the congregation.

### Part 13
Oshaya continued: There is <b>a parable</b> that illustrates this, <b>involving a bride who is in her father’s home</b> and has not yet been seen by her bridegroom. <b>As long as her eyes are beautiful, her body need not be examined,</b> as certainly she is beautiful. However, if <b>her eyes are bleary [<i>terutot</i>], her entire body requires examination.</b> So too, if the leaders of the generation are flawed, it is a sign that the entire generation is unworthy.

### Part 14
By means of this parable, Oshaya was hinting that rain was withheld from the entire nation due to the evil committed by the household of the <i>Nasi</i>. The <b>servants</b> of the <i>Nasi</i> <b>came and placed a scarf around his neck and tormented him</b> as punishment for insulting the house of the <i>Nasi</i>. <b>His townsmen said to them: Let him be, as he also causes us pain</b> with his harsh reproof, but <b>since we see that all his actions are for the sake of Heaven we do not say anything to him and let him be. You too</b> should <b>let him be.</b>

### Part 15
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>declared a fast but rain did not come. Ilfa descended</b> to lead the service <b>before him, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Ilfi. He recited: He Who makes the wind blow, and the wind</b> indeed <b>blew.</b> He continued to recite: And <b>Who makes the rain come, and</b> subsequently, <b>the rain came.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: What are your</b> good <b>deeds,</b> in the merit of which your prayers are answered so speedily? <b>He said to him: I live in an impoverished city, in which there is no wine for <i>kiddush</i> or <i>havdala</i>. I go to the effort of bringing</b> the residents <b>wine for <i>kiddush</i> and <i>havdala</i>, and I</b> thereby enable them to <b>fulfill their duty.</b> In reward for this mitzva, my prayers for rain were answered.

### Part 16
The Gemara relates a similar incident. <b>Rav happened</b> to come to <b>a certain place</b> where <b>he decreed a fast but rain did not come. The prayer leader descended</b> to lead the service <b>before him</b> and <b>recited: He Who makes the wind blow, and the wind blew.</b> He continued and <b>said:</b> And <b>Who makes the rain fall, and the rain came.</b> Rav <b>said to him: What are your</b> good <b>deeds? He said to him: I am a teacher of children, and I teach the Bible to the children of the poor as to the children of the rich, and</b> if there is <b>anyone who cannot</b> pay, <b>I do not take anything from him. And I have a fishpond, and any</b> child <b>who neglects</b> his studies, <b>I bribe him with</b> the fish <b>and calm him, and soothe him until he comes and reads.</b>

### Part 17
The Gemara further relates: <b>Rav Naḥman decreed a fast, prayed for mercy, but rain did not come.</b> In his misery, he <b>said: Take Naḥman</b> and <b>throw him from the wall to the ground,</b> as the fast he decreed has evidently had no effect. <b>He grew upset, and rain came.</b>

### Part 18
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabba decreed a fast. He prayed for mercy, but rain did not come. They said to him: But when</b> this <b>Rav Yehuda decreed a fast, rain would come. He said to them: What can I do? If</b> the difference between us is <b>due to</b> Torah <b>study, we are superior to</b> the previous generation, <b>as in the years of Rav Yehuda all of their learning</b>
