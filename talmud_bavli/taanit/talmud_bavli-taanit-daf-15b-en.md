### Part 1
<b>in the days of Rabbi Ḥalafta and Rabbi Ḥananya ben Teradyon, that someone passed before the ark</b> as prayer leader <b>and finished the entire blessing</b> of the fast day, <b>but</b> the congregation <b>did not answer amen after him.</b> Instead, the attendant of the synagogue said: <b>Sound</b> the <i>shofar</i> with a long, unwavering sound, <b>priests, blow</b> the <i>shofar</i>. The prayer leader continued: <b>He Who answered Abraham on Mount Moriah, He will answer you and hear the sound of your cry on this day.</b> Once again, the attendant announced: <b>Blast</b> the <i>shofar</i>, with a wavering sound, <b>sons of Aaron, blast.</b> The prayer leader resumed: <b>He Who answered our forefathers by the Red Sea, He will answer you and hear the sound of your cry on this day,</b> and continued in this way.

### Part 2
<b>And when</b> this <b>matter came before</b> the <b>Sages,</b> and they heard the custom of Rabbi Ḥalafta and Rabbi Ḥananya ben Teradyon, <b>they said: They would act</b> in accordance with <b>this custom only at the Eastern Gate</b> of the Temple <b>and on the Temple Mount.</b> However, this ceremony is never performed outside the Temple.

### Part 3
§ On <b>the first three fasts, the members of the priestly watch,</b> who are in charge of the Temple service that week, <b>fast but do not complete</b> their fast. <b>And the members of the patrilineal family,</b> who perform the Temple service on that particular day, <b>did not fast at all.</b> On <b>the second</b> set of <b>three</b> fast days, <b>the members of the priestly watch fast and complete</b> the fast, <b>and the members of the patrilineal family fast but do not complete</b> their fasts. On <b>the final seven</b> fasts, <b>both</b> groups <b>fast and complete</b> the fasts. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua.</b>

### Part 4
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> On <b>the first three fasts,</b> the members of <b>both</b> groups <b>do not fast at all.</b> On <b>the second three</b> fast days, <b>the members of the priestly watch fast and do not complete</b> their fast, <b>and the members of the patrilineal family do not fast at all.</b> On <b>the final seven, the members of the priestly watch fast and complete</b> the fast, <b>and the members of the patrilineal family fast but do not complete</b> their fast.

### Part 5
The mishna mentions another difference between the members of the priestly watch and the patrilineal family: <b>The members of the priestly watch</b> were <b>permitted to drink wine during the nights, but not during the days,</b> as they might be called upon to assist in the Temple service, which may not be performed after drinking wine. <b>And the members of the patrilineal family,</b> who performed the Temple service, were not permitted to drink wine, <b>neither at night nor during the day,</b> as their tasks were performed at night as well. It is <b>prohibited</b> for both <b>the members of the priestly watch and the members of the non-priestly watch to cut their hair or launder</b> their garments throughout the week, <b>but on Thursday</b> it <b>is permitted</b> for them to cut their hair and launder their clothes <b>in deference to Shabbat.</b>

### Part 6
§ The mishna returns to the issue of fasting: <b>Any</b> day concerning which <b>it is written in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> not to eulogize</b> on that day, it is also <b>prohibited</b> to eulogize on the day <b>before,</b> but it is <b>permitted</b> to do so on the <b>following</b> day. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It is <b>prohibited</b> to eulogize both on the day <b>before and</b> on the <b>following</b> day.

### Part 7
The mishna continues: With regard to those days concerning which it is written only <b>not to fast,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to fast on the day <b>before</b> and on the <b>following</b> day. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> Fasting the day <b>before</b> is <b>prohibited,</b> but on the <b>following</b> day it is <b>permitted</b> to fast.

### Part 8
The mishna continues: <b>One may not decree a fast on the community starting on a Thursday, so as not to cause an increase in prices.</b> If the first of a series of fasts is on a Thursday, then on Friday everyone will come to purchase their food for after the fast and for Shabbat, which will allow the storeowners to take advantage of the crowds and raise their prices. <b>Rather, the first</b> set of <b>three fasts</b> is on <b>a Monday, Thursday, and</b> the following <b>Monday, and the second</b> set of <b>three</b> is on <b>a Thursday, Monday, and</b> the following <b>Thursday. Rabbi Yosei says: Just as the first</b> three fasts do not begin <b>on Thursday, so too, neither the second</b> set <b>nor the last</b> set starts on a Thursday. Instead, all the series of fasts begin on a Monday.

### Part 9
The mishna further states: <b>One may not decree a fast on the community on New Moons, on Hanukkah, or on Purim. And if they</b> decreed and <b>began</b> a set of fasts, and only afterward realized that one of the fasts would occur on one of these days, <b>they do not interrupt</b> the sequence. This is <b>the statement of Rabban Gamliel. Rabbi Meir said: Although Rabban Gamliel said</b> that <b>they do not interrupt</b> the sequence, he <b>concedes</b> that on these days, which are days with special observances, <b>they do not complete</b> the fast. <b>And similarly,</b> when <b>the Ninth of Av occurs on Shabbat eve,</b> the fast is not completed and one eats before the start of Shabbat, so as not to enter Shabbat while fasting.

### Part 10
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: <b>What is the order of fast days? They remove the ark.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is this ritual performed <b>even on the first</b> set of fasts? And the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: On <b>the first and second</b> sets of <b>three fasts,</b> everyone <b>enters the synagogue and they pray in the manner that they pray throughout the entire year.</b>

### Part 11
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And on the final seven</b> fasts <b>they remove the ark to the</b> main <b>city square and place ashes upon the ark, and on the head of the <i>Nasi</i>, and on the head of the deputy <i>Nasi</i>, and each and every</b> member of the community <b>takes</b> ashes <b>and places</b> them <b>upon his head. Rabbi Natan says: They</b> would <b>bring</b> specifically <b>burnt ashes.</b> This <i>baraita</i> indicates that the full ritual is performed only on the final set of fasts. <b>Rav Pappa said</b> in explanation: <b>When we taught the mishna as well,</b> it was <b>taught</b> only with regard <b>to the final</b> set of <b>seven</b> fasts, not the earlier series of fasts.

### Part 12
§ <b>And</b> the mishna further states that ashes are placed <b>on the head of the <i>Nasi</i></b> and on the head of the deputy <i>Nasi</i>. <b>And then</b> it <b>teaches</b> that <b>each and every</b> member of the community <b>places</b> ashes <b>upon his head.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so?</b> Is this the proper order? <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> With regard to matters <b>of greatness,</b> where it is a mark of honor and distinction to be treated first, <b>one begins with the greatest</b> member of the group, <b>but</b> for any matter <b>involving a curse</b> or dishonor, <b>one begins with the least</b> important member of the group.

### Part 13
The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> which provides the sources for this principle. With regard to matters <b>of greatness one begins with the greatest</b> member, <b>as it is stated: “And Moses said to Aaron, and to Elazar and to Itamar,</b> his sons” (Leviticus 10:6). Moses first addresses the most important person, Aaron, and this was a matter of distinction, as the verse continues: “For the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you” (Leviticus 10:7). <b>And</b> for any matter <b>involving a curse, one begins with the least</b> important member of a group, <b>as the serpent was cursed first, and afterward Eve was cursed and afterward Adam was cursed.</b>

### Part 14
Why, then, are the leaders of the community, its most important members, the first to perform these fast day expressions of mourning, which are a response to a curse? The Gemara answers: The reason is that <b>this</b> leadership role in the performance of these acts is considered <b>a distinction</b> and an honor <b>for them, as</b> it is as though the community is <b>saying to them: You are worthy of requesting compassion</b> on behalf <b>of everyone.</b>

### Part 15
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Each and every</b> member of the community <b>places</b> ashes <b>upon his head.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Let the <i>Nasi</i> and the deputy <i>Nasi</i></b> also take ashes <b>themselves and place them upon their</b> own <b>heads. What is different</b> with regard to them, <b>that someone else takes</b> the ashes <b>and places them</b> on their heads? <b>Rabbi Abba of Caesarea said:</b> This is done intentionally, as <b>one who humiliates himself,</b> in this case by placing ashes upon his own head, <b>is not similar to</b>
