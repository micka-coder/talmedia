<b>as though a sacred</b> object <b>is immersed in his bowels,</b> which he may not damage, <b>as it is stated: “The sacred is in your midst; and I will not come into the city”</b> (Hosea 11:9). This statement indicates that it is prohibited to take a fast upon oneself. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> first ruling, that one who fasts is sacred, is referring to a case <b>where he is able to distress himself</b> without causing bodily harm. <b>That</b> second ruling, that one may not overly burden his body, deals with a situation <b>when he is unable to distress himself</b> while avoiding all harm, and he proceeds to fast nevertheless.

### Part 2
<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> One who fasts is <b>called pious, as it is stated: “The pious man does good [<i>gomel</i>] to his own soul; but he who troubles his own flesh</b> is cruel” (Proverbs 11:17). The verb <i>gomel</i> can also mean weaning, or abstaining from unnecessary pleasure. Accordingly, Reish Lakish derives from this verse that one who abstains from food is called pious. Similarly, <b>Rav Sheshet said: This student of a Torah academy who sits in</b> observance of <b>a fast</b> has <b>let a dog eat his portion.</b> Since his fast weakens him and prevents him from studying Torah, it is considered as though a dog ate his meal, as the student derived no benefit from it.

### Part 3
<b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said: There is no</b> completely stringent <b>communal fast in Babylonia, except for the Ninth of Av alone.</b> All other fasts, even those which are fixed and routine for the community, are treated as individual fasts, with regard to both the customs of the fast itself and the <i>halakhot</i> of who is obligated to fast. <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Reish Lakish said: A Torah scholar is not permitted to sit in</b> observance of <b>a fast, due to</b> the fact that his fasting <b>reduces</b> his strength for the <b>heavenly service</b> of Torah study and mitzvot.

### Part 4
§ The mishna taught that during the first set of fasts <b>they eat and drink from after dark,</b> and begin fasting in the morning. <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to <b>an individual who took a fast upon himself, even</b> if <b>he ate and drank the entire night, on the following day he prays</b> in the <i>Amida</i> <b>the prayer of a fast,</b> which begins: Answer us on the day of our fast. If after completing his fast he <b>slept in his fast,</b> i.e., he continued fasting throughout the night, <b>he does not pray</b> the prayer <b>of a fast</b> the next morning.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Yosef said: What does Rav Huna maintain</b> in this regard? Does <b>he hold</b> that <b>one does not fast for</b> only a few <b>hours,</b> i.e., that fasts that do not last from daybreak until nightfall are not considered fasts at all, and therefore these extra hours of the night are not part of his fast, <b>or perhaps</b> he holds that <b>one does fast for</b> a few <b>hours, but one who fasts for</b> a few <b>hours does not pray the prayer of a fast?</b>

### Part 6
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Actually, Rav Huna holds</b> that <b>one does fast for hours, and one who fasts for</b> a few <b>hours does pray the prayer of a fast. But</b> it is <b>different here, as there are hours of the night that he did not take upon himself at the outset.</b> Since one must take an individual fast upon himself beforehand, if he merely continues his fast into the night, these extra hours are not part of his obligation, and therefore he does not add the special prayer for a fast, <i>Aneinu</i>, on the following morning.

### Part 7
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Mar Ukva happened</b> to come to the city of <b>Ginzak.</b> The inhabitants of Ginzak, among other matters, <b>asked him</b> three questions to which he did not know the answer: First, <b>does one fast for hours, or does one not fast for hours?</b> Mar Ukva <b>did not have</b> an answer readily available. Second, are the clay <b>jars</b> belonging <b>to gentiles,</b> which have been used for storing wine, permanently <b>prohibited, or</b> can they be rendered <b>permitted?</b> He <b>did not have</b> an answer readily available. Thirdly, <b>in what</b> garments did <b>Moses serve all seven days of inauguration,</b> as the acting priest when Aaron and his sons were initiated into the priesthood? Once again, he <b>did not have</b> an answer readily available.

### Part 8
Mar Ukva <b>went and asked</b> these questions in the <b>study hall. They said to him:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is: <b>One fasts for hours, and</b> he even <b>prays the prayer of a fast. And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that the <b>jars</b> belonging <b>to gentiles are permitted after</b> they have not been used at all for <b>twelve months.</b> Finally, <b>in what</b> garments did <b>Moses serve all seven days of inauguration?</b> He did not serve in his own clothes, nor in the regular priestly garments, <b>but in</b> a special <b>white cloak. Rav Kahana taught:</b> Moses served <b>in a white cloak that does not have a hem.</b>
