### Part 1
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, then <b>just as</b> a priest who <b>ministers</b> in the Temple may <b>not</b> be physically <b>blemished, so too, a priest who recites the benediction</b> may <b>not</b> be <b>blemished.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: The priest who recites the benediction <b>is</b> also <b>juxtaposed to a nazirite,</b> who is not affected by a blemish.

### Part 2
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see that you juxtaposed</b> the cases <b>in</b> favor of <b>a leniency?</b> Perhaps you should <b>juxtapose for a stringency,</b> by comparing the priest who recites the benediction to a nazirite with regard to grape pits, and comparing him to a priest ministering in the Temple in relation to the prohibition against reciting the benediction if he has a physical blemish. The Gemara explains: These proofs <b>are</b> cited merely as <b>support</b> for <i>halakhot</i> that apply <b>by rabbinic</b> law, <b>and</b> consequently, they are interpreted <b>as a leniency,</b> not a stringency.

### Part 3
§ The mishna taught that <b>these are</b> the <b>non-priestly watches: Since it is stated: “Command the children of Israel.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the mishna <b>saying</b> about the non-priestly watches? How does the verse relate to the watches? The Gemara explains that the mishna <b>is saying as follows:</b> These are the <b>non-priestly watches,</b> which will be explained later. <b>And what is the reason that they instituted non-priestly watches? Since it is stated: “Command the children of Israel and say to them: My offering of food, which is presented to Me made by a fire,</b> of a sweet savor to Me, you shall observe to sacrifice to Me in their due season” (Numbers 28:2).

### Part 4
The mishna continues: <b>But how can a person’s offering be sacrificed when he is not standing next to it? The early prophets,</b> Samuel and David, <b>instituted twenty-four priestly watches. For each and every priestly watch there was</b> a corresponding <b>watch in Jerusalem of priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> When the <b>time arrived</b> for the members of a certain <b>priestly watch to ascend,</b> the <b>priests and Levites</b> of that watch would <b>ascend to Jerusalem.</b>

### Part 5
<b>The Sages taught:</b> There were <b>twenty-four priestly watches in Eretz Yisrael, and twelve in Jericho.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: <b>Twelve in Jericho?</b> In that case <b>there are too many of them,</b> as this makes a total of thirty-six watches. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should be read as follows: There were twenty-four in total, <b>twelve of which were in Jericho.</b> How so? <b>When</b> the <b>time arrived</b> for the members of a certain <b>priestly watch to ascend, half the priestly watch would ascend from</b> all over <b>Eretz Yisrael to Jerusalem, and half the priestly watch would ascend from Jericho, in order to provide water and food to their brothers in Jerusalem</b> from Jericho.

### Part 6
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Priests, Levites, and Israelites</b> are all <b>indispensable for the offering,</b> and consequently, they all must be present when the daily offering is sacrificed. <b>It is taught in a <i>baraita</i></b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> says: <b>Priests, Levites, and musical instruments are indispensable for the offering.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do they <b>disagree? One Sage,</b> Shmuel, <b>holds</b> that <b>the main</b> aspect <b>of</b> the Levites’ <b>song</b> that accompanied the offerings is <b>vocal, and one Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, <b>holds</b> that <b>the main</b> aspect <b>of</b> their <b>song</b> is instrumental, performed <b>with a vessel,</b> and therefore both the Levites and their instruments must be present for the daily offering.

### Part 7
<b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said</b> that <b>Rav said: Moses</b> initially <b>instituted for the Jews eight priestly watches, four from</b> the descendants of <b>Elazar and four from</b> the descendants of <b>Itamar. Samuel came and established them as sixteen,</b> and <b>David came and established them as twenty-four, as it is stated,</b> after the watches are listed: <b>“In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valor at Jazer of Gilead”</b> (I Chronicles 26:31).

### Part 8
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against this opinion from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Moses instituted for the Jews eight priestly watches, four from Elazar and four from Itamar. And David and Samuel came and established them as twenty-four, as it is stated: “Whom David and Samuel the seer ordained in their set office”</b> (I Chronicles 9:22). This <i>baraita</i> indicates that David and Samuel together established the twenty-four watches. The Gemara explains: <b>This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Through their ordination by David and Samuel of Rama</b> the priestly watches incrementally increased in number until <b>they established them as twenty-four.</b>

### Part 9
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Moses instituted for the Jews sixteen priestly watches, eight from Elazar and eight from Itamar. And when the descendants of Elazar grew more numerous than the descendants of Itamar, he divided</b> the descendants of Elazar <b>and established them</b> together with the descendants of Itamar <b>as twenty-four</b> watches, <b>as it is stated: “And there were more chief men found of the sons of Elazar than of the sons of Itamar, and they were divided thus: Of the sons of Elazar there were sixteen heads of fathers’ houses, and of the sons of Itamar, according to their fathers’ houses, eight”</b> (I Chronicles 24:4). <b>And it says: “One father’s house taken for Elazar, and proportionately for Itamar”</b> (I Chronicles 24:6).

### Part 10
<b>The Gemara asks: What is: And it says?</b> Why was it necessary to quote a second verse? The Gemara explains: <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>just as the descendants of Elazar increased, so too, the descendants of Itamar increased,</b> and the <b>eight</b> watches <b>were initially four,</b> as claimed by Rav Ḥama bar Gurya, then <b>come</b> and <b>hear: “One father’s house taken for Elazar, and proportionately for Itamar,”</b> which indicates that the descendants of Itamar remained as they were. This verse is an apparently <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya,</b> who says that Moses established only eight priestly watches.

### Part 11
The Gemara responds: <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that the initial order of the priestly watches <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as indicated by the previous <i>baraita</i>, <b>and I stated</b> my opinion <b>in accordance with that <i>tanna</i> who said</b> that Moses instituted <b>eight</b> priestly watches.

### Part 12
<b>The Sages taught:</b> Only four <b>priestly watches ascended from the</b> Babylonian <b>exile,</b> while the other twenty stayed in Babylonia. <b>And these are</b> the watches who returned: The descendants of <b>Jedaiah, Harim, Pashhur, and Immer. The prophets among</b> those who returned <b>arose</b>
