<b>between</b> the <b>oven and the stove,</b> which was considered the least respectable place in the house. <b>And he</b> would <b>eat</b> his bread, <b>and drink a jug [<i>kiton</i>] of water with it, and</b> in doing so he would <b>resemble one whose deceased</b> relative <b>is laid out</b> unburied <b>before him.</b>

### Part 2
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there:</b> In <b>a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed to perform labor on the Ninth of Av, one performs</b> labor. In <b>a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed not to perform labor,</b> one does <b>not perform</b> labor. <b>And in all places, Torah scholars are idle</b> and do not perform labor on the Ninth of Av. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> With regard to the Ninth of Av, <b>a person should always conduct himself</b> as <b>a Torah scholar</b> and refrain from performing labor. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A person should always conduct himself</b> as <b>a Torah scholar, so that he will</b> feel the hardship of the <b>fast.</b>

### Part 3
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Whoever eats and drinks on the Ninth of Av,</b> although the prohibition was instituted by the Prophets, it is <b>as though he eats and drinks on Yom Kippur. Rabbi Akiva says: Whoever performs labor on the Ninth of Av never sees a sign of a blessing</b> from that work.

### Part 4
<b>And the Sages say: Whoever performs labor on the Ninth of Av and does not mourn for Jerusalem will not see her</b> future <b>joy, as it is stated: “Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad with her, all who love her; rejoice for joy with her, all who mourn for her”</b> (Isaiah 66:10). <b>From here it is stated: Whoever mourns for Jerusalem will merit and see her</b> future <b>joy, and whoever does not mourn for Jerusalem will not see her future joy. This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Whoever eats meat or drinks wine in</b> the meal before <b>the Ninth of Av, about him the verse states: “And whose iniquities are upon their bones,</b> because the terror of the mighty was in the land of the living” (Ezekiel 32:27).

### Part 5
§ The mishna taught: <b>Rabbi Yehuda obligates one to overturn the bed, but the Rabbis did not agree with him. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>the Rabbis said to Rabbi Yehuda: According to your statement, pregnant women and nursing women,</b> who cannot sleep on the floor, <b>what will become of them?</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to them: I, too, spoke only with regard to</b> those <b>who are able.</b>

### Part 6
<b>This is also taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda concedes to the Rabbis with regard to</b> one <b>who is unable</b> to sleep on the floor, <b>and the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Yehuda with regard to one who is able</b> to do so. The Gemara asks: If so, <b>what is</b> the practical difference <b>between them?</b> The Gemara explains: The practical difference <b>between them</b> is the status of <b>other beds.</b>

### Part 7
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When</b> the Rabbis <b>said</b> that a mourner is required <b>to overturn the bed,</b> they meant that <b>he overturns not only his own bed, but</b> also that <b>he</b> must <b>overturn all the beds</b> in the house. Rabbi Yehuda maintains that one must likewise overturn all of the beds of one’s house on the Ninth of Av. <b>Rava said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of <b>our</b> mishna, <b>and the Rabbis did not concede to</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>at all,</b> even with regard to one who is able. Therefore, there is no requirement to overturn one’s bed on the Ninth of Av.

### Part 8
§ The mishna taught that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: There were no days as happy for the Jewish people as the fifteenth of Av and as Yom Kippur.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, Yom Kippur</b> is a day of joy <b>because it has</b> the elements of <b>pardon and forgiveness,</b> and moreover, it is the <b>day on which the last</b> pair of <b>tablets were given.</b>

### Part 9
<b>However, what is</b> the special joy of the <b>fifteenth of Av? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> This was the <b>day on which</b> the members of different <b>tribes were permitted to enter one another’s</b> tribe, by intermarriage. It was initially prohibited to intermarry between tribes, so as to keep each plot of land within the portion of the tribe that originally inherited it. This <i>halakha</i> was instituted by the Torah in the wake of a complaint by the relatives of the daughters of Zelophehad, who were worried that if these women married men from other tribes, the inheritance of Zelophehad would be lost from his tribe (see Numbers 36:1–12).

### Part 10
<b>What did they expound,</b> in support of their conclusion that this <i>halakha</i> was no longer in effect? The verse states: <b>“This is the matter that the Lord has commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad,</b> saying: Let them marry whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry” (Numbers 36:5). They derived from the verse that <b>this matter shall be practiced only in this generation,</b> when Eretz Yisrael was divided among the tribes, but afterward members of different tribes were permitted to marry. On the day this barrier separating the tribes was removed, the Sages established a permanent day of rejoicing.

### Part 11
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> The fifteenth of Av was the <b>day on which the tribe of Benjamin was permitted to enter the congregation</b> of the Jewish people. After the tragic incident at Gibeah, for which the tribe of Benjamin was blamed, the other tribes ostracized them. They took an oath to prohibit themselves from marrying a member of the tribe of Benjamin, <b>as it is stated: “And the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying: None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife”</b> (Judges 21:1). The Gemara asks: <b>What did they expound</b> that enabled them to dissolve this oath? <b>Rav said:</b> They understood the verse literally, as it states: “None <b>of us,” and not:</b> None <b>of our children,</b> i.e., the oath applied only to the generation that took the oath, not their descendants.

### Part 12
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The fifteenth of Av was the <b>day on which the deaths</b> of the Jews <b>in the wilderness ceased.</b> The entire generation that had left Egypt had passed away, <b>as the Master said:</b> After the sin of the spies, on account of which the Jews of that generation were sentenced to die in the wilderness, <b>as long as the death</b> of the Jews <b>in the wilderness had not ceased,</b> God’s <b>speech did not</b> come <b>to Moses, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, that the Lord spoke to me, saying”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:16–17). This indicates that only then, after the last member of that generation had died, was God’s <b>speech</b> delivered <b>to me,</b> i.e., Moses, but not beforehand. When the Jews realized that the decree that God would not speak to Moses had been lifted, they established that day as a permanent day of rejoicing.

### Part 13
<b>Ulla said:</b> The fifteenth of Av was the <b>day on which</b> King <b>Hoshea, son of Ela, canceled</b> the <b>guards that Jeroboam, son of Nevat, placed on the roads so that the Jews</b> would <b>not ascend</b> to Jerusalem <b>for the</b> pilgrim <b>Festival. And</b> Hoshea, son of Ela, <b>said</b>
