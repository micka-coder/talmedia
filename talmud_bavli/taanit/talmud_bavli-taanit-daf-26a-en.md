<b>only on a satisfied soul and a full stomach.</b> Consequently, it is preferable to return home to eat and drink so as to recite <i>hallel</i> in the proper frame of mind. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But Rav Pappa happened</b> to come to <b>the synagogue of Avi Govar</b> in Meḥoza, <b>and he decreed a fast, and rain fell for them before midday, and</b> yet <b>he recited <i>hallel</i></b> immediately, <b>and</b> only afterward <b>they ate and drank.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>The inhabitants of</b> the city of <b>Meḥoza are different, as drunkenness is common among them.</b> Had Rav Pappa told them to go home to eat and drink, they would have become drunk and been unable to pray.

### Part 2
We will return to you the order of "these fasts".

### Part 3
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>At three times in the year priests raise their hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction <b>four times in</b> a single <b>day, in the morning prayer, in the additional prayer, in the afternoon prayer, and</b> in the evening <b>in the closing of the gates,</b> i.e., the <i>ne’ila</i> prayer. And these are the three times: <b>During</b> communal <b>fasts</b> held due to lack of rain, on which the closing prayer is recited; <b>and during non-priestly watches [<i>ma’amadot</i>],</b> when the Israelite members of the guard parallel to the priestly watch come and read the act of Creation from the Torah, as explained below; <b>and on Yom Kippur.</b>

### Part 4
<b>These are</b> the <b>non-priestly watches: Since it is stated: “Command the children of Israel</b> and say to them: <b>My offering of food,</b> which is presented to Me made by a fire, of a sweet savor to Me, you shall guard the sacrifice to Me in its due season” (Numbers 28:2), this verse teaches that the daily offering was a communal obligation that applied to every member of the Jewish people. The mishna asks: <b>But how can a person’s offering be sacrificed when he is not standing next to it?</b>

### Part 5
The mishna explains: Since it is impossible for the entire nation to be present in Jerusalem when the daily offering is brought, <b>the early prophets,</b> Samuel and David, <b>instituted</b> the division of the priests into <b>twenty-four priestly watches,</b> each of which served for approximately one week, twice per year. <b>For each and every priestly watch there was</b> a corresponding <b>non-priestly watch in Jerusalem of priests, Levites, and Israelites</b> who would stand by the communal offerings for that day to represent the community.

### Part 6
<b>When</b> the <b>time arrived</b> for the members of a certain <b>priestly watch to ascend,</b> the <b>priests and Levites</b> of that watch would <b>ascend to Jerusalem</b> to perform the Temple service. <b>And</b> as for <b>the Israelites</b> assigned <b>to that priestly watch,</b> some of them went up to Jerusalem, while the rest of them <b>assembled in their towns and read the act of Creation. And the members of the non-priestly watch,</b> who represented the entire community that week, <b>would fast four days a week, from Monday until Thursday. And they would not fast on Shabbat eve, in deference to Shabbat,</b> as they did not wish to start Shabbat while fasting. <b>And</b> they did <b>not</b> fast on Sunday, <b>so as not to go from rest and delight</b> immediately <b>to exertion and fasting, and</b> run the risk that they might <b>die</b> as a result of the abrupt change.

### Part 7
Which portions of the Torah would the members of the non-priestly watch read on each day? <b>On Sunday</b> they would read the portions starting with: <b>“In the beginning” and “Let there be a firmament”</b> (Genesis 1:1–8). <b>On Monday</b> they would read: <b>“Let there be a firmament” and “Let the waters be gathered”</b> (Genesis 1:9–13). <b>On Tuesday</b> they would read: <b>“Let the waters be gathered” and “Let there be lights”</b> (Genesis 1:14–19). <b>On Wednesday: “Let there be lights” and “Let the waters swarm”</b> (Genesis 1:20–23). <b>On Thursday: “Let the waters swarm” and “Let the earth bring forth”</b> (Genesis 1:24–31). <b>On Friday: “Let the earth bring forth”</b> and <b>“And the heaven</b> and the earth <b>were finished”</b> (Genesis 2:1–3).

### Part 8
<b>A long passage,</b> consisting of six verses or more, <b>is read by two</b> people, <b>and a short</b> passage is read <b>by one,</b> as one cannot read fewer than three verses from the Torah together. They read from the Torah <b>in the morning prayer and in the additional prayer. In the afternoon prayer</b> the members of the non-priestly watch <b>enter</b> the synagogue <b>and read</b> the daily portion <b>by heart, just as one recites <i>Shema</i></b> every day. On <b>Shabbat eve at the afternoon prayer, they would not enter</b> the synagogue for the communal Torah readings, <b>in deference to Shabbat.</b>

### Part 9
The mishna states a principle: On <b>any day that has</b> the recitation of <b><i>hallel</i>,</b> but on which the additional offering was not sacrificed, e.g., Hanukkah, <b>there is no</b> reading of the Torah by the <b>non-priestly watch in the morning prayer.</b> On days that have both <i>hallel</i> and <b>an additional offering,</b> such as Festivals, the non-priestly watch would also <b>not</b> read from the Torah <b>at the closing prayer.</b> When <b>a wood offering</b> was brought, as explained below, there was <b>no</b> non-priestly watch <b>in the afternoon prayer.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>

### Part 10
<b>Ben Azzai said to</b> Rabbi Akiva that <b>this is how Rabbi Yehoshua would teach</b> this <i>halakha</i>: On days when <b>an additional offering</b> was sacrificed, there was <b>no</b> non-priestly watch <b>in the afternoon prayer.</b> When <b>a wood offering</b> was brought, there was <b>no</b> non-priestly watch <b>in the closing prayer.</b> Upon hearing this, <b>Rabbi Akiva retracted</b> his ruling and began <b>to teach in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>ben Azzai.</b>

### Part 11
The mishna details the <b>times</b> for <b>the wood</b> offering <b>of priests and the people.</b> These were private holidays specific to certain families, on which their members would volunteer a wood offering for the altar. There were <b>nine</b> such days and families: <b>On the first of Nisan, the descendants of Araḥ ben Yehuda; on the twentieth of Tammuz, the descendants of David ben Yehuda; on the fifth of Av, the descendants of Parosh ben Yehuda; on the seventh of</b> Av, <b>the descendants of Jonadab ben Rechab; on the tenth of</b> Av, <b>the descendants of Sena’a ben Binyamin; on the fifteenth of</b> Av, <b>the descendants of Zattu ben Yehuda.</b>

### Part 12
<b>And</b> included <b>with</b> this group of Zattu ben Yehuda’s descendants <b>were</b> other <b>priests; and Levites; and anyone who erred with regard to his tribe,</b> i.e., Israelites who did not know which tribe they were from, <b>and the descendants of those who deceived</b> the authorities <b>with a pestle; and the descendants of those who packed dried figs.</b> These last groups and their descriptions are explained in the Gemara.

### Part 13
The mishna resumes its list. <b>On the twentieth of</b> Av, <b>the descendants of Paḥat Moav ben Yehuda; on the twentieth of Elul, the descendants of Adin ben Yehuda; on the first of Tevet, the descendants of Parosh returned</b> to bring wood for <b>a second</b> time; likewise <b>on the first of Tevet, there was no non-priestly watch, as</b> it is Hanukkah, <b>on which <i>hallel</i> is</b> recited, <b>and</b> it is the New Moon, on which <b>an additional offering</b> is sacrificed, <b>and</b> there was also <b>a wood offering.</b>

### Part 14
The mishna discusses the five major communal fast days. <b>Five</b> calamitous <b>matters occurred to our forefathers on the seventeenth of Tammuz, and five</b> other disasters happened <b>on the Ninth of Av. On the seventeenth of Tammuz</b>
