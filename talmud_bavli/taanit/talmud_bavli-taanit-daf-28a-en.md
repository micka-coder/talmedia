<b>as</b> the second reader <b>has space,</b> i.e., he has the option to read from the ensuing paragraph.

### Part 2
§ The mishna taught: <b>A long passage is read by two</b> people, and they read from the Torah <b>in the morning prayer and in the additional prayer. And in the afternoon prayer they read</b> the daily portion <b>by heart,</b> just as one recites <i>Shema</i>. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>what</b> case <b>is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>speaking?</b> Does he mean that <b>in the morning prayer and in the additional prayer they read</b> the portion <b>from</b> a Torah <b>scroll, but in the afternoon prayer</b> each individual <b>reads by heart, just as one recites <i>Shema</i>? Or perhaps this is what is taught: In the morning prayer they read it from</b> a Torah <b>scroll, but in the additional prayer and in the afternoon prayer</b> they read it <b>by heart, just as one recites <i>Shema</i>.</b>

### Part 3
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In the morning prayer and in the additional prayer they</b> would <b>enter the synagogue and read</b> from the Torah <b>in the manner that they read all year. But in the afternoon prayer,</b> a single <b>individual</b> would <b>read</b> the portion for that day <b>by heart. Rabbi Yosei said: But can an individual read matters of Torah by heart in</b> the presence of <b>the community? Rather, they all enter and read</b> that day’s portion together, <b>just as one recites <i>Shema</i>.</b> This <i>baraita</i> clearly indicates that they would read by heart only in the afternoon service.

### Part 4
The mishna taught: On <b>any day that has</b> the recitation of <b><i>hallel</i>,</b> but on which the additional offering was not sacrificed, <b>it has no</b> reading of the Torah by the <b>non-priestly watch</b> in the morning service. On days that have both <i>hallel</i> and an additional offering, there was no reading in the afternoon prayer. When a wood offering was brought, there was no reading in the closing prayer. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <b>difference between this and that,</b> a day on which an additional offering is sacrificed and a day on which a wood offering is brought? The Gemara explains: <b>These</b> days, on which an additional offering is brought, apply <b>by Torah law, but these</b> days, on which a wood offering is brought, apply <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and therefore it overrides only the closing prayer.

### Part 5
The mishna continues with a list of the <b>times</b> for the <b>wood offering of priests and the people. The Sages taught: Why was it necessary to state</b> the <b>times</b> for the <b>wood offering of priests and the people? They said</b> in response that this is what happened: <b>When the people of the exile ascended</b> to Jerusalem in the beginning of the Second Temple period, <b>they did not find</b> enough wood <b>in</b> the Temple <b>chamber</b> for the needs of the altar. <b>And these</b> families <b>arose and donated from their own</b> wood to the Temple.

### Part 6
<b>And the prophets among them stipulated as follows, that even</b> if the entire <b>chamber</b> were <b>full of wood,</b> the descendants of <b>these</b> families <b>would donate wood from their own</b> property on these specific days, <b>as it is stated: “And we cast lots, the priests, the Levites and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, according to our fathers’ houses, at appointed times year by year, to burn upon the altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the Torah”</b> (Nehemiah 10:35). Although these donations were not always necessary, it was established that all generations would observe these days.

### Part 7
The mishna further taught that on the fifteenth of Av, wood was brought by the descendants of Zattu ben Yehuda, <b>and with</b> this group <b>were</b> other <b>priests and Levites, and anyone</b> who erred with regard to his tribe, i.e., Israelites who did not know which tribe they were from, and the descendants of those who deceived the authorities with a pestle, and the descendants of those who packed dried figs. <b>The Sages taught: Who were the descendants of those who deceived</b> the authorities <b>with a pestle and the descendants of those who packed dried figs?</b>

### Part 8
<b>They said</b> in explanation: <b>Once, the evil kingdom</b> of Greece <b>issued</b> a decree <b>of apostasy against the Jews, that they may not bring wood for the arrangement</b> of the altar <b>and that they</b> may <b>not bring first fruits to Jerusalem. And they placed guards [<i>prozda’ot</i>] on the roads, in the manner that Jeroboam, son of Nevat, placed</b> guards, so <b>that the Jews</b> could <b>not ascend for the</b> pilgrim <b>Festival.</b>

### Part 9
<b>What did the worthy and sin-fearing</b> individuals <b>of that generation do? They brought baskets of first fruits, and covered them with dried figs, and took them with a pestle on their shoulders. And when they reached the guards,</b> the guards <b>said to them: Where are you going? They said to them:</b> We are going <b>to prepare two round cakes of pressed figs with the mortar that is</b> down the road <b>before us and with the pestle that</b> we are carrying on <b>our shoulders. As soon as they passed</b> the guards, <b>they decorated the baskets</b> of first fruits <b>and brought them to Jerusalem.</b>

### Part 10
A Sage <b>taught: This</b> was something that was performed in a similar manner by <b>the descendants of Salmai of Netophat.</b> The Gemara explains this comment by quoting a <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Sages taught: Who are the descendants of Salmai of Netophat?</b> They said in explanation: <b>Once, the evil kingdom</b> of Greece <b>issued</b> a decree <b>of apostasy against the Jews, that they may not bring wood for the arrangement</b> of the altar. And they placed guards on the roads, in the manner that Jeroboam, son of Nevat, placed guards, so <b>that the Jews</b> could <b>not ascend for the</b> pilgrim <b>Festival.</b>

### Part 11
<b>What did the sin-fearing</b> individuals <b>of that generation do? They brought their pieces of wood and prepared ladders [<i>sulamot</i>], and they placed</b> the ladders <b>on their shoulders and went off</b> to Jerusalem. <b>When they reached</b> the guards, the guards <b>said to them: Where are you going? They said to them:</b> We are going <b>to bring</b> down <b>doves from the dovecote that is</b> located down the road <b>before us and with these ladders that are on our shoulders. As soon as they had passed</b> the guards, <b>they dismantled</b> the ladders <b>and took them up to Jerusalem.</b> The name Salmai alludes to the Hebrew word for ladder, <i>sulam</i>.

### Part 12
<b>And about these</b> families who provided these donations <b>and</b> others <b>like them,</b> the verse <b>says: “The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing”</b> (Proverbs 10:7), as they are remembered for the good throughout the generations. <b>And about Jeroboam, son of Nevat, and his ilk, it is stated: “But the name of the wicked shall rot”</b> (Proverbs 10:7).

### Part 13
§ The mishna taught: <b>On the twentieth of</b> Av, the wood offering was brought by <b>the descendants of Pahath Moab ben Yehuda.</b> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught: The descendants of Pahath Moab ben Yehuda are the descendants of David ben Yehuda.</b> He is called Moab because Ruth the Moabite was the grandmother of David’s father, Yishai. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says: These are the descendants of Joab, son of Zeruiah,</b> whose mother was the daughter of Yishai and therefore also descended from Ruth.

### Part 14
The mishna further taught: <b>On the twentieth of Elul, the descendants of Adin ben Yehuda</b> brought their wood offering. <b>The Sages taught: The descendants of Adin ben Yehuda are the descendants of David ben Yehuda,</b> who was called Adin. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: These are the descendants of Joab, son of Zeruiah.</b>

### Part 15
The mishna taught: <b>On the first of Tevet, the descendants of Parosh returned</b> to bring wood for <b>a second</b> time. The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the author of this opinion of <b>the mishna?</b> It is <b>not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, nor</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, nor</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>If it</b> represents the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, let him teach,</b> with regard to the twentieth of Av, that <b>the descendants of David ben Yehuda returned</b> for <b>a second</b> time. According to Rabbi Meir, the descendants of Pahath Moab are the descendants of David, and consequently they would return for a second time on that date.

### Part 16
The Gemara continues: <b>If it</b> represents the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, let him teach</b> that <b>the descendants of David ben Yehuda returned</b> for <b>a second</b> time on a different date, the twentieth of Elul, as he contends that the descendants of Adin ben Yehuda are the descendants of David. <b>And if</b> the mishna represents the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, let him teach</b> that the <b>descendants of Joab, son of Zeruiah, returned</b> for <b>a second</b> time, as he maintains that the descendants of Pahath Moab and the descendants of Adin ben Yehuda are both the descendants of Joab.

### Part 17
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna represents the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, and</b> there are <b>two <i>tanna’im</i></b> whose opinion is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> One <i>tanna</i> maintains that only the descendants of Pahath Moab are the descendants of Joab, while the other claims that only the descendants of Adin ben Yehuda are the descendants of Joab. According to both opinions, neither group was repeated a second time, and therefore the mishna does not pose a difficulty to either of them.

### Part 18
§ The mishna taught that <b>on the first of Tevet there was no non-priestly watch</b> at all, as there was an additional offering, <i>hallel</i>, and a wood offering. <b>Mar Kashisha, son of Rav Ḥisda, said to Rav Ashi:</b>
