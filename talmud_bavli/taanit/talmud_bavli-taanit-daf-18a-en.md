<b>only to prohibit</b> eulogizing on <b>the day before. Here too, it is necessary</b> to mention Passover <b>only to prohibit</b> eulogizing on the <b>following day.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this ruling? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who said</b> that eulogizing is <b>prohibited both</b> on the day <b>before</b> the date recorded in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> <b>and</b> on the <b>following day.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> with regard to <b>the twenty-ninth</b> of Adar <b>too, why</b> state <b>specifically</b> that eulogizing is prohibited then <b>because it is the day before the day on which the daily offering was established? Let him derive</b> this prohibition from the fact <b>that it is the day after the twenty-eighth of</b> Adar.

### Part 2
<b>As it is taught</b> in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>: <b>On the twenty-eighth of</b> Adar <b>good tidings came to the Jews, that they would not be restricted from Torah</b> study, and they declared this date a commemorative day. The <i>baraita</i> proceeds to describe the events of this day. <b>As on one occasion the wicked empire,</b> Rome, <b>issued a decree of apostasy against the Jews, that they may not occupy themselves with Torah</b> study, <b>and that they may not circumcise their sons, and that they must desecrate Shabbat.</b> What did <b>Yehuda ben Shammua and his colleagues do? They went and sought</b> the <b>advice of a certain</b> Roman <b>matron [<i>matronita</i>] whose</b> company was kept <b>by all the prominent</b> people <b>of Rome.</b>

### Part 3
<b>She said to them: Arise and cry out [<i>hafginu</i>] at night. They went and cried out at night, saying: O Heaven! Are we not brothers? Are we not children of one father? Are we not</b> the <b>children of one mother? How are we different from any other nation and tongue that you</b> single us out and <b>issue against us evil decrees?</b> Their cries were effective, <b>and</b> the authorities <b>annulled</b> the decrees, <b>and they made that day</b> a commemorative <b>holiday.</b>

### Part 4
§ Since the twenty-eighth of Adar is also a commemorative day, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, it is also prohibited to fast on the following day. The question therefore remains: Why was it necessary to list the New Moon of Nisan, when the day before was already prohibited? <b>Abaye said: It is necessary</b> to include the New Moon of Nisan <b>only for</b> the case of <b>a full,</b> thirty-day <b>month.</b> If the month of Adar is thirty days long, fasting on the thirtieth day would be prohibited only because it is the day preceding the New Moon, not because it follows the twenty-eighth of Adar.

### Part 5
<b>Rav Ashi said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that we are dealing <b>with a deficient month,</b> with twenty-nine days, the inclusion of the New Moon of Nisan can still be explained. The reason is that with regard to <b>all</b> days <b>that follow</b> the dates listed in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>, <b>fasting is prohibited but eulogizing is permitted. But</b> in <b>this</b> case, <b>since</b> the twenty-ninth of Adar <b>is positioned between two</b> commemorative <b>holidays,</b> the twenty-eighth of Adar and the New Moon of Nisan, the Sages <b>made it like</b> a commemorative <b>holiday in its own right, and</b> it is therefore <b>prohibited even to eulogize</b> on this date.

### Part 6
§ <b>The Master said</b> above, in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>: <b>From the eighth of</b> Nisan <b>until the end of the festival</b> of Passover, <b>the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> was restored,</b> and it was decreed <b>not to eulogize</b> during this period. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need it <b>to say: From the eighth of</b> Nisan? <b>Let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>say: From the ninth of</b> Nisan, <b>and the eighth itself</b> will still be prohibited because, <b>as</b> stated earlier, <b>it is the day on which the daily offering was established.</b>

### Part 7
The Gemara answers: <b>Since if</b> a calamitous <b>event happened and they canceled the seven</b> days commemorating the establishment of the daily offering, <b>the eighth</b> day <b>itself</b> will remain <b>prohibited, as it is the first day on which the festival of <i>Shavuot</i> was restored.</b> Since this date is not merely the last of the series for the daily offering, but it also commemorates the restoration of <i>Shavuot</i>, it is not affected by the cancellation of the previous seven days.

### Part 8
The Gemara notes: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> conclusion, the same logic can be applied to <b>the twenty-ninth</b> of Adar <b>as well: Since if</b> a calamitous <b>event happened and they canceled</b> the commemoration of <b>the twenty-eighth</b> of Adar, nevertheless, <b>the twenty-ninth</b> day <b>itself</b> will remain <b>prohibited, as it is the first day on which the daily offering was established.</b>

### Part 9
<b>It was stated</b> that there is a dispute between <i>amora’im</i>: <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Asi said</b> that <b>Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> that with regard to all the days mentioned in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> on which eulogizing is prohibited, it is likewise prohibited to eulogize on the day before and the day after. <b>And Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the unattributed mishna, who said that although it is prohibited to eulogize on the day before, it is permitted on the day after.

### Part 10
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say this? But isn’t it</b> taught in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: And what</b> is the meaning when <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> <b>states: On them, on them, twice,</b> in the phrases: Not to eulogize on them, and: Not to fast on them. This phrase is repeated <b>to say to you</b> that fasting and eulogizing <b>on these</b> days themselves <b>is prohibited,</b> but on the days <b>before</b> and on the <b>following</b> days it is <b>permitted. And Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b> How, then, can it be said that Shmuel ruled in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir?

### Part 11
The Gemara answers: <b>Initially,</b> Shmuel <b>maintained</b> that <b>since there is no</b> other <b><i>tanna</i> as lenient as Rabbi Meir, he said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. When he heard that</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon</b> ben Gamliel <b>was more lenient,</b> he said that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b> Shmuel consistently ruled in the most lenient manner possible on this issue.

### Part 12
<b>And similarly,</b> the Sage <b>Bali said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> bar Abba <b>said to Bali: I will explain</b> this ruling <b>to you. When Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> he was not referring to all matters. Rather, he spoke specifically <b>with regard to</b> the day before those dates concerning which <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> said: <b>Fasting is prohibited.</b> However, with regard to those days on which it is prohibited to eulogize, he did not rule in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, as Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that eulogizing on the following day is permitted.

### Part 13
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this? But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> as a principle that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is always in accordance with <b>an unattributed mishna. And we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Although</b> the Sages <b>said,</b> with regard to reading of the Scroll of Esther, that <b>one</b> may read it <b>earlier but one</b> may <b>not</b> read it <b>later,</b>
